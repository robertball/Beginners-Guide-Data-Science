Awesome flavor, quick and simple to make. I did use 2 cans of basil, garlic and oregano diced tomatoes with their juices instead of fresh tomatoes other than that I followed the recipe. The only reason I gave this a 4 stars is because the sauce was watery, maybe I will use less of the juices and let it reduce before serving. I will definately be making this again.(Update: I did make this again and still used 2 cans of basil, garlic and oregano diced tomatoes but drained the juices from one can and then while cooking I let the sauce reduce until it was thick enough and not watery.)

I love this recipe.  I used fresh garden tomatoes, tripled the garlic,  added dried oregano, and omitted salt.  Because the tomato mixture doesn't really make a sauce, I added 1 cup of white wine and just under a cup of chicken broth.  Let everything simmer and it was simply delicious and light. The grated parmesan cheese is an essential finishing touch.  I will definitely include this dish in my regular rotation.  Thanks!

This was very tasty.  I didn't have fresh tomatoes on hand so I added a 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes.  I'm sure this is even better with fresh tomatoes.  If using canned tomatoes, I think 1 tsp. sugar would help cut the tang of the tomatoes.  My husband enjoyed this so I'll make this again!

I absolutely LOVED this!!! (and so did the rest of the girls!)  I have to admit that i didnt really follow the measurements at all, i just kind of went guesstimated!  I used a good amount of onions & chopped garlic cloves as well as hot pepper flakes.  I also used diced tomatoes from a can and i thought it was perfect.  Next time I will probably marinate the chicken in olive oil & fresh basil to give it more flavor.  Other than that, not only did it taste fantastic but it looked fabulous as well!! (it even was good as leftovers the next day!!!)


*I made this again, and this time marinated the chicken overnight in Sun Dried Tomato dressing. It was a great touch!  Also, I used Hunt's diced tomatoes with Basil, Garlic & Oregeno flavor, it definelty contributes to the overall taste

We like basil, so I put in extra -- probably around 1 1/2 cups. I'll probably use a red pepper flakes, or a sprinkle of cayenne next time.  I think our hot pepper sauce has lost its kick, so this dish didn't have any peppery zip, but the overall flavor was great. I don't think this would have been nearly as good with canned tomatoes, so we will save this recipe and make it again during fresh tomato season. I can also see either substituting shrimp or tofu for the chicken, or leaving it out altogether, for a change of pace.

This was very good, i used penne instead of angel hair. I sauted the onion with garlic and chicken, along with salt pepper, garlic powder, oregano, crushed red chile peppers, and added 1 14oz can of diced tomatoes with basil and garlic  I put a pinch of sugar to cut the bitterness of the tomatoes.  I tossed with the pasta and it was sooooo goood. Thx!

Like others, I did not have all fresh tomatoes on hand so I had to subsitute some canned diced tomatoes and I think that might be the way I'd make it again. I also added a little sugar to taste.

This is amazing. Not heavy like a regular pasta sauce.  I can't say I followed the measurements.  Everything was eyeballed and wonderful.  Didn't have enough fresh basil so added some extra dry.  But wished I'd had more fresh.  Had RomaGrape tomatoes needed using and one left over from my garden. Also added a few sundried as suggested by another 'viewer. Only hot sauce I had on hand was a Thai Garlic Chili Pepper Sauce that I might have gone just a little heavy on...  hmmm good....  And to quote a favourite AD of mine... "I love to cook with wine.  Sometimes I even add it to the food I cook."  so I did.  Added a big splash of white wine.  Scrump-dili-oo-tious.!.!.! From the number of reviews (and no I didn't read ALL of them) this has been around for a long time.  And gonna be around for more! Thank you Wendy for a "light" pasta dish.  (sub shrimp next time?)

I love this recipe and we have it about once a month.  I think it's great the way it is.  I use Roma tomatoes since I've heard they are the best for cooking.  I think people that don't like this recipe can't appreciate pasta that's not swimming in sauce.  I don't think it's bland at all.  My husband tends to like more sauce on everything so he's commented that it needs more sauce but he still loves the flavor.

I did not care for this recipe. As I started making it, I started realizing it may not taste very good. The recipe lacked as sort of taste other than the salty taste of tomatoes. I really disliked this recipe. You may just be better off cooking chicken and adding pasta sauce. I was hoping for a wonderful valentine's day dinner and it tasted like I cooked pasta and ate it plain.

I used fresh Roma tomatoes in this dish. Delicious! When I finished making it, I felt it needed a nice sauce to compliment the flavors. I ended up using the Alfredo sauce posted by Rebecca on this site.I served over linquini. What a yummy and filling meal. Thanks Wendy.

Wow!  That was fantastic Wendy! I wish I could give it a 10!  And so healthy too.  The only changes I made was the order I cooked it. I saut√©ed the chicken first with the garlic, then added the onion and continued cooking.  Last I added the tomatoes (fresh Romas from my garden)with the seasonings. YUM!!
UPDATE: I made it again.  This time I added Fresh sauteed mushrooms a bit more and some olives.  I didn't think it could be improved but it was EVEN BETTER!Now it rated 11!  =)

This was a GREAT recipe..however..from reading the reviews from the other people who had tried it I automatically tried some of their suggestions. I did not use fresh tomatoes but instead used 1can of Italian Seasoned Stewed tomatoes and 1 can of regular diced tomatoes. I also added about 1/2 can of tomato paste and about 2 1/2 cloves of garlic. In addition, when I sauted the onions I added a little bit of white wine to the skillet and a couple dashes of red pepper. (i used this in place of the pepper sauce). The kids LOVED it and so did I. I sided it with a great ceasar salad. This recipe is perfect for any "anytime" meal or to impress your most prestiged guests! Thanks Wendy!!!

5 stars with changes: I made a few changes and this turned out so delicious.  I sauteed onions and garlic in olive oil and browned cut up chicken in that.  Then I added chicken broth, a can of diced tomatoes (with oregano, etc) and white wine and the other ingredients (I used 1 tsp crushed pepper instead of hot sauce) and I added some black pepper and a teaspoon of sugar (left fresh basil out until last 10 min).    Then I let it simmer for maybe an hour.  I used mini penne and mixed it all together and topped with shredded parm.   DELICIOUS!

A quick, easy recipe with everyday ingredients that are usually on hand. It based the husband test:)
 Because some viewers said it was bland I seasoned heavily. Since I was preparing for rwo people I used:
  1 piece of boneless breast that I seasoned with garlic/onion powder before browning on stovetop,  2 big garlic cloves, 1/2 med.sized onion, plenty of oregano(per other reviews), easy on the dried basil(no fresh on hand),and two cans of stewed Italian tomatoes with juice. I added pepper, dash of salt, garlic powder, and about 1 teaspoon of sugar(per other reviews).
   I then turned heat up to med. high -covered pot- turned down to med. low and let simmer for about 20 min. I think covering it helped keep it from drying out, as some reviewers complained. Once cooked remove from heat to prevent drying out. It defintely needed the juice from the tomatoes.  Once chicken cooked I stuck it in freezer for a minute so I could shred it a bit (with my hand,nothing fancy). I Added shredded chicken to sauce  and spaghetti until it looked like an even mixture of pasta to sauce. All in all - a 30 min. meal!
Remember - season heavily, use seasoned tomatoes and it'll be a dish to add to your rotation.

Great recipe Wendy! I used more garlic and used (2 cans)canned tomatoes. I also added a stalk of chopped celery and 1/2 chopped green bell pepper and sauted them with the onions/garlic. Finally, while simmering, I added a dash of dry Italian seasonings and served over Fetticini noodles. Very good and a very easy dish to prepare. We loved it!

I made it just as the recipe said the first 
time, then I decided the next time to grill the
chicken, and in the sauce use shallots
instead of the onion and garlic. Also, I thought
it tasted better without the hot pepper sauce.
The fresh basil, tomatoes and parmesan is
just delicious.

With a few minor alterations, this dish was AMAZING. Here's what I did...I marinated the chicken over-night in olive oil and Italian seasoning. I added mushrooms to the sauce and also used more garlic. I used 2 cans of Hunt's Diced Tomatoes with Basil, Garlic, and Oregano instead of fresh tomatoes. It was very flavorful. My husband said it was one of the best dinners I have ever cooked!

My husband and I loved this recipe!  We used fresh pasta and left out the hot pepper sauce.  We could have eaten the whole dish in one sitting!  But we're having the leftovers for lunch.  Thanks!

This was very good, but I did make a little change that my family loved.  I used some fresh tomatoes and sun-dried tomatoes.  It gave it a little zing we felt it needed.

this recipe was awesome!!! i didn't have fresh basil so used dried, was still very good, but would recommend using fresh. the fresh tomatoes are key to the recipe. i also added some other veggies, just to add some vitamins, and it was GREAT. it's not a "saucy" pasta dish, if that's what you are expecting you won't like it, but if you find it to be too dry, i would add some olive oil to the pasta...but left as it is, it's very low calorie and fat ( and easy too).

Very yummy.  I must admit I made some changes to suit my taste buds, so here they are: Placed in gallon ziploc bag, 4 cubed chicken breasts along with:

2 tbsp italian seasoning
1 tbsp garlic powder
1 tbsp essence of emeril  (recipe on food network)
2 tbsp onion powder
2 tbsp olive oil

Keep all in bag, shaken, in fridge til sauce ready for chicken to be cooked.  First added onions and garlic, let start cooking while chopping 9 roma tomatoes, added, then chopped 1/2 cup fresh basil, then added raw seasoned chicken from gallon bag.  Added 1 cup white wine and put on low/med heat for 5 min to start cooking chicken. Then proceeded with rest of recipe as written. Came out flavorful and very garlicky, but that's a good thing in my book! If you try it, hope you like it!

This is a favorite in my house. I make it without the chicken too and it is just as good. I love it as leftovers also.

We'll definitely make it again, but next time, we'll add some extra tomatoes and basil to make it have a little more flavor.

It's basically just a tomato sauce over noodles.  Chicken is better when cooked in the sauce!

(Follow noodle time, not what this says)

Pretty tasty dinner we just finished! I thought the hot pepper sauce sounded weird, but went with it anyway and it was delicious! Easy enough to make that I could pull this off in 30 minutes from inception to digestion!

Great flavor but the sauce wasn't enough so I doubled it and added 1/2 cup white wine and 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes instead of the chili sauce. I also used the parm crust in the sauce while it cooked.

Mmm, very very good! While this isn't as saucy as I usually like my spaghetti, it tastes great.  My husband loved it!  The only additions I made were adding a little bit of sugar to the sauce and marinating the chicken before hand.  I did a basic extra-virgin olive oil, bit of red wine vinegar, basil, garlic, salt and pepper.  This made a huge difference when I made it a second time.

I like to double this recipe.  This is a kind of spaghetti where the leftovers taste better every day!  When I double I use 6 medium sized tomatoes.

This was awesome!  Made exactly as written, except used three cloves extra garlic and added 1 tsp. oregano and a dash of fennel, as well as a little extra salt.  Quick, easy, and absolutely delish.  This will have a permanent spot on our rotation.

I used a few cherry tomatoes from my garden as well as a roma tomato. The flavour of the dish was excellent, but I didn't have angel hair so I used linguini. The texture wasn't quite right for the dish, so next time I will definitely use angel hair.

This was exactly as described - a very light sauce. I cooked the chicken with the garlic and onions like one reviewer suggested and added mushrooms. I used garden tomatoes.

My BF loved this! I used some red wine to deglaze after sauteing the onions and used a large can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh. If you have watery sauce try undercooking your pasta and adding it to the sauce to finish cooking I do this but also added some starchy pasta water I had reserved before draining the pasta. This helps the pasta & sauce really become one and meld together :-)

Great receipe. Absolutely amazing flavor. Just needs more garlic and hot sauce as suits to your taste. Other than that it is a truly refreshing, as well as easy to make. Everyone loved it. Thanks.

I got this recipe out of my great american recipes cookbook and we love it. Sometimes I add a can of tomato sauce to make it more saucy. I always use can tomatoes and it comes out great. I also use bottled basil if there is no fresh one available. This recipe does not disappoint. One of my favorites. Oh and I always add a can of Rotel for spice.

This was delicious! I added alot more fresh basil, more onion, 1 cup wine, an additional 1/8th teaspoon of hot pepper sauce and about 3 cups fresh chopped plum tomatoes, skins on. Next time I will boil tomatoes for 30 seconds & take skins off. Either way? Delicious.  =)

I can't believe someone would add liquid not called for in the recipe and then state that it was rated 4 stars because there was too much liquid. It is even scarier that people found the review helpful.  Try it as written, absolutely delicious.

This recipe was awesome.  My husband is not a fan of "healthy", but he loved this!  I changed a few things...1) sauteed mushrooms in balsamic vinegar, garlic and olive oil and added it toward the end 2) diced one fresh tomato and added one can of diced tomatoes in balsamic, garlic and olive oil (hunts)3) added thyme and lawrys seasoned salt.  It was excellent and even better the next day!  Definetly NOT dry or bland.

I omitted the hot pepper sauce because i was eating this with my 4 yr old daughter, and i knew she wouldn't like it hot. This was great, so more-ish! I couldnt stop eating it!!! Definitely a regular on our table.

This was delicious! I chopped the breasts of a roasted chicken from the grocery store and added it to the sauce at the end to warm. I added a red bell pepper, extra garlic, and about double the Parmesan. I didn't have any hot pepper sauce on hand, so I added a healthy dose of crushed red pepper. The leftovers were also wonderful.

My husband raved about this. I did make a few changes. I cut up raw chicken breast and rubbed it with salt, pepper, and garlic powder for a few hours before cooking. I also used a can of diced tomatoes with basil, garlic, and oregano instead of regular tomatoes (couldn't find any good fresh ones). I did think the dish was a bit too salty, but that was due to the chicken rub and using canned, not fresh tomatoes. I'll be making this dish again and again. Thanks!

Overall this was a good recipe.  I modified it quite a bit after reading some reviews.  Will definitely make this again.  I sauted about 6 sun dried tomatoes, sliced thin w/the onion about doubled the garlic, also several dashes of crushed red pepper.  Once the onion was translucent I lightly browned the chicken, then added stewed italian tomatoes w/juice and a can of diced tomatoes drained.  Splashed some balsamic and red wine... voila, moist and delicious. (Also I cooked the pasta in the sauce briefly so it would absorb)

From the ingredients and the reviews I was expecting this to be amazing.  I was so disappointed!  It was a lot of work and a lot of different pots and pans and I really didn't like the results.  Maybe I didn't make it correctly or something, but there was no sauce to this and I found it very dry and lacking any substance.  It smelled wondeful when it was cooking, but what a disappointment!  I would not make this again.

Not bad. I found this to be a tad bland for my liking (if you are looking for a hearty pasta entree, this is NOT it!), but beyond that, what REALLY stood out to me was the bright, fresh flavors and genius simplicity of this dish. The thermometer nearly reached 90 degrees this weekend. I couldn't have found a better weather-appropriate recipe - not only is this light on the stomach, it's made with seasonally available ingredients and can easily be prepared on the stovetop (thus eliminating the need to use my oven in this heat wave). NOTE: For a nice change of pace, shrimp would be FANTASTIC in this (and a better protein option than chicken, IMHO). Shrimp are delicate, light and fresh and would be a perfect substitute if you have them handy. Just add a crusty loaf of bread and some good wine, and you're are set! All in all, this was yummy, but lacking the WOW factor I was looking for. Thanks anyways, Ms. Mercadante! :-)

I made this recipe for my family with high hopes. My family HATED it and I was very very very disappointed. I definitely will be removing this from my recipe box. I strongly don't recommend this. >:(

I really thought this sounded like it would be good, but it turned out to be blagh. I won't be making this again.

We had delicious local tomatoes that were looking to be used up, along with the last of my fresh basil plants... this was perfect! I skipped adding the chicken and used whole wheat linguini to use up an open box of pasta...but otherwise followed the recipe. I loved it! Light and delicious - loved the little boost of flavor the hot pepper sauce added. This is a keeper for a quick go-to meal!

I have been making this same recipe for years. It is one of our favorites. The only thing I change is to add more fresh basil we love it and grow it especiially for this recipe.

I'm rating this recipe for my review as the family didn't like it They are very fussy and didn't like the tomato chunks. I even used petite diced in the can and I couldn't get away with it Wanted more sauce because I wanted to use the full pound of angel hair so I added another can of crushed tomato with basil, also to try to cover up the chunks of tomato. Used dried basil and extra hot sauce. I really liked it a lot! Only wish the family did. So hard to cook when one likes one thing and the other one doesn't.

I loved this recipe! I did change it a little. I used fresh everything else but added crushed red pepper when cooking the chicken and some herbes de provence. Once everything was cooked I felt the tomato taste was a little over-acidic so I added some balsamic vinegar for a hint of sweet. It really did the trick! i ended up with a hint of spice from the crushed red pepper and an incredibly fresh tasting dish!

I will definitely be making it again.

I was worried this would be bland but it wasn't. I marinaded the chicken in olive oil and lemon over night and then cooked it with the green onions and garlic.  I added stewed tomatoes with onion instead of freshand added a little tomato sauce but not much.  I also added a bit of motz.  Will make again!  Great!

Good recipe.  I quartered fresh cherry tomatoes, chopped a large vidalia onion, a whole bunch of green onions (scallions..my fiance loves them), a whole bunch of fresh basil, and about 6 cloves of garlic.  I kept the onions, scallions and garlic together.  I heated the olive oil over medium-high heat, then added the garlic, chopped green onions and the chopped vidalia onion.  Then I added the quartered cherry tomatoes and chopped basil.  I stirred until the tomatoes got soft.    I then threw it into a large bowl that had the pasta already in it.  I then added the hot sauce and mixed everything together with tongs.  I used El Yucateco green hot sauce because it's what I had on hand.  I pretty much followed the recipe to a t but I added a lot more onion than the recipe called for.  I forgot the salt but I don't think it needed it because I did cover our plates with grated Parmesan cheese.  I do recommend using hot sauce, it gives it a great flavor.  Thank you for sharing the recipe Wendy.

Not bad, but we definitely prefer a little more sauce.  I would add 8 oz of flavored tomato sauce and double the hot sauce.

One of my favorite recipes from this site!  I did take someone's suggestion and double the sauce (it's necessary, imho).  And I add more garlic when I make this, because you can really never have too much garlic, but otherwise this recipe is perfect as-is!

I love, love, love this recipe! It's one of my kids' favorites as well.  I originally found this recipe in 2007, and have been making it ever since.  It is so fresh, and so tasty, especially in the summer when you can use vine ripe tomatoes.  I add a lot more garlic, and you really have to use the shredded parmesan cheese, not the sprinkle stuff in the can.  Delicioso!!!

My family and I love this recipe.  The only changes I made was to add more garlie and a can of basil/oregano tomato sauce and used canned tomatoes also seasoned with basil and oregano.  Will definitely make this again.

I liked this recipe but changed it a little by adding tomato paste and only 1 can of diced tomatoes (with basil and oregano) instead of the 2 and 1/2 cups tomatoes.  The sauce was thick, but good!

It was a bit boring- I made it according to the recipe.  Maybe the next time I will add a few things to spice it up - I think it needs some veggies - maybe some eggplant or courgettes.

This had a lot more flavor than I was expecting. Next time I make this I'll try to make a little more sauce. We used chopped grape tomatoes and a little bit of canned diced tomatoes. Next time I won't drain the can. Definitely recommend this for a light dinner.

I have been making this recipe for months now and I love it, but I have made a lot of revisions. First, my husband and I prefer this with spicy italian sausage. I also add one small can of tomato paste to thicken it up and a splash of wine. Other than that I follow the recipe exactly.

This was simple and excellent. The only changes I made to the recipe was to (1)marinate the chicken in Italian dressing for about 30 mins and then grill, (2)double the amount of fresh basil, (3)add just under a tbsp of sugar to the sauce, and (4)coated the pasta with pesto before combining with the sauce. It was a huge hit with the fam and not too fussy at all. Thanks!

EXCELLENT Restaurant Quality meal!!  My family LOVED this recipe (My husband raved about it and my kids, a teenager, a 10 yr old and an 8 yr old, all cleaned their plates). I wasn't able to follow the recipe exactly - I didn't have fresh basil or fresh tomatoes.  I used one 15 oz can of diced tomatoes, and one 8 oz can of tomato sauce and I used dried basil, about 1 1/2 tblsp.  I imagine it would be even better with the fresh ingredients. I used one chicken breast (pounded flat and fried in olive oil, removed it from the pan and used the same pan to make the sauce - one pan for the sauce + one pan for the pasta = EASY clean Up!! With salad and bread this meal is FANTASTIC!! One average sized breast of chicken fed 5 people.... talk about economical!! This is definitely going to be made again and again at my house....... maybe next time I'll use shrimp.......Absolutely a YUMMY recipe - don't be afraid to give it a try!!

This is a good dish, but I would strongly recommend that you marinate in the oil, garlic, basil and a little lemon prior to cooking. There really is not much flavor in the chicken when you don't. Other than that, I followed recipe exactly as written and it was delicious!

This was delicous, but like several other reviewers we had to add a can of diced tomatoes.  There was just too much pasta and too little tomatoes to go around otherwise.  It was really good with the additional tomatoes though.

One word: delicious!! This is such an easy recipe and perfect for learners. This was the first recipe I found and tried on allrecipes.com. I've made this several times now. I follow the recipe exactly except I use canned tomatoes. Do not drain the can!! Add the juice to the mixture to prevent dryness! My husband loves it and we always finish the whole thing!!

This dish was wonderful and light.  We loved it.  We cubed chicken breast and cooked it in a little olive oil, but I bet that those  Perdue Short Cuts (pre cooked chicken) would work well and shorten the time considerably.  Will make this again for certain!

This was good!  I used canned tomatoes.  I haven't read the other reviews... this has probably already been mentioned...But don't cook your angel hair for 8-9 minutes.  Four to five minutes is more like it.

Yummmmy!!!  This was a very easy dish to prepare and tasted great.  I did add an extra clove of garlic and grilled the chicken instead.  I ate the left overs the next day for lunch...and it's just as good cold.  What a great summer dish!!! Thanks so much for the recipe! :-)

It's as everyone else said - very easy, and very tasty.  My husband really enjoyed it, which is always a good thing.  We used turkey instead of chicken because that was what we had.  I took other people's advice and added a few mushrooms, and used canned diced tomatos for convenience.  Also served with with a caesar salad as someone said they had done, and some Matt and Bob (Ernest and Julio) White zinfandel - very nice!

Will make it again with angel hair as I only had spaghetti and with some additional spices as it was slightly bland. A couple of small adjustments should add it to a regular rotation as it is simple and quick.

This is an excellent dish.  When I read the reviews I noticed that many of the reviewers who didn't like it, changed the recipe.  You need to be sure and use fresh basil and fresh tomatoes to get the best result.  Also for those who said it was bland, be sure that you have seasoned your chicken before you cook it, if not it will lend to a very bland dish.  I highly recommend.  I did increase the onion and garlic amounts because I know my family prefers more of those flavors but that was done for our taste buds.

3 things bring this up to perfect. 1) be sure to use  2 cans diced tomatoes WITH Basil , Oregano and Garlic, as other reviewers noted. 2) This is much better if you season raw chicken with salt, garlic and herbs like basil and oregano . Then brown  but no need to fully cook. Let it cook the rest if the way in the tomatoes. 3) Either cook down to thicken OR add in a 1t. or so of tomatoe paste, or a small can of tomate sauce 
 I like to pulse the tomates for just a second or 2 till mostly blended
I also stir in FRESH baby spinach. Then top the whole thing with parm cheese and some mozzerella.

This was super easy and delicious. My husband isn't too into tomatoes and onions but when they're saut√©ed like this recipe, he was into it!! I pretty much just eyeballed the measurements and I used more olive oil & it turned out just fantastic! I highly recommend it.

Great recipe!  I used fresh tomatoes, but I also added a can of Italian-style stewed tomatoes to make it a little juicier.  I find that cooking basil makes it lose its flavor, so I added the basil after cooking, along with the Parmesan cheese.

Delicious!  My family really liked it.  My only problem with the recipe is it did not realize it called for precooked chicken, so I had to stop and quickly cook up the chicken meat, so it took me a bit longer than expected to get it on the table.  However, instead of using parmesan cheese at the end, I added asiago when I added the tomatoes, chicken, basil, salt and hot pepper sauce.  I did this because I had some fresh asiago on hand.  The dish was delicious, and all was well.  A definite do-over!

As I type this...the very picky husband is getting another helping.  I used 2 cloves of garlic, minced.  Used two cans of tomato, basil, and garlic...drained...like others said.  I gave it a splash or two of white wine.  It was PERFECT!  Easy too...after a long day of work. Will be making this many times...

I love this recipe and have made it a million times! Today however, I needed to make something quick and didn't have any basil on hand. So I made this recipe to the T except I replaced the fresh basil with 1T dried oregano and 1T dried Thyme. It came out AMAZING. I must say, I actually prefer it that way (but I also am not the biggest fan of basil to begin with). Anyway, thought I would share in case someone else didn't have basil on hand!

A wonderfully light and quick dinner. Cooked marinated chicken first. Then removed from pan and followed receipe. I used fresh basil and followed the advice of other reviewers and used three garlic cloves and added chicken broth and oregano to the sauce. I also added red bell peppers and used farfalle pasta. Served with french bread and salad. All the flavors blended great together for a nice light meal. My daughter who normally leaves her vegetables behind on her plate, ate every bite. She was wiping the plate clean with her bread. Will definitely make again

This was a light and delicious dish - a really good combination of flavors.  I, per other reviewer suggestions, tinkered with the ingredients a bit:  upped the garlic to 3 cloves, used around 1/2 cup fresh basil, added in some oregano, garlic powder, black pepper, and red pepper flakes.
I didn't have pre-cooked chicken, so I cubed and sauteed the chicken with the onion and garlic (and spices) until cooked, added in the chopped tomatoes and a little bit of chicken stock to make is "sauce-y"  Simmered for 15-20 minutes and everything was delicious!  A nice little kick from the hot sauce (used a habanero sauce) and wonderful fresh flavors.  Will definitely make again

This has a wonderful flavor!  I added a chopped green bell pepper and threw in a handful of spinach with the chicken.  I like that it doesn't take much time.  I'll definitely make it again, and I think it's going to be one of my family's favorites.

This was delicious and easy to make. I used canned tomatoes with garlic, basil, and oregano. I recommend draining the tomatoes before cooking so as to reduce the liquid.

This is quick and easy.  Plus, way better than plain old pasta with marinara.

I loved this recipe.  The only thing I changed was adding mushooms and a cup of the pasta water.  The pasta water works great for the sauce.  You just add it in and let it reduce a bit.  Super yummy!!

Very good.  Only change to recipe was that I added some white cooking wine to the chicken, garlic and tomatoes and omitted the hot sauce.  The kids loved it!  Definitely a keeper.

Was a little concerned about making this for my 6 yr old who usually won't eat anything with tomatoes or onions but she ate it and loved it! Was pretty simple, but I think next time I'm going to try and use canned diced tomatoes to save on time.

Would give it a 10!!  One of my favorite meals...seasoning was sooooo good!!!!   I cooked 4 chicken breasts in skillet with the olive oil blend....italian seasoning and tony's. When almost done I added onion flakes and garlic powder and onion powder. Added a can of tomatoes with basil, garlic and oregano.  Meant to add extra basil and oregano...next time.  When complete....I added a splash of white wine and poured enough half and half to make a cream sauce...also used 1 cup of parmesan.  Tony's gave it a zing.  Out of this world good!

My whole family loved this dish, but it tasted sort of like Pad Thai. I didn‚Äôt have all the ingredients so I had to make a few substitutions, but it was still delicious. I didn‚Äôt have chicken, so I used some shrimp and tofu. Instead of angel hair pasta I used rice noodles. I didn‚Äôt have basil so I put chopped cilantro on top at the end (because cilantro does not cook well), and I also added some chopped peanuts on top. Instead of tomatoes I used some ketchup and a bit of fish sauce for richer flavor. It was great but I have to admit that this tastes a lot more Asian than any Italian pasta dish I‚Äôve ever had.

This recipe was so good and easy to make. Even my 6 and 7 year old girls loved this recipe and they won't normally eat fresh tomatoes. I would recommend using fresh Roma tomatoes. I also added 3 cloves of garlic and a little extra basil. The whole family loved this one and my husband ate the left overs the next day. Delicious!

We used too many noodles (12oz). The noodle to sauce ratio was not desirable. There is a reason it calls for 8oz haha.

what a nice alternative to spaghetti!  Not complicated and easy to make.  I marinated my chicken with a small lemon for several hours (tenderizes beautifully) then cooked it with 1 garlic clove minced and about 1/4c diced onion. I then prepared as directed adding 1/2 cup mushrooms (didn't need it).  Turned out great!

excellent!!  Makes a nice lite meal.  I made it as recommended with little alterations---added a can of diced tomatoes mixed with diced fresh tomatoes.  I was thinking the fresh basil was going to be a bit overwhelming but it wasn't at all.  I might add more next time.

We enjoyed this....a great way to use leftover chicken. I did add a pinch of crushed red pepper to the oil, garlic, and onion. A cup of crushed tomatoes at the end added more body to the sauce. I also used fresh parsley as I did not have any basil. I would make this again....I have some leftover pork roast, so may try that for another meal.

Very good and easy to make! I wasn't measuring everything and was having fun playing with it so here are the changes I ended up with: I used dried basil and shallot instead of onion (that's just what I had), used canned tomatoes with oregano, parsley and basil and threw them in my chopper first since I don't like large chunks of tomato, I added red pepper flakes, garlic powder, onion powder and a little chicken broth (about 1/4 cup), and last I cooked the chicken right in the sauce (after seasoning it).

this was really good!! also very easy and I used fresh organic ingredients making it pretty healthy. I also marinated my chicken ahead of time in olive oil, fresh basil and some fresh lemon juice (about 1/2 lemon) I also added fresh lemon juice (  from the other 1/2 lemon) to the tomato mixture to give it a litte zest...very good!

It was good but a little dry so I added some shredded mozarella cheese on top. That helped. Overall, it was delicious & will definitely be something I make again.

I left out the hot sauce, which was probably a mistake because it was more aromatic than it was flavorful. I would try this again but add more garlic and maybe marinate the tomatoes in balsamic vinegar for a short time.

I liked this recipe, and my fiance thought it was out of this world!  I used fresh garden basil, and home canned tomatoes, and I added in a few more seasonings to compensate, but other than that I followed the recipe to a T. This is NOT a recipe for people who like sauce-y pastas, fyi!

this is so simple, it's surprising how great it is!  the only thing i changed was i added 2 cloves of garlic instead of only 1.  i used the canned tomatoes & was pleased, but i can only imagine how good it'd be with fresh chopped tomatoes added in summertime!  will definitely make again!

Very easy meal to make.  We used fresh basil but canned tomatoes already seasoned with basil and garlic.  We also used almost a 1/2 cup of chopped basil.  Otherwise, we followed to recipe exactly and thought it was very good.

Really good and not terrible for you! I used 2 chicken breasts and 1 can of Italian style diced tomatos. Added a touch of sugar and a splash of white wine and chicken broth.

Great recipe! My kids like sauce though so this is what I did: Cooked cubed chicken in olive oil & onions until chicken browned.       Added Garlic & a 16oz can of Tomato Paste and cooked for 3 minutes. Then poured in 1 1/2 cans of water (from paste can) and cooked for 5 min.        Then added everything else (including 5 tomatoes chopped & seeded) and cooked another 5-10 minutes.  Even my picky kids loved it.

Not too shabby!  It probably would be better if I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  It's winter here, though, and basil and good tomatoes are not in season.  I substituted a heaping tablespoon of basil for the fresh basil and a 14 1/2 oz. can of diced tomatoes for fresh tomatoes.  I will make it again in the spring or summer when I can get ripe tomatoes and basil from the farmer's market.

Great dish! The only substitute for me was using my own canned crushed tomatoes which were pre-seasoned with garlic, basil and pesto.

Wow. This is so clean, bright, and fresh! I was sort of doubtful heading into it, but I hate jarred sauces and was willing to experiment. I am SO glad I found this recipe. I added a little extra chicken (browned directly in the pan), and only had dried basil (used less as it was dried). When I dumped in the tomatoes and put the cover on, I thought to myself, 'Big hunks of tomato, no liquid. This isn't going to work out...'. But five minutes later I lifted the lid and the tomatoes had melded into sauce! Eureka! It is perfectly seasoned, don't mess with it! It will be even better with homegrown tomatoes. Mmm. I served over wholewheat pasta due to a diet requirement. I don't think the dish suffered. I hardly -ever- make dishes twice, but I know I will make this again. Thank you so much!

Great last-minute dinner idea. I just plugged in chicken and tomatoes, and here was the perfect quick easy recipe. My husband loved it. I used dried basil instead of fresh. Thanks for a great go-to dinner.

I have made this a LOT for my family, plus it's been a huge hit with friends. Variances:  I use 2 cans tomatos instead of real tomatos, tube of basil instead of real basil, and I include mushrooms and black olives.  Delicious!!

I wanted something quick and easy and this really hit the spot.  I didn't have any chicken cooked so just went without it and it was absolutely delicious.  The good thing for me is that you can make as much or as little as you want.  Since I cook for one, this is a great recipe.  I will definitely cook this often.

I love this! It makes for a very light but satisfying meal. I think its essential to use all fresh ingredients to really taste how good this is. Don't forget to use the fresh basil, it really makes the dish. I followed the recipe as is except I used crushed red peppers instead of hot sauce, I also used freshly grated parm. Even my picky hubby loved it. Thanks!

Wonderful recipe! I made this for my in laws after my father in law suffered a stroke and needed to change his eating habits. Everyone loved it. I changed the diced tomatoes to canned tomatoes preseasoned w/ garlic, basil, and oregano, however. Still a wonderful dish! A++!

Can be good but bland if you don't add extra garlic and fresh basil.  I also added mushrooms since it seemed kind of boring without something else in the sauce.

Because of its simplicity - and lack of marinara sauce - I was surprised at how much flavor this had. But this dish did not last long at my house. I didn't have fresh basil so used the dried stuff and it was still very tasty. I also used one can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh ones. I was worried that it might not be enough and we'd have too much chicken and  pasta and not enough tomatoes but that wasn't the case at all. I did add a little bit of sugar as others suggested. Will make this again for sure.

This dish was just ok. I couldn't find any fresh basil so I had to use dried but aside from that I followed the recipe exactly.  I give only 3 stars because I've used fresh basil for other dishes before and I don't think it would have made it much more interesting.  Thumbs up for simplicity though.

This was great! Thanks so much for posting it. I did not have fresh tomatoes, so I used canned tomatoes with garlic. My family loves cheese, so right before serving I added some shredded Asiago/Parmesean cheese.

Delicious. I only added green and red peppers to this. I would have preferred it with more garlic, but I suppose that's not the point of the dish. =) I'll definitely serve this again.

i have probably made this recipe a hundred times.  It is our most favorite and i have never taken the time to write a review.  this is a great recipe.  i have to admit, that i do change some things...depending on what i have at home.  if i want to kick it up a notch i use a couple of cans of rotel tomatoes.  gives it just the right kick.  I always add more red pepper to it and more garlic.  i made this for my mom for her birthday and she just loved it!  she said it was better than she could have imagined it.  also, i never have fresh basil so i use dried and it turns out great!

I enjoyed this dish very much! The only change I made was to add an extra clove of garlic. Since my husband doesn't like angel hair pasta, I will make this again with a different pasta. Thanks for this recipe!

Pretty good!  I loved this recipe.  My dad helped me make this and he went crazy on the Tabasco hot sauce and it worked great! Definetely will be making this again in the future.

My husband loved it and it's so easy to make.  I used red peppers flakes instead of pepper sauce and it was good.  (Just needed a shake or two, though.)

This has become one of my favorite pastas.  I cut the recipe in half for the two of us, browning the cubes of uncooked chicken with the garlic and onions.  I use one can of diced tomatoes with garlic, oregano and basil instead of fresh tomatoes.  I also use dried basil when I don't have the fresh.

This was a good, quick dish that needed just a little tweaking.  I used 1/3 a box of angel hair and canned diced tomatoes as suggested by others.  I drained the tomatoes, but the overall dish was a bit too dry for us, so I will use some of the juice next time. Definitely a "make again" meal.

This recipe was delicious!! My husband loved it!!
Instead of chopping up fresh tomatoes, I bought a can of died tomatoes seasoned with basil and garlic. This will definitely be a family favorite!

I used 1/3 of a package of pasta (feeds the two of us) and the full recipe of sauce. I boiled the chicken and chopped it up before adding to the tomato mixture. I used 2 garlic cloves as well as 1 small onion and added a cube of beef bouillon instead of adding salt. I also used 1 teaspoon of dried basil instead of fresh as I didn't have any. DIVINE! The reason why I am only giving it 4 stars is because of the changes I made. My husband rated it a 10 out of 5 ;-). Thanks for sharing!

What an easy and flavorful recipe!  I made a few changes...but it turned out great.  I love the zip from the hot sauce; it really gave the dish a subtle and interesting kick!
I substituted 2 cans whole peeled tomatoes for fresh tomatoes.  I sliced the tomatoes and used the juice as well to give this dish a touch more sauce.  I also added 4 cloves of garlic.

I marinated the chicken I used in olive oil, minced dried onion, Mrs. Dash italian seasoning mix, and fresh garlic and grilled. I also used a red onion in the recipe and instead of fresh tomatoes, I used a drained can of Rold Gold garlic and onion diced tomatoes. My husband, who IS SO PICKY loved this recipe. Most of the time if I ask him he likes something, he says, "it is okay." But he loved this and told me it was a definate keeper. I thought it was very simple, I have a 9 month old so I need things to be simple!

Wonderful dish Wendy! So simple, yet tasty! Only changes I made were to add more garlic, that's it!  I wasn't so sure about the hot pepper sauce though.  I was positive you didn't mean the mexican version or but I didn't know what other hot sauce there was.  Then I found the Vietnamese garlic chili sauce and added that in and it was delicious, gave it that extra oomph.  You definitely need the chili sauce though, w/o it, it's too bland.  Thanks for sharing, everyone loved it.

My husband and I found this recipe very bland and very dissatisfying.  We found that the amount of basil called for was way too much! Also, it didn't have enough "sauce" and overall needs more "punch" to it. All I could taste was plain cooked noodles, and an overabundance of basil.

I agree with the last rating - not nearly as special/great as the reviews make it sound. I thought it was very, very bland. I may make it again and use a large can of Italian stewed tomatoes and add fresh mushrooms. I haven't decided what spices it needs, but it needs something.

This recipe was really good. My husband really liked it. I used 4 tsp. dried basil instead of fresh and a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh to make it easier and it was still excellent. Great, light flavor.

Love how simple and clean these flavors are!  It‚Äôs a quick, easy meal with a surprising depth of flavor.  I didn‚Äôt have hot sauce per se, but found some siracha in the fridge (is that the same as Tabasco?). It was delicious!

I tried this because I wanted a lighter pasta dish.  It was lighter, but unfortunately, its was also light on flavor.  Did not care for it as is.  IF I every make this again, I will have to doctor it up a lot.

Not spicy enough. Bland tasting. I even used a herb and garlic rotisserie chicken.

I made this recipe as written, except I didn't use any hot pepper sauce.  We really liked it. My favorite thing about this recipe is that it is filling without being heavy. I will definitely make it again.

this recipe was easy to make.. not just light on the budget it was healthy too.. although, instead of using angel hair, i used penne pasta... also, instead of using a lot of olive oil, i used the chicken stock from the chicken breast that i boiled to keep my pasta from drying... it was superb and super tasty.. i love how the basil blends with the rest of the recipes .

I used canned  petite diced tomatoes and also added extra basil and garlic. I will use a different pasta the next time. The angel hair is just too thin.

Only thing I have to say is make the sauce first and let it simmer on low while you cook the angel hair. Also add some oregano if you find it lacks flavor. The sauce gets a perfect thinkness and your angel hair will still be hot and won't stick together.

I was really happy with this recipe. It's a nice light sauce when I like to switch it up sometimes from a traditional rich spaghetti sauce. I didn't have onion or onion powder but I added more garlic and a splash of white wine vinegar, a little of the pasta water, sprinkled in crushed red pepper flake since I didn't have pepper sauce and let it simmer for a good 15 minutes. I served with garlic bread on the side. I will make this again. My family loved it. Thank you!

I prepared as instructed (with the exception of using campellini pasta since I had it on hand, and using cayenne pepper instead of hot sauce). I thought the final product somewhat lacked flavor and was too pasta heavy. I will make again and hopefully correct these shortcomings by using: 1.25 to 1.5 times the chicken called for, 3 cloves garlic, 1 cup onion, and 4 cups finely diced roma tomatoes, and adding 1 teaspoon dried oregano.

I would give this 5 stars, but my family wasn't all that impressed.  I loved it, though.  I definitely think fresh tomatoes made the difference.  I didn't have fresh basil, so I just threw in a bunch of dried.  Still delish.  It made a nice light sauce that gave great flavor to the noodles.

I had so much hope for this dish with all the fresh ingredients. I followed this recipe exactly and it fell short. It had no flavor and was bland. I ate it only because I felt like I had put a lot of hard work in this dish. I have no suggestions for improvements. I will just simply never make this again.

This recipe is my new favorite! I used 1 can of HUNT's diced tomatoes that were seasoned. I omitted the hot sauce, and used chicken broth to simmer. I cook for just myself, so I cut this recipe in half. I used about half a cup of broth, and used a teaspoon-tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken up the liquid. This recipe is amazing! The fresh basil really made the dish. Next time, I will add veggies.

Followed recipe to a T, I thought is was dry, hubby thought it was ok. Will try it again but add chicken broth or white wine. Not sure if this will help but will give it a try.

My family loves this dish. I've made it with canned tomatoes, and dried basil, and have found that it tastes better if you use fresh tomatoes and basil, but that's just a personal preference. The flavors are great together.

Fantastic!  I couldn't believe the awesome flavor of this dish.  It is very easy to make, not time- consuming, and the combination of ingredients make the dish just right.  If you don't have fresh basil on hand, you can always use dried basil leaves (which was what I ended up using), as they created a wonderful aroma and flavor.  I will definitely be repeating this recipe.

My family and I enjoyed this dish. It had nice flavors and was a lighter dish, which is something we value. I did increase the amount of tomatoes and garlic when I made the dish, and I added a bit of water during the last 5 minutes of cooking just to make it a bit juicier for the pasta. I'm contemplating adding zucchini to this dish in the summer for an added kick.

Very tasty and healthy! We used Tofu Shiratake  noodles (20 cal. .5 fat per serving!).. I tweaked it a little to add more flavor since the noodles can be a bit bland.

1st, marinated the chicken over night in Olive oil, basil, garlic, & seasonings to taste.

2nd, Used one large fresh tomato chopped and used a half can of petite diced tomatoes. 

3rd, In the last few minutes of cooking, I added the Shiratake Tofu noodles to absorb some flavor.

Turned out great! My fiance couldn't even tell there were tofu noodles involved!

Wow!  This recipe was amazing and so simple!   The basil and tomatoe is the best combination...of course the garlic and onion was such a nice complement.  I added about 1 T. of heavy cream just to make it more juicy.  Love this recipe!

This is easy and good. I don't measure anything but it's safe to say I didn't use enough tomatoes... I also took the advice of a recent rating and added chicken broth (about 1/2 cup) to make it more moist.

This was so yummy! I used ground turkey instead of chicken. I also used canned tomatoes and dried basil, since I did not have fresh of either. 
Will make again!

I made this recipe according to the instructions and it was very nice! I can't imagine using dried basil for this recipe or canned tomatoes, as it would really take away from the beauty of this dish-it's freshness.  I did have a little trouble mixing everything evenly into the angelhair. Next time I will probably use bowties or just put the chicken mixture on top of the angelhair. I served it with good crusty olive bread and hubby was enthusiastic. Will definitely make it again.

I really liked this recipe... did however follow other's suggestions. Used red wine and chicken broth to help get a suce/moisure. On it's own I think it would have been a little dry. Will be making this again for sure!

Good basic recipe that is outstanding with a few tweaks...

I doubled the ingredients and made a big batch as I like to eat it all week long.  For the doubled batch, I use 4 large chicken breasts(about 2 pounds worth) that I grill with Italian Seasoning.  I double, if not triple the garlic.  Fresh ingredients are key.  Fresh tomatoes, fresh garlic, fresh basil, fresh parmesan make this dish killer!

My "secret" is to add a diced red bell pepper and about half a pound of white mushrooms to the sauce.

When making the sauce, I add a healthy splash of red wine to the mixture and cook for an additional 3-5 minutes to make it slightly more "saucy" and let the tomatoes become very tender.

Plate and top with a shower of fresh parmesan... DELICIOUS!

We found this to be a bit bland. It wasn't great but it wasn't terrible either. Hence, the three star rating. I like that the recipe was quick and easy but not one that I would make again.

This recipe was yummy! I had fresh tomatoes on hand but I preferred to use a can of diced basil and jalapeno tomatoes mixed with half a fresh tomato diced. I definitely recommend using can diced tomatoes with the spices already mixed because it gives it soooo much more flavor. Also I HIGHLY recommend that you cook the angel hair pasta while the tomatoes and chicken are simmering so the noodles aren't dry and stick together when you add them.

This is by far my favorite pasta recipe!!  I follow the recipe exactly as written, but I have made it with and without the chicken and it's fabulous either way.  It is so light yet very flavorful.  If I make enough, I will take leftovers to work every day until it's gone!

Delicious! I love the balance of flavor and 'light' feel it has. My only suggestion would be to add more onions (if you like them), 3 cloves of garlic and marinate the chicken before cooking. Other than that, my husband and I loved it!!

Very nice recipe. Takes a lot of time the first time you make it, if you make it according to recipe. The second time I made this, I used canned diced tomatoes that were garlic/basil seasoned.   I prefer whole wheat pasta, which my family does not. But when you make whole wheat angel hair you really can't tell the difference between wheat and regular. If you are looking for a way to sneak in some whole grains try the whole wheat angel hair.

Flavorful, but very light!  Great for summer and so simple.  I cooked my chicken first and then used the same saute pan for the rest of the recipe.  It's a one-dish-wonder (plus a pot to boil pasta)!  I used grape tomatoes and added a can of diced tomatoes as well, for the extra juice.  Worked perfectly.  I left out the hot sauce because I wasn't in the mood for something spicy.  Next time I'll add that too or some red pepper flakes.

I honestly don't like any tomato based pasta sauce, but this one changed my mind completely. I suggest to use Roma tomatoes and don't cover the sauce with the lid as it tends to make for a more watery finish. But the flavor is out of this world. Note: I used 100% whole wheat pasta.

Great recipe.  We used Penne so my 2 year old could feed himself the pasta.  We will probably cut back the basil next time but this was incredible!

This was great. I added black olives which complemented the other ingredients very nicely. Kick it up a notch with red pepper flakes to taste. I did use fresh tomatoes and but only had dried basil.

This recipe was really good. I did use frozen basil, and I took the advice of previous reviewers, and used a can of basil/oregano flavored diced tomatoes. I also served my portion first, then added chili pepper flakes and some hot sauce to my boyfriends portion. The only other change I made was adding a LOT more garlic!

Alright, so I am going to start off by saying that I messed up on this. I made too much pasta (I used a 16 oz. box on accident. Good thing I didn't do the box and a half it called for.) and I chopped the onions too finely in an electric chopper. I almost put an entire bulb of garlic into the dish too, good thing Karen was there to stop me. A couple of things that I wish I would have done for this recipe. I wish I would have heated up the pan before I put the oil in there to start saut√©ing the onions. I wish I would have started chopping everything a little earlier. Instead of 15 minute prep time, I would have given myself 30 - 40 minutes. But I am by no means an experienced cook. So people who actually know how to chop things can give themselves less time. Lastly, I would have made sure the tomatoes were a little fresher. Ours were a little mushy by the time everything was finished.  Some things we are considering doing the next time include adding a bit more hot sauce to give it a little kick and not tossing it all together so the chicken and tomatoes don't go all to the bottom. That way everyone get some as opposed to digging in the bottom to get the chicken out. Overall this was a really good recipe. Everyone at the dinner table loved it, including myself. If I wouldn't have had so much to eat at lunch, I definitely would have put a second helping on my plate.

I've been making this for years. It's one of my 'what's in fridge' recipes since I throw in more vegetables to the sauce. I like adding a chopped yellow squash/ zucchini, leftover mushrooms/bell pepper, grape tomatoes or whatever is handy to make it healthier. Will also replace chicken with turkey Italian sausage. This is a good basic recipe by itself but you can make it your own by adding wine, more garlic, whatever you have on hand/like. It's a keeper--quick, easy and tasty.

I added chicken broth like one user recommended, but that made it a little watery... I also topped it with fresh parsley since I had no basil in the house, which is also good, but next time I make it I'm going to make sure to have basil and will also add extra hot pepper sauce!  Overall, it was delicious, just be careful about overcooking the pre-cooked chicken!

Used two cans of diced tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes and drained one of them. Whole fam loved it and got seconds. I think it could use a bit more flavor but overall, really yummy.

Tried this for the first time last night. Didn't have any fresh tomatoes however, did have Alymer's Diced tomatoes (w/Italian spices). I used two (2) 540mL cans and let it simmer to reduce the amount of liquid. Crushed 4 cloves of fresh garlic and finely diced my onions. Turned out fantastic. Mother-In-Law really liked it and she's picky. Chalk up another recipe that will be made many times over. Didn't have any Angel Hair pasta so, substituted with spaghattini noodles. Worked out just as well.

this was a very good base recipe and I can see all kinds of possibilities with this.  I just thought it needed way more garlic and next time I will increase the cloves to 3 or maybe 4.  Thanks for sharing.

Delicious!  I'm always looking for ways to stretch chicken, and I've found that chunking it and then throwing it over pasta is a good way to do that.  This recipe is so easy and so yummy, everybody in my family loved it.  I did use 2 cans of Italian seasoned diced tomatoes, semi-draining both.  I also added a dash or two of red pepper flakes.  Served with a salad and we had a yummy, healthy meal that the whole family enjoyed.  Thanks for sharing!

Four stars because it missing something. We doubled the garlic but still wasn't enough. I think salt is the missing "something" but who needs more of that? My husband, daughter, and I enjoyed. The picky eaters were not impressed.

I too used canned diced tomatoes and crushed red pepper for heat.  This was easy, quick and tasty.  The next day, I stretched the sauce by adding a can of artichokes and some sliced black olives !  EVEN BETTER !!  Will definitely make again...especially when my tomatoes ripen in my garden.

okay so i made a lot of changes but i'm still going to review as i'm sure the original way is equally delicious. I omitted the hot pepper sauce and the cheese (didnt have either on hand). Also doubled the salt and tripled the garlic and made sure to use fresh basil. Came out SOOOOO good! I was worried that it wouldnt be saucy enough as I like my pasta drenched in sauce usually... but it was a perfect flavor balance. Thanks Wendy!

We ate this pasta up and wanted MORE, so next time I think I will triple it and that way we will have left overs. I LOVED it, all the flavors were so good. I can't wait to make it again!

Very good! This was really light and refreshing. The only change I made was to omit the onions. We enjoyed it, thank you! :)

This is a wonderful recipe! Everyone I've made it for loves it. Very easy, you can even use canned tomatoes if you are out of fresh. Both taste good but fresh are of course a little better! This recipe is very forgiving too! Try it and you will be glad you did. we make it once a week now. :)

Make sure to use the recommended amount of tomato; 1 tomato for 2 servings isn't enough.

Wow; this was amazing! I added 4 oz fresh sliced mushrooms, and added extra of some ingredients: 1 whole onion, 3 cups sliced roma tomatoes, a whole package of basil, 2 tablespoons of minced garlic and 3 small chicken breasts. It's hard to believe such a healthy dish can taste so good!

Very yummy but I did make a few alterations because of some of the reviews I read.  I cooked the chicken in a little olive oil and added dried basil and italian seasoning to the chicken.  Used 1 can of basil diced tomatoes, 1 fresh tomatoe, dried basel and more italian seasoning to the sauce, next time I might try 2 cans of the tomatoes. The sauce was amazing but the noodles were very bland so as I was packing up the leftovers I added a little olive oil and a little vegetable oil along with more basil, italian seasoning and garlic salt to the noodles. We took the leftovers to lunch the next day and it was so good.  Will make this recipe often.  Thanks for sharing !!

WOW!  This was EXCELLENT!  I did use more garlic and canned tomatoes with about a 1/4 cup of brown sugar to cut the tomatoey taste a bit.  This tastes just like something I would have ordered from a restaurant...but now I don't have to pay the $12 or so for this dish...YAY!

I cheated (like some other reviewers) and used 2 cans of garlic, basil and oregano tomatoes, drained.  I added sauteed zucchini (thinly sliced) while the chicken finished cooking, and added a splash of EVOO at the end to add some depth to the flavor.  This was amazingly simple, light, healthy, and fast.  This one will definitely be added to the rotation in our house.

Wow, this dish was VERY tasty!!  I will play around with it, only because I think it was a little heavy on the noodles (but I think I put in more than the recipe called for, so it was my bad).  The taste was wonderful, but I might try using canned tomatoes instead of fresh, simply to make it a little less dry.  Other than that, this dish really is quite delicious AS IS.  I will make it again and again.  P.S.  I just remembered I used one tsp. of onion powder in place of the onion, just for a matter of preference.  It was perfect!

Very good and easy. My husband won't eat chopped tomatoes in food, so I made this without them. I'm sure it is much better with, but even leaving them out, it was good. I've made this several times.

My 4 year old had seconds!  Wow!!  Okay, so I didn't have fresh tomatoes, but used 1 can of Italian style diced and one can of tomato sauce, since I read somewhere that the sauce was thin.  I don't like onions, so that was out and doubled the garlic.  My fresh basil went bad :( so I used dried, and while I cooked the cubed chicken I used basil and oregano.  I didn't have hot sauce and used red pepper flakes, like everyone else!  And added white wine.  I let the sauce reduce to thicken it and it was awesome!  I couldn't even mess it up by missing some ingredients! :)

my children and I loved this recipe, but did alter a little after reading reviews. used rigatoni,instead of angel hair pasta.added one can of diced tomatoes with garlic and the rest fresh tomatoes, which i blanched and peeled before adding. I added about a 1/4 cup of red wine and around a tsp of spicy pesto. also added oregano and doubled the garlic. added fresh basil the last five minutes to enhance flavor. will definately make again!

Excellent recipe!  A few suggestions:
1.  Use a short pasta - ziti, penne, rigatoni, etc.  The sauce is thin and slides ride off the angel hair so you have several bites of either just pasta or just sauce.  With the shorter pasta you get both in one bite.
2.  Top with more fresh basil (or sage or oregano or all three)
3.  Double the garlic

This was AMAZING. My fiance LOVED IT. I left out the hot petter sauce because we're not huge on spicy food. I also added a 1.5 tsp of sugar and 1 tsp of balsamic vinegar to deglaze the pan after sauteing the onions and garlic. I find that tomato skins kind of get in the way and get stuck in your teeth so I stick my tomatoes in boiling water for 40 seconds and then dunk them in ice water and the sin comes right off and you get lovely lush tomatoes. Don't be afraid to use more basil! 

One thing I didn't like about this recipe was that it calls for the basil to be put in very early on in the cooking which really kills the flavor of the basil. Put it in at the last minute and you'll notice a stark difference and a huge burst of flavor.

This is a very good recipe.  I didn't have any fresh basil, so I used about 1 1/2 teaspoons of dried basil.  Aside from that, I followed the recipe exactly.  It was very tasty, however, it is important to remember that this is a LIGHT recipe.  If you are expecting it to somewhat resemble pasta covered in sauce, this isn't for you.  However, if you are looking for something lighter (more Mediterranean style) then you will love this. =)

Okay... I used all fresh ingredients, but we found the dish a bit bland.  If I try it again I'll double the garlic, onions and basil to add more flavor.  A good starting point, but just okay as is.

I used canned tomatoes and only a shake or two of garlic because I'm allergic to it. This still turned out great! I'll definitely make it again.

Excellent recipe, but I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I did make changes based on the suggestions of previous reviewers: 1. Instead of the chopped tomatoes, I used 2 cans of Del Monte Diced Tomatoes w/ basil, garlic & oregano flavor. 2. I used a basil paste (sold in small tubes in the tofu section) because that was all I had at home. 3. Omitted the hot pepper sauce as my family does not like anything spicy. 4. Added 3 oz. (1/2 can) tomato paste to thicken the sauce. 5. Added 1/2 teaspoon sugar. 6. Added a splash of white wine to the onion and garlic saute. Great base recipe that you can add or remove ingredients to suit your taste. Will definitely make again!

Wonderful recipe. Quick and easy - one of those things people think you've spent a lot of time on! I've made this a number of times and typically use canned petite diced tomatoes, and definitely fresh basil.  When I don't have cooked chicken breast on hand, I'll cube my chicken, saut√© it in a little EVOO and garlic, then add the tomato and basil to the pan. Great dish to thro together after work, serve with a salad and crusty bread.

Very good!  I used canned chopped tomatoes with onions and garlic, undrained, and an 8-oz can of tomato sauce, as recommended by other reviewers.  I used one cube of Trader Joe's frozen minced garlic and six cubes of frozen chopped basil.  

We really liked this and will make it again!

Light pasta dish.However,it does need some spicing up and it was a little dry. Next time I'll try canned tomatoes, adding more Italian spice and will stir fry the chicken the onion and garlic.

I thought this was simply amazing.  After reading other reviews, I added an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce and some tomato paste, and it was absolutely yummy and easy!  I also cooked the chicken with the onions and added the garlic only in the last few minutes of cooking the chicken adn onions.

I'm only giving this a 4 star because I changed it up a bit! I was looking for something to use with leftover turkey. I did use tomatoes, and I added a can of tomatoe paste. I had to add a little sugar because it was acidy with the paste. The hubby, and I liked it with turkey! So if anyones looking to get rid of turkey, try this recipe! I will make it again with chix though.

This was delicious!  Used others advice, and used 2 cans Italian style stewed tomatoes instead of fresh; and extra garlic, Italian seasoning, and fresh basil is a must! Love the spicy kick!

I didn't find this bland at all, but I did make some changes...Used a large can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh, sprinkled chicken breasts with garlic powder, salt and pepper and cooked on the grill; added another clove of garlic and some garlic powder to the "sauce" and used crushed red pepper instead of hot sauce. It turned out great!! Next time I may add some shrimp as well.

This was really good.  I liked the lightness of the fresh ingredients with the spicy kick from the pepper sauce.  I added a little parsley to brighten up the flavor of the basil, and a can of tomato sauce (suggested from other reviewers) to make it a little more "saucy" and not so thin.  Delicious.  My husband loved it, and my picky father-in-law went back for seconds... and thirds!

i made this tonight and it was great! the basil gives it a great flavor and the recipe as a whole is pretty diet friendly (aside from the carb loaded pasta) i love tomato cream and alfredo sauces, but was looking for something a lil less heavy and this totally hit the spot! :) i used canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes to save money and i don't think you couldn't tell the difference :)

This was a great light dinner.  I didn't know how it was going to turn out, so I put my husband on standby while I sampled it, and it was better than I thought it was going to be.  I was afraid by the smell while it was simmering that the basil was going to be overwhelming, but it was just right.  I think if it had had more sauce it would have been too much like spaghetti for me to want to make it again.  I liked it the way it was.

Excellent.  I cut it in half for just the two of us... but put in a little more tomato than the recipe called for and a little more hot sauce.  I will make this again and again... it's so fast and easy.

It tasted good without the noodles but I felt there wasn't enough sauce with the pasta. I'm going to add some tomatoe puree to my leftovers. Very good flavors.

Pretty darned tasty, and a great way to thin out my basil plant since I need to double the recipie for my family.  Only criticism was that the sauce was a bit watery.  Next time I'll drain half the tomatoes before I cook them, to keep it from being quite to runny.  It would taste really good with either capers or kalamata olives added, too.

This is a good recipe. I followed the advice of others and used canned tomatoes. I also added more garlic. The only problem I found was that there was way too much pasta. The sauce was really good but mixed with that amount of pasta, its gets lost. Next time I will cut the pasta amount in half. The good thing about this recipe is wether or not you like lots of sauce or not, you just adjust to your liking. The sauce is really great. Thanks for the recipe! I will definately make it again.

Very Bland, not enough sauce, I was also very worried about the hot sauce without anything to balance it out, but I couldn't taste it. Will not be making this again.

This was a nice, light pasta dish. I really liked it but my fiance said it was just ok - not enough meat for him. A great summer dish, will make again.

Very classic summer fare! Light & delicious with our fresh tomatos & basil, but I would add a little more basil than called for. Very good re-warmed the next day too!

I found this recipe to be extremely blah.  THe chicken soaked up any sauce and it just needed something more.  Perhaps just a red sauce, but then you might as well make a different dish.

This was ok, but that's about it.  Taking the advice of others I added canned tomatoes, more garlic, sauteed mushrooms, crushed red pepper and non-fat sour cream.  Next time (if there is one) I will increase the sauce and decrease the amount of pasta.

Like others, I wasn't totally wowed by this recipe. I added kalamata olives and a little white wine but otherwise followed the recipe. I'll make it again because it wasn't bad for us and it was good, but it wasn't the fantasticallest recipe ever. Very good, but not great.

This was fabulous! I used fresh tomatoes which makes all the difference. The first time I made it I didn't have any chicken, but the dish was still filling and flavorful. I HIGHLY recommend this dish.

I didn't find this to be a bad dish by any means, but it was also not as special and the numerous reviews seemed to indicate.  I used all fresh ingredients and did not add anything additional.  I think it could have used more garlic, more moisture, more zip.  My child refused to eat this.  If you read over the reviews for this dish, you may notice that many of those who especially loved this dish either added some additional ingredients or used canned tomatoes.

Great recipe!  Really enjoyed the FRESH tomato basil, garlic sauce.  I grilled the chicken on a grill pan, sliced it and served it over the spagetti, and the sauce. I did not mix the grilled/cooked chicken into the sauce.  Kept it separate. Lastly, sprinkle with parmesean cheese and garnished with fresh basil leaves.  Just like the pasta you get at a very fancy  Italian Restaurant.

This was great and so simple and fast.  I decided to make it and 15 minutes later we were eating.  I had chicken leftover from last nite.I made extra sauce and used a can of Italian style diced tomatoes along with the plain ones.  I will definetly make this again as everyone loved it.

I have to apologize - this is not exactly what the original chef came up with. I definitely made changes - based on what was in the cupboard. I didn't have any tomatoes or the pepper sauce so I used one 14.5 oz. can of Diced Tomatoes with Basil, Garlic, and Oregano, one regular can of Diced Tomatoes, and the kicker - one can of Rotel with Diced Tomatoes with Habaneros.  Awesome flavor and heat.  Recommend you drain most of the juice out of the cans or it will be pretty juicy but it was very good.  I did use everything else as directed.  Again - sorry different but darn tasty!

I liked this recipe, but didn‚Äôt love it. It had some good clean flavors; it just wasn‚Äôt bursting with flavor like I hoped. The pasta was plain. Next time I may toss it in garlic powder. This will serve as a good base to create my own meal.

Everyone at my house ate this just fine but I thought this needed more to make it a four or five star...seasonings just needed to be taken up a notch.  I did use fresh basil and also used stewed tomatoes with their juice and that seemed to work well and give enough juice.

My family enjoyed this dish. I used 4 raw chicken breast cut up in chunks, cooked them with 1 chopped onion, 2 rounded tbsp of minced garlic, dried basil, salt, pepper and a dash of red pepper flakes. Once the chicken was almost fully cooked I then added the tomatoes. I used 2 fresh and 1 can of diced because I didn't have enough fresh on hand. I let it simmer together a few min until chicken fully cooked. I served it with penne and topped with shredded parmesan...yum

This recipe was really good.  It is really quick to throw together and has a light fresh taste. I did find that they had a bit much pasta for my taste so I would advise a little less pasta or maybe doubling sauce ingredients.

Great for summer. I used leftover chicken, fresh tomatoes and basil from my garden. Used extra basil and garlic  and added some chopped green and red pepper in the saute  as well. Served it over spaghetti squash. A keeper for sure in my summer dinner rotation.

I made this according to the recipe but used three cups of fresh tomatoes on the vine and 3 cups of thawed shredded chicken breast  I had cooked and frozen.  I took others advice and added one cup of white wine and one cup of lower sodium chicken broth then simmered about 15 minutes.  I served it on top of angel hair pasta and spooned the extra juice over it.  My husband loved it!!

Honestly, I've been making a similar recipe since back in the 1980's (yikes -- dating myself, here), reminiscent of California Pizza Kitchen (where it is no longer on the menu), and have been making it ever since then, just guessing on ingredients and throwing it all together.  But this is the first recipe I've seen that actually has a recipe, measures out the ingredients, and pretty much guarantees that it will always come out about the same whenever you make it.  I love the mix of ingredients in this recipe, and the chicken really tops it off.  True family fare, and great "comfort food," too.  

I'll add that I no longer buy commercial-brand pasta sauce, because this is my FAVORITE, and when I want angel hair pasta, this is what I want.

I've made this with both parboiled fresh tomatoes and also by simply opening a can of diced tomatoes, due to time constraints, and also with and without mushrooms, fresh or canned (yum!).

Anyway, this is super quick as either a side or a main dish, and I highly recommend it!

Veery good and will make it again, It needed a little extra drizzled olive oli to keep chicken from being too dry.  I added sundried tomatoes along with ttalian, no-salt seasonomg for extra zing.

Lovely! This a perfect basic dish to which you can add many different ingredients. I used 2 cans of basil, garlic tomatoes AND fresh vine ripened tomatoes. I added minced garlic from a jar and Italian spices. I served it over a pure vegetable pasta, the kind from a box, and set out freshly shredded mozzarella for topping. It was delicious!

Great with a lot of changes, first, used a whole onion, 2 large garlic cloves, 1 tsp of Italian seasoning, 1tsp of red pepper flakes, 1cup white wine, and handful of chopped green onions.  Let simmer 20 minutes with the tomatoes, chicken and basil. And I did not add the pasta to the pan, but placed the pasta on plates and scooped the chicken mix over it, then sprinkled with grated Parmesan cheese. Outstanding and super easy.

I bought several roma tomatoes a few days ago because they were such an amazing price. Had no idea what I was going to use them for. Then this recipe showed up in my email today, so I made tonight since I had all the other ingredients, too. Hubby and I loved it!  I upped the garlic to 4 cloves, chopped up some bell pepper, and threw in some chopped zucchini at the end. Also, fresh black pepper and finished with shredded mozzarella in addition to the Parm.  My pasta of choice was thin spaghetti vs angel hair.  This is definitely a keeper.

Good simple pasta dish. Angel hair cooks up easily using the skillet method. I found the final result to be a bit dry and lacking in flavor. I'll use some marinara sauce or some canned tomatoes with juices next time instead of fresh roma tomatoes. Also needs more basil if you want the herb flavor to stand out. Mostly I taste the heat of the hot sauce.

This is a great recipe! I used two cans of diced tomatoes with basil and oregano instead of fresh tomatoes. Be sure to let it simmer for at least 5-8 minutes to let it reduce so there is enough liquid to coat the noodles

This came out pretty good. I had been looking for a chili spaghetti sauce and this one worked for me. The beer blended very well with the other ingredients. Yum Yum.

This recipe is amazing!! The only thing I add is artichokes (marinated from the jar) and it pushes this recipe in to the awesome category.  If made as written, it would be great....but I add artichokes because I love them.  I make this about twice a month during my pasta dish rotations!

I used home grown tomatoes and basil plus chicken marinated in Italian dressing and it was delicious.  Of course, parmesan cheese topped it off. I'm addicted.

Having to at least double the ingredients, not having sufficient fresh tomatoes (only 4 cups), no 2  cans diced, no chicken (used 1 can),  it received rave reviews. Definitely use fresh basil and a bit of fresh oregano. Pretty dish.

Everything was good about the ingredients except for the amount of garlic.  I love garlic,  so I doubled the garlic to 2 large cloves. Excellent flavors using fresh  everything.

This really was good, I used fresh tomatoes from the garden and in addition to the pasta, I made a lighter  version by making "pasta" out of green and yellow squash also from the garden. I did use the recipe on this site for pan seared chicken breasts with shallots and also added mushrooms and white wine

I made it by making the sauce first and then cooked the Pasta. You are incorrect to cook pasta and set it aside. Never. Pasta does not do well waiting for the sauce to finish. It is vice versa.

I've not made it yet but do have the ingredients on hand.I always (thank you all) read the reviews beforehand.I do agree with most that it does need a bit more in the way of a sauce.I'll be making it tomorrow and test it on my honey.His Mom,God rest her, lived many years in Italy.Sure looks good though.

I'm a bit critical of food, but in the end, this is one of my favorite recipes I've made. It's great for family dinners and something everyone can enjoy at all sorts of occasions. I didn't add spice on one try and on the next I did, and to be completely honest I preferred it without the pepper sauce, but both ways it's a healthy family dish that I would totally make again.

I made this dish over the weekend and followed the recipe almost to the letter. I read one reviewer's comments who said to cook the chicken in with the onions and garlic to give it more flavor....it did not. The overall flavor was OK, nothing special. I have always used tomato sauce, or tomato paste or diced tomatoes for my sauce, I have never used fresh tomatoes. I even went and  bought fresh Roma tomatoes, but that did not help boost the flavor at all. I did cube the chicken, but it just seemed tough. I probably will not make this again and that's too bad because the picture looks very appetizing!

Tasty!  I followed the recipe for the chicken sauce and let it simmer while the pasta cooked.  No angel hair so I substituted bow tie.  Quick, healthy, hubby approved...it doesn't get much better than that.  Well, it would have been better if  had used actual fresh tomatoes instead of the on-the-vine that I picked up at Kroger.  This is for sure a recipe that I will be making when the tomatoes come in!

I didn't have fresh basil, so I soaked dried basil in the olive oil that I heated in the pan. I added a little more with the tomatoes. I used fresh tomatoes that were still on the vine. I also added a little bit of stevia to balance out the acidity of the tomatoes.

This is a family favorite although we make a few additions.  First of all, the cook time for angel hair is WAY WAY too long.  Cooking angel hair 8-10 minutes will turn it to mush.  5-6 minutes tops.  I also add some white wine, capers and oregano to it.

I love this recipe and I've made it twice. I always bump up the fresh basil and curry. Another awesome product I use is Garam Masala from Penseys Spices. Adds a sweet and spicy kick to it. My son suggested serving it on cheese tortellini , and it was to die for.
 I also reduced the liquids through cooking, I also saut√©ed the chicken from raw instead of using precooked. This is one of my favorite recipes.

This was very good. Only changes was to use canned tomatoes (w/the juice), doubled the garlic, used extra onions, used dried basil (that's all we had). Also used ground cayenne pepper instead of pepper sauce as that's what we had. Will make this again but will grill or cook chicken in the olive oil with the onions before adding the rest of the ingredients. Love how this is a light spaghetti instead of using heavy spaghetti sauce. A good tip is to use shredded Parmesan instead of grated (parmesan dust lol). It just tastes a lot better.

This was a big hit with my family! I did use a large can ofind diced tomatoes versus fresh but the tomatoes were not seasoned. Plus I added some extra garlic. Definitely a repeat meal!

This was fresh, tasty and easy. I did make a few additions. Like other posters I added a can of diced tomatoes plus the fresh tomatoes. I also added Italiano Seasoning, various white cheeses and spinach. I also sauted fresh chicken rather than use cooked. This was a big hit!! Will make it again for sure!!

I let it cook for a while. And didn't add the chicken until later.

This was so good!!! I have made this a couple times actually. The first time I followed the recipe as directed. The second time I didn't have anymore fresh basil so I used pesto in its place. This was also amazing! It's not as light but I thought it worked well in a pinch. The key to this recipe is FRESH Roma tomatoes. They hold up very well. I added them at the end of cooking because I like my veggies to be kinda firm. Thanks for sharing!

Quickly became a family favourite, but agree with other reviewers that it's dry. Using canned tomatoes and some of the pasta liquid is quite nice.  I also add Italian seasoning to taste.

Simple recipe is a nice alternative to pasta sauce. I would make it again. 
In addition to fresh tomatoes, I added chili stewed tomatoes since I didn't have hot sauce.

This pasta meal is not supposed to be swimming in a sauce.  The true flavor comes from fresh basil and tomatoes. Letting it simmer before before adding the chicken helps the flavor.  I would use canned Roma crushed tomatoes and that will make sauce thicker also. I've made the same recipe before using turkey meatballs. I also cut the basil in long thin strips. It enhances the flavor of the basil.

Yummy but missing some  "depth" - added julienned zucchini and carrots with extra fresh basil and tomato pesto. Great way to stretch 2 chicken breasts into dinner for 5 ;) Will make again . . .

I thought it was fantastic, although I added a half cup of white wine while making it.

This was great, though I had to do this differently, as I did not have angel hair pasta, nor fresh basil.  Also we love garlic so used a lot more!!!  I used dried powder basil and added some oregano just because!  Also to avoid making it too watery which some people commented here, I added about 3 tbls of tomato sauce and when I cut my tomatoes, did not use the seeds.   I served it with egg noodles, and it was a huge success with my family.

It was just ok. I added kalamata olives which boosted the flavor, but I thought it needed something more. The sauce was a little watery.

It had great flavor, but it was wanting for sauce. I made it as the recipe described but over spinach spaghetti. Next time I think I will make a sauce by blending an extra tomato and leaving the rest diced.

I didn't use the hot pepper sauce, because i quite frankly didn't know what it was. This dish is very good for a family. It has a nice fresh taste.

We did like it but the sauce didn't thicken enough for us. Will try again and I did use to many noodles. I cooked the chicken and then added garlic and onions to the chicken and sauted them.

A go to recipe for me! My mom use to make something like this & we cannot find the recipe & this is just as perfect. ADD WHITE WINE TO SAUCE & IT IS EVEN MORE PERFECT. Also, if you need a quick fix I use the Perdue Short Cut oven roasted chicken!

I thought this dish was delicious! I did throw in a couple of things extra just because I had them on has and thought they would work! First was anchovies, yea I know it ain't for everybody, but for me they were a great addition! I minced 2 filets and added them about 5 mins after adding the tomatoes(which I also let saut√© an extra 5mins or so) just to give a kick of saltiness to the dish without using the actual thing.. And 2nd I added a splash a dry vermouth just before adding the parmesan to give mine a little more moisture..... Oh and sorry I probably should've added this as "1st", but I used half Hunts Fire Roasted diced Tomatoes and half fresh Roma!!... I am thoroughly impressed with this recipe without any additions and highly recommend it, not to mention you can make it for a family for under 15$!!!

This is a great recipe. I did a couple of things a little different. I added sliced baby portabella mushrooms sauted with the onion and garlic. The chicken I boiled in a flavored soup base and boiled the penne pasta in the same to add more flavor to both. The whole family loved it.

This was absolutely delicious. I love angle hair pasta but this made it 10 times better. I bought all organic boneless chicken breasts and salted and peppered them before tossing them on the grill. They came out great. I used a sweet onion to give it a better taste. It could use a little more garlic than it originally calls for. Overall though, a very good meal that can be whipped up fairly fast.

I loved this recipie.  I made a few changes based on reviews. I used 4 cloves of garlic, saut√©ed with half an onion. Then cooked the chicken in the garlic & onion. Once cooked I added 1 x 28oz can of diced tomatoes, 1 cup of chicken broth, half a cup of white wine, 1 tsp of red pepper flakes, 1/4 cup of basil, 1/4 cup of oregano. It was amazing.  The sauce had a touch of heat. This one is a keeper

I thought this recipe was okay. I, similar to other reviewers, felt that it was extremely bland, even after adding more salt. It has a very strong tomato flavor, and it kind of overpowers the other ingredients (which may be ideal if you are a tomato lover--I am not). I am willing to try it again, but will add a lot more salt and garlic next time.

I made this today and it was heavenly. I was in a hurry and had no cooked leftover chicken, so I steamed it in a baggie in the microwave. I used whole wheat pasta because it's somewhat healthier and has better "mouth feel" in my opinion. I only used 1 chicken breast for budget reasons and omitted the salt and Parmesan cheese.  The hot pepper sauce negates the need for salt and I didn't have any good Parmesan on hand.

I have never really cooked before outside of spaghetti and other meals, so this is my first meal of the summer I have decided to learn to cook that I tried to create. It was pretty good - I made the pasta before the sauce was prepped and made my noodles extremely soggy. I would also add more chili sauce than recommended - but really good!

I thought it was very good and very fresh! I didn't have fresh tomatoes or basil unfortunately, so I used the generic and canned versions. I also have picky kids so I couldn't add any hot sauce to it (seems like it would be better with it). I also decided to add some rosemary (probably around 1tbsp) and that made it wonderful! Next time I'd only like to add a little more tomato, keep the same amount of rosemary, and add some spice :)

My husband and I liked it very much. The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because my youngest child didn't really enjoy it.

This recipe was AWESOME, the kids even liked it. Thought I was going to have to make more. The only thing I did different was I didn't add the hot pepper sauce. Way to go Wendy, good one!!

This was excellent, even though it was a little on the sour side - I think the marinated artichokes may have been the reason. Next time I make it, I'll make it with plain artichokes.  Very good dish.

What a great dish with a perfect balance of flavors. I made the dish as written except I used canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh and used dried basil instead of fresh. Using a conversion it ended up being 4 tsp. I thought, oh no basil overkill, but it wasn't at all. I also cooked the chicken mixture in the crock pot thinking the flavors would do well with the chicken slow cooked and I was so right! We all loved it and will be making it again and again.

Fantastic dish! I made mine extra healthy by using 100% Whole Grain Pasta and I substituted a half of a jalapeno for the hot sauce. To get a little more juice in the dish I drained about 95% of the water from the pasta and then mixed it all in together. I usually add the Parmesan Cheese directly to the noodles to give it a little more flavor. Excellent recipe! Will be a frequent for us!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was wonderful! I seasoned it to my taste ignoring the spices the recipe called for. I chopped up a clove of garlic, 4 Roma tomatoes, a red onion, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, and one bunch of green onions, saut√©ed all of the above in olive oil and seasoned with garlic salt, a pinch of table salt, Badia Cajun seasoning, crushed red pepper flakes, basil, and a little cayenne. Saut√©ed it until it was soft, then slowly stirred in my wheat linguini pasta I had boiled. I mixed the pasta into the pan so that the pasta could absorb all of the seasonings on the bottom of the saucepan. While that was sitting, I seasoned the chicken breasts separately, this is important so that the chicken will have its own distinct flavor to add to the dish. In a separate pan I sliced yellow onions and saut√©ed them in olive oil seasoned with only garlic salt. Btw I seasoned the chicken with Badia complete seasoning and garlic salt. Once the yellow onions were browning I added the breasts and let them cook on both sides, before removing them from the pan I sliced the breasts into strips and let them cook a minute longer, then I poured the whole contents over the pasta and mixed them up. Fantastic meal! Yes it was a lot of work but worth it in the end. Other reviewers complained about not having enough sauce, the key is to use enough olive oil, it's healthy and coats the pasta well. Steamed some broccoli as a side dish and garlic bread. Yummy.

This recipe is excellent!  Flavorful and healthy.  I added more garlic to the recipe, just because I like garlic, and it turned out well.  Definitely going to add this recipe to my recipe box.

I tried this recipe and did not like it. I found it was a little bland and tasted somewhat bitter. I added tomato sauce to it and increased the parmesan cheese and that made it taste better. I will not make it again and removed it from my saved recipes. Steve

I love this recipe. I adjusted a bit for my tastes, like others, and added sauteed mushrooms. I also sauteed the onions and garlic and then added the chicken to brown before adding the tomatoes and chicken broth to simmer. Next time I'll add black olives and capers. This recipe is very versatile and I love that it doesn't have a sauce. Thank you!

Easy and delicious! And healthy to boot... I had some juice from the pre-cooked breasts I bought at the grocery store. I added that and a splash of white wine. We'll make this again. And again. And again.

I made this for supper and won't try it again untilthe summer time when the tomatoes might have more juice in them . Pretty dry even after I added some tomato juice from a can of tomatoes . I didn't even put as much pasta in as it called for . The taste was good , so that's why I'm goin g to retry it later  .

Very good,  My kids even liked it.  I marinated two chicken breasts in 1 TBSP italian dressing during the day. I used 1 1/2 cans italian tomatoes, draining 1 can of juices, and using the entire other can. Served with garlic bread and salad.

This went over pretty well with the family.  I used grape tomatoes sliced in half so the tomatoes didn't get really limp.  I also used chili flakes rather than the hot pepper sauce.  In these types of dishes that include cooked chicen I have found that poorly prepared chicken can negatively affect the outcome of the dish.  For this one, I cubed the chicken raw and put it in a resealable bag along with about a tablespoon of oil.  Shook the bag to coat the chicken and then poured in a package of McCormick's Sweet Basil & Oregano Bruschetta Chicken seasoning.  Spread it on a baking sheet and cooked at 350 degrees for about 12 minutes. Made the rest of the dish as the recipe indicated.  Will be making this again.

I thought this was yummy. I had on hand dry basil and canned tomatoes, so I used that.  So, now I can't wait to make it with fresh basil and tomatoes!

Very good! Used 2 cans Hunt's diced tomatoes with basil, garlic, oregano with juices. 4 cloves garlic, a large chopped onion and a tablespoon dried basil. Quick, easy and so good.

Very tasty and quick to make. I doubled the basil since our family loves it. I also added about 1/4 cup of white wine. My husband and both kids love this recipe.

Absolutely LOVE this recipe! My husband and 2 yr old love it too! I've made it several times, several different ways. I've used canned tomatoes (drained) and even canned chicken in a pinch. This recipe is so versatile! Definitely going into "my favorites" cook book.

This is a yummy and super easy recipe although I admit I did not follow it exactly. I did not use fresh tomatoes and used 2 cans of basil and oregano diced tomatoes. Based on other reviews, I drained one of the cans of tomatoes but would not drain it next time. Next time I will make it with a 3rd can of tomatoes. I did add some sugar to make the tomatoes less tangy. I cooked the chicken in the garlic and onion but I found it to be bland and will consider making it with no chicken or marinating the chicken.

This dish was okay, but it tasted too bland.  Would probably add more spices to make it a little more tasty.

This is a good recipe but I don't think sauteeing it for only 5mins would be sufficient. The longer it is simmerin', the better it tastes!! I also added some sugar to make the flavor of tomatoes less harsh. Then I breaded and fried the chicken in small pieces in olive oil. I think the oil and the hot pepper sauce help the flavor!!

We liked it.  Hubby, for some strange reason, will not eat chunks of tomato, but he will eat tomato sauce(?) anyway, I used one 8oz can of tomato sauce instead of the chopped tomato.  I also am not a fan of spicy, so I left that out, but put hot sauce on the table.  Hubby loved the spicy and was very happy with the hot sauce.  I didn't love love love it, but it was plenty good!  A solid 4 star.

Delicious and fresh!! We didn't feel like chicken so we added Aidell's garlic/artichoke sausage. I also didn't really have hot sauce on hand so I subbed a splash of white wine. Yummy!!

Used raw chicken legs (salted and peppered, browned quickly with onion and 2 cloves garlic, then added one can italian-style stewed tomatoes, plus a little water poured into the can and then the pot, and plenty of dried basil and the pepper sauce. I simmered it (lid on, then off) for at least 30 minutes, turning chicken a few times. Would be good with chicken broth or white wine. Served over whole wheat angel hair. Made a decent amount of sauce, for just one can of tomatoes. Easy and delicious!

This was a great recipe. I did make a few additions to add more flavor though. I used double the garlic and used a can of Hunt's Fire Roasted diced tomatoes instead of the regular tomatoes. Also, I added a hand full of mozzarella cheese & parmesan cheese just before I took it off the stove. I buttered the noodles (just a bit) before topping with the chicken mixture & it was delish! The family ate it all up! Already added to my recipe box:)

Yum!  I followed the recipe exactly except that I used 2 cans of dice tomato with garlic, basil, and oregano.  I only used half of the juice from the second can and I let the sauce reduce.  I used penne pasta because I hate anything spaghetti shaped and the ridges in the penne hold onto sauce better.  I like the lightness of the sauce but don't worry it is still big on flavor.  I will be making this recipe again and again.

This was so easy and tasty! I added more basil, and also some fresh parsley. Also added some roasted hatch peppers instead of the hot pepper sauce when I was cooking the onions.

I only gave it four stars cause I didn't follow to the letter.  But it still turned out very yummy and we'll see what hubby thinks after work.  But I used can tomatoes because that was what I had on hand and less basil since we are not big on it.  I still liked it.

I'm a newbie cook here, and I managed to make this delicious dish!  Made it for myself, my boyfriend and his mom and we all liked it.  I was worried the chicken might not have enough flavour because there didn't seem to be any real sauce, but I was wrong!  It was very tasty and juicy :)

I have a ton of tomatoes in my garden & this was the perfect recipe to help me use a whole bunch of them before they go bad. It was so simple to make & even my picky eating 19 month old loved it & ate every bite! Definitely a recipe worth saving.

Very disappointed after reading all the positive reviews. This dish was dry and flavorless - after rereading the recipe I should have been alerted - there is basically no liquid to make any kind of sauce for the pasta. Try something else.

I love this dish!  I made a few changes by using shrimp instead of chicken, using a can of diced tomatoes instead of slicing myself, added mushroom and used whole grain pasta to be a little healthier.  I always get rave reviews from hubby when I make it.

With a number of changes I like this, but as is it is only okay.  I do not like onion in this dish, so left it out after the first run.  I add andouille for a kick of flavor and fat (which I am a fan of--for flavor AND nutrition!)  And I (as always) pounded and well seasoned the chicken before cooking it.

I usually try not to review a recipe I deviate too far from, but I used this as a base and came up with something good, so I want to give this recipe credit.  I had left over heavy cream and fresh basil from making "Rich and Creamy Tomato Basil Soup" from this site, so I used this recipe and those ingredients to make a hybrid meal.  I cooked tomatoes, chicken, fresh basil, heavy cream, and a can of chicken broth  then poured it over the angel hair.  With the chicken and the heavy cream the soup/sauce really holds up.  This recipe is a nice change from sauce heavy pastas.

So yummy!! There were no leftovers!  I did add 1 large zucchini chopped. For the sauce I used 2 romano tomatoes diced in large cubes, as well as 1 can (14.5 oz) Hunt's diced tomatoes with basil, garlic, and oregano (drain half of juice before adding). I also mixed in a sprinkle of sugar and used more basil than specified. No salt added - not needed! Very yum, will definitely make again!

This was really good.  I've been looking for a recipe just like this for a while.  I did a few things differently.  I coated my chicken in breadcrumbs and cooked it in with all of the vegetables and seasoning.  I also added a little bit of white wine.  I took the advice of another reviewer and added a tsp. or so of sugar to help with the tomato taste.  I did use a can of diced tomatoes.  I will definitely be making this again.

This makes a lot, but it's very good.   I used canned tomatoes instead of fresh as others had suggested.

This was wonderful! Only thing I did different was cook the cubed raw chicken breast with the sauteed onion and garlic, and added a little tiny bit of sugar. Very very good.  Thank you!=)

Made this for lunch today. Along with the onion & garlic, I sauteed red bell pepper & spinach. Instead of fresh tomatoes, I used diced tomatoes. Everyone loved it. A recipe worth making again. Thanks for sharing!

Very good recipe....  Basic, healthy, easy and yummy.  I made it exactly as the recipe - but at the end I ended up adding some garlic salt and a drizzle of EVOO!

This was absolutely delicious. I made it almost exactly as directed. the only differences were that 1) i used dried oregano from a bottle (i didn't have fresh) 2) I added more garlic 3) added oregano. My husband and i loved it so it will definately become a part of the rotation! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was a great dish. It will be going into my menu box for dinners. I added more veggies, red pepper & asparagus. Plus, we put oil and squeezed lemon into the pasta. To finish we put a dollop of sour cream on top. Very yummy.

I really liked this recipes. I did make a few changes. I used double the amount of garlic. Two cans of diced tomatoes instead of fresh because I didn't have any at the time. I also doubled the amount of hot pepper sauce. I will be making this again.

My fiance mumbled to hold onto this one through a mouthful of pasta. I agree. A very good recipe especially if you don't have a lot of time to prepare, and if you're trying to eat healthy. I did add a lot of crushed garlic, since we love it, and used Frank's Red Hot for the pepper. Delicious.

Seeing that there weren't any ingredients to have any sauce at the end, I added 1/2 cup chicken broth and 1/2 cup white wine to the mix. I omitted the hot pepper sauce from my recipe and it was really delicious! I will make this again.

This recipe was great. I scaled it down for two servings and the only thing I changed was adding a little more pepper sauce that it called for. 1/8 of a teaspoon wouldn't have cut it, so I just added 1/4 and shook a little bit more over the pan after combining the chicken, sauce and pasta.

My entire family and my boyfriend all LOVED this dish-which is really impressive since I come from a family of picky eaters who all have different food preferences. We made it with bow tie pasta because it was what we had on hand. My boyfriend and I made it again but with spaghetti squash-just as delicious and at least twice as healthy! He and I love a lot of spice so we added a bit more hot pepper sauce and some red pepper flakes. Delicious!

Pretty good. I changed it slightly by breading then pan frying the chicken. I also added a dash of white wine at the end and let it cook out.

I didn't have a lot of these ingredients fresh so I used garlic powder, dried basil and omited the hot pepper sauce.  The flavor was really good.  The first night I tried to make this recipe I didn't read it well enough and hadn't cooked the chicken,  This really adds prep time unless you do it ahead of time,  I would have given it 5 stars except there really isn't much of a sauce so the pasta can be a little plain if you don't have a bite of tomato or chicken with it.  Nice healthy dish.

As written it's a good recipe.  I didn't really change anything except to add more garlic and use canned tomatoes instead of fresh.  Like others I like my sauces a little thicker and the canned tomatoes are just too watery on their own.  I added tomato paste to thicken it up.  Also, because I didn't have cooked chicken leftover, I browned chicken in a skillet, took it out and added the onions and garlic and softened them then added the chicken, tomatoes and other ingredients in.  So I essentially made it a one pot dish minus the pasta.  Overall, really good fast meal!

Doubled the basil, garlic, salt and tobasco. I added red wine vinegar and lemon juice. My husband said this is a keeper. Also added fresh spinach and mushrooms. :)

This was really tasty and easy to make! It was just a tiny bit bland, but I added a bit more basil and it solved the problem. Very good!

My whole family LOVES this recipe but I do suggest buying softer tomatoes to get as much tomato juice in the dish as possible or it maybe dry.

Yum! I cooked the chicken in white wine because I was considered it would be a little bland, and it was super flavorful! I also used more basil than called for (I love basil) and sprinkled in a llittle fresh oregano. I used roma tomatoes, which worked well. If making this I would definitely use fresh herbs and tomatoes, because it was the best part! Oh... and serve with a great bread!

This was a very easy and healthy dish, overall the kids enjoyed it as well. I would only have to say that it could have used some more flavor- some kind of salt..was a little bland.

Made this and liked it! It seemed a bit on the bland side for us though... maybe more basil, garlic and hot pepper sauce would have done it. Will try it again sometime. Thanks for the recipe!

This is such a fantastic pasta! I just love that it is healthy, too! I used whole wheat angel hair pasta for additional healthiness, and that worked really well. I used a 14.5oz can of diced tomatoes with basil, garlic, and oregano seasonings. That worked perfectly! I drained half of the juice from the can. The remaining really helped to coat the pasta when I added it to the sauce. Other reviewers said they thought the canned wasn't as good as fresh tomatoes, but I think it would be just as good if not better. Less work, too! I also added canned mushrooms. Served this with salad and garlic toast. I'll definately be making this again and again!!

This was really good and simple! My non cooking husband made it tonight(with a little help)! We used 2 cans of diced tomatoes, drained, and dried basil, since the nearest grocery store is 25 mi away and we didnt have fresh. It was still excellent. Served with Jo's Rosemary Bread from this site and it made the meal! Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious! Extra stars for tasting fresh.  I cooked the chicken by boiling it, but I'll probably prepare it a different way next time, as the chicken was my least favorite part. I used plum tomatoes (pretty much the same thing as roma tomatoes), added a teensy bit more garlic, and added 1/2 cup white wine. Fresh tomatoes make all the difference here - everyone commented on how fresh and healthy this tasted! If I could change anything, I'd make it a little more saucy, so I may chop the tomatoes up a little more next time and add a bit more wine. Other than that, it was perfect.

it was really good. My husband said it smelled great and it tasted great. I got lazy and left out the salt but that was a  big NO NO i had to sprinkle some on once it was on my plate. It is very healthy especially if you use whole wheat/grain pasta.

I used 6 cloves of garlic and ~1 cup of chopped onion. I added 2-3 tablespoons of crushed tomatoes for more body. I did end up having to add a pinch of salt and sugar to balance out all the flavours. The sauce was wonderfully light and fragrant - but the chicken was really bland. Next time, I will marinate the chicken breast in Italian dressing and grill it.  I also thought it could use more fresh basil. A great base recipe and I appreciate how easy it was to modify ingredients to my taste without screwing up the recipe. Thank you :-)

I love this recipe with a few minor tweaks. First of all I use a whole onion and second I use more like 6 cloves of garlic (we love garlic). Third and finally the recipe called for cooked chicken. I cooked my chicken with a little olive oil, pinch of onion, tomato, garlic and Itallian seasoning. Since I cut a whole onion I have plenty to use. This gives GREAT flavor to the whole recipe otherwise you feel like the dish is great but the chicken could have been better.

Good light recipe. I cooked the cubed chicken in a pan with the olive oil and garlic before adding onions. I used six garlic cloves, which gave the chicken a great flavor. I also used more basil than recipe called for. Salt an pepper to taste.

The only thing I changed was to add a little bit more tomato paste...and that was just because I already had an open can in the fridge and wanted to use it up. Otherwise, I followed the recipe...and it came out perfect.  Very tasty.

Very, very good! I didn't have fresh tomatoes, so I used a can of diced tomatoes. Also, I used red pepper flakes instead of the hot sauce it added the perfect little kick. This has been added to my regular recipe rotation!

We really liked this dish! Can't give it a 5 star because I had to tweak it a bit. I used fresh roma tomatoes and added a fresh sweet banana pepper to the onions and garlic. I left out the hot sauce and substituted Nu-salt for the salt (need low sodium dishes). This will be on the "keeper" list!

This recipe was simple and delicious.  I recommend using fresh tomatoes - the flavor can't be beat.  My daughters can be picky eaters but they both loved it and called it a "make again".

My husband and son didn't care for it, but they are quite picky.   I enjoyed the taste and also the fact it was quite healthy.

i found this recipe to be filling.  It had a good taste but the basil chicken is too runny.  Next time I make this dish I will thicken up the sauce with some tomato sauce or tomato paste.

Yum! My husband and I both liked this dish alot. Wish I could give it 4.5 stars. I used two cans of italian seasoned diced tomatoes. I added extra garlic and some oregano. I also let it simmer longer, maybe 20-30 minutes. I will make this again!

My family loved this recipe! I didn't give it 5 stars just cuz I made some changes to it. I doubled the recipe (I wanted left over sauce for another recipe) After reading some reviews, I added some Italian Seasoning and Oregano. I also used 2- 28oz canned tomatoes. I drained the 1st one and put the other in. When I got the sauce done, I noticed it was a bit runny for my taste. So I added a bit of cornstarch to thicken it some. This was fabulous and I plan on adding it to our menu more often. Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't really like this.  It was too bland.  I ended up adding some marinara sauce to make it taste a little better.

Very quick, easy and delicious recipe.  I used a large can of diced tomatoes but drained them first.  I also used crushed red pepper instead of the hot sauce.  Will make again!  Thank you Wendy for a great recipe.

A good recipe. My wife made this tonight. She stayed fairly close to the recipe, but we both agreed that - while delicious - it needed a little "pizazz". I would recommend some fresh ground black pepper, and some fresh oregano. More garlic too. Otherwise, it was really rather good.

I loved this- tasted something like you would get at a fancy Italian restaurant!  I used penne instead of angel hair and sauteed the chicken with the garlic (used 4 cloves instead of 1) and onion. I also used about 3T of tomato paste, and also added some oregano, dry white wine, and spinach for more complex flavor and texture.

I loved this!  I didn't give 5 stars because I modified it, and I hate when ppl give 5 stars on a modified recipe :P--but I used garlic-infused olive oil, 2 cloves of garlic instead of 1, a large can of the basil/garlic/oregano diced tomatoes and crushed red pepper flakes rather than the hot pepper sauce.  But I thought it was great--I love spaghetti but wanted something different and this was just what I was looking for!  Yum!  This will be a regular item in my menu rotation, for sure!  THanks a lot!

SO GOOD! What I did was use leftover chicken that I had made in the crockpot yesterday, so it was already seasoned. I skipped the garlic and onions, and just used garlic powder and onion powder put straight into the olive oil. I used two medium tomatoes and diced them. I also skipped the hot sauce and used hot pepper flakes like someone else suggested. I used Italian Basil from my mom's herb garden. I think the fresh basil made a big difference. It was absolutely wonderful!

As written, not so good and 2 stars.  I made it exactly as shown and there was just no sauce to mix with the pasta.  It was vegetables and chicken on top of some dry pasta.    The next day we had left overs and I added a tablespoon of ranch dressing per serving and it helps a lot.  With ranch, 3 stars.

This was wonderful. I did use a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh b/c that was what i had on hand. I forgot to put parmesan cheese on it though. I will do that next time. I did find that it was too salty though. Next time I will add less but maybe I had a moment and just measured wrong. Who knows. I did add 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 tea of sugar because I found it to be a little to tart. Thanks for the great recipe. I will definitely cook this again .

Healthy, and delicious! If your family likes more sauce, add a can of diced or stewed tomatoes in place of fresh. Add some extra dried basil for a little extra flavor, but really, it's great how it is!

Great recipe came out perfect even though i had to use whole wheat. Had no fresh basil so had to use dry. Changed it a bit by sauteing the chicken in butter with dry pepper seed, salt, basil and black pepper for about 7min. Then adding everything else, wow.

when i was halfway through making the sauce, i realized i did not have any fresh tomatoes. i used V-8 tomato juice, though, & it still worked! it was watery, but it wasn't bad, and the pasta & sauce weren't ruined. this was delicious, thank you!

I tried this last night. Great combination of flavours. The basil give this dish a very fresh taste. I might have let the flavours absorb more by simmering longer, but nevertheless, a very tasty dish. Leftovers should be even better today.

This was a very good dish! Simple and very yummy. I used a can of stewed tomatoes and a few tablespoons of dried basil since I didn't have fresh tomatoes or basil and it was excellent. My husband loved it and that's always a good thing!

This was so yummy!  One of the best pasta dishes I have ever had.  I did change mine up a little.  I added a little lemon juice to the chicken while it was cooking and also added crab meat.  If the pasta seems a little dry, just add some milk to make it creamier.

I made this tonight for the first time with some leftover cooked chicken - my husband and I like to do a rotisserie chicken once a week or so and use the meat for sandwiches and other meals, and I've been looking for more than just the staple chicken pot pies and soups.   We enjoyed this, although I made a few changes based on the ingredients I had at hand - 1 can of whole tomatoes, no juice, put in the blender (my husband loves tomato sauces so I thought this would best please him) and I used a dollop of Dave' Insanity Sauce instead of the hot sauce. Next time I'd like to use Fresh Basil like the recipe called for - I think it would bring more flavor to the dish.   Still, something to add to my recipe box for sure! Thanks for posting.

I thought the basil overpowered this recipe.  Fresh basil was pricey for me since my store only sells it in a huge package.  If I try this again, it will be with dried basil.

Really delicious, easy and a definite keeper.  I doubled the amount of tomatoes, onions, and garlic while keeping the chicken and pasta portions the same as the recipe called for.  I also added some of the pasta water to the sauce for the last few minutes of cooking.  This really thickened up the sauce and gave the past some substance. Really clean and yummy recipe!!

I made this recipe exactly as written and while it was good it was clearly missing something flavor-wise that kept it from being great.  I will definitely try some of the suggestions next time.

I really enjoyed this recipe, my family loved it! If you like more sauce, I suggest, if you like pasta to have lots of sauce, adding more tomatos.  Otherwise, this tastes wonderful.  Also, try using italian style tomatos, they add a little bit of extra flavor.

The sauce tasted bland and was not much of a sauce at all.  So, we added a large can of tomato sauce which tasted wonderful with the chicken and pasta.

I used canned tomatoes due to not having enough fresh - next time I will use fresh tomatoes for a bit more flavor punch. A keeper.

Great recipe! Next time I won't waste as much of the juice from the tomatoes for more sauce. I added some oregano and I like another reviewer's idea to add some white wine to the chicken while it's cooking.

I wish I could give this recipe 4.5 stars because it was really good and very easy. I used a store bought rotisserie chicken which made it even easier. I followed the recipe pretty much exactly but next time I may add red bell pepper and artichoke hearts just for kicks.

Very good dish. Wish I could have taken the credit for this one. I added a little more Garlic (actually alot). Everyone at the firehouse digs garlic. A more is better attitude. I also seasoned then BBQ  the chicken before adding it to the sauce to keep the chicken moist. A solid 4.5 stars.

Actually 4.5 stars would have been a perfect rating for this recipe.  It was very good!  Not the best thing I've tasted, but very good! It was so easy to make and healthy and fast...doesn't get much better!

We have made this twice (by accident) and each time the sauce was very thin. Addtions: double the basil, garlic and hot sauce, and added sun-dried tomatoes for more flavor. I also added a teaspoon of garlic salt. We also added a vegetable which was very thinly sliced zucchini.

I didnt have any hot sauce or cayenne pepper to add, so I took it another way and added some white wine to the sauce.  That made it simply decadent.  Make sure you cut the chicken into very small bites or else they wont absorb the flavor.

This recipe was very simple and delicious. I wanted to use ingredients I already had at home so I made a few substitutions. I only had linguini so I used that instead of angle hair. I had one tomato so I used that and added a can of drained garlic and onion tomatoes. I also added about a 1/4 tsp. of ground pepper. This is a great recipe that I will make again.

Very good! Added half of a roasted red pepper I had.  Used a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh. Omitted hot sauce and salt.  Used 4 cloves garlic.  Served with garlic bread and a simple salad.

Awesome!  My hubby and I loved this recipe, the kids (5 and 2 1/2) not as much because they wanted more sauce on their pasta.  I didn't have the fresh tomatoes, so I used a 14.5 ounce can of diced tomatoes, but the rest was all fresh.  I also used 2 cloves of garlic and I didn't have the hot pepper sauce, so I sprinkled on a bit of red pepper flakes.  Thanks for a great new addition to my meal plans!

This was very good. I used both fresh tomatoes and canned tomatoes (diced with garlic and herbs). Also added a dash of dried oregano with the fresh oregano to enhance the aroma of the dish.

A great, easy meal!  It's nothing spectacular, but it last 2 days and it wasn't super expensive, so I'm digging that!  I would make again.

This was very good base recipe! I used the advise of the other cooks and made the following changes: Marinated chicken in Balsamic & Basil vinaigrette for 30 min, used seasoned canned of diced tomatoes (little liq. drained), added red wine, mushrooms, and Pesto to taste, omitted hot sauce. My fiance and I loved it since it was light and garlicy. Will make this again. Thank you!

Very blah.  I could have gotten the same results with basil-tomato sauce from Classico but without the hassle.  I won't be making this again.

This recipe is a great one. I made a few minor adjustments out of laziness. Used canned tomatoes, dried basil, etc... However, it still came out great. This would go great with garlic bread and red wine.

Tasted great but my sauce did not have as much liquid as desired, perhaps from allowing to simmmer for too long.

I made this for supper tonight as I had all the ingredients on hand, including fresh basil. I made the recipe exactly as written and sprinkled each dish with freshly grated Parmesan. My husband and 8 yr. old daughter enjoyed it, in fact, my daughter declared it "delicious" and had seconds. I liked it but was surprised at the lack of basil flavor. I wonder if a touch of pesto would kick it up a notch. I will make this again though, because we'll have plenty of tomatoes from our bushes soon and I love pasta dishes featuring fresh ingredients.

I always love trying new chicken dishes and made this one for hubby and I last night.  I decided to marinate the chicken cubes in some fresh garlic and balsamic vinegar for a few hours.  I used a combo of fresh grape tomatoes and a 14oz can of diced since I needed to use up my fresh ones.  Served over whole grain spaghetti as I didn't have angel hair.  We really enjoyed...hubby especially liked how the chicken was it's own distinct flavour.  Thanks for the simple but yummy dish!

Delicious! I used a 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes, removing the juice first, instead of fresh tomatoes. Because I didn't have hot pepper sauce, I used some cayenne pepper with a little bit of the tomato juice. Turned out great!

Terrific recipe!  Very simple and tons of great flavor for something so healthy! I made it with canned tomatoes (I drained the juice, but may try it with the juice next time to see how it turns out).  I only had cilantro on hand, so I used that instead of the fresh basil and it added a wonderful kick to the sauce.  I also added some garlic salt and a little cajun seasoning.  Definitely recommend!

This recipe is awesome. My husband (who is not much of a cook) made it last night and it it was wonderful. He marinated the chicken in balsamic vinegrette for about 1/2 hour, then cooked it with the garlic (left out the onions for me).  Added double the fresh basil, a bit of cayenne pepper, and a couple splashes of EVOO. Threw in 2 containers of halved grape tomatoes just before serving. Served over thin spaghetti. I think the vinegrette gave it a nice bite. This will go into our regular rotation!  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was great. my boyfriend and I cooked it together and it only took 30 minutes.He is addicted to lemons so we squeezed 1/2 of a fresh lemon over the final dish. we also used 1/2 cup more of onions and 2 more cloves of garlic. It turned out great but i think next time we will season the chicken more before cooking.

Very simple, difficult to double, though, because of the sheer volume of all that pasta.  It's nearly impossible to toss when you make that much!!!

This is one of my all time favorite things to cook!  It is so light and refreshing!  In the winter, I use canned tomatos and it is every bit as good!  I think I add a little extra garlic and some red pepper flakes as well.  So good!

This was really good. I cubed the chicken and then cooked it in olive oil and sprinkled garlic salt while it was cooking. I also used 2 cans of whole tomatoes and about 1/2 of 1 a can of the left over juice. Next time I will add a bit more juice.

I am usually intimidated by cooking with meat, but this was a very easy recipe and it came out great.  I used canned tomatoes, which gave it a nice flavor.  I like that it's simple and healthy.

I made this last night with just a few modifications. I used 1 can of diced tomatoes with the juice (hubby  is not a big fan of tomatoes). I also used whole wheat thin spaghetti and i eyeball most of the other measurements. I added crushed black pepper and that was it. It was very tasty and even the tomato stubborn hubby went back and finished it off.. so much for leftovers for lunch today!

I tweaked the recipe a little bit because I didn't have a copy with me as I was buying the ingredients and cooking but it tasted pretty good!  I didn't put hot sauce but did add some white wine.  You can also use italian sausages instead of chicken.

This recipe made as written is super bland.  Most of the people who gave it more stars have tweeked it, and I do think it has promise with some modifications.  I could literally not taste anything, which is unfortunate and surprising considering the amount of basil.

It smelled great while it was cooking, but in the end there was no flavor.  My husband and I both found it extremely bland.

I followed the recipe extactly, and my noodles were so dry. I had to toss the noodles with some more olive oil to coat them. It was a fast easy meal, but just OK.

I was looking for something easy to make on a Friday night after a long week of work. Well, i found it! I used a can of chopped tomatos b/c i didn't have fresh. I drained the juice b/f using and it was great! I will make this again when i am short on time.

Easy, yummy and filling. I used dried herbs instead of fresh and I think that was a mistake. It needed the extra fresh taste.

This was the first meal I made on the site, and I really enjoyed it! Unfortunately, I couldn't find 'angel hair', so I just used regular pasta.

This was just ok.  I felt there was too much pasta compared to the tomatoes.  I probably won't make again.

I made this last week, it was just for my brother and I but my Dad who doesn't like chicken or pasta got a whiff of it and wanted it as well. I didn't have any angel hair pasta so I just used twists. I read a review where someone said marinade the chicken first so I did. I put it in with oil lemon herbs tobasco and garlic. I used a bit more tomato than was called for but just let it simmer for longer and reduce to make a thicker sauce. There was a lovely kick to this recipe and I would reccomend this to anyone. I used all dried herbs and it was fine. Made the house smell lovely and all I kept hearing was "is it ready yet? It smells gorgeous." Just give it a try it is well worth it.

This was a simple recipe that my family loved. I did use canned tomatoes, dried basil and red pepper flakes in place of the fresh ingredients and hot sauce. I also added a little bit of oregano and a 15 oz. (double recipe) can of tomato sauce to give more of a "sauce". It made for a great dinner and delicious leftovers. Thanks!

A simple to make recipe that is sure to satisfy on a cold winter night!  I added 1 tsp. of dried rosemary and dried oregano. I also used red pepper flakes since I didn't have any sauce.

I was craving angel hair pasta and this dish totally satisfied it!  Only thing is I kind of overcooked the chicken so it came out a little dry, but the recipe itself is tasty!

This came out quite tasty! The left overs are excellent. I must say, I feel like something is missing though... maybe more seasonings aside from basil... maybe I needed more tomato... either way, my husband enjoyed it and this was a great, quick meal after a long day at work. :) Thanks!

This was fresh and tasty. I'm not the biggest fan of chicken and red sauce, but I did enjoy this. I needed to add extra pepper and garlic salt for flavor.

Great recipe! Awesome flavor. Some of the other reviewers said there was not enough sauce so I added and 8oz can of tomato sauce, it added so much extra sauce for the pasta and the flavor is GREAT!  I also omitted the hot sauce, and just added more pepper.  Thanks for the recipe :-)

I loved this! However my daughter complained there was "no sauce" to cover the pasta. Another daughter ate the toping as dinner without any pasta at all. I need to figure out a happy medium. I used the suggested changes of using canned tomatoes and draining one can first which worked out well except Next time I will use the liquid from both cans. Maybe I need to alter the recipe to make a little more sauce.

I thought this was wonderful. I doubled the tomato, garlic and onion. I used 1 tbs Dried Basil and it all worked out great. I think if I hadn't doubled the sauce it would have been really bland. This way it was perfect. Definitely try this if you like Italian dishes.

An easy to prepare tasty pasta dish. I made as indicated, except grilled the chicken just before using and added the pieces to the skillet after the tomato mixture had simmered. I found there was loads of liquid (which will likely depend on the tomatoes). I used freshly grated Parmesan, which added a great flavour. Thanks for the recipe, Wendy.

Used canned tomatoes and added feta cheese but needs something else, red pepper flakes maybe. Not much spice to it. Couldn't taste the hot pepper. But still it was pretty good.

I liked the mix of ingredients but it did not have enough flavor for me. I threw in some additional salt, as well as a half cup of prepared spaghetti sauce and a bit more hot spices and it was very good. 
It's worth a try..

I really liked this.  I added capers and like some of the other reviewers, I used canned tomatoes and let them simmer down so there wasn't as much liquid.  I also sauted the onion, garlic and chicken together then added the tomatoes, basil and the capers.  Delicious!  My family wasn't quite as enamored as they like "traditional" sauce.

Very good recipe, for starters. I was out of olive oil, and it was still fine. I used dry basil and still tasted great. I also put the chicken over orzo instead of angel hair, which made it very different. This is a good recipe for any event, thanks.

Not that interesting....the flavors of everything was tooo separated. Next time I might add a couple of tbsp of Tomato paste to thicken up the sauce a bit.

I made this tonight for dinner and it was ok, but not great.  My bf and I ended up adding additional salt afterwards.  I think next time I make it I will add more garlic and maybe some garlic salt to add extra flavor.  On a different note, my 3 yr old daughter had 2 helpings of it and loved it!

Very good recipe.  I didn't have any fresh basil, but dried worked fine.  I also only had tequilla-lime marinated chicken on hand - and it gave the dish some great flavor.  I also reduced the salt.

Very good pasta.  It goes together quickly and easily.  I took the suggestion of others and used two cans of diced tomatoes instead of fresh.  I'll make this again.

Very good recipe. I used 1 can tomato with chillies and 1 can of tomato sauce. I also cooked the onions with the chicken and added celery, mushrooms, green pepper and dry basil. Did not add the hot sauce. Used spaghetti.

This was okay--tasted like chicken cacciatore, but didn't have the kind of flavor I was hoping for. Although, it is a very quick meal that is easy to prepare.

This was pretty good.  I doubled the chicken/tomato mixture and added some oregano, a can of tomato sauce and 1 tsp of sugar.  I also put this on bowtie pasta.  I will definitely make it again.  Thanks.

This was okay.  I can't put my finger on why I didn't think it was anything special - maybe not enough flavor?  Might make it again, but spruce up the spices a bit, maybe add some green pepper too.

Very good.  Loved the angel hair pasta and fresh basil.  My tomatoes did not really make a sauce so I added a small can of tomato sauce.  So easy to make.  Will definitely make again.

Easy to make and tastes great.  I had to use dried basil since I didn't have fresh; I'm sure fresh would be better but it was very good with the dried basil.

Great Recipe!!  I did make the suggested changes:  I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes and also added some tomato paste to thicken the sauce.  I also grilled the chicken.  I didn't have fresh basil and was in a hurry, so just used basil spice.  I also just used garlic powder as I didn't have a garlic clove. I did add some diced olives as well as Cayene pepper to spice it up! I'm sure fresh would be even better, but this was outstanding.  Will eat again...very easy!

If this sauce is supposed to be very "light," than I guess it is pretty good - however, I don't think many people would like this sauce.  It doesn't have a lot of flavor to hold up to pasta.

Although this was a good dish it did not have enough flavor for my family's tastes.  If I make it again I think I will add some tomato paste or premaid pasta sauce.

Fabulous and so easy to make.  I didn't have any fresh tomatoes so I used two cans of diced tomatoes that I drained in a strainer.  I then omitted the salt from the recipe.  I think next time I will try the recommendation of adding Kalamata olives.  Can't wait for the leftovers today!  Thanks for sharing, Wendy!

I don't really like too many spicy foods, so I omited the pepper sauce and it worked great! The sauce was very flavorful and absolutely delicious. The basil gives it a very good flavor.

This was great, I served it for my in-laws and they raved about it!  So simple to make too, I forgot to add the corn chips and it was still great.

This recipe was absolutely wonderful! There is quite a bit of chicken in comparison to the amount of pasta, so I would reccomend either adding more pasta or taking away some of the chicken.

This recipe was FANTASTIC!  I used really ripe plum tomatoes and it is essential to use FRESH basil.  I used a little more hot pepper sauce than the recipe called for and omitted the Parmesan cheese altogether.  I also cut the salt in half and added some dried oregano and freshly ground black pepper.  I found this recipe very simple and easy to make.  Delicous - will make again and again. Thanks!

This dish not only looks super, it tastes super (according to my husband and son.  I don't eat pasta).  The only thing I changed was using Italian seasoned tomatoes.  Kid friendly but there were a few chunks of tomato left on my sons plate that had been pushed aside.  This is definetly a dish to serve to guests.

This was great.  I was able to use fresh tomatoes and basil from my garden.  I also added fresh parsley.  My "cover it with hot sauce" husband liked the flavor so much, the hot sauce stayed in the refrigerator!  Made wonderful leftovers for lunch at work.  Thanks!

Tastes like regular spaghetti sauce.  Nothing really special, but still tastes pretty good.

Excellent, fast and easy.  This would especially be good durring the summer months when tomatos and basil are abundant and fresh from the garden. It had a wonderfuly mild flavor.  I chopped it up and my 11 month old son also loved it. Yummy!

My husband is a VERY picky eater.  He LOVED this dish.  I did add some pasta sauce to it.  With the leftovers, he put it on top of thinly sliced Italian bread as an appetizer.  It was great.
