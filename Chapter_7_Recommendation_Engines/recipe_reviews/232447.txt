I know it’s June and in the 90’s in Florida, but I was intrigued by this recipe’s ingredients.  Had to give it a try.  I’m glad I did because I really liked it.  I substituted Truvia for the sugar to save on calories but, otherwise, followed the recipe except for giving it a little shot of whipped topping.  I’ve never had a cocoa-coffee drink with cayenne in it, but I loved that little kick that it gives this drink.  Honestly, I seldom like any of these powder drink mixes that have instant coffee in them, but this one worked for me.  Who knows, maybe even try it on ice for the summer.

Just okay. Was kind of flat like it was missing something.

I doubled the recipe, using Splenda instead of sugar. Instead of adding instant coffee to the mix, I added a 1/2 cup of the altered mix to 6 cups of brewed coffee. Simply wonderful!

I really liked the favors, but the suggested 1/4 cup of mix per mug of hot water was way too rich. I use 2 Tbl of mix and it tastes great.
