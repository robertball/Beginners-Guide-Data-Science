I liked these a lot...reminded me of a thicker tempura. I added a little water to thin it down a bit. I also dipped the fritters in a soy sauce/rice vinegar sauce. I'll definitely make these in the future...thank you for the recipe!

Wow, sorry but these were not what I expected especially after reading the reviews  I cooked these exactly as written and was very disappointed. I thought that they would be crispy like tempura, but they were very soggy.  They were also bland.  Will probably not make again without major tweaks.

These were very good and everyone here enjoyed them.  I served them with a thick sour cream/salsa dip on the side.  Thanks for sharing!

I had to make some changes to this recipe to make it work: 1) I added about half a cup of water (otherwise itâ€™s way too dry to even mix) 2) I preferred pan-frying them rather than deep frying them. 3) I added more green onions which made the flavor more enticing.

Very yummy and easy to make!

I didn't have onions, so I just used carrots and and sliced red pepper instead. Also used the batter with thinly sliced sweet potatoes. A good way to use up left over veggies~

It's worth noting that it makes a thicker batter that isn't super crispy. It does have a bit of a crunch, but the dough is more like a fried bread.
