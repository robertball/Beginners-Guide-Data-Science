This sauce was absolutely delicious... I followed the recipe except for the garlic I just used some Garlic-Jalapeno paste, and I put more crushed red pepper... I love spicy... and a friend also commented this could even be used for chicken wings... Haha I tasted the sauce and at first it tasted sweet then you feel the hotness after about 15 seconds lol...

Sorry, but we didn't really like this.  It didn't taste like most lumpia sauce I have had. It was really sweet.  We love garlic too, but it seemed like  2 tbsp. was a little to much.

Very good. Adjust garlic and red pepper flakes to taste. I added almost twice as much red pepper flakes and only made half the recipe. A keeper.

This was a great recipe, but a little bit too sweet for us. I made it as written to start and then added a second cup of water; it's still too sugary though it worked great as a sauce. I'd recommend adding the brown sugar in a little bit at a time until the taste is right.

Tasty and very easy sauce.  I upped the red pepper flakes to 1/2 teaspoon & it really gave it a great heat.  Withouth the spicy notes it would be way too syrupy sweet.

Everyone enjoyed it, a bit sweet but it went really well with the lumpia.

Really good sauce - nice mix of sweet and hot. It probably could stand to be a little hotter...

This was a great base but I made quite a few changes as many users suggested and it turned out amazing. I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup and it was still far too sweet. I used 3 minced garlic cloves but didn't measure much of anything else, just added to taste. Added some rice wine vinegar, soy sauce, a lot more chili flakes and the zest of an orange. With these additions, this was one of the best sauces I have ever had!

I made it just like it said, but was really sweet. To cut through the sweetness I added a small splash of rice wine vinegar and pinch of salt. Once the overwhelming sweetness was gone, it was an amazing sauce. Thanks for the hookup!

Very sweet. Too sweet for our taste so I added rice vinegar and it's very tasty now! Now it's more sweet & sour and delish on lumpia!

It was so cloyingly sweet as made. I added more pepper, some rice vinegar and soy sauce, which improved it.

This was a pretty good sauce but it did need help. I added twice as much of the chili flakes, I added a teaspoon of  pink Himalayan sea salt, and I also added half of an orange zested.  it turned out to be absolutely fabulous. Just enough orange to balance everything out but not too much to the point where it feels like it's a sauce for orange chicken

This sauce is very simple to prepare. It was too sweet for my families taste. I added rice wine vinegar which cut the sweetness very well. I also added 3/4 of a tablespoon of red pepper flakes.

Definitely needed more pepper (we used a about a TBS of ground red pepper) and is a tad too sweet, but all in all a GREAT sauce for lumpia!

I liked this recipe very much.  My husband though thought that it was just too sugary, but he likes sweet and sour sauce. I thought that this tasted better than sweet and sour sauce.
