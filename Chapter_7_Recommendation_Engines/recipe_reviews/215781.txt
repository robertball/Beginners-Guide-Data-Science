I don't usually buy pork chops because I really don't like the usual chewy texture. I also don't make many meat dishes in a slow cooker because I don't like the mushy texture. I wanted to find a way to use pork chops because they are frequently a good buy and voila - success! I wish these were more visually appealing, they really do taste better than they look! I put the cabbage on the bottom of the slow cooker so that the chops weren't in direct contact with the hot crock for real slow cooking. Then I put half of the onions and half of the apples under the chops and half on top. IMPORTANT NOTE: I THINK THAT THE DRYNESS OTHERS HAVE FOUND MAY BE DUE TO THE TIME GIVEN FOR BROWNING THE CHOPS. Five minutes per side will cook the chops through at that medium high heat. That creates a dry, tough pork chop. Heat the oil over high heat, then brown for about two minutes per side. You only need to create a nice brown sear. They chops will finish cooking in the slow cooker. Add the liquid to the pan and stir to deglaze. You don't want to leave that flavor in the pan. Be sure to use fresh, flavorful spices. I might try a little less vinegar next time and maybe a little more brown sugar. But, with less searing time, this is a good recipe to serve an affordable and tasty meal to your family.

The pork chops were dry and the cabbage/apple/onion slaw did not taste good. I followed the directions as stated. The best part about the meal was the mashed potatoes I served on the side. I will not make this again.

My husband and I made this, thought it was pretty good. Since it was only the two of us we only made 3 pork chops. But, used the same recipe since the other reviews said the chops were dry we thought this would be okay. Turned out well. The pork chops werent too dry and they fell apart with your fork. Very yummy and easy fall dish!

I made this exactly as the recipe read except I didn't use the cabbage.  We found it bland and the meat turned out dry.  Won't make it again.

I have not made this recipe yet but I think the others who have may simply need to adjust the amount of liquid being used - if your crockpot is larger than the traditional 6 quart style or very new and powerful, you have to add more water to make sure the pot is at least half-full for the whole time, or everything will overcook.  I will try this and check back!

For a pork dish , it was very easy and flavorful. I did make two small changes.. no meat tenderizer as it makes a lot of people sick. Also, added a half of head of cabbage and let it all cook till the pork chops were tender.

I was looking for a way to make a cheap cut of bone in pork chop taste better. This recipe did the trick. I did not use the cabbage or meat tenderizer and I cut back on the sugar a bit. I would recommend a little less cider vinegar as well. 
The recipe made cheap meat fall right off the bone and taste much better than it had when I just pan fried it in olive oil with salt & pepper. The meat was tender and the apples & onions along with the pork made a nice topper for the noodles that I served it with. I would make this again and add a coating of flour to the chops for a thinker sauce. 
All in all, my husband and I liked it and this was pretty good for such a cheap cut of meat!

Apples, cabbage, and whole pork loin were on sale so I went looking for a recipe using all 3 and found this. Since many reviews complained of dry meat and a lack of flavor I decided to cut a roughly 2 lb roast off my whole loin instead of cutting chops, and I doubled the spices. I did not use meat tenderizer, and did salt and pepper the meat before browning it on all sides. The meat was so tender and delishious. The cabbage was flavorful. I would make it again just as a roast not as chops.

All 5 liked it in family. It's a keeper.   I added a bit more spices - using fresh ginger, garlic and nutmeg and eliminating tenderizer (whatever that is). I also did not include the cabbage in the pot. I served it with garlic couscous (in chicken broth) with glazed carrots and a side of seared red cabbage (which the kids love and added some color).  I also chopped more fresh apple and added on top of meat when served to brighten it up and give it a nice crunch!

The veg was very tasty. I only wish I had read the reviews before I made it. My fault, browned the meat too long and should have put the cabbage on the bottom. I made this for my parents and I for Sunday dinner and the meat came out a bit tough. Again my fault, still learning to use the slow cooker. I will definitely try this again.

I was a bit disappointed in this recipe. However, I have been cooking for 50 years, and this recipe has great ingredients,  yet they do seemed to be designed to utilize a more modern horizontal based slow-cooker.  I am using an older 1970's vertical based slow-cooker.  The pork was way overcooked and meally yet the cabbage was dry and cooked minimally.  So I credit myself for the failure.  Next time, I think this recipe will work much better cooked the old fashioned way using my Cast Iron Skillets and lids in the oven for a shorter time.

I love pork and apples, but the vinegar really took away from the other flavors.

I followed the recommendations of janet7th.  This was fine, but not one that I would make again.  I did not use the meat tenderizer and although the pork chops didn't need a knife, they were dry.  If you don't want to use meat tenderizer, you may want to skip this recipe because I think that is the only thing that can save the pork chops.

The meat was dry and with little flavor.I read the other reviews first and added extra spices and liquid with no success. It was still dry and bland.
