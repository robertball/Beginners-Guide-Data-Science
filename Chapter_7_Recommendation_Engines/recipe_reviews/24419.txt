If you read through the previous reviews, the 1 constant remark “the bread is sticky” appears.  We added an additional ¾ c flour to our bread machine (using a total of 4 ½ c flour) which did the trick.  What’s the point of using the bread machine if you’re kneading more (in this case A LOT) of extra flour in the end?  Our finished product turned out well.

This dough is fantastic!  Chewy, yeasty, sweet. Makes a better  challah than a deli!  It makes 2 medium sized loaves, and we often braid one, place it on slightly greased waxed paper, then a ziploc bag, and pop it in the freezer.  We can defrost it, let it rise, and bake it weeks later.

I'm very experienced with using bread machine recipes, yet I found this bread to be extremely disappointing. The dough turned out like batter and was impossible to shape because it was so sticky. Even working in extra flour was no help. If I'd had extra time, I would have added more flour and more yeast, and put it back through an extra knead and rise cycle. Unfortunately, I didn't have the luxury of time, since I was getting ready for a family holiday function. I'm sure the loaf would have been fine (though perhaps dense) if I'd just poured the batter--um, dough-- into a pan and baked it, but I was really hoping this recipe would yield a loaf I could shape beautifully for our holiday. So in my frustration I threw the dough/batter away. I won't try this recipe again--and this is the first recipe at allrecipes.com that has been so disappointing.

This recipe is so yummy. I had never made challah before but I found this to be really easy to make. The bread came out so well... my family was convinced that I must have got it from the bakery because it was so good and looked great too. :)

The bread is absolutely delicious! The flavour is light and mouth watering...you can't stop eating it.  I increased the yeast because the first time I made it - it didn't rise enough.  So I add three big teaspoons of yeast the next time and it turned out great.  I have also tried adding raisins - wow, it was also delicious! mmm...

add 1/2 cup more flour, and made one loaf instead of 2, which 6 strands....2 over, one under, 2 over, one under. Bake for 25-30 minutes. Can freeze the dough braided before rising...

Delicious!!! This dense challah has a sweet and delicious flavor. I too added 1/2 cup of high gluten bread flour to the batch which made the consistency perfect! I used to make this recipe with my bread machine, but it broke. I made this recipe last night  - making 1.5x the recipe in my kitchen aid. I let the yeast, sugar and water proof for 10 minutes and then mixed in all of the wet ingredients and then all of the dry ingredients. PERFECT!!!! I let it rise in a "PAMed" large bowl covered with saran wrap - in my microwave (I learned that trick somewhere - The dough is still warm from the warm water added to it. I place it in the microwave to rise bc it is confined in there and the walls or the microwave keep it insulated, removing the need to placing in on top of a pot of warm water... (it just gets a little annoying if i NEED the microwave during that time). Let rise for 1.5 hours. Breaded it and let rise for 30 minutes. I have also used this delicious dough for babka and ragulach. The strechines and elasticity of the dough is really great! I did not need to add any more flour after the initial ingredients were all combined!

I have been searching for some time now for a great Challah dough recipe, and this is it!  My mother purchased store bought Challah and I brought 2 loaves of this Challah and no-one ate my mom's!  I just floured up my hands to combat the sticky dough.

This was an excellent challah with one important caveat -- the water-to-flour ratio is way off.  Use about 7/8 cup water and then add extra flour, a tablespoon at a time during the initial knead, until it forms a slightly sticky smooth ball of dough.  (I didn't keep track but easily added at least another half cup of flour.)  Leave all the other ingredients in the same proportions as written (I actually substituted about a third of the oil with melted butter).  This baked up beautifully (we made a beautiful round braided loaf for rosh hashanah) and was by far the best-tasting and best-texture challah out of 4-5 different bread machine recipes I have tried.  Moist, chewy, delicious.  One other very helpful thing is to stick a meat thermometer into the dough before you put it in the oven, and bake until it just reaches 200 degrees.  Take it out, and it will be perfect.  No more tapping on the crust and guessing!  p.s.  7 people for dinner and the bread was devoured--the only thing we didn't have leftovers of.

I've tried so many challah recipes and I like this one a lot. I followed a reviewer's suggestion and added an extra 1/2 cup flour to prevent stickiness. It had wonderful texture and flavor. The first time I made it I didn't have any honey, but after making it again with the honey added, I actually liked it better without because it was a tad bit fluffier. Really good!

I tried this recipe twice with different jars of yeast but both times it did not rise at all. I then tried another challah recipe with the same yeast and it worked perfectly.  I even tried adding additional flour and yeast as other reviewers suggested but it still refused to rise.  In my experience, when using a bread machine (that lets the dough rise for an hour) after braiding it should only need to rise for another 20 minutes or so.  I don't know why this recipe didn't work for me, but I urge caution!!!

I made this because Challah is my son's favorite bread.  It turned out great!!  Awesome texture and a very beautiful loaf.  I am a serious novice at making hand shaped loaves, but with this one, there were no troubles.  I think a key is to make a fairly tight braid.

Best of all, this bread made the most delicious French Toast the next morning.  Definitely a keeper.  Thank you Marylyn!

This is one of my favorite recipes. It's excellent not only for holidays, but others. I just use 4 1/2 cups of bread machine flour, instead of 4 cups (hence the 4 stars.) I make 2 loaves, and give one to my happy neighbors.

After reading some of the reviews, I anticipated needing to add extra flour -- I ended up using 6 1/2 cups of bread flour! This made the dough very easy to work with, and I got fantastic results from the final baked product. Looking forward to making another batch!
Addendum: Tried this with 2 cups whole wheat flour and 3 cups regular all-purpose flour and was great - don't see the point of using bread flour! Increased the sugar to ~3/4 cup and honey to ~4-5 tablespoons to compensate for whole wheat.

This is a super easy recipe to follow. I made no changes in the recipe and it turned out to be better than the $6.00 a loaf bread at the farmers market. Very easy to braid to. Well done.

I have been making Challah since I was 13 years old, and tried every old yenta's recipe in my synagogue. This is the first to produce moisture, flavor AND texture.  Not to mention nearly zero prep time.  The search is over!

This is the best Challah recipe!  I had just gotten a bread maker that I wanted to try out so I baked this for Sabbath dinner one night instead of buying our Challah.   Three generations of family gave it rave reviews! My cousins were fighting over the last piece!  We are Jewish and we eat Challah AT LEAST once a week so we all know good Challah when we taste it!  My sister taught me that you know your Challah is cooked completely when it sounds hollow when you knock on it.

This recipe was actually perfect in the flour/water ratio.  The dough should be slightly sticky/moist.  And I got the right texture.

Remember it makes a huge, and I mean HUGE difference in different climates/humidity etc.  I would err with the least and then check the dough mid cycle to see if you need more flour or water.  

Meanwhile, I did two braids from this recipe, and baked up great.  Thanks,

Followed this recipe exactly except I added sesame seeds on top before baking and it turned out amazing! This was my first time making Challah, and only my second time eating it. My husband and I finish off the entire loaf because it was so good! I ended up braiding both halves and freezing one in a greased freezer bag. I can't wait to bake it up in a few weeks!

very very good. I made it on the quick cycle on my bread machine and it was a bit under done but we like challah a little gooey :) I did add 1/2c extra flour as per other postings. Probably ok w/o the extra flour.

I sell bread and this bread is a best-seller for me. I braid and put in a 9x5 loaf pan. I cook them for 19 minutes at 350 and turn it out onto a wire rack. As long as the center doesn't cave in (even if it's not browned on the bottom), it's done and will be very light and moist if you wait until completely cooled before cutting.  My favorite is having a slice of challah with mayo and a slice of fresh tomato (and I don't really care for the veges) YUMMM!!

The first time I used all purpose flour and the dough was sticky.  After that I made sure to only use bread flour and the dough wasn't at all sticky.  This is so delicious  and easy to make every week.

This is a fantastic, easy recipe.  I doubled the honey and added a little extra yeast, and both loaves turned out beautifully.  Next time I will probably triple the honey or add 1/2 cup of honey and then decrease the white sugar; but one thing is for certain - I will be making this again!
Update - here's a tip - if you are using quite a bit of honey, mix it in with the water and have it count in your water measurement, otherwise you end up having to add a lot more flour and can end up with a door stop.

This was a hit at our family christmas party! So glad I made two batches. Adding 1/2 cup extra flour made a perfect doughball and braided easily. The family wants me to make it again before next christmas!

Can't believe I never reviewed this recipe...have been using for a couple of years. It is fantastic! I make just as written except usually use 4 1/2 cups of flour. I also sprinkle with sesame seeds or poppy seeds after the egg wash. This is an unbelievably great recipe, which my husband loves! Thank you SO much for this wonderful recipe...now if I could only braid the bread better!

I spent today making this recipe and Bread Machine Challah I.  I have to say I like Bread Machine Challah I much more.  

For this recipe, I did what other people suggested and used 4 1/2 cups of flower instead of 4, but the dough still came out too sticky.  When I braided the dough at let it rise again, it sort of ran together and lost it's shape.  When I baked it, the loaves came out a little flat.  They taste good, and are moist.  I think that perhaps the wetting and covering braids with plastic wrap contributed to the over-softness of the dough.  Instead I would suggest rolling out the braid strands with flour to help them keep separated.

Fabulous recipe. Have made it numerous times and it has never failed me.  However, I've used regular flour instead of bread flour.  It's never been sticky like the other complaints.

I've made this recipe a dozen or more times. If you follow the measurements exactly the dough comes out perfect. If you use more honey, or measure the water in a measuring cup that lets you go over the one cup mark it's easy to get sticky dough. This is easily fixed by turning out on a floured surface a folding a few times. I was raised on challah and this is my favorite - its the only recipe I use now (although I do tend to use 1/2 white 1/2 wheat).

Recipe ratios all wrong for using it in the bread machine, as many people have stated. I have tried this one twice now trying to use people's comments.  This time I used 4 1/2 cups of flour, and it was still way too doughy.  Better to use a different recipe than to try and fix this one yet again.

This is a very good recipe. I have tried several challah recipes and we loved this one. Reading other reviews, some of them mentioned "stickiness". I used 4 1/2 cups of flour and it wasn't sticky at all. Also, recipe says 20-25 minutes. At 25 minutes it hardly had any color. But this was not a big deal I just baked it longer, about 40 minutes.

To be honest, I didn't bother taking out to shape or to bake in oven, I simply set it for regular 2 lb loaf in my machine and let it bake in there! It was awesome, good thick crust and tender slightly sweet crumb!

Delicious bread!  I made the whole thing in the bread maker as a basic loaf with light crust setting and it came out perfect.  It's a very large loaf - almost hit the top of my machine (I have a 2 lb machine).

I've made this bread twice now and both times it took over 2 hours for the dough to double in size, even when I increased the yeast to 3 tsps. Otherwise, no complaints - easy, tasty and pretty.

I made this for Rosh Hashanah.  Instead of braiding it, I made it into a round loaf by rolling it into a snake with tappered ends, then rolling it up from one end, like a big spiral.  People were taking seconds and thirds.

I used this recipe to make the Thanksgiving cornucopia on this site. I added about a 1/4 of wheat flour, and exchanged another 1/2cp wheat for white flour. I had enough for the cornucopia, and a small braided loaf...which was beautiful, and tasted wonderful. Thank You for this recipe..I will definitely make this again.

After reading a story to my students with Challah in it and eating some form Noah's Bakery, I had to go and find a recipe that could match such a delicious bread.  This one is awesome.  I have a bread machine but have never used it.  The instructions seem so complicated, so I always end up making my bread by hand. I don't mind taking the time as long as the bread tastes good.  I proofed the yeast (active dry) in 1/4 cup of the warm water called in the recipe and mixed everything else together including the remaining amount of water(except for the eggs).  I whisked the eggs and added it to the everything mixture.  Finally I added the yeast mixture.  Then I added 2 cups of flour and mixed and finally 2 more cups.  It turned out to be a nice dough.  Yes, it was a bit sticky, but after rinsing my hands, I was able to able to ball it up and put it in my greased bowl (I used a large pot with a lid!)  I turned it over once and let in rise for 1 hour in my garage since these days are 110 out here.  It's a perfect place to rise bread!  Then I punched it down and let it rise for 30 more minutes.  Then I punched it down, kneaded it, and braided it.  Then I let the braid rise for another 45 minutes.  It did not rise as much as some other bread I made, but it did rise enough for me.  It turned out very good! My kids liked it better than a previous recipe I've tried.  It was soft, flaky, sweet moist and even buttery in a way.  Next time, I'm going to increase the rising time to see if it g

My family loves this recipe.  Some folks have mentioned that the dough is sticky...I only noticed this to be the case once when I ran out of bread flour and substituted all purpose flour.  This challah is absolutely perfect and bakes up beautifully.  This is the best bread I have ever baked!  It is very easy to braid and rises fluffy and high.  Just make sure you are using bread flour as the recipe specifies.

This recipe makes the best challah!  I've "won" several bake-off's with friends who say they make great challah.  The only thing I do differently is that I up the flour to 5 cups so my dough isn't so sticky coming out of the bread machine, but you can't beat the flavor!

I've made this recipe 4 times in the bread machine now, and it's always been great.  Usually it is very sticky to handle, so flour *everything*--your hands, your board,...and have extra flour on hand for frequent re-dosing.  I enjoy adding 1 cup plumped golden raisins just before braiding, and everyone loves it.  The center usually ends up chewy (whether with our without raisins), but my family seems to prefer it that way.  I imagine if you baked it longer it might cook more thoroughly.

This is by far my favorite bread recipe!  It is a nice sweet dense bread.  I have made it several times. Everyone loves it and I have had quite a few requests for the recipe.  I do notice the moisture of the dough can sometimes be dependant upon the weather.  But saying that I have never had it fail for me.  I do sometimes add a smidgen more yeast (I use the stuff in the jar).  Sometimes I will also make one large loaf instead of two small ones.  I just love this recipe it is definately a staple in my recipe box, and THANK YOU for sharing this one!

The dough was so sticky when it came out of the bread machine, it was almost impossible to work.  It didn't rise as it should have and had a distinct taste of oil after I baked it.  I probably wouldn't use this recipe again, unless I made some changes, perhaps substituting something for the oil.

It came out of the machine too sticky to work with. Had to add alot more flour. It tasted nice & sweet, but took forever to make. Probably won't make this again.

Wow!  This turned out fantastic.  Followed the recipe exactly (except for the addition of 1/2 cup raisins) and found no problems at all.  Resist the temptation to work in too much more flour when shaping the loaves.  It's a slightly sticky dough, but managable.

This is a fantastic recipe! I used to bake Challah in a bowl and not a bread machine, but now I use this easy and delicious recipe. I serve it every Friday night and I get so many compliments!

I have made this recipe a lot, so some advice , the amount of flour may varied from 4 cup to 5, that depends in some thing like the temparature, the humidity , the size of the eggs the tips of honey you use.

I tried this recipe using 2 cups bread flour, and 2 1/2 cups white wheat flour and it turned out perfect! My 4 kids almost ate the entire first loaf with their dinner tonight. With the remaining loaf, I sliced and am preparing a French Toast Casserole in the a.m. I've never made challah before, and never even tasted it so I'm not sure what to compare it to, but regardless, it's a wonderful bread. Thanks for sharing!

I found the same as many previous users, this dough came out uber sticky and mine actually didn't rise much either.  Since I already had the dough made, I went ahead and baked it.  It tastes decent, although I found it a little too salty.  I think I will try again with the adjustments of adding more flour and using a little less salt.  Do people think additional yeast would help this recipe as well?

I had originally come to find a recipe for French bread but when I saw this gorgeous challah..I HAD to make it. Hubs had never had challah before and I hadn't had it in ages. It was INCREDIBLE. I mean, baker's quality. I used APF since I never keep bread flour in the house and I didn't use honey as I was all out and had no problem working with the dough whatsoever. Hubs wanted to eat the whole loaf in one sitting!!! Kids loved it too. I'm not sure if the lack of honey/use of APF changed the texture or anything but I had no sticky issues at all so maybe that'll help someone!

With a lot of tweaking, this recipe turns out well. I live in the Deep South, where the humidity changes everything in the kitchen. By adding a little flour during the kneading process in the bread machine and during the braiding, I found the baked loaves to be as pretty as they should be. The baking sheet or pan needs to be greased for the challah to completely come off of it. I tried using the beaten whole egg for the glaze and found that it made the bread taste strongly of egg, which should never happen with challah.  The solution: use egg white. I am grateful to have found this recipe, because I have carpal tunnel syndrome and need a machine to knead for me.  Thanks to the person who shared it for making my family's Shabbat more enjoyable, with no need to run to a special bakery for bread, call ahead for it, and so forth!

Necessary to ad 1/2 cup of flour; the doubt is very sticky. But the result is very good.

Does anyone know how to convert from bread machine to non-bread machine?

Love this bread!  BUT, I always need to add more flour since it ends up too sticky to work with.

Once I braid it, let it rise and then bake, the braids lose all their definition and it looks more like a loaf bread than a challah... any ideas????

Thanks!

Loved it !!   It is a keeper. For my own family likes I substituted one stick of butter for the 1/2 cup vegetable oil because we love butter baked in bread. Based on previous reviews; I added in extra egg for 3 eggs total and added in 1/2 cup more flour for a total of 4 1/2 cups of bread flour.

I have been making this for about 2 years.  This is hands down the easiest and tastiest Challah.  No one can get enough of it!  I have made it exactly as written and it comes out great.  However these days, I do not measure the honey so tend to put a little more in.  I also add an extra 1/2 C of flour and 1/4 tsp yeast.

I agree with another lady that said the dough was so 'sticky'.  I kept adding flour, more flour, etc. and ended up with 2 small loaves of rather heavy,dense breads.... not the two pleasing small loaves I was hoping for.  I will not make this again.

I make this recipe every week now and I think it is outstanding. One point of disagreement with the reviewers here - yes the dough is sticky, but adding so much additional flour changes the texture away from the tender and light qualities of the original.  I've found that if I am diligent about having floured hands and a floured board (but not too much flour!) the stickiness problem drops considerably.  It also helps to divide the recipe into 3 loaves rather than 2, and to flour a pastry cutter to help transfer the loaves onto the baking stone.  also, to get a super shiny glaze, egg wash once after braiding, and a second time after rising.  enjoy!

I made this recipe exactly as directed, and THEN read the reviews...so I had a moment of panic when I thought for sure it wasn't going to turn out right.  But, much to my delight, I had no problems.  The dough was slightly sticky, but nothing a little flour on the hands couldn't fix.  It was easy to work with, and it turned out wonderfully!  We really enjoyed this bread, and I will be making it a lot.  Also, if anyone is in need of a good laugh, I submitted a picture of my bread.  The camera made it look yellow (which it is not in real life, it is a lovely brown), and my braiding skills leave much to be desired (as my daughter has been telling me since she could talk), but the bread is delicious and that is what matters :)

I made this for Christmas dinner to honor my Jewish friends.  It came out perfect in every way.  I followed the recipe as written. I did get a bit adventurous with my braiding which made it all the more beautiful. The flavor was amazing!

So disappointing.  We were so looking to having delicious bread for dinner.  Made it exactly as the recipe states and ended up with a custard/pudding that poured out of the bread machine.  Added flour until it actually resembled a dough.  Braided it anyway.  Let it proof for 4 hours before deciding to just bake it and see what happened.  Ended up with a very dry, very crumbly flour-laden loaf of something.  Will not make again.

My first time and it is perfect!  I added a little extra flour (especially while working with the dough and made a round one (with raisins) for Rosh Ha'shana.  I made a little mini one to taste test and it was awesome!  I am so proud!

I love this challah recipe. It is easy and comes out beautifully. I usually add a bit of extra honey and subtract a bit of the sugar. I think this helps keep the bread sweet without becoming too sweet. 
Sometimes I have to add extra flour to keep the dough from getting too moist. 
While the dough doesn't braid as easily as other recipes I've tried, the bread tastes better and the braid looks better after baking then some other doughs I've tried with an easier to braid consistency.

I have tweeked this into the perfect challah. I brought the sugar down to between 1/4 -1/3 cup. Often I use aguave necter for honey as it is tolerated better by people who have sugar problems. I also go up to 5 cups of flour. As for stickiness..sometimes humidity in the house makes a difference.

I tried this recipe twice.  Twice it turned out bad.  the dough was so loose, i had to add apx. 2 cups of flour more to the recipe in order to get it to be half way manageable.  The bread came out tasting like a biscuit and was inedible.   The 2nd time the same thing happened.  The dough was so watery it was like batter.  I can't believe this recipe got 4.75 stars!  I wasted my whole day on this recipe!

Great recipe - the only things I changed were:
1. I used lightly warmed whole milk instead of the water(if the milk is very warm, it will scramble your eggs :))
2. added the zest of 1 lemon while the machine was shaping the dough ball 
3. After I brushed them with the egg, I sprinkled them with granulated sugar.

Thank you for a great recipe!

Delicous. My first Challah and I had no idea this was so easy to make. Things I realized afterwards:
Make sure you let your bread machine go through the complete dough cycle, and get it out of the machine as soon as the dough cycle beeps. Don't allow it to rise past that. Braid, but make sure the "rope" ends are super skinny so when you braid it (I did a beautiful 6 strand braid!) it won't be too crazy lumpy on the ends and it'll be easier to deal with. I also found that it was sticky but a few brushings/tsps. of flour while hovering over the machine while it's moving about will cure it and make it easier to remove later on when it is complete. Just watch and it'll make a ball and not stick to the sides of the machine. I didn't foil tent it, baked it at 325 for about a 25-30 minutes. I quickly painted one whipped up egg several times, as it grew during baking.  Good luck. I'm totally making this again. (oh, and I even screwed up and pulled it out before the dough cycle was 1/2 way complete- braided the dough then realized I was supposed to let it go through the entire 1 hr machine dough cycle, then I just threw the two loaves back into the machine, unplugged machine, replugged machine and hit the button for dough again, restarting it from the beginning of cycle. It still turned out great. lol

This was so easy to make and while I was intimidated by the braiding process, I have to say, the bread looks and smells amazing! So the next day I reheated the bread and I had soooo many compliments on it!!! Yum!!!

This was pretty easy to make and turned out good. Based on the reviews below, I did increase the flour to 4 and a half cups, but I found the dough to still be really sticky and hard for me to work with. So I kneaded in some extra flour, until I could work with it easier.  Probably next time I will increase the flour to 5 cups and try that out.  Other than that, it was great!!

I can't say enough good things about Challah. It's one of my favorite breads to make and this is a good recipe. The only thing I didn't like was the amount of oil in it... I could feel it while kneeding it between rises...

I have absolutely no idea how this is almost 5 stars. I just tried to use this recipe verbatim and it turned out a runny batter, like loose baby food. Not dough. Nothing I can work with. I wasted my night and a good amount of ingredients. Be warned. If we have Challah for Rosh Hashanah, it will be because I use another recipe or go to the store. 0 stars.

I made this after trying out the recipe for Bread Machine Challah 1.  This recipe makes a dough that is easier to work with and a final presentation that is nicer looking than Challah 1, but Challah 1 is by far better tasting.  We had to restrain ourselves from eating 2 loaves of Challah 1 right out of the oven.  I almost threw away Challah II after tasting it.

Absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except I added an extra 1/2 cup of flour. The dough came out of the machine cleanly and was really easy to work with. I didn't wrap in plastic after braiding, instead I let the shaped dough rise on a baking sheet in a preheated oven @125 degrees - takes less time and results in a better rise. Baking time on the center rack was just a little over 25 minutes and the challah looked and smelled fantastic - the consistency was just right and completely even throughout. The recipe as written yields two medium size challahs. I think we have a new family favorite! Thanks so much for sharing...

Very tasty.  Makes a good amount of challah - 4 people ate less than one of the two loaves with lunch.  After reading other reviews, I used more bread flour than the recipe called for.  I made my 4 cups heaping then added a little more (so probably approx 4.5 cups total).  I would use more yeast next time - maybe 2 3/4 t. or 1T?  Other than that, awesome.

I've never braided a bread dough but was inspired by this recipe to try it out and it worked great!  I was thrilled with the end result.  Not only is it beautiful, it was fun to make and the flavor and texture are fantastic.  It slices up beautifully.  I'm glad it made two loaves since I'm hoping to try making french toast out of any that is left tomorrow.  Many reviewers mentioned the dough being too sticky so I added about 1/4 cup additional flour.  I think it would have been fine without it though.  You just need to flour your board while you are working it into ropes.  You don't want it to be too dry.  I'll make this again for sure.

I experienced the same thing that I have read in the other reviews. The dough came out of the bread machine very sticky like a thick batter. At first I thought that I had measured the flour incorrectly. I just threw it on a floured surface and started kneading more flour into it. Finally, after about two more cups of flour, it looked like bread dough. I followed the rest of the instructions and it turned out really well. My wife and I both really liked it. The only alteration that I made was to substitute molasses for the honey because I didn't have any. I will next time because I will definitely make this again.

Challahleuhah!  This challah bread recipe is fabulous and melt in your mouth delicious!  I added an extra cup of flour (5 in total)and allowed my loaves to rise quietly overnight.  What a difference; lighter, flakier, and tastier!  The best is making french toast from this recipe;  I had some egg wash left over so I just added some vanilla, cinnamon and milk and made french toast.  Unbelievable!

This is pretty good...but I have a question.  I'm confused.  So many reviewers say this dough is sticky.  So..the first time I used it, I added extra flour.  The dough was anything but sticky.  It was rather heavy and didn't rise easily.  I then made it according to the exact instructions...it still seemed heavy.  Could it be because I am using unbleached bread flour?  I'm making several loaves as a fund raiser.  

I've made about 8 loaves already and 2 of those loaves still remained rather heavy and doughy...we will keep those for ourselves.  I would actually like the dough to be a little lighter.

Any suggestions?

Excellent flavor!  I used 4 cups of bread flour, but the dough was way too sticky.  I definitely recommend you add at least 3/4-1 cup of extra bread flour to the bread machine before starting the dough cycle....but begin with the smaller amount, then if you need more flour, add the other 1/4 cup SLOWLY after you turn on the bread machine.  Depending on the humidity, you may even need to add more flour before shaping the loaves.  Also, my loaves didn't require as much baking time as the recipe states; so watch the oven closely or your crust will burn.

I love the taste and texture of this challah, but can't seem to get mine to rise properly.  I am giving it four stars b/c it is absolutely addictive and everyone enjoys it, but I sure wish I could make it fluffier.  Have tried increasing the yeast but it hasn't made much difference.

I must admit that I was rather skeptical when I first read this recipe. I did not believe a bread machine could produce a tasty Challah bread without using butter.  I was really surprised at the results.  I don't think I will ever make it by hand again.  It was soooo easy and very yummy!  Every one in the house was drooling for more.  I have made it several times now and have even made the dough into rolls.

Very delicious bread!  I had been purchasing Challah bread at the market for French Bread and decided that there must be a recipe out there somewhere for breadmachines.  It came out beautiful.  Thank you for sharing the recipe Marylyn.

It’s the second time I’ve made it.  My bread machine didn’t come with a challah recipe, so I used this one without any idea the order of ingredients.  I put the dry ingredients in first then the wet.  I added an extra 1/2 c flour the first time, but the dough flattened just before baking (when I brushed it with egg), so the second time I added an extra 1 c flour and an extra tsp of yeast. Otherwise everything else was the same.  The density & rising was perfect the second time (even after brushing with egg).  The taste remained delicious.  Thank you.

Delicious! A great first, braided challah. We added 1/2 cup flour (it was all-purpose) as suggested by others, 580 grams in total on a kitchen scale. Also we used 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter, melted, and 1/4 cup oil. Making sure it wasn’t hotter than 110’ before adding, to protect the yeast.

I made 1/2 the recipe (one loaf) and it came out wonderfully. A little dab of cream cheese and you have a great snack. I took off a star because I needed about 1/4 more flour on the dough, plus you have to be prepared that even with good kneading it might be a touch sticky. Put poppy seeds on top.

Loved this recipe- but only with addition of extra flour.  I also threw in a few threads of saffron for the colour and flavour.  With the extra flour the bread had that Challah flavour and texture that  I love.

This was fabulous! I used coconut oil and increased the flour to nearly 5 cups because it's been so humid here. I also made one large braid instead of two smaller ones and baked it for 40 minutes. Other than that, I used the recipe as written and was very pleased with the results!

Made this one time and followed the directions pretty closely. Only changes I made was using a stick of butter instead of vegetable oil and used less sugar but more honey and some dark agave sweetener. The taste of this first attempt at Challah bread was phenomenal, but the texture was weird. Unfortunately, I hadn't read the reviews before I got started to be warned about the sticky texture. I baked it anyway, although it was globular looking loaf as braiding it like regular Challah seemed impossible.

Lesson learned. Second attempt I once again replaced vegetable oil with butter and cut down on white sugar and added more honey, but no agave nectar since I'm out. I also added about 1/2 cup extra  flour and an extra half pack of yeast. I just took it out of the bread machine and must say the texture now is ON POINT! I easily braided it this time and this will probably make a beautiful loaf! I'm letting it rise now and haven't baked it and tasted it, but since the ingredients are pretty much the same  I think it will still taste awesome, the half cup flour shouldn't change the taste much (I hope). I just wanted to write this review so I could remember how I got the good texture before I forget it.

Something went horribly wrong with this recipe.  I followed the ingredients and instructions to the letter.  The dough was so soft it was like cookie dough.  I could not form the loaves and it never did rise.  This is the first time of cooking for 60 years that I threw away the dough.

This is our go-to bread recipe.  We both love it and I don't buy store bought bread any more.  No changes in the recipe, but some ideas:  1.  poke a hole with your finger in the flour and place the yeast in the hole.  2.  beat the eggs lightly before putting them in the canister.  3.  I bake the breads in bread pans so that they turn out higher but perhaps not as long.  I use poppy seeds or sesame seeds after coating the breads with egg wash before baking.

I make this all the time I premeasure most of the ingredients and put into appropriate containers plastic bags.  When I want to make it all I have to do is grab the pre measured ingredients and into the bread maker they go.  
My family loves this recipie and I make it all the time not just for Shabbat

Very easy Challah recipe. Made it 3 times. It was a  little sticky twice, but I added about a tablespoon of flour to the finished dough right after it came out of the bread pan and it was easy to work with. Made braided loaves and rolls and one loaf in a bread pan. Added poppy seeds to the top of the last loaf. Will use this again. Next one with  Sesame seeds. Thanks for the great recipe.

Fairly simple. I read other reviews which said to add more flour, and I wish I hadn't. I ended up only adding 1/4 cup extra, but had a tough time "rolling" the dough into the braid pieces. I did end up with two loaves and froze one before the rising stage.

Got rave reviews from my housemates on this one. The first time I didn't grease the tray properly but it was still delicious. I did two triple braids and stacked them, which worked fine. The second time it was very humid so the dough came out too sticky. I over floured it trying to get the rolls to stay intact while doing a single 6-braid (which was not worth the hassle), and then over-baked it trying to get the top to brown more. It still came out well though despite my missteps.

This was really great, nice flavor and texture!  I changed the water to milk and used 1 cup of white whole wheat and 3 cups of bread flour. The salt in this recipe is far too much.  I reduced it to 2 tsp and still will reduce it more next time.   Will make again with above changes.  Had a bit of a sticky dough, but just used a little flour on the board and hands to remedy.

I attempted to make this in my Zojirushi.  It came out a crumbly mess that I couldn't even hand knead into usable dough. I noticed that all the reviews seem to say that the dough is too sticky or wet, I can't see how that is at all possible. I did the recipe exactly as written.

Very tasty and it just disappeared. I did several of the Challah
recipes with my bread machine. I brought it to our lenten
soup supper. This one was the best of all. I also didn't like
the really sticky dough. I added more flour, just didn't measure it. Thank you to the one's that said add 1/2 a cup. I had bought Red Star Bread Machine Yeast and finally tried, since my other yeast was almost gone. I love it. I like making the two breads from this recipe.

Best challah recipe ever!  Finished challah has great elasticity and is not too sweet. I used ordinary, all purpose, unbleached flour and also needed to add 1/2 cup more than recipe calls for. I used 3 tsp of yeast in all. Dough will rise substantially while in the oven. It turned out perfectly. Note: dough has to be a bit sticky in order to roll nice ropes for braiding. Use flour sparingly for rolling and braiding. Enjoy! We sure did!

I have reviewed this bread before, it's one of our favourites. I did say that I made no changes, however, I've read so many reviews complaining about the dough being too sticky. As I'm quite experienced with my machine now, I never put ingredients in and walk away. It's always a good idea to stick around until the dough is just about mixed, but the machine is still kneading. Check the dough to judge if you need to add flour or water at this stage and scrape away any flour from the sides that the machine hasn't managed to include. Do this, and you should have a perfect dough every time. Bear in mind that the  dough for challah is slightly more sticky.

I needed almost one more cup of flour.  Flavor is nice which is why I gave it three stars. The current ratio produces a dough that is much too sticky to work with.

I baked two loaves last night and had one of them for breakfast this morning. We've been buying challah in London for a few years and mine was the best . Simply  Delicious.
I agree with the comments about the dough being sticky which makes it difficult to plait. Next time I 'll add that extra 1/2 cup of flour which should improve consistency.

This challah tastes great, but the recipe does take some finessing. I have to add between .5 to 1 cup extra flour or else the dough is far too wet when it comes out of the bread machine. I often substitute maple syrup for honey since I don't have honey on hand, and that's it for modifications. Good challah.

This is my favorite challah recipe - I use it weekly and get rave reviews. I only gave it 4 stars bc as it is written, it's not as good as I make it :). Add more honey, some extra flour (including 1/2 cup whole wheat flour instead of all white flour), and 2 TBSP of yeast (instead of teaspoons) for the perfect challah. Mine doesn't end up rising as much as other challah - and if I cook it perfectly (350 for 23 minutes or so), it comes out deliciously sticky and sweet. Pieces pull apart and guests keep coming back for more!

I've been using this challah recipe in my bread maker for over 4 years and every time, the dough comes out wonderful!  It's never been too sticky for me.  A little more flour helps me to roll out the strands easily.  Sometimes I mix the flours (white & stone ground whole wheat) and it still works just as well.  After the machine is finished mixing, kneading & rising the dough, I braid it in a six-strand braid, let it rise some more, brush it with the egg wash, put sesame seeds on and bake it.  I've never had a failure with this recipe or this method of braiding.  It's simple, easy to make, and yields delicious challah.  A Jewish friend told me it looks just like the challah his mother made when he was growing up.  I must be doing something right!

Having read previous comments, I knew this recipe might come out wet and sticky.  It was extremely wet and I added quite a bit of flour during initial cycle.  However it really did not rise.  I baked it in a bread pan.  It did not bake well  and the center was not done.  I usually have good luck with other well rated recipes, but I was very disappointed in this one.

Outrageously good! I see no reason to ever use another bread recipe. Usually I find homemade bread bland and disappointing, but this is great and the texture was perfect. I know some people have mentioned consistency problems, but mine was perfect - flour is finicky. On a relatively dry, cold day, my dough was smooth and satiny and perfect, and I used all of the proportions listed in the recipe (maybe a bit more salt). Thank you so much - great recipe!

Really delicious! I halved the recipe to make one loaf and did as said and it came out beautifully and was almost completely gone in 10 minutes. The only reason it wasn't all eaten so fast was because I saved a piece for my mom. I'll definitely make this recipe again.

I've tried this Challah two times, because of the overall rating on the site. The first time, I did not change a thing, and it came out soupy. The second time I added 3/4 of a cup more flour as suggested by other reviewers, but still the bread is just not good.  Even after rising, it is much to dense for a good challah.  I will stick to my original recipe and not try this one again.

This is absolutely the best recipe for Challah. I have made this recipe many times and it always comes out excellent.No tweaking needed, it is perfect as is. I let my loaves rise on my gas stove resting on a pot so they don't get too warm. Thanks for such a wonderful, tasty recipe!

After reading the other reviews, I added an extra 1/2 cup of flour.  Other than that I followed the recipe.  I don't have the instructions to my bread machine, so I put in all the dry ingredients and then the wet.  I set the dough setting and left it.  I let the dough rise in my oven, covered in a dishtowel.  (Preheated the oven to 120).  I made rolls instead of a large loaf.  The rolls were good, kind of dense though.  Challah is a little lighter.  The flavor is very good though.

I made this bread twice: 1st time dough was sticy added flour but it did not rise enough. 2nd time added more flour little less water and oil still did not rise enough.  Going to try again with more yeast. Even through all of this it still was the best tasting sweet bread I've ever made. I was making it my traditional coffee can method for EASTER BLESSED BREAD.

This is my favorite challah ever! I don't have a bread machine so I mix it and knead it by hand, then place in a covered oiled bowl for an hour and a half, punch it down to get out air bubbles, then let it rise for another 30 minutes before braiding it. Every time I make the challah everybody loves it and always asks for the recipe. This past shabbat the challah was literally gone in under 1 minute.

I made this 2 weeks ago and added one cup of whole wheat flour to the recipe. It tasted heavenly! I froze one challah and used it last week. It has frozen the best out of any other challah I have tried to freeze in the past. The thing is to wrap it well before putting it in the freezer. It is hard to find good bread machine challah's but this was def one of the best I have eaten!!!

WOW!  What an easy recipe!  I did have to add extra flour during the beginning of the cycle, but I have to either add more water or dough to EVERY recipe in the bread maker to get the dough to be the right consistency :)  Fresh out of the oven this bread is DIVINE!!

This recipe is great!  Using the bread machine to make the dough makes this so simple with impressive results.  Challah bread is so good toasted with butter and jam, as french toast, or even in your favorite bread pudding recipe.  This is a bread I will make over and over.

The best! My husband and I almost stood in front of the oven and ate the whole thing warm. Just melts in the mouth. No butter or extras needed - tastes perfect all by itself. And so easy. Thanks so much for this recipe.

This is an excellent, very easy bread to make.  My granddaughter helped me make the bread and loved it so much that she took my bread machine home with her.

Love it! I added two extra spoons of flour and before kneading I rubbed into my hands olive oil to prevent sticking.
Thank you so much for sharing this great recipe!

Easy to follow recipe and the bread was delicious.  I followed it to the letter and had no difficulties at all.  The honey was a nice addition and gave the bread just a touch more sweetness which is the way I remember it from buying it at the bakery.

I made this bread exactly as the recipe indicates.  I used the dough setting on my bread machine and then proofed and baked.  The Jewish family I made this for was ecstatic.  I'm going back for my fourth jewish holiday with their family and they always want me to bring a loaf.  I have no complaints.  Sticky doughs require extra flour on the surface you are using it on and on your hands.  I find that with a small bowl of flour on the side I can keep it from being sticky and it turns out lovely.

This was just okay. Not great, not bad per se. I have been having bad luck with bread lately, so maybe it was just me. Didn't rise nearly like the picture implies. And yeah, the dough was REALLY sticky. I may have added too much flour at the kneading stage, but I don't think I would bother making this again.

The dough was extremely sticky but after adding a ton of flour to it, it became workable and we were able to braid it. The end product was delicious though.

Very good, easy recipe.  This recipe is also good by adding one cup of whole wheat flour to replace one of the cups of white flour.

Yummy yummy. Be sure you use bread flour, otherwise the dough might be too sticky. When I first tried this recipe I halved it and the loaf did not rise. I tried it again as written and it was perfect. My daughter's nursery school class ate a loaf for snack and not a crumb was left!

I've made this several times and it's always a big hit with my family.  I don't have a breadmachine, I just mix it up by hand.  Great texture & it makes wonderful day-after open faced pb sandwiches.

Excellent recipe. I've made challah in my bread machine before using the recipe that came with the machine but this is so much better. I use High-Gluten flour which I find makes it nice and dense. It's a huge hit in my house! Thank you!
