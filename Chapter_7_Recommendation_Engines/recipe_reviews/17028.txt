These were extremely tasty!  I used a 16oz can of "Grands" biscuits and I still had over half of the chicken mixture left, so I made "wraps" with tortillas and froze them for quick lunches.

i always have a hard time with the folding over of the biscuits. they always end up lookig messy. so instead i pressd the biscuits in muffin tins, baked for a few minutes until they started puffing up..then i took them out pressed them into the muffin tins again. when they were about 4 minutes from being done i added the chicken, salsa and cheese. the only regret i have is i didnt make enough.

Pretty good.  My 6-year-old loved it!  I only used 1 cup of cheese in the sauce, and next time I would use a Mexican blend or something that melts better than Cheddar.  I ended up flattening my biscuits (regular size not Grands) and putting them in greased muffin cups.  Spoon in filling, sprinkle with cheese and bake.

i used "grand" style biscuits, boiled chicken breast tenders and "medium" salsa. i also added garlic salt, pepper and sour cream to the mixture. this was enough to eat as a decent dinner, since the biscuits were larger. but, i'd suggest using tortillas instead, like others have mentioned, since this tastes just like a chicken enchilada or chicken taco. very easy and quick dish to assemble.

I cooked my chicken in 1 cup chicken broth and seasoned it with chili powder, cumin and salt and cooked till very tender.  I was afraid the mixture might end up a bit dry so I added 2 tbsp. flour to the onion as it cooked, then added a can of undrained diced green chilis, 1/2 cup sour cream, the cheese and salsa.  I added the shredded chicken back to this mixture and used this as my filling.  I flattened the bisquits, put some filling down the center and rolled them like little burritos, securing with a toothpick.  Everyone thought they were great.  Good warmed up as leftovers too.

This is a great recipe! Very quick & easy! My 1 year old even loved it! I'm going to try this recipe again, but this time I'm going to try the chicken mixture in flour tortillas (enstead of biscuits) and add jack cheese to it. Then they will be chicken soft tacos!

This is delicious!  I had about 1/3 of the chicken mixture left when I ran out of biscuits - maybe I didn't flatten them enough?  If you make everything on a smaller scale, they would be great as appetizers.

My husband, son and I loved this recipe, but I found it very difficult to put the chicken/cheese/salsa mixture in the biscuit.  I even flattened the biscuit more! Next time I will just use flour tortillas like others have suggested!  (I didn't add the onion since the salsa had enough in it!)
Thank you for a wonderful tasting recipe!
(I used Grand Biscuits)

This is a really tasty recipe that you can spice up with hot salsa or jalapeno jack cheese. We loved it! It's not the type of thing you'd want to have as a leftover (the biscuit becomes soggy upon reheating), but you don't have to worry about that because there's never any left when you're done! It's too good!

Thanks for the recipe!  It's very simple & my family loved it.  I'll definitely make this again.  Note:  I couldn't help but play with the ingredients just a little... I added a heaping spoon of sour cream to the chicken mixture plus some cilantro & poultry seasoning.

Chicken turned out tasty but realized I altered the recipe without knowing. I cooked onions added salsa and cooked chicken and continued to cook. Then added 1 cup cheese. Then purposefully changed this part...(Would have used grands) Rolled out biscuit, placed in muffin tin, put tablespoon of refried beans in bottom and cooked 5 min. Then added about 2 tablespoons of chicken and topped with remaining cheese and cooked 5 min or till the brown edges. LOVED IT!  Empanada like!

The final result turned out really good! I did change somethings. I was short on time so I used canned chicken, threw in some salsa, cheese, sour cream, chili powder, and also chopped up a small amount of red bell peppers and threw that in as well.  The peppers made this dish! I used the biscuits and put chicken mixture on half then folded over and pinched the seam together. It made a great home made hot pocket.

I used this recipe as a base to create a casserole-type dish that was done lasagna-style. I has leftover potatoes from "Bubbles and Squeak" recipe on AR (I'd left them as mashed potatoes for lack of time) and spread the entire amount I had on the bottom of a glass baking dish. Then went on to cook the chicken, which I first seasoned with homemade taco seasoning, then pan-fried until done. Chopped it up, placed in a bowl then added salsa, cheddar cheese & cottage cheese. Skipped the onion as there was some in the potatoes and salsa. I made a biscuit dough using the Bisquick mix and stretched it out over the top. This was a great way to use leftovers and things I had on hand. Without the additional seasonings I this would've been bland, as some reviews pointed out. Of course, homemade biscuit dough and fresh salsa would make this dish shine. Keeping on file for a night when I need something quick to toss together.

Very tasty! Easy to make, I followed the advice of using a muffin tin and just pushed the biscuits down after baking a few minutes, this created a pocket for the chicken, and backed beautifully... it also made great leftovers, I didn't have a problem with soggy biscuits. I served it with Spanish rice and sour cream. Will def make again!

This recipe was ok.  We enjoyed it tonight, but it probably won't make our regular menu list.  I followed the recipe pretty closely only changing the way I cooked my chicken. I seasoned and grilled it, then chopped it in the food processor because I prefer the flavor of grilled chicken to boiled chicken.  I would suggest trying tortillas in place of the biscuits and serving with additional burrito/taco toppings like guacamole, sour cream, beans, etc.  I think it would work well as an appetizer if made smaller in a biscuit or tortilla.

Totally kid friendly!  My picky 5-year old ate two.  I made it without onions, because my family doesn't like them, but I will absolutely make this again.  Maybe with ground beef or crescent rolls, maybe a little taco seasoning.  I don't have enough biscuits for the rest of the mixture, but I'll use what's left with tortillas and maybe a little sour cream.

This is pretty easy and enjoyable!  I don't think a single can of biscuit dough is enough to use all the chicken mix, though; we ended up using crescent roll dough to wrap these, and then put the rest in a 9-inch pie pan with Jiffy biscuit dough on top.

Super yummy chicken!!! It is great with the biscuits (I had my doubts :))  Looking forward to using the leftovers (there will be a LOT) in tortilla wraps and salads!

I used chicken taco seasoning as some suggested.  That along with the salsa really added a little kick to the meat. I took Pillsbury Grand biscuits, sliced them in half.  Put 1/2 in the bottom of a muffin tin, added the filling and topped with the other 1/2.

Awesome!  I didn't measure the cheese or salsa, just put in what looked good, and I scaled it down to one chicken breast (all I had defrosted). I made my own biscuit mix- Easy Biscuit Mixture from this site.  My husband and I couldn't stop eating these and can't wait to make them again! They'd be good- and easy- for lunches.

I really enjoyed the filling. It wasn't bad in the biscuits, but I prefered eating it in a tortilla. I'll probably make this again with out the biscuits. I also added sour cream to the mix as others suggested.

This was a great fast recipe. I used chicken thighs and shredded them after boiling. I used the flakey rolls in the can (all I had) and I had a lot of mixture left over too so I just a little on top of each one. It didn't matter when it bubbled out, it worked great! I served it on top of spicy mexi rice with jalapenos and put refried beans and sour cream on top! Excellent! My boyfriend said it was better than any thing at the popular mexican restaurant in town! Thanks Becke.

My sister-in-law (we're both addicted to allrecipes!) made this for her kids one evening when I was over & I had a bite of the chicken mixture... the inside had an excellent taste, but due to the high calorie content I'm giving it a lower grade. I read some of the other reviews & many people have said they give this to their kids as a "snack". Well in no way is something that is 1200 calories & 63g fat considered a snack- its a future full of diabetes and obesity! I would suggest using the mini-muffin pan idea that came from another reviewer & bring it to a potluck. There is nothing nutritional about this meal.

This was really good, I also made some "pizza style" with mozzarella and pizza sauce and they were soooooo yummy.

I made it with pinto beans and omitted the chicken.  My husband and daughter  loved it!  Personally, I was surprise the flavor was so good for such an easy recipe. Will do again.

Yummy!  I used drained, canned chicken breast and didn't sautee the onions so this was a snap to make.  I heated up a can of refried beans and served it with a premix salad and we were eating in less than 30 minutes time!  As others said, it does make WAY more filling than needed for one can of biscuits.  I froze the extra to make this meal even easier next time!

It was a different way to serve lunch. I got better as I rolled out more of the biscuts. I used the Pillsbury Grands so I had bigger wraps. We will try again.

Great tasting.  Made this for a meal the 1st time and my husband LOVED it!! Made it for a Bunko gathering too and it got rave reviews.  Ran out of Salsa so I replaced it with 1/2 can stewed tomatoes and juice.  Turned out great!!! Will make again and again.

This is tasty and easy.  I used Grands biscuits and stretched them out, filled them and pinched the seams together and layed them seam side down on the baking sheet, since I didn't have any toothpicks.  Worked great!  Next time I'll add diced chiles for a little kick, or hotter salsa.

Great recipe! A lot of people said they had trouble rolling out the biscuits, so I used a little flour and this worked out great.  I used Grands Flaky Biscuits and split each biscuit in half.  Used all the biscuits and still had left-over filling, which I froze. I served sour cream and salsa on the side.  I can envision using other fillings, as well.

Great recipe, the instructions are a little vague as to how to cook the chicken, but we just stuck it in a frying pan with some butter and it went good.. The Salsa taste outrules most of the chicken, but it really had a unique taste to it.

This was great.  My kids thought it tasted like pizza pie.  I doubled it for our family of 8, but it really makes a lot and we have lots of leftovers.  Instead of messing with individual pieces of biscuit dough I did it "lasagna" style. I made two 9x13 sheets of biscuit dough, put one on the bottom of a 9x13 baking pan, put the filling on top of that, then put the other layer of biscuit dough on top of that.  It was easy & very tasty! It would have been even easier if I'd have bought some of the biscuit dough that comes in a sheet but homemade was just as good.

Pretty good.  Extremely easy, too.  I used my own dough that I had made and made about 4 little rolls.  I didn't have enough bread for the salsa mix, so I froze the rest of it for later.  They can get soggy when storing if you aren't careful, but they heat up just fine in the microwave.  Thanks for the recipe!

Good for a base-recipe, and a different way to eat chicken- a taco/casserole/sandwich that my husband and 3 yo liked! For filling I used one chicken breast and added cilantro, cumin, and black beans- but endless variations are possible! I made biscuits from mix and rolled out 1/4" thick, cut into squares and folded over the filling. (Bisquick biscuits for 2)  Be prepared with flour- this is sticky! Also had to cook closer to 20 min.

These were okay, although I probably won't make them again.  I seasoned the chicken with taco seasoning and added sour cream to the chicken mixture, as recommended by others.

Yummy. I seasoned the chicken with mexican seasoning. Added sour cream and diced jalepenos to mixture. Also used mexican cheese. My husband said these were excellent. I served with beans and rice and topped with sour cream. Took about 13 min to cook.
This is similar to another meal we love...chicken and shredded cheese wrapped in cresent rolls and topped with cream of chicken soup.

We enjoyed these for lunch.  I flattened Grands biscuits with my rolling pin and didn't have any trouble~ next time, I'll probably divide them in half like another reviewer suggested.  I did have nearly 1/3 of the filling left, but it worked well over nacho chips.

These were so easy and so good! The hardest part was putting them together. I used buttermilk biscuits, assembled them the same way as METRAA, and they turned out great. They would be excellent to make for a super bowl party, or as an alternative to pizza for a movie dinner. They're fun!

Had to look at this recipe because of the review questioning the nutritional value.  I may be confused as to what a serving is (2 for this recipe?) but if you use Grands biscuis (5) and cut them half as one reviewer did (10), that makes 5 of these per serving. Although the sodium level is a bit high, it makes the calorie count a little over 100 cals per biscuit.  Dividing these numbers by 10 makes them a bit easier to take.   Other than the cheese I'm not sure where all the sodium comes from.  Oh yes, they were very good and supplemented with a salad and fruit they made a tasty supper.

I like to mix the ingredients together and serve the chicken over the biscuits instead of rolled in them.  Both ways are really good.

This was soooo yummy! I followed the recipe to the letter and added sautéed mushrooms. After rolling out the jumbo biscuits, I was able to stretch them out further, add filling, and pinched the dough closed. It opened slightly while baking, but they turned out perfect!! Thank you so much for an easy, very tasty recipe!

The biscuits didn't really work out very well. But the filling was really good in a torilla. I used peach, mango salsa and it was really good.

Yummy and so easy!  I added a packet of taco seasoning, some sour cream, and used canned chicken because that's all I had. Served with black beans and guacamole. Husband and 3 kids (5,3,& 1) loved it!

This was good, but I recommend adding some salt, chili powder, cilantro, and maybe some taco seasoning. I also added some minced jalapeño peppers to it. This would have been really plain without adding all the stuff I did.

I made homemade biscuit dough instead of buying premade. I thought the flavors were really good. I added a little crushed red ppr to the chicken while it cooked for a spicier flavoered chicken. I also tried the recomendation of another to use muffins tins to form the biscuit... glad I tried that the first time around. I think I might try turning into a pie next time. Toddler loved it.

Great recipe.  I omitted the onion and used a three-bean salsa.  Had about 1/2 of the mix leftover, so will double the biscuits next time.  Served with a salad for an easy and yummy meal.

I followed the recipe, I used Kirkland brand salsa and they were excellent! I served with a mix of sour cream and Franks hot sauce with rice. Thanks, we’ll make these again!

I changed the recipe a lot but the overall outcome anytime I make this is delicious. This time I used ground beef with simmered onions and added a can of corn (pat dry with paper towel), a can of black beans with jalapeños, chopped tomatoes with cilantro and lime juice (bought in a can), a lot of cliantro, some cumin and taco seasoning, and almost a full jar of hot salsa. I made little dough balls around the taco stuffing and used cheese to seal the tops when baking. Top with sour cream and hot sauce. Delicious and easy leftover meals for this week.

Very good, preparation time is out as it said prep time was 20 minutes, but it took 20 minutes to boil the chicken, found prep was 60 minutes in total.

Amazing! Flaky and delicious with the ability to make it spicy or not based on your salsa choice.

I swapped the chicken with Johnsonville Mild Ground Sausage.  I read several reviews that said there was a lot of extra filling - so I was prepared for that. I put the extra in the fridge and I'm going to make nachos tonight! Yum!  Very easy but really really tasty!  I will definitely be making it again!  6 Ingredients or Less - can't beat that!

My family LOVED this! I used Grand's biscuits, and used a roller to flatten them out (made them easier to roll). I also added 2 tablespoons of sour cream. DELICIOUS! I see other reviews suggest using tortillas instead of biscuits, and I agree that would be tasty and easier. However, I really enjoyed the extra flavor that the biscuits added.
