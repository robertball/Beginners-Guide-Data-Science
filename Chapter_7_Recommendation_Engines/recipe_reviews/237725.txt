In this world there are many fine recipes.  Then there are recipes considered a staple for the kitchen.  This is such a recipe.
What comfort there is knowing when this tuna confit is on hand ready for a variety of sandwich, salad and pasta recipes or as a satisfying snack with crackers.

So easy and so good! My husband and I always sear ahi or eat it raw, so this was a nice change. For herbs, I used garlic, oregano and basil -- what I had on hand. I used the leftover oil to make a salad dressing and served the fish thinly sliced on greens with tomatoes. The only hard part was the waiting. Thanks, Chef John!

I made this exactly as suggested in recipe then I use for any recipe that calls for canned tuna.  I use the oil over and over just for this dish keeping it in refrig.   Tuna taste better than canned and things like tuna casserole and tuna sandwiches taste better

This was a delicious way to prepare Tuna and one that I will be using again.  I look forward to making this for recipes like Nicoise Salad & Spaghetti al Tonno!

Not hard at all! I could not get fresh ahi tuna so I used frozen (thawed) filets. Everything else as written.
The finished product had a pale pink tint in the center and was nice and flakey.  I used it to make Mac, cheese and tuna casserole. It was very good. I will add more herbs to the next batch.
I also love that the oil can be strained and reused.

I used yellowfin steaks and prepared as per recipe.  I prepared Tuna Helper with it and it was real tasty.

I followed the directions and enjoyed the tuna.  Perhaps my steaks were too thick because they never got cooked in the middle.
