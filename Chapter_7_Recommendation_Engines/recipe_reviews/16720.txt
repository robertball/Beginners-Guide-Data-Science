My husband is the biggest kid/picky eater out there.  The first time I made these, they were a bit dry.  I always used half a recipie, cuz it's just the two of us until our daughter gets older.  Well, I added 1 tsp of vanilla extract.  It was just the kick it needed!

I couldn't think of a faster, easier way to make light and fluffy biscuits.  I even substitited margarine for shortening and they were still perfect!

I used butter-flavor crisco and buttermilk instead of milk.  These were surprisingly tender but a little bland.  I won't make them again.

This was by far, the absolute best biscuit that I have ever had. It was light and airy. It has a wonderful delicate flavor and my half loved them as well. This is a keeper. Oh, and did I mention it was super easy?

Recipe is great, however I did add some cinnimon and a little bit of sugar just to give it some added taste, as I used this for a breakfast biscuit one day.  Very quick and easy

Great biscuits that are easy to make.  I'm glad to find a good biscuit recipe that does not call for buttermilk--which I never have.  Also, my son can't tolerate milk so I used soy milk and they turned out great.  Thanks for this recipe!

MMMMmmm. Biscuits just like I had as a kid. I followed the recipe exactly (except I used slightly less than 1 tablespoon of baking powder). I was very happy with how they turned out. For people who like moist biscuits, you might need to add slightly more shortening and milk because this recipe makes traditional-style baking powder biscuits which are, by nature, fairly airy and dry. I have also added 1 tablespoon of italian herbs (anything will do, basil, oregano, thyme) and mixed it in with the flour before adding the shortening. It gave these biscuits a lovely herbed taste! Will make these simple and delicious biscuits again and again. (My husband raved about them.)

Good flavor but kinda dry. Had a nice appearance and smelled good, the kids did not care for them because they were so dry.

The biscuit recipe as written was okay.  I made modifications which I felt were improvements both in taste and for health, but I didn't consider the mods in the rating.  Here are the modifications: 1.) substituted grapeseed oil for shortening  2.) substituted whole wheat flour for white flour  3.) added a tsp of garlic  4.) added 1/4 C of cheddar cheese.  5.) Whenever I add cheddar cheese, I slightly decrease the salt since the cheese has salt - but not everyone would agree with the need to decrease the salt in that case  6.) Instead of dropping them, I divide the dough into the number of biscuits, then roll each lump of dough into a ball.  Then I flatten each ball somewhat so it's similar to a biscuit shape.  This results in a more uniform shape than a drop biscuit, while eliminating the need to roll them out with a rolling pin.  
OBSERVATIONS:. A.)  Using grapeseed oil, I find the baking sheet does not need to be oiled.
B.) With the whole wheat and the extra cheese, they need the full 15 minutes to cook.  
C.) The best part is the leftovers, which toast nicely after being split the next day.
Update 2012-01-08: Tonight I ran out of whole wheat flour so I used All Purpose flour. Since they were going to be used with butter and jam, I didn't add the garlic or cheese.  However, I still used the grapeseed oil.  What a difference compared to shortening!  They were great! Light and crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and much more flavorful.

The taste is not all that great, I had a little too much baking powder in it and that ruined everything...But it is certainly easy and fast.

I hate shortening. I always use butter when a recipe calls for shortening because it bakes almost identically, and the flavour is so much richer. I have used this recipe dozens of times. It is very versatile. Simply add some cheddar for a cheese drop biscuit. You can actually roll this dough out if you roll it between 2 sheets of wax paper sprayed with cooking spray. Spread melted butter, brown sugar and cinnamon on the rolled out dough, roll it cup, cut and bake for quick, flaky cinnamon buns. Place thinly rolled dough on a cornmeal dusted baking sheet and top with pizza sauce, mozza and your favourite pizza topping for a quick, and easy pizza. It's definitely less co-operative than working with a yeast risen dough, but if you're in a pinch and creative with your modifications it's a whole lot faster and very tasty. UPDATE: New variation - Roll flat, spread with pesto sauce and top with about 1/4 cup of mozzarella and a sprinke of parmesan. Bake, slice into fingers and serve with marinara as a dip. Lovely!

These biscuits were very simple and easy to make and tasted great. I liked the "drop" shape although we did form some of them so they did not look too wild. Flaky and good with butter.

These were the easiest, best biscuits I have ever made.  I needed a quick bread to go with my dinner, so I added a little garlic powder and cheese like a previous reviewer suggested and my husband LOVED them. Sprayed a little butter on top and they resembled the biscuits you get at Red Lobster!!!  Yummmyyy.... thanks Anne

I made these biscuits and from this 1 experience, I will not use a 450F. degree oven again. I had to open all the windows/doors to get smoke out.  I think 425F would have been plenty.   I shaped the biscuits to fairly large size, put them on parchment paper as per usual and in 1/2 the cooking time, they were burning and the smoke was horrendous.   The paper burned more than the bottoms of the biscuits but just wanted to share this bit of info just to help someone else preventing them going through the same thing.  Will definitely try these again though maybe without paper next time to see what happens.   I'm sure they're very tasty.

I opted out of using shortening and instead went with the suggestion of using butter that was frozen and grated. The middle of the biscuits were tender. And the flavor was nice and light.  These biscuits were not overly salty or strange tasting as the canned biscuits can be.

These biscuits were really good.  Actually, I didn't make them as biscuits.  I made a recipe I learned from my Home Ec. class called Bubblecake and it called for refridgerator biscuits.  But I decided to use homemade.  Anyways, the Bubblecake came out really bad.  But the biscuit part was delicious and I will definitely use this recipe to make actual biscuits.  I am going to try adding an 1/8 tsp. of garlic powder and a handful of cheddar cheese- it will be so good!  Anyways, I would definitely recommend these- they have Popeye's biscuit texture.  Very delicious with butter.

This is the same recipe I use for making gravy and biscuits.  The only thing I do differently is use the butter flavored crisco.  Very yummy!
Oh, also I roll them out and cut them!

I make these at least 1x a month.  They are great for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  I no longer buy frozen biscuits.  What makes these taste even better is adding softened butter to the mixture before baking.

I made with about 1 cup of cheddar cheese and a couple of teaspoons of the minced garlic that you buy in a jar.  They were fabulous!!  I can't wait to make them again tonight!  My husband said that they were better than the restaurant ones!!

The recipe as written requires too much baking powder. You can taste the baking powder in the final product, it is repulsive. Also these biscuits are really dry. They might be useful to sop up something like stew, but definitely are not the biscuits you want to cook for breakfast. I give this recipe a two because it provides a basic framework for biscuits with few ingredients, and which you can adjust by preferences.

These are easy. My Girl Scout troop used these on a camping trip, but baked them "on a stick." They taste great and are super easy!

FAR too much baking soda - inedible. Will try again, with 1/2 or 1/4 the baking soda.

This is wonderful, versatile recipe! This is my variation, which has become a family favourite.

Replace the shortening with grapeseed oil, add about a tbsp of garlic powder (if desired) and cut cheddar cheese into cubes and incorporate into the batter.  Delicious!

Good tasty biscuits!  I grated 1/4C of frozen margarine, added some grated cheddar and a couple of teaspoons of dried rosmary.  They smell wonderful while they bake!

Excellent base recioe. I substituted buttermilk for the milk. I also had the convenience of having self rising flour and used it instead of all the little extras added to the flour.

Fantastic!  I used salted butter to add extra flavour, grated the butter right into the flour, replaced part of the milk with plain 2% yogurt (adding liquid until the dough was quite wet), and scooped them onto the cookie sheet with a medium ice cream scoop.  This yielded 16 fluffy and tasty biscuits with a perfect crunchy exteriour.  My southern husband said they were perfect!

I finally made the perfect biscuits with this recipe!I have tried so many variations of recipes and this is the only one that turned out.  The only thing I would change is I recommend rolling out the dough and cutting it instead of using the spoonfuls.

Great recipe for home made biscuits.  Especially good if you have some gravy to put on top.  Otherwise, find a way to kick these up a notch.  I put in cheddar cheese, garlic powder and italian seasoning and the biscuits tasted like the ones at Red Lobster.  (So good)

Thank you Anne for your easy Biscuit recipe. I had been looking for something that was fast easy to make and the taste was great! My family enjoyed the biscuit very much that I had to double the recipe. I added garlic and cheese to your recipe and the taste was great. Thank you again

I was eager to try this recipe as I've just moved to New Zealand from Georgia and was missing the taste of country biscuits! The recipe was simple and inexpensive, and I liked that as well. My only complaint is that the biscuits were slightly greasy, but only slightly. My guests didn't know the difference, though, and gobbled them up immediately! I served them with fried chicken and garlic mashed potatoes. They tasted wonderful, just like back home. I'll definitely make them again.

I really liked this recipe, and my hard to please husband just raved about these. All these years, I've been making Bisquik biscuits. These are much better. I added about 1/8 tsp. garlic powder, and a handful of mozzerella cheese. They came out moist and delicious. I am making them again today!

I was almost done with a turkey dinner and realized we had no bread or biscuits. In a hurry I threw this together. I used margerine instead of shortening and added a bit of garlic powder and 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese. This made the BEST garlic cheddar biscuits I have ever had! Thanks for this recipe!

This recipe was great.  I am a Girl Scout leader for a troop of 2nd graders.  They have been working on earning their cooking badge.  I searched and searched for an easy biscuit recipe that I could use instead of pizza dough for them to make their own individual pizzas.  This worked great!!  The kids loved it and they tasted great!! Very easy for them to pat into pizza shape and add toppings!

Not bad, but definitely needs some tweaking. The dough (pre-milk) was way too dry so I added a little butter (it wouldn't even form into the pea sized clumps without the butter) I also added a little sugar but they were sill a little bland. Next time I think I'll use half butter/ half shortening add a bit more salt and a little more sugar. The texture was nice though and they got a nice golden brown top.

I really like this recipe because it's so simple.  I prepare the dry ingredients in ziploc bags and leave them on the shelf, then when I want to make quick biscuits, I pour a bag into a bowl.  Instead of shortening, I use 1/4 cup of margarine and kind of chop it in with a butter knife.  Then I mix in the milk and that's it.  I spoon the mix into a muffin pan to make it look pretty.  Very basic, but a great time saver!

These were good. I added about 1 tblsp white sugar, just becasue most biscuits usually call for that) and I turned them into cheese biscuits by adding about 3/4 cup grated cheddar. They seemed a little moist, so I added an extra couple tblsp of flour, and they turned out great. I made 6 giant biscuits to go with stew. Perfect :)

If you're looking for flaky, moist biscuits, this is not going to be your go to recipe.  I have been searching for a recipe that would result in biscuits like I remember from grade school (always served with beef stew).  They were dry and just perfect for soaking up the stew.  This recipe is it.  I love them.  Super simple to throw together (less than 5 minutes).  I use my food processor for the entire recipe and it makes for easy cleanup.  Thanks!

These were so simple and quick to make.  The timing listed on the site here is not correct as they don't take 30 minutes to prepare.  I've already made them a few times and they turn out perfectly.

This is my go-to biscuit recipe. I always have the simple ingredients on hand and I jazz it up however I need to. I've done a garlic-cheddar modification that is dangerously good. And I use this recipe, with about a tablespoon of dried sage added, to top chicken pot pie (just drop the heaping spoonfuls on top of the filling and bake as the pot pie recipe directs).

I used a little less milk- less than 3/4 c to make roll and cut biscuits. I used these to make mini pot pies. I diced up some leftover chicken, added some gravy, peas and carrots, put it in a ramekin and topped it with an uncooked biscuit. 450 degrees for 10 minutes. These biscuits were just what I was looking for, thanks!

I loved this easy recipe, but I only made it for 6 biscuits since it's just hubby and I.  I also used cold butter instead of shortening, since I can't get shotening here in Holland. I patted the dough out and made cut biscuits instead of drop style.  I found them flaky and tasty.

I have searched high and low for a Baking Powder Biscuit recipe for two years. I remember my mom making them when I was a kid. This one is great!! This is so much easier than the rolled biscuits. A really cool variation is to add 1 tsp of orange flavoring with milk and egg then to "dry" ingredients to this and enjoy with coffee or tea and some friends.

Easy to make, but not much in taste. I added shredded cheese, and topped them with garlic and butter, and still they were dry and bland. Horrible reheated!

I have to give these biscuits a three, b/c they really can't stand alone without eating something with it.  They are perfect for a meal where you want to soak up gravy or stew and would be good with soup.  By themselves they are too dry and bland.  However, they are easy and were perfect for my gravy-laden meal!  Thanks.

Super easy to make, but my family didn't care for them.  Hubby thought they tasted too floury.  I didn't like the shortening taste.

Excellent! That is all I can say. I dcided to try these out one day a few months ago, over my Christmas break from school. I made them,quick and easy, added a little bit of cheese, everyone enjoyed them. When I went back to school my mom said she wished I was home to make her some more. For mother's day she didn't want a gift, all she wanted was for me to make her some of these wonderful biscuits. Thanks Anne!

Yes, they were very quick and easy to make(my three year old helped me make them). BUT, my husband hated the taste! I'll try it again and instead I'll make a bread instead of individual biscuits.

Love this recipe. I have done this several times and it always turn out great. It's super easy and admits all the variatons you can think of. I have done this savory with cheese and thyme, yumm... And sweet with chocolate chips and dry apricots (super yumm...).  If you are looking for a biscuit recipe this is one with less fat than others, but without compromising the final result. I've always used sour milk (milk with a splash of vinegar) or plain yogurt for tender biscuits.

These came out tender and rose high. If you don't have a pastry blender to mix the flour/butter mixture, cut the cold butter in bits and mix with small fork till crumbly. Also, don't over mix the dough. Stir till combined and roll out onto lightly floured surface. Roll dough over about a 10-12 times to get smooth and cut rounds with cutter or floured rim glass. I got eight biscuits using this method.  If over mixed, they will be tough and not rise as much.

The first time I made them I mistakenly used baking soda instead of baking powder and yes they tasted like pretzels.  I made them again the correct way and tasted like actual biscuits.  I guess I made them smaller because I only had to cook mine for 8 min.

I think the  "3 tablespoons baking powder" should be "3 teaspoons."  

By the way, there is no reason to grease the baking sheet.  The finished biscuits will slide right off the sheet whether it was greased or not.

this recipe is decent. they came out very airy and delicate. but it felt too soft, like cooking rice that gets too much air. thankfully there were some crispy edges that gave it some texture. not much of a taste either.

I got a craving for some Peach Cobbler, but didnt want to go through all it takes to make it. I made this very easy biscuit recipe, and they came out soft and delicious. I used margarine for the shortning. Than I heated up some peaches, and put them on top of the biscuits, with alittle peach juice, and topped with vanilla ice cream. Im gonna call it "Easy Poor Mans Peach Cobbler", from now on, and its delicious.

These biscuits are quick and easy, although a little bland. I find that substituting butter or margarine for the shortening and adding two tablespoons of salad dressing (does not affect the taste) helps keep them moist and delicious.  The recipe may require about a 1/4 cup extra flour with these additions.

I haven't baked these as biscuits, but I did use them in chicken and dumplings. I followed the recipe exactly and made them about nickel size. They plumped up to about the size of a walnut. They were very light and about the right size. I used the whole bowl of dough and it probably made between 20 and 30 dumplings. I will keep using this recipe. Looking forward to making this as biscuits this weekend!

These biscuits are a staple for my family. Every one loves them! I use the dough hook on my mixer until the dry ingredients and crisco resemble corn meal then add the milk slowly and mix until it forms a ball. I scoop them out with an ice cream scoop for 12 perfectly sized biscuits. Also good with 1/2 tsp garlic powder and a good handful of cheddar mixed in.

I have used this recipe many times for biscuits and crusts. It always comes out with a fluffy crust with a crunchy outside and a soft inside. If you use this for crusts then remember to roll it out so that it is very thin otherwise it will take up most of your pan. It is fast and easy to make and fills in for last minute recipes.

Wonderful! I used Margarine instead of shortening. I also threw in a handful of shredded cheese. Sooo good. I pushed them into a muffin pan and it made 11 cute little biscuits. It was nice and easy. My beau will be waking up to the scent of them!

Add some finely shredded cheese and garlic powder and you have biscuit very close to Red Lobster's.

Excellent Recipe- My new go to recipe for quick baking powder biscuits. I only changed one thing- i used butter since i stay away from shortening. I turned down the oven temp by 25 degrees and i made 6 large biscuits instead of 12 little ones. Thanks for the great recipe.

Good dough, plain in flavor.  I was looking for a lighter fluffy biscuit type dumpling and used this recipe.  Dropped the dough into my leftover chicken soup and boiled for about twenty minutes covered (I like BIG dumplings) and about another ten uncovered. Worked great!

I thought they were only ok.  i used half butter (salted), half shortening.  The flavor was ok.  It was a very wet dough as far as biscuit dough goes.  As a result it did not produce a flaky biscuit and the appearance was not very attractive, even for a drop biscuit.  Ok though for so few ingredients.

We call these "pay day" biscuits at our house because as it gets closer to pay day (read: grocery shopping) we run out of other breads, but we alwayd have these ingredients on hand. I add grated cheddar cheese to min before adding the milk for a little more flavor.

These are great Biscuits- especially when slathered with jelly or honey.  I made a double batch so we could have biscuits for breakfast and my kids ate all the extras as a bedtime snack.  Great easy recipe.  Oh, i did roll them out to ensure they would be a bit more stable for little hands to hold.

These are good basic biscuits. Add some garlic salt and chedder and they are very flavorful, leave them the way they are, slather with butter and jam and you have a great breakfast. Plus, everything is on hand so you don't need to plan ahead for these.

These make a great quick biscuit base - but will be bland if left alone. I followed the advice of others and added cheddar and some thyme. Next time I'll add a spoon of sugar, too.

I just made these and I was wondering about the comments about them being so bland; aren't biscuits normally a little bland?  No, these are REALLY bland.  I love the idea that this recipe doesn't have a ton of ingredients and is quick to make but it really needs something else to give it flavor.  Even using butter instead of shortening didn't help.

Super easy and tastes great!  I made these last week when I needed a quick biscuit recipe to go with scrambled eggs, sausage and gravy.  These were perfect!  I made them again this morning and we topped them with jam.  My husband says he's going to have chili over them for lunch today.  This recipe is a keeper for us.  Thank you!

This was fast, easy, and excellent!  I added some cheese and garlic powder, and I have lots of other things I'm going to try in them too.  Next time I would use the spoon to gently give them a more biscuity shape, but no biggie.

These came out great! Nice and flaky. I halved the recipe {6 servings), as only a few of us were home. I used a little less baking powder than called for and added a little garlic powder ( a little less than a half teaspoon), but I think they would also be good without. Quick and easy!

Really simple and Really good. Best if served right out of the oven with butter.
Just don't make them with baking soda, like I did once when I was rushed 
and not paying attention. YUCK. :-)

These were good.  I liked these because they were so easy to make.  I will make these again!  My husband really liked him and asked me why I have never made these for him before!  I halved this recipe and it still was good.  I added a bit of sugar and put less baking powder because I was worried about having the biscuits taste like baking powder!  Overall a great recipe!  Thank you!

I make these but substitute 1/2 cup coconut oil instead of the crisco. I also sift the dry ingredients. It is very moist inside and a little crunchy on the outside! Much better this way.

Simple, quick, risk-free.  Somewhat copied Heather Adam (TX): added a bit of almond extract.  Now to find some sort of whipped butter to go with it.  I want to dip these in something :)

No changes made ... BIG hit at Christmas supper, especially with apple butter.  Doubled the recipe and the guys are glad there are some left over so they can have them with sausage gravy.  Will definitely be making these again!

Ok I did tweak it a bit so not a fair review. I always have to triple recipe so I can get a couple of biscuits for me LOL. I add sugar & substitute bacon grease for the shortening, skip the vanilla & depending on which meal you are making them for (biscuits & gravy, or dinner) some minced garlic.

I usually just make bisquick just because it's fast.  These were super easy and the kids liked them better than bisquick.  It uses ingredients I always have on hand and it took just a couple minutes more than Bisquick.  

I did add more milk, but I do that with Bisquick also because I find them too dry.  I may still use the Bisquick once in awhile, but this is a lot cheaper and tastes better.

I added about 3/4 c of shredded cheddar, 1 tsp vanilla and 1 Tbsp garlic powder.  I also brushed finished biscuits with melted butter.  Pretty moist and flavorful that way!

This is the same recipe my mom used for years.  We only had these in Strawberry Shortcake though!!!  Growing up, we would get fresh strawberries, slice and sugar them to taste, then Mom would make batch of these biscuits and we'd take them hot out of the oven, tear them to pieces in a bowl, ladle strawberries over them, and douse the whole thing with a little cold milk.  I didn't know any other strawberry shortcake existed until I was an adult!  I still prefer it this way, although I add whipped cream now....LOL

These were just "allright". Very easy to assemble, they baked up nicely and had a good texture to them. They were just a little dry and bland. I think they would go better with some gravy rather than plain. Not too bad, but not great either.
PS - I used buttermilk in place of the milk since I had some that needed to be used up.

I made many hockey pucks before I found this recipe.  I am considered an excellent cook just this one item I could not bake.  I do think they are bland I would agree with that but I use them for soup and stew so bland is good.  I am going to add the vanilla, just for variety.  I love these biscuits would recommend this to even a beginner cook.

These are perfect, can be rolled or dropped. Best tip is to make sure you are using really cold butter/margarine/shortening. If rolling out make sure not to over work the dough because the better will get too melty.

I like the recipe, however, you need to add a little more milk than just one cup. I add about a TBLS of milk to it. I don't want the dough to be so stiff, I give it a softer look, but still holds together to make biscuits. Then I let them sit for about 15-30 min. Depending on how much time I have.  I use real butter in place of shortening. I know not everyone likes to taste their dough, however, when making a new recipe you haven't done before, when there isn't any egg in it, taste a little of it, and you will know what the product will taste like for ex: Salty, sweet, or how you like them.  I tasted a little bit of it before adding any extra milk beyond the 1 cup, and it was salty, and the dough was too stiff, so I added just a little bit more to soften the dough, afterwards I tasted it, not salty so much anymore!! Keep a close eye on these when baking!! You may find you want to take them out sooner!! You can also bake at 350 degrees for about 15-20 min. Sometimes that helps too, takes a little longer, but might help with texture as well. I use non-salted butter too!! Don't use Salted Butter!!

This is a great, easy, quick and wonderful recipe! I have used it as a base for so many different flavours/types of bisquits,from throwing in some trail mix, cheese and chives, or just a bit of cinnamon (before adding the milk). I love that it uses the things that I always have on hand, and that I can throw them together if I have someone coming over on short notice

To make this recipe Dairy/soy free I used coconut oil (solid at room temp) and almond milk in place of the shortening and milk. They turned out great!! I think maybe people have been overcooking them and that's why they are dry? I baked until just turning golden, not at all brown and they were delish! 

I also lined the pan with parchment paper instead of greasing, less calories and less mess!

Pretty good! After reading the comments here I decided to add some seasonings (garlic salt in place of the salt, plus some garlic powder, onion powder, OLD BAY seasoning, and dried parsley) and cheeses (shredded cheddar, provolone, and grated parmesan since that was the cheeses I happened to have), and baked at 425 degrees for 15 min. The only thing that might have made it better is if I thought to brush the tops with garlic butter!

This is the recipe I use. It is good, easy and quick. My kids are always yelling that they are hungry 1st thing in the morning and I don't have time to roll them out and all that. So this is a very handy dandy trick to have up your sleeve.

These biscuits have a salty taste.  I like biscuits a little sweeter and think this recipes needs to add a little sugar.  Will not make again.

I don't know what went wrong! I followed the recipe to the letter (with the exception of substituting butter for shortening, after being reassured by a professional baker that it was ok). The biscuits had a terrible after taste and they were dry. Maybe it was something I did, as this was my first time making homemade biscuits. On the bright side, at least they were tender! :)

This is a really good basic biscuit recipe, but I made a few changes. Many reviews say they are a little dry, so I added just less than 1/4 cup more milk. I don't like baking with shortening, so I substituted butter for the shortening. I also soured the milk with 1 tsp apple cider vinegar and added a few tablespoons of honey to give it a little extra sweetness. They browned a tiny bit too quickly, so I turned down the heat to 425. They turned out great! I will definitely be making them again... My fiancee and I love them with eggs over easy and fried ham!

The things I changed.
1) I used coconut oil instead of shortening. 2) I added a table spoon of sugar 3) I used reduced fat milk instead of regular milk to cut down the calories. They turned out sooooo perfect!!!!! Nice and hard on the outside and moist and soft in the inside. But with the coconut oil and sugar makes this so much better!!! Yum yum~~ This is keeper X 10~~~ Thank you for the recipe!!

My husband loves this, he ate almost the entire recipe in one sitting.  I used regular almond milk, 1/4 cup of butter instead of shortening, and added some shredded cheese. Super easy!

Sub 3/4 teaspoon baking soda and 1 tablespoon vinegar in place of baking powder.

Didn't have any shortening, so I used butter and reduced the baking powder only by a pinch in response to some of the reviews. Also drastically reduced the recipe to make only 4 biscuits. They baked up very well--not too dry, not too greasy. Used them as breakfast biscuits (heresy!) with the "Bacon Gravy for Biscuits" on this website. Though not a "traditional" match-up, they were still tasty. Good improvisation based on what we had on hand.

These came out pretty well... a *little* dry and bland, but they are a perfect match for a meal served with gravy, which is exactly what I needed them for! I don't know that I'd eat these on their own, but I'm definitely saving this recipe for the next time I make Chicken n' biscuits (:

I also added about 1/4 tsp garlic salt and the cup of shredded cheddar. I used Can't Believe It's Not Butter for the shortening. Delicious, easy and quick.  What more could you want?!

I tried and enjoyed this recipe but I took the advice of others and added a cup of shredded cheddar and chives. It went well with beef stew!

Not bad!  I halved the recipe and added ¼ t. garlic powder and 1 t. sugar.  Not the best biscuit I’ve had, but good and very quick to make.  I may make these again when I want biscuits on a busy weeknight.  Thanks!

These are delicious! Perfect for tight schedules and busy nights. They were a bit dry, so we ate them with butter and jelly. They were so good!! I have made these several times and plan on making them many more times!!!

Good biscuit recipe.  One Sunday a month, I have the opportunity to bake for our Church family.  For those who are cannot have sugar in their diet, I make these biscuits and add a cup of shredded cheddar cheese (in addition, sometimes I add 6 pieces of crispy, crumpled-up turkey bacon) to the dough.  People seem to enjoy them.

These were easy to make.  Actually, I misread the recipe and added 1/2 C shortening instead of 1/4.  They came out soft and just what I was expecting for a drop biscuit.  I also added some garlic powder, as I wanted a more savory biscuit.  I added 1 tsp, but I think I should've stuck to 1/2 tsp!  It was still good, though, and I would make these again.

These were great.  I changed the recipe by adding buttermilk instead of regular milk.   I also used self rising flour instead of baking powder.  I think the salt wasn't necessary after adding the buttermilk so next time it won't be there!  Very good recipe!  Now I don't have to buy the packaged stuff anymore for buttermilk biscuits.  One suggestion to other cooks... don't over work the dough.  I think I did because they weren't as light and fluffy as I was expecting.  I think I over mixed.  My husband didn't seem to mind, he ate all but the two I had!

This is an amazing recipe!  They are super easy to make and turn out delicious.  I substitute margarine for half the shortening and add a bit of sugar, no more than 1/4 cup.  Hubby loves them especially when I pair them with something like peachy chicken to sop up the juice.  We love them plain too.

Why have I been making Bisquick biscuits all this time when these are just as easy and taste so much better??  I use butter rather than shortening, and sometimes add 1T of sugar to sweeten them up a bit.  Since I live alone, I usually make 1/4 recipe to yield two biscuits; I like them best fresh from the oven so I'd rather make them this way than reheat leftovers later.

This is a great recipe, but i admit it do some changes to get more flavour!

by changing the shortening to butter, you get a much richer taste.

Also, I find it only takes about 10min prep time, not 30 as mentioned in the recipe.

These are good basic biscuits. Add some garlic salt and chedder and they are very flavorful, leave them the way they are, slather with butter and jam and you have a great breakfast. Plus, everything is on hand so you don't need to plan ahead for these. Love it!

This recipe is so easy and so good!  I used butter flavor shortening and just broke off pieces instead of spooning.  They were light and fluffy and really moist in the middle.  Very good.

Good tast, easy to make... airy and dry is the word with these, I found them moist in the middle thoug.... Unlike some reviewers, I did not find the amount of baking powder too intense... I used butter flavored shortening, and simply broke pices off tyhe dough ball, rathjer than spooning them, but the shape was good... lovely color

Interesting texture, more like a bread than a traditional biscuit.  I only gave it a 3 because they were pretty bland.  I like my biscuits to be a bit saltier than what they turned out.  If I make them again I will definetly increase the salt or add some garlic salt to liven them up.

These biscuits were very good, had a nice texture. They went well with potato soup. Very easy to make.
