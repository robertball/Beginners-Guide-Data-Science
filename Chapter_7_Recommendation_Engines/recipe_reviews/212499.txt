My husband (who is a picky eater!) and I loved this meal! It was so quick and easy. I didn't have any fresh veggies on hand, so I used a frozen stir fry mix instead. Highly recommend this!

I recommend doubling the Italian dressing (4 tablespoons) and cream cheese (8 ounces) Quick, easy weeknight meal! We prefer it with broccoli florets instead of zucchini.

This  was delicious, I could have eaten the whole thing all by my self. I added broccoli florets instead of the asparagus and added yellow squash besides the zucchini. I probably could make this at least once a week.

Absolutely delicious! I used frozen mixed vegetables instead and seasoned the chicken with a little bit of black pepper end garlic salt. So fast and easy. Next time I'll substitute the pasta for just mixed vegetables, for those who are trying to minimize their carb intake.

This is so easy! It only took 30 minutes and i used things I already had in my fridge/pantry. I substituted broccoli, green onions and carrots. I added a bit more Italian dressing to pump up the flavor. I will definitely make this again!

I followed this recipe almost verbatim but had to improvise the vegetables, so  Instead of the  ones called for I used brocoli and carrots as that is all I had on hand.  Turned out very good but feel the sauce was missing something in the way of spice maybe, and felt it needed a kick of some sort.  would definitely make it again but with the suggested vegetables.

Excellent recipe. My kids, who are fussiest eaters EVER ate it all up. I added more pasta than the recipe asked for and I skipped the zucchini and asparagus. I also added more cream cheese.

I added pink Himalayan salt and pepper and it turned out great.

This  was really quite good (better than I expected) and it could not be easier!  I used every vegetable I had in my fridge.  I put onions and bell pepper in with the chicken.  Then added mushrooms, zucchini, and asparagus when I added the cream cheese to keep them from getting mushy.  You could easily make zucchini noodles to replace the pasta.  I will definitely make this again.

Created a vegetarian version, omitted the chicken and used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. I also add carrots and green onion along with a seasoning mix with a lot of black pepper. It was very easy to make and I will make again!

This was easy and ok, but not very flavorful. It gets points for being flexible (can use other veggies) and fast. We added red pepper flakes and garlic, and it was pretty tasty.

This recipe is a keeper with a few alterations.  I agree with using more Italian dressing, I used 3 tbs & it was fine.  I did add carrots, red onion, mushrooms, &peas, in addition to the called for vegetables(we're vege people). When I make this again I will use only 1/2 - 3/4 cup of broth since the sauce did not thicken much.  Heating thru will take closer to 5 minutes(mine was lukewarm after heating for 2 minutes).   Crusty bread on the side will go nice with this dish

We didn't care for this at all.  I found the red pepper to be very overpowering, and the sauce never really thickened. I followed the recipe. Won't be making again.

So, so yummy, and easy to make.  I've left out the chicken and sustituted broccoli and carrots for the zucchini and asparagus.

I give the 5 starts b/c it was so simple and super yummy.  I used spicy Italian sausage and extra garlic (of course - I LOVE garlic).  To make it even easier, for the veggies, i just used a bag of frozen medley veggies.  super fast!
