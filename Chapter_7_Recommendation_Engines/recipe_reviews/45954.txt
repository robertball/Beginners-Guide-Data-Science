Made this last night for 2nd time with some minor changes, and it was SO good - hubby said it was possibly the best chicken I ever made and as good, if not even better than the store rotisserie chickens (which, in our opinion, are extremely yummy).  The only things I did differently were I used a large 7+ lb. roaster instead of the 2 smaller ones.  For the spices, I eliminated white pepper (who has that?) and cut the cayenne and paprika in half, and increased the garlic powder to a full teaspoon.  Even doing that there is still plenty of kick in the spice mix.  Like another reviewer I added a couple Tbsps. of minced garlic to the onions in the cavity.  The biggest change?  Last time I just seasoned and stuck in oven.  This time, I wrapped in double plastic wrap (with the onions/garlic in place in the cavity) & ended up marinating for over 24 hours in the fridge - purely by accident, but it made all the difference!!  Slow-roasting at 250 (I did go up to 275 for about 45 min. in middle of cooking to ensure it would be done in time for dinner) cooked the bird perfectly in exactly 4 hours (Use a meat therm. - take out at 170, and let it rest before carving, it will be perfectly cooked but not dried out).  Made gravy with the drippings, but the white meat was so moist it didn't even need it.  I will never make a roast chicken any other way!!  P.S. when the chicken is done, drizzle some pan drippings over it, the chicken will suddenly glisten and look picture perfect for the table.

I love this recipe and make it often. My only suggestion is to get a jar and mix up a lot of the seasonings at one time to keep in your cabinet. I changed the servings to 64 and the ingredents came up in cup and tablespoon amounts for easy mixing. Then when I make a chicken I have the "mix" at my fingertips. It takes 3 to 4 tablespoons of mix per chicken. I normally serve this "rubber chicken" style with lots of veggies so I have leftover chicken. The next day I make enchiladas with the leftovers. Then I boil the bones for tortilla soup. This gives 3 meals my family of 5 loves. Even my picky son eats these 3 meals.
I normally make this in the crockpot for easy cooking, but the roasting it in the oven yeilds better results.

My kids simply LOVE this chicken recipe (7 year old & teenagers)! Chicken always comes out so tender & flavorful. They especially love the gravy this makes: I add a can of chicken broth mixed with a tablespoon cornstarch to the pan juices, and let boil till thicken. And here's another tip for those days where I can't find 5 hours to spare to roast a chicken: I take 5 or 6 chicken breasts with bone, I skip the onions & skip the overnight marinating step. Instead, toss seasonings & chicken in a large oven roasting bag, shake till chicken are all evenly coated. Bake in 350 oven for 1-1/2 hours. MOST REQUESTED CHICKEN in my household!  I highly recommend this recipe!!

Wow! What a great "fix it and forget it" recipe! So moist, so tender, I cut it with my fork and barely had to chew it! My chicken was 4-1/2 pounds, so I found I only had to roast it about 3-1/2 hours, roasted to 170 degrees. I marinaded it in the spice rub the night before, using half the salt called for and a tad less pepper, and it suited our tastes perfectly. Overooking this, of course, would totally ruin it, so I would treat the directed roasting time only as a guide and use a meat thermometer if possible.

Wish I could give this one more than 5 stars. I followed the recipe as stated, exception of white pepper, did not miss it. I did leave in fridge overnight. And then I cooked for 4 1/2 hours. I also did not have a whole chicken, but had wings as I always do. I greased my roaster pan with little oil then laid layers of onions in my pan I laid my wings over my onions I roasted for three hours then I put my rack in my roaster pan and put my wings on the rack and cooked 1 1/2 hours more, this was the best chicken ever, can not wait to roast a whole bird. but it's good to know that chicken pieces work as well. My wings came out very juicy and moist. this is more than a 5 star chicken. YOU MUST TRY IT!!!!!!!.Update!!!! I cook this again using a whole bird and it was as great as my wings, very juicy and the skin was crispy. I did let it sit overnight and then on my lunch break at 12:30pm yesterday I went home and popped it in the oven. When I got home the house smelled so good and I still had and hour left to prepare my rice and fried cabbage. This time I also made pan gravy from the drippings. A Sunday meal on a Thursday with little effort. Yum Yum.

This is THE BEST chicken ever!  We buy lots of chickens when on sale, then coat with the seasoning mixture and freeze.  Recently I have been making the sticky chicken in the crockpot and it turns out just as delicious and it's lots easier.  The drippings make the most fantastic gravy ever.  I try to have this on the menu a few times each month.  Terrific!

This is a GREAT chicken recipe.  I'm sure most of it has to do with the baking technique, but the spice combination is great too.  This chicken was falling off of the bones!  I baked a 4 lb chicken for approximately 4.5 hours, and that was probably a bit too long.  I followed the recipe, halving it as I was only baking one chicken.  I did make some changes as follows:
*Only used 1 tsp salt
*Kept the onion powder and garlic powder amounts the same, didn't halve them.  
*I didn't have an onion to put in the cavity, but did have a bunch of green onions.  I cut them in 3rds and stuffed them inside the chicken along with some minced garlic.
*I brushed the chicken with melted butter prior to rubbing the spice mixture on (had some spice mixture left over).  
* I took four pats of butter (about 2T total) and shook them into the remaining spice mixture, completely covering them.  I then put 2 pats under the skin of the chicken on top of the breast on each side.  
* I cut up potatoes and carrots and placed them in the bottom of the pan, placing the chicken on top when baking it.

This turned out great.  The skin was crisp, the meat was juicy and tender.  The juices made an EXCELLENT gravy.  Definitely a keeper!

YUMMERS!!! Hands down THE BEST chicken I have ever made and I have made alot of chicken in my day!!! I took the pan drippings while the chicken "rested" and added 1 can chicken broth and tablespoon of cornstarch (shaking the stock and cornstarch in a mason jar prior to adding to the drippings) and made a gravy...No need to add additional seasoning to the gravy...it was FANTABULOSO!!!! This recipe is definately one of my favorites! Will make again and again! UPDATE: My 10 year old son has asked me 3 times this week to make this "yummy" chicken (as he calls it)....he LOVES it and it's on the menu tonight!!! I will put it in at 2:00 and by the time we get home from Trick or Treating.... dinner will be done...I will put Yukon gold potatos and carrots in the roaster as well so all I will have to do is make the gravy!!! TIP: The last time I wrapped fresh corn on the cobb (breifly blanched buttered and seasoned) in foil and slow roasted it along with the chicken.....YUMMERS!

This was honestly the best whole chicken I have ever eaten. The seasoning went all the way through the meat. I doubled the seasoning recipe and then only used one chicken as I love lots of flavor. I lifted the skin and rubbed the seasoning directly onto the meat as well as on top of the skin. I cooked it on 250 like the recipe said until the internal temp reached about 175 then I turned it up to 350 to get the skin extra crispy until the chicken was done. This was a great recipe!

Absolutely fantastic!! The cooking time was right on in my oven (Maytag). The perfect blend of seasonings for rotisserie chicken. I considered brining the chickens for 24 hrs before placing the seasonings on them but I figured I better not do that because I want to rate it fairly. Much to my delight, the white meat was so juicy and tender I couldn't believe it! To save a step, I placed each rinsed and dried chicken in it's own gallon size zip lock baggie and then rubbed the seasonings on each chicken rather than rub seasonings on each chicken and then place each one in a separate baggie. We ate half of one chicken for dinner, the rest of that chicken is for sandwiches and the other chicken will be shredded for chicken tacos and chicken enchiladas this week. For the price of buying one scrawny rotisserie chicken at the grocery store, you get two great tasting plump and juicy chickens with this recipe. By the way, the house smelled devine while baking at such a low temp for 5 hours. I did not baste the chickens till right before serving. Thank you Sue for sharing!!

Great recipe! I only wish other members would make up their own recipe instead of revamping the whole thing in their reviews and then rating it.
It is sooooooo annoying.

Sue, you have out done yourself with this recipe. Thank you so much for sharing. I was astounded by this. So simple and fabulous. no changes at all are needed for this recipe. Don't change it and rate it you don't care for it.  The most amazing thing you can do with this recipe is when you finish eating, trust me there will be no left overs, make your own chicken stock. I put the chicken carcasses into my giant pot,(no need to pick at it)  cover with water, add rough cut celery, carrots, lots of onion and a couple bay leaf. When I mix the spices for the rub, I mix an extra 1/2 and add  to the pot of stock mix. Simmer on low a few hours till the bones are fairly clean, and strain until most of the ingredient "floaters" are removed. You will be left with a deep golden stock. Season with salt & pepper if needed, for the most flavorful home made stock you have ever had. It freezes well, I usually put 1C portions in a ziplok freezer bag to pull out for gravy's and sauces. Then I fill a large ziplok so there is enough to pull out as a base for home made soup. If I only make this recipe using one chicken, I make the stock in my slow cooker and leave it on low all night.  It's a great two-fer recipe. You will taste the difference in all of your recipe's made with the stock. When it's gone...you have another excuse to make this recipe again!

Awesome recipe for restaurant style rotisserie chicken straight from your own oven! I cut the recipe in half for one 4 pound chicken and used 1/2 tsp. of regular paprika, 1/2 tsp. of smoked paprika and used 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder. I follwed the recipe instructions and then wrapped the chicken in plactic wrap and refridgerated it for 24 hours. I then baked it for 1 hour at 275 and then lowered the temp. to 250 and baked it for another 3 hours. This was so incredibly moist, tender, and delicious without a ton of effort - great recipe!

We followed the recipe exactly and the skin turned out very dry and tough.  The meat was still moist but it did not remind me of rotisserie chicken.  It was really just okay.  Not bad but not amazing. I honestly think the 5 hour cooking time was just too long and that's why it ended up being so dry.

Wow!  I just had to rate/review this one once again.  I've discovered that the secret to this recipe is not in the ingredients but in the method of slow roasting.  During the past 3 weeks, I've roasted chicken and turkey in various forms and with various seasonings, not adhering to the ones listed in this recipe.  Each variation that I tried came out superb--perfection in whatever flavor I started with.

Try it!  Try this and then try any other marinades or seasonings that you like but use this slow roasting method and guage accordingly.  It may take only about 2-2 1/2 hours for pieces.
Thanks again, Sue, It's a great recipe and a great method.

Followed this recipe as written (minus the white pepper because I didn't have any).  I did take the hint of one review and used 2 generous pats of butter that were coated in the spices and then placed UNDER the skin on the chicken breasts.  One stick of celery and two cloves of minced garlic were added with the onion.  I wrapped it well, let it set over night in the fridge.  I used one (7 lb) chicken, and it only took 4 hours to cook.  My gosh!!  BEST ROAST CHICKEN EVER!  A TOTAL KEEPER!  The chicken was so moist and tender and the house smelled wonderful.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

This chicken is INCREDIBLE!! Absolutely fantastic, and so easy to do. Six people..two chickens..no leftovers! I rinsed and patted dry two 4 lb chickens. Got all of the seasonings measured out in a small bowl. No need to double the amount, it was plenty to cover both birds. I went lighter on the cayenne pepper only because I have not made this recipe before, and was serving this for my parents. I also included two large cracked cloves of fresh garlic and used only one onion. I slathered the chickens with a light rub of butter, massaged the seasonings all over the outside, sprinkled some seasoning and put the onion and cloves of garlic in each cavity, placed both birds in one 9X13 glass dish, covered with plastic wrap and put in the fridge the night before. The next morning, I put one of the chickens in its own 9X13 dish, let both pans rest on the counter for about a half hour to come to room temperature, then placed both pans in a preheated 250 degree oven. My birds hit 170 degrees in 4 hrs. It was the best roasted chicken I have ever cooked. Extremely moist and so flavorful. The house smelled out of this world as the chicken cooked. YOU MUST TRY THIS RECIPE! You will not be disappointed..my family loved it! And I will be sharing this with everyone I know :)

Someone has played a cruel joke on everyone. If you roast this chicken for 5 hours like it calls for it turns out way over done and drier that the Sahara Desert. Start checking the temperature after about 3 hours and don't let it cook over the 180 degrees internal temperature.

I didn't make this with a whole chicken, but rather with about 5 lbs of chicken quarters. The only things I left out was the quartered onion & the cayenne. I placed them on a jelly roll pan for about 1.5 hours on 325. Came out tasting just like a rotisserie chicken!

Delicious recipe.  I understand the desire (and sometimes need, for homemade), but after making this, I couldn't help but think the following: I just spent ~$3.00 on a chicken, whatever the oven bag cost, a fair amount prep time (not to mention the overnight refrigeration), put it in my (electric) oven for five hours (wondering how much energy THAT used), so I can have a chicken that tastes EXACTLY like one I can buy at the market two blocks away, already cooked in a rotisserie, any day of the week, for $3.99.  Like I said, nothing against the recipe per se, it was yummy, just for me, logistically, it makes no sense.

After three perfect meals using this roast chicken recipe, I'm making it again today for the fourth time. It has become my family's favorite Sunday dinner. I rub the seasoning mixture between the skin and meat and add quartered lemons to the chicken cavities. Those two small changes are the only changes I make, except for taking the chickens out of the oven when they reach an internal temperature of 170 F. I serve this roast chicken with Green Bean Bundles (Mark Karnes recipe on this site is a good one), baked potatoes, garden salad, homemade rolls and the Old Fashioned Peach Cobbler (I use Eleta's cobbler recipe from this site).

Wow - Wow and WOW!  I've made whole chicken in the crockpot so many times and been disappointed at the results.  I will never make chicken a different way again!  This was absolutely perfect!  I used one 6 lb. chicken and stuffed a quartered onion inside.  I rubbed it with the spices and wrapped it tight with saran wrap.  I let it sit in the refrigerator for about 2 hours and then slow roasted it in a pan in a 250 degree oven for 2 1/2 hours.  For the last 45 minutes I turned the heat up to 350 to make the skin crispy.  It was so fantastic!

We LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe! Perfect just the way it is! All the spices made the gravy a tasty tasty treat! (Hint: melt half stick butter in a pan add flour to thicken - then add pan juices & chicken stock - no lumps!) YUM YUM YUM! Thank you!

Delicious! We took the advise of many and cut the salt to half but will need to reduce it more still - was very salty but the other seasonings made this very tasty - all we changed was the salt (oh and put some minced garlic in with the onion).  I used bigger chickens and they didn't cook evenly in my pan because they were snug so we'll have to handle that differently next time if I decide to use bigger chickens again, but that has nothing to do with the recipe - the recipe is fantastic and we will make this again!

Favorful and Moist! I used 4 frozen chicken breasts, seasoned one side, placed in crockpot with 1/2 cup of chicken broth and cooked on high 2 hours, flipped chicken and seasoned again, cooked on low 2 more hours. Picky 12 year old loved this (I did cut back on the cayenne). ***UPDATE- I did make this recipe exactly as stated and my family LOVED it!  It was so flavorful and moist..will definitely make again and again!  Next time I am putting the chicken in the crockpot instead of heating up the house for 5 hours.

This is the *only* way I make roast chicken now! I use it so much that I now make a quadruple batch of the spices and store them in a jar (note: equals 5 T. of spice mixture) for the next time I make it! I don't marinate beforehand, and I've noted that fresh chicken tends to be less dry than a thawed, previously frozen chicken. (Tip: Save the bones and make your own chicken stock in the slow-cooker! The spices make the chicken stock more flavorful.)

Being less than crazy about chicken because I find it to be basically boring and dry, I was happily surprised with this recipe! I cooked a 5.5 lb chicken this way and it was so juicy!! The onions inside the chicken act as a steam as they contain so much water which is one of the reasons why it is so juicy and tender. The flavors were wonderful with a great mix of spices that you can tailor to your own liking (IE; more salty, less salty) I did cook mine for the first 3 hours BREAST SIDE DOWN, this helps to keep the breast meat juicy as the juices settle downward. After the 3 hrs I turned it over for the last 2 hrs. I have been looking for a good chicken recipe and usually use another one from this site "Juicy roasted chicken" but it calls for a lot of butter and the seasoning was not as flavorful. This will now be my go to recipe for tender juicy roasted chicken. Thanks so much for sharing this, it is easy and super delicious. Also it is nice to make on a cold day as the oven in on for a while.. just perfect all around.

Actually, I just had a question to verify the cooking of the chicken.  When stated to 'Bake uncovered'; I am assuming that is unwrapped (no cooking bags) and no lid. . . ???
Thank you for your input.

I'll be honest...I've tried many top-rated recipes on here and been sorely disappointed, wondering, "what are these people thinking?"  But this one is so worth its high marks!  I am not generally a fan of roasted chicken -- too many bland, boring, rubbery, greasy or dried out experiences.  This chicken, however, was tender, flavorful and aromatic.  The only things I changed were to add extra seasoning under the skin of the breast, rub a smidge of olive oil on the skin prior to cooking, and most importantly, I followed Bittman's and Joy of Cooking info in that Salmonella is killed at 160 degrees, so cooking chicken in the oven to 180 is overkill.  I roasted until the inner thigh read 170 and the breast 165, then let it sit 10 minutes to let the temp rise with carryover heating.  PERFECT.  I suspect those who ended up with a dried out chicken used the five hours listed in the recipe rather than cooking using a thermometer.  My 4.5 lb chicken only took 4 hours to cook.  I also wonder how many have the usual oven overheat.  I keep a thermometer in my oven, and had to change the temp a few times as it kept trying to sneak up considerably past 250.  Personally, I will be forwarding this recipe on to friends and family.  Yummy!

The whole family loves this one! My teenage sons ask for it all the time. Whenever chickens go on sale I buy as many as can fit in my fridge and I prepare them as instructed before cooking and stick in a ziplock bag and freeze them. I thaw one in the fridge about a day or two before cooking and dinner is a breeze!

I made this in my Crock-Pot.  Use 3 balls of crumpled up aluminum foil to elevate the chicken out of its juices.  DO NOT add any liquid to the Crock-Pot.  Cook on high 1 hour, then low 6-10 hours.  
The chicken turned out nice and moist, but I wasn't too keen on the flavor - next time I think I'll leave out the paprika, thyme, white pepper, and add some Cajun seasoning instead.

Three cheers to Sue for an excellent, simple recipe! I'm not sure why we need to roast two at a time, but it divides in half well enough. Like another reviewer said, I also filled a shaker with the spice mix. That mix is now my house seasoning and I use it on most anything. I did eliminate the white pepper and substituted that with black pepper (making the total 1 1/2 tsp black pepper). I'm not sure about the logic for using both. It's usually one or the other, but not both. Also, I have trouble finding small 4 lb. chickens. I live in an area without much competition so I have to take what I can get, but even if it's a 5-6 lb chicken, this recipe works just as well. One IMPORTANT thing worth noting is that it is often ready much earlier than 5 hours. Begin checking it after 4 hours. Sooner if you have a small bird. Anyway, I am glad that she posted this. Again, many thanks Sue!

Due to time constraints, had to adjust the cooking time but it still turned out great.  Cooked it uncovered at 500 degrees for 20 minutes and at 325 degrees for about one hour.  Chicken was perfectly cooked, tender and extremely juicy.  Everybody loved it including my 4 year old daughter who didn't want to try it at first but kept asking for more.

This was so incredibly juicy, tasty and yes...nicely sticky (secret is to baste every so often the last hour and half to 2 hours!) I used an 8lb roaster (it took 6 hours and was well worth the wait) and took the suggestion of other reviewers and cut the salt to 2tsp. (kept everything else the same).I mixed all seasonings together in an empty spice jar then rubbed a light coating of olive oil before adding the rub so the spices would stick better. I put some of the rub under the skin also! I put the chicken in a 2gallon ziplock and marinated overnight (15hours--the longer the better). I also used the suggestion of another reviewer to roast the chicken breast side down for the first half of the cooking time and then flip it over for rest of the cooking time (I believe this flipping helped w the color and kept it juicy). The color of the chicken was beautiful and the skin tasted amazing. Made a fabulous gravy from the juices mixing it w a little flour mixed with water to thicken. Absolutely a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

This was awesome! I only had 1 chicken, but I made the whole spice mix and just SLATHERED my cihcken, even coated the onions before I  stuffed them up the bird's wazzoo! I only had a few hours to let it marinate, and it still came out awesome! I can't wait to let it soak overnight. My three year old and I were fighting over the last leg (I won)and the gravy made even INSTANT mashed potatoes taste awesome! This is my new (and only) roasted chicken recipe! (Going to try the "rub" on my Thanksgiving turkey, too!)

To the previous reviewer who gave one star: Ummm, maybe you should just go buy a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store...no effort at all then. 

This was a great recipe...and I enjoy knowing what spices went into the rub. Will make again and again

WOW!  This was the absolute best roasted chicken I have ever had in my life.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of splashing in a little bit of Marsala wine at the beginning when I freaked out over the lack of juices coming out of the chicken.  After about 2 and a half hours, those juices DO finally come pouring out, so don't be alarmed like I was!!  This chicken doesn't even need a gravy, but the pan gravy that came out of this was excellent as well!  I'd give it 10 stars if I could!
*** It has been some time since I last reviewed this and I've made this recipe at least twice a month since then.  I just wanted to add that I've noticed there IS a profound difference between using a fresh from the store chicken and one that I've had in my freezer for any length of time.  A fresh-from-the-store chicken yields more natural juices and much more tender, juicy meat!

We make this all the time. Always put an onion in the cavity, and I always lay fat, uncut carrots & celery underneath the chickens as if they are a "rack" holding it up. They taste amazing! Also, we usually eat 1 chicken and use the other to make the most amazing chicken soup ever! If you tear off all the chicken, and boil the chicken carcass for at least an hour will the skin etc it will make the best chicken stock! Use the juice from underneath the chicken as well but drain off excess fat (by putting in fridge overnight). Best soup ever!

This is one of my favorite recipes! I have made it several times and it is consistently amazing. My husband and I love it and I love making it, as I can use the leftovers for other dishes throughout the week. The flavor and juiciness is quite impressive considering how simple it is.

Love the seasoning! I always make 3-4 times the quantity of spice mix so it's always ready. Then, whenever I want to roast chicken, I use at least 1 Tb + 2-1/4 tsp per chicken (which is 1/2 of recipe's 3-1/2 Tblsp for 2 chickens!) ... but really I like more than that. I do rub some under the skin to flavor the meat. I always make a delicious gravy with the de-fatted drippings: Make a roux, add chicken broth &/or milk, season with pepper & thyme. I have yet to try out the 5 hrs. of roasting method because it is done at around 3-1/4 or so hrs. When pressed for time, I have also used regular roasting temp & time successfully.

I have made many roast chicken recipes with great results, and this is one of the greatest! The seasonings were perfect, the results were tender and juicy. I also recommend basting like other reviews said, to keep the chicken moist and to help in the browning process. My whole family loved this. Definately a keeper!

This is a fantastic recipe and a regular for roast chicken in our house. Only things I do differently is to make a paste of butter and the seasonings and stuff this under the skin of the breasts. I also wrap and marinate it overnight after rubbing the outer skin with the seasoning. I suggest to remove the chicken at about 155-160 degrees, heat the oven to 375, and put the chicken back in the oven. Pour a little water into the bottom of the pan before putting back into the oven and the high heat will help the steam brown and crisp the skin. Remove at 170 degrees and let the bird rest. Delicious!

Hi!  For those wishing "sticky" chicken, you have to stick around and baste the bird with pan drippings late in the roasting process--something I never have time to do.  If you do, however, you'll get truly sticky chicken.

Ok this is great.  I actually have a rotisserie that I use all the time.  I made it the same way that you would normally do in the oven and it was amazing.  The flavor is wonderful and the chicken is extrememly moist.  With the slow cooking time it just brings out the flavor.  Thank you for posting...definately a keeper.

We loved this recipe and will definitely be using it again.  We found that if you want to used the drippings for gravy add 1/2 cup of water to the pan.  We also continually basted the chicken.  Love this recipe...Definitely will use it again.

BY MOMSAVEDBYGRACE: 7+ lb. roaster instead of the 2 smaller ones. For the spices, I eliminated white pepper (who has that?) and cut the cayenne and paprika in half, and increased the garlic powder to a full teaspoon. Even doing that there is still plenty of kick in the spice mix. Like another reviewer I added a couple Tbsps. of minced garlic to the onions in the cavity.
   By BLACKMP: I changed the servings to 64 and the ingredents came up in cup and tablespoon amounts for easy mixing. Then when I make a chicken I have the "mix" at my fingertips. It takes 3 to 4 tablespoons of mix per chicken.

After reading everyone's reviews I was really excited about trying this. Most people said that it was great; however, there were a few who said it wasn't. I was hoping to get rostisserie chicken that tasted like Boston Market's Chicken. 

The chicken was good. However, I think the disconnect comes in because there are some people who know how to roast a chicken and others who have never done it before. So here's my take...if you have roasted a chicken before and you like your roasted chicken, this chicken doesn't taste much different. I make a roasted chicken every Christmas using only pepper, seasoned salt, green peppers and onions, and it is great. Therefore, this recipe was good, but it didn't taste like anything that I hadn't already done before with less spices. On the other hand, if you have never roasted a whole chicken, then this the recipe for you. By the way, I gave my mom some of the rub to put on salmon, and she said that it was very good. With that being said, she pointed out that her blood preesure rose after eating it because it had so much salt in it. I would definitely recommend halfing the salt. (She measured her pressure before and after the meal because her doctors have been concerned with her pressure lately). A few other tips, you should definitely work olive oil over the chicken with your hands before using the rub. Lastly, baste this chicken several times throughout the process.

I actually made this in my rotisserie. Here a suggestion double the spices, rub the spices under the skin and on top. Then rub with olive oil. Extra crispy skin and flavorful moist meat.

Delicious chicken!  The meat was tender and moist, the skin was crispy and flavorful.  Absolutely great recipe.  Two things; when I took the chicken out of the bag, I was concerned about where the rub had been removed by the plastic so I mixed up more of the seasoning to cover the spots, and I regret that decision as it ended up being too spicy in those places.  Second, be sure to use a roasting rack; I used a short one and the juice/fat that leaked from the chicken was almost up to the birds.

Had a great flavor but a little too salty.  I would cut it down to 2t.  Other than that this is really good!  Chicken is sooooooo tender!

UPDATE:  28, Dec. '11  I finally tried the actual chicken with this fantastic rub.  The chicken has wonderful flavor.  It was so moist and browned perfectly.  I use the rub on all sorts of meats, but had not gotten around to trying it with a whole chicken.  I think the cavity stuffed with onion also added a lot of flavor.  REVIEW:  01, Feb. '11  My review is based on the rub only.  WONDERFUL rub!  I made up a big batch (32 servings) of the rub so I had it on hand and ready.  Another AR reader suggested I use this on my beef roast for great flavoring.  It was fantastic and gave the meat a great seasoning.  I only marinated the roast for about 2 1/2 hours, but the flavor came through loud and clear.  Can't wait to try it on chicken next week.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

this recipe yields some seriously good chicken.  I cooked mine for 5 hours at 250 and only had an internal temp of about 140 according to my thermometer (bizarre...) so I upped the oven to 350 and put it back in for about 45 minutes to reach the 180 temp (always concerned about food safety!).  however, this method, for me, produced totally inedible vegetables, when roasted alongside.  I don't think potatoes or carrots are meant to be roasted for 5+ hours and still be expected to remotely resemble their original form.  mine were super dry and shrunken as my chicken produced little juice.  I theorize that this is because the chicken is cooked at such a low heat that the juice stays inside (making a very moist bird!) and doesn't leak out and keep the veggies moist.  while we ate and enjoyed the chicken, we had to scrounge for a suitable side dish, after wasting precious mashed potato ingredients and finally pitching the veggies.  
so take note and watch your veggies carefully or better yet, just cook them separately!  
thanks for sharing your recipe, I'll make this again.

Hate to be the party pooper around here for such a popular recipe, but I just don't understand the rave reviews.  Issue  #1: TOO SALTY!!!!!  (To give some perspective, I LOVE salt and tend to like things saltier than most folks.)  I would definitely reduce the salt to no more than 2 teaspoons.  And then there is the issue of "stickiness" and "caramelizing" (or lack thereof).  Many reviewers mentioned this, which makes me wonder: most things that caramelize require some kind of sugar.  Could that have been left out?  Anyway, I'm not impressed with this one.

Excellent recipe.  Did not take 5 hours to reach 180, only 3.5, so watch carefully.  Next time I will mix spices and put in an old shaker to sprinkle on chicken easier.  No changes to recipe though..was wonderful!

This was great!  I made only one chicken, and didn't have 5 hours to bake it, so I cooked it at 275F for 4 hours, then let it sit the 10 minutes before carving.  It was moist, tender and juicy.  I cooked it on a rack and basted it with the drippings about 3 times during baking.  This turned out much better than my usual roast chicken recipe.  Thanks!

I make this every week now. It's that amazing! 2 organic chickens seassoned 24 hrs before. I cook it for 4.5 hours, then remove it fro. The oven and cover it with foil for the last 30 minutes. Baste the chickens with the drippings and they look incredible. 1/2 way through the cooking time I add a few yellow onions cut into quarters, a few carrots cut into segments and about 3 or 4 potatoes cut into wedges. Drizzle these with olive oil and let them bake with the uncovered chicken. We add a green salad and it's the best meal ever. My husband is English and loves roast anything, but this is a truly easy and spectacular meal.  Leftover chicken makes good BBQ chicken pizza, chicken pot pie, gumbo, chicken noodle soup, chicken curry salad stuffed sweet potatoes...on and on! I use the leftover carcasses for the brown chicken stock recipe and then add them to my other dishes. Love a recycleable meal - especially a healthy one. 

Thanks for the amazing recipe! It's a weekly favorite at our house.

Fall-off-the-bone GOOD! I actually used chicken quarters rather than a whole chicken. I put sliced onions on the bottom off a baking dish, placed the  marinated chicken quarters on top of the onions and baked it at 350 degrees for 2 hours. It was the best chicken I had ever made. I think I'll make it tomorrow!

OMG, so fall-off-the-bone delicious, but definitely not sticky. Lol!
We're watching our salt intake, so I didn't add any at all ~ I added some Simply Organic Garlic and Herb Seasoning in it's place, sat back and prayed, and was pleasantly rewarded by the results! 
Great recipe, Sue, and thanks for sharing!

This is really good.  I used smoked paprika instead of regular and black pepper since I had no white pepper.  We don't like dark meat, so I used 2 large bone-in chicken breasts cooked for about 2 1/2 hours.  The meat is very tender and amazingly juicy.  Next time I'll cut back on the thyme a bit as that seems to be a bit overpowering.  An overnight marinade seems to flavor the meat nicely, too.  
UPDATE:  I'm upping my rating.  I cut way back on the thyme and adjusted the rest of the spices slightly to our tastes, still using smoked paprika.  This makes the most wonderful chicken breasts (natural chicken please with nothing added), and I will never buy rotisserie chicken again.  I keep a shaker full of this stuff at the ready when I bring the chicken home!
UPDATE 01/30/10:  I used this rub on a 4 lb fresh split turkey breast.  I left to marinate for 12 hours and baked for 30 minutes on 325 then decreased the heat to 250 and cooked for about another 2 1/2 to 3 hours.  The rub doesn't flavor the entire breast, certainly, but the meat is so tender and juicy it is still worth it.  Next time I may try injecting the breast--the cooking method is a keeper for me!

What a delicious entree.  I got a whole chicken on sale and tried this recipe out. I didn't have white pepper on hand so I substituted seasoned pepper instead. Then after patting the chicken dry I rubbed room temprature butter on the bird (to help make the spices stick) before sprinkling the spices all over it. Next I added a medium chopped onion and 4 large garlic cloves to the cavity before saran wrapping and refrigerating overnight. Finally I cooked the chicken breast side down...there is no way you will get dry chicken using this recipe. The blend of ingredients is perfect for 1 large bird.

Not that this recipe needs any more accolades, but man, this stuff is good! It isn't "sticky" & who cares? My only complaint is that I couldn't walk through the house without my stomach screaming, Is it time to EAT?!?!?! This recipe made me look like a rock star & I didn't have to do anything except throw it in the oven & go read a book until it was done. Doesn't get better than that:o)

Loved this! We had one chicken that was cut up already. Cut the recipe in half, baked for 4 hours. Delicious! I am going to try this on skinless, boneless breasts soon as I think this will be good to take to work for my low carb diet lunch. My pickiest child gave his thumbs up; quite the compliment! *Update: Have made this numerous times, remembering to marinate overnight, sometimes not, using whole chickens, chicken parts, etc.; no matter....it always turns out delicious!

You have to try this recipe! I only made one 4lb. chicken - and it tasted AWESOME & JUICY! I didn't have time to let it sit marinating in the frige overnight, just for a few hours in the morning and it came out so great! You can tweak the seasonings to taste (I didn't put the ceyenne), I wound up using Italian Seasoning since it pretty much had a combo of all the herbs in addition to the other seasonings.  Patted LOTS of margarine and seasonings under the skin, put an onion and minced garlic in the cavity.  Also, put 1/4c. chicken stock and 1/4c. white wine plus minced garlic and chopped onion to the roasting pan... and it carmelized nicely - the gravy was great!  Served it with some garlic cheese potatoes and rice. I've tried a gajillion different ways to make roasted chicken and this is THE ONE!  Easy and fun, you can't mess it up!

*This gets an extra star! Yum, Yum! This was the best roasted chicken I had ever eaten. I used a packet of Lipton Garlic Soup mix inside and out, plus quartered an onion- leaving the skin on- and stuffed it into the cavity. We had someplace to go the next day after placing it in the oven so I turned the oven down a couple of hours early. No matter. The heavenly smell that greeted us at the door reassured me! I prepared the rest of my meal while it "rested" and frequently spooned the juices over the top of the crackly brown, well-seasoned skin. I sure got the kudos on this one! This is THE only way to do a roasted chicken from here on out!!

Okay, I have been making this recipe for YEARS.  The only change I made is that I misread the original recipe as TABLESPOONS and not TEASPOONS.  When I realized my mistake (after making it several times), I made the recipe correctly.  My husband said to go back to my mistake.  So, I make this using TABLESPOONS.  Because it's a rub, it works.

made this with a few minor spice tweeks, and one thing you definitely have to do is TENT THE PAN WITH TINFOIL TIGHTLY!! and cut the baking time a bit. our chicken was fall off the bone good and VERY moist! your chicken will brown in the tinfoil. mine did!

Can't beleive this got so many rave reviews.  I worked in resturants where we cook rostisserie chicken and they never were cook for more than 45 min.  5 hours of cooking just dried out the poor thing and it is way too salty.  Oh well, i guess every one has dif taste buds.  It you really want it resturant style do not use a 4 pound bird. We use much smaller birds in resturants. and cook faster aand higher.

I have to agree with another reviewer...the texture of the chicken wasn't very appealing.  My family ate it but no one ate the leftovers, telling me that it was just an OK dish. I think next time I will coat the chicken with oil and bake the chicken at a high temperature (450) for 10-15 minutes first to sear the outside, then bake it at the lower temperature.

This chicken was absolutely delicious. I mainly used the cooking method and changed the spice rub a bit. I used lots of garlic powder, salt, pepper, chili powder for the rub. I quartered an onion and placed the chunks inside the cavity of the chicken along with 3 smashed garlic cloves, and a chopped carrot. My 4 pound chicken cooked in 4.5 hours. It was golden and somewhat sticky (as promised) We are usually lovers of only dark meat, however the breast meat was SO juicy we were converted! Great recipe! Thanks for sharing.

Fantastic. DH loved it. Got the chickens on a sale and used the second one for all sorts of things from chicken salad to the Best Easy Chicken Croquettes recipe also on this site. Will definitely make these again come sale time.

This was great! I didn't use  cayenne pepper or paprika, not a big fan of spicy. I used a 7lb chicken instead of 2 chickens. I even found white pepper! But don't think I needed it, and won't use it next time. I researched what the difference between white pepper and black pepper was, and it was basically visual. White pepper is used for sauces and other dishes that you want to stay clear. 
The family liked this chicken and I did too! I made this with roasted red potatoes from a recipe on this site and white rice. I was so proud of myself, made a lovely dinner for my family. Thanks so much!

I made this again using cut up chicken pieces. I patted the chicken dry with paper towels,put the spices in a plastic bag, added the chicken all at once and shook like heck. Cooked at 350 bottom side up for 30 minutes on baking sheet sprayed with cooking spray then turned and cooked another 25 minutes. It was amazing!!!!!!!!! And just a great reheated for leftovers!

Absolutely fantastic.  I made one batch of this precisely to recipe, but I took it out at just over 170.  I did another half batch and cut the salt according to some of the reviewers, and this batch I did in the slow cooker.  I strongly preferred it with more salt, and even though the meat was fantastic from the slow cooker, the skin didn't have a chance to get crisp.  (I actually took it out of the crock pot and put it in the oven for a few minutes at a really high temp just to get the skin a bit more crispy.  Worked well, but again, really preferred the to-recipe flavor best.)  I didn't baste, brine, add butter -- nothing.  And the meat fell off the bone.  Fantastic!

I had never roasted a chicken in my life and made this for a potluck.  Risky!  It flew off the table, and everyone loved it!!  Have made a huge amount of the spice mix to use it whenever we're in the mood.  Right now, I'm trying it just with drumsticks -- my picky kids (ages 5, 3, and 1) loved it!

I was so excited to try this recipe because I love rotisserie chicken.  People comment that this is better than store bought however, this was not the case for me.  I didn't cook the chicken as long as recommended because it met the internal temp. requirements after almost 3 hours and I didn't want it to dry out.  The outside of the chicken wasn't that deep, dark color you see from a store/restaurant bought rostisserie chicken and if I didn't have a thermometer, I would have guessed the chicken was not done based on the appearance of the outside.  Although the seasonings were good, they didn't seep into the meat and only flavored the outter parts of the chicken.  I'm glad I tried this recipe and was able to use the chicken in other recipes, it just didn't meet my expectations for a rotisserie chicken.

Terrific! I didn't use a whole chicken, just bone in pieces with skin on. Didn't change the recipe except to add a little more garlic and pepper to suit our taste. Cut up the onion and tossed it in the ziploc bag. I did marinate overnight and glad I did. You won't be sorry with this. Tastes better than the store and much cheaper too!

Made this last week and making it again this week. This will be a weekly make for my family since they love it and it is so easy to make!!! I followed the recipe to the T with only 1 minor add on.  I added 3 tablespoons of dice garlic as some other user suggested in the cavity of the chicken.  I ended up marinating for over 24 hours as one user suggested.  The house smelled simply delicious while the chicken was slow cooking in the oven for 5 hours.  I will say hands down that this seasoning mix will be one I will use time and time again.  I plan to make a bunch of the seasoning to have on hand as another user suggested.

OMGoodness! I thought I made a great roasted chicken until I tried this. I followed the recipe exactly but added half a lemon inside each cavity with the onion. This is amazing.

I have made this chicken many times and it has always come out very tasty and tender.  I only do one chicken at a time, but I make and use the entire recipe of rub.  Other than that the only difference I make is that about an hour into cook time I pour melted butter over the bird, and then halfway though the cooking time I flip it and do the same to the other side.  Amazing results every time.

I thought I had messed myself up when I realized I had bought bone in, skin on, split chicken breasts instead of two whole chickens. I decided to give it a try anyways and besides having to omit the onions followed the recipe closely. They only took me about 3hrs at 250 to cook and were EXCELLENT. The skin was crispy and they were so juicy that it actually spurted out a little when I cut into it. I cut up the meat to use later in other recipes.

I followed the directions EXACTLY and I have to say the seasoning was only on the skin. The meat of the chicken had no flavour in it at all. I even did as another reviewer suggested and put the spice mixture into a small bottle with a shaker top. **********UPDATE**********: I made this again, and I buttered the chicken A LOT before I sprinkled the spice mixture onto it. I also BASTED the chicken throughout the cooking process and this time it was certainly delicious and worthy of 5*'s!!!

I was wondering if the spices would make the chicken spicy hot rather than rotisserie style.  I was pleasantly surprised how the flavors all blended to make it taste store-bought!  I made this for a fancy dinner and liked the fact that I had plenty of time to work on other dishes while this roasted.

This chicken was fantastic!  I left out the cayenne since I didn't have any, but this was "peppery" enough without it.  I used a roaster that holds the chicken upright in the oven so the skin stays crispy on all sides.  I basted it occassionally, and the result was a moist chicken that tasted fantastic.  Served with yukon gold potatoes with sauteed onions and a salad, and we were in HEAVEN!!  Thank you Sue.  This one is a definite keeper.

Best chicken ever!!!  For Christmas I tried something different and placed 2 oranges and fresh rosemary springs inside, thin orange slices under the skin, sprinkled it with rosemary and then squeezed orange juice over the top just before placing it in the oven.  It was a huge hit and my mom couldn't get the recipe fast enough.  I also love it the original way it's listed.

This is a kid favorite in our house!  I made it exactly as directed the first time, but since then I leave out the cayenne as it makes it too spicy for the kids.  Other than that, perfect!  I have made it without leaving it in the fridge overnight too, with great results.  I served with roasted potatoes and broccoli as those are favorites in our house too.  And we throw all the bones and carcass into the crockpot to make overnight chicken broth!

I made this exactly as written except for the tempature.I have never roasted that low and was reluctant.I roasted it much higher then turned it lower.I also put some rub under the skin as well.It was the best chicken ever.Usually mine are blah and nothing special.Toward the end I added onion,carrots and potatoe that roasted wonerfully as well!
Special note since originally posted I used a pinch of salt as my Doctor requested lowering my salt.With so many spices it's perfect.

This was excellent.  I had a five pound roasting chicken, so I cooked it an hour longer and it was perfect.  We loved it and the grand children loved it.
Will make again and again!  Easy recipe!  Great taste!
It was nice to get it ready the night before, then get up and stick it in the oven...... great for Sunday after church.

It pains me to give this such a poor review.  I've had this recipe bookmarked for ages and have been itching to make it.  The only modification I made was to halve the recipe because I only wanted one chicken.  I used a good quality free-range organic chicken (a brand I normally otherwise love).  I otherwise followed this recipe exactly.  I kept checking the recipe before posting this because I was certain I missed an important ingredient or step.  Sadly, I did not.

The skin was tough and leathery.  My knife couldn't even cut through it.  Even though the skin is the most unhealthy part, I like to sneak a taste anyway and it was inedible.  The actual meat was tough and flavorless.  I tried the leftovers again tonight and I cannot recall ever eating such a flavorless pieces of meat (I tried both white and dark).  It's as if none of the seasoning penetrated the meat at all.

I had such high hopes for this recipe.

On this recipe I am rating the prep and seasoning, as I cooked the bird in the little rotisserie/oven that I have.  Followed beginning step by step  and it turned out wonderfully.   I deep fry turkeys all the time and this is how I prepare them for an overnight seasoning.  After bird is patted dry, I take a kitchen garbage bag, open all the way so it is laying flat on the counter, set the bird inside and season.  Then take the bag, wrap tightly around the bird, push as much air out as possible, twist the top and seal with a twisty.  Cut off excess bag and re-fridge.  I have always prepared my birds this way as it makes clean up a breeze.

Excellent recipe.  I sent this recipe to my sister who made it for our Three King's Day party.  It was superb.  She baked the chickens breast side down in oven bags.  I can't wait to make it myself. I made it myself at home twice. the first time not so great but the 2nd time was excellent.  I used the same seasoning but used whole garlic cloves instead of garlic powder (about 10 sprinkled in the pan). I also layed the chickens on a bed of leeks (no onion inside the cavity). I added about 1/2 cup of water to the bottom of the pan and sprinkled the chickens with a couple of tablespoons of brown sugar.  I baked uncovered at 400 degrees for about 20-30 min. then I tightly covered and baked for about 4 hrs at 275. Try it, seroiusly!

This was excellent - it was a great combination of seasonings.  I would imagine you can use this slow cooking method for any seasoning combo.  My one caveat is to be careful about the 5 hour timing.  The chicken I just roasted was 5.5 lbs and luckily I checked it at 4 1/2 hrs, because it was more than done (but fortunately not dried out yet).  Depending on how "fast" your oven is, it would be good to start checking the internal temperature earlier than 5 hours.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

One and only favorite rotisserie! Have been making this for a long time now and reviewed it long time ago (I think someone reported me lol). The only adjustments are: 1.5 teaspoon salt & 1/2 teaspoon onion salt. Also, sometimes I would slather butter under the skin. Oven time & temperature: for a 1 lb chicken, 400 degrees for 20 minutes then lower to 325 for 1.5 hours. **** For a 5lb thigh & 4lb drumstick: 400 for 20 minutes then 325 for another 40-50 minutes (drumsticks cook faster). Cover loosely with foil if it starts burning. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I made 3 of these today.  Very yummy.  I did two in the oven and 1 in the crock pot.  I must say, they didn't need 5 hours in the oven.  They were done in about 3 1/2 - 4 hours.  The one in the crock pot cooked on low for about 6 hours.  The smell of these chickens roasting in amazing.  I made the spice mix as directed.  It is very good, indeed and not too much kick at all.  Thanks for a good recipe.

Wonderful flavor, fall off the bone doneness and exceptionally juicy.  First time.  I used about 3/4 of the full rub recipe on one 4.5 pound chicken.  I used cooking string and toothpicks to hold the legs together and close up the chicken cavity after thoroughly rubbing the chicken outside, in the cavity and under the skin.  I put one white onion (quartered) and a heaping teaspoon of minced garlic into the cavity and used three plastic grocery bags to seal the chicken and marinated overnight.  I cooked the chicken at 250 F for 4 hours, 30 minutes checking the temperature at 3 hours, 30 minutes (166 F), 3 hours, 50 minutes (169 F), 4 hours, 10 minutes (171 F) and 4 hours, 30 minutes (174 F) and let stand for 15 minutes.  I used a large roasting pan with rack to roast the chicken and then boiled the drippings with 12 ounces of chicken broth and one tablespoon of cornstarch for gravy served over the chicken and garlic mashed potatoes.  Thank you Sue Rogers for a wonderful recipe!

I made a few changes but only because of ingredients I don't keep on hand.  First, I do not have white pepper, so I just used more black pepper.  Also, I only had crushed red pepper flakes, so I used those.  I roasted it for almost 5 hours, and put the chicken onto a serving plate, then poured a can of chicken broth in the roaster to loosen up the flavored bits, then poured that into a pan.  Than I mixed cornstarch and cold water in a jar, and slowly added that to the broth in the pan, and a little bit of milk to lighten it up.  When the gravy was done, I served it with the chicken, mashed potatoes, and corn.  Everyone liked it, even the picky kids!  I'm making it again this week.

This recipe is excellent! After 35 years of roasting chickens, this is by far my favorite recipe. I have made it twice and have had great reviews and raves from family and friends. Like other reviewers, I did not slow roast but put the chickens in at 325 for two hours.  (I did apply the rub to the chickens, stuffed them with the onions and refrigerated them in ziploc bags for 6 hours prior to baking). When baked, the meat fell off of the bones and was very moist.  One of these days I will try the slow-roast method.  This is a great and easy dish to serve to guests.

I originally found this recipe on another website, but this is same and it's the BEST roast chicken recipe. I just multiply the spices by 1 1/2 so there are plenty to rub on the chicken.  And, I cut down on the cayenne and black pepper so the kids will be more willing to eat it (too spicy otherwise).  This is so juicy and flavorful my family would choose this recipe for roast chicken almost every time (our next favorite is chef Thomas Keller's 'Simple Roast Chicken' on epicurious.com).  It's also very easy and makes your house smell wonderful all day.

Umm I hate to tell you but this was just a tedious method of preparing season all.  Use season all and the onion and save your self some time.  Good...but not original.

This is the best roasted chicken you can make.  I have two tips.  The first one is, brine that chicken overnight (soak chicken in salt water) to give it an over-the-top juiciness.  And the second is pre-mix the spice mixture and keep in a little jar for yourself or dress up the bottle and attach a recipe card and give them as Christmas gifts or party favors.

I make this all the time, I never realized this recipe was on here - I got it from a message board years ago. I use 2 onions per bird and do a rough chop. I pull the onions out of the cavity after the first 2 hours and let them sit in the bottom of the pan in the juices to finish cooking there. There's very ittle juice to baste with the first few hours - so I only baste the last hour or so. After the bird is done I remove it and add chicken broth and Wondra to the poan - makes a FANTASTIC spicy onion gravy over mashed potatoes.

Also  thre's no need to let it sit for a few hours after you have seasoned it - I season it and throw it right in the oven.

YES - it is 250º for 5 hours.

The baking style of cooking it on low for so long was great. The meat just fell off the bone.  But I thought the taste was so-so. It didn't seem to have any zip. There was something missing taste wise.  I'll keep looking for different spices but I'll cook it the same way.

I think this is my first time rating a recipe but it's so worth it. I only used 1 whole chicken that I brined in kosher salt, lemon, orange, onion & different fresh herbs for about 6hrs before doing this dry rub overnight.I also seasoned a couple pieces of butter to place between the meat & skin. This was the most flavorful moist chicken ever. I'm making it a second time tonight. We were actually considering buying a store bought chicken tomorrow for Sunday dinner due to exhaustion from the past week but I just couldn't bring myself to go that route knowing I can now make it just as good if not better! Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this multiple times now. I usually season it in the morning and then cook it in the afternoon. I always always put my whole chickens in a roasting bag. I have never had a chicken or roast for that matter dry out in a roasting bag.

Loved this chicken. We put it in a roasting bag in the fridge overnight and just popped it in the oven around noon for dinner at 5.  Chicken was so tender fell off the bones.  Will make again and again.

I made this Chicken yesterday, it is to die for!  I only made one chicken and used all of the rub called for in the recipe on the one chicken.  I followed everything else in the recipe except I didnt have white pepper, I just doubled the black.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! My beef loving husband said it was very good, and that is high praise from him for a chicken dish.  This will be the only way I roast chicken from now on.  Thanks again!

I tried this recipe for supper last night, i didn't have a whole chicken to try this on but i had chicken breasts, so i couldn't do the onion thing but i put all the spices in except i cut the salt back to 3 tsp instead of 4, i used granulated garlic instead of powder( from costco) and i used smoked paprika( which is simply the best paprika) i put the full 2 tsp in.
I sprinkled this all over the 3 breasts that i used, let them set for a bit and turned them over and put more on, i baked them at 350, for an hour then i brushed bbq sauce on them, believe it or not they were moist and tender, i thought they would be dry, but it was the tastiest chicken i ever made at home, i baked them for another 30 minutes after i put the bbq sauce on them. soon as i buy a whole chicken you bet i will do the whole chicken as written!

This chicken is the best!  I only had one chicken, but I left the seasonings as is but only used 2 teaspoons of salt.  I put it in the slow cooker instead of the oven (1.5 hours on high, 6 hours on low).  It was juicy and literally falling off the bones!

I love this seasoning blend! I don't use white pepper or thyme just for personal taste preferences. I also leave the salt out because it doesn't need it. One of my family's favorite dinners is "campfire chicken." I get 6 chicken thighs, a few baby red potatoes, some baby carrots, and a few ears of corn. Throw it all in an oven bag and sprinkle this seasoning mix all over it. It is so yummy!

OMGoodness!  I marinated and wrapped the 2 chickens overnight so I could throw them in the oven the next evening...I don't know if the mainating time made a difference or not, but these were absolutely heavenly!  Everything about this chicken was great!  I did, however, add some poultry seasoning to the recipe when I made the rub...

Ah, this is sooo good! I always start the day before & add a few garlic cloves & sliced lemon to the onion in the chicken cavity. Great in the oven or on the bbq using one of those "beer-butt chicken" racks. So tasty & juicy!

My husband grilled a 6 lb. whole chicken on the outdoor grill using the rotisserie.  I applied this rub about 10 hours prior to grilling.  The chicken turned out perfectly!  We loved the seasonings from this rub.  I'm not too sure how the word "Sticky" got in the title, though.  Next time, I'm going to add some cajun seasoning we bought in New Orleans for some added heat.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Sue.  Delicious!

Great recipe! I used the chicken breast as suggested by someone else (our personal preference) and they did super. So moist and such great taste. Family suggests that our chicken always be prepared by this recipe.

Well, I unintentionally marinated this 4.5 pound bird for two nights.  I slow roasted in for over five hours.  When I was sure it was done; I left it in the oven on 170 degrees just to keep it warm for dinner.  The meat was fall off the bone tender, the breasts were still moist and flavorful.  When it comes to cooking whole chickens, I will stick to this recipe from now on!  Even my extremely picky 10 and 13 year old girls both had extras and cleaned the meat off of their plates immediately!  My two year old boy ate it all up and asked for more.  My boyfriend helped himself to a little bit more.  I think the onions in the cavity make all of the difference... and the juices were way delicious.  I served the juices as is because I didn't want to alter the flavors at all by making a gravy.  Thank you for the recipe.  I'd give it 10 stars if I could!!!!

It was AB-SO-LU-TE-LY amazing!!! Everyone loved it! My oldest even ask me if I could make it again tomorrow!
Did the recipe as written except for the white pepper and the onions (forgot to buy them with the last grocery...) put garlic in it instead!! Let them marinated in the fridge like 15 hours!!
It was juicy and tender!
Thanks for sharing this!!! Will definitely cook this again!!!

I was really excited to try this recipe as we love the moist and flavorful taste of rotisserie chicken.  I used a 6 pound oven stuffer roaster and, other than adjusting the seasoning for our tastes, followed the recipe as written.  I cooked the chicken to 170 degrees.  After letting it sit for about 30 minutes, I cut into it and, unfortunately, the chicken was very dry and the skin was really tough.  I think I may have erred by putting the roaster up on a rack and the juices ran out to make it tough and dry.  I will use the recommended seasonings again because they were terrific.  But I think I will just roast the chicken according to package directions which usually produce a nice, moist chicken anyway.  But thanks for sharing the technique and, especially, the recommended seasoning!

Amazing.  I can't say enough about this recipe. Five adults in the house went nuts over this. Even after dinner, every time I came through the kitchen one of them was standing at the stove picking at it. I only made one chicken so I halved the seasoning. I put all the seasoning in a small bowl. The only thing I did different was to use Old Bay instead of the cayenne. I even forgot to do advance refrigeration part. My son and DIL even mentioned it again this morning before work. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Delicious! Didn't change a thing except halved ths spices (only roasted one 5 lb whole chicken) the cooking time was about 4 1/2 hours (turned it up to 275 towards the end to make sure it was done in time for dinner) Everyone loved this - its our new favorite! I will definitely be making this again & again.

This was amazing. Very tender and juicy. It did not taste like onions, which i was worried that they might overpower the flavor, but it was wonderful. I did use a entire tbs of galic powder and marinated it for 12 hours, I also used 2 whole chickens, I might try the boneless breasts next as a different review said they were yummy. As stated the chicken is fall off the bone. Next time i will double the chicken rub for extra flavor. a keeper for sure.

Dry as a bone.  I was so excited to make this one after all the positive reviews, but it was a big dud for me.  Nothing "sticky" or "rotisserie" about it at all, just dry chicken with sandpaper skin.  I followed the recipe exactly.

I've used this exact recipe for about 10 years now from a popular busy mom site.  I've done it in the oven getting a crispier skin when pressed for a quicker done time but in order to get the sticky skin I use the original method of 8 hrs. on low in the crockpot. Also, the original recipe I've used called for the exact same measure of spices listed here but for only one chicken.

Absolutely delicious! The only thing I did differently was that I did not refrigerate the chicken after putting the rub on... just stuck it right in the oven. The flavor was great anyway. Thank you! :)

Hands down the best whole chicken I've ever had.  I added minced garlic to the cavity along with the onion, added 4 Tbls of butter pats under the skin and set the birds on large chunks of union.  Also, my birds were almost 6 pounds a piece, and I cooked them exactly 5 hours.  Perfect!  So, I think smaller birds would require less cook time.  The drippings made gravy that tastes like it was straight from heaven.  Awesome recipe!!

This chicken is the most requested food I make!  From my 2 yr old to my husband, everyone loves this chicken!  I always serve this with plain white rice with the pan drippings from the chicken mixed in!  The rice is just as popular as the chicken!

Wow!!  How delicious and EASY!  I've seen this recipe countless times before but never tried it.  Well, whole chickens were on sale at my grocery store so I bought two and decided I'd try this recipe- based on all the good reviews.  I wasn't sure it would work; to be roasted so long at such a low temp.  But it was so good!  So much better than those rotisserie chickens I love to get at the grocery store.  The meat was so soft and just falling off the bone, as promised.  I used two pans (one for each chicken) and in one, I put in 1/2 lb. of baby carrots with some veggie broth.  They tasted good, but looked all shriveled up.  Served these with Slow Cooker Mashed Potatoes.  I loved this, but found it a little too salty, although I cut the salt amount in half.  Next time I may try different spices/herbs, maybe some lemon juice or something.  I did baste once during the last hour.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I have been making this Roast Sticky Chicken in the crockpot for years so when I found this I thought I would give it a try in the oven. I was very pleased with the results and will make in the oven again. Just to clear up some confusion in previous reviews the chicken is not supposed to be sticky. I believe the name comes from the "sticky" fingers you get when you rub the spices on the raw chicken.  Give this one a try!

WOW! This recipe deserves 6 stars! I didn't change a thing and was thrilled with the results. I put an oven thermometer in my oven and found that my oven was 25 degrees hotter than what it was set at so I adjusted the temp and the chicken took exactly 5 hours to cook as was stated. Great drippings for a sumptuious gravy too. Thanx!

This chicken came out soooooo good!!!!  I followed the recipe exactly and would not change a thing.  All the juices were sealed inside the chicken, the meat was like butter.  Be sure to carve this in a large pie plate or dish, otherwise you will have juice all over the counter!  Excellent.

This was my first time cooking with a whole chicken.  It turned out wonderfully!  I let this cook during church, so I didn't baste, I don't think it made a difference.  I did put a few big hunks of butter on the chicken, but I followed the recipe exactly otherwise.  I really did fall off the bone!  My husband and I enjoyed this nice Sunday lunch and I will definately make it again!

EXCELLENT! I normally only give five stars to recipes that I have followed to the letter, but the only alteration I made here was to use one chicken, and I had fresh rosemary on hand, which I used instead of the thyme. I'm sure it wouldn't have made a ton of difference - the magic is in the roasting. I only needed 4 hours, but it turned out perfectly! You don't need to baste at all, although I did for fun. It is so moist and juicy! Just like a real rotisserie chicken!

ABSOLUTLY DELISH!!!!!  The skin was a little tough but the bird was sooo moist!  The flavor was outstanding & the broth was rich without being heavy.  I did add two garlic cloves with onion & a pat of butter.  I diced potatoes and added carrots to the pan the last 2 hours.  The veggies basted in broth and we soaked up the rest of the broth with large slices of French bread.  Now I'm making chicken stock with the bones.  I will be making this again and again.  Thanks for sharing.

OMG - You must Try this! Plus -the most incredible gravy!

Ok  - I saw the 2K+ excellent reviews.  And...I agree!  My first time trying - I added some butter/olive oil to the skin on hour 3.  Then I added just a little water (1/4C) to capture the drippings.  After 4 hours I pulled and it was perfect.  I added some home made chicken broth to the drippings - a little roux and AMAZING tasting gravy!!!!!  Make this now!  I will NEVER make a whole chicken another way:):):)

This recipe is delicious; the chicken tastes as good as you'd want it to and it's very moist, so I'm giving it 5 stars. But a grocery-store rotisserie chicken is nearly as good and only slightly more expensive to buy than this is to make, so I'm not sure if I'll make this recipe again.

I love this recipe! I only do one chicken as there are only two of us. I make up a jar of the seasoning so I always have it on hand like one reviewer mentioned. I like to prep it the night before and then I put it in my electric roaster on Sunday morning. By the time we get home, it's ready to go.

This is a great recipe!  We made on snow day, so were able to enjoy the good smells all day long.  Be sure to watch the timing though.  We made a 5.5 pound chicken and it was done in a little less than 4 hours.  One chicken from Aldis, under $5.  Fed 4 of us for roast chicken, made 2 chicken quesadillas the next day, and finished it off by making a pot of chicken noodle soup with the remaining scraps.  I just love doing that!

I make this in my Traeger wood pellet grill which adds another layer of flavor. I also put butter and rub mixture under the skin of the breast as other posters did and finish off at a high heat to crisp the skin some.

I've been making this for a long time. The spice mix is great as is, but I usually add something or substitute a different spice or herb. I also stuff the cavity with pieces of green bell pepper as well as the onion. I open the oven after the chicken has been in for about 3 hours and there's enough juice in the pan to baste the chicken with. I start checking the temperature at 4 hours. Sometimes, the chicken is done after 4.5 hours, so it doesn't hurt to check. I baste it again too. This recipe doesn't mention basting, but I think it helps keep the skin from getting dry and rubbery. 

After I take it out of the oven, I tent the pan loosely with foil. This helps to soften the skin up a bit.

On occasion, there will be leftover chicken, and I like to use it make Chicken Tortilla Soup.

You only have to cook it to 165 degrees!!!If you cook it to 180 its going to be dried out and tough!!!  This is one of the BEST recipes for chicken!! I have been making it for several years and it has the best flavor!!  I always cook whole chickens and turkey breast side down as it makes for the moistest breast meat you will ever eat. If you want the breast browned.... flip it over the last 20 minutes or so, so it browns. Thanks for an awesome recipe and I don't have to dirty up my rotisserie as I hate cleaning that thing!

I made this recipe as written. Chicken was good, but for us, we thought it was a bit too salty and the white pepper a bit overkill. I made it a second time w/ some tweaks - no white pepper, 1/2'ed the salt, cooked @ 350 for 1.5 hours - came out w/ the same crispy skin and the flavor was more to our preference. Recipe is a keeper w/ my family tweaks in line.

YUM!!  I cut the cayenne and black pepper in half for my kids, but otherwise kept all of the spices the same.  Although I accidentally used the smoked paprika instead of regular, and boy did that add some depth of flavor - I might make that "mistake" again.  Unfortunately, I didn't prepare enough ahead of time, so I could only let the chickens sit in the fridge for a couple of hours before cooking them.  Again, another time crunch so I couldn't slow cook them at 250.  Even so, this chicken was amazing!!  The spices are spot-on delicious.  I can't wait to make this again next time, only let them sit longer in the fridge and slow cook them at 250.  FYI - save the carcass and bones and some of the meat and then make chicken soup with them - it took my already awesome homemade soup to a whole new level with some of the leftover spices mixed in.  And it really makes the chicken go farther when you can make a whole pot of soup the next day.  AMAZING!

Great recipie, even better than the store bought rotisserie. I followed a couple of suggestions made here: halved the salt, added minced garlic to the cavity with the onions then brushed the outside with olive oil before baking. It was wonderfully moist and flavorful and the outside was crisp.

Nope!  As an experienced home chef who makes roast chicken at least every other week, this is by far my least favorite recipe.  While I appreciated the over-night dry seasoning, the cooking method left me with a dry, tough skinned bird that was done over two hours early.  Even the sauce that I made with the drippings couldn't cover the dry, tough meat.  I'm glad it's worked out for so many other cooks, but I'll be going back to my basic recipes from now on.  A chicken is a terrible thing to waste.

This is delicious!!!  I used this recipe exactly and baked (2) 4 lb chickens.  I rubbed the chickens the night before and wrapped in plastic wrap until the next day.  Baked at 225 and checked after four hours.  They temped out at 180 after four hours so I covered until sides were done.  Absolutley wonderful!!!  Served with green beans and roasted sweet and white potatos!!!  OMG amazing!!!  Make sure to spice the inside of the chickens as well as the outer.  Flavor went all the way through the meat.  Lots of left overs!  Made a giant chicken pot pie the next night!!!  Next time I will make sure to rub the spice under the skin as we do remove this before eating.  Keeper!!!

Made this 5 star recipe using 8 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  I combined the rub and sprinkled on both sides of each breast and placed in a large covered dish overnight in the refirgerator.  I transferred the chicken breasts into a large turkey size baking bag, floured the bag and cut slits in the top.  Tied the bag and placed in a large roasting pan at 350 degrees for 1 1/2 hours.  I removed from baking bag and placed in  a large crockpot for about an hour on high.  Melt in your mouth delicious!  This is a rather spicy rub so if you don't like spicy - you might want to cut down on some of the paprika and peppers. Thanks for sharing!  Will definitely make again!

Excellent, flavorful, and juicy.  Also try using a whole chicken cut-up, and bake on 300 for 2 hours.  Make a gravy from the yummy drippings!

This was great.  I was moving equipment and didn't get back home in the 5 hour period.  Was afraid my chicken would be dry.  Even after 6 hours in the oven it was moist and delicious.  Had it with potaoes last night, today is a chicken risotto.  Boiling the carcass as I type for broth or soup.  Only used one chicken and we will get lots of meals off of it.

Very moist, flavorful chicken. The only deviation was subbing basil for thyme since I had none. Will definitely make this again.

I used the seasoning for boneless chicken breasts that i cooked at 350 for 25 minutes in 2T of melted buter, so my review is solely on the spices.  There was nothing "sticky" about this at all.  It literally tastes like season-all and i didn't find anything memorable about it at all.  I'm glad I didn't use a whole chicken for this.

I tried this last night using a whole 5lb chicken (skipped refrigerating overnight). Before I seasoned the chicken I rubbed it with CountryCrock light spread. I used half a onion and bell pepper to stuff the chicken cavity. Then I added a little more paprika, onion and garlic powder then what the recipe calls for. I also added about 1/2 tsp to 1 tsp of ground sage and 1 tsp of Mrs.Dash fiesta lime. I didn't use as much salt. I covered the chicken with foil bending it at the top and baked @ 350 for 2hrs 15mins. The taste was great. My hubby and kids kept talking about how much they enjoyed the meal.

Good roast chicken recipe. I roasted it at 450 for about 30 mins in order to crisp the skin and then reduced to 250. However there is not an exact set time, more important is the internal temperature. Roast @250 until the internal temp. of the Thigh reads 165. Dont roast to 180, it is not necessary and results in drying out the chicken!

Honestly, I have NO clue what all the fuss is about? These chickens were okay but surely nothing to rave about. They were moist but the flavoring wasn't doing it for us. Rotisserie chicken it isn't. It has an odd taste. I cooked two 5 lb chickens and had to double the seasoning to cover both of them. I can make a better roast chicken in 1/2 the time, that comes out just as moist and tastier. I also don't get the "sticky" part?

I marinated this for 5 hours - did everything according to the recipe.  Came out so wonderful.  Flavorful and juicy.  I served with gravy from the drippings, baked potatoes, peas and we even at the onion that was in the chicken - tasted wonderful!

All I can say is Well Worth the Wait! DH wanted to grill the chickens and I flat out said, "No. I want to make them by the recipe." He won't ask again. Mine took longer, but the birds were about 5lbs. each. Made gravy from pan drippings. WOW! Really just the yummiest and most tender chicken ever! Absolutely a keeper!

We like salty and we like spicy, but this was too much of both.  The skin, my favorite part, was inedible because it was so salty.  Half the amount of salt would be more than enough.

Amazing flavor and I didn't let it marinate for anytime at all. 6.5 lb bird that cooked for 2 1/2 hrs this was great!! I will do this again and next time let it marinate w/ all the seasonings.

The spice mix is awesome! I would use this spice mix again. However I did not use the cooking times because I don't have that kind of time. I had it at 450F for an hour. Whent he top started to brown, i placed an aluminium foil on top (just float on the top) I have never had my chicken so tender and juicy, especially the chicken breasts. I marinated about 4 hours. And baked breast side up.

Great way to cook chicken - I have to admit, I hadn't considered a low temp for 5 hours. I used a 8# bird and kept spice mix as listed - complete with overnight marinade. Next time I will reduce the salt a bit. Mostly super easy, although I did flip the bird halfway through (started with breast side down). The best thing is no basting required! Chicken turned out very moist. Will definitely make again. Many thanks for the recipe.

I have made this chicken at least 10 times now and it may be my  families favorite meal.  I actually triple the spices.  I also rub minced garlic, the spices, and a bit of olive oil  directly on the  breast, underneath the skin.  I cook  the chickens breast side down for the first two hours than turn them over for the rest of the cooking time.  I also baste a few times during the last two hours of cooking.  My kids  also like when I add extra onions and quartered new potatoes to the pan so they can cook in the juices.

This was the best chicken ever. A must try! Did make a few small changes... First we doubled the ingredients for two whole chickens that weighed  a little over 4 pounds each. We did cut the salt in half. Put it in the fridge overnight. The next day I cut up some potatoes and carrots and also  some boiler onions and placed those around the chickens in the roasting pan. I then added half a can to a whole can of chicken broth over the veggies. Put it in the over at 250 degrees for 5 hours and it came out incredible.  Everything was so juicy and flavorful. We used the leftovers for Pot Pies, Chicken Tacos, and Chicken and Dumplings and let me just tell you this was absolutely the best chicken we have ever eaten!!! Thank you for the recipe!! Simple and easy to cook yet amazing to taste and eat!!! You can't possibly screw this up. Follow the directions and just add a little broth while cooking.  You can also use the broth to baste the chicken and give it the deep golden brown skin color. AWESOME!! ENJOY!!

This recipe is wonderful! I followed all instructions to the letter and it turned out exactly as promised. So moist, and the flavor is delicious! Even better than a store-bought rotisserie chicken. I'll definitely be making this again. 5 stars!

This was great! I stuffed mine with some onions and garlic to go with the spice rub and it turned out juicy and tasty. I will be using this recipe as my default from now on. I only had four hours to cook mine in though so I increased the temp to 300 degrees and it turned out fine.

Such a good recipe!!! The only changes I made were to 1/2 spices since I did one chicken,  added 1 tsp brown sugar to seasoning mix for extra 'stickiness', and put small pats (2tb total, chunked up) of butter between skin and breast, also stuffed cavity with celery tops and 1/2 a white onion. I did baste it a few times and it only took a little over 3 hrs, but I only did one chicken and had to increase temp for last hour for side dish cause I only have one oven- how medieval, I know =) Served it with Roasted Beets 'n' Sweets and Eat Michigan Salad (AWESOME salad!) from this site. What a wonderful Sunday family dinner! Bonus: Thought about making a gravy from the juices, but it was so good, it didn't need gravy so instead I made a stock from the carcas and juices with carrots, celery and onion, filled stock pot with just enough water to cover, plus added seasoned salt to taste, simmered for about an hour.  Scooped out major chunks and poured through cheesecloth into a glass pitcher.  Once cooled, I funneled it into an old juice container and froze it. Can't wait to make a soup from my homemade stock!

Oh! My! Yum! I made this in a exactly as stated.  I cooked it in a stone dish.  The only thing I would caution is be sure of the size of your bird.  My chicken was smller so only needed to be cooked about 4 hours.  

Once you've made this you may never buy a store made rotisserie chicken again!

I bought several chickens, cooked one and froze he rest - already cleaned, seasoned and ready to go in the oven.

Put it in the oven before church, come home to a prepared lunch!

This chicken was awesome.  It was moist and very flavorful. It did however take longer than five hours in my oven.  Maybe my chickens were a little large.  I will definitely be making this again.

This is the second time i've made this (first was with leg quarters)and it tastes just like Rotisserie Chicken from the Deli! I used a 6 lb. chicken, and then made chicken gravy out of the drippings (this rub makes very flavorful gravy)by wisking 1/4 flour into one cup of water, then stirring it into the pan drippings until boiling. I also have enough chicken and gravy to make a chicken bake tomorrow, and will use the bones to make chicken stock. Talk about getting your Five dollar's worth! The rub is the secret to being so flavorful, gravy, leftovers, and all.

Yeah - this is the Best.  I've prepared as the recipe states (overnight in the fridge), as well as just putting the spices on & In, and popping it directly in the oven.  It is delicious, tender, moist...perfect.  ONLY change I make...I don't have any white pepper so I double the black.  I make double the spice mix so I have extra on hand.  I've used the rub for chicken breasts on the grill, steak on the grill, mixed with ground beef for burgers...and the best yet was for veggies.  The husband hates veggies - but I mix up a little of this rub with some grapeseed oil (better than Olive!) and brush it on veggies and throw them on the grill.  He'll eat any veggies now.  The spice part of the recipe should have a separate listing - it is SO versatile and so delicious.  Thanks for the Perfect recipe!

Mmmm... This is the best roast chicken recipe! I use cut up chicken pieces and after letting them marinade over night I rub a little butter on top before baking for added flavor. Very delicious, make sure to use a lot of onion, they come out beautifully caramelized and delicious!

Well worth making. The carcass makes absolutely wonderful broth! - don't throw it away! Edited to add: This recipe has become a real standby for us. I've actually mixed the seasonings and keep them in my spice cabinet for easy preparation. It takes about 5 teaspoons of spice mix per bird. This is also great just to make for stocking  up meat for chicken salads and other recipes using cooked, chopped chicken.

I did like the spiciness, and leftovers were excellent on sandwiches. My 3 lb chicken was done in just about 2:45. I wasn't crazy about how dry the outside looked though. It definitely wasn't sticky; maybe using a cooking bag or some foil would change that? The taste was great, I would just definitely carve it and baste before serving so it looks more appetizing.

I left out the white pepper and the cayenne pepper, and I tripled the rest of the seasonings. I added some sprigs of fresh rosemary and several cloves of garlic to the cavity. I mixed half the seasonings with olive oil and rubbed them under the skin and then sprinkled the other half on the outside of the chicken (which I rubbed in butter.) I used a wire rack to elevate the chicken above a can of chicken broth, a can of water, and a cup of white wine. It's not the spices or the method you use to incorporate them into the chicken, it's the lengthy cooking time at a low temperature that really makes this recipe. This chicken is MUCH juicier and more tender than chickens I've made using the 350 (or more) degree way. I also thought the skin (I only eat the skin on the breast, legs, and wings) was perfectly crisp and did not need to be blasted at a higher temperature to get that way. I cooked a 5.75 pound chicken for 5 hours and 15 minutes at 250, and it was perfectly cooked through.

Surprising how easy and wonderful this is. I followed the recipe as it is. I did add some potatos and carrots underneath the chicken as other reviewers have suggested. I also marinated the chicken over night, with the onion inside the chicken. I used a meat thermometer and it has an alarm when the chicken reaches 170 - so it was easy to cook this to the perfect temp. I took 4 tbsp of butter and rolled in the spices and squished the pats underneath the breast skin. I took one cup of chicken broth and one TBSP of cornstarch to make a gravy. I will make this at least once a week!
7/9/08 I had frozen a whole chicken with the spices, and thawed for 2 days. Slow roasted at 230 degrees for 2.5 hours and then 250 degrees for 1.5 hours... flipping 2 to 3 times. This was awesome. Served with mashed red potatoes and lima beans. Also took the drippings to make a mouth watering gravy. With 1 cup chicken broth, 1 tbsp cornstarch. Thank you! Thank you! When chickens are on sale, I'll have my butcher cut the chicken into 8 pieces, and then I'll spice and dice an onion and freeze in a ziploc bag.

Wow. I used drumbsticks and cooked them in my crockpot. I was worried the chicken wouldn't be crispy. But it was perfect, crispy skin, tender chicken, I cooked them on low for 6.5 hrs but i would reduce it to maybe 5.5 hrs- 6 next time. THANK YOU for the recipe!

My husband, who lives on chicken, loved this and said it was the best rotisserie style chicken he's ever had.  I brined it the night before in the Out of this World Turkey Brine from this site.  In the morning I put the spices on, and had it in the oven for the afternoon.  Didn't have any onion, so threw a few crushed garlic cloves in the cavity. It wasn't browning much after 3 hours, so I buttered it at that point.  I cooked one 4 lb. chicken at 250 for 4 hours, then put it under the broiler for a few minutes, turning it to brown all sides.  Super moist and tender.  Was a tad bit salty - not sure if that's the recipe or the combo of brining it first, but not bad at all.  Saved the giblets to boil in water to make a broth which I used to make gravy from the drippings - yum! **Update: I like to make a large amount of the seasoning mix to have on hand.  It's our go-to chicken rub for grilled/sauted boneless skinless chicken breasts.

This is our family's FAVORITE chicken recipe!  Our son asks for it often.  I omit the cayenne and white pepper, and double the black pepper and also the garlic powder.  After the first hour, I baste the chicken every 30 minutes or so with the pan juices.  It carmelizes the skin perfectly.  AWESOME RECIPE!  :o)

My husband has requested this three times this month!  To make it quicker, I've used a whole chicken already cut up and rubbed the spice mixture on it. I set the oven at 350 and in an hour or until the bird reaches 180 degrees, I have a beautiful chicken dinner.  I baste the chicken with a little butter and and chicken broth.  I've paired this dinner with potatoes but our recent favorite is some grilled squash from a friends' garden.  A few times I haven't measured anything and just sprinkled the spices on the chicken, still came out great.  On a whole chicken, I double the spices but keep the cooking time the same. Rubbing some butter underneath the skin makes it really crispy.   We're having this tonight with some friends!

My family LOVED this!  I loved how EASY it was and how wonderful it smelled and tasted!  A winner recipe all the way around.  The adjustments I made were;  I used 1 tsp. celery salt, and 1 1/2 tsp. paprika, and reduced the cayenne to 1/4 tsp. (kids...)  I also used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, marinated them over night, and threw it all in the crock pot on low.  Couldn't be easier!  THANK you for such an easy delicious recipe.

I ended up roasting these way too long (thought I would get home sooner, but stuff happens). Consequently, the texture of the meat was mushy.  However, the flavor was excellent.  I followed others' advice and doubled the spice mixture (careful about the cayenne, though). The skin was very crispy. I think this is a great recipe, but check the chickens after about 4 hours to make sure you don't overcook them.  The bones made excellent soup, too.

Delicious. I only used one chicken and did not marinate it at all. I halved the seasonings and did not coat the cavity. I baked the 6.5 lb. chicken at 350 degrees for around 2.5 hours without stuffing inside.
It came out delicious! Great recipe.

The best part of this recipe is the slow cooking time.  I think THAT is the true reason this recipe is so wonderful.  I find that stuffing the cavity with lemon wedges, onion and parsley really adds a nice flavor.  Also, I melt butter and brush it over the seasoned chicken before I pop it in the oven.  That helps with browning.

I have made this several times now & decided to update my review.  The first time I made this, the flavor was a little oniony - so now I use 1 potato quartered and 1 onion quartered to stuff the chicken with.  This recipe makes the moistest chicken I have ever cooked!  We can only eat one chicken for dinner, so I pick the meat off the other chicken & use it to make Brunswick Stew for the next night's dinner.

This really does taste like a store bought Rotisserie chicken- The only things I did different was I added around 1/4 cup of olive oil to a large freezer bag w/the seasonings and chicken and massaged it- I also just cooked it at 350 for just over an hr.... just check it at an hr and go from there to adjust your time as needed (everyone’s oven is different)

This is the best roasted chicken, ever!  So juicy and flavorful.  I was very suspicious of the 250F temperature, but it's key to this recipe.  Well worth the time it takes to cook.

Used one 3.5-lb chicken, decreased salt, added 1 tsp Chicken Seasoning and 1 tsp brown sugar. Rubbed olive oil all over the chicken before rubbing with spices. I placed 1/2 onion, 3 cloves garlic, and 1/2 lemon in the cavity of the chicken, and I only marinated for 4 hrs. Roasted mine for 3.5 hrs at 250 F. 

Good, and quite juicy, but not as flavorful as expected. Pretty close to store-bought rotiserrie, though. Would make again, but will continue tweaking.

Wow ~ what a great chicken this turned out to be last night! Even though there wasn't anything *sticky* about it ~ the flavoring was amazing. I didn't refrigerate overnight like the directions state. Instead, I just seasoned the chicken folling the directions and placed it right in the oven ~ I cooked it higher too ~ at 350 degrees for about 2 1/2 hours. The meat was so tender and full of flavor.

My Gawd this was the best roast chicken I have ever had! I used cornish hens and added extra garlic powder and cooked it at 350 for 1 hour and didnt even let the chicken marinate. So juicy bursting with flavor...o my... ^_^

I used this recipe on bone-in chicken breasts.  I cooked 3 chicken breasts bone side up and just placed the onions on top.  I cooked on 250 degrees, and the chicken was done in 2 1/2 hours.  The house smelled incredible, the chicken was moist and delicious.  My husband could not stop raving about how good it was!  It's definitely a keeper!

DELICIOUS!!  This was a terrific recipe Sue.  I used 2 cornish hens and left out the cayenne since I was feeding this to my 1 year old.  Had I known how simple and delicious this was, I would have started making chicken this way a long time ago.  I used fresh thyme since that's all I had and basted ever so often with melted butter.  I cooked my 2 hens for 3 hours and turned the oven off and let them rest for about 1 hour in the warm oven.  Sooo good.  Will definitely keep this in my recipe box.  Thanks again.

I don't know how anyone could NOT love this!The overnight rest in the fridge is well worth it....and this is the ultimate way to heat up the house in the winter or even better if you have an actual rotisserie....I've been making this for 8 years now...and it's been published in cookbooks(through my husbands work)It's EXCELLENT!Thanks!

I make a 5+ lb rotisserie chicken just about every weekend and it takes about 1 hour plus a 10 min wait period before cutting up.  I use a temp probe to ensure leg, breast and wing joint are all cooked to correct temp.  The bird is spiced.  It comes out extremely juicy and flavorful.

Baking/roasting a chicken for 5 hours is ridiculous.  We used to bake/roast (not for 5 hours) and the oven generated plenty of heat and required a cleaning cycle after EACH roasted bird.  Purchasing a rotisserie spit for your grill is the way to go.  For the past year, we have never roasted a whole chicken in an oven.  Spend the $90-100 and enjoy.  Clean up is a snap.

This is one of our family favorites. We make it exactly like the recipe states. We don't eat the skin, but leave it on while cooking to keep the moisture in, and then strip it off before serving. Absolutely delectable in every way. Restaurant Quality every time.

This was a delicious rub. Even if you don't have time to let it rest in the rub for the recommended time it still adds lots of flavor. Good for a regular oven and a rotisserie. I also used it on a turkey breast and the leftovers made such a delicious soup I barely had to add seasonings the rub added so much flavor. Very good. Would serve to guests.

I modified the recipe by making turkey legs instead of whole chickens. I used 6 drums baked at 350 degrees for an hour covered, also i didnt put in Cayenne pepper. Rotated the droms, re-applied leftover spices, added a cup of water, and baked another 30 mins uncovered. Turned out delicious and my 7 year old ate a whole drum by himself.

The BEST, the BEST, the BEST! Don't change a thing. I did like the idea of using the drippings with flour or cornstarch to make a gravy. 
I make this at least twice a month and there's always something you can do with leftovers if the whole family doesn't devour it.

this was great. I cooked at 450 degrees for 20 minutes in a preheated oven, then at 400 for 45. I only cooked one chicken and halved the spices. It tasted just like a store bought rotisserie! My family loved it.

I know I'm in the minority but I didn't love this recipe. I have made it twice and it hasn't thrilled me. The chicken wasn't dry but it wasn't what I would call juicy either. I did all of the seasonings and even used real garlic inside, along with the onion and more of the spices. I also added some chicken broth to the bottom of the pan and some pats of butter to the skin because I make roast chicken all the time and this had no aroma...that pretty much made me think there might not be a ton of flavor. I was right. Thanks for the recipe but I don't think I'll try it a third time. Also, the skin didn't get "sticky" but I don't know how it would with just those spices. There's nothing in there to caramelize so I'm not sure how that would happen. Thanks anyway though! Glad it's working for everyone else.

I have made this for years, and fine recipe. Here are a few tips:

*frozen whole chicken, let almost thaw then back in frig for over night- Always keep it completely wrapped. Use fresh whenever possible. 

*Use large thick oven pans or two with 2 birds. Do not crowd the birds.
 
*after rinsing and cleaning the bird, really dry it with towels or whatever- a wet bird will not grab rub. 

*I like to mix the dry rub into small amount margarine and rub the birds thoroughly in and out, under skin, my convection oven keeps the spices from melting off with the drippings. 

*while the recipe says 5hrs it is more important to just bring the internal temp upto 180', which will depend a lot on how cold the bird was before you put in the oven. The onions help keep the cavity open for heat exchange also. 

*I think Lawry's season salt with some italian seasoning, pepper, and paprika  work just fine in a pinch. IT is the marinating and low slow that make the bird so good.

*also chicken parts - work just fine also if you cannot find a whole bird or afford it. 

*last thing -never remove the skin or de-bone the chicken before hand- after the bird has baked and rested - remove the skin then- for whatever health benefit removing the skin before cooking takes all the taste away as does de-boneing. "i just do not trust meat with a bone in it", then your an idiot.
 
Everyone should try this recipe.

This was great. Easy, no fuss and the chicken was moist with crunchy skin that my husband loves. I'm going to try it with pieces. This is how I will cook chicken from now on.

great taste but I didn't add the cayenne because my son is fairly picky about "hot stuff" but it was one of the best rubs for flavour,  very moist chicken, I use a thermometer every time so I don't overcook it

I've been cooking chicken for 25 years and this is the best whole chicken I've ever made...worth the long cooking time. Like others, I reduced salt by half and didn't miss it. One daughter thought it was perfect, and the other picky one thought the onion flavor was a bit too strong so next time I will use 1/2 an onion and a celery stalk in the cavity. Thanks Sue!

I love recipes where you allow the flavorings to penetrate the whole dish and where the results are excellent.  This makes a very moist, flavorful, chicken that is virtually no problem.  I had unexpected guests the night I first tried this recipe.  I just made a little extra rice and veggies and had a wonderful meal.  They raved over it and we loved it.  I now keep extra of the spice mix already prepared and have used it not only on chicken but also on pork.  It's good.

Spectacular!  I have made this chicken several times over the last couple of years, and it always turns out perfect.
As other reviewers suggested, I always apply the spice mix inside and out, add in garlic, celery and rosemary with the onion inside the chickens, put the chickens in gallon zipper bags, and refrigerate overnight.
Today I will serve one chicken for dinner, and shred the second one to make King Ranch Chicken Casserole, also from this site. (Which is a super easy crowd pleaser!)

This was great! I also put the seasoning under the skin. I added garlic in the cavity along with the onion. I only marinated it for a few hours. I made a gravy with the pan drippings using cream of chicken and a few tbs of corn starch. My husband loved it and my 3 year old devoured it.

This is a 10 star recipe. So unbelievably easy and insanely delicious. You will never buy a rotisserie chicken ever again.  I made a 8.66 lb roaster and took others suggestions in letting it marinade overnight.  I cooked it 5 hours at 250 and the last hour brought the temp up to 350.  It was so incredibly juicy and the meat just fell off the bones.  This recipe is most definitely a keeper!!!

I've made this chicken about four times now - it's excellent and the leftovers are great, too!  I misread it the first time, and used all the rub on one chicken - very good, so I do it every time now.  I've never had enough time to marinate the chicken, so I just rub in the rub and roast it.  Several times, I've used the slow cooker (which I often use for whole chicken) and that works great - 1 hour on high plus 4-5 hours on low; check temp with instant read thermometer.  (See Baked Slow Cooker Chicken on this site) Thank you for the great recipe!

This chicken is so delicious. I have made it numerous times in a vintage rotisserie cooker, and as it spins around, it self-bastes it's spicy deliciousness all over the bird. Because of this recipe, my rotisserie cooker has earned it's 1.5 square feet of valuable space on my counter.  If you use a rotisserie cooker, the chicken only takes a fraction of the time to cook.

Tailor this recipe to your tastes.  I made mine a little bit more spicy by adding extra cayenne, pepper and garlic.  I also double the recipe and go heavy on the rub.  I find it is best when i plastic-wrap it and leave it in the fridge overnight.

I did not like this at all. It did kind of taste like rotisserie, but it was dry, mealy, totally overcooked. It might be good if you cooked an hour or so less. For all the time and energy, just go buy a rotisserie chicken!

We call this onion butt chicken. I use two big chicken and stick them in my grandmother's old turkey roaster.  It comes out so tender and juciy.  One chicken is used for sunday dinner served with mash potatoes and green beans the other one is shredded for tacos, enchiladas or whatever casserole is on the menu for the week.

This chicken was amazing!  I only used 1 4 lb. chicken  and halfed the spices.  I cooked it for a total of 4 hours and it came out perfectly.  I added new red potatoes and carrots about halfway through the cooking time, and they came out perfectly.  I took advice with the reviews and made a gravy out of the drippings and it was so delicious!  Best roasted chicken ever!

Awesome!! I have tempted to make whole fryer chicken before and was not successful.  This recipe is amazing.  In addition to stuffing the cavity with onion, I added lemon.  I also basted the chicken with butter.  Thank you, I love this recipe!

I love me some rotisserie chicken. This is the second time I made this. It's absolutely marvelous.  I left the marinaded chicken in the fridge for over 36 hours and baked it at 250 for 4.5 hours. Baked some herbed baby potatoes and carrots. Made basmati and vegetable rice in the rice cooker and had wonderful Mother's Day brunch.

Loved it. I have made this so many times now. I doubled it and cut the pepper for our Thanksgiving turkey. It was my first time doing all the cooking since mom passed. I have cooked a turkey but this was for the whole family. Everybody loved my rub. I have it printed and on the fridge as a "go to" for any chicken.

Wow! This was so good and incredibly tender! The next day all I had to do was shred some of it, put it in the microwave, and then mix some BBQ sauce in it and it was just like a pulled pork sandwich! The chicken is so tender that it works. For those of you concerned as there are mixed reviews on the cooking time, I cooked it exactly as it says. I didn't even use a meat thermometer... I know it's bad. The slightest change I might make for next time: double the spice mixture and rub it under the skin.

I've made this twice now and it just falls apart.  It only took my 4.5lb chicken 3 hours to finish at 250 degrees, so make sure you check your thermometer every hour or so.  I left it in the fridge over night before cooking and it was DELISH both times!!  UPDATE: I also used it as a turkey rub for thanksgiving twice.  Once I fried the turkey and once I roasted it.  Both times it was very tender, juicy, and the skin was wonderful.

The seasoning was perfect and the meat was very tender off the bone.  My grill did not cook at a lower temp, so it cooked slightly faster, but still stayed juicy.  I will be making this again for our Memorial Day Barbque!

I didn't have overnight to marinate it so what I did differently was I added olive oil to the spice mixture and then I rubbed the chicken all over, including the cavity and then I made a large pocket under the skin in the front and the back of the bird and rubbed the spice under the skin. I also inserted the spice into the meat in several places with a syringe.

Then I took the drippings from the chicken, put them in a pan on the stove and reduced it down to make a pan sauce. I added a little more onion and garlic powder, and cayenne pepper and paprika, and also a bit of rosemary and oregano. It was still missing something so I decided to add a little bit of duck sauce. That made the sauce!

This review has been a long time coming.  I've been using this recipe for over 2 years at least x2 amonth if not more.  Chickens are cheap around here usually cook two.  My family love it, Along with the home made mashed taters that go with it.  We really appreciate the recipe thanks.  Oh yeah, don't change a thing!

Didnt have time to marinate it overnight, but it turned out amazing !!! I placed the seasoning mix in between the skin and the meat with a couple of tabs of butter. Seasoned the skin with olive oil. Pan drippings made the best gravy !!!New Family Favorite !!!

Let's see- a delicious rotisserie chicken costs $4.99 at the grocery with NO effort.  This recipe cost $8.00 for the chicken, involved prepping overnight, and cooking for 5 hours with a mediocre combo of seasonings.  It's a no brainer for us. NEVER AGAIN.

This chicken is so juicy and flavorful!  My only complaint is the white pepper!!!  I knew it was too much when it was all I could smell all day while the chicken was cooking.  It totally took over the chicken.  I ate a piece of skin and ran for my glass of water because of the spiciness of the white pepper.  Next time I will definitely cut it in half or leave it out all together.

I love rotisserie chicken and I would always wonder how much it would cost to buy a rotisserie of my own - but not anymore! This recipe is perfect, perfect! When I placed my chickens to roast, I put them breast side down throughout the entire cooking time. I've always put my whole roasting chickens breast side down - a tip from Julia Child who said that the juices from dark meat trickled into the breast meat and keeps it juicy. I've not done it any other way. My "JC" chickens cook up juicy and French, but Sue's recipe gives that "rotisserie" flavor. Next time I want to try using a packaged taco seasoning mix for a TexMex flavor - I think with the marination and slow roasting it would be deeeelicious. Thanks Sue!!!

Like so many reviewers have said, this is hands down the best chicken I have made in my life!  It is crazy delicious, unbelievably moist and tender.  We used the leftovers for the best chicken sandwiches in the days afterwards.  One tip I would mention - the marinading step is essential... people that have skipped it have drier birds... when the chicken marinades, the rub turns to a paste which makes a crust on the chicken while it bakes.  I am trying this recipe tomorrow with chicken breasts instead of the whole chicken, trying to be a little bit healthier.  I have definitely added this to our regular menu.  Yum, yum, yum!!

First time I have made this and it was fantastic!  I only had a 5 pound chicken, so I halved the spices and rubbed them on.  Marinated for 3-4 hours.  Cooked in oven for 3 hours at 250 degrees and the chicken was moist, tender, and fall off the bone good.  I will definitely be making this again and will coat the onion (which is inserted into the cavity of the chicken) with spices before inserting.

This chicken was excellent, did bake on a rack. Followed the recipe exactly, added chicken broth to pan while baking and made excellent gravy. Will be making this often.

Wow! This chicken is amazing. The seasoning is perfect, and it is so tender and juicy. This recipe will definitely go into heavy rotation at my house. I'm going to use the leftovers to try "Cajun Chicken and Sausage Gumbo" by yoyo78 (from this site) tomorrow, since it calls for a rotisserie chicken. Thanks Sue!

I just made this tonight, followed the recipe but added a little chicken stock to the roasting pan to help with the chicken gravy I made from the juices. My kids ate it up and said it was the best dinner I've ever made!! Yummy!

I had only one chicken and not a lot of time. (Or at least not the 5-6 hours the recipe specifies.) I upped the temperature to 375 and roasted the chicken uncovered for about an hour and 45 minutes. It came out very juicy and tender - not dry at all. Perfectly cooked. Roasted chicken made at home is very economical and budget-friendly, so I will be including this recipe with our others for roasted chicken.

Super moist, flavorful, and VERY tender!! I did change up a few things, here they are:
I use one 5.36lb chicken.  
I didn't have white pepper, so it was omitted. I used poultry seasoning instead of dried thyme.  Along with the onions in the cavity, I also added 1 Tbs of minced garlic.
I let this chicken marinate for 26 hours.
I cooked it for 6 hours at 250. (Bc it was bigger than the 4 pounders in this recipe)
I did cook it breast-side down for 4-1/2 hours, then flipped it over for the remainder. I did this BC I've read that it lets the juices flow to the breasts, then you flip it and the juices flow to the backside. I don't know, but it worked for me! 
I then kicked it up to 290 for 45 min.
Then I had to go to the field, so the chicken sat untouched in the oven for 2 hours. -It kept it warm!!
It was absolutely amazing!! I personally think it was better than any store-bought rotisserie chicken!!

AMAZING, although how could it be anything but? I cut the recipe in half and only made one chicken and made it in the crock pot. Prepped it the night before, Ziploc'd it, and then dumped the onion in the bottom of the pot, stuck the chicken in. Set it on low all day and 8 hours later it was fall off the bone DELICIOUS... no fuss and needed no liquid. Got rave reviews from everyone!

OMG!!! This was SOOOO delicious! My hubs and I could not get enough of this (there was very little left of our 4 lb. bird...)! Hands down, this is the BEST spice rub I've ever tasted. It has just the right amount of savory and enough kick to make your tastebuds sing! I only made one chicken, but wish I would have made both. :( As many others did, I too prepped my bird in advance (I stuck my seasoned chicken in the fridge the night prior). I also removed my chicken from the oven when my meat thermometer registered 170 degrees (as with any meat, it continues to cook a bit as it sets up - just remember to allow it to rest for 10 minutes or so before slicing). To make the most wonderful gravy EVER, add 1/2 a can of chicken broth mixed with 1/2 T cornstarch to your pan drippings, bring to a boil and stir constantly until thickened (remember, I halved everything). NOTE: If you have a meat thermometer, use it! All ovens cook differently (mine runs hot). My chicken was cooked thru in just under 3 hours. Served with slow-cooker mashed potatoes, creamed spinach and crescent rolls, this was the most FANTASTIC meal I've had in a long while. Thanks SO much for sharing, Sue! :-)

Wanted to roast chicken so I googled for a recipe. Many came up and I read a number. I decided that this sticky roast chicken and another known as "perfect roast chicken" seem best. I married the 2 recipes and I made the best roast chicken for dinner tonight. 

I marinated the chicken as given above. But I wanted lots of veggies. So I added veggies (sweet potatoes, pumpkin, carrots and broccoli) in the last hour of cooking. When done I tented the chicken and swilled the hot veggies in white wine as suggested in the "perfect roast" recipe. Then I reduced the roasting pan juice with the wine drained from the veggies. Added a bit more black pepper. Served with a well chilled Sauvignon Blanc from Marlborough, NZ. Fantastic! Will definitely do it again, and again, and again ...

Let me start out by saying that I hate roast chicken, absolutely hate roast chicken.  I'm 60 years old and have always hated roast chicken.  Did I say I hated roast chicken?  Well, up until I found this recipe.  I have no idea why I even tried it; DH thought I was nuts when I told him we were having roast chicken for dinner.  Between the two of us we consumed almost the entire bird!  It was pathetic, truly pathetic.  This chicken is that good!  It's the spices and the overnight marinade (stress overnight)  that do it!  And the slow roasting doesn't hurt.  I did add a lemon to the cavity of the chicken based on another reviewer's comments, but that was the only change I made to the recipe.  This is so over-the-top good, Sue -- you've turned me into a convert.  Roast Chicken -- mmmmmm!

Omg.  This was hands down the best chicken ever!  I did not have the white pepper, onion powder or thyme but I substituted poultry seasoning and added some celery salt.  I also rinsed out the chicken and let it soak in fresh lemon prior to seasoning. i did pat it dry first, I also made sure some of the spice was under the skin also.  I let it marinate for almost 5hrs.  I also cooked it at 300 degrees and then turned on the broiler at the end to crisp it.  If you haVe never roasted a chicken before look no further for a recipe.  We will definitely make this again!   YUM!!!

Used 6 lb cut up fryer and oven bag. Was delicious! Hubby and son loved it! I let chicken marinate with rub on it for few hr hours and then cooked it. Only took about an hour and fifteen min to bake. Can't wait too try whole chicken on the rotisserie.

Everyone said it was one of the best chicken's they'd had.  My dad couldn't believe I hadn't injected anything because it was so moist and flavorful.  I used all black pepper and used 1 large bird instead of two.  I'm not really sure what the saran-wrapping does but it must work on something because the skin was fantastic.

I started making this recipe about 6 years ago. It is the closest thing to the German chicken we would buy from the "Chicken Man" on base. My whole family LOVES this chicken. It is great for multiple meals. Thanks for a great recipe.

I used this rub IN my rotisserie. I did make some changes. I added ground Sage and Rosemary in place of the Thyme, and upped the amount of Onion Powder.I reduced the amount of Salt since I used only One Chicken. Very good rub. I gave it only 4 stars due to the fact that I changed some of the ingredients. My lady liked the Chicken very much.Good recipe!

We love love love this spice combination. I usually double the garlic and I'll add in about 4 Tbsp of olive oil (2 if I half the recipe) and I cover the chicken with the mixture using a brush over and under the skin. Sometimes I'll add a little fresh garlic and lemon inside the cavity depending how I feel. I usually just cook the chicken right away, and the flavor is still incredible. I also cook mine depending on the size of my chicken and the amount of time I have to prepare it. I've used this spice mixture for grilling chicken breasts and it's delicious!! Very versatile recipe!

Excellent!  I followed the recipe as is and found that my family completely prefers this recipe to store-bought rotisserie chickens.  Very easy, and so versatile... you will soon have your own signature recipe with this one.

I made this the other night in our showtime rotisserie oven. I thought it smelled terrific when it was marinating in the fridge. But let me tell you it has a major kick! I am going to try it again, minus the cayenne pepper altogether. Also I do not think both white and black peppers are needed.

I love the seasoning...doesn't taste exactly like the rotissiere seasoning from our grocery store, but it's close and very tasty! I just used bone-in breasts, so I stuffed onion under the skin and cooked for about 1 hour, 45 minutes to 180. Some of the outer edges were a bit dry, but it was mostly yummy tender moist chicken. I've used it for several different recipes this week and have two seasoned breasts in the freezer to use another week. Definitely a keepr of a recipe.

It's true what every one else has said - this is the best roast chicken recipe ever.  I used to avoid roasting a whole bird as always ended up with dry breast and raw legs.   This turned out perfectly and so tasty.  My husband loved it and I am now so happy I am one of those people who can serve up a delicious chicken roast!

Love the recipe! This is the second attempt making this with slight changes this time.  I cut the salt to 2 tsp, and the cayenne to 1/4 tsp, and added 1 tsp of brown sugar, but followed the rest of ingredients to the letter.  The only other thing I did was at the beginning, half way through, and again about an hour before it came out of the oven I sprayed the chicken with my pump bottle of cooking oil .  People were complaining the skin was dry and not like the store.  At the store the chicken on the rostisserie is spinning around being basted the entire time it cooks in the dripping juices of the chickens above it.  I found spraying the skin kept it moist.  With the changes I made it tasted smoother and more like the one from the store ... not exact but closer.

This turned out wonderful.  I had one 4-lb chicken and just adjusted the cooking time and used a meat thermometer.  I only had about 4 hours to let it marinade and it was still great.  I did find it a wee tad bit too spicy so may cut back on either the white pepper or cayenne next time.  The gravy from the pan drippings (augmented with about 1/2 can chicken broth) was out of this world....I thought my oldest son was going to drink it out of the gravy boat!!  I also used this rub and roasted a cut up chicken to make the "Fast Chicken Soup Base" also on this site and it made a fantastic soup too!!  YUM!!

I roasted a 6-lb chicken and it only took it two hours to bake to 180F.  It was very moist and tasty but I didn't see where it was sticky.  I made exactly as the recipe stated.  Definitely will be making again.

This was so-oo good! Very flavorful, and so moist that the juices came flowing out when I carved it. My picky 13-year old chicken hater wolfed it down and said, "Mom, this is better than the ones you buy in the store. You should make a bunch and sell them!" The greatest part of all? The second one cooked along with the first! Now I don't have to cook tonight! Gotta love that!

I had half a free range bird in the freezer when I saw this recipe. I didn't have onion powder and went a little light on the cayenne since I used hot paprika but otherwise to the letter with the onions in the bag and under the bird for cooking. My wife said this is to be the recipe of choice henceforth

This is a great recipe.  I usually make one chicken instead of two.  I buy a 4 lb. chicken and it takes about 3 1/2 to 4 hours. I use half of the white pepper but follow everything else.  Very good!!

This was a perfect roast chicken, and it was so easy!  I would have liked to follow this recipe exactly, but I was missing a few ingredients...onion powder, cayenne pepper, and onions.  I also didn't have 5 hours, so I increased the heat to 170C (220C for the first 10 minutes to crisp up the skin) and cooked it for almost 2 hours.  I boiled potatoes in chicken broth, and then used 1 cup of the broth and 2 tbs corn starch to make a gravy, which was really, really good.
My husband is slipping into a food coma from eating too much...
I will definitely make this again, and follow the recipe exactly...but it's hard to imagine it will get any better!

This definitely lives up to it's name and was great as the recipe is written. I was able to purchase two chickens from Target no less for the mere price of 5.00. Not only did we get one dinner, but two plus lunches out of the deal. And some excellent soup stock.Now that's stretching your dollar!!

Excellent chicken! I did the High-low temp cooking method and the meat was juicy and moist. I had rubbed it down more than 24 hours ahead of time and wrapped it tightly in plastic wrap. The only fault I can find is the the rub (which makes the meat delicious) made the skin too peppery to eat. Oh well, it's not good for you, but I was so looking forward to it! Try to find a ROASTING chicken instead of a whole fryer.... it makes all the difference.

Like many other reviewers said, this is the best chicken I've ever made.  I followed the recipe exactly and baked it for a little over 4 hours until a meat thermometer read 170 degrees.  The meat was tender, juicy, flavorful, and really easy to carve.  My 2-year old kept asking for more and more and more.  I roasted one chicken and wrapped the second in aluminum foil and stuck it in the freezer for a later date.

My husband said this is the best roasted chicken he has ever had!! I have to say I agree. I will never buy another rotissier chicken from the supermarket again. The only thing I did different was to add chopped garlic to the cavity and under the skin. The ONLY  thing I think I would change would be maybe less salt.

This was so juicy and flavorful!! It was like the grocery store rotisserie chicken but better! I had one 4lb chicken and it cooked in about 2 1/2 hrs, guess my oven cooks hot. Be sure to watch it if yours does too because you dont want to over cook this. It was so so good!

This was very good and smelled incredible while it was baking.  The chicken was super tender, but the skin turned to leather.  Next time I will try it covered for the last hour and see if that helps.

I usually like to try a recipe a few times before I comment on it.  This turned out perfect everytime.  Very little prep time, pop it in the oven and forget it, you can't get much simplier than that.  I have handed out this recipe to many of my family and the comments are all the same YUM!  One note, I found the best results came from letting the chicken sit overnight with the rub on it. It needed a little more than the "minimum 4-6 hours to sit.  Also, a spice blend such as "Italian, Greek etc." in place of the thyme gives it a nice twist as well.  
Thanks for the delicious recipe

This is by far the best chicken I've ever made. It was falling off the bone and so juicy and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, except I only made one chicken and didn't account for it cooking faster. So my chicken cooked in about 3 and a half hours at 250. This was absolutely delicious and next time I will definitely make 2 and use the leftover chicken in another recipe.

Surprisingly it tasted exactly like Sam's Club rotisserie chicken, which we find is the very best.  The meat fell off the bone it was so tender.  The only thing I did differently was cut  the garlic in half as my hubby is in sales and does not want to offend.  My poor dogs started smelling it cooking and were pacing in the kitchen for three hours wondering why I wasn't getting it out of the oven.  From now on this will be the only way I roast a chicken, and as others suggested, I will be making a big batch of the rub.

I didn't change anything except for omitting the white pepper (I never use that) and increasing the garlic powder to 1 tsp. I wrapped tightly in cling wrap and marinated overnight. WOW these were really good! Perfect for company. Oh yes - and basting with the juices halfway through cooking and at the end is a must.

The flavor was minimally okay, the texture of the chicken dry and hard to swallow.  I'm surprised about all the good reviews I read.  My husband thought it was okay because he liked the dark meat this way, but the white meat was no good at all.

Delicious without any changes! You will need a meat thermometer to be sure this bakes correctly. You may be tempted to think it is overcooking because you bake this with the lid off and it looks done. A few degrees matters. It takes a little getting used to baking at such a slow temperature because I kept checking it so much. We loved it! A keeper for sure! Also, I can't eat the skin, but it is seasoned and marinated so well, the meat is full of flavor...

This recipe is simply amazing! I did let mine soak overnight & lightly coated it with EVO before adding spices. I also added fresh rosemary. My house is filled with the amazing aroma!

This was good but certainly not as tasty as the chicken I make on our grill with the rotisserie accessory. To achieve the moistness and flavor of rotisserie chicken you should soak it in a brine made with water, salt and sugar overnight (no longer than 24 hours) before roasting.

Delicious. I followed directions exactly for the spices and used all on 1 5 lb chicken. I put a whole chicken in the crock pot.

This was a great and easy to make recipe. The only thing that I had to do that wasn't mention was to baste the chicken about three times during the roasting to get the golden roasted skin color. The chicken was very moist even the breast portion.

Delicious chicken! Next time I will cut back on the salt by a teaspoon, it was just a teeny bit too salty but otherwise....perfection! My bird was almost 7 pounds and I gave it a bit over 5 hours and it was perfectly cooked. Thanks Sue!

This was really good.  I am going to add some more cayenne next time, I like things a little more spicy.  I also didn't end up using a whole chicken.  Instead I used chicken quarters to cut down on the time.

I decided on this recipe after making another roasted chicken recipe with more than 1 stick of butter! I didn't have any thyme so I subtituted it with dried parsley. The seasoning of the chicken was very similar to rotisserie chicken. However, if you are sensitive to pepper beware! This chicken seasoning has: "CAYENNE, WHITE, and BLACK PEPPER!" So, it was a little to much for me! However, I would like to try the same cooking method, as it was tender, but use more mild seasonings. The texture was good, as the skin was very crispy and the meat was slightly juicy from roasting at such a low temperature. However, I did notice it was not sticky at all, which I thought sounded good, except for at the bottom of the pan. Lining the pan with foil though would more likely help with that.

5+++ stars! This was hands down, the BEST chicken that I have ever made in my short time on this earth lol.  I did add some whole garlic cloves to the cavity of the chicken along with the onions, and I almost doubled the seasonings (because I felt like half of it stuck to my hands haha).  I also sliced some fresh garlic cloves and slid them under the chicken skin (about 3 cloves per chicken).  This tasted just as good, if not better, than the already-made rotisserie chickens you buy at the grocery store.  Mmmmmm :~)

I only gave 3 stars due to it being a little dry. Used organic, local chicken and followed recipe to a t. Was excited by all the reviews that this would WOW me, but didn't.  Didn't really have the rotisserie flavor I was expecting nor the juiciness everybody raves about. So after all that, we carved the chicken for sandwiches. I would try this again if I had a rotisserie for the grill.

This was amazing!!! Followed instructions to a T with the exception of cooking time. I had a 4.3 lb. chicken and 3.5 hours was the perfect amount of time. It came out moist and juicy and the skin was divine. Next time I will add some fresh garlic along with the onion to the inside of the bird, though.  All I had on hand was garlic powder and I do prefer fresh. I served this with slow roasted asparagus (2.5 hours in a foil packet with lemon zest, olive oil, white wine, salt & pepper) and mashed potatoes and we both had seconds. Thanks so much for this no-fail recipe!!! :)

I put the bird in a brine solution for 4 hours, dried it and let it sit overnight in the fridge before adding the spice rub.  Let it sit for another 4 hours before cooking.  Never basted it and it was THE best chicken I have ever eaten.  Husband agreed and sucked the bones clean!  Also added an onion and lemon to the cavity.  AWESOME>  thank you!

If I could give this recipe more stars.... I would.  I put the seasonings together and rubbed all most all of it all over one 5 lb. chicken.  I then cooked it in the slow cooker on low for 6 hours.  Then I put it in the oven for 15-20 minutes at 350 to crisp up the skin.  EXCELLENT!!! The whole family loved it I'm sure I will make this many times.

Little too warm to roast this in the oven all day so I rubbed it down and stuck it to cook in the crockpot all day. I omitted most of the salt, only a pinch, and used one chicken. Instead of stuffing the chicken, I layered the onions at the bottom of the crockpot with a little organic chicken broth. The drippings I plan on saving for soup as well as the chicken. Very flavorful, even cooked in the crockpot. It fell apart and made it great to piece out for soup. Even though I changed the cooking procedure, this worked exactly for what I needed. Thank you.

Made exactly as written and this is a great roasted chicken recipe.  I'm not sure where the "sticky" in the name comes in, but it was very full of flavor and roasted beautifully.  I've never roasted a chicken at such a low temp and I think it is definitely the way to go.  Of course, because it does take 5 hours, it is a good idea to do as the recipe suggests and just make 2.  I have 3 meals and a good batch of stock lined up from these 2 chickens.  Great flavor, great prep, great meal.  The only down side is having to make room in the fridge for the chickens while they sit overnight, but I think the "marinating" is worth the inconvenience.

I followed this recipe to the letter and the results were somewhat disappointing. The flavor of this spice rub was really interesting (I used half the salt) but the chicken was not sticky and the flavoring only made it a little past the skin.  The skin started to dry out so I first basted the chicken with broth, then brushed it with olive oil towards the end . The chicken had good flavor but the spicy part came off when I took off the skin to shred the second chicken. Also, five hours was way too long. The chicken was done at about 4:15, even with me taking it out a few times to mess with it. I left it in a little longer just to be sure, but the breast was still dried out. I would definitely use this recipe again because I liked the spice mix, but the method needs some tweaking to get the ultimate rotisserie-style chicken.

I cooked this chicken without the onion (didn't have one) and in an enameled cast-iron pot because I don't have a roasting pan.  It holds heat really well, and the smell of it cooking in the oven made me so hungry, that I decided to check the internal temperature about an hour early.  It was indeed done a bit early (sometimes my oven runs hot too, so that might have contributed to the early finishing time).  I just had one of the wings (before dinner, bad me) and it was beyond delicious.  It might be the best chicken that's ever come out of my oven.  I will definitely make this again, and soon!  You should too!

Family Favorite - This also works well to prepare ahead and freeze.  Put the whole frozen pre-seasoned chicken in the crockpot and 10 hours later you have a wonderful chicken dinner!

I LOVE this recipe. I only use one chicken, but don't half the spice mixture, so there is plenty of flavor. When I discovered how to make pan gravy from the drippings, this chicken became an all time family favorite! I simply take the drippings from the roasting pan, add 1/4 cup flour and a can of low sodium chicken broth...simmer in a skillet until thickened. Serve the chicken and gravy with mashed potatotes and it's hard to stop eating!

This is the only way I'll roast a chicken from now on!  I made this twice before, using a baking bag since I didn't have 5 hours.  It was very good that way, and my family said they loved it and would like to have it again.  BUT, today I made this according to the recipe, roasting it at 250 degrees for 4 1/5 hours.  It was out of this world delicious!  Thanks for an excellent recipe/method for roasted chicken!

Very good recipe.  I cooked on convection, 225 for 3 1/2 hours.  It very tender and juicy chicken.  I also used a smoked paprika, gave a wonderful smoked flavour to the chicken.

followed the directions to a T, EXCELLENT!   Gave one of the chickens to the neighbors.  They called after dinner to say it was scrumptions and a definite keeper.  My chickens took 5 hours, I basted during the last hour of cooking.

Very tender an moist.  Good flavor too. Omitted thyme because I was out of it.  Only let set with seasoning about 1/2 hour. Instead of 2 4 lb chickens I used 1 7lb roaster. Making it again tonight.

I've made this with and without marinating, cooking to temperature and just cooking the stated five hours, and varying the herbs/spices according to mood, and it comes out wonderful every time.  I can't believe after 35 years of cooking it took me until now to find out how to roast a chicken, but this is definitely HOW.

love love this recipe have made it many times . If you are a rush try doing it in the Microwave using the Pampered Chef Deep Covered Baker. I do it most often like this now and my family loves it and begs for more. It takes only 30 minutes  Great for working Moms and Dads. I do cut the salt by using 1 tsp of Garlic salt

This turned out wonderfully moist and delicious. I had a 4lb bird and it took me 4 1/2 hours. Next time I will put some of the seasoning under the skin since we don't eat that. I will definitely be making this again.

LOVE IT!! Make as is.  I was worried because I am not a pepper fan, and I dont like spicy things. But I made exactly as written and it is awesome! I have made it now many times even with chicken quarters. I only leave in oven for 3 1/2 hours if not using a full chicken.

The absolute best roast chicken I've ever had!!!  I thought that the white and cayanne peppers would be too much, but it was just right!  The spice mixture was perfect!  Will positively make again!

Made this the first time with the chicken and it was great.  The second time I coated a whole pork loin and let sit overnight.  Cooked it on the rotisserie.  Best pork loin I have ever had.  Great recipe.

Made exactly as stated, but only did 1 chicken. Was done in about 3.5 hours, I had to turn it down since the hubby wasnt home from work yet! I quartered some potatoes and boiled them about 20 minutes, then placed them in the roaster for the last hour. When i pulled the chicken out to rest for the 10 minutes I turned oven up to 350 and it carmelized the juices on the potatoes. Fantastic!

Ok, I used a whole bird cut up but the skin was so tough I couldn't even eat it.  It really needs to be basted, that's what a rotisserie chicken is: self basting as it rotates.  I liked the seasoning and letting it sit over night seemed to allow the flavors to get in the chicken but next time I'll just roast it at a normal temp for a normal time.

Simply delicious, hot or cold! I changed one thing only because I had to: I used about half the amount of thyme before I ran out, so I used sage for the other half. Husband, 2-year-old and I all scarfed it down, even the cold leftovers. I will definitely make this again.

Very good... I did cut the recipe in half,except for the garlic powder. I brushed the chicken with butter before rubbing in the spices. It roasted for four and a half hours at 250, and it turned out juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. I made a rice using some of the sauce left on the roasting pan (sauteed 2 shallots with a bit of olive oil. Add rice and a bit of roasted chicken sauce, fry for a bit then add chicken stock, salt and pepper,cook until rice is cooked. It actually turned out very tasty.

FANTASTIC!! I did not prep this ahead of time and it still had plenty of flavor.  I used seasoned salt in place of regular salt and added a little garlic infused olive oil after three hours.  At the end, I switched over to convection  and roasted about 20 minutes at 375 to get a nice golden crispy skin.  This recipe is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!

My two 5 lb. birds were at 185 in a bit more than 4 hours, leading me to question my oven, and I will try again with a thermometer in the oven next time.  The chickens did not fall apart as much as store-bought ones, but the white meat was a little dry, though very tender and with good flavor.  As it stands now, this is not the best roast chicken I've ever had, but I'll try again!  BTW, half the salt was plenty. Edit: I bumped my review from 4 to 5 stars after eating the cold leftovers. Fantastic!

This chicken was delicious. It became so tender that even the bones started to disintegrate! I quadrupled the quantity of spices so I could keep the mix on hand for quick prep.

I made this on Sunday, cut it back to one chicken and followed rub recipe with with the exception of cayenne because I forgot to pick some up.  Stuffed the peeled onion inside as recommended and only had 2 hours to let it sit in fridge.  The onion helped the chicken stay put on the rotisserie rod.  I baked at 250 in a convection oven on a rotisserie rod for about 4 hours with a small pan of chicken broth under it to catch drippings.  BOY WAS IT MOIST & DELICIOS.  I used the broth to boil some red potatoes and they were NUM NUM.  I'll let the chicken marinate longer next time and will add the cayenne.  This was my first rotisserie style chicken and I outdid myself with the help of this recipe.  I didn't find it too salty however I didn't eat the skin.  Everyone can cook if they know about allrecipes.com, love it.

This was really good! I used one 6lb chicken instead of two. I made the entire seasoning mix and a little extra salt. I realize how insane that is, but what can I say. We like salt. I didn't have white pepper or cayenne pepper. I used a little bit of Emril creole seasoning in its place and it was not too spicy like some reviewrs have said. Just very salty (of course!)
I also quartered some yukon golds and carots and roasted them the whole time with the chicken. When I took the chicken out, took it out of the pan and sat it on a cutting board to rest, then I turned the heat on the oven up to 450 and put the veggies back in while the chicken rested (about 15 minutes). It made the drippings boil and the veggies ended up being almost tastier than the chicken.
Oh...I also skipped marinating it over night. I'm sure that would be awesome, but we wanted it now. I added 3 cloves of garlic to the cavity and sprayed the skin with olive oil several times during the cooking.

Even though I did not refrigerate overnight, it was still FABULOUS!!! I baked 1 chicken for about 3hrs, 45 min, until thermometer reached 170 and let it rest. PERFECT!! Love the paprika in this recipe. I will be making this from now on...no more store bought chicken for my family!!!

I used a 6 1/2 lb chicken and roasted it at 250 for 5 hours, basting it the last hour. The skin was a perfect golden brown, and a bit crispy.  The meat was as tender as could be (although the pan drippings made the gravy come out a little too salty).  I will definitely use this recipe again.

AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME. The cooking method for this is great. I had a 6lb roaster and it took a little over 5 hours to cook. (20 of that time was at 350 because i was making brownies at the same time and thats the temp they required). I didnt have time to marinate but it still came out great. I stuffed the cavity with a mixture of onion, mushrooms, and a schallot. Used a roasting pan with a rack.

I made this Chicken tonight with a few variations.  I used smoked Paprika and I added about 3 smashed cloves of garlic to the cavity of each chicken.  I also eliminated the garlic and onion powder, only because I didn't have either on hand.  The Chicken was very moist and very very tasty. Really easy to make as well.  It will definitely be a keeper in our home.

thanks for the recipe.  This is so awesome and so easy.  The only thing I did was substitute sea salt for the regular salt.  I did dip it in the butter pats as someone else suggested and added the chicken broth to the bottom of the pan.  Although they say it makes an awesome gravy, the meat does not need it.  I do cut slits in the meat under the skin so that the flavor gets into the meat I would really recomend that to anyone making this recipe.

Had this for dinner tonight and thought it was great. I used one large roaster chicken, about 7 1/2 pounds. Kept the spice amounts the same except i didn't have any cayenne or white pepper so i added extra of everything else and added in some chili powder and crushed red pepper. Double wrapped in plastic wrap for 24 hours. The chicken was perectly cooked at 250 in about six hours. (i used a chicken with a pop up timer)I'm sure the spices could be altered depending on what you have in your cupboard and what you like. I thought it might dry out without being covered but it came out moist and delicious with crispy skin. I will definately make this again.

Don't get me wrong, this was really good... it's just that I didn't see where marinating it overnight and baking it for 5 hours made it much better than a typical roasted chicken you back at 400 for about an hour.  I liked the seasoning, but nothing stood out to make it different than what I'm used to.  Again... great chicken!  But I guess I was expecting more for the time involved.

I made this with some changes. I don't like any "heat" at all, but love lots of flavor. I left out the cayenne and white pepper, but added about 1 teaspoon dryed rosemary. I put the rosemary in a mortar and pestle with the salt (used alder smoked sea salt)and groud both to a coarse powder. OH MY GOSH was it ever good!!!

I wanted to comment on those who are insisting that your meat reach 180*. If you follow this don't be shocked if your meat is dry! To be sure, I checked out the USDA website and they recommend an internal temp of only 165* F for whole poultry. The meat continues to cook after you pull it out of the oven and 15 degrees can make all the difference in the world! This also holds true for those little pop-up thingies on turkeys which are designed to pop at 180*. Basically, everyone is just trying to cover their you-know-whats by insisting on a higher temp so they can't be liable for someone undercooking the meat. If you trust your oven and have a good meat thermometer, definitely aim for 165* (in the thickest part of the thigh). You can always throw it in for a little longer if you are unsure, but there's no un-cooking it. Hope this helps! *update* I finally got a chance to try the recipe and I really like it.  I had some garlic butter that I really wanted to get rid of so I stuck a few pats under the skin (along with the spices).  The meat was really moist and pleasantly seasoned.

I love this recipe.  I've done it slow for 5 hours and fast at 350 and I prefer it slow cooked.  Sometimes I'll use smoked paprika in the mix and I always double the seasonings.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This wasn't bad but I did not think it tasted much like true rotisserie chicken bought at a market, etc. True rotisserie chicken has that great, mellow roasted taste - not a spicy taste. This wasn't spicy "hot" just overpowering -- it buried that great roast chicken flavor under all the spices. I hoped to use the leftovers for a curry chicken salad the next day but the spices permeated the meat so much I actually went out and bought a rotisserie chicken to use instead. I worried the spices would change the taste of the chicken salad. I don't know that I'll make this again. I'm more a fan of the Barefoot Contessa roast chicken recipe. As for rotisserie chickens, I'll stick to the ones at the market done in a true rotisserie until I find a recipe I like better.

Very tasty chicken, and oh so tender!  The only change I made was to use black pepper for the white (it was all I had).  The chicken was moist and juicy and fell off the bone.  I wished I would have had more juice for gravy, so next time I think I will add some broth to the pan during in the middle of the cooking.

I have made this recipes several times and it always turns out great.  I have let the chicken marinate over night, for only a few hours and not at all - doesn't seem to matter, it is terrific.  Thanks for posting this awesome recipe.

Some day I hope I learn to READ the recipe BEFORE I begin cooking. I didn't see where I had to roast the chicken in a low oven for 5 hrs. - so I didn't. I just roasted at 350 degrees for about an hour and a half (for one chicken) and boy! was that good! Can't wait to try it with the slow roasting method. But the rub was outstanding. Thanks so much for the recipe, Sue.  UPDATE:  I actually prepared this yesterday following the recipe and it was fabulous!  Moist, juicy and very flavorful. The skin was crispy and a little tough over the breast, but we chewed right through it to get all that delicious flavor out of it.  When you've got the time, definitely try this recipe!

Holy Goodness! This chicken came out so moist and delicious. I did the overnight marinade and cooked mine for like 4 hours 10 minutes and that was plenty. I did sprinkle on some of my favorite spices and it was delicious! Don't pass it up.

When I see a recipe on this website with so many wonderful reviews, I MUST try it!  Well, this certainly lived up to the reviews. I had one 7.5 lb roaster. I made the spice mixture as listed (cut down on the salt). I rubbed the spices on and under the skin.  I let it sit in the refrigerator for about 6 hours. I put it in a 250 degree oven. Everyone that said their house smelled great wasnt kidding!  It was ready after 3.5 hours. I let it sit (cause rest of dinner wasnt finished). I really had my doubts until I started to carve it. It was SO juicy and incredibly delicious! My (17 yo) daughter felt it was too spicy, but I loved it!  I made a chicken salad sandwich from the scraps of leftovers for my lunch today. WOW!

So many times recipes call for rubs that end up only flavorful if you get the outside where the rub touched.  This recipe's rub soaked throughout the chicken and was delicious.  I only had to cook the chicken for 4 hours for a 4 lb. bird.  Don't overcook or you'll dry it out...check starting at 4 hours.

To respond to another rater, YES!!!! This seasoning is awesome on turkey. I have done it 2 years in a row now. It is terrific. I never do the step of seasoning the night before, and it is still very flavorful and delicious.

This is the 2nd time I have made this chicken and it always pleases.  It is SO easy and SO tasty.  Oh- and I never rest the chicken with the rub.  I pop it right in the oven- and it is awesome.

Like another reviewer, I first saw this recipe on another website.  I just pulled it out of my recipe drawer.  I printed it off from busycooks dot com on 10/16/1999.  I have made it many times and it is definitely a five-star recipe.

Didn't have any cayenne pepper on hand so I used curry powder (gave it a nice kick). Spread butter under skin & inside to make it even more moist.  Marinated over night. Chicken fell off the bone. Simple & delicious, hubby & 2 yr old loved it! Thanks for submitting!

FABULOUS chicken!  I made it for the second time last night.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was great.  This time I reduced the salt by half.  Also, I was running short on time yesterday so I put half of the spice rub UNDER the skin, marinated only 2 hours, bumped the oven up to 300, and cooked for 2.5 - 3 hours.  It's good enough to stand alone, but if you're a "saucey" person like me use some of the drippings to make a great cream gravy.  Generally, I use about 1/2 cup drippings, just enough flour to absorb drippings, and then add milk a little at a time over med-lo heat until desired consistency and flavor.  And like another reviewer said, pour some of the drippings over the top just before serving for a nice glistening presentation.  The family loved it before, but they thought it was even better this time.

I love love LOVE this recipe! Much cheaper than the store version, and it's my "old standby" when I have guests coming in and don't know exactly when they'll be pulling in. ***I have found that I don't need the full baking time to get the chickens up to temperature, they tend to fall apart on me if I use the full time.*** EASY EASY EASY and impressive!

Cooked it exactly the way the instructions said except I added a few tablespoons of minced garlic in the cavity along with the onion and basted with butter a few times during cooking. It came out amazing, everybody loved it. A+ recipe.

OMG! I made this last night for my father in law's birthday dinner, it was the best chicken that any of us ever had! My 4 yr old son & 6 yr old daughter could'nt get enough!! Wow, this is the oly way I will make roasted chicken again. I had an 8 lb chicken, doubled the seasonings (except the cayenne & salt), put the seasonings in a shaker and rubbed it under the skin as well as over it. I quartered an onion put it in the cavity-meant to add garlic but forgot-Then I wrapped in saran wrap, put in fridge for 4 hrs and then cooked it for 5 at 250. YUMMY!!!!!!!! Today I made soup with the dark meat and bones and the broth is a little on the spicy side.

I am sorry to say that I followed the recipe a T and well, everyone including my husband (who will eat anything) did not like the chicken.  He said this was the first bad recipe I have got from this site.  The white meat a too dry, the flavor was nothing like a rotisserie chicken.

I've made this many times and it is always delicious. I've used it on oven-stuffers and whole wings, as well. The only thing I add is that I soften a little butter and the seasonings to it. Then I loosen the skin around the breast and stuff the butter in there. Absolutely delicious and so moist and flavorful! Tastes just as good (or better) than a restaurant's! LOVE IT!

Very very good - made the whole house smell great.  I ground all the spices in a spice mill to mix them evenly together (using all black pepper and only 1/2 the cayenne).  The kids, who usually complain whenever I use even the smallest amount of cayenne, didn't notice a thing - the long roasting time must have mellowed the "heat", so next time I'll put it all in.  I hate the laborious task of basting, so I schmeared olive oil all over the chickens before sprinkling and rubbing with the seasoning mix (right in the roasting pan) - which made for a messy experience, but it resulted in nice crispy skin - hubby LOVED the flavor!  For presentation at the table, I did pour some of the pan juices over the birds to make them nice and shiny.  I also poured some of the pan juices over cooked white rice - YUM-O!  I only gave 4 stars because cooking time was a bit off in my professional range which is correctly calibrated - I used 5 lb. birds instead of 4 lb. ones, and after 5 1/2 hours their internal temp was 175.  After resting for 10-15 minutes their internal temp had risen to 188 - the white meat was a bit dry, but the pan drippings helped with that.  The dark meat on the other hand (or should I say leg) was fabulous!  I'll use an internal thermometer next time.  I'd also like to try just legs and thighs as one reviewer suggested by roasting at 250 for 3 hrs.

UPDATE to 5 stars.  I made this recipe again using all the cayenne and bone-in skinless thighs.  I added a few cut up onions t

This recipe is wonderful. I've always basted my chickens in the past, and wondered how this would turn out. Well, the skin was crisp and savory, and the meat slid juicily from the bones...delicious!
New additional comment:
I used the spice-rub recipe here for our Thanksgiving turkey and it was really great.

This was delish!  I made one 6lb bird, so I cut the spices back a tad and baked at 275 for 4 1/2 hrs.....perfect! Tender &  juicy!  The whole house smelled great!  The only changes I made were adding a little smoky mesquite seasoning, and brushing with olive oil before popping in the oven. YUM YUM :o)  My 3 year old even had 2nds!  Our new roast chicken recipe!

Not one morsel of this chicken was left for me to even make soup with, which I will say is a first.  We had an unexpected guest, which made us 3 adults, two teens (yes, even my non-meat eating daughter ate some...odd) and a 5 year old.  I have a rotisserie spit for my grill and I thought of pulling it out, but then decided ah, too much trouble so I did it in the oven with awesome results..obviously if I don't have any left.  I added chicken broth (1 cup) and cut potatoes & carrots to the chickens for the last 2 hours of roasting.  Will definately make this again, but will double the spice recipe...make sure you pat the chicken dry before rubbing that on.  Thanks so much Sue!!

Very good chicken.... however, mine came out a little on the dry side, but the flavor was great. I mixed up extra spices so I think I'll use them on the beer butt chicken recipe from this site. That recipe produces an incredibly moist, flavorful bird.

I didn't decide on this until it was too late to refrigerate it for long, so it only got about an hour with the rub on it.  Started baking it at 250F, then realized we'd be eating too late, so inched it up to 275F, then 300F.  It was in the oven for about 4.5 hours.  I also basted it for about the last hour.  There were lots of juices and meat fell off the bone and had nice flavor.  Would've been nice if I'd placed it in the baking pan breast side up, but didn't affect it badly. :-)

This was absolutely wonderful! I added a half of a lemon to one chicken in addition to the onion before letting it stand in the frige over night. I cooked it breast side down for 2.5 hours and then flipped it breast side up for the remaining time.  It was incredibly juicy! I also turned the broiler on for the last 10 minutes to make the skin crispier. Served with mashed potatoes and gravy, the gravy was awesome! YUMMY!

I now make chicken this way regularly!  Some tips:  popping the chick under the broiler for the last 15-20 minutes will make the skin wonderfully crispy.  Also, I often make this with NO seasonings!  And it's still terrific.  Also, you can use this same technique for leg quarters or thighs.  (But not breast pieces; those turn out too dry.)  BTW, even my FIL, who isn't lavish with praise, complemented me on this chicken!

This was great!  I loved the flavor of the spices.  I thought it was wierd to have no liquid in the recipe so I added about 1/2 cup of white wine to the baking dish and baste the chicken about ever 45 mins.  It was very tender and tasty :)

I have made my version of this for years, and it's delicious.  I stuff the cavity with 1/2 lemon and 1/2 bulb of garlic.  Also, if you really want to be decadent, brush the chicken with melted butter for crispy skin!

I also chop up onion, red potatoes, and fennel and roast the whole time in the bottom of the pan--just plop the bird on top of them.  Like the juices, they also caramelize as they cook. Easy, delicious, and impressive enough for company. Not to mention it makes the house smell wonderful!

I roasted 1 whole 7lb chicken with all ingredients listed, plus 3 garlic gloves, 1 lemon and a handful of fresh parsely stuffed in the cavity. I roasted at 500 degrees for 45 min, breast side down and then turning chicken over halfway through on a roasting pan with a rack, then I lowered the temp down to 250 and continued roasting for 3 hours, basting it once with broth. It was so delicious! I look forward to making it again.

I found this recipe to try with my new rotisserie.  It came out wonderful.  I only had time to marinate it for 2 hours and it tastes great.  Next time I will do it the night before and I am sure it will be better.  The recipe makes enough for two chickens, but I only had one.  I took out part of the rub mixed it with a little oil and poured it over cut up potatoes and roasted them.

I had an 8 pound chicken instead of the 2-4 pounders. I didn't have onion powder, so used dried chives. Also I thought the 4 teaspoons of salt seemed like alot, so cut it back to 3 teaspoons. I rubbed some of the dry mix under the skin as well on the top and also sprinkled some on the inside before putting the onions in. I didn't realize it was supposed to be marinated for some time, but it still turned out moist, tender and flavorful. Everyone raved at how good it was. Thanks Sue for sharing this with us :o)

Didn't have time to marinate at all, but it still tasted great!  I used up all the seasoning mix on one chicken, and cooked for 4 hours, per others' recommendations.  Took off as much fat as I could from the drippings, added 1 cup of chicken broth, whisked, brought just to a boil over med. high heat, whisked in a TB of butter, and finally, poured through a sieve for a great gravy.  Ohhhh yummmmm!  Should have used no salt added broth, but otherwise, a perfect complement to a perfect recipe.  My husband was uncomfortable afterwards b/c he ate so much.  Thanks again for a great Sunday dinner you can make on the cheap!

I scaled this recipe to 4 servings so it would use 1 chicken. I prepared the recipe as stated. After marinating in the refrigerator overnight, I put it in the Crock Pot with no water and cooked it on low for 8 hours. It is delicious. It is more like an oven roasted chicken than a rotisserie chicken though, but so easy and so delicious!

I made this over the weekend and everyone really liked it.  I did play around with the spices a bit to suit my family's taste.  I also increased the oven temperature to 275 degrees.  I was glad I did, because my chickens had just reached 180 degrees internal temperature at the end of 5 1/2 hours of cooking.  The one change I would make to this recipe is to add a small amount of brown sugar to the rub.  That would give the skin the "stickiness" that the recipe implies.

Living in Mexico - the "pollo" capital - it takes a very special roasted chicken to impress my husband.  Roasted chickens are sold on every corner of our town and they are delicious!  This recipe  makes that "very special" roasted chicken!  Even my ultra-picky son-in-law raves about this recipe.  I make 3 or 4 chickens at a time and freeze the left-overs for multiple uses.  Thank you for such an awesome chicken recipe!

This recipe was as great as everyone said it was -- and so simple!  I made a single chicken that was just a hair under 6 pounds.  I used my convection oven to roast it at 250 degrees, and it took about 2 hours and 45 minutes.  It rested for about 40 minutes or so.  It literally was falling off of the bones.  My only problem is that I'm lousy at carving so it wasn't as beautiful on the serving plate, but my husband didn't care.  He raved about the chicken and said I have to make it again.  I totally forgot to season the cavity with the spice mixture (I was tired when I remembered to rub it down and get it marinating the night before), but I did put two small quartered onions and about 4 or 5 peeled garlic cloves inside.  The flavor from the veggies and the spices really went throughout the meat.  This is the best roasted chicken I've ever made.  Next time I think I'm going to try it on my rotisserie.  It may even go onto next year's Thanksgiving turkey.  My ONLY complaint (and it's a small one) is that it seemed a tad bit salty.  I may cut back on that just a bit next time.  Otherwise it was PERFECT, and we both loved it!

The only problem I had with this recipe is that I couldn't remember to take the chicken from the freezer the day before.  It was awesome!!!  Don't remember when I had to prepare 2 chickens for 4 people.  But there were very few leftovers and they were gone before the next day!

Great recipe.  I did brush it once with peanut oil sometime in the last 2 hours.  It was so tender and delicious, I didn't think that you could make rotisserie chicken in the oven.  I would prefer it a littler saltier.

This chicken was FABULOUS!! I stuffed each chiken with 1 onion and 2 cloves of garlic.  I also raised the cooking temp to 350 for the last 12 hour for crispy skin.  My fiance LOVED it!!

Wow this turned out superbly!  I only let it sit in the fridge for about 4 hours before I started cooking it.  Soon enough tho the chicken's aroma was drifting through the house and our mouth's were watering.  The meat was delicious and literally fell off of the bone.  This will be the ONLY recipe I use for cooking whole chicken in the future.

Delicious! The meat, even the breast, was juicy and tender; the skin crispy, the exact results I wanted. I cooked it in a broiler pan over the rack, so I didn't bother to baste at all. The only drawback is that it needs to be planned in advance: thaw the chicken in time to let it marinate in the spice rub for 5 hours and another 5 hours for cooking. I'll definitely be making this again and play around with other seasonings. Thanks Sue.

My husband and two small children loved this recipe. 

I enclosed my birds in foil instead of cooking them open - to ensure that they stayed tender as I saw most of the complaints said it was too dry. My birds were not at all dry. 

 I also let my chickens marinade for 36 hours instead of the directed 6.

After marinading them I added a whole garlic bulb between the two birds and stuffed inside with the onion before cooking.

I cooked at 250 for 2 1/2 hours and raised it to 300 for a hour and a half.

I made the seasoning mix as written except for omitting the cayenne. I rubbed it on a bone-in turkey breast just before I grilled it. Excellent!

Okay, so the flavor may not be as good as a store bought rotisserie chicken; HOWEVER it is so moist and it's hard to find a recipe for moist chicken.  Definitely a keeper.  The cooking method is a winner.  Sue, thanks for sharing!!

Follow up:   I now use the spice rub as my "go-to rub".  We love the combination.  Used is on prime rib recipe and it sent the recipe over the top.

This was awesome! I used 1/2 the paprika, and 1/2 the pepper because my family is picky about hot stuff. I did add more garlic powder and some minced garlic to the cavity with the onions. It was so good, it just fell off the bone. I plan to use the leftovers in chicken soup. Thanks for submitting this I'm planning to make a jar up as another reviewer suggested so that I always have it on hand.

This was by far the best whole Chicken I have ever made.  We had one the same night and the other the next night for Enchiladas.  Then the carcasses for soup stock to have on hand for soup at a later date.  Will be a staple recipe for me!!!

In general this was a good recipe. It was very tender and juicy. I followed the recipe exactly. I was worried that it was going to dry out in the oven but it didn't. I didn't care for the seasoning though, to me this did not taste like a store bought rotisserie chicken. I feel like that store chicken's don't have as much Thyme or any at all. I used 1 4.5 lb chicken and cooked it for 5 hours. I think next time I will use a different seasoning but cook it this same way.

I totally loved this recipe. I normally make a recipe as is but when talking to other peeps in the Buzz, I took a different stance on the out come of my birdie. I only used 1 chicken but used the whole seasoning part in this recipe to coat the inside and out before proceeding to the cooking process. Then popped this bad boy into my Novopro Oven featuring the rotisserie feature and away I went. It turned out so well and we LOVED it.

I made a mirepoix and pulsed it course for the cavity. Cleaned and stuffed the chicken and dried it. Took a quarter cup of fancy premade chicken rub and put into a gallon ziplock and coated the bird. 20 hours later put on a rack loosely tented at 250F for 2 hours in a casserole dish. Removed the tent and check the internal temp. Removed the foil and finished it off at 350. Removed the mirepoix and served. The leftovers got picked off the carcass and went into a Stove Top stuffing and chicken gravy mush for lunches. They baggie up and freeze nicely and thaw during the day to be microwaved at work.

this is so easy and delicious. I just put a cut onion and garlic in the cavity. Pre make the seasons so I can douse it when ready. I will never buy an over roasted chicken from the store again. You don't have to let it set overnight but it helps.

I've tried several recipe's from this site and this is the 1st that I've rated! If I could give this 5000 stars I would!  Made this yesterday for Thanksgiving and it was TENDER, FLAVORFUL and downright DELICIOUS!!!

I did tweek the recipe a bit by adding lemon pepper, & doubling the pepper portions (we like a little kick).  I also took approx 2 tbsp's of yogurt butter and 2 tbsp's of honey butter (honey butter was an accident) and mixed with some of the spice mix and put under the skin of both chickens before rubbing spice mix as recommended in the recipe. Everything else I did as the recipe instructed.  It was OFF THE CHAIN!!!! Honey and I Loved it and I will CERTAINLY be cooking this again in the future!

The seasoning blend is perfection! I stuffed my 5lb chicken with onion, made sure to season under the skin. Then cooked for 4 hrs. Juicy and delicious.

I had a whole chicken in my deep freezer and decided this morning I should make it in my rotisserie. I needed a rub though and found this recipe. I made it as written with the exception of the white pepper. I did not have any so I omitted it. My family loved the chicken and this will be my go to recipe.

Oh my goodness this was so good!  I made it exactly as the recipe states and the chicken was so moist and flavourful with the skin having a nice bit of crispness.  I only cooked one chicken so I only used half of the rub and saved the other half for the next chicken.  This recipe is now a regular in my house.

Very moist chicken, although I did't find it to be sticky.  I definitely like the idea of slow roasting it.  It made an easy and satisfying meal.  Next time, I might tweak the spices a little to suit our personal preferences.

Use this all the time for a while roasted chicken. You don’t need all that salt, though! I only do one teaspoon.

Flavorful and moist. Used the same amounts of spices for one 7 pound oven roaster. Took about 6 hours, but well worth the wait. I think the secret is the sealing in of the spicy rub overnight. We'll definitely have this again!

I thawed the chicken then forgot to get the spices on over night. So in the morning I rubbed them on at 9:30am and started cooking at 2:30pm at 300 degrees instead of 250.  The smell of it cooking was heavenly. I took it out at 6pm and it was perfectly at 170 degrees internal temp.  The skin was crispy and the inside was moist and tender.  My family of 7 loved it, each and every one! This is a keeper!

This recipe sounds wonderful and has so many fantastic reviews.  I do have a question and would like to know if this could possibly be done with just chicken breasts?  No one in my family will eat the dark meat.  I thought perhaps just do "bone in breasts" with the spices and put onions and garlic in the bag while marinating.  Then slow cook the breasts in the oven as the recipe states to do with the whole chicken.  If anyone has tried this or has any ideas on cooking the breasts, please advise.  Thank you for your help.

We loved the spices in this recipe. We have been trying various spice combos and haven't found them to be near as tasty. The only changes I made were to eliminate the white pepper (didn't have it and didn't miss it). I halved the amounts since I only made 1 chicken. I forgot to start the night before, so it only got a couple of hours seasoned in the fridge. I cooked it breast side done with carrots, celery and new potatoes for 3 hrs - it turned out great! Even my picky eater 7yo ate a leg and asked for more!! (Let me tell you that alone says volumes about this recipe!!!) We will definitely make it again.

This chicken was FANTASTIC!! Well worth the wait! My only changes were to use one large (7-8lb) roasting chicken and I put spice rub under skin. The chicken came out so tender it fell off the bones and it so much flavor.  I will be using the left-over chicken in a dinner salad tomorrow. Great for sandwiches too!  Thank you, Sue, for a GREAT chicken recipe!

Absolutely delicious recipe. Would have been 5 stars but i followed the instructions (and checked oven temp) and the chicken was DONE 1 hr prior to guests arriving for supper.  I wrapped them in foil and towels to hold the temperature but stop the cooking and it was still perfect. Thank you for the recipe!

This is a great recipe, and my first attempt at rotisserie chicken. It turned out nicely browned and super moist. The only issue I had was that it was too salty. Those of you who want to try this, cut back on the salt. Perhaps 1 teaspoon as opposed to 4 teaspoons.  ENJOY :)

I've never made this chicken, as written.  I have used the combination of spices and it's PERFECT!  I'm not sure why I haven't reviewed before now, as I've been using this for a couple years now.  I mix up these ingredients (times 20) and keep in an airtight container.  This is the ONLY mix of spices I use on my chicken, turkey & fish!  One day I'll try the total recipe, but I'm giving 5 stars just based on the combination of spices.  Thanks.

This is the perfect roast chicken recipe! I basted it several times while roasting. My family loved it! The leftover bones can be used to make wonderful chicken stock, just simmer them along with some carrots, celery, onions, and garlic in a stock pot of water for several hours.

Without question, the best roast chicken I have ever made.  Do not rush the dry brine step (I rushed and cooked the chicken right away the first two times I made this, but when I finally did leave in the rub the recommended time, the result was spectacular.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Fantastic!  Made this for dinner tonight and received rave reviews from the entire family!  This will now be a staple recipe in our home.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the white pepper (my local grocery store did not carry it).

Delicious! Made as written, but with chicken parts because that was what I had and it still worked. Makes delicious chicken salad with the leftovers the next day!

This recipe is fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly except I included a couple cloves of garlic, chopped, in the cavity and excluded white pepper. I'll start making this weekly. Plus, it makes some great leftovers!

This is such a great recipe!  We love it, and I have made it several times since I first spotted it here.  I think MomSavedByGrace said it all very well, so I won’t be redundant.  I definitely wanted to rate this recipe though, and suggest you give it a try.  You will be so glad to have this one in your rotation.  Makes delicious chicken for sandwiches, wraps, burritos and casseroles too.

A similar way y to use 2 branch of fresh thyme, half lemon and a full head of garlic chopped in half, inside the cavity, every half hour you spray with white wine and the result is delicious aromatic rotisserie style chicken. Mmmm yummy!

This was not my favorite roast chicken.  I thought the recipe had too much pepper and  it overpowered the rest of the spices.  The skin was not sticky or crispy.  The chicken was super moist but I did not like the flavor.  Will not be making this again.

Good recipe. Like others, I found it too spicy & so did my boys, but my husband liked it a lot. It crisped up nicely, despite not wrapping it & leaving in the refrigerator for a while-- though next time I will do that because it will be even better. I also used only one bird, though I like the idea of cooking once and having two main dishes. I made this with saffron rice and broccoli. I did add butter to the top & spray with a butter spray toward the end if cooking because the spices were not getting "sticky". This step helped, and I'm certain I wouldn't have needed to had I refrigerated it. Very nice & easy "set it and forget it" recipe.

The spice mix was delicious smelling, and made a flavorful skin. However, there was no "stickiness", the skin was very dry, and tough. I will try this spice mix again in the future with a different cooking time/temp to see if it improves the results.

I typically read all the reviews and don't leave them but this recipe deserves a wonderful review. I have roasted chicken for years and was tired of the same old thing. I have made this chicken in the oven,in the crockpot and in my rotisserie, it is fantastic any way you cook it. The taste is wonderful, I have never had more tender, moist chicken and this ev even beats the peruvian rotisserie chicken I could live on from a local restaurant. Easily 5 stars!

So far I've made this three times this month! An easy way to make delicious chicken for multiple meals at a very low cost. I followed the recipe exactly and made two chickens each time for easy leftovers. It is truly fix and forget! Once done, I cut the remaining chicken in half with shears. Bones are easy to remove since the chicken is well done. The meat is really, really moist. I have rewarmed in the oven, wrapped in foil. I have also zapped in the microwave for several minutes on medium to warm up. Both work well. The same fresh rotisserie flavor remains. Pieces can be used in chicken salad. Tonight I'm using breast meat with a side of pasta. It's all good! The spice mixture is PERFECT. I made a large amount of that and now keep it handy in a rubbermaid container in the spice cupboard.  If you like wings, you won't believe how scrumptious they are with this recipe. Thanks for a winner!

Made as directed. White meat was dry, dark was better, and it wasn't "sticky" as described. Flavors were not bad, but could have used more. There was a lot of juice in the bag before cooking. What I believe happens is that the salt pulls the juices out of the chicken. Given enough time, the chicken should reabsorb that (plus the seasonings) and make for a very moist bird (I've done this on turkey), but overnight standing just doesn't give it enough time.

I was trying to update my original review, but wasn't able to.  Anyways, I was reading some of the comments where people said the seasoning didn't penetrate through the skin. I put the seasoning on the skin, under the skin and in the cavity, using the entire amount of seasoning on one bird. I did cut the salt in half and I'm glad I did.  This was an amazing recipe & I'm so glad I tried it!

The seasoning on the chicken itself was not very special, but the slow cooking made for an amazing moist and fall apart chicken. I didn't realize that chicken that tastes like what I get from the deli could be made at home with out special equipment. I was very pleased with this recipe, as was my family.

This is an awesome recipe! I never refrigerate before-hand and still turns out amazing. If I don't have 5 hours, I usually up the temperature to 300-325 and cook for 3 or so hours.  Delicious!

This chicken literally falls apart when you take it out! It's even good if you don't prepare it the day before or cook it for 3.5 hours in a convection oven.

This chicken is super tasty and so moist. I doubled the spices and rolled pats of butter in it prior to placing them under the skin for extra flavor as another reviewer suggested. I  stuffed the cavity with 2 cloves of garlic and half an onion and then roasted at 425 for 20 minutes and lowered to 300 for a total of 3 hours basting it every 20 minutes My boyfriend and I both love this, and I will definitely be making this again soon.

I used this recipe for my first adventure in baking a whole chicken.  It was super tasty!  
This makes up for all the bland baked chicken I had to eat growing up.

I figured we were on to something good when you see the number of total comments on this recipe but the outcome surpassed even our high hopes. Succulent, tender and flavorful cover the bases to describe this dish. We kept looking in the oven's window wondering if the chicken was going to cook or would we be ordering take out.  It was perfect. We made the rub just as detailed but now that we see how it works we could create varied rubs depending on taste. My only recommendation would be to know your oven's true temperature. Five or 10 degrees either way, especially too low, could make or break this recipe. Check ours once or twice a year and it makes a big difference with baking or slow cooking. Enjoy!

This was chicken was great.  Easy to make, I didn't have time to let it sit with the spices on it, because I found the recipe last minute, but it still turned out great.  My kids loved it, they devoured it (which, if you knew my kids is something).  I can't wait to try it again, letting it sit in the rub overnight.

This was amazing!!! I had to add some butter on the chicken about half way though as it was drying out a bit. Then I basted it off and on the last half of the cook time. IT WAS AMAZING!!! MY whole family loved it!

Pretty good. I had only a small 2.5 pound chicken so I halved the spice/onion ingredients, and halved the salt again. Had to make some spice substitutions for what I had on hand but tried to stay close in taste: used red chili powder instead of paprika. Instead of onion powder, thyme, white pepper and cayenne, used Mrs Dash (orig) spice blend-has much of that stuff in it. Rubbed spice mix under breast skin & all on outside, onion inside. Marinated overnight in fridge. Roasted at 250F with oven probe thermometer in thigh. When thigh temp was 170F, checked temp inside lower breast, in middle of chicken and it was barely 140F. Chicken looked really dry and there were no juices in the pan at this point. Turned up heat to 350 and put back in oven until breast was 165-170. As heat went up, juices started bubbling out into the pan. I probably ended up overcooking the chicken (esp. legs) a bit, but it was still tender and moist, and as I cut it I dipped some of the white meat into the pan juices before serving so it really had that rotisserie taste, no gravy needed that way.  I removed the skin before serving. The skin was just dried and unappealing, not crispy/moist, but it did a good job keeping the meat moist while cooking. Next time I'd rub olive oil on the outside of the skin before cooking, to make it edible. The meat itself though was quite delicious and my DH declared it a success and even went back for seconds (unusual for him when it comes to baked or roasted chicken).

I used this rub on pork chops that I cooked on the BBQ and they turned out fantastic.  The only things I changed were I didn't add the black and white pepper as the cayenne made it spicy enough for the kids, I cut the salt down to 1 tsp and I increased the garlic powder to 1 tsp.  Next time I will try it on chicken.  Thanks!

Excellent recipe. I cooked mine in 1 hour and still turned out great. Marinated in rub for 2 hours. Baked at 400 degrees  Sprayed pan and tin foil wiith Pam cooking spray to avoid chicken from sticking. Placed chicken in pan and covered with tin foil for 30 mins. Removed from oven to baste then put back in oven for 15 more minutes. Finally I removed foil and basted chicken again.  broiled until skin was crispy on high or put on BBQ for a char broiled taste. Yummy!

This was simply amazing.  I made the rub as directed.  I actually made a really large batch of it to keep on hand.  I only did one chicken, I stuffed it with an onion and garlic, and coated it all over with the rub, then tied it up so the legs and wings were tight.  Then I wrapped it tightly in saran and put it in the fridge for 5 hours.
Here's where I varied from the recipe, I actually cooked it on the rotisserie.  I maintained a heat of 325 on the bbq and cooked it for 2.5 hours.  It was perfect, flavourful and juicy.  Best Rotisserie chicken ever!

The recipe was very good, but the spice rub sounded awfully familiar. Over at Food Network I check the recipe for Essence powder by Emeril. Other than the fact that he adds some oregano to the mix, they're essentially the same. Because I had that on hand (I make it up in large batches) that's what I used, and it came out very good. Only 4 stars because of lack of originality

The best tasting baked chicken so far! I did refrigerate for 20 hours before cooking.   I placed reynolds no stick foil in my pan and placed the chicken breast side down for half of the cooking time. Mine only took 4hrs.  Yummm!    Made it again on 2-7-2016.  Used a lot of fresh oregano tied and placed into the cavity along with an onion and garlic.  Did not have time to marinate overnight but that made no difference.  Followed the spices to a T  and it was awesome.

Mouth watering delicious!!! This is definitely a keeper!!!  I only made one change ... I used only a 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper...we like just a tiny bit of heat and this was great!! I also made gravy from the drippings to put over rice....my whole family kept going on about how juicy the chicken was and how great the gravy tasted...thank you for sharing a fantastic recipe!!!!

This was pretty good but not amazing. I suggest taking the chicken out of the oven when the temperature reaches 165 rather than 180 degrees. I took mine out at 165 and it was good but more cooking would have been a mistake. I didn't get the wow factor some people seemed to have with this but I would make it again. I think adding 1 tbs of brown sugar to the rub could help.

Perfect!!  Only roast chicken I will make now!  We cook it often following the recipe exactly.  Can't say enough about this chicken!  It comes out super moist, full of flavor!!  You will LOVE it!
Edit:  I now keep the spice bottled and use it on chicken breast and cook on stove top.  Very versatile.  
Also, if you are like me, the peppers may scare you but they are perfectly balanced.

Absolutely delish! I marinated overnight and left out the onion powder. It was great. I cooked it at 275 degrees for 3 hours and 250 for 1.5 hours. It came out juicy and fall off the bone tender. I served it with gravy- used easy turkey gravy reciepe from this website. I have been using the left overs for salads ever since!

Awesome, amazing, YUM!  I took this one step further by separating the skin from the meat (especially on the breasts) and rubbed the mixture directly on the meat. I allow it to "marinate" overnight in the fridge and cook it the next day. It is AMAZINGLY flavorful!!!!

I gave this recipe only 3 stars because although the chicken did come out nice and moist the skin was very tough.  Also, since this recipe is called Sticky Chicken Rotisserie Style I expected it to have the taste, appearnace and stickiness of a rotisserie chicken and it did not.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.

This was not bad. My daughter loved it and requested the recipe after she moved in with her friends. I rubbed the seasoning on cut up chicken after I gave the chicken a thin coating of olive oil, baked it until it was done. Tasted fine my daughter only left me one piece, so she really liked it.

This spice mixture is unbelievable and RIGHT ON!! My husband and I will NEVER buy a rotisserie chicken again.  We mixed up a batch and put it in our spice bottle so we have it readily available. We lift the skin - spread it under the skin - then also cover the skin of the chicken - before letting it sit overnight (if possible).  Best darn chicken EVER!!!

I LOVED the spices used in this recipe!  It actually sat in my refridgerator for a couple of days before I got around to cooking it.  I cooked it at 350 for 3 1/2 hours & it came out tender & juicy!  Will definitely use again!

Very Easy, no brainer!  This tasted so good!!!  The only issue I had was that it was a tad bit salty!  I'll add less salt next time.  I love rotisserie style chicken.  I'm so happy to find this recipe.  I'll be making this A LOT!!!!

I can only say.... Big Deal.  This is NOT the best chicken ever.  At most it's mediocre.  Why is it called sticky? Not enough seasoning.  Bland.  To quote another review I found buried on this list....

"Honestly, I have NO clue what all the fuss is about? These chickens were okay but surely nothing to rave about. They were moist but the flavoring wasn't doing it for us. Rotisserie chicken it isn't. It has an odd taste. I cooked two 5 lb chickens and had to double the seasoning to cover both of them. I can make a better roast chicken in 1/2 the time, that comes out just as moist and tastier. I also don't get the "sticky" part?"

My husband hates baked whole chicken. I tried making this one because of the awesome review and he loved it! He especially like the spice. It is way better then store bought rotisserie chicken hands down. My young kids love it too and she rarely eat meat but if i make this chicken she'll eat a whole drumstick! I followed the recipe exactly but added tablespoon of butter on the chicken every hour of the cooking process. :) It is delicious.

Really good. I used the huge zip lock bags and it held the chicken and marinade without leaking.

This was ok.  THe chicken came out tender but the taste was pretty bland.  I let it sit over night too.  I will make it again but use my own seasoning.  I also kept it covered because I was afraid it would dry out.

Very yummy chicken. Followed directions exactly except used 1 7lb. bird not 2 small ones. Let mine set overnight in fridge. Slow roasted 4 hours and 45 minutes, took it out just shy of 5 hours because the timer had popped up and didn't want to overcook it. Let it rest 20-25 min while I made gravy and brown rice as well as the "Broccoli in Roast Chicken Drippings" recipe from allrecipes, made for an AMAZING chicken dinner! YUM!

I used this amount of seasoning for one 6 lbs. chicken.    Left out white pepper and did not put any of the rub inside. After 3 hours at 250 I did increase temperature to 350 to make sure it was done on time and the chicken was cooked in another 30 minutes. This was easy to prepare and had a very nice flavor.  My husband hates thyme but he liked it in this mixture.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I loved this! I could only use it as a rub (no time to put in the fridge) but it was fantastic. 

Best roast chicken I've made yet.

Everyone loves it here, my daughter even requested it for her "birthday supper"! I realized the majority of the spices were the ingredients for cajun spice mix so I used that, instead, and just added thyme to it. Like other reviewers, I also placed an onion in the chicken.  Fantastic!

I made this for the first time on Thanksgiving - for just my husband and I, so I halved the recipe.  We both loved it and couldn't stop talking about how awesome it was!  Neither of us like turkey, and he is more of a beef-eater, so even he was surprised at how much he liked this chicken.  Minor changes - didn't use white pepper and added a few cloves of garlic in with the onion.  Then used the leftovers to make Chicken Tortilla Soup I from this site.  I will make this again for any occasion!

This chicken recipe is awesome,  I'm so glad I tried it. Everytime I make these chickens they come out so good  and everyone raves about them. The only thing I do different, is I put the chickens on a flat rack inside a large roasting pan and I pour 2 cans of beer into the pan (any type of beer works well). The beer makes such a great jus which you can use as is or make into a gravy. Also, I turn the heat up to 375 during the last hour of cooking so that the fat renders out of the skin and it becomes crispy and a bit charred, which I like....EXCELLENT!

This was AWESOME! my family devoured one whole chicken and I have plans for the other this week. Great way to cook one day and eat for more. I did take out the cayenne pepper(due to family preference) and only did 1/2 tsp of black pepper instead of white again our preference. Plus I put 3 cloves garlic in the chicken with the onion. It was great. Very moist and tasty.

I am so disappointed with this recipe, I followed directions exactly to the letter except my birds were 5lbs each.  After 3 hours of cooking they looked done. I took them out at checked temp.  180 in center, way over done and dry, dry, dry.

Made this tonight and it turned out perfect. I bumped up the temp the last hour to 275 because I wanted to eat earlier. It didn't hurt a thing and was very moist. My new roasted chicken fav!

Delicious!  I used a 6lb whole chicken.  I followed the recipe, only cutting back a bit on the salt and increasing the garlic and onion powder.  Also rubbed the chicken down with butter prior to rubbing in the seasoning.  I cooked it for 15 minutes at 375 and then for 4 hours at 250.  It turned out beautifully!  Drippings made an excellent gravy, and the meat was ridiculously moist!   Now, I have leftovers for chicken pot pie and I plan to use the carcass for stock!  Thank you!

Amaze your friends and family with this "sure-thing" rub.  Seriously, I use this for so many other recipes: oven roasted whole chicken, grilled beer-up-the-rear chicken, baked chicken thighs later used for chicken and dumplings, hamburger seasoning, etc...
The recipe is a tad heavy on the salt, so we cut the recommended amount back a tiny bit.
Try it, you'll like it!

This chicken was awesome. I love that I was able to put it in the oven and not worry about it. The seasonings were perfect and my family agreed that it tasted like rotisserie chicken. This is a definate keeper. Thanks for the recipe Sue.

I brined the chicken first so I skipped the step to to marinate the chicken in the fridge overnight. I followed the rest of the recipe but I think I left the chicken in the oven a little too long. It wasn't that juicy or tender. I did bask the chicken with butter. I will try this recipe again and update.

Absolutely wonderful. Didn't have the garlic or onion powder so I minced up fresh and rubbed it on with the spices. The meat was so flavorful and tender, I couldn't believe it. And the carcass made a wonderful stock. Will make this again and again.

Too spicy for our tastes as written.  I did the rub overnight and baked the next day.  It was also not as tender as I had hoped.

So juicy! Made as written except for the spices. Since I didn't have some of them, I subbed cajun seasoning. It took a little longer than 5 hours at 250, so I kicked it up to 300 to finish. I made awesome gravy from the drippings, and I never make good gravy.

Have used this recipe for years.  Great way to prepare a bird that will get additional uses, and the drippings make a great stock or gravy.  Chicken is fall off the bone tender.

Spectacular recipe. I used 1/2 the salt and everything else exactly the same as recipe calls for.....PERFECT. I doubled the recipe for a 6.5 lb roasting chicken. I dried the chicken and rubbed olive oil over it so the spices would stick. What a wonderful combination of spices. It is so nice to have a new recipe that doesn't taste like all the rest. BEAUTIFUL. WHAT FLAVOR ! ! ! ! ! ! Thank you Sue.

Am I missing something?  This wasn't sticky at all as the title suggests.  It was ok, the rub wasn't anything special.  You have to check the cooking time, mine was ready was before 5 hours, so, keep an eye on that.  The chicken was OK, but, the outside was dry, and the skin was crispy, but, nothing to write home about.  I don't get what all the fuss is about.

This is a very tasty chicken!! I had a 5lb chicken that cooked in 3.5 hrs though..  a little faster than I was anticipating. Still yummy though. Also cut the salt in half. I made one batch of the spice and had to throw it away because it was way too salty.

This recipe is fantastic! I used to boil my chickens when I wanted chicken for salad or other recipes, but now this is the way to go. It's so easy and the flavor is phenomenal! Then I've got a main meal prepared for that day and only have to de-bone the birds! I didn't have time to refrigerate overnight, just get them in the oven in time for dinner and it was still just a flavorful! A few things different that I do: I add more garlic powder, at least 1 tsp, used dried minced onion instead of powdered, and again, more of that, and used crushed dried thyme, not powder. I forgot to put onions inside the second time I made it, and there really wasn't much difference, so don't do that anymore. And a special thing I always do when making whole poultry (turkey too!) is to roast them breast side down. All the juices go into the breast keeping it so very moist. When I serve them, I put one on the platter breast side up, the other breast side down and we can pull off dark or white meat, whatever is your preference. I also baste the birds once or twice in the last couple of hours. This is a regular recipe at our house every two weeks or so... always need that meat for something, and it's a welcome, delicious meal, even for company. It looks like you've really worked hard! Awesome!!!

I followed recipe exactly and the result was delicious. The next time I used recipe I upped the temperature to lessen the cooking time and was still pleased with the moistness of the chicken.

Excellent! Moist and fall-off-the-bone tender. The chickens I bought were huge - fed 5 of us last night & 2 today. It made great chicken quesadilla filling! There's still some meat left and I'm looking for a recipe to use it up. I'd love to try cooking  them in the smoker next time.

Love love love this recipe!  Moist, juicy, lovely drippings for gravy.  We usually have one chicken for dinner with potatoes and gravy.  The next night I use the second chicken to make creamy chicken chile enchiladas.

I do reduce the salt to half.

Incredible ease and flavor. I didn't marinate with the rub. I just put the dry rub on the chicken and popped it in the oven. Wonderful!

My family loved the recipe.  I had one 4 lb Young Purdue roaster. It was a little too salty.  The next time I will cut the salt in half.  Had enough pan drippings to make gravy with (2) TBLS of cornstarch.  I cooked the chicken on 300 for 1 1/2 hours then turned down to 250 for 2 1/2 more hours because I was in a hurry.  I would suggest turning heat up in the last half hour if you have a browning problem like me. 
  Otherwise...excellent my family loved it.  Definitely a keeper.  They ate the whole chicken.

This is the best roasted chicken I have ever made.  This is my new "go to " recipe. Cut back on red pepper. The whole family loved it. 5 lb chicken took about 3 1/2 hours. Next time I am making two. There weren't any leftovers!

do not cook this chicken to "internal temperature of 180 degrees F". that is totally wrong, "internal temperature of 165 degrees F". Do not cook it for 5 hours, that's just insane. Other than that it was good.

I love this recipe. I made a bunch of the seasoning mix, and have used it to make chicken 5-6 times now. Every time it turns out perfectly. The meat is tender and juicy and the skin is SOO good it's difficult to resist. We then have chicken to eat for several more meals before making some sort of soup, all for less than $10. This is a winner!

this chicken tasted delicious and was incredibly easy to make.  i chose to make mine, breast side down, in the crock pot.  About 6 hours on low and it was done, although i kept it on "keep warm" about another 2 hours until dinner time.  it was incredibly tender and, as it describes, falling off the bone.  very good recipe, i highly recommend you try it!!

My entire family loved this. I put the breast side down when I cooked it, and the breast was incredibly juicy. Loved the fact that I didn't even have to baste it while it cooked.

I left out the white pepper because I didn't have any, but the seasoning for this chicken was wonderful and we loved the end product.  The chicken was tender and juicy.  I basted it once, mid-way.  I defatted the juice and made a delicious gravy with just a little cornstarch as there wasn't a need for additional seasoning.  What I liked about this recipe was the ease and simplicity in the preparation.  This recipe is a keeper!

An important additional note:  In my initial review, I failed to mention that I thought the original  recipe was much too salty.  I have since been preparing the seasoning with only 1 teaspoon of salt, rather than 4 teaspoons per the original recipe and it's quite adequate.  Another tip in the preparation is to place the chicken on plastic wrap, and rather than rub it with the seasoning, I prefer to sprinkle the seasoning mixture evenly over the entire chicken with a teaspoon, then I wrap it up tightly in the plastic wrap to marinate in the fridge, rather than rub the seasonings into the chicken with my fingers.  Rubbing it in causes 90% of the seasoning to end up on your hands and not on the chicken. My result, every time has been delicious chicken with moist and tender meat falling off the bone.

I have made this on two separate occasions and both times it turned out pretty good.  The first time I mixed of the seasonings with softened butter and slathered it all over the chicken.  That turned out to be really messy and I probably would not do that again.  The next time I made this, I made it with two chicken quarters.  I placed the chicken in a 9X9 square pan and let it marinate overnight.  The following day I took the chicken out of the fridge and let it sit on the counter top for about 30 minutes.  I then baked it in the oven on 325F for 2 hours.  I didn't open the oven until after the 2 hrs.  Update 3: used a 4lb chicken.  I did make a few minor changes to the rub (halved the recipe): Instead of 1/4 tsp cayenne, I used 1/8 tsp and instead of 1/4 tsp of garlic powder, I used 1/2 tsp.  I marinated the chicken overnight and let it sit on the counter about 2hrs before putting in the oven the next day.  The rub was placed on and under the skin as well as in the cavity.  Cooked in oven at 250f for 1.5 hrs and then raised the temp to 325F and cooked for another hour or until the thigh reached an internal temp of 165-170F.

The only thing I did was use a 4.5lb bird and used Italian seasoning blend in place of the thyme.  I cut back on the cayenne since the kids wouldn't enjoy the spice.  I roasted for 2 hours at 325 then bumped it up to 375 for an additional 20 minutes.  I roasted some potatoes and onions in the same pan and sprinkled the seasoning on those as well.  Divinity!

WOWZERS!  Awesome recipe.  My chicken came out moist and juicy - everyone raved about it!  I did find it to be a tad on the salty side, so I will cut back on it next time.  No more store bought roasters for us, I will use this recipe from now on.  Thanks a lot!

I didn't have time to marinade it but put the seasonings UNDER THE SKIN all over the chicken, as well as over the skin and inside the chicken.  I basted the chicken while cooking.
It was delicious!!!

very good!  my very picky 10 year went back for thirds!  I was in a pinch for time though and had to get the bird done ASAP - followed the recipe for the seasoning and put in pre-heated oven at 450 and it was done (by meat thermometer) in just under an hour -(just no drippings for gravy) still can wait to try the low and slow way too

Wonderful recipe! I omitted the paprika and white pepper that I didn't have on hand and used about a full teaspoon of garlic powder. Then rubbed the spices in and left bagged overnight. 
I was afraid of it drying out too much so about halfway through I basted the chicken and covered with lid. This retained the drippings which I then made gravy with. 
The only thing I will do differently is to try cutting the salt in half. The gravy was kind of salty, but good.
I will definately make this one again.

Made it as suggested exactly but left out the cayenne as I have young kids.  Tasted absolutely amazing and gave us a lovely juicy chicken.  I did not bake as instructed because I did not have time, just 350 for 1 hr 15 minutes and it was perfect for us. This will be my go to recipe.

Used 1/2 the recipe and reduced the salt even more for 2 whole chicken breasts. Baked about 4hrs., 5 hrs. would have been too long. It turned out good.

Amazing flavor! Hubby is not a fan of chicken UNTIL I made this! He couldn't stop raving about it.  I let the spices sit over night and it did not just flavor the skin but ALL of the meat! I used the leftovers to make Chicken enchiladas think it would make an awesome Lemon Chicken soup as well...thanks for the recipe 
P.S. My son said its the best chicken he has ever had and my daughter called it a "masterpiece".

This is amazing! I cut the salt in half, but I keep the rest of the ingredients the same. I usually rub this into the chicken overnight and keep it in a big ziplock baggie. I usually put it on low in the oven for 3-4 hours, but it works in a crockpot too. This rub makes amazing gravy as well. Delish :)

Made this last night. It was tasty and the family Loved it. I like the slow roasting. It was not quite what I expected though. Did not turn out as much like a rotisserie chicken as I would have liked and it wasn't "sticky" That being said I will make this again.

amazing. The ONLY changes I made: Only used 1 (6lb) chicken, I cut out the hot pepper (don't like spicy food) and I added a few cloves of garlic to the chicken cavity. Other than that I followed this recipe exactly and it was amazing.

DELICIOUS FLAVOR!! VERY GOOD RECIPE SUE ROGERS!! I used 1 whole 4 lb 15 oz bird. Rubbed bird ALL over with olive oil, some minced fresh garlic (that you get in a jar from the produce dept) & ALL the spices that was supposed to be for 2 birds. I rubbed it all under the skin also. I put 2 small pats UNSALTED butter under the skin. Basted 3 times. Excellent drippings. It's not too spicy, mellows out while cooking (I even added more cayenne). I used smoked paprika instead of the regular, which is what I use most of the time & used 1/2 the amont of salt (I used a combo of garlic salt & onion salt INSTEAD of PLAIN salt, which is what I use when cooking anyway). Next time I will take out at 4 hr (depends on your oven). Will make soup with carcass today. And I WILL DEFINITELY make this again. THANK YOU SUE!! ;o) UPDATE: I made chicken noodle soup with the leftovers & WOW the soup was AWESOME with all these seasonings that was used on the bird. NO LEFTOVERS at all!! Next time I make this I will remove ALL the skin & marinate a COUPLE of days & do in slow cooker. I will give an update on this after I make it. I will try this rub on a turkey too!

I thought this recipe was fabulous!!  I had to change a few things based on time and personal preference.  I omitted the cayenne pepper because our two young children do not like the spice.  I did not marinate it, I just rubbed the seasonings on with a little olive oil.  I did actually cook it on our gas grill rotisserie and it was super moist and juicy!  Our girls LOVED the chicken legs and skin!  Thanks for sharing the recipe Sue!!

I was so surprised at how wonderfully tender and juicy this recipe made the chicken. My boyfriend does not like eating chicken from the bone and he was so pleased that he had seconds. I will be using this reipe for years to come and pass it on to my family.

My husband just said this is the most moist chicken he's ever had.  I'd use a little less salt next time.  I put carrots / potatoes in the bottom of a roaster, one whole chicken on top of the veggies.  Did exactly as the recipe directs (using half the seasoning of the original recipe) and a couple pats of butter under the breast skin.  Will definitely use the technique again.

I rubbed the spice mix on drumsticks and let it marinate for 24 hours. Baked at 250 for about 1.5 hours (I forgot they were in the oven). Delicious! A little kick, but that's what makes it good!

This was the most incredible rotisserie chicken I have ever had. I love the rub so much I plan on using it for my turkey this year. I disagree with anyone who say's it comes out dry if you follow the directions it comes out heavenly!!

White meat turned out very dry and dark meat was moist.  I have cooked turkeys in less time.  Nothing sticky or rotisserie style about this chicken at all.  I agree with everyone else...save the time and buy it already cooked!

This was the best chicken I've ever made!  Will be making this again, for sure.  I didn't wrap it up in plastic the night before.  I just put it in a pan with a lid.  The crust turned out crunchy.  I think that next time I will do the plastic thing, just to see if it makes a difference.  My whole family loved this recipe!

I've made this twice now, once marinated over night and the second time I just popped in the oven after rubbing with spices. They were both great, but the one that I took the time to marinate was better. Love this recipe!!

My son is a mashed potato lover and I made the Party Potatoes with this.  I asked him how he liked the potatoes and he said they're good but he loved the chicken better!  He said it was probably the best roast chicken he has had in a long time.  What I did was prepared it the night before around 7PM with the spices and left in fridge overnight.  When I got up to get ready for work, I set the oven on 170 degrees and put the chicken and potatoes in the oven and let them cook all day while I was at work.  I didn't get home until 7PM and had to turn the oven up to 350 for a half hour to get another 10 degrees of internal cooking and to get more of a glaze on the chicken and the crust over the potatoes.  Clean up was so easy because it fell off the bone and I placed the leftovers in a bowl since two of my sons weren't home.  My daughter loved it too but she's more the type that just eats when she likes something and you hear if it's bad.  My children are young adults not little children.  This is definitely a keeper and I'm so grateful to Allrecipes for storing my recipes otherwise I would never find this one again.  Thank you for sharing Sue Rogers!  :)

This is the first whole chicken I have made that came out juicy.  I only had one bird (3.6 pounds) and I used all of the seasonings on it and marinated it overnight.  Mine was done in 3.5 hours.  Thanks for this great recipe!

Wonderful chicken and so easy to make!  Tasted almost exactly like a rotisserie chicken.  It was very moist and tender. I will definitely make this one again.

This the best roast chicken I have ever made, so moist and tasty. The only thing I did differently was roast the chicken breast side down for the first hour and a half, then flipped over. The breast stayed nice and moist and the skin crisped well.

This chicken recipe is very delicious.  As other reviewers stated, the chicken is moist, tender and zesty.  This recipe truly deserves a five star rating.  I have baked whole chicken several times but it did not turned out as yummy as this recipe. Moreover, this recipe is very simple to follow.  Thanks very much for sharing this excellent recipe.

Hmmm, I'm not sure how I feel about this recipe.  It doesn't live up to it's name.  It wasn't sticky and didn't taste like any rotisserie chicken I've ever eaten, but it was still good.  But just good.  For our taste, there is too much pepper of all types, and definitely too much salt.  But it did come out moist so that was a plus.

Instead of two smaller birds I used a 8 Lb oven stuffer roaster. I did prepare the bird yesterday and it sat seasoned overnight. I tried 250F but using a remote internal thermometer was concerned that it would not be cooked in 5 hours. So I toyed with the temp and for the last half hour it was at 350F. It finally reached 165F internally after 5 and 1/2 hours.
The taste was exactly as advertised. It tasted identical to rotisserie chicken however was much moister. I did baste it frequently and since it made very few juices of its own I used the water I had boiled the neck, gizzard and liver in for the dog. Very yummy, although I found the skin a little too intense for my tastes (I usually like rotisserie chicken skin). The bird was moist and extremely flavorful...well worth the extra trouble/ And I have made additional seasoning mix to keep on hand.

This came out great - I seasoned the bird and left it in the fridge stuffed with onions for 24 hours. I did not however cook it at 250 - more like 325 at a shortened amount of time. I covered it with foil for the first half and then uncovered it to crisp up the skin - came out super moist, wrapped in a crisp, well seasoned skin.

I will never buy another rotisserie chicken in the store, this recipe was amazing and I didn't even marinate it! I used a 7 pound chicken and it took like 6 hours to cook but, so well worth the wait.

AMAZING!  I will use this method for whole roasted chicken from now on.  Rubbing the herbs on the chicken and stuffing before wrapping in plastic wrap for overnight in the fridge makes a huge difference.  This method made my pretty good chicken into the best my family has ever tasted!

We love this recipe.  I made a huge portion of this rub and keep it in my pantry.  Now I just wash the chicken, pat it dry, and apply "the rub".  Super easy and super tasty!  Thanks

I will confess, I am bad at roasting anything.  My chickens are always undercooked and my beef and pork are never perfect.  This recipe was great I roasted both chickens; one for Sunday night dinner and the second for shredding for meals later in the week.  They were very moist!  My husband said that I should start roasting 2 chickens at a time from now on! LOL  I only had time to marinate for 4 hours but very good.  Great weekend chicken!

Love Love Love this!!!! I used it originally and followed the recipe and followed it completely and it turned out wonderfully, and because it was such a hit I decided to use it for our Christmas turkey.. It worked wonderfully. I put the rub on the turkey the night before. Put it in the oven at 350 breast down for 4 hours covered with foil. I then turned it over for the last 45min to an hour. It was awesome!!! I will use this again and again!!!

Yes the meat was falling of the bone, but I felt the meat was almost mushy in texture and had lost it's meaty feel.  Also a lot of juice came out of the bird in a 5 hour roasting and the low heat did not produce the crispy skin that high heat roasting does.  The rub is good and the 4 tsp of salt in effect "dry brined" the bird which always helps with flavor and tenderness.  The gravy was good probably due to so much of the juice being in the pan instead of in the bird.  I will stick with the traditional roasting methods.

AMAZING! My two year old and my picky husband even loved this! I  used one chicken instead of two but kept the spice amount the same, only thing I did was cut the Thyme in half to to meet my families taste preference. I also added minced garlic inside the chicken along with the onion.  I ran out of time and only marinated it for about an hour or two and then cooked it at 275' for a shorter amount of time and it still turned out fantastic. My mother in law was amazed that it was home cooked instead of a store bought routisserie chicken.

It was amazing.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the flavors didn't extend deep down into the chicken.   Modifications:  I added lemon juice to the inside of the chicken and outside before putting it in a plastic bag to sit overnight.  I also only did one chicken but used the same amount of seasoning that you would use for both.

I use this method for chicken and turkey and I love it. It is good to try and pull spices out before you server it because depending on the spices you use it doesn't make a good texture.

I made this for supper and it was very very good but not exactly what I was expecting. Defienatly making again with a few minor add ons and put on broil last couple of minutes to crisp up the skin a little....... ok so since I`ve made this the 1st time I`ve added more garlic, onion and cayenne and oregano instead of thyme and I must say it`s my got to seasoning for almost everything! This is great on chicken breast, salmon, sole, sweet potatoe french fries , shrimp and the list goes on. Thank you so much for the recipe!!

Great recipe! I didn't have any onions and I only marinated it for half an hour, and it still turned out great. So much better than the store-bought rotisserie chickens that have been sitting under a heat lamp for three hours.

very yummy. As I was taking the meat off the bone, it was falling off. I am now making stock out of these bones. Just keep an eye on the bird after 4 hours.

The BEST chicken I have ever made, and not trying to toot my horn, but even I can humbly admit that it is darn good!!!  Took another reviewer's advice and made a large quantity of the rub up for quicker prep, definitely do this next time you have all those spices out, great time saver!  This recipe will be used in our home for years, thanks so much!!

As with the other reviews, I wondering about the “sticky” part of the chicken’s name since it was neither sweet or sticky.  Maybe it is because the spices “stick” to the outside of the chicken? All I can say is who knows and who cares. This was amazing. Some reviews criticized the toughness/dryness of the chickens skin, but I actually preferred it since, we don’t eat the skin. Plus, it was so easy to peel off. The dark and white meat were tender and juicy, literally falling off the bone. So much better than any store bought chicken. I will say that next time; I will cut back on the salt, but otherwise….amazing. Also for the people that said it was tough or dry, make sure you have it on the correct temperature. Its 250 not 350. And like people, most ovens have their own personality, so your oven may be hotter than the temperature that you set it too. I love this recipe and will probably be a weekly/bimonthly staple on our menu at home and will be using the cooking method on my turkey this Thanksgiving. I cant wait!!!

Ok, I did not like this at all. It was not sticky - I don't know why they even named it that.  I was looking for the famous “sticky chicken” recipe – this was NOT it.  It did not resemble any rotisserie chicken I ever got from a deli at all.  Like so many others I do not understand the rave reviews – it doesn’t deserve it AT ALL.  

My suggestions to salvage this recipe if you must use it   1) Cut down on the onion unless you LOVE onions!  2)  Don’t expect a sweet glazed chicken - it will be covered in VERY STRONG red powder. Nothing sweet or sticky about it!  3) Unless you ADORE strongly spiced chicken DO NOT use more regardless of what other reviewers say!  In fact, use less! MUCH LESS!!!!  You can always sprinkle on more before you eat it if you like.  4) Be ready to make a gravy from the pan drippings – after such a long bake the chicken is dry - you will need it!!

Ummm, did not expect that!  This is so easy and so completely terrific.  Rather than whole chickens I prefer using chicken quarters or finding gigantic breasts and reduce the cook time just a bit.   I agree with the other reviewer that said the only thing they would change is to make a LOT of the rub so you have some ready any time you want. Thanks for sharing, it was delicious.

Love, love, love this recipe.  Simple, easy, and convenient.  The recipe also works well with leg and thigh quarters as well as split breasts.  Make sure you keep the skin on.  It helps with the flavor and protects the meat from drying out.  Besides, you can always peel it off before serving and/or eating.  Great recipe :o)

The seasoning is amazing! I made a few changes according to my own taste: halving the salt, increasing the garlic powder to a full tsp, adding 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, omiting the white pepper and increasing the black pepper to 1 tsp. The chicken turned out extraodinarily moist and flavorful.

This really is a great recipe.  I've made it four times in a month, and it's great every time.  I honestly don't understand why so many people leave off the white pepper, saying "who has white pepper?"  I had to leave off the white pepper once because I ran out, and you can really taste the difference when it's gone.  I have made this recipe and slow-cooked it as directed.  It turned out moist and tender, but didn't get sticky.  I honestly didn't care.  The skin was super-crispy, and there were some beautiful juices on the bottom of my pan.  It was delicious even if it wasn't sticky.  I've also prepped this as directed in the recipe and baked it at a higher temp for a shorter time, and it still made a wonderful baked chicken.  I now keep a shaker of this mixture in my spice cabinet to sprinkle over whole chicken, chicken breasts, and even roast veggies!  I hate to be one of those people who changes the recipe and then rates it based on a changed recipe... but I omitted a portion of the salt.  I do this because the chickens available to me are plumped with saline-based broth and are slightly salty to begin with.  Try adding some veggies and potatoes to the pan for the last 40 minutes or so, and you'll have a really great dinner.  I also really love to get an extra meal out of this one, so I throw the carcass in a stockpot and make some delicious chicken stock or soup.  Don't forget to use the onion from the cavity as well for this one!  Outstanding recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

Incredible chicken. Took about 4.5 hours in my oven. So tender and juicy. The spice rub actually permeates the skin and flavours the chicken. Can't give this recipe enough praise!!!  Thanks for sharing.

I don't usually eat the skin of chicken, I find the texture a bit "ick." This recipe is so good, I ate the skin. I baked as instructed for about 3 hours, then turned the oven up to 350 until the temperature registered at 180. I will be buying a lot more whole chickens in the future. This is such a good recipe.

Worth every star! Followed the recipe except I misread and put the onion in upon cooking (rather than the night before), also took a tip from another reviewer and put garlic inside as well. I was skeptical because I thought cooking chicken uncovered for so long would result in a dry bird, but other reviewers are indeed correct that the meat is falling off the bones. My boyfriend said it was the best chicken he'd had in his life (haha..) I will definitely be making this again!

I've made this 10 times or more and I love the spice mixture-I keep alll the individ spices on hand so it's a breeze to whip up when I want to make it.  I only reduce the salt by half since I'm trying to lower my salt intake and with all that flavor going on I don't miss it.

This was fantastic, and although I had to amend the recipe a bit because I didn't have all of the ingredients...........I still think i'm able to give this 5 stars:)  The flavor was even amazing on the "inside" of the chicken......it wasn't just the skin that had all of the flavor.  I think this is because It marinated all day long & because there was marinade and garlic on the inside of the bird.  SO, I replaced oregano for the thyme (don't like thyme), and a lil more black pepper in place of the white pepper (don't like white pepper either!).  I didn't have any onions, so I put a few fresh cloves of garlic on the inside of the bird.  ALSO I added melted butter to all of the spices to make a paste to put on the chicken............it was delicious!!  Might cook it for less time though, the next time I make it.

Wow!!  I have been making roasted chicken for over 15 years, but this is by far better than anything I've ever made!  I too eliminated the white pepper since I didn't have it on hand and increased the black pepper and garlic powder to full teaspoons.  I also only cooked one large chicken (5+ lbs.) but I made the full recipe of spice mix and reserved half for next time.  I cooked it for 5 hours and it was perfect - tender, juicy, and falling off the bone.  The gravy is fantastic!  I have made this twice now and can only say that I wish there was a recipe like this for a whole turkey.  TIP: If you aren't going to be home to put the chicken in the oven 5 hours before dinner time, use the delay timer on your oven (most have this feature).  I put the chicken in the roasting pan in the oven before I leave, set the timer to start the oven in the afternoon, and when I get home the chicken is done and the house smells great!

I will never use another roasted chicken recipe again!  Since I didn't even decide to cook this until 3:30 this afternoon, I obviously couldn't follow the directions exactly.  I rubbed the chicken with everything except Thyme and let it sit in the frig. for 1 1/2 hour.  I cooked the chickens on 350 degrees for 2 hours.  It was very good, very moist and not bland at all.  I didn't need any sauce or anything.  I will definitely be making this again!

Ten Stars!!! This is the best chicken I have ever had!! I made two chickens and stated and thought it would make good leftovers. Boy am I glad I did!! The drippings made the most wonderful gravy (and I am not normally a gravy fan!!) My dad, who doesn't normally like onions, LOVED the onions that had cooked in the middle!! This goes on my monthly menu now!!

I made this recipe tonight and it was absolutely fabulous!  I always brine my chickens and turkeys in salted water overnight, and the next night I let the chicken marinate in the rub.  Hands down, this was the BEST roast chicken I have ever made.  The meat literally fell off the bones!!!  I have kidney disease and must watch my salt intake, so I relied on the brining process to provide the salt needed and used none in the rub.  Absolutely delicious!!!  Unbelievably good!!!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe that I will make every chance I get from now on!!!

Really tasty, really easy, and I wouldn't have thought to make two chickens at once. I think that's what I'm going to do from now on. It wasn't sticky - I'm not sure why - and it didn't seem especially rotisserie style to me. But it WAS extremely tender, and the spice rub was quite good.

So good! I didn't have any white pepper or dried thyme, but I did use poultry seasoning in place of that. Also cut the cayenne to about 1/4 tsp (just personal taste). I added some chopped celery to the chicken cavity along with the onion. Also rubbed some of the spice mix under the breast skin. I didn't get to marinate this for too long, about two hours, but it was still juicy and flavourful. Made gravy from the pan juices plus chicken broth and some flour. I plan on making a big batch of this to keep around! Although I will cut back on the salt a bit, was just a little too much for me. This recipe was SO good it made me want to eat more white meat! The breast was juicy and tender not dry. I basted the chicken with its own juices for the last hour. LOVED this. Next time I want to try mixing the spices with butter and smearing that all over the chicken. Thanks so much, this is a new family favourite!

I have made this a couple times now and everytime we have had company over and they love it.  I cook it rotisserie style on the BBQ (low heat) with a pan filled with a mixture of chicken broth and left over spices (from rub) underneath the chicken & baste about every 20 min. Comes out juicy and wonderful.

Scale to 96 servings; get a Mason jar and store the rest.  Works really well with turkey legs and the recipe is very forgiving on the time requirement.  In a pinch you could rub the poultry and cook right away, although the marinade time and slow roast definitely yields more flavor.

I always cook my whole chickens breast side down so the breast meat doesn't dry out. I use all the spices on one chicken. This meat is so flavorful and juicy. It is my favorite way to fix a whole chicken. Perfect!

This is the BEST roast chicken recipe I have tried yet! My only change is to reduce the salt, I use about 1-2 teaspoons, I found 4 too salty.  I love the chicken you can get at rotisserie restaurants but it can get pretty expensive. I make this in bulk on a weekend, separate the meat from the bones (bones I use for homemade stock), and put the meat into freezer bags to pull out on a weeknight when I need it. It makes delicious sandwiches and wraps. My favorite way is to fry the chicken in a little bit of olive oil until slightly crispy, top it with a little bit of garlic mayonnaise (minced garlic mixed into plain mayonnaise) and make a pita wrap out of it. Mimics a middle eastern sandwich I really like from a restaurant I went to once.

What a good chicken!  We ate (there's only 2 of us) the entire bird.  My husband couldn't stop commenting on the tenderness of the meat.  I don't usually cook whole chickens, but this will be a forever recipe!

Love this recipe, I've made it several times as listed and the results have been outstanding.  I highly recommend marinating overnight otherwise the salt doesn't do its thing.  I agree with the suggestion to make lots of the spice mix in advance!! The only other thing I do is to cook the chicken breast side down it just makes a good thing better. DEFINITELY TRY THIS RECIPE, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!

The best roast chicken you will ever eat.  This was so easy and so simple.  It was a meal that everyone in the house ate and that is a tough feat in my house of picky eaters.  The only thing I did differently was to add a little crushed garlic under the skin of the chicken.  Delicious.  I can't wait to make it again.

I know I'm in the minority here, but I didn't care for this recipe.  I only cooked one chicken, but I checked the temp frequently to make sure it didn't overcook.  While the dark meat was nice and moist, the white meat was dry.  And the crispy skin is usually my favorite part, but it was beyond crispy and almost inedible because it was so leathery.  I'll stick to my standard of dry brining Zuni Cafe-style, and butterflying and roasting at a high temp.

Just came out of oven and is resting.  Took a sneak sample and it is great.  Moist, juicy and tasty.  I made changes the same as many others suggested:  less salt, whole garlic in cavity with onion, rub olive oil on skin before putting spice mixture on, basting a few times, and MOST IMPORTANT check internal temperature after 3 hours.  My roaster was 5.25 lbs. and at 3 hours 20 minutes temperature was 165 at oven temp at 250.  I raised the heat to 500 degrees for 5 minutes to brown the skin evenly.  Looks pretty and tastes great.  This one is a keeper.

Absolutely perfect just as it is written- the only teensy weensy thing I would say is to cut the salt a bit .... especially if you make gravy afterwards and use chicken broth- that’s a lot of sodium! But  good chicken! I like other reviewers will never make another type of roast chicken ever again. This is THE recipe !

Just got this out of the oven and boy is this bird moist. I think I even left in the oven a little to long.  Seasoning is very flavorful and penetrated all of the meat.  Thanks for this easy and tasty recipe.  this is one even my older kids can make.

I must have made this about half a Dozen Times by now. The ONLY Change I made was: I put a Can of Chicken Broth in the Bottom of the Roasting Pan and basted two to three Times. Oh my Gosh, the BEST Chicken I have ever had!

This chicken was delicious!  I only had to bake it for 4 hours (not 5) but it was a huge hit!  At first I was critical, because it seemed too simple, but it was awsome!  My mother asked me for the recipe because she was so impressed!  I definitly recommend this recipe!

This recipe is outstanding. My husband, who believes that chicken is only good if it's fried and from a restaurant, asks for this chicken regularly. My daughter adores it. Now, when I get chicken from the market, I put the rub on it before it's frozen. That way, it can marinate as it thaws. This is wonderful!

After sampling this recipe, all I can say is that I ran to my local grocer and purchased 8 small hens ... we absolutely fell in love.  Made exactly as directed - and wouldn't change a thing.  Outstanding!

Absolutely the best chicken I have ever had!!! My entire family loved this recipe, even the most picky eaters. I doubled the garlic and added 1 tsp. of our favorite chicken seasoning from frankenmuth as well as 1 tsp. of "Emeril's Bayou Blast". Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe! I will use it for the rest of my life! Definitely a must try!

I thought this was awesome! I rubbed the spice mixture all over the chicken and under the skin, placed a quartered onion and a tablespoon of minced garlic as well as some salt in the cavity, wrapped it up twice and let it sit overnight.  The next day I roasted it in the pan. I gave it a 20 minute heat blast at 350 and basted it for the first hour.  Next time I probably will just let it sit at 250 for the entire four hours because the breast was a little dry. No need for gravy with this, it really tastes good enough and moist enough to eat on its own!

VERY GOOD!  I made this on a whim and didn't have time to let it sit for more than about an hour as well as having to up the temp a little so we could eat on time and it was still great! That was earlier this week.  Now I am prepping the chicken so that I can share it with extended family for a birthday dinner tomorrow.  I am planning on making the gravy again too...supper easy and wonderfully flavorful.  I just made the gravy with drippings, flour and water.  YUMMY!

Ok, so I haven't "technically" made this recipe yet, but it's identical to a recipe my mom used to make when I was a child, and it is WONDERFUL!  My bird is marinating in the fridge right now.  This is excellent!

The best rub!  Have made this so many times that now I just keep a jar with the rub premixed in it and use 2-3 tablespoons for each chicken.  To premix a larger amount of the rub, I took someone elses suggestion and selected "80" servings on the recipe & it gave me amts in cups.  Rub is also great on turkey and lamb.  Have made the chicken in rotisserie and oven, comes out great every time!

i love this chicken. i made it a month or so ago and didnt review it but since ive made it 3 other times i felt i really should. ive even marinated one and frozen it ready to go. this chicken is good for a nice chicken dinner but its not overly spicy that you cant make other things with the leftovers. ive changed it here and there with what i had on hand but hands down its my favorite recipe on this site.

Yum, yum. I was pleasantly surprised at how well this recipe turned out.  I lifted the skin and rubbed the spices on the meat and on top of the skin.  This was incredibly delicious.  The onion in the cavity really added a great flavor to the meat.  I will make this again and again.  Very good.

Everyone says this is the best roast chicken.  It is even better if you brine the chicken the night before.  I have even given jars of this rub to people for christmas.

I love love love this recipe and make it at least once every 2 weeks. I cook it for 20 min at 400* then knock down the temp to 325* for an hour and a half.   I make this seasoning and bulk and recently discovered it's excellent in ground turkey for turkey burgers!

This was a fabulous recipe.  Well worth the time it took to prepare.  I was surprise that the skin was as crispy as it was.  I usually pull off the skin for calorie reasons but not this time. I have not eaten this much chicken skin in 20 years.  I added some chopped garlic with the onion in the cavity of the bird.  My bird was done a bit earlier so next time I will definitely use a thermometer (my fault)  and I might try to rub just a tiny bit under the skin too.   Thanks for sharing.

I made this as is and loved the ease, cooking method, moistness and basic flavor. I gave this a 5 star, HOWEVER, I think this should have said "spicy" not "sticky". The amount of red, white and black peppers was too much for the kids and my husband. That being said, I will definitely make this again but will make adjustments to suit our taste. We still agreed it is a wonderful recipe. Just a note, if you have a Convection Oven, the (2) 4lb chickens I made took 2.5 hours on Convection Roast at 250 F. I will make adjustments in the future to meet our schedule, but good to know if that applies to you.

This really is good - even the hubby who is not big on chicken said how good.  It was easy too.  I took a tip from a previous recipe I made from this site for roast beef and mixed the olive oil with all the spices.  Let it sit for 10 mins. and then rubbed all over the bird.  Very good and will definitely make it again.  In fact, I purchased two birds and made them in my biggest roasting pan so that we had one chicken one night, and the next night, when I wasn't going to be home, my hubby and boys heated up the 2nd bird.

This is an excellent and flavorful chicken. I will double the seasonings next time, but that is only a personal preference and it probably doesn't need it.

This was okay, not spectacular like I was expecting. I liked that it cooked low for 5 hours so it freed up my time.

This is just like the chicken we buy at the deli. I halved the recipe and used 1- 4 lb chicken. It cooked for 4 hours and I served with steamed carrots and stove top stuffing. I will definetly make this again! Thanks!

WOW I was really surprised that this turned out so good. I am known for drying out any meat I cook. I've even tried doing chicken like this before years ago, not sure what was different this time but obviously something, not sure if it was the low temp??? Or perhaps the overnight soaking...anyway this was definately a keeper and we'll be a weekly menu item!

This is a keeper I marinated my chicken for 24hrs and then cooked it for about 5 hrs..The only changes I made were to melt a little butter and rub it into the chicken before I seasnoned it and I started cooking the bird at 275 and gradually increased it to 350 last last hour of cooking just to make sure the skin was crispy...The end result was a very juicy chicken with a a great taste...I will definately make it again

This was an AWESOME recipe! I used chicken leg quarters because they were on sale, but did everything else the same. Came out PERFECT! Even my hubby, who is very picky when it comes to chicken, found himself taking the leftovers to work for lunch! Will DEFINITELY use this again!

I had a 7 lb. roaster so that's what I used for this recipe.  It baked for about 5 hours at 250, and then I cranked it up to 350 at the end for about 20 minutes to get it done in time for dinner.  It was about falling apart, and my husband loved it.  I'm not afraid to roast a chicken anymore!  Thanks!!

I admit that I have used hundreds of online recipes, both here at allrecipes as well as others, but never have I felt so strongly about the outcome to feel an absolute NEED to comment.  As some have suggested, I too added garlic to the onions in the cavity and ended up marinating 24+ hours. I only eat white meat, which as everyone knows, can often be quite dry.  This however is, BY FAR, the BEST chicken EVER!  It turned out so incredibly moist and flavorful-even the breast, that I will NEVER roast a chicken ANY other way! As I write this, I am having the leftovers from last night's dinner and am getting a little sad now that it is almost gone... LOL Thanks for posting - it's a KEEPER!!!!

This wonderful recipe has become a standard in my repertoire. If you're like me you buy sale meats in quantity, and it's not much more work to prep whole birds with spices before wrapping for the freezer. Then I just defrost and pop in the oven. One caveat: if left uncovered, the skin become crisp to the point of leatheriness, maybe because I often use fryers instead of roasters. But even fryers come out succulent after just 4 hours when covered while cooking.

This was pretty good.  I didn't use the method of cooking but used the spices and then put it my rotisserie oven.  I think that I overcooked it a little but I will def make it again.

I will never stray from this recipe! I only let them marinate for maybe 3 hrs, I am really looking foward to doing it over night as the recipe calls for. I notice alot of reviers skipping the onion in the cavity... put something in there! I think an aromatic would work fine, but the onion releases moisture into the breasts along with the flavor. I think my white meat was juicier than the dark! I put the chickens on top of whit potatos and carrots that I seasond liberally with minced onions, garlic, and s&P. Fantastic all in one, set it and forget recipe. I cannot wait to try out a chicken salad with the leftovers.

UPDATE: I made this again last night when my hub and I had guests for dinner and it was even better than the first time. I cooked the chicken at 350 for 1.5 hrs and it was just as good as the first time!!!!!   (ORIGINAL REVIEW:)DELICIOUS! I used the leftovers to make chicken soup that tastes better than my mom's thanks to all the spices and yummy juices in the pan. I also made myself chicken salad for the first time with the leftover white meat - AMAZING! Thanks for the great recipe.

This chicken is so moist! It is wondeful.  I did change the spices slightly using what I had on hand.  In addition to the onion in the cavity, I added lemon wedges and fresh rosemary.  I also cooked with the breast down.  It was ready in a little over 4 hours.  I'm glad I did not cook it the full 5 hours.  It might not have been as moist.  I will certainly cook this again!  Thanks for the recipe Update:  I made this again and this time instead of the rosemary and lemon, I put a sliced fresh jalapeno (seeded) and some honey in the cavity.  It gave it a wonderful flavor.  It was not spicy at all.  I cooked one 4 lb chicken and it was done in 3 1/2 hours.

Yummy, yummy.  Followed this exactly. Then stuck it in the smoker for the 250 degree, 5 hour part.  The best chicken to ever come out of the smoker. Thanks!

This works great, tastes very similar to a super market rotisserie chicken and the drippings make a delicious gravy. I only made one small chicken (maybe 4-5 lbs). I stuffed it with 1/2 an onion and a heads-worth of garlic cloves and left it in the fridge to marinate for 10 hours, about halfway through cooking I basted it in 1/4 cup melted butter.

This has been my standard chicken recipe for years and nothing tops it. But I wanted to add that this dry rub can be used in many other ways. Mix up extra and keep it on hand in your spice cabinet to use on pork and turkey as well. I've used it on our Thanksgiving turkey to rave reviews, baby back ribs that were to die for, and we'll be putting it on grilled pork chops for our New Year's meal. It's consistently a hit.

Fall of the bone, finger lickin', I want more chicken, getting my 2 & 4 year old to eat, good. This is really the best whole chicken recipe I have used. So easy and taste better than that place famous for rotisserie chicken. 

In a hurry? Skip the overnight marinading. Just rub her down and stick her in the oven at 350 for 2 1/2 hours, then 250 until you are ready to pull her out. Turns out perfect.

Very very good. I made one exactly as stated one time (EXCEPT HALF THE SALT), then last night I used it on a buttered cut-up chicken (less baking time). Part smoked paprika is an excellent addition. I once added 1/2 tsp poultry seasoning to the spices. Even my pickiest said this was better than our local rotisserie chicken joint. Served with honey-roasted red potatoes (this site). Note: I would finish this (last hour?) at a higher temp to crisp the skin properly.

Great Great chicken recipe.  very simple.  i made  using one six pound chicken so cut to a 6 serving recipe.  i did not have onion powder so i replaced it with some adobo.  

i rubbed the chicken with olive oil before rubbing the seasoning on and took the suggestion of putting some under the skin. I wrapped in the plastic wrap and left for 24hrs.  

 i cooked at 350 for a little over 2.5 hrs, each hour i used the "misto" to spray with a little olive oil.  It was falling off the bone and delicious. 

 To make the gravy i took the drippings added one cup of water and one chicken bulion cube.  boiled and stirred in corn starch.  GREAT!

Easy to make and my husband and daughter liked it. A good way to make lots of chicken so you have leftovers for meals later in the week. The cooking time was too long, though, so start checking the temperature of the chicken early (at least an hour before they are supposed to be done) so you don't end up with two dried out chickens. Thanks for the interesting recipe idea.

More than 5 stars from the scotdog family! It is delish. We usually make the Beer Butt Chicken on the grill, but this will be our "winter" way to make chicken from now on. It was so tasty & tender. No salt for us, upped the other spices, otherwise followed the recipe. I did take it out after 4 hrs. Family was hungry & my chicken was not a big one. Thanks!

This recipe is incredible!  The leftovers (if you have any!) are better the second day.  Hats off to this chef!
I will be using this for many years to come!

I made this for dinner last night.  It was very good.  I believe next time I put the rub on and let it sit for 24-48 hours.  My dh and I were amazed that there was one flavor on the outside and it was very different on the inside.  It needs more time to all come together.  I made it beer butt style with red wine in the "cavity".  I then added the red wine to the drippings to make gravy. WOW! It was amazing! I wasn't sure what the red wine would do but it was awesome!!!

I was waiting for the weather to cool down to make this because of the time I would have the oven on and I wish I didn't wait so long. My oldest son ate all the skin off and then devoured half the chicken. I'm out to get another roaster right now. See ya!

I have made this twice, and it got much better the second time. Marinating the chicken overnight is misguided. In addition to it being a pain to stuff the chicken in a plastic bag, most of the spices fell off. The second time, I rubbed the spices on right before baking, and the results were much better. I used a 6 lb chicken, halved the spices, and it took 3 hours in the oven. I rate this highly for ease and the good rub. It tasted pretty good. However, it wasn't spectacular, and not quite close to real rotisserie.

This chicken was absolutely wonderful.  It had just the right amount of seasoning and was so moist and fell off the bone!  We saved a lot of time cutting it up that way!  My 90-year-old grandmother just loved this chicken, which says a lot, as she is a VERY FUSSY eater and let's me know what a recipe needs a little more of or a little less of.  I took her a whole one of her own and while I was sitting there, she ate half of it, she just couldn't put it down, which says a lot!  Try this recipe, you won't be disappointed!!!

This is infinitely better than I expected it to be. I can't believe that I made it! I've never cooked a whole chicken before (I wasted more than a decade as a vegetarian). It is perfect and so juicy. I do suggest using a thermometer, not just timing 5 hours. I can't imagine what would have happened if I kept it in that long! My birds were done in 2 hours. Also, I don't have a roasting pan, so I cooked them on cooling racks over casseroles. Crispy skin on all sides!

I used the seasoning for this on my chicken that I put in my rotisserie. It was AWESOME! I even made up a bunch of the seasoning to have on hand! It is now our "go to" rub for rotisserie chicken. I made it for the second time a couple of days ago, and my family has already requested it again, so I'm making it again tonight. The only "changes" I made, were all black pepper, because I don't have white (I will buy some for this, though) and I used kosher salt. YUM!

The more I use this recipe the more I appreciate it. The chicken always turns out juicy with skin full of the rub flavour. I add flour and chicken broth to the pan drippings to make a tasty gravy.  Waiting till chickens are on sale for 2 for 1 makes this main course very economical. This dish feeds 7 - 8 people and leftovers if you have any, can be frozen of course. Thanks for this recipe I will use it again and again.

This really is as good as everyone said. The recipe calls for dried thyme, white pepper and cayenne pepper none of which I had. We certainly didn't feel like we were missing anything though. We couldn't get enough of it. Today I am cooking for someone who lost a family member.....I am going to give them one and keep one for my family (recipe calls for two chickens) works out so well.  :o)

This turned out so moist and delicous! The only thing I did differently is soften a stick of butter and mix it with the dry rub, then I rubbed this all over the chicken.

This has become my 'go-to' recipe for chicken.  It simply doesnt fail.  I have done it exactly as the recipe says and marinated overnight, and cooked over low heat.  I have also done it by not marinating it at all, and cooking it at 375 when I was short on time.  Both ways comes out perfect and delicious.  I always try to rub some of the seasoning under the skin.  I do usually try to double the seasonings.  The leftovers are great in chicken pot pie.  Try this recipe - you will love it!

Fantastic. Didn't change the spices at all. However, my family prefers the breast of the chicken, so instead of a whole chicken, I used bone-in skin on chicken breasts. I started marinating in the morning, and when It was time to cook, I put the chicken breasts (skin side up) in a roasting bag and cooked for 1 1/2 hours at 350 degrees. So good. We will be making this often.

Absolutely deelish! The only thing I did differently was cook just one 4-lb. chicken at 325 degrees for just 2 hours or so. Then I turned the oven off and left the chicken in it while I pan fried potatoes. I also added four garlic cloves to the onion stuffed in the chicken cavity.

Excellent flavor without making any changes. Only thing I will do different next time (and there will be many next times) is to lift up the sking where possible, and add some of the seasoning mix direct to the chicken.

Outstanding. This is the best roasted chicken recipe I have ever made, and I have made quite a few. Super moist and perfectly flavored. I made only one chicken for my family of 5 and it was perfect. Save the drippings for gravy. Excellent!!!

While this wasn't sticky like the recipe title suggested, it DID taste the most like rotisserie chicken I've ever tasted from an oven. The seasoning mix was wonderful - slightly spicy, for those who prefer mild foods I'd either play with the cayenne amounts or omit it all together. The meat was exceptionally tender after 4 hours at 250. While I prefer other baked chicken recipes, when I get that rare craving for rotisserie chicken I'll reach for this one - thanks so much for sharing :)

This came out tender and juicy without all the trouble of dragging out the rotisserie. The spices are just about right. In reading some of the other reviews, while I wasn't surprised that some cooks cut the salt, I have to say that the only place I even tasted it was the pan juices and even then I wouldn't say that it was overly salty. The only change I made was to cover the chicken for a little while because for whatever reason the chicken began to dry out a little too much.  I haven't really figured that out because I was using an larger chicken...but it could have just been my oven, who knows. The next time that I make it I think I will try the roasting bag method another poster mentioned just because of my oven. Overall though, the family was quite pleased with the taste....there is none left! It was tasty...thanks for posting :)

Update: I just made this on the gas grill rotisserie for July 4th and it came out amazing!  My family just raved!  We had 4 meat selections and the only thing I have left is hamburgers...the chicken and pork tenderloin were the first to go.  From here on out, I will be marinating it and then putting it on the spit.

This is a GREAT recipe. I just seasoned the chicken (sans the white pepper), and put it straight in the oven. I was nervous that letting it sit for a few hours was an important step I was skipping, but it turned out perfect. It was so moist that when we went to carve it the bones just slid right out. My father who was a professional chef for many years said it was "outstanding" which I have never heard him say about anything ever served to him.

I made this chicken last night. It is amazing. The flavor is awesome. I cooked mine in the slow cooker for about 7 hours on low. I'm making a small pot of soup with the leftovers right now. AMAZING!!!

This was the first time that I ever roasted a chicken, and chose this recipe for its simplicity.

Turns out that I already had most of the spices in my cupboard, and with a $3.79 chicken I was ready to go!

I had no idea this could be so easy, and thanks to everyone else who's reviewed this recipe, because y'all gave me some great ideas to help me along here.

I highly recommend this recipe!

yummy!  If I could give it more stars I would!  I've made this so many times now and would like to share that I no longer marinate it, or cook it according to the recipe and it turns out perfect every time.  I just put the spices together, rub it all over one large chicken and bake it at 350 for a few hours until done.  It is moist and perfect every single time.  The juices make a VERY delicious spicy gravy, too.

I'm rating this two stars because the chicken was moist. We didn't care for the flavor at all. The thyme was too strong and it was not sticky or spicy at all!  You can try this recipe, but I suggest using your own spice mix.

Wow! This did taste and look like a rotisserie style chicken, but only after I made some changes. 1. I cooked only one chicken at 325 for 1 and 1/2 hours. 2. I rubbed under and over the skin with butter. 3. I spritzed the chicken with Pam before baking. I did not change the rub mix, only cut in half. Loved this, and will definitely make again! The meat was so moist.

I cooked this in my slow cooker and I skipped the overnight "marinating". I layered onions on the bottom of the crock and then I cooked it all day on the 8-hour setting. I transferred it to my oven under the broiler to crisp up the skin. It was super tender! When you take it out of the oven, cover it with foil and let it rest 15 minutes before you cut it and it will be sooo juicy. I didn't notice any lack of flavor from not seasoning it overnight. Served it with green bean casserole and sauteed squash. Great recipe.

the chicken was very moist, but I didn't really understand the "sticky" part. On the other hand this recipe makes an absolutely fanTASTIC gravy. Oh my goodness, I couldnt get enough! I just added a can of chicken broth to the pan drippings and boiled it down and added a little cornstarch. I would make this chicken again just for the gravy! But overall it was an alright chicken recipe

I give this 5 stars for taste, but only a 4 star rating due to it not matching the description.  The skin was very dry and not edible with no sticky glaze like a rotisserie style chiken.  Maybe basting would have helped, but who wants to do that all day.  I also caution on the time it takes to bake.  At 3 1/2 hours I checked it with an instant read thermometer, and pulled it out then.  Added one can of chicken broth and cornstarch to the drippings for some of the best gravy.  I recommend this recipe, just be aware what you will get is a very flavorful roasted chicken.

This is the best chicken recipe of EVER! The only changes I made were using cut up chicken pieces and after it marinated overnight I rubbed about 2 Tbsp of butter over the pieces. I baked it covered at 325 for 1 hour, then I uncovered it and raised the temp to 350 for about 40 minutes. This chicken turned out juicy, and the pan drippings were amazing over mashed potatoes. You have to try this recipe!

I made this rub just as the recipe said.  I did rub my chicken all over with olive oil first.  Then put the rub on and instead of roasting in the oven I actually cooked it in my showtime rotisserie.  It was juicy and fell right off the bone.

Was very good. I only used 1 chicken so I cooked it at 300 Degrees for 2 1/2 hours. I also followed one of the other reviewers recipe for gravy by mixing the dripings with 1 Tablespoon Corn starch and 1 can of chicken broth, It was excellent! Even my picky hubby liked this one!

This was a great recipe!  Well, our version of it!  While preparing the chicken, I discovered that I didn't have any paprika nor onion powder.  So, I substituted turmeric for the paprika and omitted the onion powder all together.  Oh my goodness was it good.  I also made some compound butter of the same spice mixture and slid it under the skin of the breast.  Since I also just made one bird, I cooked it at 300 as it was suggested for 2 hours 40 minutes and then I turned up the heat to 375 for the last 10 minutes to crisp up the skin (I also sprayed Pam on the skin before I sprinkled the spices on the bird).  Lastly, I added a celery stalk and a couple of cloves of smashed garlic to go with the onion inside the cavity.  We can't wait to try the recipe in its original form! :)

Great chick. I used a 6.5 lb chicken and it was up to 170 degrees(180 when you cover chicken for 30 minutes after you remove it from the oven)when I cooked it for 5 hours. I will add extra garlic season next time. Chick sat with seasoning on for 4 hours before I put it in the oven. Wonderful.

I call this my "Gone Golfing" recipe.  Put it in the oven, 4 1/2 hours for the round of golf and home for a cooked chicken dinner. Incredibly tender and juicy results.

I followed the recipe exactly as written, even marinating it overnight.  The next day I started roasting it and it was up to temperature in 1 1/2 hours!!!  Well I managed to keep it warm until dinnertime and surprisingly it still was moist and tasty, however it was not the "sticky" chicken I was hoping for.  I think once I have my oven recalibrated (!) I'll try it again.

Terrific! I had my doubts and was dying to try this. I wrapped it up tight with plastic wrap over night. I followed the recipe exactly and this was the best roast chicken I've ever made and I've made a lot. It also made some great juices for the most flavorful gravy! The breast was super moist also. I'll be roasting my chickens this way from now on. Great recipe!

This was my first time roasting a chicken and it turned out great! I used double the amount of spices except I kept the salt at 4 teaspoons. For someone who doesn't want it salty I would use even less salt, it was perfect for us but we like things salty. I roasted mine (I cooked 2 at once) exactly as instructed for 5 hours. I basted it once about an hour before it was done. There was NO need to add additional liquids as the chicken produced plenty. I used the juices to make a gravy that was phenomenal. It had a little kick to it...the best gravy I have ever had. 

This is a wonderful recipe and I will be using it again and again!! I paired this with the Oven Roasted Red Potatoes (Donna Lasater) and it was wonderful!

My husband really liked this so I'm giving it four stars. I just thought it was okay. I expected it to have more flavor. I put lots of seasoning on the inside and outside. Next time I will put seasoning under the skin. But it was juicy and not dry. I marinated the chicken overnight and used a roaster chicken. It was ready in about 4 hours.

I followed the recipe exactly, but raised the temp to 350 and cooked my chicken for two hours because I didn't have 5 hours to wait. I also covered it the first hour, basted it with butter, then cooked it uncovered the last hour.  It came out perfect.

Excellent! I do cut back on the amount of peppers when I am using just one large chicken.  Also, every time I have made this, the chicken is done in about 3 - 3 1/2 hours, don't think I would want to go the full 5 hours.

Wow! What a wonderful recipe! I fall far from being a good cook (always managing to destroy every meal), but i nailed this one. I was surprised at how simple it was, and even more surprised at how great it tasted. I followed the recipe exactly, except for basting it every 30 minutes. I let it cook about an hour less because my bird was 3.5 lbs. so it was tender and flavorful to the last bite. I really think putting the spices on over night made a delightful difference. Make it and enjoy!

Honestly, I couldn't see anything special in this recipe. I decided to do it based on the great ratings on it, but after doing it I couldn't see any reason why it got all these ratings. I was gonna give it one star, but I put two becuase the meat is really moist and tender. But the spice blend and the taste is no big deal AT ALL.

Eh... just roasted chicken. All the flavor was on the skin. It was falling off the bone when I tried to remove it from the pan, but it sure wasn't "sticky" and the meat really could have had more flavor.

This recipe ROCKS!  Until I found this recipe I had only cooked a whole chicken either in the crock pot or roasted at high heat (causing the house to fill with smoke).  I have made this chicken twice now and both times it turned out beautiful, juicy and delicious.  

Wouldn't change a thing - thank you, thank you, thank you!

WOW this chicken was excellent!!  I did a 5-lb whole chicken.  My oven only seems to go to one temp, 350, so we put it on the lower rack and basted every 30 minutes.  It took about 2 1/2 hours to reach 180 internal temp.  The pan drippings made a gravy that was the bee's knees let me tell you.  And the chicken was the best I have ever made of this type... now I want to make it again for next weekend!  I would say this would go really well with the bone-in chicken breasts too if you don't want to do a whole bird. Make sure you get the kind with skin though because the skin was so flavorful.  I cannot say enough about how fabulous this recipe is.  YUMMO

Love this. It has become a regular in the summer or winter. It's great because it doesn't heat up the kitchen too much. So much better than those grisly things at the grocery store.

Delicious!!  Will make again!  I was a little worried about the cayenne in this one, but it was just enough to give it some flavor, not too hot and not too wimpy.  We loved it!  Thank you for sharing.

Made this chicken last night, instead of 2 birds I used one 5 pounder, I kept the same amount of seasoning but changed the cayenne to a chipotle pepper powder (less heat more taste). The chicken was so yummy I will make it again!!!

Not quite like we get @ the store but extremely close to it. Very moist and tender.  The only down side is planning ahead with the marinade and cooking time. If you do plan ahead you will be well rewarded. 
Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good moist chicken. I increased the amounts of onion and garlic powder plus added the juice of one lemon. Great recipe.

Wonderful! I only did one chicken though and so I should have reduced the cooking time just a little so it was a tiny bit dry. But it was still sooooo good. I will be doing two next time.

What can I say that hasn't already been said about this recipe?  It really is delicious, even with tweaking the spices.  Didn't have thyme, cayenne or white pepper, so I used basil and lemon pepper along with the rest of the seasonings.  I used two 6 lb. roasters, and they turned out well.  Thumbs up from my hubby and sons, too.

WONDERFUL!! The house smelled heavenly while it was cooking.  The meat was very moist and the chicken fell off the bone.  I skipped the marinating in fridge and simply rubbed the spices in and left in the oven 5 hours.  So simple to make.

Great recipe.  It was a bit spicy for my kids, not too much - they still ate it up.  My husband loved it and said "it's the closest thing to Sam's Club rotisserie chicken.  It was so easy.  I rubbed the spices, refrigerated and then put it in the crockpot for 5-6 hours - PERFECT!  Thanks!

Extremely flavourful marinade, which penetrates the flesh. The flavour is rather "herby", but in a good savoury way. Use 1 to 1 1/2 tsp salt per chicken, depending on size. The recipe didn't call for any fat, but I rub butter/olive oil all over the chicken (under the skin too). You can put two pats of butter under the skin on each side of the breast if roasting breast-side up. Also, cover the wing tips and leg bones with some foil for the first 2 hours to prevent burning.

Delicious!!!!  And SO easy!  Only mistake I made was accidentally cooking them breast side down. DON'T do it, take the time to make sure you have the breasts up otherwise you end up with soggy skin on the breasts and nice, crispy, flavorful skin on the bottom!  Will make again and again and again. . .

I tied the chicken on a tripod made with sticks and cooked it over a campfire during a camping trip. the center wasn't cooked but I put it in foil and roasted it in coals. It came out ok. I made this another time but with an oven. It came out perfect and thanks for the recipe =P

This was delicious and qualifies as a "make ahead meal" where it needs to sit overnight and takes so long to bake.  I made it on one of my busy nights and came home to a delicious chicken dinner.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Much better than store bought.  Sounds time consuming but it is a breeze.  Even though it is juicy, I may try using an oven bag on the chicken.

I'm no longer afraid to roast a chicken! This was my first attempt at roasting a whole chicken. It turned out great. I had enough for two dinners. (The leftovers were added to fettucini alfredo.) A definite keeper

Alright, I did make a few changes. I added fresh rosemary, a few tablespoons of sliced butter and two boullion cubes to the inside of the bird.  I made my own seasoning mix, I used Cavenders Greek Saesoning (no one should be without this in their spice collection), poultry seasoning, onion and garlic powder and some cayanne.  I finished it off with some butter under the skin over the breast and drumsticks.  Probably not the healthiest bird, but OH MY GOD!  I gave this 5 stars because this is a great starting point for a PERFECT Chicken.  I used one 6lb bird and it only took a little over 4 hours to reach 180 degrees.  I turned the oven off and let it stay for about an hour until ready to eat.  This chicken was so tender it fell apart when we tried to cut it.  My husband has an aversion to chicken, (too much time in the Mid East and in the third world) but he raved about this.  I was left with a tremendous amount of liguid that I reduced for an excellent gravy with mashed potatoes.  I know this will be my method from now on.  The prep is pretty much the same as I used to do, but the low and slow cook time makes a huge difference.  Thanks Sue!

This is a wonderful recipe!  I have made it several times already for dinner parties and everyone has loved it.  I love to mix some of the seasoning with softened butter and rub it under the skin to get a delicious butter flavor in the breast!This last time, I took the drippings and refrigerated them, skimmed off the fat the next day, and made a wonderful wild rice, vegetable, and chicken soup out of the stock and leftover chicken.I added several cans of chicken broth to tone down the spicy flavor. Thanks so much for this recipe!

Wonderful & easy!!  I used 1 large (4lb) chicken & it worked out terrific.  Used leftover juices from cooking pan(after refridgerating & skimming off fat)& chicken to make a very rich & flavorful chicken soup.  This is a keeper!

Very easy recipe; it was a bit too salty so the next time I will cut down the salt.  I also added some garlic to the cavity in addition to the onion.  I also roasted some potatoes/onions seasoned with thyme, olive oil, garlic powder, and pepper.  I will definitely roast chicken this way from now on.

I didn't have any onions and I cooked it 3 hours at 300 degrees--and husband said it was the best chicken he ever had!  This recipe is extremely easy to make.   Next time I will use onions.  I don't think it really matters what temp/time you use for your preference in cooking as this chicken always ends up tasting great.  Next time I probably will do my normal chicken roasting temp/time of 375 degree for 1 1/2 hour.

My guest proclaimed this the best chicken she'd ever tasted, and I'm inclined to agree!  After an overnight berth in the fridge, the spices had penetrated the meat.  After four hours in the oven, the chicken was tender, juicy, and wonderful!  Even DH, who is not a huge chicken fan, was impressed.  I added some celery and garlic to the cavity, and used basil instead of thyme since that's all I had on hand.  This will become a Sunday regular.  Thanks!

This recipe is incredible!  The first time I made it I roasted it in the oven and everyone raved.  The second time I made it I roasted it in the gas grill and everyone nearly fell out of their chairs! I found that with my Weber grill having only the front and back burners on keeps the temp right at 250.  I didn't place it directly on the grill but had it in a roasting pan and set that on the grill.  Then I just closed the lid and forgot about it.  I basted it two or three times during cooking.  It only took a little over 4 hours to reach a 180-degree internal temp so be sure to check the temp occasionally after 4 hours so you don't overcook it. It was better than the rotisserie chickens we get at our grocery store.  Don't be afraid to try your own combination of herbs and seasonings either.  The key to this recipe is the cooking method.  It will come out fantastic no matter how you want to season it.  Thank you Sue!

This was very good and one four pound bird was enough to feed 8 at my house (with some side items)  I would recommend doubling the seasoning rub to really cover the bird inside and out.

Absolutely amazing. It's rare that we find a recipe in our house that everyone loves.  During the week I also make this by cooking in a preheated over @ 425 degrees for 30 min. then I drop the temperature to 400 degrees for an hour. Perfect every time.

I also put some sprigs of fresh rosemary inside the chicken with the cut up onion.  If you want gravy you will need to poured some chicken broth in the pan while cooking.  I've done both with and without and the result is extremely tender and flavorful!  Be sure to lift the skin and spread some of the spice mixture underneath.

This is the only way I will cook whole chickens from now on. I used all of the spice mixture on one 4-lb. chicken, and rubbed some of it under the skin. I put some red onion slices in the cavity instead of quartered onion because I had them leftover. As per an idea from a previous reviewer, I roasted it using the 'beer can' method. I poured half the beer into a square baking pan and stuffed the chicken onto the can of remaining beer, and stood it in the pan. I tented it with foil for the first 4 hours, and removed it for the last hour. I'm glad I cooked it this way because I couldn't believe how much grease had dripped down into the pan (sparing us the fat calories), yet the chicken was oh-so tender and flavorful all the way through.

I cooked one whole chicken.  I halved the ingredients, stirred them into just enough melted butter so that I could brush the mixture onto the chicken and I baked it.  I did not refrigerate first.  Very tender, my chicken and gravy were both yummy.  Thanks

Excellent.  Doesn't always take the full 5 hours to bake, check at 4 hours and every 15 minutes after that.

This was so amazingly easy to prepare and got rave reviews from my family!!  I cooked mine at 300 F for about 3 hrs with four cloves of garlic int he cavity. I couldn't believe how moist and tender the meat was without having basted it!!

While this chicken was realllly moist, it wasn't sticky or very flavorful.  Maybe if I had put the rub under the skin it might have had more flavor.  I marinated it over nite and I still don't think it was as good as a store-bought rotisserie chicken.

Fabulous! Fabulous! Fabulous!  I never ever roasted a whole chicken before and this was a great recipe for "testing the waters."  Going by past reviews, I doubled the recipe, as one batch is really only enough for one bird.  I also didn't let sit overnight because I made up my mind quickly to make it, but it was tasty all the same.  I had one bird for dinner, and the second one made sandwiches and salads during the week.  I did add a little water to the pan about 1/2 hour into cooking, and then basted it continually about every 20-30 minutes, which made it just beautiful.  I have since done a turkey breast with the same rub.  This one is definitely a keeper.  I have been recommending to everyone I know.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I don't think I'll ever do a whole chicken any other way.

this was really good!  i planned to make it on mother's day, however plans ended up getting screwed up, so i didn't get the chance.  so i had the chicken marinating for nearly a day and a half.  flavor was awesome!  also, since i was cooking it on a monday evening, i didn't have 5 hours to roast, so i cranked up the oven to 350 and roasted as i usually do.  served with some roasted red potatoes.  thanks for sharing sue!

I got this recipe from the newspaper 10 years ago- heaven forbid I ever lose it!  Over the years I've tried adding or deleting but I always go back to the original.  Sometimes I add a little chicken broth and quartered little red potatoes and mushrooms- and more onions.  I have found that basting a few times does make the chicken tastier. Unfortunately, there are never any leftovers!

Even though I previously tried and rated this recipe,I tried it again replacing the onion with orange quarter. The flavor is incredible!! Also we prefer marinating it overnight, as it takes on more flavors, also when I rubbed the chicken with the seasonings, I tried to rub underneath the skin directly onto the meat. Whatever you decide to use inside the cavity, it sure will steam through you chicken during baking and provide a flavorful moist chicken. Our family of 6 loves this recipe!!! Thanks Sue!

Where has this recipe been all my life.   This was the best chicken I have ever had.  Very moist.  Very flavorful.  Did not change a thing.   Glad I made two.  Excellent chicken leftovers.  Better than any rottisserie chicken I have tried.  This will now be how I make all my whole chickens.  Definitely worth investing the time in.

I have made this 4 times since I found the recipe.  I can't find 4# chickens, more like 5#.  I just do one, and it has been plenty with left-overs.  That size bird does need to cook longer, though.  We really like this, easy, tasty, and tender.  I will do again and again.

SUPER, SUPER tender, which was awesome.  However the seasonings were not good at all.  Way too much thyme, I think.  I will figure out tastier seasoning and use this cook time and temp next time.

Yup.  Fall off the bone, moist, and tender.  Really like the slow, low temp, long cook time, and it's easy enough to adjust the cook time for different sized birds.  Sometimes I add a little white wine and broth to the pan (don't pour over chicken) the last 1/2 hour or so for an easy pan sauce.  This really is quite good and hassle-free.

Superb. Kids went back for seconds and thirds. I used one six lb. young rooster, marinated it 24 hours, halved the seasoning. Moist beyond belief, it cooked in convection oven in three hours. Took the advice of several other reviewers and made gravy with the drippings by adding a tablespoon of butter and flour. Best gravy I've ever had. Will make again.

I made this for one 4 pound chicken and it was AWESOME! I cooked it for 3 1/2 hours @ 250 degrees and the skin was crispy and meat tender. I will make this again! Thank you for a great recipe!

Excellent recipe.  Thank you for sharing. I use chili powder in place of cayenne, double the garlic powder,  and add minced garlic under the chicken with the onions.  I use bone in and skin on chicken breasts and cook on 300 for about 1-1/2 to 2 hours.

This was amazing!!  I used one 3 pound chicken as I live alone and used my thermometer to let me know when it was done.  The only thing I altered was decreasing the salt a bit and added 1/2 lemon into cavity and a couple wedges of lemon under the skin on the breast.  I put carrots and potatoes on the bottom of the roasting pan and set the chicken on top of them.  I posted a picture of the finished product.  Soooo gooood!!

Delicious and easy! Roasted a 4 lb chicken for 4 hours until it reached 170. Perfection. I put lemon slices and five rosemary sprigs under the bird for more flavor. Made about 1.5 cups of gravy and I will make the bone broth another reviewer suggested. Worth the effort over a rotisserie chicken from grocery.

Very easy and delicious.  I used some Montreal Style chicken spice along with the stated ingredients (I don't do a review unless I can stick as closely as possible to the original recipe) and I got rave reviews.  Will definitely be making again.

This was absolutely delicious! I laughed at the person who said they could go to their local store and buy a rotisserie chicken for $3.99, I completely agree! However, I had a blast making my own rotisserie chicken at home. The only changes I made were, 1. I added a tablespoon or so of minced garlic inside the chicken along with the onion simply because my boyfriend and I love garlic. 2. Put pepper on the outside of the chickens prior to placing them in the oven, simply because we love pepper as well. 3. I took the advice from another rater and cooked the chickens breast side down for the first 2 1/2 hours. Definitely worth the effort if you like rotisserie chicken. I made a delicious chicken noodle soup the next day with the white meat (my BF does not like dark meat) and I snacked on the dark meat for the next 3 days. Thanks for sharing.

This was excellent!!!! Wish I could give this more than 5 stars!!!! Followed directions as instructed...I did however did not have  White Pepper to add but it certainly was not missed. I did add extra garlic to the recipe  ( inside the chicken cavity w/ the lemon- **cut in halves ** and onion ). The chicken roaster was about 7 lbs so it was cooked longer  for obvious reasons. When it was done, the chicken literally fell off the bone, the bones of the cavity  - honest to God - slipped right out!!!!!!!  Hands down the best moist chicken ever made. This is how I cook my Pot Roasts...very slowly, never needing a knife...I never had problems cooking delicious tender chicken ( chicken is my husbands favorite-so I'm always cooking him chicken- but this hands down was even better than my own. Did not get as sticky like restaurants but pretty darn close. I'm sure the next time I make this I'll have more success with that....For I Am Definitely Making This Again!!!!! I highly recommend this for everyone to try this method of cooking their chicken!!! 
THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS!!!! ??????????????
P.S FOR THE ONES WHO GAVE THIS A BAD REVIEW....I'M SORRY TO SAY THEY DID NOT FOLLOW THE RECIPE  EVEN THOUGH THEY SAID THEY DID AND CLAIMED IT WAS DRY AND NO FLAVOR etc...IF YOU HAD COOKED MEALS BEFORE IN YOUR OWN KITCHEN , THEN YOU KNOW HOW TO ADJUST THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR OVEN - ( MINE TENDS TO RUN VERY HIGH...SO I USE A LOWER TEMPERATURE THEN SUGGESTED ON SOME RECIPES ) -  AND ADJUST THE SPI

Ive made this in the oven several times and it was fabulous! Ive also made it in the crockpot and its my go to chicken dish! The juice it makes is rediculous and makes a helluva good gravy. So easy! Ive made it for family and they drool over it! Ive even put two whole chicken in the crockpot for a crowd. . Do yourself a favor and make it. If you put in crockpot i add. Arrots, celery, onions in the cavities or bottom of crockpot for extra flavor for the gravy.

This chicken was amazing! My whole family loved it. I made it as is, but I used a turkey cooking bag for easy clean-up.We don't eat the skin and I sliced the chicken prior to serving, so pretty crispy skin was not important. This is a great recipe!

I made this seasoning for a 4.25 lbs chicken and made it in a pressure cooker. It was great! I used 1.5 cups of chicken broth for my liquid and added some chopped garlic cloves. Next time I would reduce the white pepper by half.

Great recipe, but a little salty.  I make this often so I have quadrupled all seasonings except salt and then store in a small jar.  When I want to make, I already have all the seasons prepared and I just rub into chicken.

This chicken truly is fabulous! I did one chicken that was about 5 lbs. I mixed up the spices in a little dish and coated the chicken, even putting some under the skin on the breast sides. I double wrapped it in plastic wrap and refrigerated it overnight as per the instructions.  I   chose to use a 13x9 pan putting the chicken on one side on top of canning rings which I used to make a rack (4 wide mouth around 1 regular mouth size in the middle). On the other side of the pan I put potatoes and whole carrots. My chicken was done in the 5 hours and the potatoes and carrots were great. They were not overcooked at all. The chicken was moist, flavorful and practically melted in your mouth! Hubby loved it. The juice was delicious. I didn't make gravy but put it on the chicken as an au jus, but it really didn't need it. I plan to use the leftovers for soup with the pan drippings but I doubt I'll have any left after lunch today! Thanks Sue for this great recipe!

I made this for dinner tonight and it isn't as good as store rotisserie chicken...it's much, much BETTER!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was such a hit.  The skin was caramelized and the meat was fall-off-the-bone tender as oh so moist.  I used the rub from the recipe, and it was great.  I'm going to try a couple of different rubs I have in my recipe inventory like southwestern, oriental and Mexican for a variety of flavors.  The secret is in the roasting method...slow and  long.  It's the best method I've tried and I've tried many ways to prepare a chicken roast.  Try it, you won't regret it.

This was one of the best chicken recipes I've ever made.  The only change I made was to cut back a little on the cayenne. Can't handle spice! Makes for plenty for the freezer, too!

I would suggest not roasting a chicken at such a low heat for so long. Here is a response to a similar question on another cooking forum:

A few days ago I printed out a recipe from peacefulnightdove "BEST Slow-Roasted Chicken". It sounded wonderful but was to be roasted at 250 F (126 C) degrees for 5 hours. That sounded like a low temperature to me, so I emailed the County Nutritionist and Health Agent where I lived. Here is her reply: Good for you JoAnn to be suspicious! That is definitely outside the USDA guidelines, and yes bacteria may well be growing for quite a while in there. Poultry especially should not be done at less than 325 degrees. You could use the same spices and onions, increase the temp to 325 and decrease the time. Figure about 20 min per pound for the time. The safest way is to use a meat thermometer, final temp in the thigh should be 180 degrees.

Could someone please weigh in on how to do this with a turkey? Cook all night or....? Adjust hours by weight compared to chicken? The chicken recipe was great and those having problems should check their oven temps to ensure an oven thermometer matches their oven setting. It is not uncommon for ovens to be inaccurate and at this low temperature, 275, it could matter a great deal if the oven temp read as 275 but was really 325 or more. .

After talking to a BOston Market employee a long time ago, I used this spice mix with apple juice and marinated overnight. It was unbelievable moist and a great flavor. I used 2 cups of juice and the spices in a airtight zippered bag and it really worked nicely. Skin crisped as well too!

I'm sorry but this recipe was not very good. Unlike a lot of others on here, I followed the recipe exactly. First off it was way too spicy and secondly it didn't taste anything like rotisserie style chicken. This was a waste of time and ingredients. Next time I'll go get a store bought rotisserie chicken or stop by Boston Market instead.

The best thing about this chicken was how it smelled while cooking.  Followed the recipe ingredients exactly then marinated over night. The smell while roasting was to die for.  The chicken was completely cooked in the allotted time although the skin was not crispy.  Both my husband and I thought the flavor was ok but both the white and dark meat were mushy.  Nothing special and not as flavorful as the rotisserie chickens available at my local grovery store. We both prefer a traditional 350 degree roasted chicken to this recipe.

Seriously. Let me explain. My man doesn't eat rotisserie chicken. He thinks its slimy. (Store bought, or Boston Market) He won't eat it and therefore Ive never made one. I have missed it the last two years of our relationship. So last night, I went to Harris Teeter and picked up one bird, since theres only two of us, I thought two birds would be too much. I used ALL of the seasoning on one 4 lb bird, I was praying it wouldnt be too much but my guy likes his food very seasoned so I figured itd be ok.. I popped it in the oven on 275 and cooked it for 3 hours. When my babe came home that night, the whole house smelt delicious. He was staring at the chicken with disdain... I said try some white meat, he ate it and lordddd it was all worth it!!!! He kept commenting on how good it tasted, he kept complimenting my seasoning skills (hehe) I didn't get much meat off the little bird so I got a big one tonight for dinner (9 lbs)! Yeah! Im making it AGAIN!! And the gravyyyy sooooo good!!!  I put about half a cap of gravy master into a small pot with the drippings, added a table spoon of corn starch mixed with water and oila! Delicious delicious gravy!!! thank you so much for this recipe!

I am married to a beef loving husband, and have been trying to convert him into a chicken lover for 2 decades.  I've made this recipe several times following the most helpful reviews.  I've never marinated it for 24 hours , and it's always turned our delicious; it probably us more flavorful if marinated , I but you can't always plan ahead.  Today I added melted butter , approx 2 tablespoons, rubbing it under the skin of the breast and inside the cavity.   Then, I rubbed the breast, under the skin again and the cavity,  with the dry rub seasoning as per the directions .   I use a French style , cast iron cruset Iven roster I bought at Costco; it seals in the juices and nicely browns the bird also, baking at 250 degrees for 4 hours.  I truly think the French style oven roaster  makes it more flavorful.   This is the most delicious and juiciest chicken I've ever tasted.  My husband loves it !!!   It's such an easy and delicious meal, and is also beautiful enough for company, if you can find a large bird or cook 2 smaller birds.   You can't miss with this recipe !!!!

Didn't read it clearly enough, so didn't refrigerate it overnight, or let it bake for 5 hours.  Didn't use the cayenne pepper, and didn't have whole chickens, so I used leg quarters.  Mixed the seasonings, rubbed the leg quarters, put cut up onion in the pan with the chicken, along with several pats of butter.  Covered it with foil, baked it on 350 for about 3 hours, and it was fall apart DELICIOUS!!!

This was a great recipe.  DH and 2 kids (10/13) both liked it.  My only reservation is that it took so long in the oven (following the recipe) and the house really heated up.  Overall, the chicken was terrific...very comparable to Costco/Sams club chickens.

This chicken was so delicious and easy to make. I've been cooking for some time, but wanted to try my first whole chicken. To be honest, I was a little intimidated. It turned out amazing however. Fall off the bone delicious.

Since it was just my husband and I; I cut the recipe in half and made a single young free range chicken. I marinaded the chicken for almost a full 24 hours before placing it in the oven and the bake time was closer to just 4 hours, which was when it reached 179-180 internal temp almost to the minute. (It was just luck that I had checked the temp 10 minutes prior in anticipation with a faster cook time with a smaller chicken and realized it was almost done) If you plan to do the same, I highly recommend monitoring your bird to avoid drying it out. 

I also didn't have a roasting pan prior to making this, so I had to use baking dish and it turned out perfectly fine. I made sure to pour the juices over the chicken just prior to serving and it was divine.

Made this for christmas dinner a couple of years back, and it still my favourite roast chicken for when we have company!
I marinade and cook the chickens inside roasting bags, opening them for the last while, to crisp the skin.

This was an awesome recipe for my family on a Sunday evening. I have 6 to feed, so I used 2 4.5 chickens and cooked a little longer. Wonderful seasoning- I think I am going to take the advice of another user and make a lot of this seasoning mix and keep in a container so I can season chicken super quick in a rush and let it sit overnight. Overall great flavor and will continue making this

This is the best recipe for roast chicken ever!   I have made it several times and it is always juicy and succulent.  I've tried adding lemon and garlic to the cavity and always get raves.  Wonderful cooking method.  I've changed up the spices sometimes and it's always turned out great.  I'm using it for company again tomorrow because it allows me to focus attention on the other elements of the meal.  Thanks for a great recipe--my stand by!

This is the best roast chicken I've ever made. I followed recipe exactly.  The chicken sat in frig with spices overnight and i cooked starting in the early afternoon.  I think it only took four hours to cook, so use a meat thermometer to avoid overcooking.   So good, so easy.  I'll be adding this one to regular rotation.

I used chicken thighs, as it's what I had on hand. I only used 3 tsp of salt per other reviews...my family LOVED it! Certainly a keeper in my opinion! I also agree that you should make a large batch of this spice mix to have on hand at all times :)

I think this was pretty close, as close as I have tried, with exception that it was incredibly salty. I had to rinse off the chicken in order to eat it, and even then we couldn't eat it. The 'inside' chicken was flavorful, and I would try this again but using 1/4 or 1/3 of the salt -- we can always add salt later if need be, but I dont think it will. Other than that, I'm a fan of the actual flavor.

I made this for the first time today, I have to say this will be the only way I bake my chicken! It was tender, juicy and scrumptious. I forward the recipe to everyone I know who would enjoy it! I didn't modify a thing and husband lived it!

good spices..but easily adjustable for nay-sayers ;)  As for the complaints of too much salt, too dry etc, make sure you pay attention to how much the ingredient list is for.  For example this was for TWO 4 lb birds. Eight pounds of meat, so..just put on what you need.  I just roasted mine in a greased roasting pan like I would any other whole chicken.  COVERED at 350 for 1 hour, plus an additional 30 min. UNcovered so the skin will darken up.  easy and good

You will change your mind about the whole chicken with this recipe.  FANTASTIC flavor, the chicken turns out moist, flavorful and tender every time.  My whole family loves it and IF (that's a big if) there is any leftover you can bet that it will get devoured too!  Used them to make quesadillas, sandwiches etc.

I made this exactly as stated (minus the white pepper) and it was absolutely delicious! My Husband declared, "no one has ever made me a chicken this good!" The skin was crispy and the flavor was wonderful. The chicken was still juicy and moist although it had been in the oven for 5 hours. Slow is the way to go! 

I did make one change. The chickens were producing a lot of juice, so I drained that off 1.5 hours before the chicken was ready to come out of the oven. I was afraid that the bottoms of the chicken would get soggy if I left them in the pan with the chicken. That last hour and a half without excess juices really locked in the nice crispy crust!

P.S. I made a gravy with the pan juices and it was absolutely scrumptious! It was a tad salty, so if you plan on making a gravy with the juices I would suggest cutting the salt in the spice mixture to 2 or 3 tsp.

I have made this about 5 times now, and have recently eased up on the salt and cayenne a bit. Other than that, this recipe is a knock-out! I use this leftover meat for pot pie, chicken spaghetti, and delicious chicken salad. Situate your chicken on a rack so it's not sitting in the drippings, then use drippings to make an amazing gravy. Mmmmmm.

This was good.  I didn't add all the pepper, as my little kids wouldn't do the spice.  I used only the white pepper.  Both kids liked it.  Very tender and used leg quarters.

This is a great recipe. There is only my wife and myself so I cut the recipe in half. Followed it to the letter.  In my oven the chicken was done in 4 hours. The next time I make this I'll adjust the time. After I rubbed the seasonings inside and out I placed the chicken in a zip lock 1 gallon plastic bag and kept in in the fridge overnight, the flavors were great. I will definitely make chicken this way again.
I served it with fresh cooked broccoli with a cheese sauce.

This is a family favorite. So good! Don't be scared by the long cook time, with the low temperature, I've never had one come out dry. We usually do one larger chicken instead of the two smaller ones. The rub is wonderful, however it is a little on the salty side, so if you're sensitive to that, just cut it back some. Love this recipe!!

I make this chicken almost weekly.  It is bar far THEE best roasted whole chicken recipe!  My husband and sons and I love it!  I do not "marinate" it, (just never make the time) but it turns out great!  There is just the 4 of us so I only cook 1 chicken, so therefore I half the ingredients for the dry rub.  I shake the rub all over, inside & out, under the breast skin.  I use 1-2 onions in the cavity...I think that adds to the amount of juice/gravy at the end.  I always make it with mashed potatoes.  I usually end up boiling everything that's leftover to make chicken broth/stock.

The best chicken recipe there is! No changes needed to it at all. I had to make six chickens for my wedding rehearsal dinner. To make the spice measurements easier, I adjusted the serving quantity to 24, put the rub in a shaker, and went to town on the bad boy! Any  leftover seasoning was perfect for later use to spice up the everyday dish. Kudos, Sue!

As Tina Turner said "simply the best!" Extremely easy and so delicious! First time making it I didn't notice the rub measurements were for 2 birds, oops. Next time I halved the recipe but do prefer it doubled.

Easily adaptable to a single larger bird instead of 2. The whole family loved it and went back for seconds!

I love love this recipe.  I made this dish for a party where a lot of other food was served, including another chicken dish.  I made a large portion of this, and all of it went.  It was the first dish to be finished off.  It's a real crowd pleaser, and my kids like it too!! For me that's a win-win.  Thanks for sharing.

Made this for Christmas dinner. It was very good, but a little tad on the dry side. I think that is my fault because I did not let it sit for the 10 minutes. But will make again very soon...

These are like better versions of grocery store rotisserie chickens.  The rub is great.   I didn't marinate overnight like the recipe calls for, and they still turned out fantastic.  My whole family loves them.  I use the leftover bones and skin to make crock-pot stock.

I've been using this recipe for a few years now. Never needed to change it. It's beautiful. This is the chicken I make when I want to impress a guest. I keep a jar of the seasoning blend mixed up in my spice rack. It is awesome.

flavors are extremely good; i marinated one whole chicken for 2 1/2 hours, cooked on 300 for 2 hours; juicy, tender and extremely good. i used recipe exact for one chicken, but i suggest doubling this recipe for 2 chickens.

I have made this recipe at least a dozen times and shared it with everyone i could think of.  For the first few times i followed the exact recipe with the exception of the white pepper - something i just didn't have and never buy.  The last few times i have still followed the ingrediant list minus the white pepper, but only "marinated" the chickens for a couple of hours and then baked with a lid on at 350 for 1 1/2-2 hrs.  I started this short cut version when i forgot to take the ckns out in advance but still wanted the flavors.  Also i don't eat the skin so i don't mind that it tends to end up not crispy - trying to eat a bit healthier.  It works though the rub tends to sit a bit thick on the ckns, which is more than i like...but its worth it for the flavor!!

I love this spice mixture!  It has become my go-to spice, particularly for poultry, ever since I found this recipe.  I make up a whole jar of it and just keep it in my spice cupboard :)

This is a great way to prepare tasty chickens. Followed the recipe exactly, my chickens were a little smaller at 3.5 and 4 lbs, they were done to 185* after 4 hours. The meagre leftovers were picked clean for sandwiches the next day, and I've just thrown the carcass and bones in a pot for broth. Worth a try!

As expected, when you have a recipe that has this many positive reviews, it has got to be good. Kids LOVED it as did grownups. Two thoughts: Double the spices and use lots. Watch the chicken as it nears the last hour. You  may not need it. While some of the chicken was falling off the bone delicious, some areas were a bit dried out. When I make it again I will definitely cook this for about an hour less than the recipe indicated.

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly as stated accept I used a 7.15 bird instead of two small birds. I rubbed the chicken with the spices and coated two small onions with the left over seasoning and stuffed them inside the bird with 3 tbsp minced garlic. I wrapped in plastic wrap and let it marinate over night. I had the mr. Pop it in the oven around 2:30 and it was done by the time I got home at 6:45 (a little overdone. Meat thermometer read 180 but the chicken was not dry AT ALL). Like others, I added a slurry mix to the rendered juices with chicken stock and it made a fabulous gravy. I can't wait to make this again. Would be perfect for dinner when you have people visiting because the recipe is not very involved but soo delicious.

I made this as written: marinated  over night and baked for the whole 5 hrs. Really really good, moist and flavorful. My man said "better than store bought" and it really was. I baked this in my Le Creuset Dutch oven (lid off) and let the chicken rest while I made the gravy (which was really good and spicy)  right in the pot. May start doing this every Sunday during the Winter as the left overs were super juicy and easily encorporated into other meals during the week. Thanks for the 5 hr roasting  idea. BTW this is NOT sticky...nothing to carmelize so if that's what you're wanting this isn't that.

Although the chicken was moist and perfectly cooked, I could have purchased a chicken at Costco/Sam's and been just as happy.  It smelled awesome while cooking, but it was not as flavorful as I had hoped.  Recipe was followed exactly as written.

OMG, ok, this is the way to make chicken.  I didn't cover the chicken and let it sit in the fridge for 4-6 hours.  It turned out just fine without that step.  I'm making chicken like this from now on.  Just took a few bites and the meat just melts in your mouth and the flavor is perfect. Thank you, Sue! This recipe is just awesome!  Plus, it now smells like Thanksgiving at my house.

This was amazing! Made it for a small group of family for thanksgiving rather than a turkey. Everyone raved about it. I put on the rub and left it over night, so tender, fell off the bones while carving! Will make again for sure. Have already given the recipe to others!

If you are looking for a chicken recipe to make for dinner -STOP LOOKING! I don't remember the last time I made chicken that I enjoyed this much! I didn't marinate overnight and I used split chicken breasts. I cooked in a 350 degree oven. I did not add the cayenne pepper because I didn't have it . Otherwise I followed recipe. Im not  a pepper person so I thought this recipe would not work for me. But, it was AMAZING. Thanks Sue for sharing this recipe!

Love this! I haven't tried using whole birds. We just used bone-in legs and thighs, and the meat is juicy and tender with a slight crispy skin. Yummy! Do not use boneless and skinless because they will dry out.

I have made this recipe several times! We all enjoy it!  I love to make two chickens just to have leftovers, and always make a yummy gravy from the drippings! Delicious with mashed potatoes!

This was really good chicken. I followed other reviewers advice and only cooked it for just over 3 hours and it turned out really moist and delicious. The only reason why I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 was that it didn't really mimic the rotisserie chicken you get at grocery stores and restaurants - delicious, yes, but rotisserie, no. I will be making this a lot more though!

Very moist, easy and full of flavor.  Only downside is that it has a kick to it...a little too spicy for my toddler, so I had to avoid the skin with her.  Also...wish there was something to do in this recipe with the left over juices!  I plan to freeze mine and us them as a spicy "broth."

I typically never right reviews, But this chicken seasoning recipe is AMAZING! I went ahead after making it twice and deciding I loved it, to take a mason jar and make the recipe x's 12 so that I have a bunch of seasoning made to make dinner multiple times a week without having to measure out all the time. I also feel this is only enough seasoning for one chicken. Not 2. I like to taste the seasoning, not just hint the chicken with it. The drippings in the pan are so YUMMY!!!

Just mixing the spices will transport you to restaurant that's famous for this style of chicken! The flavor is worth the wait required for the marinate.

Easy and excellent. The breast meat was very moist. All the meat just fell off the bone. I've been asked to repeat this recipe often in the future.

I made this to the exact instructions only we put our two chickens on rotisserie in the BBQ.  Best tasting, looking and smelling chicken we have ever had.  Never have prepared chicken in this way before and will be doing it again very soon.  The extra chicken served for several other meals this weak and was so tasty as leftovers too.

I have made this several times and it tastes simply fantastic.  The first time I made it I didn't have thyme so I subbed rosemary.  It was great.  Later I bought thyme just to make this recipe, but even though I did try it, I liked the rosemary better.  This works for me without being dry.  My 6 children stand around snitching bites while I cut this up.  This recipe is a total winner at my house!

If you think this recipe is good, try the same spices rubbed on chicken pieces and cooked in a rotisserie basket.  Absolutely the most delicious chicken I've ever had and nice crispy outer skin.

Family loved it. It's juicy, tender and flavorful. One thing I changed, was to turn up the heat in the end and let it get done just a bit faster.

Only changes I made were using smoked paprika, definitely use white pepper (it's different than black pepper flavor and really adds) also used fresh garlic in marinading it overnight, instead of powdered. Excellent chicken, family loves it.

I raise my own chickens, and they run around all over.  When we have too many roosters they end up chilling in the freezer.  Because they run around and because they can be older birds, I usually stew them or make soup.  I roasted three of them today using this recipe.  ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!!  Tender and wonderful!  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!

True rotisserie chicken taste!  I chose to use pieces, as another cook suggested.  I marinated them overnight and cooked them covered with foil for 1 hour at 300, then uncovered for 30 minutes.  They were a feast for the nose and eyes!  I attempted to make gravy and for the first time ever I was successful!  It was so incredibly easy and I didn't have to season it or anything.  We served it with mashed potatoes and asparagus.  Really, really good.  I have to agree with another comment that I think its the cooking method, not the seasonings that make all the difference.  My husband has already asked me to make it again!  Thanks for the amazing recipe!

Made this three times now and its awesome.  This time I forgot about putting the seasonings on and letting it sit and it turned out the best yet.  I used 1 4.5 lb chicken and halved the seasoning recipe.  I put it all over the whole bird and under the skin of the breast as well as in the cavity.  Only got about half an onion inside of it.  This truly is fall off the bone tender as well juicier than any chicken I have made in the past.

This was amazingly moist, and the smell was heavenly. The skin was crackling crisp, so the last-minute baste before serving was a really good suggestion, and not just for looks. I put some carrots and potatoes in the bottom of the roasting pan, and the family loved them, too. I do think I will use less salt and more garlic next time. Made some stock with the bones and onions, and it smelled terrific, too.

This is my first attempted of making any whole chicken. It came out really juicy and tender fell right off the bone, which is how me and my family like it. The only think I did different was I double the rub and I put one garlic clover under the skin of the chicken on each side.

I made half of this seasoning blend for one 4+ lb. whole chicken.  I did, however, cut the salt back even further to 1/2 t.  I first put a thin coating of olive oil all over the outside of the chicken and then seasoned it inside and out using all of the seasoning.  We decided to grill this and at a much higher temperature than called for in this recipe.  We maintained a temperature of about 425 degrees and this was done in just about one hour.  So my 5-stars is for the seasoning blend only.  Very good!

My entire family love this dish, my oldest daughter has now taught her husband (who is not a cook) how to create this dish that we have fallen in love with. The soaking over night is very very important for the taste and you might be worried about the large amount of seasoning but don't it is perfect.

My family loved it! The rub was easy to make. I didn't use the white pepper either, like one of the reviewers said: who has that? I ended up wrapping 2 whole roasters with plastic wrap overnight and cooked it at a bit higher temp when I got home from school around 1 pm. I knew my kids needed to eat by 5 pm. I cooked it for 4 hrs on 265. It did reach 180 F. I have 4 teens and they love chicken, whole especially! I made gravy out of the drippings. Cooked rice in a rice cooker and served with some petite peas. Great family meal!

We LOVE this recipe!  My daughter gets excited when she knows we are roasting a chicken for several reasons.  It's delicious the night we cook it and then later I will pick off what's left and freeze it, the drippings and the striped carcass for soup later.  I boil the bones till they are powdery and then discard leaving behind a wonderful base.  She raves about it.  Make sure you let the spice rub marinate over night!  It makes a HUGE difference.  I once was in a hurry and it only got an hour, same daughter looked at me and said "It was OK....  it's normally awesome!!! What did we do wrong?!"  I've even tweaked it by adding some other spices before but nothing beats the original in my opinion.

I have made this so many times and it is perfect, and even my grown boy's will sit in the kitchen waiting for this to come out of the oven.  That is how good it makes our house smell.

No need to change a thing because you can not improve on perfection!

LOVE this chicken recipe.  I followed the recipe as stated, and it was a little salty for my taste.  But, it was moist and tender.  I have made it several times, and it's great every time.

This recipe is legit. Be easy with the paprika, too much of it can really over power the dish. I am a little more heavy handed with the onion powder but I made this to my taste. Good recipe.

I will NEVER roast a chicken a different way.  As with some other folks, I don't always have white pepper, and often add minced garlic in the cavity.  That doesn't change the flavor of the chicken.  I personally believe drying the chicken and using it as a dry rub overnight makes a big difference, as does the slow roast.  I didn't have to adjust the temp to brown the outside...it was like a rotisserie...set it and forget it.  The smell is heavenly and my friends have all asked for the dry rub.  Have fun making Sunday dinner again!

I have mixed this rub up so often, I think the spices can practically mix themselves. The chickens always come out so moist and flavorful and the carcass makes awesome soups. It's also a nice combination to add into gravies or stuffing.

excellent flavor - this mix of spices is incredible.  I love dark meat and next time instead of buying a whole chicken, I am just going to use legs and thighs and use this spice mix all over them.  Yum!

This was my first recipe I tried from Allrecipes.  The spice rub was delicious, although very expense to purchase all the spices.  I never cook a chicken at that low of a temperature, I cheated a raise it to 350 the last 45 minutes.  The chicken was moist and falling off the bone, the seasoning was good, I think the next time I will use just a bit more seasoning to fit my taste.  I highly recommend this recipes.  I did not use the white pepper, the cost was to high. - msaglover

Hands down the best chicken I've ever cooked.  I didn't have enough time to cook, so followed the advice of another review, and cooked a little higher (@450) for about 10 - 15 minutes, then dropped it down to 350 for a couple of hours, and it was perfectly cooked, and still very juicy.  Even my very picky 3 yr old gobbled it up with a "it's yummy!!!".  This blend of spices is incredible.  I already plan on using it for several other dishes.  It would make an awesome batch of wings. The only negative I have about this recipe is that it is too salty as is, and this is coming from a salt-aholic.  I'd recommend cutting the amount of salt in half.  You'll still get plenty of the flavor, without overdoing it.

Didn't change a thing.  My kids said it was the best chicken I ever made.  Served with mashed potatoes, gravy made from pan juices, maple glazed carrots and sautéed hungarian sweet and sour red cabbage.

Very very good.  I made it exact as the recipe called for... and although enjoyed it very much would make alterations based on personal preferences.  For instance, I would do less onion and less cayenne.  Our family will be making this again, and again!

I just made this using the spices EXACTLY as written and it is awesome!  I made the chicken in my George Foreman Rotisserie instead of the oven and it is better than the roasted chickens I usually buy at the store.  I changed the serving size to 48 so the spices came out in cups and tablespoons and mixed it up to keep in my spice cabinet.  I got a deal on chickens this week and bought 4.  I plan on using this recipe on the other 3 in the smoker this weekend.

This was another hit! Every one's oven is different so make sure you watch so chicken doesnt dry out.  I had everything but white pepper other than that I followed the recipes exactly! Used the leftover chicken for sandwiches the next night. My boys devoured!

This was absolutely fantastic!  My husband asked me to make again for the 2nd time in 3 days and he doesn't usually want a repeated meal that fast.  Only thing I did different was substituted rosemary for the thyme due to not having any.  Also... I made plain white rice to go with it and used about 2 latle fulls of the pan drippings to flavor it and the rice was great!  Do not overlook this recipe and thank you Sue for submitting!

Followed the dry rub recipe exactly!  Put the rub on bone-in chicken breasts and set in the frig overnight.  Started roasting a bit late for dinner, so I used the convection setting at 325 for 90 minutes.  They were moist and so delicious.  Like another reviewer, my son also said that this was the best chicken I ever made...and I've made a lot of chicken!  Keeping this forever!

Wow This was excellent.  I did change the recipe a bit, as my ovens theromastat is off, so I did it in my slow cooker.  I took 4 large chicken breast with bone in.  Marinated overnight with the rub from this recipe.  Sliced red potatoes and lots of onion and put on the bottom of the cooker.  I added 1/2 cup of chicken broth, then laid the chicken breasts on top of that mixture,and set it on low for 5 1/2 hours.  Turned it once, and when it hit 180* if was done.  Took it out to cool, then strained the potatoes and onions in a small dish and put in the oven on a warm heat.  Took all of the broth and drippings from the cooker added some flour and wisked.  Pulled the chicken apart, and it was done perfect Spooned some of the gravy over the chicken and onion/potatoes. My hubby had two helpings and loved it.  For me I had a mixed green salad with avocado, grape tomatoes, homemade croutons, and a simple ceasar dressing from this recipe site.  Tossed it with the chicken and had a wonderful healthy dinner for me.

This came out great!  I messed up the spice rub a little by forgetting to half everything so some things had two chickens worth and some had only one.  I rotated the chicken in the oven once an hour so it would cook evenly.  Five hours was perfect for the 4.25 lb bird.  I did make gravy out of the drippings but should have de-fatted them first.  Leftovers tonight!

This chicken is the bomb!!! I have two grandsons who are on gluten free diets so I made this for part of our Christmas dinner with a turkey. (I made stuffing separate) I also put the spices under the skin but I put no water in the pan and left it open and cooked it slowly. It was the hit of the party everyone loved it! Thank you for sharing.

I used one 6 lb chicken and my ninja cooker. I browned the bird first and then slow roasted at 250. The temp of the bird at 3 hrs was 202 degrees. The drippings burnt and the breast meat was a bit dry. Dark meat was moist, falling off the bone and delicious. I will definitely try again paying closer attention to the temperature of the meat as it cooks.

I have made this before, and it is good.  I added a bay to the cavity.  My problem is my stove is electric and I don't like to use the stove for 5 hours to run up my electric bill.  Sounds petty I know, but I cut corners wherever I can.  When I had a gas stove it was so much cheaper!  I do miss my gas stove:(

I was too salty (from someone who is known to re-salt everything) but still pretty good. I rubbed the chicken with olive oil before using the seasoning and flipped it 2-3 times during cooking. Next time I'll use half the salt, and I will baste the chicken instead of flipping it; probably basting will actually make it sticky.

This recipe waws fantastic, a huge hit! The only spice I did not have was the white pepper; however it still turned out great. I used a 7= pound roaster and after i rubbed the spices allover the chicken inside and out, I wrapped it in saran wrap extremely air tight, and was supposed to have it for dinner the next night, but something came up, so the chicken actually marinated on the dry rub for 48 hours, and was still delicious and juicy! Such great flavor, i will use this recipe a lot

I have seen others rave about this recipe for years, and I've never tried it. Blame it on being stuck in my ways, hooked on my old chicken recipe. Well, when my sons saw the old bird sitting in the fridge, they groaned, "Not chicken again!" So I decided I better change things up a bit. I tweaked the cooking method slightly, but I prepared the chicken with all the spices exactly as called for. Instead of roasting this in my oven, I placed it on a beer can filled with 6 oz of chicken broth and some spices and I roasted it on 50% power for 4 hours in my NuWave infrared oven. THIS WAS SO GOOD! It did come out just a tad spicy, but it was just the best flavor. Everyone loved it. The next day I boiled what was left of the carcass and made an amazing pot of chicken noodle of soup. I'm so glad I finally tried this one.

I only baked one chicken. I didn't have time to marinate for 4 hours overnight, but it came out jut fine. I used all ingredients except for onion powder and cayenne pepper because I didn't have them. I also baked the chicken with the breast side down. Bake time was for 4 hours at 250 degrees uncovered. I will be making this again!

Just made this for my family tonight.  I used one 5lb roaster chicken and it took close to the full 5 hours to cook. It was extremely juicy. My mistake only was to cut the dry rub ingredients in 1/2, I should have used the full amount. Not that it was tasteless but it could have used a lot more flavor. Will definitely be making this again. Oh, and I have quite a bit of left overs...yummy!!!

Wow!!!!!!! I couldn't stop snacking on it while it was cooking.  It was sooo good!!!!! A little salty for my tastebuds, but after a taste, you cannot stop eating it.  I used a rotisserie oven and I think my chicken was 4 lbs. I increased the garlic to 1 tsp and used a turkey bag to cover the chicken, after I got all the air out of the bag.

I didn't pay attention to the preparation time when I added this to my menu. I had already thawed the chicken and didn't have time to change it, so, I mixed the spices, cutting the salt some, coated the chicken & baked it at 350 for 1 & 1/2 hours or so. It was delicious!! I will make sure I have enough time next time, but even with a short amount of time, it was still great!!

this recipe was such a disappointment.  the chicken was bone dry and flavorless.  My guess is that all of the flavor and juiciness was in the plethora of liquid in the bottom of the pan that accumulated during cooking.

This was horribly dry and uneatable. I followed the instructions exactly.  Perhaps if it were cooked less it would be okay but, I'm not giving it another chance.

This was a fabulous chicken that everyone loved. I did double the seasoning (because we really like robust flavor), but I am sure it is 5 stars with the lesser seasoning as well. Will make many times over and have emailed the recipe to my sister.

My boyfriend and I really like this recipe and have made it a few times now. The first time the leg meat was super moist and delicious but the breast meat was pretty dry. The second time I took it out of the oven a few times and basted it with the liquid from the bottom of the pan, which definitely cut back on the dryness. I also add way more of the seasoning mix than called for because it tastes so good!

This was easily the best chicken I have ever made, by ten fold.  I followed the recipe to the T aside from the whole onion (I used half an onion) and I couldn't stop eating it.  I have a 7 quart dutch oven with trivet that I cooked it in without the lid on.  I was afraid it would get dry, but it was still very moist and flavorful.  I am already looking forward to making this again.

Great recipe ! I cooked this chicken and had a nice salad to match and was in heaven. I threw in a dash of olive oil, just to help it brown more and couldn't be happier. Good recipe for those who want restaurant style chicken at a home price ! Enjoy !

So so very very good. I didn't have a chance to marinate it over night in the spices, or manage my time to slow cook it.  But that didn't matter.  It was still WOW! And you know what's better?  The soup I made out of the stock.  After removing what little meat was on the carcass, I threw in everything.  Skin, bones all of it.  And the spices on the skin made my stock all that MORE better! 
Next time, and there will be many more next times, I will marinate and slow cook it as the recipe states.  I can't imagine it being any better!

This is a great recipe. My boyfriend who is a really picky eater said it was the best chicken skin he has ever tasted. Such a great comment coming from him. The chicken was moist even after over cooking it(my accident). I followed the recipe except I had no white pepper and I added garlic with the onions. I will definitely make it again

It was very easy and came out tender and flavorful.  But wasn't what the title implied.  Maybe add some water to the bottom of the pan to get some more juices.

I usually make this with one good sized chicken (5-7lbs). This rub is divine, but you really to have to let it sit for at least 8-10 hours for the full effect.

Absolutely Fabulous! I had a 7 1/2 lb. chicken so I only made one. I thought it would take longer than the recipe called for, but was done in 5 hours. I refrigerated it until dinner time, then microwaved for 5 minutes (in juice) then brushed the skin with melted butter and finished it off for 15 minutes in a 400 degree oven. This was SO much better than anything I could buy. Totally worth the little bit of planning and effort it took.

The slow cooking is what makes this recipe perfect. Basically i used what i had on the shelve which dint include cayenne pepper and black pepper so i substituted with red pepper. I also added a bouillon cube for extra spice and rubbed the spice beneath the skin. The result was a moist delicious chicken.

I made this for a party the other day. It turned out unbelievably juicy and tender. I decreased the amount of paprika and cayenne pepper, fearing it might be too spicy, which was a mistake, it would have been more flavorful if I'd used the recommended amount.

This is definitely my favorite recipe for roast chicken! I have made it 3 times now and every time it has come out moist and perfect! It only took about 3 1/2 hours for mine to be cooked through...definitely watch it and make sure to not over cook it. The seasoning is perfect! I have tried it with and without white pepper and it was delicious either way. Also I did what another reviewer said and rolled a couple pats of butter in the seasoning and put them under the skin on the breasts...sooooo yummy!

AMAZING! Oh, so good! My mods: I used 2-1/2 teaspoons salt, and I dredged four pats of butter in the spice mixture and pushed the spice-covered pats under the skin at various places over the breast and down into the thighs. This was, of course, in addition to rubbing the spice all over the bird. I did baste a little toward the end. The pan drippings were delicious in gravy, too. I used this same recipe for my thanksgiving turkey with adjusted times, etc. It was also fantastic!

Excellent mix of spices. Followed exactly the first time, absolutely superb. Craving that flavor again, just used two chicken breasts covered them with the spice mixture then wrapped each with two slices of bacon for moisture. Cooked about 2 1/2 hours at 275 - delish!

I was hoping this would be a new go-to recipe, but it was rather bland. It was so easy, and the chicken was moist.  I love the cooking method, but will look for another recipe that imparts more flavor.  On the upside, the leftover chicken was perfect for quesadillas and salads later in the week.

Went to make this two days ago, and realized too late that I had to let it sit for 4 hours before sticking it in the oven.  That should be noted on prep time, a little misleading.  I cooked it last night and it turned out really good. Not too dry and the onion gives it a great flavor.

this is GREAT!  I'll make this again, but next time will cut back on the salt. I had one 6 pound chicken - followed the recipe given.  It took 5 hours to cook and the house smelled great all day.  It wasn't very sticky though - not sure why, but it was still good.  SO EASY!  Thanks for the suggestions on making the gravy too -- good addition.

This was awesome! I only gave 4 stars because I tweaked it slightly. I used smoked paprika, and chipotle pepper in place of the paprika and cayenne. I did not have white pepper so I increased the black pepper to about 1 tsp. The chickens were cooked on the BBQ rotisserie. A big hit with everyone. Definately a keeper!

Tasty seasoning; however, 5 hours in the oven is too long.  The chicken was a bit dry.

I made this yesterday with two 7 lb. chickens and even though they were larger than the 3 to 4 lbs. called for, they were both ready in 5 hours, give or take 10 minutes on one of them..very moist!

Seriously the best, most moist roast I've ever made.  I only one chicken but got a roasting chicken that weighed about 7lbs.  Cooked perfectly in about 3 1/2 hours.  Took it out at 175 degrees to avoided drying out.  Used the drippings to make gravy, the left over meat in a casserole and made chicken tortilla soup with the carcass, making this a 3 meal chicken!

Thanks for a terrific recipe!  It tastes and looks beautiful, making a great impression on our guests.  I did cook this in an indoor rotisserie at 20 minutes per pound, which yielded such a moist, juicy chicken!  The second time I made this, I rubbed the spice mixture under the skin, which flavored the meat a little more intensely.  Great recipe!

Phenomenal! In fact, I just made it (again) last night! I LOVE this recipe and best of all so does my husband!!!  It's very simple and easy to improvise or add to the spices depending on your taste/mood.  Saying that, this is one of the very few that I don't add to or change a whole lot it's THAT good.

It was OK, but not worth the time for me. Other roast chicken recipes have delivered similar results without having to sit for several hours and with shorter roasting time.

Actually this is a question.  The directions say to put "in" a roasting pan.  So I am now assuming that means covered.  Since it did not say "covered" i ended up cooking mine on a roasting pan for about 3 hours.  So now it is in a covered pan.  Any other comments on this would be appreciated.  I can't give 5 stars since we have not eaten it and the directions were not specific enough.

I combined the seasoning part of this recipe (minus white pepper since I was out of it) to add as a chicken rub but combined it with the beer butt chicken recipe that I also found here. I rubbed my chicken with a little oil then put the rub to the chicken inside and out. I did not refriderate.  I put in on a half can of beer and baked in the oven on 350 degrees for three hours. The chicken was so moist and juicy, when it stuck therometer into chicken, juice was oozing out. My husband was eating it and  was already planning the next time we would cook it.  I also took the drippings and made brown gravy that I also found the video also on this website and my little boy raved about it since I usually use a packet.  I will be cooking this recipe again soon.

I followed this recipe to the letter, and it's so very disapointing.  the white meat was dry, the skin was like leather and need much more salt.  I don't see the need to cook it so low and slow because it tasted just like regular roasted chicken.

Super easy and super tasty. I have used this recipe for years and my family always asks for seconds. The leftover chicken makes awesome sandwiches or chicken salad as the chicken soaks up the marinade and is very tender. A definite keeper!

I've made this 3 times now, and it's been delicious every time.  I've mostly followed the ingredients except for white pepper, which I don't have, and I cut the cayenne in half because we don't like spicy.  I keep meaning to follow the cooking directions exactly, but I never give myself enough time.  I end up cooking it in my dutch oven for 90 minutes at 400F.  I just cook one chicken (change servings to 4).  It turns out so moist and delicious, and I love the seasoning. Some day I vow to follow the cooking directions!

Wonderful spice mix and cooking method.  Yielded a tender, moist bird, which was extremely flavorful.  I did modify the spice mixture very slightly.  Halved the amount of salt by choice, and halved the amount of cayenne by necessity because we ran out. :)  I also cut a couple pats of butter and rolled them in the spice mixture and pushed them under the skin on the breast (one pat per side) so that some of the flavor would be sure to get under the skin.  I'm making this again for our dinner tonight, and I can't wait!

LOVE this recipe!  I also stuff the cavity with an onion and celery before I season and let it sit overnight. I leave it in while it bakes as well.  You will not find a better roast chicken recipe then this one!

I've had this recipe for years although I got mine from a church cook book.  Anyway, this is the only way to roast a whole chicken.  My family loves it!  The 250 degree oven and the spices are key!  Don't try to speed up the cooking time by having a hotter oven.  You'll love this cooked slowly and the house smells AMAZING.  Much, much better than a store bought rotisserie.  When you make two on a weekend, you have lots of extra chicken for other great recipes during the week.

We have made this at least 6 times now and we always love it. First a sit-down dinner with mashed potatoes and veggies, then on sandwiches or on a salad. my kids like to shred it, add bbq sauce and put on a bun. The almost 6 pound chicken I took out at 3pm yesterday is almost gone:)

This was excellent.  Would definately make again.  The only thing I changed was I left out the white pepper because I didn't have any.  I also added some apple juice to the bottom of the pan.  Made a great gravy with the drippings in it.  Also basted the chickens as they cooked. I cooked 350 for 30 minutes per lb.

Delicious chicken recipe. I use it for my Ronco Rotisserie, and it comes out with just the right amount of lick-it-off-your-fingers stickiness.

I brined my 5lb single chicken with "Simple Chicken Brine" by Jay from this site for five hours (added garlic/onion powder and 4 bay leaves) Patted dry with paper towels then rubbed butter on skin and under where I could fit it. Used this recipe for the seasoning rub (reduced cayenne by half for health  reasons). Placed chicken atop cut-up potatoes, onion, 2 garlic cloves, baby carrots and zucchini drizzled with olive oil and salt/pepper. SOOOOOOOOOOO good!!! Will definitely use this seasoning mixture again!!!!

Followed exactly (minus the white pepper and only 1 chicken). It came out great! I was a little skeptical about the 250 baking temp. However, it made the chicken so tender! I baked my one 4lb chicken for 4 hours. I will definitely be making this again. It is much better (and cheaper) than buying the roasted chicken at the grocery store.

This was good. I made only two changes based on what was in my Pantry, i did not have any white pepper, (i looked at two different supermarkets, only becacause i have seen it in more and more recpies lately and am curious to see what or if their is a need for special pepper .) I also could not find my cayanne pepper, but i did have some dried ground Ancho Chile Powder. I also used I 6 lb chicken instead of two 
The flavor was great the thyme very faint, almost  an after taste. next time i may put in a little extra. Will make again.(with white pepper! If i can find the stuff.)

Excellent!  I don't bother with the pre-rubbing.  I just rub it before I put it in the oven and that seems perfect.  Unless your a major salt fan, I would omit it completely as it is very salty even with out it.  Makes a moist delicious chicken!

Moist and delicious with a crispy skin (I don't eat the skin, but it sure did look good!).  Also it was easy.  I served with rice pilaf, fresh mixed vegetables (broccoli, carrots, zucchini and yellow squash) sauteed and quick steamed and baked sweet potato.

Unbelievably juicy, moist, and soft chicken. The onion in the cavity is the key, you can experiment with the spice rub (as I did a little) and still get great results if you place onion and/or garlic in the chicken's cavity. Mine cooked in 4 hrs 30 min. Will be making this often!

This is my go to recipe for roasted chicken. Recipe is perfect the way it is. I usually have to shorten the cook time, though, because the chickens are usually smaller than 4 pounds.

Okay Im givig this 5 stars though mine had too much pepper, but that was my fault.  I decided one chicken was enough for my family, but had already made the seasoning.   Also I didn't have white pepper so I substitued about half the amount for black pepper as suggested on line.   Anyway I used more of the rub then half on one chicken and the black pepper.  HOWEVER the chicken was AWESOME.  My husband though I had gone out and gotten a Rotisserie.   He was really impressed.

This is the only recipe I'll ever need for rotisserie-style chicken. It is perfect. I forgot to take the onion pieces out of the cavity before I refrigerated it, so the leftovers were a bit "oniony", but I tried adding the onions with a regular roast chicken and I swear it came out juicier.

Fantastic recipe, I followed as directed, rubbed the chicken allowed to sit over night refrigerated then grilled the next day.  Makes a great chicken, and tastes even better the day after cooked.

I followed this recipe EXACTLY minus white pepper because I didn't have any. I also have done this recipe without marinating.  Both ways for me turned out perfect. I'll never cook a whole fryer any other way. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was amazing!! I followed the recipe as is as far as the seasonings.  I did 1 chicken instead of 2.  Saved the left over seasonings for later use.  Will definitely be a staple in my home. So easy, so good!

Even my Husband could do this! This chicken turned out great. We used split breasts instead of whole chickens.  Still turned out great, way better than the split breasts my husband cooked the week before. Just enough spice and lots of great flavor.

Made this today.  It's been in the oven all afternoon, roasting away.  The skin is a nice crispy golden brown.  I basted it with the juices in the pan as well.  Delicious.  If you'r looking for a new way to bake a chicken, this is it!

It is THE one! Sooooo Good. Even with the changes I made due to ingredients I had on hand, it was fabulous. I only had Smoked Paprika and no white Pepper and used 1- 6 1/2 lb Roaster. Followed everything else. Marinated in Plastic wrap over 24 hours (not intentionally, but thats just how it had to work out) It was so good. So Tender, cooking low just makes the meat fall off the bone fabulous.

WoW! What a chicken recipe! First what we loved about it: #1 amazingly moist (Even the breasts) #2 tasty tasty tasty #3 Easier than you can imagine! Only have 2 tiny downsides-#1 spice rub was enough for one chicken (glad I wasn't making two or I would have run out with chicken-goop fingers). #2 skin was like leather--next time I'd like to work on that so that we could enjoy that decadent treat.

This was so good will make a lot. Made gravy from the drippings which was great. Took the meat off the other chicken for chicken wraps later in the week and did what another viewer suggested. Put everything including the onion and I put some celery in the crock pot with water over night on low and what a chicken both it makes because of all the seasoning on the chicken. Made it just a the recipe calls for except only 2 teaspoons of salt, because we don't eat a lot of it. Will also take from another viewer and will make the 64 serving mixer of spices to always have it ready.  Thanks so much. In my house we say with all the new recipes I am trying is.......Is it a sweeper or a keeper. And this was hands down a keeper

I used this recipe's amount of seasoning for a family pack of chicken legs so I omitted the fresh onion and because I try to cut down on sodium, I opted to reduce salt to 3 total tsp (1 tsp onion salt, 2 tsp season salt).  This recipe was fantastic!  The chicken was moist, tender and flavorful even after I took the skin off (once it was cooked).  I passed this recipe on to others and this will be my go-to recipe!  Thank you for posting this recipe Sue!

Fantastic coating - can't wait to make it again.  I didn't have any white pepper the first time so  left it out and it still tasted fantastic.
Oh, and I followed other reviewers' comments and only used 3 teaspoons of salt.  It was plenty salty enough.

This is the only way I'll bake my whole chicken.  The first time I tried this recipe, I followed it exactly and it was good.  I've tried different store seasons.  Barbeque and sweet rub, were the best.  With the BBQ, I stuffed the inside with a sweet apple instead of an onion.  They were both good with the overnight seasoning and slow cooking.  The leftover makes a great soup.  My boys request this for their birthday and Christmas dinner.

I used this recipe on some chicken drumsticks I had laying around and it was GREAT!!!! I cut the recipe in the half and excluded the onions and white pepper. I added 2 tablespoons on brown sugar and made a dry rub out of it. I didn't have time to marinate them so I put them in the oven for 30mins on 375. They came out crisp and with a spicy sweet flavor. I do think next time I will use less spice seeing as I had to add brown sugar to tame the recipe and it still had a kick to it, but its definitely worth the try.

This chicken was really moist and delicious my brother said it was the best and coming from him that's awesome! I used 1 tsp. of garlic powder instead of the 1/2 tsp. the recipe called for and glad I did.

Flavors are awesome and can be used so many ways. I used it on chicken breasts. I let the rub sit on the chicken in the fridge for 6 hours or so. I then dusted them in flour and pan seared the breasts in a butter/oil combo. I baked them off in a 400 degree over for 10 minutes! Delish!

Very Good! My first time ever buying/cooking a whole chicken....so needless to say I only made 1! I did make a bag of the seasoning to have on hand like another reviewer suggested-but it was too salthy for our taste, so I will need to add more of the other spices before using it next time. Also, I will take the skin off the chicken before I season and cook it. But there will be many more times this recipie is used. Thanks for giving me the courage to try cooking a whole chicken!

This is a winner.  It bakes for a long time, but other than that it takes very little preparation time.  I used chicken leg quarters and brushed barbecue sauce on some of them at the end of the cooking time.

This chicken is simply fantastic!!! I have never purchased a precooked chicken in the grocery store and now I never will. I used a 7.5lb roaster and roasted for 5.5 hours at the suggested temp and it was moist and so tasty!!!  YUM!!

It is a good recipe. I made it without the onion powder, because I had none on hand. Also, I applied the rub and started baking it right away due to time constraints. Still, delicious. The kids liked it as well.

The only change I made was to reduce the salt.  Was disappointed in the end result though.  It wasn't dry so that was positive, but, the end result after the extra steps was just 'so-so'. I won't use this one again.

I'm saddened that I can only give this 2 stars.  One for the spices, one for the gravy it produces.  I read most of the reviews and before I embarked on the 5-hr journey for my 4-lb bird, I fiddled with my oven to make sure the internal temp was 250-degrees.  Still, the bird was dry.  I should have checked it, I know.  My entire family asked me to keep the spice mixture, but continue to roast chickens the way I always had.  They were rabid over the gravy, though (made with pan drippings, chicken broth and cornstarch).

This is a great recipe! And makes plenty for a full meal and leftovers. Note that the thyme aroma seemed overpowering (to me) after the rub down, but wasn't distinct at all once baked so don't let it discourage you.

I wasn't sure about this one, but it turned out delicious and moist!  Everyone loved it.  I ended up marinating it for two nights, and then forgot to put it in the oven on time.  So, I put it in the oven at 350 degrees for one hour, and then turned it down to 250 for the remaining 3 hours.  It was done perfectly.  Just thought I'd put that in there for all of the other absent minded moms out there!

I made this chicken tonight for dinner. I planned on doing the 250 degrees for 5 hours, but got home late and ended up having to cook it on 350 for about 2 hours. It was SO good! Juicy, tender, and full of flavor. I will definitely make this again, for the 250 degrees/5 hours as specicfied. There is only 2 of us so I only did one whole chicken, but still used the amounts of seasoning listed in the recipe and it was perfect. I made the greek oven fries (recipe found on site) and the two went together great!

Fantastic!! Its the best chicken i've made so far and it's become a part of our dinner routines! I did not measure teaspoons out of the seasonings but I did use all the ones listed! P.S. Refridgerating the chicken over night made a HUGE difference. SO GOOD!

Wonderful! I halved the recipe and it was plenty.  Instead of a whole chicken you can use chicken pieces.  I rubbed the outside of the chicken (legs and thighs are my favorite) with olive oil and then sprinkled in the spice mixture all over.  Then I popped them in the oven at 415 degrees for 35 minutes total, turning over at the 15 minute mark.  They turned out delicious!  I will definitely use this spice mixture again, maybe on pork chops next time!

I left out the cayenne and white pepper. Just added a little more black pepper. I made one five pound chicken. Only used half of the spice mixture, wrapped in plastic wrap and marinated overnight.  My chicken took 4 1/2 hours on 250 to get to 170 degrees.  It was very moist and delicious.

Ohh yeah. This was soo good. I love it over any other roast chicken recipe I have tried so far. The top of the bird was a little dry looking, but man oh man did the flavor really pack a punch, it didn't matter what the the thing looked like.

This was too easy and very delish!! IDK what ppl mean saying all the time and money. 7lb chkn was $6 and I used most spices in the cabinet, which ommitted white pepper, thyme, and cayenne pepper. It was really good without them tho. I put it in the oven before church came back in exactly 5 hours and it was perfect! Will be making again. Hubb said to add potatoes next time! THANKS so much

Surprisingly good! I used whatever spices I had on hand to stuff a 7 lb. meaty roaster. The flavor penetrated ok. I only put one onion inside and it still worked.

Amazing recipe. It really gives the store bought roasted ones a run for their money. I've never made roasted chicken before. I cooked it in a glass pan as I do not own a roaster (it's in our registry!!) and it came out perfect. Added some cut up sweet potatoes, red potatoes, and baby carrots around and let it roast. Definitely worth making if you have the time. Super yummy!

I found this recipe 4 years ago, thought it was fabulous and just kept cooking my roast chicken like this. Everytime i think I get sick of this recipe, I try a new one. But nothing compares to this chicken perfection! I keep coming back to this Roast Sticky Chicken.

Good, but WAY too salty.  And I love salty food.  I'll cut the salt by half next time.  Mine was also a little overcooked after only 4 hours, and I was actually using a 6-pounder.  I guess you really need to keep a close eye on it, and take it out as soon as it reaches 170 degrees.  As I'm now reading through some of the reviews, I see that someone suggested cooking it breast down for the first 3 hours and then flipping it, which apparently helps keep the breast moist?  Never heard of this, but will try it next time.  Overall, this was worth trying again with half the salt and a closer eye on the temperature.

I used the seasoning as directed, but started baking immediately.  It still turned out great.  Super tasty and well seasoned!

Didn't really come out like the rotisserie chicken I've had from the deli. It wasn't bad, just wasn't what I was expecting. I followed the directions so I'm not really sure where I went wrong :(

Excellent! I've made this three times in three different ways and it's been amazing each time. I think I've found perfection this last time though. I didn't let it sit overnight but it still came out wonderfully. Since I was only making one chicken  I halved the herbs and spices but I creamed them with a stick of butter. I seperated the skin from the meat and spread the butter on the meat over the breasts, drums, wings etc. I still spread it on the skin and inside the cavity. Baked covered at 375 for 75 mins and it was falling off the bone and extremely flavorful. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

This was fantastic!! I put in a roasting bag and marinated for 24 hours then baked on 275 for 5 hours and it was falling off the bone and had a delicous flavor!! My super picky 8 year old ate it. This is my go to recipe for a whole chicken! I cant wait to try out different marinades.

While it tasted decent enough, it was no different than any other roasted chicken I've ever made. If I hadn't put the rub under the skin it would have had no taste at all. It still was pretty bland. Cooking it 5 hours would have dried it out completely.

So good!! Although I must have had very large onions because I could only fit one between both chickens. Will be keeping this recipe and making again!! Also, as other reviewers said, I cut back on the salt.

I had flipped the birds on the hour.  I started with breast down, and ended with breast down.  I cut the cayenne  to an 1/8th of a tsp  woold double or even triple the garlic.  Might even add some sugar to the rub.  It was excellent with an 1/8 tsp of cayenne!  I will make it again!

My husband gives this 5 stars, I give it 4. We really liked the flavour although it could have used an extra kick. I roasted two 3lb chickens for 3.5 hours and they were perfectly tender. I will definitely make this again, and will experiment with leaving the spice rub on the birds in the fridge for a longer time.

OMG, Amazing!!  I'm not the best cook, but with this recipe I think I can fool people.  It was very simple and the results were outstanding.  I did not have a whole chicken, I used a bone-in chicken breast, split in two.  Because of this, it only took 3 1/2 hours to be fully cooked.  The only change I made to the recipe was use only 1/4 tsp of cayenne powder and 1 whole teaspoon of garlic powder.  This is the best chicken I have ever made!!

This RECIPE is amazing... My wife & I personally think it's better than the store bought rotisserie chickens. However, I did make some a few changes. I used an actual rotisserie via a convection oven instead of roasting it. I coated the outside with olive oil before applying the rub & left out the 2 onions. For the rub I upped the garlic to a full teaspoon; replaced the cayenne pepper with ground red pepper, added 1/2 tsp. of celery salt, & added 1/2 tsp. of ground cumin. Cooked a 5.25 lb bird at 400 degrees for 2 hrs.

This is our standard for roast chicken now.  It is delicious!  I enjoy that I can do all the work when my energy levels are still up, and I don't have to be working hard around dinner time.  I usually brine the chicken overnight in salt water and season it right before roasting.  I have a low rack that fits my roasting pan, and it works beautifully.  Sometimes I'll throw red potatoes and carrots in the pan.  The drippings make an excellent gravy thickened in a roux.  We use the extra chicken for many things, and always make stock out of the bones--a delicious stock.  Thanks for a great recipe, a definite keeper!

Made this several times now, and am always asked to share the recipe.  I mix it up ahead and use as needed. I took a jar of the spices with me to my mother's, and even she asked for the recipe.  It can also be cooked right away or in a faster oven and still have good results.  I've done it once in a dry crock pot.  just put a rack or several balls of aluminum foil to rest it on.  This meal is lways a hit.

This was the best chicken I have ever made, I liked it way BETTER than the store bought versions, so I will never buy a store bought one again if I can help it!  I am making it for company today, can't wait :) It was perfect last time, my husband ate almost the entire chicken himself before I got home from work he said it was so good!  Note: I did reduce the salt by half (and I use sea salt for less sodium) and I also added 2 tsp's of BBQ spice, and 1 tsp Chipotle Mango Rub. The spice mix is a great base and can be modified according to your personal tastes!

I am poultry-challanged.  My birds always come out too dry or under-done.  This recipe is my cure!  The chickens came out perfectly moist and juicy.  The gravy that I made with the drippings was awesome, too.  I just left out salt since the drippings already had enough.  I highly recommend this one!

This recipe is a keeper! I 1/2 all the dry ingredients, and use one Pick-o-chick cut up chicken. I place it in a Corninware casserole dish with sliced onions, covered, in the fridge 5 hours or overnight. You can roast it with the lid (extra juicy) or with it off.  For 1 cut-up chicken, decrease roasting time by 1/2 hour.

To me this was ok. I was a little disappointed after the rave reviews. It was nothing like the rotisserie chickens we are use to eating.  The seasoning smelled great at first, but got to be a little strong after a while ( which is surprising because I love seasoning!!).  I cooked to a temp of 170.  Breasts were done perfectly, but legs were over done.  I did consider covering them with foil for a while, but decided to stick strictly to directions to make sure it turned out just as it should.

I am giving this 5 stars because this was the best salad I think I have ever had. The only change I made was to use blue cheese, served this for company with prime rib and everyone had seconds. This is a keeper.

I have made this countless times on my barbeque.  With the rotisserie unit it takes about 2 hours to cook and OMG is it good.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe came out very well. Everyone liked it and I was surprised that it was so moist with the long cooking time.  I planned this for dinner without reading through and had to change plans when I realized it had to be marinated over night.

Mine didn't come out as sticky as I might have liked.  The skin was so tough that you could barely cut it.  But, the meat underneath had a very nice flavor and was really moist.  I dont' know if I would go through the bother to make it again (easier to pick one up at the grocery!) but it was good.

I cut the salt ratio in half, added 1/2 tsp of sugar and substituted smoked paprika for the regular because I was all out. Then I marinated the chicken (6 lber) over night. The rest of the recipe was a cinch to follow. Thanks for sharing.

Good flavor but the seasoning is only on the skin and not the meat. I think I will inject meat with seasoning next time like you would do a fried turkey for more flavor.

Marinated over night but forgot to put in the oven soon enough, so I baked it at 400 degrees for almost 2 hours adding a little olive oil to the top half way through. I spooned the juices over the top when it was cooked and let it rest for 10 minutes before slicing. Great roast chicken recipe. Thanks!!

I know there are a ton of ratings on this recipe, but I thought I would add one more :) My husband could not stop saying how amazing this chicken was, better than his mom's even! I just did one 5lb chicken but otherwise followed the recipe. I threw it into a roasting pan with some carrots, potatoes, onions and garlic, and added water so the veggies would cook and be moist. If you add veggies to the pot, I would also recommend reserving a little of the spices and sprinkling it over the potatoes and carrots! Awesome recipe, I would recommend it to anyone!

I didn't want to bother with a whole chicken, so I bought thighs and drumsticks. I baked it at 300 uncovered for about 2 hrs. I basted the chicken twice, and broiled for about 3-4 min to get browner. I left the skin on. It didn't get quite as crispy as I wanted, next time I may increase the heat. But the chicken was really moist and delicious. And I used the extra juices for gravy. Just added a little salt and pepper, heavy cream, and flour to the drippings and onions that had been marinated and baked with the chicken. The gravy was delicious and really added to the already delicious chicken. I'll def. make again.

I follow the recipe as written and I have used this recipe on chicken and cornish hens. Both came out perfect. Sometimes, I increase the oven temp to 350 and roast it for less time for weekday dinner, and it still comes out juicer than most chicken recipes. Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

I will never roast chicken any other way again!! Used same technique with turkey breast and it came out just as good.  Did not use the cayenne as I made this for my young grandchildren who don't like spicy yet.

While the taste of the seasoning was pretty good, it was way too spicy for us even with only using half the amount of cayenne.  This is coming from someone who use to enjoy eating marinated jalepanos as a snack.  My husband said he liked it, but that it did pack quite a punch.  I had to wash off my kids pieces, and even then they said it was too spicy.
Will try again with only a dash of cayenne next time.

This was the BEST chicken I ever made!  My family loves it so much, they want me to make it every week!  I added a maple seasoning blend to the rub ingredients and it was so fantastic.  I also used this rub on a pork loin roast (slow roasted as well) and it came out juicy and perfect.  Thanks so much for this fabulous recipe!!!!!!

seasonings were great, I think I left mine in too long as it was a bit dry.  Entirely my fault though.  That will teach me to go outside and completely forget about it!  I didn't let it go to waste though, what meat was left over made an outstanding chicken pot pie.   :o)

So good.  My kids loved it!  Normally my daughter won't eat chicken like this.  I had to share the breast with her.  Am making again soon.

This recipe is so DELICIOUS!  I have made this... probably 5-6 times now!  I am a working wife, so I don't have hours and hours to dedicate to cooking, so I actually make this at 400(F) degrees for about 1 hour and 45 minutes (basting every 30 minutes). I temp the bird at about 1 hour and 15 minutes to see progress.  I made this last night and the husband was baby sitting it and actually added chicken broth because it was too dry in the pan.  The seasonings are delicious the way the recipe calls, but I always add more than needed.    I serve with mashed potatoes and boiled asparagus - yum!  I keep one of the birds for the next day chicken sandwiches (which I cut off the meat from the refrigerated bird, and heat it in the microwave, throw it on to a sandwich with a delicious slice of cheese --- left overs are amazing!) .

I guess low and slow is the way to go because this is the most tender and moist chicken I've made to date.    I made one larger whole chicken and baked it for the total of 5 hours.  It was perfect.  Everyone loved it.

Halved the recipe because I only had 1 3lb chicken (and there's only 3 of us). I could only fit half of one onion inside the cavity. I left out the white pepper. I further reduced the cayenne and black pepper to 1/8 tsp. Cooked it for 3/12 hours and used the drippings for gravy. This recipe is a keeper!

Too spicy, waaaaaay overdone at 4 1/2 hrs. The skin was so tough the kids could not bite thru it. I don't know(shrugging). Don't get it at all as I followed this to a "t" except for taking out of the oven 1/2 hr early. Won't be making it again:( Sorry.

Not sticky, but definitely the best roast chicken I've ever made! Very moist and flavorful. I didn't have onion or garlic powder but minced a couple of garlic cloves and smeared them on the bird with the spice rub. It was delicious!

This was really good - I think the trick might be to use a thermometer on the chicken.  My chickens might have been too small because they turned out a bit dry.  I think having a thermometer would keep from overcooking.

This was great!  I did as directed except I used less salt and I made the run into a paste w/ a little olive oil and schmeered the birds.  I also bought 2 7 lb. chickens so we would have some leftovers.  So, I ended up roasting them for 9 hours and they were wonderful.  I am glad I cut the salt because I think they were just a tad salty (for my own taste, so I'll cut a bit more) but, not so much so that they were not good.  The chicken was moist and tender.  I will be using this recipe over and over again. 
I also chopped some potatoes and carrots and added those about halfway through and they got the flavor of the drippings and were amazing.  I actually had to stop my son from eating all the potatoes!  And, as stated more than once the drippings make a delicious gravy.

Amazing and so easy.  10 stars.  I used a best-of-fryer and it cooked in 2 hours.  Basted every 30 minutes with pan juices.  Wow.  DH says it's better than any store-bought rotisserie chicken.

Delicious! Will never buy store-roast again after these moist, perfectly-spiced chickens. I didn't have time to even do the marinating and they still turned out fantastically. Cooked chicken legs with the spices rubbed underneath and on top of the skin, and cooked at a higher heat for less time as I was short on time, and they are still amazing. Made with dipping sauce and tasted great on sandwiches the next day. Can't wait to try as is with the marinating. A keeper in our regular rotation.

Okay, this is a FABULOUS roasted chicken recipe!  I used one 5 1/2 pound roaster and thought that the spice recipe made just a little over enough for that one chicken.  I quartered one unpeeled white onion and halved one leftover garlic head and stuffed them both into the cavity.  I did let my chicken marinate overnight and probably won't ever change that.  Chicken was roasted for 4 hours on 250 (no basting at all), then I just turned the oven off as we had a party to go to.  Came back a couple hours later and thought my chicken was probably mummified.  But once I cut through that crispy skin, the most beautifully moist and flavorful chicken - EVER - came forth.  Oh my.  This is such a wonderful recipe that I'm planning on blogging about it.  Thank you Sue!!

This was quite possibly the best chicken (and was hands-down the best gravy) I have ever made. I followed the recipe exactly, did not baste the birds at all, and they came out moist, tender, and flavorful. As other reviewers have said, the chickens literally fell apart when we transferred them to a cutting board! Just as well, since we didn't know how to carve a bird properly. =)

The roasting pan was nearly full to the brim with drippings, so I could not resist making gravy. I made a roux with a couple of tablespoons of flour and about a quarter cup of the drippings, then added the rest of the drippings. Absolutely amazing! 

I will be making this again and again.

"This is the BEST chicken, Mom!" was the review I received from my family after making this recipe. For a 8lb chicken I doubled the recipe except for the salt (4 tsp Kosher salt) and the Cayenne pepper (3/4 tsp) - my kids don't like things too spicy. I started the cooking temp at 400 for the first 30 minutes then decreased the temp to 275 for the remaining 3 hours. I also basted after the temp change and every hour after that. I found that during cooking I had to add some chicken stock to the bottom of the pan to get enough drippings to make a lot of gravy - the gravy is fantastic! Just used a butter/flour base and whisked in the drippings. This chicken is the most tender and juicy I have ever made at home. At the request of my husband and kids, I have made this chicken four more times since my initial attempt. Thanks for a great recipe!!

My husband and I make this once a week.  We have roast chicken one night, and then have another 2-3 chicken based meals.  It's easy, delicious and very cheap.  The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is that nothing about the chicken strikes me as rotisserie-like.  I sure is delicious, though.

I have to admit something.  In all my years of cooking I've never roasted a bird. Turkey or chicken.  I've just always lived close enough to friends or family to have family holiday dinners, and somehow, I never got bird duty.  Of course I helped my mom growing up, but never on my own.  We loved this!  It was sooo tasty and moist and delicious, and we'll be eating on it for the whole week.  The dark meat was absolutely to die for, and the white meat stayed moist, although not nearly as flavorful.  But we'll use that for soups and other things and just eat the dark meat plain.  I couldn't stop picking pieces off, and I nearly couldn't move the chicken onto a cutting board because it just about fell apart in my hands.  I'll use this recipe over and over.  Make homemade chicken stock from the carcass and nothing goes to waste.  There's a way to stretch your $5... :)  I used one 7 lb chicken instead of 2, but used the full spice rub.  Thank you thank you my fear of bird roasting is officially conquered!

I will serve this again! It was moist and tender, and the family loved it. It's best to cook a couple of these at a time so you can have chicken leftover to put in meals later in the week like chicken and dumplings or chicken noodle soup.

This was GREAT!  I've been searching for an "oven-baked" chicken recipe that would not be dry...this was it!  Chicken could not have turned out more perfect!  My oven/thermometer took exactly 5 hours to reach 180 degrees (make sure you check close to the bone).  Awesome chicken!

WOW!  This has to be the best chicken I have ever made in the oven.  It really is worth all the time.  I used just one 5lb chicken instead of two chickens.  I also cut back a little bit on the amounts of pepper called for in the recipe.  I did not want it to be too hot/spicy for the kids.  This recipe is a keeper!!

Absolutely super recipe!  I didn't have whole chickens so I used two each chicken breasts, legs and thighs and only baked for 2 hours.   I baked it at 275 for 1 1/2 hours then raised the temperature to 325 for the last 1/2 hour.  The last 15 minutes, I lightly basted with barbecue sauce.  Delicious!  Thanks for this great recipe!

This is a great recipe.  For those who do not have white pepper, I suggest buying some and check the difference in flavor in your  cooking.  I use white pepper in a few recipes.  This recipe is a keeper

This just might be the best chicken I have ever made.  It is important to marinate over night.  The meat was very moist and flavorful.  I baked them 5 1/2 hours. I would give it 10 stars if I could!
Thanks for the great company recipe!

If you don't have white pepper don't use it but for those who have never used it it's completely different than your usual black pepper.  If you do any cajun cooking you'll want to keep white pepper in your cabinet.  It adds a depth to your spicy dishes that surprises.  Anyway, LOVE this recipe, the whole family does.  I haven't had a chance to refrigerate the bird for 24 hours but it still comes out amazing.  I have a compact rotisserie so 2 hour cook time.

I was very pleased with the way this chicken turned out!  It was effortless and delish....
just to emphasize how juicy this chicken turned out, when I stuck the meat thermometer in juice poured out.  Thanks for the recipe.  We will definitely make this again...and ALL the possibilities with the leftovers...endless.  : )

This was by far the best chicken I have ever made! I made two chickens that were about 4lbs. each and when I checked their temp after 4.5 hrs., they were already to 190 degrees. They were still super moist- even the breast meat. Btw, had a ton leftover. I wonder if you could do this with a turkey and just cook for like 12hrs in the oven...

AMAZING!!!
This is soooo unbelievably good! Even my 9 month old and 3 year old gobbled it up!
I didn't have have cayenne pepper so I substituted with red pepper flakes for a kick
I also did not cover and refrigerate overnight, so it will probably be even better next time!
I only had 1 chicken, but I still used the same amount of spices and rubbed over the skin and underneath the skin as well..next time I'll use less salt
I didn't have an onion, so I sliced up an apple to put inside the chicken to keep it nice and moist.

Loved the seasoning, but five hours is way to long, I took it out at 3 and half hours and it was perfect and tender.  Next time though I am trying it on the grill as beer can chicken I think that will be better than in the oven.

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except I placed 1/2 stick of butter tabs over the top of the chickens before baking them. The flavor was fantastic! I pulled them out of the oven inner meat temp at 170 - let them rest while I made the gravy - SOOOOO tender and juicy! The gravy was SO flavorful! Thanks for sharing!

I should have read some of the less favorable reviews before making this dish.  It is one of the few failures from all recipes.  The cooking time produces a texture that borders on mush.  The chicken took on a browned appearance at about 3 1/2 hours.  Next time I will use this time and then brown at 450 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes.

FANTASTIC chicken recipe!  I followed as written, except for the fact that I didn't have time to marinate.  I also increased the garlic power and replaced white pepper with a smaller amount of freshly ground black pepper.  I made sure to taste the rub to make sure that it was good for my palate before seasoning the bird.  In additon to rubbing the seasoning mix on the outside of the bird, I mixed a few tbls of the rub with softened butter, and rubbed that underneath the skin of the the chicken.  I seasoned the chicken liberally  and had it in the oven within an hour, and it was still fan-flippin-tastic!  I was worried because at about 2.5 hours the chicken still looked a bit pale and anemic but it carmelized beatifully and had an amazing flavor, sooooo tender after the 5 hour slow roast.

Dear God! This is so good! I bought a 4.5 lb pre cut whole chicken at walmart for six dollars. I put it on a roasting pan and followed the recipe. I only cooked it for 3 1/2 hours and it was perfect! My little girls loved it and there are no words to describe how how good it taste...

This was amazing.  Prepared as directed (using seasonings I had on hand) and it was so easy and good.  I agree, must season the night before.  Thank you for the great recipe.

What an AWESOME recipe!! I ended up essentially doubling the rub (I only used one chicken but made the entire batch of rub) and roasted like a traditional whole chicken (not at the low temp suggested). It turned out to be the best roasted chicken I have ever made!

I have made this several times exactly as written.  Even family members who "don't like chicken", love this.  I aways wrap in plastic wrap and leave it in the fridge for 24+ hours.  Can't say enough about how much I love this recipe!

Not bad I never got the caramelized bottom at all. The meat did not fall off the bone either. Tasted good though.

I had been curious about this recipe for ages, because people rave about it.  I held off on making it because of the name.  I don't ever in my life want to eat sticky meat.  This is not sticky meat.  It is tender and flavorful and definitely worth trying.  Thank you for the recipe, Sue.  Please change the name.

Here's the best part of this chicken recipe-slow cooking in the oven at low temp! We got a lovely tender bird with crisp skin (better than crock pot) and clean oven! Here's what I didn't like about this recipe=too much pepper! I always make homemade broth with the leftover 'bird parts and drippings' and this doesn't make the best chicken broth.

I've tried brine, rotisserie's EVERYTHING, and this is my favorite chicken!  Simple, neat, and OH, so moist and flavorful.  We like to serve it tex-mex style with tortilla's, beans, and Pico de gallo.....ummmmmm!

This spice mix is SOOOOO good..I halved the salt and added 2 tsp garlic salt and omitted the powder...I use it on whole chicken and chicken pieces...I think it would be good rubbed on steak too...or fish...

Absolutely the best chicken.  Was as good, if not better than the rotisserie chicken bought at stores and a whole lot cheaper.  The broth makes excellent gravy.  No need for any additional seasoning.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this recipe exactly the way the recipe called for.  I gave it 4 stars based purely on the moistness.  Even that white meat was nice and juicy after a day.  However, except for the skin, it was pretty bland.  Also, I have no idea where the "sticky" came from.

My family loved this recipe. I used my electric roaster, it took less time to cook. I also used a store bought rub that I had on hand, it contained almost the same ingredients. I added sliced potatos and carrot as others had suggested. I will make this again and again.

Best roasted chicken I have ever tasted. Lined my roasting pan with carrots and red skin potato wedges with chicken on top, breast side down.  It was very juicy and cooked to perfection.  The vegetables were delicious, as well. Made gravy with the drippings.

I was excited to try this since there were so many 5 star reviews..it was juicy and looked great, but you couldnt taste the spices..its roasted chicken. I never got the sticky part, but maybe thats if you make the sauce. Its no better than rubbing a chicken with olive oil, salt, and pepper and roasting..I made the mistake of making it for company...its a weeknight dinner ..no more.

I don't understand how any one could say that their chicken was dry. My chicken was extremely moist an with lots of flavor. My husband and kids loved it. With certain reviews that stated the chicken was dry I decided to make an additional recipe to accompany the chicken. I used Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce. Although like I stated before...the chicken was moist and flavorful I didn't need to make the cilantro salsa but the two together were explosions in your mouth. AWESOME! This recipe will be used whenever I make baked chicken. Many Many thanks to Sue Rogers. Your recipe made my family's tummy happy!

After we ate I said, that was good, same as usual, but I didn't think it was as good as the grocery store. My husband said, I thought you got it from the grocery store. So I guess I'm my worst critic and it was better than usual. It only took me 4 hours to bake, I cut back on the cayenne and added sage. We love sage paired with poultry. I also only marinated it for four hours. Next time I will do overnight. Totally worth the time it takes. Don't forget to use the drippings for an awesome gravy!

FANTASTIC! I found this recipe on this website a few years ago -- and believe me I have made it many times -- especially when I'm trying to impress family.  I've made the recipe "as is" -- and it's always a winner.  The prep the night before goes quickly -- and when it gets into that oven and starts roasting....the aroma is heavenly!  I've used chickens a little smaller, slathering the seasonings on and they just fell apart and ohh...soooo tasty! Make it once -- and you're hooked!

Absolutely delicious, the whole family loved it...great flavor, super moist! Instead of cooking it in the oven (way too hot in TX right now for that) I put it on our baby George rotisserie for 1.5 hrs...perfect!

this was amazing.  I really didn't expect it to come out as great as it did.  We would open the oven from time to time and pour the juices back over the chicken.  It was GREAT! Definitly a keeper!!

I, unfortunately, didn't have time to allow this to marinate for as long as the recipe calls for. I marinated it for about 2 hours & followed the directions exactly except for that one detail. OMG! This was good! I can't imagine how good it will be when I have time to marinate it over night! I plan to make a Chicken Pot Pie with the (little bit of) leftovers.  VERY GOOD! I'll make this again!

Excellent! I used it without letting it marinate and it was still wonderful. I also didn't roast it at a low temp, but rather roasted it at 400F for 1 hour and a half and then turned it down to 350F to finish it off.

I make this all the time.  So simple and the family LOVES it.  I make it in my rotisserie and it turns out perfect every time.  Save the carcass too, it makes a killer stock!

This is quite simply the best roast chicken I have ever made.  Moist, flavorful, and practically foolproof.  (I've only ever made one chicken at a time, though, so I just halve all the ingredients.)  I don't typically have white pepper on hand, but I love spicy foods, so I just double up on the cayenne.  Magical!

This is a wonderful recipe and so easy! I mixed up all the spices and prepared the chicken 24 hours in advance. I popped the chicken in on my lunch break and by the time I got home it was perfectly cooked and ready. I will be making this often in our household. The seasoning mix was a little spicy but delicious none the less. Thank you.

This recipe is spot on!!!  I think the seasonings are what mDe it...   The only change I made to that was adding celery salt, and lots more garlic and onion powders...  I also used the full qtys listed for a single 4.4 lb chicken.  I didn't let mine sit and marinate either, just threw it in the oven..  A lot of my rub came off, which didn't affect the chicken any, but the made the gravy I whipped up amazing!!!  It was so spicy and had loads of flavor.  All I did to make it was add 2 cups water to the chicken drippings....  It was outstanding - maybe even better than the chicken!!!!    I will be mowing this a lot more, for sure... Especially once it gets a little cooler!

This recipe is fantastic! I have made it several times and always love it. I don't have white pepper so I add a little extra black pepper. I will be making it for company again tomorrow.  Makes a GREAT chicken soup when you boil the carcass. No need to season the broth.

This is fantasitc! We only used a 3.6 lb bird so we cut all the ingredients in half (and then half again for the salt). It cooked for 3.5 hours and was sooo tender and juicy. Tasted fantastic. We will definitely be making it again. (Also, after it roasted, I sprinkled a little Tony Chachere's on it and that was great!)

This is, without a doubt the best roast chicken I have ever eaten.  Would cut down on the salt next time because it was a tiny bit too much for my taste but my dinner guests raved.  I'm going to take the sugestion of an earlier poster and make a jar of this seasoning to keep on hand.  It's devine!  Thanks, Sue for a great recipe!

Very disappointed.  Would never make again.  The skin was so tough that you could not even bite into it and the taste was not that good at all.  Sorry

Awesome chicken, and so easy to make.  Did a little basting toward the end to give them moistness, otherwise I don't think they would have been very sticky.  Delicious though, guests loved it.

Oh My!!! Marinating overnight is the secret & placed a little seasoning under the breast skin.  This is one of the best chicken dishes ever and sooooo moist!  The spice blend is perfect!!!!!

A very good way to make chicken, debone and freeze for future use.  Love that you make two at once--eat one for dinner and freeze the rest.  My family really liked this recipe--especially my husband.  Every time I say "chicken" for dinner they all make a face until now.  They ask for this recipe since it is so moist and flavorful.

Absolutely the best roast chicken I have ever had.  In fact, it will be the only roast chicken recipe I will use from here on in.  I baked the chickens in my roaster, which worked perfectly (maybe even better than in the oven?)  The meat was fall-off-the bone tender and the skin was nice and crispy.  My four-year-old daughter wolfed it down and she's notoriously fussy about meat.

I baked for 4 hours, then added another 15 minutes for good measure. I don't have a meat thermometer, so I was worried about how I would know it was done, but I stuck a knife in and the meat just fell off the bone, unbelievably delicious!!!  And so easy, just put it in the oven and go run errands for a few hours!

Wow, this was fabulous! My first attempt at a full roasted chicken (I usually make chicken breasts), and it was delicious and easy. I made a few updates based on other reviews: Only 2t salt, 1t pepper, and I added 2 T minced garlic to the cavity with the onion. I was going to make the gravy, but it doesn't need it at all! I used only one 5 1/2 pound chicken, and it was done in about 4 hours @ 250 degrees. Highly recommended!

Mmmm so good! I've cooked this recipe TO SERVE 4 PEOPLE a few times now, and have made a few adjustments to suit our needs/ tastes:  1)omit paprika and cayenne pepper as they can burn- there's still enough spice with the white and black  2)a 3.5 lb chicken only needs 1.25 tsp salt  3)marinate- as mentioned in other reviews- for at least 5 hours- it does make a huge difference :)  4)use a completely defrosted chicken  5) dice and saute large onion with olive oil and minced garlic clove, and let cool before stuffing into cavity (otherwise onion may not cook through and sauteing gives a better flavour)  6) add 2 cups of water to the bottom of the roasting pan- prevents splattering/ burning/ smoking and may need some replenishing every hour or so  7)my oven just doesn't do low temps well so roast for 2.5 hours at 150 degreeC  8) to make onion gravy: pour juices into small sauce pan and about half of the onions from the chicken- dissolve 1 tsp-1tblsp flour/cornstarch in water and add- bring to boil and then simmer for about a minute or less- you may need to add a bit of water/ salt/ pepper  Thanks Sue Rogers for this great recipe!!!

If I could give this 10 stars, I would! I love rotisserie chickens, but this was 10 times better than any other chicken I've ever eaten.  In the words of my 5 year old son, "it's perfect!".  I followed the directions except used fresh minced garlic cloves inside and outside the chicken, and omitted the paprika and white pepper (since I didn't have those on hand).  The skin was crisp and golden, the meat was beyond tender and so moist.  I bought a bird with the little thermometer already in it and cooked at 250 until it popped up (right around the 4.5 hour mark).  I used the drippings as is over mashed potatoes and it was to die for :) So easy too- this will definately go into our regular dinner rotation!

Oh DEAR LORD this chicken was AMAZING! It tastes like it came from a restaurant!  My Husband and Daughter couldn't believe oh great it was!   The three of us ate an entire chicken!  I will most definitely be making this again!  I did leave out the thyme because I didn't have any one hand.  Thank you SO MUCH for sharing your wonderful chicken!

sorry this is only worth 1 star considerting the amount of work and money you put into it.  Easier to go to the store and buy one already made.

Well.....I felt this was more 3.5 stars but that's not an option in here.  I followed the recipe to a T... even let it sit 24 hrs wrapped up with the rub on it.  The chicken was INDEED cooked to perfection, and it did fall off the bone (meat was very moist).  However, the rub flavor is not present all the way through the meat.  It's on the skin only. Yes...  it was good...but was it just like store bought rotisserie chicken?  No...it wasn't..not in my opinion.  I did enjoy the long  term roasting at 250°!  Took it out at 170° - covered it in aluminum foil and let it rest 15 min.  DONE TO PERFECTION.  I will probably roast all whole chickens at this time/temp from now on, but I have still not found my PERFECT RUB.

This was soooo good that I wish I could give it more stars! The only thing I did different was cut back the pepper a bit, add 2 cloves of garlic to the onion in the cavity and refrigerated it for 24 hrs.

Yummy!  I cut the recipe in half because I only had 1 chicken. And I didn't have time to let it sit in the frig for hours, so I just put the spices right on and threw it in the oven, came out scrumptious!!  Very easy too!!

This is great! The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly as written and the chicken was delicious. We don't care for dark meat so I use bone-in chicken breasts with skin. I make up 10 or so pieces at a time, wrap two pieces together, leave them in the fridge overnight and then freeze. I also use smoked paprika for even more flavor. Thanks Sue!

I started making this recipe when my kids were tiny and it is such a good recipe.  I can't remember where I first saw it, 12 (?) years later I still make it several times a year.  The leftovers are great and the spice mix is quite versatile for other applications.  It's kind of a pain to remember to rub the chicken the night before but you are so rewarded when dinner is all ready and so delicious.

I was skeptical of the temperature and cooking time, but it worked! I rubbed it down with butter and halved the recipe for one chicken. After the first 2 hours it looked hopeless. But keep turning and basting once the juices start collecting in the pan. The meat fell off the bone and cleanup was simple since nothing burned onto the pan due to the low cooking temperature. Mix some of the rub into some butter and stuff it between the skin and meat. Then sprinkle the rest of the rub over the chicken. Use a thermometer to test doness.

This was great!!!! I used it with a 7+ lb oven stuffer roaster and cut the spices in half (my kids don't like things too spicy). Instead of slow-roasting it for 5 hours, I roasted it in an oven bag. It was falling off the bone when I took it out and made terrific gravy, no extra seasoning necessary. Next time I'll try refrigerating it overnight, but it was great even without the wait.

I only made 1 chicken with the whole amount of seasoning and it was very good (although a little salty, which I should've predicted, my own fault) A definite "A" for spice mix and cooking method!  So versatile to use the leftovers for many things!

Excellent flavor! I used this recipe for 2 whole cut up chickens cut into 8 pieces each for Passover. Since they were cut up, I did not use an onion and stuff the cavity, but seasoned the chicken as described in a gallon sized bag. I let the chickens marinate in the flavors for about 1 1/2 days and roasted them for an hour before serving. They got RAVE reviews!

This is the perfect rotisserie style chicken! The spices are great and can easily be reworked for your own palate. My boyfriend uses extra fresh garlic and skips the powder. Also we roast it on a bed of halved baby potatoes and some sprigs of thyme for a complete meal! Also be sure to make gravy from the drippings - just a dash of flour and corn starch, no seasoning necessary since the bird is well rubbed! 5 stars =)

Absolutely the best chicken I ever made.  And yes, it does taste like the ones you buy at the grocery store!  Next time as I mix the spices I will put them in two seperate bowls so I can put an equal amount on each chicken.  They marinated about 24 hours.  I had two four lb. chickens and they were done in less than four hours at 250 degrees.....I probably should have started "taking their temperature" earlier, but they weren't dry.  The meat just fell off the bones, they were so tender.  I cut one up and froze it for future use.  I will definitely make this again!  Thanks for the great recipe!

So good... thank you for sharing. It was only my husband and I so I froze the second chicken (raw), onion and all. We tried the frozen one the other day and it was as good as the first one... my freezer is going to always have one for an easy meal.

I've made this a couple times with wonderful results. However, I tried to re-create it in the crock pot today; it didn't work out so well. I used bone-in chicken parts that I coated with the spices and wrapped in plastic overnight. I put them in the crock pot this morning on top of two quartered & separated onions and set it to low for 8 hours. The chicken came out dry and the spices were burnt. Anyone have any suggestions on where I went wrong or how to successfully make this in a crock pot? Thanks!

This was excellent!  Super moist.  Cooked a 6lb roaster for 4 hrs and it was perfect.  A little too spicy for us, so a little less on the pepper next time.

Didn't follow this *quite* to a T, but I didn't have all the ingredients on hand:  I one and a halfed the spices since I was working with 2 five pound chickens instead of 2 four pound chickens. I had no onion powder, and was low on garlic powder, so I grated a few cloves of garlic and rubbed them all over the chicken. Also, before roasting, I put a few pats of butter underneath the skin to make it slightly self basting.  Even after overcooking the bird slightly at a higher temperature this came out great. (At 350 for just shy of 2 hours, 2 5lb birds came out at about 190 degrees in a crowded oven. o_O) The meat was juicy and tender, and the pan drippings made an excellent white gravy. (If you're going to make a gravy from the drippings, note that you probably won't need salt in it--what runs off the birds will be plenty.) Will definitely make again!

I made this last night for dinner and it as good as everyone says, and so easy.  I saved the drippings, cooled in fridge, and removed the fat.  I used the gelled broth in a butter bean soup today as a flavor enhancer.  It tasted really great. I think you could use this in any soup to enhance the flavor.

I followed this recipe nearly exactly, and it was one of the best things I've ever eaten! I cut the salt by a teaspoon, and added an extra teaspoon of paprika and half teaspoon of garlic powder, and it was incredible.

The most tender and delicious chicken ever. Falls right off of the bone. The pan drippings are so delicious that I don't add anything to it, and just pour some over the plated chicken. So easy to make.

Outstanding! I have never had a chicken that was so moist. My only suggestion is to season under the skin as well. We do not eat the skin so the full flavor of the spice mixture was lost. I will never cook a roast chicken any other way. Thank you!

I'm not a big chicken fan, but I do like the rotisserie chickens that you get at the super markets and I have family and friends that like it.  Since I live alone, I decided to do chicken breasts.  I let one marinate for 24 hours and froze the rest (with the seasonings).  I'M IN LOVE WITH THIS RECIPE!!!  I will never ever make anything but this recipe for my guests.  The breast was moist, tender, I could cut it with a fork.  The skin was just perfect.  I did put some seasoning under the skin and quarter an onion (1/4) and put the breast on top of it.  It seems other people's chicken always taste raw to me so I have always avoided eating it on a regular basis and didn't like the taste.  I am a TOTAL CONVERT!!  If chicken can taste this good.  I can't hardly wait to have guests over.  Thank you for the recipe.

Top notch.  Made as written but did cut back on the cayenne pepper a little as we don't like things to hot.  It didn't take 5 hours more like 4 to cook two very large birds.  One was an Roaster chicken 7+ lbs

An outstanding recipe - probably the best I've gotten off of allrecipies.com  To speed up the cooking time, use cut-up chicken parts - drumsticks, breasts with rib meet, etc.)

We LOVED this chicken.  The meat fell right off - just gently pulled the leg bone and the whole thing just fell off.  We had ordered a rotisserie machine but decided to try this while the machine was in transit and it is every bit as good as the machine cooks it.  Right now I have a chicken in my rotisserie BUT last night I mixed all the ingredients and rubbed the chicken and refrigerated because the seasonings together are PERFECT.  I did send my daughter this recipe though as she doesn't have a rotisserie.

This was okay.  The breast meat could not have been more "moist" and tender.  I was quite disappointed in the skin but then again we should be eating healthier anyway.  So simply just pulled the skin off and salvaged the meat.  Probably would not make again but was good for one meal. I used a chicken that was just over 4 lbs and it only took about 3.5 hours to get done.  Glad I check things waaaay early on.  Thanks for sharing.

My DH liked this very much and I will make it again. I did cut down on salt but will add more next time. I used all of the other spices on one four and a half pound chicken, and am glad I did. I did like the ease of the recipe.

This has become my son's favorite dinner choice. It is easy and delicious. I usually use one larger (6-7#)chicken, and have never had to bake it as long as the five hours called for in the recipe. Try it... you'll love it!

Like everyone else - This turned out great, falling off the bone. Definite keeper. I added some garlic butter before seasoning, but other than that I followed the recipe to a T. :)

This chicken was CRAZY good!  I followed the recipe exactly, stuck it in the fridge in an oven bag overnight and roasted it the next day.  The whole house smelled like heaven and the chicken was as tender as a baby's behindy!  :)  I will make two more of these for dinner this week.  Try it and you'll be hooked!

I saved a parmesan shaker and make up a whole batch of this spice blend.  Then when I want to make this, I just have to grab that one container out of the spice cabinet and shake away.  The original blend is great!  But this last batch I made I substituted Smoked Paprika for the regular... incredible flavor!

This is my family's favorite way to roast chicken.  I have made this several times and it is always a hit.  I follow the directions, letting it sit overnight in the fridge and basting during cooking.  This is moist and full of flavor.

This was by far the easiest meal to put together. I had left over like you wouldn't beleive but I shredded extra and placed in other meals. I did make the mistake of putting my oven rack too low for the 250 temp. The hour I raised the rack and set the temp to 300 and I got the same results as everyone else. My family enjoyed this very much! Thank you for sharing

This turned out great!  The spice rub was fantastic.  I did cook the chicken at a higher temperature for a much shorter time.  Used a meat thermometer to make sure it was done.  I would defnitely make this again and if I have more time, I would follow the time and temp.

This was by far the best chicken I've ever had. I only made tiny changes - I used two cloves of fresh minced garlic (as I didn't have garlic salt) and omitted the onion salt (I didn't have that either). I cooked it slowly for about 3 hours then we got hungry so I drove up the temperature in the oven until the bird was cooked, about 30 minutes later. The gravy was delicious and each bite of turkey we took we both groaned in pleasure. This is a fabulous recipe! Thanks for posting!!

We enjoyed this.  Used split chicken breast instead.  I didn't have time to marinate this like the recipe called for, but it was still really yummy.  I lifted up the skin to add more seasoning to it.  Next time I will try to make time to marinate this as the recipe calls for.  Very very good.

This is by far the best way to roast chicken! The meat is fall-off-the-bone tender and the flavor is great with just a hint of heat. I would recommend putting your chicken in the pan breast side up since the skin turns out better that way. I didn't realize the recipe calls for two chickens until after hubby had put all of the spice on one chicken. We rolled with it and ended up loving it. I would do it that way again. I did cut back the salt to just 1.5 t due to other reviews stating it was too salty. Try it - you won't be disappointed!

This was my first time roasting a whole chicken. I found the recipe to be easy and delicious. Though I will say I didnt really see anything "sticky"  about this recipe, the flavor was fantastic.Thanks for helping me achieve a beautiful meal that I was proud of and my family loved.

The best chicken I've ever made.  A little easier when you use chicken parts (thighs and breasts) but more impressive with a whole chicken.  Super moist, fall off the bone, not too spicy or salty, juuuuust right.

This was fantastic. Made as directed using 1 4lb bird and baking at 250 for 4hrs. I didn't have time to marinate it in the seasonings, rubbed it on the skin under the skin and in the cavity with onion and garlic put a couple of pats of butter under the skin, and there was still plenty of flavor. Made a gravy with the drippings, chicken broth and cornstarch. Served with collard greens and wild rice. Fantastic light dinner that didn't leave me felling guilty. Thanks

This recipe is so delicious! 5 stars for sure! The first time I made it I forgot to "Marinate" the chickens over night so I through them in the crock-pot with all the spices just as it called for, and they still turned out fantastic! The whole family loved it! Doing it in the oven as the recipe calls for yields a slightly different result which is just as mouth watering but not necessarily better IMO. Both ways can be done depending on convenience to you or what have you, either way is 5 stars!!!! Thanks for this great recipe!

I follow the recipe exactly except for omitting the cayenne pepper, but the next day I simply didn't have enough time to leave it in the oven for several hours so I butterflied the chicken (following some web videos) and then roasted it above potatoes for 45 minutes at 475 and put a foil tent over it for 15 minutes after I pulled it from the oven.  Delicious!!  The breast was slightly more cooked than the thighs, but still fairly moist.  The thighs were pretty close to heavenly.  I also put the potatoes back in the oven for crispiness and my husband loved them.

This was DELICIOUS.  The spices were perfect (a little kick!), and the chicken was fall-off-the-bone tender!  I followed the directions exactly: marinated it overnight, then started the chicken in the oven when I went home for my lunch break.  I used the drippings to make a yummy chicken gravy over mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables...wonderful!!!  This is the best roast chicken I have ever tasted; I think it's even better than rotisserie you buy at the grocer's!  Will DEFINITELY be making this recipe again!

Easy and delicious!  My only problem was that the chicken was so tender, it was difficult to cut!  I baked one chicken at 250 for a little over 3 hours.  Will definitely be making this over and over again.

Fabulous recipe! The chicken came out nice and juicy. The best part was that my picky children couldn't eat it fast enough! Thanks for a great recipe, will definitely be making this often.

Very Good. Letting it sit makes it tasty all the way through. Takes time, but well worth it.

I've made this twice.  The first time I rubbed the spice mixture on and let it sit in the fridge overnight.  It was amazing.  The second time I forgot to rub the mixture on until just before I put the bird in the oven.  It was still great but just a little drier than when it had sat overnight with the spices.

Everytime I decide to make its usually 3 hours before dinner, so I never let the chicken sit with the rub on it and do not have the time to cook for 5 hours. I make this recipe with only one change, I use one whole meaty chicken (about 5 1/2lbs) I change nothing else, it just absolutely delicous no changes should be made! I just made it for a friend that just came home from the hospital, tomorrow I will make mine and this time I will try letting it sit and cooking it for 5 hours. Its definetly a keeper!

i have made this twice and it has become a regular weekly meal. i use one chicken but the same amount of spices. add garlic to the onion in the cavity and let it sit overnight. i used butter the first time under the skin, and basted -- DO NOT do so. it doesn't need it at all. i add some chicken broth -- first time i basted, the second time i didn't, and it was even better when i didn't. i also added carrots and potatoes the first itme, but found it was easier to prepare them seperately. cooked the whole 5 hours on 250 and it is wonderful. we have chicken the first night, chicken sandwiches the next day, and then a big pot of chicken soup using the bones and meat left from night one. wonderful recipe!

Wonderful recipe and far better than grocery deli bought! I adjusted the spices a bit but not much (more garlic, a little rosemary) and put the birds in breast side down.  Went about four hours at 250 then cranked to 375 to crisp the skin for about ten minutes.  Fabulous!

Dang...I thought my Mother made the best chicken! I was wrong...sorry Mom.  Follow recipe, but save the mess by placing the chicken in a plastic bag and then adding the seasoning.  Also added a lemon, onion, garlic, and celery in the cavity.

Wow!  Great flavor even my picky daughter liked it.  I followed the recipe except for the onion powder (didn't have any on hand) and the onion (husband is not a fan of onions).  I also only cooked 1 chicken so I only cooked it for 3 hours and that worked out perfectly.  Having the chicken marinade over night really does the trick of dispersing the flavor.  Loved it and will definitely be using this recipe from now on with whole chickens.

I cut up the chicken and placed it in an oven bag after seasoning. I let it set in the refrigerator for about 3 1/2 hrs. It had plenty of flavor, but just not exactly what I was hoping for. I much prefered the recipe that called for salt and paprika only... too me it tasted much better than this recipe. I think it had WAY too many flavors and actually were quite overbearing.

this is by far the best rotisserie chicken i have ever had, I have made this twice already!! The first time I stuck to the exact spice measurements and it was fantastic but just a little bit spicy for our tastes so this time I cut the white pepper and cayenne pepper to 1/4 tsp each and it came out perfect!! I only had 1 6-pound roaster and had to put it in the oven on my lunch break so I couldn't take it out at the 5 hours suggested so I knocked the temp down to 225 degrees and took it out when I got home from work after about 6 hours...boy does the slow-roasting make a difference! The meat was so tender and juicy, and what flavor...YUMMM!! my boyfriend is VERY picky and never gets too excited about meals but he actually called me at work to tell me how good it was the next day as leftover sandwiches! thanks for the fab recipe!

The kids liked it A LOT! It does cook nicely, browns and crisps the skin. There isn't a good flavor throughout the chicken but it's super moist. I only used one chicken with the spices made for two. I think this works better. The spices are very similar to the rotisserie chickens.

We are now fans of chicken! Anyone who stops by when I've made the chicken cannot believe how good it is, even the next day. The rub is so good that I convinced my mother-in-law to use it on a turkey at Christmas. It was a huge hit!

This was pretty good chicken.  The taste gets five stars from me but the chicken was relatively dry through the breasts.  Normally I brine birds through the winter when I can leave them outside overnight.  This is the first chicken I've done since and it made a HUGE difference.  Will definitely use this combination of spices again when I can perfect the method.  I also made sure to baste it about once an hour or so because when I checked in after an hour it looked deathly dry even with the butter I'd slipped under the skin.  Eating the wings with my fingers I definitely found it sticky, but that may have been due to my basting.

Great chicken. We made it on a rotisserie on the BBQ.  It came out great and tasted similar to the famous Portuguese Chicken you can buy at restaurants around here.

This recipe is superb!  I was looking for that "Sunday recipe", you know, the one that you can toss in the oven or crock pot most of the day.  I admit that I've NEVER cooked a whole chicken before - I typically buy/cook parts but have always wanted to cook a rotisserie chicken.  Anyway, I cooked this exactly as the recipe instructed and WOW!  My family LOVED this chicken and immediately asked me to make it again.  This is definitely a 5 star keeper!  Thanks so much for sharing!

I stuck to thre recipe except forgot it was suppose to marinate for hours........... so it went right in the oven. Tasted pretty good. Next time I will roast it breast DOWN to try and keep the breast moister. Would probably work in a crockpot too.

I only give this 3 stars bec for the amount of time you have to wait for it, it was only ok -- moist, yes, only slightly flavorful.  I cooked them in a glass roasting pan and it filled with liquid to the very top!  I switched pans and continued cooking, saving the juices for a  tasty gravy.  Also, why is it called "sticky" chicken?  I don't think I'll bother making this again.

This recipe is great.  I will say, for the amount of time and work involved, I will stick with just buying the rotisserie chickens at the grocery store.  The result was pretty much the same.

Delicious, this was the first time I have ever made a roast chicken, it turned out great, it was falling off the bone so it made it easy to cut up. There were a few spices I didn't have so I just substituted some poultry seasoning, and let it sit overnight in the fridge.  Will make again!

Who needs a rotosserie! THIS IS AMAZING! I made sure I even rubbed this mixture under the chicken skin too. OH WOW!!!!!!!! overnight marination is your friend! You may want to cover the breast with foil after it hits 180 and then continue to cook it for another 5 mins to cook the theighs all the way through.

Well this was certainly an adventure for me, which is not at all due to the recipe. After failing to properly thaw my chicken (I used 1 5 lb chicken & resized for 5 servings) I found myself digging frozen chicken parts out of my chicken which is SO not fun. If I hadn't been on a schedule I'd have put the thing back in the fridge and let it thaw one more day. Since I had no time though, I filled a pot with hot water, put my still store-shrink-wrapped chicken in, and thawed it that way. (You have to change the water every half hour and turn your chicken side up and side down repeatedly else you'll have a half-frozen chicken that won't cook right. This method WILL work but honestly..if you have time...just put it back in the fridge for another day.) That aside, I made this recipe as noted except for exchanging white pepper for yet more black pepper. Also I removed the onions before I cooked it--but now I think I was supposed to leave them in. It tastes fine without them, but I'm pretty sure it'd have been even better with onion juices dripping into my roasting pan. I added carrots the last half-hour as I find they improve the flavor of the drippings. Last but not least, I roasted my chicken upside down. This was by accident really, and I have no idea if it contributed to the moistness of this chicken or not, but it made a terrific April Fool's day joke when my husband carved the bird and only found dark back meat!

This chicken was super easy to prepare. I marinated 24 hours before and kept in the refrigerator. It turned out to tender falling out of the bones. Next time I will add fresh garlic instead of powder and some fresh rosemary.

I made it, somewhat like the recipe. I used all the spices, but I cooked it at 300 for 2 hrs. then I had to push it up to 350 to get dinner on the table. I used a 7 lb. chicken and it came out all right. The taste was fine, and it was somewhat juicy. I just didn't have the timt to cook it for 5 hrs. on 250. I think I'll stick with my way of cooking 20 mins. a lb. on 350 and call it a day.

Oooooh, my, what heavenly chicken.  This was loved by everyone in the family. Letting it sit overnight made such a difference.  I cooked one large roaster and had to cook a bit longer than noted but I'd accounted for that.  I did kick up the heat to 350 for about an hour in the middle of the cooking time.  I highly recommend this recipe.

I also use a 5 pound chicken, marinate overnight and cook in the crockpot on low for 8 hours.  I remove chicken when it is done, add a can of chicken broth to the pot and enough cornstarch to thicken the gravy - delish!

I used the amount of spices on the recipe and a whole 5 lb. chicken.  Typically, my husband is not a fan of chicken. However, he loved this one! Moist and tasty. Even the breast were moist. Be sure to use a meat thermometer to check this. When it reads 170° it is ready to take out of the oven. Easy, easy, easy.

Very tasty, but it costs about the same as a grocery store rotisserie chicken.  And then you don't have to clean up the roaster pan!

Very, very good.Used two 4 lb chickens. I went exactly by the recipe except I only used 2 1/2 tsp. of salt. Rubbed and stuck in fridge for about 3 hours. Mine were done in 4 1/2 hours and I basted once about 2/3 into cooking. The taste was excellent and my grandchildren loved it!! I'm going to try and freeze ahead and throw it in the crockpot as one reviewer suggested. I liked having one chicken for dinner and another already made for use during the week. I will make again.

Did not have any thyme so used rosemary. Also did this on breast pieces not a whole chicken.  Full of flavor will make this often and use the thyme next time.

I baked it 250F, 4.0LB chicken with the skin on for 3hours exactly. and it came out so deliciously tasty and juicy. I love it so much. It was my first time making the chicken and I loved the juiciness and the flavor of the meat. My friend who is a cook also loved the flavor. I didn't eat much of the skin, but I'd say that if you like the skin, you may want to bake it on a higher temp for 30 min or so for a more crispy taste of the skin. I don't eat the chicken skin so it didn't matter to me that much. I love this recipe and so did my friends. I didn't alter the recipe. I skipped onion power and white pepper because I didn't have them, otherwise I stuck to the original recipe.

This is the best chicken recipe I have ever made!  I used one 5 pound chicken instead of two.  I used all of the spices called for, except I did not have white pepper.  I just used extra black.  I melted a stick of butter in a small sauce pan and then added the spices.  This made a thick "sauce" that clung to the chicken (I spread it on with a pastry brush).  I also stuffed the chicken with lots of chopped garlic and a big onion, cut into rings. I then stuck the chicken in the fridge for about 5 hours.  The result is an amazing, moist, flavorful chicken that smells great while cooking!

This recipe is perfect just as it is. My family loved this chicken. It really did taste like rotisserie chicken you might buy. The juice it creates while cooking makes a good gravy. Definately a keeper.

Not sure why there is so much fuss about this recipe.  I wanted it to be fabulous, it wasn't.  The chicken is dry, the legs were almost like chicken jerky.

Wonderful recipe. My only "complaint" was that as I tried to carve, the entire chicken just fell apart. LOL  So, so good. And the gravy I made with the juices was very interesting - oniony, but VERY good with garlic mashed potatoes.

I followed this recipe exactly and even used the probe that is actually connected to my oven.  It seemed not done to me even though it was in the oven for about 5 hours and 15 mins and my oven read an internal temp of 180.  I have to say the taste was ok but I wouldn't make this again.  I like my beer in the rear chicken which has a similar spices but only takes about 3 hours and is moist, juicy and DONE.  I was really hoping to like this one.

With all the wonderful reviews I couldn't resist trying this.   I only used one chicken but used rub recipe for two and used it all.  Time being an issue, I only let the rubbed down bird sit in the fridge for about four hours.  I did put some water in the bottom of my roaster and I did baste three time during the 4 hours the bird roasted, I also flipped the bird at one point (bird was on a roasting rack).  I was afraid this would be dry as I used a fryer (bird) but this was juicy and delicious. My hubby is not a big chicken fan but he ate this up.  Wonderful recipe which I will use again and again but will make 2 next time so we have lots of leftovers. I would double the rub recipe for two birds. It really doesn't get any easier than this!

Delicious and easy.  Made as directed, except I only made one chicken so I just halved everything.  I also put some of the sesaoning under the skin of the chicken to add a little more flavor.  Thanks for sharing, I will be making this again and again.

Delicious.  The chicken was really moist.  The only change I made was to increase the garlic powder to 1 tsp.  I cranked the oven temp up to 325 for the last 30 minutes to make sure that the chicken was done in time for dinner.  I think it would've been even better if I'd been able to leave it in the fridge overnight.

Chicken perfection.  Made exactly as written.  The paprika gave the skin a beautiful color, although I don't eat the skin.  I will definitely put this in my All-Recipes binder of my "keepers".

Very good. The long slow cooking method is the way to go.  Used large leg quarters and baked 2 hours @ 275.  So juicy.  Will always cook this way but adjust the spices more to our liking. Very moist & tender.

We love this recipe.  I have been making it for years-a family favorite.  I have recently been using thighs and legs with the same seasoning and baking it for 3 hours at 250. Turning once or twice. So very moist but crunchy skin.  Great for parties/picnics.  Everyone begs for this recipe.  With leftovers I make Sticky chicken soup because all the spices give it a unique flavor than your regular chicken soup. Be prepared to make a lot of thighs and legs because they get eaten so fast.  We were not dark meat fans until I tried making this for a party. Try it.  It's the best!!!!!!!!!!

WOW!  That's about all I can say.  This chicken is incredible!  I was in such a hurry to try this that I even forgot to take a picture!  I cut the recipe in half because I only had one bird thawed, but now I'm wishing I had made two so we could have leftovers.  I mixed the pan drippings with a little chicken broth and a packet of country gravy mix (not the kind with sausage) and it made the BEST gravy.  I served this with mashed potatoes and green peas.

I just made this tonight - followed the recipe exactly, only with one chicken.  Now I wish I'd made two!  I would never have believed that a chicken cooked in the oven could come out as juicy and tender as one cooked on a rotisserie.  It was perfect!

Not sure what the whole sticky part is.  Mine was not sticky BUT it was so delicious.  I did not add the white pepper (I do not like the taste).  The seasonings are a bit spicy but I love spice.  I used to 4 1/2 lb chickens and they were done in 4 hours.  The meat was so flavorful and MOIST!  Excellent!!

I used one 5 1/2 pound chicken for this recipe. The house smelled wonderful while it cooked. I roasted carrots and potatoes with the chicken and they tasted great. Do check the temp of the chicken, as even a bird that big didn't need to cook any longer. It was actually done in less than 4 hours. This is a keeper. Moist, delicious, two thumbs up from DH.

I will never roast a chicken any other way. Juicy, succulent, I only made one chicken and it took only about 3 hours. 
I am going to try the same recipe on a turkey...I'll let you know how it does.

The spice rub is very good but I don't have time to cook a chicken for 5 hours.  I had a 5+ lb chicken and cooked it at 300F and later increased to 325F.  I used a meat thermometer to check for done-ness.  It was very flavorful and the drippings, combined with the rub seasonings, made a terrific gravy.  Nothing sticky about it.

Wow! This recipe was amazing; it tasted very much like rotisserie chicken! I did cut back on the cayenne pepper, because my family doesn't care for spicy food. The combination of spices was very good. The chicken itself was so tender that it fell off the bones! Thank you for a perfectly delicious recipe; I will make it often!

Yum! I followed the recipe to the T (well I cut the ingredients in half since I was only making one chicken) and it turned out wonderful! Hubby really loved it too. The spices were perfect and the meat was juicy and flavorful. Will definitely make again. Thanks!

Made this for a family gathering.  It was fabulous.  It seemed as if it might be done at 4 hours, but I kept it in for the duration.  Basted quite a bit during the last hour.  Also realized that I put the chickens in UPSIDE DOWN!!  I wonder if that's what made them so deliciously moist.  Took the pan out, covered it and had it sit out 1/2 hour as guests were late.  Still wonderful and hot.  Gravy was fantastic!

This is a staple recipe at our house.   Sometimes, I cube some potatoes in about inch and a half cubes and put in around the chicken and put some raw diced bacon on top of the potatoes.  The mixture of the bacon and chicken drippings make the potatoes divine-almost better than the chicken.

I hate to admit that in my 10 years of being married, I've never made a roast chicken until now.  This recipe was excellent!    Very tender and tasty, although I did not let the bird sit in the refrigerator overnight.  I also used ground red pepper instead of ground white pepper and it was very good, it gave it a little zip.

Used a 6 1/2lb turkey breast, but other than that followed exactly & it came out the moistest turkey I've ever had!

I could only give it three stars, because I was kind of disappointed in the taste.  I did not find the taste to be extraordinary and after 5 hours in my oven I was disappointed.  It was Juicy and it did fall off the bone, but the taste was just mediocre to me.  Just my opinion.

Tried this recipe (the spice mix) yesterday for something different (while roasting the chicken as I normally would).  It reminded me of the wonderful rotisserie chicken my dad used to bring home from time to time.  My husband and 12 year old son agreed this is how we should season / roast chicken in the future.  Thanks!

I made this for a gathering I had a few years ago and actually wanted to be able to enjoy myself instead of cooking. I made 6 chickens at once and the meat was falling off the bone. Wish I could make this all the time but takes too long.  Wonderful dish for gatherings!

Well, this WAS a good recipe.  It did happen to be a *wee* bit salty, but that's certainly an easy thing to fix.  I followed the recipe exactly (strange, I know) except for only using one 5-ish pound chicken.  I did make the mistake of letting it go all the way to 180 and it was slightly dry.  Next time, I will pull it out sooner.  Otherwise, great recipe!  Thanks!

This recipe was fantastic! Flavorful & moist.  I am not a fan of cooking or eating meat 'on-the-bone' and w/ this recipe, the meat fell right off! It was delicious - worth the wait w/ the long cooking timw. Perfect for Sunday dinner.

Best roast chicken recipe ever!  I used a 5.7 lb roaster (instead of the two 4 lb ones specified in the recipe).  Cut the salt down to 1 tsp (could have cut it down further), and used 2 Tbs of Cajun's Choice Creole Seasoning along with thyme, paprika, black pepper and cayenne.  Put 3 garlic cloves through the garlic press and first rubbed the garlic on the dried chicken, then rubbed the dry spice mixture, put it in a plastic bag and let it sit in the fridge overnight. Put the chicken in the roasting pan (half an onion and half a stalk of celery in the cavity) and drizzled it with 2 Tbs of melted butter.  Followed the rest of the directions, although I let it cook an extra hour because of the larger size of the chicken.  Served the chicken with the cranberry chutney recipe from the Colorado Cache cookbook - totally yumsville.  Will definitely make this recipe again.

I husband made this chicken for dinner and it was really good (comfort food at its best!)  He only made one chicken, and didn't marinate it in the dry rub overnight (for maybe 2 or 3 hours), but the end result was very tasty, moist chicken.  It wasn't sticky like the recipe title says - but very, very good nonetheless.

Chicken to die for. This was outstanding. Like most other reviewers, I didn't have any white pepper so I just used more black pepper. My chicken marinated for approx 5 hours in the fridge. I upped the temp a little to have it ready sooner -- cooked it at 280 for about 4 hours. The drippings made sensational gravy. The leftovers were delicious as well, both hot the next day, and then cold for lunch through the week.

I found this recipe in a Gooseberry Patch cookbook that I was given as a wedding present, and it is now my favorite way to make chicken.  It is great with any kind of chicken or turkey that is on hand and can be altered easily to taste.  The cookbook recommends using the crockpot on low for eight hours, but I have done it in the oven also. Definitely a favorite with our friends and family.

Not that this needs any more reviews, but gads...this was the most fantastic chicken we've ever had!  I followed the recipe exact, save for the spices I was missing (white pepper, onion and garlic powders will have to wait until next time) and did as others have recommended, using all of the spice mixture on one large-ish (4.5 pound) chicken.  It took about 3.5 hours to reach an internal temp of 160 degrees, and the resulting meat was incredibly moist and flavourful.  My fiance said that it was the best chicken he's had in his entire life!

My Oh My!!!  VERY good!!  It did take a little foresight.  I made the spice mix a few days before just to have that ready when I got around to doing this.  Used 3 large split breasts instead of whole chickens just because that's what I had.  Early in the morning, I rinsed the chickens, patted them dry, then put them back in the fridge to finish drying out so that I would get a nice crisp skin.  After about an hour, I put them in a large freezer bag with the spice mix and got the rub on them that way - I did not bother with the onions.  I popped them back into the fridge to marinade for a good 6 hours.  Then I cooked them at 300 for 2 hours.  Yummy!!!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I think the spice mix is a little salty.  Next time I think if I use a little less salt, it will be perfect!

This is a staple recipe in our home. I have made it several times and it is always good. I skip the wrapping and sitting overnight part though. I just out the seasoning on and put it in the oven and it is still great. I love having leftovers at my fingertips for a few days.

THANK YOU so much Sue Rogers for sharing this incredibly EASY and flavourful recipe!!  I did not marinate the chicken overnight since I didn't have enough time but it was still THE most melt-in-your-mouth delicious chicken ever!  To the rub ingredients I added around 1/2 teaspon ground ginger and decreased the salt by half the amount specified.  In each bird cavity I added 1 onion, quartered, 4 garlic cloves, chopped, and chopped pimento peppers (to taste).  I added some washed, new (medium sized) potatoes at the begining of the roast time.  An hour before the roast was finished I added some baby carrots. My son who prefers not to eat ANY type of meat couldn't help but to "sample" the chicken again and again even before it was on the table! This will become one of my "signature" dishes. THANK YOU SUE!

Really good Chicken.  Too much salt, so I used less than half the but the other measurements per the recipe. We had this for a casual dinner party and I used quarter chickens.  Roasted at 350 for 1 1/2 hours...perfect. Thanks

This never disappoints. I have made this many times now with the following observations: I no longer use all the spices, just salt and white & black pepper to enable the flavor of the chicken to really shine through. Convection speeds up cooking--a 4-pounder is done in 3 hours at 250. I always use this recipe (rather than braising or simmering) when I need cooked chicken for other recipes like chicken salad. Cooked this way, the chicken is super easy to pick.

After making this and using continously now for over a yaer, I decided it was time for a review.  It is one of my family's favorite way of having chicken.  I double the recipe and always keep it on hand.  I do use a normal size whole chicken, approx. 4 lbs., and bake it in a clay baker.  Just as good as a store bought rotisserie chicken, but buying whole chickens on sale and using this is much more cost effecient.  This is one of my great finds from this website!

My husband said it's the best chicken he ever had, better than restaurants weve eaten.  Even the bones are soft, he almost ate it.  I used only 1 tsp of salt and followed all the cooking instruction.  Will cook this one again.  Thanks very much for the recipe.

Made this on a lazy weekend.  Put in the oven at noon and forgot all about it.  I just had one 5 lb. chicken so I made a little more than half of the spice mix, adjusting the cayenne to my preference. Didn't have onion powder or white pepper, so I just used a bit of Lipton onion soup mix. It came out fantastic, so juicy and flavorful.  I think we overcooked it cause the meat was falling off the bones. The house smelled lovely and it gave enough drippings for me to make the other half of the chicken with gravy.  Yummy!  How convenient. Next time, though I will lessen the baking time when making only 1 chicken. Also I will add potatoes to bake in the broth slowly, mmmmmm.. . A keeper, thanks!!

I have made this many times.  I usually brine my chicken first for about an hour in 1/2 cup kosher salt to 2 quart water.

The gravy is great - all it needs is a bit of flour, some homemade stock and a splash of milk. I use wondra since it is so easy to whisk in. 

Last time I made this, my BF asked if I would stuff it like a turkey.  I want to try stuffing it next time.  It was a duh moment for me.

This is wonderful and always a hit with everyone that eats it.  Thanks so much for this recipe.

I thought this was so good, and so easy!  I added some wine to the bottom of the pan and used the drippings to make gravy - yumm!!  I will definitely be making this again.

Okay..Im giving this 4 stars because it was super hot! I'm VERY sure that I must have measured wrong w/ the peppers though...my 10 yr old son was reading them off to me (my big mistake!). So, I will definitly make this again when I'm less distracted. I mean we're talking lip burning hotter than hot hot!...but I have to admit..I kept picking at it. ;)

This recipe really doesn't need another great review, but I'm doing it anyway.  This was the most juicy chicken I've ever made, it was perfectly seasoned and yummy.  The only thing I didn't like was the long cook time, I made this on the weekend and ended up stuck at home for 5 hours while it was in the oven.  Other than that, delish!!!

If I could give this recipe a "10" I would!!! It was absolutely fabulous!! I'm often very leery about recipies claiming that they come out just like the restaraunt, since most of the time, they don't, often missing that special 'something'... THIS ONE HOWEVER, is true to it's claim!!!! Super easy to prepare, and just as easy to cook, the flavor that comes out when cooked is exactly like the store bought ones! I didn't have white pepper, and will try this one again when I do, the meat came off the bone, and every bit of the chicken was eaten! My family raved about it! This will be our only recipe that we use when making roasted chicken!!! KUDOS!!!!! A+++++

I'm giving this a 5 start rating for the cooking method, the chicken was delish and very moist.  I will make again, for sure.....but this spice blend is very salty.  I had read some reviews that warned that....but wanted to see for myself.  Next time I will half the salt.  I made my chicken with bone-in thighs and they were great.

*******update******
used only 2 tsp salt this time around and now the seasoning is perfect for me.  I baked leg quarters at 275 for just short of four hours.  This recipe is very forgiving, simple and a new family favorite!!

fryers or roasters work well.  Rub some of the spice mix up under the skin also before roasting

Wow! Fantastic! Divine!  What other adjectives can I use to describe this delectible, finger-lickin' good chicken?  I prepared it last night and let it sit all night in the fridge with the "rub" on.  I baked it for about 5 1/2 hours and it was just beautiful!  My husband was raving with every bite!  He likes his whole chicken really well baked; he doesn't like it to be "wet" (juicy) inside.  This was just right; it was very well baked, but was by no means dried out.  It was really perfect.  I can see serving this for guests.  It was such a simple recipe-just requires a little preparation; it's not something you can just think about and bake.  But, how does the saying go?  "Best things come to those who wait"!!  Thanks a million for this one!

It was wonderful.  I bought three chicken and baked them.  Then I stuffed two of them into vacuum seal bags and sealed them while still warm.  It was the easiest meal to pull out of the freezer when we have 4-H nights and can't cook a meal.  AWESOME! UP DATE: I tried it on a turkey for Thanksgiving and it was not as good.  Granted I did not spend as much time on it but the gravy was awesome!!!

Very nice chicken recipe - it really does taste like rotisserie chicken. I used black pepper in place of the white and the skin came out a bit too spicy, so do try to use the white pepper. The one drawback is that compared to my baked chicken, the skin was crispy in some places but a bit tough in others. The chicken itself was well cooked and flavorful. I followed another reviewer's advice and made gravy from the pan drippings, which was excellent. I used an 8x8 baking dish to cook the chicken and this kept more of the liquids in the pan for gravy.

I used the rub on a 4+ pound chicken that I smoked on my smoker for 7+ hours.  I rubbed the rub on the outside and the inside.   It was a HUGE hit!!  My boyfriend LOVED it.  The chicken literally fell off the bone.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

I made this today and it was wonderful.  The house smelled so good.  I used minced garlic in place of the onion because I didn't have one.  I also didn't have time to let them sit overnight.  I can only imagine how great this will be I can do that.

Great rub, but must double recipe for 2 chickens.  Also, 5 hours at 250 was too long.  Delish, otherwise.

This is our new favorite flavoring for roast chicken.  We've made it twice this month.  I loosen the skin and rub the spices on the chicken itself since we don't eat the skin.  And the leftovers have great flavor when added to other dishes.  Thanks for sharing!

My first time roasting a chicken. Very good. Husband loved it and had seconds. I did baste with butter to ensure crispy skin and juicy meat. Lovely spice combination, easy recipe. Worth making.

The chicken turned out great...i didnt use 2 whole chickens, but 4 huge bone in skin on chicken breast...the only changes i made were...used half the salt, i didnt have white pepper so i sprinkled in some red pepper flakes, used a little less thyme, and added about tsp on brown sugar...i let the chicken sit over night and the end result was very tasty and juicy.  The chicken was even juicy the next day...great recipe!

Let me start off by saying a college student so i always look for recipes that are cheap and easy. This was both! I followed the directions but i didnt have Thyme so i just used a few shakes of dried parsley. I used 1 tsp of garlic powder insead of 1/4.I just subbed more black pepper for white pepper cause i didnt have it.  I marinated overnight (18 hours about). I just wrapped the pan in Tin foil. Than i baked at 250 for only e hours (just 1 chicken) it came out so good. At the 2 and a half hour mark and i threw in 3 potatoes.

Everything turned out great, my buddy stopped by and he wouldnt stop telling me how good it was, he wasnts the recipe to make for his family. My only regret is i didnt make 2 chickens. Because me and my friend nearly ate teh whole thing, i had to salvage a plate for my girlfriend, she liked too. Next time i might cut the salt a little and get Thyme. but this is great! I'm gonna make this for my mom next time i see her. An instant classic thanks so much! No more Ramen for me!

The chicken was very moist and flavorful but it really didn't have a rotisserie flavor that you get from supermarkets.  Not sure I would make it again because of the time involved.

This recipe is fabulous. I actually have a rotisserie thingy for my oven and the chicken comes out great. After following the recipe to a T the first time, I felt that it wasn't quite flavorfull enough, so I doubled all the spices in the rub except for the salt, pepper and cayanne pepper. I allow the chicken to sit in this rub a good 12 hours before cooking. Now the chicken is over the top amazing!

This is the best chicken ever! It simply is one of my favorite recipes I've found and cooked. Even my little 5 year old cousin loved it.

My picky family loved this. I was able to marinate for only 3 hours and it was still good.  I bet it would be better if I could marinate for 6+ hours.
I don't have a rotisserie so I cooked it on convection/bake at 250.  It was done much sooner than 4 hours and that worked well.
Great recipe.

Sooo tender, just like the stores rotisseri chicken. Bought thigh,leg combo because they are so cheap. Followed recipe and it turned out perfect. I don't ever eat the skin, but cooking with it on. I'm sure kept the chicken moist, plus it came off so much easier after it was cooked rather then trying to skin the chicken to save a buck. Will definately make again.

This is a great recipe for chicken.  I love that it is slow roasted.  I prepared the chicken the night before, put it in the oven around lunchtime ran a bunch of errands and as soon as I stepped in the door my mouth was watering.  This was easy and delicious!  My husband made me promise to make this again.

Oh, yum! Don't be deterred by the amount of salt, spread out over two chickens it's really not that much. I made a few substitutions. I used: 3tsp kosher flake salt + 1tsp seasoning salt, and substituted lemon pepper for the cayenne. For the last 10 minutes I broiled the chickens for 5 minutes on one side and then flipped them to broil the other side for another 5 minutes so that the skin would crisp up. Those things I think really made a big difference. The flavor was amazing.

"This is so good!" Those were my husband's exact words. I usually like to change recipes to make them my own but because of all the wonderful reviews I decided to follow the recipe as written (although I was concerned about the amount of salt). I'm glad I did...this was a very moist, tender and juicy bird. This will definitely be in my recipe rotation. I'm wondering, though, if any preferred spice blend can be used as a rub? Hmmmmm. It will be fun experimenting. Thanks for sharing.

Really good, if you are in a rush just use Season All salt or Cajun seasoning and save yourself some time from having to blend the spices.

I followed the recipe except for using 5 lb. birds. Quite salty...I would halve the amount of salt. In 5 hours even my larger birds reached 180F, but at this temperature the breasts were dry and mealy and the skin was tough. Next time I will cook only to the USDA/FSIS recommended 165F.(http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Fact_Sheets/Chicken_Food_Safety_Focus/index.asp) That said, this is a nice savory dry rub, not hot at all as I had expected. I would give it another try for a shorter time. Update 1/19/16: I've used the rub with half the salt, no garlic (extra onion powder) many times now. I use 2-3 teaspoons per 3# bird and roast  at 350 F. for 75 min, or to 165 F.  I also use it in the crock pot with chicken parts, on low for 5-6 hours. I give it 5 stars with the change in salt and roasting method.

Great chicken. I didn't have time to let it sit with the rub on, but it was excellent anyway. I had a 7-pound roaster, cut the salt in half and put some of the rub under the skin. Five hours at 250 degrees was just right. I love cold chicken so I think it's better the next day!I'll do two at once next time. Thanks!!

Excellent recipe.  I didn't get a chance to put it in the frig before roasting it  but it still came out nice & juicy. I used half the salt it called for & omitted the white pepper & cayenne pepper, but was still very tasty!!!  It's worth cooking 2 chickens at once if you're going to take the time to use this recipe. Will definitely use this recipe again.  Thank U.

This is a great recipe!! I did change some things. I cooked this in a crockpot and I used 1 5lb roaster. I only added 1 onion in the cavity along with 1 bulb of garlic (peeled & smashed). I used the spices as stated and put it in the fridge overnight. Before I went to work I put 3 balls of foil at the bottom of the crockpot and set the chicken on top. Do Not add any liquid or you will end up with soup. I cooked it on low for 8 hrs. I came home from work to the Wonderful smell of roast chicken. All I had to do was toss a salad and dinner was done 10 minutes after I got home. I will definately make this again.

This chicken came out so moist... and so juicy... and SO SALTY!  I definitely recommend using HALF the amount of salt suggested.  Other than that, the flavors were very good!  I used a 7 lb roaster and baked it at 275 for bout 4 hours and turned the temp up to 375 for the last half hour or so to crisp it up.  It came out sooooo good- even the white meat was moist. I tried many roasted chicken recipes- and this is the one I will be using from now on (minus the salt!)  Low and slow is the way to go!

This is sooooo good, the tenderest roast chicken I've made. Definitely do the overnight seasoning, it is the key to moist and flavorful chicken.

My particular husband absolutely loved this!  He was still talking about it the next morning!  Need I say more?  The only change I will make when preparing this in the future is to put some of the spice mixture under the skin.  Very good recipe and great gravy!

I would have given more stars if given the choice.  This is a wonderful chicken...much better than the ones you buy and I thought they were great! I only did one big chicken, but they way it dissapeared so fast, guess I need to do two the next time, and there will definitely be a next time.

Very tasty, but it was not fall-off-the-bone moist like I expected. I think it may be in part due to a possibly mis-calibrated oven. I used a single 4.5 lb chicken. I brined the bird for about 3 hours before applying seasoning. The extra salt may have contributed to the dryness.  I used a 1/2 recipe for the rub, using 1 1/2 tsp natural sea salt, omitted white pepper (I don't have any), doubled the black pepper, substituted a pinch of red pepper for the cayenne pepper, and added 1/2 tsp dried rosemary. There was still some seasoning remaining after covering the bird inside and out, so I mixed it with the quartered onion and some lemon juice before stuffing it all into the cavity. I double-wrapped it in plastic and let it sit in the fridge overnight (about 12 hours). I like crispy skin, so I let it sit in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes after removing the plastic wrap so it could dry out a little. Then I roasted it at 250 degrees, with a thermometer in the breast. It was done in 3 1/2 hours.  The white meat was a little drier than I expected, but it all tasted very good. I served it with roasted seasoned potatoes and steamed broccoli. Very good dinner. This is our second favorite chicken recipe, and I'll probably try it again to see if I can improve the dryness.

I followed this recipe exactly and it was absolutely AMAZING!  It tasted a million times better than any rotisserie I've ever bought at the store.  It was so tender that the chicken literally fell apart as soon as I started carving it.  I normally don't eat the skin when I eat chicken, but I couldn't stay away because it was so good.  As suggested by the top reviewer, I made a gravy by adding a can of chicken broth (thickened w/ 2 T corn starch) to the drippings.  It was quite good, but next time, I'll pour off the grease first and just use the brown bits after deglazing (put roasting pan on stove over medium-high heat, pour in enough broth to cover - bring to simmer and scrape off all the brown bits).  I prepared both chickens but immediately put one in the freezer (before cooking and onion) for a future dinner.  I can't wait to have it again!

A great recipe. I make this and then make gravy from the drippings. A little mashed potatos and slow cooked green beans and it's dinner time.

This was really yummy! But next time I make this I will make sure to use just split chicken breasts since I always forget that my bf hates the drumsticks. The seasoning on this was fabulous though! I left out the white pepper and cayenne pepper because I don't have them and it was still yummy! Thanks for the great meal!

I'll cut down on the thyme next time, but I'll be making this again. It was fall off the bone tender, and the skin was crisp.  It made a delicious gravy too.

This was a great chicken recipe; loved the spice mixture. I doubled it as I ended up cooking just one chicken after already mixing the spices up, and it still came out great. I used a 4.5lb bird and it was done in around 3hrs and 15min, so I would suggest keeping an eye on the internal temp by around 3hrs or so.

I forgot to add (like other users) cook the bird UPSIDE down (breast side down) for most of the time. I turn mine up the last 20 minutes or so, but I bake it at a higher temp. I would suggest cooking it breast side down no matter at what temp, just give it time once you turn it to get an appetizing color.

Chicken was tasty, but it did not have that "rotisserie" taste to my family.  It was very tender, but I will go back to the Sara Moulton method - 15 minutes on 450 degrees, then waaaay down to about 300 degrees until done (depending on the size of the chicken).  Chicken was good, just not what I expected.

Thought I'd give this a whirl as it seemed like a breeze to throw in right after lunch for an early dinner... I actually didn't have time (I'm kinda a fly-by-the-seat-of-my-pants kind of girl) to allow the rub to marinate overnight so I was worried that the chicken might be dry, but... IT WAS FABULOUS and *really* juicy! It was worth the time and I know I'll use the method to roast other chickens! I also used the drippings in the bottom of the pan to make a quick gravy to go with the mashed potatoes I put on the side... YUM! ONE NOTE... we have 3 little ones and I knew that the spice would be too much for them so I just used 1/2 the spice mixture on one chicken and put a more tame rub on the other chicken for them. Everyone was happy with the results!

This is great!  The leftover chicken is great for making sandwiches, quesadillas, or soup, thus making it ideal for stretching your budget. I also use this rub when making "drunken" chicken (grill chicken anchored on half a can of beer using indirect heat).

This was my very first attempt at making a whole chicken and it was so easy.  I made one just as written and I put butter under the skin on the other.  We all liked the addition of the butter.  It was a tad dry, I cooked it 4.5 hours and I will have to adjust the time.

This is a great recipe!! Tried it the first time it was good. The second time took advice from others and put some seasoning under the skin and tied the legs together. I did change some ingredients and I think it turned out even better. I did not have cayenne pepper so I used Old Bay seasoning, doubled the garlic and omitted 1 tsp. of salt and added 1 tsp. of Lawry's seasoning salt. I used all the seasoning on a 5# chicken and let it sit overnight. This recipe is a keeper..  Thanks for sharing!

This chicken recipe is great! I've made it several times (have another marinating now). I usually arrange a whole cut-up chicken over sliced onion and slow-bake.

Truly the best homemade chicken rub I've ever tasted. Same goes for my family. I actually put it in a rotisserie to cook the chicken instead of the oven. It was better than any store bought chicken for sure.

This was very moist and flavorful, I was expecting "something" more. Used a 6 lb chicken and could have used another 30 minutes, was a little red at the breast bone.

I had an almost 8 lb. Oven Stuffer roaster and was looking for a better way to cook it.  It seemed like the recipe used an excessive amount of salt, so I reduced it by one half.  I roasted the chicken on a rack.  Since I was cooking a large bird, I found I had to turn the oven up to 300ºF for the last hour of roasting in order to reach the internal temperature.  Other than those two changes I followed the recipe exactly.  The chicken was moist, tender, and very flavorful with brown and crispy skin.  This was the best-looking and best-tasting roast chicken I've ever made.  I made gravy from the pan drippings after straining off the grease. It was delicious.  I'll definitely use this recipe again (with the reduced salt amount).

I was skeptical about roasting my chicken uncovered for the duration of it's cooking, but I have been converted!  I didn't have the time to "marinate" overnight, just rubbed'er down and stuck'er in the oven!  Beautiful!

Very good!  My family LOVED it.  I didn't marinate at all, just rubbed with olive oil and then sprinkled the spices on.  The chicken was full of flavor and so much less greasy then the supermarket rotisseries.  Great recipe!

I follow this recipe to the TEE except I rub the chicken with olive oil before applying the spices. Makes the most scrumptious baked chicken I have ever tasted. My family gobble this up! I usually make either two good sized chicken or 1 gigantic one to fill my large family's appetite. Leftovers (always just a little bit... IF any!... LOL) make a nice chicken sandwich for lunch the next day.

Awesome recipe -- the best chicken, hands down.  I like to buy the whole (or roaster)chickens en masse when I find them on sale, season them with the spice mix, and freeze for use later.

I gave this recipe 5 stars because it taught me a different technique and it had me successfully using a spice I haven't had much use for until today (paprika). I used an almost 9 pound capon, which actually required an extra 30 minutes, for a total of 5-1/2 hours.  I didn't have white pepper and am not fond of cayenne, so I used only finely ground black pepper and increased the amount to compensate for the others missing.  I thought I'd see if a little brown sugar in the rub would make it sticky (it didn't, but it did balance out the pepper).  I took others' advice and reduced the salt to 1 tablespoon, using coarse kosher salt. I was so nervous with such a long cooking time that I kept checking every hour, but it was done perfectly. I had cool broth from boiling the giblets and I mixed in some cornstarch and deglazed the pan with it, creating a tasty gravy, as others suggested.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

I just call this Roast Sticky Chicken because it does not taste at all like store-bought rotisserie chicken .. but it is fabulous!  No need to marinate overnight, though, because it cooks so slowly, there's plenty of time for the spices to soak in (and I've tried it both ways.)  And don't throw the giblets away, after washing them, roll them in the spices and put them back inside the cavity with the onion.  I made this for my Mom once, and she kept looking in the oven and telling me my chicken was going to be dry - but even she had to admit in the end that it was not at all dry, and now she makes this regularly.  The last time I made this, I cooked it in the crockpot for about 5 hours on High, adding a chicken bouillon cube in 1/2 cup water in the bottom to make sure it had enough moisture, and I chopped up some mushrooms to add to that broth - excellent!  Next time I'm going to do this again, but I'm also going to remove the skin, because I think it will be plenty tasty and much healthier without it.

Wow! This chicken came out so moist and flavorful! This was my first time roasting a whole chicken and it came out awesome! I cooked 1 4lb ckn and took the other reviewers advice and cooked it at 300* for 2 and half hours. My only complaint was that it came out a little too spicy for my liking... but other than that it was delicious! Will def make again!

Giving this recipe three stars because I appreciate the underlying cooking technique of very low heat for very long periods of time more than the recipe itself. I followed the recipe to the letter once I got a fairly unispiring result that was a bit dry and in need of gravy. When I tried the variation of amping up the levels of spices and--crucial for me in terms of tenderness--brining the bird beforehand, then marinating it, then rubbing olive oil and over the skin before roasting as directed, I got a truly standout bird. In either instance, I think the result was acceptable for a beginners' attempt and I do recommend this as a good place to start for those who don't have whole-bird roasting experience.

Just wasn't my favorite recipe.  It was a lot of work (prepping the spices, rubbing the chicken, stuffing with onion and then ultimately carving) and it just wasn't nearly as good as the rotisserie chicken you can get at the market.  The meat had a good flavor, but it wasn't falling off the bone.

I used a lot less salt than stated, marinated it for about 3-4 hours, baked it at 300 for about an hour and a half, then up to 325/350 for the rest of the time.  The meat literally fell off the bone and the skin was crispy and very good.  Great way to make chicken and will do on individual chicken parts next time.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

Moist, tasty, but my bird was only 4lbs and after all the carving and bones, there wasn't much white meat or crispy skin left to eat.  I think I may try this on chicken breasts and bake those instead.  House did smell good, though!  Update: used 6.5lb perdue roaster, did marinade for 24 hours, took 3.5 hrs, half with breast down, half breast up.  In the last hour, I basted with a little butter to crisp it up... DELICIOUS!  Made a fabulous gravy and tasted yummy over mashed potatoes.  Beware drumstick lovers - the chicken is so moist, you can't even salvage the drumstick.. the meat fell right off the bone.. soooooo good.  Update 2: I tried coating boneless skinless breats with this and then sautee-ing it...  eh - a little too spicy for me.. maybe i'll roast the breasts instead - but I do think the skin-on is important because of the flavor.  Stick with the roaster.

Very good recipe. The spice combination was delicious. I did not change anything though I did baste the chicken several times in the 5 hours. It turned out beautifully with a crispy skin and a very moist juicy chicken.  Definitely recommend trying this excellent recipe!

WOW is about all I can say. The chicken was so tender and I was worried it would be dry. The skin comes to a perfect brown. We really enjoyed this recipe.

This recipe makes by far the best roast chicken I have ever tasted. I own a rotisserie oven and I have not used it again since I discovered this recipe. My family loves it and it makes amazing chicken salad the next day. I did make the mistake once of using a more expensive, bigger roasting hen and it did not turn out well at all. It was tough and chewy, so I would not recommend anything other than the cheap, smaller whole chickens. Just wonderful!

mmmm good! the cooking time seemed to be off--i took the birds out at 4 1/2 hours instead of the 5 called for in the recipe, and the breast was dry and the legs disintegrated when i tried to remove them. the chicken was quite tasty though--i think that i may use the rub on my turkey this year, and let it "marinate" over night. ** it came out great, and the gravy was the best in years!!**

Very good. Tasted like a rotisserie chicken. Baked at 300 for 3hrs. The drippings made for a very tasty gravy. I did however used my own spice combo.

Yum!  I used only one teaspoon of salt and then rubbed the entire spice mixture on my 3 lb chicken.  My husband actually asked for doubles!  Can't wait to make it again.

This was WONDERFUL!  My husband even complimented me on it, which is a rarety. I only did one 4 lb chicken, and marinated it for 2 days in the fridge.  You could smell it after an hour or so in the oven, and everyone was "ready to eat" when it was done. Used leftovers for soup. Very good recipe - I wouldn't change a thing. Update-12/07: I doubled the seasoning recipe and used this for my Christmas turkey - the flavor was very good. I just wish I was brave enough to slow roast it like the chicken!

***Just made it again using a 9 pound turkey.  WoW!!!  Cooked it for 5 hours watching thermometer carefully.  So tender and tasty.  Used the juices leftover to cook the onions and 1/2 chicken broth to make a wonderful sauce.
This was a hit and very easy to make.  After a nice roast chicken dinner, boiled down the leftovers on the carcass with the juices that were left.  Strained the grease and bones out to make an easy base for chicken tortilla soup.  Two wonderful meals. Thanks.

End of story - this is the best roast chicken I've ever eaten.  It is so good.  I will be using the seasoning rub for my Thanksgiving turkey this year! The salt-based (I used kosher salt) rub pulls the liquids to the surface of the bird resulting in a perfect slow roasted chicken.  AWESOME!

This chicken was absolutely wonderful and surprisingly easy to make. It tastes just like the rotisseri chickens that my family likes to buy from Sam's Club. The only difference I found was that the chickens were done in about 4 1/2 hours instead of 5. I shredded the chicken and took it to a church lunch and there were no leftovers. I will definitely be making this one again!

This is an awesome recipe.  The most juicy, flavorful chicken ever! I truly don't get the complaints of it not being sticky, but maybe that's because sticky isn't a trait I admire in food, lol. Loved it, plan to make it often! I'm making it today using Cornish hens!

Made this last night and it is going to become a regular for us!  It had a great flavor & was SOO tender. My husband & 5 year old picky son ate it up (I peeled off the outer, spicy layer before giving it to my son). Thanks for the great recipe!

Update:  13 years later and this recipe is still my main recipe for whole chickens!  I mix up a big batch of the seasoning to use several meals.  I put some pats (2T) of butter under the skin on the breast and melt some butter to brush on the outside.  Put onion and garlic in the cavity then sprinkle spice generously all over the bird.  A 7lb bird takes about 5-6 hours cooking at 250 (275 degrees for the last 45 minutes).

This is awesome. I only used one 5 lb. chicken, cut the seasonings in half, and kept the cook temperature and time the same and it was perfect.Store bought rotisserie is a thing of the past, this is better in my opinion.

I changed this recipe just a little but it was great none the less. I rubbed the chicken with olive oil before i rubbed the spices on. I didn't have white pepper or onion powder on hand (the hubby is allergic to onion anything) added a 1/4 tsp of oregano. I also didn't use the cooking method on this recipe because I was a little pressed for time so I used the Spicy Rapid Roast Chicken recipe from this site. The chicken turned out great!

This is the best roasted chicken I have ever eaten or made. I have tried about five different roasted chicken recipes and this one comes out on the top for sure. The slow cooking allows for a juicy and moist chicken while having a nice crispy outside. The spice rub works really well too and makes for great gravy drippings. Initually I thought the cooking time was a bit long and was really afraid I would end up with a dry roasted chicken, but it was seriously perfect. My three year old had like three helpings and my husband kept nibbeling on it all night. Not a thing I would change about it and this will be our roasted chicken recipe from now on...all the other recipes are going in the trash.

This was fantastic!  I love the method of cooking it long and slow.  It made the chicken-even the breast meat-extremely tender, which made it very easy to carve (something I'm terrible at).  The cayenne might be a little spicy for some, especially on the heavily-skinned pieces, but I thought it was just right.  I can't wait to make this again.  I used a 4.5 pound chicken and it took just under 5 hours to reach 180 degrees.

I made this yesterday, and I was very impressed. I followed the recipe exactly, which must be a first for me, and the chickens came out beautiful! They weren't sticky like store-bought chickens, but dark golden and crispy (which is not a bad thing). My family loved the chicken. Thanks.

This was a great roasted chicken.  I love to get the rotisserie chickens from the store and now I can get the same great flavor from my oven.  I only used one chicken but I kept most measurments the same.  Thanks for the great dinner, Sue...I can't wait for the leftovers!

The best rotisserie chicken!!  I patted the chicken with butter under the skin and on top before adding the seasoning.  I used extra seasoning and left it in the fridge for 3 days... Awesome!!  My boyfriend isn't a fan of rotisserie chicken and he's in love!

I made this yesterday, but used the slow-cooker (I added a tiny bit of liquid chicken broth to the bottom). I also combined all of the spices into about 3 Tbs of butter and rubbed the mixture onto the outside and under the skin of the chicken. It turned out very good – the chicken just fell off the bone! Thanks for the new recipe!

Super good Chicken!  My husband absolutely loved it and he is not a chicken fan.  It made wonderful gravy, in fact my husbands exact words were "some of the best chicken gravy ever."  Which was nice for me, because it was the first time I had ever made gravy.  I only cooked one chicken and was a little short on time so I cooked it for about 2.5 hours at 300.  I basted twice (couldn't help myself).  When you are eating the chicken, the onion flavor is there, but not nearly as prominent as like 45 minutes later when your whole mouth tastes like onion - if you serve for guests, have some MINTS for them!!  Anyways thanks for a great recipe, I will use this time and time again. UPDATE!  Okay so I made this again, and this time I baked it for 5 hours at 250 per the recipe and we didn't like it nearly as much as before - my husband thought the texture was weird.  Also this time I only used part of the onion and used some apple as well, and that was also a mistake, whole onion is needed!  I'm very excited to make it again the way I did the first time!

Good but needed a bit more zip.  I plan to make it again.  Next time I will double the dry rub.

This recipe is simply amazing! I used half of the dry rub on a 2 lb organic chicken.  Hasn't quite thawed out in the cavity (a habit of freezing everything) but went ahead and marinated the chicken anyway, making sure the onion chunks were covered in the seasoning mix.  Had it marinated overnight and roasting in the oven the next day for 6 hours, basting 3 or 4 times after 3 hours.  Due to my odd dyslexia moments, I preheated and baked it for 250 and not 180 degrees. Luckily the chicken came out moist and not dry at all.  I was skeptic on how it would turn out not using butter or oil but like one of the past reviewer noted, NO additional liquid is needed.  I roasted the chicken in a cake pan and after 6 hours, the chicken sweated out and produced its own yummy juice (makes an awesome gravy btw) that covered half of the cake pan!  The juice kept the bird from drying out. By far the best, if not better than the store's deli. Hate to say it but it beats out Whole Food Market by 1 full star.

Oh my goodness!! This is the best chicken I have ever eaten!!

We don't care as much for dark meat so we made this with bone in breasts. We cut the onion and put the onion pieces under each breast piece and seasoned the meat top and bottom. 

We basted the chicken twice during the cooking time (after about 3 and 4 hours) and roasted it altogether for about 4 1/2 hours after letting it sit in the spices for 5 hours. It was fall-off-the-bone tender and the meat was seasoned through and through.

My husband who has never asked me to make a chicken dish has already asked for this one again soon. High praise indeed!!

My husband and I both love this receipe.  We enjoy rotisserie chicken but our bodies don't tolerate the chemicals and preservatives in spice mixes or on store-bought chicken.  I was so happy to find an all natural receipe so we know exactly what we are putting in our bodies!  I usually cut the receipe in half because I cook for two but my husband said he would love to have one of his own!

I revised this recipe to cook individual pieces of the whole chicken. I used the same herbs and spices, but modified (by eyeballing) to season each piece.I baked at about 350-375 for 30-45 mins depending on your oven. The chicken was very moist and flavorful and had the real rotisserie taste.

Although this recipe called to slow cook in the oven, I went ahead and cooked it on the rotisserie on my grill and everyone loved it.

Absolutely fabulous!  I made this recipe for Easter a couple years ago for some family members who can't eat ham.  Everyone loves it and it is now the preferred meat at all of our gatherings!  Thanks for this wonderful recipe.  I'd recommend rubbing the seasonings under the skin... it flavors the meat more.

I have been using this recipe for years and forgotten to rate it.  It is THE BEST roast chicken EVER.  In the summer, I marinate the chicken in the spices and then my husband puts it on the BBQ using the 'beer can chicken' method.

WOW!! If I could give this more stars I certainly would! It was delicious and juicy! I did make a few changes...but very slight ones. I cut back on the salt and used 1/2 of what was called for. I added a little more cayenne, and because I was out of thyme I used oregano instead. I rubbed my chicken with garlic infused olive oil before putting the rub on. I also put 3 cloves of garlic in with the onions. I let it marinade overnight. I roasted breast side up on a roasting rack so the bottom would not get soggy. I only baked one 5 pound chicken. I roasted it at 350 for 4 hours and then I tented with foil and let rest about 20 minutes. It was perfect! The skin was crisp and beautiful. The flavors were not too strong...just right. Most importantly it was super moist and juicy! My family said it was the best roast chicken recipe I have made by far and I had no leftovers at all! So easy and super delicious!!! Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe that will be a family favorite from now on!!! Kudos!

OMG! This was the best chicken ever!
We eat a lot of chicken, and I must have
tried millions of chicken recipes over my 20 years of cooking..This is by far the best and worth the effort. I followed the directions exactly, and got moist..perfectly seasoned chicken.I even turned down the temp to 150 after the 5 hour cooking time, as we weren't ready to eat yet, and it was still wonderful.Thanks for submitting this one. It's a keeper for life!

This was great!! Everybody loved it. Scarfed it down. Salty, though. Need to cut that in half. Not sticky either. I also didn't have 4 hours to wait, so I cooked it the normal way - 375 uncovered for 2 hours. Nice crispy skin. The results of this recipe probably depends on the chicken you get. I got the two pack of Perdue birds from Sam's Club - cheap enough to try out recipes on without going broke if it's bad.

Very good and moist.  I cooked my chicken breast down and covered it for the last hour of cooking and it was soooo juicy.  Next time I think I will cut down on the cayanne pepper though.  I will make this again and again!

fantastic! Even BETTER the 2nd day! I made this chicken, and my grandmother actually sent my uncle over with some of the store bought kind for me independently... and I have to say- The one that I baked was BETTER than the store bought one. On the second day, when the store bought chicken became a bit tough, this one stayed moist and delicous!! Thanks!!! This recipe is a KEEPER!

I liked the spice combination, however, I did not think I tasted the onion flavoring like I thought I would.  The chicken is tender and worth the wait.

This chicken is PERFECT!  I am lazy and didn't bother marinate it the night before and it was still fabulous.  I made a grave out of the drippings and it was yummy and I usually don't like gravy.  I did make the two birds and used one the next day as lunch.  How perfect to cook two meals at once!  Thanks for posting this great recipe.

Looked wonderful.  Smelled wonderful.  Tasted wonderful.  What more can you ask?  My husband and teenage daughter could not stop praising this wonderful chicken.  And the best part?  I put it in the oven and spent the afternoon watching movies!  What a great recipe!  Thanks for sharing.

This chicken was like everyone said it would be--very moist and tender. Although my family loved this chicken, the spice rub wasn't my absolute favorite. I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could. I will definitely be making this chicken again, and trying this slow cooking method for other roast chicken recipes.

Okay- the chicken was really good too but I love the soup you can make from the leftovers of this recipe!  It has so much flavor!  Yummmmm.  The only change I made to the recipe was to double the spices as recommended by others for more bite.

I was disappointed with one - followed the instructions precisely and we found the chicken quite dry. Was my oven too high?  I gave the recipe 2 stars because it tasted better the next day, straight from the fridge.  Only then did the rotisserie flavour really come through.

This recipe was wonderful. My sister made this at my house one night and all of our kids loved it,5 of them between 2 and 9. I also used the leftovers and made a wonderful chicken salad. 1 cup mayonnaise and 1/4 cup pickle relish. This chicken is definitely a 5 star recipe we will be making often.

Great recipe!! I only had 1 chicken and no time for a long marinade. I let it set for only 3 hours and it was still tasty. The meat was seasoned throughout and very moist. My husband had to tell me again today how good the chicken was last night. I made sure to make a triple batch of spice mix to have some quickly on hand. I did cut down on the cayenne pepper because we don't like heat, but that is just personal preference. Thanks

This is an awesome chicken recipe! I used one 4.5 pound chicken, instead of two.I'm only giving it four stars 'cause it was really spicy ! Next time I would cut the red pepper in half. But the chicken itself comes out moist and tender-Perfect!

I have been making this recipe for a couple of years, and my family LOVES it! I tweak mine a bit; we found it a bit too spicy for the little ones, so all I do is half the amount of the "hot" ingredients: paprika, white pepper, ablack pepper, and cayenne pepper. I also cook mine as soon as I rub the spices on. After the first hour of cooking, I baste the chicken every 30 minutes with its own juices. This chicken turns out so fall off the bone yummy!!!

I scaled this down to do one chicken but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Mine was done in about 3 1/2 hours and was absolutely delicious!!  I'll definitely make again!

Absolutely love it! Easy to prepare, the house smells great from the herbs. Leftover chicken makes a great sandwich, just add some mayonaise and fix it up with cos lettuce and cherry tomatomes and you'll get a grand roast chicken sandwich for lunch!

Fantastic chicken recipe!  I replaced the thyme with oregano, eliminated the white pepper, since I didn't have any, and increased the garlic powder to 2 teaspoons.  I also left out the onions--they aren't a favorite around here!!  I forgot to start it on time to allow five hours of cooking, but it cooked for three hours on 275 and thirty minutes at 225, and it was moist and delicious.   I will definitely make this again!

Great recipe -- I accidentally doubled the salt/other seasonings, and it still turned out perfect. I also flipped the bird half way thru roasting. I will definitely make these 'mistakes' again.

This recipe is absolutely with out a doubt the best I have ever had!   I fixed the chickens on a roasting rack and they turned out so perfect the skin was beautifully browned and crispy and I made a chicken gravy for the first time ever from the drippings and it was delicious.  Had the second on for left overs the next day and was even better the second day.  Thanks a lot for this recipe.

This was yummy and the meat was "fall off the bone" tender. My husband raved about this dish all night, so I'll be making it a lot, I'm sure! Packed with flavor and juices...

The FIRST time I did this, it was excellent. The 2nd time, it was a tad dry. I'm not sure what the difference was but since I know it was great the first time, I have to give it 5 stars. Absolutely wonderful!

Other than halving the spices because I was only cooking one chicken (will not make that mistake again...it's great leftover) I didn't change a thing in this recipe. It was juicy, incredibly flavorful & literally falling off the bone! I do wish that I had made some gravy out of the pan juices as others did...sounds yummy.

Absolutly perfect.  I prepared it exactly as the recipe indicates, and I wouldn't change a thing.  It's hard to believe how tender and moist it is after 5 hours of cooking!

Way way too salty.  The meat was tender, but why so salty (even with a pound more than the recipe called for)?  Will not be making again.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was fabulous!  Definitely a weekend recipe, my husband couldn't believe it took that long to cook a 4 lb chicken but admitted it was well worth the wait! Will definitely make again.

I will never roast a chicken any other way!  This is a 10 star recipe!  This really was better than my local grocery store rotisserie chicken that I love.  Excellent!

This is probably one of the best oven roasters I have ever made in regards to taste, moistness, and appearance.  I had a 3.97 lb. Amish roaster chicken and wanted to really do well by it.  I have seen this popular recipe come up in the reviews alot so decided to try.  I am not disappointed.  I halved the spices since only using 1 bird and used 1 1/2 tsp. salt instead of 2 since I also wanted to put some of the spice mixture between the skin and breast.I was leary that all that salt would make the breast meat dry but it was wonderful. Had dehydrated onions and no powder so just used 2 tsp. of them and put them in with my spices and ground with mortel and pestal to a fine powder.  I did add 1/2 tsp. Old Bay and 1/2 tsp. Chicken Barbeque spice I bought by mistake, and 1 tsp. dried thyme.  Put everything in a gallon ziplock overnight in the fridge stuffed with the onion.  Because I had to use my oven for other things, I did bake at 300 degrees w/meat thermometer and after 3.15 hours, it was done.  Added no broth, wine, or water.  Put it on my broiler pan so it was totally 'airborne' and kept brushing the juices on every half hour or so.  I let it rest for 20 minutes before I cut into it and it is incredible. I noticed it does have a sticky texture to the skin as I was cutting it. Wonderful recipe that can be tweaked to suit a particular taste.  I would love to try this "beer can" style sometime; would be great done on the grill spit.

I cooked this at 325 degrees for about 2 hours and the chicken was very moist and flavorful.  Next time I will leave out the cayenne pepper as it was abit too spicy for us.

Excellent.  Smelled wonderful while cooking and tasted great - definitely fall off the bone and moist too!  Just the right amount of spice.  Had basted after being in the oven for three hours, about every 30 to 45 mins until done.  This is definitely another keeper !!!!

So good and tender. I've made this 5 or 6 times, every time with the beer can method so I'm not sure if it would be as good without it " Don't fix it if it ain't broken".

I cut the salt in half and only baked 1 3lb chicken for 3.5 hours. Next time I'll use a little more spice mix and bake for 3:15 or so. This was amazing! I don't eat beef or pork so we cook alot of chicken, and this knocked the socks off any other chicken I've ever made. When I started to carve it, the whole carcass fell apart and I was able to take the onions out through the side!! Thank you so much, I don't know if I'll make chicken the regular way ever again!!!

YUM! I didn't have thyme or white pepper and I didn't allow it to marinate at all. I just rubbed the spices on and shoved it in the oven and it was still outstanding! My family loved eating the onions too! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was awesome. I didn't have time to marinate this as long as it was suppose to, I only had a couple of hours and then I cooked it a 300 for about 4 hours. It was wonderful and the chicken was so tender it was falling off the bones. My husband almost cleaned the chicken the first night barely leaving enough for left overs. 
This is a definite keeper. Thanks for the recipe!!!

Love this chicken.  I cook it for 3 hours, breast down, covered.  Then for 1 hour uncovered, breast down. The final hour, I turn the chicken breast side up and cook uncovered.  It comes out juicy, browned and sticky.  Awesome.

Great recipe.  Didn't read the part where I was suppose to let the chicken sit for several hours once it was spiced, so it didn't get the marination time.  However, I was pleasantly suprised that it didn't really need it.   I added a T. of margarine with the onion, and brushed melted margarine on the outside before I spiced it.  Will definitely make it again.

I used this recipe to cook Cornish hens and they were absolutely delicious. I'm not sure how long it took them to cook ..I used a meat thermometer and cooked until they reached 185 degrees. I've never been much of a fan of Cornish hens but these were so good that I can't wait to cook them again.

This is a great recipe.  I changed the seasonings a bit based on what I had around the house.  I did not have onion powder or white pepper, so I doubled up the garlic powder and black pepper, respectively.  I also used rosemary instead of thyme.  In terms of the cooking, I forgot to put the chicken in the oven five hours in advance.  So, I cooked it at a higher temp for 1.5 hours.  Even after that, it still turned out to be really juicy and soooo yummy.  I can imagine how much better it tastes after slow cooking it.

This was wonderful.  There were no complaints from anyone!  I loaded the bottom of the roasting pan with potatoes, carrots, onions, celery, and mushrooms, then cooked the chicken on top.  The chicken took over 5 1/2 hours and the vegetables had to go back in for another half hour at 350 after the chicken was done,  but it was definately worth the wait.

This recipe is absolutely amazing!  After I cooked the first one I went to the grocery and bought 2 more chickens to cook another for us and one for a friend.  My chicken cooked in only 3 hours.  Maybe my oven is hotter than it says or my chicken was smaller but it was wonderful and had such a beautiful color.  You all must try this!

This recipe is great!  instead of cleaning a whole chicken I just used the seasoning rub on some boneless skinless chicken breasts and cooked them for 20 minutes on 400 and everyone loved it.  Very healthy!

Wonderful. The best part is that there is no oil or butter added to the rub. I followed the recipe exactly (only I halved it to make only one chicken) except that after the chicken sat all night, I took 3 of the onion quarters out so that it would not be too strong. Might leave one more quarter in next time. Oh and I left out the cayenne pepper...too spicy.  Did not baste it, may do it once or twice next time. Had plenty of drippings to use for gravy. Served with mashed red skinned potatoes and green beans.  A COMPLETE SUCCESS!

I cook the chicken(s) a little differently. I use my rotisserie on my grill and it is wonderful and flavorful. I do not use the onion in the cavity. I also rarely remember to marinate ahead of time and it still comes out right. For some that have tried this in the pan and have had poor results, try this trick: use the Reynolds oven bags and put a couple of toothpicks in the top of the chicken so that the bag does not rest on the bird and stick. Off to make a couple for dinner right now.

Excellent.  The first time I made this, I didn't have any time to marinate.  It was good, but not outstanding.  Made sure to marinate overnite on my 2nd try and...OMG -Great!  The flavors really DO get into the meat and it comes out sooo moist.  Be careful not to overcook!  If you do only 1 chicken, be sure to decrease cooking time.  Mine was done in about 4 hours.

I feel bad giving this a bad review after all the good reviews.  Maybe I did something wrong, but my chickens came out awful.  They were very very dry.  I noticed I ended up with a lot of juices in the pan, no carmelizing happened for me..  but I did follow the directions, no idea why mine didnt turn out.

Made this for Sunday dinner and it got rave reviews from everyone! Slow cooking it made it very moist and juicy and the spices were quite flavorful--the only change I would make would be to put a little less seasonings on the legs--that is the kids favorite part and they were a little too spicy for them--I will definetely make it again!

If I knew that making rotisserie chicken was this easy, I would have made it a long time ago.  I always thought I needed a machine to make it, and was so surprised just how easy it was. It was so moist and full of flavor inside and out. I did rub it with oil before I put my spices on it and it came out great. The only thing I will do differently next time is not add the pepper spices. This recipe is definately a keeper.

The Best Chicken EVER!!.. I was short on a few ingredients so I used McCormicks "Montreal Chicken" Grill Mates.  There was
so much flavor and the chicken stay moist
after re-heating.  Will never make roast chicken any other way again!

Great Great recipe-and technique for roasting chicken. Low heat/longer cook time. I made this with chicken peices (a couple of whole breasts, several thighs, and several drumsticks). Cooked for about 3 hours (maybe a tad bit longer) and during the last 45 minutes rubbed alittle margarine under and over the skin of each peice. SOOOO YUMMY!!! My dinnerparty guests RAVED about this! They could not beleive how moist it was, ESPECIALLY the breasts. Will make again and again!!!

As good, if not better, than the rotisserie chicken at the supermarket...this was great! I used a 2 pound chicken, but only halfed the seasoning from the original recipe. Very flavorful. Cooked at 250 for about 2.5 - 3 hours (until chicken was 180 degrees.) Will make again. Sue, thanks for the recipe.

This was awesome!  It really does taste like the supermarket chickens.  It was so tender, moist and flavorful.  My husband and I devoured it.  I did two chickens so I could use the second chicken for pot pie and soup.

This is an excellent, super easy recipe!!! Would not change a thing!! Very authentic-similar to the rotisserie chicken they serve in France. We also put quartered potatoes, carrots and onions (add frozen peas last 10 mins of cooking)in bottom of pan! Delicious! P.S. if you add vegetables, you will need large roasting pan.

This is a fantastic recipe, and I'm someone who loves chicken, and collects and tries many ways to make it. Flavor, texture, moistness are all excellent. It's important to use a 4 lb chicken; cut the time a little if you use a smaller bird so the meat doesn't dry out. I don't care for cayenne pepper, and leaving it out didn't do any harm.  A variation of this recipe is to add the onions in chopped form right before roasting, not the night before. Either way, don't skip the onions; I believe that cooking them inside the cavity adds to both the flavor and moistness of the meat.

I used this recipe with my showtime rotisserie. It is excellent.  I only marinated for about 1 hour. It comes out sticky and crispy. It's delicious. We make it often.

Wonderful, just wonderful.  I cooked just one chicken (Perdue 5 lb Roaster), added a can of chicken broth to the pan 1/2 way thru, started basting every 20 minutes.  The skin turned a wonderful crispy brown and was sticky just like the roasted chickens purchased in the stores.  This is now my #1 roasted chicken recipe.  Thanks!

I made this recipe on the fly, so I didn't follow the cooking directions written in the recipe. The spice blend, however, was incredible, and the meat still came out pretty moist in spite of cooking it in only an hour and a half. I can't wait to try it again and follow the recipe to the letter. Thanks for posting this one!

This rub mixture has become a staple in our home.  In a family with four children it is difficult to cook a dinner that everyone likes, but I make this chicken the day before we have a busy evening everytime (usually once a week to every two weeks)to no complaints and make soup, wraps or sandwiches with the leftovers.  The only thing I do differently is add more garlic as we do love garlic!!!  I"ve never had it turn out sticky, but our family loves it all the same!

All I can say is "WOW!". I only had a small chicken so I cooked it for 31/2 hours and it was perfect. I also drizzled a little maple syrup over the chicken which made it a bit sticky just like a rotisserie chicken. Also added 3 cloves of garlic in the cavity to give it that extra boost. A definate must try, you'll love it!

I liked the method of cooking very much.  I will do that again for sure.  I'm not sure the seasoning and refrigerating over night is necessary for this, so I will skip that step next time.  The chicken came out moist and delicious. 
Thanks for the post!

Better than any supermarket roasted chicken, better than Costco's also.  My family is gah-gah over this recipe.  The aroma is wonderful.  I add 1 cup water at the bottom of the roasting pan and make sure to baste the chicken regularly during the 5 hours.  Before serving, I slice the chicken breast nicely and place them into the juices to absorb the most wonderful flavors, then I transfer all the pieces to serving tray and pour more of the juices over it all.  Rave Reviews guaranteed.  Thank you

This was great; worked perfectly. My picky husband loved it, I loved it, and I even served it to my mother-in-law. She raved about it. I had never baked a whole chicken before and this made it so simple. I rubbed the spices on about 6 hours before cooking, and did one chicken for four hours. I mixed the spices the night before and put them in a baggie. So the prep was very quick the next day. I will definitely make this again.

Excellent recipe. I used on fryer chicken and put it in my showtimer rotissier for 2 hours. It was unbelievably delicious. I wanted to make it again, but only had leg quarters, so I tried it anyway, again, it was outstanding. I cooked them in the oven this time at 250 for 4 hours, then broiled for 15 minutes to let the skin get crispy. The chicken fell off the bone.

Yum, yum, YUMMY!! And so tender and moist! My whole family liked this. As with many other reviewers, I cut this recipe in half to only cook one chicken. It only took 4 hours roasting time to cook thoroughly - 5 hours would have been too long for one chicken. (Cooking two would be nice for company or leftovers)

This recipe was easy and turned out awesome tender chicken.  I basted the chicken about once an hour.  The following day leftovers were turned into chicken salad.  For melt in the mouth chicken, just like store bought rotisserie style, I must recommend this recipe.

I followed this recipe as written.  The flavor on the chicken was excellent.  I was surprised at how moist the chicken remained after 5 hours.  I will definitely make again, however, I will put the chicken on a rack inside the roasting pan so the bottom isn't stewing in the juices.

WOW!  Like many others before me, this is the best chicken I have ever made!  I followed the recipe to a "T", however, my chicken was fully cooked in 4 hours.  It was soooooo good.  It tasted just like the hot rotisserie chicken you get at the grocery store.  My husband loved it!

Loved it!!!  Confused as to why the word sticky is in the name, though.  There was nothing sticky about my chicken.  The taste was incredible, though.  And I only did one chicken.  Took 4 hours for me, but I'm sure that's due to only using one chicken and oven variances.  so we ended up eating it at room temperature because I had to wait on the rest of dinner to cook.  Thank you for sharing such a flavorful chicken recipe that I will be making again!!!

The spice rub was tasty and the chicken came out tender.  I think I'll use this rub when I try my hand at beer can chicken this summer.

This chicken was very good.  4 hours cooking time was definitely enough.  We basted it about 4 times.  Beautiful dark brown color with lots of delicious juice.  Heavy grease and fat on the juice, but just skim that off.  Added 2 cloves of garlic and onions in each cavity. rapped it in plastic and let it marinate overnight.  Next time I will add a little more cayenne and garlic powder since we like things very spicey.  The spice blend tastes very much like poultry seasoning with the extras added in. I will definitely make this again.

5 stars for this great recipe. I didn't weigh the chickens -- I just bought a bag of two hens at Sams Club. I actually cooked for six hours. The meat fell off the bones. Everybody loved this. I ended up using Lawry's Perfect Blend  seasoning and rub since the ingredients were the same except for the cayenne.

The flavor was excellent but the breast meat was a little dry.  Will try it next time with a shorter cooking time and will use a thermometer.

Put whatever spices and seasonings you want with this recipe as it will always turn out wonderful. The secret for tender and mouth watering chicken is the slow cooking process. Have a blast making this and thanks Sue for a great recipe and a wonderful gravy to boot!

Roasted a four pound chicken following the directions exactly.  The only change I made was to put a few pats of butter under the skin.  The flavor was yummy, but the chicken was dry.  I boned it completely and used the meat in Brunswick Stew.

WOW! WOW! WOW! This is the best chicken I have ever made and chicken is one of my specialties (or so I thought until now!)My husband flipped over this - I did add 1/2 lemon & 4 garlic cloves to the cavity along w/the onion. I let the chicken rest for about 45min to 1 hour - the meat was falling off the bone - delicious! Gravy was also excellent! 5 Hours - Perfect!! Thank you! I'll keep This forever & ever!!

This was good but the chicken was kind of dry, especially the next day.  We're big chicken eaters, and I had to force myself to finish this small chicken off.  The flavor of the spice rub, however, is outstanding.

I made this for Christmas dinner and received many rave reviews.  The chicken was so juicy and flavorful.  The folloiwng week, I used the same seasonings for a small turkey roast, which was a wonderful way to wake up boring turkey.

Great way of roasting a chicken!  The skin was nice and crispy, and the meat was tender and moist.  I added a couple of pieces of butter under the skin of the breast, which I think helped with keeping the chicken nice and juicy.

Everyone loved this chicken. My boyfriend ate it for dinner, had it on a sandwich for a midnight snack and had some for lunch the next day too. I followed the recipe exactly. My first time roasting chicken and it came out perfect. Definitely a keeper. I might play around with the spices for next time.

I loved the method of baking the chicken on a low temp for an extended amount of time.  The flavor of the spice mixture just wasn't what I was hoping for -- it seemed to have a strange aftertaste (maybe the onion?).  I think the next time I use this method, I'll try a garlic/pepper type rub with fresh lemon stuffed in the cavity.

I used drumsticks instead a whole chicken.  The seasonings really made the chicken much more flavorful.  If using simple cuts of chicken, you'll want to cut the time in the oven since it will not take as long to cook.  The result wasn't really like "restaurant style rotissere chicken", but it was very tasty and a healthier alternative to frying!  Thanks for sharing!

I'm not a fan of baked chicken, so I thought I'd try this and see if I liked it. I did. I actually used the rotissery in my toaster oven, and I got an excellent chicken out of it. Two, really. I roasted two of the smallest chickens, not actually classified as Cornish game hens, that I could find. I didn't plan far enough ahead to refrigerate, just stuck them on the spit with one small whole onion for each chicken and let them twist in the heat. I did cut the cayenne in half. This will join the rotation at my house. Thanks for sharing, Sue!

I did forget to place the chicken in refrigerator over night, but it turned out pretty good.  Chicken was tender. I placed a lemon inside the chicken with the onion.  Will make it again, following all of the steps next time.

The flavor of this chicken was great and the dark meat was very moist, but the breast was a touch dry.  I only left it in the oven for 4 1/2 hours, maybe 4 hours would work better and check it with a meat themometer.  I will definitely make this again and play with different seasonings as well.

I place this in the slow cooker on thick sliced onions.  Also place onion and 1/4 to1/2 Apple inside.  Place on high for six hours check temperature of chicken then continue for 1 - 2 more hours.  You will have a lot of juice from the chicken, you may remove the juice, with a baster or continue cooking in r

Loved. Most moist chicken I've ever cooked. And to the guy who says he may as well go buy a rotisserie chicken to save on time, sure you can  do that, if you don't love to cook.

Hi there, I made this last night and I was impressed by the results. It was flavorful, moist and the skin was crispy. I see some reviews were saying 5 hours is too long but for me it was accurate and I was cooking one chicken. I also was checking the temperature after 2 1/2 hours and then again around 4 hours. So each person's oven varies and you do what is best for your oven. Use the 5 hours as a gage as to how long you should roast it in the oven. And I am glad to see I can rotisserie a chicken when I want to. Thank you.

The spices used in this recipe were perfect. The only thing I didn't use was the cayenne, because I am a super wuss.

Made it exactly as described. Fantastic, moist, flavorful. My oven has a probe attachment, which I set to 170F. Good thing I did because I fell asleep right as I put the chickens in the oven. Woke up 3.25 hours later and the oven had just shut off and the chickens were done absolutely perfectly. So glad I didn’t leave them roasting for 5 hours. This one’s a keeper.

Buying a store bought rotisserie chicken is probably cheaper and easier. but this was good!: I would cut the salt next time. i used my oven thermometer probe and my chickens were at 180 degrees in 3.5  hours! 5 hours would've been a disaster.  Both chickens were perfectly roasted and very moist. I shred  one chicken and froze the shredded meat for future meals. Served with some roasted root veggies and it was a very nice dinner on a cold night!

So stinkin yummy!! My family absolutely loved it! I did make alterations- I took the advice to leave out white pepper, half the cayenne and paprika (I have a kid that doesn’t like too much spice), and do a full tsp of garlic powder. I also did chicken breast instead and marinated everything with a can of chicken broth over night. Baked the breasts at 350* for 30 minutes. I will definitely be making this again and again and again!

this is an absolutely amazing recipe! I follow it exactly aside from making more dry rub than the recipe calls for so I can use it all the time! make sure not to skip the overnight marinating and stuffing the onion in. In a pinch once i roasted the bird without letting it sit overnight and it wasnt nearly as good and flavorful.  the drippings from this make the best gravy, I use the fat to make a rue then add the juice topped up to 2 cups and a splash of wine. soooooo good! thanks for this recipe. it's a staple in our fall/winter meals.

Tried this. Skin was rubbery. Tasted great though. Just needs to be baked at higher temperature.

I made this today and cooked the chicken on the rotisserie setting of my air fryer oven. It was amazing! I didn't have time to let it sit but the skin was still super crispy and had great flavor. Will use less salt next time if unable to set in fridge for a while. Thank for the recipe!!

I have made this several times before as written but wasn't quite satisfied with it, the skin always seemed dry without being really crispy.  Today I put a few pats of cold butter under the skin and basted it with the pan juices.  A definite improvement, although I've yet to think its anything like rotisserie chicken.  I will continue to make it again, but I think I'll try some sage in place of some of the thyme.  Also, I made a gravy from pan drippings.  Those drippings have a lot of good flavoring.

I used an actual rotisserie for this recipe, modifying it so that I had plenty of leftover to baste the chicken -- just in case. Starting off on high heat for 10 minutes, I turned the grill burners to low, put an aluminum foil "boat" to catch the juices. I let it go 2 hours like this until the internal temp hit between 160 and 180.

The chicken was pull apart tender, though strictly speaking, that was the result of a 4 hour brine; no-brine=dry chicken; brine=incredibly juicy chicken. But I liked this recipe. I'll try it again with a few minor modifications to suit my own tastes.

It looks and smells amazing!  I'm so glad to have this recipe. I never feel completely comfortable with the precooked ones from the store since I don't know what all they put in them.  They are easy but, I really don't like preservatives and additional chemicals. I can't wait to taste this version! It is very easy to make!

I used this recipe for seasoning and it was really good. 
With my chicken already brine overnight, I was looking for something other than salt and pepper and found this recipe. It was delicious. I cut half the salt (cus the brine) the rest stayed the same except I used smoked paprika and into the Ronco it went.

Excellent!!  1almost 5lb chicken was done in 3 1/2 hrs. So moist, flavorful and juicy.  Saved the broth for the Pork Medallion from this site as recommended.  Can't wait to make again!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

it was good, don't get me wrong; but it was very like a typical rotisserie chicken. if that's what you're looking for, it's a winner. but i'd just as soon as pick one up at the grocery.

Loved this!! Only two of us,so halved the recipe for one chicken and it’s soooo tasty.  I like the idea of premaking the seasoning, but struggled with how much to use at a time/chicken.

I followed the recipe exactly except I added minced garlic.  The chicken was very juicy when I cut into it and the meat was juicy, tender and  literally fell off the bone.  Not exactly rotisserie chicken as the skin was very dry, but we peeled it off and tossed it anyhow.  Like one reviewer said she added minced garlic, I did also, to the inside cavity and also all over the outside because we love garlic. Overall the flavor was good and the meat was juicy and fall apart tender.  Just wish the skin wasn’t so dry and tough.

Delicious chicken.  I adjust the cooking time depending on the size of the bird I get. Sometimes I will mince a couple of garlic cloves and throw them in with the onions.

This is the EXACT rub recipe I use on my rotisserie chicken. I typically use my rotisserie for this (although I do not season and wrap for a couple of hrs). I, too, like many, don't use the white pepper as I don't keep on hand. Today, I go low and slow in the oven as I am making two larger birds. Cannot wait to eat. Never received a negative comment. Perfect.

Wonderful flavor and tenderness.  Didn’t take the full five hours to reach 180 degrees so advise always use a thermometer.  I always sprinkle Wondra in roasting pans and add the stick off giblets to make great gravy.  Will definitely add to cool weather cooking list.

Excellent!  I took Maria P. Black's suggestion and increased the serving size to 48 (ignore the onion and chicken quantiies).  That gave perfect rounded cups and tablespoon sizes and resulted in just under a cup and a half of seasoning; probably enough to cook at least eight chickens.

Have to be honest...I wasn't expecting much..just trying to find a half decent roast chicken recipe. I didn't have time to marinade. It really didn't matter. Shoved the onion and some garlic cloves into the chicken. Used the spice to give it a good COMPLETE rub covering. Slow roast at 250. Wow!!! This was great.  Nice and crispy and flavorful. Cooked breast side up until the last hour. Emptied most of the juice for gravy and turned over. Be careful of over cooking . Also I didn't need to use all the seasoning to get a good coating.  Definitely a MAKE AGAIN!!

Made this following recipe to the letter.  I made a double batch of dry rub (only made one chicken) and applied it inside, outside and even under the breast skin.  Marinated 20 hours in the fridge prior to cooking.  Chicken only took 4 hours to reach proper temperature.  Let it rest 1/2 hour while I made mashed potatoes to go with it.  The chicken texture was fine, but the flavor was so bland, it was like I had never marinated it at all.  Pretty disappointed.  P.S. It tasted nothing like rotisserie chicken.

I followed the directions as written. After three hours, I sliced into the chicken to see if it was cooked and it was still pink in the center. It took another hour to cook fully. Afterward, it was dry and all the flavor was in the skin. It didn’t fall off the bone as other reviewers stated, and it tasted nothing like rotisserie chicken, not even close. If I ever make this again, I’ll put it in the slow cooker instead. But I’m much more likely to just buy a rotisserie chicken.

This chicken was pretty bland and turned out extremely dry. Perhaps my oven is not calibrated correctly, but I think if I took it out after 3 1/2 - 4 hours it would have been better.

excellent chicken recipe. made as what the recipe called for. no tweeks.  When done i cut the chicken into pieces and let the white meat just bast in the pan with the seasoned juices.  There was no plain meat flavor .The leftovers, i stored in vaccum sealed bags and placed in freezer for later use for chicken pot pie or chicken noodle soup.

Super easy to make, just stick it in the oven and forget about it until it's done. I love the crispiness of the skin when it's done.

I used to have a recipe called "Mimi's Sticky Chicken" that was this, but just with one chicken instead of two. It's delicious.

Great recipe made exactly as written. Be sure not to skip the step of allowing the chicken to absorb the rub in the refrigerator overnight. This is an excellent no fail recipe.

Great seasoning blend, however, I omitted the white pepper and used extra black pepper in its place.  I also covered the chicken with foil and baked at 325 degrees. The last 25 minutes of cooking I removed the foil and upped the temp to 425 for a golden brown finish-perfection!

I make this recipe exactly as it is written. Once in a while I use all chicken breasts. I let the spices sit on the chicken usually about 24 hours. Perfect.

First, and most important, you do not cook poultry for a set amount of time, you cook until an internal temperature is reached.  With this recipe, 180 degrees fahrenheit.  I have used an inexpensive Acurite model 00993ST for years.  $25.00.  Or, google "Best digital meat thermometers" and pick your own.  Second, your oven temperature.  I would make a bet I think is safe that most ovens are not within 20 degrees of what you set it at.  I used my Thermoworks IR-GUN-S laser infrared thermometer to check my oven.($33.00) A word about oven thermometers.  The mercury bulb type are almost impossible to read. The round bi-metal stripe type are wildly inaccurate.    Put an empty small ceramic dish, like a ramekin, in the oven, and put on 250 degrees.  Aim the laser on it.  Mine settled on 220 .  So I had to set it on 280 in order to get 250.  (As you can probably tell by now, I take my cooking very seriously)  For my 4+ pound chicken, it took 3hrs 45min to come to 180 degrees.  NOT 5 hours.  It turned out great, but would have been like shoe leather after 5 hours.

I have learned over the years to treat recipes as inspirational guidelines, not gospel.  Happy Cooking.

I've made this many times, it's always great! I've even made it with turkey and it came out great!  I do a couple of additions.  I add onions in the cavity along with the celery.  I carefully separate the skin from the breast using fingers flat against the breast.  I spread 1/4 cup of softened butter or margarine in-between the skin and the meat, carefully making sure the skin doesn't tear.  This makes the white meat on the breast extra tender and tasty.  Everyone loves it every time!

This recipe is awesome and way better than any store bought chicken.  I've been using this for some years now.  I use it for my Thanksgiving turkey and the seasoning combination is awesome for making the tastiest gravy.

Delicious, moist and flavorful. I followed recipe exactly with 1 6 pound chicken instead of two 3-4 pounders. I applied rub inside cavity and popped and onion and a few cloves of garlic in the cavity, and added rub under skin and all over top of skin. I wrapped it in saran wrap and let it sit in the fridge overnight. I placed it in my crock pot on low for about 6 hours....All I can say is , PERECTION...Thank you for this recipe....!!

I was surprised I had not rated this previously. It is a wonderful recipe, and in the past I have made it often. Fantastic as written. I make a couple of small changes: I use one large (5-6 lb) chicken, and after the dry brine step I put in the crockpot on low for usually about ten hours. Time intensive, but so worth it!

This is a keeper! Best roast chicken I’ve ever had! I did as another reviewer recommended and made the seasoning in bulk. (Changed the serving to 64) Gave some to several neighbors who enjoy grilling and they request more.

I followed recipe exactly. After I got the onion inside the cavity, I tied the legs with twine. Chicken turned out moist and tender. I believe the baking technique is the same as a slow cooker except chicken comes out wet from a slow cooker, but from the oven, you get a crisp roasted chicken. After I removed the chicken from the pan, I made gravy with the drippings, cornstarch, chicken bouillon and water. I am definitely going to make again and experiment with other spices.

I halved the recipe and made one 3.5 lb bird, which roasted for about 4 hours. I've made some pretty good roast chicken in the past, but this was hands-down the juiciest. And the gravy from the drippings was out of this world too.

Put the rub on and the onion in just before putting in the oven. Baked for 4 hours at 250 but the skin wasn't crispy and the temp was only 160, so I put it under a 450 broiler for 20 min. Skin got a bit too brown - 15 min would have been perfect. Crispy skin was delicious. Everyone liked this.

I love this recipe.  I did make it as stated the first time, then tailored it to my family's taste (sub seasoned salt for some of the salt, upped the garlic and onion powder and used smoked paprika).  I season and stuff the chicken, then freeze it.  When ever I'm ready, so is my chicken!  I also use this misture on chicken pieces.  I add a little water and use it as a marinade.  We love it!

I have never had a roasted chicken that tasted so good. There are 3 adults in my family and we ate almost the whole thing. Juicy and tender. Can't wait to make it again.

I’ve been making recipes from Allrecipes for years and I think this is the very first time I ever reviewed a recipe. This rub was fantastic! It was a LOT of ingredients and I thought it was going to overpower the chicken but it was perfect. I didn’t change a thing.

This was soooooo good ! I halved the recipe as I was only making one chicken - 3.5 pounds - also didn’t have white pepper but didn’t really worry about that . I cooked at 250 for 4 hours, amazing chicken, so tasty ! I made gravy with the drippings , just heated the drippings until bubbling, whisked in some flour and added water from potatoes I cooked and then roasted, I didn’t have any chicken stock and honestly, the flavours were so good it didn’t need stock , water was just fine! DELICIOUS! I will be rubbing my Christmas turkey with this as well !!! And an onion in the cavity - so so good!! And so easy

AMAZING!!! I don't use the salt, personal preference with all recipes. I use thighs & legs and usually cook btw 8-10 lbs at 275. Because it's smaller pieces it only takes a few hours till fall-off-the-bone done.  A+++ recipe!

This is a fantastic recipe. I did not change a thing and it is always great! the chicken has a crunchy spicy skin and the meat is well flavored, moist and fall of the bone tender. We eat it as "rotisserie" chicken the first night and use the leftovers to make pulled BBQ chicken sandwiches the following evening. Thanks for sharing this GREAT recipe

OK, I followed the recipe unlike some other people who said "I followed the recipe except i used parts of chicken and a crock pot". Guess what?? that's not the recipe! Yes, you can (and I did) add a few extra spices or leave out the white pepper (who has it?) but the main thing is a whole chicken scrubbed out, seasoned inside and out and baked at 250 degrees  uncovered for 4 to 5 hours depending on size of chicken and your oven. Mine came out perfect obviously because I gave it max stars. I cooked mine while I was on the golf course. Came home and took temps in the thickest part and it was 165 to 170. I then basted, covered with aluminum foil and put it  back in the still warm but NOT ON oven until dinner. No dry meat (even the breast was moist). Simply delicious. Better than any grocery store but not as good as Pollo Lucas in Mexico. But a lot closer  and more convenient.

I loved the flavor of the chicken, and the gravy was divine! Next time I will used smaller chickens though. My grandson actually thought I had used small turkeys for this, and they took forever to cook...lol. (my bad) Recipe is a keeper.

Made this recipe almost as written, but since it was too warm out today to fire up the oven, I used the rotisserie on my grill. The chicken was moist and not dry; flavor was as wonderful as it smelled. I only made a few changes since we were using the rotisserie: (1) mixed the seasoning with about 1/4 cup melted butter to baste the chicken. Then, we continued basting occasionally with the pan drippings; (2) did not refrigerate for the 4-6 hours and I don't think it is a necessary step even if I made it in the oven, but I'll have to try that another day. To do this on the rotisserie: tie the legs and wings and just follow the manufacturer instructions for temperature and method. You'll need indirect heat and put a pan underneath to catch the drippings. Removed chicken from rotisserie when temp reached 165 F and tented with foil to let rest. The flavor of the seasoning mix for the chicken was excellent for us. Next time I'd like to put a little seasoning between skin and breasts to get a little more flavor on the meat as we usually do. Overall, very good and will make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

Good tasting but it's just a baked chicken. There was no rotisserie .  And it wasn't sticky.  But it did taste good.

The only part of this recipe that I used was the cooking time.  Aside from that, I brined my bird overnight and roasted it for the 5 hours this recipe called for.  Overall, a good recipe if you had 5 hours to spare.

Love it. I used just one chicken for all the spice, but it’s seriously delicious. I was worried about cooking whole chicken, since this is the first time I tried, but it went soo well and was so easy. I’ve made it so many times now, I use the meat for salads, enchiladas, anything you’d need chicken for! Or we sometimes just devour the chicken. It’s super juicy! A staple in my house now!

Even if you didn't plan in advance enough to season it, you can still season it and stick it directly into the oven.  It's still AMAZING!

I made this using 2 large bone in chicken breasts.  I sliced an onion and laid the chicken on top of it.  Baked THEM at the stated 250 for a little over 2 hours. Used the drippings to make gravy. 
Definitely will be making this again.

I think this is a good base from which great dishes can be made. My wife found the recipe to be bland. I believe that every recipe should be tried as directed once so next time maybe I'll add other herbs to make it more flavorful.

We made it a couple of times now  and depending on the birds it comes out great! 
Sometimes it yields drippings which will be made into gravy by adding a teaspoon cornstarch and butter (or olive oil) and cooking it in a griddle.

We tweaked it by doubling the seasoning except the salt and peppers. We like it even better then.

Wow! So tender and tasty!! I added minced garlic in the cavity with the onion. And when it says to season, wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hrs, do It. It makes a difference. I prep mine the night before, then bake the next evening. The drippings make the BEST gravy. Would definitely recommend.

I made one 6 lb chicken, it took about 4hrs @ 250. Meat was so tender and skin was perfectly crisp, not at all chewy. I didn’t follow the recipe to a T, and by not marinating my chicken like it instructs, I lost a ton of flavor. I did however add carrot, celery and garlic so that somewhat made up for my lack of spices... I think next time I will double up on the spices, you lose a lot from the plastic wrap. Overall, this will be my go-to method from now on.

I followed the recipe exactly and it didn’t end up sticky as the name says, just a bunch of dried spices and herbs on equally dry skin. The chicken did come out tender but if I wasn’t on Mat leave and had the time to throw this in the oven and wait, I personally don’t think this is worth 5 hours of baking. I may attempt again and read reviewers changes to see if that works, but it really wasn’t that big of a deal this first go.

I find this to be too peppery but still awesome. Just cut back on the pepper if you don't like much.

This would have 5 stars but the internal temp is 'old school'  When internal temp reached 165 degrees I took it out and covered lightly with tin foil for 10 min.  Temp rose to nearly 170 and it was really juicy.  I also added some garlic to the bird cavity.  I will make this again and again because the spice mix is perfect.

Followed the recipe as closely as possible. I even had white pepper which added a delicious fragrance to the chicken! I didn't have a full tsp of dried thyme but I used as much as I had. I didn't have time to marinate overnight, but I was able to marinate the chicken with the spices (wrapped in cling wrap) for about 3-3.5 hours.  I roasted at 275 for the first 45 minutes, then lowered to 250 degrees for about 3 more hours. It was perfect! Delicious, flavorful, juicy, perfect chicken! Hubby loved it as well. Will definitely make again!

Great recipe, have been using it for years. I let it sit int he fridge at least over night with the dry rub and onion. I also put tabs of butter under the skin before baking, makes the meat very tender and moist. I also cover my roasting pan which keeps it from drying out.

This recipe was fantastic.  The seasoning mix is now a make ahead that we use on other things.  I did make 1/2 the paprika smoked & 1/2 regular, because I ran out.  It added the perfect little smoke flavor.

I covered the chicken with a lid on the roaster. It was delicious! A little salty, but fall off the bone tender.

I followed the recipe and marinated it over night. I had one five and a half pound chicken. Baked it for 4 hours but it probably would have been done in three or three and a half.  It was fall off the bone deliciousness.  My husband thought it was a store bought roasted chicken.  Don't bake a whole chicken very often since it's only the two of us but next time I do it will definitely be this recipe.  Thank you for sharing.

This recipe is really good! My changes: 1) I replaced the white pepper with another 1/4 tsp black pepper. 2) It only took 4.5 hours for my 4.3-lb chicken to come up to temperature. I'm glad I checked it early because the breast meat was a LOT moister than that of the chicken in the video. Then again I only baked one chicken...maybe if I'd done two it would have taken longer? Anyway, I made extra seasoning so I'll have it on hand when (not if) I make this again. Thanks!

Cooking this today! Simple so far, just had to use minced garlic. My husband got that instead of garlic powder. We all know how that goes. I will check back in after it’s done.

Turned out great.  I didn't read all directions and confused how much marinade and cooking time you need.  So I had to improvise.  Seasoned the same and marinated for same amount of time.  Cooked on the grill, using a Weber " beer can" accessory.  Filled the bottom with chicken stock. Tasty!

Great flavor! I used a 4 lb. chicken and roasted for about 4 hours. The skin came out chewy rather than crispy though. I like my chicken skin super crispy so I may brush on melted butter as it roasts next time.

First attempt on this recipe and I was worried that it would dry out because there were no drippings. The juice stayed in the chicken. Turned out unbelievably delicious.

Cooking to 180 degrees is WAY too overdone. It is perfectly safe to stop at a lower temperature. I usually cook to 165 degrees but if you are excessively concerned about safety, cook until the internal temp measures 170 degrees.

I am giving this a 5 rating as the flavor was delicious!  I do however, think my chicken selection was terrible which led to a rubbery bird with inedible skin.  After googling rubbery chicken, it appears my bird selection was the culprit.  I purchased a 7 lb bird with an unknown brand name.  Other than the texture, I would definitely make this again.  I would choose fresh chickens if possible and with the lowest injection rate possible.  I used this chicken to make chicken enchilada's, chicken salad and as an addition to my dogs food.  Everyone was happy!

This was phenomenal. I used it on one chicken not two. I sprinkled about 2/3 over the entire outside of the chicken and the last 1/3 on the inside. Then I took a large onion, stuffed it inside and put it in the fridge to marinate for overnight. Then I cooked it in a rotisserie (without the onion of course) and oh my god, I'm obsessed. It was perfection!

I followed the recipe as given, except for reducing the salt to 3 tsp.  Even with that change, I still found it to bed too salty.  Overally, there was nothing special about the taste.  I won't be using this recipe again.

My family has made this recipe for decades. It is by far the BEST chicken I have ever eaten. So good that I keep the spice mix made up on a regular basis. When I don't have five hours to cook a whole chicken, I use the spice mix on chicken pieces and bake at 350 for about two hours. I call it "Cheater Sticky Chicken"!

the combination of the spice mixture and slow-roasting make this a great recipe.  while i can tell that the original recipe is out-of-the-park good, i made a few slight modifications for one reason or another: my mom had a tooth pulled recently so i subbed ancho chili powder for the cayenne and i also subbed in smoked paprika. i also pulled up the skin a little and put the rub underneath as well as on top. finally, i rubbed a little bit of olive oil on the bird just before popping it in the oven. golden brown and delicious!

This is truly the best chicken I have ever made. I followed the directions exactly. I knew there was no way I was going to be able to leave that chicken alone in the oven for 5 hours so I actually left the house while it was cooking. I thought for sure I would come home to a dry husk of chicken. Instead it was wonderful! All of my extremely picky children ate this and there are very few meals I can say that about. I even made this for Thanksgiving instead of a turkey. It was the most relaxing Thanksgiving I've had. I just made it the night before and heated up my side dishes right before I took the chickens out of the oven.

I had a smaller chicken, just over 3 pounds, so I cooked it for 3 1/2 hours and it was very moist and very tender. With the exception of cutting the salt back to 1/4 tsp I made this as written. The end result wasn't sticky or rotisserie  style but very tasty non the less. I love that it's made with ingredients that are always in the pantry. I used a slurry and mushroom broth to make the gravy and it was excellent. I will definitely make this again, thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe.

This was really good, I didn't put it in the fridge for 4 hours because I didn't allow enough time, so I only let it sit for about an hour and it was still good.  I only used 1 chicken and cooked it for 3 1/2 hours; however I think that was too long because it was a little dry.  It was sticky though.

I have made this many times.  It is delish!  Today I stuck the onion in the cavity and trussed it, forgot to season the inside.  Hoping it still is flavorful.  "Of all the things I've lost, I miss my mind the most."  (Mark Twain)

We now make this chicken at least every two weeks.  I even do it in the crock pot on super busy days.  Turns out wonderful either way.

The seasoning mix is what it's all about. It is fantastic.  But I will admit that I don't bake the chicken in the oven.  I actually truss and rotisserie it on my gas grill.  I also double the spices and use one chicken. My wife and kids would request this every week If I let them.

This spice rub is perfectly delicious. The only change I made in addition to halving the recipe so I could prepare one chicken was to add 2 cloves of garlic to the onion in the bird's cavity. I roast the chicken breast-down to keep it moist, and the drippings make excellent gravy. This is the only way my family wants their roast chicken now. Thanks so much for sharing this!

Very good...followed recipe, thought spices would be overwhelming but not at all. Skin crisp and edible. Great the next day in chicken salad. Best roast chicken recipe ever. Trick is to really let it roast for five hours. Do not baste or open oven door. Fantastic. Thank you.

Didn't care for this at all. Bitter flavor because of too much thyme. Needed some type of sugar real bad! Brought leftovers for lunch today and am thinking about getting something from the cafeteria instead!

We liked this but not as much as we do the way I normally roast a chicken and in less time. We tried it, we liked it, but did not love it. Thanks for the recipe but we'll just stick to my way of roasting it.

I made this for a Sunday dinner today. It was fabulous. So tender and moist. I didn't have white pepper so I increased the black pepper. That's the only change I made.  Incredible!  Honestly. The chicken fell off the bones. We were very happy with this.

Sue Rogers, you're a chicken genius! haha.  This will be one of a couple of new recipes in the arsenal.  I did one chicken instead of 2 and lessened the spices (preference) and I'm so glad I tried this recipe. The BEST part??? LESS MESS in the oven!  Hardly any spatters and I have a Stainless Steel oven (electric) that  I can't use steel wool on - it's only oven cleaner and a rag...and elbow grease.  So I am beyond THRILLED to have this "new" method at my disposal.  I bought a 6.5 pound chicken and mine took just under 5 hours with an electric (not convection) oven. I have tried this "dry brine" trick before on pork shoulder. Salt all over, wrap and refrigerate overnight and the meat explodes with juiciness. The magic is more of the salt's doing but the rest of the spices are terrific, including the white pepper. Thanks so much!  **Have made this 2 more times with one being parts only, not the whole bird. GREAT!**

I made this as written and it marinated for two days. I was worried about it being too strong or spicy for my in laws, both in their 80's. but it was fine. I really enjoyed the flavor and so did they. It was a hit. I normally brine my chicken but this was good without being in a 24 hr brine. The only thing I did different is I buttered under the breast skin and I sprayed oil on the chicken about three different times during cooking. It was looking a little dried out. I think it helped. The skin was fine.  I keep oil in a spray bottle for my air fryer. I will make this again and again. Very very good.

I made this just as directed. Chicken turned out juicy and tasty. But the skin was like leather - maybe it was the chicken and not
The roasting - I would try this again.

Made this just like the recipe but with a 6.5 lb roaster. Preped it Saturday night and in the oven at 930 on Sunday. The internal temp stalled at about 165 at 5 hours then in the last hour went right to 180 at 6 hours. I did go to convection on the last hour, that really helped to crisp up the skin.  Once I let it rest I removed the breasts, leg/thighs and wings. The wish bone pulled right out and I was also able to remove the back meat with no effort. I've been cooking for years and this is the best oven roasted chicken I have ever made. It was juicy, flavorful and the skin was to die for haha ?? sorry Dr Darzev, had to eat it. Can't say enough about it. If you don't like a little bite, leave out to cayenne. Great recipe!  I'm going to try this on the smoker to see how that goes.

Made it exactly as recipe dictated. It was good, but nothing special. I only made one whole, 5-lb chicken and the rest of the family of four ate very little of it, probably threw out 1/3 of it the next day. Left it in the refrigerator for four hours - maybe it needed longer for the flavor to imbed - mine just tasted like regular roast chicken..

I've made this twice. We love it! The chicken just falls off the bone. And I love that I can put it in the oven and get on with my day. I do add extra garlic and the paprika I have is "sweet smokey paprika". Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely spectacular! I made this exactly to the instructions and the chicken truly did have a roasted flavor. So tender and juicy. This will be one of my regular menu items from now on. I made a second roasted chicken last night and placed some rosemary under the skin then basted with diluted honey. It was fab!

After reading the recipes, I knew that I had to try this chicken. It's very, very good. Next time I make it, I will cut back a little of the pepper, but overall, quite delicious. I marinated for 24 hours in a plastic ziplock bag in the refrigerator and then cooked according to the directions. I only did one chicken, so I cut the spices in half, and my chicken was just over 3 pounds, so it cooked quickly; it reached 165 in a little over three hours.

We like spicy food and this was very good!  Nicely seasoned chicken flavor.  Didn't have white pepper either, so just added more black and garlic powder to taste.  Will definitely make again--soon!
Skin was a little tough, but not enough to complain.  Last few minutes with temperature increased will "crisp" up the skin to make it tastier.  (Just be careful to keep your eye on it!)

I followed the instructions religiously  One thing is right: the chicken was sooooo tender and juicy.  With the spices, it made for a great soup base. nothing to the chicken. Only for the skin and the soup I made afterwards.  I would make it again. d

I made this recipe as written with the exception of two 5 lb chickens vs 3 to 4 lb. The seasoning was excellent.  Very good flavor.  The aroma of the chicken slowly roasting in the oven was awesome. It was through out the house. I started checking the internal temperature at 4 hours. The final check on the internal temperature was at 5 hours at 175 degrees . We let it rest for 10 minutes before carving. We used one chicken that night and the next night we used the other chicken for creamy chicken and wild rice soup found on allrecipes site which is 5 stars.
Thanks 
Randy

Easy cooking method. Very tender. A little too spicy for my taste - will probably eliminate white and black peppers and go with my standards - onion and garlic powder, paprika, parsley and olive oil.

I had the oven at 450 just to brown the chicken for 10 minutes.  Then I lowered it to 250 and I followed the recipe exact.  I used a 5 lb chicken.  I checked it after 3 hours because I wanted to add some small red and white potatoes to roast alongside.  The chicken was done.  I took it out of the oven to let it rest and roasted some potatoes on a separate pan.  i made a gravy with the drippings, cornstarch and broth.  It was delicious.  I wasn't ready to eat because I thought it would take 5 hours or even 4, so I cut off a thigh and leg and reheated it for a few minutes when the potatoes were almost done.  I'll try it again maybe putting the potatoes in at the beginning.

I made this today for Sunday dinner and it was delicious.  I  cut up potatoes and carrots and added them the last hour.  However, when I removed the chicken after the last hour the vegetables were not done. So I cooked the vegetables for an extra half hour and turned up the temp to 375 degrees and then they were done. I also mixed some corn starch and water and made an awesome gravy right in the pot with the potatoes. I will definitely use this recipe in the future. Thanks Sue for sharing this.

It was super!  We thought is was way better than store bought. Made no changes.  Mine was at 170 degrees in about 4 hours, so make sure to check during the last hour.  Made gravy from the drippings, best gravy ever!  Keeper!!!

Spices were spot on.  Nice and tasty.  My 5# bird took 4-1/2 hours to bake perfectly.  I did begin at 500 degrees and dropped it immediately to 250F.  Created a nice brown "crust" on the chicken.   Although the instructions didn't indicate, I did baste 4 times, also pouring some white wine over it halfway.  I did add some celery, carrots and garlic to the onions for aromatic influence.  Will definitely make this again.  Never roasted a bird at this low temperature, but it works!  Moist and not dried out as I thought it would.  5 stars!

One of those I'm happy I tried I it but won't bother again.  It was good but not even close to spectacular.  And yes, I followed the recipe exactly.  Please don't hate... just accept you and I have different pallets.

This is almost identical to the same Sticky Chicken I use  from recipezarr now food.com in 2001.  Glad I found it on all recipes.  Awesome chicken turns out moist for me.  But on food.com C. Chatwin version says to Baste with drippings every 30 minutes after the first hour.  Which helps with the skin to get crisp.

I have made this 3 times and every time my husband asks, why do we buy rotisserie chicken from the grocery store (which we do in a pinch for dinner) ,  Follow the directions exactly and you will have melt in your mouth chicken.  I did make it once in a small George Foreman Roaster (which unfortunately has been discontinued), and the results were the same as the long cook in the oven.  Either way YUM!

I am a bigger fan of Blasted Chicken which can be done just one hour before eating with little prep.  Just sprinkle all the spices you like all over the bird (a young bird about 3 1/2 to 4 lbs.) and roast at 450 degrees for one hour.  The chicken that results has crispy brown skin and melt in your mouth, juicy, tender meat. I make it often on demand!

This recipe turned out to be a welcomed addition to our recipe collection.  We made this for a guest who claimed to dislike baked chicken as a general rule and he enjoyed it enough to print the recipe and take it home with him. The chicken was tender, juicy and tasty.

Excellent recipe! Instead of a 7 lb chicken I used 4 Cornish hens. As others suggested I also added minced garlic with the onions. I didn't even marinate and it was delicious, so next time I will marinate overnight.

This is the technique that I'm going to use from now on whenever I make a roasted chicken.  

The meat was moist and very tender, the seasoning flavor penetrated the meat nicely and the skin was crispy and well-adhered to the meat.

The seasoning I used was completely different - olive oil, a little rice vinegar, salt, poultry seasoning, celery inside the chicken - and I didn't let the seasoning settle in before putting it in the oven.

For a quicker cook time I put it in at 350 degrees for 2 hours.  I had a medium size bird you might need to cook it just a bit longer for a large bird.  I also only cooked one rather than two.

Followed the directions as written.  Great chicken, moist and fall off the bone tender.   I was concerned that 5 hours baking time would make it dry but  5 hours was just right.

This is a fabulous recipe.  I've made it exactly as called for, I've done it missing a few ingredients, and it's also great with CA Cavenders Greek Seasoning.  The slow baking method is definitely a winner!

Very tasty! I used one 5.5 pound chicken and roasted it at 375 degrees for 2 hours. It was perfectly done. 

I tented it about halfway through because I was afraid the skin would burn. There weren't any juices to baste with, so next time I may put a little butter under the skin or add half a lemon to the cavity.

This chicken was fabulous!  I followed the recipe.. cooked the two chickens and it provided enough chicken for dinner plus two pots of soup and a small chicken pot pie.  It was tender and juicy.. definitely a keeper!

I used one 8 lb chicken instead of two 4 lb ones and it turned out really good. Plenty of drippings to make lovely pan gravy to go with it. I'm not a huge fan of roast chicken but I enjoyed this and will make it again. Lots of left overs since there are just 2 of us to make more meals.

Super moist and melt in your mouth tender. I did not feel the need to make any changes to this recipe. It turned out excellent. Make sure that you you had a satisfying lunch. It makes you hungry while it is slow roasting. I made some onion mashed potatoes and glazed carrots with this delicious chicken. Yum! I recommend you try this.

I make this every Sunday and my family loves it! I use half the spices for just one chicken each week and save the rest for the following week. Before the spice rub I rub it with a little olive oil. The key to making the chicken skin crisp yet sticky is to periodically coat it in it's juices while it's baking. The meat always falls right off the bone. I wouldn't change a thing!

Awesome chicken!! 
When following someone's recipe you have to use common sense. If there is something in the recipe that you don't like, then don't use it. You also need to know if your oven bakes hotter or cooler. I take into consideration what other reviewers have done differently and adjust to what sounds like it would either make it seem better to my taste! Following a recipe exactly isn't always going to yield the same results. I use a recipe as a guideline and add or delete things that I personally know will give me the best result. I have incorporated a few changes made to this recipe by other reviewers and I do love the low and slow aspect of making this roast chicken. When Sue named this chicken "sticky" I don't think she meant it literally. Again...recipes are a guideline for me and I always incorporate into a recipe my own ideas of what are tried and true outcomes to a delicious dish.

I made it for my family and friends. Six people ate the whole 2 chickens at one meal.  It was very moist.  It was done a hour early so I turned off the oven and left it in with the door open.  I would suggest putting the rub under the skin of the breast.  Everything had a good flavor but the flavor of the breast was a little weak.  I will make it again.

It was really good. But still wasn't the same as Swiss Chalet, but was really close. They have one around here, and it's a good 45 min to an hour drive.

Was hoping to do enough with this, but I think what was missing was the sauce which I didn't have the ingredients to make. Might have made it. Would make again.

I make this all the time. it is very tasteful. I always leave out the red pepper and cut up onion, but I don't miss it. I usually do chicken pieces instead. I have yet to sit and marinate for 24 hrs, will have to try that next time.  Very easy and delicious! Also makes the house smell great for hours.

Made this with a few changes (hot paprika for cayenne) and smoked salt.  This was the best chicken we have ever eaten.  since we always use organic chickens they cook in a shorter time.  I cooked it two hours breast down and two hours breast up.  Basted when I turned it over and again about half an hour before I took it out of the oven.  The bones came right out and straight into the stock pot.  ! quart of stock from one chicken carcass and we froze the second chicken with the seasoning and I know it will be just as good as the first one.  Great recipe

I'm not a good cook but I managed to make this and it was fantastic. Hubby said it was best chicken he's ever eaten!!! Will put it in a bigger roasting pan next time as there was way more liquid than I expected. Made delicious gravy out of it though. Just thrilled to have this in my "arsenal" now! :-)

I really liked the flavor that the rub imparts on the meat. I let it sit for about 5-6 hours.  I have a Rotisserie oven, so I actually used that instead of baking the chicken.  I will definitely be using these spices again next time. Very good, thank you.

DELICIOUS EASY This works well in the slow cooker.
Get fresh chicken, rub, and freeze. When needed  thaw overnight,
Let marinade a bit, pop in slow cooker 4 hours low.
Skin isn't crispy, but usually removing anyway. Clean 
meat off bones,  great dinner, or great lunch meat
for week. Check chicken, Slow Cookers are different.
Can go faster than you think.

I made this recipe tonight and my family loved it.  I omitted the cayenne pepper and reduced the salt to 3 tsp. I cooked it in the slow cooker for 8hrs on low.  I put it on top of some old yams I had laying around just so it wouldn't sit in the juices and all the skin could cook evenly.  I will definitely make this again!

I don't know why this is called "sticky"?  Mine wasn't sticky at all, possibly because I didn't baste the bird.  The instructions didn't call for basting, so I didn't.  I did marinate for 36 hours and it had good flavor.  Honestly, it was good, but just like any other recipe for roasted chicken.  I put carrots and celery on the bottom of the pan and set the bird on top of them for added flavor.  I would make this one again, but other recipes are equally as good.

I MADE ONE 6 1/2   POUND CHICKEN INSTEAD OF TWO SMALLER CHICKENS.  THIS WORKED GREAT.  I LIFTED THE SKIN AND ADDED SOME SPICES DIRECTLY ONTO THE CHICKEN AS WELL AS ON AND IN THE CHICKEN. (JUST A FRIENDLY TIP FROM ONE COOK TO OTHER COOKS.) THE CHICKEN TURN OUT MOIST, TENDER AND DELICIOUS. MY MOUTH IS WATERING JUST THINKING ABOUT HOW GOOD THIS RECIPE TURNED OUT!!!

This was so good! I used one 5 1/2 lb. broiler and cooked for 4 1/2 hours. I cut back the spices a bit since I wasn't cooking 2. I cut the salt to 2 teaspoons and it wasn't too salty for us. I did crank up the temp the last half hour to 325 and it turned out perfect! I'm saving the carcass to make chicken stock in the crockpot tomorrow. A new favorite in this house. Thank you for the recipe.

I used chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken and added 2 T extra virgin olive oil. This was very tasty. It was a bit salty for 4-5 large breasts, but that could be because it was meant for a whole chicken. Just reduce salt by half if using breasts like i did. My whole family enjoyed it.

It was good but not  great.  I normally brine chicken but didn't brine this.  I'll try it again after brining.  It is certainly nice to be able walk away from it for 5 hours.  I read an article about Costco's Rotisserie chickens and they are brined. They claim it's all natural. They certainly are good.

Followed the recipe. Delicious but will add limes and garlic to the cavity next time.  Only cooked one 6 + pound roaster at 265 for about five hours. Came out perfect. Great recipe.

This chicken was the moistest chicken ever.  I followed the recipe ingredients and wrapped chicken - left in fridge 24 hours.  It was single chicken of 6 lbs so I did decrease pepper to 1/8 tsp

The results are fabulous! Maybe my oven runs hot, but I checked after about 3-1/2 hours and it was done, so I would suggest other readers to frequently check so you don't overcook.

Based on the description Sue Rogers posted, I think I made a different recipe.  While I followed the recipe exact  minus the cayenne (didn't have) there were only a couple tbl of juices and not tll the end. Skin was inedible and flavor so so.  After hour 4 turned up temp to 300 as it was not browning and leg not loosening .  The chicken was tender, although a recipe that take 2 days to prep and make not worth it

This was very moist.  I found the seasonings needed to be pumped up and I cooked it for 4 hours instead of 5 as my chickens were smaller.  Do NOT do what one person suggested - putting the potatoes and carrots in the pan with the chicken on top.  Even after 4 hours the potatoes were still not cooked!  It takes a very long time and I don't think that it is really any better than a chicken cooked for 1 1/2-2 hours at 350 seasoned nicely and a brushing of soy sauce on top.

This recipe really lived up to all of it's hype.  It was so flavorful & moist.  Better than any chicken I've ever had.  My husband couldn't believe how moist it was & really enjoyed it.  At the suggestion of a another reviewer, I used the drippings to make some gravy.  The gravy doesn't need any other spices or salt added to it because the drippings are so good.  I'll definitely be serving this again!

I  used 4 chicken quarters so halved the seasonings. The result was the best roast chicken ever. I wound up drizzling olive oil over the chicken after the first hour since there were no drippings to baste with.

I did not have time to let the seasonings sit and it turned out just fine. I used one 6 lb chicken and cooked about 3 hours. If it had gone the full 5 it would have been way overcooked.  Yummy!

I couldn't wait to try this recipe because I buy deli chickens all the time.  Don't waste your time.  I followed the directions to a tee and it was dry as a bone.  Don't cook it to an internal temperature of 180 degrees, way over done.  I will be turning this into soup and continue buying rotisserie chickens at the deli.

made this last night exactly how the recipe says to... 
First off, the chicken isn't "Sticky" so not sure about that description. In my opinion, not enough salt and while it was moist inside it lacked flavor. Though the onion stuffed inside permeates the meat, so you do get some onion flavor.
I typically make my chicken off a Thomas Keller recipe. Simply salt and pepper the chicken, then add thyme & bake. I would say the "sticky chicken" recipe is fine but not outstanding

oh my gosh! this chicken was super yummy!!! I didn't realize you where supposed to marinate it, so I put the seasonings on and then put it right into the oven. It still came out tender and full of flavor! My very judgmental nephews... who I swear are going to be food critics, told me this was the best chicken they had ever had! I paired it with some home made au gratin potatoes and sliced peaches. This ones going in my recipe box for sure!

Instead of making the spice mix, I just used an off-the-shelf Creole spice mix.  Super easy and tasted great.  So much better than chemical-tasting, overcooked supermarket rotisserie chicken.  Cook to internal temp of 165-170.

Very simple, with excellent taste. We found it to be too salty, so I will reduce the salt next time. I didn't have enough paprika, so I used some smoked paprika, with good results. My chickens were done in just over four hours. Only real negative is that you don't end up with the crispy skin that you would cooking at a high temperature.

Ok I did not as yet roast it  but it sounds really good
Every time I save a recipe I get an email asking if  I made it  I am from down under so give me  a  break !!  Let me see , we just had a week leading up to temperatures of ?? + degrees and  for the next couple of months it will just keep coming . So there will be no trying   of lovely winter recipes for me until it is actually winter here. Or what we call winter.  But it is time to pick and save. At the moment I am enjoying Sun Tea which I believe is from the Americas and thank you for that.

I wasn't crazy about this. It smelled amazing while cooking but it was really dry and not sticky at all.

I followed the recipe as written.  Husband was not impressed.  Chicken was tender but white meat was dry.  Will try it again but roast it one hour less.

I cooked chicken wings and they turned out great.
I didn't have white pepper.  I cooked the wings on a rack and I will use this recipe again. 
Great recipe !

I followed this recipe exactly and it came out perfect! I let two 2lb chickens marinade overnight in a ziplock bag. Cooked for 5 hrs on 250 degrees in a roasting rack. This is one of tenderest chickens I have ever fixed.  The flavor was amazing. The only ingredient I didn't add was the cayenne. I didn't want them too spicy. With the left overs I shredded the remaining meat and made enchiladas. This will go into my regular bi-weekly rotation.

We only did 1 chicken, so used a little over half of the seasoning mix.  Next time, we will use it all to get more of the flavor.  We also put it in our smoker and it turned out great!  Good rub!

Omg the best chicken recipe ever. Followed recipe exactly and my family ate both chickens. I left it overnight in seasonings. Next time I'll make up larger seasoning to have it on hand.

It turned out great.  I ended up covering with foil after the first hour then uncovered the last hour.  I did stick cuts of butter under the skin to prevent dryness.   I do wish the spices were actually on the meat instead of skin.   Overall it was good.

Ok, made this today because it sounded really good. The smell as it cooked was delicious. Unfortunately, the taste didn't match the scent. I followed this exactly as written save for using it with one chicken and only 4 hours cook time as recommended by others.  No changes to the ingredients, the prep or the manner of cooking. The chicken was fantastically moist, even the white meat which I normally can't stand was good for moistness. The flavor, however, was so overwhelmingly onion flavored parts of the chicken were inedible. I am also not sure why this is called sticky chicken. the skin was crisp, but it was dry with no stickiness at all and was nothing like any rotisserie chicken I've ever had. I love the concept and will use the cooking method again but unless someone can suggest anything I may have done wrong I won't be using this recipie again.

There's something slightly off about the flavors. It turned out alright, but it didn't have a deep rotisserie flavor.

I made this for the first time and it was delicious!  As suggested, I put potatoes (sweet) on the bottom of the crock pot and they were delicious as well.  When I make it the next time, I will reduce the amount of salt (as suggested by another review).  It wasn't too salty, but I need to watch my salt intake.

Very moist and flavorful. We did one bird, halved the spices, rubbed the skin with avocado oil. 
It nearly fell apart. Perfectly done!
Thanks for a great seasoning mix!

Chicken was fall off the bone tender. Would have rated it a 5, but I found the breast meat to be a little mushy and the skin was tough. Used recipe as is.

I did add some minced garlic in the cavity before cooking  and extra garlic powder in the seasoning to marinate in. The whole family loves it including the dogs, the dogs seem to have an addiction. You can't open the fridge without them thinking you might pull out the chicken.

Unless you put the rub under the skin, it tastes bland as though you didn't season at all.

Delicious. Easy. This has become a staple recipe in our dinner line up. Marinating in the spice mixture does increase flavor but isn't critical. I bake in convection oven at 225 for 5 hours to roast 2 birds, less if just 1 chicken. I also found tying the legs & wings and tucking into body helps keep those from overcooking.

Fantastic  roast chicken.  Never used the slow cooking method before,  but skin was TOO good.  I never eat skin, but couldn't quit eating this.  Meat was fall off the bone delicious.  A big plus is that with the slow cooking the fat doesn't splatter all over the oven.  I'm going to follow the lead of another reviewer and make a large batch of the rub for the future.  The only change I'll make is to use garlic cloves in the cavity instead of onion.

This is good, not great.  I halved the recipe to 2 one bird for two people.  Lift the skin over the breasts and work about half the seasoning mix under the skin, then massage it all around.   This gets the flavor deep into the chicken.  Put the other half of the seasoning inside the bird and on the outside of the skin. 

The wife and I really like Sam's Club rotisserie chickens.  This recipe will not replace those, but it is a good seasoning mix, a little different than our normal Thanksgiving styled recipe that uses parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme.

I made it and I wanted to say that the issue of the time is a little funny.  5 hours would have been too long.  I calculated that for my 4.5 pound organic free range chicken it would take 4 hours but it only took 3.5 hours.  The seasoning was perfect.  I did use the white pepper because I had it on hand and would recommend people get some and keep it.  The different peppers taste different, white, black and red all have a different kind of heat.  The chicken was juicy and the gravy was awesome.  I did take the advice of some reviewers and put some butter on the bird as it came closer to being done and basted it a bit.  I also did season it and put it in a bag overnight with an onion and some garlic in the cavity along with some seasoning.  I eat a lot of chicken and prefer to grill it often, so I will use this seasoning the next time I grill a bird (I often butterfly them).  This was not the best chicken I have ever had but it is a really good one.  You do need to be aware if you are making 1 bird 5 hours may be to long if it is under 6 lbs.

Very good. But I prefer the slow cooker recipe on this site (Whole Chicken Slow Cooker Recipe), same spice mix and marinade time but pop into the slow cooker and leave it. Very delicious.

First off, lets give credit where credit is due, this is originally called Mimi's sticky chicken recipe and came across the recipe back in the early 2000's. The author of this recipe should have mentioned this when sharing it on all recipes.

I've made this chicken several times and it is always a hit... well, not for those who complained that cayenne does not belong on a chicken. Baste no more than 2 times or the skin tends to blacken even given the low cooking temp. 

I always double my spices and herbs when making this chicken and always keep a batch of the mix in my spice rack which also works well on big chicken legs.  Most important part, try to have your spices on the chicken a minimum of 12 hours in advance of cooking the bird, makes a world of difference in the stickiness  of the chicken. 

I also mist it gently with water after sprinkling the spices before I send it back in the fridge for 12h to 24h before cooking.

This is a recipe I have used for years as Michelle 'S sticky chicken .  I make up the rub(triple or quadruple the ingredients) and store it in  a glass jar in the fridge so I don't have to make it up each time. This is excellent with garlic mashed potatoes.

I make this almost weekly.  It is a huge hit in our house.  Sometimes I come home at lunch, put it in, and when we get home from work the house smells amazing and dinner is pretty much done!  I have never had this one go wrong.  Make the spice mix in bulk and it's always available.

I followed this recipe “EXACTLY” and it was so over cooked that even the dark meat was dry; I tried making a casserole with it but had to throw it out.
  
I attempted roasting another whole chicken; 5 pounds at 350 for 1 hour 40 minutes and it was delicious and “MOIST”. 
  
What an expensive way to learn a lesson!

I added a teaspoon of garlic powder to the recipe.  Othewise, I made it as directed and it was fabulous.  Fall off the bone tender but still very moist and flavorful.  Bravo!

I put the chicken in the oven and went to sleep.  Came out and opened the oven and was greeted by a fantastic looking chicken.  Eating it was just a little different.  I think it needed to be basted because the breast was dry(ish).  The legs, wings, and thighs were fantastic.  This chicken corpse fell apart while cutting it.  You don't need to be skilled in cutting up a chicken as this just fell apart and off the bone.   I'd cut the salt down to half of what is called for, but that is just me.  Will make every time whole chickens are on sale.  Thank you.  Oh and the chicken skin will make your knees buckle.

Nearly perfect!  Taste is outstanding, just needs a little help with  some oil basting during the roasting to keep the skin from getting too dry.  Otherwise, great.

It's amazing how good this recipe is. Even though there is a lot of "spicy" ingredients, the resultant flavor is savory and mild. Very good.

Love this super simple recipe.  I found a McCormick Rotisserie Chicken seasoning that I sometimes substitute if I am in a hurry.  We eat this about every 1-2 weeks now.

This is better than the chickens you pick up in the deli department and OH SO WORTH the time. My husband is absolutely addicted to this chicken, and he often steals the skin right off the poor thing if he knows I'm shredding it for recipes. This is a stand by recipe and a tried and true favorite. Such tender, flavorful meat. Mmmm!

This rub can be used on all kinds of meats. I used it on a turkey I cooked and the family loved it. I'm not sure where the "sticky" comes from but it was really good.

I made this exactly--and I do mean EXACTLY--as written. Rubbed down and bagged overnight, even had white pepper on hand! After 2 hours, the skin was REALLY dry so I flipped it over to let the back side, hopefully, moisten. It ended up flavorful, but I cannot for the life of me get the "sticky" part of the recipe's title.

I've never written a review before, but I felt compelled. I've made this recipe twice, and it comes out perfectly. I made it just as written, and it comes out beautifully. The chicken is very tender, and much better than rotisserie chicken from the store. My favorite part is that unless you have a large family, you'll have enough leftovers for one or two more meals- think enchiladas, chicken tetrazzini, wraps etc...  Thanks for sharing it.

I make this nearly every single week!

I also use this recipe to cook the chicken in my convection oven. I cook at 400 degrees for about 1.5 hours for a 6 lb. chicken. It comes out nearly as good as the slow roasting in the oven. 

I changed the recipe slightly for the tastes of my family - reduce black pepper to 1/4 teaspoon and omit the cayenne completely.

Prepare for lots of compliments!

It wasn't anything special to me, for 5 hours I'd expect a tastier chicken.  It was moist but the skin was super tough, I've never had skin like that before.  I'll not make it again.

I love this recipe!   If you don't care for all the salt, you can cut back or eliminate it all together (I have done both and the recipe is still tasty).  I am making this to put into mini mason jars to give as Chrristmas gifts this year:-)

AMAZING!!! This recipe turned out perfect. The only change I made was excluding the white pepper because I didn't have it on hand. Seasoned one 7 pound bird and refrigerated over night. Cooked for about 4 1\2 hrs. Turned out extra juicy with a perfect flavor. Made gravy from the drippings as one review suggested. Didn't need it for the chicken but was great on mashed potatoes. This one's a keeper for sure. Loved it and will definitely make this again.

The chicken was moist and the dry rub tasted very good. I thought the words "Rotisserie Style" in the title was a bit misleading, however, because while the dry rub colored the skin to look like rotisserie chicken, it tasted more like medium-hot wings. Further, I baked the chicken to an internal temperature of 165F (rather than to 180F which might overcook the meat) since "whole poultry" is fully cooked at 165F.

This is the best and easiest chicken.  I made it exactly as the recipe said except I cooked it in the crockpot.  I put the rub on the chicken and put the onion in it.  I put it in the refrigerator overnight.  I put it in the crockpot over my noon lunch break and let it cook on low for about 7 hours.  I put 4 foil balls on the bottom of the crock so the chicken was elevated.  Delicious!!  Definitely make this everytime.

You had me at 'sticky'.  I love rotisserie chicken and couldn't wait to try this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used one larger chicken instead of two smaller ones.  I did everything like the recipe said to, including seasoning the chicken, putting it in a zip loc bag and refrigerating it over night.  The meat was delicious and juicy but the skin...the part I was really excited about...was anything but sticky.  It was dry and tough.  When I checked it about halfway through the cooking time and saw that it looked so dry, I rechecked the recipe thinking I must have done something wrong.   Nope, I did everything according to the directions.   So I don't know why the skin came out like that.  If anyone has any ideas for me, please let me know.  I really wanted to love this chicken.

I used one 7 lb whole chicken. I cut all of the spices in half. I also added 4 cloves of garlic to the quartered onion on the inside. I did let it sit overnight for almost 24 hrs wrapped in seran wrap. For the cooking time I placed the chicken in the oven @250 for 2 1/2 hours. The temperature was then turned up to 350 for 1 hour. Once the chicken was removed the pan juices were drizzled on top. I let it sit for about 20 minutes. Came out delicious! Tasted just like it came from a rotisserie.

The chicken tasted great.  We made gravy from the juices, too.  I only tweaked the recipe slightly.  I used 1 larger chicken. Based on other reviews, I doubled the garlic powder.  I didn't have white pepper so I replaced it with coarse black pepper.  Before I rubbed the chicken with the mixture, I used a fork to poke holes in the skin.  I also rubbed some of the mixture under the skin.  Although I didn't cover it with plastic wrap, I did let it sit in the refrigerator to marinate for about 3.5 hours.  I just had it covered with aluminum foil which stayed on during the cooking process.

Have made this many times--always good.  However, it never comes out sticky and "rotisserie-like".  Added white wine to deglaze pan, then added bouillon cube and additional water (to make a little more) along with a flour/water slurry and made gravy out of pan drippings.

It was a simple recipe to follow. I used a family pack of two chicken breasts and 4 drumsticks. Definitely making again, but would only use a pinch or two of cayenne pepper next time.

This was the best baked chicken that I have ever made!  I cut the cayenne pepper back a bit since I have little kids to think about, but other than that I followed the recipe.  The spice mix was nice but what I really think made this chicken great was cooking it at a low temperature for several hours.  The meat was moist and just falling off the bone.   The first night I served it in a bowl with brown rice and baked veggies.  The second night I shredded it up and made enchiladas.  Next I will use it in a tortilla soup per another reviewer's suggestion.

The first time I made this, I didn't care for the onion in the cavity, chicken was too oniony, but good. The second time I used celery instead and it was much better.

Love this recipe!! I've made this many times, the only things I do different is using one whole fryer (about 7 pounds) and using my slow cooker instead. It's so easy to prepare the night before (I don't use the white pepper though, just increase the black pepper and cayenne), wrap it up, place on a plate in the fridge, and in the morning put in my crockpot for about 8 hours on low. I always put 4-5 aluminum foil balls underneath the chicken. I place a few pats of salted butter on the top and again before I serve. It's always a hit!! Thank you for the recipe!!

I always make a recipe exactly as written the first time, and this was no different except my butcher gave me two 4-pound fryers (less meat). I'll insist on roasters next time.
This was fantastic! I marinated it in the rub for five hours and cooked it for another five. The skin was super crispy and the flavors penetrated everywhere. Even with all that pepper it was only mildly spicy - just enough to lend interest.
I highly suggest going to the effort of getting the white pepper. Having cooked with it before I know that it makes a major difference.
Around the 4th hour I melted some butter on top of the chickens, then basted them with the liquid after taking them out to rest.
The kids said it was the best homemade chicken they've had - as good if not better than the rotisserie chickens we've purchased.
A definite keeper - and so easy to make that you can run errands, clean house - whatever - while the chickens are cooking!

This came out great. The only change I made was to use a cut-up chicken. I marinated it for about 5 hrs and set the pieces on thick slices of onion in a 13x9 pan. It only need to cook for 2 hours.

This is the best chicken ever !!!  Slow roasting makes it extremely juicy and tender. The spices work great together- for our family I lessened the Cajun pepper by half (a little spicy for our taste) and I added 2 Tbs of Brown Sugar and a little cinnamon OMG good. When I boil it down to make soup I don't even have to add any additional spices just add chicken broth. Makes incredible chicken salad too, I add celery and red grapes - wow definitely a family favorite.

Amazing is the only way to describe this recipe. The only change I made was to add tarragon I prefer tarragon with chicken then any other spices. It turned out great almost as good as Costco chicken. I would serve this for Sunday dinner with company coming.

I made this last night for dinner . Did not add or change the recipe. The skin was very hard and dry and in some spots almost burnt. Thought about covering with aluminum foil when I noticed it but didn't because I didn't know if it would affect the cooking process. The dark meat (legs and thighs) were the only places where the meat fell off of the bone. This is not a keeper for me.

I absolutely love this recipe. It's the only way I roast chickens now. I'm having people over this weekend - I'm going to do 2 in the oven and 2 on the grill. All prep ahead of time and then don't have to do a thing while I tend to the guests and drinks and sides - and then people will be blown away by how good it is! Highly recommend.

My husband did not believe that this would work out. After three hours it looked cooked. I took it out  and basted it  and put it back in for another two hours. So glad I had faith! It was wonderful, the skin was golden and crispy and the meat moist and full of flavor. Husband very happy. I will be cooking this again. Thanks.

I made this recently, and it was OK. It was very juicy, but yet lacked the flavor I was hoping for. When it was about 10 minutes  short of the finished cooking time, the bird's skin was still very pale, so I took it out of the oven, basted it with a little melted butter and broiled it the rest of the way. The skin came out nice and more like the skin of a store bought rotisserie chicken.

Didn't change a thing except for using one big bird and adjusting the cooking time accordingly. Literally LOL when hubby was carving meat, saw the onion in the cavity and thought I had cooked the pack of giblets  :)  Great combination of spices; will definitely do this one again!

I had to cook it for much longer than the recipe stated. For that reason I advise checking with a thermometer.
 The chicken was very juicy and tender, however there was no flavor. when the chicken was done, it was sitting in a pool of fat.

Wanted to find a chicken rotisserie recipe and this is it!Easy with ingredients that I had in my pantry. Husband loved it and requested it every week! The changes I made were; Changed serving size to 4, did a pinch of salt versus the 2 teaspoons. After making the recipe I felt it had plenty of salt taste. Also since I put the chicken in a plastic bag in the frig to marinate some of the seasoning comes off when I do it. Before cooking I make the seasoning again and put it on the chicken before cooking. The  taste is wonderful! Perfect!

This is definitely going on the keep and favorites list. Broke my hand the other day and still managed to cook this dish. I have a 25 year old,picky eater, in my house and nothing was left on her plate but a few bones. Served with green beans sautéed with bacon and roasted red potatoes.

Seasonings didn't really get to the meat thru the skin.  5 hours was too long, checked it at 4:15 hrs. and was at 195.  Breast was overcooked and dry.  I could see it having the texture of a rotisserie chicken if cooked to an internal temp. of 165-170  Next time if I try it again, I'll put seasoning under skin and on skin and check temp starting at 2.5 hrs, might be a great recipe then.

It was succulent like a Thanksgiving turkey and I made rice and veggies and we thought we were eating out at a fancy restaurant!!!!  There is a lot left over for my Nick to have when I go out of town soon and he is just LOVING IT!!!!  Gigi (our little pup) loved her bits and pieces too!!!!!  I will make it again and for company too!!!!

The meat was tender and juicy; but I think it was lacking in flavor. This was essentially a dry rub. I think it needed a  little citrus - lemon or lime to make ths flavors pop.

Ive noticed quite a few readers say they skipped adding the white pepper when making this stating they used black pepper instead.  White pepper adds a unique flavour and is different from black pepper. You can add it to many and any recipe. Its actually is one of the 'secret' ingredients in Kentucky Fried Chicken recipe.

I can't rave enough about this recipe. I've made it numerous times. I don't always follow the recipe for the baking time but when I do it's worth the extra bit of effort. I have made up a huge batch of the spice mix and often will just spice up a chicken, fill the cavity with chopped onions and bake it as usual. I have cut back on the cayenne as we find it a bit too hot for us. When I have fresh rosemary I will add it in the cavity and stuff some under the skin. I have added dried rosemary to the spice mix too.  I always get rave reviews when I serve this to company.

I have made this for years, found the recipe in the newspaper. I do one chicken, breast side down and dec. the time to 4 hours. 250 deg. is perfectly safe, it is not a typo. I do baste the chicken every 15 min. for the last hour. Place on rack when removing from oven and let it rest with foil over it..

Rather than discarding the giblets, I'd recommend covering them with water, adding a little salt, a few peppercorns, a chopped up carrot, chopped up celery and make some stock.

I've made this twice and followed the recipe exactly as written. It is a delicious way to prepare roast chicken. It's very tender and moist and so easy to put together. As the recipe says you should marinade it in the fridge overnight and this is a very important part of the recipe, don 't skip it. Don't make a bunch of changes and then give it less than 5 stars. It deserves 5 stars as written.

Low and slow is the way to go!  This chicken comes out  incredibly tender and better than the supermarket variety. To save time I use Rotisserie seasoning sold in the spice aisle -- MUCH easier than mixing all of the separate spices and has great flavor. No one will know you didn't cook this on a spit!

I have to say I am not much of a chicken person.  But I have been sick and stuck in the house and thought I would give this a try since I have time on my hands!  This was by far the BEST chicken I have had.  They one thing that people don't tell you is that the chicken actually takes on the taste of the spices you put all over it the night before!   I have had regular old white chicken blahhhhh this was so much more!  And some people skip the white pepper...total must because it's more robust than the regular black pepper.  The longer you keep it in the fridge the better it will be!  I followed this to the T and was so happy with it!  Don't cut corners or skip or add anything...you won't be sorry!  I shared this with my mom and aunt and they can't wait to make it.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!!!!

I use this on chicken wings in the rotisserie. A healthy alternative for hot wings. They come out crispy and full of flavor!

My 2 cents is that 180 degrees is technically overdone.   If you trust Google - it says 165 is safe and moist; so now you decide when to take it out.  (That might explain why a few people said it turned out dry.)   I do love people's suggestions so I added potatoes and carrots to the pan as well as made my best-ever gravy from the juices with chicken stock, cream, flour and bay leaf.  Someone suggested adding garlic cloves, but uh, that detracted for me because garlic takes on an earthy flavor when baked this long and that didn't complement this dish.   Speaking of baking so long, yes it's the secret to tender juicy chicken, but we live in FL so more heat in the house is the last thing we need.  I'm going to try it again but on the grill, maybe spatchcock it or use the cast iron pan, but still slow and low heat.   Or, buy it at Costco which is actually cheaper...lol but this was fun and I loved the recipe, thank you!!!  P.S.  It actually was very good without adding butter or oil - go figure!

Followed this recipe to the letter, except for reducing the salt,  AMAZING!!!!!  So juicy.  Cooked a 7+ lb chicken ( that's all they had at the store) for 4 hours.  It was just perfect!  Thanks for sharing!!

I cook chicken this way all the time now. I've used quarters, pieces, whatever. I've used all kinds of seasonings - even just Tex Joy and this is still the best way to make chicken. I've made it for groups of 50 too. It always gets compliments and it's always juicy. Plus, you can put it on and do something else. I especially love this recipe for large crowds.

I have made this chicken several times and it tastes amazing. I have made it in the crockpot and I take the meat off and then use the bones to make the most delicious broth for chicken soup. The seasoning is just so good and the chicken turns out so moist.

It was very yummy, a little salty. I used leg quarters, so I watched the closely. I baked it for 2 1/2 - 3 hours.

Followed everything, except I added a little more of the seasoning (the amount given didn't seem like enough) and I let it sit overnight. Cooked for 4 1/2 hours and checked the temp. Took it out at 180 and it smells and tastes delicious. Husband loved it. Juicy and flavorful. Make sure you guys don't let it overcook. I'm sure if I had let it sit for another half hour it might have overdone it

I completed my grocery shopping today just so I could get a fresh chicken to make this recipe.  I used the spices written except needed to cut back on the paprika due to dietary needs (my husband).  While reading the recipe I saw that it should be refrigerated; unfortunately I did not.  I was concerned as it cooked that it would not turn out very good.  Well I must say this chicken is awesome.  I wonder what it would be like if I did refrigerate it.  As one reviewer negatively put it, she could just  drive down the street and get a roasted chicken as it would save her time and money.  Yes that is true.  I could have picked one up from Costco.  But I must say, I did not think anybody could beat the Costco roasted chicken.  Well I have now found a recipe that can.  I also made gravy out of the drippings, and it was the best gravy I have ever, ever made.  I had a small chicken, so I kept an eye on the meat thermometer.  It was done in about 3.5 hours.  Thank you for submitting such a great recipe.  Next time I will make 2, and the second one I will make White Chicken Enchiladas.

This was excellent and exactly what I was hoping for. We love those rotisserie chickens from the grocery store.  This is about as close as you're gonna get. Halfed the recipe for one 3lb bird. I roasted it neck-down-feet-in-the-air on my angel food pan insert so roasting time was an hour shorter. Cook to temperature and it will be amazing!

I used this recipe for a chicken I smoked alongside some ribs and it turned out fantastic. I added the rub to some melted butter and minced garlic then rubbed it under the skin of the chicken. It was on the smoker for approximately 4 hours and I occasionally sprayed it with a 50/50 mix of apple juice and water. The skin was golden brown and crispy, the chicken juicy and the flavor was delicious. It still tasted like chicken but had a little smoke and zing to it. I've used this a few times and once I even injected the mixture into the bird. This will be a frequent flyer on my summer BBQ list. 

Oh, I don't bother with putting anything in the cavity. I don't notice any difference one way or the other...

I've made this so many times I've turned this into a dry rub. The only down side to this recipe besides a few "exotic" to some spices like white pepper I can think of with this is you've got to bake for 5 hours. All I added extra as I continued to make it was MSG I matched with the amount of salt but regardless it's one of my favorite recipes on here hands down from a guy who used to never really enjoy chicken.

This is the juiciest chicken I've ever eaten! I used the same ingredients with a little less Cayanne pepper and only used one chicken instead of two (Cook time with one chicken is about 2 hours).

Used thighs and cooked at 250 for 3 hours.  Only used 1/4 of the spices for 8 thighs.  Very moist and flavorful!  Will make again.

oh wow!! Fantastic!!  The only thing I changed was I used chicken quarters instead of a whole chicken, since that is what I already had in the house.  I baked at 350 for 1 1/2 hours, and the chicken was so moist, the skin nice and brown.  Wonderful flavor.  Using the leftovers for white chicken chili tomorrow.

This works so well in the crock pot! We usually do one chicken at a time on high for 1hr per pound. The meat just falls off the bone! I cut up a small onion to put on the bottom of the crock pot to prevent any sticking, just in case. We've been cooking at least 2 chickens every Sunday so we can eat it through the week for lunches and quick dinners. Just pull the chicken off the bone, bag it up into servings, and freeze!

Loved it! This was easily the best roast chicken I have ever made. I made this for Easter dinner and my family devoured it.  My very picky grandson said it was delicious.  My husband, who never has a second helping of chicken, went back for seconds. My new go to recipe for roast chicken. There is plenty of yummy pan drippings for gravy too! A winner!

This was YUUUMMM-O!  Everyone in the family liked it!  I have made it three times now, once in a crock pot, and it was great too!  My only suggestion would be to rub a bit of the spice mix under the skin as well if you like a stronger flavor!  Thanks for a "KEEPER" recipe!

I was so excited to make this chicken, but I ended up being  disappointed in the final product. I followed the recipe exactly, except I only made one chicken and roasted for approx. 4 hrs. Five would have been way too long. The flavor was good, and it wasn't overcooked, but I still found the meat to be dry. I also really love the skin on roasted chicken, but this was just ok.  It certainly didn't remind me of rotisserie chicken. I don't think I would make this again.

I make this frequently. Follow the directions exactly. Turns out delicious every time. A no fail recipe. I like to make extra rub. It works well on other things too.

I followed this recipe EXACTLY as written and it was DIVINE!! After reading the reviews and seeing how a lot of people "tweaked" the seasoning, I was a little concerned with the salt measurement... but it turned our wonderful! I didn't alter any of the seasoning measurements at all, and it wasn't to salty... it was seasoned to perfection!

I made this in my 4 qt. electric roaster, only one chicken. I tend to not measure my seasonings, so not sure how closely I followed the  recipe, but it had good flavor. After 3 hours in the roaster, it was falling off the bone. I will probably make it again.

It wasn't sticky, but overall this is very flavorful, tender and juicy. I did not change any measurements on the ingredients but I added 4 cloves of garlic to the onion and put that in the cavity. I marinated the chicken overnight with the onion and garlic. Instead of roasting in a conventional oven I roasted it in my NuWave oven for 1 1/2 hours. The skin was crispy and the meat tender and juicy.

I have used this seasoning rub on chicken and now turkey. Phenomenal on both. I seriously can't stop touching the crispy skin just so I can lick my fingers again. Simply amazing!

This is the easiest and best tasting chicken dish ever! The only thing is that you can only cook it for approx 3 1/2 hours or it will dry out. Start checking your chicken's temp at about 3 hours and then take it out when the temp is done!

I make this every other week with two chickens from our local farmer.  When you boil the bones/carcass for broth, it is SO tasty!  This is the best recipe I have ever used for a whole chicken!  I do not always "marinade" overnight.  Sometimes I just do it in the morning and throw it in the oven.  I also made up a huge jar of the seasoning so  I don't have to measure every time!  Everyone asks me for this recipe who eats this chicken or eats my chicken soup made from the broth from this chicken recipe. Also, i just used black pepper instead of the white pepper.

This is a great recipe.  I was skeptical at first thinking the skin wouldn't be crispy but it is.  I made this as written except for the white pepper.  I didn't have any.  I only made one chicken so I have enough of the seasonings (saved in a mason jar) for the next time I make this chicken.  The seasonings are great!  When I roast a whole chicken, I cut out the backbone with kitchen shears and lay the chicken flat breast side up.  It is so much easier to carve.  I would suggest using a meat thermometer.  My single chicken that was 6lbs took about 4 hours.  The one thing I would like to suggest is DON'T FORGET TO BASTE THE CHICKEN WITH THE DRIPPINGS WHILE COOKING.  I didn't, and the skin was a little dry but the chicken was very good.  I will definitely be making this again.   When the chickens are on sale, I can get 3 meals for 2 out of one chicken.  Can't beat that.

I've made this many times, and we love it so much! One change that I have made, however, is to make a thin paste out of the seasonings by adding a few tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. The paste allows for more even coating, and it will seep into every crevice while on the spit!

I did not modify the recipe. I had one 3.5 lb whole chicken and therefore I split the spice mix in half. It took approximately 3.5 hours to cook at the suggested temperature (I used an electronic thermometer to confirm. I was slightly disappointed to see that the skin was dry, HOWEVER, the meat was tender, flavorful and juicy. It was overall a good recipe. I also did not have a large amount of drippings that other people described having in order to make a gravy.

The long cook time does leave the skin a bit dry as other have pointed out. However the meat is so tender who cares about some dry skin? Of course I don't care for the skin anyway.

It was just ok. It was moist and I did add garlic in addition to the salt and pepper. The onion I had to put in the cavity was crazy big so only half the onion ended up in it. Still quite tasty. Don't know if I'll make this again or not.

Came out great. Accidentally picked up one roast chicken and one fryer. The fryer split open. I will truly make this again. Next time with some collard greens.

This recipe has been a household staple for the last few years since I found it here. I use one large chicken and the entire amount of seasoning. I also lift the skin and rub the spices directly on the meat.  I work very long hours, but I put it in the oven, on a roasting rack, at 250 and leave it for ten hours. It’s PERFECT. My kids fight over the skin and the meat. This recipe also gives us plenty of leftover chicken to use for pot pies, etc. after our roasted chicken meal. This is one of the best recipes I’ve ever gotten on this site.

Very good flavor. I made it using 9 whole chicken wings instead of a whole chicken. I cut the recipe in half since I was not cooking that much chicken. I placed the wings in a plastic storage bag and made sure all chicken was covered with the spices, diced an onion, and placed it in the bag with the chicken, then stored in the refrigerator overnight. I baked in a roasting pan uncovered in the oven at 375 degrees for an hour. Very good recipe. This is now my go-to recipe for baked chicken. Thanks for the recipe.

Initially was sceptical that this recipe would be a success. I was thinking the chicken would be completely dried out after cooking 5hrs uncovered. Happy to report I was totally wrong, the chicken came out perfect!. Hubby is still raving about how moist the chicken was. I used my own selection of spices and cooked 2 chickens at 250f for 5 hrs.  Will be making this again and again!. Thank you for the awesome recipe!.

This chicken was by far one of the bests I have made  my husband raved about it (which doesn't happen often). Loved it and will definitely make it again!

This turns out really good but I  rub breast with olive oil & then the rub.  Also, i butterfly the chicken ( cutt out the backbone & lay the chicken open) That way you can season the other side better & cooks in less time. This method also provides flavor for any potatoes/ veggies you place under the chicken.

Decent enough to call baked chicken. I followed the directions exactly as written, and after some messy (but not difficult) preparation, the end result was bland baked chicken with a nice texture.

Made this and it was yum, entire family loved it! I added some really hot chilli powder though - 2 teaspoons. I will always make my ChicKen this way now. My 8 year old said its very moist  unlike the normal way which comes out a bit dry.

The seasoning really was in the meat rather than just the skin. Thanks for sharing!

I have a George Foreman mini rotisserie oven, and this blend made amazing rotisserie chicken!  I applied the rub, stuffed with onion, and left in fridge overnight as recommended.  The chicken came out juicy and flavorful.  This is a keeper for sure!

I was a little worried about this recipe living up to all the hype. But it surpassed my expectations the chicken was very moist not dry at all. I followed the recipe step by step (even cooking it for 5 hours). Maybe next time I will try a crock pot to see how the chicken comes out that way. This is a must try recipe!!! Enjoy!!

I totally botched this recipe and it still turned out. My daughter said it was the best ever! I think marinating the chicken in the dry rub is key. It really infuses it with flavour. I cooked this at 350 because I ran out of time and it was still great. Can't wait to try this again soon.

I LOVE this recipe! I make it with just chicken breasts and in the crockpot and it is amazing! I make this about 3 times a month and we have it for dinner, then we use it for leftovers on salads and chicken nachos.

We make this often, and have done it in our smoker, the oven and crock pot and find it turns out perfect every time. However we also use this recipe as written for one bird, not two. Delicious. (Here I am months later to add to this review. We make this meal probably once every 6 weeks. It is our consistently repeated dish. Perfect every time. And as I fed my fam (17 year old, 4 year old, 2 year old and husband), everyone of us loves this meal. I have to make 2 birds every time as leftovers are a must it's THAT good. We make loaded potatoes or twice baked with this, Italian beans with bacon and a fresh loaf of oatmeal bread as our sides). AH-mazing meal. Thank you thank you!!!!)

i liked it but it didnt have all that much flavor with the recipe as is. i think next time i make it i may double the amount of seasoning and maybe put some under the skin. it looked great and was done in 3.5 hours perfectly. still tasted good and was moist, just not much extra flavor from the seasonings

I have a rotisserie option in my oven and I was desperate to find a recipe that would give me results like this!  It's better than any store bought rotisserie chicken. Love that it's so easy to prep!  I make this weekly. Huge hit in our home!

I used all the ingredients listed in this recipe. The only change was that I used a 6 1/2 lb. chicken instead of two small chickens, and baked at 250 for 4 hours. It's excellent for dinner, salads, or sandwiches. I don't think it's possible to get rotisserie chicken in an electric oven no matter how you do it. I've tried several methods and they just don't measure up. I would have given this a five star, but because it was touted as "rotisserie, sticky" I gave it four stars. But, I will certainly make this again.

After reading so many reviews on the negative side, I would start checking the temp. after 2-2 1/2 hours for a reading of 165. If it reaches that temp, then it's done. For sticky chicken it must have brown sugar in the seasoning.  However, if you use sugar, it's best to use small chickens and cook at a high heat for a much shorter amount of time.  Hope this helps...

This chicken is super moist and juicy.  I don't know that it tastes like rotisserie,  but I still love it.  I used chicken breasts and cooked in crock pot instead of oven.  The only thing I left out was the white pepper because I didn't have it.  I cut onions and put in bottom of crockpot and coated the chicken with the spices and placed on top of onions.   Next time I will use less salt (maybe about 2 1/2 tsp instead of 4) and will not use thyme because I don't like that flavor.  This is a definite keeper that the whole family loved.

I used less salt, and used smoked paprika and extra garlic powder. This was delicious! Definitely a keeper! Thanks! UPDATE: I had a bunch of extra parsley and shoved that into the cavity with the onion. Also had lots of celery, so I put that under the roast. The chicken was phenomenal and the gravy (some chicken stock, flour and white wine)  from the drippings was too!

My first time making a roasted chicken and slam dunk! Juicy tender chicken! The only changes were  that I used an 8lbs chicken. I cooked it for a total of six hours, first three hours at 250 degrees then 275 the last three hours. I also buttered and seasoned under the skin as well as to the rest of the chicken. I also threw in some garlic and celery in the chicken cavity since I had some on hand. Otherwise followed recipe exactly.

I use half the amount of  salt the recipe calls for.  Just our personal preference.  And I use half kosher salt and half seasoned salt.  I also, squeeze some fresh lemon juice on the chickens inside and out before putting on seasoning.  Put the lemon rinds inside the chicken.  I prefer to put the seasoning on the night before and let it set before cooking. Very good.  I make this often and use my Rottiserie Oven.

I love all the ingredients listed here, but this will not give you a rotisserie chicken "taste" I will tell you how to achieve the real taste.

Follow all directions above (as far as the ingredients go) 

Before placing your chicken into the oven, you need to "flash fry" both sides of the chicken without over cooking it ( aim for light golden) After you "flash fry" in your oil of choice, place the chicken into the oven covered with aluminum foil and cook for the normal amount of time (35-45 mins) on 375-425.  After the chicken Is throughly cooked . Remove foil and place your oven on "broil". Allow both sides to broil(turn your chicken over just once)  until the Chicken is golden brown. Allow to cool and serve ... This will taste just like the store bought rotisserie chicken.

Roast Sticky Chicken Haiku: "Not 'sticky' for us. But it tasted really good! Leftovers were great." I thought about doing my chicken in the crockpot instead, but figured I'd stick to the recipe's ingredients and directions. Very easy to mix up the spices, massage em all over that chicken, left mine refrigerated for closer to 24 hrs., and then plop in oven. The chicken was moist and nicely seasoned, although not sticky nor crispy. The leftovers were awesome over salad and then in a sandwich!

Was wonderful flavor. I re commend placing chicken upside down so breast and skin are moist. Also put the seasoning on outside of chicken and under the skin. Adding drippings to homemade gravy is great too. You don't have to let marinate overnight either, will still taste good. I use this seasoning mixture for multiple things.

I have tried it marinating over night and I have also tried it as just a rub 30 minutes before I bbq or bake chicken. These spices are a delicious combination. I do cut the cayenne pepper in half and don't add as much paprika but that's because my husband doesn't like too spicy of food. It could have just been that I didn't let it sit long enough also. But I always use this recipe for my chicken seasoning and it is always a big hit!!! Thank You!

I was looking for a new whole chicken recipe, and this looked good! I used around a 4lb bird, and used all the seasoning on it ... only thing I did extra was to rub the chicken down with butter! The chicken cooked for about 4 hours (hour per pound) on a roasting tray so it was just off the bottom of the dish...checked with a meat thermometer at 4 hours and it was done. The house smelled DIVINE all afternoon, and needless to say we ate every last bit of meat! Very moist, and flavorful. I will make this again and like one review said, will make the rub ahead and in a larger quantity! The one change I think I might make is to cut the salt from 4 to 3 ... and to let the chicken season for more than the 4 hours I allowed myself. Great recipe, and its something you can make, pop in the oven and forget while you do other things around the house…it is a no fuss delicious result!

I made this yesterday exactly like the recipe and it was awesome!! Little spicy(probably from the cayenne pepper) which made it all the better! I like it hot! I had 6lb. Chickens so it took 7hours instead of 5 at the same 250 temp. Very flavorful, I don't think I'll be buying the stores anymore lol ??

this is very good!  the 2nd time I made it, I had 2 6lb birds. I didn't want to have my oven on for 7.5 hours, so I cooked them at 350 for 4.25 hours. still turned out great. I use the 2nd chicken for enchiladas or tacos and make stock for soup. great for saving money too! thanks for the recipe!

This is one of my favourite recipes! It turns out juicy and tender every single time. I serve it with a side of corn bread and two dipping sauces. The first sauce is a garlic sauce (a mixture of crushed garlic and mayonnaise) and the second sauce is a Spanish garlic lemon.

Made this last and the flavor was great, it was juicy, and crispy.  Instead of a whole chicken, I coked three chicken breast.  I roasted the chicken breast for an hour and a half and ckecked for doneness  and crispy skin.

I've made this recipe multiple times.  As a matter of fact, it's in the oven now.  One thing I added last time, was to add a small amount of white wine in the pan.  It just added  another dimension of flavor to an already great 'pan dripping' gravy.  The chicken is moist and really doesn't require gravy, but I also make the 'Make Ahead Mashed Potatoes' from Allrecipes:  http://allrecipes.com/recipe/13608/make-ahead-mashed-potatoes/.  Great combination!

This is amazingly good. Only thing I ever change here and there is the bird itself. Sometimes one larger one, sometimes the 2 smaller. But the seasoning I always stick to it as is. I have been making it for my family for years, and there is never any leftovers. Great recipe.

I made this up exactly as written, but I only had one 4-lb chicken.  I used all the seasonings on that one bird and I'm glad I did - it was the perfect amount for a burst of flavor.  We dug out our rotisserie for the grill and used that instead of the oven.  Oh my! The smells were so wonderful; our dogs did not leave the deck hoping for that bird to jump off the grill so they could eat it!  It was better than that rotisserie chicken you buy in the grocery store.  Absolutely wonderful!  Thank you!

A family favorite! I like to keep a container with the mix on hand. When whole chickens go on sale I buy a lot, cook up this DELICIOUS recipe and use the extra chicken later for pot pies, enchiladas, all kinds of dishes. So happy to have found this!

This was very good as long as you don't cook it to 180 degrees.  It would be way too dry.  I cooked mine to 170 and let it sit for 10 minutes.  I don't know that the slow roast made it any better than a chicken roasted at regular speed but the spice rub is tasty.

Easy and delicious.  I used one 6 lb. chicken with the same amount of seasoning the recipe calls for and it was super good!  Be sure to put the seasoning under the skin where you can. Husband really liked. Kids didn't love or hate it, but they are hard to satisfy anyway.  Will definitely make again.

This was so easy and as good as the reviews said it was. I did let mine set for two nights because I couldn't roast it sooner. It was moist and taste like Rotisserie chicken. I found the whole chicken on sale, so it was cheaper to buy than the rotisserie chicken you buy in the store, plus I knew what I put on it and how it was prepared. I can't rave about it enough. Now if I could find whole chicken on sale all the time.

I love this spice blend,and the recipe comes out juicy but ended up making a couple substitutions the 2nd time I made it that worked well.  I didn't have any thyme so substituted 1/2 t. poultry seasoning which has thyme in it.  Also used Smoked black pepper instead of regular.  The rest was the same.  Yum

I love this recipe!  Omitted most of the salt due to dietary restrictions.  Also changed the cooking method.  425 for 20 minutes.  Turn down the oven to 325, cover, 20 min per lb.  The drippings make fabulous gravy.

Great recipe. Just make sure to adjust the amount of seasoning for a smaller bird.  I didn't and ended up with a very salty chicken.

Followed recipe for the spice blend to a T but used it on 6 boneless skinless chicken thighs. As Emeril likes to say "BAM!" -it was great! Just pan-fried them on high to get a nice spice crust. They've got a nice kick to them. Marinated half and cooked the other half immediately. No major difference between the two. I would cut back on the heat just a tad if serving to young kids (mine are 4 and 2 and it was on the edge of being too spicy). Otherwise no changes needed!

The flavor of this chicken was great..however the chicken itself was dry. I will try it again for a shorter period of time. I did only fix 1 chicken so perhaps that was thee problem.

This recipe is amazing. I have made it many times, so I figured I needed to give credit where credit is due. The rub is great, don't be scared to keep the spice levels where they are. (An idea- double or quadruple the recipe and save it for the next time. Saves time measuring, and I feel the recipe is a little short for the 7# chicken I cook). The longer you can marinade the chicken, the better it turns out. Let it rest after cooking, the juices run like a river when you cut this thing. Make changes like adding garlic, etc., but if you just follow the directions as written, you will be thrilled with the results.

This was absolutely delicious! Did not change a thing in terms of ingredients and measurements but I didn't have a whole chicken on hand. Instead I used a large pack of legs and a pack of thighs - about 6 lbs total. I cut an onion, laid big pieces across the bottom of a glass baking dish, and placed the chicken on top. I coated each piece generously with spice mixture, making sure to get under skin and directly on the meat wherever possible. I covered the dish with plastic wrap and stuck in the frig overnight. Next day, I roasted low and slow as stated in the recipe and the result was some of the tastiest, juiciest, most moist chicken I have ever had. I made a simply roux in a separate saucepan and added the pan drippings. I found it to be a little too salty as-is, so I added about 1/3c of water which did the trick - gravy was knock-your-socks off delicious over rice! Can't wait to try bone-in breasts next time! Make this chicken - you won't be disappointed!!

Excellent blend of spices!  I double the blend and keep it in a jar on my spice rack to use even when I make a couple pieces at a time.  Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful recipe. The skin is dry but the meat is juicy.  I make one for dinner and the other one gets shredded and put up for a dinner the next day or freeze the shredded meat for even later use.  Don't forget to save the bones for broth!

This turned out really well! We had leftovers the following day and they were so moist. I followed the suggestion of another poster and pulled the chickens at 170*, which was less than 4 hours.

I change the servings to 64 and make a mason jar full of the spice (2 cup capacity, I believe).  I use it for everything!  Even add a bit to my chicken noodle soup for an extra kick, or add lots if I'm really congested to clear my sinuses.  I love adding it to drumsticks before throwing them on the grill too.  I do cut the salt down to about 2/3 of what the recipe calls and almost double the paprika and add a bit of the no salt seasoning to compensate, because otherwise it can be a bit salty, especially if you add it to things like pork.  I'm tempted to use it on a turkey with a little sage for thanksgiving, letting it marinate overnight, as the traditional bland turkey has always deterred my family from eating turkey during the holidays.  Yum!

I used this recipe on a chicken which I put in a rotisserie oven.  I made a couple of changes.  I did NOT add the cayenne pepper, I used white pepper but not the black pepper.  I increased the garlic to 1 tsp and I added about 2 tsp of Splenda Brown Sugar mix.  The bit of sweetness from the brown sugar made an amazing difference in the rub.

With those changes this is one of the best rubs I've ever used on a chicken!!

This was fantastic!  I didn't have time to let it sit overnight but did let it sit for a couple of hours in the fridge, uncovered.  I also didn't have time to cook it slowly, so I cooked it at 450 for 30 minutes, then at 350 for another 30.  I also added a little water to the bottom of the pan since I was cooking it so high but broth would have been better.  I have to agree that this made the BEST pan gravy.  It was a huge hit in my house!

This chicken has a great flavor, and falls off the bones everytime we cook it.  My complaint is that it seems too dry for my taste. Will be trying other roasted chicken recipies for jucier chicken results.  When we make this we are able to eat off of it all week, and include the pre-cooked chicken in many other recipies. A great budget and time saver for busy families.

The taste was primarily in the skin of the chicken and the meat itself was cooked to death.  My husband liked it, but I don't think I'll make it again.

You were not kidding when you said "Fall off the bone good".  We tried to pick up the chicken to transfer it to a cutting board, and it literally fell apart!!!  Wow!  It was so tender and juicy, and it was still juicy days later when I reheated some for lunch!  YUM!!!

I have made this a number of times and it always comes out delicious! The only 2 things I do differently are, I don't use the onion and I use a rotisserie and it is the bomb. I sometimes add more thyme because I like it...

I read many of the bad reviews to see what might need to be changed, but it looked like most of those reviewers just cooked the chicken too long.  I used a cornish game hen instead of a chicken, put butter under the skin, rubbed with olive oil before I put on the spice rub (I didn't use white pepper or cayenne because my kiddo doesn't like spicy), and cooked it at 375 for an hour.  Turned out great and I will definitely make this again.

I make this often and use the leftovers to make chicken tortilla soup from the recipe on the Rosarita refried beans can.  I boil the skin and carcass to get all the seasonings in my soup broth.  Delicious.  I caution using an oven bag because that will cause your chicken to cook faster....

Delicious and easy. I also mixed rub with butter and stuffed it under the skin and it definitely added a ton of flavor to the meat (we eat our bird skinless).

I made this today.  Followed the recipe, but cooked one 6 lb chicken for 6 hrs.  The skin was dry and tough and the meat was flavorless and dry.  Won't be making this again.

I had never made a roast chicken before trying this recipe and it was amazing!  My husband was over the moon about it, he said it was the best chicken he'd ever had!  I've made it several times since stumbling upon the recipe and I will make it many more times to come! Thank you thank you thank you for posting this!

Made this recipe with two chickens. I took the advice of one reviever and added less salt but, I really should have added the full three tsps. or more because the meat just really wasn't seasoned enough. Next time I'll add a little extra of each seasoning. Really easy. Thanks for the recipe.

First, 5 stars for the cooking method.  The spices/rub could use some additions such as kosher salt, chicken bouillon and fresh ground pepper.  Next, the chicken should be placed in a roasting pan on a rack and liquid should be added to the bottom like broth and red wine.  I also added some sweet peppers in the liquid and on top of the chicken.  We like spicy so I added chipotle peppers in adobo sauce on top and inside and red pepper flake.  During the last 30 minutes, I changed the oven temperature to 275 and let it go an extra 15 minutes, just to be extra safe.  This is not like restaurant rotisserie though and won't be without a rotisserie but it was tender, juicy and quite flavorful with the extras.  Chicken should be basted every 20 minutes or so to keep it juicy.

The best chicken recipe! We are having this for the second time in about a week. This will be my go-to chicken recipe from now on! Everyone loved it BETTER than rotisserie chicken from the store! The skin was crispy and the meat was so tender and just fell from the bone.

I divided everything in half, after 4.5 hrs.,checked temp...204!!! Next time will put thermometer in and just take it to 180. Also I will raise the chicken off the bottom of the pan and baste it every hour. The skin came out pretty tough but very tasty. Overall the taste was great, but I'd cook it in a more conventional way the next time but use the same spice's the night before.

I pretty much followed the recipe except for adding a quartered lemon with the onion to the inside of each chicken.  The meat was very moist but not very flavorful.  Basically tasted like chicken with no seasonings.  Don't think I'll make this one again.

Easy as long as you plan.  Meat not as flavourful as I would have thought with overnight marinate. Perhaps I will put some seasoning UNDER the skin next time! Tender! Great gravy juices!!

This rub was amazing. I didn't have the luxury of cooking it for 5 hours so I cooked at 10 min per pound at 500. It was perfect--crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. My six-year-old daughter loves to eat the crispy skin but the cayenne made this too spicy for her so next time I'll leave that out.

I followed the preparation exactly. The chicken was done in about 3 hrs acording to my thermometer . The taste was just ok and the skin was not crisp at all. I have made many more chickens that have turned out much better in flavor and had a nice crispy skin.

Great!!  I've made this a couple of times now and it's always turned out juicy on the inside and crispy skin on the outside.  I love the spice combo.  I made it pretty much exactly as written (but didn't have white pepper any of the times I've made it...who does??)  I will continue to keep this in the dinner rotation!!

Wow I loved this chicken!  It has to be the most moist chicken I have ever made.  I made the spice mixture as written but used more than half of it for my one chicken.  I made sure to get a lot of the rub under the skin.  I also put a lemon inside instead of an onion (personal preference).  I also had poor planning when I made this and did not refrigerate overnight or cook for 5 hours.  I cooked covered at 350 for about 3 hours or so (I don't know exactly how long because I was using my meat thermometer) and then uncovered and cooked for amount 20 minutes or so.  This was still fabulous, but next time I will plan better and try marinating.

Amazingly moist and flavourful! I didn't have the time to marinate the chicken overnight and it still turned out great! I also added a quarter of lemon inside and on the top. I broiled for 8 minutes and then covered and put on 350F for about an hour.  Thank you!   This is a keeper!

We love this chicken.  It is so easy and our friends and family think i cook all day.  20 min prep one day and then put it in the oven usually sunday morning before church and then its done when we got home.  Or at least close to being done.  With any leftover chicken (never a whole lot) We always make chicken tortilla soup.  Also a recipe from this site.  Thank you for posting this recipe.  WE lOVE IT.

Pretty tasty, but it needed more for me. With the addition of a few more ingredients, I think this could be 5 star.

This was fantastic even though I did not marinate it for more than 30 minutes and cooked it for about 3 hours at 300 F (poor planning on my part). Great recipe! Thanks!

Hands down - best chicken ever. The spices are perfect and slow cooking for 5 hours in the 250 degree oven is the way to go. The smell of the chicken was driving me bananas for five hours. I couldn't wait to eat! I will try this on just plain chicken breasts and cook for less time when I'm in a hurry on a weeknight sometime-- I think the spice combo is really good.

Simple and delicious. I like to prepare and clingwrap the day before and then pop it into the oven for dinner later, mildly flavored with moist chicken underneath - no additional calories from butter, oil etc.  I too stuff fresh garlic, as well as the onion, inside.  I believe the slow roast is what makes this such a convenient and easy dish!

I really thought this chicken would have more flavor... I was quite disappointed. It was really bland. It did turn out pretty tender, but the skin was no good... way too dry. That's usually my husband & oldest son's favorite part, and they ate none of it! Maybe I'd use this recipe again if I were going to use the meat for something else... like enchiladas or something. For sure left us all wanting...

Add extra liquid to the bottom so I would have some "drippings" to make a gravy. I even put a lid on it to keep it from drying out.  Husband said it didn't taste like a rotisserie chicken but he liked it.

Super easy and amazingly moist, tender and flavorful!  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I didn't have white pepper, so I left it out.  I made gravy with the juices and it was delicious!

This chicken was beyond awesome.  Even my husband who dislikes chicken and refers to it as "dirty bird" ate an entire chicken himself.  I doubled the rub to make sure I had enough.  The chicken just fell off the bone.  This will become a cool weather favorite.  Thinking about trying this on a turkey and see if it's just as good.

Just made this recipe and it is nice, but isn't knocking my sox off. I didn't use a whole chicken, I tried pieces as I hate cutting up a whole bird.  Anyway it does have a lovely flavor and is moist.  My cooking time was reduced to 4 hours and I had no drippings for gravy.  Yes I left the skin on and didn't remove any fat so I would have drippings, but no luck.  I think I would go as previous reviews and add a bit of water part way through the cooking. I used smoked paprika and think next time I will try sweet. All in all I would make this again as the cooking method was relaxing.  FYI it didn't turn out sticky as hoped.

Make this all the time but I cook on 450 degrees for 25-30 minutes & then turn down to 375 degrees after adding water mid way high in the pan. Cook for an additional 1 hour until meat is tender & juicy. I also add a bit of coconut palm sugar to even out the taste (most seasoning blends have some form of sugar in it) add more if u like it sweet.

This recipe was ok. The chicken was good, but it tasted like some other roast chicken recipes I've made in the past, but without the extensive work this recipe required.

MAking this for the 2nd time tonight. The first time it came out AWESOME! It was so moist and tender. I let it sit in the fridge for 24 hours and I didn't use the white pepper, cause I couldn't find it, but I did increase the garlic powder and onion powder. We really like those flavors at my house. When we had eaten most of the chicken, I then boiled the bones till the rest of the meat came off the bones and had a divine chicken salad. I absolutely love this recipe!

Fabulous! I reduced the salt to only two tsp, one per bird and used 1/2 a sweet onion, 1/4 per bird.  This was so good, my 15 year old requested I make it again the following week for Christmas dinner! 
UPDATE 5/3/14 - I've made this many times since my first review. Today this was a spur of the moment decision, so I didn't have time to let it sit overnight.  I didn't even have 5 hours, so instead I combined it with sliced carrots and a few stalks of celery in a cooking bag.  It was in the oven for 2 hours at 350 degrees.  This time, however, I followed Madicakes' suggestion and added flour to the drippings on the stovetop to make gravy. The seasoning was fantastic - probably the best (and easiest) gravy I've ever made!

I've made it twice.  Once the skin was lovely, a little brown, and tender.  Once the skin was dry.   Both times the meat was perfect.  I will make this again.

I made this for Christmas dinner and am making it again today.  My family LOVED it!  Like others have suggested, make sure to make a gravy out of the pan drippings. I just added a little cornstarch to cold water, then mixed it in with the drippings in a sauce pan.  I put some mashed potatoes on a plate, topped it with chicken & drizzled the gravy over it all.  YUM!

I've been using this rub for several years.  I have a rotisserie and rub this under the skin.  I, too, thought it might be too spicy with the cayenne, but it isn't.  It give the chicken a wonderful flavor.  There's nothing like fresh rotisserie chicken.

This is a terrific recipe.   I didn't read the instructions until I started, so didn't marinate the chicken - and I cooked in in 1.5 hours, not the slow cook - and it was really fantastic.  We put potatoes, onion and squash in the pan with the bird for the last hour - delicious.

This is the best roasted chicken recipe I have ever tried! My 6 year old who is the pickiest child I've ever seen LOVED this chicken and the gravy you can make from the pan drippings. Yummo! It is a weekly staple for my family now so Thank You :-)

We mix up a bunch of the seasoning at once and then save the extra in a air tight container in the pantry.  Super quick prep that way!  Pan drippings make wonderful gravy as well.

I had only 1 4.5lb chicken. I followed the rub and put inside and out. I also added minced garlic and the onion in the cavity and wrapped in plastic wrap overnight. I baked on 250 for almost 4 hours with the breast side down the entire time. It was awesome and juicy!

I've made this for years!  I absolutely love it!  I do use the white pepper (suprisingly I find it at my local grocery store in the "ethnic" section - Badia brand.)  I seasoned my chicken tonight for Thanksgiving and didn't have onion powder so I used dried minced onion and increased the garlic powder.  Also, I brush my chicken with olive oil before seasoning, and I put carrot, celery, onion and lemon quarters in the cavity.  Chicken (and Turkey) comes out perfect.  I omit the cayenne pepper b/c it's too spicey for kids.  A+ chicken!  It's my go-to seasoning for holiday poultry.

I didn't bother measuring the ingredients, I just estimated.  The chicken was so tender and juicy.  I had a small bird, so only cooked for 4 hours.

This chicken even pleased my husband and he's not a "chicken guy".  It's moist and juicy and very flavorful. One thing I would note might be a reason some folks' results were dry is that the recommended internal temperature for whole chickens is 165 degrees.  If you let it roast all the way to 180 and then the temperature continues to rise while resting, the chicken could be over cooked and dry.

Excellent flavor, easy to cook. Definitely baste, then turn it up to 350 for the last 15-30 mins to crisp up the skin. Cook on top of quartered potatoes and add boiled beets for the last 30 mins or so for easy sides!

So delicious! I made it just as the recipe states and it came out perfect. When i make it again i may put some butter under the skin to make it a bit core crisp.

You can't go wrong with "Low and Slow" cooking chicken like this one. For the person with the dry and tough skin: perhaps you should have your oven calibrated. It is common for chicken skin to get tough when smoking at 225 or lower, but is eliminated when I turn it up a bit. I put mine in a brine overnight to really infuse the flavor and then added the spices before I cooked. It came out wonderful. Great for winters when you can't smoke.

This is amazing! I brined the chicken first.  Used less cayenne and no white pepper.  Butter pats under the skin, otherwise the recipe as directed.  I did baste a few times.  Moist, flavorful I think a new family favorite.  Easy recipe - only hard part was trying to get the plastic wrap to stay still long enough to wrap it! LOL

Absolutely fab!!!

I bought my first rotisserie cooker (Ronco 3000), and made this recipe because of the high rating. I didn't have time to marinate the chicken due to being in a bind. I used half of the ingredients on one bird that weighs 5.15 lbs. I skipped stuffing the poultry with the onions, and put in the cooker for about 1.25 to 1.50 hrs. It turned out to be tender, juicy and with the best flavor that is superior to most rotisserie chicken that I have sampled! You can't go wrong with this recipe. It's a keeper!

loved this!!!! a bit messy to prepare, but the flavor the following day is well worth it... I had also cut halved a lemon and inserted it into the cavity during the cooking.   It was a huge hit with everyone who tasted it!

I don't think this was anything special. I guess you just really can't get that true rotisserie style in the over. I did use leftovers for soup and chicken enchiladas so the meal itself went a long way. Worth it? Don't think so. I would prefer to go by a chicken from a mexican restaurant.

This is by far my favorite Roasted Chicken recipe.  I have made it multiple times and it ALWAYS turns out perfect with amazing to die for pan drippings that make a fabulous gravy to go with potatoes or in my case mashed cauliflower.  If you haven't yet, you MUST try this recipe!  You won't regret it!

Excellent, juicy, brown, skin very crisp.  Even gives you pan drippings.  I found it a bit peppery for my taste, but will make it again with a different blend of spices.  Just w of us, so after we ate it with noodles and a veg, then I used meat in chicken pot pies (4), and then used the carcass for soup.  So we got multiple meals from one chkcen!  Great value!

We love this recipe! I usually double all the seasoning except the salt and just use what I need to cover the birds. I like to squeeze some lemon juice over the onion before tucking it into the chickens. We get those huge (6-8lb) Perdue roasting chickens with the pop-up timers, keep one for ourselves and give one to family when they're done. Even with the larger size, in my oven they never take 5 hrs to finish - usually 4 to 4.5 hrs, so keep an eye out for the pop-up timer or test with a thermometer to be sure you don't overcook. Thanks for the great recipe!

This chicken in great!! Like many I made substitutions but that's because I didn't have 2 of the ingredients on hand. Instead of onion powder I used minced onion and instead of white pepper I used a pepper medley. The other reviewers had me a little scared about the amount of salt so I used 2 teaspoons of sea salt instead of the 4 tsp. The paprika gives this bird a nice caramel look and  once I made the first cut the rest of the chicken just fell off the bone. The remaining meat will be great on a sandwich! For me once I made this batch I didn't understand how it could season 2 chickens, so I ended up doubling that and using it on ONE chicken. I seasoned the inside, outside and under the skin. Then I stuffed the inside with the quartered onions and 4 cloves of garlic. Twice while baking I drizzled the drippings over the chicken. Flavor flavor flavor is what this chicken is..

Made this recipe for hubby and myself.  I would really watch the chicken for doneness, mine was a little over cooked, but will make it again.  Nice to have such a easy recipe.

I used 2pcs of split chicken breast (2lb) instead of one whole chicken. They were marinated for ~6hrs and cooked for ~3hrs at 250F. It was so good! This is one of must-have-it recipes.

Fanatastic, followed recipie as is, and it was the most moist and tender roast chicken I have ever eaten! Can't say it tastes exactly like the rotisserie chicken i'm used to, but I will definitely make again. Super easy and set it and forget it!

I really do not like chicken legs, however, my husband insists on buying them in bulk. So I looked and found this recipe. Excellent. I used half the salt and a stick of butter. I pulled back the skin on the chicken while it marinated and pulled it back up to roast. Huge it!

Yummy!  This was really good and pretty close to the taste of the rotisserie chicken I've gotten from the store.  As some had suggested, I did cook it in the slow cooker for about 4 hours (over some balls of aluminum foil so the chicken wouldn't sit in the juices). I tried to make it healthier by skinning the chicken first (which was the only hassle of this whole recipe....so that was my choice).  Other than my method, I didn't change a thing about the ingredients.  The chicken really did fall off the bones.  

I also used the really cool feature of changing the serving size (since I just wanted to make one chicken).  That made it simple to know how much of each spice to use ('cause I just didn't feel like doing math on the weekend).  

So glad I found this recipe.  Thanks Sue!

Tried this with two whole chicken breasts and just cut the spices down to 2 servings.  Gave the chicken a really good flavor and was tender. Of course I didn't cook two chicken breasts for 5 hours, but it was good nonetheless.  I can't wait to try it with whole fryers.

I have only attempted to cook an entire chicken one other time, and the results weren't worth the effort. THIS was delicious and well worth the minimal effort it took to prepare it! I will definitely be making it again! And I used the leftovers to make a delicious chicken salad the next day.

The season blend was awesome. I reduced the serving to 4, which indicates only (1) 4 to 5 pound bird. I put it on the rotisserie for 1 hour and 50 minutes and it was delicious! The skin lightly golden brown and juicy inside. Love the flavor!

We love this chicken.  I make several at a time and then freeze them.  Love to use the leftovers for chicken salad.

This is now my go to roast chicken recipe with only few minor adjustments.  I use 3 tsp of salt instead of 4; I use 1/2 the amount of paprika and cayenne; and I double the garlic powder.  I also add 2 tsp minced garlic to the cavity.

Great recipe.  Have made several times and always turns out perfect.  So easy and I never marinate the chickens, just season and throw in the oven.  I always make 2 chickens so that we can have chicken and dumplings the next day.

I tried this night with a 5.5 lb chicken but I found it to be a bit salty. I also had to baste the chicken to keep it from drying. Worth trying again tho :-)

Fantastic! By the end of the cooking period, the meat was falling off of the bones, and it was so very tasty. Will become a staple!

It's excellent. I didn't have any white pepper, so I omitted that ingredient. Still, I found the chicken to be fabulous. I plan to make this over and over again. :) Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This the BEST way for me to make baked chicken.  We all LOVED it!!  I used one whole chicken and one cut up, and they both were perfectly delicious being cooked in the same pan for the same amount of time.  I froze the left over chicken and we are going to have it tonight in "Chicken and Dumplings"  Great weekend meal to make and then have the leftover another time!!

WOW!  This chicken is better than they sell at the store!  We renamed the recipe "Walk Away Chicken" because it's so simple to make:  mix the spices, rub them in, throw the chickens in the oven and walk away!  The only change I made was since I didn't have white pepper, I used 1/2 tsp. of black pepper.  Delicious!  Also, be sure to save the drippings, it makes wonderful chicken noodle soup.

Great chicken!!! I tried this recipe earlier this year and almost went crazy that I didn't save it. Now that I've found it again I will be making it tonight but only in the crockpot. I didn't make any modifications.

Very easy to make and delicious.  I used a baking pan and surrounded the chicken with baby carrots, quartered onions and potatoes coated in a little olive oil and fresh ground pepper.

This was absolutely delicious and so simple!!  Even my 2 and 4 year old kids liked it!  Used a 5lb chicken, and kept the seasonings the same as outlined in the recipe.  I took one reviewer's advice, and put both garlic and onion inside the chicken.  Let it sit in the refrigerator overnight, then baked it for 4.5 hours.  It literally fell off the bones.  We will make this recipe again and again!

Wow!  Used one 7lb chicken and kept seasonings the same, with half salt.  After a few hours I had little to no drippings so I poured some chicken broth over the top (1/2 cup maybe?) and basted frequently which was fun since I've never roasted a chicken before, the basting really sucked up the delicious flavors so I added it to packaged gravy mix, but next time I will definitely make a gravy from scratch. *** I should add that along with all the fixings I was able to feed 12 people, but had only a little bit leftover

we love it ! i did omit the salt  when making the rub  for the  chicken  ,  like some review said , i just add a little  salt on top of the chicken when it came out  then put a little of the fat dripping on the top to   makes the skin  softer   that is my preference , but it doesn't need it -  as  for the salt you can always add but not take  away i also cooked it at 325  for 2 hours and it was perfect  falling of the bone .. i had never made  rotisserie chicken before , but i have to say this was wonderful--a keeper

I followed this recipe and it was probably one of the best roasted chickens that I have ever made.  Good flavor and very moist/tender.  Excellent!

Have used this recipe many times and it never fails.  I use oregano rather than thyme (personal preference) and omit the white pepper.  Since my first attempt, I keep an eye on cooking time.  So easy and so good!

Delicious. This was the best roasted chicken I have made. I did use one chicken, marinated overnight. It took my bird approx. 2 hours and 20 minutes to arrive at 175 degrees. I poured the pan juices in a pan and whisked in 2 T flour and 1 t salt while heating over medium stove. whisk 1+ minute and then add water--while whisking--to ward off lumps a bit at a time until it reaches your desired consistency. Served gravy over the bird and mashed potatoes. YUM!

I love this technique..  OMG for years I've been roasting chickens and always, always disappointed that the breast cooks before the legs ect...  I took the base rub ingredients and added some of my own that I like and let the chicken rest over night... I've even used this just by letting it marinate for 4 hours and the flavor is fantastic!   Juicy chicken breasts, crispy skin and the family loves this.. I work from home so I can do this any day of the week.. And the left overs I use for chicken salad has made my chicken salad to die for.. Thanks for this recipe.. I tell everyone about it..

This is great. I love the mix of the spices but it is a bit too salty for me so i cut that in half. I have also done it without marinating it overnight and it was just as good!

This is such a great recipe! My husband and I absolutely loved it! My 18 month old is a very picky eater but she ate it like it was candy. I followed the recipe exactly but added 1/2 teaspoon sweet basil, and I cooked it in a dome roasting pan at 300 until my meat thermometer reached 170. I will definitely be cooking this again!!!

I have one of those stand up bakers, where you put a liquid in the center, and plug the neck hole with an onion to "steam bake" your chicken. This combo is excellent for that. The skin is seasoned and crisp, the chicken moist and tender. Thanks!

Great flavor and super moist chicken. I made this with bone in chicken breasts that I had on hand.  My 3 picky eaters loved it and the gravy was great.  Used the left overs for chicken soup the next night.  Excellant again!!

This is wonderful chicken. Since our family cannot eat both chickens at one meal I often pick the second one off the bone. It make wonderful chicken salad or chicken for other recipes. My family just loves it.

This was great!  I liked the recipe so much that I decided to mix the seasonings (x10) and store them in a mason jar in my spice cabinet, for easy access anytime I have a taste for rotisserie style chicken.  I also have used the spices on boneless breast of chicken and cook at 325 for 45 mins.  I plan on trying it on the grill next.

Gets full marks in our house! This was better than the store bought chickens. I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have time to let it marinate. I can just imagine how good this would be if I marinated it overnight.

I was very excited about trying this recipe.  Who doesn't love rotisserie chicken?  Unfortunately, although I followed the recipe to a "T," I just can't recommend it.  While the chicken was moist and tender, it was not any better than any other chicken I have roasted and more trouble.  I will probably use the spice blend again but will rub some under the skin over the breast.  Will, however, probably double the amount.  I won't let it sit in the refrigerator overnight nor will I roast for 5 hours.  I can't help but wonder about the numerous rave reviews.   What did I miss?

This chicken was incredibly moist and delicious, but it was a bit too salty for me and I'll be sure to cut down on it if I make it again.  I wasn't a huge fan of the cayenne in it, so next time I'll just omit that and use parsley flakes and some italiano seasoning. I also like to make small slits in the skin of the chicken and tuck a slice of garlic in the most meaty of places on the breast and legs. The garlic melts keeps the chicken moist and flavourful as well (for garlic fans) but even without doing this, the chicken is quite moist!

I never rate a recipe but with this one I thought I would take the time to do so... I have made this 20 + x's  and it always turns out great.. Follow the cooking time and oven temp but pls play around with your favorite spice mix..  Always keep it over night wrapped tight in plastic, I use a plastic bag from the grocery store, it works perfectly..  Stuff the cavity with a large bunch of fresh herbs and onion... yumo!!

Very easy to make and great taste every time.  Have made this recipe many times for my husband and myself.  I use the second chicken for sandwiches the next day.  Really tastes like rotisserie chicken from deli.

Yum.  This is so good.  Juicy and moist.  I cooked 1 chicken, marinated in for 4 hours.  Didnt' find my cayenne pepper but it's great anyway.  Made gravy from the pan drippings.  My family wanted to know where I had bought it.

Did not have time to marinate overnight so I used one of those reynolds oven bags and roasted it in the oven.  I have not tasted the chicken yet...still in the oven.  It looks and smells great.  Lots of juices.  I removed the chicken from the oven bag and am now crisping the skin.  I can tell that this will be a great meal my family will wnjoy.

This was an amazingly moist chicken. I dont usually like white meat as it usually seems dry to me.However not with this recipe ! I needed lots of chicken meat forgreat sandwiches to feed a moving party. Didnt have time to marinate for more than an hour ,followed the rest exactly and got rave reviews. Some leftovers still great days later.Sandwiches were foccacia bread and spread of ground rosemary,mayo and dijon mustard. Crowd pleaser.

This makes excellent chicken.  Everyone in my family seems to all have different tastes but they all agree that this is super yummy, even my very picky 12 year old.

I made this last night for dinner and it was a total hit!  My family loved it, and this is hard to do in my house because I have picky boys!  So easy and good it's a must try for sure.

I made this for the second time. This time I used chicken leg quarters and whole chicken breasts (bone in). By doing so, I was able to cut the cooking time down to 3 hours. Basting is key with the recipe. P.S. The leftover chicken makes the best chicken salad ever!

AMAZING!  I didn't put the onion in the cavity but everything else was exact!  Just perfect... Looking forward to doing this chicken when having a party... load up the oven and relax till the company arrives!
I anticipate fights over the crispy skin! Thanks for a Great Recipe!

Great recipe!! Just made it today and it was just like a store bought rottiserie chicken but BETTER! For those of you who are short on time, like me, I did not marinate chicken in spices before throwing in the oven. I rubbed chicken with spice recipe (exactly what recipe called for) and put right in the oven at 250 for 3 hours and last hour set temp at 375. I used a 5 1/2 pound chicken and it was done perfectly in 4 hours. I also used drippings for gravy and to coat top of chicken last 45 min or so.

Out of necessity, I used drumsticks.  And because of time constraints, I baked this in a 425 oven.  This was delicious!  Better than Boston Market, even.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I omitted the white pepper (we live in a small town and our grocery store didn't have it), otherwise I followed the recipe as written.  My husband claimed, "This is seriously the best chicken I've ever had!"  I'd say that means it's a keeper ;)

I have made this chicken time and time again.  It has become a GREAT standby to use especially when I am expecting a crowd of people.  They are astounded when I share how simple this delicous recipe is!  It is also VERY easy to cut in half for smaller groups!

This is a great recipe! The changes I make are simple to the tastes of my 6 kids who like a sweeter dish. I replace the onion with quartered apples and oranges and add 4 tablespoons brown sugar to the dry rub. Awesome!!!! I have also found that I can cut the cooking time down by an hour.

We halved the recipe and just made one whole chicken.  Delicious!  Definitely use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of your chicken to be sure it is done.

The seasoning blend alone is 5 stars! Chicken came out nice and juicy (no basting needed), and drippings made delicious gravy. However, it was done in about 3 hrs. so it is important to check temp. to make sure you don't overcook it. But low and slow is definetly my new preferred cooking method for chicken.

A little to salty for my taste I would cut the salt by a 1/3.  And it was dry!  I'm going to try cooking at 350 and see how it turns out.

May use the slow, long cooking method for once in a while for rotisserie style; however, the flavor just didn't do it for me...

Super good - I followed recipe to a "T" except that I only used one chicken and halved the spices accordingly.  It cooked to perfection in only 2 1/2 hours (glad I checked the temperature!).  Amazing flavor and I WILL be making this again.

I made one chicken only (5lbs) and modified the spices per my judgement.  The flavoring was good, though it didn't really seep into the chicken.  I was fearful that roasting at such a low temp for so long would dry out the chicken but this was a VERY moist and tender chicken.  My only issue is that there was no pan drippings, there was nothing to baste it with even by the 4th hour! I had to coat it with olive oil to make sure the skin didn't dry out.  I did raise it about a half inch on a roasting rack, maybe that was it? Also, this was not sticky as the name implied. I did think it came out tasty though, but not as expected.

This was FABULOUS!  It was easily the moistest, most flavorful chicken I've ever eaten. I realized as I pulled it from the oven that I baked it upside down.  As I tried to turn it over, it fell apart--it was just that moist.  FYI, I let mine marinate overnight.  Great recipe!

My house smelled soooo good while this was cooking!  I did everything as directed (except I didn't have cayenne) and baked it on racks in the roasting pans.  It was perfect!  The drippings made wonderful gravy as well!  New family favorite.

Excellent!  I used an 8lb roaster to cut costs (cheaper per pound than using fryers) and cooked it for 8 hours until the thermometer read 175 degrees.  The meat was moist and flavorful and the skin was perfect.  My five year old asked to have this every day!  The only thing I will change next time is to use a little less salt and cayenne, but that is just personal preference.

Followed recipe exactly as written.  The meat was moist but the skin was pale and very unattractive, not crisp at all.  Made gravy with the pan drippings.  My gravy usually comes out excellent but not this time -- the cayenne made it a little too spicy.  Don't think I'll make this again.

Yummy and delicious! Mouth watering chicken that smells great while its cooking.  I did a faster version with the rub and cooked for 2 hrs on 180 (depends on size of the chicken)

This has become a staple menu item in my home. I make the "rub" as I call it in a small container and cover one decent size whole chicken, put it in an oven bag and cook on 250' for 2-3 hours and it is fall apart tender and tastes devine. I also sprinkle the "rub" on skinless thighs and cook @ 375' for 15-20 minutes for a quicker but still delicious meal. If you dont like spicy you may want to lessen the red pepper (cayenne). Also for a healthier recipe use less salt. I keep it as is and do half sea salt and half regular.

Overall a good recipe.  Did one 5 pound chicken and had to turn up the oven to 375 degrees after 2 hours because the temp was not rising on the bird.  The skin wasn't as crispy as I thought it would be, but I covered it with foil for the first 2 hours to prevent drying as other reviewers commented on.  Used the leftover chicken in the "Slow Cooker Chicken Enchilada Soup" recipe on this site, and the spicy flavor of the chicken went well with this recipe.  Expected more from so many 5 star reviews, but I would make this again with a few changes.

Loved this chicken. It so tasted like the store bought rotissery chicken. I did two at a time  like the  recipe and used chickens that were on clearnace and used the pan drippings to make chicken stock.I didn't let the chickens sit overnight with the spices. I just put the spice mixture over them and roasted them the correct time. The meat fell off the bones.

I tried this recipe with a family size package of chicken thighs instead of two whole chickens. I washed and removed the skins (interested in lowering the fat) and rubbed the spice mixture all over both sides. Placed the pieces in a glass bowl and put in a chopped medium onion and covered in plastic wrap and placed in the refrigerator overnight. When I arranged the pieces in the baking pan I put a little olive oil on each piece (concerned about the pieces drying without the skin) and baked. It was wonderful! I served with cous cous.

I thought the seasoning was the best that I have had on a roasted chicken.  I love the fact that you can put it in the oven and take a good part of the day to bake it!  I have other recipes that I can cook in an hour when in a rush.  I do like the skin to be a bit more crisp so next time I think I will cook it at a higher temperature for the last hour and hope that will not dry out the chicken.  This chicken is very moist!  Very good recipe!

Amazing!!!  This is so worth doing a good 24 hours ahead.  Not only is the skin flavorful but the chicken under has a wonderful flavor as well.  I have given this recipe to friends already and they love as well.  Thanks for sharing!!

Made this as part of my Valentine's dinner. I was short on time so I didn't let it rest overnight or even the recommended 4-6 hours, closer to 2 hours and it still turned out great. Very good flavors. Smelled delicious while cooking. Will definately make again.

This tasted very good, I guess I was expecting out of this world taste due to the ratings.  I will make it again and do 2 chickhens, cook it is a bag so my veggies will cook, do it at 275 so it won't take over 5 hours to cook, use cloves of garlic instead of the onion, and maranaide longer than the 16 hours I did it for.  Leftovers were great the next night in the potato lasagne. Thank you for sharing, will use it again.

Didn't really get the "sticky" part. The chicken had a really good flavor, though. This was my first time seasoning anything with white pepper.

Very easy and good.  I used a smaller chicken and took in out at 4.5 hours and it was done.  Probably could have gone more like 4 hours, but it was still tender.  Thanks.

I made some substitutions but it came out delicious!

I only made 1 chicken so I used all the spices on just the 1 chicken. I didn't have onion powder or white pepper so I doubled both garlic powder and black pepper. Yum.

Followed the recipe exactly. The absolute best roast chicken I have ever made. Very moist and tender. Only thing I did different was baste the chicken a couple of times with the juices that accumulate in the bottom of the pan in the last hour or so. Thanks for the great recipe.

I tried this because it was easy....I will make it again because it was delicious!!!!  I just made once chicken and it turned out perfect.  Put it in the oven before a day of shopping and the house smelled wonderful.  I made it just like the recipe said and wouldn't change a thing.

If you think the best part of the chicken is the crispy chicken skin then this recipe is the awesome.  I would be happy eating the entire chicken skin and skipping the chicken altogether :)

This is the first recipe I tried off of this site. And the first time I ever made a roasted chicken. I was hesitant at first, since Im more of a hamburger helper chef. But, wow! It was so simple to make. And my family loved it! Will definitely be making this often!

WOW!!!  This was the best chicken I have ever eaten!!  So easy to prepare days ahead of time.  I do suggest basting during the last hour.  I din't bast mine at all and it looked a little dry.  However, I poured some of the juices over it after I pulled it out of the oven, and it looked great!  I was so incredibly moist and PERFECT!!  I did not have onion powder, but we never missed it.  I am definately making this over and over and over and over!!!

Made this for friends for dinner. The meat was very tender and it was quite simple to prepare. I did not find that I got the "sticky" finish, but it was still very good.

This chicken is the bomb I made it, it came out so juciy and tender. I was kind of worried that it would dry out but it didn't. I just made a couple changes like along with the onion in the cavity i also put a half of lemon and squeezed some of the lemon juice on the chicken. I used the drippings to make some pan gravy to go with my mashed potatoes.! Yum I will defintely make this again!

This was the first whole chicken I have ever made and everyone loved it! My husband was very impressed. About 3/4 of the way throught the cooking time I added whole cloves of garlic that I crushed and some chicken broth the the bottom of the roasting pan. I poured all of the drippings in a gravy boat and it was delicious!

This was by far the BEST baked chicken I have ever had. I was afraid it would be spicey, but it was not at all. It had the perfect kick. I have made this since with chicken breast (bone in) just to make it a bit quicker.... It is definetly the go to chicken recipe in my house... thanks for a great way to use chicken :)

This was my first time cooking a whole chicken and I am very pleased with the results!  There's only 2 of us so I used 1-4lb bird and took it out after 3 hours. It wasn't fall off the bone, but it was tasty none the less.   Will definitely try this recipe again and will reduce the thyme and increase the others.  Thyme was way too prevalent this go round.  I will be using the leftovers for chicken pot pie and chicken soup and i think the chicken is going to make both taste great!

I was skeptical about the claims, but was thrilled with the results.  This is without a doubt the best home made roasted chicken recipe I have ever come across.  Spiced just right and moist through and through.  Loved it!!

My goodness, this was amazingly moist and flavorful-- even though I only had time to marinate for 2 hours.   I simplified preparation by doing the marinating step in a roasting bag, which could then be tied and transferred directly to the oven.    This will be my go-to roast chicken recipe from now on!

This was just the taste I was looking for! I used these seasoning for a slow-cooked a whole chicken, covered; then uncovered and baked at a high temp to make the skin crisp. Made great sandwiches!

Oh wow, this recipe is flavorful, and the chicken was moist and tender.  I made a 6 lb chicken and it was done in 4 hrs 15 mins at 300. I applied the rub the night before and let it sit in my fridge until it was time to put it in the oven.  DH asked if we could rate it higher than 5, it was that good!  I planned to make tortilla soup with the leftovers but now I don't think there will be any!

Best Rotersseri Chicken Recipe.  I use it with my Ronco Rotesseri.   Always get compliments, juicy, with just the right amount of spice. The thyme and white pepper add that flavor you are looking for in Rotesseri chicken.   Once replaced cayenne with chilie powder, excellent also.

This recipe is very good. I think with some tweaks it would be a five star recipe. Be sure to check the chicken periodically because you may over cook the chicken. I think I should have cooked it for 4 hours instead of 5. I also would maybe double the seasoning for the chickens because the seasoning sticks to your hands while rubbing them. Overall this recipe was worth trying out.

You must try this.  Again so easy.  Next time wholelchickens are on sale, I may buy several and fix them like this.  It did not even take 4 hours...guess it depends on the size chicken.  Yumbo!!!

Yum Yum. This was my first time baking a whole chicken and I think I will be doing it more often. I only used one chicken, so I pretty much halved the recipe. I added a few extra spices and had to use a little rosemary because I was out of thyme. I added a few whole garlic cloves to the inside with the onion. I only needed to cook for about 3 1/2 hours to get to temp. It was so moist and flavorful, and the scraps made the best chicken stock for soup. Thanks for a great recipe.

If you actually use a rotisserie this will be the best chicken you have ever had.  I gave it four stars because as is it is a little dry so we decided to put it in the rotisserie the next time.  Just omit the onion and stick in the rotisserie @ 15 per pound, you will absolutely love the results (if you have a rotisserie).

Excellent recipe! I follow this recipe with only one change. I don't eat onions so I leave them out and I put garlic inside instead. It is so yummy! I have one in the fridge waiting for tomorrow to cook! My boyfriend loves it as well! Thanks!

Good, moist chicken. Didn't have any white pepper, but the chicken was delicious without it.  My 2, 4.5lb birds were done in about 4 hours.

This turned out perfect. My family thinks I'm a fabulous cook after tasting this perfectly seasoned and juicy chicken! I had plenty of leftovers too so I was able to use the rest of the chicken for chicken burritos the next night. Great recipe!

I have to admit I did not use your cooking method since I was in a hurry. But, I did use all the ingredients for seasoning. It turned out very nice.

So awesome! I loved this chicken! I used fresh thyme and also put some minced garlic inside the chicken, but otherwise followed the recipe. If you have the time, let it sit in the fridge for the full 24 hours soaking up the spices goodness!

This is an amazing recipe. I was nervous about putting a large onion inside because nobody in my family likes onion, but I did it anyway and WOW! not oniony at all, but enhanced so much of the flavor! seasoning it and letting it sit overnight is crucial for the flavor. dont make this unless you can prepare it properly. its delicious. i followed the recipe 100% and was very happy with the results! will be making this one many more times for sure!

this is a great meal. It is so easy and the leftovers are great. I didn't have enough time so I marinated for 5 hours and then cook it at 325 degrees for a total of 2 and half hours. I also used the same amount of seasoning but instead of two chickens I used 1. Great tasting and leftovers were even better. I was worried that it would get dry so I added a little olive oil to baste it. Hmm... don't make that mistake because it came out too oily.

Exactly what a chicken should be - moist, juice and flavorful.  Entire family, both white and dark meat lovers, enjoyed this chicken.  It does require some time, but not a lot of hands on time.  Will keep this recipe handy and make a lot.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Absolutely delicious! Followed recipe ingredients, placed rub inside and out and gently lifted skin from breast and legs of chicken and placed rub on meat, it was the best roast chicken ever, highly recommend!

I give this 100 stars!  I don't eat chicken skin, so I was super tempted to spread the seasoning under the skin as well.  100% unnecessary!!!  Follow the directions.  Wash and dry the chickens (and gosh yes, roast two chickens, not just one), rub the outside of the skin with the seasoning, wrap them up and place them in the fridge overnight.  Somehow (I think it's witchcraft), the seasoning permeates the skin and results in the most flavorful, juicy, amazing chicken ever! The 5 hour cooking time is no big deal.  (Note:  I've made this recipe twice, and it actually took a little more than 5 hours.)  Buy your chickens on sale, stuff your freezer with them, and make this dish often.  The (super flavorful) leftover meat can be used in a thousand different ways.  This is one amazing recipe.

This recipe was excellent! however i was in a time crunch so made it with only 5 small sized chicken breasts and didn't marinate over night. just rubbed it down immediately and let it sit for about 15 mins...   so i had to alter things some what.  i cooked it at 450 for about 30-45 mins.... i used the same rub and cut up an onion and put it in the pan as well with about 4 tablespoons of butter to give it a great crisp and hold the moisture.  then i removed the chicken from the pan and used teh onion and butter sauce at the bottom of the pan for roasted potatoes. i cut them up and seasoned them and tossed them back in the oven at 450 for 40 mins.  PERFECTION!

SO good I made a whole seasoning jar. When I want a good rotisserie style chicken, I just mix with olive oil with a couple tablespoons and brush on chicken. It browns beautifully.

This was very good. In addition to having a wonderful meal, I now have plenty of cooked chicken in the freezer for other recipes. Next time I will put the chicken in the bag before I rub the spice mix on it, and I will put some of the mix under the skin.

this chicken was absolutely amazing. i turned up the oven to about 265 or so the first couple hours because i put it in a bit late...BIG mistake. it would have been wonderful the way directions said, except only 4 1/2 hours! in effect, it turned out a little dry after only 4 1/2 hours but wouldn't have, i bet, with my "correction". very very juicy and full of flavor! next time maybe a little less salt but either way it will be great. definitely a keeper!!!

This was fantastic!  My daughter (11) said it was the best chicken she has ever ate.  She wanted leftovers in her lunch the next day.  I did not have time to let sit overnight so I rubbed both chickens down with olive oil then the dry rub.  I baked for 4.5 hours @ 250 and it was perfect.  I will for sure make this again!

I love this recipe! The fist time I did this my boyfriend really loved it....  My mom and her bf visited last week and I made this for our dinner. and they loved it!!! The only thing is I used the Turbo broiler and cooked it for 45 mins. (chicken breast facing up) and I turned the chicken to cook the other side for 15 mins.... It turned out really good. Crispy on the outside and juicy in the inside. Very tasty!!! Thanks Sue!

Getting your chicken ready the night before makes all the difference! I omitted the white pepper since I don't keep that on hand, and the thyme (don't like it). Subbed some oregano/parsley for it. Rubbed the spice mix under the skin also, with a few pats of butter. Had to roast at 400 because of time restraints, but still turned out juicy! This will be the only roast chicken I make from now on.

Followed the recipe as written, except cut it in half as I was making only one chicken.  It was WONDERFUL!  The flavor was closest to deli-style rotisserie chicken that I've tried and very VERY tender, moist, and delicious.  Don't forget to make some gravy with the pan drippings!  My husband said he'd be happy to eat this every week.

I have lost count on how many times I have made this recipe. I have got a seasoning shaker just for this recipe. I over time have bought whole chickens well on sell, seasoned and freeze. Defrost and cook when need be. This chicken is much better then the 'store' version in my opinion. Thank you

Four stars for the method; super tender and moist.  On the stickiness scale, a 2.

Delicious! Tastes very similar to store-bought rotisserie chicken but costs much less. I followed the recipe exactly, minus stuffing the cavities with onions. I didn't find the chicken to be sticky, just very moist and bursting with flavour. Definite keeper!

This is exactly what I've been looking for.  I have a rotisserie oven and have tried chicken in it several times and it has never been great!  This was great!  I followed the recipe except for the following...  I omitted white pepper, cut the cayenne and black pepper in half.  At 7:30 this morning I removed the giblets and rinsed and dried the (4 lb.) chicken.  I then rubbed it with olive oil and covered the inside and out with the spices and placed it back in the fridge until 9:45 when i placed it in the rotisserie and 2 hours later it was cooked to perfection!  I did try to put the onion inside, but most of it fell out during cooking.  I also collected the drippings and put them in a sauce pan and added a small can of chicken broth and 1 1/2 tsp. of cornstarch and brought it to a boil until thickened.  Mashed some potatoes and it was a fantastic meal!  Will have again soon since my picky hubby loved it!

Very moist, wonderful flavor!  Whole family liked it.  I did one 7+ lb roaster, prepped it the night before then put it in the oven at 8am and it was ready when we got home from church.  The perfect thing for Sunday dinner.

Wow!   I've been making this chicken recipe for years with slight variations.  I only use 1 tsp. of salt, 1/2 tsp. of onion powder, and 1/4 tsp. of white pepper and no black pepper.  I add a tsp. of marjoram & 1/2 tsp. poultry seasoning.  It is the best!  The meat just falls off the bones and makes the best chicken broth that is definitely worth freezing to use later in soups and to saute vegetables.  I cooked 3-4 chickens at a time and freeze in 2-3 cups freezer quart bags to use in many recipes in a quick snap.

The best rotisserie chicken!  I just rubbed the spices on right before I cooked it and cooked it at 350 and 20 min per pound.  Easy and quick!

LOVE! LOVE! LOVE this recipe! I often would buy the store rotisserie chickens when 3 of my 5 kids were found to have problems with gluten. I found that most seasonings they used had some form of gluten in them. When I made this recipe along with the gravy, my 5 yr old son stuffed himself on it and had a bit of mashed potatoes with his gravy. A definite keeper! I've even used this for our Thanksgiving turkey...yum!

3 1/2 stars actually.  Moist, but not as good as rotisserie chickens.  I followed the recipe exactly as stated but I felt the chicken's taste was still kind of boring like the way baked chicken usually is.  We do not eat the skin so I guess I expected the flavor to be within the meat.  I did not find the flavor to be infused the way the store bought versions are. Update: I made with chicken breasts only and the flavor seemed to infuse more.  I baked 2 hrs @ 250 degrees, and 20 minutes @ 350 to brown.  I liked it better this way.

This Easter we had a rotisserie chicken contest between my husband and I with my family as the judges. Although no one would come out and say it it was very clear that this recipe beat the chicken done in our GF Rotisserie Cooker. I followed someones suggestion and cooked it for four hours and turned it up for a short time in the middle. I also added water to the bottom of my roasting pan and basted the chicken occasionally. I halved the cayenne pepper to make it less spicy. Since I only did one bird it worked out ok, but if I was to do two I would double the seasoning mixture. Everyone said the chicken was nice and juicy and had a nice flavor. We will be making this many times.

This chicken is FABULOUS!!  The best and easiest roast chicken I've ever made.  I did add about 1/2 cup of water to the pan and basted throughout the cooking, however.

Ok, my 25 cents: 4.5 stars cuz of salt called for but...Best chicken ever! I mix up a large spice bottle of spice rub although I use way less salt. You can always add more salt but you can't remove it :) My method is: I mix 3 T of butter, 1 tsp of seasoning + a tsp of lemon juice. I place a blob under the breast skin and spread it around by rubbing top of skin with my hands. Then place on sheets of plastic wrap I have ready & liberally shake spice mix all over skin and wrap that baby up. Much better left in fridge overnight but it's still darn good after 4 hours hang time. I bake 1 - 4 to 5lb bird & it turns out perfect after 4 hrs (last 30 minutes at 350). I start with breast side down & flip it over midway. Allow to rest for 10 to 15 mins afterwards. I use crushed cloves of garlic, sprigs of fresh rosemary and chunks of lemon in cavity vs onion. I also add 1-1/2 cups of chicken stock to pan since my chicken is elevated while roasting. Makes great gravy for mashed taters and moping dinner rolls in. When whole chickens on sale, I buy 2 or 3, get them seasoned and wrapped up and freeze for another time. Well, this chicken isn't necessarily 'sticky' but I like the low/slow roasting process and can control how I want seasoned vs buying a premade one at store.

Great recipe!  Better than rotisserie chicken from the store because it's not all ooey & gooey on the outside, nice & crisp.  And what a great idea of putting the chicken in the bag then seasoning it.  I made more mess measuring out the spices than coating the chicken.  Drippings make great gravy.  Chicken is tasty & moist.  What more could you want?  Long slow roasting does wonders for chicken.  Thanks so much for all your comments & suggestions.  And thanks, Sue, for a wonderful recipe.

This is an awesome recipe if you're looking for rotisserie flavor without having a rotisserie at home! Similar to other users, I cut this recipe and only use 1 whole fryer chicken instead of 2 and it always turns out great.  I found keeping the chicken marinating overnight does make a difference but it tastes great either way. The leftovers are awesome although we rarely have any!

Love, love this recipe.  Whatever chicken we don't eat, I use in pot pie, wild rice chicken soup, etc.  There's usually not a lot left over though.

Best. Chicken. EVER.  My husband (not a chicken fan, as he deems it too healthy!) loved it.  Kids loved it.  I thought it tasted better than rotisserie chicken from the store.

I have made this twice now and my co-workers as well. This is just awesome. You have to marinate it overnight-- at least 24 hrs. to let the seasoning absorb. But the taste is worth the time. It's the easiest thing to make. I recommend that everyone should try this.

Great recipe.  I been using this recipe for a while before becoming a member.  I am finally a member and decided it deserved my 5 stars!  I sometimes use whole chicken legs instead.  4 whole chicken legs would bake for about 1 1/2 hours to 2 hours, internal temperature must reach 160 degrees. They always turn out great.  Thanks for the recipe.  I am a fan.

I took my chances on making this. It turned awesome! It smelled just like ones in the supermarket.  I did not have white pepper and cayenne pepper but it was not miss.  A one for the recipe book!

This is the only way I will serve roast chicken!!!  Moist, flavorful, and the leftovers make THE BEST chicken soup!  This is almost as good as using a crock pot... just prep the chicken, put it in the oven and a few hours later you have a wonderful dinner!  YUM!

Delicious! This was the first time I have ever roasted a chicken, I only did one and halved the recipe accordingly. Cooked for just over 4 hours and I could have probably taken it out a little earlier as the white meat was just a TINY bit dry. Tasted, looked and smelled amazing. Will definitely serve many times again as it was a very simple recipe! Thanks!

What more can I say?  Would give 20 stars if possible.  Maybe the best recipe on this site.  Chicken came out juicy and flavorful.  So simple to throw together too.  This could be a great base for other recipes such as enchiladas or chicken salad.  Will be making on a weekly basis.

The bird did turn out tender and juicy with this method.  The seasoning was a little too salty for my taste.  I'm not sure why both white and black pepper is recommended...just black works fine.  In baking just one bird, I would say the recommended 5 hours is too long.

We have had this twice now.  I put my chicken on a 'beer butt' chicken rack.  They both turned out excellent.  Don't scrimp on the onions, they taste great with (or without) the chicken.  I did 'tent' mine after it got nicely browned  (we like the skin).

I guess I am in the minority on this one. Cooking method is pretty good. Chicken was moist. The skin never crisped up -- which is part of why I like rotisserie chicken. I turned up the heat in the oven and tried to crisp it up at the end. It helped. The flavor was not great. WAY too much onion. Blech. Other than that, honestly, little flavor. Overall I was disappointed. Might make some adjustments and try again another day. Meanwhile -- carcass is in a pot making chicken stock (so all is not lost).

This was amazing! I only made one chicken but used the same amount of spice as the recipe called for, so I doubled the spice. I rubbed all over and under the skin. In addition to stuffing with onions, I also stuffed with about 3 chopped garlic cloves. I only needed to roast for 4 hours.  This was seriously an awesome dinner. My husband was extremely pleased and we couldn't wait to eat the left overs. I served with homemade buttermilk biscuits, parmesean potatoes and grilled zucchini.  I can't wait to make this again!

Great, great, great!  Moist, tender, and seasoned to perfection.  I'm sorry I only cooked one chicken!  One was not enough!  I think I will explore with turkey wings.  Thanks, Allrecipes!

Hands down, this is my family's favorite roast chicken recipe.  I make it exactly as written and it is perfect every time.  I did take the advice of one reviewer and prepared extra seasoning to keep on hand and this makes it even easier to just pop a chicken in the oven and forget it.  Thank you SO much for sharing this!

This was really awesome! It definitely lives up to all the hype.  This was my first time making a roast chicken and it came out amazing...moist, flavorful, fall-off-the-bone wonderful! And the best part was how easy it was. I followed the recipe exact & will definitely be making it again with no changes!

I feel bad giving this a bad review after all the good reviews. I followed the recipe and roasted the chickens for five hours at 250 degrees and they were extremely dry. The white meat was inedible.  I ended up with a lot of juices in the pan and no carmelizing or stickiness happened for me.  The seasonings tasted very good and that is why I am giving this two stars instead of one.

Since so many reviewers have tweaked this recipe one way or another, I thought it might be helpful to include my own review, because I changed nothing from the original recipe. This is, without doubt, the best roasted chicken I have ever eaten. It cooked for about four hours, and was still intact, but so very juicy and tender. The rub is exactly enough for two nice-sized chickens. I'll never use any other recipe for roast chicken. Thanks for the great recipe.

We liked this. Tried it because one reviewer said it tastes just like Costo's rotissery chicken...it doesn't, but it makes a very moist chicken.  Also, we didn't bake it, we put it on the BBQ using the rotisserary to cook it. One chicken took about 4 hours out on the BBQ.  Super easy recipe, but very time consuming.

Pretty good!!  I had to leave out the white pepper since I didn't have any and added garlic to the inside with the onions.  Used 1-7lb bird instead of 2 smaller ones.  And plenty of delicious leftovers.

LOVED the chicken.  Haven't tried a whole bird yet, but have used cut-up chicken.  Followed recipe with no changes.  Have made it twice in less than a week!

It was very good.  Can't get much easier than this.  Mine didn't get sticky. I cooked my 4lb chickens a little over 4 hours.

This is soooo good.  It tastes just like the Costco rotisserie chicken.  I left out the white pepper and cayenne pepper.   I cooked my whole chicken about 4 hours, it was perfect.  Very economical- you can get a whole chicken on sale and use it for numerous meals.  I plan on freezing the leftovers  for this purpose.

Oh, yeah. That's the ticket. Deli chicken no more, I'm going to this recipe from now on. My modifications (we always have some, don't we): I added 1/2 tsp smoked paprika, doubled the garlic powder and used about 1 tsp less salt. And I added two cloves garlic in each chicken cavity. Otherwise followed the recipe and will make this again and again, using my oven rotisserie spit. Thanks for a great recipe. UPDATE: I no longer have that handy oven, so I use my brand-new convection oven. Still cut back the salt, now by half actually, and double the garlic powder, use ground thyme, and man, I'm so glad someone reminded me of this recipe. I'm just now licking my lips from enjoying it tonight. As for the salt content, as a friend from here once said: If you don't like that much salt, use less salt! So that's what I do here, and I'll state again, no more supermarket rotisserie chickens for me. This one is as easy as using my Crockpot. Thanks again!

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, only doubling the spice mixture.  My bird was pretty big so next time I'll only need one, but will use this extra one for enchiladas later this week!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is my new Sunday dinner! Best chicken ever! Rub the seasonings UNDER the skin and on top & definitely shorten the cook time. Mine was ready in 3 hours but I let it go 3 1/2. It was PERFECT! Moist & delicious. I've made it twice in the past week!

Probably one of the moistest chicken I have ever had - but - I read other reviews where the cooking time was too long. I cooked (1) 4 lb. chicken for 3 hours.  PERFECT!

It was great thought it was a lot of pepper but it wasn't, will make again and again. The chicken had a nice flavor and so moist and tender. I used our set it and go rotisserie and it was ready in 2 1/2hrs for a 8 1/2 lb. roaster chicken. Thanks for a great recipe

It was very good, but mine tuned out a little dry.  I don't think my chicken was as big as he recipe, so I cooked it too long.  Will try it again, except this time I will check the internal temperature with a meat thermometer throughout the process.

Wow...I think I could eat ths entire chicken up! I made this in the morning and let it sit while at work. Instead of the oven I used a Showtime Rotisserie cooked for an hour. It tasted as good/better than a store bought chicken rotissarie. (Plus I was really excited about using white pepper!) This one is going into my regulars and I'm sharing with friends :)

Delicious! I didn't find white pepper so I skipped that, I used whole cut up chicken and I didn't have a roasting pan so I used a casserole dish. it didn't matter, it was just right. There is no way to top this recipe.

This chicken was yummy, though I'm not sure why it's called sticky.... I would definitely decrease the salt next time, though I used a kosher chic,ken, which is salted already. I increased the garlic powder to 1 tsp, omitted the white pepper and only used 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper.

This was really good.  I followed the recipe accordingly minus the onion powder as I didn't have any on hand.  I roasted 1 5lb. chicken so I reduced the cooking time by 1 hour.  My bird was not "over done" but I think next time I will trim off another 15-20 minutes.  I bet if I  did it would be that much tastier.

Yes, another great review. So juicy. I couldn't believe how good flavour it had. I make whole chickens often but, never as good as this. This is a keeper. I am already going to make it for a second time.

The only reason I only gave it 4 stars is b/c I didn't use whole chickens but boneless breasts instead...they were a teeny bit dry and that was even with basting with broth (the gravy was very good though) the taste however was amazing! Next time I will for sure use the proper ingredients in which case it will definitely be a 5 star recipe :)

I was worried about it being moist enough, but it just fell right off the bone. The skin is crunchy and the chicken moist. Awesome! Served it over white rice and a tomato/cucumber salad.

truly the most tender chicken ever!  Our chickens were too big, so were a bit under done where the thighs touched, but the breasts were out of this world!

Wow!!  With 9 kids, an inexpensive meal is hard to do but this recipe made it easy and delicious!  Hubby said, "This was better than any Turkey dinner"!  I used two 6 lb. chickens and adjusted the recipe to accommodate the weight.  My chickens cooked alittle faster than stated and I did remove them from the oven at 170 degrees and let them sit and finish cooking to 180.  The meat was juicy and tender.  All around it was a very successful dinner!

This was really good.  I put the rub on the night before and I think that made a difference.  The chicken was so moist and tender it fell right of the bone.  I will definitely make this again.

I liked the flavor of this chicken and I will definitely make it again, HOWEVER, about an hour into cooking I checked the chicken and the skin was quite dry, so I decided to add some olive oil to it.  I didn't have 2 whole chickens so I cooked 1 whole chicken and some wings.  The wings turned out wonderful after brushing them with the olive oil, but the whole chicken not so much.  The skin that was face up looked absolutely delicious, but was tough as leather.  I guess I thought of the olive oil too late. :-(  The bottom of the chicken was moist and luckily I cooked it breast side down.  So all and all, the only change I would make to this recipe is to brush the chicken with olive oil and/or cover it while cooking, uncovering in the end to brown it.

Chicken was super-moist and very flavorful!  Only had them in the oven for about 4 1/2 hours with a meat thermometer until it reached 180 degrees in the thigh. Kids loved it. Will definitely make again.

Fabulous! A definite keeper. While one of the keys to this recipe is the slow roasting, the last time I made this, I ran into a time conflict. Due to necessity, I took a tip from America's Test Kitchen and roasted this at 500 degrees for 15 minutes on 1 side (1 wing side up), then turned the chicken over to the other wing side up for 15 more minutes, then put it breast side up for the additional cooking time. I then turned the oven down to 350 for about 30 minutes. The higher up-front temp browned my bird giving it nice color and a boost on cooking time. I then turned down the temp to the 250 called for in the recipe for an additional 2 hours. It was wonderful. Not as fall-apart fabulous as when cooked for 5 hours according to the directions here but an excellent option if you run short on time.

It was very flavorful, but not the kind of flavor that I am crazy about. I tried it with chicken wings, as one reviewer did, but I think if I made this recipe again I'll try the whole chicken and see how it turns out.

I didn't have time to prepare the night before.  I halved the cayenne but the rest of the ingredients were exact.  I used one 6 pound chicken.  My husband said it is the best chicken he has had in his entire life.  Has anyone tried this seasoning on a turkey?  I think next time I will prepare it the night before and also put the spices under the skin as well.

This was my first time preparing and roasting a chicken, I couldn't have asked for a better end result... it was delicious. The only thing I will add for next time is an injection of garlic and some other spices. It fell right off the bone, was moist and flavorful. My husband gave me 2 thumbs up. I will definitely be keeping this one.

Fabulous!  I followed the recipe for the spiced rub as written, but used split chicken breasts and roasted them for 2 hours.  I also poured a can of chicken broth in the bottom of my roaster and basted the chicken after about an hour in the oven.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is SO great! Didn't use the white pepper and it was only one smaller chicken (2.5 Kg) so it only took about 3 hours and it was perfect...FALLING off the bone! Amazing! (Plus it was my first time ever cooking a whole chicken!)

Amazing recipe, left in spice rub over night and it turned out perfectly. Cooked for 5 hours and was great, really moist and flavour throughout. I tried basting it a few times throughout the 5 hours. I don't like eating the skin so I used the pan drippings to make a gravy too and it was nice to add on top to get all the flavour from the spices and put on some mashed potatoes. I also cut a lemon and put half inside the chicken with some of the juice and some onion which I really liked

Tastes just like the real thing.  A little too much Cayenne pepper for my taste so I used half the amount called for and it had just the right amount of spice!

This chicken was tender and juicy but lacked flavor.  The skin came out nice and crispy but wouldn't stick to the meat and didn't give the meat any flavor.  This recipe is good for how to cook a chicken but the flavor was lacking.

This was ok. It was WAYYY too salty though! I did cut back on the salt a bit but it was still too salty. We still ate it & it wasn't bad but I probably wont be making this one again :(

Fantastic!  I bought a 5.5 lb. chicken since it is just me and my husband, and it took about 4 hours to cook.  Really great recipe - probably the best homemade roast chicken I have made.

Made this last night. I was wonderful. I was as good as from a restaurant or grocery store. Will continue to use this recipe. I did only make one chicken but I can see why you need 2 since there wasn't a drop left over.

Made this yesterday and it turned out great! I rubbed the spice mixture on the chicken and immediately threw it in the oven. Next time if I decide on supper the night before, I marinade it overnight in the fridge.

4.5 stars.  Very easy to make.  The only thing I did differently was to place garlic slits under the breast skin and in the cavity.  A 5 lb. chicken took 3-3.5 hours to roast.  I aded chicken stock to the pan juices along with a butter/flour roux with a little sage for gravy.  Plenty of leftovers too.

Nice chicken! I got compliments on it. I thought it was a little dry though, but that could be adjusted by the cooking time. I only used one chicken at the 250 degrees, and I don't know why, but it got done quickly (less than 2.5 hrs). I wasn't watching the chicken, so it probably got a little over done. I think I would start checking it after 2 hours or so. The drippings make great gravy, but were a little salty, so I would probably use a little less. Overall, great recipe, nice flavor, thanks!

Very good, although the spice mix seemed very salty.  Next time, I'll reduce the salt.  I use this recipe for all my chicken based recipes that require cooked chicken.

Wow! Fall-off-the-bone-deliciousness. I used the full amount of rub on 1 fryer chicken; was  pressed for time, so let chicken sit in fridge 4 hours, cooked at 250 for 2 hours, 350 for 2 hours and 450 for half an hour to an hour (lost track of time). This didn't leave any juice in the bottom of the pan because of the high heat, but it turned out so good. May try the same rub on a turkey.   Thank you thank you for the recipe!

I didn't follow the cooking instructions but used the spices on my chicken. This did not taste liek the Restaurant style rotisserie chicken though!  It was an okay flavor. Next time I might omit the thyme.

This was excellent. I've roasted many a chicken, and they've all turned out pretty well, but this has to be my favorite method so far. The gravy made from the drippings was great too. I plan on using the leftovers for chicken manicotti and enchiladas, and on using the carcasses for stock. Thanks for a great recipe that I can get several meals out of.

I made this chicken last night, and everyone  liked it. I added some changes though. I cooked 2 frozen chickens and cooked it for 6 hours. Even though I didn't put the spices inside the chicken, it still had very good taste. It was a little dry though, so maybe next time I will cook fresh chickens and it might not be so dry.. Thanks for the awesome recipe, we enjoyed it!

This was the best chicken I have ever had or made.  I did not follow all the directions completely, I used whatever spices I had at home (pepper, salt, crushed red pepper, garlic/onion mix, thyme).  I added garlic cloves and chopped onions to the inside.  I also prepared this in a pan, and covered with foil to refrigerate-skipped the bag!  My boyfriend ate the whole chicken last night...by himself!  Great Recipe!  Thanks!

The texture of the chicken is spot on.  But you really need to watch the roasting time as mine was done in nearly 2.5 hours.  The first time I made this recipe I made it exactly as written and it was overly salty for our tastes.  The next time I toned down the garlic and onion powder, upped the paprika and time, and it mellowed out the salitness beautifully.  Happy cooking!

This chicken is excellent.  It is now my family's favorite.  I often forget to put the spices on hours in advance and it still turns out great!  HOWEVER...it does not take 5 hours to finish roasting.  4 is more like it.

This was good. This recipe is great if only for the cooking method, I think you can adjust the seasoning based on preference/necessity. I used 2 tsp salt, 2 tsp paprika, 1 tsp thyme, 1 tsp rosemary, and 1 tsp garlip powder for 1 (4 lb)chicken. It was done 4 hours, juicy and with a crunchy skin with no basting, oil or butter. Drippings made great gravy.

I love the seasoning in this recipe.  I have a chicken roaster with a well in the center and I add a little orange juice to the well.  I then season the chicken cavity then put it over the well.  I rub butter over the chicken then season liberally with the seasoning.  I put red potatoes, carrots, onions and celery around the chicken and let it cook a few hours on 325 degrees

Oh my. This is simply the best chicken I have ever cooked! I have never rated a recipe on All Recipes until now. I just had to thank Sue for posting this. I am excited for my family to come home and eat this! This is when cooking is fun. How can something so unbelievably easy be so good? I seasoned the chickens last night. I followed the recipe as closely as I could, but didn't have all of the ingredients,  so I used Cajun Seasoning, and it turned out incredible. I didn't have any plastic wrap or bags either (what kind of cook am I?!), so I put them in the pan I was roasting them in, and covered tight with 2 layers of foil. For the life of me, I cannot fathom how the previous poster thought this chicken needed more flavor. The flavor and color were both out of this world. I would give this recipe 10 or more stars if I could! My little 5 year old grandson got first dibs on a chicken leg, and he gobbled the whole thing up...the chicken was so tender, all the meat just fell off the bone, so he ate it legless. I will use this recipe over and over again.

Delicious mix of spices.  I baked 2 4-pound chickens using the convection setting.  My little convection cooking book said to start at 450 degrees for 25 min, then decrease it to 300 degrees for the rest of the time (15 min for every pound).  The meat was good, but not falling off of the bone, which is fine by me.  Now I have 4 cups of diced cooked chicken for other recipes and some really good chicken broth.

Delicious! It was very juicy, flavorful, and just plain wonderful. I served it with roasted veggies (onions, yellow squash, zucchini, carrots, celery in olive oil and sage), and wild rice. It was a huge success.

This is a super easy, wonderful recipe for chicken. We had it on vacation - served it with Three Cheese Garlic Scalloped Potatoes (from this site), nice green salad, sliced tomatoes, and fresh french bread with butter.  YUMMO!!!  Great as leftovers too!

You can't cook this chicken wrong. So delicious, I haven't met one person who didn't love the flavor and juiciness of this recipe.  I also add butter under and over the skin w/the spices and it's DELICIOUS!! I don't roast chicken any other way.

We did not have time to refrigerate for five hours, but it was still very good. We left out the white pepper, only used about an 8th tsp of cayenne pepper (ran out), and used kosher salt instead of table salt. We used the amount of spices called for in the recipe for only one chicken. We added a can of chicken broth to the bottom of the roasting pan and baked in the oven on 325 for three hours. Wait ten minutes to carve? Yeah right! It didn't even make it to the table! Terrific!

The skin on my chicken was not sticky or crispy. That's the best part and I was disappointed. Maybe it should be a shallow pan? I used a roasting pan uncovered. It is pretty much the same rub I use for my chicken wings. Taste was good.

My family raved about this recipe when I made it last week. They liked it so much they asked for it again today!   Thanks so much. Best whole Chicken recipe I've found yet.  My wife was afraid 5 hours would make it too dried out, but it came out moist and delicious.

I made the chickens last night. I followed the recipe exactly so i could give it a fair rating. My chickens were 4.60lb and 4.30lb. I prepared the rub as is, but added more garlic powder as other reviewers did and i didn't put white pepper. The rub was really good but i could have used more of it. Next time i will make a bigger batch. I also put half a lemon in the cavity. TRY IT it's delicious that way. Why 4 stars then? After 4 hrs. of cooking, there were a lot of drippings so i was going to baste the chickens. I checked the internal temperature and it read 200 degrees!!! I was very disappointed. Why don't i rate it one star then? The breasts were a little dry but actually not unedible, the thighs were good! If you take it out at 170 degrees like you should (NOT 180) they would probably be quite moist and delicious! Check the temp. after a couple of hours of cooking please. Also, basting made a difference with the color and texture of the skin. The gravy was absolutely the best one i've ever had. Make two chickens at once, pull the meat off the leftovers and use for chicken salad, tortilla soup...you can put it in a ziploc and freeze it. Use the bones and onions to make chicken broth! Easy and money saving recipe!

This chicken is excellent!  I love the fact that the flavor goes all the way through the chicken.  And baking it at a low temperature for a long time makes it so juicy and tender.

I wish I could give more than five stars.  I doubled the recipe and used that amount on two chickens.  I placed each chicken in a ziplock bag for marinating overnight.  I will definitely use the same spice mixture for chicken pieces and specifically on wings alone.  Definitely a keeper!

Seemed that I cooked it a little too long since the bones literally just fell apart.  But it was good.  It made a really awesome Chicken Salad the next day.

It is not easy finding a recipe that the whole family enjoys, but I hit the jackpot with this one.  The chicken was moist & flavorful, a definite make again hit.  One thing though, it was done an hour earlier than the instructions said.

I made this in my convection oven. Reduced the temperature to 225 F. and it took the full 5 hours. The meat was tender, juicy and falling off the bone. Flavor was exellent.

Delicious! I use with whole chicken, split chicken breasts, chicken legs, whatever. I like to grill this on indirect heat, with some soaked mesquite chips. Chicken can't get any better than that!

Loved this recipe!  So easy and delicious... the chicken fell off the bones like good ribs!  I marinated the rub over-night and added some garlic with the onion.  I also put some potatoes in foil and threw them in as well (they needed the entire time since the oven was only at 250).  My only regret is that I didn't make two chickens!!

I did not make this, but I did eat it. A little dry, but for the most part very tasty. Left overs were good too. Would have gone well in chicken salad or on a sandwich with mayo!

When I went to make this, I opened my whole chicken and it had gone bad... so, in the trash it went, and I tried to substitute cut up parts (breasts, thighs and legs)  No problem, except I put it on time bake and went off to church, and I guess the smaller pieces just should not have cooked so long... it was a little dry..... but the FLAVOR... oh my, what a great rub!  I will try this again with a whole chicken, or at LEAST when I am home to watch it more closely! Try it, you won't be sorry!

I made this recipe as directed with the following exceptions: I used a 6 pound chicken and I had no onion powder or dried thyme. I let the chicken marinate overnight. Popped it in the oven, and let it do its thing. I think I overcooked the chicken a bit, but it wasn't too dry. My boyfriend loved it and raved about how great the chicken was to anyone who would listen. It was good, but I think next time I can do better. Will attempt again!

I didn't have any cayenne pepper or onion powder. Instead, I rubbed a tsp of hot sauce on the rinsed bird and then rubbed the seasoning mix atop that. Placed some onion slices on the top, and shoved into the oven.  Didn't marinate, and it turned out DELICIOUS. Next time I'll try marinating, but I just didn't have the time. So if you're hesitant to try this because of the addt'l time, don't worry about it!  Per another review, I made gravy using the fat drippings and a can of chicken broth (used flour instead of corn starch), and it was AMAZING.  Made a stunning dinner.

After all of the great reviews I was excited to make this.  I was really disappointed.  I made it exactly as written and found it did not have much flavor and was quite greasy.  I will not make it again.

Wow wow wow. If you want chicken that taste just like the local grocery stores  rotisserie this is definitely it. As bad as the skin is for you especially when dieting I couldn't resist so crispy and sticky good. We just bought awhile ago a toaster/rotisserie/oven and this was my first attempt using the rotisserie and believe me it will be used weekly.  This is a great season to mix and give as gifts. Thank you for such an amazing recipe this will be used regularly in my kitchen and shared with many. And also so very easy to mix. Hope so many others enjoy as my family did.

Deelish chicken!  I didn't have an onion, so I used dry minced onion inside the cavity.  I also would use 1/2 the salt and cut the cooking time by 1hr for a 5lb chicken. I cooked it for 5.5hrs and it was yummy and falling off the bone, but I would have liked to been able to cut it, instead of shred it!  I used the entire amount of seasonings on one 5lb chicken. I rubbed under the skin as well as on top.  And I only marinated it for about 1.5hrs.  My family loved it, minus it being a little on the salty side, which is why next time I'll use half the amount of salt.

Came out awesome. I only cooked it to 165º, which is the temperature that the FSIS recommends for chicken. I didn't use cayenne pepper, but didn't need it.

I love this recipe! I have been making it every week and my husband takes the leftovers in his lunch. The chicken is so moist and tastes like butter, but there is no butter or oil in it! I add sliced carrots and sliced sweet potatoes to the pan and let it cook for the whole 5 hours. The veggies taste rich and sweet from all the basting, really delicious!

I was looking for a marinade for my skinless chicken thighs and found this recipe. I used the rub on the thighs and chopped onion and tossed with the thighs and let sit in the fridge for 4 hours. Then I bbq'd the thighs. OMG delicious. My husband loved them. Will make again and again.

This was good.  I did make it in the crockpot instead of the oven (hard to do when you work all day).  It was good, but I do have another spice mixture that I prefer.

Used 2 (5 lbs) chickens, in separate baking dishes.  Done in 4 hours at 260F.  And we couldn't get over how moist it was.  Yum!

I tried this last week.  Didn't have the cayenne on hand, so substituted a tablespoon of mild yellow curry powder.  Wow, was it good!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  This is one I will be putting in my favorite recipe binder!  I saved some of the drippings from the pan and used the separated chicken fat to make a cream sauce for a broccoli chicken (a different chicken) recipe last night and that was great too.

This is the best roasted chicken I've ever had! It's even better than the cooked rotisserie chicken you can buy at the grocery store. I find the longer you marinate the chicken, the better it tastes.

the chicken was soo moist and tender.I carried it a step further and used my rotisserie oven to roast the chicken.Going to try the rub on a turkey breast. Not sure about the timing though. I'll roast it at same temp, but have to use a therm to check the timing.

Just like the stores make! The prep time should be adjusted though to reflect the 4-6hrs in fridge.  Almost didn't see that so had to cook the next day.

This chicken was fabulous!!!  I did melt some butter and put on the chicken before I put on the spices.  I added a lemon and some fresh rosemary to the cavity.  I could marinate for about 3 hours and I cooked it for 5 hours.  It was a 5 lb chicken.  I increased the temp to 300 for the last 30 minutes.  It was so pretty we didn't want to eat it.  It was also very tender and juicy.  I will definately roast my chickens like this from now on.  I also added about 1 cup of chicken boullon to the pan and the last 2 hours I added some baby carrots.....
Update....I feel like 5 hours is too long.  I made this today and only cooked for 4 hours.  It was so much better and so tender.  My husband only complaint was the skin was not crisp enough so next time I make this I will cook for 3 1/2 hours and put it under the broiler to crisp up the skin....since it is just my husband and I, I just cook 1 chicken

Good stuff!  I only cooked one chicken.  Marinated overnite.  Took about 4-1/2 hours in my oven.  My 7 year old, who is the "king of picky" had three helpings.  That is the ultimate compliment.  Will make this one again.

ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! I was skeptical because of the long cooking time, and I worried that the meat would come out dry. Boy, was I wrong. My husband declared this the best roasted chicken he has ever eaten and I agree. He also said to give this recipe "two thumbs up" in my review. This will be my go to roasted chicken recipe from now on. Thanks to the poster of this recipe and my friends from the recipe exchange for constantly recomending this recipe to the point that I just had to try it, LOL:)

this was good, but the gravy made from the pan drippings is amazing. i think it took more time then it was worth. since i can get fully cooked rotissrie chickens for under $5. but im glad i tried this.

There's been enough said about this delicious recipe, but I wanted to share my experience translating this to a turkey.  I made a 13 pounder using this recipe.  I made one and a half batch of the rub, and probably could have doubled it.  With the straight math of time per pound, it came out to be over 15 hours.  However, mine was done (internal temp. of 180) at 11 hours.  At ten hours it would probably been ready at 170 (which is when I would have pulled it out for carryover).  I covered it and let it coast at 170 until mealtime and it was still delicious, maybe a little less juicy than it would have been had I timed it better.  The only drawback - the pan juices dried out, so I had no dripping for gravy.  I still would recommend this for a turkey, but be prepared to play with it a little.  The rub is absolutely delicious!

My GOD this is good!  I may never make roasted poultry any other way ever again.  I actually made a 12 lb turkey with this, and adjusted the recipe to accomdate a bigger bird and longer cooking time.  But other than that I followed to a T and it is delicious.  Makes the best gravy, too.  If you haven't tried this, you must!

Made it for Christmas dinner and I can say hands-down this is the best recipe for a roast chicken. Who needs turkey when you can cook chicken!

After reading through most of the reviews, I gave this recipe a try.  This also was the CLOSEST I have ever stuck to recipe.  In fact, the only thing I did was cut the salt to 3 tablespoons and omit the white pepper because as one reviewer said "who has white pepper"? lol..Anyway, this was so easy to do and I had my two (4lb) chickens seasoned and wrapped in about 15 mins.  I refrigerated them for just under 5 hrs. and cooked them at temp stated for just over 4 hrs.  That's when they hit the 170 mark. The aroma in the house was incredible and the taste was excellent!  My son thought it was a tad too spicy so next time I'll reduce the cayenne a bit but everything else was great!  It seemed like a perfect spice blend. I will also do this on a 6-8lb roaster instead of the smaller chickens next time just for ease and personal preference. Enjoy!

Very good and very moist.  Followed the recipe exactly.  My oven is a convection oven and the chicken took only 3 hours to get to the right internal temp.  My family loved it!!!

very easy and delicious. Next time I will use same seasonings but cook in a slow-cooker. My meat always comes out better and more moist that way.

I really liked the outcome of cooking at 250 for 5 hours.  I used one chicken with the same amount of spices.  The white pepper gave it a wierd smell - not sure if this is because of the kind I was using???  I won't use white pepper again.  Otherwise, this is a really good recipe that I have used time and time again.  I make in batches and save.

I've been making Roast Stick Chicken for about ten years now.  I got the recipe originally from a low carb website I belong to.  Everyone in my family loves this from my husband to my grandchildren.  It's a standard in my house.

This chicken was excellent. I don't usually like white meat from a whole chicken or turkey, but of course tasted it to see how it turned out.  It was incredibly moist and flavorful.  I cooked the chickens (2 - 4 1/2 to 5 pounders) for 4 hours and then checked them.  The meat thermometer read 160, so I turned the oven off while I prepared my side dishes.  The timing was perfect - they didn't need to cook any longer at all.  Thanks for the great recipe!

FYI:  Do not defrost your chicken in hot water like another reviewer said, you MUST use cold water and change it every 30 minutes to keep it cold!   Great spice blend, although I substituted parsley flakes for thyme.  Next time I am going to rub butter under the skin of the chicken to make it jucier and I think I'll also butter the skin before adding the spices, maybe even baste it a couple times.

Tried this recipe this evening and it was absolutely wonderful.  The chicken had such wonderful flavor and was so moist. My very picky grandson absolutely devoured it and asked to have it more often.  You must try this great recipe.  nanaof3  Hedgesville WV

This is one of my favorite recipes.  The chicken falls right off the bone.  Be sure to baste regularly to make it extra juicy.  I make a gravy by adding flour to the juices and then use leftover gravy along with the chicken as a base for a fantastic chicken noodle soup.

OMG, what a chicken recipe! Flavor was incredible even though I didn't marinate the bird for more than an hour. Note to self "read the recipe in full before making it". Even though I was pressed for time to make this so quickly it was as promised ~ fall off the bone good, and better than a store bought bird! My husband and I NEVER eat the skin from chicken, but this recipe made it impossible to resist. I mean who eats leftover chicken and the skin cold the next day out of the fridge? It was so good we plan to make this small indulgence twice a month. I am making this for company next week because I feel the recipe can't fail me. The spices were just right in this rub, just the right kick without being overpowering. I plan to try this rub on ribs and tri-tip. In a word, this recipe is a "keeper". Thank you for this post:)

I followed the recipe with the exception that we didn't cook them the next day after marinating them, not on purpose, but because of our schedule.    They turned out fantastic!  The best chicken I've ever had.  I even ate the dark meat because the overall flavor was so good.  I am going to use the seasoning mix on my Thanksgiving turkey this year.  Thank you so much for this great recipe.

I loved this recipe. My husband and I are always buying the store rotisserie and this is better than those. I tried it once without marinating over night and this is definately the key to a great chicken. It had so much more flavor sitting over night. It is also a great flavor to use leftovers for enchiladas the next day.

Pretty darn tasty. We had it with "Spaghetti Squash I" and mixed veggies for dinner. I only made 1 chicken so I used mostly half of everything. I decreased the salt for personal preference and decreased the cayenne pepper for kidlets.

I've been using this recipe for close to 10 years. It's terrific, and the family is always enthusiastic when I tell them I'm making it.  I usually omit the thyme, and add in more onion and garlic powder to make up the difference. I've also made it with rosemary and garlic (for someone who can't eat onions) with garlic in the cavity.  It's a great recipe!

This was so easy and so good.  It reminded me of the roasted chicken I used to love when I lived in Spain.  I added 4 cloves of garlic and a quartered lemon to the onion.

WOW! This was sooo good! Alot of recipes say you can taste the spices through out the meat. 95% of the time I don't, this one was right on. This isn't rotisserie style, it's better. Very juicy,tender and full of flavor. I even measured all my spices, I didn't have red pepper flakes, so I used cayenne pepper, nice kick. Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe is wonderful.  I grew up thinking "baked whole chicken" was inherently dry and tasteless.  How wrong I was!  This chicken is so tasty and moist!  I bake two at a time and use the meat for several lunches and dinners throughout the work week.

I'm so glad I put off buying that chicken rotisserie I've been dying for. This method is so easy and it tastes better than what you buy from the store. I did inject my chicken with broth every hour and throw in a couple cloves of garlic into each cavity along with the onion. Perfectly moist. For an even moister more flavorful bird cook it upside down, the fat from the dark meat will flow through the white meat before draining out resulting in super moist white meat.

Absolutely the best chicken ever! Well worth the time it took to make. My picky eaters in the family RAVED about this! I used the leftovers to make the EASY WHITE CHICKEN ENCHILADAS, which was also a hit. The only thing I changed was to double the seasonings in order to have enough to coat the entire birds - it was perfect!

Absolutely delicious and super easy!  I seasoned the chickens and put them on a spit for my convection oven in my spare time and left them to sit for 2 days.  Later I just put the spit in the oven and roasted for 5 hours.  Wonderful flavor and beautiful presentation!

This recipe turned out great. I cooked the chickens for four and a half hours and the meat was falling off the bone. Very moist and yummy. Would make again.

What a fantastic recipe! The chicken was sooo moist. You should always make two. Great for pot pies, soups and sandwiches! If you have a vacuum sealer you can seal and freeze the chicken.

I don't use salt so I left it out.I also used all the rub on one 6 lb. chicken. It was a very flavorful chicken and the leftovers made a great chicken salad.We don't care for the dark meat as much so next time I'll use the rub recipe for bone-in chicken breasts instead.

I used a 5 pound chicken and 3 cloves chopped garlic instead of the onion and garlic powders, letting sit overnight in the fridge. I also roasted for 4 hours the day before, then warmed it up for 45 mins day of, and it was incredibly juicy and tasty!

This chicken is awesome, it's definitely better than store bought rotisserie chicken, wayyy more flavor. It took a bit less time because my chicken was smaller. It was very good the next day as leftovers and leftover roast chicken usually has an old taste to me. I would highly recommend this recipe. I did baste mine just once during cooking. Thanks

Great chicken, although it's hard to mess up a rotisserie chicken, and I found that it was necessary to baste the bird throughout cooking.

This was really good. I only cooked one. So, obviously, cut spices in half. I liked the idea of putting in oven and not worring about it till dinner time. It was very moist and flavorful. Will definitely make again.

This was very tasty, moist and succulent. The flavors really got into the meat and not just the skin like most roasted chickens.  I will definitely make this again!

My husband and I thought that this recipe was very good; the only thing that I didn't understand was how the chicken was supposed to be "sticky". I adapted the recipe to my own needs, using 3 large bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts and half the amount of the original seasonings called for. I also replaced the white pepper with lemon pepper- does anyone ever have white pepper in their kitcen? I placed the chicken breasts on a bed of onions, celery, carrots and lemon wedges and then added about a cup of chicken broth to the roasting pan. I let the dish sit in the frige overnight and then baked it all at 250 for about 3 hours. The chicken was very moist and flavorful and I am looking forward to the leftovers, that's for sure! I would like to play with this recipe, adding some fresh herbs to the mix next time and maybe getting rid of the lemon wedges and lemon pepper. Anyway, it's a great recipe and I will make it again!

I was only able to let the chicken marinate for 4 hours and then I cooked it in my Showtime Rotisserie and it was great!  Even better was the leftover chicken!!

This was the best chicken I have ever made.  I had never used a whole chicken before, but this was so easy.  The meat fell off the bone.  Will definitely make over and over again.  Thanks!

This picture caught my eye along with the over 1000 reviews. I didn't have time to marinate the chicken, I didn't use the whole onions, I just used the onion powder and I forgot to use garlic and it was still delicious. Next time I will be sure and marinate it. Thanks.

Cooked it as instructed! I used a 4 pound chicken. I only marinated it for 3 hours. The chicken was ready in less than 3 1/2 hours. The flavors were good, and the meat was tender. But it didn't have that roasted taste that i had expected. I would recommend what the previous reviewers did, and rub the spices under the skin too. Not too salty at at!

Come to mamma. First time roasting a chicken low and slow, but man! won't be my last. Best whole roast chicken I ever made. The seasoning mix is excellent. Omitted the white pepper since I didn't have any otherwise kept to the recipe. Next time I will crank the cayenne a tad. I had one 6 pounder, but didn't adjust the seasoning amounts and rubbed the bird the night before and left overnight in the fridge. I stuffed with a lemon and garlic in addition to the onion. Roasted until thigh got to 170, I think that was somewhere between 4 and 5 hours. Be sure to make gravy from these drippings! Num! Not sure why recipe is called "Sticky" though.

TO DIE FOR!!  I didn't change a thing.  My family of 6 big eaters ate it all.  I was worried that 250 for 5 hours it would dry out but it didn't it was moist and perfect.

I finally tried this recipe, it came out so good. I did add small bits of butter under the skin over the breasts and let it all sit in the fridge for about 24 hours, came out wonderful. We don't eat the skin on the chicken and this still had tons of flavor. I tried making the pan gravy like other people talked about, the flavor was good but it was way too greasy for us to even consider using.

This recipe was so simple that I couldn't believe it could taste rotissierre style.  I omitted the white and cayenne pepper (didn't have at the time) and didn't have a cooking bag.  I covered the dish in aluminum foil and baked as directed.  The chicken was phenomenal!  Will make again and again!

This is a great mix of spices, the chicken was falling of the bone every time I have made it.  The chicken under the skin is very nicely flavored! Five stars the best!

This was SO easy and quite yummy! I only used one chicken and halved the spices as I'm only cooking for two. It cooked in 3.5-4 hours. I will make this again and again.

This was very good! The spice rub is good but I did not have enough time to let the birds soak in it overnight. Just 6 hours and we dont eat the skin anyway. This was delish! It was my first time making a whole chicken and it took about 3-3 1/2 hours. It wasnt sticky though...maybe my chickens kept all their juices inside! I will definately make this again :) :) :) Great recipe!!!

Excellent! I tweaked the spices a bit, and used butter as another review suggested, and the chicken turned out so delicious and tender! It fell right off the bone! Very moist and flavorful! I now have a new roast chicken recipe!

Awesome recipe!  I had only one chicken so I halved the recipe/spices. It still took almost 5 hours. I was scared it would be dry but was juicy and fell off the bones. I followed the advice of others and basted it every so often.  Extremely easy to prepare and the whole family loved it. For $3 it made for a great Sunday dinner.

Mmmmm....perfect spice mixture.  I only let my chicken sit in the spices for about 45 minutes...I also added a little olive oil to the ziplock bag...  I cooked it in my convection oven for 40 minutes at 375 and it was ridiculously moist and tender.  Well done!

was very much like store bought rotisserie!  I used 6 thighs with skin and bone. cooked at 350 for 1 1/2 hours.  The spice was WAY TOO MUCH - I omitted onion and white pepper but used 1 tsp of cayenne and black pepper and garlic powder - too much.  Next time I'll follow the recipe for the spices I have and just omit ones I don't have!!

This is the best recipe. I love it. My sister and I have always lamented why couldn't we make Rotisserie Style Chicken that tasted as good as the restaurants?  Well now I can say we can with this recipe. I too left out the white pepper. Didn't have it in my pantry and haven't missed it the numerous times I have made this recipe.  I have only made it using one chicken as there are only two of us. So I halved the amounts for the spice mixture.  I will be making this for years to come. I have passed it on to everyone I know.  Thanks Sue!

OMG, this was SOOO good!  I followed the ingredient list and put the chicken in the fridge all day, then used my rotisserie to cook it.  I can only assume that it's really good in the oven, too, since it rates so high with others, but if you're lucky enough to have a rotisserie, this is THE BEST!!  The skin was crispy and the flavor actually went through to the meat.

WOW!!!  Be sure to make two of them so you'll have leftovers (double the recipe of the rub as well to have for other types of meat.  Easy, tasty meal.  Add broccoli to drippings and roast until tender for a great side.

I just made this tonight and it is WONDERFUL!  I too added a little extra garlic powder (we love garlic), halved the paprika and cayenne, didn't add white pepper and put some minced garlic in the cavity with the onion.  I rubbed the spices under the skin for some extra flavor, since we don't eat the skin.  My husband and my very picky 3 year old daughter love it!  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks!

Yum! This was the first whole bird I've ever cooked in my whole life, and it turned out really yummy. My boyfriend declared that it was way better than store-bought rotisserie (which we are usually addicted to). I just made one big bird but cooking it for 5 hours on 250 made it just perfect, albeit a tad bit dry. I will DEFINITELY be making this again, and next time I'll probably play with the spices a little to see what kind of flavors I can get. Letting it sit seasoned overnight made all the difference in flavor.

I have not roasted a chicken so slowly before, and honestly, I am not sure it is necessary.  Typically I roast at 350 for just 2.5 hours or so....this recipe did turn out well, but I think you can save some time and maybe energy by roasting it for a shorter time at a higher temp.  Also, I recommend using a pre-made spice rub liek Mrs. Slyvia's chicken rub or Adobo chicken flavor with pepper.  Just some suggestions!  The recipe WAS good.  Be careful because the birds put off a lot of juice if you use a corning baking dish.

This is really good baked chicken.  I recently said that whole chicken will not be cooked in my oven anymore.  I only cook it in the smoker, but this recipe was great.  The chicken was so soft that moving it caused it to fall off the bone, and the cooking time is spot on for 2 or 3 chickens.  However, I didnt understand the "sticky" part in the chicken. Mine came out crispy on the outside but soft and juicy on the inside.

I followed the recipe exactly and liked the idea of long cooking over low heat but I wasn't really impressed wih the flavor. It was good but I felt like it could be better.

First bird ever cooked and it was super yummy!  Made a chicken potpie with the leftovers and the gravy.

That was the best chicken I have ever made.  I only used one chicken so I halved the ingredients and cooked the chicken for about 3 1/2 hours.  The meat was falling off the bone and very good.  I also added one can of chicken broth to the bottom of the roasting pan.  After the chicken cooked I drained the drippings and cooked broth into a saucepan, quickly whisked in 1/2 c. of flour and let thicken.  It was an amazing gravy!  I will definitely be making this again in the future!!

This recipe is so good.  I only baked one chicken and not two though but just halved the recipe and baked the chicken for around 3 hours.  We will not have roast chicken any other way now!

Delicious.  The chicken fell off the bone and was tender and juicy.  I think any mix of your favorite seasoning would work.

This was very good, I had a pretty big bird so I put it in for 4 hours. I think next time I will try and pull it out at about 3 1/2 hours. While it was cooking I was worried that it looked a little dry but actually the chicken was rather moist.

Hello Everyone,  I made this exactly as printed.  It was very tasty, however, it was not sticky or even crispy.  The bottom of my roaster had a lot of water in it even though I had dilligently dried the chicken inside and out before putting the rub in and outside.  The only thing I can think of that would have caused this is that the chicken was not FRESH and that it has been previously FROZEN by the supermarket and had not been labled as such.  I will make it again as we enjoyed it.  Today, I will make sandwiches from the leftovers.  I want the next time to be sticky and crunchy.  If anyone else had this problem, I would appreciate a response.  Many thanks,  Beverly Jane

Good recipe! It is a keeper. I think I overcooked mine a little. It went about 5 and 1/2 hours just because I did not make it home in time to pull it out.  I only made one roaster. Next time will try two and will pull out earlier.  I am using the left over chicken for chicken salad sandwiches tomorrow.

My teenager had to make a complete meal for homework and I gave him this recipe. It was AWESOME! It's a great recipe to encourage new cooks (it's so easy you can't go wrong) and we will never order rotisserie chicken from anywhere again! Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe
:)

My husband and I made this for guests lastnight.  We used the mixture on 2 chickens (5lb. each).  We coated the chicken and then let it marinate in the refrigerator for two hours.  We used the rotisserie oven and cooked it for 1 hr and 35 minutes.  it was so juicy.  We didn't get the "fall of the bone" effect but our guests really enjoyed it.
Great recipe!!!!

Wow! I was really wondering how good this recipe would be... nearly perfection. I actually did this for Christmas dinner, and since there were only five of us, I made two smaller chickens. I rubbed both, placed in saran wrap, cooked one the next day and waited until the next day to cook the second. They were both delicious, even though the second chicken I did not have time to "slow cook", I cooked for about 1 1/2 hours on 350. Both cooking times turned out fantastic, although the slow cooking method was slightly more moist... I am not sure if this has more to do with the slower cooking or the fact the second chicken sat in the fridge for an extra day. Highly recommend this recipe. Perfect for a weekend day

Delicious!  Did not have time to marinate as long as recipe calls for (only 3 hours) but was still great.  Followed recipe exactly except for the white pepper.

Thanks

We used this on our turkey breast for Christmas dinner.  It turned out GREAT!!!  I would recommend using this only on chicken or turkey with skin, I made chicken breasts with this seasoning mix and they were very salty and the seasoning was overpowering.  But when made with the skin on, the breast meat was to die for!!!

We love this chicken and the spice mix.  I keep it mixed up and use it for boneless skinless breast too.  Even when I do not have time for overnight a couple hours works too.  I always separate the skin and dust under it so the seasoning is on the meat too. It is great in the oven, crock pot, and on the grill.  If you want an extra moist breast meat place it in the pan breast side down.  I aways make extra to shred off and keep around for soups and sandwhiches.  Thank you for this awsome recipe.

This was very tender and had an OK flavor. I suppose it was the slow roasting that made it that way however, I wasn't too impressed with the seasonings.  I'll probably try something different next time.

Not sure where "sticky" comes from as mine was not really sticky.  However, it was pretty good.  Added a cup of chicken broth to my pan 2 hours before serving so there was something to make gravy with.  The gravy was awesome.  My husband really enjoyed the chicken.  It was all very moist and flavorful.  Will most likely make again.

OH-MY-GOODNESS!!!  This was absolutely delicious!  I have never made a whole chicken before and, I must say, I outdid myself!  Thanks for the detailed reviews everyone.  From my readings, I only used 1 5lb. chicken, cut the salt in half, and I didn't add any onions or other spices into the cavity aside from the rub.  I also omitted the garlic powder because I didn't have any on hand.  I made up for it by using garlic salt instead of plain salt.  I also sprinkled in some Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning and ground ginger.  I let my bird marinate for about 2 1/2 hours in a Ziploc bag.  I baked it in a roasting pan for about  3 1/2 hours on 250, with the last half hour at 350.  I only basted in once while it baked, squirting small amounts of squeezable margarine on top and off to the side.  When I took the chicken out of the oven, I basted it with the juices at the bottom of the roasting pan.  It was brown and crispy on the outside and, as promised, absolutely tender and juicy inside!  It was almost too easy to carve; I couldn't even hold the meat between my fork and knife to get it out in one piece!  I served it with cheddar and bacon scalloped potatoes, green beans, and salad.  It was soooo yummy...

I suppose I'm rating the method rather than the whole recipe itself- I didn't make the seasoning mixture to rub on the chicken. Instead, I used 1 tsp of lemon pepper seasoning and 1 tsp of spanish adobo. It came out wonderful! We haven't dug into the legs yet, but the breast was moist and flavorful. It seems that cooking at such a low heat seals the skin on the outside of the bird to keep all the juices in. Yum!

Delicious!  I didn't have time to marinate so I went ahead and put it in the slow cooker for about 5 hours along with a cup of chicken broth and cubed potatoes on the bottom.  Moist, juicy, tender and full of flavor.  Definitely a keeper.

This was incredibly tender, moist and delicious! Made it exactly as written. Best of all, the large thigh and wing joints were completely cooked without having to cremate the bird. Will spring for a more $$$ free-range chicken next time.

EXCELLENT!!!! I've made this chicken twice now and we love it. My boyfriend just about ate the whole chicken by himself. I kept the spices just as the recipe called for. I only make one chicken and add all the spice on that one chicken. I coat the chicken with olive oil before putting the spices on. I also took a few pats of butter and coated them in the spices, and put that under parts of the skin. This recipe is a keeper for sure. Also I only cook my chicken for 4hrs instead of 5hrs.

This made such a moist chicken!  Had 1 6lb. chicken, used same amount of spices (no white pepper) and stuffed with a quartered onion & fresh rosemary.  This took 4 1/2 hours to slow roast at the 250 temp.  Plenty leftover which I plan to use for soup.

This is an amazing recipe!  I took ideas from other reviews and so glad I did.  I made up a bunch of the spices to have on hand as I have made this recipe several times.  I serve the hot chicken the first night I make it with mashed potatoes and a veggie.  As another person reviewed, I then make enchilladas and have also made chicken pot pie as well.  It makes a lot and it is worth the effort to save the money. (I also boil the bones to make a chicken stock and put them in the freezer.)

I quartered the salt but otherwise kept all the other seasonings the same. I rubbed it into a 4 lb chicken, and wrapped it tightly overnight. I also stuffed the cavity with 1 quartered onion and 3 cloves garlic.
I slow roasted as the recipe indicated, except I poured 1/2 cup chicken broth over the bird and brushed the skin w/  melted butter before cooking. When the chicken was done, I poured the drippings into a saucepan, whisked in 1 T flour, and cooked up some delicious gravy. The meat was tender, moist, and falling off the bone!

This is the best Roasted Chicken Recipe.  My husband says that we will be making this once a month.  I didnt have 5 hours to cook it so i did it in a shorter time frame and it was still awesome.  Thanks for a keeper!

This chicken is awesome!  We usually use bone-in chicken breasts and thighs instead of a whole chicken and grill on low heat for 40-50 min.  I have also forgotten to add the rub until a couple hours before cooking and it is still good, but much better done 1+ day in advance!

Just what I'm looking for! I'm not cooking a big turkey for T'giving and I'm going to make this on my indoor rotissirie. I'm cutting the salt back to 1 tsp to reduce sodium intake and I'm using 1 chicken. Looking forward to this!

I tried this on a family gathering and it worked out very well - it helped that I actually cooked them on a bbq rotisserie.  I doubled the spices all except the salt - that would have been tooo much!

Made this lastnight for dinner and wasn't overly impressed by it. I thought it could have used a lot more seasoning and it definately needs to be basted. I finally basted it with about an hour left even though the recipe says it's not required. The skin was very dry looking.

First time I've ever done a chicken, I've done a turkey only once before. Chicken was very moist, but really not a whole lot of flavor. Think I'll try the butter, spices under the skin thing next time. I did add a few garlic cloves in the cavity as well. Thrilled it wasn't dry, hoping for more flavor next time.

I NEVER write reviews, but, I had to for this one.  I LOVE this recipe.  I use to always use an Emeril's Garlic Shmeared whole roasted chicken recipe and I will never use it again because THIS ONE is THAT good.  I decided to make it and my boyfriend came home from work and immediately asked what was cooking, the expression on his face when he saw it was priceless, he was excited.  I don't follow the exact measurements, I just guess it.  I always add about a teaspoon to a teaspoon and a half extra cayenne--because I like the skin a little spicier.

This rub is great on roast chicken or even turkey (great for any poultry)!  My husband and I got the idea of using a beer can roaster on the grill from his sister and brother in-law.  It is very yummy!  We just put it on the grill and let it cook at a low to medium temp for 2-3 hours.  Turns out very juicy and flavorful!  Will make/use again!

I have been making this recipe for several years now.  It is wonderful!  The meat just falls off the bone.  I use this recipe as a guideline for every roast chicken I make.  I often switch out the seasoning but I always use the cooking method in this recipe.  Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with the seasoning in this recipe, I just do it for variety.  My family thinks I make the best roast chicken they have ever tasted!!!

YUMMY YUM YUM!!  I don't cook roast chicken very often because I haven't found a really good recipe yet, but now I have!  The only change I made to the recipe is that I doubled the seasoning.  I added half of the seasoning to buttermilk, mixed it up good and marinated the chicken overnight in it.  (I had some on hand left over from a cake recipe and thought how good fried chicken is when marinated in buttermilk and decided to give it a try for this recipe)  In the morning early, I took it out of the buttermilk, rinsed it off and continued with the recipe as written.   I cooked Broccoli in Roast Chicken Drippings (from allrecipes.com by Kristin) in my pan drippings and it was perfect.  This is a keeper!

I made this last night and it was the best! I followed the directions as written, seasoned overnight, but put on an oven stuffer roaster.  I cooked it about a half hour after the pop up popped (total time about 4 1/2 hours).  This is so worth the wait! I couldn't stop picking at it and the onions were incredible and the chicken tastes even better today!  I will definitely make this often.

I have made this several times now. Definitley a keeper. I've made it with and without the onion. I personally didn't think the onion added much. Excellent dish though!

I made this over the weekend and it was wonderful.  I made the rub, put it on the chicken and then into the oven.  I did not let it sit for the hours it required.  Great flavor and very moist.  I will be using this recipe over and over again.  Thanks.

This was OK. I expected more after reading the reviews. I don't think the chicken was infused with flavor as much as I expected. Also, and this is the biggest reason that I'm giving it three stars, it took WAAAY shorter than five hours too cook. I bet it could be done in three; I don't know for sure because I bumped it down to 200 when it became apparent that it was cooking faster than I expected. This could be a big problem for people who have a scheduled dinner time, like we do. It really messes plans up, to have such a big discrepancy in the time. I wish the recipe would be modified to reflect that.

This is the best! The chicken was so moist and juicy. I also like the fact that the chicken was not swimming in juice...in fact there was hardly any juice at all! My family just loved it! I think next time when I make it...and there will be a next time...I will cut back on the salt just a little. Thank you for posting!

This is a twice-a-month staple in our home.  It is delicious and juicy.  We use the leftover meat/carcass to make other meals like chicken and rice soup or chicken pot pie.  I usually just use one large roaster instead of two small ones.

This  was my first roast chicken and it turned out very well. It didn't take the flavor of the rub as well as I would have liked but I didn't do the overnight with the spices. I will do that next time. Thanks.

I thought this had alot of flavor and was good. My husband didnt like it really.  He said it tasted like vinegar yet there are no vinegar in it so I dont know why that was.  He hates vinegar if he can taste it :)  I am thinking the combination of spices and juices caused him to think that?  I probably wont make it again since he didnt care for it but I honestly thought it was ok :)

This was very good.  I didn't let it sit overnight, or at all actually, (thats what happens when you don't read the directions thoroughly before starting.  It was still really good though.  My daughter was a huge fan.  Great recipe!!

This was an excellent dish, but it didn't taste like the Rotisserie Chicken that you can purchase in the store.  It tasted just like roast chicken.  Very good, but not what I was looking for.

Fabulous chicken.  Moist and flavorful.  I followed the recipe pretty close except for a few things.  One, I brined the chicken the night before (which cut down the cook time by one hour).  Two, I added a few cloves of garlic along with the onion.  Lastly, I did the seasonings as directed for two, but only used ONE chicken. We stuffed ourselves with it, but still managed to have leftovers.  I am going to make stock with that, and maybe use the extra meat for chicken fajitas, or chicken and dumpling stew or something.

Even picky eaters loved this chicken. Will use this recipe again! I had some seasoning rub left over and sprinkled that over the cut chicken the next day. Liked the taste of the seasoning rub so much I now make it up and use it on other meats & veggies.

Disappointing. I will buy a store bought rotisserie chicken next time. I rubbed the seasoning under and on top of the skin; I allowed the seasonings to penetrate the bird overnight while wrapped in plastic wrap.  I stuffed the cavity with onions (no garlic but will next time).  The next day, I put the chicken on top of an oven rack inside a roaster but did not baste it; the chicken was still tender and moist  without basting.  I am disappointed with the lack of flavor; I did not change the ingredients and even included the white pepper although others omitted it but I still think this recipe was missing the KICK that I expected.  The cooking method deserves the five stars.  That's why I compromised with four stars--3 for seasonings and 5 for the cooking method. I will use the cooking method again just not the seasoning mix.

This recipe is very good.  I opted to use just one chicken and place it in the crock pot instead of the oven.  I still used the same amount of seasonings, but just on one chicken.  I added about a 1/4 cup of chicken stock in the bottom of the crock pot.  The results are wonderful.  Everyone just loves this including the kids.  I have made this several times and every time there are no leftovers.

Made one chicken and it cooked in about 3.5 hours.  I've never made a whole chicken before because it just seemed too much work - but this was really a breeze to make.  Mine ended up marinating for a couple of days.  Very juicy, moist, and tasty!!

This is the best recipe I've ever found online.  I've been making this chicken at least once a month for about two years and it never fails.  I generally use organic, free range chicken and only one, not two, as the recipe calls for and it blows grocery store pre-made chickens and Boston Market chicken out of the water--it's just that good.  Definitely don't rush it, leave it in the fridge at least 8-12 hours.  No changes or adjustments are needed but alterations because you're out of something will be fine--if you don't have white pepper, cut it out or use black/red.  I also always stuff onions or apples or whatever I have in the cavity for extra flavor.  I've used butter under the skin thinking it would be even better but it's not necessary, the recipe is perfection as is.  UPDATE: Last Thanksgiving I used this recipe on my turkey and it was just as good, adjust the cooking time for your size bird and you're good to go!

Yum Yum!  This was so easy and delicious!  Truly fall off the bone. I was only able to marinate for 90 minutes before cooking, and it was still delicious.  I did reduce the white pepper and used red pepper instead of cayenne.  The juices made the most phenomenal gravy ever!  Thank you for sharing what will now be a regular recipe for us!

This was amazing! The chicken was so tender and juicy and the flavor of the spices was great. I was afraid of using so much salt, but it was not salty at all. I added about 5 cloves of garlic and a lemon into the cavity with the onion. I also seasoned the skin and underneath the skin. Cooked for about 4.5 hours. Perfect!

I prepared one 4.5lb chicken, stuffed if full of onion and garlic.  I sealed it in a Foodsaver bag for 12 hours and it cooked to 170 degrees in 3.5 hours.  It was very easy, juicy, and made the house smell divine.  We ate it clean and the remains are simmering for homemade chicken stock.  
I'll make this again for sure!

This was really good. I only did a half breast (bone in, skin on) and omitted the peppers in the rub. Since it wasnt a whole chicken (or 2) I only had to cook it for a couple hours. Turned out very moist and delicious. Only bummer was that I forgot to take a pic, so I will post one soon when I make it again! Definitely a keeper!

This is a great recipe! I have used it time-and-time again.  I didn't have white pepper, so my 12 yr old son who made the rub used 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes instead.  A whole teaspoon of black pepper and a whole teaspoon of garlic powder.  I also added a scant teaspoon of white sugar to the mix.  We like it sweet and spicy.

Only had 1 chicken so cut the recipe in half.  Followed the directions exactly.  Marinated the chicken overnight and cooked for 4 hr and 45 min.  The meat was falling off the bones and very soft.  Is a keeper!

WOW!! This chicken was amazing. I cooked only one chicken for 4 hrs and it came out perfect! This was as good or even better than store bought rotisserie chicken. Thank you for a great recipe, I will be making it very often now.

YUM! I'm making chicken this way from now on! Like most other reviewers, I did not use the white pepper (Seriously, who has that?!). I did add an additional amount of black pepper to compensate. I also stuffed the cavity with onion and minced garlic. The weekend got away from me and I ended up "marinating" this in the fridge for two days. Amazing!! *Update* Threw this on the BBQ grill last night. It was great and took half the time to cook!!

This recipe was good.  I cooked this in my slow cooker on low all day.  Once I was home I added some potatoes, carrots and celery and cooked on high for about an hour and then back to low for another hour.  Altogether it was in for about 10 hours, which was a bit too long but it was still deliscious either way.

delicious but a tad salty.  I would cut the salt in half and double the rest of the spices next time I make it.  I had never marinated a bird like that before. It's absolutely brilliant.  I am going to  attempt to rub and onion-stuff my next holiday turkey.

YUM! This chicken turned out delicious. I halved the recipe and cooked one chicken in an oven bag for 2 hours on 170C. Next time I will halve the cayenne pepper as it was a bit spicy for my children. Also substitued onion salt as did not have any onion powder and did not add any other salt. Definitely a keeper.

I love this recipe - I had never seasoned a chicken before and now I'll never NOT season my chicken this way before roasting.  I don't usually remember to prepare the rub 24 hours in advance, and the flavour is still very good for the spices being rubbed on a few minutes before putting in the oven.  We found the onion flavour a little strong, so I don't put the onion and garlic into the bird either.

I made this according to the recipe one Sunday and it was FABULOUS!  The moistest, most tasy and best roasted chicken I have eaten!  Even considered having 2 of them for Christmas dinner.  Yep, it's that good!

My family really liked this chicken, and it is so easy to do. I only had to cook the chicken for 4 hours and it was done. I only cooked one chicken so that is probably why it was done more quickly.

Excellent! I prepared this the night before. I rubbed the chicken with olive oil and then spread the seasoning mix over the entire chicken... placed in a gallon size ziploc bag and refrigerated overnight. I didn't have the entire 5 hours to "slow roast" the chicken so I cooked it in 2 hours instead (at 325 degrees). The chicken was very very juicy and tender with great flavor.  I served it with the drippings spooned over the cut chicken.

Very good, and different from how I usually roast my chicken. I let the chicken sit in the fridge with the rub on it overnight (probably about 30 hours). Delicious.

I've used this recipe quite a few times and LOVE it. I've skipped the "marinate" time in the past due to lack of time and it still turns out great. I only do one chicken, and the whole family loves the leftovers for sandwiches the next day.

Very good I did not have time to marinate it over night but I did have about 4 hours. I was great. I'm sure that it would be even better if I had overnight!

i love this recipe!!!  but i have to admit the 1st two times i made it, the breast meat was incredibly dry which i think i can blame on my oven temp being inaccurate.  with that in mind, i placed foil just over the breasts and follow directions exactly as listed.  the chicken is so tender and juicy.  a few reviews said that the recipe was bland and unexciting however that is the reason i love this so much.  the spices flavor the chicken without overwhelming it.  it still lets the natural taste of chicken shine through :)

I left out the cayenne and it was still incredible!  My husband said it was the best chicken he had ever had.  I followed another user and made chicken legs in the crock pot (with balls of alumninum foil in the bottom) for my kids.  One kid had 3 for dinner and 2 for breakfast!  Amazing!!

This was so easy, moist and full of flavor. I cut the recipe in half, using  one 4 1/2 lb. chicken. I rubbed the spices under and on top of the skin, marinated for 5 hours in the fridge and slow-roasted at 250 for 4 1/2 hours, basting the chicken with the pan juices throughout. I also added a few garlic cloves and chopped shallot to the onion in the cavity. It is so easy to make and wonderful! The bones make a great broth as well. Will add this to regular rotation. YUM!

So here is the deal. This does take some fore thought in order to make this. Got it prepared last night got into the oven this afternoon. I only made 1 chicken so maybe that was why the timing was off. It cooked in about 4 hours. It was good and it did not heat up my kitchen. I'm just not sure it is that much better than my usual recipe. Thanks for sharing.

This was one of the tastiest, moist roast chicken I have probably ever made. I made a mistake in making up the rub and used chili powder instead of cayenne pepper, but it still turned out wonderful. Will definitely make this again! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I seasoned for 24 hours and baked for 4 hours @ 250 and it was dry and disappointing for all the work/wait.    I'm not sure I will make it again as there are tasty chickens in less time.   I gave it 3 stars because it was still edible.

This was so good. I can't believe how good this turned out. My husband was SO pleased and my kids LOVED it. This is a keeper.

I didn't change a thing except slicing stick butter, dipping it in the spices and putting it under the skin, I also rubbed the seasoning under the skin.

Thanks!

for some reason I was a little disappointed in this recipe. I followed the directions to the tee and although I did get a very moist chicken, it was lacking a lot of flavor. I was really expecting more. However the family loved it. I will continue to roast for the same amount of time. I will just have to season differently.

I made this exactly as recipe stated - (except I only made 1 large chicken) I  let it marinate for 24 hours - Let it slow cook in a large roaster for 4 hours - then basted it with butter to get it to brown and cooked another hour. It was so tender the meat fell of the bone and the chicken was SOOO MOIST - It was DELICIOUS!

Wow!  Excellent recipe!  I used one 7 pound chicken instead of 2 small ones, and baked it in a cooking bag.  It was done quickly and perfectly.  Served it with garlic mashed potatoes.  What a great dinner!

This made very tender, tasty chicken.  I used only bone-in breast, it took three hours at 250 degrees.  I cut back on the black pepper by half, as I am not very fond of a strong black pepper flavor.  I can't wait to use the leftovers for soup or casseroles, yum!

OMG! Loved it! Great seasoning combination! I didnt even marinade over night, or at all.  And it was still so flavorful.  I stuffed the cavity with lemon and red onion.  Rubbed the seasonings well into the chicken.  Cooked for 2 hours on 325.  Basted with butter every 30 mins. SOOOOO good and juicy. We ate it up so quick, thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe!

I've got to be honest, I wasn't wowed by this.  It was good but not great.  The meat was juicy and the seasonings good, but I guess with nearly 800 awesome reviews I just expected something more.

This chicken was full of flavor, moist and juicy!  I made one 5 lb. chicken and it was done in less that 5 hours.  I used the leftover chicken and made chicken enchiladas and Cha Cha's White Chicken Chili from this site.  Excellent!

This was so easy to prepare and very tasty.  I made one 4 lb. chicken and it was done in 3 1/2 hours.  Like other reviewers have said, next time I will lift up the skin and put the spice mixture underneath, too.

Excellent recipe!  I didn't have time to let it sit overnight with the spices, but it still came out fantastic.  I stuffed the cavity with a whole red onion, quartered and 2 tbls of minced garlic.  Moist, juicy and very flavorful!

Wow-great chicken.  I halved the recipe for one 4 lb whole chicken.  Followed the recipe exactly as shown.  Took about 3 hrs 45 mins for it to be ready-made a great gravy with the drippings-Thanks!

Out of this WORLD good!  It took everything in me to NOT cover the chicken...and what a surprisingly juicy perfectly roasted chicken!  I used 1 chicken almost 7 1/2 lb (organic, free range - yummm!) and it took 4 hours on convection roast to cook.  Thank-you for sharing - that was awesome, a definite keeper!

Chicken was juicy and tasty, but didnt live up to its wonderful reviews. Cooked one marinated chicken about 4 hours.  When I want rotisserie chicken I will get one from the store. Probably wont make this again.

Really delicious! I made a 7.5 lb chicken cooked it for around 3 hr 45 min. I did what other reviewers did and put a few pats of butter under the skin. I recommend basting this chicken as it cooks. The spice rub is just SOO delicious!! Chicken is moist and SO delicious. This is now a staple in my home.

Great! Couldn't believe the cooking time and low temp, but we cooked it last week and will do it again tomorrow. Chicken is so moist, so much flavor. You guys got to try this, and kiss the cook!

This chicken was delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly except that I cut it in half and made one 4 lb. chicken and I skipped the white pepper since I do not keep that on hand.  I did take the chicken out after 4-1/2 hours, tented it with foil and let it rest while I increased the oven temp. to make some biscuits to go with it.  This will definitely be my roast chicken recipe in the future. UPDATE 3/1/15 - no matter how many times I make this chicken recipe, I'm always amazed by how delicious it is!

This is the first time that I have ever rated a recipe.  Although I have tried many very good recipes from this site, this one was outstanding.  It is certainly the best I have ever made.  I did substitute more black pepper in place of the white pepper and it still came out great.  Rave reviews!

Fantastic! I've made this several times and always get great results. I shared the recipe with my mom and she loves it too! I don't love microwaved leftover chicken so I usually make chicken salad with the leftovers.

I made this today and it was fantastic!  I followed the recipe for the most part, omitting the white pepper and thyme because I didn't have any in the house.  I did use just one chicken, so I halved the rub recipe, and the cooking time was only about 3 hours, due to the size of the chicken.  My family is quite picky, but it was a hit!

Loved this chicken!  Cooking time a little off for me. I took chicken out of oven at  4 1/2 hours and it was a little dry but tasted great.  Next time I will cut back to 4 hours cooking time.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This simple recipe produces incredibly tasty and moist chicken! I'm new to roasting a whole bird but the clear instructions made it easy. With a single chicken, I found that 3 1/2 hours of roasting was sufficient for the perfect bird. Thanks for making me a hero at the table!

I tried this recipe after a failed attempt to cook a whole chicken a few months ago...it was great!  My husband ( who is a HUGE chicken fan) said it was the best chicken he'd ever had.  I have to agree...even the white meat was super moist and tender.  I cooked it in an electric roaster instead of in the oven, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I think one of the keys is cooking at a low temp for a long time.  I'm planning to strip off all the remaining meat and make another chicken dish later in the week!  What a great meal!  (And I got the chicken on sale for 69c/lb!)

We had one 4 lb chicken. Cooked it at 275 for around 4 hours. It was very good. Very flavorful. Very moist. We will definitely make this again! We were thinking though, maybe getting some of the seasoning under the skin.

Loved it!!! I seasoned the chickens in the morning and threw it in the oven at 2:30 pm, baked it at 350 degrees for an 1 1/2 hours with the breast side down, and it came out moist and tender. I did add chicken broth to the bottom of the pan and made some gravy with the drippings, oh my goodness, it was great! I had to make dinner for some neighbors and they loved it. Plus my boys ate like crazy. Thank you for this recipe. **Also, the local store was having a sale on whole chickens, so I seasoned the chickens and froze them, without the onion. When I get ready to cook them I will thaw them and then add in the onion. Thanks again for this wonderful recipe.

Didn't have the patience to slow roast but I did use the seaoning mixture and double wrapped and put in the fridge for a few hours. I also put a tablespoon of chopped garlic inside with cavity with tghe onion, put a few tablespoons butter under the skin, topped the bird with a few strips of bacon and put two cups of stock in the pan to help start a gravy. Best chicken I've ever made. Next time I'll think a bit more ahead and do the slow roast.

My husband LOVED this recipe! He said this was the best chicken I've ever made. The reason it got 4 stars was because it didn't have as much flavor as I was expecting, but I didn't marinate it, so that could've been it. I plan on doing that next time and see if it's any better that way. I also put garlic in with the onion, which was very good. All in all, a great recipe!

UPDATE -I  I can't believe the bad reviews this gets...if you have a dry or salty chicken you obviously haven't adjusted the time/recipe  properly for one chicken. I have marinated  the chicken overnight for this and done it off the cuff, and it's NEVER failed. I first reviewed this in 2009- I'm still using this recipe now, in 2016 on a at least monthly basis. In fact, I always have this seasoning on hand in a jar. I don't even measure it now, it's all just muscle memory,lol...**ORIGINAL REVIEW**  This was so yummy!! I came across this recipe a while ago, and decided the other day at kind of the last minute to do a roasted chicken, and I remembered that I had wanted to try this recipe...anyway, long story short, I skipped the marinating step and the chicken was still delicious, although next time I will marinate it as the recipe calls for. I only cooked one chicken, so 5 hours was  longer than needed to cook it, so I just set my oven to warm... I roasted some garlic and made a shallot and roasted garlic gravy from the pan drippings, and served it with hoppin' john and kicken' collard greens from this website. I will definately be making this again!!

Followed this direction to the tee except rubbing the inside of the chicken. I sprinkled inside with the seasonings. THIS WAS AWESOME!! I WILL DEFINATELY MAKE THIS AGAIN. My family loved it.

I used two whole chickens cut up.  Instead of mixing all of the ingredients, I put each ingredient on the chicken individually.  That eliminated the chicken from being so salty. I did use season salt instead of just regular salt. I used meat tenderizer, accent, and mccormicks salt free all purpose seasoning as well. I marinated for 1day and a half due to circumstances. I put the temperature at 300 degrees gas stove equivalent to 275 electric stove. I added an onion.  I baked for one hour on one side, turned over and baked for one hour on the other side.  It seemed like too much pepper once I tasted it out of the oven. The next day all the flavors took and it was delicious.  Not Rotisserie. But great flavor.  Very tender.

I didn't marinate due to time, but the flavor was good and chicken was moist. Not a WOW, but good. I also increased temp as suggested and decreased time. The kids actually ate some of the skin, which they usually don't do.

This chicken is Fabulous!  I have made this a few times for my family and have taken it to others when making them meals and I am always asked for the recipe!  This tastes even better than store-bought rotisserie chicken and it is really easy!  
I do baste the chickens with pan juices towards the end of the cooking time to keep the chicken moist.  
This is a family favorite - even my picky 9-year old loves it!

This chicken was great!  I added 2 pats of margarine under the skin to of each breast, between each wing, and inside the cavity along with the onion.  I didn't have time to let it marinate over night, but it came out amazing! This is a keeper!

First of all, I was fortunate enough to get my hands on a free-range, organic chicken raised by neighbours, and this slow-roasting method cooked it to perfection. All four stars are for that! The rub was ... alright. Tasty enough, but the end result was nowhere near "sticky," like you'd get with a marinade/glaze. I followed other reviewers' advice and stuffed the chicken with quartered onions and minced garlic, nicely flavouring the pan juices from which I made gravy. I also set the chicken to roast on a bed of potatoes and carrots, but here's a lesson I learned from this experience: vegetables should be in small chunks, or sliced thin, because they just don't cook through at that low heat when they're large and chunky, which was my mistake. I'd follow this recipe again for the low-and-long cooking style, but I'd try a different preparation method.

This was my first time making a whole chicken and it turned out fabulous! I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect. Very juicy and flavorful. I made gravy from the drippings and the leftover chicken made an excellent white chili the next day.

This was my first time making a roast chicken and this one turned out great. I put veggies around the chicken for the last hour of roasting and they were yummy as well. The roasting time for me was about 4 hours so a little less then what the recipe calls for. Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely use again.

The flavor of this was awesome, but I will reduce cooking time in the future. I used 5lbs of chicken parts, and it was not as juicy as I'd like. BUT...it was not dry! I will try again.

The chicken was definitely moist and it was good but certainly not sticky-don't know where that came from. It just didn't wow me.

I am nibbling on a chicken leg as I type this now. This is the most amazing recipe for roast chicken that I have ever made! I didn't change a single thing, except that I adapted the recipe to one huge seven-pound roaster and baked it for exactly four hours. Wow. It's AMAZING.

This was sooooooooo good!!!  I didn't have time to marinate the bird, but I did follow the recipe for the rub.  It came out wonderful on our rotisserie/convection oven. I would def. like to try the marinade next time.  TY!

I marinated the chickens overnight before poppin them into the oven. I was skeptical at first with having to cook the chickens for 5 hours and not have the chicken come out dry tasting. To my amazement,the chickens came out not only VERY moist but VERY flavorful. I highly recommend this recipe!!!

Great taste.  A bit too much salt I thought.  It doesn't need it with all the other seasonings.  Makes a cracking gravy with the addition of some chicken stock.  Not sure about the "sticky" bit though.  The only thing sticky were the roast potatoes.

This was super easy and really yummy.  After reading the reviews, I did not know what to think, especially about the cooking time.  I decided to do exactly as the recipe states for the first time around.  The only thing I changed was the onion powder.  I did not have any so I used dehydrated onions which I crunched up a bit.  What I would change when doing it again is cut down the salt by 1 tsp.  The chicken was not salty until you ate the little pieces in the bottom of the roaster at the end.  I just don't think chicken is a meat that really needs much salt.  My chickens were really juicy and had I had the cornstarch or flour (I am not at my own home), I would have made the gravy others suggested.  I think because it was so juicy, it did not really have the "sticky" that rotisserie usually has.  The thing I like most about this recipe is that it is so easy and seemingly fool-proof.  I fixed it and put it in the fridge at 10 pm.  I got up at 5am and put it in the oven.  It was done in perfect time for me to leave at 10:30 am for a pot-luck lunch.  I was worried about the flavors not going through the chicken skin, since the recipe does not say to remove the skin (which makes it all the more easy), but the flavors were wonderful!  They certainly permiated the skins!  I had quite a few compliments on this dish.  It is certainly worth a try!

I made both chickens since the recipe calls for it thinking I would have plenty left for other meals..Surprise, it was gone in no time. The only thing wrong with this is smelling it cook.My stomach was growling for the last two hours of waiting.. It's the best chicken recipe I have ever tried. Thanks for posting this

Phenominal recipe! This is the first whole chicken I've made, and it came out perfect. I used a smaller chicken and just used an internal thermometer to see when it reached 180 degrees in the thickest part of the thigh. The meat really did fall off the bone. I followed the recipe almost exactly, but needed more spice mixture to rub on. Also, i added minced garlic in the cavity with the onion. It sat wrapped in the fridge for a whole day, which i think added to the flaor. I took another's advice and seperated the skin and coated inside of it with butter seasoned with the mixture. My boyfriend is obsessed with this recipe. After he had it, 2 whole chickens showed up in the fridge the next week! Wonder why.. :) I used the leftover chicken for chicken and dumplings and it was spectacular.

I bought two 4.5 lb chickens - and doubled the spices.  I tried cooking them upside down - so that the breast meat was in the juices.  Worked out very well - although you don't get the crisp skin.  I cooked them for 5 hours at 250 and it was a little too long.  But they were still delicious!

the spice mixture seemed not to have made much of a difference in the taste of the chicken although it made a nice base for gravy. the skin cooked up too leathery to eat so most of the spice ended up in the garbage after cooking. the meat was very tender but not unlike what you get when you normally bake a chicken. a nice recipe but a lot of fuss for something pretty normal.

Good chicken receipe.  Like others it is really about the cooking method and great results.  I seriously don't think it would matter whether you marinate it over night or not. It was good but the rub did not shine through.  I rubbed the chicken inside the cavity and outside on the skin. It didn't have a seasoned taste.  I love the chicken but giving it 4 stars because I am gonna have to come up with a better rub. Thanks for sharing....

This was good, although the cook time is a little off. I cooked it for 4 1/2 hours and the white meat was a little dried out. I loved the seasoning mixture though, and this was a nice comforting meal with some chicken gravy, mashed potatoes and carrots. Thanks!

This is the BEST roasted chicken we have ever had..juicy, tender and perfectly seasoned. I used a full rub recipe on one chicken, marinated overnight was awesome! The drippings made super gravy...didn't even need seasoning!

It was good, but just like a normal baked chicken.  Nothing spectacular.

Can't go wrong with this recipe. Also, you can substitute just about any root vegetable and/or spices that you have on hand. So easy to make and turns out so moist every time!

I attempted to make a half recipe's worth (following another person's recommendation for cutting back on the salt, and leaving the other items as is), and the chicken came out really good, however the spice mix wasn't right - tasted over-seasoned.  I'll try it again, though!

Good chicken, but to me only worth three stars because I feel it was not exactly as described.  (I made the recipe exactly as written.) I didn’t find the flavor or texture to be “restaurant style”.  (Not that it matters, but it also was not "sticky".) I agree with another poster in that I do not think it is the spice mixture that makes the bird good, but the slow cooking that does.  I believe you can use your favorite chicken roasting flavoring and still have the chicken come out very juicy and tender by slow cooking it.  However, I found that the plastic poultry cooking bags worked even better than this slow cooking technique, and for much less time.  My chickens always falls off the bone, yet are crispy on the outside using that method.

WOW. This was fantastic. As one other reviewer said: this really is better than store bought cooked chickens. I let it marinate overnight and cooked it like directed and it was so moist, I was surprised for an oven cooked chicken.  This is going in my top ten recipes.

This was very good chicken. It's a great idea to make two so you can use the 2nd for dinner later in the week.

This is my favorite way to make a chicken. It's delicious although the skin has never come out "sticky." I usually use one chicken and just sprinkle with paprika, pepper and a little garlic salt or garlic powder (I don't follow the exact measurements and omit the salt). Before placing in the oven, I drizzle it with a little olive oil (sometimes I use butter). The cooking times are perfect and I have had no problems with dryness and have made this more than a dozen times (for those who have, just start checking the chicken after 4 hours). Lately, I make this without refrigerating overnight - just season and pop it in the oven and it still comes out GREAT! I do pour off any bottom juices and add this to some chicken broth for gravy. After everyone has picked it clean, I make homemade chicken soup or chicken salad (if there are enough leftovers). This is a very tasty and economical meal. Thanks!!

Perfect and soooooo easy.  I did not have white pepper or cayenne pepper, so I used chili powder.  Was so tasty and fell right off the bone.  All four adults I served this to raved about the great taste and tenderness.

This turned out great. I doubled the dry rub (but halved the salt) and only used one big free-range chook.  The chicken was juicy and tender and the skin had a real kick to it.  This has got to be one of the easiest and stress-free way of roasting chicken.

I made this once before and the chicken was YUM! The breast was a bit dry though but I think that was my own fault b/c I overcooked it. I'm making this recipe again on Tuesday with a few changes, and I'll be flipping the chicken onto it's breast to try to make sure the breast meat stays juicy... maybe start it on the breast and flip it *shrugs*
Anywho... it wasn't sticky for me the first time which is fine with me.. I prefer the crunchy skin anyway :)

This is a great recipe.  The spices made it through to the meat, so even without eating the skin, I could taste the flavor.  I used the same quantities of spices (except white pepper, which I didn't have) for just one 4-pound chicken, and it seemed like the right amount.  My husband liked the texture of the skin better than other roasted chicken I have made and requested that I make this again.  I may try using higher heat and a shorter cooking time to see how that turns out.

This is a great combination of seasonings for a chicken. I've made this recipe as instructed with a whole chicken (I did adjust the cooking time because I didn't have 5 hours. I cooked the chicken at 325 for about 1.75 hours (it was a small bird). The seasoning is also great on boneless skinless chicken breasts. My husband really enjoyed that preparation. Oh - I don't have white pepper on hand, so I just increase the amount of black pepper.

I hadn't planned ahead to let the chicken set for 4 hours so ended up putting the chicken into an oven bag to try and soak up all the seasoning.  I also cut slits into the skin and placed about 1 TBSP (total) of sliced butter into the slits.  I threw in some cubed potatoes per another reviewer and my family and friends loved it!  This is definitely a recipe I will make again.

This is the best roasted chicken I've ever made. I used double the seasoning  (minus thyme) on and under the skin overnight, drizzled on olive oil, and placed the chicken on quartered potatoes. About half-way through the cooking time, I turned the chicken over. I added another fifteen minutes at 350 degrees F to get the  bird's temperature to 180 degrees. Unless I get a larger slow cooker, this will be the only way I roast chicken.

My new favorite chicken recipe! This turns out wonderfully and is a real crowd pleaser. I didn't realize this recipe was for 2 chickens and used all the mixture on 1 chicken and it still turned out great (not overly spicy like I was afraid of).

I decided to try this on a whim thinking it would be perfect for a Saturday when I didn't really want to have to "watch" something cook all day.   Wow!   What a pleasant surprise!   The only thing I changed was I put two small jalapeno peppers in each chicken with the onion.   This is the best chicken I have ever made!  My very picky Dad could not stop talking about it.  Thanks so much for sharing it!

WOW!! Great recipe we really enjoyed this. I only marinated for 4 hours and it was delish. Next time I'll do it overnight. I also cooked mine on the bbq over beer cans (beer butt chicken)talk about moist. I will use this method from now on. Thank you

I put the chicken on the rotisserie instead of the oven.  It turned out wonderful, very juicy.

Excellent rub. I eliminated the cayenne pepper and reduced the salt and it was still perfect.

OH MY GOSH!!!  I made this tonight for supper and I could not believe how good it is!  After being in the oven for about 2 hours I began to baste it because the juicies were finally coming out.  Then I decided to take what juices were left and pour them into a cup.  I made a gravy with that and poured it over the chicken once it was served.  I can not believe how easy and how good this chicken is!!  Thank you so much for sharing:)

Was good.  I used ONE 4lb. bird and kept covered in the oven till the last 30-60 min. of cooking.  Unfortunately it came out a little dry (cooked faster than 5 hours), but was still good.  I also had some leftover garlic butter that I had in the fridge, I had used that to smother all over the skin.

THIS IS AWESOME!!  I was amazed that I didn't screw it up.  Its a dummy-friendly recipe, and it SOOO good.  My husband asked if I was going to bother to eat the mashed potatoes and carrots and dinner rolls I made to go with it.  Truthfully, I was too busy scarfing down the chicken to care!  AMAZING recipe - thanks!!

This tasted very good.  I used bone-in breast and legs.  It does require a lot of spices though - maybe easier to just by the chicken at the deli?

Excellent excellent chicken!  Will make this again and again.  So easy, so moist, so tasty.  Made to recipe except halved salt and didn't have any onion salt.  Also guests were late so cooked for almost 6 hours instead of 5 - didn't seem to matter.

The meat is very moist and tender, but had I not rubbed the spices under the skin I dont think the meat would have had any exceptional flavor.

My biggest problem with this recipe is the fact it does not come out "sticky" at all like a rotisserie chicken is supposed to.  I looked over the reviews and couldn't find anything except maybe add a little butter to the chicken.  I searched other recipes on the web and a lot of them called for honey and either lemon or lime juice to be basted on the chicken.  This seems to make sense.  I wonder if this spice mix would work with some sort of liquid base like I mentioned applied on top.  Anyone have experience with this?

Also, as much as I liked the spice mix, it calls for WAY too much salt.  In fact if I hadn't cooked it myself I would have thought someone was playing a joke on me.  Cut in half at least.

This was really good!  Had my family over for supper and they raved. I did make some slight adjustments though, I added 2T brown sugar to the rub, had no onion powder but love curry so I added 1t curry powder.  I also stuffed my chicken with a lime cut in quarters in addition to the onions. 
Will be making this again!

This really does have the flavor and juiciness of a store-bought rotisserie chicken.  Kind of messy to prepare so i usually make two chickens to make it worth the effort.  Great for leftovers.

This was easy enough but it was pretty bland. Mine cooked in 4 hours. I did not like the way the chicken sat in all that fat while it was cooking. And in the end the meat seemed dry. Luckily I plan on using it it a variety of dishes and not just eating it plain like roasted chicken.

This was SO good! I cooked it at 325 for, oh, about 3 hours or so. The meat was so tender and moist and the skin was so good and crunchy. Plus, the two chickens made enough for a few meals. I am making chicken noodle soup tomorrow with the rest of the meat. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made the spice mix exactly like the recipe but added a couple of cloves of garlic to the onions in the body cavity and let it all marinate in the refrigerator overnight.  Then I cooked it in the rotisserie oven at 400 degrees for about two hours (it was a 4 lb. bird).  It was tender, juicy and perfectly flavored. My boyfriend said it was better than the ones we get at at the store and those are his favorites! Unbelievably good! A definite keeper.

I cooked this for my boyfriend and his family and it was a huge hit.  It was falling off of the bone when I took it out of the oven and was very flavorful and juicy.  My boyfriend's mother complimented me on my cooking and told me it was better than the rotisserie chicken she usually gets when she eats out.  This recipe is a keeper.

Awesome! I applied the rub and threw it in the oven and it still came out delicious! The rub was the best I've found on the net. The Chicken was moist and tender. My very very picky BF loved it.

This is THE BEST CHICKEN EVER!   I am a terrible cook, I  admit it, and meats are the most difficult for me to do. I have problems with overcooking and things coming out to rubbery and chewy.
 
Unfortunately my daughter requested chicken for Christmas dinner, so I decided to give this recipe a try. The recipe was *very* easy, and the chicken turned out to be exceptional! Very 'sticky' and moist, as the title implies.  

I couldn't find some of the spices that were needed, so I used the McCormick's mesquite seasoning blend, but followed the rest of the recipe precisely.  The house smelled delicious and the slow cooking made this fail-proof - I highly recommend this dish to anybody who likes chicken.

Very good recipe. Gave it to a young friend, that doesn't do much cooking, and she became an instant chef! Her family loved it. This Chicken has never turned out any way but excellent. I always do two chickens. Usually give one away to friends, and keep one for ourselves. Is time consuming, in the fact that I have to plan ahead, but so worth the effort. I usually start thinking about this recipe three days ahead, if my chicken is frozen. I like to marinade it at least 24 hours. That is why it takes so long for me to prepare.

The only way to roast chicken! I would give this 10 stars! The chicken I used was almost 8 lbs and I put just a dash of the cayenne pepper otherwise it would have been way too spicy. Also, used ground thyme since I didn't have anything else in the house.  I didn't have time to have it sit in the fridge, so I just popped it in the oven right away. Baked it on 250 for about 3 hours and it was very moist and tasty. I also made a gravy from the drippings that was very flavorful.

I was looking for a light side dish for our Christmas dinner (ham), and this was the perfect recipe!  The combination of tart/sweet tastes was perfect.  I cooked the potates and assembled the dish early in the day, then put it in with the ham for the last 45 minutes. I will make this again!

The best chicken I've ever had! I bought a 6 lb Tyson roaster chicken with a pop-up timer and it was done in 4 hours. I used all the ingredients as listed and it turned out wonderful. Very moist and delicious, with a gravy I could eat by the spoonful! This is definitely going in the rotation!

The first time I made this with a frying chicken; nothing special. But my husband wanted to try it. So I bought a roasting chicken' put spices under the skin of the chicken. Left out salt we can't have. Didn't have white pepper. And added celery in cavity of chicken with the onion. Wonderful! We make again. Used left overs for salad and sandwiches. Wonderful! Thank you!

This is the best roasted chicken recipe I have found! The meat is moist and (yes) sticky. The skin is crispy and delicious! I used a 4 and a half pound chicken and cooked it for 4 and a half hours. Just perfect.

i made it, and it was good but my mistake was getting a skinless chicken which made it a tad bit too dry. will try again and see how it goes.

This chicken was delicious.  I didn't have white pepper, so I just substituted more garlic powder for it.  I also found that the chickens I had were too small for 2 onions, so I just used 1.  The chicken came out very tender and juicy.  It was cooked all the way through and was really excellent.

I've never made a chicken before, and it turned out excellent!!!!  My husband who is a picky eater loved it.  I only made one 5 pound chicken and baked it at 350 until internal temp reached 180.  Turned out great!!!  Thanks for a great recipe!

My family loves this recipe, and asks for it often.  The chicken is moist and has a great flavor.  I tried it on the grill, but don't have a rotisserie, so I did prop it on a beer can to keep it from charring.  Threw a little garlic and onion in the beer and it stayed moist and fabulous!

This chicken is fantastic.  I think its even better than the rotisserie chickens you buy in the stores.  The spice mixture also makes a great rub for grilled meats.

Wow! There were so many ways to roast whole chicken! I didn’t like the high heat recipes or their spice themes. I didn’t really want to slow roast either but I went all the way trying to make this as written. I never did get the “sticky” reference but even so, this chicken did come out wonderfully juicy and tender for me. I halved the spices and made only one bird. Sprinkling the spices on looks perfect but when you actually rub them around on the skin it looks like you are rubbing it all off. I just tried to distribute it as best I could. I only had 3 hours to marinate. Surprisingly this method does infuse the meat of the whole chicken with a nice mild flavor you can definitely taste but doesn’t overpower. I did broil 15 mins. at the end to crisp the skin. It still wasn’t very crispy but I don’t care much about eating the skin anyway. The broiling did give it the rotisserie appearance though. The juices make very tasty gravy, don’t throw them out! I’ll make this recipe again.

Best homemade chicken ever, according to my husband who was not really crazy about whole chickens. Followed the recipe to the t and turned out wonderfully. Sometimes I would add some ground star anise for a twist. Definitely a keeper.

I gave this 4 stars because the skin wasn't as moist as I would have liked but the meat was tender and juicy.  I reduced the salt to 3 tsp. just because it was a little too salty for us.  Very easy and a great Sunday dinner.

This was delicious.  I used just one chicken and I also put it in the crockpot all day!  The meat just fell off of the bone.  Thank you very much for sharing this recipe - it is a keeper!

I'm not sure what went wrong here- my mom said since I put foil on the bottom of the pan it messed everything up.  I put carrots and potatoes in the pan too and they never got really done even after 5 hrs in the oven.  I guess the chicken had a decent taste but it wasn't crispy and it was hard to take apart. I would've given it 2 stars but I figure it's something I did wrong.

This was my first attempt at chicken, and it came out perfectly.  It cooked faster than I had expected, so I covered it with foil and left it in the oven for a while, which made it nice and tender.  The flavor from the spices was very good.

This chicken recipe was great!  I baked three at one time, for each family member to take home.  I did add lemons along with the onion, but didn't change anything else.  Made some garlic roasted mashed potatoes, vegie and a salad and it was a hit!  Thanks!

This was the first time I tried cooking a whole chicken and it turned out wonderful.  My kids raved and my husband praised.  It's great for sunday dinner or to put in the oven before work for a treat when you get home.

Chicken was moist and fell off the bone, good flavor, my husband felt the skin was a little too salty. I will be making again and playing with the spices.

Great recipe.  My family and my co-worker love the chicken.  Actualy, I used Hens instead of a big chicken.  My husband doesn't enjoy big chicken.  I added with splash of lemond juice and rub some olive oil to merinate over night.  It is the best rotisserie ever.  Thanks.

Although, for the most part, this held up the description (other than, in my opinion, it being "restaurant style rotisserie") and was very tender and moist. The taste wasn't impressive, as I thought it was going to be based on some of the previous reviews. Don't get me wrong, it was good... Just didn't "wow" me.

I tried this on a 7 pound roaster, cooked it nice and slow and it was the best ever.  The gravy was even better.  All the seasonings from the chicken plus the juice of the bird, great.  Will make again, thank you.

this was pretty good. i added more of the spices to it and the flavor was nice.
not at all sticky though.
i baked it at a more regular temperature and shorter time because i didn't want to wait that long. it was still good and tender.

Great recipe. I did change it a little. I added some celery and carrots and also buttered the chicken before seasoning. I made a great gravy from the drippings. It was so tender. Great dinner. Will make again.

Oh, wow!  I have been under the impression that MY roast chicken was the best...then I tried this!  I went exactly by the recipe, except I marinated it over-night.  When I do this next time, I may add some chopped celery and some boullion granules to the chicken cavity along with a bit of water to make make more drippings for gravy.  EXCELLENT!!!!!

This was such a wonderful way to cook a whole chicken! The meat was so juicy and tender. I loved the rub also! I halved the recipe since it's only my boyfriend and I - the whole chicken was gone that night! Guess I should have cooked 2 chickens after all! I will definitely be keeping this recipe and look forward to trying different rubs too! (though keeping the original, because it is SO good!) Thanks for a wonderful and EASY recipe!!!

The chicken was very moist, but I wasn't impressed with the flavor.  Not like the restaurant Rotisserie chickens I've had.

Even with all the good reviews I had no idea how good this would really taste. I've used this recipe more than once. Juicy meat, tastes just like our favorite take-out from the grocery store.  And the smell while it is cooking is WOW.

Can't say as though it was sticky, but it sure was good.  I don't usually eat the skin of chicken because it isn't healthy, but the seasoning was so yummy, I couldn't resist.  Great with some roasted potatos, green beans and a balsamic reduction over the beans.  So classy.

This recipe is delicious.  My husband and I both loved it and I wasn't even able to marinate it for the full 5 hours.  The chicken was very moist and the flavor was excellent.

I've made this recipe many times...cooked it at the low temp and the regular roasting temp, in the oven and on a rotisserie, and it's always wonderful! I also rub some of the spices directly onto the meat, under the skin of the breast and legs.
My family loves it!

I made this recipe in a Ronco rotisserie oven and it turned out great even though I didn't get a chance to let it sit over night. The chicken was about 4 pounds and it took only an hour and a half.

Wonderful, just as everyone said!  Next time, I will baste the skin with vegetable oil before roasting, just as you do with a Thanksgiving turkey.  Keeps the skin from drying out, and gives it the gloss you see in the restaurants.  Thanks for the recipe!

I cooked the chicken according to the directions and it was dry.  I think I'll try it again with lower cooking time. Truly, I get better results and a moister bird "blasting it" -- 3 1/2 lb bird, 45 minutes, 450 degrees.

This is absolutely the best roasted chicken I have ever eaten!  I rubbed the chicken with the spices just prior to placing it in the oven (the recipe says to refrigerate overnight but I didn't have time), and it still turned out very flavorful and moist.  Everyone loved it!

Delicious chicken!!  Followed others advice and added more garlic and onion powders.  Used half the salt so that I could baste with chicken broth every half hour.  Cooked it breast side down and on a rack.  Was not dry at all in fact it was very tender and juicy.  The broth and chicken juices made a very good gravy.

Easy, good & inexpensive.  We only need one, but I cook 2, and use the extra chicken for "Whit's Chicken Enchiladas" or for chicken salad.  Husband & kids love it.

This is the first time I've every roasted a chicken. It couldn't have been easier. I left it in the oven until the meat thermometer reached 180 degrees, about 4 hours. The meat was very moist and the skin was light & crispy, not greasy like on some store-bought chicken. I will definitely make this again and again.

WOW!!!  This was an awsome chicken recipie!!!  I halved the recipie to make only one chicken.  I used 1 1/4 tsp of seasoned salt instead of 2tsp and I thought it was perfect that way.  I used 1/2 tsp of Garlic powder and 1/4 tsp Basil.  I also didn't use an onion in the cavity because I didn't have any on hand.  This was DELICIOUS.  I cooked it for 4 hours and made a gravy with the drippings.  The chicken was so tender and the gravy and chicken were flavorful, so this will DEFINATLY be made again in my house!!

Very very moist and tender!  I only cooked one chicken and I used my own spice mixture because I didn't want all the salt--so I used 1/2 tsp of basil and paprika, 1 tsp of onion powder and garlic powder and 1/4 tsp of black pepper. I felt that the overnight marinating really infused the chicken with the flavor of the spices--delicious!!!

Good recipe!  I used 6 bone-in breasts, baked to an internal temp of 175.  They weren't quite brown enough for us so I put them under the broiler for a few minutes.  They looked much prettier that way!  I also used half the salt and placed a quartered onion under each breast while baking.

This recipe was great! I only used one chicken, let it marinate overnight, and used a roasting pan that held the chicken upright. I didn't baste or anything, just let it cook for about 4 hours. It came out beautifully; the skin was crisp and flavorful, and every part of the chicken was juicy. I made chicken salad with the leftovers. Yum! Great recipe, thank you!

This was so good and easy.  It looked a bit dry on the outside when done, but it was actually very juicy.  I only did one bird which was 4 1/2 lbs.  It only took 4 hours.  I'm not sure when doing two birds if it actually takes 5 hours, however I'm not sure how I would fit them both in the oven.

A great way to roast a chicken that you can make a sauce with the drippings.  I used only 1 tsp of salt & will only bake approx 50 min per pound next time.  A keeper of a recipe.

This was really good. The meat was sooo tender and juicy. The spices were a nice change from the usual poultry seasoning. The whole family really loved it.

I cooked mine a little differently than the instructions given. I cooked mine on the rotisserie on our gas grill.  The only change I made to the seasoning mix was that I used chipolte powder rather than the cayenne pepper. Reason being was that I could not find the cayenne in my cupboard! The chicken was to my mind even better than the rotisserie chickens from the warehouse stores or the groceries.  A winning recipe.

We give this recipe five stars based on the chicken - it was really tender and juicy.  Additionally, the juices in the pan were very concentrated and flavorful.  Once we removed the fat, these made a delicious sauce for our potatoes.  The spice mixture didn't do much for us, but that might be because we didn't eat the skin so we couldn't taste it.  The method of cooking was great though and we'll definitely do it again.

this was just okay - it was a little too salty for my taste, but i like the idea so maybe i'll do it again only add my own spice combo instead.  the meat was super tender-- this is great to make if you're planning on using the chicken for another recipe.  definitely cheaper than chicken breasts!  & it's VERY easy!

WOW! This was absolutely perfect. I rubbed the spices under the skin as well, and about halfway through the baking time I sprayed it with olive oil to retain more moisture. The first words right out of my dinner guests mouth were "Is this a deli rotisserie chicken?"

delicious! my kids couldnt get enough! ;) has a great flavor and is rather simple to make. Wouldn't believe it wasn't cooked on a rotisserie if I hadn't baked it! I doubled the spices though since I followed the recipe then only had one chicken. yum!!! thanks for the recipe!

Thank you for this wonderful recipe! With a family of six I don't have to spend a fortune on the chain rotisserie chicken ever again.  My husband really enjoyed this dish.  Being from the South we are picky when it comes to chicken recipes, and this one met our expectations. Ya'll try this! It is excellent!

I used a large "oven-stuffer" type chicken.  We could not believe how moist and tasty it was!  It was ready in less than 5 hours.  I will pay attention to that next time.  But it was a wonderful, easy way to roast a chicken and still have it juicy with crisp skin.  A real keeper.

This chicken WAS good, but I'm not convinced that it was any better than other roast chickens I've tried. It made the house smell wonderful for so long that it might be worth it, if you are home on a rainy day.  The meat was really moist and fell right off the bone.  The bones and made a great stock.  I will most likely make this again.

This is a great recipe!  We received the Junior Showtime Grill Rotisserie Oven as a gift, and this recipe is perfect for it!  I halved the recipe for 1 whole chicken, put it in the rotisserie oven, and it's ready in about 1 hour.  I had a hard time keeping the onions inside the cavity (not great at tying the chicken, and they kept falling out while rotating).  But a savory  juicy chicken.  I've since just pre-mixed rotisserie spices to keep on hand, and roast chicken legsthighs in the rotisserie's grill basket, omitting the onions.  My husband and I love it.  Thanks for sharing!

DELICIOUS!!!  I made one chicken for dinner yesterday.  I like the ease of the recipe.  I put it in the oven as we left to attend a party.  When we returned home and took our showers, dinner was ready! The seasonings are perfect.  I wouldn't change a thing.

This recipe works. You could probably rub almost any combination of spices on chicken and cook it for 4 to 5 hours at 250 and it would be moist and yummy. But this one and these spices make a wonderful  flavor. If you are careful to monitor the chicken after about 3 1/2 hours, so it doesn't overcook, it will be flavorful, moist and delicious. I served my dinner guests with confidence and they enjoyed it very much. Leftovers were used for salad, pasta and sandwiches. This is a family basic.

Followed the recipe to the t, except I didn't have thyme, so I sub with basil and it was still great.  Cooked this in my rotisserie machine for 2 hours and it was perfect.

Oh my gosh, this was so good! I halved the recipe and only did one chicken. Beforehand, I separated the skin from the meat and oiled (olive oil) the meat so it'd be more moist. I also put the marinade/rub on the meat as well as the skin. It could have been spicier for my taste, but it had a great texture and flavor. Roasting it at a low temp. for 5 hours was a great way to cook it! I'll do that from now on when roasting a chicken.

This was awesome!  It was my first time roasting a whole chicken and it was wonderful.  Really tender and juicy and flavorful.  The only thing I did differently (well, I just added a step) was that I put some butter between the skin and the breast.

I tried this chicken recipe today for Sunday dinner......Oh my.....this recipe is excellent and easy and very, very tastey..with no fuss.... I put it in the refrigerator for 24 hours, and this morning I put it in the oven....I didn't have all the spices,(no white pepper or cayeene pepper) so I used Mrs. Dash, and a small amount of red pepper flakes...and it turned out wonderfully....This is, with out a doubt, a KEEPER, and one I will turn to often when fixing chicken...Thanks Susan...

I loved this spice mixture, but only had one 6 pound chicken.  I decided to give it a try anyway so I rubbed the chicken with the mixture, wrapped it in plastic wrap and put it in the fridge overnight. The next day, I cooked it according to the instructions that came with the chicken.  YUM!

This made a really good coating - this amount was great for 2 cornish hens.  However, the skin dried out no matter how much broth I put on, and never got that sticky gooey spicy texture that I love.  Also, the skin came out really salty - I would suggest using the same amount, but kosher salt instead.  Anyways, my dad was still like "what did you put on to make it taste so good!'  I would definitely make it again.

I'm giving 4 stars because the only part of the recipe I actually used was the spice mixture.  I was making the "Roasted Vegetable Chicken" recipe on this site, and I rubbed it down with this spice mixture.  It was one of the best meals I've ever made.  Thank you so much for posting this!

I must say, the cooking method makes the chicken come out FABULOUS!!! I placed mine on a wire rack in my roasting pan so that it wouldn't be too soggy on the botton. The skin was perfect (it's my favorite) not too crunchy, not too chewy, not soggy. The chicken could have been cut apart with a butterknife, it was sooo tender. I loved this recipe so much that I made it twice before the weekend was over (once with this spice mix, the next upon request with a barbecue spice powder mix) they were both so yummy (honestly though, I liked the bbq mix better)!! Thank You Sue!!!  

P.S. It was my first time roasting a whole chicken ;)

This chicken did have very good flavor and we did like it.  I would crank up the temp and lower the time.  At about 4 hours not much was going on with it I raised the temp and when it was brown I took it out.

Very good recipe, easy but takes time to get that rich mahogany color and flavor.  Don't shortcut the time if you want the rotisserie style flavor.

Not bad at all. I used 2 Cornish hens, and roasted them in the oven for about an hour. The flavor was good but 4 tsp salt is way too much. I'd halve it next time. Also, the garlic was lacking a little so I will put some garlic slivers under the skin. Thanks for the recipe, Sue!

I have had roast chicken at least once a week almost all my life.  This by far is the tastiest chicken I have ever had!!!  I will never roast chicken any other way EVER again.  The only thing I do different is add lemon.  I squeeze some over the chicken before seasoning and then I put half of the lemon in each cavity along with some sprigs of fresh rosemary.  Out of this world... the leftovers are just as juicy and tasty.

Used this measure of spices for one chicken, with a little less salt and a little liquid smoke. The chicken was very moist, but I didn't get as much flavor in the meat as I was hoping for. (I even rubbed some of the spice mix under the skin.) Totally easy recipe and turned out great with 5 hrs in the oven.

This is the best! I cooked one chicken, but used the spice rub for two and marinated it overnight. I cooked mine in a Nesco roaster and it came out beautifully brown and flavorful. On my husband's suggestion, next time I'll add a bit more red pepper flakes. I'll also make two chickens next time so there will be leftovers for chicken salad. Thanks, Sue, for this wonderful recipe! I'll be making this one often!

This was very good! I used 1 chicken and extra spices! It only needed 4 hours in the oven! I also added garlic in the cavity.  Next time I will try to cover the chicken and then uncover for browness and up the heat for 30 min or so. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good chicken! I only cooked 1 chicken, and I did take some other reviewers suggestions and added garlic cloves(3) in cavity of chicken, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. My whole family enjoyed this!!!

Very good recipe!  The chicken was definitely fall-off-the bone good.  I rubbed some olive oil on the bird before the spices and marinated it overnight.  I had lots of pan juices that made an excellent gravy!  The chicken I used was a bit small and some areas of meat got a little overdone so I would say roast it 5 hours - plus or minus - depending on the size bird you use.  I will definitely make this again.

The chicken is moist, but its weird to pull it out of the oven and have it lukewarm. There is nothing sticky about recipe. The chicken never gets that hot.

My family loved this chicken! I made two and it only took 4 hrs at 2:50. I also suffed the cavity with rosemary, onion and garlic. Went well with the honey roasted potato recipe from this site.

I cut the recipe in half only using one chicken.  I thought that the "crust" the seasoning made was very good.  I don't really think that it tasted like a rotisserie chicken, but it was still very good.  I think I will try this again using boneless, skinless, breasts.

pretty good, although not "sticky" and meat was not as tender as I thought it would be.

yet again another wonderful dish! very easy and Very yummy! The chicken just falls apart. I used the left over chicken in salads for lunch and that tasted wonderful too. Extremely moist and seasoned just right even cold and in my salad. I will add a bit of garlic salt to the rub and other then that wounldn't change a thing!

This is a great wake-up call for chicken. I have made this in my slow cooker and in my oven. It comes out great either way -- just like the store-bought ones. The best part, you can tweak the seasonings to suit your taste.

I used a 6# bird and roasted for 4 hours.  Was juicy, but not rotisserie style.  Seasoning is same as Emeril's Essence (plus oregano) if you have it.  Good method, just not what I expected.

Thanks Sue for sharing the secret!  I cooked 2 chickens as per the recipe and they were great.  Leftovers were awesome and not dry at all.. great in sandwiches.  The seasoning was just a little to spicy for one kid, but thumbs up from the rest of the family.  Great to make on the weekend.  Next time I'll do 4 chickens and have a few days of leftovers.

Wowie. This is some kind of tasty! I followed the recipe to the letter and wouldn't change a thing. I was a little shocked when I tried to "carve" it like you would a regular bird. The meat just fell off the bones and was so tender even the baby could eat it without a problem.  This recipe is going to the front of my recipe box and emailed to my friends. I'm anxious to try the leftovers in a sandwich tomorrow.

This was the first time that I made roasted chicken.  I was only able to marinate it for 4 hours but it turned out fantastic.  I basted them 4-5 times, mostly towards the end.  I will definately make this recipe again!!!!!!  Thank you Sue for the terrific recipe!!!

I loved this recipe Sue! SOoooo easy and good. It took me 4 1/2 hrs using temperature.  I didnt even get to marinate as long as suggested and will next although tasted great.  One hour before cooking was finished I  halved some red potatoes, diced some bacon and chopped some onion and placed in skillet with oil to brown about 10 minutes. I then used slotted spoon and placed them around bottom of pan of chicken to cook the final hour and they were a great side dish with the chicken!!!!!!!!!!!!   I am going to use the leftovers for and chicken club salad wrap. Mmmm!!

AWESOME!!!  My husband absolutely loved this...the chicken meat was so tender and falling off the bone.  I only cooked one 4 lb. chicken - 275 for 4 hours and it was perfect.  Loved the seasoning - cut back on the cayenne and put extra onion and garlic powder, didn't have white pepper and used lemon and pepper seasoning instead.  I also put a few garlic cloves in with the onion as others suggested.  Looking forward to making it again!!!

Great recipe Sue.  This was fantastic.  My whole family raved about it.  I made one roasting chicken but doubled the spices (by mistake) and I am so glad I did.  It was not bland at all and tasted wonderful.  I made sure to let it marinade all night.  Will make this again for sure.

This had a great flavor that went through the whole chicken.  I used 1 roasting chicken instead of 2 small chickens.  Made chicken salad with the leftover chicken and it disappeared.  I also used the bones to make a chicken stock for soup.

Oh my goodness!! This is the best roast chicken I've had.  I actually used only one 5 lb chicken, but used almost all the seasonings.  I also added some Accent to the mixture.  Marinated it all night and then put in in the oven in the morning before church and enjoyed a wonderful meal when I returned.  It was tender, very flavorful, and juicy.  Will definitely make again.  Update -- I made this for Christmas dinner and it was a huge hit.  My granddaughter said it was the best chicken she ever ate.  My DIL who usually eats like a bird went back for seconds.

My husband told me this is the best roast chicken he has ever had.  I baked it in my convection oven, which made the outside crispy and the inside so moist.  This recipe is a keeper.

Juiciest chicken my hubby and I have ever had!! Used one 5# bird, marinated for 6 hours, and only cooked it for 4 hours; it was done to a turn. I basted it a little in the last hour or so. The drippings also made a great cream gravy. Will make again, next time for company. Delicious!!!!

We had this for dinner last night...and it was fantastic!  I put the rub on the chicken the night before, and had my husband put it in the oven in the middle of the afternoon.  He usually doesn't go wild for roasted chicken, but said that this was really good.  It was not dry at all, and held it's shape.  It makes for a really satisfying meal.

Another for our Top Ten list of favorites!  It was absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't have white pepper and used 1 tsp of Lawry's Seasoned Pepper.  Chickens marinated 4 hrs and cooked exactly 5 hrs.  They did fall off the bones, even the breast bone.
Unfortunately, in spite of absolutely awesome flavor, my chickens were very dry!  Both chickens were over 4lbs, so this was totally unexpected...I need to get an oven thermometer, because I will certainly make this again! We're grateful, Sue...thanks!

I'm only rating the spice rub part of this recipe, because I cooked it in a rotisserie.  The spice rub is DELICIOUS!  The perfect blend of flavors... it definitely made the best rotisserie chicken I've ever had.  You might want to cut back a bit on the salt if you're very salt-sensitive.

I can only review the slow-cooking method of this recipe because I prepared my chicken as I usually do - squeezed a lemon over top, sprinkled it with salt, pepper and poultry seasoning then put it into the fridge overnight.  I rubbed the skin with olive oil and put half a lemon, half an onion and some garlic cloves in the cavity before roasting.  Cooking at 250 degrees for 5 hours made the chicken wonderfully moist and flavorful yet it still maintained it's shape (I don't really like when it falls off the bone).  I did baste the chicken during the last half of the cooking process. I'll do this again when I'm home for an entire afternoon.

The chicken did fall off the bone. In fact, when I sliced into the leg to see if it was done, the leg started to fall off the chicken! The meat was fairly juicy. I think the flavor could've been better. I only cooked one chicken, for about 4 hours instead of the full 5 hours, and halved the amount of spices. Refrigerated overnight. I put a quarter of a lemon into the chicken cavity before cooking. Didn't use the onion inside. Will probably make again, and might make some adjustments next time.

For all the ingredients and preparation, I thought it wasn't as good as I hoped.  However, the chicken was VERY tender, just not that flavorful.  With less ingredients and no marinating, I liked the Simply Lemon Baked Chicken just as much.

This is delicious!  I have made this about 4 times now and it always comes out great.  I usually cut back on the cayenne pepper a bit because I use the cooked chicken in other recipes and the cayenne flavor doesn't alwyas "work" with other recipes.  Definitely a keeper, though.

I halfed the recipe and baked one 4 pound chicken.  I left out the white pepper and added a little bit of chinese 5-spice powder.  Marinaded the chicken for 4 hours and baked it at 250F until meat thermometer said 185F (almost 4 hours).  Fall off the bone, and even the breast was moist!  My hubby and his brother said it's one of the best chicken they've had!

I didn't refrigerate the chicken to marinate with the seasonings which probably is why my chicken was a little dry.  I will try again the correct way.

This was absolutely awesome, and it truly was like ROTISSERIE chicken...I used cornished hens instead of a whole chicken, and that turned out just great!

i didn't actually eat this, but the people who did gave it a rating of four.  it smelled good, though.  the only different thing i did was increase the baking temperature. (some people in my house are really paranoid about juicy meat- they think it's raw)

AWESOME!!!  This is the best whole chicken recipe I have ever made!!  It is the most tender and delicious chicken.  I didnt have enough time to let it sit in the spices as long as the reicipe called for, but It was still perfect.

I just tried this on a 5lb Butterball Turkey Breast for Thanksgiving. Decided to stay home this year and cook small. Worked great, I put in a meat thermomoter set to go off at 180 and cooked it at 250 and it only took about 3hrs and 40 minutes. Let it rest for 20 minutes and it was really good and juicy!
