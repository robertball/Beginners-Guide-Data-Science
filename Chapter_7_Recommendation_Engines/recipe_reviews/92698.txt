This was nothing like the melt-in-your-mouth cookie that I thought it would be.  It was basically still the same sugar cookie you always get from the mix with almond and they puffed up to look more like giant hearts.

These cookies make a really nice dough to work with!!!  My husband, who is not a sweet-eater, ate about a dozen of these after they came out of the oven!  Definitely adding these to my Christmas Cookie baking list.

I thought these were fabulous. They did not hold their shape well, but they tasted fantastic.  Everyone raved about them.
