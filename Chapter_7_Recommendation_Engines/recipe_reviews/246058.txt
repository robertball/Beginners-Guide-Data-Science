I'm sorry to say that I didn't care for this sauce. I never got to make it thick enough and believe me I tried. The orange flavor doesn't make it spectacular for me. I think the amount of butter is too much.

I really loved this! I made it for Asparagus and can't wait to make it again for salmon and Eggs Benedict. Once you start on the double boiler it needs full attention until done.

I love hollandaise sauce. I don’t often have lemons on hand, so it’s nice seeing that it can be made with orange juice and still taste great!
