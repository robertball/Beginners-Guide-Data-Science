This was a great recipe.  Alfredo-based sauces aren't my favorite, but my husband wanted one so I made this one and I was not disappointed.  I made the crust with whole wheat and it turned out fine.  I seriously recommend this recipe to everyone!  And don't skim on the cream, butter, cheese, or bacon.

This was really good. I've never made a pizza like this so figured I'd give it a try. I used a different recipe for the crust but still homemade , I put all the ingredients in my bread machine and set it on dough cycle , the chicken came out delish, rolled out half the dough, there is enough sauce for 2 large pizzas, added some mushrooms  and chopped garlic along with the rest of ingredients and cooked at 425 for 22 minutes came out perfect. This recipe does take time and I drank close to a six pack while making it, I will make it again and recommend it to try

The Alfredo sauce is great.  My rating is for the sauce only since I already had my favorite pizza crust in the fridge, and I was planning to use morels and baby broccoli to make a pizza.  I decided to make a white pizza and had seen a review of this earlier and figured I'd give the sauce a try.  The consistency was perfect. I had only parmesan cheese, and I halved the recipe, too.  I had more than enough sauce even with half the recipe, so I'll be able to make another one soon!  I will definitely try the blackened chicken, too.

The alfredo sauce in this recipe is absolutely amazing!  I used Publix's pizza dough in a bag to save time.  We made one pizza as the recipe calls for and had a lot of extra sauce so next time I will probably cut it back a little.  For my toppings I used fresh basil, chives, spinich, and chicken. Yummm!!

I want to add an update: When you make this pizza, and if you have leftovers, it tastes even better after letting it sit in the fridge overnight!! YUM.

LOVED IT!!!!  The blackened chicken was delish, and it was perfect with the alfredo sauce.  I make homemade pizzas once a week, and this will definitely be added to my regular rotation!  It takes a little time, but it is absolutely worth the effort!

Amazing!  And worth the effort.  I've done this twice now; once as the recipe states and the second time with a creamy garlic sauce (from a different recipe.)  It's very good.

I made this as comfort food for the hubs after a long day at work. It was a hit! I have 5 kids, 2 being picky-eaters, and everyone loved it. My pickiest eater even said that it is his new favorite and that he wants it every week. The only change that I made was to leave the Roma tomatoes off.  I will be making this again and also want to make the sauce with fettuccine. I use a different recipe for dough but this may become my go-to dough recipe also. It takes a little longer but I loved the texture. Definitely a 5-star artisan pizza. It looked awesome, too!

Fantastic topping for a change although I used the Kraft 60% less fat cream alternative and only used 1 cup instead of 1.5 cups.  The chicken was amazing and had just the right amount of bite to it. Yum, yum, yum.  Oh, and I also used ready made Turkish pizza bases to make it easier and baked them on the BBQ under the hood!  Mmmmmmm!!

This was a big hit with my family.  Great food is a lot of work but the raves always make it all worth the effort.  One of my pet peaves about this site is reviews that don't review the food.  Someone here commented that this was pizza with stew, then had the audacity to rate it 2 stars.  Lady, stop reviewing food you haven't got the time or effort to make.  Noone cares that you think it sounds like pizza and stew.  It looks and tastes like a beautifully crafted blackened chicken pizza.  Thanks for posting this KOL, we all loved it and will make it often!

If you want a Chicago twist to this recipe, change the dough by using 2 cups flour+ 1 cup of cornmeal instead of 3 cups flour.

I had some leftover alfredo sauce from a previous meal and this was a perfect way to use it.  It was my first attempt at blackening chicken, so next time I will try to blacken the chicken a little longer, but it still tasted great.  I also cheated and used already made dough.   It got the ok from my husband which is hard to do!

I made this tonight but the sauce was just ok  for me. I loved the crust and the chicken. Next time I will make an alfredo sauce with extra garlic to replace this sauce. Dough was very tasty and easy to work with.

So worth the time. We had celebrated Thanksgiving early because of family having to go separate ways on that holiday. So on Thanksgiving day I decided to make a pizza....I tried this recipe. So much gourmet flavor. Nothing but delicious. The leftovers were even better. Thanks! I've made it 3 more times since.

I only used the sauce in this recipe for a gluten free pizza and let me tell you, it was fantastic! This will be my go to alfredo sauce from now on. I can't wait to make the blackened chicken at some point.

This was not only the best pizza I have made, but the best I have ever eaten. The crust tastes like a biscuit. The sauce and toppings are fantastic. It did take a long time to make but it was well worth the effort.

Husband said it was good, even though he wasn't even hungry.  :P  No spinach so used arugula instead, and a store-made pizza dough.  This pizza was loaded!  Thank you so much!

Make in steps ahead and refrigerate or freeze. Previously frozen and defrosted chicken and sauce worked perfectly. Always a hit.

This was so good! I didn't have time to make the dough so I used garlic and herb naan bread. The alfredo sauce is so good I'm keeping it for future alfredo recipes. This is one of the best pizzas I've ever had and I made it from home. Great recipe!!!

Fantastic!!! I was leery about the cumin, but once the meal was all together it blended so well. I fed it to 4 kids (11, 6, 3 and 3 years old) and they all ate it with enthusiasm. I'll definitely make this again! Thank you for sharing!!!

I made this pretty much as contained in the recipe.  I added some rosemary to the dough but otherwise stayed with the recipe.  My big complaint  is that it contains  way too much fat in the alfredo sauce.  It made the pizza seem heavy.    If I make it again I will clearly modify to make it much less calorie intensive.

The pizza was fantastic! Yes, it takes some time to make but if you get all of your prep done before starting the pizza it will come together easily. The Alfredo sauce was so good. I have copied the recipe to use when I just need Alfredo sauce. I think, at the suggestion of my husband, we could incorporate sun-dried tomatoes or other veggies when doing other dishes. I believe that this pizza is good enough to serve to company. It actually makes a beautiful presentation. Definitely a 5-star recipe!!

My whole family loved this one. I'm not a huge fan of chicken but I could eat this every day!

This is a great recipe.  I would cut down on the sugar for the crust, just reduce it to 1 tsp.  I double the Alfredo sauce or it would be too dry.

I know its been said already but the blackened chicken and alfredo sauce are fantastic!!!  This recipe makes two pizza's and I would love to know how it tastes the next day but there isn't any leftovers. Tonight I used the alfredo sauce, bacon, and blackened chicken over 12 ounces of fettuccine and it was just as well received by my hungry bunch. Honestly...I want to stick a straw in the alfedo sauce :)

Sauce turned out very good. Chicken was delicious on it's own. Crust was crispy and simple. Would definitely make it again. Everyone loved it. Only changes I made were to add about 1/2 a table spoon of Italian seasoning to the dry ingredients before mixing the crust and I used finely grated parmesan and romano cheese because it's all I had on hand. Next time I'm using shredded.

Made this gluten free by using pre-made gluten free crusts by Udi's; which also helped shave time off.  I also had Zatarain's blackened seasoning on hand so I used that instead.  I forgot to add the tomatoes, but otherwise followed the recipe to a T.   Thanks!

This was delicious. I thought I had Romano cheese but didn't. I added 1/2 cup mozzarella to the sauce   The pizza really was fantastic

Yup! Lotta time goes into this dish but it is truly a new fave in this house. And I have some serious pizza snobs in my family. I cheated and used the ready-made frozen pizza dough. I can only imagine what it would have taste like if I hadn't!
