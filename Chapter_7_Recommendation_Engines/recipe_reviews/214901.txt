There are many, many strawberry/spinach salads posted here on AR.  I've tried a number of them and haven't been disappointed yet.  And this recipe is no exception.  I did add some chopped green onions, because I almost always do.  And definitely toast the pecans (350 degrees  - 10 minutes - until fragrant).  That really enhances their flavor!  Thanks for posting!!

I was a little worried that the dressing would be too sweet, I used 1 Tbls. Agave nectar and it was soooo delicious. I made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it. Will definately make this again. Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

I was afraid the dressing was going to be too sweet when I first made it, but it turned out terrific.  Improvised with lettuce and feta cheese, and toasted the pecans in the oven with a little cinnamon, nutmeg, sugar water coating.  YUMMY and so simple.

I was hesitant to mix spinach with strawberries.  I went ahead and made the salad for myself thinking the kids would hate it.  Boy was I wrong!  The whole family loved it and keeps requesting it.  Great salad.

I made this for my boyfriend however I substituted the gorganzola for blue cheese and I made the pecans candied! Also for the dressing I learned I was out of honey so I used corn syrup! It was all fabulous and I will definately make it again. I served it with a grilled chicken breast and it made for a nice light summer dinner!

I used goat cheese instead of gorgonzola and sunflower seeds instead of pecans.  Kept everything else the same.  The dressing was good but a little strong on the balsamic.  I'd probably cut it down next time.  It also felt like it could use something else in the dressing...maybe garlic or onions???  I'm not sure....it was still good overall...

Loved it!  I've made this a lot. Sometimes with jarred salad dressing and it's fine, but the recipe dressing is better!  If you want to stretch it, add romaine.

Truly an excellent salad.  Definitely do toast the nuts beforehand (I used both pecans and walnuts).  I also subbed goat cheese for the Gorgonzola and reduced the honey to 1.5 Tbsp in the dressing.  Fantastic for summer.

Yummy!  Toasted pecans are so much better than raw - you really must take the time to toast them.  I just put them in a skillet with a little butter being careful not to burn them.  Also, fine quality balsamic vinegar will change your life - honest, it will!  I buy it by the ounce.  Oh, so good - like fine restaurant salads!

Perfect for our Easter dinner! The only thing I did differently is that I used candied pecans. I served the gorgonzola on the side in case someone did not like it. It was wonderful!!

I have been looking for something close to this recipe for 3 years!  The only difference is the salad had goat cheese and toasted sugar pecans.  This dressing is the closest I can find to it..it's as close as it can get! Thanks!

Amazing, simply amazing!  Only thing I changed was to roast the pecans, as another reviewer suggested, I added a bit of thinly sliced red onion rings as well and substituted Goat cheese for the Gorgonzola.  Next time I am going to top with a grilled chicken breast and call it dinner.  Both my partner and I loved it!  Thanks for the great recipe.

I thought this salad was so delicious! Perfect easy summer meal. I subbed raspberries and feta, toasted my pecans and added grilled chicken. I loved the dressing. Don't know how it tasted so good with only a few ingredients but it did! I only ever use natural unpasteurized honey so I didn't find it too sweet or anything. Anyway thanks for a great recipe.

This was one of the most delicious salads I have ever had. I had never tried Gorgonzola cheese before, and it was amazing.

We liked this salad, although I did feel the sharpness of the gorgonzola cheese was competing with the sweetness of the honey balsamic dressing. If I made it again I would use goat cheese.  Also the honey was a dominant flavor, which could be the brand of honey I used.  So, next time I will taste test the dressing as I add the honey to the vinaigrette.  Definitely toast the pecans.  This was so quick and easy I will serve it for a weeknight meal, but I have had better strawberry salads which I prefer for guests.

Love love love!  This is seriously one of my new favorite salads. I'd been getting bored of salads and this has totally put me back on board to eat some salad. 
Note to self: I used a bag of 50/50 Spring Mix/Baby Spinach and walnuts insted of pecans because its what I had on hand. Delish!

Absolutely delish! I cut the balsamic vinegar in half using 1/8 c of it with 1/8c balsamic glaze.  I then added red onion; slightly sautéed in a small amount of olive oil/balsamic  glaze.  Along with candied pecans & almonds and finally fresh avocado slices a top the bed of fresh spinach.  Magnific!  I'm adding this delictible salad into my daily/ weekly rotation as a main & side dish!!

I made this salad and added blueberries and bacon bits.  It was delicious.  We did  sprinkle Fetta Cheese on servings.  Yes I will definitely make it again.  I also made the dressing per the recipe and we really liked the way it tasted on the salad.

For having so few ingredients, I was pleasantly surprised by this dressing!  Tasted good.  

I substituted feta cheese and toasted walnuts for the gorgonzola and pecans.  Also tasted good with some avocado mixed in.

I used a butter lettuce, goat cheese and made candied pecans from this website. I also purchased a balsamic based dressing. The strawberries, nuts,  goat cheese and dressing make for a tangy tongue surprise.  There is simply no way to go wrong with the flavors created in this dish.

This is a wonderful salad. The only thing I changed or rather added was blueberries. I had strawberries and blueberries so used both and it was wonderful. This is a recipe I will make over and over and will share with friends. Thanks

I love salads & I don't like to buy bottled dressings. I only changed one thing--instead of strawberries, I used raspberries. DELICIOUS!  This is a great salad.  The dressing is not too sweet and compliments the berries, nuts and greens! Yum.

Yum! This is my kinda summer dinner idea - very easy, no actual cooking and delicious. I had it just like this as a main course, and that works for me, but a side of grilled chicken, or topping the salad with grilled chicken would be great too. I made it almost exactly written, but used walnuts instead of pecans (they're just so much cheaper, and the walnuts do go very well with gorgonzola), and I used more balsamic than called for; I prefer a more even ratio of oil and vinegar for salad dressing, though not exactly the same amount of each. I might have been just a touch too heavy handed with the balsamic; the bites of salad including sweet strawberries were perfect, but bites without strawberries were a little too vinegary. Anyway, this is very good. Easy to customize, yes, but there's not much of a need. These ingredients make a great salad.

I was glad to find this recipe again.  I used rice vinegar instead of balsamic in the dressing and used feta cheese instead of Gorgonzolla.  It was very good, considering I am not overly fond of fresh spinach, and is very filling.  Next time I will use a mixture of greens.

So incredibly delicious!  I halved the recipe and accidentally forgot the salt and pepper but it was so yummy, it didn't need it.  This was my lunch today and since I still have fresh spinach, fresh strawberries, and gorgonzola to use up, I'll probably make it again for dinner!

Very Good! I am not a big fan of fruit in vegetable salad, but the strawberries worked very well with the balsamic dressing. The red strawberries against the green spinach was eye appealing.I was out of pecans but will definitely add either pecans or walnuts next time. I used feta instead of garganzola.
We will make again and will be using this simple dressing on other salads.

This was really good! I will definitely be making it many times over. I switched up the quantities of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. I did equal portions and did only 1tbsp of honey but that is up to you and your taste preferences.

This was a delicious salad. Made it for a family gathering, and everyone loved it. I used Romaine lettuce instead of spinach, raspberries and mandarin oranges instead of strawberries, and feta cheese instead of gorgonzola. You can really adjust it to your tastes. The dressing is what makes it. I put it on right before serving, and it was perfect. Will definitely be making this again!

This salad is the bomb.  It tastes great.  My family loves this recipe.  The  dressing used here is delicious,  but there is also  a additional  recipe dressing in the book TheClean20 bye Dr.  Ian, which is also good to use on salads.   But I made this tonight and it is delicious.

Made pretty much as recipe stated.  Did add sliced raw mushrooms and used walnuts instead of pecans.  Served the dressing on the side, but maybe add it to salad right before serving.

The easiest yet delicious salad...I did, however, use Blue Cheese because I had it on hand...it was amazing! Make this often.

Lovely salad and dressing. My husband isn’t very keen on ‘salad’ but enjoyed this one. I used finely shredded lettuce in place of spinach leaves.

Delicious and so easy too!  I brought all of the prepared ingredients to an Easter lunch and threw them together just before serving.  Definitely a keeper!

Fabulous and easy.
 I used about  1/4 cup less of the olive oil to retain the good flavor of the balsamic.

The dressing is quick and easy to make, only 3 ingredients makes a tasty well balanced vinaigrette, perfect for spinach and strawberries.

Fantastic recipe and no poppy seed dressing. I subbed blue cheese for the gorgonzola and candied walnuts for the pecans. Great dressing. Great salad.

I  omitted the cheese and used candied almonds in place of the pecans (although I'm sure either would be fine).  The resulting salad was excellent.

I substituted Feta cheese instead and roasted the pecans slightly in a pan for a few minutes before adding to the rest. Really tasty!

Keeper but made a few twists to the dressing: added a whole clove of minced garlic and a heaping teaspoon of ginger paste and topped it off with sesame seeds. Paired great with the salad. Delish!

This is a simple, tasty salad.  I've now made it several times.  My only adjustments were that, after making it the first time, I felt it didn't need that much olive oil, so I cut that down to 1/4 cup.  I also slivered the pecans and toasted them in the oven before adding them to the salad.  Delicious!

I made this salad for lunch with friends and everyone loved it. I added fresh kale and chard rom our garden to the spinach and chopped roasted almonds instead of pecans. I also added blueberries and gooseberries (also from our garden). I served it with the Marinated Greek Chicken Breast (not Kabobs) also a recipe from All Recipes.

Excellent! I scaled this way down because I was just making a large salad for myself. I also added a little red onion; my pecans were sweet & spicy, so that made it even better. I'll definitely make this again! Nice recipe!

When I first made the dressing, I was afraid it would taste too much like olive oil.  But when it is combined with the salad, WOW.  Really good.

Delicious! I plan to live on this salad this summer. Toasted the pecans on the stovetop, and followed the directions otherwise, just without the cheese.

Loved it, was out of honey so used 5 splenda packets. I have made this many times and added grilled chicken, toasted almonds instead of the pecans. Tried nectarines and blueberries, All good! Great basic recipe that can be changed up with what's in your cupboard. Delicious!

This is the recipe I always made at parties that everyone one loved! I skipped the cheese, any nuts such as walnuts, pecans, almonds will do. The honey vinegarette makes it! I add a little orange rind to it and/or orange juice. And white wine vinegar. If u are short of time, raspberry vinagarette also works well. Health, and simple!

This was very good.  I am not a fan of balsamic vinegar but I used it and it was good dressing.  The only thing different I did was use Stilton cheese and dressing the salads individually.  I will do this again!

Dressing was simple and delicious! Make sure it is well-stirred.
