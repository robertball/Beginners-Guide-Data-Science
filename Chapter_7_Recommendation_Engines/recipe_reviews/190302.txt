Today is the first time I have ever made mole sauce. I thought the ingredients on the list were easy to purchase, and the cooking time was relatively short. I was a bit concerned as to how much I would like the chocolate part, but it was quite tasty. I did add a tad of jalepeno chili chopped finely, and a bit of tomatoes in the initial cooking of the onions, chicken, and garlic. Also, I added a tiny bit more chocolate and chili powder after tasting. I will def. make it again. Boardered on a 5 star!!

I've made many recipes from AR and this is one of the few I haven't liked; and I'm not a picky eater. I do enjoy sweet and savoury combinations however something about the way the sauce tasted did not please my tastebuds. I'm just glad I tasted this before cutting up the chicken and tossing it in! I have never tried a mole before. This may be for some, and not for others. I'm not trying to give your recipe a bad name, Deondra! I'll just have to look up something else I can toss together with the boiled chicken.
