My family and I thought this was a great recipe!  I, as usual, could not stick to the recipe and modified it by halving the recipe, putting it in a pie crust, adding lemon juice to the apples, using more pomegranate (as suggested in a previous review) and dotting the top with caramel quarters.  I was really surprised as it was not 'seedy', as I had expected, and the chewy bits of caramel were quite nice!  This dessert was a big hit!

I scaled this down to 2 servings and used a 7 x 5" pan.  That made 1/8 of a pomegranate so I just used about 1/2 c seeds.  It's very good but the pomegranate taste wasn't very noticeable although that could be due to my scaling down, not the original recipe.  I will use more pomegranate seeds next time and maybe even some pomegranate syrup.

Easy to make and even easier to eat.  A great way to use a pomegranate.

YUM!  I saw pomegranate at the grocery and decided to try it.  It really adds good color and texture to the apple crisp.  I added cardamom and carmel (the store  bought apple-dipping variety).  Good Stuff!

Just made it tonight and it was absolutely delicious!! Some reviewers had mentioned that the topping wasn't enough, so I just made sure not level off when measuring and had just enough.    Also, in response to other reviewers complaining of the pomegranate being too crunchy, perhaps it wasn't ripe enough?  We had no issue with the pomegranate being too crunchy, but it did complement the apples beautifully.

Um, yum!  This was delicious.  The first time I've ever used fresh pomegranate in a recipe.  The only things I changed:  I used seeds from the whole pomegranate (instead of half), put about 3 Tbsp. butter (in small chunks) in with the apple/pom mixture before topping with crisp, and, instead of white flour, used 3/4 c. whole wheat, 1/4 c. buckwheat, and 3 Tbsp. ground flax for extra healthiness.  Fantastic!

I used 2 medium Braeburns and 1 large Gala, (all the apples I had on hand), and all the seeds as opposed to 1/2. My mother-in-law and my husband fell in love with it at first bite, as did I. I used a smidge less than the 1/2 cup of brown sugar, baked for 45 minutes - absolutely delicious. To those who are complaining of it being crunchy - that's the nature of a pomegranate, and unless you got a really old pom, it's highly doubtful that the seeds were hard enough to break teeth.   I'd give this recipe 10 stars if I could - thank you, Brenola, for sharing this delicious recipe!

This was my first experience with Pomegranate seeds and I did find them a bit tough on the teeth. It was pretty tasty - especially warm with vanilla ice cream on top.  If I made it again, I might cut back on some of the nutmeg and maybe some of the sugar.  I would also use Granny Smith apples as the ones I had on hand were Fuji and quite sweet.  I would like it a little more tart.

We tried this recipe and it was not very good at all.  My husband winced at his first bite and proceeded to spit out several pomegranate seeds.  Yikes!  The cinnamon was also very strong.  Only dentists would recommend this recipe as it would increase their business in repairing broken teeth!

I liked the taste of this, but didn't like the texture of the cooked pomegranate. I wasn't very happy with how the crust turned out either, I thought it was too soft. I might make this again as a pie with pomegranate juice rather than the seeds.

Awesome!  Super easy and really tasty.  The seeds break down well as they cook, so they're not hard in the finished product.  I'll keep this for regular use, but will also try to adapt it for a holiday pie.  The poms are a great surprise to the taste buds!

I thought this was wonderful. Would be great with ice cream!  The pomegranates were a little hard, but I loved this.  My kids didn't care for it though, and my husband thought it was too tart. I did add a bit more cinnamon and a little nutmeg.

I used a whole pomegranate instead of a half, but other than that followed the directions exactly.  It came out AMAZING!  I don't think the pomegranate seeds were hard on the teeth at all.  I am wondering if the people who had hard seeds had pomegranates that weren't ripe enough?  Even raw they shouldn't hurt to bite down on...

Excellent recipe.  We didn't have any problem with seeds like other reviewers did.  Maybe not all pomegranates are created equal.

Because I was using up a pomegranate, I used about 3/4 of one.  I had Jonagolds, which are pretty sweet, so I only used 1/3 cup of brown sugar.  Because others mentioned there not being enough topping, I added an additional 1/8 cup of oats and flour (whole wheat pastry flour), and got just enough to completely cover the fruit.  Lot of juice on the bottom, but it was bright and unique and delicious, and got me a hug from the kidlet.  If that's not worth 5 stars, I don't know what is.

This was great. I did use more pomegranate than it called for and I thought it was better with a little more.  I made it for x-mas dessert and it was a hit.  I even used Brown sugar from splenda to save a little on the sugar.  It turned out great.

I don't know why anyone would complain about the pomegranate crunch except if they bought some bad pomegranate.  I live in the Middle East and my recipe was fantastic.  If anything I would double it for a 9x13 pan and cook a bit longer.  Otherwise I'd say it only serves 5.

I made this dish for a pomegranate cook-off and it got rave reviews.  The arils softened up after cooking and gave the apples a great flavor.  Will make again!

I thought it was great, but a tad sweet so I cut back on the brown sugar.  I also found that the topping worked best if the butter was softened, not melted.

My family loved this, especially my 6 year old! The flavors work wonderfully together and it's very sweet (which I like). I love recipes that use the entire pomegranate seeds because I am too lazy to juice them. This was perfect!

This was a simple and delicious dessert.  My daughter says it was "like heaven!"  We reduced the amount of sugar, but could probably have used even a bit less.  Take into account the sweetness of the apples you're using.  The pomegranate seeds were a tasty accompaniment to the apples, and the oats in the crust had a nubbiness that gave it a nice overall texture.  YUM!

This is delicious! Just make sure when you're making the crumbly part that you don't melt the butter and then pour it all into the oatmeal/sugar. Because I did that and ended up with a bowl of mush. Whoops.

I followed the original recipe but added maybe three times as many pomegranate seeds. Because of this, I didn't run into the overly sweet problem. It was delicious.

We really enjoyed this.  I give it a four-star only because I modified the recipe but based on my result I suspect if I had followed the recipe it would deserve a five.  I halved it for starters and baked it in a small casserole dish.  I used two Bosc pears instead of apples and probably used more pomegranate seeds in proportion.  Sprinkled the pears with a little lemon juice and decreased the cinnamon a tad.  Made the topping with softened butter instead of melted. But, oh, so good!  I had planned to serve it with a little cream but had it plain instead and we loved it.  The pomegranate seeds gave a slight crunch which we enjoyed.  A keeper.

This recipe doesn't make enough for a 9x13 dish; it would be better in a square pan. It would probably also be better not to melt the butter before mixing the topping ingredients together. If the butter were cold or even room temperature, you could in fact create crumbles; with melted butter, it's impossible to spread the topping evenly over the filling.

Fantastic. I used a store-bought pie crust for the bottom (in a pie dish) and followed the rest of the recipe exactly. It was delicious. The seeds were not crunchy. Everyone from the grandparents to the little children loved it. It was also lovely looking. I will upload a pic. Highly recommend. Especially since poms are at their peak right now!

AMAZING. Period. We first tried out a small 2 serving one, and it was so good we just finished making three 8 serving ones for Thanksgiving. I found this recipe when I was looking for pomegranate recipes (because we have a tree that is simply overflowing). I can't wait for tomorrow to get to eat them!

OMG that was so good...I so needed vanilla ice cream with it.  If you need an easy way to remove pomegranate seeds do it in a bowl of water (the seeds sink to the bottom while the pulp floats).  This was so good and the only thing I changed was I used whole wheat flour...DIVINE!

The pomegranate seeds were a little crunchy, but a few more minutes in the oven would have solved that.  The combination of apple and pomegranate was fantastic, and one I would not have thought of!

Great! Nice variation on Apple Crisp. I used all the seeds from my pomegranate so upped the brown sugar to close to a cup. And also baked it longer which really plumped the seeds up nicely.  Next time I think I'd like to make more of the topping tho - it covered ok, but was a bit scant, which is why 4 stars.

I had to use a couple of pomegranates before they went bad, found this recipe, messed around with it (used the juice from one pomegranate and all the seeds from another), and love the results.  A great dessert and keeps for about a week.

This was very easy to make, apart from the bit of time disecting a pomegranate takes.  I served it at a shower (2 batches) and the dishes were scraped clean!

I made this as written. Even as I read I thought the dish would be too big for just 4 apples and 40 minutes seemed too long. It came out a little mushy for my taste and the crust sunk into the apples. Tasted okay. But since I was taking to church dinner I wanted to make it look better.  I scraped all of it into a 9" plate and remade a crust using a gluten free recipe in AllRecipes. I then baked it for 15" . It turned out okay.

This is simple and delicious. I made a batch for a party and people were almost scraping the pan!   I made a few changes. I pu tin LOTS more pomegranates seeds - I think around 2 whole poms worth - sp I added maybe 1/8 cup of white sugar to off set the tartness, and was generous with the cinnamon. I made a batch of topping usin melted butter but it never formed "coarse crumbs," so I made another batch using room temp butter that I rubbed into the oat/flour/suagr mixture, which made it less goopy and more like the crumb topping I'm used to.   I didn't peel the apples and you couldn't even tell. I used 7 small organic gala apples and I think sweeter apples offset the pomegranate nicely.  This is very simple and a great, tasty twist on apple crumple!

Very sweet, but a delicious treat. I used almost double the oats to cut the sweet a little, but that is also one of my favorite parts. Good recipe to keep on hand when you have a pomegranate at home to use up.

A great way to use pomegranates!  I followed for the most part, except  - did NOT melt butter, but rather cut in room temperature  - added in extra sugar mix I had used from Evelyns Sour Cream Twists from this site.

This recipe was a huge hit with the family, with one, tiny exception.  The pomegranate seeds were the only complaint.  I could handle it, but others in the family did not enjoy the seeds (even though they had been softened by cooking) being stuck in their teeth.  Next time, I'll juice the seeds and add that to the apples. Other than that, this recipe is a keeper.

This was really good. I used a bit more oats for the topping, and also added a little more pomegranate.  I don't really understand the issues others have had with hard pomegranate seeds. I eat raw seeds frequently as a snack, and have never experienced this.

This is a wonderful dessert.  I almost never comment on recipes, and I rarely make them multiple times; but I've now made this one two weeks in a row, and love it.  Definitely serve it warm, not room temperature.

I will make it again because I want to cut down on the sugar.  But I wonder why the butter is melted and then says to rub butter to make coarse crumbs? I skipped the melted step.

This was easy and great. I tweaked the recipe with lemon juice, pomegranate molasses, caramel, sweet apples, tart apples, extra pomegranate, and substituted Pumpkin Pie Spice, and brought it to a BBQ potluck. This dessert vanished while others lingered and endured the leftover walk-of-shame back home.  I'm only giving the recipe four, rather than five, stars because it should include all of these ingredient options, as suggested by others, as part of the basic recipe.  I would also double the topping going forward, another previous suggestion.  This is DEFINITELY going to be on this year's Thanksgiving menu, and next's!!

Good, but too much nutmeg (and I do like nutmeg). I used a whole pomagranet and granny smith apples with some lemon juice mixed in for added tartness.  Will make again but much lighter on the nutmeg :)

I really enjoyed this recipe!  
I used about 3/4 a pomegrante and I used 1/2 cup of olive oil instead of butter.  
The end result was a very good tasting crisp and I loved the texture that pomegranate added.

I had to cook mine a little longer because I used more apples, but, overall, the taste was pretty good.  The pomegranate seeds were a little weird....unexpectedly crunchy.  (First time in my life I've ever had fresh pomegranate!)  Thanks for this recipe though, sort of healthy and mostly delicious.

I had pomegranate to use and found this recipe.  I hadn't made a crisp before but this was incredibly easy and was so tasty!

I used a whole pomegranate.  Great with a topping of plain yoghurt which is a good compliment to the sweetness of the Crisp. Also good with ice cream.

My tree was full and we had a game night planned, so we took it to our good friends to sample for desert.  I enjoyed it very much, and everyone else seemed to as well.  Next time, I plan on adding roasted walnuts.

I didn't measure anything. I just included all the ingredients & cooked as directed. It had enough moisture & was great! Served with ice cream. I had none left!

Used Fuji apples. Turned out too sweet and heavy on cinnamon. Recommend significantly reducing sugar and cinnamon.

Best apple crisp I had. Pomegranates were not crunchy and it has a nice slightly tart yet interesting flavor. This tasted like you would order it from a fancy restaurant.

This was excellent. Loved the combination of apple and pomegrante. My hubby thought there was too much cinnamon but he doesn't care for cinnamon. Next time, I'll probably use half the amount of cinnamon.

This is the best way I have found to use pomegranate seeds and  I love apples.  My family loves pomegranate so we were both happy.  I would make it again.  I did cut back on the cinnamon.

Love this recipe! I like adding just a couple tablespoons of lemon juice for an extra little tartness. If you don't have a pomegranate or you don't want to deal with peeling it and extracting the seeds, you can also chop some fresh cranberries as a substitute. Works really well with either fruit!

I have made this a couple of times.  I love the flavor of this crisp.  If you like things on the tart side, this recipe is for you.

Like another reviewer did, I cut the recipe in half (except for the topping, I made the full recipe plus some) and baked it in a pie shell. Nice alternative to the basic apple crisp. Definitely a new favorite!

This is a fantastic recipe.  The second time, I had learned that melted butter will not yield a crumbly mixture.  I revised the ingredients to read 1 stick (1/2 cup)unsalted butter softened to room temperature; 2 hours or so from refrigerator to usage.
