This was not good.No one here would eat it and my kids are not picky.  It tasted pretty much like red wine vinegar.  Maybe using plain red wine would be better but I don't think it's even worth the effort of playing around with this recipe.  I pitched it.

Had to add a little more sugar to reduce effect or red wine vinegar. Very good made a fair cut of meat taste much better.

I used thin cut chuck steaks and only marinated them for an hour and 20 minutes.  I added splenda instead of sugar and used just a smidge more than 1/2 a teaspoon.  They turned out delicious! MmmmmMmmMmmm! Thanks for the recipe!

Great use for a lower quality cut of meat! I also, added some sugar to cut the vinegar. Very enjoyable meal!

I thought it was easy, quick, and tasty - I didn't feed it to kids, so I'm just guessing they'd like it.

Made this using plain Cabernet Sauvignon re wine instead of the vinegar.  I tenderized the meat before marinating in the wine.  Using a large freezer bag made it easier to marinate using less of the wine.  Turned out very tasty.  Added a little tabasco to the marinade to give it a little bite.  Loved it.  Thanks for the recipe.

OK,, so I used what I had,, but what I have done is put everything in a Dutch Oven and cooked it on top of the stove for about 45 minutes,, Then  in the Oven for about an hour..  I added a few things to it, Onions, and Red Bell Peppers.. I must say...It turned out Wonderful.  I did add a bit of water to the mix.

Did not care for this at all.  Too strong vinegar taste. I forgot to read the reviews before I made this.

I don't usually write reviews, but this was so bad, no one would eat it.  No one likes the taste of vinegar and that's all it was.  So frustrating to have wasted a whole package of meat.

This recipe was awful. Way too much of all the spices - just a bad recipe. :0
