I prepared this for the first time on Thanksgiving this year and got raves all around. Used Herb Lipton instead of Onion Lipton and it was wonderful! My son asked how to make it for his family. Couldn't get a better compliment than that.

I used a 7lb. bone in turkey breast.  Eliminated the dry onion mix completely! Placed breast in pot and poured 1 can chicken broth and a little water over it..  Rubbed butter under skin and seasoned  with all the spices listed PLUS sage, poultry seasoning, thyme, rosemary and a pinch of paprika. Put chopped onion, celery, and carrots around the turkey.  Cooked on high 1 hour then low for 7.   It literally fell off the bone taking it out of crock pot!  Under the broiler it went for about 7 mins to brown skin and it was perfect!  I've never had such moist white turkey meat!  This was great for a small family holiday dinner but  I won't wait for the holidays to make it again!

This was a quick and delicious way to prepare a boneless turkey breast.  I am only giving it 4 stars because I did make some modifications as suggested by previous reviewers and I feel like it wouldn't be a 5-star recipe without those modifications. Here's some helpful tips: if you are using a completely defrosted standard Butterball 3-lb boneless turkey roast, you will only need 1/2 of the spice mixture--if not less--also, I used my thermometer/timer gadget, and the turkey hit 165 degrees at the 4 hour mark, lastly, I only used 1/2 packet of onion soup mix (it was all that I had) and I think if I would have used any more than that, it would have been WAY too salty and artificial-tasting, and instead of using water, I used apple cider, since my dressing recipe has chopped apples in it. It turned out flavorful, tender, and the drippings made a killer gravy!

Delicious! I did a 5lb turkey breast and halved everything with it keeping the same cook time and it came out perfect. It was moist and the seasonings tasted great.

I am not a slow cooker  aficionado but my oven is not right, so....Tried this today for easy Christmas dinner, my family loved it! They said don't change a thing, but I will cut back cook time since it was a smaller breast next time. Only mods were to add some poultry seasoning, some  herbs de Florence instead of just basil and no seasoned salt because I had none, and used chicken stock instead of water. I also added logs of celery, baby carrots and one onion, chunk cut. Awesome! Family said they could eat this every Christmas and they cleaned their plates. 4. Lb bone in breast yielded 6 servings with a lot of leftovers. Thanks for a great addition to my recipe box!

I used 8lb bone-in turkey breast and only 1 envelope of onion soup; plus the other spices ( just slightly less) This fit in my 6 qt. slow cooker very nicely. It was fabulous; meat fell right off the bone after 8-9 hours. I used the broth for au-jus which was delicious. Meat was tender and moist; very tasty.

So good and moist!  I cut this recipe down to use a 3 lb boneless turkey breast and it was super flavorful.  We all really enjoyed this.

My turkey did not come out as good as I wanted it to, but I am giving this recipe 5 stars anyways because I am pretty sure it was my fault. The spices are on point, totally awesome. I used a 3 pound boneless turkey breast and I found so many recipes online saying conflicting arguments about cooking it frozen vs thawed. So I defrosted it in the fridge for 14 hours and it was partially frozen in the center when I threw it in the crock pot. I put it on low for 8.5 hours. It tasted very good, but I am pretty sure 7 or maybe even 6 hours would have worked fine. Also, my slow cooker comes with a rack and instead of putting the turkey directly in the water & spice mix I placed it on the rack. Next time I may try putting it directly in the mix.

This was delicious. I had a 5 lb bone-in breast so I cut the cooking time accordingly but didn't change the measurements for ingredients and it turned out delicious... even for the pickiest eater in the house! Thanks.

Super easy to do and was very good. I didn't have such a big turkey breast so I only used 1 envelope onion soup mix and used chicken broth instead of the water.

I used 3 lbs. of boneless skinless turkey breast.  I didn't have onion soup mix, so I just put all the other spices, plus sage (just eye-balled all of the amounts) into a crockpot on low with 1/2 cup water.  It cooked in less that 4 hours.  Once done, I put it on "warm" and put some pats of grassfed butter in the crockpot. That kicked it up another notch...it needed some fat in there - b/c as you know turkey breast has almost no fat, and can be a bit dry.  Anyway - GREAT recipe - even tho I didn't follow it much, it was my inspiration.  Thank you!

I LOVED this recipe!  The turkey breast was very moist, tender, and extremely flavorful.  It was the best turkey I've ever had!  Thanks for sharing.

I was really nervous after putting all the ingredients in the slow cooker.  I only had a 3 pound boneless turkey breast and did not adjust the other ingredients accordingly.  In less than 4-1/2 hours my turkey reached 165 degrees.  I kept it on the warm setting for another 1-1/2 hours.  It came out delicious.  It was not too salty, and I don't care for salt.  Alll of the flavors blended together nicely.  My son thought it smelled a bit like pizza while cooking, which disappointed him that I wasn't actually making pizza.  I didn't have enough sauce for "au jus".  This was very easy and delicious.  I will definitely make it again.

I used the 3.5 pound turkey breast roast with only 1 pack of the soup mix, cut to 4 hours cookin and it came out amazing. So tender and moist. Even the picky 5 year old loved it and had seconds!

Really great. Definite keeper for guests or for a regular day. Plenty of leftovers, too. I added carrots, onion, and celery at the bottom of the pot, only used one soup packet, and rubbed some of the spice mixture under the skin. Just make sure your crock pot is big enough. Naturally that should go without saying, but ... sigh.

This was wonderful. I made it for christmas dinner and my mother loved it so much she took all the left overs. My changes were: I forgot to pick up the onion soup mix so I skipped that step and just used chicken broth for the flavor rather than water. I was not able to find a boneless turkey breast over 3 pounds so I got two and used two crock pots. I used half of the spices listed and split it between the two. (All though I went a little heavy handed with the parsley for the look of it). It came out delicious! My only thought is if you decide to use chicken broth and you don't like a salty flavor, try low sodium broth. While everyone loved it - I felt it might have needed a bit less salt.  

I am making this again tonight because my husband was so impressed that he said "you got lucky, let's see you do it again" :) all in fun. I was so impressed with the results without the onion soup mix that I have decided to skip that step again.

Mix of flavors resulted in a really yummy turkey! I got bone-in and it would not fit in my crock-pot, so I ended up roasting in oven. But definitely will make again and without bones so it will fit in the crock-pot!

The combination of herbs and spices makes this a tasty and easy dinner addition. The ease of cooking it in a slow cooker only makes you love it that much more. I used a frozen Butterball 3 pound turkey breast and followed the directions. it was so good I had to add it to my recipe box!

Made this yesterday and it was the best. Used a bone in breast I had; substituted chicken broth for the water and added a can of whole cranberry sauce to the onion soup mix.  It was so tender and juicy.  The spices made it so flavorful.  I'm going to make it again at Thanksgiving....  Being Able to do it in the slow cooker makes it easy to do anytime.

Awesome turkey-everyone loved it!  Could only find 3 lb boneless, so I used 2 in 1 crock pot.  Only used 1 soup mix and slightly reduced the other herbs/spices.  I'm really bad about getting ahead of myself, so I had mixed all the herbs/spices/soup mix/water together before I realized I was only supposed to mix the soup and water, then sprinkle on the rest.  Well, it was still great.  Will definitely be making this on a regular basis.  It will be nice having turkey, other than just on Thanksgiving.  Thanks for the recipe:)

We loved it.  I used sliced turkey cutlets and not a whole breast.  I substituted dry white wine for the water.  It was a big hit.  I will make this again for the holidays next year.

I omit seasong packet and add broth or stock instead of water and use poultry seasoning with fresh poultry style herbs and use butter pats under skin and olive oil to season.

I loved this recipe.  I did everything the same, had a 8.5 lb bone-in turkey breast and the only difference was that I threw in some spanish paprika with the other spices and removed the skin. Moist and juicy even without the skin. Pleasantly surprised and will definitely be doing this again!  Thanks for sharing.

Mouth watering and  " no need " for a knife with this recipe. So tender and juicy - and super convenient to prepare/make.  By far the best tasting turkey recipe in my books!!

the recipe works perfectly. Only reason for 4 stars rather than 5 is the lack of flavor in the turkey. The spices which are sprinkled over the turkey breast simply stay on top of the skin . . . which we don't eat. Would suggest rubbing them under the skin before cooking.

Best slow cooker turkey recipe!  Used a 5 lb. turkey breast and cut the recipe in half. I followed the recipe and it was so moist and tender.  Very flavorful!  I will definitely make this again!

I used a bone-in turkey breast and it was pretty good. I will agree with some of the other reviewers that there is a bit too much salt for me so next time I will definitely reduce the amount of seasoned salt next time. Overall I got a moist, fall-off-the-bone turkey breast for Thanksgiving so I'm pleased.

I used this recipe with two turkey thighs and a small breast.  It was delicious!!  Guests were picking at it before it was even served.

The only thing that I would change next time is the amount of salt.  I would reduce the salt by a 1/2 or a full TBSP because the gravy that I made from the cooking juices was very salty.

I also shoved TBSP slices of butter under the skin to help baste from the top down.

I made this for Thanksgiving with a 9 pound breast. It was wonderful!!!!! the top browned with it and it was so tender and juicy. It will produce enough juice to make gravy along with it.

I tried this recipe last year and didn't much like it because it was way too salty. The turkey was nice and moist though, it pretty much fell apart! If I try it again I will not use the onion soup, but will use sliced onions.

Way too salty (and much too high sodium content) for our taste.  It simmered instead of roasted.  I ended up rinsing the cooked product, refrigerating it overnight and serving as sliced turkey sandwiches the next day and turkey salad the day after.

This created a soft and flavorful meat. To make it a full meal, I placed chunks of potatoes all around the turkey breast. Then, halfway through the cooking, I tossed in a full bag of frozen baby carrots. Everything had an excellent flavor.

Excellent! I used with a 5 lb. turkey breast, used chicken broth instead of water, and decreased spices from tbsp. to tsp.  The family loved it! Looking forward to making paninis with this turkey  breast next time!

It was the moistest turkey and tasted great...I used half a container of onion soup and half of a spice soup and the other spices. My turkey breast was just under three pounds and I cooked it on low and for three hours and it was tasty and very moist!

The kitchen smelled like Thanksgiving all day! I served my 4 lb. boneless turkey breast to raves!  The meat was tender and juicy with a delicious flavor.  I made this recipe just as written. My breast was smaller so I cut the spices in Half. I kept All The rest of the measurements the same. The turkey was was done in 7 1/2 hours on low.

I used a 4.6 lbs turkey breast. I melted 2 tbs evoo and 2 tbs butter and brushed it all over the turkey and under the skin too. I added a cup of low sodium chix broth and 1/2 of Chardonnay. I quartered a sweet onion and peeled and chopped two garlic cloves. I omitted the soup mix and water mixture but followed the other ingredients. I cooked on high for one hour and low for four hours. I turned the breast to breast side down half way through the cooking time. the turkey literally fell off the bone. I made a nice gravy from it as well. perfect recipe for Sunday dinner.

Loved the love in this herb rub!  I used a 6# bone-in breast, and removed the skin so I could rub the herb mix directly on the meat.  I cooked 8 1/2 hours on low, this was so moist and tender. I did halve the rub and liquid.  A definite do-over!  Thanks for sharing this recipe with AR.

How have I lived this long and never discovered the wonder of the slow cooker turkey breast?!  I made it exactly as listed, halving the recipe for a four pound breast.  Took five minutes to prepare with common ingredients everyone has on hand - result was moist and delicious.

This is soooo good and soooo easy! Made it for Christmas...for just me and my husband so went with a 7+ pound turkey breast....and it took less than 6 hours to cook. What a delicious and moist way to cook turkey breast. Definitely going to make this again!

So delicious. You can adjust the ingredients as needed to taste, as it is high in sodium with the soup mix; I suggest cutting that back a bit. I made this dish to add/augment my sisters turkey and was a fave all around.

This recipe was awesome. The meat was moist and tender and very flavorful. The meat fell off the bone. Loved the crust of herbs baked on the skin. I plan to make this again. The recipe is a keeper.

I found this to be too salty and I just felt there was too much and also overwhelming spice on a turkey breast.   I’ll pass.

I use a little less liquid when slow cooking large sized meats or poultry for crisping. But that is just my personal preference. First time I slow cooked  a tied turkey breast and It was great!

So, I had a dilemma...and my turkey breast was frozen solid, and entirely TOO big for my crock pot.  
So...after much deliberation,   I decided to defrost in the microwave for about 30 minutes...turning have way through.  
Then I followed the recipe.  All of my herbs were fresh though.
I cooked in the oven, covered in foil.  About 30 minutes before it was complete I took the foil off so the skin would be crisp.  
I was terrified that the turkey would be dry, and hard to swallow.  IT WAS DELICIOUS!  SO FLAVORFUL.  All the leftovers were gone the next day.  
Definitely worth making!

Just delicious. I cooked in on low for 8+ hours. I recommend going all the way to 9 hours. It'll be fine. Great with garlic mashed potatoes on the side; and perfect all week for sandwiches at lunch.

This was so moist  had such a great flavor!  Used a bone in turkey breast, cooked on high for 1 hour then low for over 7 (recommended from previous review).  Followed recipe exactly and was wonderful.

It was good. The meat was tender, falling off the bone. As for the spices, I only added one onion soup mix when I should of added two because I was reading the reviews and others said it was to salty. I thought it needed more flavor so next time I won’t skimp on the flavoring.

I really want to give this 3 stars because I did not really like it. However I may be the reason because I didn't follow exactly. I used 3-4lb. bone-in breast & halved all other ingredients. cooked on low 8-9hrs. Had a very bland taste. Not usual taste I like for Turkey.

I only used 2 small boneless turkey breasts, about 6 pounds total, and I changed the onion soup mix to vegetable dip mix.  It was a bit saltier than my dad likes, so I will omit the seasoned salt next time. Dad wants it for Thanksgiving.  Excellent flavor and so easy!

I made it with a 3lb boneless roast- half the amount of onion soup mix and used chicken broth instead of water-  with all the other ingredients -cooked it for 6 hours. The meat was tender but tasted like boiled turkey-terrible- the only flavor was in the pot juices that I made gravy out of and poured it all over the meat to make it somewhat edible.

I used a small already cooked smoked turkey breast and by adding these ingredients minus the salt  + a tablespoon of butter on top into the slow cooker, it gave it a decent flavor and kept it moist.  Next time I think I'd leave the parsley out.  I just need to add stuffing and some gravy as sides to satisfy me.

This is my go to recipe for turkey breast. I had trouble for years trying to make one that both my husband & I like, many coming out blah. I saw this & really like it. Moist, tender, flavorful, no fail turkey.  But don't substitute the season all salt , using Mrs. Dash instead. I made that mistake & there was some season in it that made for an overpowering flavor.  We do not care to eat the seasonings sprinkled on it. I still put it on, but scrap it & the skin off. We're not fans of the skin & fat underneath anyway. Thanks for this great recipe!

I was going to use this on a turkey breast for Thanksgiving but when I was ready to start noticed that it was pre-seasoned, so I just made it now using a whole chicken instead.  It makes a delicious slow-cooked chicken, too.

Very easy recipe. But I thought this was just ok. Best part was being able to slow cook it and not worry about it.

I tried this for our Thanksgiving since boneless, skinless turkey breast is easily available in Hungary where we are living.  It was very easy to cook it in the crockpot and the recipe was simple and quick.  The turkey turned out only slightly dry but tasty.  My husband commented that it was good, but that he likes my usual seasonings better.

The herb flavors were present, however, there was far too much salt for my taste.  The salt in the onion soup plus the seasoned salt caused this problem.  I’ll try again with an adjustment.

My husband loved this.  I loved the flavors of the au jus/gravy and plan on making a cream of turkey/wild rice soup with the leftover au jus/gravy and turkey.  I didn't find the turkey THAT juicy and tender as others have raved about.  To me, it was like roasted turkey breast....some pieces were juicy and others were dry and mealy.  But, my husband gives it a very enthusiastic thumbs up!

This was such a good meal!  I did cut back a little on the dry onion soup mix, but I added shallots, and we will be making this again.  With the slow cooker, I can have turkey during the week and excellent sandwiches for lunches.

I fixed a 6.75 lb. bone-in breast and cooked it for about 7.5 hours.  I personally thought the turkey (skin) was too salty, but my crew loved it.  The meat was delicious though, and I will definitely make again.  Next time I will eliminate either the soup mixture or the seasoned salt.  Served wth homemade mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. Good stuff!

I always make a mirepoix and place turkey breast over the vegetables.  I substituted chicken stock for water.  Delicious flavors.

Will make again for sure. Omitted the onion soup mix as I didn't have on hand and added onion and carrots, otherwise followed ingredients to the letter. Also only had a 3 lb turkey so I cooked on high for 2 hours. So juicy and fork tender.

Cut recipe in half for a 5 pounder (and reduced cooking time - used a thermometer to confirm doneness). It came out wonderfully juicy and with a great flavor.  I also added celery and a quartered onion around the sides and the broth was the perfect base for a turkey soup the next day.

I'm giving this recipe 2 stars because it was easy to make, and the breast sliced nicely.  But despite following the directions, the meat was the typical, dry turkey breast meet.  I put a whole onion cut into fourths and a couple of carrots in the crock pot, and they were the best part of the dish!  There was a far amount of juice, and perhaps I should have thickened it and made gravy, but I just served it on the side.   But even the juice didn't save this dish.  

I always brine my Thanksgiving turkey but based on other comments, I didn't think I would need to brine the breast.  Bit mistake!  Also, I don't understand how anyone would think the recipe is too salty.  It's not.

All in all a disappointing dish.  Next time I will brine the breast in hopes of a moister, tastier bird.

I used drumsticks and thighs and they turned out great. I did put some chicken broth in the bottom of the crockpot and use that liquid to make gravy.

I made a 5lb turkey breast but put it in the oven, breast side down on a bed of veggies.  It was incredible!  The seasoning was spot on and so tender.  It was a hit!  Will do it the same next time.

Made this for Thanksgiving this year.  Everyone loved it.  I didn't change ingredients, but since I was using skinless, boneless turkey breast only cooked it for 5 hours. Next time I would do it for a little less time.  But it was great!!

I don't have a slow cooker big enough for a 10 lb breast so I just did 2 smaller ones. I used the gravy packets from them also with all the rest of the listed ingredients. I'm in charge of making the turkey for all holidays from now on because of this recipe. Before we always ended up with dry bland birds. Not now! I even cooked one an hour longer than I should have and it was still tender, juicy, and flavorful. It's hard to screw up this recipe.

My family LOVES this recipe. The only changes I made are I use a 7lb bone-in turkey breast (our grocery store doesn't carry boneless and I ran into trouble with a larger breast.  I had to bungee cord the crock pot lid on that day to hold it on.) and I use chicken stock instead of water.  This comes out so tender and is easy to toss in the crock pot before work.   Once its done I pour the juices through a mesh strainer and make gravy.  Absolutely the BEST turkey I have ever made.

I made this recipe, but only for 2 lbs of boneless turkey breast (because I only cook for my husband and I). I used 1/2 a teaspoon of all seasonings and 1 packet of dry onion soup mix. I also used a little more chicken soup stock and mixed in some water. Just enough to cover the turkey breasts. It was so tasty! We will definitely be making this again!

This was delicious! I could only find a 3 pound turkey roast so I cut the recipe in half, it made enough to feed three and I have leftovers for a whole other meal. With the smaller turkey I should have reduced the cook time but with my work schedule it cooked for 10 hours so it was a tad dry but with the juice as an au jus it was just fine. I will definitely make this again.

I made this for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it. It was so moist compared to cooking turkey in the oven.

Turkey came out really juice. I used french onion soup mix because it was the only thing left and it still came out great.

So good and so easy!  I had 2 three pound boneless turkey breasts. I didn't realize they were boneless when I bought them.  Turned out to be a happy mistake. They both fit nicely in my 7qt crock pot.  I will get that type  again.  There was no wasted turkey.   I only used 1 envelope of dry onion soup mix and no other salt.   Thank you for a stress free, yummy recipe!

Came out very moist and delicious. Read other reviews and did some changes. Used Lipton herb instead of the onion, added low sodium chicken broth instead water, and used a zesty seasoned salt but less that it called for, and the other ingredients listed. It was a hit, very flavorful.  Used some of the drippings to make gravey, it came out good also.

I made it with chicken broth instead of water. It was wonderful, made stuffing to go with it, and served it with cranberry sauce...

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was awesome!  Never had turkey with such flavor, tenderness, and it was not at all dry.

This is the best way in my opinion to eat turkey.  I did find out that a turkey breast witha bone in it was not as good and I also cut down the cooking time for a small breast.  You also should not take the lid off at all.  I did not add water and it was still moist.

I have made this for years without the onion soup using a bone in turkey breast. It always works well and produces a very moist breast.  Particularly great in the summer when you don't want to hear up your kitchen but are craving turkey!  Or when you are having a crowd and want to have meat for turkey sandwiches. Just make sure the Souza you buy will fit in your crockpot!

This was super good!  I had a smaller breast so we only used one packet of onion soup; everything else the same. 
YUMMY.
