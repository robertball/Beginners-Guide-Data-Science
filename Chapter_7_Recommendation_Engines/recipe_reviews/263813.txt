I had a huge craving for a traditional tuna casserole. This worked perfectly. If I make it again I will definitely add lots more cheese to the sauce and use half & half instead of milk. It could stand to be a lot creamier.

Since reviews said it was bland, I cut up onion and minced 1 large clove garlic and added it to the hot white sauce.  Then added a little Italian seasonings and parsley.  I baked it for 15 to 20 minutes. It was good and would make again.
Since I am dairy intolerant,  I used parmesan cheese (it is ok) in the sauce and added cheese to my husbands side of the casserole.  Then instead of bread crumbs I had a bag of crispy onions and we put that on top.  I know I changed it but it was the only one that allowed me to not use cream of chicken or mushroom soup. I used Almond milk.

This was good! Could use a little more cheese in the sauce and top. Otherwise this is a great recipe!

Its nice to find a tuna casserole recipe that doesn't have cream of something soup! Due to gluten intolerance, I omitted the flour,and used xanthan gum to thicken and gluten free pasta.I added shredded zucchini for texture and nutritional oomph! I left out the crumb topping for white cheeder cheese topping and baked  the casserole until bumbling and delicious!
Thank you for posting as a substitute for retro recipe lovers like myself who can easily tweek. :D

I added peas, mushrooms & 1 can of cream of mushroom soup since the first time I made this dish. It was too bland and dry.   I also decreased the amount of parmesan cheese to  1 cup and mixed in Panko bread crumbs for a little crunch.  My doctored up version was delicious and had just the right amount of moisture.

Very good! Next time I would add some sauteed veges, but it was definitely a repeat!

Nope. I was looking forward to this. Funky texture. Not great flavor. Won't try it again.

We felt this was a little lacking in flavor.  This just doesn't surpass the old Campbell Soups Tuna casserole.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was pretty good. I followed the recipe exactly and it was very filling. Thank you for sharing. I think the only thing I would change next time is maybe spice it up because it was a little bland. But, in all, it is a wonderful base recipe.

The Only Ingredient I ommitted was The Mustard Powder. I didn't have it. It was Still Delicious and Super Easy to Make ! Served with a Salad and Applesauce on The Side. It was Great !
