This was a simple and tasty recipe. I first sauteed the onions, then added the veggies (zucchini, tomatoes, green and red peppers), once done I set aside. Then I sauteed chicken sausage, and added to the veggies and served over whole wheat penne. Fresh chopped basil and some parmesan gives a really nice flavor to this dish.

I was worried that this would be dry, but was very pleased with the end result. Absolutely delicious! I used Mozzarella & Roasted Garlic Chicken Sausage and will definitely make this again. Thanks for a great easy recipe!

This is so quick, easy & good. Since some reviewers said it was too dry, I combined the powdered chicken bouillon with about a 1/2 cup of water & added a tablespoon or so of corn starch.  I added it to the sauted vegis & sausage and heated it till it thickened.  Then added the spaghetti.

I've made this several times over the years. I use lite Polish Kielbasa and substitute spaghetti squash for the spaghetti. It's always turned out great.

Nice light dinner. I didn't have a red bell pepper so I used green, I didn't have onion so I used green onion - lots of green in this dish!! This was good but it was a little dry. Thanks for the new way to use sausage - I used cheese sausage.

I used turkey sausage for this recipe.  My kids liked this one, but my husband and I really loved it.  It had just the right amount of spice, and the zucchini and pepper went very well with the sausage.  This would also be very good served over rice instead of pasta.  Will be repeated often!
