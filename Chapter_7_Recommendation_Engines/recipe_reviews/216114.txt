This was really good. Used the basic idea and added my own twist. I used dried minced onion instead of fresh, and entire can of cream of chicken soup, left out the sherry, and placed my turkey piece on top of the sauce. I seasoned the turkey with salt and garlic and poultry seasoning, and roasted it uncovered. Super delish, and made a fantastic gravy.

My rules of thumb for cooking are to use what I have and to experiment.  Substituted brandy for sherry and lemon pepper seasoning for poultry seasoning, then cut out the mushrooms (husband hates them).  Then I added a can of tomatoes for some extra moisture and texture as well as some leftover cooked broccoli normandy.  Served with rice as suggested.  (I always add a bit of bouillon to the water when cooking rice.) I checked on the turkey every ten minutes, to flip it and stir all the additional vegetables.  This must have resulted in a lot of heat loss, because it took far longer to reach 165 degrees (over an hour) than the recipe said. Turned out deliciously -- very flavorful!

Just made this tonight. Delicious! The only thing different I did was to substitute the the cream of chicken soup with a cream soup base recipe of Nell Marshes that I got from this site. Will definitely be making this again very soon!

I didn't have any cream of chicken soup mix. So I chopped up half an onion and a stalk of celery and sauteed them in a butter/olive oil mix until they were tender, then added 2-3 T flour, added ~3 cups (total) of chicken stock, salt, pepper, a bay leaf, a dash of thyme, and ~1/4 C sherry. Then I let it sit until the turkey thighs were brown and poured it over. It's delicious!

I also modified this recipe by omitting mushrooms and soup. I added a can of diced tomatoes instead. Like the previous reviewer I substituted brandy for sherry. It turned out delish!

Delicious!  Added extra garlic and had 1/2 amount of mushrooms.  Next time I'll use entire amount as they were really good in brown sauce.  Took about 20 minutes longer to cook thighs because they were pretty big.  I'm going to try this recipe with chicken next time and make pasta as a side dish.  Tasted almost "marsala" like.  Huge hit at our house.  It's a keeper; going into the recipe box!!!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I made mine in the crock pot and they came out just fabulous.  I will be making them all year 'round.

I needed a turkey thigh recipie asap so I used this a guide but used "go with what you have on hand" approach also. Used cream of mushroom soup since I didn't have mushrooms and red wine since I didn't have sherry. Add some Thyme and Sage and extra garlic. Turned out great. I'll try with chicken also.

I made it just as printed but I put in the whole can of soup, skipped the garlic and used turkey broth (turkey bouillon -- the paste kind you dilute).  It was so delicious and our company loved it!  I will definitely make this one a lot!  Thank you, Elizabeth!  I served it with kale and the flavors together were so good!

Had no sherry, never have sherry, skipped the sherry. Made the cream of chicken soup with butter, flour,  bouillon, milk, and water. Big whoop, wanna fight about it? Delicious.

After deciding to buy and cut up a whole turkey, I was looking for a recipe for cooking the thighs and found this one. I followed the instructions, however I decided to put everything into a Slow Cooker. It turned out great. I cooked it on low for 5 hours. I'll definitely make this again. Lady D

A great saute dish for a Friday night. Don't worry if you don't have every single ingredient. I subbed more flour and chicken stock and cream for the lack of cream of chicken soup (which most home chefs do not have on stock- for obvious reasons)...more fresh garlic for lack of garlic powder. And it was quite lovely. All the needed components are here and we thank the chef for the framework she provided for a meal we can all be proud to serve to our families.

Sauce was delicious! Added white wine instead of sherry (had none). Turkey thighs, however, did not cook well. Possibly they should have cooked longer but hubby was hungry! Will try again!

My husband absolutely loved this recipe.  He ate the leftovers the next day for lunch.  I changed it up a bit using chicken thighs.  Came out great!

the first two times i made this it was great.  the only thing different that i did was to debone the thighs and cut them in half before cooking.  and since i didn't have a can of cream of chicken, i used cornstarch and chicken bullion with a little bit of water.

this time, however, i tried using a 14" carbon steel wok.  I do not recommend a carbon steel wok for cooking this dish.

This recipe seemed so perfect after reading it that I decided for once to just make it as written and not make any changes. It was absolutely fabulous! The sauce was to die for!! I highly recommend that you double the sauce if you want to serve it over mashed potatoes or as I did on rice. This will go into my weekly rotation it was that good. I will also make this with chicken thighs.

I will definitely make it again. I tweeked a few things. Our family are not oregano fans so I left that out, added a little kick (cayenne) and a few little subtle things. That was one of the initial attractions to the recipe that I had. The ability to make it yours. It was really really good. Thanks

This was easy to make.  The results were tasty.  I omitted the oregano because we don't like it.  I substituted the sherry with white zinfandel and it worked well.

Made this for the second time on Christmas day.  After searing meat and browning veg I finished in crockpot.  I did add some roasted garlic to veg plus a little thyme for the mushrooms and used homedmade turkey stock in place of chicken - what I had.  Just as great second time.  Have some sauce left and think will use as base for turkey salisbury steak - sounds good right.

Really good, and the gravy would be good on potatoes.
