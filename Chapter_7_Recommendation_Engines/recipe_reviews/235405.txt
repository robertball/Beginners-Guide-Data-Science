4.22.16 Whoa way too sweet for us (could be personal taste preference). In the future I'll cut the sugar in half to start with and add more if necessary as it cooks. Also this was a ton of sauce for not enough meat. I think you could at a minimum use 1-1/2 lb stew beef for this recipe. The meat was tender and the sauce thickened to the perfect consistency. The beef flavor definitely infused the sweet-sour sauce in a good way! I added some sliced bell pepper onion and fresh pineapple chunks to the slow cooker 30 minutes before serving and they were cooked but not mushy. We liked this recipe and with adjusting the sugar and adding more meat this definitely is a good slow cooker meal!

We enjoyed this dish quite a bit! I did reduce the liquid part. I used 1 1/2 cups water 1/2 cup white vinegar 4 Tbsp soy sauce 2 Tbsp brown sugar and 2 Tbsp cornstarch. This was really the perfect amount of liquid for only 1 pound of stew meat. I browned the meat in olive oil and seasoned it with seasoned salt pepper and garlic powder. We served over egg noodles. I would certainly make it again!

I made this for my family the other night and they liked it. I would like to try it with some other kind of meat.
