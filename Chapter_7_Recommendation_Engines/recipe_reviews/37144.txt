I made this recipe for a holiday dinner with friends. Everyone raved about it. Light, not too sweet, and really different. I was able to put the salad together quickly by using real bacon bits. I also used raspberry preserves without added sugar. Presentation was so festive. This is a holiday keeper.

This salad is delicious and looks lovely!  For a different twist, add some toasted almonds.  May sound strange, but I also added some crubled blue cheese, which totally worked.

I served this as the first course for New Years Eve dinner party. It's so pretty. You either like this kind of salad or not. Those who do loved this, and even the guest that don't care for this sort of thing did eat a little. I used red pears and kept the skins on for color. I used low-sugar raspberry preserves and light sour cream. I added a little water to the dressing since it was thick. I also sprinkled store bought glazed pecans on top with the fresh raspberries and BB bits. I did not add any cheese, and we didn't miss it. I made them all ahead on thier plates & kept in the frige til served. Then I just drizzled the dressing on top. Easy, pretty and just like a fine restaurant. Thanks for sharing.

Not a Huge Hit.  I made way too much and ended up throwing most of it out.  We had other choices in that it was a buffet situation - but it was not very popular.  Good in small doses.

This salad tastes great and presents beautifully.  This could be considered a "fancy salad," since it's perfect for a nice dinner party.
