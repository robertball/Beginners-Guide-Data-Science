Fantastic recipe!  Since I was curious, the second time I cooked this, I only used two large foil pouches, rather than 9 little ones.  It worked great!  I made the pieces of foil the same length as the width of the foil, to make large squares.  I just had two bundles, each composed of two sheets for the top and two for the bottom.  Laid out the chicken in a single layer, had each of the foil packets on their own cookie sheet.  Worked really well, didn't notice any difference.

I'm not sure how I found this, but needed a quick recipe for thighs.  I added a tiny bit of rice vinegar and no sugar..no cilantro (didn't have any)no Kikkoman, used another kind.  Result?  my husband said, mid bite: 'what kind of chicken is this?" me: "thighs" he: "this is the BEST I've ever eaten" .  He's 62 and I'm a cook....so easy it's ridiculous and no mess, baked in foil! YEAH !!  try this you'll love it.

Absolutely awesome! I didn't even use all the ingredients because I only had soy sauce and cornstarch and I used garlic powder. And it still turned out. I can't wait till I use all ingredients and also my husband said it was the best I ever made.

As far as I'm concerned, there is no substitution for Hoisin sauce, you either have it or you don't. It is usually made with soybean paste, sesame oil, garlic, vinegar, molasses, and sometimes chilli and other spices. It's a tad sweet and salty. Easy to find in an asian market or grocery store (for A LOT cheaper, too).

Not sure who tried to sub peanut butter, but ya... lol Definitely cannot fault the recipe on that one.

Goes very very well with chopped green onion. I had this with sauteed shiitake mushrooms over rice. Added cayenne pepper for heat. I left the cornstarch out entirely and did not miss it. The hoisin sauce I had on hand was really thick as it was, and with the other ingredients it just made more sense to leave it out.  It was thick enough when it sat for a bit anyways. Yum

This is a surprisingly good and surprisingly easy recipe. The only thing I do differently is cook all of the chicken in one big bag. I'd also recommend spraying the bag with cooking spray so it won't stick.

Flavor was great--I almost skipped the cilantro, but I am really glad I didn't!  Only 4 stars because I think that there was too much cornstarch.  Instead of having a  nice gravy-like sauce, it was thick & clumpy.

Good flavor, but I think the recipe might have called for too much cornstarch, as the sauce came out sort of clumpy!  I'll use half the amount next time.  Otherwise, a good mix of flavors.  I used diced chicken breast rather than thighs, but otherwise stuck to the recipe exactly.  Served over white rice... The Hoisin sauce makes all the difference-- Don't leave it out!!

I have made this this twice so far and this sauce is so good !!  I only used 3 tablespoons of corn starch and did not have fresh ginger so I used just shy of a tablespoon of ground ginger. I also did not have fresh cilantro so I used 2 teaspoon of dried. I made this using 4 thin cut chicken breasts cut into cubes.  I Made 2 large foil pouches divided up chicken and then divided up a frozen bag of asian medley frozen veggies (Birds Eye Brand) put them on top of the chicken and baked in oven for about 30 min.  Served it on top of brown rice and it was a really good easy dinner.

Flavor was there and chicken was perfectly tender....but I do believe there is too much cornstarch.  My sauce was very clumpy and I had to add water just before serving.  Would make again, just cut back on the cornstarch.  
thanks for sharing.

Loved this!!!  1st time I made this I left out the cilantro (didn't have any)... I thought the cornstarch might have been a bit much as the sauce tasted a tad grainy... next time I may cut the cornstarch in half but otherwise it's a fantastic recipe!! Thanks!!

This was awesome only things I did different was I didn't cut up the chicken. I just placed them on a lined foil baking sheet and covered it with foil and it turned out perfect I dont like ginger so I didn't add it!!!Plus it was soooooo easy!!I also used 12 chicken piece there was enough sauce to coat them all..

Surprisingly mild flavor even after marinating for 20 hours, but we really enjoyed this chicken.  Way too much cornstarch...definitely cut the amount in half at least.  I'd probably add something to give it a little bit of heat next time...a bit of red pepper flakes should do the trick, but there WILL be a next time.  Thanks!

This was really fabulous!  It was tender and flavorful!  My kids loved it.  I would advise wrapping it in foil way in advance and using it as an appetizer.  We had it with the Kung Pao recipe on this site, cabbage salad and asparagus.  It was a really good meal!

Lightened up the cornstarch alot. The hoisin sauce I used was pretty thick to begin with. Ended up with an amazing flavor and a sweet, gravy-like sauce.

The taste of this chicken was really wonderful, but the texture was a little strange. The chicken is very tender in the packet and the sauce thickens quite a bit around it. It made it a little gooey, but otherwise delicious. I served this over rice and I think it would be great with some stir-fried veggies and toasted cashews!

What a disappointment!  If you follow the recipe (as I did), you will have chicken pieces coated with gelatinous-gloppy goo.  Not appetizing at all.  I have cooked with cornstarch many times, and I knew 1/2 cup was way too much.....but I followed the recipe exactly.  We scraped off the goop and tasted the chicken.  It had a good flavor.  That's about all I can say.  So, be warned to cut way back on the cornstarch.

The taste was good but I must have done something wrong cause the texture of the sauce was like jelly. My kids and hubby ate it up and were fighting over the last few foils though :)

Absolutely DELICIOUS (and I'm picky!)  I did use only a tablespoon-sized scoop of corn starch, based on the other reviews, and finely chopped up the fresh ginger to "about" 2 TBSP, but it was a rough.  I put a little extra minced garlic (we love garlic), and a small amount of extra cilantro, but everything else I pretty much followed to a "T."  Make sure you use boneless skinless thighs and trim the fat before marinading.  Ours were still very large.  This made quite a bit, and used a TON of foil, but in retrospect, I may have tried less foil packs (we did about 8 to make sure it cooked thoroughly).  Make sure you very tightly wrap and seal all edges and corners of the triangle... the sauce thins and leaks, and is difficult to remove from your pan!  Overall, this was a keeper.  Will make it again.  We served with brown jasmine rice & steamed green beans.  YUM!  :)

This was ok, taste very Asian over rice. I didn't have any Hoisin sauce could not find it at the store so I looked up a recipe & made it. I used my magic bullet to  make the sauce. The cilantro is very important to use in this recipe. I used Chicken breast terderloins cut up. Overall this was alright, I doubt I will make this again . at least the clean up was very easy. & you can cook this in a toaster oven instead of heating up your huge oven.

Too much work for an end result that isn't exactly the best chicken I've ever tasted. I cut the cornstarch in half and the "sauce" was still clumpy around the chicken pieces. It has good flavor, but overall I wouldn't make this again.

I wasn't crazy about this, it didn't taste like anything special.  The sauce wasn't really a sauce and sort of congealed around the chicken even though I cut the amount of cornstarch in half.

I was disappointed with this recipe. We made it last night. My husband said it didn't have any flavor. I had to cover it in sweet and sour sauce due to the lack of flavor and sauce. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one was because it was at least edible.

Very good recipe! Not 5 stars, but still very good. 
I used arrowroot instead of the corn starch. Much better alternative, and non-gmo. It was definitely a hit!

Really enjoyed the flavors in this.  I put everything in a pan and just baked it instead of using the foil packets.  I cut down the cornstarch by more than half and it was plenty.  Just use the amount you need to thicken it up.  Quick and easy weeknight dinner!

My family loved it. I didn't use the sugar instead I used a little agave and I added more garlic. Its excellent served over rice. I will make this again.

I was hoping for a lot more flavor. I'm guessing this has something to do with the amount of cornstarch as other reviewers have said. The sauce was definitely grainy. I followed the recipe as is.

I have made this before and was unimpressed, so tonight I dressed it up a little.  I sauteed the diced chicken and removed that from the pan.  Added chopped onions, carrots and green peppers.  Once that had cooked for a couple minutes, I added chopped broccoli.  I added the chicken back to the pan with the veggies.  I had already mixed together the sauce from this recipe (which I doubled and left the cornstarch out of).  I poured the sauce over the top and mixed it with the chicken and veggies.  I then put it in a serving bowl and sprinkled the cilantro on top.  I thought it was delicious, and so did my kids.

Pretty average dish, good flavor, very simple, though I put all the chicken in 1 package. I used only 1T of cornstarch & less cilantro (personal taste). No complaints but not amazing either. Fried rice made a good side dish.

I was so disappointed by this recipe!!  Reviews were great and the ingrediants are all very flavorful, but this dish was somehow lacking in flavor!  I cut the cornstarch in half as other reviews stated and it was still quite gloppy.  Tender? yes, but so what when it's gloppy with no flavor.  very disappointed and not a keeper.

This is amazing and so easy! One of the fastest meals I have ever made after a long day at work. I did only use 1/4 C Cornstarch, 5 thighs(that's how they come in the Costco packages),  Regular Soy sauce, 1 t. ground ginger and no Cilantro. I divided it into 8 Pouches and it was a perfect meal for our family of 4 with steamed rice and broccoli! I did marinate over night and next time will add fresh sliced mushrooms! Update: forgot I was out of foil so I had to improvise, put all in a covered dish and it was still fabulous! And I do add Mushrooms now every time and it is wonderful.

Followed the recipe exactly and this turned out GREAT!  Delicious & moist.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and it was still perfect.  Next time I think that I'll add a little less ginger though & maybe add red & green peppers.  Served with rice and green beans. =)

I've gotten many wonderful recipes from this site, but this was not one of them.  Maybe decreasing the cornstarch as another reviewer pointed out would help.  There was no sauce at all and the flavor was just okay.

The flavours of this recipe are excellent and this is why I gave it 5 stars. However, it is the cooking method that can really mess up this yummy dish. You either have to open your foil to check if your chicken is done which disturbs the cooking process or you risk overcooking it if your oven runs hotter and then you end up with a lumpy mess. I agree with other reviewers that the cornstarch can be cut in half with the same good results. Overall, I would recommend this recipe but I would make sure you baby it and don't let it overcook in the slightest. Thank you for a tasty recipe.

Had to alter some but this was great! Went with 1 tbsp brown sugar, a smidge of fish sauce, added small amount of onion per a reviewer, less cornstarch per reviewers (3 tbsps& next time will be half of that), about 2 tbsp Korean BBQ sauce, very small amount of rice vinegar per a reviewer. So wonderful! The fresh ginger really made the dish.

This is a great dish. I also think it is too much corn starch and also it is important to note to not let it go past the 20 minute cooking time or lower the heat. I thought it was a very quick and easy dish to make. Will certainly make again with less corn starch and more fresh ginger.

Delicious flavor!  I agree with everyone, go light on the cornstarch but DONT skip it.  I added whole mushrooms just because I had them and it added substance. Definitely tastes better with thighs than breasts.  The breast gets dry fast so maybe cook those less time.  I have made it several times but my favorite version is with fish.  JUST DELICIOUS!!!  I usually make a pot of brown rice and just pour the entree over it.

Way too much cornstarch! I would have used about a Tablespoon. Ginger is very strong and I cut it back to a teaspoon only. If I make this again, I will definitely change the amounts.

Wow! This was delicious! I slow cooked some pinto beans that my family wasn't eating so I had to find some way to make them yummy.  I used boneless thighs, cooked at 425 for 40 min. Seasoned the chicken before hand with a little Lawrys Seasoning Salt, paprika and peppercorn for extra flavor. I have some picky eaters in my family and everyone loved it.

I loved this recipe! A lot of reviews get that there was too much corn starch but I think they didn't stir it enough. Luckily I have two little helpers that stirred and stirred and stirred for me until all of the lumps were gone. I served this with rice-a-roni and stuffing (weird buy it was at the request of the helpers) This was a big hit in my house and will definitely be made again!

Very Delicious!  I used 4 extra large bsbc cut into cubes.  Baked in foil pockets @ 400 for 30 minutes.  Only used 1 tablespoon of cornstarch.  The large amount of ginger really gives this a kick.  I made steamed broccoli (which was delicious in the sauce) and friend rice.  Would make 4.5 stars.  I only rated 4 because the ginger was a bit overpowering and as written the cornstarch was an unnecessarily large amount.

The chicken was very moist! I don't think I like the ginger, but over all it was a yummy meal.

My family really liked this, and it was really easy to make. Followed the recipe exactly.
