VERY GOOD! Rich, thick, everything a good cheesecake should be.  I used white splenda instead of brown sugar.

This is an awesome sugar free recipe!!!! I used a little less espresso and sugar free oreos for the curst (scraped out most of the filling). I make this whenever I am dieting and have a sweet tooth and for our Uncle who is diabetic...FOR SURE worth trying!!

This cheesecake is awesome!  Perfect cheesecake consistency.  Made it for my brother's bday and everyone was raving!  I used Sugar Free Oreos for the crust and also left out the mocha powder and squirted some Sugar Free Smuckers Carmel topping on the top and swirled it in before baking.  This recipe is a winner because you can use this as a basic and make all kinds of variations on flavors!  Winner!!!

OMG This is so good.  Everyone I have served it to has wanted the recipe.  The only thing I did different was I used one of those mocha instant coffees instead of espresso.  Thank you Jenn for this recipe.

Unbelievable! One of the best things I have ever tried on Allrecipes. I used two different chocolate graham cracker crusts, and mocha instant coffee instead of espresso. I wasn't sure about "brown sugar substitute" as the only kind I can find is Splenda Brown Sugar BLEND, which would call for half of the 1C if following the normal rules between Splenda and Splenda BLEND. So I compromised and used 1/2C regular Splenda, and 1/4 C of the brown sugar blend. This equals 1C of sweetness. Anyway, that was all I changed, and it came out AMAZING. I can't understand a one star review at all. YUM.

This cheesecake was a BIG hit! My dad found out that he was diabetic back in 1988. He said that this was the BEST SF cheesecake that he has ever had. Now that is a compliment.

Made this for my wife today as it was her birthday. The whole family raved about how good it was. I did have to make a change, however. My wife is allergic to pecans, so I substituted almonds crushed up by hand. Plus, 15 min plus 30 min is too short of a cook time and there is really no way to know this until you cut the cheesecake up. The center was still a bit runny. Next time I'll have to do 15 min plus 45 and see if it sets up better. If not for the cooking time being off, the recipe would've gotten 5 out of 5 stars.

**Edit: 11/2018 No one seems to make the sugar free chocolate oreo-type cookies (for the crust) anymore. At least, *I* couldn't find any, not even online. I had to use regular Oreos this last time.

This cheescake is wonderful, as long as you like coffee. All my friends loved it, my hubby (who doesn't like coffee)didn't care for it. I did not add the pecans because i don't like nuts, and I didn't know where to find a brown sugar substitute so I used Splenda instead. I will definitly make again!!

I made this cheesecake for last night.  It was delicious!  The texture is perfect!  My family is not fond of mocha so I just left out the coffee powder.  I also didn't want to make so much so I halved the recipe (except for the crust) and made it in a deep dish pie pan.  I cooked it on 325 for 40 minutes or so.  I will definitely be making this recipe again!  Thanks!!

I could not find brown sugar substitute so I used a full cup of light brown sugar. Also, I thought that ground espresso would be to much so I used 5 tbs Maxwell house Cafe Mocha Latte and this was a hit! My husband and stepdaughter gobbled this up as quickly as they could. People from work loved it to!

I made this for a baby shower which I was attending.  My aunt requested a sugar free dessert because several diabetic relatives were attending.  It was a big hit!  I do have a few cautions, however.  Brown sugar substitute is half brown sugar and half Splenda/Sweet N Low/whatever brand it is.  So, to call this a sugar free cheesecake is a bit misleading.  I used 1/4 cup Splenda in place of the brown sugar substitute and left out the pecans in case someone was allergic.  I suppose it depends on whether you are looking for low sugar recipes to cut calories or how severe of a diabetic you are cooking for.

It is wonderful.  No one knew it was SF and it allowed the diabetes in the family to enjoy some dessert without the worry.

Excellent!  My nephew couldn't believe anything that good could be sugar free.  I can't have sugar and haven't been able to enjoy cheesecake in 2 years - Highly recommended.  Followed recipe exactly, except used regular, large pie pan.  My spring form has gone missing!

This was ok.  It ended up tasting very coffee flavored.  I was tempted to add more granules because 3 tsp didn't seem like much, glad I didn't.

It needs a little longer in the oven than what was recommended, but I replaced all the espresso with crushed oreos and I replaced the crust with crushed oreos as well to make this a Sugar Free Oreo Cheesecake.  Also, with any sugar free recipe if you use a little bit of lemon juice along with the sugar replacement it completely covers up that strange taste that sugar replacements can leave behind.  Other than a few minor adjustments I had to make, this recipe was fairly good.

Good, but it's missing something.  A nice topping might just finish it off... maybe nuts or a syrup?

Love this recipe.  We have tried it with the Espresso powder, but like it better with 4 Tablespoons of Cocoa instead of the espresso powder for a Chocolate cheese cake.   Thank you so much for this recipe!

My diabetic brother absolutely LOVED this!  It's become a family staple at our Thanksgiving table.  He's not a coffee lover, so I eschewed the expresso beans.  I also drizzled the top of the cheesecake with sugar-free caramel and chocolate syrup and a few of the pecans before baking. Came out Beautifully!

I used  a ready made chocolate graham cracker crust so I had to reduce the recipe by 1/3 to fit the pie crust. I only used 1 teaspoons of reg folgers instant coffee.. Also take into account the cooling time. Let it sit for 1 or 2 hours and then put in fridge for another couple of hours. This is delicious. Thank you!

I made this for our Easter family gather since I signed up to bring desserts and there are a couple diabetics in the family. Even after searching 2 grocery stores I couldn't find some of the ingredients, so I did have to make substitutions- I used standard graham crackers instead of sugar free cookies, and Truvia instead of brown sugar substitute.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written. I also brought a home made blueberry-rhubarb pie and an apple crisp to the event.  Guess what disappeared first? To my surprise, everyone enjoyed this cheesecake. I think I've found our go-to low sugar diabetic friendly dessert option! Thanks Jenn for sharing this recipe!

My dad is diabetic and loves cheese cake. This is a great recipe to compromise with that doesn't affect his blood sugar level too much. It is his only Christmas request!
