Hi all, I am the submitter of this recipe. I have found that increasing the butter to 1/2 cup and the brown sugar to 3/4 cup makes this cake even better. I often mix a TBSP of dark rum and a TBSP of the drained pineapple juice to the sauce for added flavor.  A can of crushed pineapple works well for this recipe also. Kaye

I made this for my CEO's birthday...per his wife, it's his favorite.  I've never made Pineapple Upside Down Cake before so I was attracted to the word "Easy."  Not only was it easy, but it got rave reviews from everyone in the office.  I used the suggested variations (1/2 cup butter, 3/4 cup brown sugar and 1 tablespoon of the drained pineapple juice) and it was perfect.  I'd recommend this 100%!

First off, Kaye Lynn contact Allrecipes and ask them to change your recipe. They are very good about that. Go here: http://allrecipes.com/help/Feedback.aspx Now for my review, as per the authors suggestion I used the 1/2 c. butter, 3/4 cup bwn sugar and 1 Tbsp juice. I did add the sugar and juice to the butter in the pan and melted it till it bubbled then I poured it in my 9" round pan. I also use the " Homemade Biscuit Mix" recipe found here on Allrecipes. This is a simple and delicious recipe, thank you Kaye Lynn!

Very Easy to make!  Much easier than my Mom's old recipe..but I did use her lemon sauce recipe to make warm sauce to drizzle over this.  Sorry for posting so many pictures.  It didn't look like it worked!!

I have to be honest, I liked the topping on this. However, the cake was just really bland. I wish I would have read the submitters review on this about making it sweeter or changing up the topping. I am one to think that most desserts are too sweet, however the cake part didn't hardly seem sweet at all. When first done it was very soft, but by the next day the cake was kind of doughy. I had thought the topping should have been a little more prominent too. Only change I made was using a homemade bisquick type mix. I have used it in many recipes calling for it with great results. I would follow the reviewers advice about increasing the butter and brown sugar and definitely add the nuts, it might add something to the flavor and texture.

Really good!  Increased butter to 1/2 cup and brown sugar to 1/2 cup.  Also added a few tbsp. of the pineapple juice to the butter/brown sugar along with some Penzeys Baking Spice.  Subbed pineapple juice for 1/2 the milk.

Did as another reviewer suggested and up the butter & b. sugar to 1/2 cup plus 2 tbls. b. sugar. I made my own Bisquick mix and used a 9 in. skillet. I also waited to put the cherries in the rings ( I prefer pineapple rings) until the cake was turned out. They look and taste better that way. This makes a lovely old fashioned upside down cake. Very fast & easy to make.

I made this and altered it by making it in my 10"x2" spring form pan. I double the batter part of the recipe. I also placed whole pecans and chopped on the topping. Finally, I drizzled real maple syrup across the top, just a couple of tablespoons.  All said and done very good! The only thing I would say is that the actual cake could be a little tastier. This is probably a result of Bisquick being used, but this could even be altered to make it taste a little better also.  Good stuff!

Very, very moist! And so yummy! I used the ingredients as listed with the exception of 1/4 cup of applesauce instead of the egg (due to allergy). EVERYONE loved this recipe! Thanks so much!

I made this since I had the pineapple and the biscuit mix.  I really like the kind that use a yellow cake mix but I didn't have one so the biscuit mix recipe was it.
Don't really care for the  cake crumb,  the brown sugar didn't caramelize  on the bottom and overall the whole thing was just o.k.

I followed original listed recipe. I used a can of crushed and round pineapple and switched white sugar with Splenda. Cake came out more like a soft biscuit, but it tastes good.

This was a delicious recipe. I used corn tortillas instead of flour. The recipe really came together! I’ve never grilled avocado before, they turned out delicious. My family loved it.

This was perfect! I thought I had a cake mix around but I guess I must have used it.. but I did have a huge box of bisquick! I used all the pineapple juice from the crushed pineapple and used skim milk to make the 1/2 cup of liquid. Then by user error, I put 2 Tablespoons on my bourbon vanilla from Trader Joe’s. I thought it was going to come out weird but it was perfect!

I did revision original submitter made.  Increased butter to 1/3 cup and 3/4 c brown sugar.  Forgiving recipe as I combined two different biscuit mixes because I just had some of each.  Cake turned out very pretty and yummy.

I'm so glad I read the reviews before I made it, otherwise it probably wouldn't get 5 stars. I added another egg, cinnamon and nutmeg, a bit of almond extract (I was out of pecans) and some extra butter and brown sugar at the bottom...this was phenomenal!!

Oh my gosh how easy is this recipe?!?
I had some fresh pineapple left over, so I used that. I did as others suggested and used 2 eggs and I used erythritol in place of the white sugar (used regular brown sugar in the pan).  It was soooo good!!! The cake is very moist and just melts in your mouth. I will definitely make this again & again.

Just a suggestion,  I used Southern Biscuit mix.  Walmart is the only place I have found it.  It doesn't have the typical Bisquick flavor.

I also used 1/4 c pineapple juice and 1/4 c mile.

Wow. This is delicious and soooo easy to make.

My man challenged me to make a pineapple upside down cake. Since I had never made one I picked this recipe because of the word "easy" and it was! I read all the reviews and made changes using more butter and brown sugar and adding the pineapple juice. I used sliced pineapple and put a maraschino cherry in the middle of each and it was SO delicious (and beautiful!) we ate The. Whole. Thing. in one evening!!! I added the pecans which made it wonderful. Will definitely be making this one again - and again - and again ...

[My only glitch was using a 9" metal cake pan with sides not high enough so it started oozing over the edges while cooking. I solved it by putting the cake pan on a foil-lined baking sheet and it came out great.]

A five star recipe I have been eating for years, but never made.  mom came over yesterday with a can of pineapple and said make the cake for your Dad's B-day party so he doesn't see it please.  I asked for the recipe and she started listing ingredients. Please write them down!  So she wrote down the ingredients, but they didn't quite match with the verbal ones. She went home,  so the hunt began.  The only difference was the entire can of pineapple juice and 1/4 cup milk in the cake.  And the recommended increase of butter and brown sugar. The pineapple juice is great!

I made this delicious cake, exactly as the receipe called for, since I had never tried using a biscuit mix for the cake part.  I use only "Pioneer" brand biscuit mix because is consistently better than most commercial mixes, but it said you could use any brand.  I will definitely make it this way again.

I enjoyed making and eating this cake very much. First time effort that was fairly easy, and tasted like it was allot more difficult to make than it was.

I also increased the butter and brown sugar...cut the milk in half and added 1/4 of pineapple juice...it tasted just like my moms used to as a kid...as this has always been my favorite cake....I'm not sure what took me so long to make it...

Modifications: bisquick gluten free mix, stevia for sugar, truvia  brown sugar, pineapple juice for milk. Gluten free absorbs milk (or pineapple juice in my case) like mad and made it more like a  cookie dough

Great recipe. Tasted good and wasn't too dry or too moist.   My only complaint is the pineapples tend to stick to the pan.  Do I need to cool longer before flipping it?  Any suggestions would be helpful.

Texture is very much like a pound cake. My family loved it. This will remain in my collection from here on out as a 'go to' quick and easy dessert.

I thought it was really good.  I added a little more brown sugar, and next time I might add maraschino cherries.

Without a doubt, this is one of the easiest and best tasting recipes for this type of cake. Like others, I increased the butter to 1/2 c. and brown sugar to 3/4 c., and added some of the pineapple and juice to the batter along dash of cinnamon and nutmeg. My family LOVED it!

It was good and easy to make.  Just don't let it sit around too long or it gets mushy.  This is one that needs to be eaten same day.

Was easy to make had all the ingredients in pantry, and was first time I ever made a pineapple upside down cake. Came out very flavorful and moist. I did up the butter to 1/2 cup, brown sugar to 3/4 cup, and added 3 tablespoons of pineapple juice and 3 rings of pineapple crushed and drained into batter.

I'm already on my second slice this is an excellent quick recipe I used crushed pineapples and extra butter to give it a nice crust and I added coconut flakes as well. I will surely make this again I used reduced fat bisquick also!

This recipe turned out great even though I used some inferior (really low quality) ingredients. Some cheap baking mix with lumps in it was given to us and it still worked in this!  I used apricot nuts instead of pecans and it turned our great. The apricot nuts gave it a slight amaretto flavor.
