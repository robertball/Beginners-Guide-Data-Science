My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I made a few changes: I sliced the eggplant a little thinner and sauted it and the onions in olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  To add a little more flavor I sprinkled garlic powder on top. Instead of finishing it in the pan, I placed it on toast on a baking sheet and then put mozzarella cheese on it.  Then I put it in the oven until the cheese melted.  I will definatly make this again!

This was delicious. My family, who are not eggplant lovers ate every last scrap. I did make some changes. I seasoned the eggplant with garlic, salt and pepper while frying in extra virgin olive oil, then removed to a cookie sheet and topped with flavored bread crumb, onion, a slice of tomato and cheese. I heated this in a 350 oven until the cheese melted. This will definitely become a regular.

I made this as a side dish, but it could easily be a main course.  It was so delicious!  I used this recipe as a base and followed the suggestions of other reviewers.  These were my changes: I seasoned the eggplant with salt, pepper, and granulated garlic.  I topped with the onions, then parmesan cheese.  This was topped with tomato, then cheese.  I didn't have enough tomato for all the eggplant slices, and in tasting the finished product, the tomato slices were a WORLD better than the ones with no tomato.  Also, I only had processed cheese slices; they were creamy, but I think a nice sharp cheddar would have been better.  This will be a great summer staple!

Delicious!!! Very easy and great.  I made this recipe healthy by not frying the eggplant and onions, but just sauteing them in PAM.  Another thing I did to make this healthier was I put fat-free cheese instead of regular cheese.  Thanks for the great recipe!

this is not the first time I've made this super easy and delicious eggplant.  this recipe is easy to make your own.  I added a slice of tomato to each eggplant slice,  used provolone and white cheddar and parmesan. then I baked it to melt the cheese and put bacon on top.  yummy

This was just delish!  What a great idea.  I didn't bread mine as others did, and after sautéing the eggplant, I put it in a tart dish, covered with sautéed garlic and red onions and baked at 350 for about 20mins, then covered with extra sharp cheddar, popped it back in the oven until the cheese bubbled.  We loved it and my 3yo even had seconds!

Loved it.  I went with less oil, though I dunked the eggplant slices quickly in Greek dressing, and sprinkled some breadcrumbs mixed with oil on top.  Shook some garlic powder on top.  I served it with leftover rice (fried) and my hubby scraped the bottom of the eggplant dish. Very nice and as an extra benefit -- it is fast as well!

This is an excellent recipe. The only thing I did differently was to peel the eggplant.( My husband says the skin tastes bitter.)Fast, easy & delicious. What more could I ask for? Thanks for sharing.

don't use too much oil - the cheese makes it pretty greasy; don't cook for too long - hard to eat if too soft

This is an easy, basic comfort food, but it could use some spicing up.  Cut your eggplant, lightly salt it, and sit it on papertowels for about 30min. You will be amazed how much water comes out! Otherwise, the eggplant will soak up all the oil like s sponge & and you'll have a bland, mushy mess. This is also true for zucchini, and you could substitute/use a combination of the two.

I enjoyed the recipe but came to comment about how many people had trouble with the eggplant soaking up the oil. Eggplant does that UNLESS you salt it and let it weep first. Just toss it with some salt, and let it sit for an hour or so. Rinse it, pat it dry and proceed with your recipe.

Quick and tasty way to prepare eggplant.

I diced the onions, added tomato sauce and feta.  Turned out well.

Too greasy, the eggplant absorbs oil like a sponge. To keep it from burning (heat was low) I had to keep adding more oil against my desire. However I used olive oil so perhaps veg oil lasts longer. I recommend degreasing each side on a paper towel before you flip. Then sprinkling with garlic powder before you add the cheese.

This was good.  I took someone else's suggestion and sauted garlic and onion together. I also cut my eggplant into chunks and added to garlic and onion and sauted all that together until eggplant was soft. Then put the whole thing into a baking dish and topped with sliced tomato and then cheese.  I put it in the oven for about 5 min.

Thank you so much for this recipe and also all of the reviews with the little tweaks made.  My boyfriend is "chef" material, has the tastebuds to define what spices/ingredients are in a dish, as well as what goes well with what.  Well, he told me to leave a 5 star on this recipe because it was unbelievable and such a surprise!! I did as some suggested and topped with a tomato and cheese (I created a taste test-[2]had shredded sharp cheddar, [3] had provolone and [2] had monterrey pepper jack)  All were delicious and legal for my low carb diet!! BONUS!!

Good Heavens this was good!  I've never been a fan of eggplant, but a friend gave me one from her dad's garden, so I gave this recipe a try.  Olive oil.  I added garlic powder to the seasoning. Added tomato slice on top of onions and also used a 4 cheese blend.  Finished in the broiler instead of the pan.  Absolutely delicious!

This was quite a good recipe- not my all time favorite, but it was really nice for something different. I did follow some of the advice of others. I sauted the eggplant and onions in olive oil(making sure not to cook them down too much), and then I transfered to a sprayed casserole dish topped it with sliced tomatoes, garlic salt, pepper, and oregano, (I also sprayed a little oil on top of the toms)and put it in the oven for abot 7-8 minutes at 400deg to heat the tomatoes through. after the tomatoes were heated I put a generous amount of cheddar cheese on top and broiled it for about 8-9 minutes. I think that part of what made this so good was that all of the vegetables still had just a little bit of firmness to them rather than being a pile of mush.  good stuff!  will make it again!

I gave it 4 stars cuz I had to change it so much.  I only had 2 very small eggplants a lady at work gave me, too small to set anything on.  also I had only smokey cheddar cheese.  The eggplant looked really lonely in the pan, so I fried up a zucchini the same way I did the eggplant, and ended up using olive oil, garlic powder, salt, a bit of pepper, and diced onions.  I mixed everything but the cheese together in the pan, then placed the cheese on top to melt...it didn't melt so I mixed it in too.  It turned out to be a gooey yummy mess!!! I am totally keeping this recipe handy, with my modifications...I am going to try to post a photo as well.

The eggplant took a while to soften and I felt like I had to use a lot of olive oil to make it so that the eggplant didn't burn before getting somewhat soft.  It tasted good in the end but I felt like I was just eating onions, seasoning and cheese.

This recipe was very good. I changed it somewhat by adding mushrooms, and sliced red pepper after the onions and eggplant were pretty well cooked. seasoned it with oregano, and added red wine for a cooking liquid. Substituted parmesan cheese, because that's what I had on hand. I'll definitely make it again. It would probably be good on a baguette or whole wheat bread.

This was super easy and amazingly good.  Even more surprising is that the leftovers were as good or better than the first night.  What fun to find to find a low carb recipe that is so tasty and simple.  Thanks!

This was a fine recipe.  But, as my boyfriend said, "seems to be missing something."  Just not a whole lot of flavor in our opinion.

I loved how this tasted, but I tweaked the recipe by cooking the eggplant rounds a bit in advance of dinner and then placing them in a 13X9 glass pan, covering them with the sauteed onions and sprinkling it with 1/2 cup of mozarrella shreds. I then put it under the broiler for 3 minutes. Very delicious.

Scrumptious recipe, and if there is any left, it is even better the 2nd time, when heated up with more cheese.  I added a slice of tomato on each eggplant slice and baked it at 350 for an hour.  This recipe is a keeper!

I didn't care for this at all.  I made it as written but by the time the eggplant was tender, and before I added the cheese I tasted it for seasoning, but it was VERY bland.  I did sample some of it with the cheese but wasn't much help. I ended up turning it into "Eggplant with Garlic Sauce" here on this site.  Unless you really like eggplant prepared simple then I'd skip this one.

This is a really good vegetarian meal! Like others, I made some changes.. I added 2 large cloves of minced garlic to the last 5 min of sauteing the onion. I seasoned the eggplant with salt and pepper in the pan, then with a sprinkle of parmesan cheese after cooked. I also sliced two tomatoes, and warmed them in the same pan. Topped it all together, and it was awesome! Will definitely make often.

Several of the reviews mentioned the eggplant slices soaking up all the cooking oil.  I avoided this by seasoning the slices, spraying both sides with olive and them baking on aluminum foil (also sprayed with olive oil) in my convection oven, 350 degrees for 30 minutes.  Very tasty.

I made this cause I had a bunch of eggplant in the refrigerator I needed to use. It sounded easy enough, and it was. The disappointment was in the flavor. It was bland.

My husband is not an eggplant lover yet he liked this recipe.  I basically followed the recipe, but used mozzarella cheese I had on hand.  I also ended it by layering eggplant, onion, and cheese and put it in a 350 degree oven for 15 minutes.  Very good!

So I fully admit that I have never cooked eggplant before and probably messed this one up because of user error. The first slices of eggplant I put in the pan soaked up all the oil leaving the pan dry, so I had to add more so they wouldn't burn. Turned out as soggy oil patties. The onions were good though. May take another try to learn how to make this better.

My husband is a vegetarian and I have a horrible time finding easy, quick things to cook for him while still cooking for the rest of us too. I made this for him (sauted with olive oil, crushed garlic, salt and pepper. I added breadcrumbs and cheddar cheese along with the onion slices) and he said it was like dessert, it was so good! I will be adding this to his weekly meals! Thanks for a great, easy recipe!

Not my favorite recipe.  The eggplant was rubbery and didn't have a lot of flavor.  My husband didn't even like it, and he will eat almost anything!

I just made and finished this recipe and let me just say, yum! I am a graduate student that has no free time to make 'real' meals. And this one fit my description of fast and easy. I cut the recipe in half and used much less cheese than it called for. I also added tomatoes and mushrooms. Baked it in the oven after cooking on the stove-top (I also did not use any oil as other reviewers stated) and then layered it on-top of toasted bread when it came out of the oven. Yum!

I enjoyed this recipe, although I tweaked it a bit. I slice the eggplant thin, saute with garlic in coconut oil.I place the slices in a 9x13 dish, sprinkle with a tiny bit of salt, sprinkle with italian bread crumbs, and grate some fresh parmesan and romano cheese. Baked it at 350 for about 10-15 minutes. My kids LOVED this, from my pickiest eater straight down to my 1 yr old. This is a great base recipe.

A bit greasy and not very special. If I'm going through this much trouble, I might as well make eggplant parmesan.

I sliced the eggplant thinner and sprinkled the slices with garlic salt and fresh cracked pepper while I was frying them.  It took a lot more oil than the recipe called for, each batch of eggplant soaked all the oil out of the pan and left it dry.  After sauteeing the eggplant, I topped it with the onions and put some fresh tomato slices under the cheese per other reviewers suggestions.  I wasn't wild about the tomato, but it was my husband's favorite part.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was fabulous!  We had to tweak the directions though. The first slices of eggplant soaked up all the oil so we had to continue to oil the pan and then the cheese wouldn't completely melt so we had to stick them under the broiler for a minute or two.  Other than that it was very very tasty!

Very tasty! I took the advice of other reviewers and added pepper and garlic powder after cooking the eggplant in olive oil. I didn't add any salt since I bled the eggplant with salt (to get rid of bitter juices before cooking it) and never manage to get rid of all the saltiness after that. Also, the cheese is a little salty. The combination of eggplant, onion, and cheese was great. I'm definitely making this again as an easy alternative to my usual red pepper / mozarella eggplant sandwhich.

This recipe was pretty good for something quick and easy.  I just thought that it was a little bland.  To cut the fat I took the advise of another reviewer and used PAM to "fry" the vegetables.  If you use PAM be sure to watch the heat as the eggplant will burn easily.

Wow-my husband loved this recipe. The only change I made was to add crumbed up pieces of bacon to the top along with a thin slice of tomato,before I added the sauteed Onions.yummy! But the recipe is fast and great without additions too.

This is SOOO GOOD!! I always had trouble with the eggplant absorbing too much oil, but after reading advice from DoxieGirl (thanks!) and how the eggplant needs to weep first, I had success! I fried onions and fresh garlic first, set that aside, then I fried the eggplant in a little olive oil and some cooking spray. I finished by layering everything, topping it with mozzarella and in the oven at 350 for 15 mins. So Yummy!

Delicious! I changed it up a bit by adding jalapenos (I love heat) and various color bell peppers. No salt and pepper needed this way.

Since this was a side to chicken parmesan (italian) I used mozzarella cheese instead and it was superb!!

4 stars only because I swapped Cheddar with Gruyere, and additionally seasoned with basil and garlic, then topped with parsley before serving.

This was pretty good, though may have been too bland for my taste  if I hadn't made some adjustments. I added garlic, breadcrumbs, and sliced tomatoes.

Placed on toast as another suggested, then added an egg and thin slice of ham. Awesome breakfast open face style .  My husband loved it.

It needed some more spice.  I used chili powder.  I substituted leeks for onions, because that's what I had to use up.  My husband liked this recipe.  I agree with slicing the eggplant a little thinner.

It was just ok. I added curry spice to the eggplant while cooking. I also broiled the onion eggplant layers after topping with Havarti cheese. Finally, I served it with garlic mashed potatoes. Ok.

Loved this!  I used this recipe as just an idea-sauteed garlic, vidalia onion and bite sized, peeled eggplant in olive oil.  Poured over bread crusts (I save in the freezer all the kid-refused home-made bread crust), then topped with thick juicy tomato slices.  Last, shredded sharp white cheddar cheese.  We served it with parmesan.  SO delicious that I am having trouble not going back for seconds right this minute!
