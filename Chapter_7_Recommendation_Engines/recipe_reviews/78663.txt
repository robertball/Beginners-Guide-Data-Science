I give this five stars mainly because I have a hard time finding sweet potato side dishes that don't taste more like a dessert. I persoanlly like them about any way you can prepare them, but my husband does not like all the sugar and nuts that many recipes add. How happy was he to see BACON as a topping instead! ;)  I did not have light cream on hand, so I just combined some milk and meleted butter as a substitute and for the cream. I also used 6 sweet potatoes instead of 4. It turned out great.  Thank you so much for giving us a sweet potato recipe that leans more toward the savory side. It was a nice new twist to my traditional Thanksgiving meal!

I liked this so much... I cooked half an onion in my leftover bacon grease and combined it with the crumbled bacon to top... then I just added a couple tablespoons of the bacon grease and a little milk to get the right consistency since I didn't have time to bake so long.  the onion-y bacon grease gave it a great flavor!  I also only added the nutmeg since I didn't want to give it too many flavors... so good!

Excellent - Took it to a potluck - it was the first dish gone! Works well when you have diabetic guests or people trying to avoid sugar.

Didn't like, sorry. Needed more flavor. Maybe sauteed onions. My husband and son didn't like it either.

This is a very nice casserole!  We love the sweet, buttery regular SPC, but this is a refreshing change.  I did add sauted onion and garlic (small onion and 1 clove).  I folded it in after processing the rest of the ingredients together.  Thanks for the recipe :)

Yum! I didn't add the milk because I felt like my sweet potatoes were plenty loose after adding the cream (this is going to vary depending on how large your potatoes are). I'd like to play with this recipe by adding some more savory elements, possibly onion and garlic, but we really enjoyed it as written tonight. Thanks!

Very nice change from the too sweet, sweet potatoes.  Easy to do.  Even grandchildren like this!

I loved this dish. I put my sweet potatoes (5 large)through a ricer after being cooked to get a nice fine texture instead of using a blender or food processor. I also used fat free half and half and added some of the crumbled bacon in the mix. I thought the spices were spot on....not to spicy...just hinted and that complimented well with the smokey bacon (I used almost a full pound of bacon in total) which I also added to the top of the casserole. Thanks!

It’s a challenge to make interesting sweet potato sides that don’t have added sugars.  I baked the sweet potatoes, used only used 1/3 cup milk and no cream and opted to sauté some diced onion in the bacon fat to add to the crispy bacon topping. We all thought this dish was delicious! Thanks!

I've never liked sweet potatoes But I saw this with bacon and knew everyone would like it as it was different. My family likes the sweetness of other recipes but I enjoy the savory. What I did do is cook my bacon in a cast iron skillet with maple syrup. I let it get nice and crispy. Then I added some sautéed onions on top along with the maple bacon......of course I made extra bacon!!! Everyone seemed to love it. Thanks!!

I just made this and was thrilled with the result.  It was flavorful with the cinnamon and nutmeg and surprisingly sweet since I had never eaten sweet potatoes or casserole without brown sugar or maple syrup!  I did use the bacon grease to sauté onions, which were a good addition. I also did not have cream so I substituted the milk/butter mixture.  I used pretty big sweet potatoes and the consistency was great even though I could not imagine that with no eggs in the recipe. The recipe is simple with very few ingredients, which is always a plus.  I will definitely make this again many times.

Three changes, doubled the recipe, added 1/2 tsp. of ground cloves, and baked at 350 instead of 325.  Worked out great!

Made this during Christmas and it was a hit! This was literally so delicious I couldn't stop stuffing my face.  I was initially worried that the spices would give it a dessert feeling but it was a perfect balance of savoury and a hint of sweetness.

We had to adjust the seasonings and add brown sugar to add flavor.  It was just too bland without.  We also added marshmallows the last 5 minutes for our traditional thanksgiving sweet potatoes.

Like others, I did this as a change from the sugary SPCs.  Thanksgiving 2011, it was a hit with the family.  I followed the recipe exactly.  So, encore time for 2012 Thanksgiving.  Thanks, Laurie!
