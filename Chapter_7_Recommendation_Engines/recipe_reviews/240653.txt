Very good! One of several treats I put together as Christmas gifts  this year. I remembered my mom always made these around Christmas so when I saw this recipe I had to try it out. They tasted so good and they're really easy to make. No baking involved! I used my Magic Bullet to chop up the dates and nuts so it was super quick.

About 5 minutes into cooking the sugar and dates (on medium heat) I got worried, but was determined to follow the recipe. At 9 minutes i thought "this can't be right, it is going to be like toffee", and took it off the burner and stirred the other ingredients in. Tasted great while hot, but when I rolled it into balls and they cooled they became too hard to even bite into. It took serious boiling of water, vinegar and baking soda to get the cooled mess off my pan!  Joyce do you really cook this for 10-15 minutes?
