You have to love lentils to really like this recipe.  I took it to a barbeque tonight for a vegetarian friend and got lots of compliments on it.  It is excellent either at room temperature or cold, right from the refrigerator.  Thank you for a very good recipe.  Will make this again.

i made this for a pinic which had a very broad spectrum of goers, and had none of the salad left to bring home so it was definatly a hit. i did add a bit of sea salt and some red wine vinegar because it was a bit bland tasting. will be making this again, possibly with the addition of cucumber and feta cheese to help kick up the flavor.

This salad is just okay, kinda bland.  It's missing something, but I couldn't figure out what.

Did I read 2 cups of chopped green olives?? I only added 1 cup but I hand picked most of it out, and I love green olives! I give this recipe 3 stars because I think it has potential (if you are a big lentil fan.)I will try it again using 1/2 cup green olives and maybe 1/2 cup sliced black olives for color and taste contrast.

Like other reviewers, I modified the base recipe a bit, addding cilantro, black olives (in addition to the green ones) and a diced cucumber.  I also substituted (half) a red onion for the called-for white onion.  The recipe seems to be widely variable...I was thinking some peanuts, cashews, or pistachios thrown in might be good next time.  The salad only improves with age, by the way!! Yium!

I really liked this recipe - it's so quick and easy to prepare!
I added some celery and grated carrot which added some variety and extra colour!

This was the first time I cooked with lentils (which is odd because I love them!).  This salad was nice and different.  I halved the recipe and it still made a large amount.  I cut the olives down by 1/4 and it was plenty salty/tangy.  I added Feta cheese on top. My hubby really liked this salad too!

Great basic recipe. I went with the other reviewers additions, plus more. I love onions, so I put a generous amount of that, fresh cilantro, red bell peppers, cucumbers, chopped jalapenos from a jar and chipolte Tabasco sauce. Yummy! Yummy!!!

This is a pretty tasty salad with the addition of 1 tsp cilantro.  I added paprika first to zip it up, but that didn't cut it.  I then added the cilantro, which helped immensely.  I also cut the green olives back to 1 cup.  I find green olives repulsive and couldn't imagine eating something that tasted mostly like green olives.  I will more than likely make this again.

I found this recipe to be a really good base for a lentil salad, with plenty of room for customization. I added a cucumber as suggested by other reviewers, as well as a package of mixed beans (prepared for salad). I also reduced the amount of green olives.  Fresh parsley would also be a great addition! Tasty and healthy :-)

Its a good start for a recipe.  I made this as is, but after a few tastes, I decided it would benefit from a little red wine vinegar and feta cheese.

Thanks for this recipe.  I used to make the same salad except I used black beans in place of the lentils and used both red and green bell peppers.  I also added salt to taste. I love it and I had misplaced my recipe, so glad to find this one.

after reading the review, I cut down on the olives, added a little garlic, pepper and a touch of sugar.  I did not cook them in salt water.  The olives are salty. I will make this again.  The recipe makes a lot.  I will half it next time.

This is a fresh, tasty salad. I add diced cucumbers, and it is a hit at fellowship dinners.

Could NOT get my boyfriend to eat this after the first bite. He basically hated it. I thought it was fine, but REALLY bland. I may try adding some vinegar, salt, and feta - as another reviewer suggested - to make it a little more tasty and interesting.

I made it and on first taste - I love it.  I added things though - feta, tomatoes, oregano and basil.  I had them on hand and needed to use the tomatoes.

I love this recipe! I used to eat it like it was my last meal! I prefer the taste of the green lentils, I feel they have more flavor-- so those of you who say the recipe doesn't have much flavor, try a different lentil. I also switched out the red bell pepper with a yellow bell pepper, & not only put chopped olives in there, but garnish the top of the salad with whole green olives. The canned green olives are the best! They aren't sour, but almost buttery. This is a great healthy summertime recipe.

I actually consider my tastes pretty broad, but I didn't like this. It's different, but I didn't care for the olives paired with the lentils. Thanks anyway.

I added feta cheese, which in turn probably made it a little less nutritious...  Very tasty!
