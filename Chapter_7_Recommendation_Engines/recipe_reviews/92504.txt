We liked this recipe. It was light for cornbread and my 4 yr old liked it even with the green chiles.  But I omitted the red pepper.

This recipe was a success!  I made it to accompany a super bowl chili.  The corn and chilis provided a wonderful texture.  It's going to be always present in my recipe box.

Tried it with Cornmeal Mix rather than the flour/cornmeal/salt/baking powder portions of the recipe... turned out bad. Slightly dry, not very flavorfull, very crumbly. Could very well be my cornmeal mix,, it was old. Going to try it again strictly following the recipe.
