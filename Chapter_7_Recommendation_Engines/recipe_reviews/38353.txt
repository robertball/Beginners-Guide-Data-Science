If you like cantaloupe, you'll love this!!  I added a tiny bit more sugar because my cantaloupe wasn't as sweet as it could have been...thanks for the recipe, Allissa!

Pretty tasty.  I added a tiny bit of water (I was having a hard time blending it), and some honey.  A great way to used up some cantaloupe!

This is absolutely fantastic!  I just made it for a light dessert... light, refreshing, and really nourishing as well.  This would make a great treat for brunch.   My cantaloupe was perfectly ripe, so this was the perfect amount of sugar.  Fabulous!!

WOW! This is amazing! Tastes like a dessert!  I used Stevia instead of sugar and my family loves it!  I wanted to point out that a half of cantaloupe makes two full glasses so if you are making this for yourself and a friend, use only half the melon.  Will definitely make again and again!

My grandmother-in-law from Mexico first introduced this recipe to us and we have loved it ever since.  For extra flavor we add vanilla which makes it perfect!

Excellent drink for those living in North Texas during the summer. Chill it a bit after mixing it and it's bliss in a glass.

I didn't think there was really anything special about this recipe.... my family thought it was kinda kinda just drinking a cantaloupe kind of like baby food.... if I ever make this again I will try adding some sprite or maybe some strawberries or banana or other fruit... as is though I think I would rather just eat the canaloupe

I had an overripe cantaloupe and figured this recipe was worth a try.  I made only a small portion, but will definitely finish up the rest of the cantaloupe using this recipe.  I added a small amount of lemon juice, but may try some of the other reviewer's suggestions.  I wonder if it would freeze well!?

Very refreshing and tasty.  I added a dash of vanilla extract and used splenda in place of sugar.  The whole family loves the drink.  Thanks for sharing you yummy treat.

I'm not rating this recipe too low because I think the quality of the fruit, not the recipe itself, was at fault.  With that said, however, bear in mind that this recipe is only as good as the cantaloupe you get -- and extra sugar cannot save it.  I had a fairly tasteless melon, and the drink was pretty  bad -- I added sugar, then strawberries and lime juice to try to salvage it, but it was still less than impressive,  I'm not sure that I would try this again even with a good melon.

I don't know what everyone was expecting with just 3 ingredients. I loved it and was very pleased. I'm so glad I tried this especially when I almost didn't because of the bad reviews.

Wasn't too crazy about this. Had to add some mandarin oranges in juice just to get it to blend. The cantaloupe was overpowering. I like a little cantaloupe mixed with other fruit & some yogurt in my smoothies, but not cantaloupe alone.

Very good, but adding sugar kind of defeated my purpose of having a healthy breakfast, so I used vanilla yogurt instead. Had to add a little milk to thin it out, but overall, very refreshing and delicious. Thank you!

I wasn't very impressed with the recipe & neither was my husband.  I give it 3 stars because one of my kids liked it.  I had a wonderfly ripe cantalope.  It was SO strong that I had to add 1 cup frozen vanilla yogurt & 1/2 a banana & I still couldn't drink very much.  I wouldn't make it again.

I loved this drink, I had to add sugar because my cantaloupe was not that sweet.  My son didn't care for it but I didn't think he liked the cantaloupe flavor.....I may try it next time with another kind of melon.

I'm not sure how I feel about this.  Cantaloupe as a drink just tastes weird to me.  I'm tempted to give it a 4 because of health benefits, but I just can't bring myself to do that.  I'll stick to berries and bananas in my smoothies.  If I try cantaloupe again in a drink, it definitely won't be by itself.

This was very good -- I added 1/2 c. of vanilla soy milk and used 3 packets of Splenda instead of sugar. My melon was very ripe, so that was enough sweetener. Next time I might add some more ice because the cantaloupe is slightly too thick.

I came to All Recipes because I was looking for something to do with the under-ripe cantaloupe I inadvertently cut too soon and decided to use this recipe as a starting point. To my VitaMix Blender I added one peeled & quartered orange, one 6 oz container of plain Chobani Greek yogurt, three heaping tablespoons of sugar, a generous (unmeasured) dash of vanilla and gradually added the entire under-ripe cantaloupe that had been cut into chunks. Blended on low, then gradually increased speed to high, blending until mostly smooth. Tasted remarkably similar to a Creamsicle popsicle but wasn't quite cold enough (VitaMix tends to do that due to its high velocity). Poured the mixture into 2 1-quart mason jars & chilled it until after dinner - maybe two hours - and it was a huge success. Normally I wouldn't have used sugar but the mellon's under-ripeness required it. Otherwise it would be a health-conscious treat that tastes like a cheat treat. I will definitely make it again & will serve it to guests at our next function.

So refreshing, I threw my cut up cantaloupe and an ice cube into my bullet and used a little agave nectar instead of sugar, Perfect!  We had already had half of the cantaloupe earlier in the week so this was a perfect little treat to use up the rest of it.

I needed a break from eating fresh fruit and a fast way to use up an entire cantaloupe. It was a small one so it made just two drinks. Good though.

This recipe has 3 TABLESPOONS of sugar.  I don't recommend anyone make it.  I would have given it no stars, if possible.

Just wow! I got 2 very ripe cantaloupe's from my landlord and went searching for recipes and found this one to try out.  I only used half of a melon to start out and will be making more of it.  It tastes great will definitely make this again.

My god, it is to die for!!!   I was looking through smoothies as I just gotten a new blender from a family member, and since I'm pregnant, I crave smoothies galore!  I stumbled across this and realized I still had half a cantelope that I needed to use up.  I made it at 10:15 pm, and let me you tell this, it is so cold, chilled, and 100% delicious!  I will deft. be making more of this!  THanks for this wonderful recipe!

Awesome!! I also made a batch with honeydew instead as I didn't have cantalope and added 6oz vanilla yogurt.
