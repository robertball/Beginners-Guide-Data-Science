This was very good and simple. I did use corn tortillas it tasted just like and authentic restaurant enchilades.  I may add some mexi-rice next time.  It did need something abit more.  And I dressed mine with chopped green onions. and served with a side of sour cream.

This was really good!  I mixed all of the ingredients, and just barely tossed them with the corn tortillas.  I also baked it uncovered.  It wasn't soggy at all, and the family loved it.  Very easy!!

This was really easy to make and very tasty!  You simply MUST add a can of black beans to the mix.  It really adds a lot to the dish.  It's even better if served with tortilla strips or Fritos, and a small dollop of sour cream.  I know it's not as healthy with the extra chips, but it gives it that crunch factor.  Yum!! :)

Actually a pretty decent recipe, and so easy I don't care if it's not gourmet. I've also made this successfully with leftover cooked rice instead of the tortillas, which makes this a great follow-up to a roasted chicken, rice and veggie dinner. Also lends itself to throwing in diced fresh veggies to add some nutrition. My husband called it "grubbin'".

we used flour tortillas, and maybe that is what made the difference, but it was not very good

It IS easy!  I had leftover chicken & corn tortillas, and this was the PERFECT way to use them up.  The only alterations I made were to add a can of beans, and to use mexican cheese, for extra flavor.  I also used the medium heat salsa for the same reason.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because I still think it needs a little more spice.  Next time I will probably add cumin...  I will definitely make this again.  Very quick to assemble & on the table in a snap!  While it was baking I whipped up a nice tossed salad.

This was OK. The only reason I tried it is because I basically had all the ingredients, but It wasn't my favorite.

overall good flavor.  Texture of tortillas may have been better if it cooked without lid on.  Tortillas got pretty mushy.

When I first made this I felt it was missing something.  I added low sodium/drained black beans, and some taco seasoning to the chicken (which I sauted in a pan before adding into the mixture).  I also didn't put the tortillas in the bake as I've read many reviews that they get soggy so I left that out.  I serve this as a dip-type dinner, scooping it out with whole wheat tortilla chips.  I used low sodium tomato soup, store brand salsa, 1/2 cup of skim milk, and reduced fat sargento shredded chedder cheese to make it healthier.  Very good and highly recommend!!! My fiance loves when I make this!

Loved this. So easy. I added a can of black beans as was suggested. I also added some diced onions. I cooked the chicken with some garlic powder. I used mango salsa and added a few tbs of taco sauce. Finally, I added tortilla chips and the remainder of the cheese to the top after 20 minutes.

The taste of this dish was pretty good, but I didn't care for the texture of the tortillas in it.  Just got too mushy.  Next time I will use rice instead and add some more zing to it with some jalapeno.  Also I used sour cream in place of the milk to give it a bit of richness.

this was okay. the tomato soup flavor was really powerful..needed some more "zing"..maybe some spicier salsa or fresh jalepeno...i tried both cooked and un cooked torilla strips..both turned out soggy..like noodles...maybe serve this over a bed of crispy torilla strips?..not much to this..okay in a pinch..not one of our favs..

I was skeptical as I needed to make this a day in advance and not bake it.  I was really worried that it would become soggy.  I baked it uncovered and it was great!!
I didn’t have enough salsa, so I added spaghetti sauce to fill the measurement.  I did add a can of rinsed black beans, some garlic powder, onion powder and cumin.  (I would have added the spices even if I had had all the salsa).  Making it again tonight!

This taste great! I made the mistake by using water, cause i was all out of milk. it was not as good tasting as when made with milk. also it looked to be dry, so i added maybe 1/4 c. of more water, which was also a mistake. 

So be use to follow the directions exactly! and it will be great.

My whole family loved this. It took a bit for 2 of my kids to warm up to it - but after a few bites, they kept on eating. I used flour tortillas and I used 4 of the large ones and it turned out great. Nice and soft.  Also, used a can of turkey chunks because I had it (ended up being less than 2 cups) and a little extra cheese. Also, my tomato soup is only 10 oz cans....

I made this recently with the corn tortillas. It has to be one of the easiest, tastiest recipes out and a boon if you are short of time.  I shall certainly be making it again.  I cooked it uncovered and it wasn't at all soggy.  If anything it was a bit on the dry side, so next time I'll add a bit more milk or, perhaps, yoghurt.

I had to tweak this to fit in with my vegetarian diet and it was very good. The only thing I really changed was using Morning Star Farms Chicken Strips instead of real chicken.

Everyone liked this in my family. I used ground beef because that's what I had. I browned it with onions. I added chili beans (again, what I had) and baked in a 9x13 pan. I put sour cream on the table, some used, some did not.

Pretty good and fast to make. I make it a bit less fattening by making it with skim milk, reduced fat cheese, and wheat tortillas. My husband enjoyed!

Very easy.  I bought a roasted chicken the other day and wanted something to put cooked chicken in, so I tried this since I had everything on hand except corn tortillas.  I had flour tortillas--the larger ones--so I used four of them.  Turned out well.  Tastes like an enchilada casserole.  Thanks for sharing.
