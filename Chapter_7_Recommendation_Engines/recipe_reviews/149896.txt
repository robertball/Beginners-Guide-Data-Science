In case you're wondering, Samhain (pronounced Sow-en) is a high holiday for Pagans and is known as Halloween to most everyone.  As for the recipe, it rocks! Very moist and just really flavorful; I didn't have to tweak it at all.  I took it to a potluck celebration and it went over very well. Thanks!

I made a few small changes, just to make it a little healthier. I used whole wheat white flour, cut the sugar by half, used homemade organic pumpkin mash, brewed/cooled chai tea instead of water and melted butter instead of oil. (Low on oil right now.) At the last minute, I added one cup of Hershey's cinnamon chips. I got 18 muffins out of one recipe, medium sized. 350* for 18 minutes was just right baking time. The flavor of these muffins is wonderful, made even better by the addition of cinnamon chips. And the smell while baking? Amazing.

Awesome! Coven kids were all over it! Stole one whole loaf before we caught them, and they are picky eaters. Definitely a keeper! With the amount of fertility magick in here, too, it would be great for Beltane, substitute apple puree for love and fertility and apple pie spices instead.

Only small change: I used 1 C. white sugar and 1/2 C. brown. Bread doesn't rise much, and was done in about 45 min. Great flavor!

I LOVE this bread! Have made this several times now and it's been perfect every time. My only modification was skipping the cloves and adding more cinnamon, because I didn't have any cloves around. I found the recipe as written was just right for one 9x5 loaf.

I have no idea what Samhaine means... but.. very good pumpkin bread. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was that the top was sticky (and I just so happen to like a crunchy top). Would make again.

I used frozen pumpkin puree but didn't quite have enough so I substituted mashed banana.  I also used 3/4c white flour, 3/4 c whole wheat flour, 1/4c wheat bran and 1/4c oat bran (extra dry ingredients to account for the moisture in the pumpkin).  Some recipes don't do well with flour substitutions, but this one is great!  My family loves it!

This is the best pumpkin bread I've ever had! My kids were all over this. I doubled the recipe for two gigantisaurus loaves. Perfect for Samhain, perfect for Yule also! Yummy!

Perfect!  I made this at the last minute for a Halloween party.  In hopes of cutting down on cooking time and making it easier to serve, i baked in a 9X13 pan.  They came out like pumpkin brownies.  No major changes...omitted clove, used baking powder instead of soda, flour was half wheat half regular, sugar was half brown half regular.  It was gobbled up!

I loved that this didn't pour on the oil.  Only had half the amount of nutmeg so added a smidge more allspice.  To make for easier carb counting (diabetic in the family) I made this into 18 muffins @ about 1/4 cup batter per muffin and approximately 29 carbs (rounded up to the nearest carb), set the timer for 18-20 minutes and used the toothpick test.  Love the spice mix as I am usually having to add extra spices to pumpkin bread recipies.  Burned my fingertips sampling the too hot muffins and before it was done steaming, the flavor was amazing. This will be my go-to recipe for quick pumpkin muffins.  Can't wait to make as loaves when I have more time available to bake!

Made this last night and SO happy I did! It's the best flavored, perfectly moist bread I have made to date. Made 2 loaves, (omitted the nuts because it's not my thing) and my family of 5 devoured it - only half of a loaf left 12 hours later. I love that it's not full of veg oil or butter - perfectly perfect. Will be making mini loaves or perhaps muffins to put in my holiday baking baskets for family and friends!

This came out really nice and moist.  I reduced the sugar slightly and added a little more flour (because I live at high altitude).

This bread is wonderful. I put half the batter into a loaf pan. To the other half, I added plumped golden raisins and made muffins. Now I have the perfect eat in the car breakfast.

Very yummy!  I read the other reviews and substituted brown sugar for 1/2 cup of the white sugar called for.  I also used some cranberry juice I had on hand in place of the water in the recipe, and added some dried cranberries to the nuts in the final step.  The result was a wonderful sweet dense bread with a touch of tanginess.  I didn't really taste the spices as much as I hoped to - next time I'll increase the amounts.

I was dog sitting at a friend's house and didn't have all purpose flour or vegetable oil, so I substituted with whole wheat flour (25% less than all purpose, so about 1 1/3 c) and 1/4 c applesauce. I added raisins instead of walnuts. I was very pleased with the results, except that I should have used smaller loaf pans.

Love this recipe and followed it almost to a T, I omitted the nuts as I have issues with walnuts.  I think I would rather have one loaf in a larger bread pan than two smaller ones since it doesn't rise much.  I loved that it didn't require a mixer, only a whisk.  It smelled wonderful baking.

Tried this last night. Doubled the recipe because we had that much pumpkin. Out of allspice, so used a little extra cinnamon and clove, added a dash of ginger. The bread took longer to cook than 60 minutes. One reviewer said in a 9x13 pan they turned out like brownies. There is nothing brownie like about them. The muffins went to work, and disappeared. I had no problem with it rising. Definitely going to make this again.

Cleaning out my cabinet I found some canned pumpkin & decided to try this recipe. It's really easy to make, tastes great and makes a nice "not to sweet" dessert. I used 1 cup all purpose flour and 3/4 bran flour. I made one loaf without nuts & the 2nd with pecans (out of walnuts). This will be a go to recipe!

Made a loaf AND 12 muffins/cupcakes. Didn't have allspice; subbed ginger. Didn't have walnuts, subbed toasted pecan pieces. Also added bittersweet chocolate chunks, just 2 ounces so as not to overpower the pumpkin or spices. I DIE! So good.

delicious! I made this with butter instead of oil, and split the white sugar with brown. Great color, shape, and taste.

I made 2 changes, used 1/2 cup walnut oil (expensive) and 1/2 cup canola oil plus reduced the white sugar to 1 cup, loved it - baked within the time listed - had never ground my own coriander before - wow smells so good - did toast the walnuts - have added this recipe to my favorites

This has been a hit with my whole family. I made two loaves for Thanksgiving and they quickly disappeared. Very delicious and pretty easy to put together.

This is the first pumpkin bread recipe I tried and there is no need to try any other recipe. This bread is delicious! I used rice flour to make it gluten free for my mom. I agree with others that it doesn't rise much but I'm using this for pumpkin mushroom stuffing so it's ok.  I will try just one loaf pan next time.

An excellent pumpkin bread, I wouldn't change any of the ingredients.
My main concern was the finished size. Using the correct sized loaf pans yielded 2 very shallow loaves. In the future I will make just 1 loaf and bake it somewhat longer.
Thank you for a great recipe.

I made this pumpkin bread for a luncheon with my girlfriends. It was a hit! It was delicious and moist. And it was incredibly easy to make. I will be making this again for Thanksgiving.

As another reviewer suggested, this would make awesome muffins! I used half white flour and half white whole wheat., I  added fresh cranberries. I would like to find a way to make it rise more; perhaps some buttermilk or soured milk to react with the baking soda?

Tastes wonderful and filled my apartment with the most mouth-watering aroma! I added a 1/2 cup of pecans to the recipe and poured the batter into muffin tins instead of loaf pans.  Cooked them for about 20 minutes. It came out great! 
10/10 would cook again

Best quick bread ever. I've been making this bread for a long time. It's my go to fall fav. Super rich and TONS of flavor. You don't need to make any changes. It's forgiving if you aren't paying attention to your measurements. I just dump it all in a bowl and pop in the oven. Perfect every single time. Works great as muffins too.

Delicious, rich, moist! The recipe is perfect as is! I've made this many times but used nuts for the first time today since I had leftover Pecans and now I regret not adding it before. I halved my whole pecans with my hands which I prefer to smaller chopped pieces. MODIFICATIONS made based on what I had on hand: No allspice but upped the other spices just a smidge. 1 cup of halved pecans instead of 1/2 cups chopped walnuts.

I followed the recipe exactly.  The loaves are small compared to other pumpkin bread recipes - each loaf was only about half the height of the 9x5 pan.  Size was disappointing.

Used a few pieces of dried fruit and some roasted seeds instead of nuts, for the non-nut lovers in our family. And, the scent wafting from the kitchen window! Very good "treat" for Halloween!

Rated this a three stars for taste, but the entire batter could have been baked in one loaf pan.  I used two and both were very thin, about two -three inches high.

I make this every year and often have requests for it.  Fantastic!!  Rarely do two loaves last longer than a day or two
