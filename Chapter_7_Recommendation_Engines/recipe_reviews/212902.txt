First I have to thank my dear brother for bringing us fresh razor clams from the Pacific Northwest to the desert. I miss this PNW delicacy. This recipe was very nice with the crunchy panko though I do prefer my clams cooked for a few minutes on each side. (I like them chewy) I used half  butter and half oil to avoid burning the butter. Yummy....Thanks for sharing to the submitter and my bro!

Good simple recipe, but the butter can burn quickly, I used some olive oil with the butter, keeps the butter from burning and can reach a higher temp.  Love the little bit of tabasco in the mix!  Found that the faster you cook them, the more tender they are.
