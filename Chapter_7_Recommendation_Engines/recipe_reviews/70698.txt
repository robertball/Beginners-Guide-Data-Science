Very tasty! I added extra garlic (3 cloves total), 1/2 tube of sausage cooked and drained, and only 3 cups of cheese rather than 4.  Wow, there is no lack of flavor here!  A tad greasy, but expected with the sausage.  If making with sausage again I would cut down on the melted butter in the pan by at least 1/2 or try cooking spray.  The butter was oozing up over the mixture as I spread it in the pan.  I think I'll try swiss and turkey sausage next time.

These were really good but I think I prefer the Spinach Brownie recipe over this one.  I kind of feel like the majority of this recipe is fattening filler rather than spinach.  All of these are rather fattening but the Spinach Brownie recipe calls for 2 frozen boxes of spinach or ten oz of fresh.  At least you are getting more of the nurtients I was looking for.  Although, when I made the other recipe in the past, I added bacon as one reviewer suggested...making it even more unhealthy! :)  That's probably what made it so good. I would probably make these again but I didn't find they had that quiche texture like the other recipe had and that's what I was looking for.  These were a little more mushy than the others.  Still really good though!  Great for breakfast too.

I used this recipe but added about a cup of feta cheese and garlic pepper and used a 16 ounce bag of frozen (thawed) spinach. They were amazing!

Adults will love this one too.  I couldn't stop saying, "Oh, this is so good!"  You will not be disappointed if you try this dish.  You can throw this all together in no time by purchasing most the ingredients pre-shredded, pre-sliced, etc.  This would be a great potluck dish.  Tasted great leftover.  Kudos to Kim S. for such a fantastic recipe!

This recipe doesnt say what to do with the onion.......I diced it and sauteed that with the garlic in a little evoo first. I did not use the butter in the pan....no need. I sprayed with olive oil spray. Used chedder and mozzerella cheeses(way less than 4c.).....and added a pinch of nutmeg to the mix. They baked up nicely and tasted even better. Great way to eat spinach. Kids loved it.

This is very good, but I was disappointed how little spinach there is in it. It ends up being just about a cup of spinach to 4 cups of cheese: and serves 12?  That works out to mighty little spinach per serving!  It's very tasty, but not quite healthy enough to make it into our regular weekly menus, sorry.  I will try it again with doubling the spinach next time.

Good tasting recipe and easy to make. It's something between a frittata and quiche I'll definately make this one again.

I loved this! I only had 3 cups of cheese which was just enough and I used non stick cooking spray instead of butter.
This is nice because it's not too eggy, I really wasn't in the mood for a quiche or a fritatta so this was perfect. I am definetly going to add more mushrooms next time but other than that no changes need to be made.
Wonderful recipe! I'll be making it again!

Thank you so much Kim!!! I didn't know what to do with opened spinach can and I found this recipe. After reading some reviews I put 4 cloves of garlic, 1 tsp of basil, pinch of cayenne pepper and 1/2 cup of pre-cooked ground beef and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese on the top. It turns out great. My husband loved it so much. Next time, I want to try the same with kangkong(smiler to spinach in Asia)

I guess you could say I made a more "rustic" version by using fresh spinach that was very roughly chopped.  I sauteed the onion, mushrooms and spinach before adding to the flour mixture.  Used about 3/4 package of fresh spinach and 2 eggs to halve the recipe; all other measurements as specified for 6 servings.  Baked it in a round cake pan - reserved some of the cheese and sprinkled it on the top during the last few minutes of baking.   Spinach pie without the crust!

This is like quiche filling without a crust.  It's a very delicious way to get your family to eat their veggies. I cut the amount of cheese in half, and used a cup of homemade cream of mushroom soup in place of the milk and fresh mushrooms, and this recipe still turned out very rich and delicious.

Delicious!  To make healthier, I used whole wheat flour and cut back the cheddar cheese to 2 cups.  I then sprinkled the top with feta and parmessan.  Prior to combining, I sauteed the onions, garlic and mushrooms.  I also used a 16oz bag of frozen cut leaf spinach.  will definitely make again!

My mother in law and I liked this. No one else did. But it really was delicious. I used fresh spinach and an entire container of fresh mushrooms. I did have to cook it for 40 minutes rather than 30. It was too wet after 30.

Pretty good, a little bland actually. The second batch I left out the butter in the pan and just used Pam and it turned out less oily. Took it to 2 different parties in one weekend and it all got eaten. Easy and quick to make.

These were good, but I made a lot of changes because they seemed so unhealthy, so my review may not reflect the taste of the original recipe.

These were easy and yummy.  I made several changes because I needed a less fattening version.  I used egg whites instead of whole eggs, low fat milk, only 1 and 1/4 cup of reduced fat cheese and omitted the butter and used Pam instead.  Will definitely make again.

The key to making this dish firm and done in 30 minutes is to make sure you drain the spinach very well.  I defrosted my 16 oz. bag of spinach for 4 minutes in the microwave and then put it in a colonder and pressed with the back of a big spoon until most of the water was out.  I also cut the cheese to 2 cups and added 1 cup feta.  Delicious!  My family all loved it.

This was great and easy!  I made as directed except I used half the amount of cheese and had to cook it about 10 minutes longer than suggested.  Bars did not get crispy but they were delicious.  Leftovers were very yummy the next morning for breakfast.

This recipe is amazing. I made it last night for my family and I and now we have yet another dish that will be used over and over in our household. The presentation makes it even more appealing, as well! No garnishes, nothing! Just the golden crust is good enough to make it wanted!

My son loved this recipe including me! I've been having a hard time getting him to eat greens. In this recipe the spinach is disguised. I used half the amount of cheese (used raw smoked mild cheddar) and it still was very cheesy and I used fresh shitake mushrooms which my son likes. Next time I'll use half the amount of salt (sea salt) as the cheese was pretty salty. Thanks for making my life simpler with this recipe.

I used cooked fresh spinach, omitted the mushrooms and only used 2C cheddar.  Next time I'll try to add other veges and less butter.  Overall, great new recipe.

These were pretty good.  Next time I'll use the ideas of the other reviewers and cut down on the butter and cheese (it was plenty cheesy and greasy which I think cut down on the taste).  My kids ate a little of these, but not much.

Well, personally this one is a five star.  But my kids didn't like it.  I think it would be better if the onions were caramelized first, but doing it this way made it fast and simple.  I will do it again...just when the kids are gone.  It's a quick one to do when you don't have a lot on hand and forgot to thaw meat.

These spinach bars were absolutely EXCELLENT! My dad and I are both fond of veggies and cheese seems to go well with many different ones. I made this batch and by the end of the next day they were completely gone! This is without a doubt one of the best spinach recipes I have heard of! :)

A delicious and easy dinner, lunch or breakfast dish. Lots of flavor. Highly recommend this dish. I like how the butter in the pan makes the edges nice and crispy. I'm eating leftovers for lunch right now. 

I made minor changes.  I sauteed the onion, garlic, and mushrooms before adding them to the mix.  For those who care about the glycemic index, I also replaced two tablespoons of the floor with Hi-Maize resistant starch.

Great recipe. Hubby and I enjoyed; although, hubby would like for me to cook longer to make edges crunchier. I also made a goof and forgot the onion! Personally, I think the onion would have only made it better. So, I look forward to making it again - with the onions this time!

The bars that made me famous!!
Well almost.  Everyone loves these bars. I take these to any gathering and come home with an empty tray.  Sometimes I make a double batch and leave some at home.  They are great from breakfast.  I make mine in a slightly smaller pan so they are a bit thicker and cook them a bit longer too.

My pickiest veggie eater loved this!  I wanted more spinach than everything else, so I cut the recipe to 2/3, but used the full amount of spinach.  Baked in an 8x8 dish for a little less than 30 minutes and it came out perfect.  My kids (3.5 and 1.5) loved it, so it's definitely a keeper.

I felt this was more like spinach flavored cheese rather than an actual spinach dish, even though I doubled the spinach. I brought it to a pot luck and everyone liked it though, so I am giving it 4 stars.

These are awesome! Next time I will cut down the flour a little and add a little more egg. They're kind of like spinach-cheese bread--I was thinking more along the lines of a quiche when I made them--but they're GREAT!

This was one of the best spinach dishes I've ever tried!  In fact, I'm going to the store to get the stuff to make more.  The only thing I "changed" was using seasoned salt instead of regular salt & I added more pepper than called for, but that's just a personal taste.  I highly recommend these!

WOW! This is seriously AMAZING. People now demand that I make it for every potluck I host/attend. I don't have kids, but I absolutely love spinach and cheese, so this recipe is perfect for me.

I have made it quite a few times as is, and it's quite good. However, here are my favorite alterations: Lightly sauté onions before baking -- otherwise, they will be a little crunchy and too powerful. I don't like mushrooms, so I leave them out. I use fat free cheese to cut down on the calories (and usually only use about 3 cups). Also, I use half minced garlic, half garlic powder -- to better distribute the garlicky taste.

Pretty good recipe. Tastes a lot like spanakopitas that I really like. A bit too salty (I used frozen, unsalted spinach, but it could have been the sharp cheese), but that's an easy fix. Most of the kids didn't like it, but that's kids for you. Thanks for a good recipe.

I served this with chicken the other night and everyone really enjoyed it. I did omit the onions and mushrooms due to some picky eaters in the house and only used about a cup and a half of sharp cheddar and it still came out tasty. This will surely be showing up at the dinner table again!

This was really good.  I used one small onion, 1/4t of garlic powder for the garlic, 2c of 2% sharp cheddar and 2c of Cabot 75% reduced fat cheddar.  I omitted the mushrooms as I didn't have them.  I mixed up everything but the baking powder the night before, however, I forgot to add in the powder the next morning.  They still were great.  We'll definitely make this again.  My 3-year-old gobbled them up.  My 9-year-old didn't but I think that was just because he thought I was trying to trick him into eating spinach.  Uh, yeah!!!

I used a 10 oz bag of fresh spinach instead of frozen. I had to bake mine longer then 30 min.  I thought the texture was mushy/pastey and that the taste is bland as written.  It needs more spices.  I added  a small amount of parmesan cheese to it and reduced the chedder by a cup.  As it cooled in the pan, it flattened.  I also think it would benefit the recipe/dish if  it were to be baked in a smaller pan. THX

I really liked this recipe. Kids would not touch it as it still looked like spinach ... was hoping for them to look more ... bar like. A tad more salt though. I will make this again. Thanks so much.

Fantastic!  I call this "almost quiche," and my family has had it for breakfast over the last several days.  I didn't have cheddar and used swiss instead, and it turned out great.  Next time, to make it more "breakfast-y" I think I'll add some cooked sausage.

Very tasty. I used fresh spinach and added green onion rather than mushrooms as I didn't have any. I cut the recipe in half as I only had 5 oz of spinach. It did seem as though there was way too much spinach when combining all the ingredients, but It was great. I will definitely make it again.

This turned out great! My son actually ate spinach, thanks to this recipe. Made a couple substitutions...almost halved the cheese(2 1/2 cups) and finely chopped about 1/4 cup of onion and added it last to the mixture. Also added some garlic salt and power because I was out of garlic. As another reviewer shared, I also added a pinch of nutmeg. It was great, will def make again. Maybe add some turkey bacon next time!

These are a hit whenever I make them! I cut back a to 2 Tb of butter and didn't notice the difference at all, if anything it was less greasy. Even non-spinach lovers go for this one.

Used others reviews to guide me. Didn't use butter, I used EVOO. Sautted the onions and mushrooms together, then added garlic, sautted a bit more. Threw it all together and the kiddos loved it. Didnt want to admit it, but they did!

I've never rated a recipe so poorly. I followed it exactly as-is, and it turned out awfully. It tastes unpleasant, the consistency seems off to me. It's not at all a "bar," you basically need to eat it with a spoon. I doubt it's undercooked, because I cooked it for an additional 20 minutes beyond what the recipe stated. It never burned, but it never got any denser, either.

I won't make this again. It's not like it was terrible, but the health benefit isn't great and neither is the taste. (I need one or the other.) The directions weren't specific, but it was easy to figure out what you were supposed to do. I think there are other spinach recipes out there similar to this one that're better.

Yummy! I used canned mushrooms and to cut down on fat, I used a little baking spray instead of the butter in the pan and cut the cheese in half to two cups. Still VERY tasty!

This recipe was great.  I actually altered it a bit to make it even more healthy.  I used whole wheat flour and 1 tsp wheat gluten instead of all purpose flour.  I also decreased the cheese by 1 cup. I did add a bit more salt for flavor.

I substituted based on what I had on hand. I used two  teaspoons of minced garlic (out of a jar), the entire 16 oz bag of frozen spinach and diced a cooked chicken breast to substitute for the mushrooms.. It was really good.

Oh no! I followed the directions and then looked at the lonely onion on my kitchen counter. Ha. The directions forget to mention the onion. So, I made mine without. But they were good anyway. :)

yum and easy! 
used much less cheese. 2 cups. used much more spinach- fresh also. maybe a bags worth. i sauted the mushrooms, onion, garlic and spinach and then added pieces of ham. This is a great brunch item that everyone will love! comfort food packed with veggies.

Wasn't to crazy about this recipe. Although I did forget to add baking powder. I found it to be very greasy. Also not sure if I baked it long enough, baked it for 33 minutes. Reminded me of a quiche. Don't think I'll be trying this one again.

Didn't add mushrooms. Yes, it was a hit with my family.

Very good.  I used whatever cheese we had around - mostly Monterey Jack, a little cheddar, and a little Parmesan.  You don't need 3 tablespoons of butter - it was swimming in it.  Just enough to thoroughly grease the pan - 1-2 tablespoons is plenty.  I sautéed the onion and mushrooms a bit before adding.  I'll definitely make this again.
