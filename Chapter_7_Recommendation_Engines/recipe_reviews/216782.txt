I was tickled to find this recipe here. This is one is almost like the one that I have been using for years. I liked your version as it uses a bit less sugar. I have even frozen the dough for up to 3 weeks before baking and they turned out just great. They store well also.

Awesome cookies. Dough was pretty crumbly. Had to really work to keep it together, but it was worth it. Family loved them. Thanks!

I couldn't keep my dough together at all, but that did not keep me from pressing it down on to the cookie sheet and baking it anyway! Even after I baked them they were really crumbly.
I still give the recipe 5 stars because they are so good

If was not what I expected. It does make a good shortbread cookie.

I have made this two years in a row for my Christmas baskets. They have an excellent taste but the dough is very crumbly. I will be making more in a week or so and will add the extra egg as someone else recommended.

This little cookie is not too sweet and would be enjoyed by both children and adults alike.  I made half the recipe using a whole egg, therefore I didn’t have the crumbling problem mentioned by other reviewers.  I would recommend adding another egg if you run into that problem because the cookies I made were easy to form, baked up perfectly, and had wonderful flavor.  These cookies are perfect for a cookie tray for the holidays or a tea.  Thanks for sharing!

I added about several tablespoons of molasses, and reduced the flour by about a quarter cup because the dough was so crumbly. They were so good!  I’ll definitely make them again.

Liked these a lot.  Didn't change a thing and didn't have any problems with crumbling dough that some others reviews mentioned.  If the recipe has been changed to prevent the crumbling problem, I wish AR would state that its been revised so others don't add something it no longer needs.  Thanks for sharing.

Great cookie recipe. After reading other reviews, I added an extra egg and had no problem with the dough being crumbly.
