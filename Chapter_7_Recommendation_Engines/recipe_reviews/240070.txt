This was delicious, but.....I bought a good sized Cauliflower that was bigger than a head of Iceberg Lettuce. I have very sharp knives. I was only able to get two good 1 inch steaks out of the head of Cauliflower. I mention this only because if you are planning on steaks for presentation, you will need more cauliflower than one head. The two ends were roasted and are equally delicious, but I only have two "steaks" out of one head. This is so good,  you might want to make at least two heads of cauliflower anyway......I keep eating the florets right out of the pan! I seasoned this with Garlic Garni (a mixed garlic and pepper seasoning) Again, DELICIOUS! Thanks for a great recipe!

Great recipe.   I followed pretty close, except I used garlic salt and black pepper instead of garlic powder and salt.   I cut into wedges to get the most I could out of my head of cauliflower, and even though they were unevenly sliced, they all were done at the same time.

We tried these last night. I followed the recipe leaving out the salt but used the garlic powder and fresh ground pepper.  I used a romanesco green cauliflower which is pointy and spiky instead of round. I was only able to get two 'steaks' about 1 inch each from a 1 kilo cauliflower. I tossed the fallout pieces with the oil mixture and then brushed the remaining mixture on the 'steaks'. I served it with balsamic glaze drizzled over it. The fun shape (they looked like Christmas trees) and the immense flavour even attracted the kids who claim not to like cauliflower. The cooking time turned out perfect for me. Definite keeper method to serve cauliflower. Thanks SPetrocelly

Simple and perfect. Make sure to buy a very tight head of cauliflower or your steaks will fall apart. Also I found it best to cut the cauliflower in half, top to bottom through the core then cut steaks from the center out. Do NOT try to make them thin. Use it as a side  vegetable or under something with gravy as you would potatoes. I adjust seasoning to fit the main course. Blackening seasoning works as does a simple garlic pepper.

Made as written. My picky 11 year old loved it & ate half the pan! I got 3 steaks from one head & I also cooked all of the pieces that crumbled off. It was all delicious!  The darker brown, the sweeter it got. I will be making this again with 2 heads next time. Thanks for the recipe!

This is surprisingly really really good.   Change up the spices based on your preferences, but the recipe as written was enjoyed by everyone, except for one vegetable-disliking child. No surprise there, unfortunately.

Very good. A couple variations: I didn't have garlic salt/powder, so used chopped fresh garlic, sprinkled on before the olive oil. Sprinkled with Parmesan after turning & spread garlic butter over after removing from oven. Yumm but then we're garlic lovers.
Also, it didn't take more than 8 minutes after turning , for ours & I had the oven at 425 from the start .

Oh My!  Where have you been hiding all these years!!!  For being so simple and easy it is really, really good.  I went for the garlic powder option and at the last minute decided to sprinkle on some Mrs. Dash Original seasoning.  I think this added a lot to the flavor.  Thank you SPetrocelly for sharing this recipe.  It's my new best way to fix cauliflower.  Next time I will add the Parmesan cheese as suggested by Marilyn.

Roasted Cauliflower Steaks Haiku: "Stellar recipe. What I mean is, mind was BLOWN. So easy, so good!" My only frownie face was that 2 of my 4 "steaks" fell apart when I flipped them, but otherwise, this recipe is super-easy and just delicious! I brushed the olive oil on rather than drizzle just so I'd be sure it would get into all the little crevices of our ghost trees. 17 month old loved them. Ate alongside Italian sausage w/ peppers for a low-carb dinner; I hate to bring out the "duuuude" but duuuude this was awesome.

I have made this numerous times and we love it! At first I struggled like everyone else, trying to get the cauliflower cut into steaks. Last time, out of frustration of not being able to cut it into steaks, I broke the cauliflower up into slightly larger than bite sized pieces, but still followed the recipe...It actually turned out better!! You might want to cut the cooking time down a couple minutes, and don't worry about turning the smaller pieces... I don't think it matters on size, it is hard to make this recipe wrong!

I can't believe how delicious this was!  The only way I used to like cauliflower was simmered, mashed and mixed in with potatoes.  Both my husband and I thought this was excellent, and better than roasting it whole. We had the leftovers for lunch today and it was delicious cold as well.  I made it just as written and wouldn't change a thing.

Whoa Nelly! I made it and it got glowing glowing overflowing wows. I did mess with it a bit. I sprinkled McCormick's Montreal Steak Seasoning atop, then drizzled in oil (olive). I put shredded Parmesan on top. My husband was disappointed there wasn't more and my daughter, a devout carnivore, wolfed it down and asked for more. And, most importantly, our dog gave rave reviews (from my plate, as usual). Thanks.

It takes a really good recipe to get 5 stars from me and this one deserves it! Pitifully easy, plenty tasty, and affordable, what more can you ask for? I made it pretty much just as it was written and it was a huge hit with my family.  I will be doing this again. Won't  be doing that steam thing ever again this is WAY more flavorful! Oh, and three of us ate a whole large head of cauliflower! It was that good.

I decided not to dribble with oil but spread real salted butter all over after I sprinkled with garlic & onion powder, oregano, parsley and basil.  Oh so delissio!!!  I made 2 meals of it.  A little lemon dribbled on top would probably be nice before eating.

Amazing!!! I had a good sized head of cauliflower, and sliced it into 1" sections, some small some nice and wide. Did one cookie sheet olive oil, salt & pepper...the other olive oil & Mrs dash....to say I got rave reviews and no leftovers is an understatement...the kids told me I can make this anytime!  thanks for sharing this recipe!

I cut the cauliflower horizontal as opposed to vertical like the recipes suggests.  This worked much better for achieving "steaks".

Made this for my son who constantly watches his weight and loves cauliflower.  I made it exactly as recipe and we all loved it.  Have made this several times now and have had raves.  This is one quick side dish that really makes a dinner.

Very easy and very good!  I did have some challenges cutting  my cauliflower.  It was on the small side and I was able to cut two steaks from it.  However, since I wss going to be the only one eating - it worked out!  The remainder will go to making mashed cauliflower!  I will definitely use this recipe again!

Yum! This is my new favorite way to fix cauliflower. I had a problem with the integrity of the "steaks" but who cares if they fall apart? This was perfect with  roasted garlic chicken thighs.

So easy to make resulting in great flavor. I made the steaks as written with the only change being Mrs Dash Original in place of the salt. Even if you don't like cauliflower I highly recommend you try it roasted.

Absolutely delicious! I used chopped fresh garlic and garlic powder because we love garlic flavor. Next time I will used 2 heads of califlower as there was very little leftovers.  I ssrved this as a sids to crockpot cheesey bacon chipotle ranch chicken,and organic white rice. If you have vegetable haters this roasted califlower may make a convert!

This was amazing! We have been looking for more ways to make vegetables the center of the plate. I added a little more seasoning, mostly Chile peppers, then topped it with Peppadews.

My husband and kids loved this. My three year old kept saying, “more steak! More chicken!” I had to keep telling him it’s cauliflower, haha. I substituted minced, fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. Apply salt and pepper liberally. Delicious! Served with mashed Japanese yams and brown rice.

This was wonderful. I sprayed the foil afraid that the steaks would stick. Not necessary. I think they would have charred a little better without the extra oil. I added a splash of lemon juice and some diced onion.  I also added freshly shaved parmesan cheese when I turned them. Yum. Really good. My husband and I ate the whole tray. Great way to amp up cauliflower!

The only change I made was to increase the garlic powder.  I didn't measure but just sprinkled it on liberally, knowing I put on more than 1/4 tsp.  I would definitely make this again.  For company too!  It was very easy.

Delicious! Loved how simple it was. I read the reviews so I purchased 2 heads of cauliflower and it turned it beautifully! This went well with our mini bbq (zucchini & bell pepper) turkey meat loaves! Thank you, for a simply wonderful recipe!

Delicious. It is a simple recipe with not much prep time and can be done in 40 minutes at the most. I topped it with truffled salt, amazingly good.

So many variations how you can season this and it is DELICIOUS!  I always use just a pinch of red pepper flakes and have used poultry seasoning as well. You cannot go wrong with whatever you use.  You have to be generous with the olive oil and I use a baster to cover all of the nooks and crannies. The trick that I have found to cutting the head without shredding it into pieces is to use a large serrated bread knife and finding a firm head of cauliflower. Works every time. Thanks a million for my go-to cauliflower recipe.

Tried this with my teenagers first, then my husband too.  All of the family agrees that this is fantastic.  Originally cauliflower eaters anyway, it was so different and tasty!  We couldn't get over the fact that the house smelled like French fries and the cauliflower ended up tasting very close to baked potatoes!  We thought it was a fluke... maybe we were all craving potatoes instead, nope!  It's just wonderfully different.  Also delicious pureed after roasting

Great recipe! The only change I made was adding about a 1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika to the marinade. I’m trying to cut down on carbs and this was a great substitute for bread.

Instead of oli I smeared the 'steaks' with dijon mustard because I am counting calories. I seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic powder. Easy and delicious.

I don't even like cauliflower but I love this.  Every couple of weeks, I make this.  I like my cauliflower cut thinner so I don't even worry about getting steaks. I just cut to my desired thickness,  throw all the pieces on the sheet pan (lined with foil), dump on the oil and spices and bake (don't forget to turn them over half way).  I especially love the smaller crispier pieces.

This is a total hit in my house! I only had a medium sized cauliflower so I got about 3 - 1/2 inch small steaks. The rest I crumbled and tossed in the leftover oil with some halved brussels sprouts. I also added some dried sage and savory leaves to the oil along with salt and pepper.

I made this in a convection toaster oven and the time was too long.  After 10 minutes on the second side the cauliflower was already more tender than I like.  Recommendation is to check tenderness often to make sure it’s to your liking.  I also added turmeric to the spice blend and that added a nice color as well as flavor.  Overall I’ll make this again for sure.

Delicious! My husband and I eat this several times a week!
I usually end up wit 2 half inch 'steaks' and cut the rest of the cauliflower to the same thickness. i spread a little olive oil on parchment paper before I place the cauliflower on. I then use a silicon brush to brush the olive oil mixed with the garlic powder on and then sprinkle with salt and pepper. I bake for about 15 minutes. Then I remove the little bits (otherwise they'll burn) and turn rest over and bake for another 5-8 minutes. Works every time!

Wow, these were really tasty. I used another reviewers suggestion to slice the head directly into the center first and ended up with 2 good "steaks" and 2 good sized end pieces, which ultimately fell apart (not as pretty as the steaks, but just as tasty).  I seasoned with a generous brushing of olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic powder, McCormick's Perfect Pinch Basil and Garlic, as well as McCormick's Perfect Pinch Parmesan and Herb seasoning blends. I also added a little bit of paprika as well. These went over extremely well; will definitely make again! I served alongside Cheddar Mushroom Pork Steaks with new potatos for a complete and hearty meal.

I used Roasted Garlic Olive Oil, seasoned with garlic pepper and salt. Sprinkled with grated parmesan and the result was absolutely fantastic!

Difficult to believe how good this is. I really don't care for cauliflower at all. I followed the recipe and added steak seasoning before cooking. As others stated the dark brown spots are the best. We ate them alone for dinner and nothing else. Then the bits  that fell  off while cutting- tossed them on the sheet and in the oven. From the oven to our plates.   This is fabulous!??

Healthy food and taste wonderful.  I add a little sriracha sauce, just enough kick, not spicy at all. I will definitely do it again and again. 
As I cut it  into steaks, the presentation is good, that my hubby suggests I do it at our big Christmas meal as a side.

I made these for the first time last night just as the directions indicated. I drizzled balsamic vinegar on half of them when I served them and that was a hit.  We enjoyed these very much and will be making them again. As other reviewers noted I was only able to get two "steaks" from one medium head so the rest were just florets. Next time I will also cook them longer, until the edges are more blackened, as I really liked those "well done" pieces the best.  They had more of a roasted flavor to them.

This was delicious. Didn't think it could be so good with such a simple recipe, but we were "mmm"-ing the whole time. Will get 2 heads of cauliflower next time so we can have more!! Agree w previous reviewers that you'll only get 2-3 "steaks", but that the florettes are just as yummy. Thanks for a great recipe to add to our rotation!

This is such a simple and satisfying way to enjoy cauliflower. I followed the recipe as stated. You could easily season this with any herbs you like. I imagine it would also be nice with a curry powder sprinkled on top before roasting or add some fresh grated parmesan.

This was so scrumpdiddliumptious!!!  I made it for tomorrow's meal but kept picking pieces.  My new favorite way of making cauliflower.  Prepared it with olive oil, garlic powder then a seasoned mix.  Might try a balsamic vinegar drizzle next time.  Delicious!!!

I am on a diet, so I had to take the olive oil out.  I subbed in "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" spray at 0 calories per spray.  It worked great.  So the olive oil would have been better, undoubtedly, but my substitution worked.  Thanks for a recipe so good, I didn't feel like I was dieting.

Very tasty.  I cut away too much of stem so I only got two steaks that held together.  It didn't matter because the broken pieces still cooked well.    I think oven temperature is  a little too high for length of time of cooking, as cauliflower  came close to burning.  Looking forward to making this again.

This is good, but I can never get more than two steaks out of a head of cauliflower. I think the concept of steaks is a little impractical.

I brushed on the oil for more uniform consistency. I sprinkled a little paprika on it as well.  Wonderful!

We love roasted veggies, and this recipe makes for a pretty presentation to a meal.  Simple to do and definitely will be making it this way again.  'Chili-Lime Chicken Kabobs' and 'Shoepeg Corn Salad' both AR recipes, completed the meal.
