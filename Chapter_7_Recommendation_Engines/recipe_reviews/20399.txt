I don't know that this tastes just like a thin mint cookie, but it's pretty good. The mint overpowered it a bit, so I'd cut back on it a little.

I like to use peppermint schnapps instead of cream de mint and kaluah/chocolate instead of white chocolate! Chill it you get a sensation of great taste and afterwards too! No chaser even wanted! But do only top off with mint!

This shot is good to a point.  I don't think that it taste like a cookie but definitely need to cut back on the Creme de Menthe.  WAY OVERPOWERING!!!  Granted the recipe is off a little on here.  I would suggest 1/2 oz. of Irish Cream, 1/3 oz. White Chocolate and then just a dab of Creme de Menth.  Much better this way but still not a cookie.

We made these shots at an Irish themed party and they were a hit....be sure to chill the Irish Cream over ice before layering your liquors...it's much better!

This was really good. I used green crème de menthe. Next time, I will tweak this and take the Irish Cream down to 1/2 ounce and the crème de menthe up to 1/2 oz. It had a light mint flavor and I want to step it up a bit. I let it chill in the fridge for almost 2 hours.

This was a really good shot.  I would cut back on the mint just a bit next time and I might try it with the Vanilla Baileys.  This would also be good in a glass with ice and a bit of milk added to become more of a cocktail.
