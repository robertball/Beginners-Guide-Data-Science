I love this recipe. The dried apples make it very good. I actually doubled the apples and raisins, my favorite part of it. lol...Very good.

Very Tasty!!!  I added dried cranberries with apples instead of just apples (found next to the raisins at the grocery store).  Also wait longer then 5 mintues to put the yogart covered raisins...otherwise they will start melting.  I did wait about 15 and some still did melt.

This was good, but I microwaved it longer than I was supposed to after adding the apples because they didn't appear brown as the directions said they should. Now some of the apples are hard or too chewy, so next time I will be sure to only microwave it for the time it states.

Excellent sweet snack mix...really nice blend of flavors.  I halved this recipe and fudged on the measurements, and it still came out perfect! Even my picky husband likes it.  I substituted cinnamon Chex, added dark chocolate-covered raisins, and about 1 cup of apple-cinnamon Cheerios to the mix, and it is wonderful.  I also found some cinnamon-flavored apple chips to use in place of dried apples- these have a little crisper texture than plain dried apples and great flavor. Great autumn snack mix!

I love this recipe but I like to make a few changes. First instead of almonds I use dry honey roasted peanuts, second I use regular raisins instead of yogurt covered raisins. I love the changes gives it that added touch.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a really big hit.  I made 2 batches separately and doubled the cinnamon in the second batch because the first was not cinnamony enough for me.  I mixed them together and it turned out great.
I went to Whole Foods for the dried apples (in the bulk aisle) and then saw they had them at Wal-Mart!  My dad has requested another batch for Christmas and asked that I add cashews as well.
This was very easy to make and tastes great!  It's not super sweet but it is very addictive!  I highly recommend it!

Awesome. Perfect for Turkey Day or any fall event. Very different from traditional chex. Couldn't find just dried apples. So I used a dried fruit ix that had apples AND Cranberries. Cranberries are a must in this.

At first this recipe started out with small microwave fire, followed by a painful, but easily treated first/second degree burn.  However, with a little tweaking (addition of chocolate covered peanuts, cinnamon chex) the final result is quite good.  My only advice would be to check the wattage of your microwave, evidentally mine is set on nuclear.

Everyone loved this.  I used homemade apple chips in place of dried apples.  I sliced granny smith apples with a mandoline, put them on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and sprinkled with a pinch of cinnamon sugar.  Baked at 200 for 2 hrs.  They keep their color and taste wonderful in this mix.  I cooked it all on the stove stirring constantly

This is a nice "fallish" Chex Mix recipe. The cinnimon flavor is not too over powering or too sweet. Instead of microwaving, i baked the batch at 200 for 1hr.. mixing at 20 min intervals. I too, couldn't find dried diced apples and had to use apple rings then cut them up. I think next time will either leave out the apples or wait until I do find diced dried apples. I also added rice chex to the mix cutting the wheat to 3 cups and the rice to 2. Ok overall.

I am really enjoying this!  I used golden raisins  instead of the yogurt covered and skipped the dried apples since I couldn't find them at the store.  I would make this again.

This mix turned out great - very flavorful! I added extra cinnamon (3-4 teaspoons) like other people suggested and this was definitely a good call. When microwaving, the recipe says to stir every minute but I would suggest stirring the mix every 30-45 seconds to avoid clumping and/or burning. Overall, a great recipe which I highly recommend trying!

Try using Cinnamon Chex for a Gluten Free option.  Delete the added cinnamon.

This snack is delicious! The only apples I had access to were a dried cranberry and spiced apples mix. The flavors blend amazingly well. We usually have muddy buddy mix at holiday gatherings while we cook and visit, this was an excellent change.

Great recipe for school parties. I was in the mood for something different than the regular chex mix and this was delicious. Since my son took it for his Halloween Party I've had 4 moms and 2 teachers ask me for the recipe.

Very crispy and lots of flavor.  I used a mix of left over Chex cereals and was still very good.  I also used the candied almonds from the store for extra flavor.

Very good, even kinda healthy :)  I used a bit more cinnamon than in the recipe (ok - truth is a I didn't measure).  I actually used dried cranberries instead of the yogurt covered raisins because I had them on hand, and my friends don't like raisins.  Not 5 stars because I wish the coating was more over the apple and cranberries instead of just on the chex/almonds.  But, very good - and easy - microwave away!

This is pretty good, I wouldn't take it to a function but for home and snack it's pretty good. I burned the first batch so open the microwave during the apple step a few times to smell for burning. We also used raisinets instead of yogurt covered raisins because my husband prefers them.

I made this with rice chex since I can't eat wheat.  It was still really good.  Next time I think I'll try sliced almonds since I liked the flavor of the almond but not the big chunck of the whole almond.
UPDATE 11/12/2010   I have since made this with sliced almonds and it was much better.  I have also doubled the syrup mixture which we like better.  The last time I made this I omitted the raisins and everyone liked it better (you got more of the apple cinnamon flavor)!  Now by using sliced almonds and double syrup with or without the raisins I rate this a 5 star recipe!!

I couldn't find dried apples anywhere. I used dried pineapple instead and it came out ok. I've made better Chex Mixes though.

Made these for a road trip and they didn't make the trip back home!  I added cranberries along with golden raisins and waited until the mix was completely cooled before adding the yogurt covered raisins. Very good snack

I made 5 batches of this chex mix for school. I started out using margarine, I ran out and started using butter. Butter cooked a lot faster than the margarine. So I only cooked butter for 30sec stirred & cooked another 30 sec. I also found that 3min was too long. I have a high powered  microwave so I only cooked for 2min. I did read complaints that they cooked it too long. I also used candy corn & marshmallows instead of nuts & apples.

Yum! Such a great snack. I used about half wheat chex and half rice chex, because I had both on hand. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing!

Very easy and a little less salty than the other Chex mixes.  I followed the advice to let cool before adding the yogurt raisins and I used Corn Chex instead of Wheat, just because.

Yep that's right, another 5 ***** STARS! 
I followed other suggestions: made apple chips: very thinly sliced apples, (I used red delicious), sprinkled lightly with cinnamon and sugar, baked at 200 for 2 hours; and also substituted Cinnamon Chex for Wheat Chex; used Whole Natural Almonds, not salted.  Also prepared over stove top, all in one large pot.  So addicting, with a family of four, this was gone within 24 hours.  :o

Flavor was good, cooking method was iffy.  Mine burnt in the initial 3 minutes, so I was unable to keep microwaving it for the second round if I wanted to salvage any.  That being said, flavor was fantastic - used 1.5 tsp cinnamon and yogurt raisins and yogurt cranberries.  Subbed cashews for almonds because I was almost out of almonds.  I'll probably do again, but maybe go back to the old fashioned oven-dry, and skip the microwave altogether.  I don't really trust that thing anyways...

Yum, this is such a nice change of pace. I added a whole 5 oz. package of dried apples, used golden raisins and dried cranberries, and used sliced almonds rather than whole ones. My husband came home and asked what smelled so good, then refused to try it. More for me! The cinnamon taste is very subtle, but I don't think that I will up it when I make this recipe in the future.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!  I make lots of changes to it when I make it, but the most important one to me is that I DOUBLE the recipe for the glaze!  I like it soooo much better when there is more glaze, makes it sweeter and more crispy.  I made TONS of this and sent it to my husband and his unit while they were in Iraq last year.  It travels well, and stays fresh for a long time!

This is fantastic for a sweet treat.  I used Crispex because I needed the mix to be gluten free.  I made my own dried apples with some apples that were on their last legs.  I used craisens instead of yogurt raisens.  YUMMY!

This is ok, but not good enough to make again.  I brought this recipe and traditional Chex Party mix to our Christmas gathering.  The traditional mix was gone nearly instantly, and hardly any of the Cinnamon Apple mix was eaten.

My family loved this.  I used craisins instead of the yogurt raisins.  It was quick and easy.  I'll be making this for the holidays and in between.  You must try this one.  It's a keeper.

Delicious & easy!! Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I used Cinammon Chex (not Wheat) & I didn't use dried apples; I used the cinammon "crisp" apple chips - wonderful! I did think the rasins were a bit out of place, as they sunk to the bottom of the mix, so you had to dig for those, but they tasted yummy. Such a great holiday snack!!

This was a real hit, although I felt it was missing something in the mix!  I subbed Rice Chex for the Wheat kind & a dried mixed berry mix, that I found at Aldi's, instead of the apples. I did add the yogurt covered raisins too early & they melted slightly.

yummy yummy. I has to make some changes since my husband won't eat nuts, or yogurt covered anything, so i kept the apples, but used a whole bag and just cut them, added fresh home popped popcorn(no butter) and added both vanilla to the syrup mixture and then melted creamy peanut butter and mixed it together. Instead of microwaving it, i put it in the oven for an extra crisp! The cinnamon really adds a great flavor!!!

yummy!  This recipe is perfect as it is, but next time I will make some changes merely due to personal preference.  I think I will try pecans instead of almonds and add pretzels for saltiness.  I'll probably add M n M's or chocolate covered peanuts instead of the raisins.  I think I'll also mix it up with different chex cereals, like rice, or honey nut flavored....  This is very addictive!

Really good and easy to make, but make sure you let it cool down before you add the yogurt covered raisins or you'll end up with raisins and yogurt bits all throughout.

It's hard to stop eating this! Some recommendations: For the sauce, avoid cooking too long or it thickens too much. After 1 min. cooking, stir, then put back in the microwave for about 30 seconds, but watch and remove it when it starts to boil (15-20 seconds for me). I used a mix of rice chex and wheat chex, then pecans and sliced almonds. We didn't like the apples because they were too chewy, but cranberries were great.

A little too good.  I used Barbara's Shredded Spoonfuls cereal instead of Wheat Chex (didn't have it at the store)..it's a tiny bit lower in calories and is multi-grain.  I used the New Zealand apple rings from Trader Joes (I sliced these) and handmade yogurt covered raisins from Fresh and Easy.

This is a great recipe! I had a hard time finding dried apples too and it turns out that my grocery store (Kroger) has them in the same isle with the fruit roll ups. I add dark chocolate covered raisins and use dried cherries (also in the fruit roll up isle).

Love, but I did in oven instead of microwave.  I was juggling other types of chex mix that required the oven instead.  So I followed suit.  Only thing is that the yogurt-covered raisins really, really need to be added when the mix is fully, fully cooled.  I added the yougurt-covered raisins to a cooled tray of mix while the tray was sitting on top of the stove (still warm cooking other chex mixes).  You guessed it, they melted (o:  It's ok, still very good!

I couldn't find dried apples, so I baked fresh apple rings sprinkled with cinnamon sugar and then cut them.  I also added banana chips and chocolate yogurt covered raisins.  Everyone loved it!

Great recipe - nice alternative to the savory Chex Mixes. I  had to use cashews instead of almonds, but that's the only change I made. Love it.

Huge hit! Everyone loved it.  I made 2 batches since I was taking it to a party.  I’ll definitely make it again.  

Easy to make and tastes very good
