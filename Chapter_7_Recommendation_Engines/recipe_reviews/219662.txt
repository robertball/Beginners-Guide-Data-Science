Very good quesadilla recipe, I added in some crumbled bacon and used a pepper jack cheese for some extra kick!

Wow. This recipe was ah-mazing!! I made 4 servings for just my husband and I and it was A LOT of food. We used just half of the 12 oz package of the johnsonville chicken sausage and saved the other half to make this again later this week. 1/2 the package worked out to be the perfect amount and this is definitely something we would enjoy twice in one week!! Soooo delicious!! Didn't need salsa either cuz it was plenty juicy and flavorful by itself. I would have worried that the salsa would take away from the amazing flavor of the sausage!!

Hmm, I didn't know what to think about this one? I used a different flavor of chicken cheese sausage, that I like, and a little red onion for the green. However, these tasted so much like "breakfast." I felt that all it was missing was some eggs. To make it easier I just sauteed the ingredients on the stove top and heated the quesadillas that way also. That should have been fine. I may even consider something like this one day for breakfast. It had salsa as optional, and I ended up adding some chopped tomato and cilantro. That helped, but still remineded me in flavor of a flat breakfast burrito. Pre-cooked chicken sausage works well on pizza, so I thought I would give it a try. It also works well with onions and peppers normally.

I used the ingredients in the recipe, but, just prepared a little differently.  I saut√©ed the onions, peppers, & sausage in a pan before adding to the quesadilla.  Instead of broiling I just heated in a pan on the stovetop until the outside was lightly golden & crispy and the cheese was melted.  I thought the chicken sausage was good, but, I wasn't crazy about the flavor of it in the quesadilla.   I think I would prefer the sausage in one of the pasta dish recipes that are under the Johnsonville recipe section on AR.
