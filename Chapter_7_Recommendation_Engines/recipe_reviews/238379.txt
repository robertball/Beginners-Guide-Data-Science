I made a half-batch, and they were delicious and easy to make. I had no difficulty with the dough at all. You need to sprinkle your board with Bisquick. Since this was a half recipe, I just plopped the dough (it is sticky) onto the board and with Bisquick on my hands, shaped it into a round, approx 1" thick. I then cut out the biscuits with a glass. I didn't think it was necessary to roll out this small amount, but I'm sure this would work for a full recipe as well if you just do it in two sections. The dough was very light and fluffy, just like the biscuits. I had one with butter but will be great with jam for breakfast! Thanks Heidi for a great recipe!

These are absolutely delicious.  I didn't roll mine out.  I used a large cookie scoop instead.  They made an awesome drop biscuit. My entire family loved them.

Great addition to the Christmas morning brunch.  Didn't have sour cream on hand so I substituted cream cheese.  Rolled out the dough to about 1/2-3/4 inches thick then folded over  and lightly rolled out again to get to approx. 1 inch. The melted butter in the pan is a great touch.  These biscuits rise like crazy and ended up super light and fluffy.  Served with the option of  sausage gravy and/or with jam.  Most took both.  Raves from even the picky eaters.  Can't wait to try these in a dutch oven.

These are easy and delicious.They are not the same texture as traditional biscuits, so if that is what you are looking for this is not the recipe  They are wickedly good and taste fresh for a couple of days if reheated. This recipe makes a boatload of biscuits. The sweetness of the 7-up is not noticeable in the biscuits. I think that the reviewer that had difficulty with the stickiness did not dust hands and dough well with additional biscuick.

The dough was ridiculously sticky! It was impossible to roll it out because it stuck to everything! My hands, my floured board, everything!  I had to add more bisquick every time I tried to roll it out.

I wanted a nice soft biscuit to top with gravy after my Sweetheart had some dental surgery.  This fit the bill, but using Bisquick made them very salty.  I am usually a scratch cook, but wanted to try this recipe as written.  Now I will make a 'Bisquick substitute' without so much sodium.  Other than that, a very soft yet substantial biscuit to hold up under Sausage Cream gravy.  Not sure they would work for 'ham biscuits' as my Grandmother's baking powder biscuits do.

I don't ever attempt to roll out biscuit dough as the less you work it them more tender the result.  Just sprinkle the board with flour and dust the top or your hands with a bit more and 'pat' the dough to the right thickness.  Cut to size.  I go to a 1-1 1/4" thickness on these.

We use these both at fishing camp and hunting camp where we make them at least four days before we use them. We pack them in zip lock bags and they stay very fresh tasting.

My family loves these biscuits. They're the closest thing to the heavenly biscuits that my dear, Southern grandmother made every day of her life for fifty-plus years -- light and fluffy rather than heavy and tough. Yes, the dough is very wet, but if you use plenty of flour on your hands and to dust the work surface, it's not so difficult to manage.

Here's a tip -- my father suggested that the dough would make good dumplings. He was right! I used a basic recipe for chicken and dumplings to stew the chicken and make the broth. Then I whipped up a batch of the biscuit dough, patted it out pretty thinly, cut it into small strips (about 3/4" wide), tore the strips into suitable lengths and dropped them into the boiling broth. When making the dough for this purpose, I used the flour, sour cream and 7Up. I did not use any butter. The dumplings were very tender and fluffy.

I love these biscuits. I make them all the time. I do add  1 TBSP white sugar to mine.  And, yes they are very sticky, but stir them in the bowl with the back of a wooden spoon and catch as much of the flour as you can.  Then put them on a counter y your baking mix on it (not flour) and knead gently til you can pat out or roll out.

I used club soda in place of 7-up (since it was the only carbonated beverage I had on hand)....and lo and behold, no sticky dough issues.  I felt the 1/2 cup of butter was way too much so I basted the bottom and sides of the baking dish with butter and called it good.  Good recipe-thanks!

best biscuits ever!!! used sprite instead of 7 up, subbed buttermilk for half of the sour cream (only cuz low on groceries)... dont be scared of how sticky and wet they are, they are supposed to be--- for a true southern biscuit ( i'm from Macon, Georgia) this is what you do: get a big  pile( 4 cups maybe?? i don't measure)  of (not! self-rising!!!) flour, spread it out on a large towel as in a large even "spread" and dump that bowl of glorious, wet biscuit batter on top then start flipping and folding and gently kneading with the heel of your hand) you may even need to still add more flour, and dont be scared of how much 7-up you add in the beginning, either . CAREFUL  not to work the dough too much, you are not making pizza or yeast bread! but you flip and fold and work that flour in ,you know when the dough is ready when it  is dry enough to hold a shape and you can handle it easily)   then you  cut into rounds with a coffee cup. notice!!! do not use a rolling pin, ever! only your hands! right before cutting, you are pulling and stretching your dough into a large and thick  pizza shape dough. your biscuits will be lighter and rise more  cuz they didnt  get smashed down like a pie crust, trust me!  VIP :  put those biscuits right up to the sides of the pan and to each other--- you don't want them to spread too much,  you want a RISE- and put a thumb print in each biscuit before putting in the oven- this prevents them from looking like  muffins with a dome-- and your family

These biscuits are so good. Instead of making individual biscuits I just put all the dough in the 9x13 pan.  They came out great.

Holy cow!  I can't get over how great these are!  I didn't have any 7up on hand so I replaced with ginger ale.  They were awesome!  I would love some tips on working with the dough, though.  It's incredibly sticky and difficult to work with.

The biscuits were the centerpiece of our Christmas breakfast and everyone loved them. I used a tablespoon less sour cream than the recipe called for because thats all we had. I was also loose in measuring exactly four and a half cups of bisquick. I practically eyeballed it. Still came out perfect. Will definitely make again.

Excellent recipe. I have wanted to try to make these for years. I did increase the baking temp to 450 as they weren't getting done and I baked them for about 18 minutes. I did make them pretty thick so that was undoubtedly why. Will make these again for sure. The whole family loved them.

I use 4 cups of bisquick.  Instead of rolling them out, I use an ice cream scoop to scoop them into the pan.  Also, I melt the butter in the dish in the oven and drop the dough into the hot dish.  I prefer a glass baking dish.

I’ve been making these for at least two years & they are fantastic.  I’ve made a full amount & 1/2 amount & they are perfect.  I’ve rolled them out & used my biscuit cuttter or used two spoons to just put them in the butter.  Everything has worked out perfect & these are the only biscuits I make.

These are great! I make them for our church Wed night dinners. Everyone loves them. I don't roll out the dough. I just melt the butter in the pan then spread the dough over the butter and smooth it out (as best as you can), then bake. When they are done, I just cut into the size I need. I usually make them for Biscuits and Gravy, so the shape doesn't matter

Good easy recipe, especially for those who have never made or been successful at making homemade biscuits. Yes, the dough is wet, but I like that. I've been making biscuits for  over 60 years and I have NEVER rolled out biscuit dough! You pat it out. This recipe isn't quite as good as my biscuits but almost as good and a lot easier because there is no cutting in the shortening/butter. Let them cool a bit before buttering because they are light biscuits. I will definitely make them again!

No cooks note for flour option. Changes- no bisquick on hand so I subbed 4 c flour 2 tbsp baking powder, 1 1/2 tbsp salt, 1/2 tbsp sugar(opt.) for the bisquick. Used half in the bowl and half on the mat. Knead as little as possible and drown the pan with butter. You need all 4 cups sice Doug start super sticky. Just keep kneading in lightly the flour mix on the mat.

THESE were easy to make. I just dropped a dollop on the baking sheet instead of worrying about rolling them all out and everything . It makes a lot ... like 10 to 15 so it's good for a crowd

This is our family's favorite biscuits -- they're so easy for me to make, and *so* fluffy. I find I add about 1/2 cup more flour or baking mix as I work the dough on my bread board. I don't try to roll it out with a rolling pin, though -- that's hard on any biscuit dough, I think. I just pat it out and use my dough cutter/scraper to fold and turn it ... pat it out ... repeat once or twice. Then it's perfect for cutting and placing in the pan. OR, if I'm in a hurry, I just pat out the dough in the pan and then score it. Still awesome.

This is the only way I make biscuits anymore. It's such a simple recipe but the results are so soft and flavorful. The only tricky part is that the dough you get will be extremely sticky, so I usually just roll out the dough into a rectangle and cut out square biscuits instead of wrestling with the circle cutter. Definitely don't skip the butter step, it's a lot  I know but it's essential.

These are delicious, light & fluffy. Perfect with a little butter and a drizzle of honey, but also tasty just plain, and warm from the oven. Bonus: a big hit with the kids.

These biscuits were yummy and a huge hit with my family!! The only thing I had a hard time with is the dough was very soft and sticky and hard to work with. But I didn't let it discourage me, I just did a drop bisquit instead of a cut out!!

Delicious biscuits and easy to use recipe!  I had to leave mine in just a little longer, and needed a 2nd (smaller) dish for baking all the biscuits that this recipe makes.

Yummmmm!  We loved these biscuits so much.  I did have a little bit of trouble at first with the stickiness of the dough because I did not sprinkle enough flour on the dough ball before rolling out!   These were tender and moist, and so delicious we ate them plain.  Will absolutely make these again.

Biscuits were the first thing I learned to cook from scratch.  To say that this compares I cannot do.  I found the butter to make them quite greasy.  I didn't have enough room in the 9 x 13 so I put some in another pan without butter and found them to be much better.  I think it's more of a preference for me.  For the novice biscuit maker I think this recipe is just fine.

ONLY REASON FOR A  STAR IS IT WAS WAAAAAAAAAAAY TO STICKY WITH 1 CUP OF 7UP.  I HAD TO ADD MORE FLOUR TO MAKE IT WORKABLE.   WILL TRY 1/2C NEXT TIME.  THE FLAVOR IS A 5 STAR. I WILL TRY AGAIN.

My oven decided today to get stuck in broil mode so the first batch burned. I made a second batch and cooked in bottom of my double oven and they turned out really good. I'm not sure if I will use as much butter the next time but I did enjoy the crunch of the bottom which I'm sure was due to the butter. The dough is sticky but after reading the previous reviews I didn't use a rolling pin just put some mix on aluminum foil and dusted the top, patted out and cut out with no problem.

We loved these! I made exactly to the recipe. Turned out great. Was sticky as some of the reviews said,  I floured roller, my hands and even the rim of the wine glass I used and it worked great;  although next time I will flour with bisquick instead, as some of the reviews suggested. Turned out so moist and buttery. Will definitely make again!

Dough, at first, was very sticky, hard to work with.  I ended up using 5 cups of Bisquick,maybe a bit more.  Taste great though.  Great with strawberries and whip cream!

I love these biscuits but I just mix and drop the wet dough from my icecream scoop.   Kneading is so unnecessary.  They turn out fluffy and delicious.

Really, really gooey, even after following the advice of to dust hands with bisquick.  Needs much more time in the oven, but all said, quite delish.  I think it's the pool of butter that they sit in that really makes the difference.  Also decided to do drop biscuits rather tnan cut. .. still good.

My kids love this. Won't settle for the pre made ones anymore. Perfect for biscuits and gravy!

These are some of the easiest and best biscuits that I have made. My family loves them and my brother-in-law could almost eat a whole batch!

I tried this from another site but same recipe. Instead of rolling the dough I just scooped it in a baking dish big enough to  make 12 biscuits and used all the dough The recipe made and they were so so so good! My family loves them. I will never buy them from the store again ever!!

I would bake at a higher temperature to brown them better
