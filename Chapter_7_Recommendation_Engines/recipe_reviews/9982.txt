My husband and his golfing buddies absolutely love these. I use a sugar substitute instead so he can eat as many as he wants. I also made a batch with chopped nuts and raisins and one with coconut. Great as a healthy "movie" snack! Thanks.

I had no parchment paper so I put a layer of sugar on a sheet of aluminum foil and baked these. Super crispy super delicious. I substituted egg beaters for the eggs and used 1/2 cup blue bonnet 1/2 cup fat free I can't believe it's not butter spread and these turned out wonderfully. I also used 1/2 cup splenda 1/4 white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. All of these substitutions seemed to work well

Delicious. Spreads a lot and to a thickness of only fractions of an inch. To make it a bit more healthy use a bit less flour and add more oatmeal than the recipe asks for - this recipe can take it. Next time I might use less sugar or brown sugar instead... I'll post again with results.

If I could give these cookies a higher rating than "five stars" I would. They are an excellent thin crisp cookie. My husband wanted to know why I've "never made these before."

I'm impressed. I wouldn't say the taste is that amazing but they are nice and they don't have that floury and oaty taste that some oatmeal cookies do. I liked them because they are QUICK! 20 mins after I started I had cleaned up the kitchen and had some yummy hot cookies cooling down. My kind of baking!

Great recipe and SO easy. This one took only minutes to prepare. The cookies turned out crispy on the outside and slightly chewy in the middle. My family ate the whole batch by the end of the night. Thanks!

I just made these cookies and can't wait until my hubby and kids come home to try these cookies. I'm not big on sweets myself but really loved these cookies. I can't stop eating them. I might have to make another batch before my family gets home. I used old fashioned oats and all purpose flour. I will say that I was very nervous when dropping the cookies on the cookie sheet as they seemed really watery but they cooked up really crisp and yummy! Thanks for the recipe!!

I used a low-fat butter substitute (Bestlife) and Splenda and added a dash or two of cinnamon. Aaaand 20 minutes later I'm getting ready to make my second batch. Nope I know what you're thinking... the first ones did not get tossed out. Shameful I know... but the reviewer who called these things addicting was NOT kidding. The only complaint that I have is that I think to say that there are 18 cookies in the batch is a little misleading. I'd say it's closer to 12 if that. 18 sounds really tiny.

I adored these cookies. They weren't overly sweet and were just the right amount of crumbly. I actually had everything to make these already - which made me even happier. Thanks for posting!!!

Could these be any easier and tasty? I don't think so! I added a small handful of coconut and next time I'm going to add some finely chopped pecans. One bit of advice... double the recipe if you don't you'll find yourself making more very soon!

Easy but not what I thought it w/be. There was nothing crispy about this. It was like eating a buttery oatmeal cookie & I was looking for the lacy thin crisp of a cookie. I've found another recipe on another website that I'm going to try. These were good & hubby really liked but not what I thought it was.

Love these I even substituted smart balance olive oil spread for 1/4 of the butter. This recipe doesn't require minute oats even regular will do. Doesn't get any easier than this one-bowl recipe.

I love crispy cookies and these were awesome! I used raw cane sugar instead of white but everything else was by the recipe and they were melt-in-your-mouth good! One caution if your oven cooks a little hot or you are in a higher altitude watch them carefully to avoid burning. I had to take mine out at around 8 minutes. I will DEFINITELY be making these again!

Super easy recipe but only my edges were crispy. I will make again but adjust recipe a little and make them flatter for more even cooking.

They weren't as sweet as I would have liked but I did use wheat flour so that could be why. It is a very quick recipe but I would just stick to the regular oatmeal cookies next time.

Yummy! Make sure that you get the buttery cookie dough a bit flat so that it'll get crispy! At first I thought it had too much butter it was oozing out of the dough but I turned out perfectly fine! Took it to church and in a second they were all gone!:)

Other than using salted butter (unsalted tastes flat to me) I followed the recipe exactly and these cookies were AMAZING. SO good and SO quick and easy. Thirty minutes from start to clean-up. I'll be making these a LOT. Thanks for a great recipe!

I thought these were great! I also did 1/4 white sugar and 1/4 brown sugar which I really liked and I also added more oats to make them a little more thick...great taste! I really recommend these!

I thought these were pretty great but I was the only one in my house who enjoyed them. I loved the taste. I thought they were the perfect thin crispy cookie. Some of mine must not have cooked as long as the others because they turned out a little chewier but they were delicious too. If my whole family had loved them I would give them 5 stars. I don't know what they didn't like they just didn't enjoy them.

Easy sweet cookies. I wouldn't say they are fabulous but they are a thin little treat that can be whipped up in no time. I will try adding choc. chips or coconut or apple pieces next time.

This recipe is in my Mom's 1944 Better Homes & Gardens Cookbook. It's a family favorite due to its crispiness & flavor. It was my Daddy's favorite cookie ever. I add a little cinnamon nutmeg & clove to spice them up just a bit. Parchment paper is a must but I know my Mom & Gma never had suck stuff. I think they used brown paper.

They are ok but not crispy at all disappointing.
