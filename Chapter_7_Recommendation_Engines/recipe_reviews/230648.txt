Loved it, while I did change a few things, to my taste, which is the nice thing about veggie burgers. I used mashed black beans. 1/2 oats, 1/2 chopped green pepper, 2 chopped mushrooms, no water, 1/4 steak sauce, 3 Tbsp flour, 1 tsp cornstarch. no carrots, no celery.Garlic powder, onion powder, 1 tsp paprika and 1ts steak seasoning.I've only been not eating meat for a year out of my 50 years so I needed a good imposter for the real thing.

I used navy pea beans instead of adzuki beans.  Wonderful recipe because it goes together easily, cooks up nicely and tastes great!

im really amazed this recipe has so few reviews. it is absolutely wonderful! ive given it 4stars because I substituted AP flour instead but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. im allergic to eggs so this recipe was ideal for me. they held together perfectly.

I had to substitute oat flour for the rice flour, this may be the reason why these burgers were so gluey.  They had a good taste and looked like burgers.  I would try them again with the rice flour.

I didn't have the right flour, so the texture was a little off.  However, flavor was very good!

The texture was off and didn't give me a close enough feel to hamburger (I am not a vegan).  Tasted fine but I would rather stick to real meat for the few times I eat hamburgers.
