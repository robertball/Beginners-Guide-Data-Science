This was good.  I've made this several times but my husband is not a big fan of the soup so instead of the soup, I mixed 1/3 cup of butter, 1/3 cup flour, 1 3/4 cups of chicken broth (99% fat free) 2/3 cups of 2% milk. 1/4 tsp. pepper, 1/2 tsp. salt (optional)  Mix well. Whisk in sauce pan till thickens then pour over chicken and bake.

Our family is very busy and this recipe was perfect!  It was very quick and everyone thought it tasted great.  We had no bread crumbs and so I altered the recipe by just laying out the chicken flat in a large casserole dish, topped with the swiss cheese and then the ham and just baked it for about 15 minutes.  Then I topped it with the soup and cream sauce and baked it until the chicken was done.  It turned out wonderfully.  Next time I will try it with the bread crumb coating :)

This recipe tasted ok but didn't really work well. I found the cheese melted out of the chicken into the sauce which made the sauce yummy but the chicken rather bland. If I make this again I would dip the flattened chicken breasts in breadcrumbs, brown in the frypan then layer on a baking sheet & top with ham & cheese. I would make the sauce separately and serve with the chicken.

Made this for New Years and it was yummy. Made a couple changes.  After I rolled up chicken I coated with egg wash and rolled in a mix of half flour, half bread crumbs with paprika. Did not need toothpicks. Then I browned rolls which locks the moisture in the chicken.  Baked without sauce for about 30-40 minutes.  On the stove top I combined cream with cream of chicken with herbs soup and added swiss and cheddar to the sauce. we love cheese.  Very good next time i will just use milk for the sauce as cream is so fattening and did not taste much differnt.  THANKS for the recipe.

We enjoyed this recipe very much. Changes I made were to dip the rolled chicken in buttermilk before breading and refrigerating the breaded chicken for 30 mins so the breading would stick better. I also baked the chicken without the sauce as we wanted the crust to be a little crispy. I didn't have any cream so I just used milk, added fresh ground pepper, garlic powder and dried basil. It was wonderful spooned over the chicken.

THIS WAS AWESOME...My husband, 2, 3 AND 5 year old kids all ate it up. I used cream of mushroom because I was out of cream of chicken. I also used crushed Ritz instead of regular breadcrumbs. A KEEPER!

This wa delicious. The only changes I made was to add italian seasoning to the bread crumbs, and made my own sauce as my son is sensative to MSG (no canned soup). 1 tbsp butter melter, 1 tbsp flour, cook over heat for 1 min, add 1 cup chicken broth, and 1/2 cup milk for creamyness, simmer until think adding whatever spices you like, I added garlic, onion and pepper. I also added 2 cups of sauted fresh mixed mushrooms. Me and my son wait until chicken breast goes on sale and then make a ton of these, bread them, wrap them in saran and freeze them. The breading stays on great, but do not defrost them in the mic as the cheese will melt and leak out.

We really liked this recipe.  The second time I made it I marinated the chicken (after pounding it) in some Italian dressing (for about 2 hours) and used seasoned bread crumbs.  Yummmm!

This was a very quick & easy & yummy dish. I followed all instructions pretty much to a tee, but used no salt, used thick cut sweet ham from the deli, used reduced fat cream of chicken. I had to cook quite a bit longer than 15 minutes, I would estimate I cooked it about 45 minutes. It was very moist on the inside & the outside breading was wonderful! The cheese melted a little out, but not much. I did use swiss & monterrey jack & it tasted great. My fiancee kept telling me how good it was. As a side, I made plain white rice & chopped broccoli seperately & when they were both finished, I combined them, added some pepper & butter & scooped some of the sauce from the chicken dish into rice. It was soooo good.

Very good and easy.  The sauce is ok - I'm going to play around with it and come up with something equally as easy but a little better tasting.

This was a fast and easy recipe to do. It has become a family favorite.Pre browning the chicken before putting into the oven cuts baking time in half and the cheese doesn't melt out of the chicken before its done baking..

I have made this a few times now and my husband just RAVES over it! One suggestion is make sure that you pound the chicken EXTRA thin as this helps when you have to roll them up. Definitely a keeper!

Big hit with everyone, although I used breasts-butterflied and then pounded thin, also wrapped each roll tightly in Saran Wrap and threw in the fridge for a few hours, then finished the breading and browning, the rolls stayed together beautifully with minimal leaking.

I started following this recipe, then made changes as I went along. I cut up the chicken in 2" chunks, dipped them in beaten eggs, rolled them in cracker crumbs then fried in oil. I set this aside. In a casserole dish, I placed cooked rice, partially cooked broccoli, the chicken, diced ham and covered with a basic cream sauce. Then sprinkled the top with cheese and baked it in the oven. It was excellent.

I made this using egg first then breadcrumbs and I baked it without the sauce. I used 1/2wine 1/2water instead of cream and I spooned the sauce over after.

So.  Ridiculously.  Good.  As per other suggestions I browned the chicken first, and cooked the sauce separately.  I cooked it for about twenty minutes and served over egg noodles.  Thank you for the recipe!

We all loved it. I didn't bother browning the chicken (too much hassle with the toothpicks). I just cooked it in the oven without the sauce for 10 min. to brown, then added the sauce and cooked for 10 or 15 min. longer. I have made it for friends a couple times and it has been a hit everytime.

I subbed turkey for the ham and used pepper jack cheese instead of swiss.  This made a very moist chicken.  I recommend flavoring the bread crumbs if possible because my boyfriend thought this was a little plain.  I think adding medium hot breading mix to the bread crumbs would be a tasty addition.  Just something for a little extra kick.  I also served this with a side of quinoa and purple potatoes.

Such a great recipe. I made rice, instead of noodles...and it was DELISH! 
I also fried the chicken breast with ham and swiss inside, first, and then placed them in a baking dish, and put it in the oven at 200 to finish cooking off and stay warm while the rice was cooking. The cream of chicken soup and heavy whipping cream sauce was perfect...I added a couple dashes of garlic powder.

This was ok..  I don't usually make recipes with soup in them, but I made an exception this time.  I added some dried mustard, onion powder and a little white wine to the sauce to give it more flavor, and that helped.  Although I didn't like the breadcrumbs very much either.  I think I'll give the other cordon bleu's a try!

Super good and easy. The bread crumbs didn't stick to the chicken very well. Next time I will use egg.

I didn't have enough chicken or the condensed soup to make the full recipe, so I pared down the sauce suggestion from Cooking 101 below.  Took WAY longer to cook than 15 mins; it took mine 45 mins to cook all the way through.  Taste was good though, not too time intensive.

My husband and  I loved this!!  You have to pound the chicken breasts, though...make them fairly thin!!    It tastes like something way more fancy than a "weeknight"!

Excellent and not difficult!   Husband really enjoyed this and asked that I add this to my recipe collection!    Wish I knew how to prevent the cheese (I used provolone) from melting and oozing out.   I ended up adding a slice of cheese on top of each chicken breast.   Will definitely make again!

This turned out great and tasted absolutely wonderful!  I've already made it twice in less than a week.  The second time I didn't have the cream of chicken soup so I made a quick alfredo sauce instead.  Delicious either way!  I will most definitely make this again.

Great Recipe. My wonderful husband made the whole thing! He was so proud to serve it that night. This was the second time we've made it. Tastes good with any kind of cheese.

Great recipe. I put the prepared chicken rolls over a bag of baby spinach and then pour the soup mixture over that. Sprinkle with extra swiss cheese. I have also had luck using turkey instead of chicken. Serve with brown or wild rice.

"Weeknight" Chicken doesn't do this chicken justice.  Although I made a few minor tweaks I made it when I was short on time on a Sunday evening!  It was decadent for my husband and two boys! We will definitely have it again weekend or weeknight!

Excellent AND easy!  I started with thin-cut chicken breasts; they may have been a bit more expensive, but it's worth any time I saved.  I did season each piece of chicken with salt and pepper, although I will definitely skip the salt next time; in the end, it was slightly TOO salty.  I chose Provolone over Swiss and used deli thin-sliced honey ham.  I used olive oil for the browning, but I think I'll skip this step altogether next time; it just doesn't seem totally necessary.  The sauce was really good!  Who'd know it was a cream-of-something soup?  I added a lot of pepper at this point; pepper is a wonderful thing!  I can't say enough about how easy and truly delicious this is.  My family couldn't say enough about the delicious part either!

This was a hit with my fiancee!  He LOVES it and asks for it at least once a week.  I use an extra can of soup and cup of cream to make a little extra sauce.  It's great over rice!!  Wonderful recipe!

I thought it was good, and my parents liked it.  It took much longer to cook than 15 minutes though, may have been because I skipped browning the chicken in oil first.  The sauce however is wonderful!  I added some swiss cheese and served it on the side and it was great!  Especially good over asparagus.

My husband told all his coworkers and his parents about the wonderful dinner I made him.  I substituted canadian bacon and provolone (thanks for the suggestions fellow recipie hunters.) I skipped the heavy cream and borrowed half the sauce to pour over veggies and rice.  Yum.  My husband insists that I make this again soon.  =)

This recipe is EXCELLENT!!!
I made a few changes the second time. I didn't have heavy cream so I used whole milk. also i used cream of chicken with herbs!! soo yummy! I rolled it with chicken thighs. i love it when the cheese runs out it makes the sauce really yummy. and we added extra cheese on top!! this is a great recipe!! i absolutly love it. my husbands always compliments me when i cook this! :) He is Filipino so we eat everything with rice. but it is great with rice. the sauce is wonderful!! :)

Family loved it. I would use milk instead of cream next time- it was a bit rich. Won't use salt either- enough salty flavor from the ham. Will make again, for sure

I liked this recipe a lot but I had to cook mine longer than the recipe stated.  Maybe I didn't pound the chicken thin enough.  It still turned out really good and I loved the sauce.

This was very good.  I also made a few changes: I used buttermilk as another reviewer suggeted, and decided to use mozzarella on mine since I am not a swiss cheese fan.  They turned out very good.  Thank you for the post.

I served this at a dinner party with a few picky eaters.  It was a smashing success.  All of my party-goers raved about it.  I would use Half and Half next time, to thin the sauce a bit.  I will definitely make this again.

Great easy recipe.
21 month old ate her share then proceeded to mothers' plate.
Next time will try to use 1 cup of milk instead of cream, to have enough sauce to pour over noodles or some kind of pasta

Most favorite recipe!! It takes no time at all to put this together and looks like you spent all day! I could eat this every night! I always double the amount of meat and cheese in each chicken. Just gives it more flavor!

A very tasty and easy dish! I also used the thin-cut chicken breasts and did not add any salt.  The dish turned out very well and was simply delicious.  My husband loved the sauce in this dish -- you would never guess it is a cream of chicken soup.  Thumbs up!

Soo easy and delicious!  A huge hit with my family, will definitely make again.  I used provolone instead of swiss (personal preference) and used a little garlic powder seasoning as well.

Quick and tasty dinner that my BF loved.  The only changes I made to it were... I was out of breadcrumbs so I made my own.  The soft breadcrumbs gave it a thicker coating.  I baked the chicken without the sauce and that made the outside layer extra crunchy.  I added dried parsley to the sauce to give it a "herbed" looked.  All in all, this was a great recipe.

This recipe is easy and GREAT!!  Since I am not a swiss cheese fan, I used provolone cheese instead.  I doubled the cream of chicken soup and heavy cream for extra sauce, and served over egg noodles.  I also used italian style bread crumbs.  I will definitely make this recipe over and over again.  My family LOVED it. I have shared this recipe with all my family and co-workers.  THANKS!!

Wonderful recipe!!  I did make a few changes due to what I had on hand.  I did not have Swiss cheese, so I used White American, did not have cream so I used milk and I did not bake the chicken in the gravy, but served the gravy seperately over mashed potatoes.  Will definately make again and again!!! Thank you!

Great Recipie!  My family loved it really enjoyed the sauce.  Serve the sauce on the side.  No need to brown before baking.  No need to pound chicken breast if you buy thin sliced chicken breasts instead of the regular ones, it will roll up much easier.

Wonderful!  The cream sauce mkaes this dish.  My family and neighbors LOVED it!  Very easy to make.  I cooked for 40 minutes instead of 15.  Also, I tried the provolone cheese and buttermilk like a previous rater suggested and it was so good!!  You will love this one!

Another hit at my house! These were very simple to make. My only complaint -- might actually be my own fault. I don't think I pounded the chicken breasts "thin" enough. They didn't roll up well and ham and cheese was sticking out. Otherwise, they tasted great, even warmed up the next day.  Wonderful!  I'll definitely make them again.

Awesome recipe.  I will definately be making this again.  I made this for my husband and myself.  It is very good and very filling.  I have even eaten it as leftovers.  I did use half and half instead of the heavy cream and I did add a bit of wine to give it a stronger flavor.  It did take a little while to put together, but even as a mother to 14 month old triplets, it is well worth the time spent making it.  Enjoy, we did!

This was such a hit at our family get together!  
My only problem was that I accidently left a piece of the waxed paper that was in between the swiss cheese slices.  OOOps  That was embarrasing.  It was so good otherwise.

My husband really loved this recipe.  The only changes I made was that I used honey ham and I really enjoyed the slight sweetness.  I didn't have any cream, so just used milk.  Also used provolone instead of swiss.  Great quick and easy recipe.

Great recipe!  I didn't have any cream on hand, but this still came out delicious.  I added garlic powder to the breadcrumbs, and some shredded cheese to the sauce to make it richer.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious! I added provolone cheese and used Sarah Lee brown sugar ham- gave it a nice flavor. I'd like to try cream of mushroom with this for a different twist. Also, this didn't make a lot of extra sauce for pasta, so I'll double next time. Yum! Thanks for the recipe!

A miracle occurred in my kitchen. All three children and my husband loved dinner. This is a great recipe! I skipped cooking the chicken in a skillet, though, just for time reasons and added a packet of powdered ranch dressing to the bread crumbs. It was fabulous! Everyone asked for seconds.

This was easy to do and turned out pretty good.  You could easily not do the sauce part of the recipe and still have a great tasting chicken dish.

this was very good...I didnt have bread crumbs or toothpicks so I just rolled them put them in a 9x13 pan and baked them in the oven at temp recomended for alittle longer (till juices run clear)they didnt unroll and cheese stayed inside. Very good I didnt even miss the breading at all...served with sauce over rice and noodles

This was quite tasty. My husband loved it too. I don't eat meat, so I added cooked rice and rolled my chicken. Very yummy! Also good w/out the sauce. I made it the 2nd time w/out it.

Easy and delicious!  No need to brown it first, either.  Definitely takes more than 15 minutes to bake. Makes tons of sauce.  I didn't use much sauce on my piece. I didn't think it needed it. This doesn't need the sauce to make it juicy and flavorful.  Serving the sauce on the side saves calories, too!

This was so easy, and delicious.  I even messed up the recipe and it was still good!  I forgot to brown the chicken before baking it.  But the oven made the breadcrumbs get nice and crusty.  I am going to skip that step again next time.

Followed other reviewers and cooked the chicken without the sauce, served sauce on the side.  It turned out very nice -- although next time I will add a little more flavor to the sauce.

Best recipe I have made yet! Big family hit..sauce is great just the way it is, I cooked the chicken breasts longer than suggested,30-45 minutes and cutting chicken breasts length wise if they are big)made them a lot easier to roll. Great for leftovers!!!

Great dinner for family and friends. Browned chicken in margarine, sauted fresh mushrooms, added to soup mix with drippings. Used milk, was still plenty rich. Just before taking out of oven, put slice of provalone cheese on each breast. Great results!!  Definite keeper!!

So easy, and tasty too. I pounded, rolled up with some deli honey ham I needed to use up, put on some shredded cheddar(out of swiss), stuck in a few toothpicks. A little dusting of garlic powder and some s&p, dipped in buttermilk(something else I needed to use), into some panko and then a hot skillet. Browned, put in 13x9. Mixed in some buttermilk with a can of cream of chicken, spooned over, covered and cooked till up to temperature. About 45 minutes, my chicken was still pretty thick. Thanks for an easy weeknight recipe!

So easy and fast.   Tasted great.    Added a few slices of Swiss to the sauce and allowed to melt down.   Required 35 minutes for interior temp to get high enough.

I used honey wheat bread crumbs and it turned out even better. It was surprisingly easier to make then I thought it would. It only took 10 minutes of actual prep time so I will definitely add this to my usual weekly recipe box.

Very Delicious. The only thing I tweaked was I Seran wrapped the chicken after breading it and let it sit in the fridge for an hour (this helped the breadcrumbs stick better). I also cooked the chicken in the air fryer, I recommend spraying the breadcrumbs with PAM first and air frying it at 380 degrees for 20-25 mins (flipping chicken halfway through). Then I added the sauce to it at the end. I made a simple rice pilaf (using Sarah's Rice Pilaf recipe from AllRecipes minus the chicken broth) and mixed veggies. The sauce gave everything so much flavor, super tasty!

So yummy! I substituted the ham with bacon (because that's what I had at home, and bacon makes everything better) and the swiss cheese with muenster. I'll definitely be making it again. My husband loves cordon bleu and this is an easy recipe to make even with a busy schedule.

My children loved it, but I thought the sauce that's on top of it is too rich. Also, I had to cook it for almost twice the time suggested to cook the chicken breasts throughout

My husband and I LOVED this recipe.  I didn’t have Swiss cheese so I added mozerrella. Also, I added a package of dry ranch dressing to the sauce before pouring over the chicken. Gave it a really nice flavor. Definitely will make this again.

Everyone loved this.  Next time I'll add a little more cheese.  I made the sauce, but I put in way too much pepper.  I added brown sugar to counteract the pepper.  This really made the sauce terrific.

It turned out pretty good! I liked the soup mix on top. I’d definitely cook it 20-25 minutes instead though, 15 minutes isn’t long enough.

came out pretty good..for the most part I followed the recipe but i seasoned the chicken more with garlic powder and onion powder and mixed the bread crumbs with flour. I also sprinkled some parmesan cheese on top to give it a little extra flavor. cream of chicken sauce was good, didn't realize something so simple would go so well with cordon bleu. I will make it again but I think I will try to flatten out the breasts next time or buy it like that to save time.

It was delicious!! The only thing I did differently was only put some of the sauce on the chicken when I put it in the oven to cook. I let the rest of the sauce stay warm on the stove top, then when chicken was done cooking I added more sauce.

I followed the recipe exactly.  the sauce had a nice flavor but could have used more depth.   Be sure to brown the chicken well in the skillet before putting in the oven with the sauce over it, to avoid it getting too soggy.

This would have gotten 5 stars except that it did not cook with the time stated. It was still raw after the pan fry, and 15 min in oven. I had to continue to cook an additional 25 minutes.

I've got to say this is only about the 2nd recipe that makes me feel like a gourmet cook in my Central African home!  Of course, I didn't have the exact ingredients so instead of ham and swiss cheese I used bacon bits and mozzarella.  I had to make my own condensed soup (about the easiest thing ever to do with a thick white sauce and chicken bouillon.)  BUT I did have cream.  Who could know you shouldn't guard your precious cream just for desserts?!  I was really pleased to discover I could do all the cooking on the top of my stove since turning on my oven in the evening really heats up my house.  I left the chicken in the frying pan, added the sauce and covered the pan.  I turned the burner to low and used my stove top spacer ring to move the pan off the direct heat and it was done in the same amount of time.

I read many of the reviews and incorporated several into my dish.    I didn't have a good tool to flatten the chicken and had purchased large breasts so I cut them in half , breaded them and then fried them in a small amount of olive oil.   I then placed  one half of the chicken breast in the pan, cheese, ham and topped it with the other half.  And like another reviewer, I used 1% milk instead of the heavy cream due to the calorie content.   When it was all said and done the dish was delicious and I will make it again.

I used another reviewers hint to lay the chicken breast flat, layer the cordon bleu ingredients on top without rolling and bake..! It was perfect! I'll never roll again! It wasn't too thick, it was juicy and every bite was perfect with this amazing recipe. Side note, I didn't have heavy cream but used buttermilk to coat my chicken and milk with the soup and it was delish!

Chicken Cordon Bleu is not hard to make, but I thank you for the inspiration!

I made breadcrumbs by taking a loaf of Italian bread before it turned, sliced it and drizzled olive oil and chicken stock, sprinkled rosemary and thyme (fresh from the garden), baked it at midway until it was dry, not burnt, then used the magic bullet to pulverize.

I split three fat chicken breasts into six filets, added ham and swiss, rolled 'em, browned them in olive oil with garlic pepper salt, and baked 'em for 10 min at 350.

Made a simple sauce as suggested from condensed cream of chicken soup mixed with half & half, pepper, salt, etc.

Served with steamed broc, carrots, snap peas, and water chesnuts. Loosening my belt buckle as we speak.

I was nervous about making this, my husbands favorite dish is Cordon Blue. He LOVED it!!!!!! I used two pieces of Black Forest ham on each roll and I instead put the chicken on a oven safe rack over a baking sheet so that it wouldn't get soggy. I added the sauce after as well to keep the bread crumbs texture. This was a definite hit and super easy to make! I will be making future tweaks to it to see how much I can improve it, but it is by far the best Cordon Blue we've had!!!

This was good. It was also my first attempt at making chicken cordon bleu, so I was pleasantly surprised at the results. I tried following the recipe exactly as it's written, but browning the chicken in a pan did not work out for me. The chicken pieces kept falling apart, so I gave up and just went ahead and put them in a 9 x 13 baking dish and into the oven they went. I baked them for 40 minutes, then poured the cream mixture on top, and baked them for an additional 15 minutes. The chicken pieces stayed together, and everything cooked just fine by skipping the browning step. 

I do agree with other reviewers who suggested using milk instead of heavy cream to save on fat and calories. I think the taste would be the same, so I'll plan to make that change next time. I seasoned the chicken with liberal amounts of salt and pepper before dredging them in milk and bread crumbs, but I still thought the flavor of the chicken was a little bland. Next time I will probably try some additional spices.

My whole family said they would eat this again, so it's a keeper for me.   The only thing I changed was using half and half instead of the heavy cream in the sauce.  I will make it again.

Okay.  I made a few adjustments, due to the size of the breasts.  I used deli sliced cherrywood smoked ham, because of the thicker cut.  I did brown the breaded chicken, added about a third of a cup of pinot grigio to the sauce (3/4's of a mini-bottle), and had it in the oven for 40 minutes.

Best damned chicken I ever made.  Came out buttery tender and moist.  Here is the view, coming out of the oven.

This was good, didn't take too long either. I added 1/2 slice of swiss on top before adding sauce. I also added some fresh thyme to the sauce. Thanks for a nice recipe.

My family really enjoyed this recipe. We did not have the sauce as we're not big on them and I forgot to make this one. I used corn flake crumbs and a taco blend of cheese since these were what I had on hand. I also didn't brown on the stove top but cooked them for 45 minutes as others suggested in the oven. Without the sauce the coating on the chicken came out crispy. We'll be making these again!

I didn't have any cream of chicken soup, so I used cream of mushroom instead. It added a really nice flavor, and I think I'll continue to use it. I also used mozzarella instead of Swiss. Didn't make much of a difference, and I usually have mozzarella around so it's easier. Overall, I really loved this recipe. It got added to my monthly rotation of meals!

This was time consuming but delicious. I would not have time to make it on a weeknight. For the sauce, I misread the recipe and mixed the soup with sour cream but it was fine.

This dish was so good!! My husband and I have been wanting to try something different for dinner, so I logged on to Allrecipes and saw this recipe for Cordon Bleu and tried it.  It was excellent.  I'm deffinately making this again!
