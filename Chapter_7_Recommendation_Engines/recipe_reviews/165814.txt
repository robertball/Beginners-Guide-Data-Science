I tried this drink years ago while on vacation with friends and I had to have the recipe.  I've made it several times and have only one suggestion.  When transfering to bottles or jars, use a new knee high nylon over a hand strainer to help cut down on the "pulp".  You will have to rinse it often.  Oh, also, try warming it up in the microwave.  Thats the only way i drink it. :)

This was very good, and fragrant.  Recieved compliments.  Served in a crock pot and set the everclear on the side for people to choose to use it or not.  Next time, take the cinnamon sticks out afterboiling, and put into cups.  That way the presentation is still beautiful, but the whole bowl isn't too cinnamon-y.

I have had this EXACT recipe for years and always have a steady supply in the fridge once deer hunting season comes around. We ARE deer camp. my tips--- SIMMER for 2-3 hours!!!  put as much back in the gallon jugs after its finished. very easy to store in fridge and then just a screw cap on it. BUT make it a week or two ahead of time! then put 3 sticks in each gallon jugs and let it sit in the fridge- every couple days shake them up. this way you wont even taste the everclear- if you make it right you wont even know it has alcohol in it. the longer it sits the less alcohol you wil taste. as i dont like hard alcohol i make it early so i can celebrate a downed deer with my husband and all his friends! OH- and make SURE you have a big funnel-- that two bucks at walmart will prevent you from moping a huge mess up in the kitchen. good luck and enjoy!!

this was very good, we gave it to our friends for the holidays. I let the juices simmer for an hour so the liquid would reduce. It worked out great. thanks

I've had this before, but never made it. This was so easy and soooo good! Taking it on a canoe trip as well as keeping some for weekend campfires! Besides cin stix, I added several dashes of ground cinnamon & a little nutmeg, as well as followed someone elses suggestion to added a little vanilla after it cools... all I can say is FABULOUS!!

I really did not care for this drink recipe.  I used Everclear, and all I could taste (and smell) was the grain alcohol.  I'm not sure what I could have tweaked to make the recipe more palatable.  I served it to about 20 people, and it received mixed reviews, so perhaps it is just a matter of preference.

I tried this recipe and fell in love! I am going to make it for a drink at my wedding instead of wine at the tables. I was going to can it to prevent it from going bad. The problem is I have never canned anything before! I can't seem to find anything online about canning liquids.... does anyone know how much head space should be left and how long to process it for??? Any information would be helpful :)

Love this! We usually make half a recipe since it's such a large amount. We use sugar to taste, but I believe we come close to the amount called for, maybe a little more! Sugar helps mask the flavor of Everclear. This is so yummy and the apple juice with cinnamon sticks smells awesome while cooking! Don't add the Everclear to the juice until the juice is completely cooled down after cooking.

I have requests for this year round.  I only add 1 cup of sugar or splenda, and I always place a fresh cinnamon stick in each jar.  I boil the lids and rings and actually "can" the apple pie, no refridgeration is necessary and if you can keep it around long enough will last a year or more!

Excellent cold weather drink!  Big hit with everyone.  One difference I tried and liked was using Red Hot candies instead of the cinnamon sticks for a spicy spin on this classic.

we make this all the time -- you do not have to put sugar -- it is already sweet enough without it... we throw a little nutmeg in it also when getting ready to simmer...... let it simmer for at least 2-3 hours... then cool at least 30 minutes before adding everclear........

I just had a friend of mine make me a batch of this, she is more a jack and coke person, so she thought this was too sweet, but I love it!  I have given 2 bottles away to family because everyone loves it!  I can't wait to make some myself, but watch out ! It can sneak up on you real quick because you don't taste the everclear!

I made this for a Christmas party and it was a HUGE hit! You can leave it all together for people to serve themselves but I found it nice that everyone had their own glass to go with it automatically when they picked the jar up.

Tastes amazing - followed directions exactly (except made a half batch)  and it came out perfect.  We liked it best after chilling in the fridge.

Notice the recipe states: Add Sugar "TO TASTE" so TASTE IT to see if it's sweet enough for you before you add more sugar. Same goes for the alcohol. If you don't like that much then don't use that much. It's simple! But in my opinion, this recipe rocks AS IS!  Another note: it doesn't take as much time as the notes above say. Follow the directions exactly and stick it in the fridge to cool if you're in a hurry. When it cools enough to add the alcohol then have at it. This is an awesome recipe! Our friends and family love it. We get phone calls every Fall asking for the recipe.

We have made this drink for our Howl-O-Ween Bonfire for many years now.  I like that this recipe doesn't call for as much sugar. I make 2 gallons at a time and have more and more requests for it each year!

I Love this recipe! This is our favorite 'go-to' drink, we make it all the time. I let the juice simmer for an hour or so, then I'll throw a hand full of red hot candies in the cider while it's simmering for a little extra cinnamon flavor. I like to use 1/2 c white sugar and 3/4 c brown sugar.. I think it makes it taste more like apple pie. If you're using moonshine instead of everclear, I'd add and extra 1/4 c of sugar and make sure you give it time to mellow. The most important thing to know about this recipe is that it needs to Mellow. As hard as it is sometimes.. bottle it up and put it away. Open up a jar in three months and THEN decide what you think of this recipe. OMG, amazing.

Great Stuff :o)
Taste is EVERYTHING so, 
Spare no expense, use "Martinelli's" Apple juice

A few tweaks make it perfect for me, my family and friends.

2-cups white sugar AND 1-cup brown sugar, add Vanilla AND Nutmeg as well...
Just those little changes made a world of difference...ENJOY !! :O)

I loved it, and so did my husband, mother, and several other friends and relatives!  I scaled it down to a much smaller batch, but will be making the full batch next time!  I did not have any cinnamon sticks, so I poured a heap of cinnamon powder in a coffee filter, and tied it closed... it steaped like a tea bag!

Good recipe but I used 2 cups of white sugar and 2 cups of brown sugar...it made it a little sweeter and you didn't taste the Everclear as much! It sure is yummy though! :) Warms you up on a cool fall night for sure!

I made this for Christmas as gifts for a few people and I got rave reviews.  They liked it so much they gave me back the empty bottles so I can make more!!  It was fantastic, it tasted exactly like apple pie, this is the kind of drink that can sneak up on you.

Yum!  Had last night with Fireball 40% (cinnamon Whisky from New Orl.) instead, no sugar, added hot water to cut sweetness, skinny slice of lemon-rinsed apple on rim.  We had a foot of snow here on Vancouver Island last night....ski season is coming!!

For those of u who think this is too sweat, try the following receipe (it's the one I use). 1 gal apple cider, 64 oz apple juice, 5 cinnamon sticks, add everclear.  Bring the juice and cinnamon sticks to boil, remove the empty sticks and add the alcohol.  I do not use the whole pint or admit it altogether if making it for the kids.

Just some notes:
Do NOT use juice or cider from concentrate. It will taste bad and lose most of its flavor when boiled.

Other than that you can pretty much make this drink to taste.
+/- sugar, cinnamon as you like.
Simmer longer for lower liquidity.

I make this at home - this recipe will make up to 9 quarts - so get 9 cinnamon sticks to boil with and add to the jars when you pour it in - I also add in 1 1/2 cups of light brown sugar - by the time you add in the Everclear, figure it around 25-30 proof - taste even better heated up!

I used this recipe as my base and then I added a little ground clove, brown sugar, and vanilla to my drink mixture. Just kept adding until taste. Makes it taste more like real apple pie. Cannot wait till Christmas to share this drink, sure beats the normal cookie exchange.

Tldr: It's really good. Just follow the recipe.  I've made this about 4 times.  It's always a pleaser.  Great for parties, and everyone is astounded by it.  Works well too. I don't know what folks are on about saying all they could taste was the booze, that's my favorite part about it. With 190 proof everclear it might as well not be alcoholic untill it hits you.  And it will hit you. Hard. 


Two BIG BIG cautions though.  Make VERY sure you have a lot of containers on hand.  It's clearly not going to just fit into the two gallon large jugs from the apple juice, and it's a real big hassle to try and get it into the everclear bottle. 


AND make sure to have a big ol pot to cook it up in.  For some reason the first time I tried to make it I thought 2+ gallons of liquid would fit onto a large  cooking pot.  So I was under prepared and ended up having to use every pot I own to make it.  So get a very large cooking pot. I bought one just for making Apple pie, it is about a foot and a half tall and was about $10 from general dollar.  


Overall, you get a lot of booze for about $28-30.00.  That's estimating $19.99 for the everclear (I get the liter or medium sized bottle of the strong stuff.) and about 4 or 5 dollars per gallon of apple juice and cider.   F. Y. I. It's much easier to acquire the necessary amounts of cider in October or November.  If you can't find it around the juices a lot of the time it's in the "seasonal/fall" groceries. 


That's all I've got.

I've made this for years & I add 4 cups of sugar & let it simmer until the cinnamon sticks start to uncurl. Also run it through a strainer to fibers from the cinnamon out. I've see people commenting that all they can taste & smell is the everclear. I always hear that they can't even tell there's any alcohol in it. It keeps in the fridge forever. We've had it last for over a year. If you keep it that long the everclear taste does come out more. If that happens just add some more apple juice

Very sweet.  I wouldn't sit and eat an entire apple pie and I couldn't drink an entire glass of this either.  Way too sweet.  Maybe next time I will try with no sugar or atleast sugar free apple juice.

This really is a good holiday drink. Had it in a drinking fountain and it was the nights popular drink. I did not want to make it so strong with ever clear since we had guest driving in from out of town. I substituted it with Captain morgans spiced rum. This turned out well. At first we made a sample of it with vodka, but the popular vote was the spiced rum. We also tried it with apple vodka, cinnamon swirl vodka, and both were too sweat.  The spiced rum won.

I have been making this for our annual Halloween party for the past several years. I use about 3 cups of sugar in my recipe and it's always a huge hit. I have to make several batches by request each year.

I originally tried the crockpot version, however it had way to much cinnamon flavor to it. The one thing that I did change up was that I replaced half of the ever clear with Vanilla Bean Sky Vodka and what a difference it made! It actually made it more dangerous because you really couldn't taste the ever clear because the vodka mellowed it out but it still had the kick! People are sending in requests for Christmas already!

Way too sweet. I found a different recipe that calls for just the cider, cinnamon and vanilla vodka- I found that one to be a good balance.

Be careful just to stick with one cinnamon stick in a jar or it tastes like red hots. Good stuff though added captain Morgan spiced rum delicious

Everyone loves this! My notes - 1) boil w/the stix but remove when cooled.  2) Peel apples and cut at least 9 rings an put them in the canning jars - they're a special treat :)  3) I cover the jars with cheese cloth while filling

Delicious!  Could definitely cut the sugar down by about 1/3 if you would like.

Great recipe. This drink has been a favorite of mine but I always got it from friends.  This recipe was great and was even better after a few months in the fridge.  We noticed the flavors got better the longer it sat.  I will be making this recipe again.

Not a everclear fan so instead I put in Capt. Morgans spiced rum 100 proof.  Gives it a bit more apple pie spice taste .  I give it away for Christmas but make sure I have plenty of my own as this is a great drink on chilly nites by the firepit.

I make this recipe every Fall.  I usually do half white and half brown sugar, but I think this year I'm going to try cutting the sweetness back just a bit.  I also always add half a cup of vanilla vodka when I add the Everclear. Yummm!!!

I made this and it was delicious. I will say I did not go completely by the directions. I doubled the apple juice, apple cider and cinnamon sticks. I simmered it for 12 hours. Then the store only had 750 ml of Everclear bottles, so I bought three and used all of them. I completely forgot the sugar which was fine because it was sweet enough. We could barely taste the alcohol, the only way we knew it was there was the warmth in are throats and chest. Completely underestimated how much alcohol was in there and my friends party was a hit because I brought these along.
