This is one of those recipes that use a long list of ingredients in a vain attempt to create a complex flavor. Cream cheese + Sour Cream + Whipping Cream = Redundant Calories. Cut the creams down to one…I recommend sour cream to keep the potatoes creamy and not too dense. Cream cheese works well too…just choose one or the other. If you need to adjust the consistency, try a little milk. The sugar is pointless – there’s not enough to make even a slight flavor difference in so many potatoes. The chicken bouillon does make a nice flavor enhancer for potatoes, but if you use it, cut the soy sauce.

The ingredients sound a bit strange but it works! I left out the cream cheese, only because I realized I was out at the last minute, but it was still really good.  It tasted a little like those french fried onions you put on green bean casserole.  I will definitely make again (with cream cheese the next time).

"OH MY GOD!!!!!" were the 1st 3 words out of about 5 peoples mouths when they tasted these today.  What a hit.  I doubled the recipe and there were almost no leftovers :)   Thanks babybeeks.

If you take to heart any review, please let this be the one. I have been in the kitchen for a long time and feel I truly know what people love to eat. You MUST try this potato recipe. I substituted 1/2 TB kosher salt for the soy sauce because I was out but other than that, followed to a T using red potatoes. It's creamy, flavorful, rich but not overwhelming, complex but totally familiar. It's the perfect mashed potato dish. Nevermind the other reviews that claim too much is going on. This will be on my table for every holiday and many nights in between. Excellent!

I didn't have all the ingredients, for ex:whipping cream, parm cheese, parsley, but nonetheless this was amazing!! I loved them! this is definitely a no fail recipe! You wont have to follow it to the T. It's an awesome blueprint to add and remove to your own tastes. Excellent 5 stars I say!

I'm only giving this one 4 stars because there was just too much going on, flavor-wise. They were yummy, that's for sure - don't know about "addictive" though. I'll make them again, but I'll probably leave out a few ingredients, like the soy sauce and the chicken bouillon granules. They both added a lot of salt and I thought they were kind of unnecessary. Other than that, very tasty! Oh, and good news, you can make them ahead of time and reheat them just fine if you know you're not going to have time to make them the night that you need them.

The best mashed potatoes ever! I made them for my parents and in-laws and everyone loved them. I used half and half instead of whipping cream, because the store was out. They were so good, we had to lick the beaters so none would go to waste!

Luv, luv, luv this!  I ran out of sour cream today, so just added a little more cream cheese.  Used FF half and half rather than whipping cream, otherwise, followed the directions as written.  The thing that puts these potatoes over the top is the caramelized onion, so don't cheat there and not take the time to brown them correctly...low and slow.  Decadent?  Absolutely.  Worth the splurge?  ABSOLUTELY!!  UPDATE 11.25.11:  I warmed this up in the slow cooker for yesterday's T-Day dinner, and unfortunately, the mashed potatoes turned an unappealing brown color from the caramelized onions (I'm guessing).  This is still a 5-star recipe and still tasted good, but it's just not a candidate for a slow cooker warm-up.

These are now a tradition at my home. Its a little more work gathering the ingredients but this side dish might just out-shine whatever you are serving it with! By the way, caramelizing the onions takes time but they are heavenly!

I thought maybe this would end up tasting like something from TGIF or Applebees...just ended up tasting like flavors that didn't blend well.

Excellent recipe!  Yes, it's a bit of work for mashed potatoes, but definitely worth it, especially for a nice steak dinner.  They are good reheated the next day.

I followed the recipe and I hoped these would be better. They were ok, but not addicting. My boyfriend didn't like them and covered them in gravy to hide the weird flavors. Our roommate liked them, he's a "meat and potatoes" kind-of-guy, and these were potatoes so he liked them. I thought the sour cream and parmesan gave an odd sour tart taste. For my roommate I'll make this again, but my boyfriend refuses to have  them without gravy.

This was a nice side dish I used for Christmas dinner.  Preparation was not difficult, and the dish was a hit.  I used low fat replacements where possible (eg:  The cream cheese, sour cream, and parmisean cheese).  I would recommend this recipe.

I tried this out on my family and now I am REQUIRED to make them for EVERY holiday dinner - "Bring the potatos, or you can't come!" ;o)
I usually do a 3lb bag of potatos and kinda eyeball the amounts of added ingredients (whipping, cream, etc.) but they always come out great!!! Addictive, for sure!

These potatoes are definately addictive. My son hates any kind of gravy or sauce on anything, so I was looking for some potatoes that would be great on their own.  These were a hit!! We all love them and I've had to share this recipe with many family members and friends.  Definately try the way the recipe states first before making any adjustments.

Not bad, but definitely not worth the calories/ fat grams or time and effort.  I love mashed potatoes so was looking for a recipe that would encourage my children to like them too!  No such luck, and very heavy, though that isn't a surprise.  Save your time and just use the onions, butter and some salt and (I recommend white) pepper!

I thought they were tasty.  My roommate and I both agreed that they were a slight bit thick and dry...Perhaps some more cream to smooth it out.  But wonderful taste!

This is an awesome change of pace for potatoes.  I can see how some people might think it's too salty but that can easily be adjusted by dropping the soy sauce or using a low sodium brand.  I loved the mix of flavors.  My kids can't get enough of these truly *-addictive-* mashed potatoes!!

In the end, these were WAY too salty for us. Next time, I'll make them as directed and leave out the chicken granules and the soy sauce until the end, and then add them in  to taste after I've tried it.

The name is totally appropriate ... They are addictive.  I made them for a family gathering and none were left.  I made them for an office luncheon and none were left... Everybody...including the men...wanted the recipe.  I followed the recipe as written.  OMG

I tried these for the first time 4 years ago for a family Christmas dinner.  They were the biggest focus on the whole meal, unbelievably divine.  I'm not much of a potatoes connoisseur but these are worth writing a review.  We now reserve these potatoes for "Holiday Dinners" and family will down right request them, "are you making Addictive Potatoes!?"  Please add them to your families traditional plates for Holiday Dinners, you won't be disappointed.  Oh...and don't change a thing to the recipe, they are perfect!!!

Thanks Laura from Alberta, Canada

The taste was great but they turned out a little thin.  Either more potatoes or less soft ingredients.

This recipe is by far the best mashed potato recipe I’ve ever made and it was a hit with everyone... The only thing that I did not use from the recipe was the chicken granules because I realized I did not have any and it was still fantastic

This is my first time making mashed potatoes. I did make some small modifications as follows. 1) I wasn't sure about using quite so much bouillon, so I tasted as I went along, and decided to go with less based on salt content. 2) I live in a country with limited potato selection (Morocco), so I had to use different potatoes. I don't even know what they're called. And 3) since our potatoes are a bit gooey and I cannot find a masher here, I used a fork and wooden spoon to mash, *not* an electric mixer, which I was afraid would make my tates too sticky. .. 

These modifications aside, I followed the recipe.  With regard to bouillon, unless you have a low sodium option on hand, I'd ease in on that. 

Overall, I like this recipe a lot, and I bet I'll make it again! The husband took a bit, looked confused, then said "mmm."  I guess that's a win!

OMGoodness!  I left out onions as we have picky eaters that don't like them, so I used onion salt.  These are the best mashed potato's ever!

The name says it all!! Highly addictive because they are so good.  I made them exactly like the recipe except I crumble a chicken bouillon cube as I didn't have granules. A big hit with my husband, too.

Made this twice , each time it was delicious each time.
Made the potatoes with the skins on and added a little garlic to the onions after they were cooking for ten minutes or so.

These were the best mashed potatoes I have EVER made/eaten. Don't be discouraged by the long list of ingredients. This recipe is worth the time and effort! I left some of the skin on my potatoes for extra texture and flavor but other than that, i wouldn't change a thing!
