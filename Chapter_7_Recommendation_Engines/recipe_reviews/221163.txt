I did this two ways -- one with a short brine (because I couldn't wait another day) and one with an overnight brine. Definitely worth the wait! The chops were juicy and delicious!

Very moist chops. I always get the bone-in thick cuts when grilling. It's a must! Also have noticed that many users of Brine recipes in general comment that it's "too salty" Perhaps they are using table salt as opposed to Kosher.

These were amazing! I had center cut, boneless chops from the supermarket (maybe 1" thick) that I brined for 6 hours. I grilled for a few minutes on each side until they reached 145. My kids don't like barbecue sauce, so I did half plain & the other half I basted with Sticky Fingers Carolina Classic barbecue sauce. Both turned out fabulous.! Just watch your temperature it would be a shame to overcook.

Loved these chops! I cut the salt to 1/4c (would use 1/8c next time), but otherwise followed recipe. Deeelicious! So moist, juicy & tender. Cut a bnls pork loin into 1" chops & they came out perfect. Try this with his Carolina BBQ sauce - excellent! Thank you Chef John - I love your videos & all the recipes I've made so far!

Beautiful color but very little added in the way of flavor or juiciness. There was absolutely NO clove flavor whatsoever. I will try again and maybe brush the chops with a molasses and ground clove mixture. These also cry out for pepper.

I LOVED  this! i grew up on molasses so was obvious i would like this, but being in a brine it does become quite salty, so try to pair with a sweet salad, or sweet potato, if salads scared you! Will make again!

These are great!  I only had about 2.5lbs of chops so I cut the salt down to 1/4 cup and only used about 4 cups of cold water.  We grilled these and they were pefect!  Lots of great flavor!  I also made a Carolina style BBQ sauce on the side which added just the right amount of mustard/vinegar base to complement the molasses.

I just finished grilling these pork chops after marinating them in the brine about 5 hours.  They were so tender and moist and I had one thinner pork chop and one thicker which didn't matter- both were super tender.  The Carolina barbecue sauce was the bomb- most excellent.  This recipe is a keeper!

Very good!  Rainy night so ended up cooking in the oven.  They turned out very juicy.  By the way, if you omit the salt, you are marinating your pork chops, not brining them.

We thought it was excellent.  We used 2 thick & 2 regular chops. We brined them with extra cloves overnight & they turned out great. Watching the temperature I think made a lot of difference on the grill. Thanks Chef John.

I actually made this twice.  I saw someone's review where they marinated for 2 days and it was very good and not salty.  I had some boneless sirloin chops that were very thick  that I bought on sale.  We had cooked some on the grill first without marinating them and they were very tough.  I knew I had to find something since I had bought  30 lbs (They were .99 lb sale).  I marinated the first batch 6 or 8 hours and they were good.  More tender, but delicious and did not taste overly salty to us and we use very little salt here.  I, at the same time, marinated some for 2 days like the reviewer I read.  OMG, so much better.  Super tender and juicy. Could practically cut with a fork.  Not salty at all.  Even leftovers right out of the refridge were tender and still juicy.  This is my go to marinade for pork to be grilled now.  We used no other sauce or spices.  Love it!

Edit - I forgot.  I did not use cloves.  I did not have any, but I did add  sage leaves, which gave it a subtle, but good flavor.  I did not measure, I just dropped some in.

Made half recipe of brine. Used four loin chops, each one-inch thick (two pounds).  Chops two and a half inches thick would be a small roast to me!  Used 7 X 11 Pyrex to brine; chops just fit.  Have half of the brine left over.  (I poured the brine over the chops; when the pan was full I had half the brine left over...about two cups.  The brine I saved  did not come into contact with the pork.)  Poked each chop four times with a fork.  Did not use cloves.  Cooked chops on the stovetop using a meat thermometer.  Still I overcooked them a bit.  They were much better than the pork chops I usually make!  I would use this recipe again.

The color was beautiful, and they were tender, but all I could taste was salt. I followed the recipe as written and did use kosher salt. Even my son, who loves salty things and loves pork chops was put off by these. I'll try again, but will cut the salt and perhaps increase molasses.

Too salty! I used half the brine and one Tablespoon less salt than the recipe called for. No more moist than a regular chop.

This was a little salty. And i even rinsed the chops before grilling.Will cut the salt next time. Used with his bar b q suggestion. Also had high quality Duroc pork so hope I didn't ruin them by brining them. But had a lot of compliments.

You can make this without the salt. Just leave out the salt. 
The pork chops turn out nice and moist with out the salt.

Whenever I tell my husband we're having pork chops for dinner, I see his shoulders sag.  The pork chops he envisions are those of his childhood:  chops you could pound nails with!  What a pleasure to eat these chops, so moist.  I followed the written recipe and also jaccarded the chops before putting them in the brine.  Rather than grilling (14 degrees outside), I used  my trusty cast iron pan.  Next time I make these for dinner I'll increase the cloves and include a bit of liquid smoke.

Our barbeque gave up the ghost so I had to use my George Foreman grill. The flavor of the chops was good, but they weren't as tender as I had hoped they would be. I'll try it again and change the cooking time, or maybe try them in the oven.

Mmmm, such juicy and flavorful chops! I left them in the brine for about 4 hours and the flavor really penetrated and brought the chops to the next level! This is my method from now on; thanks, Chef John! YUM!

I used this recipe for pork chops and let them sit in fridge overnight.  They were flavorful and almost fork tender.

Excellent flavor without seasoning being overstated. Following prep and cooking times produced a tender, flavorful chop. I will cook these again. My only diversion was to allow my 1” thick chops to cook to a slightly higher internal temp and then take them off and foil wrap/rest them for 10 min. before serving.

last weeks dinner was a hit! only modification was clove powder vs cloves 
.(is what I had on hand) 

I made this with thin and 1.5 inch chops and only brined for 5.5hrs. Obviously I cooked the small one less time.....anywho totally delish, juicy, all kids 2, 4, and 12 gobbled it up and we will be doing this again and hopefully I will get longer time to brine.

Put chops in brine overnight. They were juicy and delicious! Just like Chef John said, I'll never not brine chops again!

I followed the recipe without any changes. It was excellent. The favor was delicious and the pork chops were perfectly tender.  I have already had requests to make it again.

Because life got in the way of our dinner plans, the pork chops sat in the brine for two and half days. The chops were very tender and full of flavor!

Hesitant about a molasses based brining solution but tried it anyway. The whole family loved the chops.  
Wife put recipe right into her binder.

Outstanding flavor, juiciness, and texture.  I will absolutely make these chops again, but with 1.5 inch chops, as these were just too much meat.  Great recipe!

Thank you C. John.   Chops grilled on the Barbie were fab.    Would like to BBQ again, but as I am in Canada I would have to wade through 5 feet of snow to get to the Barbie.   Will the brined chops be as good baked in the oven?

This brine was awesome.  One point - you must use a thick chop or it will be too salty for you!!  If you are concerned about too much salt, cut it back by  2 TBSP.  These were a big hit with teenage boys who are super picky eaters!!

Followed all the steps as written, came out moist and juicy, even after grilling for longer than recommended (my wife will not touch meat that is not cooked all the way, what a shame). Chef John's Carolina BBQ sauce paired deliciously well with it.

Great for thick chops that tend to get tough. I cut the brine in half for 6 pork chops, and it was perfect, marinated about 18 hours. They were so tasty we didn't even need to baste them with barbecue sauce on the grill, just served it on the side.

Chef John, this is a perfect brine recipe. I marinated my center cut chops for 24 hours in this and, oh man, the best moist and delicious chops ever. Thank you very much once again Chef John.

The molasses and cloves really don't dominate the flavour of these chops but instead adds a very subtle flavour that is delicious. I had thick boneless pork loin chops and put them in my quick marinator for a total of 1 hour. I didn't oil the chops, totally forgot, and it wasn't missed. Another great recipe Chef John, thanks!! 31-5-16

Fantastic! This was the juiciest grilled pork I have ever tasted (& I'm not a pork fan, I only make it because Hubby likes it)!!  I did feel the pork was a tad bit to salty, next time I am going to reduce the salt.  I did make the Carolina sauce to accompany the pork and felt it really did not need it. I followed the recipe exactly and let the pork soak in the brine for about 10 hours. Will absolutely be using this method again & again for grilled pork!

I have used this recipe multiple times and I NEVER get tired of it!    I typically don't deviate from recipes but I do add about a half cup of honey to this to smooth out the saltiness. I have never had anything less than rave reviews using this recipe and don't hesitate to show it to anybody that asks!

Loved these pork chops!  I tried this method for the first time with guests and I'm so happy that they turned out awesome.  The only modification...I used 1/4 c. kosher salt vs the 1/2 c. cause I got nervous with that much salt. Everyone loved them...grilled them on charcoal, so juicy and full of flavor.  I also made the Carolina-Style Barbecue Sauce and that was a match made in heaven!  Beautiful parring.  I even made extra to try with some smoked pulled pork I'll be doing later in the week.  Will do again...thanks for sharing!

I had purchased a large quantity of very thick pork chops and the first time I grilled a few, they were dried out by the time they were done.  After using this recipe, they were moist and delicious and the brine was unassuming - it didn't take away from the flavour of the chops.  Everyone requested the recipe.  Yum.  Thank you!
