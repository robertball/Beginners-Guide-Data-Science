First I should say that I am not really the one to be rating mac salad, as I am not a fan of it.  Surprisingly, this is one of the few American dishes that my husband loves, and when I saw there were olives in this(family owns olive orchards), I knew I had to make it for him.  I followed the recipe to the 't'..down to measuring w/measuring cups.  The only subs I made were red onion instead of vidallia (for color) and used both green and black olives. I also had half of a cucumber left over from some cuke sauce so I finely chopped the half small cuke and added that. I thought I had written the recipe down wrong and had omitted eggs.  I have never made mac salad w/o eggs before but did not miss them.  My husband loved this and I too, liked it very much.  It was not real sweet, which is my problem w/liking mac salad....(that darned ole' sweet pickle relish).  There was a nice balance of vegetable flavor; one was not too overpowering of the other.  I added salt at the end because our olives come from hubby's family and are pretty heavily brined.  This is the salad I will make from now on.

Fairly basic and average macaroni salad. Since the "creamy salad dressing" called for wasn't specific, I used Buttermilk Ranch. I couldn't resist adding dillweed--this really needed more flavor.

i made this for a bbq at my house today and i think it was really good. i only made a couple small changes. i used red onion since its what i had and i used ranch for the creamy salad dressing. i also added in 2 teaspoons of minced garlic and used red bell pepper for the green. i thought this wasnt moist enough after i chilled it so i added a little more milk and it was fine. good crunch from the celery. thank you

Even though I have always hated the creamy salad dressing, I used it in this recipe and it was great. I love Macaroni salad, but mine never came out any good til now. I have made this several times.

This was easy, fast & delicious.  I used fat free mayo.  I didn't have any celery so I used small jar of chopped pimento (drained) and a little extra green pepper and onion.  Also added a little ground celery seed and dill.  SCRUMPTUOUS!

I loved this salad!  I normally hate macaroni salad.  This was exceptional.  I loved it-without any substitutions or omissions (although Vidalia onions weren't available so we used another sweet kind of onion).

I actually added some things to this, as to get it combine salads that my husband loves. I added a cup of diced Colby/Jack, a cup of froze peas, a cup of diced sweet pickles, and I didn't put in the vinager... I also sprinkled about a Tablespoonful of dried Ranch dressing... EXCELLENT base recipe, thank you so much!!!

This salad was a winner at my last party.  It is light and different.  I hate macaroni salad with too much mayo and eggs.  This one only uses a few ingredents with a big impact.  No mayo or eggs!! Hurray!

Delish! Didnt have celery, so I used celery salt, added dill weed, pimentos, couple pinches of sugar and about 1 T vinegar, for half of the amount of mac in the recipe.

fantastic macaroni salad. I don't usually like macaroni salad so was looking for one that was not sweet. This fit the bill exactly. I did use mayo instead of dressing and I didn't have green peppers so used a cucumber (remove seeds) instead. will be making this on a regular basis this summer

This wasn't bad at all. I used mayo instead of dressing. I used a chopper for the celery, onion & olives so they were tiny pieces instead of chunks and I had to add spices as it was somewhat bland. I added celery salt & celery seed with the salt & pepper. Next time I will NOT use the chopper and I will probably add cucumber & red pepper also. Thanks.

My husband too LOVES Olives! I used bottled Casear Dressing instead of making as stated because that was the closest thing I had to a "creamy" dressing.  Worked fabulously!

Pretty good stuff. I don't like celery so I just added more peppers and it came out quite well.

In the South, we typically have pasta salads that put a whole new meaning on heavy, and this was by far the best change of pace ever! This is light, healthy (if you make it that way) and had a wonderful, Med. taste! I changed it up just a bit. I used Helman's low-fat Mayo and ran out, so ended up using two heaping spoonfuls of non-fat plain yogurt in addition to the mixture. I bought a can of olives, pitted them over the bowl so the olive juice could soak into the salad, and then tore them up. It added such an awesome flavor and for people who don't like olives, this lets them get a hint of the olive flavor without having to muster the strength to have the whole olive. I also chose to add some diced ham to mine as well. Awesome recipe, thanks!

This was perfect! I was looking for a recipe with black olives and without sugar, and this is the one I'm using from now on. Followed it to the 'T,' no changes. I also like that you can mix it up, with regards to vegies. Sometimes I use onion, sometimes not. Sometimes I use yellow pepper. It's all good. Thanks for sharing! :)

Made this for a party and it was a hit. Love that there's no mayo or eggs. I used a light ranch dressing, substituted carrots for the celery, and used red pepper instead of green. The salad comes out light and tasty...very fresh.

Very nice macaroni salad.  I was afraid that the black olives would dominate the salad, but the flavors mixed together really nicely.  This was very good leftover.  My husband enjoyed taking it to work for lunch!

Great macaroni salad-just like Mom used to make.  I subbed peppercini for the bell pepper, and used a little sweet pickle relish, and yogurt instead of milk in the dressing as we like it a little creamier.

A great alternative to sweet macaroni salads. This is just like Mom's. The second time I made it I was out of celery and substituted celery seed - it turned out just fine. It was the first thing to disappear at our latest family gathering and the cooks in the family wanted the recipe.

Seems like everyone else loved it, but I didn't.  Maybe I screwed up, but it was very acidic tasting.  I wouldn't put as much cider vinegar in it, and maybe not as much onion.  It wasn't creamy enough either, so I added more creamy mayo.  It still didn't turn out well though.  Blaw tasting.  Sorry!

Very good.  I added a little sugar because it was a little acidic for me.  Will make again.

This is a very good basic macaroni salad. I first found this recipe about 8 years ago and its my go to recipe for macaroni salad now. I get a lot of positive feedback when I take it to gatherings and my family loves it.

I make it as is. Sometimes I forget the milk and it doesn't seem to matter at all.

5 stars!!!   This was awesome!  I did change it up a bit using red onion, red yellow and green peppers omitting the celery and adding little soul seasoning, cumin, dill, dry parsley, and 1/2 mayo and 1/2 bottled bacon ranch.  I am about to make a second batch in one week!! Beautiful color... sorry no pic here. JB
