Wayyyyyyyy too sweet. I would use only 2 TBS brown sugar in the topping mix and forget mixing it in the meat mixture. Also needed some additional salt and pepper. Not sure I would make it again though.

I used fresh apple slices instead of apple pie filling with some cinnamon and some lemon juice. It didn't stay together as nicely, but it helped cut some of the sweetness. I would also use less brown sugar like Jodyrose recommended to cut more of the sweetness. Overall, I loved it and my family loved it. I will definitely make it again, but maybe only for holidays because its rather involved.
