We thought this was yummy! Just a few things...I used 1 cup of peas and carrots b/c the kids love them. Also, I was running low on tumeric, so I only used a teaspoon, but that seemed fine for us and still gave the rice a bright, beautiful color. Lastly, 1 cup of water to 1 cup of rice is off if you are using regular white rice, so just follow the liquid to rice ratio  on the back of the rice package to ensure proper cooking. We enjoyed the flavors in this and it was so easy to make...I will be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Made as written and I probably wouldn't change a thing. I might use broth in place of the bouillon as mentioned in the footnotes as I usually do but I honestly think it needed the salt the bouillon brought to the dish. Good recipe that would pair well with many different things!

I think 1 tablespoon of turmeric was too much for this recipe; it tasted very bitter.

We really liked this rice! I do however agree with Christina about the water ratio, should be 2 cups instead of 1. Will make again, thanks Nevine :)

It was good. I added carrots and peas, as someone suggested, to make it richer. Served with roasted chicken breast.
