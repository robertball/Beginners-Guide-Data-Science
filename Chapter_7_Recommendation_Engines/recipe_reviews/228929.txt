I was not pleased with this recipe as is.   I made it exactly as the recipe stated and found it to be very thick.  It was almost like a paste.   I think it needed some olive oil added to smooth it out and make it creamier.

Tweak this and get some flavour in there! Double the garlic and double the lemon. I had some nice tahini for tnis but you can substitute peanut butter.

I thought this was allright. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used a homemade tahini. I found it to be kind of thick, so I added a couple spoons of water. I really had to work at gettting it all blended using the tamper tool on my Vitamix mixer, for about 2 minutes or more, on high. I felt like it was missing something, I am thinking a spice of some kind. I have had better and worse. However, this would work fine in a pinch.

I had to add some olive oil, about 1/4 cup, but very good.
