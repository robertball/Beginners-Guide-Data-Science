I searched this morning for a recipe that I could make for breakfast with only limited ingredients and I found this.  I was skeptical as I was making it, that it would turn out bland and hockey-puckish.  I was surprised.  I made mine in muffin cups and used a leftover can of white frosting for the topping instead of choc sauce.  My kids really liked it, and it was easy and did not require a lot of ingred.  I would make it again (in fact, they made me promise that I would make it again!)  Thanks Aimee!

These looked terrible but taste really good.  Next time I will attempt to shape the dough so that they look better.  Thanks for the recipe!

I love cinnamon and I added a little more.  I did not eat with chocolate syrup; I ate mine with a pat of butter.These are great little "cakey" biscuits.  I might try adding a little ground ginger to give it a little different kick. I might try again and make them a little smaller; think they would be great for breakfast.

Pretty good. This is more like bread than cake, but still tasty. When I was making them, it looked like it need more liquid so I added some extra milk and stirred it by using my hands...the texture looked a lot better.

These remind me more of scones than cake.  Quick, easy, very yummy.  I served with butter and honey instead of chocolate syrup.  Will definitely make again.

Very good.   tried them with strawberry and carmel sryup as I didn't have chocolate.   Kids really enjoyed them.
