This beverage is wonderful.  For years, I've tried to learn to "appreciate" the herbal bitterness of Campari, to no avail.  The adding of sweet vermouth, is the ticket for me.  Thanks for sharing.
By the way, this Vodka drinker has found that it can be substituted for the gin!
Cheers,
Jeff

I drink this cocktail frequently, especially during the Summer months. The Compari is a bit sour for me, so I always add a dash of orange juice.

Great recipes! I prefer a Parisian-style Negroni.
