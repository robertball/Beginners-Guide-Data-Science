The concept is great but the total cooking time is overkill. I skipped the boiling and browning and cooked in the oven only. My squid were small and hard to stuff but turned out really good. Because I skipped the final skillet cook and in doing so spaced out the sesame seeds but still good. Larger squid is the key here if you can find them...
