This was my first attempt at pumpkin pie, and it was wonderful. The only problem I had was that there was too much filling for a normal pie crust, so you may want to try a deep dish crust instead. I combined cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and ginger instead of using pre-combined pumpkin pie spice. I'll definitely make this again!

Great!  I used a deep dish pie crust, so had to adjust the baking and temp.  3/4 of the way I reduced the temp to 325 and cooked an additional 20 mins....larger pie takes a little longer to set the middle.  Turned down temp so I didn't burn the edges waiting for the center to set.  Everyone loved this pie!

This is exactly how I normally make pumpkin pies, except normally I would use 2 whole eggs instead of the egg substitute. The brown sugar adds such a nice flavour and 1 tbsp of Pumpkin Pie Spice adds the perfect amount of spiciness. I used fresh pumpkin that I had frozen, I let it drain overnight in a cheesecloth lined collander. The only thing I changed was the baking temperature, pumpkin pies are normally started at 450 for 10 minutes then turned down to 350 for the remainder, which was 30 minutes in my oven.

Takes a lot longer than one hour.
