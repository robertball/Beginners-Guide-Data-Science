This is THE recipe for potato salad. I usually alter the recipes I find on this website, but this one was perfect as is. When you think of potato salad, this is what you are thinking about.

This was my first time making potato salad.  It was quick and easy.  I left out the peas, but it was still good.  Thanks

great recipe, simple to follow. i triple the recipe for a BBQ gathering.  i omitted celery and frozen peas as i ran out of it and instead substitue with freshly picked spring onions.  Turns out superb and every one loves it. taste even better the next day (left a small portion only and i dont want to waste)

This is a really good potato salad recipe, especially if you want to play around with it a bit.  It's simple so it can be suited to taste.
