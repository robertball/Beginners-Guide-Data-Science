These are wonderful. The powdered sugar gives the cookies a very soft texture and they're not overpoweringly sweet so they pair very nicely with the jam (we used lemon and fig). If you live at a high altitude or have an older oven you should expect to bake them for a little longer--ours took about 22 minutes to fully cook through.

I was looking for a quick thumbprint cookie that didn't require refrigeration, and here was Chef John's recipe to save the day! Perfect shortbread, tastes fantastic, and looks beautiful! The texture of the shortbread is perfection, and the buttery not-too-sweet flavor compliments the jam wonderfully. Can't say enough good things about these cookies!  I used apricot and blackberry jams, and skipped the icing. I got 16 cookies out of this recipe, and they took about 17 minutes to bake. Thank you Chef John!

Possibly the best thumbprint...ever.  The dough is to die for.  It's tender and melts in your mouth.  I have tried many others over the 20+ years of baking and giving special holiday bakes as gifts.  In fact, I had all but abandoned the prospect of finding a good thumbprint dough recipe.  After 5 years of experimenting, I stopped trying because of the irritation with the waste of home made jams and jellies in the trial process.  This recipe has changed my attitude toward these beautiful and colorful cookies.  I even went out and purchased some high-end jelly for a second batch!!  Love it!!  Thanks for sharing.

The cookies are amazing, although I typically need to add more butter to get them to where they are the right texture. Following the recipe for me seems to have them turn out too dry when trying to form them into balls.

I am so happy with the results!  They are super easy, full of fluffy buttery flavour and a slight taste of almond.  I piped the icing and I am thrilled with the look.  Thanks  Chef John or should I say "Mitzi"

These are amazing I have made these cookies about 4 times and every time someone has always complimented them.  I always forget that jam is hot and it will burn your tongue if you eat them right after you take them out of the oven but who can really resist. ;)

I followed the exact recipe and OMG! A great recipe for beginners. It was the first thing I baked - easy, quick, fuss-free. Out-of-this-world taste experience.

I had a lot of difficulty with this recipe only because my cookies kept cracking when I pressed them down. Eventually, I just gave up and tried to press the cookie back together so the cracks were not showing...I followed the recipe exactly so I’m at a loss as to why I had this issue. At least they tasted good!

I thought rolling them in sugar was not going to be a good texture, but wow was I wrong! These are amazing. I used leftover homemade apricot cobbler filling. Cant wait to try with strawberries!

I really liked how these turned out, albeit they were a bit dry. Going to try again with a little less flour!
