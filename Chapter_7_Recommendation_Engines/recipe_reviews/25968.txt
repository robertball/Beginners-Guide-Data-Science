This was a very rich and yummy cake.  I used frozen blueberries and since I did not have the leftover juice, I just made a glaze from powdered sugar and milk.  It was a hit!

This cake has everything.  Totally delicious!  I used a white cake mix, fresh blueberries, and put a lemon glaze on top.  Wonderful!

I thought the cake was very tasty. I served this to my mother in law who liked it very much. We did make one change to the recipe I used lemon cake mix and instead of BLUE icing I added lemon juice. Nice flavour combination.

Awesome cake!  I subsituted the vanilla pudding for Cheesecake pudding, I used the French Vanilla cake mix as suggested. I also subsituted the oil for applesauce and used fat free cream cheese.  I used fresh blueberries.  This was very good a definite keeper at my house!

This was moist and delicious.  It didn't look too good though probably because the blueberry glaze was too blue for me.  Next time I will try a lemon glaze instead.   When I bake the cake I left out 2 TBSP of the sugar in the batter and next time will leave out all together.  Not sure why it is added anyway the cake is very sweet.  My guests all loved it.  I felt sorry for the other dessert as people came back for seconds of this cake.  I know this group of people well and I don't remember anyone eating seconds of dessert before.  I just sent the recipe to one of them who asked for it too  I had it again for breakfast and it was even moister this morning. I will definitely make again.

This is was a fantastic cake! I used frozen blueberries, half in the cake, half for the topping. I pourred a little water over the remaining berries,strained them, then added sweetener and cornstarch to the juice, let it thicken on the stove, then added the blueberries.
Great with icecream too!

i really liked the results. a tender moist cake that's not too sweet. i followed some of the suggestions and used lemon cake mix and lemon pudding.  this makes a very thick batter, i had to add 1/4 c water or my mixer would have not been able to handle the thick batter. lemon lovers this is your cake!

Absolutely sinful. I could easily have eaten way more than I allowed myself to eat! Pretty much followed the recipe to a T, except I used a tube pan. I also doubled the glaze recipe as it was such a pretty purple color and I knew it would look gorgeous on top of that cake! Thanks for a stellar, easy, quick recipe. I will be making this again!

The title of this cake makes it sound ridiculously hard. It wasn't though; don't let this intimidate you. My cake didn't turn out as beautiful as the picture :( probably because I didn't have a bundt pan. SO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ONE! The very center of my cake wasn't baked that well; if it was a bundt pan it would have come out perfect. I really thought I would taste some cream cheese in the cake; but I barely did, which dissapointed me because I'm a cream cheese fan. After tasting the mixture, it was so sweet. Too sweet, if I may add. To lessen the sweetness and make it a bit more sour, I added some of the juice from the blueberry can and mixed it. Before adding the icing, I thought the cake would be kind of boring if it was all by itself + icing. So finally I decided to cut the cake RIGHT in the middle and add my own cream in there. I mixed sour cream with sugar (an old Russian tradition) and placed in the center. I put both sides together and it looked like a huge blueberry cookie! After, I added the icing; it turned out purple. The purple kind of intimidated people; purple icing on a cookie-like cake? Very strange. At the gathering, people were hesitant to try it, but everyone loved it! It was very sweet and moist, like someone said before. To conclude this review, if you're looking for a little more in this cake, I suggest the Russian creme (sour cream + sugar). This will definetly spice things up ! Hope this long review was worth it.

5 stars isn't enough. AMAZING. Moist, tender, tasty. I made with the exact recipe ingredients, but I didn't mix in the blueberries. Instead I coated them with flour and then spread them evenly in the middle layer, along with the cinnamon and sugar. Topped with rest of blueberries not put in middle layer and then sort of pushed them into the batter with a knife. Then topped with rest of cinnamon and sugar mix.  The whole family LOVED this. I'm a cake decorator, and  I have picky eaters who are used to eating the best, most moist cakes, and they LOVED this!! THANKS

I have made this cake four times, witht he fourth time being the best. It had too much liquid and, after experimenting, I ended up using 1/2 cup oil. I only made this cake with canned blueberries once. The absolute best is to use fresh blueberries, I used about 1 1/2 cup of fresh blueberries, reserving about 2 T. of blueberries and mixing them with a little water to make the drizzle icing.

I have to say the pic turned me off a bit. But, in my experience the cake did brown up well. I tried the blue glaze, but will forgo it in the future. People were reluctant to try it although everyone who did found it delicious. Scraping the bowl up several times is key to perfect distribution of ingredients, in this, and in all baking. I used a mix that does not have the pudding in it, and because I have a hard time finding one that is 18.5oz I keep an extra one around to weigh the extra ounces (anal? I know). I also used a can of Oregon brand blueberries, which weighs 15oz so I threw in a several WILD blueberries (no comparison with regular berries!) to make sure there were plenty, and they tasted so much better than the canned (and if you aren't going to make the glaze there is no reason for the can-I think some of the "blah" reviews may be because of tasteless berries).This is rich, and I think the cream cheese helps make a somewhat pound cake like texture (by the way-pound cake is supposed to be dense) and goes a long way toward masking the boxed cake flavor-though still there! I haven't had anyone guess, though I've been to culinary school, so no one would believe I sometimes use a cake mix. I will leave out the extra sugar next time. As with all cooking, the quality of the ingredients heavily influences the outcome, so don't skimp on generic products.Sometimes a bit of money saved ends up in all the money spent wasted.

Great way to doctor up a boxed cake mix.  I used about 3 tablespoons of the reserved blueberry juice to make the glaze.  Two tablespoons were not enough to make the glaze drizzling consistency.

This is a delicious cake, very moist and great with coffee.  Trust me on this...use a cream cheese icing with a couple tablespoons of the blueberry juice instead of the glaze (the glaze is not good at all).  I have made it this way several times, including for my husband's employees and it is so very good.

Excellent cake, so moist!  I was a bit worried when the mixing stage came into play.  The batter was so thick my mixer was having a hard time mixing. You will have to take a spoon and transfer the batter to the pan.  Well worth the extra effort.

I wish I could give this cake more than just 5 stars!!! It is soooo good. I followed the recipe all the way, didn't change anything. The smell while it was cooking was just soooo good. Couldn't wait to eat it and when I did all my expectations were met. Thanks so much!!!!

This recipe was devilishly good.  I added about 2 cups of frozen blueberries, and only had lemon pudding, so I added that.  It was awesome!  I also made a powdered sugar glaze and then made a quick blueberry sauce.

I thought this was the best blueberry cake I have ever tasted. 
My husband and mother in law both loved it. The glaze was also very good. 
I will definitely make this again.

This was so good the 1st time around, that I'm making it again 2 days later, substituting canned dark cherries for the blueberries.  Anticipating it will be just as good as the 1st one.  I will definitely make this again!

Outstanding! Instead of the canned blueberries, I did substitute about 2 cups of frozen blueberries tossed in a small amount of flour (I did not thaw before using). Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. This is definitely one I'll make again. Thanks!

Moist and delicious!
I would highly recommend making this at least one day, if not two, ahead of time. Pound cakes get better each day, and by day two this cake was so delicious! I made a thinner glaze and served the extra glaze in a small bowl alongside the cake.

Obviously the cake is as delicious as I thought.  We were only 8 people and there were not even crumbs at the end! I used lemon cake and French vanilla pudding. There is NO NEED….repeat…NO NEED of sugar…(and I love sweet but this cake is sweet enough as it is!). I also used fresh blueberries and lemon drizzle. Next time I will use another type of pudding but definitely a keeper!

I am going to rate this a 5 star because of the ease and the taste of this recipe. Extremely moist and full of flavor. However I had to bake it 15 minutes longer than recommended. I have had compliments and reguests for the recipe which is always a good sign! I have also tried it with a lemon cake mix which is the way I prefer. I also used frozen blueberries. Delicious!

I got a lot of compliments on this cake.  Very good and very moist.  Like others, I experimented with the pudding/cake combo, using white butter recipe cake and lemon pudding.  I also added some lemon juice to the water, substituted apple sauce for the oil, and omitted the sugar.  To make the cake more visually appealing, I halved the batter, adding blueberries (and the 1/4 sugar and some kirch) to one half.  I then layered the plain and blueberry batters, using a knife to marbelize.  I then topped with a simple lemon/orange glaze.  Another suggestion - to omit the creamcheese flavor, just substitute 1 c. sour cream.

I have baked variations of this recipe numerous times over the past two years or so. Each incarnation of this recipe is devoured by everyone who comes in contact with it. My basic changes to the recipe are just out of preference: I use white cake mix instead of yellow, canola oil instead of any heavier oils, neufchatel instead of cream cheese, and I make a buttercream frosting instead of the glaze (save all of the strained blueberry juice from the can, whip some butter (1-1.5 sticks per your taste), add plenty of powdered sugar and a good portion of the blueberry juice, as well as a splash of vanilla extract--I mix it in the mixer until the taste suits me, then throw it into high speed to whip it up a bit). Another success has been to try different flavors like using lemon cake mix, lemon pudding, no blueberries, and using a blend of lemon extract and milk instead of the blueberry juice in the frosting. I've also done variations with strawberry and chocolate.

Best Blueberry Cake EVER! I have made it again and again with someone almost always wanting the recipe. I hardly ever put a topping on it as it is very sweet without. Even better the second day (if it last that long!) I use about two cups of fresh or frozen blueberries in place of a can of blueberries. Thanks for a great recipe:)

Great cake. Made it twice in one week. The first one, I used lemon instant pudding mix and the second one french vanilla pudding mix. Used fresh blueberries in both. Both cakes were really good but, my family preferred the one with the french vanilla pudding.

Great starting point for a moist, rich blueberry pound cake!  You have to have fun experimenting with flavors in this one: I added 1 tsp. maple flavoring and 1 tsp. cinnamon, and the flavor combination was heavenly!  I used a pudding-included cake mix to save myself a step.  To make it healthier, I used 1/4 c. raw cane sugar (also affected the flavor; could sub. light brown sugar with the same effect), 1/2 c. unsweetened apple sauce & only 1/4 c. canola oil, and used low-fat cream cheese.  We picked LOTS of blueberries last summer, so I used about 2 c. frozen instead of the canned (tossed with a little flour and cinnamon so they wouldn't sink).  I added maple flavoring and a little milk to the powdered sugar to make a maple glaze, and came out with a to-die-for coffee cake!

I made cupcakes (24) from the recipe - other than that, followed it exactly.  Maybe because I expected so much from all the reviews, but I didn't think it was outstanding.  Good, just not out of this world.  Thanks for sharing.

I've made this one 3 times now and each time I've gotten great reviews!  I've wanted a lemon-blueberry flavor, so I substituted a Pillsbury lemon cake mix and omitted the pudding.  Icing was just powdered sugar, milk, lemon extract.  It was great!  Will use many more times!  Thx for the great recipe! **UPDATE**  Accidentally left out the sugar, too, and I love how it's a simpler flavor and not so sweet!  I'll be omitting the sugar and pudding in the future.  Love it!

I made this cake for my daughters dance recital party!  It was amazing!  I omitted the extra sugar like some people recomended, and it was wonderful. I had two pieces left and people asked me if they could take them to eat for breakfast the next day!I didn't even glaze it, I just used fresh whipped cream on it.  This is a definite keeper.  Thank you for sharing!

This cake was a little too sweet and rich for me. I brought it to a Thanksgiving dinner and most of it was gone by time I left, so I was happy to see that it was enjoyed. I think there was a little too much cream cheese. If I was to make it again, I would use less of it.

I made this for a group of my husband's friends and they loved it.  The cake is extremely moist and very easy to make.  I would perhaps try a variation of the glaze - maybe a cream cheese frosting with blueberry juice added.

For using a boxed cake mix, this is REALLY good!  Very easy to make, and so moist.  I did add a bit of milk before folding in fresh blueberries, as the batter was way too thick, and I knew my blueberries would get smooshed.  This was a good call, and the cake turned out great.  I topped it with a lemon glaze (powdered sugar with fresh lemon juice).  The Bunco ladies loved it!  It was my little secret that I used a box cake mix (shhh . . . don't tell anyone, and they'll never know)!

This was delicious!  I brought it to a party and everyone loved it.  I did not think you could taste the cream cheese, which was ok with me.  It was a very dense cake, it tasted very much like a muffin to me.  I noticed that the batter was extremely thick and beating it for 4 minutes almost wore out my hand mixer.   Next time I would add a little more water to prevent this, I do not think it will hurt the recipe.

Very easy to make despite the fact the batter was soo dense it burned the motor out of my hand mixer!!!

I made a lemon glaze instead of the blueberry on and that plus the cake itself was way too sweet!! 

Probably wouldn't make this again.

I used a white cake mix, no sugar, applesauce in stead of oil, fat free cream cheese, and fresh blueberries.  This cake turned out dense, moist and delicious.  It is great without even adding an icing.  I just sprinkled it with powdered sugar, and we all enjoyed it for dessert tonight.

Oh this is HEAVENLY!!  My 12 yr old daughter made this for me for mother's day!  To make this lower fat, she used apple sauce for the oil, splenda for the sugar, sugar free french vanilla pudding mix and fat free cream cheese and left off the icing as it was WONDERFUL just by itself!  We also used the blue berry juice mixed into the mix...DEFFINATLY will make again :)

I baked this cake three times within two weeks and each time it turned out delicious; family, church members, friends, and co-workers loved it. Though, I made one adjustment to the recipe, I used ICBINB instead of oil which made the cake lighter/fluffier; the first time I baked it with oil and it was too heavy/rich. However, I love the taste and will definitely keep this recipe in my recipe box.

I was a little disappointed because I was really expecting this to taste more like pound cake instead of just yellow cake mix with blueberries.

This was great! I used fresh blueberries and took a lemon glaze from a different recipe. It was awesome! Really moist. I brought it to work and the guys really loved it! They gobbled it down before lunch. This is probably the best cake I have ever made. I will make this again. I am also giving this recipe out to friends and family.

ok i tweaked it..but this is a fantastic recipe..changes i made...used DH butter recipe cake mix-3eggs and 1stick butter, 1/4 cup oil...seperately mixed c/cheese sugar and 1 egg..used frozen blueberries. one layer of mix in pan and then dolloped creamcheese in added rest of batter..baked 50min drizzled with a powder sugar lemon glaze...results.... dense, moist..flavor is light with the blueberries and a slight cream cheese cake flavor ribbon thru it..at the end when you hit the glaze it pulls it all together for flavor...pretty in color and the band and hubby went wild over it!! this is a dense moist cake with a subtle blueberry flavor and kick from the lemon glaze at the end....OOMG!!

This was one of the very few times I felt that the reviews were a little too favorable.  While this cake was okay, it was far from stupendous.  It just tasted like cake mix cake when it was all said and done.  I followed the recipe exactly, and I just don't think it was worth the effort to make it.  I served it along several other recipes from this site, and it was the only thing that wasn't totally gobbled up.  Despite all the cream cheese, etc., I felt that it was really dense without too much moisture.  I was really excited about the opportunity to use a mix instead of making the cake from scratch, but I'm going to try one of the recipes from scratch next time.  So . . . basically . . . not awful . . . and definitely not awfully impressive.

Made this last night; the store did not have canned blueberries so I used fresh ones; for the topping I put some aside and pured them; added a little water & conf. sugar.  Turned out great.

This cake was a huge hit with my Bunco group! I thought it was very easy to make and more importantly, moist and delicious.  Don't be surprised (like I was)that the batter is a little doughy it comes out perfectly. I made a blueberry cream cheese frosting instead of the glaze...yum!!!

This recipe is incredible!  I made it once and after that it was requested again by the most epicurious in my family.  The only thing I added was almond extract to both the cake and glaze.  It brought this cake to a whole new level!

Excellent cake! I used fresh blueberries and it turned out great.  Also, I used a mixture of butter, powdered sugar, and a dash of milk and almond extract for the glaze and it was great with the cake.  My father in law went back for a third piece so I'll definately be making this one again.

A great recipe!  Very moist, my friend who never eats cake had three pieces because he liked how moist it was.  I used fresh blueberries, French Vanilla cake mix, and Cheesecake pudding.  It turned out great and had excellent flavor!

I made this cake twice.  I used fresh blueberries both times.  The second time I made it, I did not put in the additional 1/4 cup sugar that is called for.  I liked the cake much better, it does not need the additional sugar, as the cake mix & pudding mix already has so much.  This recipe is definetly a keeper!

Scrumptious as part of a brunch table.  Just served this to a bunch of good cooks and they all agreed this recipe is a keeper.  By the way,  I used lemon pudding and fresh blueberries and a sprinkle of powdered sugar on the top--delicious.

Can't say enough about this creation! Moist, light, fruity. I also used French Vanilla cake mix. I mixed 2 boxes of each lemon and vanilla pudding and measured out half the portion. I used drained, thawed frozen blueberries and made a glaze of powdered sugar and lemon juice. Very delicious! And of course, easy :-)

Very good.  Easy to make.  I baked for 10min longer than called for.  Served at a church breakfast.  Didn't disappear as quickly because I didn't frost or ice it, I think.  Used French Vanilla cake batter as suggested.

I made this 11/6 for my Boss' b-day.  She loved it!  She couldn't stop eating it.  It was wonderful.  Not hard to make, which I like, and it was moist, another plus.  No complaints.  This is a keeper.

i thought this was pretty good, but i thought the blue icing was a little strange looking.  i probably will just use milk with the powdered sugar if i make it again.

Hi Everybody,
Yes I have tried the Blueberry Cream Cheese Pound Cake II several times and it is one of my family's favorite desserts. My grandson likes it in a cupcake form. Everytime I go to Morrow, Ga I have to make it. I make it for all holidays. This is a thumbs-up cake!

Excellent! After reading the reviews I did omit the sugar and the cake is sweet enough for my taste. To make it easier to mix the cream cheese, I made sure it was really soft then cut it up into several prices, it mixed just fine.  I also blended all other ingredients together before I added the cream cheese.

Excellent recipe! Super moist. I adjusted the oil/water & blueberries, due to using a box of cake mix that was 15.25 oz. I left all other ingredients as is, plus a added a touch of vanilla flavoring. Also, I baked according to boxed directions on the cake mix. My college kids love it!!

This cake is soooo good!!  I omitted the white sugar altogether, but I did add about 1/8 cup of brown sugar.  I also added the zest and juice of one whole lemon to the batter.  I used the zest and juice of one lemon and some powdered sugar for the glaze... it was a hit!  I will definately be making this again!

The cake was really good but the glaze was not all that great. The Cake was more moist the second day so next time I would make this a day ahead of serving.

Very moist, tasty and easy to make. For the glaze, just to give it a little zing, I added a couple of teaspoons of lemon juice. Turned out splendid!

I made this pound cake for a baby shower I was throwing this weekend and it was a hit.  Everyone raved about it.  The only thing I changed was that I accidentally got blueberry pie filling instead of the blueberries in juice.  I just used all of the pie filling and it came out great.  We didn't make the glaze as it was too much to do during the baby shower and everyone loved it anyway.  I would defintely make this again...might get requests at the next family get-together.

I made this for dessert when another family came to dinner and it was gone in about 5 minutes! My kids begged me to make it again. My only suggestion is to keep extra water on hand as you blend the batter. I needed more than the recommended 1/4 cup because the batter was a bit too thick. I also used fresh blueberries and a lemon glaze--I will absolutely make this again and again. Thanks!

My cake didn't look very good, but it's definitely MY fault.  I substituted the canned blueberries (didn't have any) for some blueberry pie filling I had left over.  I think there was too much moisture in it, because the cake was very jiggly even though I cooked for 60 minutes.  When I took it out of the oven and let it cook for over 30 minutes in the pan, the center of the cake (closes to the bundt pan's center) was still very liquidy.  When I finally took it out of the bundt pan an hour later, it just collapsed.  The cake tastes great, but there won't be any photos of this one.  Will try it again and bake exactly as directed.

I first made this recipe in Jan 07 and served it to 15 women at a scrapbook party... it was a HUGE hit. 

Since then I have made it at least 8 times, it is the dessert of choice when we have company. 

My young daughter calls it "The Purple Cake" and enjoys helping to drizzle the glaze. 

I followed the recipe exactly.

Everyone said they like it. I just didnt think it had a very blueberry taste and I baked it in 2 loaf pans and the the bottom came out a little dark.  Next time I will bake as muffins and maybe use lemon cake mix.  Thanks

Great cake! I used lemon cake and lemon pudding, halved the sugar calle  d for, used 1 1/2 cups fresh blueberries, and skipped the glaze.  Next time I'll try replacing some/all of the oil with unsweetened applesauce to cut calories.

Although I've never met a bundt cake I didn't like, this was especially delicious.  My guests were a little turned off by the purple icing, but I literally told them to "shove it" and they loved it!

Delicious cake even tho I tweaked it just a bit.  I used 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup oil. I had instant cheesecake pudding on hand, so used it instead of the vanilla. I also used 2 cups of frozen blueberries so it cooked longer than the 60 minutes.  I just kept a close check on it.  I also used a lemon glaze cause I didnt like the idea of a blue glazed cake.  My husband has requested this to be made more often :).

I had high hopes for this cake.  I have a similar recipe that I make and it's my husband's favorite.  This one is mostly different by the sauce you pour on top.  Also, the recipe I have calls for sour cream instead of cream cheese.  I just liked the way mine tastes better.  Sour cream makes bundt cakes very moist and delish!

This cake was very easy and very moist.  I personally wasn't a huge fan of it but I took it to church and the people there loved it.  I think next time I would make it with frozen blueberries with lemon glaze.

This was a great recipe.  I made some modifications -

I used fresh blueberries - 3 half pints.

I also made a streusal topping instead of making the icing.  

I layered the cake mix with the blueberries and streusal in between, 3 times.  It created a blueberry-streusal marble cake.  Nice and light and fluffy.

This cake was so good and an easy desert to serve at a family dinner.  Like other's suggested, the glaze was way too sweet and the cake can stand on its own with out it.  I will definitely make this cake again.

Excellent!  Very moist.  The blueberry glaze actually looked a bit odd and funky, but it was for my 16-year-old niece's birthday and she loved it.  Very good cake.

We love this base recipe at our house.  We have tried the blueberry, yellow/cream cream, minus the sugar, wonderful.  Chocolate/chocolate with raspberries, ok.  But our favorite is a spice cake mix/cream cheese pudding, minus sugar, a can of fried apples and no icing. Dissappeared quickly.

My family loved this cake.  We followed the recipe exactly and it came out great.  Next time I will omit the extra sugar and leave the glaze off because it really doesn't need either.  I'm going to try variations as suggested by others.

This tasted great!  It's very sweet though, but I will definitely be making this again.  With the pudding mix, you don't need the extra 1/4 cup sugar at all.  For a complementary flavor, try using lemon pudding mix and adding lemon extract.  I also prefer this recipe with frozen blueberries.  I added them at the last possible moment so they wouldn't break or bleed into the batter.

I made this recipe for a girlfriend's birthday party at work.  The batter was really thick, even after I added a little extra water.  There was no "pouring" the batter, rather I had to use a large spoon and scoop it from the bowl to the pan.  It also took 10-15 minutes longer to bake than the recipe called for, but that might have been because I used frozen blueberries.  Given the thickness of the batter, and the extra cooking time, I was a little worried about this recipe.  However, it turned out very pretty and was quite tasty.  When I left work at the end of  the day, all that was left was my empty plate!  I will likely make this again. THANKS for the recipe!

I made this recipe and made Mini Bundt Cakes with it for the family as a test.  Annually we do a bake sale to benefit the kiddo's school organizations and we don't like to just do cookies, so we test different recipes in smaller servings.  They were a huge hit, moist and just the right sweetness level!  These are DEFINITELY going to be made for the sale,  Going to use mini loaf pans...will let you know how they work out!

Fantastic. I skipped the blueberry juice in the glaze and added almond flavoring, but otherwise followed the recipe. I will keep it as my fruit pound cake go-to.

I made this with fresh blueberries straight from the farm and it turned out perfect.  I did use the French Vanilla Pudding instead of vanilla pudding and I made my icing using powdered sugar, butter, vanilla and fresh squeezed lemon juice.  This is definitely a winner.  It was quick to mix up too.

So moist and delicious!! I used a pint of blueberries instead of canned, and as a result also just did a plain powdered sugar/milk glaze but other than that followed recipe exactly. It was divine. I am waiting for my kids to go to bed so I can sneak another piece!!

I can't tell you how many times I've made this cake, and passed the recipe to others.  It's quick and easy and always a hit.  I use either yellow cake mix and switch it up with a lemon cake mix, which is also yummy.  I use frozen blueberries and make purple-ish colored glaze by adding a few drops of blue and red food coloring into the powdered sugar.

This is so delicious.  I had to make a change because I couldn't find the blueberries called for.  I bought a small pkg of frozen ones and simmered them in a little bit of water.  I used the juice from that to make the glaze.  So rich and moist and will surely make again and again.  Thank you for the recipe.

Very good cake, moist and delicious. Easy way to use the fresh blueberries coming in.
I did make a lemon glaze for the top as I like the taste of lemon and blueberry.

I used frozen berries dredged in flour, added a little lemon juice to cake batter and made glaze from powdered sugar and lemon juice.

I made some changes to this, but most were out of necessity.  I couldn't find canned blueberries so I ended up buying blueberry pie filling.  I drained most of the juice off as best I could using a mesh strainer.  I saved what I drained off.  I also omitted the extra sugar in the cake since the blueberries were sweetened, and both the cake mix and pudding mix have sugar in them.  I used part of the reserved blueberry sauce and mixed it with confectioners sugar to make the glaze.  Everyone in my family loved this cake.  I made it for my mom's birthday, and my daughter said that she wants it for hers too.

I am making this cake for the second time within a week.  It is delicious and very moist.  The changes I made, I used the blueberry juice instead of water, 1/2 cup.  I wasn't sure about using pie filling, so I used a can of blueberries(drained) and I also left out the cream cheese.  It was YuMmY!

A delicious moist cake hard to stop eating.
I used a Vanilla Cake Mix.
I did not add the pudding mix.
I used 1 tub of light Tre Stelle Ricotta Cheese instead of the cream cheese.
I also added 1 tablespoon Vanilla.
As well I added fresh blueberries instead of frozen.
I will definitely be making this again.
Simply divine!

This cake is so yummy! My family loved it! It's so moist and flavorful!  I used fresh blueberries and vanilla cake mix and French vanilla instant pudding like some reviewers suggested.  My glaze didn't come up as beautiful since I didn't have the juice from the can. I mashed some of the blueberries and strained it. I will definitely make it again because we just couldn't stop eating it!

Too sweet! This one did not work for me. The boxed cake mix with the added sugar is just too much (and I like sweet). Also, the cake doesn't bake well due to the addition of cream cheese and blueberries. It just ended up being a mound of overly-moist sugar. I didn't even bother with the icing/glaze after having the cake be such an epic failure. We tried to eat it but after a few bites you quickly hit your limit. I've been baking for 25 years and things typically come out pretty darn good. I had high hopes for this one too as I love blueberries and cream cheese. If you're looking for a true bundt cake try making cake from scratch and leave out the extra sugar! No need for pudding mix either.

I made this cake this afternoon. I did skip the extra 1/4 cup of sugar, but otherwise I made it exactly as written. The batter is very thick, and I was originally worried that I'd done something wrong. 
It baked about 60 minutes, came out of the oven when a tooth pick came out clean, but the top still looked a little moist. Glazed it while it was still warm, and it is wonderful! Added to my recipe box to make again.

This is my go-to cake! I like a little more blueberries so I thaw some frozen blueberries to add. I also add more frosting. The cans are pricey so I may try other reviewers suggestions of just frozen next time. Thanks for the excellent and easy recipe.

Awesome...  I didn't have plain blueberries, so I used blueberry topping. Sugar free pudding was fine and we didn't feel it needed the glaze...  It tasted great without the extra sugary topping...  I also didn't have a bundt pan, so I put it in a big ole baking dish.....  Tasted great...

This was great! I took it took work and all my co-workers loved it. The only thing I changed was that I used a French Vanilla pudding mix instead of a regular vanilla pudding mix. I think it gave it a extra kick. Even one of my co-workers that doesn't like blueberries liked this cake.

Jason loved this!  I used frozen blueberries.  Just whatever I had left in the bag.  I defrosted inthe microwave and drained off juice that I then used for the glaze.  2T liquid was too much for glaze.

This was a big dissapointment--it tasted like cake mix with a few tasteless blueberries floating around.  I tried to salvage this with a cream cheese frosting, but that didn't help much.  Won't make again.

I used fat-free cream cheese, fat-free pudding (small box),1/2 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup olive oil and added 1 teaspoon of cinn.  Also used fresh blueberries and omitted the icing.  IT WAS GREAT!!  So moist and fluffy.

I love this recipe! I have made this countless times and always give out the recipe. I used the glaze once only and thereafter have only used a dusting of powdered sugar. I've never tried it with a lemon cake mix but that sounds great! If my cream cheese isn't at room temperature I microwave it for a few seconds to soften it. I find the best results to be with Betty Crocker cake mixes - if I use another it is way too moist. I've also forgotten to add the sugar and it just makes the blueberries a little more tart. I've tried frozen blueberries but much prefer the canned, well drained and rinsed well and folded really gently into the batter. I made it this morning for my department - it's always a hit with them!

This is fantastic!  The second time we tripled the glaze recipe and sprinkled granulated sugar on the top to give it a crystalized look.  It was very purple and pretty.  Make sure the cream cheese is room temp. and the blueberries are thoroughly drained or the cake will be purple too.  Even my child who hates blueberries (I can't imagine) loved this cake!  It's an easy, wonderful recipe!

I made this cake for a small birthday celebration, everyone had seconds and it was gone before the gifts were opened. I had several requests to make another. I have been making it ever since and it is always a hit. Thanks for sharing!

Best Ever and easy to make!! We used fresh blueberry's.  My HUSBAND made this (yes that easy) and my Mom liked it so much she had him make another for a party she was bringing dessert to.  For the glaze, he used some blueberry pancake syrup and Cream de Casis with the powdered sugar.  It was awsome.  This is definatly a ***** recipe.  We have been creating modifications with different cake mixes and mix ins, (chocolate cake mix with dark cherries) for fun alternatives.  THIS RECIPE IS THAT GOOD!!!!

Easy and yummy, but will not make for a special occasion.  Will  leave out pudding next time as it made the cake so moist it got "goopy" in the middle the next day.

This is a very good base recipe.  You can mix it up in so many different ways by using the key ingredients...cream cheese, pudding mix, etc.  I used a lemon cake mix with vanilla pudding.  it was wonderful and had wonderful reviews from a group I catered.  Will use often!

Very moist and really easy to make. I used a lemon cake mix and frozen blueberries. It turned out great. I didnt make the blueberry glaze, I just sprinkled it with powdered surgar when it was cool. My husband really liked it.

This has got to be one of the most delicious cakes Ive ever had.  I accidentally beat the bluberries into the mixture instead of stirring which turned the whole mixture a nice hue, but I honestly think it resulted in the blueberry flavor to be more evenly distributed.   I wish there was a trick to ease back the strong color of the glaze, though.

OH MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS!! I have never had a cake that was soooo moist and delicious and SUPER EASY!! I brought it to a Christmas party with my friends and everyone loved it (and I have some picky friends). One of them even asked for the recipe. She was worried that it would be hard, and I told her that is was really easy. She is not a baker or a cook (she even screwed up brownies out of the box!)but she said this was easy. So to wrap this up... 5 stars!!

I love this easy cake.  My brother in law (whose parents own a blueberry farm) asked for me to give my sister this recipe).  I don't "do" the blue glaze anymore (I did the first time)since it looks a little freaky.  A regular glaze will do.  I might try this with a lemon cake, but it is good AS IS!

VERY GOOD, MOIST CAKE.  SUBSTITUTED LEMON CAKE MIX JUST BECAUSE I LIKE THAT FLAVOR COMBINATION.  FOR EXTRA BLUEBERRY FLAVOR, NEXT TIME I'LL SUB SOME OF THE BLUEBERRY JUICE FOR THE WATER IN THE CAKE BATTER.

This was a very good cake.  I am in the midst of opening a bakery and this will definitely be on the menu. Very moist - not too sweet.  I did find that I prefer the cake without the galze but that is just my preference...either way it's very good!

What a fantastic (and easy) cake!!!  I made this last night for the first time because it's been rainy and cold.  I used fresh blueberries that I had on hand and omitted the glaze, just dusting the top with powdered sugar instead.  My 8 year old daughter said it was "wonderful" and all of my co-workers devoured the section I brought in to share within minutes.  I can't wait to have another piece!  Thanks.

The only change I made was a jar of cherries instead of blueberry. I don't know if that had anything to do with it but I didn't like this cake at all. I gave it 4 stars because I changed the recipe and maybe that was the problem.

I used this recipe for my son's first  birthday cake. I frosted it instead of using the glaze, and baked it in a 3D bear pan. The baking time was a bit off, but that was probably because of the pan. The cake tasted great, but was very dense. A little piece was enough for each person.

I followed the instructions exactly and it came out soooo good!!  My picky boyfriend doesn't like blueberries and he wanted a second piece.  It is VERY sweet so I only had a small piece. It would be a good coffee cake.

This recipe was very tasty. All I did was used lemon pie filling in the place of the blueberries and used lemon pudding mix! It was delicious and my kids loved it!

A mother made this and brought it to our "mommy only" Christmas party.  It was very good.  I asked her where she got the recipe and she lead me to this site.. Thank you so much now my family can enjoy this too!

I made this recipe into cupcake muffins and I'm sorry but have to give this a so, so rating.  Found it to be too sweet (probably should have left out the sugar) and very dense. Will probably not make again...sorry.

DEE-LISH!!  I am quickly becoming a fan of "cake mix" recipes!  They taste exactly like they were made from scratch.  This is so incredibly moist and flavorful.  I didn't make the blueberry glaze because quite honestly, it doesn't need it.  But I probably would make a regular or lemon glaze and not the blueberry one since most other reviewers thought the blue color was a bit weird.  Guarantee you won't be able to eat just one piece :-)

Very rich! I couldn't find canned blueberries but used a pint of fresh ones sprinkled with sugar instead. I will definitely make again.

I thought this was just OK, but I'm giving it 4 stars because my kids loved it and because it's so quick to throw together.  Next time though, I'll use fresh blueberries, rinsed with water and sprinkled with a little sugar to sweeten them.

It's not the prettiest cake.  But it is pretty darn tasty and different.  I love Blueberries and cream cheese so I had to try it.  It was really easy and quick.  I'm not a yellow cake fan, but it was different and well worth the effort.
