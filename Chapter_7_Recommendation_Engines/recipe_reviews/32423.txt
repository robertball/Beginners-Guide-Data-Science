This is something similar to what I make on the regular.  My friends know it as one of my trademark drinks, and call it "Ghetto Margaritas."  Instead of using frozen limeade concentrate, I use a bottle of limeade (now becoming more and more popular- Simply Limeade is my preference), therefore eliminating the need for water.  I mix equal parts white rum or white tequilla with the limeade.  Whenever possible, I'll soak some strawberries in the alcohol for a few hours before adding the juice to add a little treat to the cocktail.  WARNING: the acidity of limeade neutralizes alcohol taste- this can get you very drunk without you even knowing it- be careful!

Wow--so refreshing...and you don't taste a trace of the alcohol.  Just FYI- one ounce is equal to 2 tablespoons.  I actually added 12 more ounces of water (use the juice concentrate container), another 1/2 cup of vodka, fresh squeezed juice from 4 limes, and 1/4 cup of sugar.   I served this over the ice instead of blending it all together--sooo good.  This is one of THE best alcoholic drinks I have ever had!!  Great with Cuban or Mexican food.

I skipped the water in this recipe and used Smirnoff lime vodka. I likes very much. I don't want to share it.

My cocktail of record is a low cal version of this one: two fresh squeezed limes, one packet of Splenda, count to ten as you pour the gin and top off with water.

My family has been making this since the 60's!  We never add water -- it is also great with lemonade or pineapple concentrates!  Alcohol is added to taste preference (of course)!!

Excellent.  Love one reviewer's strawberry idea as I discovered early on that they taste great with this.  I did add some fresh squeezed lime juice for a little extra flavor.

As another reviewer suggested I use either Simply Limeaid or the mintue maid one. For me the lime is overpowering. But if you add just a small splash of orange juice it takes the bite out of the lime. The perfect drink. I also just use vodka, limeaid and orange juice. Be very careful!!! You can make these drinks really strong and not taste the liquor!

This is a great summer drink. I've made this for years and years and we use the Limeaid can to measure 6 ounces of Vodka and omit the water. When I was young, my mother made these for neighborhood parties and she used just a can of water and omitted the Vodka for a batch for the kids to enjoy as well.

Left out the water and replaced it with extra vodka.  Dangerous and delicious!

A four as is, a five with a tweak. I used one 12oz limeade, one can of water, 1 cup of regular vodka, and a half cup of UV Cherry vodka. This makes a cherry limeade! When it comes time to make another batch for the party, I just use less of the regular vodka and more of the cherry vodka since it's got a slightly lower alcohol content. The UV Chery Vodka is essential since it's red and smells just like grenadine. You can't go wrong with this mix! I also like to put about 6 frozen strawberries in just the vodka and let them soak a bit before mixing the drink. It's a fun treat later on. Thanks for the recipe!

Wow. Drinking this now and am in heaven. I am a low carber, so used diet lime cordial and smirnoff vodka. Added extra lime juice and blended til it was nice and "slushy". So good, and pretty "healthy" too! ** Just added two strawberries to the mix - brilliant!

This is easy to make .  Defy your inner lazy self and get out the blender!  I used a cup of vodka, and in place of water I used 1/2 cup of club soda.  This is the perfect drink to cleanse the pallet after several happy hour Bloody Mary's.  Superb!

My friend used to make a similar drink which she called "Green Meanies" and we loved it! This drink is even better, so glad to have found it. It's like a vodka version of a margarita, but you can't even taste the alcohol so drink with caution.
