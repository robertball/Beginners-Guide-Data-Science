This was so pretty!  It tasted sublime, let me tell you!  Rhubarb is NOT a family favorite & now it has become a beloved, free delish-treat in our home.  Great to take to a picnic or any gathering, or just after dinner with the fam.  Try it, you won't be disappointed.

My family loves this Rhubarb Torte! I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out delicious! I usually don't like rhubarb, but this was simply wonderful. I have the second torte in the oven right now as I type. It's an easy recipe, one that my daughters helped me make. The only complaint is that it disappears way too fast. We will definitely make this again. Thanks Saucyb for this recipe!

This recipe takes me WAAAAY back to my childhood when my mother would make this desert on Sunday's.  Talk about a down home midwestern COMFORT FOOD!! 
I doubled the original as my mother always made hers in a 9x13 pan, but otherwise nothing and I mean NOTHING needs to change!!
5 stars hands down - THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS RECIPE!!

Sensational rhubarb recipe.  I agree with one poster who did not think of it as a torte...but it is awesome nonetheless.  I doubled the recipe and made it in a 9 x 13 dish and dusted the top with cinnamon.  This is by far the best rhubarb recipe I have ever made!

I wouldn't call this a torte but I would call it the best Rhubarb Meringue Pie I've ever had.  And quick and easy in the bargain.  

I did toss in a bit of cinnamon. And used my own pie crust.  I always make up a big batch of pie shells and keep them in the freezer for occasions such as this one - saves time.

This was so very, very good.  I didn't use enough flour, so the filling was too runny.  I also thought it was too sweet, so I will cut back on the sugar next time.  I think that since the crust was very sweet that the filling could be a little more tart.  I can't wait to make it again.

Made this with a regular pie crust and pie pan. It has too much sugar in the filling because it comes out runny.

delicious! i love the tartness of fruit, and rhubarb takes it to another level. I added a bit of cinnamon to the meringue, otherwise i followed the recipe to a T. will definitely be making again.

Okay, I made a whole list of substitutions, just to use what I had at home (eggbeaters, half and half, gluten-free flour) and added sweetened coconut and chopped nuts. As my first ever rhubarb torte, it was fantastic!

Really good!! I've never had rhubarb before and this was tasty! It works almost like raw cherries. I added cinnamon to the margarine mixture (used butter instead), cut the sugar by 1/2 cup, and added vanilla. Great with vanilla icecream!! This recipe could work with cherries or other tart fruit. Yummy!

This was so very easy to make and we just loved it.  My husband isn't too crazy about rhubarb but asked for seconds and said how much he liked it.

This was very good but too sweet for our taste.  I will cut the sugar in the filling to one cup but I will definitely make it again. Thanks!

I'd never had rhubarb before.....it tastes like a combination of tart apple and cherries in this recipe. This was delicious. My aunt proclaimed this "the best food I've ever put in my mouth". GREAT recipe and very easy.

Excellent. Will definitely use the filling recipe again with a couple variations. I used a pie crust instead of the base.

I look forward to rhubarb season every year because of this recipe.  I have made it numerous times and every time, I get rave reviews.  I have served it to many people who claim they don't like rhubarb, but this changes their minds!  I make it as written with just a few minor tweaks....I sometimes use half white flour and half whole wheat.  It gives kind of a nutty texture to the crust but still tastes amazing.  In trying to cut back on sugar, I use 1 c instead of 1 1/2 (if I make it in a 9 x 13 pan, I use 2 cups instead of 3).  I also add about 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon to the meringue topping.  I have made it as written and it is amazing.  These tweaks don't make it any more or less amazing.  It is just plain AMAZING!  Oh, and I have also used different fruit (peaches and raspberries together, strawberries, mixed berries) and it is always fabulous!

I'm pretty sure I followed the directions exactly and I have no idea what I did wrong, because there is no way other people would have rated this so high if it turned out the same as mine. The whole thing smelled and tasted like egg. The topping did not turn out right at all. Could have been my own fault somehow since I've never made that kind of topping before. But like I said, I followed the directions pretty closely. The only good part about it was the crust.

This was wonderful- I made it when we had a few couples over and it was a bit hit! I thought it would take a little longer to get all 3 steps done, but it went fairly smoothly. Will definitely be a favorite!

This is good and pretty easy.  A nice change from rhubarb pie.
