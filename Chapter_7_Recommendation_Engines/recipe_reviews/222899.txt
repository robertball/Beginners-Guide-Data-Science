I made this w/cheap brandy, so I was fully prepared to take a sip, be disgusted, and dump it out.  However, surprisingly, this really works. Even w/cheap brandy, the creme de menthe cuts the alcohol in the brandy and the brandy cuts the mint in the creme de menthe, resulting in a very smooth and drinkable nightcap.  I can see myself sipping this in front a fire. CHEERS, Allrecipes!
