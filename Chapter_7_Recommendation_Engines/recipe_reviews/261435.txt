Loved this Hot Chocolate,
But the greatest thing is "I slept great" lol.
This is my new winter drink,   I live in an area that gets a lot of snow and is cold.  So after a day of being outside,  this is a very nice hot cocoa to warm you back up!
ps: my family wants me to make a pitcher of it,

Very good. I had never had Bailey's before and found it to be good, stronger than I anticipated but good all the same. It was very sweet so it is something you would want to maybe only have one or two so you won't upset your stomach from all the sweetness. Great option though for cold nights.

I made it if for my friends but used Baileys Chocolate Luxe and a little 2% milk and it was amazing even for a non-drinker like myself! Will make for family over the weekend!

Oh my! Homemade hot chocolate with a splash of Baileys. I followed the recipe (although I don’t know how much my “cup” actually held) and will follow it again! Delicious!

Such a yummy quick adult beverage for a cool evening. I opted for a splash of milk instead if whipped cream to cut the extra sweetness a touch. Creamy and delicious. Warms you from head to toe.

Easy & quick! We used a nice "fancy" brand of hot cocoa mix and whole milk for this recipe. We loved the flavors of dark chocolate and Baileys and the toasted marshmallows with chocolate syrup really made this a decadent drink for chilly winter days/nights. We also added a shot of Maple bourbon for the 2nd round :)

This recipe has a great flavor mix. We used Land o’ Lakes hot chocolate and added marshmallows to the recipe. Land o’ Lakes makes 6 ounce drinks, so we made 3 servings of this recipe and evenly divided a fourth hot chocolate packet between them. We will definitely make this recipe again.

I made this with homemade hot chocolate and fresh whipping cream on top.  Very yummy.  If you want this to be truly decadent use your preferred hot chocolate recipe.  The Baileys adds that special flavor that kicks this decadent drink up a notch.

Easy Peasy and Tasty! Winter has finally arrived in NC and the weather is perfect for some hot chocolate and a bit of Baileys! I added some toasted marshmallows that I broiled in the oven to top off this classic too!
