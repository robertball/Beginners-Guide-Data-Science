This was a very nice bread Here are some changes I made--I used half whole wheat flour and half milk half orange juice for the liqued but next time I will only use milk becuase it was very orangey. the batter was very dry so I added about a 1/2 cup of extra liqued but I think that made it take longer to cook. I ended up cooking it for about an hour so next time I will just leave the batter dry. The only thing I did not like about the taste of the bread was it was way to sweet for me. next time I will reduce the sugar by half. and I will try zesting the orange instead of boiling the peel just to make it easier.

Excellent and very easy. I also used wheat flour, cut the recipe in half. Didn't have any milk, so used orange juice instead.

I had to add more milk. 1 cup of milk wasn't enough liquid.

This had good flavor, but it was more like a dry orange biscuit than bread.  Maybe it could use butter or oil?
