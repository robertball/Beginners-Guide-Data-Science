This dish tasted a lot like flan, and the pumpkin added a real nice touch. It took a little longer to bake and set than the recipe called for. I recommend taking off the pumpkin lid, my custard didn't set until I did.

hmm... I wish this rating system was more specific, for taste it deserves a 4+ stars, presentation 5, but as far as preparation is concerned the size of the pumpkin needs to be more specific. Mine luckily just fit the amount of ingredients, but the cooking time and temp were way off. After 2 hours it wasn't even slightly done, but I took anothers suggestion and nuked it for 4 minutes to set the custard which worked, but i think this recipe needs to be tweaked.

Gorgeous! Finished cooking in microwave as pumpkin was cooked but custard not set! It was however gorgeous, the custard did not look grey as I grated my nutmeg myself instead of using ready grinded one which may be responsible for the grey custard some had. Pumpkin started to slpit as it had to cook so much more for custard to set so I presented it with a pretty sash tied round it an no one noticed the problem. I will in future start cooking the custard in a pan and put semi-set in pumpkin. Also I recommand cooking the lid separately, upside down on the baking sheet as it seems partly responsible for custard taking so long to set. On the whole I strongly recommand this recipe, it was a hit here in France and dinners ate the whole lot!

This is great. The kids loved it. To resolve the problem of setting the custard I cooked it on the stove for about 20 mins on low med heat before putting it in the pumpkin.

I had a lot of trouble with this recipe. Although I followed the directions to the letter, the custard never solidified at all. As a matter of fact, I even cooked the pumpkin as long as possible (without it disentegrating) and still the custard did not form! The pumpkin seemed to make an excellent insulator against the heat of the oven.
I had to end up pouring the custard mixture into a saucepan, and cooking it that way. Then I returned it to the pumpkin. 
It did make a lovely centerpiece on the dinner table, and I enjoyed it very much. However, some friends were turned off when I scooped some of the pumpkin onto their plate and they would only eat the actual pumpkin. All the kids loved it though! 
Overall: Yummy but too much work. I will try thinning the pumpkin more next time, in hopes of improving the cooking time. Yes, I will try it again! If still no luck, I will stick to pumpkin pie.

I took the suggestion to bake the pumpkin with the top off - this was a mistake because the pumpkin caved in partially. The custard did cook beautifully and was a nice brown. However, the pumpkin was not a pretty centerpiece.
Also, my pumpkin may have been too large. I used a 12 lb pumpkin. When the custard rose it was about 1/3 of the pumpkin. 
I would like to try again next year!

This was very good.  I actually give it 4-4.5 stars for taste, but the presentation is so nice that I had to give it 5 stars.  The custard looked a just little greyish to me, and it took longer to cook than expected. I wonder if anyone has used 1/2 milk and 1/2 cream?  I'll make it again, it's too pretty not to.

This is a really fun recipe to make and eat.  350 degrees may be a little too hot, as the center of the custard wasn't quite done before the outside started to burn.  The consistency is close to that of bread pudding and compliments the pumpkin flesh nicely.     Mmmmm.

This took so much longer to cook that the skin of the pumpkin scorched a little. The custard tasted good but was an unappetizing gray color.  Won't try again.

The flavor is great.  The custard did not set properly.  I'll try with a flatter pumpkin for Thanksgiving.

I've tried this several times--the custard just won't set.  The color is unappetizing.  Never again!  Pecan pie is much less trouble.

I increased the filling and the cooking time, and did not leave space for the filling to expand ,  the custard over flowed I had extra in the pan that I used but I would leave more space next time ...The presentation effect was diminished, the taste-Excellent and the Maple Whipped Cream was a definite plus plus. The cooking time was off and an hour plus additional time was needed.  I also left the top off  but in the baking pan . This  helped and  would provided an excellent presentation. I will be making this again. A great gift- gluten free- tasty and different.
