Great recipe!  Just made it for dinner and it was very tasty.  Even my husband liked it, and he's very picky.  The only thing I changed was the cooking temp.  I opted to follow another reviewer and baked it at 350 for about 70 minutes, and used a meat thermometer just to be sure. Also, I would recommend cutting out the teaspoon of salt - there is plenty in the Worcestershire sauce. It was yummy over rice, but I can see egg noodles or even mashed potatoes as well.

Yum! My husband hates baked chicken with a passion and this recipe (with a few minor changes) actually got a good review from him. I used Brown sugar and added honey and cayenne pepper and extra mustard and I rubbed the chicken down with brown sugar before putting the sauce on it to even out the acidity and spice of it. Also served over white rice and I'm definitely making this again.

I made this last night for dinner and loved the sauce.  UNFORTUNATELY, I followed some of the other suggestions to dip the chicken in egg/flour/breadcrumbs and fry first.  Don't do it! The coating became mushy and was way too heavy for the dish.  I think this chicken does NOT need to be coated and browned first.  I did cook at 350 for about 1 hour 30 minutes... covered for the first hour.  Served with noodles (with sauce over it).  Will make again, Without coating/browning chicken!

Yummy is the right word in this title.  Loved this dish!  The recipe does not state skinless AND boneless but that is what I had.  I baked at 350 for 70 - 75 minutes and served over rice.  Will make this again!

This is my recipe, but I wanted to chime in to say that if you let the chicken cook a bit longer than the 2 hours (I'll let it sit in the oven for an extra 30-45 minutes), the chicken becomes even more tender and fall-off-the-bone good, and the sauce thickens up a bit more and becomes even better. If you have the time, I would definitely recommend this. :)

This was wonderful! My husband is a man that doesn't like any food unless it was made by his mother so when he said that he actually really liked this I was in shock! The recipe was really easy to follow and was very flexible. I had most of the ingredients in the fridge except a few but I substituted for what I didn't have and it was great! I used a light brown sugar instead of white, I am out of A-1 and paprika so a little of whatever I had in the spice cabinet and some Chipotle BBQ sauce worked fine. Positive that I am going to rotate this recipe into the menu! Thanks for sharing

I followed the recipe almost exactly except doubling the Worcestershire because I love the stuff .  With the oven set at only 300, and the chicken pretty tightly packed in the pan, it took the full two hours to cook.  It was definitely tangy vs. sweet, but that's what I like.  I served it with rice as suggested.  A nice lower fat recipe for chicken.

This was very good. My husband loved it! I added a few of my own ideas to this recipe. I egg washed the chicken and dredged in a mixture of flour and italian panko crumbs and browned on the stove with some olive oil. I then sauted sliced onions and mushrooms  with a little butter, olive oil, salt and pepper. I put this on top of the chicken before putting the sauce on. I added a little hot sauce (Siracha) and chopped garlic to the the sauce also. Baked at 325 for about 1.5 hours. Delish!!! Served with Jasmine rice.

This made my husband happy. Very tasty. I increased the sauce amount and thickened it slightly with corn starch before serving. I also included boneless breast. Turned it into Tangy Thighs and Breasts. Works best if you marinate the chicken in it in the fridge awhile before cooking.

I loved this recipe, I didn't have the steak or Worcestershire sauce, so I substituted barbecue sauce. The chicken was done in about 1:40, although I was only making a half recipe. My boyfriend thought it was a bit "weird" but I think that's only because he knew about the ketchup in the sauce.

Made this last night and everyone loved it. Browned my chicken thighs on the stovetop and then put them in the oven at 300 degrees with the sauce, covered, for the first hour. Lowered the oven to 200 degrees for the 2nd. hour and the chicken was falling off the bone. Had plenty of sauce for the rice as well. Will definitely make again!

After about every third bite my husband would say "Oh man, this is SO good!"  I removed the chicken from the baking dish, spooned out the fat, then boiled the remaining sauce in a pan. I thickened it with a little cornstarch slurry, too. We had enough leftovers  for tomorrow night, but he loved the sauce so much he ate it all!  I'll have to make more sauce tomorrow!

Family loved this recipe.  It is also a very forgiving one as well.  LOL I had added 1 tbsp of mustard instead of 1 tsp  ut it worked.  Will make again.

This is really good. I was particularly impressed by the slow, low cooking temperature.  It was fall-off-the-bone delicious and if it has to wait in the oven (turned off) it is no problem. I can only imagine that it is even better the next day. The sauce can be adjusted to taste and is just delicious. I like more mustard, Worcestershire, and cayenne and I added garlic powder.  I will definitely use this sauce  iin other receipes.

Excellent recipe, great flavour.  Used chicken breasts since that's what I had on hand.   Baked at 350 for 1 hr 15 min - covered for the first hour, foil off for last 15 minutes.  Let the chicken sit in the 0 degree oven for another 15 minutes.  Delicious!  Served over rice.  Second time  added a few ingredients - 1 tsp cayenne pepper, 1 tsp Frank's Red Hot Sriracha sauce - gave it a nice nip.    Also added about 1 T honey, 2 T Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce, 1 tsp minced garlic. Yummy!

This was excellent. Cooking long and slow at 300 degrees keeps the chicken moist and succulent.  I only cooked 1 & 1/2 pounds of thighs and 1 hour 30 minutes did the trick to meet the 165 degree done mark. Next time I'll lightly salt the chicken before baking. This is a really quick and easy dish. Making the sauce ahead  simplifies everything.

Husband loved this and the kids were happy too.  Didn't have steak sauce, added a little extra sugar (and used brown sugar) to make sure the kids would be happy since they are suspicious of anything new.  I will reduce or skip the butter next time but otherwise it was perfect.  What I liked most was that it was forgiving in terms of ingredients and time (sat in the oven extra long) but also cooking at 300 degrees made it SO tender.

A very easy and good recipe. Only change I made was adding a Tb sp of honey to cut acidic as one reviewer had done. I will keep this recipe for another day.

So easy and delicious. I didn't even simmer the sauce beforehand - my 10-yr-old mixed it in a bowl and we dumped it over the chicken and threw it in the oven. We'll be making it again!

So yummy. Only made a few alterations . First,  I used boneless skinless thighs, added one tablespoon honey, used I Can’t Believe it’s not Butter  Light, and omitted onions. Added a tablespoon Montreal Chicken seasoning to chicken before pouring sauce over.  Served over brown rice with green beans. Cooked according to recipe. My husband loved it!

Made exactly as written and it was delicious over brown rice. The sauce is a bit like sweet and sour and the thighs were so tender. Great recipe, thanks!

I followed recipe exactly and it turned out as it should have, the right amount of sauce and tender chicken. However, I personally did not care for the taste at all and neither did my family. Just as another reviewer noted, it does have a very ketchup taste (even though you have the vinegar and other spices) and that just did not go well with the chicken.

Excellent! I’ve made this dish several times; it’s great over brown rice. I adjusted the amount of paprika to 1/2 tsp because my kids are small and don’t like a lot of spice. Once I did that, they ate it up! I make this at least a few times a month.

Delicious over rice. I took the advice to not add salt, and it was fine.  Fairly easy to put together. The long, slow cooking did result in very tender chicken.

I only had 4 thighs so I had to cut the recipe back, so my measurements may have been off slightly. I like the different flavours in it. I'll make it again and see if I can get my rating to 4 stars

I was skeptical about the 2 hour cooking time. Checked it with a food thermometer after one hour and it was  perfect. Served it over brown rice. Added it to my favorites list.

Really good, and really easy! The chicken was tender, the sauce savory but not too strong. My brother had thirds, not just seconds. I think, if you have the time, cooking it at 300 for 2 hours -- unlike some of the other reviewers -- is what probably makes the chicken so tender.

i should have known from the ingredients what this would taste like....veey ketchup like. Its missing some zing, spice or ginger maybe. Turned out good, not watery like a lot of people are saying, the opposite was thick like paste which was fine. Watery is probably happening with cheap chicken that isnt air chilled. i did use a dutch oven instead of a casserole dish. i dont think i will make again.

I added 2 Tablespooons each of honey and light brown sugar to the sauce to cut down on the acidity. I also added two large cloves of garlic thinly sliced. Let the sauce simmer for 30 minutes.

Place the chicken, skin side up, in a 3 quart casserole. Pour the prepared BBQ sauce over the chicken. 



I will make this again.

I added 1 tablespoon honey plus a pinch of ground cayenne pepper. I also rubbed dark brown sugar over the thighs before I poured the sauce over them. 
Very good. I will make this again.

I made this tonight & it was a hit! Served with white rice. My recommendations would be ... omit the water, use half of the vinegar, & add a bit of brown sugar. Will definitely make this again.

Skipped the water, used margarine instead of butter, 2t onion powder instead of onion, a generous tablespoon of smoked paprika, skipped the salt, brown instead of white sugar. Baked my skinless bone-in chicken thighs 375 for an hour.

made this once a few weeks ago, and my family has become addicted to it. tonight will be the 3rd time I'm making this over the past 2 weeks ? I basically just use this recipe as a guideline and tailor it to my liking. I use brown sugar, heinz 57, and a little bit of honey in addition to the other ingredients in your  recipe. thanks so much for sharing

I love this recipe!  Very easy to put together and while it's cooking, you've got time for homework, a walk on the treadmill, etc.  I followed recipe exactly except I used smoked paprika.  I've made this several times in the oven and in the slow cooker.

I have made this several times and have passed on this recipe too.  I have changed the seasonings.  Tonight I used Cajun seasoning.  I like to put it in the rice too.  Sometimes I add mushrooms, peas, etc.It is also great to substitute pork chops or lamb chops.  I love Better than Buillion instead of cubes.  Awesome and easy dish.

Added 1 tbsp A1, 2 tbsp brown sugar, 1 tbsp honey, 1 tbsp corn starch to thicken sauce. Adding more cornstarch next time for thicker sauce.   Very good, family enjoyed it. Easy recipe.

This recipe is very flexible,  used pickle chip juice for the acid,  salted and peppered cut up chicken, with the mustard and spices minus the additional salt and paprika  in a plastic bag for overnight.  Placed chicken tightly in glass cassarole dish,  sprinkle with smoked paprika,  added pre mixed wet ingredients except for vinegar and ketchup and water and did not need any butter what-so-ever and poured over chicken 
(chicken juices created plenty of liquid) baked uncovered 2 hrs (turned after 30 mins).  Removed chicked on plate to pour juices through a strainer removing bits and the fat that separated to the top.  Had about 1cup, made a 1 tsp,  5tsp slurry added to remaining dripping once reached boil cooked 3 mins then poured over chicked.  Also substitued real maple syrup for honey,  still worked great,  less then 1/4 cup was needed to temper acid.  My new fav chicken  recipe. Very flavorful with or without sauce,  family served some with sauce,  some without.  Great either way.

We loved it - didn't have a lot of time when I found this recipe so I baked them at 375 F for about 45 mns. They were perfectly done and so juicy - the sauce is amazing - only thing I changed was add a squirt of HP sauce because I don't have A-1. Adjusted the recipe for 3 for 2 thighs and it was perfect. Thank you for posting.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe very much.  The sauce is very tasty and great on rice.  I'm sure it would be good on potatoes too.  I followed the recipe but but cut it in half and found it did not need 2 hrs.  One to l 1/2 hrs. is enough.

I have been looking for a good recipe for chicken thighs. We have a big family from little, preschool, middle school and high school. Everyone loved this recipe, I served it over rice. Also, I used half white sugar, half brown sugar. I don't know that it made any difference, just sounded good when I read it from another reviewer.

Tried it tonight for dinner.  We all liked it.  It was easy to prepare.  Used 4.75 lbs of chicken because that was the smallest size package of chicken that I could find.  The recipe made enough sauce to cover the extra chicken.  I thought that the sauce came out a little more watery than I expected, so maybe stirring in corn starch or flour could be a good idea to thicken it up a bit.  I made the sauce ahead of time, let it cool & poured it over the chicken to let it marinate for about an hour.  Giving 4 stars because while it was good, it didn't knock my socks off.
