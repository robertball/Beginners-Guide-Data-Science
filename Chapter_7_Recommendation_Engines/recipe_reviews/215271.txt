Gorgeous crepes that work well for savory or sweet.  I used balsamic vinegar and needed to add extra milk to thin the batter.  I added salt to the batter after tasting the first crepe.  For the sweet crepes I used oranges, apples Grand Marnier, honey, walnuts, vanilla, cinnamon and Greek yogurt, all mixed together and rolled cigar style.  For the savory crepes I cooked Russian banana potatoes with shallots and tarragon.  I made a thin dressing of Greek yogurt, milk, honey, and Dijon style mustard.  I filled the crepes with arugula, potatoes, feta, chopped pistachios and a drizzle of dressing.  I used an open envelope style to showcase the ingredients and pooled more dressing on the side.  Both ways were wonderful.  I got 6 - 9 inch crepes from this recipe.  Thanks cultmovieguy!

I tweaked this.  I didn't cook the beet, just blended in with the soy milk, then added whole wheat flour, egg, oil, and vinegar.  After cooking, I rolled some of the oranges right into the pancakes.  These were sweet enough that I felt the cinnamon sugar mix was not needed!  Next time, I will add the cinnamon into the batter.  This is a great recipe, and I will be making these again, with my tweaks!

The idea is fine, but mine was really runny and ended up being somewhere between a crepe and pancake.

Pretty bland. If I could taste anything, it was the flour. On the plus side, they are very pretty.

Thin crepes, yes.  Pancakes, no.  Batter very thin and tasteless.  Just like a crepe.  I converted the batter to someone else 's beet pancake recipe by adding Greek yogurt, brown sugar, baking powder and whole wheat flour.  That, turned out fantastic.

Loved it! Looked pretty in colour, was tasty with just a hint of the earthyness of the beetroot. Making the batter in the blender is a genius idea. I used coconut milk (had nothing else at home) which worked perfectly. We ate them with bacon (and some with maple syrup too).

Prep time is not 15 minites!!!
Takes at least 30 minutes to cook the beats and as mentioned another 30 minutes to leave the ingredients to sit while mixed. There's an hour gone and you are still hungry with not much satisfaction!!!
