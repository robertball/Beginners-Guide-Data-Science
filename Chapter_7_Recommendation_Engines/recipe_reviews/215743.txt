These are surprisingly good!  I used dried rosemary, regular black pepper and kosher salt.  These will make a great appetizer before Christmas Eve dinner.

These would be good, except the rosemary did not stay "attached" to the nuts and all fell to the bottom.  I used dried rosemary instead of fresh and it worked out fine.

Yummmmm! I haven't even got to baking these yet and I already can say I love em. I never heard of "smoked" pepper so I just used regular pepper. This was super simple and a nutritious replacement for popcorn. I expect I'll be making these often.

I substituted a tsp of habanero chili powder in place of the black pepper.   This was outstanding!  Can't stop eating them!
