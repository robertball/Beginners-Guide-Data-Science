This was a good and simple recipe.  I had a leftover young chicken, so I used that instead of canned chicken.  The flavor was wonderful, I just might think about using less chicken next time, the broth boiled mostly away before the time was up.

This is a very simple, yet delicious soup!  I didn't have any celery so I used 2 Tbs. of celery flakes.  I also ended up using 4 cups of chicken broth instead of just under 2.  Over all, this is definitely a soup that I would make again!  Plain and simple!  Love It!
