Why all the flavoring? Why cottage cheese? This makes a dish that that you bake to get rid of the germs from the egg? Make it simple, noodles and cheese melted in the microwave. Or Craft Dinner. All the same. (Choice 1 is healthier)(Rating because of ingredients.)

Since all the fatty cheesy goodness is taken out, something needs to be added in. Some nutritional yeast really improved this for a negligible amount of calories and lots of salt and fresh cracked pepper. This isnt a creamy style mac and cheese so if you like it creamy.. add more cottage cheese or yogurt to this.. I left out the sweetener.. dont like that in my mac

I've tried a similar recipe didn't need an egg.  Did use some shredded cheddar nothing processed no flour.  The cottage cheese was low fat had onions and other veggies in it and the POINT of this recipe is it's healthy.  People need to look at the nutritional analysis of meals.
