Awesome recipe. It was sweet but VERY yummy. I was stumped as to what to serve with it so I just went with the BBQ normals, potatoe salad and mac and cheese. By the end my husband and I both mixed it with the mac and cheese and it was even better! Great by its self also!!

This was to die for.  I just put it all in the crockpot and let it rip.  Used stevia instead of brown sugar. Yummmmy!

wonderful difference from the normal.....
used smaller can of sauerkraut and 3/4 c. brown sugar, added pinch of allspice, touch of basil and 2 cloves minced garlic with salt and pepper to taste. Served over baked onion/potato pierogies with some shredded cheese on top...will make again

Should have gone with my first instinct & totally avoided this recipe. WAY TOO SWEET!!! We love pork & sauerkraut stew, but did not care for this at all.

I thought the recipe was great! Super easy, yet tasty. My husband and I both loved it. My children, on the other hand, did not (age 18mos and 3 yrs). I also added a little more tomato sauce but next time would maybe add a can of crushed or stewed tomatoes as well. Thanks for the recipe!!!

Yum, I really liked this recipe :) I didn't have any tomato juice so I used clamato instead and it worked out well :) I also added a packet of onion soup mix just because I love that stuff!

Not what I thought it would be.  Sounded very good, but just wasn't something my husband or I liked.  Too much sweetness for us.

Thought this was just OK. I might cut back a little on the sauerkraut to beef ratio. It was a little sweet.

This was really easy to make.  I thought it was pretty good, but my 3 teenage boys loved it and have asked me to make it again.  Served it with homemade smashed potatoes. Filling meal, reminded me of meatloaf.

This was surprisingly good! My grandmother used to make saurkraut with brown sugar so I didn't think this recipe would be sour like saurkraut is, but when my picky 6 year old said that I better make it again - I was in for a surprise! What an affordable dinner choice.

Made tonight and is very good. With all the reviews on being too sweet, only used about a quarter cup of brown sugar and drizzled with soy sauce to counter the sweetness. Also substituted tomato sauce with spaghetti sauce diluted with water. Last change was adding shredded Swiss during the last ten minutes of cooking.  The recipe did not specify if you drain the sourkrout or not, I did not drain. instead I drizzled the juice as I spread it out before cooking. Will definately make again.

Browned the beef in an iron skillet and then used that as my casserole dish. The only thing I changed was using some mild homemade salsa as my tomato sauce and mixing the brown sugar in with it instead of sprinkling it on top. And I only baked it for 30 minutes at 400 F. I served it over rice. My husband really liked it and went back for seconds.

Super simple and delicious! It's not something that I would have thought of, but I knew I had hamburger and sauerkraut that I needed to used... so figured it was worth a try! Now it's something I'll make more often.

I made this twice. first time with turkey meat and it was excellent. second time with beef and tried to double the recipe which lost it's greatness. Today I'm trying a vegetarian version with mash-potatoes instead of meat...

This was actually really good, I didn't have brown sugar so I improvised and used a dash of grape jelly and caramelized it with the ground beef, I also added diced tomatoes.
Good stuff! =)

Very easy to make and easy clean up after.  I am vegetarian so did not try it.  However most people I served it to liked it.  One said "very good" as he took another big bite and nodded his head up and down, one said "yeah, pretty good" and finally one said "good flavor but a little dry, could use more sauce".  So there you have it.
