I've tried a couple of biscuit recipes that use buttermilk baking mix and they were excellent.  What I found, however, by making THIS recipe is that the mix doesn't really shave any time off the preparation nor is the process necessarily simplified. These biscuits were mixed and on the baking sheet in no time.  I wanted the freshness and color of green onion, so I chose to use that instead of the dried minced onion.  I found I needed more buttermilk to bring the dough together, so since I had none left I used cream.  They were perfectly baked and golden brown at 12 minutes.  Once out of the oven I brushed them with melted garlic butter which gave them a boost of flavor as well as an attractive sheen.  The Parmesan is a distinct flavor in the biscuits, so the title is just a little misleading.  If you don't like Parmesan, you're not likely to care for these biscuits.  They're SO pretty - very inviting.  I appreciated their larger size compared to other drop biscuit recipes.  They’re crusty on the outside, buttery and moist on the inside.  Flavorful and just delicious. They’re just what I was after to accompany our soup tonight and I’m looking forward to enjoying one with some scrambled eggs in the morning too.

I chose to use fresh minced green onions in place of the dried onions. I found that I had to add an extra Tablespoon of buttermilk, then the batter came together nicely. I mixed and dropped the batter onto a parchment sheet. They baked up in 12 minutes leaving behind a wonderful cheddar aroma. The first thing I noticed were the pretty speckles of green onions with the yellow cheddar cheese baked in all over the biscuits.  The biscuits feel light and airy to the touch and are a lovely golden color! They are moist, tender and very cheesy-just the way we like our biscuits! I could also taste the parmesan reggiano. I think these biscuits turned out just right, not too salty or dry. Flavorful and delicious! This went nicely with, "Beef Barley Vegetable Soup," also from this website. I also think these biscuits would complement a bowl of hearty beef stew or chili.

I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of:  used milk and vinegar (had no buttermilk); diced and browned a small Vidalia onion in 1 Tbls. butter (had no dried onion); greased the baking sheet with shortening (no parchment); and added a pinch of garlic granules.  I also made six large biscuits instead of 12 small (baking time and temp. was the same).  These were great- the only thing I thought was maybe they could use more salt, but I recommend following the recipe the first time and deciding for yourself.

I used green onions as other reviewers did and I also needed to add an extra splash of milk. I am lactose intolerant and didn't want to buy buttermilk just for this recipe so I put a Tablespoon of cider vinegar into a measuring cup and then added enough lactose-free milk to make the one cup needed. These biscuits are really delicious. The perfect accompaniment to my "wow, Fall is here" chili.

I loved these and i don't even like biscuits that much!  They are cheesy, moist and easy.  I used powdered buttermilk with success-I rarely if ever buy fresh.  The onion flavor was subtle but the perfect amount.  Really good-not overpowering on the baking powder side which I really appreciate.  I will definitely make them again!  Quick, easy, and they were perfect with our pasta!  A great side to help stretch a meal.  Thank you!!

Great biscuits.. delicious! The outside had a golden brown crunchiness, and the inside is moist & very tasty! I did not have dried minced onion, so I used dried chives. The name should be changed to "Cheddar Parmesan Drop Biscuits".

These were very good but a little bland.  I didn't have dried onion so I took other reviewers advice and used green onion.  They came out pretty, but I wonder if that could have been part of the reason they weren't full in flavor.  Will definitely make again but will try with the dried onion and see what happens.  I also might add a little Old Bay Seasoning next time for added flavor.
11/26/11 update:  I just made these a 2nd time because I had green onion and sharp cheddar that I wanted to use up.  This time around I added more cheddar, a little more onion, and a dash of season salt.  This batch was much more flavorful!  Definitely 5 stars with those changes.

This is my first try at drop biscuits without a baking mix. These were very easy to quickly throw together and all the ingredients are things I always have on hand. They took 14 minutes to bake up to a nice golden crispy crust, with a moist buttery inside, with just the right amount hint of cheese flavors. I added 3 chopped scallions and needed a bit more buttermilk than the 1 cup called for to bring the flour mixture to the right consistency. This makes about 11-12 biscuits, so we had the leftovers for breakfast the next morning. I will be making these again and again.

These turned out really well. We added 1/3 cup extra of buttermilk and 2/14 cups of sharp cheddar as we like cheddar versus Parmesan. Brushed them with garlic butter.  Next time, I'll add a teaspoon of garlic.  Will likely be a 5 star rating then. Will definitely make these again.

We loved these!  I made this recipe as written, with the exception of using green onions (about 3 including a lot of the green top), instead of the dried.  I also had to add more buttermilk (a splash or two) to get my dough to come together.  Mine were done in 14 minutes and I got 12 good size biscuits that were beautiful.  I brushed them with some melted butter as soon as I took them out of the oven, which only added to their deliciousness.  I will definitely make these again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made the biscuits considering revisions made by other members, also changed to 8 servings. Added about 2 tablespoons more buttermilk (used white vinegar/milk), also added garlic powder and a little Old Bay when mixing dry ingredients, then sprinkled kosher salt on top of biscuits prior to baking. These were fantastic and super easy to make! Moist, delicious biscuits. 14 minutes bake time exactly for me. Just had a leftover one with breakfast. Yum! Thanks for posting the recipe. My husband thanks you, too. ;)

These were pretty good and very quick to put together for a weeknight meal.  I should have added a splash more milk as others have suggested.  They were a little on the dry side.  I believe next time I will also add a bit more minced onion for added flavor.  These paired well with Amy's BBQ Chicken Salad from Allrecipes.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, trishthedish6!

Followed the recipe with the exception of adding a tablesoon of dried chives. Oh it did take little extra buttermilk. I baked them on buttered pizza stone, which took only a couple minutes longer. I made them small out of preference. I've made many different biscuits this one rocks. I was surprised the dried minced onions worked so well. I plan to use this recipe for appetizers soon.

My wife made me these biscuits and I was really impressed. She did make a few changes: we didn't have onion powder so she used chopped onion (I loved it, but if you don't want the extra texture, she suggests sauteing them), added a little rosemary, feta instead of parmesan (we didn't have parmesan), and added balsamic vinegar to regular milk instead of buttermilk. This is exactly the type of comment I usually hate on all recipes (I love this site), but we are traveling and didn't have everything available to us! In any case, I'm sure that the basic flavors of the original are similar. Bon appetit from your favorite Alaskan Chef!

These were nice, but I think a little more salt and the addition of green onion would greatly improve the overall flavor.  The dough baked up nicely and the cheeses were great.

As the submitter of this recipe, I want to thank everyone for the wonderful reviews. When I developed this recipe I took into account family food restrictions, lower salt but still tasty (me), no garlic (sister-in-law and mother), no "green flecks" in food (brother-in-law). I have tried many of the changes and additions suggested and loved them all. Thanks again for trying my recipe.

Needed more milk to make the dough combine together, about 2 tablespoons more. Also added green onion for color and salt as suggested by other reviewers and these came out wonderful!

MY MOM SAYS THESE ARE THE BEST BISCUITS SHE'S EVER HAD.  I completely agree.  They are sooo good!  I brushed these with a butter/garlic salt mixture, which just took the already perfect recipe over the top.  I served these with chili.  My mom says that the most perfect meal would be: these biscuits, collard greens, and ribs.  Talk about the ultimate comfort foods!  She begs me to make this recipe every night!!

Love these fluffy gems! Truly melt in your mouth biscuits. I did not have sharp cheddar on hand so I substituted a Mexican blend. I will make again, however,  I think I'll leave out the minced onion. It was a little distracting to the cheese flavor and hubby says it don't go well with his apple butter. I believe this is a good recipe that could leave out both the onion and cheese and stand alone or with a drizzle of honey.

I have tried over and over again to find the perfect cheddar biscuit recipe and I finally found it in this recipe.  I didn't have buttermilk so I used milk and 1 and 3/4 teaspoons of cream of tartar (you can also use 1 tablespoon of vinegar or lemon juice plus enough milk to make 1 cup).  These biscuits are awesome!  Never any left overs in this house! Great warmed the next morning with an egg and a slice of ham!

Good biscuits.  Like other reviewers, I needed to use more buttermilk to bring the dough together (about 1/4 cup). While I did enjoy these overall, I wasn't super crazy about the flavor of the dried minced onion...If I made them again, I would use green onions instead.

This is a great recipe.  Very tasty.  I made these this morning and they were soooo good.  I had to add additional milk and I used spring onions.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly as written.  Will definitely make these again.  My wife said they were so good that I was going to have to hide them from her.  Thanks for sharing a keeper.

Very good and very easy. Only thing I did differently was add a little more buttermilk. I made my biscuits a bit bigger (9 biscuits) and they cooked in 15 minutes. Will be making these again for sure!

I prepared the Cheddar Onion Drop Biscuits today. I followed the recipe exactly. My first batch baked for 10 minutes and we’re getting too dark, so I took them out, they seemed done. I lowered my oven to 425 for my 2nd batch of biscuits, they baked to a golden brown in 14 minutes.  I brushed them with melted butter mixed with a little garlic powder. They are moist on the inside & crispy on the outside. We ate the biscuit with my homemade chili. Yum!

Followed recipe, and also added approx. 1 Tbsp of green onion (for colour and taste, per Naples comment).
They were ready after 12-13 minutes,  Very moist, airy and tasty.
I will definitely make these again, and may add some garlic to round out the parmesan taste (which even though I love, is the predominate flavour).  Thanks for the great recipe!!

I found these to be bland, even though I did add chives and used 1/4 tsp of onion powder .  Based on other's comments I should have doubled the salt!  It could easily take a full teaspoon.

For buttermilk I whisked 2 T sour cream in with 2% milk to make a cup, but needed at least another 1/4 cup of liquid just to get the dry ingredients incorporated.  I think I may have overworked the dough trying to mix it all together, as they  didn't seem light at all but very dense and stiff.  

My kids weren't impressed.

This recipe is an absolute keeper! I do however had to add a bit more buttermilk because my dough was too dry. I think because of the weather. Anyway they came out fluffy and downright delicious! Now my personal touch was sprinkling a bit of coarse salt to some of them and then dabbing them with butter lightly. OH SO GOOD! Thanks for the recipe! Will make it again!

Mmmm these were good! I added just a little extra splash of milk and from there I couldn't help but add some garlic, italian seasoning, and extra flavors after reading the bland reviews. This recipe was perfect for the rations and cooking and you can add to them which is always great. Served with shrimp alfredo. perfect!

I was craving something cheesy but it had to be quick and easy to make and boy did I luck out with these. Prep time really was 10 min and they were out of the oven and ready to eat like that.  I did add 1 tbsp butter, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp onion powder, 2 tsp dried parsley to the recipe but that was to get exactly the taste I was looking for. I baked them a little bit longer (20min) so the outside has a little crunch but the inside was soft and airy.  I think I could've taken them out at 18 min...I just wanted them a bit browned too. They're so yummy!! The beautiful thing is you can put in whatever else you like to make them even more special. Can't wait to try it with italian herbs, sundries tomatoes and some chopped black olives too.

Doubled the recipe, and found the dough to be very dry, so I added more buttermilk and an egg. After reading the reviews I added green onion and several spices, also I cut back on the parmesan cheese. But these tasted very good, and my family kept asking for more.

I loved this recipe. Instead of buttermilk, I made my own with 2T of vinegar added to milk then left to sit for 5 minutes. I also added garlic, green onions, and imitation crab meat. My toddler eats it too!

I will not make this recipe again, though I will continue to experiment with other similar recipes--recipes wherein the dough is patted out and cut into biscuit shapes (I believe they might be more tender).  I contributed these biscuits to a salmon-salad lunch that I was invited to by a friend.  My friend liked the biscuits; I was disappointed with them.  I found them tough (and I missed the traditional biscuit cut-out shapes).  My friend kept the biscuits we did not eat for she had made pepper jelly that she thought would be quite tasty on the biscuits.  I did use fresh chives from my garden in place of the onion.  The fresh chives flavor was very nice.

Okay, I know we are supposed to follow the recipe full throttle. I did not have everything but I wanted to do drop biscuits again because of a failed attempt. I made these with and without the cheese and it was good both ways. My children cannot stop eating them. Next time I will make sure to have everything so that they really enjoy them even more. Thx.

Very tasty!  I did do one thing slightly different.  I didn't have dried minced onion so I used fresh onion, and I accidentally used 3 T because I didn't read the recipe close enough.  However, they were very good so I think I'm glad I used more!

So easy, I use fresh onion so I use a whole small onion and add a couple cloves of garlic and mince them in the food processor first.  Also I add extra salt, and sprink a little salt on the biscuits before baking to get that Red Lobster level of saltiness.  :)
