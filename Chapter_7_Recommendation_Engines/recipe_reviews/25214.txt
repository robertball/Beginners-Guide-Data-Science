I made this recipe using a butter substitute, and let me tell you, using a substitute does NOT work. Use real butter. What I used couldn't absorb the honey and ended up looking like a little buttery mess swallowed in a whole lot of honey. I will try it again using real butter.

We absolutely loved this.  Tasted just like the honey butter we get at Texas Roadhouse.  
I softened my butter by nuking it 5 seconds on each side in a small mixing bowl.  Then I whipped it and added the honey (wildflower) and a little bit of cinnamon.  
Thank you very much!

Wow! Where has this little recipe been all my life? You think I'd been deprived as a child... It's amazing how two simple ingredients that you have around the kitchen can come together for something that tastes so good. You definitely have to use REAL butter, (not margarine) that's softened and you'll get great results. I used this on buttermilk biscuits, but can definitely see a lot of uses for this stuff.... Thanks for a great recipe Lovesmurfs!

Took this over the top and made it using homemade butter. (Recipe can also be found on this site)  We've already enjoyed this on muffins and toasted English Muffins. I'm thinking this would be a real treat on popcorn!

Excellent.  Be sure to use salted butter.  I used unsalted and wound up having to add some salt.  Added a dash of vanilla, but it is great without it, too.

This is fabulous atop Pumpkin Pancakes (also on this site)!  Not too sweet, but sweet enough.  Made the initial mistake of first using margarine and while still yummy, the margarine separated making the mixture look odd.  Definitely stick with butter. Mixing in a bit of cinnamon also perks up the flavor.  Thanks!

This is excellent honey butter, but very sweet.  I was serving it with cornbread, which is already on the sweet side, so if I were making this for anything other than breakfast - I would probably reduce the honey to 1/4 cup.  I used my Kitchenaid mixer and whipped this up in under 5 minutes.  The end result was delicious!

this was really easy and good. it was a little sweet for my taste, but that was probably my fault. i was trying to estimate how many 1/2 cups were in a 19oz. tub of spreadable butter.

I made this for the Cornbread Muffins I on this site, and ended up with something I would like to keep for other breads and biscuits!  Thanks for the recipe - who knew something so easy would turn into something so necessary!!!

Yummy.  It tasted great but I wish I knew how to get a better texture.  I used softened butter but it just didn't "whip" like I had hoped.

So yummy and easy.  I used half salted, half unsalted butter and blackberry honey.  I like this, but I think I will try the other recipe on this site that calls for equal parts honey and butter.  This is wonderful on Buttermilk Wheat Rolls.

I loved this flavored butter. I made it for homemade bread, but I ended up putting it on biscuits for breakfast. I liked it a lot more than plain honey which I find overly sweet by itself.

This was amazing. We added a bit of cinnonmin and it tasted amazing. It is a bit sweet but it was what I expect with honey butter. I do suggest making it and letting it set up in the frigde for a few hours though.

Great!  I made no changes.  This was great on warm dinner rolls.  I might try adding a pinch of cinnamon to replicate the butter at a local restaurant.

As others have said... perfect ratio of ingredients. It was great, just as is, but I also wanted to try it with a 1/2 tsp. cinnamon in it. Awesome! Goes well with Classic Bran Muffins (this site)! Definitely a keeper.

I have had this recipe for years. I highly recommend adding 2 tablespoons of orange juice or apple juice for a little bit extra. So yummy!!

Way too much honey in this for my taste. If you want a strong honey taste, save the butter and just use straight honey on your bread.  If you want butter with a slight taste of honey, cut the amount of honey to 1-2 tablespoons.

Scaled this recipe to yield 2 servings. Used unsalted, sweet cream REAL butter and clover honey. Cut the required 2 TBSPs & 2 tsps honey to just 2 TBSPs since it was sweet enough for me and my hubby. Used a fork to mixed things together. Served it with "Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread". Delish! It has that melts-in-you-mouth feel!  NEXT TIME I'll try to add  (1) orange zest,  (2) cinnamon, and/or (3) vanilla.
Thanks for the recipe & reviews! :-)

Really delicious.  I made this for Thanksgiving dinner along with the bread machine rolls on this site, and my family was thrilled.  Thanks for the recipe.  I followed the recommendation of other reviews and used salted butter, not margarine.

This is the perfect proportion of butter to honey.  I put it in my kitchen aid mixer with the whisk and beat it real good.  This is five stars as is.  I then added 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla and 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon and it made it a 10.

Very easy to make, I started with cold butter from the fridge and by the time my biscuits were baked this was ready. I'd forgotten all about honey butter and this brought back many fantastic childhood memories. Thanks!

This is a 5 star recipe as is, but when you add just a little vanilla and cinnamon, it makes it a 10 star.  I will never buy honey butter again.  Thanks so much!

Super easy and super tasty!  Used unsalted butter and only 1/4 cup of high quality honey.  Added:  1/8 teaspoon of Vanilla and a dash of cinnamon.  Great on toast, waffles, rolls, oatmeal, etc...Give it a try!

I made a double batch of this honey butter for our Thanksgiving dinner using clover honey. What a hit!  But I do agree with some other reviews that the honey flavor is a bit strong. Next time I will cut the honey from 1/3 cup to 1/4 cup.

I added 2Tbsp of whole milk to thin the butter/honey mix a bit. It worked perfectly, to make it more of a whipped butter texture. I used salted butter and a hand mixer. I made this, and home made banana bread and took it to a family gathering. The crowd went wild! Thanks a million for sharing such a great recipe.

I've made this many times as is and with modifications. The original recipe is wonderful though I do like to reduce the sugar when I make this as a side to savory dishes. To get an nice crust I also let the baking pan  heat up in the oven with about 1 tbs  butter until melted and bubbly and pour the batter right into the hot pan. So good!

This is an easy recipe if you want honey butter and don't want to buy the pre-made stuff at the store.  I used this on Cinnamon Pumpkin Waffles.  I think it would easily work with cornbread, buttermilk biscuits, and pancakes as well.

I tried this today for the first time all I can say is OMG this is delish . My husband who always says he hates honey  generously spread it on the corn muffins I made. I on the other hand love honey and it was the perfect amount of honey to butter. Will  definitely made this again thanks.:-)

Maybe a little sweeter than my preferance, but still good. Spread on white bread for the bread machine recipe that I got on this site. My mom lit right up after taking a bite of bread with this butter on it and asked right away what kind of butter I used! Thanks for the recipe!

Wow. So easy and so tasty.  I softened butter in microwave at 40% power for 10 seconds on 2 sides: total 20 seconds. Used a stick blender and the chopping blade/container for about 30 seconds. Had to scrape down sides and then pulsed for a few seconds a couple to times. Came out creamy and delicious on warm home made bread.

I saw that someone else said it tasted like Texas Roadhouse's butter.  I love their butter so I made this and also added cinnamon like the other reviewer.  This was great!  I can't wait to try it on more types of bread!

wow I had no idea the butter you get at restraunts was just this easy. I halved the recipe and had slightly less honey than it called for but it was perfect. I think this will be a request anytime I serve biscuits and rolls. This will make a great addition to our holiday table as well.

TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE. I made "Sweet Dinner Rolls" tonight and decided to replicate Ryan's rolls and whipped butter. This came out so good. Add a little cinnamon and you won't regret it.

I did not have any honey so used syrup instead..and added a little cinnamon and vanilla per other reviewer's suggestions. Beat it to death with a mixer and it turned out really good. Served with orange dinner rolls, and I can't wait to have it on top of pancakes!

My best friend introduced me to this recipe this weekend but I make it her way which is using 1/2 c. of honey. Another variation is strawberry butter. Instead of honey, add in 2 tbsp each of strawberry jam and powdered sugar. So good!!

This was really easy and it tasted terrific--just like the honey spread they have at a certain grill/buffet around here. We had a lot left and after being left in the 'fridge overnight it was kind of hard to spread. I think I'll try margarine next time.

This is okay. A little sweet for my taste, but I didn't have it *with* anything. I had some left over butter that was going to be tossed so I decided to make this really quick. I'm thinking it would be good with some biscuits or some warm, medium dense bread.

Delicious and EASY!  I added a little grated orange peel also.  It was fantastic on honey oat bread for Easter brunch.  My mom asked for the recipe and was surprised how easy it really was.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I really like the honey butter with hot biscuits.  It tasted great.  I used less honey because I thought it was sweet enough for me.

MUST USE BUTTER:otherwise, you'll end up with a watery mess!  Tastes really good though.

I made this to accompany the corn bread at out family dinner.  Even my four year old said "MMM, Mommy this is nummy! You should make this all the time."  I think this is a keeper.  Thanks a lot!
