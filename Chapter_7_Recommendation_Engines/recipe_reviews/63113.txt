Easy and tasty! I always pour canned beans in a sieve or colander and rinse well under running water; this step does away with the "gas problem" a lot of people experience after eating beans. Works like a charm! I then use a can of beef or chicken broth to replace the liquid. Also, I fry the onions until soft and almost browned, add the garlic and saute for just 15 - 20 seconds more, then add the broth and simmer until ready to serve, at which time you would add the cilantro. This was a method that a Cuban neighbor taught me for an even tastier dish.

This was so good.  I let the beans simmer on very low heat for about 15 minutes so that all the flavors would blend together well.  I think 5 minutes is not enough, IMHO.  The only variation I made to the recipe was adding some fresh ground black pepper along with the salt.  I used this dish to create the best bean burritos I’ve ever tasted - 1/4 cup "best black beans" + 1/4 cup shredded cheese + 2 Tbs. fresh salsa wrapped up in a flour tortilla, then heated in a skillet (or microwave if you just can’t wait).  I then topped it off with some green onions and sour cream.  Mmmm.  Perfect for vegetarians, too.

Who would have ever thought a can of dressed up beans could taste so darn good! Not your typical mushy beans sitting along a side of mushy Mexican rice.  Just perfect, and as written.  Served this with Chicken Kabobs Mexicana and Mexican Rice III. Can't even begin to describe what a delicious part of this delicious meal this simple bean dish was. Thanks for posting the recipe!

I have been using this site for almost 7 years, and I have never had occasion to write about a recipe, because they usually involve too many revisions.

This recipe, however, was AWESOME, just as is.  It's not for you, if you don't like cilantro, though, as that provides most of the flavor.  We love cilantro, so it was perfect for us.

The hubby inhaled his portion, and when I asked him if he liked it, he said it was a keeper.  If you only knew how finicky the hubby was, you'd know this is a tremendous complement.

I always use organic black beans and rinse them really well before using them in any recipe. I've made these a couple times now--I make them a little more "me" by sauteing the onion and garlic in a little bacon grease, then adding the rest of the ingredients. We all love this, especially my eight year old son who ate every bit of his portion on his plate and asked for mine. I know better now to just double this straight off.

This was fantastic!  Like everyone else, I made some revisions:
Cut down on the onion (half a small onion, minced very fine) and doubled the garlic.  Sauteed the onion and garlic in olive oil until soft and browned.  Drained the beans and added them to the pot with about 3/4 can of chicken broth.  Added the cayenne pepper and 1/4 tsp of cumin.  Salted and peppered.  Simmered for about 20 minutes or until most of the liquid has evaporated.  Dress with about 1 tsp of lime juice.  Its delicious!!!  I also threw in about 1/2 cup of roasted corn from Trader Joe's towards the end which gave it a nice textural interest.  
I omitted the cilantro completely because I'm not a fan of cilantro but added the cumin for more flavor and it turned out amazing!  Served with steak fajitas.

Wow - these definitely are some of the "Best Black Beans" I've had in a while! It sort of reminds me of something I had in a restaurant as a side dish a while back, but better! Who knew something so easy could taste so good - plus it's good for you too! Excellent served warm with a dollup of sour cream on top!

Absolutely delicious! Definitely a keeper, my husband raved over this recipe. I added some cumin and fresh tomatoes then used the leftovers for black bean burritos!  Will make this again and again.

I had one lone can of black beans sitting around forever after countless disappointing bean recipes. FINALLY I found a keeper that received raves all around. I, too, brought the cayenne to boil with the beans, onion and garlic and allowed them to simmer 20 minutes before adding the cilantro. Bullseye. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

great recipe, easy to tweak to make to your taste.  I also, as per one of the reviews, drain and rinse beans when I use them from a can.  I started by frying onion and garlic, added the rinsed beans and covered with a cup of vegetable broth. added a teaspoon or so of ground cumin, the juice of half a lime and some salt and boiled for 15 mins.  then I added the cilantro. I used a good handful of cilantro rather than a tablespoon as I LOVE it!  I sometimes like to mash some of the bean (leaving 1/2 of them whole) with a potato masher to make it thicker...great instead of refried beans in burritos etc...Thanks for a good solid base recipe!

I tried this because another review said that they didn't like black beans but loved this. Well, I do like black beans and didnt really care for this. I think the proportions of onion & cilantro were way too much. I'll keep looking... Thanks anyway

I doubled this and now wish I quadrupled it! I sauted onion, garlic and cumin in evoo, added rinsed beans (can't bring myself to cook them in the canned liquid), added 1.5 chix broth, cumin, cilantro, smoked paprika, TS si si cilantro seasoning and sea salt.  Slow boil (covered) for an hour then took the cover off and let the liquid reduce to none so the moisture was packed into the beans!  This was suppose to be the shredded beef side dish, too bad they're gone! excellent recipe!!

I did a 'fiesta night' dinner last night and used this recipe for a side dish. It smelled amazing when it was cooking and tasted just as amazing. As part of my meal I made the fried jalepenos and the fired up southwest fajitas with chicken (all from this site). If I ever have to live off of beans, these will be the ones I make!!! Thanks for sharing!

Excellent beans even though I think 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper was way too much!!! Even better the next day. Next time I have it I'm making it a day ahead to bring out the excellent flavors. Thanks for the recipe Cameron!!!!!

Excellent side dish with chicken enchiladas- way better than refried beans!  I didn't have fresh cilantro so I used cumin and it was delicious.  My onions were also cooked, so I don't understand others' issues.  Very good!!

This recipe is great!  I did make a few small changes based on other reviews.  I only used half a small onion and I sauteed the onion and garlic in a little bit of butter for a few minutes because I didn't want it to be crunchy.  I also drained the beans and replaced their liquid with about half a can of chicken broth and added more cilantro than called for (about half a bunch).  Finally, I let the mixture simmer for a lot longer than the recipe calls for- more like 15-20 minutes- to let the flavors blend.  I thought the dish was delicious and it paired perfectly with the enchiladas and rice that I was serving.  I will absolutely be making this again.  Final note: the dish might be a tiny bit spicy for kids- easily adjustable by altering the amount of cayenne used.

Excellent recipe as written - - but made some adjustments to suit our taste:  Drained & rinsed black beans.  Sauted onion for a few minutes, then added garlic to saute pan for another min or so.  Added beans, 1/2 can chicken broth, sprinkled in cayenne & cumin, added 2 sm. diced jalapenos and 3-4 sm diced plum tomatoes (w/o seeds).  Let simmer for 15 min.  Then added cilantro and fresh lime juice - simmer another 5 min. Done!  Delish and will be adding this to my Mexican Fiesta rotation!  :)  Thanks!

OMG... these beans were PHENOMENAL.... I would have sworn up and down that you can't make a can of beans taste good but I was dead wrong.  I'll be making these beans again and again.  I didn't change a thing.

I boil the beans with salt until they are tender, about 2 hours, adding water when needed.  I chopped a chunk of onion, two garlic cloves and I fry this until is almost burn. I add some beans and some beans juice, mash them a little and fry  this for about 20 min.  Return this fry beans to the beans pot and boil this for about 1/2 hour. Delicious!!!

This is definitely a keeper! My kids are vegetarians by their own accord so I try to find new ways to incorporate beans into our meals. This was an awsome change. I loved the taste and would make this over and over. I took the recommendation to saute the onions and then add the garlic. Add the seasonings (I just threw in dashes instead of measuring and added salt and pepper). I do not like the liquid in the can of beans and always drain and rinse them so to make up for lack of liquid I threw some chicken broth (which i had in the fridge) but water would do fine too. Waited until most of the wliquid had evaporated and the beans were warm and to the consistancy I like. It doesn't look so pretty, so everyone kind of gave me a look and said what is this- I will admit even I was nervous about how it would end up tasting. Once you put that first bite in your mouth though, you will be asking for more! Definitely make a double batch if you have a family of 4+ as it disappears quickly.

I needed a base recipe to go by to make a can of black beans for the first time. I used the ingredients and amounts in the recipe but sauteed my onions and garlic on low for about 15 minutes. I rinsed and drained the beans and added them to the onion/garlic mixture and added cilantro, chilli powder, cumin, salt, and cayenne pepper. Before I added the spices, I tried it and it was very bland. After adding enough salt and more spices, I got it to taste very well. I did not cook down my beans as long as I should have but the flavor was what I was going for. Added a little lime on it afterwards too.

Everytime I make black beans at home, I find there is something missing.  Finally, I've found an easy, delicious black bean recipe.  Instead of cayenne, I used chili powder (because everytime I use cayenne I use too much and end up throwing out the dish), and as another reviewer suggested, I sauteed my onion in a bit of olive oil prior to adding everything else.  The cilantro is a MUST and I squirted a little lime juice at the end for extra flavor.  This is my new "go-to" recipe for black beans.  Thanks so much!!!

Yum!  Exactly what I was looking for - quick and easy and very tasty!  I also added some lime juice along with the cilantro after cooking.  Received great compliments from family visiting from the Southwest!

MMMM. Very tasty- I added some bacon to the pan first- cooked until browned- then simmered the beans and mashed them- like restaurant quality! Wonderful on tortilla chips.  Vegans and Vegetarians can omit the bacon.

This is a very good basic black bean side dish.  I usually add in a little bit of olive oil and a splash of vinegar right before serving.  *****UPDATE 3.11.17*****  Used fresh oregano today just because I had it, and this was delicious served with yellow rice and grilled Cuban Marinated Steak (recipe also on this site)

I've never been much for beans of any kind. So I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this recipe tonight and found that I actually wanted seconds. I was out of garlic so I used garlic powder. My kids aren't fans of pepper so I just omitted it. The onions gave this a wonderful sweet taste and I loved the cilantro... I added four tablespoons! I could eat this again tomorrow.

This the best black bean recipe. One adjusment: I added the juice of half a lime. My mother who never eats anything loved these.

Yes, HBschoolgirl, this is a perfectly good alternative to homemade! Kudos to Cameron for adding the cayenne and fresh cilantro (nice touch) and being creative. I use canned beans occasionally and appreciate the convenience. Good job, Cameron!

This was delicious! I took the advice of others and sauteed the onions a bit first. I also lightly mashed some of the beans with the back of a cooking spoon for some texture towards the end and also simmered this a bit longer than stated. I did not have cilantro so omitted it. Definitely going to be a regular on my menu.

These were pretty good black beans.  I think next time I would drain some of the liquid, as we found them too watery, and saute the garlic and onion prior to adding the beans to enhance the flavor.  Otherwise this is a pretty fast and easy addition to a mexican meal!

Absolutely awesome. I like black beans alot but wanted a tasty way to make them as a side dish with a Mexican dinner. My problem with black beans is that they tend to be bland and it can be hard to serve them by themselves and have them taste good too. I found this recipe and gave it a try, it made all the difference in the world. I will certainly make this again.

These were amazing!  I added 4 cloves of garlic just because I love garlic and added the cilantro as a garnish when I took the pot off the stove.  They tasted just like the black beans I had at the Cheesecake Factory.  Will definitely be making again.

Even my 3 yr old enjoyed this ! He asked for seconds. I followed this recipe with  some of the suggestions with other members.  Started with a couple of spoonfuls of butter garlic, onion and bell peppers over low heat and then followed the original recipe.  Added some ground cumin and the lime juice as suggested and it was amazing!

I didn't have cilantro on hand, so I boosted the flavor by adding chili powder, cumin, and parsley. Very yummy.

Delicious!  I needed a black bean recipe to serve with Chicken Chimichangas with Green Sauce and Mexican Rice III (recipes from this site).  I have made these beans several times using some of the suggestions from other reviewers - I drained & rinsed the beans and added them to the onion and garlic which I had sauted in a little olive oil.  I also added 1/2 cup of chicken broth & simmered the beans for 25 min.  I made these tonight & served them in a shallow 2 qt. dish with Mexican shredded cheese melted on top and sour cream on the side.  I have also topped them with green onion.

These were good.  I followed the recipe to a "T', except at the end I added a sprinkling of shredded cheddar cheese (it was out anyway, since it was Taco night) and swirled that around to let it melt.  I wasn't overly wowed by this dish, but definitely a nice way to jazz up a simple can of black beans.

These were terrific!  I upped the fresh cilantro slightly from 1 T to 2 T and as did many others, added the juice of 1/2 a fresh lime.  Simmered 15 minutes and served to rave reviews!

Great simple recipe.  I used Goya black beans with a little more cilantro and less pepper.  The recipe calls for quite a lot of "heat" if you put that much cayenne in.  Nonetheless, this recipe is simply delicious!!  A nice, traditional Central American version.

A great way to spice up canned black beans.  Next time I would saute the onion a bit before adding the beans and bringing to a boil.

really are the best black beans i've ever had.  bf always asks for them prepared this way.  

i don't like cilantro so i chop very fine and only put in half.  also cook all at once - put everything in a pot, bring to boil, cover & simmer.

This was great!  I love black beans, and this was a fantastic way to prepare them.  I modified the recipe slightly: instead of using the juice from the can, I drained it and used water instead.  I also added one chopped tomatillo, a tablespoon of butter, and a 1/4 tsp of cumin.  I used it as a filling in tortillas with lime juice, salsa, and a little cheese.  Definitely making this again.

I fixed these beans with chicken fajitas for dinner tonight.  My husband and both liked them.  I had read most of the posted reviews and made a few of the same changes.  I simmered them a little longer & cut down on the cayenne pepper.  They are easy to make and very tasty. A great way to get a little more fiber in your diet and low in calories! I will be using this recipe again!

Perfect as written for super fast weeknight cooking.  I had a little more time so I also added canned chipotles in adobo sauce and a few tablespoons of the cooking liquid from the pork roast I had in the crock pot.  Simmered for 20 minutes then mashed about half of the black beans for more of a "refried beans" type side. I also topped with a little bit of shredded smoked gouda cheese.  Everyone loved it.
Rinse the beans first for fresher taste and less sodium.
I served this along with pork roast and yellow rice.  I added sauteed onion and diced canned green chiles to the yellow rice then garnished the rice with sliced green onions.    
I had just a little bit leftover the next day so I reheated with a tablespoon of salsa then made a burrito.  Really good.

I love making this recipe.  I read the reviews and put the suggestions together.  I saute the onion and garlic, drain and rinse the beans, add chicken broth, bring to a boil and simmer for 30 minutes and add lime juice and then cilantro.  Non bean eaters will even eat this.  Delish!  I don't add salt as it's in the broth.

delicious.  took the advice of another reviewer: sauteed onion and garlic in olive oil first, added 1 cup of chicken broth, then seasonings and drained, rinsed beans.  intended as a filler for an already great meal, these were easily my favorite thing on the table.

I liked this, but think it would have been better if I had sauteed the onion and garlic first.  I rinsed the black beans  (the "juice" that they're in is very high in sodium plus harder on the digestion) and then covered them in low sodium veggie broth.

This simple side dish is surprisingly good. I served it together with Carol's Arroz con Pollo (also on this site) and the entire family loved it -- even my wife, who "hates" beans of all types, said that these were good. I drained the beans and then rinsed in a colander before cooking. I also sauteed the onions and garlic for a few minutes with approx 2Tbs of butter before adding the beans. The end result, while having a few more calories from the butter, turned out very tasty and well-paired with the rest of the meal. Have made twice now and has been very well-received both times.

I use this recipe for everything! It is simple, but delicious. I always add a bit of water and a cube of chicken boullion to it, it adds so much flavor and makes a great side dish.

Thanks Cameron for a great basic recipe.  It was exactly what I was looking for:  simple and flavorful!  I did add the lime juice as suggested by others and it went from 5 stars to 10!!!  I doubled the recipe, mashed the leftovers, put in a casserole dish, topped with shredded cheese and froze it for later use.  This is one recipe I will be making often!

Delicious!  Simple & easy with great flavor!  Used other's recommendation to drain beans & replace can water with chicken broth. Made this several times using veggie broth instead.  This is a family fave, especially for picky vegetarian son!

Exactly what I was looking for when I went looking for a black bean recipe. They are spicy though, so you might want to cut the cayenne back if you are serving to kids or others who don't appreciate the heat factor!

This was delish.  I made a mistake and added the cayenne early on - and I also drained and rinsed the beans.  when I did that I realized that it was pretty dry - so I added some chicken broth.  It was spicy & delish.  Everyone had at least two helpings!!!

I've never had Black Beans before and the only mexician style food I've had is Taco Bell- Hey I'm Canadian there is NO authentic Mexican restaurants here peeps! But I found this really dry- I rinsed out the black beans out of the can and added the rest of the ingredients exactly as written, but I couldn't get my son to eat it- so word of warning- this is not children fare.

Instead of 16 oz, I put in 24 oz beans, eliminated the onion and garlic and put in about 6-8 oz of fresh salsa.  I threw in a pinch of dried cliantro for an extra kick. Eliminated the cayenne.  It's already spicy.  Put in 2 packages of cooked Uncle Ben's whole grain Santa Fe rice with corn, and spices.  This comes in ready to micro packages that cook in 90 secs. I cooked the rice first then threw them in.  Put "4 cheese" mixture  top and cooked 350 until warm and cheese melts.  So easy and you can make it ahead!  No mess in pots.  I put it directly in Glad square pan!

These taste great and are so easy!  I had to double the recipe so I ended up using one can of black and one can of kidney beans.  Also added a can of diced tomatoes and a half a can of corn.  Upped the cilantro to about a cup (my roomie LOVES cilantro) and added a bit of cumin.  Very good!  Thank you!

Great flavor for such a simple recipe.  I took others' recommendations and rinsed the beans and used about 1/3-1/2 cup of chicken brother. IMO, 5 mins is not nearly long enough to cook the onions. I ended up simmering the beans for about 15 mins with a lid on the pot, then I took the lid off and simmered an additional 5 mins to thicken everything up. I added the cayenne with the garlic and onions, and stirred in the cilantro right before serving. A keeper!

Rated 3 stars for recipe "as is" because using the canned liquid is yucky. But with the tweeks others suggested, I give 5 stars as an delicious way to do black beans. First I cooked diced onions in butter until caramelized, added lots of fresh garlic, seasoned with S/P, 1 tsp cumin, and 1Tblsp hot chili powder because that's what I had on hand. Then used chicken broth as liquid with the rinsed beans.... Brought to boil, simmered covered about 30 mins, then cooked uncovered til thickened. Dressed with fresh cilantro and squeeze of lime before serving. It was a hit with my friends and family for Mexican night.

Love, Love, Love these!  I make them all the time, and especially like to eat a steamy bowl of these spicy beans with a piece of pita bread for lunch.  I do change the recipe a little, although it is good as written.  I sweat my onions in olive oil (1.5 T) for about 8-10 minutes, until they are slightly softened but not fully cooked.  While those sweat I rinse a can of black beans thoroughly (leave the beans in the can and just keep adding water until it drains clear).  Once beans are clean add enough broth (whatever kind you have) to fill the can back up.  When onions are just barely starting to brown add 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp cayenne, and cilantro (which I increase to 1/3c. chopped), cook for another minute and then add your can of beans in broth.  Bring mixture to a simmer and allow to simmer until liquid is cooked down to a desired consistency, about 10 minutes(leave 'em soupier if you want to soak up the broth with bread, or cook 'em longer to make them creamier if you want to use them as a side dish), add more salt to taste if needed.  I serve with a little fresh chopped cilantro on top.  These are truly the best black beans ever!

Did not care for this...the cayenne just did not belong & the onion chunks were wierdly out-of-place.  Was hoping for something similar to what I have had many times at Cuban restaurants in Miami, & this was not it.   Would recommend finding a good Cuban recipe for black beans...felt like this needed ZERO cayenne, ZERO chopped onion, more garlic & perhaps slow simmer with a bay leave.  Move on to a better recipe!

This is an easy, delicious, healthy and cheap side dish! I followed KitchenDiva's modifications (rinse beans, saute onion and garlic first and add a can of chicken broth) and added a big squeeze of lime before serving.

I usually just heated up a can of black beans to put over rice, but this made them taste so good!  I did change it a bit.  I skipped the cilantro and the cayenne and added some fresh diced tomatoes a few minutes before I took them off the heat.  I was never a big fan of black beans, but I love this recipe!

Followed the first review by Kitchen Diva, rinsing the beans and then using a can of chicken broth to cook the onions. Really made plain ol' beans much more exciting with little effort. I made this for a big Mexican style Christmas feast, and it was very easy to whip up on the side while doing other more complicated dishes. Definitely will do again. People were using them as a side, in their tacos, scooping them up with chips, etc. Very versatile!

So easy to make and perfect for a week night dinner.   They were very flavorful considering they cooked for so little time.  I did use seasoned black beans in order to get a little extra flavor.

These were easy and very good, and I didn't even have any cilantro to add.  Cilantro would take these to an even higher level.    Will make again for sure.

This recipe is a fast and easy remedy for plain black beans from a can.  It had a nice heat, and the fresh onions and cilantro brightened the taste.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I still like the long way better, but I don't always have the time!  Thanks for the idea!

I should preface my review by stating I've never really eaten *just* black beans before.   I think I've had them once, many moons ago, at a Chili's (and thought they were ok), so I really had no expectations.  These are great!  It's hard to believe canned black beans doctored up so minimally can taste so good.  The only sub I made was to sub parsley for cilantro per personal preference (fellow cilantro haters, this is a great sub!).  I served this w/"Mushroom and Goat Cheese Quesadillas" from here for a wonderful (meatless!) meal.  THANKS, for the recipe!

I feel guilty because I've been making this recipe at least weekly for almost two years and have never reviewed it.  I just think it is magical how one can turn a simple can of black beans into such perfection!  Based on other reviews, I made the following modifications:  saute the onions and garlic in oil before adding the other ingredients.  when I have it, I use fresh coconut oil to saute, which adds a nice Caribbean feel to it.  Thank you so much for this recipe!  I can't believe I lived without it.

As written, I give the recipe 4 stars. 

Based on other reviews, I rinsed the beans in cold water to clean off preservatives & decrease gas.  Then I added 1/2 cup of beef broth (could use chicken) to replace liquid. I sauted onions and garlic until golden brown and added them to the pot of beans.  I brought beans to a boil and then let simmer uncovered for 15 minutes to blend flavors. I added cilantro to the pot a few minutes before putting in serving dish. 

Got many compliments at the Mexican potluck dinner tonight, and my serving bowl was practically licked clean, lol.  That's always a good sign. 

Next time, I will try allowing them to simmer on low for a few hours in a crockpot to mix the flavors even more.  I left out the cayenne, and I will add that or chili powder next time.  Adding a garnish of chopped green onions and sour cream sounds yummy, too.

Thanks for this great recipe and all of the wonderful ideas from readers.

I assumed I had a can of black beans in my pantry seeing how I typically do but I assumed wrong. All I had that even came close was a can of Speckled Butter Beans and it turns out they worked great in this recipe too. This was a perfect side to my main dish. I topped with some bell and jalapeno pepper and this was excellent. Who would have thought a can of beans could be dressed up in such a manner? Loved it Cameron!

Delicious.  I am going to add cumin next time (cause we love the stuff) but honestly this recipe needs no tweaking at all!  (Okay, okay, I minced the onion and garlic instead of chopping it, but that's a personal textural preference.)  Great stuff - a staple for our taco nights, for sure!

This is a good recipe and I always use this quick version when I don't feel like cooking my Dominican black beans which is kind of time consuming. I love them with tacos or picadillo.

Delicious recipe and so easy to make! I actually put olive oil in first, then sauteed 4 cut-up green onions (because that's all I had), a clove of garlic, for about 2 mins. Then I added the can of beans, 1 table spoon of cilantro, a dash of cayenne pepper, half a teaspoon of cumin,  bit of salt & pepper. I let simmer for 10mins and just before serving, I added a teaspoon of lime juice! MMM so good. I had it over lpani white rice with some grated old cheddar cheese on top.

Thought this was a great recipe and will make it again. I did add the onions, garlic, and cayenne pepper at the beginning and let it simmer for 15 minutes. I then added the cilantro and 1.5 tbsp of lemon juice. Topped it off with a little bit of chopped tomato and green onion.

Very tasty.  I sweated the onions in some olive oil and then added the garlic and sauteed for a few minutes before adding the beans and spices.  Then boiled for about 10 minutes until liquid thickened.  We ate them with shredded pork shoulder and home made guacamole.  Best carnitas I've ever had!!

My hubby and I loved this recipe! We're both vegetarian and this was an ideal dish. I took a reviewer's advice by using simmering the beans in chicken broth, I skipped the onion (only because I was out) and I used a variety of spices and a hint of honey.  This came out delicious. Thank you for a healthy, budget-friendly recipe.

Didn't care for them at all. Not a whole lot of flavor up front, but very spicy after effect. Mine turned out really mushy, doubt the mushiness was the recipe fault, but the flavor was not what I was hoping for.

Wow, I really like these. I eat pretty simply & this was simple, clean and good. I didn't use the salt because canned beans are high in sodium. I did cook them a bit longer, because hubbie is not a fan of crunchy onions. Thanks!

Can't really rate this, because I was just asking a question, but it sounds awesome, so I'm going with what I have a inner cooks feeling it would taste like. 5 stars!  Can I use fresh black beans??  I was wondering why folks are saying 'fresh' black beans when they are out of a can.  I grew black beans in my garden this year and can't for the life of me find any real fresh black bean recipe.  Maybe I need to let them all dry then rehydrate??    Any info would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!

Really good!  Followed suggestions of another reviewer.  Sauteed the onions and garlic first. Rinsed beans and added about a cup of beef broth.  Simmered until thick -- about 15 to 20 minutes.  Added dried cilantro because that was all I had.  Omitted cayenne pepper for my 2 year old.  It definitely would have been a good addition.

Nice way to take canned beans from boring to best.  These were so good I wish I'd doubled the recipe. I did simmer everything but the cilantro for about 20 minutes.  I added the cilantro and simmered another 5 minutes - cilantro is better added at the end and not cooked to death. Could cooking it too long be why some people don't like the cilantro?  I served this with meatloaf, but will certainly be making it with Mexican dishes from now on.

This was surprisingly flavorful, but the cilantro is definitely a must. I mixed together everything except the cilantro and let it simmer for an hour while I waited for my husband to come home with the cilantro. I tasted it while I was waiting and was totally not impressed. It just tasted like starchy bean liquid with a heat from the cayenne pepper. After I added the cilantro and let it simmer for awhile, it was a whole different taste--a hundred times better. We both liked it, and then I added some lime juice, and that is a great optional addition, but following the recipe and using the cilantro is a must.

Just okay. Not as flavorful as I hoped, but good mixed in rice for tacos. I added lime juice per other reviews. I'll probably try this again, but next time add more cilantro, garlic, cayenne, and maybe some cumin.

A HUGE hit with everyone at the table, including the cook, who loves simple, fast dishes. I might add a tad less cayenne, but it's definitely a "keeper" in my book.

This is actually my second review of this recipe. After making these beans many many times now, thought I'd post the tweaks that I sometimes make for a slightly bbq version - just a slight variation, but really kicks it up. Simply add 2 tablespoons sweet & spicy bbq sauce and a few dashes of cumin. This is a great side dish for barbecued ribs or chicken. I still use the original recipe when I'm going all tex-mex though.

These are the only black beans I've ever had, so I don't know if they're the best--but, I won't be trying any others because these were very good! I'm going to try making burritos with them like other people here have suggested! I added more cayenne because they weren't spicy enough for me. Next time I might also let them simmer longer.

Excellent recipe as-is!! Keep in mind- these are quite spicy!! However, they are fairly complex in flavor, and simple to make. I generally cheat a little bit with fresh pre-diced onions from the produce section, jarred minced garlic, and dried cilantro, but even with these shortcuts, this recipe is fantastic!! I will note that you'll want to make sure you are making the correct amount for immediate consumption, as most of the flavor will be gone after sitting in the refrigerator overnight, or longer. I love the recipe how it is, however I happen to have reduced-sodium black beans on hand, and even when using these, and not adding any salt, they are still great, in case anybody is trying to minimize Sodium. Fantastic recipe- give it a try!!

Easily the best Black Beans that I have tried.  I made one revision using a tip from another reviewer.  I drained and rinsed the black beans then added broth to replace the liquid.  Beans were very flavorful and went well with our Mexican themed dinner.

These were amazing, and I even used dried cilantro since I didn't have any fresh on hand. I can only imagine what they taste like with fresh! I thought "this recipe is way too simple to produce great black beans." I was way wrong, they taste just like they're from a mexican restaurant! I did follow other reviewers suggestions and rinsed the beans then used chicken broth as a simmering liquid. The next day I combined the leftovers with white rice & other mexi toppings for a great burrito!

Followed the tip of sauteing the onions first and replacing the water from the can with a little chicken broth. Delicious beans. Made it first with black beans and second with pinto beans. So good. THANKS!

Wow, these were from a can? Weird how such a simple recipe can end up tasting so good. Great for a quick weeknight dinner. Made this with the Simple Carnitas and Camp Cornbread recipes from this site. Delicious meal!

I always "doctor" my beans out of a can... whether it been baked beans, ranch style bean or now black beans... I served this with a Ropa Vieja. It made a nice side to go with it.  Simple yet versatile..

I thought this was ok.  It was definitely easy to make and very quick, although I had to cook mine a little longer to get the onions cooked a little more.  I think this had a little too much onions though.  If I make this again, I'll have to cut back on the onions.

This is very good. We don't like heat, so I skipped the cayenne and added just a smidge of chili powder and cumin instead.

I sauteed some onion and minced garlic in a little olive oil. I added a rinsed and drained can of black beans and sauteed for a minute. Then I added 1.5 cups of water, a dash of chicken bouillon, 1/8 of a teaspoon of cayenne pepper and 1/8 of a teaspoon of Sazon Goya seasoning. I topped with cilantro and allowed to simmer on low for 5 minutes. Very easy and tasty.

I had never made black bean before, so I decided to try to recipe... I was reading the reviews and saw one that the person rinsed the beans and then added them to chicken stock, I did just that, 2 cups of water and 2 chicken bouillon cubs. The only thing I did not use on this recipe is the cayenne pepper. These turned out wonderful. I never thought I would like black beans, however, I do!

I rarely use canned goods anymore, but I decided to try this recipe and it was delicious.  I only used a very small amount of yellow onion, chopped fine, included one green onion, chopped thin, and quickly sauteed those with the garlic in a drop of olive oil just to make the flavors burst.  It was spectacular!  Thank you!

Very good as written, better than most restaurant fare, yet still needed a little something to really make it sing. I added 1/8 teaspoon cumin to increase the Mexican profile, and a splash of lime juice for zing. The cilantro went in right before serving to keep it's flavor bright. I garnished each serving with queso fresco for flair.  Result? The Best Black Beans!

I loved the flavor of these black beans!  I subbed cumin for the cilantro because my fiance and I aren't big cilantro fans, and I didn't add any salt.  I would recommend cutting the onion way down, though.  I used less than half a large onion instead of a whole small one, but it still seemed like I was having beans with my onions.  About a quarter of a large onion would be plenty OR you could double the beans since they will be great as leftovers.
Thanks for sharing!  This is in my permanent rotation since we are big south-of-the-border food lovers.

Easy way to dress up a simple can of beans. I've had them in my cabinet for a while, but didn't want to fix them plain. I used KitchenDiva's advice - cooking the onion and garlic before adding the beans, and replaced the juice with chicken broth. I didn't measure out the cayenne, but I wish I had since we couldn't even taste it. Husband and I both liked it!

I thought this turned out pretty good. super easy. I did have to add a bit more seasoning for my taste and didn't have cayenne pepper so i used taco seasoning. I actually ended up adding a some shredded cheese then dipped chips in it.

So good! Rinsed the beans and put them back in the can and then poured chicken broth into the can until full to replace the liquid. Didn't add as much onion. Added some cumin because we like it. Thank you for a very good recipe!

Very good. I made a few minor changes: sauteed the onions for a few minutes before adding garlic (for another minute or two) then beans. I added a small chopped tomato with the cilantro, and I used about 1 1/2 tablespoons of cilantro because I love the flavor. I also added a little bit of diced jalapeno instead of cayenne. Finally, I simmered for 15 minutes or so to boil off some of the additional liquid from the tomatoes.

A versatile basic recipe. I added a small can of mild chopped pepper, along with a teaspoon of whole cumin seed. It is even better the next day, so make twice as much as you might need.

These were pretty good. I used Busch's reduced-sodium black beans and didn't add any extra salt. Make sure not to drain the beans, or the garlic and onions will not have liquid to cook in. I cut the onions small, but still added an additional 2 minutes to the cook time to make sure they were completely softened. I also let it sit for about 10 minutes off the heat which helped too. Very quick recipe.

Wonderful.  Quick, simple and tasty.  Followed the advice of washing the beans first and then using broth, and also added the 1T fresh lime juice.  A meal on its own.  My husband loved it and will definitely be making this again.

Very good! I substituted celery for the onion, added a red bell pepper and a jalapeno. Also added a splash of lime juice and a bit of chili powder. Served over brown rice with a chicken thigh.

My husband loved this. Normally we cook the onion and garlic in broth and then add the beans, but I followed the recipe and he liked it better. I used a little less than 1/4 tsp cayenne...and probably will use less next time :P I added a little vegetable broth to "boil" the beans, as well as a bit of pepper. I simmered for maybe 15 minutes and then I added a few squirts of lime juice and a few shakes of dried cilantro (couldn't really taste it, but I didn't want to overdo it). Will definitely make again!

Simple, fast, and delicious. I made black beans for the first time using this recipe, and it turned out to be wonderful. I used Goya black beans, drained about half of the water, and also mashed them a little while simmering - that way, they turned out thicker. Other than that, I made the beans exactly the same. Thank you for sharing this simple recipe!

Absolutely delicious!!!!. This is the first time i've had black beans and i must say i'll be having it very often from now on. I made a stir fry with the onions and garlic, and added some chopped tomatoes and jallapino pepper (to make it my own), and it came out beautifully. Definitely a keeper!

I wasn't a huge fan of this recipe, maybe I am just not a black bean eater. I thought the spices would give it just what they needed, but I was not a fan.

Really good but I added cumin, lime, and chili powder to the recipe after numerous tastings. Also, I can't but canned beans here so had to pre-soak then cook the beans. Maybe this has something to do with overall flavor?

Simple, flavorful and healthy! I rinsed a can of organic black beans. I then used a half of cup of low sodium chicken stock to boil the beans in the pot. I added chopped white onions, just a little, garlic clove, chopped, and seasoned with salt and black pepper. I left out the cayenne pepper(personal preference). When I served the black beans I sprinkled some fresh chopped cilantro. I found the beans very tasty and seasoned just right for me and my family. I served this with, "Mexican Rice III," and "Chicken Kabobs Mexicana," also from this website.

Very yummy! Before I added the onion & garlic to the beans, i sauteed them in a little olive oil & added some chopped green chiles. When the beans were done,  I served them over some rice, seasoned with just lime, and sprinkled some cotija cheese on top. It was delectable!

I've never made black beans, and I found this recipe by just searching. This was very easy & tasty! I added some lime juice, and had to used minced onion, garlic & dried cilantro, but it was great. No Cayenne for us since it was for the whole family. But my 6 year old loved the beans and had seconds!

We thought these black beans were great as a side dish with enchiladas. I think next time I will cut down on the onions a little, but it was still very good. Simple and easy, it didn't take hardly anytime to make. Thank you for sharing a great recipe!

Excellent flavor. I followed the recipe perfectly and it was great. I think next time I may put a little less pepper in it because the kids had trouble eating it because of the spice. For sure will stay in my recipe box. this ones a winner!

These beans are great and so simple to make.  The directions don't say how much water or how long to cook, so I guessed.  I added about 2 -  3 cups of water.  Boiled on high for 10 minutes and simmered on low for about 20 minutes.  Added the spices and that was it!  I had to stop myself from eating all of the beans at one meal!  This will be a regular dis for me.

So simple and flavorful. I used chili pepper because I didn't have cayenne pepper and I used more cilantro than the recipe asked for because I like cilantro. I added a can of mixed vegetables to the black beans and made a bean and vegetable burrito.

This is a great black bean recipe. I took advice from past reviews and reduced the onion to my preference (about 1/4 of a small/medium onion) and cooked with chicken broth. The beans came out very spicy for me so I will cut the spice in half next time I make it. :)

Very good.  Added diced red & green bell peppers to add more nutritional value.  Be sure to rinse black beans before cooking.  Cuts down on the sodium and the gassy effect after eating.

I made this for Cinco de Mayo at the office and it went over well.  I doubled the garlic and cilantro (I'm from New Orleans, and like strong flavors).  Followed the rest of the recipe as written, except after simmering for a while, I poured the beans into a shallow casserole dish, topped with half a cup of shredded cheddar cheese and baked for about 15 minutes.

Nobody in my family liked this very much. I was hoping that adding additional flavors to the canned beans would make them special, but it didn't. This won't be a repeat, sorry.

I must say, when I made these three days ago I was not impressed. I'm heating them up right now and did a taste test and they are fantastic. I think the key is to making them ahead or giving the flavors more time to meld. Again, they are fantastic now. Thanks for the recipe.

Good beans. I followed KitchenDiva's instructions, but did not add a whole can of broth, so mine were a little dry.  Next time I will definitely add more broth.

Wonderful!!!  We added way more garlic and cilantro and replaced the cayenne with lots of black pepper.  We also added 1/2 a green bell pepper, sauteed.  Will make again for sure!

Family was skeptical, as we normally don't do anything with beans but make refried and chili. They liked this very much though. It is very easy to make. I did saute the onions to soften them and swapped out oregano for cilantro as husband can't stand it. Team with slow cooker carnitas and Mexican rice 2 for a good dinner!

These were extremely easy to make and very tasty, so I can see myself making them often.  Followed the recipe as written, except drained and rinsed the beans and added about 1/2 cup water. Garnished with sour cream and salsa and served with tortilla chips.

These were really good - they had quite a kick (as I prepared them, anyway).  Like other reviewers, I drained and rinsed the beans before cooking, using chicken broth instead for the cooking liquid.  I also sauteed the onion before adding the garlic, then added the beans and broth; I also added a touch of smoked paprika.  I added the fresh cilantro just before serving, and I sprinkled my sometimes-picky husband's portion with a little shredded cheese to entice him - he really liked them.

This is a simple, easy recipe with unlimited room for experimentation. But being a southwestern boy looking at the pictures begs the question: Where *ARE* the black beans?

This recipe is great as is! No changes are necessary :o) Just for the heck of it, I added a splash of lime juice as one reviewer mentioned and I liked the tang, but I think it would be just as good without it! Thanks for a simple and delicious recipe

well, i didn't have any fresh ingredients on hand (we've been out of town so the fridge was bare) so i modified with garlic & onion powder and gourmet garden cilantro in a tube (great stuff!).  and after rinsing the beans (which i always do to cut the sodium) i followed the lead of another reviewer and used boullion (something i've never done) and the taste was terrific!!  i basically just used i tsp of better than beef boullion to 8 ounces of water, added the rinsed beans, sprinkled both powders to taste and simmered for 30 minutes so they would thicken a bit.  right before i turned the heat off i added a generous spouge of cilantro  paste, and presto, delicious black beans. just like spaghetti the next day, i know these will be super tomorrow. yum, yum, yummers!!

Nice and simple.  I followed the recipe, except, let the beans simmer for 10-15 minutes.  I think a few small changes will make this a mexican-night staple.  Double the garlic, add a bit of fresh lime juice, and a little bit more cayenne pepper.

This is a tasty, simple bean recipe.  I used white beans and simmered for probably 20 minutes, or more.  I loved the creamy texture.  I want to try with black beans next.  We had this with Dominican chicken, brown rice, sliced avocado and fried plantains.

This was awesome!  Will definately make with every Mexican dish from now on.  No left overs.  For my picky (6&3) kids who do not like spices, I added a little sour cream to offset any heat.  They loved these.

I  added cumin, lime juice & real bacon bits...sweated the onion, garlic & spices in EVOO for a few minutes & then added the rest of the ingredients & simmered for an hour or so. It ran dry a couple of times so I added vegetable broth. I didn't have any fresh cilantro so I used cilantro-in-a-tube...it's in the refrigerated section of your produce department. Served it w/ Mojito Chicken (from foodnetwork), mango slices, Mangoritas (from this site) & Impossible Coconut Pie I (also from allrecipes)...great dinner that my guests reallly enjoyed. Thansk for the recipe!

Excellent. Although, they can be ready in the amount of cook-time the recipe indicates, I found the beans were a little tough and the onion still a little too crisp for my liking.  With 40 minutes cooking, however, they were done to perfection! Be careful not to burn them, though.  We used left-overs (I doubled the recipe) on burrito night! They were even better the second time around!

After simmering these on the stove for the recommended time, I thought they were really blah. I put them in the crock pot on low for 2 hours and that seemed to bring the flavor out much better. My hubby loves black beans and thought these were good, but I am still going to search for a recipe with a bit more flavor, or at least try these again with some lime juice.

This is very good for a canned bean recipe.  I'm not usually a fan of canned beans!  The only changes I made were to add a lot more cilantro than the recipe calls for and I simmered the beans for about an hour.  The 5 minutes isn't nearly enough.  Served over white rice and it was very tasty!  Thanks.

As written, this was a little bit boring. I added a shake or two of garlic powder and some ground cumin. It might have benefitted from some crumbled bacon too. With adjustments, it turned out pretty well. Thanks!

Surprisingly good!  I didn't think such a few simple ingredients would taste so good.  Sometimes black beans have a taste that is strong, but sauteeing them with these other ingredients really mellowed them well.  And doubling the cayenne gave them a big kick!  I also added some lime juice as some others suggested.  Will definitely make again.

This looked like a good basic recipe. I read through the reviews and made a few revisions: Saute the onions in avocado oil until soft and almost browned, double the garlic and saute for just 15 - 20 seconds more. Drain the beans and rinse well under running water. Add them to the pot with about 3/4 can of vegetable broth. Add 1/4 tsp of cumin and chili powder.  Salt and pepper to taste. Simmer for about 15 minutes or until most of the liquid has evaporated. Dress with about 1 tsp of lime juice. Add the cilantro.

Made this last night for a birthday party for adult son. Everyone raved about this dish. I doubled the recipe,  didn't add any more salt and partially drained one can of beans. I also let it simmer longer while the rest of the dinner came together. Served it with Mexican rice III from this sight, a big green salad along with chicken and beef tacos with all the toppings. Dinner was delicious and we have hardly any leftovers for tonight's dinner.  Will definitely make again.

These beans have a lot of flavor--loved them.  Used less cilantro.  Used dried onion and garlic powder.  Could top with a little cheddar cheese, but not necessary.  After draining and rinsing beans, pour a little chicken broth in with them for moisture when heating.

simple and delicious!  i followed the recommendations of other reviewers; drained and rinsed the beans and substituted homemade chicken broth for the liquid.  i also simmered for approximately 15minutes to allow more time for the flavors to come together.  this was an excellent side dish for dinner last night.  i'm generally not a fan of beans, but enjoyed the flavors of this dish.  i'll be adding this recipe to the rotation.

I didn't give this recipe 5 stars because I did make some changes. This recipe is very simple, and may be great as written, but I think it needs a bit more flavor.

I used cooked, dried black beans that I had soaked and cooked the previous day, and poured off some of the cooking liquid so that the beans were just covered. I don't rinse black beans that I cook because I feel that some of the nutrients of the beans are in the cooking liquid. Rinsing them after the soak eliminates the "gas" problem. 

In addition to the onion and garlic, I added lemon juice, fresh ground cumin, black seed (because I didn't have enough ground cumin), and apple cider vinegar. I brought this to a boil, and then let it simmer on a medium-low heat for about 45 minutes so that all of the flavors would blend. 

I made a large quantity, and will freeze it in portions for use as a side dish and to use in burritos and enchiladas. I think these beans would also be good if mashed and used to make re-fried black beans. The flavor is absolutely wonderful, and it's a great way to introduce nutritious beans into your diet.

This recipe was really simple and delicious. My first time picky eaters and 3 year old twin daughters even ate it. I'm a stickler for flavor and this had just the right amount to go with my burritos. The only thing I changed was the cloves of garlic, I put a pinch of garlic powder in instead and I microwaved them for 5 mins. Perfect side dish.

Great side dish with Mexican food. Used the liquid from one can so it wouldn't be so watery and skipped the cilantro since I'm not a fan.

These are delicious!  However, I wish I had read a few other reviews before making them.  I always drain and rinse my beans before using them.  I failed to make up for the loss of the liquid by adding some back in.  Next time I'll use some broth.  Otherwise, the flavors are great and the recipe is very quick and easy.  Thanks for posting!

I usually skip the cayenne & put a few teaspoons of salsa in instead. If it says a whole onion, I don't use that much. About 1/2 an onion for 1 can of beans.

Yum!!!Great & super easy vegan dish. I added 1/2 cube of veggie broth, 1/4 cup water, & chopped up chili peppers to the recipe, which turned out to be delicious!!! I can probably eat this every evening!!! :)

This was so easy and so tasty I can't see myself making black beans any other way now.  And I make them A LOT. I made this as a side dish to a salmon and avocado dish I found a recipe for and also served Jasmine rice.  This is going to be a staple in my household now.

Excellent black beans with a good, slightly spicy flavor.  I left the cilantro out because I was serving this with cilantro lime rice.  I am vegan so this was my main dish and I served with a side of broccoli.  Yum!

You werent kidding, these are the best black beans ive ever had. I cooked the onions in a spot of oil for about 5 mins before adding the beans with liquid. Slow cooked this for about 30 mins before adding the seasoning. Really made them thick and delicious, I highly recommend it.

It's very decent. I would probably use a lot less cayenne pepper next time or the kids won't even try it ~ but I will definitely make again. I need more beans in my life >

I drained the beans and washed them several times until the water was clear.   I then sautéed the onions until tender, then added the garlic.   I added the onion/garlic to the beans and some chicken broth, then added the cayenne pepper.   I simmered them for about 30 min (omitting the cilantro), then served them.  Delicious with the Chipotle Shrimp Tacos and Lime Cilantro Rice recipes!!

This works even when you don't have fresh cilantro--adding citrus peel, or tumeric, or sour cream (greek yogurt), or a pat of butter, you get the idea, give you endless variations!   I drained off most of the starch by rinsing as kitchendiva suggested of the canned beans first before cooking to help the other flavors come thru.  

I have vegetarian and non-vegetarian family to cook for, and on those nights when I make a meat entree (chicken curry) this is one of the easiest and quickest way to add a good protein for my veggie guy  With the rice and chutneys that are curry sides, this is perfect and actually finish up the protein.

Great! Like another reviewer advised I added a little chicken broth, also added a little salsa.  Made for my Mother and Father on Christmas Eve, my Mother told me afterwards that she had never liked black beans and she just tried them to be polite.  After trying them she went back for seconds and has made them herself since that night! Awesome recipes.

It was pretty good, but WAY too much cilantro and way too much garlic.  U need to double the amount of black beans and 1/3 of the cilantro and garlic it calls for.

Not bad, but I added some chili powder; also added some fresh lime juice and used chicken (could use veggie) stock during cooking, reduced and mashed a portion of the beans. Added cilantro last.  Then these were the "best black beans"!

Well Cameron, this is going to sound a little odd but I made these for breakfast this morning. lol I was just poking around, looking for recipes to adapt to our camping trip (open fire and dutch oven cooking) and came across this. It sounded so yummy (and quick and easy) I wanted to try it right away. It's all those things, yummy, quick and easy. And for the record, makes a delicious breakfast. lol

EXCELLENT!!!  I love black beans, i really didn't know there was anything you could do to make them even better.  Silly me.  BTW I don't love cilantro, so I used it sparingly, a tsp per 15 oz of beans worked for me.

These were great made as is - except I drained the beans (by accident - didn't read it through) so I ended up using a bit of beef broth to compensate and just fine.   Next time will not drain the beans and I am sure it will be just as good.

Perfect side dish to enchiladas. I rinsed the beans and added a cup of chicken stock for moisture and flavor. Yum!

This is my favorite way to make black beans. I add in lime juice, a little cumin and a splash of chicken broth and let them simmer for awhile, mashing them slightly with a potato masher along the way. I add in way more cilantro than the recipe calls for, along with some minced jalapeno. I made this for my family once on a trip back home and my grandpa said he didn't know beans could taste this way! Thanks for a great recipe!

This is okay in a pinch when I can't make my beans from dried, but the recipe itself has WAY too much onion in it. I used a quarter of an onion and it was still too much.

UPDATE-made this again with dried onion instead of fresh and it was delicious. Will definitely make this again using dried onion.

Delicious, simple, and nutritious. I like to turn it into a main meal by keeping the liquid from the canned beans and adding some chopped roasted chicken-- it's like stew for lazy people! I also used black pepper to taste and 1/2 tsp chili powder instead of the cayenne. And for cilantro haters like me, don't worry, it's still wonderful without the cilantro.   Bottom line: It's not a terribly exciting meal, but its surprisingly comforting food for nights when you can't muster up anything complicated.

These are the best.  I did prepare mine slightly differently, though.  I sauteed the onion and garlic until tender and added the black beans, which I had drained and rinsed.  I added beef broth to replace the liquid I had drained off.  I let the beans simmer for about 15 minutes and added more broth as needed.  Delicious.

Wonderful, I served these delicious beans with the Mexican Rice III and Chicken Kabobs Mexicana. What a perfect meal!  Once I got it together, I did add another can of beans, maybe my small onion wasnt' small enough, but the ratios didn't seem quite right. The extra can made it better and gave me more leftovers! Yippeee

I had almost a full can of beans leftover from the southwestern egg rolls recipe I got from here, so the wife and I figured we'd give it a shot. Neither of us really had black beans before, but we weren't all that impressed. I followed the advice of some raters and added lime juice, but it was a bit too much. I don't think anything was wrong with the recipe, but they just weren't that impressive.

I mixed all ingredients together after draining and rinsing the black beans.  I added a little water to replace the fluid discarded from the beans and brought the mixture to a boil.  Then I simmered on low for about 20 minutes to let the flavors blend together.  This is a very enjoyable, very flavorful side dish.

These beans were great!  I did not add onion only because I didn't have an onion.  But it could have only made it better.  I'll try it next time.  I waited until the beans had simmered to add the cilantro and I also added the juice from half a lime.  This is so easy and so good.  I would definitely recommend this recipe.

I loved the recipe once I had made my changes to it: I added green pepper, tomato, and cumin. Without those additions, it still would have been pretty good. I don't use canned beans, so  I soaked and cooked the black beans til done, drained them, and  added chicken broth to the mix because I didn't have any of the beany water from the can. This was perfect served with rice.

Very bland and needed a lot of playing to make them good. We ended up serving them over Mexican Rice III and they were great. 3 stars because of all the doctoring and then adding them to another recipe to make them work.

This recipe is so basic and so good.  Beans have that "restaurant" quality flavor.  I have used this same recipe with pinto beans as well and it turned out delicious.  I generally make these at least once a week and use the beans in breakfast burritos with scrambled eggs, jack cheese, sour cream and salsa or put them in tacos for dinner.  Delicious! My one piece of advice is to check your brand of beans for salt content before adding any. Some come already salted and can make the dish quite salty. Also, I always drain the beans but keep the water to add when/if they dry out while cooking.

I had been looking for something to serve with  Tequila lime chicken and this was it!  I doubled the beans, because I never can find a small onion and it was just too over powering with one can.  I also added lime juice and omitted the garlic.  Delicious!

I've been looking around for quite some time for a black bean recipe that replicates what we got at a little restaurant in Miami on a family vacation when I was a kid. This is the closest I've found yet. I let it simmer longer than directed to let flavors mingle a bit; I then let it stand for another 15 minutes or so before serving it over rice cooked in chicken broth.

Delicious!  I made this recipe as a side with the Jerky Chicken recipe found on this site.  It was great.  I sautéed the onions and garlic in a tiny bit of olive oil before adding the black beans.  I also added the cayenne and a bit of lime juice at the same time as the beans.  I simmered for about 30 minutes before adding the cilantro for the last 5 minutes.  It turned out great!  This will be a standard side for Mexican, Caribbean or South American dinners at my house.

I made this for a dinner party.  Everyone complimented it, but I thought it was just ok.  Good, but not "knock your socks off".

Nice recipe - went well with cheese enchiladas. 
To the "reviewer" complaining the pic is of red beans - black beans will not photograph well. To everyone else - use whatever beans you happen to have - this recipe works well with most -

I started with this recipe ,then after a few times I started experimenting. I add chicken broth and puree half of the beans to make soup. I have also added cooked bacon and mashed all of it to make refried beans, both are loved by all.

This is a quick and easy side dish for all types of Mexican food. My family especially likes it with chicken quesadillas.  I make it for lunch sometimes and serve it over brown rice.  As a personal preference I add cumin and leave out the cilantro.  There's  just something about cilantro......

These were sooo good.  I sauteed the onion, then the garlic in a bit of olive oil first. Keep in mind that it does not make a great deal of beans.  Next time I will probably triple the recipe.  My husband is Mexican and loved it.

Very nice indeed, garnished with the pico de gallo recipe on here.  Instead of cilantro (a friend doesn't like it) I used some flat leaf parsley and cumin.

Really good! I used a bit of lime juice, put in more garlic, and substituted the cayenne (didn't have any) with some red pepper flakes and chile powder. Still could have used a little something. Perhaps it's more tasteful with the cayenne.

Great tasting beans! I tried adding 1/2 a lime like others have mentioned.... was not too thrilled with the results. I even doubled the recipe, and left the lime at 1/2 and still all we could taste was the lime! I think this recipe was just fine without it!

Tasted before and after addition of cilantro and it makes the dish, don't leave it out.  Didn't use the cayenne, used Hot chile sauce instead, tasted like restaurant quality, served topped with chilled diced tomatoes to balance the heat

Great recipe! Very easy to make.  I combined all the ingredients and put it in a crockpot and let it simmer for a couple of hours.  This is definitely a keeper.

Really delicious.  I used TWO cans of beans which worked out great since it cooked down so much.  I ended up letting simmer for an hour as others suggested.  For the spices at the end I added a good tablespoon of cumin, a 1/4 cup (at least) of cilantro, a sprinkling of cayenne, squeeze of half a lime, and salt to taste.  Next time I'll put in my slow cooker!

Delicious!  My family likes REALLY spicy so we added just a touch more of the garlic and cayenne.  These were fabulous!  We let them simmer for over 30 mins so they would thicken up just a bit.  Thanks for sharing!

Five stars with the changes I made. Didn't add cayenne (didn't have) and was out of garlic. Seasoned with adobo and added 1 small can of tomato sauce. SO good!! Tasty recipe that can be easily be altered. Oh and I agree with letting it simmer for two or so hours. Really brings the full flavor through.

Maybe I'm just a weenie, but I thought it was a little spicy and wish I would have added the cayenne pepper "to taste".  Other than that, this is a very good basic black bean side dish, I'm excited to try adding some different spices next time!  I made it with "Salsa chicken" on this site, and it was dee-lish.

Good and simple side dish recipe.  I served with enchiladas and spanish rice.  Since I don't like crunchy onions I cooked my beans about 20 minutes.  They are definately easy and better than opening a can of refried beans.

This really perked up my plain black beans.  I added the onion, garlic, along with the cayene pepper, and I added a smidge of corriander.  I let it simmer for about 20 minutes, then I added the cilantro.  My dh and ds both were happy with it, especially my dh.  It was a great way to brighten up a somewhat bland, but healthy dish!!  Thanks for sharing it.

Good, basic way to liven up beans.  I had made beans from dry, so needed to add liquid.  I went with what I had and used a cup of water and a chipotle cube (like chicken bouillon, only chipotle).  Good choice for a fairly easy side.  I also sauteed the onion, then the garlic first as someone else suggested.

I made several changes to the recipe, and I was extremely pleased with the result.

1. Sauteed the onion and garlic until soft, before adding the beans. I also threw in some chopped bell pepper that i had on hand, and that was nice.

2. Drain and rinse the beans thoroughly. (This removes the starches that cause gas.) Add 1/4c chicken broth.

3. Simmer uncovered until beans are soft and liquid is reduced.

It was so easy to make and required so few ingredients.  The only thing I did was to puree this which I thought made it taste better.

I tried it without the cilantro: just beans, onion, garlic, salt and cayenne.  It was good; a bit spicy, but not overwhelming.

Try this excellent recipe.   
I start by draining the canned beans and rinsing well.  I fry the onions about 5 minutes, until soft and almost browned. I add the minced garlic and sauté for 15 - 20 seconds more. I add about 1 cup of beef broth and the drained beans and simmer until the liquid reduces, about 10-15 minutes.

It was really bland following the original recipe, so I added three times the recommended garlic and paprika. I also added cumin , garlic powder and onion powder. After making those adjustments it was good!

Even better if you soak a bag of black beans overnight. Then drain, rise and add one quart of chicken broth and 1 cup water. Bring to a boil and cover and reduce heat to a simmer. Add in the onion, six cloves of garlic and a some diced bell pepper too. Continue to simmer for an hour and a half. Season to taste. Not too difficult and the taste is amazing.

REALLY good. I took the advice of another reviewer and drained+rinsed my beans before adding them to the pot. Substituted the missing liquid with a little chicken broth. Great kick from the cayenne.

This is indeed a simple AND delicious recipe so right up my alley!!  Since I didn't follow it "exactly" (ok, barely---we don't like cilantro and no garlic since Dad isn't fond of it), I didn't want to give it 5 stars.  Per other reviewers I also drained and rinsed the beans.  Browned onions, a bit of green pepper and some fresh tomato, all diced, in bacon fat.  Added 1/2 cup of broth to the pot after I added the beans and this made a delicious sauce.  Seasoned with some cumin, homemade seasoned salt and a quick sprinkle of cayenne.  Love the ease of the basic recipe which allowed me to be creative within our personal taste preferences and with what I had on hand in the house.

I love this, though I modify it quite a bit. I soak black beans overnight then pressure cooker it for 15-20 minutes, then drain. In another pot, I saute onion and garlic in around 1 1/2 tbsp olive oil, add the beans, water, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper and cumin powder. I add bell pepper, sliced onion and cilantro if I have any toward the end. Next time I will try it without sauteing the onion and garlic to make it power in calories.

This is amazing and sooo simple. I love the cilantro and can’t get enough of it. Be careful adding the chili pepper because it will give this dish the kick. If spicy isn’t your thing use very little or omit. I love the kick!!!

I omitted the garlic and maybe shouldn't have. We found it kind of bland.  Maybe a little hot sauce? It was an ok side dish.

I followed the suggestion of draining the can of beans, rinsed them, and used chicken broth for the liquid. I sauteed the onion before adding everything to the pan, added the spices and decided to add a pinch of cumin. I cooked that together for about a half minute and then added the beans and broth. The fresh cilantro was added at the end of the cook down of liquid until it was reduced by about 1/2, so cilantro was about 2 minutes in the mix before I pulled it off. Very good!

Made these beans to accompany burritos  and they were excellent.  Made per the recipe with the exception of adding some cumin.  I did saute the onion until it was soft as my husband does not like raw onion.  I also added more cilantro than stated in the recipe because we love the taste.   The 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne does give the beans a good kick....all round very good.

Simple and easy to make, these beans are delicious. I used homemade beans, not canned. Thank you for the recipe.

Giving 5 stars for how easy this is, simple ingredients but great flavor. I did make a few changes but I think the base recipe would be good either way. I always rinse canned beans. Also I sautéed the garlic and onion a bit first and added some diced tomato and diced green chilies. I used about 1/3 cup chopped onion. Only had dried cilantro, but wouldn't skip it (I'm on the pro-cilantro side). Used about 1/2 tsp. dried cilantro and a pinch of cumin. Simmered about 15 min. Delicious. Next time I'll prepare with a squeeze of lime and top with queso fresco...YUM

First time I made it I threw it away as onion and garlic were overpowering.   Second time cut way back on those.  Then drained and rinsed beans and used chicken broth.  Simmered down until thick. Added cilantro at the end. Was delicious!! Got lots of compliments.

This was too spicy for us. We fix spicy dishes and use the black beans as a way to subdue the taste buds while still tasting sweet.  Cayenne powder is not really the way to go.....

The next time I made it using can beans, I added one bay leaf,  sauté the onions with bacon bits (Hormel) with a little olive oil and a dash of cumin...follow the rest with the cilantro and cayenne pepper. It was worlds away better and it did not take a minute longer.

Love the beans! Made recipe with no changes. Made for sons had their sch Ol graduations family party. Served  with lime cilantro rice and flank steak in the “best ever marinade” and got HIGH reviews from all  of our guests.  Had to give out ALL the recipes to my neighbor  because she wanted to fix the same dinner for her family...she liked it all so much!!! Have fixed several times now and will continue to be a keeper!

GREAT recipe!  I did decide to do a few things differently.  I sauteed 2 garlic cloves (not one) and the small onion in 1 tbsp of butter first until tender.  Then I added the black beans (I drained and rinsed them before adding) and the remaining ingredients as called for.  I covered them and let them simmer on low for 10 minutes.  They were AMAZING!  Served these with the spinach cheese enchiladas.  YUMMY!!!

Recipe as is 4 stars. To make it 5 stars, and absolutely the most amazing beans I've ever had: Sauté 1 onion and 6 cloves of garlic. Rinse and drain beans. Add to saucepan. Add 1 cup water. Bring to boil. Add 1/4 tsp taco seasoning, 1/2 tsp salt (approx.), dash of cayenne (I like them pretty salty, adjust to taste). Reduce heat to medium and cook for 10 minutes. Add additional water as needed to desired consistency. Mash some of the beans with your spoon, to help thicken the mixture. Reduce heat to a simmer until ready to serve. Seriously though, this was so amazing. I am not a bean fan, and this has already become one of my favourite dishes now!! The additional butter was a huge game changer.

Tasted great! Got an idea  somewhere else to add a bit of chicken broth and olive oil and it made all the difference. My boyfriend loved it! Said it was the best he'd ever tasted. Also substituted the onions for shallots since I don't like onions. So essentially this recipy was just OK but GREAT  with my additions.

This was ok.  I made it as the directions indicated.  I think I would spice it up a bit with maybe a fresh jalapeño and some cumin.

Great basic recipe for black beans! 2nd time around making this recipe and I drained/rinse the beans and added just enough water to barely cover the beans. Chucked in a cube of sofrito too. As written or with my minimal changes, very good recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Loved this!  I sauteed about a 1/4 of a small onion (finely chopped) and 2 tsp minced garlic in olive oil until tender.  Then added the beans, 3/4 of the bean can filled with chicken broth, 1/4 tsp of salt and cumin and brought to a boil.  Simmered for 20 minutes until liquid boiled away.  Served topped with lime juice (didn't have cilantro but will add next time),  Delicious with any mexican meal!

I added a shot of dry sherry, half cup of chicken broth and a couple pinches of sugar to this to give it a little more zing!   I simmered them for about a half hour, adding a bit of water when needed.  Itsa keeper!

I love beans and could not wait to make this. I was not disappointed. I doubled it, rinsed the beans and added chicken broth. I did add a few shakes of cumin as it goes in almost everything I make with beans. Thank you for posting this wonderful recipe!!!

I LOVED IT!!! I did take the advice of the first reviewer and drain the beans, (forgot to rinse to avoid gas, will definitely do that in the future). Plus added chicken broth for flavor! Also, not into spicy so added a sprinkle of Cumen instead of cayenne and a little salt. Followed rest of instructions..,..Came out WONDERFUL!!!!!!

I only used 1/4 onion and left out the cilantro, though I'm sure it would have been good with it. Instead, I added a few sliced mushrooms, minced celery, Braggs seasoning and 1/2 tsp Better Than Bouillon. 

Served topped with an over easy egg and a side of toast.

This taste horrible. The onions and cilantro overpowers the beans. I wouldn't recommend this recipe.

This ishow I make my black beans. I do add a can of diced tomatoes and here's the kicker... Add about a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar or to taste.  It kicks it up a notch.

Loved it,  I used 3 whole greens onions (greens and all).  Also put in a couple of shakes of Chipotle Cinnamon rub instead of the cayenne.

This is the black bean recipe I use. I don't usually have cilantro. Rinse the beans and set aside.  Fry the onions until soft and almost browned, add the garlic and saute for just 15 - 20 seconds more, then add the beans and 1 cup chicken broth to replace the liquid.  Simmer at least 10 minutes. Don't forget the horchata!

I've made this 3 times in as many months! So good! I used shallots instead of onions once, and just as good. I've gone spicier, and milder. Very versatile. I don't even need the recipe anymore.

Hold the onion, add cumin. Light cayenne. I usually use paprika instead of cayenne. Chili powder works well too.

It's a really deliscious recipe..i used onion powder instead of onion and red pepper flakes instead of cayenne pepper. The combination of cilantro and garlic flavor along with the black beans is amazing.

This didn't work for me. It was bland and by the time the garlic was cooked the beans were almost over cooked. Won't be making again.

this is surprisingly good for as few ingredients as there are.  one thing i'll try next time - cooking the onion and garlic *before* adding the beans in.  also - i almost added a tomato for more liquid but the beans give off a lot of liquid (especially since they're not drained).

Love this recipe!! I lived for seven years in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, and fell in love with the black beans and rice that our Cuban friends made. I made a good dozen recipes before I found this one--and I stopped here! This is the most similar to what they made in both taste and simplicity. Sometimes I use fresh beans, sometimes canned. Sometimes I fry up the garlic and onions a little before adding the beans, sometimes I don't. Sometimes I put the cilantro inside, sometimes I use it as a garnish. The recipe is as flexible as it is perfect!

Excellent recipe. I omitted the cayenne pepper as I don't see cayenne in black beans.. maybe chili, chipotle or jalapeño, but cayenne seems out of place here to me. Nonetheless, it came out very tasty for a quick and simple black bean dish and it is a recipe I will return to for sure.

This is delicious!  I did as others suggested by sauteeing the garlic first and simmering everything except the cilantro in chicken broth for 20 minutes not only to let the spices settle but to soften the beans. I added the cilantro with about 5 minutes left to simmer.  I used onion powder for the onion since I didn't have one on had.  This is a keeper for sure!

I had to do some doctoring to make it work for my taste. 5 minutes is not enough to cook the beans, and there's not enough seasoning to compliment the amount of onion required. It ended up tasting like hot onions and cilantro. I recommend a longer cooking time in order to allow the flavor to mix.

This is a good base for a recipe. I drained the liquid from the can (to prevent gas as other users recommended) and replaced it with chicken stock (to add more flavor). I sauteed the onions first. I added cumin, all purpose seasoning and the tiniest bit of cinnamon. They were a hit with my boyfriend.

This is a great side dish for a Mexican dinner night. Just a little heat to add a zip.

Loved loved loved this super simple and easy yet delicious recipe! I did add freshly squeezed lemon juice at the end to my beans added a little extra depth to it! I also  sautéed the onions in a little bit of extra virgin olive oil then added the beans. Will be making this weekly now!!  I can use it in so many different meals!! Thank you for this recipe!

I seldom like beans but I loved this. I followed everyone else's tips and sauteed the chopped onion and garlic, rinsed the beans, made up for the liquid with 1/3 cup water and one beef bouillon cube and added the juice of half a lime. Add salt, sugar and cilantro to taste. Delicious with toasted corn tortillas!

Love this recipe! My 11 month old and 4 year old both gobble this up (I usually simmer for 20 min or so, so the beans are nice and soft for a baby with 2 teeth :). Even good if you don't have cilantro! I never really made black beans before I found this recipe, now I make them all the time. Great for a fiber-ious lunch put in a quesadilla :)

Made this for Cinco de Mayo and even the non-bean eaters loved it.  I did take the recommendations of others to rinse the beans very well and replace the liquid with chicken stock.  I sauteed the onions until translucent then added the garlic for 1 minute.  I added Badia Complete Seasoning at the end with juice of 1 fresh lime.  I served it with Mexican Rice III (this site) and Mammoth Burritos (diff site).

Best Black Beans Haiku: "Yup, they ARE the best. I add a splash of sherry. So easy to make!" Well golly, fast to throw together and very tasty - complements just about any entree, or would probably be just as good rolled up in a tortilla w/ some fajita chicken. Can't believe I'm just finding this recipe now; DAMNYUMYUM.

Great taste, easy to make, healthy...  A winner!  I rinsed the beans and added some veg broth.  Sauteed the onion and garlic before adding to beans.  The cayenne pepper and cilantro are perfect in this

This dish was only ok, and I will not make it again but will make try other recipes.  It worked well when used in a burrito with the Best Spanish Rice recipe from this site (which is very good), some bbq sauce, shredded lettuce, and more chopped cilantro.  I tasted it before adding lime juice, and it was definitely helped by the lime juice.  One cup of dried beans soaked over night, then cooked, created the right amount of beans for this recipe.  I did brown my onions first and then added garlic and then beans like a reviewer suggested.  I do agree that a longer simmer time is necessary--though in my case since I wasn't used canned bean liquid, it was more a longer cooking time (I did throw in a bit of water if it started to look dry).  This is an easy and serviceable recipe, but I will keep looking for something really excellent that can stand on its own.

So simple but super tasty.  Sauteed the onion and garlic in a little olive oil beforehand and used 1 cup of chicken broth instead of the liquid from the can (that seemed kind of gross to me).  Simmered for a while as I was making the rest of dinner, probably 20min total.  Next time I think I'll throw some corn in.  Excellent, simple way to spice up a can of beans.

Oh yum.  These were delicious!  I made a few minor changes ... first, I used green onions instead of white (just personal preference).  Second, I drained and rinsed the beans first and replaced the liquid with chicken broth (I just don't like the liquid in the can).  YUM!  Even (most of) my kids asked for seconds!

These are fabulous and SO easy to make! I followed the recipe exactly and these beans were perfect, and very tasty over brown rice.  With some fried plantains I have myself a traditional and simple Puerto Rican meal.  Very satisfying--thank you for the recipe!

A great way to spiffy up canned black beans!  I added a minced fresh jalapeno and substituted chipotle powder for the cayenne.  YUM!

I'm not a huge fan of black beans, but these will convert me. I drained the beans and added about 1/2 to 3/4 can of beef broth like others suggested. Also added red peppers, cumin and lime juice.

A great, easy recipe.  I doubled it and took it to a Cinco de Mayo party, and it was a fast hit, primarily because it was unique.  I did add a few pinches of cumin, put in a casserole dish and sprinkled some store brand shredded Mexican cheese blend on top.

These are really yummy!!!  The only thing I do differently is that I saute the onion and garlic in a little olive oil before I add the beans, and I use a little chicken broth to cook in.

Nice though not spectacular.  I would fry the onions first simply because I like onions better that way.

Couldn't stop eating this dish!  My kids (ages 14, 6 & 4) agreed!  Definitely add a lime in the last few minutes of simmering.  It was quick, easy, and delicious - just perfect.

What a great way to 'doctor' up some canned black beans.  I also drained the beans and added some chicken broth.  I used chopped red onion and fresh cilantro. I simmered the beans for about 20 minutes and they were nicely thickened. The spices were just right...not too spicy, but flavorful.  I loved these.  My teenage children didn't want to try them....their loss.

This was sooooo delicious!!!  I was wary as I had only had black beans in chile, but now is a fave!  I rinsed the beans and added 1.5 cups of chicken stock, and 1 tbls of chicken bullion. Also didn't have any cilantro so used a teaspoon of parsley instead.  So good!

I really liked these, but my fiance wasn't too impressed by them. I think next time I would cook them in either beef or chicken broth to add a little more flavor. I also might add some chopped bell peppers. Thanks :)

These are wonderful and very easy. Even my 4 year old picky eater likes them. I do cook them longer than it suggests and add a bit of water if needed. Great inside burritos or alone!

Double yum if you add bacon.  Keep t simple and use the pre-cooked kind.  There may be some left over tacos, but their won't be any leftover beans!

Surprisingly good.  I didn't have a small onion on hand so I used 3 chopped green onions and it seemed to work well.  I didn't drain or rinse the beans, either, so I'll see you in bed tonight, my friend.

This was a great recipe, but I was nervous right up until I tasted it! I used only half a small onion since I'm not a big fan. I also simmered everything for about 45 minutes in 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth. I added some cayenne pepper right at the end and topped each serving with a bit of shredded monteray jack cheese. My husband liked them but asked me to roll back the heat a little.

These beans are tasty. If you like black beans, this side dish is quick and easy. The only negative, for me, is that the flavors were not complex enough, but that's just me. Good beans. Try them.

My onion must have been rather large as it seemed like way too much for one can of beans.  I also added a little beer and simmered longer to reduce a bit.  Yum!

Awesome Black Bean recipe!! I tweaked it a little, like I do whenever I cook. haha

First I put a little bit of extra virgin olive oil in a pot and sautéed a few cloves of garlic and like half an onion (both diced). I rinsed the black beans under cold running water, because I don’t like the viscous goo that is in the can, and added them to the pot. I then added about half a can of chicken broth and let it cook for a bit. To thicken it up, I mixed a little bit of cornstarch and hot water in a mug and slowly added it to the mix a few teaspoons at a time. I let it cook on medium heat and thicken up. Then I added the cilantro at the very end. Awesome!! I used it as a burrito filling with a few other recipes I found on this site!

Per recommendations, I altered this recipe a bit. I sauteed half an onion (with some garlic powder) in olive oil. Added one cup water and a beef bouillon cube. Brought to a boil, and added my drained black beans, salt/pepper, and some cayenne. Boiled off most of the water (~10 minutes) then added fresh cilantro and simmered. Served topped with fresh chopped tomatoes, next to creamy chicken enchiladas ("Chicken Enchiladas II" on this site) and homeade salsa. Great meal. I gave it 4 stars because, though good, it didn't wow me.

I don't usually like black beans plain, but this really dressed them up in such an easy way. I too added a little cumin and more onions than called for, and at the last minute I chopped up half a tomato and stirred that in too. Very good.

easy and good!  I had everything on hand for quick black bean tacos.  sauteed the onions and garlic in some canola oil spray before adding the moderately drained beans to the pot.  I then mashed some of the beans for a thicker consistency and that worked well; it was even thicker the next day and perfect for leftovers.  fresh cilantro is key!  thanks for sharing!

These were very tasty!  I added some fresh lime juice and about 3/4 teaspoon of cumin and used them for bean burritos.  Yum!

These were very good. I didn't have cilatro so I left it out. I'm sure it would have been better with it. I also added a bit of cumin. I didn't measure ingredients so mine were pretty spicy but I like things spicy! These were yummy layered inside my chicken burritos.

Oh my GOSH, this is so good.  I cooked the recipe as written, but I let it simmer on the stove for about 45 minutes.  Very tasty beans, I will make these again.  Thank you for the recipe!

Not sure what the buzz is about - after all the fantastic reviews, I was expecting a bit more. "Boring and bland" was my husband's comment. The red pepper added heat, but not a lot of spice. Overall the flavor was dull - it needs a good bit of doctoring to achieve a 5-star rating, in my opinion.

I was dreading taking out the can of black beans I bought, but decided to finally do it before they went bad. This recipe made them absolutely delicious! I also let the ingredients simmer for about 15mins and I only had a red onion, so that's what I used. The only thing that I think would make these more awesome is sprinkling some Jack cheese on top.

Thank you, thank you.  I could never make good beans until this recipe.  I added tomato sauce and green chiles b/c I like them saucy and it was wonderful.

Cooked for about 45 minutes, added cumin, ground red pepper, and garlic powder during cooking.  Used more cilantro than called for. Very good - my boyfriend who was very leary of the beans at first ate three helpings.

This is a staple bean dish in my house!  I usually make it along side Cilantro-lime rice and then on burritos.  They taste just like one of those famous chain burrito places.  Thanks for the recipe.

These were quite tasty.  I ended up using red pepper flakes instead of cayenne pepper and I didn't measure it so I ended up using a few too many and it turned out a little spicy.  That was obviously my fault though and other than that I thought they were quite good.  This is a good way to spice up black beans.

I liked this.  I ate it with the Asian Coconut Rice recipe and a piece of salmon.  (Asian and Spanish food, interesting combination.)  I think it needed a little more flavor, so next time I make them I'll add a little more salt and possibly a little more garlic.
