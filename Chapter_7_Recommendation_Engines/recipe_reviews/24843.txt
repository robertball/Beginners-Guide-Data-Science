Very moist and with the glaze, this is more like a coffee cake. (Use powdered sugar for the glaze and increase by 2 tablespoons to thicken or else it's too runny and will run right off the cake)  It's VERY soft coming out of the oven, so once it's cooled, cover it and refridgerate for a few hours or overnight to let it set or it will break coming out. It sets up like a bread the next day. And this is one recipe where adding too much blueberries will work against you.  I've tried 1 1/2 - 2cups and it was way too much.  Ended up with blueberry cake and too much juice inside.  As the recipe suggests, use 1 to 1 1/4 cups, no more.  I have used frozen blueberries with no problem.  Be sure to coat berries in flour (fresh or frozen) to prevent them from sinking too much.  Most of them sink anyway, but a little flour does help. Use quality bottled lemon juice and it will taste just as good.  With frozen berries, I had to bake for almost 70 min. I've also put a brown sugar struesel on top when I want a little extra crunch and sweetness.  **Tip - in the last 10 min. of cooking, brush the top with some of the glaze and put it back in the oven.  The bread absorbs the glaze in the oven and won't be too wet.  Brush on remaining glaze once it's done.

Wonderful recipe.  Quick and easy to make and it's so good!  The only I might change the next time is reducing the lemon flavor just a bit, so that it doesn't overpower the blueberry taste.  I think the last time I made this, I had pecans on hand, so that was what I used.  I think the nut aspect is a personal decision, whichever you want to use.  This time, I have walnuts so that will go in it.

I was thinking that using powdered sugar would be a good idea for the glaze the first time I made this and seeing a review from someone else with this suggestion means I will have to try that as well.

Solid recipe. Good lemon flavor. The texture is more cake-like than bready. I did not use the nuts. The first time I made this recipe all the blueberries sunk to the bottom (even though I dredged them in flour) and a big chunk of the loaf stuck to the bottom of the pan. SO, the next time, I put only half of the blueberries into the batter, then poured half in the pan, sprinkled with blueberries, poured the rest in the pan and finshed off the top with the last sprinkle of blueberries. Turned out perfect.  Both times I brushed on the glaze about 10 minutes after I took the bread out of the oven.

This is a lovely loaf with a cake like texture, moist with lots of flavor. You could smell the lemon while it baked. I have a couple tricks though, that puts this loaf at 5 stars! First, add the lemon juice to the milk and let it sit while you prepare the other ingredients, this will make a buttermilk. Second, add the lemon zest to the sugar first and stir it around with a fork, this will release the lemon oils into the sugar and give it more flavor. If using frozen berries, toss the blueberries with a little flour to coat before adding to the batter, this way the berries will not sink to the bottom of the pan. I have made this several times following the ingredient amounts exactly and it always works out great!

awsome loaf- everybody loves it! I will make a note to say to use fresh lemon juice, not the bottled stuff. I made it with both and the fresh is way better. The bottled stuff made it taste a little bland. I make it without the glaze and it is still fabulous.

I just had my first slice of this ( I couldn't even wait for it to cool down!), and I just had to come on here and rate this recipe... It is phenomenally delicious!!! Because so many reviewers were raving about this "bread" seeming more like a cake, I decided to increase the recipe by half and bake it in a 9" round pan. I followed the recipe exactly, only doing a bit of improv with the glaze. Firstly, I kept the sugar/lemon juice proportions outlined in the recipe, the only thing I did was add a couple teaspoons of grated lemon peel to the sauce, then popped it in the microwave until it was boiling. I did this so that the glaze would be more like a syrup, and because it was so watery and grainy without being cooked. The added lemon peel makes the glaze taste just like candied lemons, and what I did was drizzle on top of the cake during the last 10 minutes of baking. The cake didn't come out soggy at all! In fact, the glaze I made soaked nicely into the top and created a delcious, slightly crispy and shiny glazing to the whole thing, with little flecks of candied lemon peel here and there... Truly, a lovely presentation and the taste is out of this world!!! It's lemony, but also very blueberry and the combination is dynamite! Highly recommend this recipe!

This bread is great. It has a delicate almost cakelike texture and is super easy to make.  If you want to use it at a bake sale then I recommend that you line the bottom of the bread pan wit h wax paper so it will release from the pan in one piece.

I omitted the walnuts, added two cups of blueberries, and the zest of three lemons. This came out more like a cake. Very good!

With a few changes, this bread is wonderful!!  I used a little over 1 T. (3 lemons) zest and it came out just fine.  I also put some milk, lemon juice, 2 T. butter (no dieting here!), and powdered sugar together for topping.  This was put on just after coming out of oven, in pans.  The bread soaks it in and helps loosen up any pan sticking.  This will be made again!

Delicious bread! It was so easy to make too! The only changes I made were to omit the walnuts and I used powdered sugar in the glaze instead of granulated sugar.

This bread came out just as I expected it to be. I omitted the nuts (personal preference) but otherwise stayed true to the recipe as it is written. The bread baked up in about 60 minutes, and it looked picture perfect coming out of the oven. The lemon flavor is not too overpowering, and the lemon aroma is vaguely fragrant. Though the bread itself is dense, the taste is light and moist; the blueberries add a nice burst of flavor. I would make this again, especially as a side dish for an afternoon tea.

Took a loaf of this bread when visiting family in Las Vegas last month! It was a huge hit - and was served topped with Cool Whip. Made it when bringing dessert to our Bible Study and it was very popular! Thanks for a new favorite!

Love lemon breads and very fussy about the texture.  Combined with blueberries it makes a wonderful treat - have also used raspberries. I prefer to cream the butter and sugar very well because I find the texture is much lighter.  With the melted butter it tends to be a little heavy

Awesome! I melted the butter on the stove, I added a little extra to grease the pan with, no issues with it sticking at all. I also used only a half tsp of salt, and just mixed everything together by hand with no problem, then folded the zest and blueberries in. The zest i made with a vegetable peeler and 3 lemons, I then grinded it smaller in a little food processor. I went with the powder sugar glaze, be careful not to use to much powdered sugar, taste as you go.  cooked just shy of 60 minutes. I did not use nuts. My neighbors are already knocking down my door for more! delicious! I killed off the whole thing within 24 hours and guarded it as if it was "my precious". Yeah, it's that good!

I am so happy with this recipe. Awesome as written, but I decided to do the follow & still had fabulous results. Cut the sugar in half, used 2 parts whole wheat flour and 1 part all purpose, omitted zest, & used milk & powdered sugar to make the glaze for the top. Much healthier & turned out great! **** UPDATE: in an effort to make a healthier bread in my second batch I did the following: cut sugar in half, used 1 C whole wheat flour & 1/2 white, omitted nuts, omitted zest, cut the butter in half and added 1/2 C of applesauce for moisture and sweetness. Replaced half of blueberries with chopped strawberries & skipped the glaze all together. Results were outstanding!!!! With all the changes, I'd post a new recipe if it didn't take so long to get posted.

This is a TEN-STAR recipe, imho.  Other than (1)dredging the blueberries in flour to prevent sinking and (2) omitting the glaze, I followed this exactly as written. Perfect.  UPDATE ON 6/27/16.  I've now made these at least a dozen times, usually as written.  Most recently I'm enjoying them with half the lemon zest and juice and using coconut oil instead of butter....always wonderful.  I make them as breakfast muffins.

We loved this!.. I made mine in a bundt pan, it took about 35 to 40 minutes to cook.. I also made a couple changes and only used 2 tblsp of lemon juice and 1 tblsp of lemon zest..I also added 1/2 teasp of vanilla and 1/4 teasp of cinnamon and mixed in some chopped macadamia pieces in with the walnuts.. I only used half of the glaze, and when the cake was completly cooled I sprinkled it with powdered sugar.. In the morning my husband liked his piece warmed up some butter spread on it, I liked mine with a little strawberry cream cheese spread on.. Im know I will be making this over and over..

I made this for a day at the lake! Lasted less than 2 hours!  2nd time I made it I did it in muffins for camping! Worked very well! Bake about 30 minutes.  It actually cooked a little more consistently this way and fell apart a bit less. Definately a KEEPER!

This tastes sort of like a blueberry muffin, but has the buttery, lemon base rather than a plain white base.  I made this as written with the exception of using 1/2c powdered sugar for the glaze, rather than white sugar.  (BTW, the recipe ingredients list states to use 1/4c sugar for the glaze, while the directions say to use 1/2c; 1/4c is not enough.)  Thanks for the great recipe, Felicia!

This was fantastic!  It didn't need the glaze on top, it was perfect as is!  I dredged the frozen berries in 2 tablespoons of flour so they wouldn't sink as much in the batter and used half white whole weat flour.  This was so super moist and so yummy!  You will want to double this one and freeze so you have it on hand.

i read a post that the bread should sit in the in the pan, in the fridge or it might fall apart.  it did not happen.  i did find it helpful to read other posts and i m sure the tips help my loaf turn out great.  Another post warned about too many blueberries.  I used 1cup fresh, washed, dried, and coated in flour.  i folded in 1/2 and placed the rest on top.  Result was good distribution.  I also used powdered sugar for the glaze.  This is a great looking loaf of bread.  Thank you for the recipe

It was so easy to make.  It made my home smell amazing.  My boyfriend and I could not wait to eat it and when we did it was half eaten it 15 minutes.  We used the suggestion of the other comments and used powered sugar and lemon juice as the topping.  It was wonderful.  This recipe is a must!

This bread is delicious and consistently one of my top seller's at the farmer's market!! I omit the glaze (afraid it would turn to goo in the heat) & have made it both with & w/o nuts.  I also prefer buttermilk to regular milk.  This is wonderful--thanks for sharing & the very nice boost in sales!!

This was really really delicious! I put it into a glass 8x8 pan to make it more of a cake. YUM! I would recommend adding a bit more lemon zest and some vanilla extract. I did both and was happy with the way it turned out. I'll make it again!

This is the best lemon blueberry bread I have ever made!!! I added more blueberries to the mixture, decreased the sugar to 2/3 cup and I made it lower in fat by replacing the butter with applesauce.I also omitted the glaze and sprinkled it with brown sugar crystals.It turned out great!!! Definitely a keeper!!!

Made as directed and YUM!!!!  I made once without the glaze and it was ordinary and another time with the glaze and it's a must!  The sugar/lemon mixture gets a little crunchy and the flavor is awesome!  Pair a slice with a hot cup of tea and you will have yourself a little piece of heaven. :)

This bread is delicious and has such a light, refreshing lemon flavor.  I hate zesting lemons, so I used the juice of two lemons for the lemon juice and zest.  I used frozen wild blueberries, which are smaller than typical ones.  I added a little more than the recipe called for, probably 1 1/4 cup.  I left off the glaze because my husband doesn't like a strong lemon flavor, but I'm sure it would taste great on the bread!  Will be making this often.

This bread is delicious! Everyone at the potluck loved it! I also substituted powdered sugar in the glaze as other had done. Next time I will use cranberries as I think it will be just as good if not better! Thanks for the recipe!

i've made this a million times, and everyone always loves it. i've even substituted other fruits for the lemon and blueberries when i've been out of them, like peaches or nectarines, and keeping everything else the same, and it still comes out wonderful.

Wow this bread was amazing!  I loved the blueberries and lemon flavors together; and it was so moist.  I only made one change, I was in the middle of the recipe and opened the fridge and there was no milk!  The only thing I had was some homemade vanilla pineapple juice, so I subbed that.  Thanks for this awesome recipe, I think I will make muffins out of it next time.

I have no idea what I did wrong. I followed the recipe exact. Halfway through baking, I covered the loaves with tinfoil because they were browning very fast. After an hour, they still weren't done, so I set the timer another twenty minutes and waited. After the twenty minutes, the loaves were still not done but coming close to burning so I yanked them. I'd like to try this again, but I would hate to have the same result twice and be out ingredients. I hate wasting anything. If you want a foolproof recipe, try the Blueberry Lemon Loaf from this site.

This is a great recipe!!  I didn't expect it to have much flavor, but it was very tasty.  You could really taste the lemon, it was perfect.  I used both organic sugar and lemon juice, which I think really enhanced the flavors.  I also used 1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour.  I was too lazy to grate lemon peel so I left that out, and it was still good.  I skipped the glaze too.  It wasn't very tall, but maybe I used the wrong pan size.  (Don't know the exact measurments of mine).  I really enjoyed this!

This bread is excellent! Very quick to put together and it has a wonderful taste. I have made it without nuts, with nuts, without lemon zest, with lemon zest, confectioners sugar for the glaze, or regular sugar and no matter which way I make it everyone still loves it. Freezes well too! Thanks for sharing

Tart and lemony but a bit over powering for the blueberries which just added color to this recipe.  Next time I will cut the zest to 1 Tbsp and the lemon juice to 2 Tbsp and increase the blueberries to 1 1/2 cups.  Also didn't add walnuts just because that's not my preconceived notion of blueberry lemon bread.  Might give it a try, though...maybe hazelnuts...mmmmmm

A wonderful moist bread. Couldn't wait to let it cool before cutting off a piece.  I made a change to the glaze, though.  Used confection sugar instead of granulated.  Made an excellent glaze. It's a hit with both my husband and children.

Great flavor. I forgot to coat the blueberries in flour, and they sunk to the bottom and caused the bottom of the loaf to fall out when I removed it from the pan - so my only advice is to definitely coat the berries!

Despite coating my blueberries in flour they sunk to the bottom of the baking pan. I mean totally to the bottom and stuck despite spraying  the pan. The batter did seem a little thin to hold up the blueberries. On the plus side, it was cakelike, had a very nice texture and taste. Just need to figure out what i did wrong.

This recipe works fine as written. Trying to avoid butter where possible I used coconut oil. I also floured the fresh blueberries before adding and thus kept them from gathering in the bottom of the loaf.

I wanted only a tangy lemon bread, so I made it w/o the berries or nuts. I did put in the zest of 4 lemons and it was yum! PS i also upped Baking Powder to 1.5 tsp because some people had trouble with rising, and it did seem like a real small amount of leavening otherwise. Also, the correct way to do the glaze is - pull bread out of the oven, poke light holes in it with a sharp fork while its warm, and pour warm glaze (2 T juice & 2 T sugar) while its in the tin. Then take it out of the tin only when cool. I always line my tin with paper so I'm not sure if this makes it difficult to pull out eventually.

This is a really good recipe with great flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly but the only minor thing I would change next time would be to use about 1/2tsp of salt - for some reason a whole tsp seemed like a little too much for me.  I made a little extra glaze and didn't thin it down too much so it actually was like an icing on top - delicious!!

This bread is definitely more like a pound cake than a standard quick loaf bread. It's dense and buttery and delicious for breakfast with a cup of coffee! I doubled the recipe and baked it for about 45 minutes in a 9"x13" pan. I reduced the sugar to about 1.5 cups and used a whole bag of frozen blueberries (almost 3 cups).

This wasn't my favorite recipe, only because I like a sweeter bread. My family absolutely loved it! I used fresh picked bluberries lightly coated in flour. They still sank to the bottom; no big deal unless you're looking for picture perfect bread. On one batch, I put a couple pats of butter on top once it was out of the oven instead of the lemon glaze, and it made a delicious buttery "crust." I will make this again.

I didn't change a thing with this recipe and it has worked perfectly twice.  I make it ahead when I know I'll be having company, and serve it to them for breakfast in the morning.  My guests feel like they're staying at a bed and breakfast.  Scrumptious!

Yum!  I've been looking for the "perfect" lemon bread recipe and I think I finally found it!  I omitted the nuts and was very liberal with freshly squeezed lemon juice for a bit more zing.  It's very simple to make and is so delicious.  This will be my new standard contribution to family breakfasts.

I baked a double batch of this bread for a brunch my mother was having and everybody raved about it, a huge success! It was delicious. I did have to lower my oven temperature to 300 degrees after the loaves had been baking for an hour, and had to bake them for another twenty minutes. The glaze required much more sugar, but these were easy things to remedy. An all around great recipe :)

I used a half cup of butter (softened) and mixed the blueberries with some flour (they didn't sink to the bottom).  Also, I baked this in a fancy bundt cake pan as it was for my Mom's birthday.  Everyone really enjoyed this cake, it was quite lemon-y!  Only thing I would have done differently is refrigerate it, as we had it on a hot day and it would have been more refreshing chilled.  For the glaze, I followed a suggestion I saw somewhere and microwaved the lemon juice and sugar until it was dissolved (maybe 35 seconds total).  Thanks for the recipe that will now be my go-to!

Suggestion:  If the picture is the bread you made it appears that the fruit sank to the bottom of the pan.  A few years ago I learned a trick to keep fruit/nuts/etc., suspended in this type of bread.
Dust them with flour before incorporating into batter.  It does work, so give it a try next time.

This was a quick and delicious recipe.  The only changes I made were to leave out the nuts (don't like), used confectioner's sugar instead of white sugar and added a little bit of the lemon zest to the glaze.  At the proportions given, I found the glaze to be really thin, so I added in a little more sugar to try and thicken it a bit.  Spread over the top of the bread and by morning it was hard/not sticky.
I had no problem with this being too soft/not coming out of the pan.  Everything held together perfectly and it has been a hit.  Thanks for an excellent recipe!

I just love this bread, thank you ChezSpice. It's deliciously lemony and very light, but I added only half a cup of sugar. In order to stop the blueberries and walnuts sinking to the bottom, toss them lightly in flour before adding to the mixture.

Yummers! I used fresh blueberries from my neighbors blueberry trees. I also took advice from reviewers and mixed them with flour. The berries did not sink to the bottom! My girls loved this bread. Thanx!

This is wonderful !  Soft crumb, light and full of flavor.  I used softened butter and creamed with sugar and lemon.  Following the rest of the directions using fresh lemon and zest from only 1 very large lemon.  I also used 2 T. lemon, some zest and powder sugar for a glaze and mixed the 1 1/4 c blueberries in a couple of Tbls of flour before mixing them in.  Baked abt 70 min.  Perfect.  I will make this again and again.  It's a keeper!

LOVE this.  Made for first time today.  I probably used more lemon zest than I should, but it was so nice!  Only thing I changed was the addition of a little (1/4 t. vanilla) to both bread & glaze.  Delish!

Really good.  I doubled the recipe so that I could make this in a bundt pan (I know, silly reason, but something about this recipe just screamed "I need to be a pretty cake!").  I normally try to make things more healthy, but I decided to splurge and pretty much go by the book on this one - the only exception being that I cut the eggs to 3 (doubled recipe).  I also only had 3 fresh lemons so I used all the zest from those but it wasn't nearly what was called for - next time I'll be sure to have enough lemons on hand.  I also poured the glaze on the hot cake before turning it out to cool, hoping it would soak in kind of like a pound cake, but that didn't work out quite as well as hoped, so next time I will definitely cool the cake first and drizzle the glaze on top.  I love lemon and I love blueberries so this was a really nice "bread," (although I have to agree with others it was more like cake.  My 2 year old saw it and said "coffee cake!" which he's only had like twice, so even the peanut crew agrees - more like cake.) :)  Will make again!

Enjoyed the lemon/blueberry.  My blueberries sank even though I coated them with flour as suggested.  Next time I'll try frozen ones.

great bread! sort of cake-like, which totally works for me. i omitted the lemon zest and used the juice of 1 1/2 fresh lemons. i also followed the suggestion of other reviewers and used confectioners sugar for the glaze and added it with 5mins remaining in the oven. the bread was gone within 2hrs... definitely one for the recipe box!

One of the best lemon recipes I've ever made. I used fresh lemons and blueberries. I did poke holes in the top before applying the glaze because it just wanted to roll right off. It had a nice crispy crust and an awesome lemon flavor. I wouldn't skimp on the lemon at all. It took about 10 mniutes longer in the oven but came out moist and delicious. It is a cross between bread and cake and we served it more like a dessert with a dollop of whipped cream. Simply divine!!

Delicious! Only changes are that I greased and floured my pan, mixed in the lemon zest into the butter/sugar mixture and dredged the blueberries in flour before folding into the mixture.  After cooling for about 5 minutes, I ran a rubber spatula between the pan and the cake and turned onto a cooling rack. There was no problem with sticking.  Definitely a cakey texture - had to eat it with a fork, mind you I ate it while it was still hot.  I think the recipe would be great without the glaze as well and I think I will try this recipe with raspberries next time.

Followed the recipe exactly, except left out the lemon zest and the walnuts, and cooked for only about 55 minutes. Totally delicious!!! It was gone by the next day, and so good that I had to make another loaf a couple days later. That time I added walnuts, which was a nice addition, but I liked it better without them. Regardless, will definitely be making this again and again and again!!!

Delicious!  The only thing I did different was I made two smaller loaves instead of one big one (2 - 3" x 7" pans, baked for 35 minutes - perfect).  I also used powdered sugar for the glaze and didn't measure - just kept adding until I got the consistency that I wanted.  I drizzled this over one of the loaves, because I was going to freeze the other . . . but I might just have to glaze the 2nd loaf, because the first one is almost GONE already!  I will be making this one again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved it!! Left out the walnuts and lemon zest, dredged the blueberries in flour (they didn't sink), made 3 mini-loaves baked at 350 for 45 minutes. Also used 1/2 c. powdered sugar for the glaze. Very yummy, but you have to be a fan of lemon tartness to enjoy this.

This bread is delicious!  I omitted the walnuts and didn't bother with the glaze.  My only complaint was that the blueberries mostly sank to the bottom, so when I tried to take the bread out of the pan, the bottom was mushy and some of it stuck.  But the flavor of this bread (which is more like cake) is dead-on. Will make again, and will toss the blueberries in flour before folding into the batter.

This is definitely more of a cake than a bread, especially with the glaze.  I took a loaf to my office and it was gone in under two hours.  I could definitely taste the butter, which I couldn't decide if I liked, but it brought back childhood memories of the buttered blueberry muffins my mother used to make.  Also, I could only find canned blueberries, and they worked just fine (just make sure to drain the juice and rinse the blueberries).

I made these into muffins, and substituted a few things as well.  I used applesauce instead of butter, egg substitute, whole wheat pastry flour instead of regular flour, and omitted the walnuts.  It took about 3 rough-skinned, medium-sized lemons to get the zest (using the fine side of a box grater sped things up nicely, too), and made more than enough juice for the batter and glaze.  Also, I used frozen blueberries and rinsed and drained them to cut down on the liquid as much as possible.  This recipe made exactly 1 dozen muffins, filled to the top of the muffin cups (the batter doesn't rise much, if at all).  I put them in the oven for 30 minutes, but they came out a tad dry, so next time I'll try 15 or 20 to start, then check them at intervals.  Also, since they were a bit hard on the top from my overbaking (I didn't even wait the 10 minutes for them to cool), I had some trouble getting the glaze to sink in, even after poking holes with a fork.  Oh well, next time I'll get it right!  Also, as a tip, the muffin wrappers were very difficult to take off right away (I had to taste one immediately, of course!), but the next morning they peeled off with ease.  This recipe had a nice contrast between the tart lemon and sweet blueberry, and I'm not sure if it's because I used whole wheat flour, or because they were small muffins instead of a large loaf, but the blueberries didn't sink at all.  Just FYI, the texture is fairly dense, but that could be due to the whole wheat flour or

I doubled the recipe and adjusted the lemon zest to the zest of one small lemon (it was probably about 2 tsp.).  There was plenty of lemon flavor for our taste.  I also made a glaze with powdered sugar, lemon juice and lemon zest, instead of the glaze in the recipe.  I used hazelnuts in the bread and  sprinkled powder fine hazelnuts on top of the glaze while it was still hot.  Thanks for a good recipe!

This is an easy and delicious bread.  Yields a moist bread with a delicate lemon hint.  I opted to skip the glaze and instead dusted with sugar prior to baking.  I realize the glaze would have increased the lemon flavor but I didn't want it any sweeter for my preferences.  I highly recommend this bread.

Outstanding! If you love lemon and blueberries, this is a great recipe to kill two birds with one stone. It's simple, moist and delicious. 5 stars all the way! METHOD: the first time, I used 4 small loaf pans… either do in 3 small or 1 regular loaf pan as they were too "short". I stayed (mostly) true to the recipe. I did brown the butter for a "nutty" flavor (I do this a lot when baking cookies). I baked the loaves for 45 min and they could have been a tiny bit over done. I'd just calibrated my oven, so it should have been fairly accurate.  Everyone's oven varies, so definitely do the toothpick test early on. I mixed 1/2 the blueberries in the mix then added half the batter to pans...added more blueberries...more batter and topped with the rest of the berries. I did dredge the blueberries in flour, as suggested, but i don't think it was necessary. Mine did not sink. I think the problem some people may have with sinking berries is from over-beating the mixture. Like cornbread, just beat enough to incorporate. I used both fresh and frozen berries because the fresh berries weren't very sweet. I used zest from 1 sm and 1 lg lemon, and had plenty of lemon juice left over. The first time I made this, I poured the syrup on top when I took them out of the oven and the next time, I pulled them out about 10 minutes early, poured the syrup on, then put the loaves back in the oven to finish. I preferred the former as the sugar came close to burning/hardening on edges the 2nd way. YUM!

This is the best!
I just love the light zest of the lemon with the blueberry.
I did add a touch of vanilla to the recipe and omitted the walnuts but other than that I followed it to a T.

I tried the icing once and found it too sweet taking away from the bread so I don't use it anymore.

I followed this recipe with exact measurements and it turned out perfectly.  One thing that I have learned through my cooking experience with blueberries is to layer them with the batter in the pan to prevent them from dropping to the bottom of the bread as it cooks.  Sometimes coating them with flour doesn't even work for me.  I also line my pans with parchment paper to make it easier for me to get the sweet breads out of the pans.   VERY GOOD balance of lemon (always use fresh if you can) and blueberries.  This one is for the lemon-lovers among us!

I liked this, though I should say I did not do the glaze. I didn't want it to be too sweet. Next time I may try it without the walnuts and with half white and half brown sugar..

Delicious!!!  I followed the directions for the bread exactly as written, but, as other reviewers suggested, subbed powdered sugar for the regular sugar in the icing.  Easy to make and sooooo very good!!  It tasted more like a delicious cake than a breakfast bread; we happily ate it for dessert one night and breakfast the next morning :-). I will definitely make this again and again!  I am trying not to eat the whole loaf right now!  I didn't have any problem getting the bread out of the loaf pan; I sprayed the glass pan with cooking spray, and let it sit for about an hour after I pulled it from the oven., ran a butter knife around the edges, and it came out beautifully.  So moist and sweet!

really nice delicate flavor! yum! I used vegetable oil instead of butter, cut back on a little bit of the sugar and used soy milk instead of milk to keep it non-dairy. Used the zest from one lemon, which was about 1 Tblsp. Skipped the nuts. Thanks!

I served this to guests and they all loved it!  I followed the recipe with the exception of adding an additional 1/2 C of berries.  Frozen blueberries worked very well and didn't turn the whole loaf blue.  I also added course raw sugar to the top of the loaf just before baking.   Great, easy recipe.

Made this today and it is delicious!  I left out the walnuts, used confectioner's sugar for the glaze, and put the glaze on for the last 10 minutes of baking.  Was excellent and I've already shared the recipe with a couple of friends!

This was absolutely delicious.  My boyfriend and I couldn't stop eating it.  I made the glaze but kept it on  the side in a bowl and we simply drizzled individual slices with the glaze.  Definitely a keeper!

I made this recipe in 2 smaller loaf pans; made 1 with glaze (froze it for 1 week) and 1 without glaze.  The loaf with the glaze was the best; moist and sweet with a little tart although the loaf without glaze was moist, but not as sweet.  Personal preference....

There was nothing specifically WRONG with this recipe.  However since reviews are based on opinion, it is my opinion that this is just ok.  I'd much rather have banana or zucchini bread personally.  It was good-just not my favorite thing.  And usually I'm a lover of ALL things bread.

This was awesome.  Everyone loved it.  I don't like nuts in breads too much so I did not add them.  I added poppy seeds instead and it came out delicious.  I also added more lemon juice as I wanted a stronger lemon taste and added more than 1 cup of blueberries.  Thanks for posting!  :)

Mmmmm, good!  Didn't change a thing except I left out the nuts because I don't really care for them.  The glaze was really runny, and a lot of it ran off the cake, so I poured it over again.  I thought the cake would be too wet, but once it cooled off, it was fine.  Will definitely make this again!  Love the lemon and blueberry combination, thanks for sharing!

The recipe is incredibly decadent. It would be great for breakfest during the spring. The flavor of the blueberries with the sweetness of the sugar and the tartness of the lemon juice combined with the texture of the walnuts make for an extremely satisfying experience. I did use powdered sugar for the glaze and I did not measure. I simply added powdered sugar until I had the consistency I wanted. I wanted a thicker almost icing type glaze.

I lost my old blueberry bread recipe and am trying to find a new one. This one was good but I am going to look for another recipe. I didn't use walnuts because of allergies, the bread was to crumbly and broke in half when I took it out of the pan.

Overall a good recipe!  I made this twice once following the recipe as stated and I found the lemon favor to be too overpowering.  The second time I made it I cut the zest down to one tablespoon and omitted the lemon glaze altogether.  The bread was fine without it.  The bread is better the second day.

Absolutely wonderful. Sweet, dense, cake-like. I omit the walnuts and the glaze (which is too confectioner's-sugary for me), but otherwise don't change a thing. A favorite sweet bread!

Love this "bread" even though it's more like a coffee cake. It turned out beautiful but next time I will reduce the amount of sugar, I love sweets but it was a little too sweet for me. I also added a couple more tbsp of lemon juice to make sure it had the lemony taste I was looking for. Yummm...a keeper!

This was fine, but not good enough that I'd make again. After reading all the reviews, I was expecting the bread to taste like a cake. It was sweet, but not nearly sweet enough that I'd consider it a cake. It was more of a bread, in my opinion, just like the title states. I followed the recipe exactly, but I was a tad short on zest. I took the bread to a potluck and came home with over half of it. Some of it is going to end up being thrown away and I hate that.

We did not like this much and ended up throwing over half of it away. I did not add the glaze, so maybe that would have improved it slightly.

This is the best! I didn't have any lemons so I used Minute Maids lemon juice in it(comes in a box in the freezer section next to the frozen concentrates). I happened to have a grapefruit on hand and used the zest off of it. (citrus is citrus) It turned out wonderful!! My husband and son were very disappointed that it didn't make two loaves. Sooo.. I am currently making another loaf! (Only this time I bought some lemons!)

Pretty good! When it came right out of the oven it was okay, but then we left it out that night and in the morning it wasn't very good. I put it in the fridge and it was delicious! Definitely the best cold and only 10 minutes to prepare! We have 13 lbs of blueberries so we added more and it was very yummy!

Great bread!  The lemon flavor was a little stronger the following days after being in the fridge. I might add a little lemon flavoring next time to see if that helps with the flavor day of cooking because I'm too impatient to wait to eat it the next day. Also, I made one batch with walnuts and one without. I prefer it without the walnuts. Parchment paper helps lift the bread out of the pan too.

I had a tons of meyer lemons to use up so I searched up bunch of lemon recipes, this is one I decided to make.  It turned out really nice, moist, and tasty.  Meyer lemons are milder and sweeter than normal lemons so I went ahead and used the juice from one lemon instead of just 3 Tbsp.  I also used powdered sugar for a little more substantial glaze.  Very nice!

excellent recipe.  I found it's easier to mix the blueberries with the flour before adding to the wet ingredients so they don't sink.  Applesauce makes a good alternative to butter.  I also added a little vanilla (habit).

This was well worth squatting in the 90+ degree heat with a headache while getting my legs all scratched up to pick wild blueberries!!  I almost didn't put the walnuts in, but I'm glad I did!  It was cake-like and we loved it!

Very moist and delicious even without the glaze which I accidentally forgot to put on.  Just make sure you let them cool completely before trying to take them out of the pan- if you are impatient (like me) you may end up with it falling apart a little.  Took this to school for teacher appreciation and it dissappeared quicky and I was given a round of applause when i went back to pick up the empty dish!

This makes a very tasty quick bread.  I didn't have walnuts, so I doubled the blueberries (dredged in flour, first, so they didn't sink to the bottom of the loaf), and it came out great.  Others have metioned that it was too lemony, but I think the balance of flavors was fine.  Mine took nearly the entire cooking time, but that may have been because of the extra fruit.  Also, I only had a 9"x3" loaf pan, but it was no problem.

Made this tonight with blueberries I had picked this season and frozen.  It was absolutely delicious and did not last the night at our house.  I did make a few changes. Based on the comments that it sticks to the pan, I sprayed the pan with Pam w/flour.  It slid right out.  I increased the blueberries to 1 1/2 cups and cut the lemon zest in half.  I made the glaze out of confectioners sugar as others had suggested, but next time I think I will try it with regular sugar for a crunchy topping. Will definately make again!

Loved it! Used two cups of blueberries plus lots of cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg. It was so moist - perfect! I think next time I'll put more lemon in it to make it a little more tangy. I'll be making this again and again! Thanks!

Made this bread two weeks ago and decided to freeze it. Had it this morning for my mom's group and it was a huge hit! It tasted very lemony. I followed the recipe exactly as it was except I doubled the amount of blueberries. This one is a definite keeper!

This bread is delicious!  It was easy to make, but, hard to quit eating.  Now I'll really be looking forward to blueberry season so I can make this often.  Thanks for sharing!!

Really disappointed at how the bread turned out, visually.  Tasted good, but when I went to put the bread on a cooling rack, it completely fell apart...stuck to the bottom of my pan.  Wonder if lightly flouring the pan after greasing it would have helped.  Probably going to turn this into a crumble to eat with ice cream.

wow!!!  This recipe made my day and also made my coworkers happy.  I followed the directions precisely and it came out fantastic.   Unlike others who have reviewed, it was not gloppy, nor did I have to wait long to get it out of the pan.   It took less than an hour (55 minutes) in a convection oven, and once it cooled off it popped out of the baking pan.  Moist, delicious.  It did not need the frosting.  A summer delight.  I will make another one tonight because it disappeared in minutes.

This recipe is for sure a very great one, and I highly suggest this dessert bread to someone who wants to eat a healthy dessert that is healthy... still being able to savor it and enjoy it in your mouth. I had absolutely no problem baking this delicious sweet treat, and it is very yummy!

Love this recipe! First time making it and it was a hit at a potluck. Just the right amount of sweetness and zesty lemon. In my oven, baking time was 65 min and it came out very moist.  I used thawed blueberries from last season and tasted great. Really easy to make.

This didn't turn out great for me. 60 minutes ended up being way too long and my lemon bread came out a little over done. The consistency was not like a bread either but more cake like. It was also super dense and not that tasty. 10 minutes cooling time was not enough and the bread fell apart trying to take it out. I would cool it overnight before attempting to take it out or make muffins instead.

This has been a big hit. I made it as written, minus any nuts.  The second time I made it I used a frozen mixed fruit combination that was even better. A good simple recipe.  Probably a good one for those who fear baking. :)

My family really liked this bread. I generally do not make changes when making a recipe the first time, but having made many fruit breads I knew I would want more fruit. We added 1 1/2 cups of fresh blueberries coated in flour. They did not sink to the bottom! We also added 1/2 cup of berries to the top prior to baking. Although I usually put nuts in everything, we omitted them here and did not miss them. We wanted this to be more like a blueberry muffin bread, so we used a streusel topping in place of the glaze. I think that was my kids favorite part! I also greased my pan, then inserted parchment paper, greased that, & poured the batter on top of the paper. Pulled out of the pan easy peasy & peeled off like a muffin. We will definitely make this again, but will probably add another tablespoon of lemon to bring out that flavor a bit more.

This bread is lovely!  I used confectioners sugar for the glaze and included the zest from the lemon in the glaze for an extra lemony kick.  I made 5 mini loafs and they cooked in 30 minutes.  I will make this again for sure!

Delicious!! I did make a few changes to make it a little healthier: reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup + 1/4 cup of honey, replaced the flour with all wheat baking flour. Also I didn't have enough milk so I added a little more lemon juice and reduce the amount of zest. I made 7 muffins and they turned out perfect!

I made a "healthy" version of these muffins by using freshly ground whole wheat flour and substituting 3/4 cup of honey for the sugar.  I've made a lot of muffins this way, and some recipes come out good while others don't.  This recipe came out great. I made muffins instead of bread and they had a lovely, chewy top and soft inside. The lemon flavor is just right.

I HATE ZESTING LEMONS!  So I omitted that and just added more lemon juice.  This was fabulous!  I was worried that it wouldn't turn out because my oven turned off halfway through baking it and so I had to "re-bake" it.  It still came out moist and delicious.  I put vanilla Greek yogurt instead of the milk and used icing sugar for the glaze. I also mixed a tablespoon of flour with the blueberries so that they  wouldn't sink and they didn't.  I also didn't have any nuts but I don't think it was missed.  I let the loaf cool completely in the pan and put the glaze directly over it - it's still in the pan now.  Can't wait to have a piece tomorrow morning with a nice cup of Chai!

This was a very moist, dense bread. Delicious. I didn't use nuts and it turned out great. The glaze was a good finishing touch.

I must have done something wrong because it tastes like an omelet. Not sweet an not good! You can even smell egg as its cooking, Not lemony. I would suggest one egg NOT two, and add more sugar and lemon zest.

This bread is amazing! My family love blueberries so I doubled the blueberries and also added a little bet of orange zest, and lime juice for the glaze, along with the lemon juice and sugar. It was the perfect balance, the sweetness of the bread balanced by the saber of that particular glaze tasted great!

Easy & Delicious, thank you! I was craving lemon-strawberry bread, so I used those instead of blueberries; no nuts & substituted lemon zest for 4T more lemon juice (bottle) as I had no lemons. I like the glaze a lot, used the regular white sugar the recipe calls for & nuked it for a minute to combine, so it wasn't grainy. The batter was DELICIOUS too:)

My guy loved the taste but I think I'll have to cook it longer than 60 minuted next time;  seemed under cooked as opposed to moist.

This bread is one my absolute favorites. I do add the nuts (I think everything should have nuts in it), and follow the recipe exactly as it's listed.  The only thing I did this time a little different is sprinkled lemon sprinkles on the top for a little extra added umph, but it's certainly not a deal breaker without it.  My kids enjoy it which is a huge plus.  I just realized that I make the glaze with powdered sugar and lemon juice rather than regular white sugar.  Divine!!!

Great texture, very pretty, and when I first tried it last night right after I made it I thought wow this is very tart. Almost bitter. But after it sat overnight the flavors mellowed out.  I think next time I'll use about a little less zest and juice, and use powdered sugar with the glaze. I'm eating this loaf with cream cheese though and it's delicious that way.

This bread is so, so moist and delicious! It tastes even better if you let it rest overnight so all the flavors mesh together. Makes a great coffee cake!

I think this is fantastic- except that it does an instant disappearing act! Fresh lemons can be washed and frozen. When ready to use they are easier to grate, then let them warm up to squeeze the juice.

Great bread recipe!  I used 4 T. of lemon juice and about 3 T. of lemon zest because I LOVE lemon and I skipped the blueberries and walnuts but I did add 1 t. of ground lavender (done with a mortar and pestle) but this texture of this bread was fantastic!  I made a glaze of lemon juice and powdered sugar and brushed that on right out of the oven and again after ten minutes.  I garnished with more lemon zest and dried lavender.  I think this basic bread could be flavored to become any number of breads i.e. orange/cranberry

This turned out to be one of my favorite breads I've ever made! It's super simple and doesn't require a ton of ingredients. I had to use oranges instead of lemons because that's the only citrus I had on hand. I also made this using brown rice flour instead of all purpose (because it's gluten free), I used coconut oil instead of butter (adds more flavor and is much healthier), and had to use hemp milk (you could use any other non-dairy milk as well). It still turned out to be amazing, thank you again!

This lemon blueberry bread (more like a coffee cake) was so delicious that I ended up making another loaf the next day because it was almost gone. My husband really enjoyed taking this to work for breakfast in the morning. The lemon glaze on top was perfect! Thanks for the recipe!

I was really hoping this would be a great bread after reading all the rave reviews.  This did not turn out like a bread for me.  More like an overmoist, almost soggy, cake. Not what I am looking for in a bread.  I also found it a little too tart, and I love lemon.

I followed this recipe exactly - other than leaving out the walnuts and lemon zest and making the glaze with powdered sugar instead of white.  It came out very tasty and moist.  I would consider this more of a cake than a bread.  I think if I was to make this again, I would add an extra 1/2 cup of blueberries.

Made this today with some of our abundant blueberries. I doubled the recipe and added a palmful of cake spice to the batter because my husband loves cinnamon. I also used dehydrated lemon peel (Penzeys) in place of juice and zest. I got 12 mini loaf cakes from the batch that took 33 minutes to bake. Will def make again!  Very good!

Pretty easy and tasty.  I think I added a little too much blueberries, I would cut that back a little.  Also cut the sugar a bit but think if I left it as is it would have been ok.

Just finished my first piece and ZOMG, trying so hard not to go back for a second piece. Very, very good. Mine isn't "bread" at all, and is more cake-like; the batter was thin so I used a cake pan. My only complaint is that I don't think the recipe makes enough!

Really, really good! Moist, lemony, and the blueberries were incredible! Love this bread...it's a keeper! The only think I will change is the glaze on the top. I prefer a powdered sugar glaze.

Holy WOW! This is delicious!  I am not a baker, but have made 3 loaves of this in the past month.  The only change I made was using OLIVE OIL (yes, I know...sounds odd) instead of butter and using a bit more zest. 

Also, the last loaf I baked, I was out of walnuts, so I added fresh chopped banana.  Some fresh raspberries in the summer would be delicious too.

I love this recipe.  I've made it two years in a row for a Christmas gift to several neighbors, using mini loaf pans.  At a time of year when everything is so sweet or chocolaty the lemon zing is a refreshing change.
One thing I do different, is to bring the sugar/lemon glaze to a boil, and cool a bit before applying.  You don't get the grit of the sugar, but more of a smooth glassy glaze.  Exceptional flavor!

I loved the lemon flavor in combination with the blueberries and didn't find the lemon overpowering at all.  It came out of the pan just fine and I was able to sample a slice before refrigerating it.  I used wild blueberries, 1 cup only as the recipe suggested.  This is definitely a keeper.  Thanks

This was great. Definitely does not have the bread  texture of say banana bread, but the lemon and blueberry combo was wonderful, I love the zest and zing the lemon provides and it's a very easy recipe. Yum!

I used two whole lemons and the zest, also added about 1/3 of a brick of cream cheese, because who doesn't love cream cheese?  I omitted the glaze and walnuts.  The bread turned out great.  Light and lemony!

Delicious! I added a lemon juice/powdered sugar icing and skipped the lemon juice/sugar glaze. Honestly, even though it was perfect, you could even skip the glaze or icing, it's sweet enough on its own.

I prepared this recipe exactly as written.  While I liked it enough to try it again, my family agrees with me that the lemon flavor was a little too over-the-top for our liking.  I agree with another reviewer that the bread is DEFINITELY better the next day.  The lemon flavor calmed down quite a bit, but not enough for me.  It's all a matter of personal taste.Next time, I'll try decreasing the lemon zest to a tsp. and leaving the rest of the recipe as written.

I made this recipe exactly as directed and it was delicious! I highly recommend making this according to the directions the first time- it is just right as written. I think using fresh lemon juice makes a big difference, especially with the glaze. Thanks for sharing this recipe- it is a new favorite to have with tea. Yum!

Great flavor, great the 2nd day, easy to make!  I didn't have lemon zest so I left that out.  I used bottled lemon juice, I'm sure fresh is better, but I still thought this was fine.  When I turned the loaf out of the pan the bottom stuck to the pan; I scooped the rest out and laid it on top, not very pretty but still tasted fine!  I poured the glaze over that mess :)  The blueberries sunk to the bottom of the pan.  Great the second day warmed in the toaster over.  I will make this again to see if I can fix my ooppsss!  If I can master this recipe it will be my new go to bread.   I really loved this recipe!

Delicious bread! Super quick and easy to make. Tasted good even though I left the lemon zest out. On the advice of some of the other reviewers, I used powdered(confectioner's) sugar (1/4 cup) for the glaze and added 1/2 the glaze when 10 minutes of baking-time were left. I served this amazing, moist bread/cake with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream.

Took this to a church activity where there were 7 other kinds of quick breads.  This was BY FAR everyone's favorite.  I like to sprinkle sugar on my pan after I spray it with cooking spray, it gives the bread a nice crunchy, sweet exterior.

Delicious, and fun to make!  I'm no kitchen pro, but even a newbie like me couldn't screw this up.  Made it for a brunch I hosted, and it was by far the favorite dish on the table.

I started to make this, THEN discovered I had no lemons or juice, blueberries, butter...so I used lowfat spread, strawberries, lemon extract, and substituted some of the juice of the strawberries for some of the milk.  AND I didn't glaze it.  We all loved it, anyway!  :o)  Great recipe--even stood up to my abuse!  I'm anxious to try it as written now.

Wonderful flavor combination! I made it in a 13 x 9" dish, omitted the walnuts, and poured the blueberries over the top instead of mixing them in before baking. It turned out really nice.
Update: used this recipe for my daughter's birthday cake. Doubled recipe and baked in 2 round cake pans with blueberries and strawberries on top. Split layers after freezing and partially thawing and topped with frosting made from 1 package lemon pudding mix with 1 C milk and added about 3 1/2 C whipped cream (2 C before whipping). I got lots of compliments!!

I used confectionary sugar for glaze and not white sugar. I will use the recipe again. I particularly liked the addition of the glaze to enhance the flavor and appearance of the bread. I thought it was a nice combination of lemon and blueberry flavors.

This bread is fantastic! Terrific flavor, easy to make, and my friends and family loved it. I skipped the lemon zest and nuts and instead added an extra 1/4 cup of blueberries. This was just personal preference. This recipie is a definite keeper!

I omitted the nuts and took the other reviewers advice and floured the blueberries, and made the glaze with confectionery sugar and the cake came out just perfect.  Very delicious and easy to make.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.  It is a "keeper" and I will be making it again and again.

very moist and a nice lemon flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly (omitting the nuts because we don't care much for them).  It was more like a moist cake than a bread which was actually what I was hoping for.  Will make again soon!

Good flavor. I did not find the lemon to be too overpowering at all. I would have used freshberries bc my frozen berries were covered in juice ice and colored the batter blue. I did not coat them in flour and they did sink. WATCH THE TIME! my loaf cooked to perfection in about 45 minutes.

So here's what NOT to do :)  I used Splenda instead of sugar and whole wheat flour and it was soo nasty.  I don't think Splenda and lemon go together very well or something, when I put the lemon juice in the Splenda it looked like something weird was going on.  Hopefully posting this will help someone else from making my mistakes!

I had some fresh blueberries I wanted to use and I've been on a bread kick lately so I thought I would try this recipe.I made it last night and just tried a piece this morning with my coffee.I'm very disappointed in this bread.I thought the lemon was way too overpowering for the blueberries...and I only used half the amount of zest it called for.I kept thinking it needed to be sweeter because all I could really taste was the tart lemon.Maybe I just had a really strong lemon but it was barely sweet at all. To be fair I didn't make the glaze so maybe that would have helped make it sweeter.At least now I know I don't like blueberries and lemon together in bread.

THIS IS MY FAVORITE BREAD TO MAKE. IT NEVER FAILS AND TASTES SPECTACULAR EVERY TIME! My mom especially loves it and we usually eat the whole loaf right out of the oven! I use frozen blueberries and no nuts and it is just the best. Moist, flavorful, and delicious!

Yummy... everybody loved it. I made a double recipe and three of us ate a whole loaf in one night.. hehe.. I subsituted a lemon icing for the lemon sugar... I used 4 tbsp's of lemon juice... the zest of one lemon and about 2.5 cups of icing sugar.. once the loaves cooled.. i poured the icing over top and it ended up being an amazing topping for this delicious dense loaf... Great recipe! :)

Big hit at our family reunion.  I used the zest of one lemon.  Also I sifted the dry ingrediants before mixing in and used a couple of extra tablespoons of flour to lightly coat berries before adding.  Like others, I used powdered sugar for the glaze.  Use fresh lemon juice.

Loved the sweet tart taste and it made the fresh blueberries taste great.  I used fresh lemon, too.  I would leave out the nuts, we thought it took away from the recipe.  I'm planning a 3 family cottage weekend next week and this is going to be on the menu.  I actually wanted to make this recipe for years. It was printed and filed since 2005 and I'm glad I didn't see the reviews, it was great as is.

I was really excited to try this recipe, but was dissapointed.  I didn't have any lemons, so I didn't add the zest.  I was hoping it would be more like a banana bread, but it tasted like cake.  I will keep searching for a more "bread-like" recipe.  It tasted good...just not what I was looking for.

This went over very well. I omitted the nuts as they are not liked here. I also covered the blueberries in a light dusting of flour before folding into batter to prevent them from falling to the bottom. I also added a lemon glaze (lemon juice & white sugar) over the top. Overall very good!

For some reason the walnuts did nothing for the flavour of this otherwise nice little bread. Perhaps it is just my families taste. This bread smelled heavenly while baking. To prevent the berries from sinking do the dusting in flour step but I took another reviewers suggestion to be sure to beat the eggs thouroughly when adding them. I had no problem as they dispersed evenly. I will try again without the nuts.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I made it  last night to when we had some unexpected company.  It was a huge hit.  I followed it exactly as written (except nuts - allergy), and could not have had a better result.  The only thing better then this moist, delicous bread is the aroma it filled the house with.  A definate keeper.

This was the best! Loved the lemon with the blueberry! I made this as written with the exception of changing the flour to whole wheat. I also halved the sugar (both bread and glaze) and I couldn't imagine it any better.

I made this for a brunch and it was spectacular.  I used fresh blueberries and lemons and followed the recipe exactly.    I did not find the lemon overpowering and the glaze added a nice texture to the bread.  This is definitely a "keeper" and I'll be making another loaf this weekend while the blueberries are in season.

This bread is very tasty, does have more of a pound cake texture, but that's not a bad thing.  I wouldn't use the glaze next time, it is nice and tart and sweet without and the glaze made it a little too moist and easy to fall apart.  Otherwise, we liked it very much.

This is SOOOO GOOD!  A quick and easy sweet bread.  It reminds me of the pound cakes my grandmother used to make for her garden club.  Kid friendly too!  I made it without the nuts.

This bread was very good. I used small wild blueberries so I had no problem with them sinking at all. Next time I'll wait longer before drizzling the glaze over top since it ended up melting down the sides of the bread into a puddle. Great flavor , though, I thought the amount of lemon was perfect. I did leave out the lemon zest and the nuts.

Fantastic!  I used about 2 cups of frozen blueberries and didn't have any nuts to add.  The glaze is wonderful, adds a nice lemony zippy contrast to the blueberries.

I made this loaf for my grandma's memorial tea and everyone enjoyed it.  Next time I'll omit the glaze and may tone down the lemon juice & zest.  I love lemons (as did my grandma) however it may be a little too "zingy" for some and I found it overpowered the blueberries.

I adapted this recipe to be gluten-free by substituting cup for cup the flour with kinnniquik- bread and muffin mix and leaving out the baking soda and salt.  The blueberries sank to the bottom but it was still yummy!  You would never know it was gluten-free.  
Thanks for the recipe.

Disappointing-not sweet enough for me. Perhaps the lemon juice and peel overpowered the blueberries. Also, I thought something was missing-cinnamon or allspice, perhaps. Probably will not make again.

This bread is delicious.  It has wonderful flavor.  I used huge blueberries that were frozen and I dusted them with part of the flour in the recipe. They were evenly distributed throughout the bread.   I used Splenda instead of sugar. Could not tell the difference.   It is a wonderful recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing.

This bread had lovely flavour - nice and lemony. However, I don't think I will be making it again. I followed the recipe exactly but it took 2 hours in the oven and was still very undercooked and too moist. It wasn't wortht the oven time.

This was really flavorful.  I added only 1 Tb of lemon zest, and threw in some vanilla.  I also substituted apple sauce for the oil.  The glaze really makes the bread though!   Great change from the typical banana bread.

This bread was great - very moist and slightly tart, which I like to balance the sweets I had already at brunch. I made it with fresh blueberries, but did cut the lemon zest by 1/2. Yummy!

This was very tasty. I incorporated some of the recommendations of others which included:

1) although tempted, I did not increase the amount of blueberries. I do think you could increase by a little bit. I prefer a little more blueberries. 

2) I read that some had problems with the cake cracking or falling apart while taking out of the pan. I used baking goo (flour &  shortening) to treat my pan which always makes removal easy. But I did need to slide a knife around the edges as some blueberries around the top baked onto the pan sides. Otherwise, just be careful when handling as the blueberries create a cracking point for the bread to break apart.

3) I did not add the walnuts, but I did add poppyseeds which were great. I doubled the recipe and added 3 T, so 4.5 t for the recipe as is.

4) others mentioned the blueberries falling to the bottom so I used another reviewer's tip and actually didn't stir in the blueberries at all. I added the batter in 3 layers and dropped in 1/3 of the blueberries after each layer. Ironically, my blueberries ended up mostly at the top - almost like they floated up. Note, I did not toss them in flour. I did like the visual of having berries on the top.

5) For the glaze, I used confectioners instead of granulated sugar. I kept adding to get it thicker and think I easily doubled the amount of sugar. I was worried the bread might end up tasting too sweet, but it was the right amount of sweetness to taste like bread, and not cake. As others sugges

This was so delicious! It was moist and the perfect lemon tang. I'll definitely be making this again. Here are the changes I made:
Rolled blueberries in flour so they didn't sink, which seemed to work.
Excluded the nuts 
The glaze was super runny so I did 2 Tbsp lemon juice to 1 cup powdered sugar and 1 tsp melted butter per a different recipe.

I made this with Meyer lemons and fresh blueberries. I used a 9 x 5 loaf pan because that's what I had. I omitted the nuts, because I forgot to pick them up at the store. After reading the reviews I did dredge my blueberries through flour first to keep them from sinking to the bottom. It worked great. I also used powdered sugar instead of granulated sugar for the glaze. Plus I added lemon zest to the glaze. This bread was very good and close to a cake like texture. I will definitely make it again. The next time I think I will add more lemon zest and double up on the glaze. I could have used more lemony flavor.

I've been scouting this site for lemon recipes after scoring a box of Meyer lemons.  (They're nearly impossible to get on the East Coast.)  After peeling and seeding I processed the lemons and used, pulp and all , in this recipe.  I also subbed buttermilk and cranberries instead of milk and blueberries and mixed everything by hand.  Dense, sweet and sour - just the way I like it.  Next time I'll double the recipe because this made only 4 jumbo muffins.

Really really good. Read a few reviews -  dredged the blueberries in flour & that worked well.  If you're new to icing drizzle please note the video showed thickening it with confectionary sugar.  Mine definitely needed that.

DO NOT lightly grease pan!  Grease and flour as usual... Bottom half stuck to pan.  MESS!

I omitted nits and glaze. Otherwise, I followed recipe exactly. The bread is delicious! The only problem: we can’t stop eating it.

This cake was very good.  I have not baked in years and decided to make this recipe. I used the suggestions of other posters by adding the lemon juice to the milk and adding the lemon zest to the sugar.  Came out clean from the loaf pan. Served with coffee.

Delicious! I used Idaho wild huckleberries! SO good. Great balance with lemon/sugar/berries. I also used sour cream instead of milk. Also mine baked in 50 minutes.

Made this into muffins. 35 minutes for one batch of 12. Would have made the glaze with icing sugar instead. Current recipe is delicious!

I doubled the recipe, only difference is I ran out of lemon juice and had to substitute a Table spoon of water.  I did use parchment paper, so removing from pans was easy. I will definitely bake again!

Very flavourful, dense and moist bread. I used yogurt instead of milk (because I didn't have any) - and put in a bit of baking soda. Great recipe!

Soooo good and easy to follow. Used frozen blueberries because thats what I have available, used evaporated milk instead based on other reviews. Put almonds on top and some berries (coated with flour). 
Will sure make it again!

Delish! Used just a little more lemon juice in glaze to make it more lemony. Made sure glaze got into bread by placing a few small poke holes into top. Loved it.

This was the best lemon bread I have ever tasted!  I omitted the walnuts as I wanted only the lemon and blueberry tastes.  Also, I pricked the top of the bread all over after it cooled and let the glaze soak into it.  This made it even better!!  I will definitely make this many more times!

De-licious! For a richer bread i substituted evaporated milk for the regular milk and because i like vanilla, i added 1/4 tsp. Also only added 1 T of lemon rinde because the lemons i have access to have rather bitter peels, turned out great!

This is my daughter's favorite. I make it over and over again. I might suggest sprinkling extra lemon zest on top of batter before baking. Always use fresh blueberries. I also add a fresh tbsp of real lemon juice.

This bread was amazing!!! The only thing I didn’t like was that some of the bread stuck to the bottom of the pan. But I would recommend this to anyone because it’s so easy! I would make it again but make sure you grease the pan well.

This was like eating cake, so moist and delicious.  I didn't add the nuts.  I used bottled lemon juice and a tsp of lemon curd as a substitute for the zest.  I used frozen blueberries and as a result the crust was a a tad over done.  Next time I will thaw the blueberries completely!

This bread is delicious!  I made it as directed, except used a 9x5 loaf pan.  I put it in the refrigerator overnight and it came out of the pan easily. Also sliced easily.  This is a keeper!

Great breakfast treat!  Moist and tasty made as written.  I did use confectionary sugar with lemon for the frosting and spread it on 10 min before taking it out and then again after.  Very tasty.

This recipe is beyond fantastic. It's incredibly moist and the taste is incredible. I like bold flavors so I add the juice and zest of a whole lemon.

So delicious! Definitely more of a cake, but perfectly moist and lemony! I made sure to coat the blueberries in flour to stop them from sinking and also only added half of them to the batter, poured half of the batter into the pan and then gently folded the rest of the blueberries into the top half. I made my glaze with powdered sugar, the lemon juice, and a little lemon rind for added texture. It was immediately a house favorite!

This is sweet enough as it is without needing any icing.  My husband loved it with coffee, or as a snack, or.... well just about anytime!  Will make it again.

This came out perfect. It was light and airy. It was more of a cake consistency than a bread. I made it for my neighbors and it was a big hit. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I followed the recipe for the bread exactly. I used butter/flour to grease my pan. Used fresh blueberries and fresh lemon juice. For the glaze I used powdered sugar instead. After I spread the glaze on, I topped it off with a sprinkle of crystallized sugar. I didn’t have an issue with all of the blueberries sinking, I had no trouble getting it out of the pan, and I LOVE it. I will be making this again!!

I have made it as a bread loaf and as muffins (muffins cook roughly 35-40 min, toothpick tested) For both I have upped the temp to 375 and cooked an additional time to get done and lightly browned.

After reading the reviews, I am amazed that no one thought, as I did that the batter was not enough to house the 8x4 pan.  There was only 1 1/2 cups of flour in the recipe.  I said I would double the recipe. My bread, though very delicious, was only about 2 inches high.

This is delicious. I used margarine, and per a previous review place 1/2 blueberries in batter and the half on top. Baked in bunt pan for 45 minutes, and the omitted the glaze. It is just the right sweetness, and the lemon flavor is very subtle. Definitely will make again. Better than muffins and a lot easier!

Very good and easy recipe.  I did modify it by leaving out the nuts since I thought the two flavors of lemon and blueberry were enough.  I used frozen blueberries without thawing and they worked well. One thing I substituted and regretted was sour cream in place of the milk.  It made the bread a bit too dense - super moist but just a bit heavy.  But that’s all on me since the recipe didn’t call for it.

Delicious! Due to other reviewers, I added the blueberries last after putting the batter in the bread pan, and then gently pressed them down into the batter. That method worked well! I also used confectioners sugar for the glaze instead of regular sugar. Loved it!

The look of this turned out much better than I thought. I was really nervous because I make banana bread so often that it’s not as rich as id like it to be and is too dense. However, this lemon blueberry bread turned out beautiful! The lemon is wayyy too much which next time I’ll put half or one less tablespoon. I used thawed blueberries which didn’t sink in. I was afraid it would so I did pour half in the dough and poured the other half on top once in the pan and turned out amazingly! I love love the lemon glaze. I refrigerated the glaze and the bread overnight and then poured glaze on top in the morning. Delicious! I only wanted to eat the top of the bread! However you want to serve this is going to be delicious. I highly suggest less lemon juice though.

Well I thought I followed the directions exactly.  After I put it in the oven, I opened the microwave to warm up my coffee--there was the 1/3 cup of melted butter...Sowhat to do,  I baked it. made a glaze of powdered sugar, lemon juice and 2 tsp of the butter. Put that on about 10 minutes before I took it out of the oven as directed by one of the reviewers. My loaf tastes delicious, the glaze is a little crunchy around the edges and it really doesn't look beautiful but it has blueberries dispersed throughout and the best lemon taste I could ask for.  Serving for Christmas Brunch with other quick breads, fruit,  and a egg dish.

Great! 
I used frozen mixed berries (didn't have blueberries on hand).
I covered it with a simple cream cheese icing
Next time will add a bit more zest.

This is the 2nd time I’ve made this bread and we love it, I used pecans instead of walnuts and it was still tasty!

I made this following the recipe except I used Saskatoon's in place of the blueberries as I didn't have any, and add a tbsp. of veg oil.  It was very good and will definitely make it again.  A nice dessert to serve with coffee & tea for company.

Great bread for the holidays. We make our holiday bread early and freeze in freezer paper. Made small amount to see how it tasted. Went over so well that we will be making another 15 loaves for holidays. Great idea for a simple yet tasty gift.

This was quite good! I used frozen blueberries, which worked well and left out the nuts, because we don't care for them. I did not get the rise I was hoping for and it was a little close on the bottom, but very tasty! I think I will cut the sugar a bit next time, and it doesn't really need the glaze--it's very nice without,but if you like glaze and want to dress it up, have at it. Will definitely make again.

Made EXACTLY as written (which is probably a first) but I didn't really like it. Used fresh blueberries, I think the tastes are pretty well balanced (can taste both the berries and lemons) but it still doesn't do much for me. My toddler ate perhaps two bites, my husband ate most of one slice and didn't want any more...will be giving the rest away and not making it again. :-(

Followed others' advice and floured the blueberries and then layered them with batter as I poured into loaf pans and didn't have any issues with berries sinking. A nice bread.

this recipe was very easy to follow and the bread was quite delicious, however the  blueberries overpowered the lemon flavor. You couldn't taste the lemon at all.  I brought the cake to a church potluck dinner. Those that ate some of it said it was good - not great though. 
More lemon flavoring needed to be added so both the blueberry and lemon flavors were balanced.

I did not make any changes and followed the recipe. All I can say is that I can't wait to make this again.  I made two loaves as we were having out of town company.  I froze both loaves and after thawing,  each one was amazing.  Very moist and the combination of lemon and blueberry was perfect.  Goes great with that morning cup of coffee.  Thank you for the recipe!!

This is just delicious. I followed the instructions as written butpecans for the walnuts because that's what I had. I will now make it with walnuts and I think that's just a personal preference issue. It is more cake-like and the glaze simply gives it a delicate invisible sweet crusty texture on top. (I personally think putting frosting-like glaze made with powdered sugar would ruin it for me.)

What a great light dessert! Lemon can be so refreshing and this recipe is definitely that. I used lemon juice and no zest for convenience and the rest as written and I couldn't be happier. Thanks for sharing!

This makes a delicious loaf.   I added the blueberries in three stages, per a previous review and they were evenly distributed through the loaf when baked.   Only other change was to use powdered sugar in the glaze.   Will definitely make this again.   Great recipe.

This turned out very well.  Tasty!!!  I did add a half teaspoon of lemon extract to the batter as well as the 3 tablespoons of freshly squeezed lemon juice as we love the lemon flavor.  I had pecans instead of walnuts so that's what I used.  I used about a cup of icing sugar, the lemon juice and just a 1/4 tsp lemon extract for the glaze, which was perfect.  Delicious!   All in all, this loaf turned out very moist and very flavorful and with the lemon, you can still taste the blueberries and the pecans!  It was baked to perfection in 60 minutes and I used my Pyrex  glass  loaf pan.   Will definitely make this again!

I made this for a luncheon and it got rave reviews. I followed the directions as listed and it was so moist and delicious. Perfect!
I did make it again wondering how I could make it more heart healthy so I used olive oil instead of butter and folded in whipped egg whites and it was just okay.

Great flavor and texture.  I also made the glaze with the powdered sugar, which also had great flavor.  I used fresh lemons.  I used frozen blueberries that I froze from the farmers market.  I would try fresh the next time I make this, as the frozen blueberries all seemed to settle to the bottom.

Very disappointed.  Did not like the texture.  Didn't turn have the consistency of a bread such as zucchini bread. The lemon flavoring was over powering.  Very sour.

This is absolutely excellent. I have made it a few times now, most times following the recipe and have given away the recipe to numerous requests.  A keeper...I have changed it if I didn't have an ingredient on hand ie: coconut flakes for walnuts - it still taste's great. Moist, very lemon-y, crunch with walnuts.  I also spread the walnuts on top before baking just to add a bit of interest and when baked top with the glaze.  Delish..

I made this according to the recipe with fresh blueberries. It was moist and tender and not too sweet. 60 minutes at 350 in my oven was perfect. I will  be making this again.

This was so good.  So moist and just the right amount of lemon!  More like a cake than a bread.  Will definitely make again!

I made these in mini loaf pans. My pan makes 16; so I had enough batter to make 4 "muffin tops".  Instead of making a glaze I sprinkled them with course sugar before I baked them.
I will definitely be making these again.

This is our favorite!  I always use fresh lemons.  So good in blueberry season.  I always use the powder sugar for the glaze.

Very good! I'm not much into home baking seeing I baked for a living in my younger years, but every once in awhile I give it a go. The only thing I would change about this recipe is the glaze. The recipe's was too thin. I would use 10x sugar and warm water with a touch of corn syrup for a thicker glaze.

This bread was so moist and delicious!  My family loved it and I'll definitely make again, especially during blueberry season!  I think I would prefer a thicker glaze that sits on the surface of the bread instead of a liquidy one that soaks in.

Have already made this twice.  I didn't use the nuts because I didn't think they'd go well with other flavors. The second time I made this I added 1/2 C shredded coconut which was good. My family enjoyed it and I'll make it again.

I really like this recipe.  The lemon flavor was bright and tart.  The bread was moist.  The glaze is plentiful and will run off of the loaf.  I prefer the consistency of this glaze, so will take a toothpick and stab a few holes into the top next time so it soaks in.

This was soooo yummie!   Totally went with the recipe except had to take out the nuts to do allergies.   Changed the glaze to regular sugar mixed with powdered sugar and added in 2 scoops of melted vanilla ice cream, then froze it until thick.  OMG... this was so moist and the family loved it!    Will definitely make again.

I made this for a family reunion. The first loaf stuck to the bottom of the pan. The second loaf I made I used wax paper to line the pan and it came out perfect! I recommend using all fresh ingredients and not the lemon juice in a jar or plastic lemon. It was delicious and there wasn't any left from both loaves! I didn't change anything in the recipe and it was fantastic! I will definitely make again. I did dredge the blueberries in flour to prevent them all from sinking except the layer of berries on top. Perfect!

I didn't change a thing with the recipe and this is one of the best tasting breads I've ever made! Full of flavor and deliciously moist. I love everything that contains lemons if whichever form, and this bread is no exception! I brought it to a quilting retreat and the ladies loved it, too.

I made the recipe as is but no nuts since I didn't think it will add anything. It was delicious, no glaze needed for me. The lemon is not overpowering at all, just the perfect balance.

This Cranberry Lemon bread turned out very nice.  However, even though I floured the fresh  blueberries, they sunk to the bottom.    I will make this recipe again, omitting the walnuts, ease up a little on the lemon zest and adding a little more flour to the blueberries.

I thought it was delicious. The flavour combination of the lemon & blueberry was quite enjoyable. I used half sugar & half Splenda & it turned out great.I would use frozen blueberries as I did this time & it was fine. I would definitely make it again.

Took to my hand and floor group, they loved it. I may have mixed to well, it had more of a cake texture. So if you want a bread mix with care.

This is a definite keeper! Very moist  and fresh flavored. Made just as written except I left it in the pan until the glaze had all been absorbed so it didn't run off.

I had to adapt the recipe for high altitude (8500 ft.)  I added 2 tblsp flour,  1 additional egg,  and 2 tablespoons of buttermilk . It had good rise but they aren't kidding about it baking for an hour.  Even at the altitude adjustment  of 375 degrees it was an hour.   Taste and texture are excellent  I made the glaze with powdered sugar instead of regular sugar and added 1/2 tsp lemon extract  to step up the lemon flavor.

Not particularly impressed.  I do more cooking than baking, but i followed the recipe carefully and the loaf did come out looking  like the picture.  It rose to a nice shape, but it was dense and heavy, and not a lot of lemon flavor.  I used a glass loaf pan... someone said that that makes things different than if baked in a metal pan.  But was expecting more of a lemony flavor, and a lighter loaf.  Considering the amount of butter and sugar in the loaf, i had a couple of slices and then tossed the rest.  Not terrible by any means,  but not at all what was expected.

I loved the loaf! I didn't put any nuts in or put a glaze drizzle. It also tastes better if you put 1/4 cup of sugar. I baked for 40-50 minutes instead of 1 hour. I also put 1/4 cup of  blue berries. The whole family loved it! Very moist!

I made this gluten free and vegan.  I used a mix of oat flour and coconut flour, I also used chia seeds soaked in water to replace the eggs and substituted coconut sugar in place of refined sugar and replaced the blueberries with raspberries since that what I had on hand.  It came out delicious, served it warm out of the oven with a scoop of coconut vanilla ice cream.

Made this today and followed everything except I put only 1/2 cup sugar and omitted the glaze.   It baked for 50 min. in my convection toaster oven and came out perfect.  Hubby and I really liked it.  The lemon flavor was subtle and the blueberries just right.  Will definitely make again and highly recommend it for everyone to try.

After taking the bread out of the oven, I poked holes in the bread with a long wooden pick and poured the lemon glaze over the top.  I added lemon zest to the glaze.  Yum yum.  This is so good.  The combination of the blueberries and lemon will knock your socks off!!

This was super yummy and fairly easy to make. I followed the recipe pretty much to a T. The only change was to the glaze. I made it with powdered sugar and lemon juice, drizzled over the top and added some lemon zest and granulated sugar for a nice finish.

Wonderful flavor and easy to make.  I used less sugar and made glaze out of lemon and confection sugar. Just drizzled on top.

Very luscious moist texture .  I used the recipe pretty much as written except I didn't have a lemon for zesting so I used half the amount of lemon extract.  I also used more sugar to thicken the glaze.

I have made this twice already.  It is delicious!  I made it just as the recipe reads.  I have read where some have added more blueberries.  That seems excessive.  I like the balance between the lemon and blueberries.  I may make another loaf tomorrow!

I would make this again.  I used chopped pecans instead of walnuts and I toasted them slightly before adding.  I put the lemon zest and pecans in with the dry ingredients and then stuck to the recipe.  For the glaze, I used 1 TBSP of reserved lemon juice (so one full lemon used for the whole recipe), and added about 1/4 cup of sifted icing sugar.  I poured that directly on the loaf when I took it out of the oven, let the loaf cool for 10-15 minutes and then turned the loaf out onto a rack, and the glaze stuck to the loaf, not the pan.  My guests loved it!

I used softened butter and whipped the butter and sugar and also added the lemon juice to the milk and the zest to the sugar before combining. It is delicious.  The lemon makes this recipe so fresh and works so well with the blueberries.

I picked my own blueberries for this recipe- and rolled them in flour to prevent sinking. No nuts, but I did add Vanilla extract and Almond extract to help sweeten it. No icing as it is very good without, as long as you store it in the fridge right after baking it stays very moist. Made 3 loaves on my first try and wasn't disappointed at all!

This was an easy recipe.  I followed it exactly.  I might thicken up the glaze a bit, but certainly loved the taste just as it was.  Lemon and blueberries compliment each other well.

This cake/bread was incredibly good.  A lot of lemon flavor - but not overpowering, and the blueberries married with the lemon extremely well.  I will omit the nuts the next time.  They just did not do justice to the recipe - did not seem like they belonged there.  Otherwise - fantastic!!  Will make again- MANY times.  My invalid friend truly enjoyed it as well.

I doubled the recipe and made as directed.   Put in 5 small pans.   I did coat the frozen berries with flour before adding to the batter and they were evenly throughout the bread.

Made it exactly as per recipe apart from leaving out the nuts and it turned out fabulous! Only thing I did different was add half the blueberries to the mix poured half the mix into the tin then sprinkled more of the blueberries on top then the very last of them over the top after pouring all of the mix in this stopped them all sinking to the bottom.

Absolutely delicious! I substituted the flour for gluten free flour and used coconut milk instead of whole milk. I ran out of walnuts and used pistachios instead. This bread was so yummy I could eat the entire loaf!

Delicious! I used lots of blueberries  (1.5 c?) because I had some that needed to be used, otherwise no changes.  I was surprised at how much I liked the lemon flavor. Noticeable but not overpowering. Very light & fresh. I wasn't able to remove mine from the pan without ruining it, so it stayed in. I'll make this again.

No changes.  Made it just as the recipe instructed.  Used fresh blueberries. Baked it  55-60 min in a dark loaf pan 8"
x 4".  I whisked the sugar and water into a glaze and painted it all onto the cake while the cake was hot and sitting on a cooling rack over foiled counter.  I sliced it warm and took it over to neighbor's home who just had a hip replacement.  She had no appetite, but, she ate multiple pieces of this lemon blueberry cake.

This came together really easily, though I would be sure to really greese the pan because mine crumbled a bit. I did last it right out of the oven, and it wasn't near as good as it was the next morning. It was moist and so flavorful that I will definitely be making this again.

This was an excellent recipe, dense and moist crumb. I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and doubled the recipe. Baked in a bundt pan at 325 in my convection invention for 1 hr & 22 min.

One word -- yum!  Omitted the walnuts and added about a teaspoon of lemon extract just to give it more of a lemon taste.  I did not put on the glaze because it is Lent and that would make it seem too much of a dessert.  Even without the glaze it was divine.  All of the bunko women loved it, which means less for me for breakfast tomorrow.  Definitely a keeper.

Just made this and though it is still hot from the oven, I just had to try it. . .delicious! Came together very quickly and easily. I accidentally omitted the milk, but since I had cut back on the sugar a little, the batter was not too dry. Even with forgetting an ingredient, it is still a great recipe. Highly recommend making this one!

Excellent loaf with a really nice lemon flavor.  I swapped out the blueberries for Saskatoons because we prefer the flavor.  Very easy to make!

This was delicious. I reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup because my blueberries were very sweet. I also upped the lemon juice to 4tbs per other reviews. I enjoy lemon flavor and want to make sure it comes through. I will be making this again.

Just bursting with flavor.  Mine didn't come out of the pan very nicely (pieces stuck to the bottom), so I put it back in and poured the glaze on.  This worked out perfectly because the glaze is meant to soak into the cake, not remain on top; leaving it in the pan allowed it to do this without running over and pooling.  Next time I will increase the blueberries and trying the trick someone else had mentioned - only half the blueberries in the batter, pour half into the pan, add the other half of the blueberries and pour remaining batter on top.  My blueberries sank to the bottom, even with a flour coating.  I left out the nuts.

So moist and very delicious.  I used the juice of 2 lemons and the zest as well because I really wanted more of the lemon taste.  I did not make the glaze.  This is a nice pick me up snack in the middle of the afternoon with a cup of tea or just as yummy with your morning coffee.

Really great bread with a few tweaks. I cut the sugar down to 2/3 cup and increased lemon juice to 4 T.  I also added 1 tsp of extract to really give it a lemony kick.  I used fresh blueberries but will be using frozen blueberries the next time I make this receipe. I did not make the glaze as we do not like our breads to be overly sweet. My husband loved it!

I made muffins - yielded 12 but they were just under the papers, so for a more  "full" muffin I would have probably do 9 next time.  Good lemony flavor!

This was a good bread, except is was a bit too lemony for my my taste.  If I make it again, I might reduce the amount of lemon juice.  Other than that, it was good.

Cake turned out delicious! I didnt do the syrup, instead I made a simple icing with a tablespoon of cream cheese, the juice of one small lemon, about 3 tablespoons of butter and about a cup of powdered sugar. Drizzled over warm loaf and served. If you cut it while the cake is still hot it will fall apart a bit but still allow you to cut sliced portions. About 8 thick slices, yum!!!!

Just tastes like a blueberry muffin. Lemon flavor is not noticeable. It doesn't taste bad--it's just really bland for a lemon loaf. I won't make it again.

The bread was so good. It has a strong lemon flavor. So, if you don't like lemon, this is not for you. You can probably leave out the lemon.

5-20-2016  ~Just delicious – SO moist and lemony,  even tho’ I only used half the amount of lemon zest called for.  I didn’t want to “destroy” another lemon or two just for another tablespoon of zest.  To my delight it turned out just as I would have preferred it – not sure I would have liked this as much had I used twice as much zest.  For my tastes, walnuts don’t belong in lemon bread, so I omitted them, throwing in another handful of blueberries instead. Don’t skip the lemon glaze!  I swear it’s what takes this over the top.  Brush it on, little by little, while the CAKE (yes, this is cake!) is still warm and let it be absorbed slowly.

This has been my "go to" recipe for a long time.  We have a Lemon Tree so this makes excellent use of our lemons! I use confectioners sugar instead of the granulated for the topping.  Love this and my husband asks me to make this quite often.  Good with plain yogurt dollup or ice cream too!

I've made this twice now, both times I made it into mini muffins, which my kids LOVED! So cute. I did 1.5x the recipe with 3-cups of blueberries which filled 48 mini muffins perfectly. Baked at 350 in convection for 18-20 min. 
Used frozen blueberries so I rinsed, tossed and drained. Omitted the salt and used powdered sugar for the glaze. Also dusted some powdered sugar on top. Very yummy!

I stayed true to the recipe, with the one exception of coating my blueberries in flour like another user suggested to keep them from sinking. It was perfect. I would say putting frosting on it too is optional, as it tasted amazing as it was, but I would suggest powdered sugar instead of white if you do opt to put it on. About a cup and a half mixed with 3 tbsp lemon juice should do the trick. So good, will definitely make again!

Very good.  I used blackberries instead of blueberries out of necessity.

Moist & delicious! Perfect favors.  I used plain Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream, because that was what I had on hand.

This is the perfect bread recipe! The texture is fluffy, (don't over mix!)moist, and cake-like. 
Besides being a lovely lemon blueberry bread,  I have used the base recipe for a chocolate chunk loaf, mixed berry loaf, and cinnamon raisin loaf,  by replacing the  lemon juice with extra milk.  Very versatile! 
I underbake mine a bit to keep it extra moist, but that is just my preference. Thanks!

This recipe made 12 delicious, light, lemony  muffins. I baked them for 21 minutes at 375 degrees. I used half a cup of confectioners sugar mixed with the juice of half a lemon for the glaze. That made just enough glaze to brush a light glaze on the 12 muffins. 2 good sized lemons was just right for the zest and juice required for the muffins and the glaze. My husband really loved these. Thank you so much for the recipe. I will make them many times!

This is like a coffee cake in a bread form. Very moist.  I only made half the glaze using powder sugar instead of regular. You really don't need any topping or could just sprinkle some powder sugar over.  It is sweet enough as is.  I really like that you can use fresh or frozen berries - no defrosting needed.

Delicious!  As another reviewer recommended, I also let the bread coo, in the refrigerator  for an hour or so before glazing and cutting.  Excellent recipe.  I give loaves often as gifts.

Excellent bread! My one lemon didn't provide the all of the juice needed, so I had to use bottled lemon juice for the difference. I followed a reviewer's idea of adding half of the glaze to the bread with 10 min cooking time left, and the rest after the bread was removed from the oven. I omitted the nuts,  because I didn't think I'd like them here. Also dusted the fresh blueberries with a little flour, and they dispersed nicely. I let the bread rest in the pan slightly longer than than the 10 min because the pan still seemed very hot. When I did remove it, I wrapped it in foil while it was still a little warm and placed it in the fridge for a few hours. Had a piece already, and it sliced great and was delicious! Thanks for the keeper of a recipe, ChezSpice!

I've made this wonderful recipe for a few years. It is moist and delicious. I get requests for the recipe all the time.  I make it as written and find it to be perfect!  I agree with one reviewer, don't over-do the berries, as tempting as they are. Imix 3/4 of them in the batter and dump the remainder on top.

This is excellent!  I had enough lemon juice left for the glaze which did not specify confectioners sugar but that is the sugar I use for glazing.  Will definitely be using again.

I love this bread and get asked monthly to make it for my coworkers.  I always use fresh lemons,fresh blueberries and double sift the flour. The result is amazing!  I never get the glaze quite right and am still playing around with that, mostly it doesn't need it though.

We substituted 1 cup of all-purpose flour for 1 cup of self-rising flour.  Aside from that we pretty much "winged" the recipe, not really using precise measurements.  The bread came out moist and delicious, as seen on Platter http://goo.gl/pdD7rz

it was amazing! super easy to make! when I made it, I made the lemon glaze really thin and then drizzled it onto the loaf while poking holes in the loaf so that the glaze would sink in. SO GOOD!

This a good tasting cake.  I assume its referred to as a bread because of the amount of batter can perfectly bake in a loaf pan(which I use regularly for banana bread).  Already having done my grocery shopping for the week and being stuck inside due to snow storm, I did not prep before making this, so I was pleased with the only (not typical ingredients needed were lemons and blueberries).  I used Tru Lemon flavoring, but definitely was not strong enough!  I have plenty of fresh blueberries to use, but I think raspberries might go well with the base of this recipe.  I also reduced the sugar by half(for my own taste) because we will have this as a breakfast bred and most likely spread butter on it, we won't miss the extra sugar.  Took 60 minutes to bake.  I would make this recipe again and would be great with any fruit flavored herbal tea.

Lovely lemon flavor, most with a nice crusty on the top. Used frozen berries rinsed and floured, lemon zest in the glaze with the extra icing sugar, could have checked the cook time a but earlier add was done in under the hour. Did not rise as much as i expected. Greased and floured the Ian to prevent sticking and after running the rim with a knife and letting cool for 10 min the loaf came out easily. Overall, a winner.

I liked the taste and the lemon but would add more blueberrys next time.  Also I made mini loafs and I probably didn't cook long enough it was gummy inside next time will cook longer.

I tried this recipe and my family absolutely love it.  I didn't change a thing. The blueberries were plump and did not sink to the bottom.
Enjoy it as it is so easy to make.  This recipe rocks.  Thanks so much for sharing

Really, really good breakfast bread! I used slightly less sugar (less than a full cup but more than 3/4 cup) I didn't add walnuts and used buttermilk as someone else suggested. I was struggling to get enough lemon zest so I added lemon extract as well. We all really enjoyed this! I also used powdered sugar in the glaze. Other than grating the zest, this recipe took no time at all and smelled wonderful while baking.

Loved this recipe! I omitted the nuts and skipped the glaze because I wanted the lemon and blueberry to be the main flavor to have with my morning coffee. It was delicious and I can't wait to make it with the nuts and glaze, depending on the occasion. You could definitely tell from the flavor it was a homemade bread!

If I could give this 10 stars I would!  I had to stop myself from acting the whole loaf lol!  I used fresh lemon and fresh picked blueberries and it was amazing!  The only minor changes I had to make were that I made a regular 10x glaze as I ran out of lemon, I used 3 T butter and almost 3 T applesauce, and no nuts.  Thank you so much for this recipe!  It will be a staple!

I have made five loaves so far and everyone loves it. The key is to have fresh lemons and don't be skimpy with the fresh lemon zest. Through trial and error I learned that for maximum flavor use the zest of one large lemon per loaf. This is baked in a "small" loaf pan. I have successfully doubled the ingredients for two small loaves. I have also used walnuts, as called for, and pecans, when I didn't have walnuts on hand. This is a great, flavorful quick bread recipe. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

This was so pretty and yummy tasting. Turned out beautiful and very moist. I omitted the nuts. Next time, I may use a little less lemon zest or juice as it was very lemony indeed!

Baked this yummy loaf this morning for Mother's Day using big, juicy cultured frozen blueberries. Mom's assessment said it all: "It's perfect!" Thanks Julianne for a winning, 'keeper' recipe that whipped up in a breeze.

This was a good recipe however, I could use help with adjustment for altitude! It came out more like a loaf of bread pudding. I did make a simple syrup of oj and turbino sugar to drizzle(excellent addition)!
I also used organic wild blueberries (defrosted) and sunflower seeds (in place walnuts).It was great using different products on hand. Everyone ate it up.Take the risk.

Loved the deep lemon flavor...great way to use up my frozen blueberries. Great with coffee when friends drop in.  I'll definitely use this again.  Make sure to use the right sized loaf pan.  I have some bigger ones, but used the size recommended, which is more for a small loaf.

I doubled the recipe, used pecans and baked it in a bundt pan for 70 mins.  (This makes a LOT of cake) I mixed everything but the blueberries in my stand mixer.  I folded the berries in right before turning into the pan and baking.  They seemed evenly distributed and I didn't have any trouble with them sinking.  I had no problem with it falling apart but, that could be because the bundt pan caused more even baking.  I also used powdered sugar for the glaze.  Since the glaze kept dripping off the cake I used a baster to put it back on.  I think this made the cake super moist. It was a huge hit at Easter dinner.  And, even better in the few days following.  Everyone got a piece to take home!

this is so delicious! very moist and flavorful! i used frozen wild blueberries that i got at the grocery store and they didn't sink at all! wild blueberries are a bit smaller so i think that helps them stay in place. i also used the technique of layering them in: put in some batter, put in some berries, etc. until it was all used up. worked out great! thanks for the super recipe!

I used raspberries instead of blueberries and it turned out so yummy! I think it could've used a little less glaze, and I made sure to drop raspberries on the top of the mixture filled pan so not all the raspberries would sink to the bottom.

I made this recipe with buttermilk instead of milk, used 1 tbsp dried lemon peel in place of fresh lemon zest and changed the glaze to 1/2 cup powdered sugar. I did not thaw the blueberries, but did coat them in flour.  I also made it in (4) 6" mini loaves.  It was so good that the first four loaves were gone in one afternoon (2 taken home by guests).  I made a 2nd batch the following morning to have some for oursleves.  Fantastic!

Yummy!!! Didn't even bother with the glaze, delicious and full of flavor! Wasn't shy with the lemon. The blueberries sunk to the bottom half of the loaf but still delicious. Everyone ate 3 big pieces, too good to resist :)

Very Moist, very good. I didnt have the lemon, so I added vanilla extract and some cinnamon as well. Fresh blueberrys and fresh pecans (not a walnut eater). This bread was gone in less then an hour. I recommend it to everyone. As soon as I get to the store im gonna try it with real lemons.

WAY too much lemon.  I added the 3 tbs lemon juice initially called for, but after tasting the batter and realizing it was too lemony, I cut the zest in half, added a 1/4 cup sugar to the batter (to cut out the bitterness), and skipped the glaze.  I liked the final product and will make this again but WITH my modifications.

I really want to love this recipe, the flavor is amazing, but the bread is just so very moist and delicate that is is near impossible to serve without ending up with a pile of crumbs. I baked it in a bundt pan for 45 minutes and it plated just fine but disintergrated with the first slice.

I am trying again and will leave it in the warm oven after baking to see if I can dry it out a bit and achieve a little crust. Glaze seems pointless, it didn't add anything to the taste or presentation. Wonderful flavor.

I actually hate baking but this recipe is in my repertoire. I find it easy to make and really tasty. It's spongy and the lemon and blueberries are a fabulous combo. I've never added the walnuts, the texture is perfect and think they might detract from it.

I tried this, but it didn't turn out too well. It tasted great, but most of the blueberries settled to the bottom of the pan and stuck. I didn't know until afterwards about coating the blueberries in flour to prevent this. You may want to add that tip to the recipe for others. I ate it anyway!

The bread wasn't bad, but it didn't bake well. The flavor of the lemon and blueberries was very bold, but it needed a little something else. I would not make this recipe again. It was just ok.

Excellent flavor and texture.  I used the zest and juice of a fresh lemon, and used powdered icing sugar instread of white sugar to make the glaze.

Very easy, delicious recipe... will make this again.

I did enjoy the flavor. I doubled the lemon juice and zest for more flavor. I also used half sugar half splenda. My only issue was I thought these were dense and that is the reason I am not giving it 5stars. My hubby really liked this bread though.

Even though I "ruined" this bread (my fault), the flavour was fantastic! I left out the walnuts, zested 3 regular sized lemons (I doubt that came to be 2T) and mixed with wet ingredients, and added more lemon juice (almost 1/2C) along with about 3/4t of pure vanilla. Because I didn't have the right sized pan, I baked it in 9x5 loaf pan (too big for this bread), so so the texture of this bread became "doughy" and didn't rise well. But lemon flavour was definitely there and just love the taste. I will definitely make it again and next time I will lessen the milk amount because I don't want to lesson the lemon juice amount. Like one of the top reviewers said, do NOT add too much blueberries (not more than 1 cup)!

This recipe is fantastic! I have always skipped the glaze topping- I tried it once with a homemade streusel.  I used leftover nuts, oats, brown sugar, a little flour and butter.  I pulled the bread out a few minutes early, added the struesel and put it back in.  A nice change up!

I read quite a few of the reviews prior to making this recipe.  Based on the reviews alone, I expected a really outstanding lemon blueberry bread.  I was a little disappointed.  

It's not a terrible recipe by any means.  It has a nice buttery flavor and the overall texture of the bread (cake?) was quite lovely.  I also found that it could do with a bit more sweetness --- but this could be because I didn't make the icing.  

Some of the reviews said that they added 2 cups of blueberries.  I don't know how their breads turned out because I thought the 1 cup was more than sufficient.  In fact, I would even reduce to 3/4 cups.  Most of the blueberries ended up on the bottom of the bread and made it a touch soggy.  

I would also recommend a smaller loaf pan.  The 4x8 IMO was too big.  The sliced portions of the lemon blueberry bread were not much bigger than biscotti.  

I also added vanilla for flavoring.

This recipe is the best, so moist, fresh tasting....please stop me! I zest 2 lemons and squeeze them both for the juice. It strikes a nice balance with the blueberries.

This is a great recipe! I used the recipe for muffins instead of bread, and with substitutions, made the muffins vegan. I substituted earth balance margarine for the butter, 2 tbsp flaxseed stirred into 6 tbsp water instead of the eggs, and used hemp milk instead of regular milk. I also omitted the blueberries and nuts, used 4 tbsp lemon juice, and a whole ton of lemon zest...maybe 1/4 cup or so. The result---most and delicious!

Delicious!  My husband was very impressed with this bread - he didn't know blueberries and lemon pair so well.  I did use powdered sugar as recommended by other reviewers and I brushed some of that glaze on about 15 minutes before the baking was done.  I also greased and floured the pan before hand and had no problem taking the bread out. I will be making this again.

Made this tonight. This is a great quick bread....it has two of my favorites lemon and blueberries. This bread had a cake like texture which I enjoyed. The only thing that keeps me from giving the recipe 5 stars is the glaze. I love lemon but the juice with the sugar makes this bread way too tart. I will make again however next time I will either leave out the glaze or just use a regular glaze of milk and confectioner sugar.

I've made this recipe numerous times at this point, almost always without the glaze and its been rather popular every time.

I've also done this recipe at high altitude and Allrecipes has a useful page for catering to baking at higher altitude:

I made one bread to try it out it came out so good that I popped two more in the oven I will freeze them for later use.Husband raved over this recipe.I just omitted the zest but did use the fresh lemon juice which makes a difference.Excellent!!

Yes, this was a very good bread and I got the thumbs up from my hubby.  I followed the recipe to a T and the only setback was that I had it in the oven for exactly 60 minutes and it was about 5-7 minutes too long.  So the bottom wasn't very pretty but it was still edible.  Next time I'll make two loaves- blueberry & cranberry!

This bread is already gone a day later.  The only thing I did differently was replace the nuts with more blueberries.  Excellent recipe and very lemony!

Absolutely delicious!!  My husband said it tastes like it's from a restaurant and my three y/o son couldn't get enough of it which says a lot because he is the pickiest eater ever and rarely tries anything new.  It was perfect just the way it is, no additions whatsoever.  If people don't like lemon flavor then don't even bother making it.  I don't get how it can how people can say it has TOO MUCH lemon flavor since lemon is that's what it's supposed to be.  I did have to bake mine for about 90 minutes though and I also poked holes with a toothpick so the glaze would soak into the bread instead of roll off the top and onto the sides.  DELICIOUS!  Make it this weekend!

I left out the nuts because I wanted to send it to school for the kids' lunch and their schools are nut-free, but it still tasted really good. I have already passed the recipe on to someone else who tried it and loved it.

This is a wonderful recipe that I'll most likely be making over and over. I made the mix into muffins instead of a loaf and was uncertain whether the glaze would work on it so I did'nt bother...I made this in the assortment of sweets I made for my brothers 28th bday and I must say him and his buddies greatly appreciated it.

Amazing and delicious! We don't use nuts so I subsitituted 1/2 cup of flour for them.  I also mixed 1/2 of the amount of blueberries (rolled in flour) and lightly pressed the remaining half on the top of the batter before baking.  A perfect recipe!

I really didn't like this bread. The texture didn't turn out right, and when I pulled it out of the pan it fell apart. I thought that the flavors didn't really go together that well, and there was too much lemon. My dad was the only one in the family who liked it and I am not planning on making it again.

I followed the recipe almost exactly (left out 1 tablespoon of lemon juice) and it is very, very good.  I should have greased my pan bit more as it stuck to the bottom and that's where all the blueberries were.  I will definitely make this recipe again!

Reduced sugar and still found it sweet enough, and moist.  Just a little disappointed it didn't rise at all, if I'd known that I would have used a different-sized pan.

Loved the combination of the zesty lemon and blueberries! Flouring the frozen blueberries kept them from sinking and, like another reviewer suggested, I folded half into the batter and then cut the other half into the top of the batter after pouring it into the pan. I also brushed half of  the glaze on 10 minutes before the bread was done baking and the remainder after taking it out of the pan. Added a drizzle of lemon icing for added sweetness and presentation, and it was delicious. Sure, it may be more like a cake than a quick bread, but I definitely have no trouble eating cake for breakfast!

I was expecting much better results because all of the reviews were good, but it was just okay.  Many people said the texture was cake-like but what I got was dense and mediocre.  It flat out tasted bad when it was warm but it was pretty good at room temperature.  I was not very satisfied.

Made as written except for only using about 1/4 cup butter because that is all I had left and had already bought lemons and really wanted to try this bread.  It still turned out great and my daughter said that it was her all time favorite bread that I had made.  She loves anything lemon.  I baked in 3 mini-loaf pans, and they were done in about 40 minutes.  I brushed the glaze on while still warm and it kind of seeped into the top of the bread and is a must on this recipe.

Made this today for a coffee morning with friends. So disappointed I just do not like the combination of Blueberries/Lemon/Walnuts.  I think the lemon cake on its own may be pretty good, but these so different tastes do not work well together at all.

I made this for church, it turned out great. I would possibly leave out the nuts next time. It had a wonderful flavor. Super easy to make and it baked well. It baked for 60 min with the center still raw. Ended up baking for 75 min total.

Good recipe, but the taste was still a little off. Still on the hunt for a great lemon bread.

Yum!  I left out the zest because I was out of lemons, but I think it really needs it to intensify the lemon flavor.  Will definitely make again!

This was easy to make, took exactly 60 minutes in my oven and is very moist. My kids thought it had too many blueberries and I have to agree. Maybe it was because our berries were giant though. I will make this again.

In my opinion, I'm being generous w/3 stars, but hubby really liked it so.... I felt that the lemon flavor was waaaaaay overpowering-extremely tart. The bread comes out of the oven very light in color & is a very delicate loaf. I put some in the freezer & will try it at a later date. Maybe it'll get better with time.

This was very good!  I didn't have any lemon zest (or lemons to make zest), so I just used an extra tablespoon of lemon juice.  I also used liquid egg substitute instead of eggs.  Finally, I added some streusel that I made (use any streusel recipe...mine has butter, brown sugar, flour, pecans). I added this to the top just before putting it into the oven.  When it came out of the oven, I drizzled the glaze over the streusel. I then refrigerated for several hours.  It was delicious!

This bread turned out moist, zesty, and delicious! Love the tangyness from the lemon juice and the lemon zest, and using fresh blueberries made this bread sooo good. The glaze is a treat too. I also omitted the walnuts (not a fan of nuts). Will be making this for parties/socials!

Incredible!!! I omitted the walnuts and used soy milk instead of regular. I followed a reviewer's advice and brushed on half the glaze ten minutes before it came out of the oven and the other half once it cooled slightly. This is one of the tastiest cakes I've ever had.

The lemon/blueberry combination just didn't work for me. I used whole wheat flour, the juice of one lemon, and about 3/4 C sugar instead of 1 C since that seemed a bit much, and 3/4 tsp salt. I skipped the glaze, and I'm glad I did because this was sufficiently tangy/sweet without it. It turned out nice and moist, but I won't be making this again.

I made this for hubby and he likes it so I'm giving four stars. However, I didn't. I wasn't making it for myself anyway, but to me it tasted like a fruit cake. Mine was heavy and dense. Perhaps I didn't add enough Xanthan Gum (mine was of course GF for him), but I really don't think that was it. I'll only make this again if he requests it.

Fast and tasty! I used whole wheat flour. I would recommend using fresh lemon juice instead of bottled, because I could barely taste the lemon flavor. I think fresh juice is more potent.

This turned out great!  I doubled the amount of blueberries it called for and took the previous advice of dusting the blueberries with flour to keep them from sinking to the bottom.  It worked.  The loaf was very moist.  My husband loved it with butter, or cream cheese icing, and the lemon sauce!  Will definitely make this again!

This bread was gone within 5 minutes.  It is so good and different from other breads I have tasted.  I didn't use the nuts.  Also, after reading the reviews I couldn't decide whether to use the lemon juice and sugar for the glaze like it calls for or make a powdered sugar glaze like some others had.  I decided to do both.  I cut in half the lemon juice and sugar and put it on 10 minutes before the bread was done baking (as another reviewer suggested).  Then I made a glaze with butter, lemon juice, vanilla, and powdered sugar.  It was heavenly.  I tried it before the second glaze and it was good too.  But it was incredible with both.  Make sure to let the bread cool as it says in the recipe.  I tried to get mine out the the pan while still hot and the bottom fell off.  Still delish.

This was pretty good! I changed it up a little, b/c I didn't have all of the ingredients and I felt like being creative. I subbed 1/2 cup of the ap flour for corn meal to make it interesting, and added a dash of nutmeg. Also, I didn't make the glaze, which would have been good. No walnuts or blueberries, just lemon muffins. :)

As others have said it is very cake like.  I thought it was okay.  I gave it a 4 star because my husband loved it.  I did not have lemon zest so I used orange instead.  Turned out fine.  Make sure to use the glaze on top as it really adds alot to the bread.

This was a wonderful treat. I used whole wheat flour, half applesauce/half oil, 1/4+ brown sugar, 1/4+ white sugar, and omitted the glaze. It was still sweet and much healthier... much more like a cake than a bread. I even forgot the extra lemon juice and it was still fantastic!

This was good.  The lemon taste was great.  I read the review that said not to add more blueberries.  I WILL add more next time, it could have used them.  It was a heavy bread and best with tea.  It wasn't the tremendously scrumptious bread I thought it would be, but it was good and I will make again for tea time.

I can't believe I've been making this bread for 3 years now and I'm just now reviewing it!  This is hands-down the BEST blueberry bread I've ever had.  I love the lemon flavor, and the bread is just so moist and tasty that I can't resist eating it when it's around.  SOOOOOOO GOOD!

This is a great recipe!  I made muffins rather than the bread and cooked them for about 30 minutes, until the tops were golden brown.  I didn't add the topping or the walnuts because my daughter is allergic to nuts!  Let's just say, I've had to make double the recipe each time I made them!  Remember to use muffin liners! :)

It's ok.  Not my favorite.  My husband liked it though.  The blueberries sunk and were all at the bottom.  THe bread was more like a cake and it was moist.  I'll look for something else.

This bread is incredible.  My husband is a lemon freak and I love blueberries, so this bread was perfect for us.  Whatever you do, don't skip the glaze-it accents the bread perfectly.

Good recipe in my first attempt at baking bread... I made the mistake of using a blueberry compote/filling rather than blueberries, which made the dough gooey and overly sweet. I'll try this again correctly in the near future, and re-review.
Somewhat bachelor friendly... even with a lemon zester, it's still tedious.

Very delicious! I cannot eat sugar so I substituted the sugar for sucranat and it was wonderful. I did not add the glaze. I tried to cut the bread fairly soon after it was made and that was a big mistake. It fell to pieces. The next day the bread did not fall apart and was even tastier!

Oh......this was so good!!!!  I couldnt wait for it to cool down so had it warm.  Mine was not too soft.  I used frozen blueberries but baked it 70 mins.  I used only 1/2 tsp salt.  I did not make the glaze but plan to do that next time.  It's just delicious...

DELICIOUS! I would omit the glaze next time - the lemon in the bread itself is plenty. Otherwise, it's a bit overpowering and takes away from the yummy goodness of the bread. I made it with the blueberries but also made it using cranberries instead and it was just as delicious. I usually omit the nuts as we're not big fans. Thanks for sharing.

followed recipe exactly except for soy substitutions for butter and milk and the glaze where i used confectioners vs. white sugar - baked for 60 minutes . . and it was awesome.  was worried that based on other people's reviews that it would come out too moist and would need to wait to refrigerate to eat but was able to eat it immediately warm. can't wait to try it as muffins.

Made this bread and followed the directions to the letter using fresh rather than frozen blueberries.  Wasn't sure of the lemon glaze but it was a perfect topping.  Never like to experiment with recipes until I've made it once according to the directions.  It was a little sweeter than I'm use to.  Felt the bread made a better dessert than a bread because it was very sweet.

I jumped out of bed early this morning to make this.  I'm sorry I didn't sleep in!  How can anything with fresh blueberries and lemon be so bad, I asked myself.  I wish I knew.  I followed the recipe exactly and I really don't know what the problem was.  My suggestion for future users.  Try it yourself before you give it to someone else.

This bread was very tasty! I didn't have any fresh lemons on hand so I used bottled lemon juice and lime zest, which was very good. Also, I thought the bread was sweet enough without the glaze so I left it off. It tasted even better the next day, once the flavors had a chance to develop.

I made this to bring to work tomorrow, but wont bring it in. It doesn't rise at all- in fact it shrinks!! It is very dense- only about 1 1/2 inch high in the end! Good flavor, but just not what I was expecting and not good for presentation

I thought it was ok, but nothing special. I nixed the walnuts and lemon glaze but left everything else. If I made it again, I would add more lemon juice/zest.

I'd have to agree with the last review...I thought the lemon way overpowered the blueberrie..and normally I love the two together.  I thought the glaze was a bit confused.  I guess if I were to make it again, I would leave off the glaze and cut back on the lemon...but I really don't think I'll be making this again...it was really just so-so.

Most definatly not my favorite.  Maybe it would be better without the lemon glaze overtop.  It was too crumbly and lemony for me.

Very easy to make. I doubled the recipe without any problems. I made this to take to the cabin; so I didnt glaze it to make it easier to transport and it was still delicious!!!

I enjoyed this recipe a lot. It is moist enough, and the lemon and blueberry taste great together. I added a little more lemon than the recipe called for. I had frozen blackberries and blueberries and it still tasted really good. The only problem was when I took it out of the pan it became all crumbly, and fell apart. Proably something I did.

I am so dissappointed!!!! I love lemon but this is overkill! First its so dense. Its as if something is missing from this recipe. There is nothing fluffy about this recipe. Its more like a failed recipe that never rose. It was moist (I premixed and baked it in a bread machine) but the flavor is so over powering with lemon. Too Much of a good thing! I halfed the lemon zest and its still too much, with the whole amount I can't imagine how bitter it must be. There are MUCH better recipes on this site.

This is good, but not as moist as I had hoped.  Also, I used bottled lemon juice and the taste was fine.  Next time I will try the glaze with regular sugar.  Also, I had no problem getting it out of the pan.

Unfortunately I didn't have any blueberries but decided to try this recipe anyway. Aside from leaving out the blueberries, I used 1/2 cup of coconut in place of the walnuts (my husband likes coconut better), added a tbsp of poppy seeds, and also an additional tbsp of fresh lemon juice to the batter. (I used the zest from two lemons and the juice from one lemon) It took 70 minutes to bake. I had no problems at all with it sticking to the pan. It was so good this way, but I still can't wait to try it with the blueberries next time.

If it sticks in the pan some, let it cool a little longer.  This recipe is worth it, delicious! As long as fresh blueberries are in season, I'll be making it! Done it with fresh lemon w/zest & bottled lemon w/no zest & it's delicious both ways.  We love the crunchy sugar topping, though some might prefer the standard confect. sugar glaze. Yummy!

Did not care for this one. The bread completely broke apart when I turned it out, and it was too dense. It did have a nice flavor, but I won't make this one again.

I used a pint of blueberries and used a lemon and powdered sugar glaze.  The bread broke a bit when I removed it from the pan, but it sure did taste good! Very moist, and I love moist!  It is however a little bit too dense I think, makes it kind of heavy.  I think I may try combining this with a lighter-textured recipe, to try to get the moistness and flavor of this recipe with the lighter feel of a cake, and maybe do it in a bundt.

I had some extra blueberries on hand and followed this recipe exactly as written.  The only problem that I had was that a little of the bread stuck in the bottom of my pan.  It didn't matter though, we ate it anyway and liked it very much.

This is a great recipe!  I definitely plan to make it again.  I omitted the walnuts and it was delicious.  My only problem was the glaze - the list of ingredients calls for 1/4 cup sugar and the directions refer to 1/2 cup.  I just kept adding more little by little and it was really runny.  Tastes great, though!  Thank you!

Delicious and easy! I didn't melt the butter. My bad... but it didn't matter. I will make a glaze out of powdered sugar/lemon next time. White sugar glaze stays crusty/crumbily even when you put it on right out of the oven. It tastes fine, just not my favorite. I'll make it again. Thanx!

This was a very good bread but no one was a big fan of the walnuts. I thought they were okay but the nutty flavor was really brought out against the lemony flavor of the bread. I would make it again but without the walnuts.

I followed this recipe and I must admit I found it a little bit bitter. However, I did not make the glaze at the end, so that may account for it. Still, if I were to make it again I would add more sugar and maybe take out some of the lemon zest.

Very good.  I used 1c of canned blueberries from Trader Joe's.  For the topping I used about 1T and 1t of lemon juice.

I made this for my aunts, and they loved it. They didn't even realize that I'd done some (a bit strange)experimenting. I used firm, no fat tofu that had been frozen and blended in place of the fat. I didn't have lemon zest, so I added a little extra juice (maybe 1/8 t. or so). I baked it in a 9 inch cake pan and just kept my eye on it to see when it was done. Anyway, after all of this weirdness, I got a really lovely bread! It was spongy and soft and lemony. Once in awhile, experiments work out I guess. :0)

I was surprised by how moist this bread got considering that there's no oil in it - super moist! I didn't have lemon, but it came out beautiful just the same. I honestly made this because of how everyone complimented the smell as it baked. Everyone was right! You just can't wait to eat it! The only thing I would maybe add is more berries, and different kinds of berries (raspberries or cranberries).
