I found this recipe to be a healthier alternative to the typical chicken pot pie. This recipe is very time efficient as it is to make and is practically fool-proof. I, however, added some baby spinach (about 2 cups for added greens) as well as 2 cups of mixed veggies with a cup of whole grain noodles for added value. 

Definitely recommended!

This was a very simply recipe, except instead of frozen vegetables, I substituted one can of sliced carrots and some freshly chopped celery and fresh garlic. I also added some pepper. Came out nicely!

Great recipe.  I altered by adding bread crumbs tossed in melted butter to the top.  I still cooked it uncovered for the recommended time.  It was great...my entire family really enjoyed it.  Quick and easy and perfect for turkey leftovers.

This recipe was easy to prepare but I wasn't crazy about the taste. It was rather bland and boring. I left out the celery seed (because I didn't have any) and I added some seasoning salt and pepper.  It does taste similar to turkey pot pie, but having a crust would make it much better.

This was an ok casserole.  The family liked it.  I added cheese on top.  I used left over turkey from the holidays.  I agree the onions tasted too raw.  I think we would have enjoyed it better over rice.

I like the recipe- but I would saute the onions first- they tasted raw in the casserole and I made noodles to mix in and it was much better!!!

This was easy and yummy but the cook time was way off. I did cook the onion beforehand but all the vegetables should be cooked ahead of time, too. My hungry toddler was not too happy about waiting an extra 30 minutes for dinner as it took an hour for everything to be heated and cooked through. I even increased the temp to 375 for the last 20 minutes. We threw in some leftover wild rice and mushrooms and put French fried onions on the top. The long awaited end result was pretty good.

This was a great dish for me. I am not a Turkey fan at all. This dish helped me to gobble down all the left over turkey.  Thank you.

Your recipe didn't come out the way I thought it would.  Maybe the vegetables took over the taste of it, but thank you for making this recipe available to all of us.
