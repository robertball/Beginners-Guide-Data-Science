Made this "unhealthy" because that's the way I cook :) 7 large eggs instead of 1 1/2 cup of substitute, pork sausage (one pack of breakfast sausages, casing removed). Turned out great. Served it at my 3 year old's birthday. One without peppers and one with. Side note: 16 oz of Cottage Cheese equaled 2 cups.

A great casserole for breakfast!  If you let it stand at the end as suggested it cuts into squares very nicely.  Nice taste and texture.  Next time I will make it in 2 casseroles - one for adults (with the green peppers and chiles) and one without (for the kids).  Would make a beautiful company breakfast dish or for a function - church brunch, baby shower, etc.

I've made this recipe with and without the sausage. It's great either way. I assemble it the night before and cook it the following morning.

Eggcellent recipe!  I don't use anything artificial so I used real eggs.  Also, the only thing differently I did was use all regular ingredients - not low-fat varieties.  Although I may try this even though those things aren't in my house. I used Italian sausage (looked like bratwurst because I thought it would be easier and more cost efficient.  My hubby didn't realize the casing was supposed to come off, and it really didn't make any difference to have them cooked in there.  I added a few shakes of red pepper flakes and some pepper, otherwise exactly as written.  My kids also loved this.

This was a hard dish to rate. If I could, I would give it a 3-1/2 stars. It's low in fat even with a double serving. But I'm very glad I added extra spices to the mixture or it would have been unreasonably bland, as so many recipes here are. I was concerned about having everything mixed together, but it worked out pretty good. I did layer the ingredients somewhat: sausage, onion and green pepper mix first, cottage and cheddar cheeses, then a mixture of the egg substitute, baking mix, milk and spices over the rest. For spices, I added oregano, basil, pepper, garlic powder and dried parsley. I'm not exactly sure what could have made this better, but I think it can be.

Fantastic!  Allowed me to stick with my weight watchers diet even at Mother's Day brunch.  I was skeptical of the cottage cheese and wanted to put it in the food processor, but recipe is great as is.  Used 2% cheddar to lighten fat even more.  Make sure you really chop up the turkey sausage as you brown it as it tends to clump.  Paired it with Asparagas and Chicken Crepes from this website as well as Cheese Danish recipe.  Crowd Pleasers!

This was quite good...I used turkey breakfast sausage because that is what I had.  It has a really great texture, which is unusual for something that uses all low-fat ingredients.

Oh my goodness!! This was the hit of our Christmas brunch. It saved the day! In fact it was the hit of the day, the one thing that everyone in the family could agree on. Salsa (or tomato) and avacado add color to this wonderful recipe. This is a must for any meal. Enjoy, you can not go wrong!

I made this for Christmas morning and everyone loved it!  My husband is leery of any "low-fat" type recipe, so I did not tell him what the ingredient were and he gobbled it up.  We had a few leftover squares and heated them up the next morning and I think it was even better.  My only question is, I wonder if it can be made up ahead of time, and then just popped into the oven the next morning?

I had to google egg substitute because I don't keep that on hand. I found out that it's mostly egg whites. What I did was use 8 egg whites, two full eggs to make 1 1/2 cups. I used my own homemade baking mix in this casserole and because I wanted a richer flavor in this casserole, I used a cup of fat free evaporated milk. Because we don't care for green peppers, I used one red pepper. I made this casserole in my cast iron skillet, I just browned the sausage in the skillet and drained it, added a tablespoon each of butter and extra virgin olive oil, then threw in the red pepper and onion and sauteed it just a bit before adding the other ingredients. This baked up beautifully--it really looked like an omelette. PERFECT to make in the cast iron skillet--it goes right from stovetop to hot oven. I think this will be a repeater but next time I'd cut back the cottage cheese/cheese a bit and add some more vegetables and a few spices next time.

WOW! WOW! WOW! I was leary like the others, but I am a believer now! 
I had to use some items left over so I bit & pieced this but here is what I used...I used 6 real eggs and some egg white susbstitute that I had left over. For the onions- 1/2 white and 1/2 purple. I used 3/4 cup whole milk and 1/4 whole whipping cream. I cut up two pieces of bacon (I had left over) and used chicken sausage-mozzerella links(from Sam's). I had a red bell pepper so that went in instead of green. I also needed to use my home-grown basil, so three leaves chopped.  The cottage cheese I had was fat free. Last change, I added 6-8 shakes of "old bay seasoning'. I used the bisquick, cheese, and chilies as directed... and Holy moly, I had to walk away! Not too hot, not too eggy, couldn't tell there was bisquick in it, and scrump-dilly-umptious!

I made the full fat version of this to take to a brunch type function today and it was very well received.  As stated, when it sits for a few minutes, it cuts into nice pieces.  In San Antonio, we like spicy things, so I made it with the hot turkey Italian sausage, and it was just right for us!  I liked this better than the breakfast casseroles that use bread cubes because you're not aware of the bread in the dish.  It has a consistency similar to a quiche, but lighter, and with no crust.  Thanks!  I will make it again.

Excellent protein filled breakfast! I make it, cut it into 12 pieces and separate on a cookie sheet and freeze, then store them in sandwich bags in the freezer. I take it out the night before and let it defrost in my fridge so I have a quick and healthy breakfast on a cold morning.

This is great!

I used a mix of real eggs and egg substitute, and used turkey breakfast sausage instead of Italian-style sausage, but otherwise made it exactly as written.  It turned out wonderfully!   Fluffy and flavorful. And leftovers served as tasty, easy microwave breakfasts for several days.

The recipe meets all of the requirements to go into regular use in our household -- it's delicious, has good nutrition without tons of calories, and it's both easy and inexpensive to make.  I also suspect it will lend itself well to variation; I'm planning to make a version with spinach and mushrooms this weekend.

I'm far from a expert cook, so I have to admit I was a little freaked out about the idea of mixing every ingredient together without layers.  The mixture was gooey and running--I thought it would never turn out right.  But I was way wrong! Once cooked, the texture is perfect! Not mushy at all. Delicious! LOVE IT!

My husband and I substituted the egg substitute with 6 whole eggs & red pepper for the green pepper and it was one of the best breakfast casseroles we have ever prepared with little or no effort. We received rave reviews from our overnight guests! We will definitely serve this one again!

I halved the recipe for my husband and I, and used 8 Jimmy Dean precooked sausage links since I had them on hand. Taking note of some reviews mentioning a lack of flavor, I used the entire can of diced green chiles, some dashes of hot sauce and added salt and pepper when sauteeing the onion and green bell pepper. It was still a wee bit bland at the end, but nothing a little extra salt wouldn't fix. I was able to make this the night before and cook it as called for in the morning. Easy to make and tasty. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great, low-calorie recipe - even my family (who had no idea it was low-cal) said it was a "keeper"!  I'm on Weight Watchers and it figures out to just 5 Points Plus per serving...  I followed the instructions exactly, except I used a 7-ounce can of chopped green chiles because that's all I had (I can never have too many green chiles...).  You DEFINITELY want to be sure it's thoroughly cooked because that egg substitute can be pretty runny, and it's very important to let it set for the full 10 minutes after removing from the oven.  Tastes great as leftovers the next day too!

I made this for Christmas morning breakfast.  OMG!  Followed recipe exactly, except I used real eggs and 1% milk b/c it was what I had on  hand.  Also, I substituted jalapeno cheddar because I was out of regular and left out the green chiles.  Everyone said it was the best breakfast casserole they had ever had.

This was a good breakfast casserole. I was hesitant about the cottage cheese, and this is a food that I have never been able to force myself to eat, but it worked perfectly in this dish. It gave it a fluffy consistency and you couldn't really taste it. The only slight changes I made were to sub out soy sausage (vegetarian) and almond milk for regular. Also, I ended up not stirring the cheddar in and instead shredded about half that amount over the top, which cooked up to a nice golden color and gave the top a pretty coating. I could not tell that the baking mix was even in there. With these couple of changes, it was still very good, and even lower in fat/calories! I will def make again, and might experiment with different cheeses and/or veggies. Good as is, and also looks like it has a lot of possibility for variations so that it can be made frequently!

Good.  My only suggestion is to make sure you use breakfast sausage.  I used italian since that is all I had, but I think that a good maple sausage would be best.

I brought in the rest of the left overs to the office where I work and ppl were actually rushing to the kitchen this morning to get more for breakfast!!!  I cant wait to make this the next time I have company!!!!

The family loved this one.  I omitted the green pepper, as a few members don't care for them. I really enjoyed the addition of the green chiles, as I am a huge fan of the flavor they add.  This was a great addition to our Sunday brunch.

I have to admit, I didn't go totally healthy...I used reduced fat or regular products instead of fat free, and boy was this perfect.  I made it for a Mothers Day brunch and both moms were raving. It was easy to put together ahead of time and than I put it in the oven when they got there.   I gave it only 4 stars because the timing was off...and that was probably because I didn't use the 'healthier alternative'. I cooked it for 50 minutes and it probably could have used a couple more.    But the taste was wonderful...I might even use the spicy sausage next time for more zip.

While I haven't made this yet, I rate it 5 stars because I've cooked long enough to know potential when I see it.  I know already that I will follow the advice of ilovetocookyummyfood and make this a little less healthy with the use of real eggs.  Thank you for this recipe.  I make food for lots of people (paid) and I'm always happy to see a new twist on classics.

Incredible!! My signifigant other was so impressed with the brunch dish he suggested I make it for all of our friends and family when they come into town! Variations: 7 eggs-instend of egg substitute. Lite Pork sausage- instead of turky links. I added 6 pieces crumbled bacon. Sour cream is a great side condiment for dipping.

I made this for Christmas breakfast; prepped the night before and popped it into the oven Christmas morning. I made the following changes: I used 7 eggs. HOT Jimmy Dean sausage, 1 orange pepper, 2 cups of Mexican mixed shredded cheese mix and regular Bisquick; definitely NOT non fat. This was a huge hit!! Will try the original version to see the difference. I will definitely be making this again!!

Made this for Thanksgiving brunch and everyone loved it. I only had a few ounces of maple sausage so I added that and a pound of cooked, crumbled bacon. It was a hit.

OK, so this totally sounded like a weird recipe to me with the cottage cheese but I thought I would try it for Christmas breakfast.  It was sooo good!  Easy to put together and it came out nice and cheesy.  Great for company!

Yucky texture. Green chiles only made a funny flavor. Won't make again.

Nice change from typical quiche. Also, not as soft as egg dishes that contain bread that is soaked in the egg mixture overnight. These I find to possess an almost unpleasant undercooked egg type texture, very mushy. I did use turkey breakfast sausage in place of Italian, 7 eggs in place of egg substitute, omitted the green pepper. Every one thoroughly enjoyed!

I used a gluten-free biscuit mix and did not add the green chilies, but aside from this stuck to the ingredients.  This was okay, not phenomenal.  If I were to do it again, I'd use less biscuit mix (maybe 1/2 cup), to make it less cake-y and more egg-ish (if that makes any sense).

Lovely recipe! I changed a few things, though. (I didn't have all that was needed so I used this recipe as a base.) I used a pound of pork sausage, 1 small onion, 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese, 8 eggs, 1/2 cup of 2% milk, 2 heaping tablespoons of chopped tomatoes with cilantro and lime (canned), 2 cups of shredded cheese and a tube of crescent dinner rolls. I took the rolls, formed them to the bottom of the pan and baked for about 6 minutes. I cooked the sausage and onion together, then I mixed the rest of the ingredients together (using only 1/2 cup of cheese, saving the rest for the top.) I baked for about 30 minutes, topped with remaining cheese and then tossed back in the oven until cheese was the way I liked it (gooey and slightly browned.) It was delish! I'll see if I can put up a picture later.

Was a great Christmas morning brunch. I made it the night before and refrigerated it and it took about 1hr 20min to cook since it was cold. I always doubled the amount of eggs.

I made this dish for my family for Christmas morning brunch and it was a big hit. It has just the right amount of heat from the chillies to make it special

Even my kids loved it.  I used turkey and seasoned it with a sausage recipe somewhere on this site (sorry, couldn't find) and real eggs - I used 8.  Turned out great in 40 min and probably made about 8 servings for dinner with a side of toasts and fruit.

Great recipe! I'll admit I did not buy low fat items. I made this with half sweet Italian and half hot Italian sausage it was delicious and not a crumb left. I made it the night before and just baked it in the morning because of that I had to increase the baking time.

Not bad.  It was a bit mushy, which bf wasn't a fan of--maybe bc we reheated it?  When I ate a piece after cooking, it wasn't mushy.  I thought it was a decent breakfast--good thing, since it appears I will have it for breakfast at work this week!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was enjoyed by my whole family.  We are only 4 people, so I cut the recipe in half, but forgot to reduce the size of the baking pan (oops!) so I ended up mixing a couple more eggs with a 1/4 cup each of milk and baking mix, and it turned out fine.  My daughter thought it was a tad bit dry so she topped it with salsa and proclaimed it then to be perfect!!

Wow, this was really good.  I've just discovered the fun in cooking, and I changed a few things up from this recipe.  I used "old fashioned" sausage because it was all I had.  I used 7 eggs, 1 cup cheddar and 1 cup pepperjack, added some mushrooms instead of the chilies, and used the skim milk and Heart Smart Bisquick.  I also used red, orange and yellow peppers with the onions because that's what I had on hand as well, then threw in a dash of salt and pepper. Delicious dish!  I'll make it for several events, but next time I'll try it with the turkey sausage and egg substitute just for the healthy eating aspect.

WOW! the kids and my husband went back for seconds! thats a five in my book! This recipe was tasty. I added some pepper, Northwood Seasoning from Penzey's Spices, and a little bit of seasoning salt. It was nice to know that my family was eating something that was tasty and good for them at the same time.

Followed the recipe exact except used real eggs instead of egg beaters. I didn't care for the texture or the taste. I used reduced fat bisquick which I think gave it a very sour taste, also I didn't use small curd cottage cheese so you could see big chunks of cottage cheese which looked very bad.

This turned out wonderful! I did use 7 regular eggs in place of the egg substitute and even added a bag of spinach (gave it the best flavor). I will use this recipe many times in the future. Quite enjoyable!

This recipe is so great because you can throw in whatever filling ingredients you want - veggies, meats, cheeses - and it works. And because it’s so much protein, it’s filling.

This turned out terrible.  I have been making items with reduced-fat and using fat-free milk.  Everything I have made with these items turns out terrible.  I followed the recipe exactly with one exception.  I didn't have reduced fat biscuit mix, so I used the regular.  You know, this probably would be good using real ingredients.  Fat free milk should be displayed in the store right next to the water.  Life is too short to make recipes like this.  I am very close to deciding to stop making low cal items since I end up throwing them away.
