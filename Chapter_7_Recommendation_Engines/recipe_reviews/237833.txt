I've never had Cao Lau before, so I pulled up recipes on the internet to see what it was supposed to look like when brought to the table.  Every recipe had sliced pork instead of cubed, so I sliced it thinly, and every recipe had either a slice or wedge of fresh lime to squeeze over the bowl.  I had everything on hand for this recipe except the thick Vietnamese style rice noodles, so I substituted thick spaghetti (Barilla).  When the pork came out of the fridge, it had soaked up every little bit of the marinade, but its flavor was fantastic.  On the downside, the single thing that suffered most in this recipe was that it was dry, but I think that's an easy fix.  What I'll try next time is doubling the marinade and adding some pork or chicken broth to the saut√©ed pork to ramp up the moisture level; probably will add more herbs, too.  Other than the dryness issue, I have no complaints (hubby thought there was too much pasta).  We liked it, we ate it, and I'll try again with a few tweaks to suit our tastes.

This dish is served with a fish sauce over the noodles topped with raw veggies.  Mint is a nice touch to fresh greens.  Also have had it with slivered carrot and maybe white radish?.  Can you recommend a brand of fish sauce light and fresh tasting, and the marinaded carrot/crisp white veggie mix?

I had to add a lot of soy sauce at the end to increase flavor.  I would also use broccoli instead of lettuce if I make this again.
