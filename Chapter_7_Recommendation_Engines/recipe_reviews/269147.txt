Served this up on slider buns and this was good. I ended up adding an additional cup of cheddar after tasting it. I think it needs it. Not only for the flavor but for the consistency too. Overall great recipe, super easy, and one I would make again.

I made this exactly according to directions and I thought it was okay. The chicken was still a little frozen so I pressure cooked for 25 minutes. The chicken turned out perfectly and after stirring the liquid with the shredded chicken for a few minutes everything came together nicely.

When serving I topped the chicken with some fresh Pico de Gallo and that made the flavors really pop. Otherwise it would have been a bit too creamy for my liking. Delicious dinner and would make again!

This recipe was amazing. I served it on a slice of keto bread grilled in a skillet. I also doubled the cheddar cheese as others suggested. Crack indeed.

This was such a hit the first time, everyone has been asking for it again!  I did add an extra cup of cheese, as we all like things cheesy and could use the flavor.  The second time I first sautéed a large chopped onion in the instant pot before adding the rest of the ingredients, and this really added a lot to the flavor - just make sure you mix well, or else the “burn” warning will go off.  Still turned out great!  Definitely a keeper!

Served on a slider roll this is not keto friendly but it needs the roll to balance out the rich flavors of the sauce. I omitted the bacon to save calories and followed the recipe as written. Really good on mini rolls served with Cole slaw.

We loved this, but it seemed a bit too salty. I doubled the cheddar cheese as several folks suggested and thinking that may have been part of the problem. Will definitely make it again, but will not double the cheese and see if that fixes the issue. Added a. It more water and a bit of milk (maybe 1/2 cup) to thin out a bit and served it over rice.

Really good.  Made it in my new Instant Pot.  Only 1 issue, My my final product has little lumps of cream cheese.  I did stir it, even used a whisk to try to blend it after the first cook.  How can I get rid of them when I do this recipe again, which I will.

We really liked it and will make it again. I just found it too salty which could be due to the cheddar cheese, the bacon  or the ranch dressing mix I used. Served it over fusilli and it tasted great.

SUPER EASY! I added all the ingredients and cooked on high for 4 hours and then I let it rest in the fridge overnight. I added bacon right before we were ready to eat. DELICIOUS

Made this today using the slow cooker (see notes section) according to the recipe except that I used real bacon bits rather than cooking up bacon myself, and  I added a bit of cayenne and hot sauce.  My husband loved it.   And, I loved it since it was so easy.  Used slow cooker liner, so only had to wash the spoon and and lid.
