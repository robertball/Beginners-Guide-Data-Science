I found this dessert to be pretty good. I think next time I'll use a chocolate crust, and instead of melting hershy kisses, I'll make the chocolate layer with hot fudge ice cream topping.

This pie was really good, however, it didn't belong in a pie crust.  I should have taken other reviewer's advice and used a chocolate crust.  The filling is delicious and the chocolate layer on the bottom is a great idea.  I drizzled the top of the pie with chocolate syrup and sprinkled nuts over the syrup--marvelous!  The only downside was that crust--we aren't eating it, just picking out the filling.  I'll make it again with the chocolate crust.

Wonderful pie! The only glitch was in cutting it - I would recommend running the knife under hot water first, so the bottom (melted/refrigerated kisses)layer can be easily cut. I followed other reviewers' notes and put this in a choc. pie crust and topped it w/choc. chips - have a tall glass of milk handy!

Delish!  I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and lite cool whip and the taste was great!  I also used melted mr.goodbar pieces (just a few) in the crust.  The crunch of the nuts was nice. My only complaint is the pie melted almost right out of the fridge.  Maybe freeze and then serve next time!!?

This pie is fantastic and so easy to make.  My friends crave it and constantly ask me for the recipe or to make for events.  I've used regular graham cracker crust and the Keebler Hershey's chocolate crust.  Both are magnificent!

GREAT and easy too make.  Everyone loved it, even someone who didn't like peanut butter!  Used a chocolate crust and omitted the melted chocolate step. Topped it with grated chocolate. Will be making this again!!

BEST EVER- I have altered it quite a bit with crowd pleasing results- Oreo Pie Crust, Peter pan peanut butter, instead of hershey's kisses, i used hershey chocolate chips, melts easier, no wrappers, less expensive and I drizzle it over the whip cream for a decorative finishing touch. This is the best pie!!!!!!!!!!

This was a great recipe. It was easy and fast. I made it for the fourth of July, and everyone loved it. I used Hershey's HUGS intstead of regular choco kisses, and it looked more elegant when decorating the top. I did not find it too rich at all, but silky and delicious. I will definitely make this again soon!

I have also made this in the 6 oz crust vs the 9oz and you don't have to alter any ingredients. It is also fun to use Peanut Butter Cups or the new Peanut Butter Kisses to decorate the top. This is a great no bake recipe for Summer!

This pie is incredible!  I have made it at least a half dozen times.  It is my pb and chocolate-loving boyfriend's request birthday after birthday.  The best part about this is how easy it is.  I usually substitute Light Cool Whip, Reduced Fat Jif peanut butter, and the 1/3 Less Fat "Neufchâtel" Philly cream cheese and it tastes just as delicious as the more sinful version.  I love how this pie is dense and filling, not too fluffy like some other creamy pies.

This pie was sooo rich and delicious, it's almost like a peanut butter cheesecake.  The only thing I would change is that the chocolate layer on the bottom of the crust tasted good, but was too hard to cut.  Next time I'll either use an oreo crust or just drizzle melted chocolate over the top of the pie.

If you like to eat raw peanut butter cookie dough while you're making cookies, then you'll love this pie!  Instead of Cool Whip, I whipped up a carton of heavy whipping cream, added a little sugar, and guessed how much to add.  Turned out great!  But I don't know if I'd make it again.  It's didn't have a "sophisticated" flare to it.  Was more like something kids would like.

Surprisingly enough, the adults liked this pie, but the kids did not.  Very rich, and You can taste the cream cheese in the filling.  I might add less cream cheese next time, or more peanut butter.

This is pie is delightfully, scrumptious!  Despite the caloric count, the taste is deceivingly light.  I made it for my family and for a potluck at work.  All cry for more....

Very easy but rich and delicious.  I used chocolate shavings instead of kisses to top the pie.

Delicious and very easy to make.  My husband best described it as a "peanut butter cheesecake".  I garnished it with chocolate chips instead of remaining kisses. Everyone loved it!

This was good very sweet, my kisses burnt in the microwave so watch out and when chilled in the pie the melted kisses were hard as a rock.

This pie is wonderful. I made it for my husband's birthday and he loved it. It's a great taste combination of peanut butter, graham crackers, and chocolate. Sweet, but not too much; just right. Thanks for sharing!

I thought I had a sweet tooth. This was way over the top. Sweets normally do not sit long in our house. This lasted a whole week. Too rich for us.

This recipe was the hit of the last office Birthday party.  Everyone loved it. Half of them asked for the recipe! I was worried about the chocolate on the bottom being to hard to cut as one reviewer mentioned, but it was nice an creamy.  A warning, this is VERY rich. You can cut it in even smaller pieces and it will still satisfy everyones sweet tooth. It may seem like there is too much peanut butter mixture but just mound it high in the middle as this makes the pieces look great when cut.
