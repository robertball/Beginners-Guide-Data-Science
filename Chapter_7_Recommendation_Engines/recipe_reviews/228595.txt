Surprisingly tasty!  Didn't have any relish, so subbed in 2 tbsp of lemon juice instead.

I love this!  I have dietary restrictions so I substituted brown rice for the white rice; frozen peas,  low sodium tuna packed in water, vegan mayonnaise and I spiced it up with a bit of organic Old Bay seasoning.  I can't believe how inexpensive, delicious and simple this is.  Thank you for the recipe.

Delicious! Used a brown & wild rice blend and chopped sweet jalape√±os and dill pickle for relish. Very versatile dish - serve plain, on greens or crackers.

I will make again. Instead of tuna I used chicken.
