Definitely tasty, but the mozzarella oozed out of the breading, so it was one big mess. I tossed the whole mess into the marinara sauce and ate it with a fork. Yum, but not finger food.

Delicious! I used seasoned whole wheat breadcrumbs, but that was my only change. I definitely recommend using the toothpicks as it made it so easy to coat the mozzarella sticks without making a big mess.  I should've took them out a minute sooner, but I got distracted (shocking, I know, lol), so that's why they oozed a little, but they were still awesome! I will def be making these again and again, as they make a great healthier snack or side~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

Seriously, I loved this. For a recipe that doesn’t involve using tons of oil to fry in, or wraps like egg roll wraps.... these turned out really good. One change I made was freezing mine for about 15 minutes before broiling. I think chilling mozzarella sticks keeps them together better. I broiled them just until a few started to ooze a little, about 4 1/2 minutes. I really enjoyed them and would definitely make them again.

Made these in a conventional oven with the broiler set to low. 

The breadcrumbs burned almost immediately - they definitely need to be farther than 6" from the broiler.

I basically just made a pan of cheese with some bread crumbs scattered throughout.
