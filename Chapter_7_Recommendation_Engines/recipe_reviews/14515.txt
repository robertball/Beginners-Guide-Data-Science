My husband's family make kabob by omitting the lime juice and marinating the meat in a cup of yogurt mixed with one minced onion.  I also add a pinch of dried mint.  We grill these with onion wedges and tomatoes and serve it with Persian rice.

I used a cheap cut of beef for this recipe and I think it was a mistake. Using a filet would have produced a much more tender result. It was delicious none-the-less.

So *that's* how you marinate it! Second time around, I alternated cherry tomatoes and shallots between the pieces of meat. Getting the extra skewers lead -- counter-intuitively -- to a healthier meal. This is because a skewerful of meat is a deceptively large portion. The additions also improved the presentation and flavor. Next time, I will add some fresh green chilli peppers to the overnight marinade.

Yogurt is an excellent marinade.  My husband was very doubtful, but it turned out wonderfully.  We added some spices to this, cumin, I think.

I made this recipe for a work cook out and it was a hit.  I must say that I had my doubts but wanting to try something new I gave it a shot.When I made the maranade I tasted it and thought that I may have made a mistake choosing this recipe.  Once the meat was cooked it turned out to be one of the best tasting beef dishes that I have ever expericenced!  Give it a try and I hope that you enjoy it as much as my coworkers and I did!

My husband says " give it a 5!"  We really liked this ALOT.  Its amazing the amount of flavor that comes out of these very few, very simple ingredients.

If you can't afford the tenderloin, try mixing these ingredients into ground beef, and making meatballs to bake.  Served with pita bread, and a little tomato/onion relish, we enjoyed this as lunch one day.

This has a wonderful flavor!  The only modification I made was reducing the salt because we are on low sodium diets.  Instead of chopping the onions, I cut them into chunks and added them with the meat to the marinade.  I placed all in a plastic bag, expelled the air, and sealed it.  I placed the onions on the skewers along with other veggies.  Next time I will marinate some vegetables, too!

This was a great recipe!  I made it using ground beef and shaped it around the skewer kind of sausage-like and then grilled it.  I also tried it with ground chicken.  So yummy!

Delicious! Brings back memories of Reza's in Chicago. I marinated big chunks of onions with the beef and added the onion to the kabobs; it was great.

Everyone gave this three stars.  While it wasn't bad because we used a great cut of meat, there are tons of better ways to marinate that taste better. Not a repeat.

This marinade exactly, used with Costco Sirloin strip pack cut up for skewers.  Marinated overnight, followed BBQ'ing time, and our eyeballs fell out.  So juicy and tasty.  We even loved the leftovers a couple of days later.  Amazing.

I loved this recipe, although I added my own twist. Instead of shish kabobs I took two NY strip steaks, marinated them with this recipe with an added clove of garlic. The result was two delicious juicy steaks. Would recommend this recipe to anyone looking for a simple marinade!

Good, but needed more flavor for us. I added greek yogurt, fresh mint and it still needed something? Thanks for sharing!

Thought these came out very well.  I didn't use 2 lbs of meat but ended up using the Tblsp of salt and it was a bit salty but still good.

I made this exactly as written and really enjoyed the flavor!  I also made it once with lower quality meat (I forget if it was New York Strip or Ribeye) and it was still quite good..., but nothing beats Beef Tenderloin if you're looking to spoil yourself.

I love this marinade.  The lime flavor is so nice in the summertime.  I often use half lime and half lemon juice and add a shake or two of habenero sauce to make it spicy.

I became ill and left the beef marinating for almost 40 hours until I could through it on the grill. I was worried that I had ruined the meat but it had amazing flavor. For those who were looking for more flavor....try letting it sit longer. I did use the tenderloin, which I think was an excellent and most suitable choice. Delicious!

This is a very tasty, versatile recipe that is awesome as is, or you can add a little something extra if you are in the mood.  Instead of mincing the onion, try grating it with a box grater into a large bowl.  It's easier than chopping and you don't lose much of the onion juice. Lime (or lemon) juice is necessary to tenderize the meat. DON'T SKIMP ON THE CUT OF BEEF! Beef tenderloin is expensive (same cut that filets are cut from), but the recipe is worth it. Tough cuts of meat are going to make tough kebabs. Serve with sumac, basmati rice and small grilled tomatoes.
