This was a tasty dish mainly because of the honey mustard dressing.  However, I didn't think the bread crumb coating added much to the dish.  Next time I will probably skip this step.  I will also double the amount of honey used in the dressing.

This is an excellent way of preparing salmon: the honey mustard sauce is a delicate complement to the flavor of the salmon.  The sauce is neither too weak nor overpowers the fish.  Also, it seems like the milk tenderizes the fish and mellows out the flavor slightly.  Serve this with some rice pilaf and roasted veggies, and it looks like a very fancy meal without lots of fuss.  Thanks for this recipe!!!  My family has eaten this a few times already and have made sure to save it.

This is easy and tastes wonderful.  Marinating the salmon in milk makes it tender and gives it a wonderful texture.

Best salmon recipe yet!  I used the honey mustard mixture as more of a glaze applying at 15 min. and 20 min. (we like our salmon well done) and it was a wonderful treat!

I tryed this and i'm a person who hates salmon. Me and my sister found it a easy to make and clean up dish.The sauce did taste better with an extra tbsp of honey. Thanks for the recipe i have a total diffrent outlook on salmon now.

I have tried so many salmon marinades and sauces, that I didn't like.  But, this recipe is the BEST!  My entire family enjoyed the salmon, because of the sauce and everyone asked for 2nd's.  Thank you allrecipes.com:)

Wow, I made a wonderful substitution!  I did not have yellow mustard so I used Dijon mustard.  What a great zing flavor!  I was afraid it would be overpowering but it was perfect!  I will make this again for sure.

Salmon is one of my favorite sushi, but I've had it grilled, smoked, baked from restaurants and didn't really care for it until this recipe! So quick and super easy! I found that I had to cook it for about 25-30 mins, but my pieces were thicker. You need a lot more than just 1/4 c bread crumbs, but that's not a big deal. One time I didn't have honey so I substituted brown sugar and I think it came out even better! I'm making this AGAIN tonite. YUM YUM YUM!!

This was a nice change of pace from our normal salmon recipes. I didn't use the egg and had no problem getting the bread crumbs to stick to the salmon.  Definitely use panko for a lighter, crunchier fish.  I cut the butter down to 2 tablespoons (and used light butter) but kept the honey and mustard the same.  If your salmon is on the larger side (or even just wider and thinner), it might not be enough to cover 4 pieces.  Pour the warmed sauce over top of the salmon and put back in the oven for a few minutes. It made for a nice meal (company worthy based on appearances) when served with savory whipped sweet potatoes and green beans with shallots and garlic.

Very nice. There was a reviewer who said the bread crumbs didn't help make the dish - I disagree. While I think it would taste fine without it, my kids really enjoyed the crunchy crust. Nice fish dish!

This is serious salmon.  My 3 yr old at two helpings.  I, of course, cannot follow directions to a T, so I subbed the yellow mustard for Dijon.  Will make again for sure.

This recipe is also really yummy if you don't add mustard to the glaze. I just added a little extra honey and brown sugar and made a sweet glaze. It turned out very well.

I ran across this recipe and had to have it. Unfortunately, I did not have all of the ingredients so I improvised. Instead of breadcrumbs I used of all things crushed rice crispies and I had no milk so I used half and half and I have to say my whole family loved it including my 4 year old twin girls. YUM!

This recipe is a keeper! We really enjoyed it, especially the mustard, honey & butter sauce. I started making it and realized I had no breadcrumbs, so substituted Panko breadcrumbs. It looked a little plain so I added Mrs. Dash Italian blend spice. When served with Alfredo noodles and sweet snap peas it was a perfect meal. We will be making this recipe again very soon!

I made this last night and it was delicious! My husband and I both love salmon, but he's picky about how it's prepared...however, it was a success! I followed the recipe pretty much to a T. The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 was because I felt the bread crumb coating was a little soft (not mushy exactly, but kind of softer than I would have preferred). Next time, I might cook it 5 min longer. Just in case anyone is wondering, I've never made salmon before, but after this successful try I will definitely make it again! I served with "Garlic Mashed Potatoes Secret Recipe" also on this website, and asparagus spears.

Big hit with the husband. He literally gave me a thumbs up. I went really light on the honey-mustard sauce, only preparing about half what the recipe called for and even then just barely drizzling the sauce over the fich with the tines of a fork. I didn't want to overwhelm the salmon. 

I don't often repeat a dish but I could see myself making this again when I don't feel like trying something new.

This is a solid dish - easy, good, & the kids liked it.  I didn't think it was spectacular, but anytime my kids eat fish it's a day for celebration!  I followed the recipe exactly except I baked it for 2 minutes less than suggested.  The fish was moist but still very well done.  I was glad I adjusted the time a bit.

Follow the recipe exactly and the salmon will come out perfectly!  I served the salmon with rice pilaf and steamed broccoli, a perfect combination.  It's a great meal if you have a big exam to prepare for, light and full of omega 3s!

Wow! How easy and delicious. My daughter is a non-seafood eater and after having to beg her to try it, she became a convert. She even asked for the recipe!  Thanks for sharing this delicious, fast meal idea.

This salmon was simply amazing, even my kids liked it.  The honey mustard sauce was great, (we used a spicy brown mustard) and the salmon turned out great.  I would maybe cook it 2 minutes less.

I don't normally send a review, but I made this last night and jsut had to add my 2 cents (5 stars!).  I like my fish well done.  I know that's not thte "proper" way, but jsut my taste.  Often the fish may be dried out.  I cooked this a little longer than suggested and much to my delight and suprise it was well done AND very moist!  I can't wait to try this again.

Absolutely delicious. The honey-mustard sauce is way better than any store bought sauce and is just as (if not) better than restaurant honey-mustard. An absolutely delicious dinner.

WOW! Great recipe.  I've already made this twice and its such a hit.  I also added more honey to the recipe as other readers advised to and it turned out delicous.  Good enough for company. They will think they are dining at a five star restaurant!

This was a very tasty way to prepare the salmon.  We enjoyed the sauce and the toasty coating.  I’d make it again.  No changes were made to the recipe.

This is a good recipe that is quick and easy to make. I thought the sauce was a bit too sweet so I added a little wasabi sauce to it. It was delicious.

Delicious! 
I typically buy salmon of exceptional quality that doesn't need anything on it whatsoever to make it scrumptious, however I rolled the dice and made a 'new' recipe using my 'exceptional quality' salmon and cannot believe how outstanding it turned out. I made it as written, no mods. The sauce is tasty. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe as I WILL make it again.

Absolutely delicious. I made  few changes though. I did not use any milk to soak the salmon as I wanted to make a dairy-free version. In addition, I added some paprika, garlic powder, and salt to the bread crumb mixture before coating the salmon in it. Finally, I had no prepared bread crumbs at home so I toasted a slice of Oat & Honey bread, pulsed it in a food processor, toasted the bread crumbs some more in the oven, and threw it back in the food processor some more. This dish serves great with steamed veggies and rice!

I love making meals with salmon but usually can only find barbecue or lemon herb recipes so this recipe happily caught my eye. I'm glad I tried this quick and easy recipe!!! Would recommend using skinless salmon fillets which I made the mistake of not doing.... Otherwise everything seems to turn out. I used honey mustard and added only a little bit of honey to the butter mixture.

I had a beautiful piece of Atlantic Salmon.  Used this recipe, however made some changes...because of supplies.. 
No breadcrumbs...used organic corn chips flavored..sea salt /pepper...smashed them!
No cheese..skipped this because of the flavoring on the chips.
No mustard....used Ginger! 
Everything else the same! The Ginger rocks!

My family loved this. I had no eggs to coat the salmon and I also doubled the honey . It was delicious.
Update: 
2nd X I made it exactly as written. This is delicious. I served it with sweet carrots and sautéed asparagus .

Bazinga!  My new favorite.  I prepared exactly as directed, except I heated the honey and mustard with the butter in order to make sure I wasn't pouring a cold glaze.  Other than that, I would NOT change a thing.  The bread crumbs and parmesan are important, I believe, as they soak up the yummy honey-mustard glaze. Thank you, Evan!

I'm not a huge fan of salmon but this was excellent. It was easy to prepare and just the right blend of flavors. This will be my salmon recipe of choice from now on.

Really good, mild flavor  I served it atop parmesan rissoto with steamed broccoli.   Very nice upscale dinner, your guests will think it was very difficult... and it wasn't!

Absolutely wonderful recipe! The breading and mustard sauce work so well with the salmon. I have just thrown away all other salmon recipes and will be using this one from now on.

Excellent blueprint for an excellent meal. I modded this slightly by doubling the honey, using Dijon mustard over yellow, and -- I think the real knockout blow here -- using flax meal over bread crumbs. The result is a really unique combination of flavors, textures and color. Will definitely treat a date to this one.

Excellent, was looking for a salmon dish that wasn't the same old lemon pepper or asian style. This really went over well with my family. Definitely add the extra honey and I added a little white wine to the sauce to add some kick to it.
