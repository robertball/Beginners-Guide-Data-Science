This recipe is great as is,  but I did make a few changes that made it even better.  When I was frying the onions, I added hot peppers and cayenne pepper to give it some kick.  After the soup was fully blended and cooked,I also added in pieces of cooked potato.  The potato adds some hardiness to the soup, and makes it much more filling---while maintaining the great curry and zucchini flavor.

I absolutely loved this recipe.  It tastes fantastic, and its easy and quick to make.  Just a note for all those out there who are not veteran soup makers,  be careful when you go to blend it in a blender, let the soup cool for a bit, the steam plus the blending of the soup when it is still hot will blow the lid off the blender... I discovered this the hard way.

For a creamier version try adding fat-free sour cream after blending. Or blended silken tofu (and vegetable stock of course!) for a protien rich vegan version.

Fantastic!!! So delicious and low fat, I absolutely LOVE this soup. I added two tablespoons of curry powder for the extra kick. I also skipped the salt and used veg broth instead. I will make this all the time!

I've never made this EXACTLY by the recipe, but what I did do is double the curry powder, and add a diced sweet potato for more body.  It is REALLY good!  Also try adding a dollop of sour cream when serving.

Family loved it; add a cubed sweet potato, some garlic and red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit.  We collected some of the cubed sweet potatoes prior to blending to add back in later, and added some yogurt as well.  Great stuff!

Being a huge fan of curried pumpkin soup I had to try this recipe. While not as thick and creamy as my favorite curried soup recipe it was very good and I will make it again. The only change I made was to add some whipping cream at the end to thicken it a bit. If you have a hand blender use it! It only took a minute to blend it and there was no mess.

Insanely easy and quick to make.  I didn't give it 5 starts because I thought it needed a little something to make it a little thicker (as per other reviews).  Other than that, it will be in my backpocket when I am in a pinch!

This soup is absolutely delicious! It is very easy to make, and the flavor continues to build after cooking. I will use this recipe again for sure. I have actually written it out 3 times this week for friends! Highly recommended! Low fat, healthy choice, high in flavor.

I had some zucchinis that were on their way out and I needed to use them quickly. I made a few tweaks to this recipe and it was amazing (I'm sure it would've been without changes too though). I didn't have chicken stock so I used 2tbsp of chicken bouillon powder and instead of water I used a can of coconut milk. I also doubled the curry powder and added 4 flags cloves of garlic that I cooked down withthe onion for extra flavor.  The coconut milk made it creamy and balanced out the curry perfectly so it had a nice heat but wasn't overwhelming.  This can be eaten hot or cold and toasted nuts on top give it an added bonus.

This was so easy but I cut the broth in half and as it was a little bitter I added 1 tsp of brown sugar, 1 tbsp of tomato sauce and a sprinkling of chili powder.  Yummy.

This recipe is fantastic.  It's fast, easy and delicious.  I followed the recipe as written and it turned out perfectly.  I used my hand blender once the soup had cooled a bit.  I did follow the suggestion of another reviewer and added a dollop of (non-fat) sour cream in each bowl and it added a creamier texture to the soup.  It's good as it is too.  Thanks for such a quick and easy recipe!

1-23-2016 ~You might not think that a simple combination of zucchini and chicken broth would amount to more than a yawn.  But take those two simple ingredients, add a little onion and curry powder... and you'd probably still anticipate a yawn. Not so!  This was incredible.  Hubs and I had this as part of a simple dinner, but I could also see this as a starter soup for a more elegant dinner.  It's vibrant green color makes for a stunning presentation, and the curry lends a much bolder flavor than you'd expect from a simple zucchini soup, which on its own does not have much flavor. Curry (which is a blend of spices) varies greatly, so it's important you find and use one you like and that is the best your budget allows.

I made this for Christmas. No one complained. I used 10 zuchinni sliced and two onions, no salt, tripled the curry added a dash of black pepper. skipped doing it in steps and boiled everything together in one pot followed by whipping in the blender. Tasty easy recipe! (oh, and I may have tossed in a cup of reisling with the broth now that I think about it)

We really like this soup and the fact that it has so few ingredients makes it even more appealing, but we do prefer it a bit spicier so add some hot pepper flakes and grated fresh ginger (this is to suit our taste buds ).  
Always serve with some Greek yoghurt on top[

Delicious !!!   I sliced the zucchini & yellow squash (which I added extra) very thinly & did not put in the blender.   Added a cup or so of cooked rice & a dollop of sour cream to each serving. It was wonderful.

I have made this soup many times since I discovered the recipe.  When our garden overproduced zucchini, I found that it freezes well also.  It's a great light lunch no matter the weather.

This was good, but I think that next time I will add some brown sugar as was suggested previously. I also used veggie broth and added a bit of yams. It was good, but needed something extra.

Excellent Flavor!  I can not wait to make again for company.  I added carrots to the onion to give it a little more texture.  I love eating soup.  This has become my favorite.

Used vegetable bouillon instead of chicken stock and added a peeled and diced potato. So delicious! Keep it in a pitcher in the fridge and just pour and microwave whenever I want a nice hot bowl of soup. THANK YOU!!

Excellent - and very quick and easy.  Personal taste, added an extra tbl of curry, but otherwise followed recipe.  Really good stuff, though mine did not come out looking as green as the picture (perhaps the extra curry powder).  Also after blending might try adding cooked potato, chicken and carrot to make this a one-pot meal.  Meanwhile, plan to make again soon using vegetable stock for vegan friends. Thanks for the recipe.

Very easy and very tasty.  A great way to use abundant garden zucchini when you've exhausted all the zucchini-bread recipes you can handle.  I was looking for a recipe I could modify to re-create a saffron-courgette soup I had in the UK last summer.  But the curry sounded good, too, so I made half with curry powder and half with saffron.  I love them both!  No need for cream, either - the hand blender gives it a great texture.

incredible--fast, easy, simple, delicious!  the only thing i changed was that i added 1/2c-1c homemade cultured buttermilk made with 1% milk--i knew it would need some added body, but i am a fan of cooking lite, hence the buttermilk instead of cream.  this one is a keeper!

This was a delicious soup with simple flavors and ingredients . . . a great way to use up late summer veggies. I added yellow squash to the zucchini since I had to use it up and it was great. I think I might experiment with melting in goat cheese to add to the creaminess since goat cheese pairs well with curry recipes. Oh, and my boyfriend, who hates zucchini, had thirds!

Delicious soup and very easy to make. I used one big zucchini rather than 4 small ones and found the skin  hard and chewy once I whipped up the soup. If you are using a big zucchini be sure to peel it. I love this soup and will certainly make it again.

Great way to use up leftover frozen  zucchini from the summer garden.  I doubled the curry for this recipe,  and it was a hit.  Great winter soup to warm you up from the inside out.

This turned out great.  Based on other reviews, I doubled the curry powder and added 2 tsp of minced garlic.  Also, instead of a quart of chicken stock, I substituted 4 cups of water with 2 vegetable bouillon cubes (you may want to reduce the bouillon amount a bit if you prefer things a little less salty). The soup turned out flavorful and reasonably thick, with a bit of a kick!

I used summer squash instead of zucchini.  Absolutely delicious!!!!  I grow a garden and always have a lot of squash.  This was a great way to use a lot of it at once.  Seriously.....the best soup I've had in a long time.

NOTE: We substituted veggie broth to make it vegetarian. 
Very good. Simple and reasonably quick. True medium spice level. With another flavor layer it would be 5 star.  I may try adding coconut milk to it... Quality of curry powder is critical. 
UPDATE: On our second try at this recipe we added chili powder. We enjoyed the added spice complexity. We still haven't tried a coconut milk variation.

I used this recipe as a guideline.  I've made it three times, and it's great.  I use 2 zucchinis, added garlic and two diced potatoes.  I use veggie stock cubes if I have them in the freezer, water if I don't.  The potatoes makes it thick and creamy.

I had a few zucchini leftover after making bread, so I decided to try this recipe.  It's so simple yet delicious!   I just added some potatoes to make it a little more hearty.  I blended most of it and left some of the vegetables in pieces to make it a little more chunky.  I'll definitely be making this again!

The idea for this soup is definitely worthy of five stars...but..the cook forgot two very essential ingredients...a few cloves of garlic and a couple torn dried red chilies to be added to the onion and curry powder while sauteing.  This makes the soup absolutely delicious!

If you need to thicken, use instant mashed potato flakes. It's the Zucchini skin that makes it bitter. If you don't like the bitter, peel the zucchini first.

Fantastic recipe! Even though it's almost fat-free, the consistency is so creamy! I added one more tablespoon with curry and 1 chilli, when cooking the vegetables. When the soup was finished, I added some pieces of roasted chicken and 4 roughly chopped tomatoes. And a tiny little dash of light sour cream. My family loved it, and so did I!

This is a nice, light summer soup.
I would make this in the winter but use 1/2 the water to bulk it up a bit.
Next time: 
1 tbsp oil
1 onion 
3 tbsp curry powder
10 small yellow squash
7 cups water
2 tbsp bouillon

I needed a way to use up some zucchinis and this certainly worked!  I decided to use 1/2 stock and 1/2 milk to add to the creaminess.  I also was looking for a soup that would allow me to add some seaweed (just experimenting).  It was a nice addition and I would definitely do it again.

Wasn't too sure what to expect. Just made it. Added 4 cloves of minced garlic to the onion and a carrot. Reduced the (liquid) stock to about 650 ml. Was very tasty and creamy. Hubby who didn't seem keen when i said that was on the menu for dinner now wants me to make it again. Because i reduced the water, only 3 servings. Will be making it again soon, esp since it's so healthy!! Thanx!

My mother in law gave me a huge zucchini, so I used up about 1/3 of it in this recipe.  To be honest, the soup looks kind of unappealing when it's boiling, but once blended, it was absolutely tasty!  The curry gives it a slightly spicy zip which is very pleasant.  I added 1 clove of garlic, and used home made chicken broth.  A bit of cream just before serving gives it an even smoother taste, but it is really not necessary.  Very simple, I will make this again for sure!

AWESOME. Much better than expected. I added 1 small potato, 1 extra zucchini, and 2 cloves of garlic.  Bullion instead of broth. Doesn't need anything else, not even extra curry. I love curry, but the slight undertone allows the vegetables to dominate the flavor... just accentuates the amazingness of nature. Will make again and again and again.

This was pretty darn tasty and healthy to boot!  I used cippolini onions and added more curry powder than called for and topped it off with a spoonful of fat-free yogurt.  This is definitely going to be a stable around my house.

I just made this soup and it was awesome.  I did add 1 close garlic, and 1/2 cup potato flakes and a little more curry powder.  I will be making this one again.  Blanche

Made the recipe as is to start.  Added some more salt and pepper at the very end, as well as some additional curry. It was fantastic served with some cheese on top!

It was good.  I wouldn't go buy zucchini just to make this but I will make and freeze this with the extras from my garden.  I agree with others who said this soup needs more substance.  I thickened it with potato flakes and served with a dollup of yogurt.  There is a lot that can be done with this as a starting point, but as a stand alone soup, for me, it was just okay.

I sautéed potatoes and some more zucchini and added it to the blended soup.  I enjoyed it, but it definitely needs the chunks added after the blending.  Could use some garlic.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!**UPDATE** 5/23/10 This is so delicious! I doubled it, and added an extra tablespoon of curry powder with a smattering of brown sugar.  I grilled some bratwurst and cut it up in the soup.  So good the second time around!  Thanks for sharing.

Using yellow summer squash plus extra curry spice gave the soup a wonderful sunny yellow color!  With sour cream swirled into the soup and a garnish of crushed seasoned croutons, it was very filling too.  A tip I've found helpful:  puree the squash BEFORE adding the broth.  If, like me, you're using a hand blender, this avoids splashes of hot liquid.

Absolutely fantastic.  I also  upped the curry but I'll probably scale back a bit next time.  Added greek yogurt instead of sour cream at the end and it was soooo goooood.  Don't think I'll ever do anything else with zucchini again!

This recipe is really great, quick and easy and it doesn't call for a bunch of ingredients to go out and buy. I'm cooking it for the second time, and this time I am doing a double batch because it only lasted one meal when I last made it. I prefer adding a little bit more curry powder (table spoon or so) and a bit of hot chili pepper sauce. This recipe is great because it is a basic squash soup so you can use pumpkin, yellow squash, or a different kind of squash if you would like.
I highly recommend this!

I make a version of this soup using butter and one large tablespoon of vindaloo or hot curry paste.  It makes a very spicy cold soup, lovely in the summer.  After sauteeing the onions in the butter, add the chopped zucchini and only enough chicken stock to cover. Cook until the zucchini is very soft.  Then puree and add about 2 cups of buttermilk.  This makes a creamy but low-fat summer soup.  Serve chilled.

Zucchini Soup has an amazing consistency and texture about it. It isn't grainy like potato-based soups can be. I find using a white onion is a must and I replaced the curry powder with thyme. My daughter is crazy about it. I add grated cheddar for her. This is a really nice soup. Some reviews suggest adding cream or milk but I prefer it as recommended. It freezes better this way.

This was just ok for us.  Tasted like watery zucchini and curry which is what is I guess but based on the reviews I was expecting something more.  I was disappointed as I love zucchini and curry both but this was just not great.  It was too thin; I added some cornstarch which helped a little.  I also stirred in some sour cream to give it a more creamy flavor.  I don't think I will make it again but for those who try it I would recommend adding a potato or something to give it more substance.  Maybe some other veggies too?  My husband liked it more than me but it didn't get raves from anyone.

I'm still working on using up our garden zucchini, so this recipe came to the rescue.  YUM.  Husband isn't crazy about curry, and yet he also likes this soup!  Made exactly as recipe calls for except adding some fat free sour cream when blending together.  We'll be enjoying this for years to come.  Thanks for a simple-to-make, yet delicious recipe!

I really liked this recipe, although I did add a few things.  I added a few garlic cloves crushed because they go so well with onions and curry.  I also added six or seven garden fresh tomatoes because they are as abundant in my garden as the zucchini.  Before I pureed the soup I drained a little of the liquid off because I like a thicker soup.  It turned out perfect and delicious.  I considered putting sour cream in it for a creamier soup, but it doesn't need it.

I added two cloves of garlic since (in my opinion) everything is better with garlic.    Half of the recipe I froze for another meal. I will make this again as it's a great way to use all that prolific zucchini in the garden.

So simple and healthy! I think it would be delicious over rice too. The only change I made was that instead of chicken broth I used “Better than Bouillon” brand vegetarian “not chicken” base. I will definitely be making this again.

Great recipe! Very easy to prepare and very tasty. I cut the recipe in half, and the only thing I added was a small pinch of red pepper flakes because I like heat. I used grated zucchini instead if slicing it as described in the recipe.

I loved this recipe. I double the batch and used it for lunches for 6 days. I added garlic, turmeric, and chick peas. The chick peas make it more hearty and help for a full meal instead of as a side!

This is a good way to use up a lot of zucchini.  I fried 3 slices of bacon, then used the bacon fat instead of olive oil and used the crumbled bacon for garnish. I don't eat junk food or fast food or sweets, so a little bit of bacon won't wreck my health.   Added a couple cloves of garlic with the onion.  Very good soup.

A very good soup, can be served either hot or cold.  It can be a little thin, so adding cubed new potatoes or sweet potatoes with the broth is a good idea, unless you really want to keep it totally low cal.  If adding sweet potato (1 is enough) substitute a can of unsweetened coconut milk for some of the broth.  WOW!  Also, really needs 2 T of curry, not just 1 T.

This is amazing!  I did add a small sweet potato after reading some of the reviews.  It was so easy to make.  The first serving I ate plain, 2nd one I added some cannelllini beans, third time a few pieces of ham.  You could anything to this soup or just leave it plain.  So good.  And I think it tasted better the 2nd and 3rd day.  I'm going to make it without the potato next time.  Might add cauliflower....The possibilities are endless!  Love Love Love!!!

Made it with about double the curry and 1/4 tsp of cayenne as recommended by a previous reviewer, but that was a bit too spicy to really enjoy the other flavors. Might cut it back on the cayenne to just a dash/pinch. This is the first zucchini dish that I actually like!

Used Tandoori curry powder, surprised how creamy the soup is without any cream.

My first time ever trying curried zucchini soup and boy did everyone enjoyed it. I took advice from others and included red crushed pepper and cayenne pepper to the onion while it was frying. I also included green bell peppers. I omitted the broth and used plain water instead and added more seasoning such as adobe and garlic. I noticed for my preference it wasn't think enough so I added a large zucchini, uncooked in the blender mixed with the cook ones. It thickened it instantly.  I diced up some potatoes after I blended everything and placed it back in a pot and included the uncooked potatoes and allowed for another 30 minutes on the stove cooking. Potatoes were nicely cooked. Sprinkled some parmesan cheese on top for serving and it was Delish!

I didn't totally love this. I found it a little too thin for my tastes and a little bland.  I will pump up this recipe with more zucchini and MORE garlic (we love garlic).

I love this site! I totally swayed from this recipe. I used 7 store bought zucchini, partially peeled, and diced. Sautéed first the onion, olive oil, garlic, spices (my ideal blend of red pepper flakes, cumin, ginger, turmeric, ground mustard, salt, pepper). Then added the zucchini, a handful of shredded carrots and two small red potatoes quartered, along w a qrt or chicken broth and 1/4 cup coconut milk. Simmer 15 mins. 
Add shredded chicken if desired. Blend all ingredients w immersion blender. Transfer to Tupperware for future meals. Serve w bread or sour cream for heartiness.

Thought this was excellent. It is surprisingly creamy without any milk or cream. Sautéed sliced carrot (about 1/2 cup) with a lg chopped onion first in butter and olive oil. Then, added sliced zucchini (after halving lengthwise) and two cloves of chopped garlic with curry (1 heaping tsp) and s&p, and continued to cook until all were tender. Added about 4 cups of stock and had at a low boil for about 10 min. Removed from heat and used immersion blender to make smooth before adding chopped leftover turkey. The curry flavor, which can be overpowering sometimes, really makes this soup special. Thanks for the great recipe!

I am cooking this currently and did add some hot peppers and some brown sugar.  It smells very good, but the only suggestion I have is to put actual measurements with the recipe.  4 small zucchini is going to mean something different to every person.  Give me a measurement to gauge things by so that as I put my own twist on things, I have a base from which to start.

Really good flavor, but my batch came out very thin - like a broth more than a soup. I definitely will try it again, but thicken it up more.

Absolutely scrumptious!  I had time, so I let the onions brown for a good long time and added some extra curry powder as I like it strong.  I also used white beans as a thickener.  I feel weird rating a recipe when I change things, but I think everyone tweaks things to their liking at least a little, and I wanted to let everyone know this recipe is a winner.

This is a great simple summer time recipe. Perfect for those extra zucchinis from the garden. I ended up adding several other veggies e.g., carrots, onions, peppers etc. to jazz things up a bit. If you really like curry I would recommend adding more than is specified in the recipe. I found it to be a nice soup with just a hint of curry flavor using the amounts in the recipe.

I added some pre-cut butternut squash and I cooked it up in the morning and put it in the fridge and then blended it and reheated it to serve that evening.  I served this for a dinner party and it was a hit.  They had no idea how easy it was to make.

This was delicate and tasty.  I followed the recipe, but decided that the final product was a little too hot on my tongue.  I love the flavor of curry, but not the heat.  So i tossed in half a cup of sour cream and that took the edge off.  Now I could probably add even more curry!  I used 1/2 tsp of salt.  If you want a little chew in your soup, rice would be a nice addition.

Based on many of the reviews, I made some changes:
I first sautéed chopped onion (two medium), 4 chopped carrots, and 4 chopped celery stalks and 3 pressed cloves of garlic with 3 T curry powder (2 T of Cape curry powder from one of my Indian cookbooks...let me know if anyone wants the recipe for the mix...and 1 T of Maharaja curry powder from Penzeys).  I added 6 chopped zucchini (mostly reasonable size, one was pretty big but no seeds) and cooked until things started to soften. I added 1 quart of chicken stock and simmered another 20 minutes with some chopped cilantro that I had in the freezer.  I blended this with an immersion blender and added a can of coconut milk, juice from half a lemon and 1/4 c dark brown sugar and plenty of salt and pepper to taste.  Now it's in the freezer!  with the other veg, it's not as green as the photo...but has a good flavor.  In the future I might add some white beans for some protein.

Somehow the taste of curry and the sweetness of the zucchini seem to compete against each other instead of complement each other. My boyfriend liked it though... To each his own I guess!

This is a very nice, easy soup.  I had to modify the recipe because I can't have too much spice. 
I cut the curry in half and added one sweet potato to add another veggie.  I really enjoyed it and so did my husband.  I will make it again.

This is a great base recipe, but like others have said it definitely needs some oomph. I used far more curry powder than was called for, probably closer to a quarter cup for 2lbs of zucchini. I also added garlic, parsley, cilantro, lemongrass powder, ginger paste, and a tiny bit of fish sauce, palm sugar, and lime juice. A little bit of chili paste or hot sauce will make heat-lovers happy, but I like this as a somewhat milder, cool summer soup. Will make again!

Everyone loved this soup.  It adds a lot of flavor to zucchini, which is pretty bland on it own.

Delicious. Of course I made a few changes. Away for a week, I went to the garden to find enormous zucchinis. I used two (about 2' long but still sweet) for this recipe. Increased the onions to 6 sweet white onions, added 3 tablespoons of Penzeys sweet curry, 6 seeded, chopped Jalapeños, and minimal low fat, low salt chicken stock - maybe 1 cup just to get the boil going. Result after blend was a rich, spicy, thick, tasty soup. Served with a small dollop of fat free sour cream, the family liked it so much they wanted it for lunch again the next day. A healthy treat that freezes well.

I halved the recipe, used a little less oil than recommended and added a few shakes of cayenne pepper (as recommended in another review I read beforehand).  Followed everything else to a T with some fresh from the market yellow & green zucchini, and the soup came out delicious!

This was a supurb soup.  Nicely spiced with the curry, but not over powered by the curry.  I was very impressed with this.  I would recommend that you use a little more zucchini that the recipe calls for.  The soup will be thicker.

Wonderful! I only used 3 cups of chicken stock so that it wouldn't be as watery and it was perfect! Big hit. My mom told me I could sell it at a restaurant.

I made this recipe today at work, everyone loved it.  It's so simple I didn't think it would be any good but everyone who had it said it was delicious.  Very simple to make, wonder what it would be like with chicken? I like the suggestion to add sour cream--maybe next time.

I made this recipe for my wife and she loved it.  I took the advice of several other reviewers and used 2 tablespoons of Curry powder.  I also used a low sodium chicken broth.  I have to admit that this is one of the best uses that we have found for our over abundance of home grown zucchini's.  This recipe won't disappoint.

This is beyond bland. I even tried the suggestions (coconut milk, brown sugar, added some cinnamon.) Still this could only serve as the base for some other recipe. Bore, bore, bore.

I found it to be sort of bland... sorry =(  I added a few teaspoons of glucomannan powder to thicken it up in the Vitamix (otherwise it'll be lumpy), and some unsweetened almond milk (40 calories a cup; Whole Food's organic brand is best - very creamy). Diced onions is a good addition for some texture. Used a good bit of stevia to sweeten it, along with ground clove, cumin, and tumeric. After all that, it was thick and delicious with practically 0 extra calories. But it was a great idea for me to start =)

This should have gotten top billing on this page for Zucchini recipes...I made this soup yesterday and OH MY!!! I was going to follow it to spec but decided to add more Curry (NEVER a mistake!), a big splash of White Wine, about a 1/2 cup crumbled Goat cheese and around a half can of Coconut Milk. I didn't add other veggies for fear of changing the flavor too much. I blended half of it and added back to the soup and this was just unbelievable! Yes--easy. Yes--out of this world good--a definite keeper! Think I might make a huge batch and can it in pints for storage and Christmas gifts!

This recipe is great, very simple, easy to follow.  I increased the amount of curry powder and garlic.  I added some turmeric and cut the salt.  I also used veggie stock instead of the chicken.  I also added a little cayenne.  I added some leftover mashed potatoes and a sprig of mint upon serving.  It was yummy, nice option for all the zucchini that keeps showing up at my doorstep!!!

I can't believe how good this is. I used a little extra curry from what the recipe stated. Also, to thicken the soup up, slowly add instant potato flakes when blending. You don't need a lot. I used less than 1/4 cup. Made the consistency perfect.

Amazing! I made this for myself for lunch, and talk about amazing! I have a couple of notes for those of you finding the recipe a little watery. Add less chicken stock or simply wait for some of the stock to boil off the zucchini. This way you will get more of a paste when you blend it, after that add in more stock, or in my case coconut almond milk, until you reach the desired consistency. I thought it was amazing and will definitely use it again.

I found this recipe because someone gave me a huge green zucchini & a medium size yellow squash.  I used Better than Boullion vegetable broth & it came out fantastic.  This goes to show you that a large onion, any vegetable & good seasoning can make a satisfying & low fat/calorie soup.

I followed the others' advice and added 2 cloves garlic, green curry paste, 2 carrots, and some greek yogurt when blending. It turned out very yummy and creamy, with a little bit of heat from the curry paste. I love that I can get use out of my ginormous overgrown zucchini!

This is one of my absolute favorite soup recipes.  Very easy and very tasty.  I do add extra curry powder and some red pepper flakes to give it a bit more kick.

Not being a huge fan of curry, I was a bit skeptical at first, but this soup is incredibly yummy and the curry is subtle.  I used "Better Than Boullion" vegetable stock instead of chicken stock and I also added 2 tablespoons of plain greek yogurt when I blended it.  I will definitely make this again!

This soup was very flavorful and creamy. This is extremely surprising due to the fact that there is not a drop of cream in the ingredients. I served this with homemade naan (Indidan garlic flatbread) and it was an instant hit. My pickiest eater has already asked me to make the soup again soon.

This is so fabulous. I use a bunch of overgrown zuchinni from the garden and remove the seeds. Carmelize the onion and zuchinni together until deep brown which gives the soup so much flavor. Yummy!

I needed a quick an easy recipe for the abundance of zucchinis we had from the garden. This soup was so easy to make. We all loved it including my picky kids. My husband said that this is definitely a recipe to keep.

This soup is excellent on it's own, but you can really kick it up a notch by adding a few additions.  I used this recipe for the broth of my soup and then added jalapeno chicken sausage sliced thinly, small cubed potatoes, and more slices of zucchini at the end.  I sauteed the sausage, potatoes, and zucchini for about 10 minutes to cook the sausage and soften the potatoes and zucchini, then just added it to the broth.  My husband and I loved this soup with a few additions.

Absolutely delicious. I used green curry paste instead of powder and gave the soup a spicier taste. Very easy to make and really good. However it is so light that after a while I was hungry again. Next time I do it I will serve it as a starter. Thanks for posting

I have zucchini all over my counter.  Wanted to do a soup and am I glad I picked this one.  It is wonderful.  I think that people who don't like it may have used the wrong kind of curry powder.  There are so many varieties that they should try again with another brand.  Mine was Turkish curry that a friend brought home from Turkey.  It was so wonderful.  I will make again.  Didn't need to add a thing.

I love this.  I often make curried butternut squash soup, and this recipe seemed like a nice summer version of the same kind of thing.  Based on previous reviews, I doubled the curry (paste, not powder) and added a couple of shakes of chili flakes.  It was hot!  But I like hot, so that's fine with me.  I used half zucchini and half summer squash, since that's what I had, and also threw some leftover mashed sweet potato and roast white potato.  And a clove of garlic.  I used homemade chicken stock.  YUM!  Will definitely make again.

Absolutely delicious! I decided to use 2 tablespoons of hot curry paste instead of 1 tablespoon curry powder. If you like Indian food you’ll love this soup. I’ve been trying to be more health conscious and so I used fat-free low sodium broth and it did not lack flavor what-so-ever. Easy, healthy, cheap and delicious… what more could you ask for? Even my boyfriend whose diet usually consists of meat slathered in butter loved it. I will be making this many nights to come.

Very good for as simple as it is. I took another readers advice and added some crushed red pepper, it gave the soup a nice spicy after taste.

I like zucchini and I like curry- and I liked this soup, but it wasn't anything extraordinary.  I love how healthy it is, and it's a decent lunchtime meal.  But it didn't wow me.  I'd make it again with some tweaks- maybe a bit more spice or something.

Maybe I shouldve made it as written instead of making the changes as suggested but we found it bitter and unappealing.  From a family of curry lovers, we didnt even save the leftovers.  Disappointing.

I made the soup base as suggested (without the broth) and then divided it into freezer containers and froze it.  During the winter I thawed it and warmed it, adding the chicken broth.  It was wonderful to eat all winter!  I'm about to make it again with this year's zucchini...they're coming in faster than I can pick them!

Wonderful!  I was nervous about making this as I've never really made anything with curry, but I had a couple of zucchini that I needed to get rid of, and I thought why not?  It was delicious!  My husband loved it, and even a couple of my children tried it and loved it!  Didn't change a thing and will be making this frequently.  Thank you!

A tasty, very light soup.  Added creme fraiche to my husband's but kept mine as written to avoid extra cals and both were nice.  A nice low cal keeper.

This soup is spectacular.  I have made it a half dozen times and love it.  A couple of the times I added sour cream (either blended in or as a dollop on top), which was good, but not essential.

Okay, but it needs something and I'm stumped as to what I could add to make this a 5 star recipe.  The suggestion about adding sour cream is a smart idea - that helped considerably. Thanks for letting me try.

I added 3 cloves of garlic and put in with the onions to cook.  When I combined everything in the blender I added heavy cream to taste.  So, so good!  Highly recommend!

Delicious! Who knew something so simple could be so good? I will definitely make this again. So healthy, too! I did add a few carrots for sweetness, but it may not really be necessary. Also added garlic per someone's suggestion. Also just boiled some onion and used onion powder instead of sauteing in oil to reduce the calories. A++++

I added 2 chopped apples to the onion & curry mixture (idea from a similar recipe I saw) and added some sour cream at the blending stage.  Next time I will add potatoes or rice to make it more hearty.  Overall a healthy and good recipe to keep around during the summer to use up excess zucchini from the garden.

Very good! I tried this recipe this evening. My zucchini is some of the last from my garden and I was impressed by the texture and the flavor. I used Knorr chicken broth cubes. I will definately make this recipe again. Irene from Poulsbo, WA

Very, very nice soup. Relatively simple to prepare. Only change is that I would double the curry next time - personal taste.
Highly recommended!

A very tasty soup, light but so nutritious. I added a small green pepper and used a mix of veggie and chicken stock.

Excellent flavor.  I prefer my soup a bit thicker, so served this over rice. Very easy to make.  Great way to use that out-of-control zucchini!

This turned out quite tasty!  I substituted the curry with cumin and, like another member mentioned, added some garlic - I thought the consistency was just fine, but my zucchini were pretty large, so the extra vegetable could've helped give more substance to the soup.

Excellent Soup!  I added celery & Carrots w/the zucchini and about a teaspoon of cayenne for a kick. . . will definitely be making this again!

The soup really suffers from lack of a flavorful base. I added a couple T. of tomato paste and then a dollop of non fat sour cream in each bowl to jazz it up. I also didn't add as much olive oil since it didn't make a difference the second time I made this. I like extra curry and a pinch of cumin too.

Amazing!  Even my Daughter loved it, although it got a little to spicy for her after a while.  But that is Curry.  If you love curry and are wondering what to do with your zucchini, this rocks! I definitely would put in some sour cream as one reviewer suggested.  I used 1/2 cup of light and it just seemed creamy and rich, without the calories!  Thank you for a great recipe!

Tasty option for excess zucchini!
I also added a squash, cooked the zucchini and squash for 20 minutes, then mashed with potato masher before adding chicken broth.  Also tripled the curry and added a few cloves of garlic.

This soup was super easy and fantastic. I was a little leary about it not having enough flavor with so few ingredients but it was wonderful. Great texture, similar to a bisque. Loved it!

YUM! I doubled the curry (my curry powder might be old, so taste first) and added a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes.  Delicious!  Thank you!

this soup is amazing.  i doubled the curry powder and didn't need to use any sour cream since it was already rich enough!
