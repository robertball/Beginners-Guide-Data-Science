I made this for a themed movie night with my kids and it was a big hit!  I used Sprite and lime flavored sherbet.  The lime sherbet that I found was disappointingly white, so I added a few drops of green food coloring to the brew and it instantly turned it from boring to creepy!  I loved the way it bubbled up and so did my boys!  It was really easy to make such a fun treat for them!
