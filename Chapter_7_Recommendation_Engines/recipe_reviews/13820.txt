Don't be pushed away from this one by those who say that this is not an apple pie for apple pie lovers. It is. The custard makes it less traditional, but it's still fantastic. I made 2 of them for a small dinner party- enough for everyone to have some and some left over, which was greatly appreciated. It got rave reviews. I, like others, also used three apples in each one, plus some apple pie spice with the apples (and more cinnamon) and I also added a little cinnamon to the glaze which added just the right extra touch in my opinion. Try this- you'll love it. Oh- and warm each slices in the microwave about 25-30 seconds. It's so much better that way!

All I have to say about this pie is YUM! The custardy filling and the spiced apples combine to make something so wonderfully delicious, and the plain old pie crust could be a dessert by itself when you add that delicious sugary glaze on top. I highly, highly recommend this recipe. A couple of suggestions: 1) The recipe suggests serving the pie cold, but try it at room temperature, or slightly warm (30 seconds in the microwave should do it) 2) One more apple will add a little thickness, and 3)The thinner your apple slices, the better! Thanks for this recipe!

WONDERFUL!   I'm not a baker but have made this pie many times and it never fails to get rave reviews.  People fight over seconds.  - slice the apples very thin or precook them if you like thick chunks of apple.  Try it with pear and/or peach.  Adding walnut pieces is a nice variation. Use aluminum foil at the end of baking to keep the crust from getting too brown.  A little extra cinnamon or lemon zest in the glaze is good.  (I use an extra deep dish, make a lattice top and extra custard and glaze.)   Make 2 and hide 1 if you want leftovers.  Delicious!

The fillings are good, as is the glaze, hence 3 stars, but they just DO NOT go well together.  I'm with some of the other reviewers.  Use a different filling, I think then it would make a wonderful pie, especially with peaches.  My hubbys favorite is Apple Pie, thats why I gave this recipe a shot.  He said this pie was "O.K. but don't make it again."  I agree with him.  I think it all boiled down to this...... If you are a die hard Apple Pie lover, try another recipe.  If you aren't so much into Apple Pies, then give this one a shot, maybe you will like it.

Thank you so very much for this recipe! I did make a couple of major changes, but this recipe was the inspiration for exactly what I was looking for. First, I made only one crust using whole wheat flour and butter flavor crisco. I made a crumb topping and did not use any glaze. I followed the instructions exactly for the cream . . . sooooo good. I used 3 apples and chopped and saut√©ed them before spreading them on top of the cream. This pie is the best!!

Rat Rod Jess, 
Lactose intolerant may have to add a little more cornstarch with the milk substitute. I've made pudding (not this one though) with soy milk before and it turned out great.

I made this for a few friends I had over for dinner one night.  As I was still serving, one of the guys that just couldn't wait exclaimed "Wow!"  Everyone loved it.  I had a deep dish pie pan, so I doubled the cream sauce and added an extra apple.  I also increased the amount of cinnamon I used--probably about 1 tsp.  Needless to say, wonderful.

I liked this pie.  Not the best apple pie I've ever had but it was good.  That said, I read other reviews and took some advice I wish I hadn't.  I doubled the glaze and it was too much.  The advice I liked was that I used 4 apples, a tad bit more cinnamon and it was good!

A unique pie with a great taste.  Everyone loved it.  Chilling the pie is an important step, don't skip it.  I would love to make this pie again  using cherries instead of apples. mmm...

This is very good. I served it after it had only been in the refrigerator the suggested 1-1/2 hours so it was still warm and I thought it was almost too sweet. After a complete chilling it didn't seem as overpoweringly sweet though. My husband, who doesn't like his apple pie fooled around with said "this is really good," and asked me to make it again. High marks from him means it must be good!

Another 5 stars for this incredible recipe! I was a little apprehensive about making it, since we're apple pie purists in this house. But I really wanted to try it after reading the reviews, and I'm so glad I did; everyone loved it. Refrigeration is the key to keeping the creamy layer separate from the apples. The presentation is just lovely when cut and the taste is a knock-out! My son especially loved the glazed crust and said I should do that with every pie I make from now on. I used 3 very large Granny Smith apples and it baked up impressively high, although I wanted more in the apple layer and will add another apple (for a total of 4) the next time I make it.

This is an awesome recipe, especially paired with the French Pastry Crust recipe. I do skip the glaze step, mostly just because I'm lazy. Another thing I sometimes do is add caramel bits to the cream sauce. I do this before I add the cornstarch mixture. I use those new unwrapped little bb sized caramel bits, about a half a bag, and stir them in until they melt (takes a minute or so), then add the cornstarch. It. Tastes. Heavenly. Every time I make this, I'm asked for the recipe, it is universally loved.

Holy .  This was the best pie.  I just had 2 pieces.  I don't know why I decided to try this.  I don't really like cooked apples, or custard.  But the apples were about to go and I hate wasting food more!  Very slight changes, it's hard to find heavy cream in Canada, so I just used coffee cream, I figured with the cornstarch it would be fine-and it was.  Added an apple, due to so many reviews.  And, you seriously need more than the cinnamon called for-if you want it to resemble apple pie anyway.  I added about 5 tsps cinnamon, some allspice, nutmeg, and a family trick-a tiny tiny tiny amount of clove.  Served cold, if I had any room, I'd waddle back downstairs to get some.

Great recipe! Although, second time through I made a few changes to make it a five star. Although the recipe is great all by itself, I enjoy these changes: Up the cinnamon and add more spices to the filling. I replaced all milk with more cream. Add cinnamon to glaze.

This is the best apple pie you will ever make.  And it is so easy.  I made it and entered it into a pie contest and won 2nd place-$50.00.  I made 4 of them this last week.  You will not be disappointed.

This is a favorite in our home.  My son thinks it's the best apple pie ever!  And that's something coming from the kid (he's now 12) that uses "pie" in some fashion for his e-mail or sign-ons.  My husband is a huge fan as well.

The best apple pie! Although it is not "traditional," it is great!! For those who aren't much of a sweet tooth I wouldn't recommend this recipe. The things that I have changed and will continue to do are: Using 3 or 4 apples compared to 2 and adding at least a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, about a 1/4 cup of brown sugar and about a 1/3 cup of oats to the apple mixture.

I loooooooove this recipe. The only thing I might possibly change is to add a little more apple. This is easy to make and very, very tasty. [Edit: I made this recipe for a baking contest at work, and it won first place! Rave reviews, and most thought it was enticingly different.]

I made this recipe exactly as is, and it was fabulous! Next time the only thing I will change is adding a bit more cinnamon. I used two large apples that had a tart edge to them. The suggestion of warming it up a bit is a good one. It has better flavor at room temperature. I'm making this for a pie contest at work next month. I think it will win!!!

I don't really care for apple pie, however this pie was terrific.  The only change I made was to add a pinch of brown sugar to the apples, but made the recipe EXACTLY as written, was skeptical ( about the fridge, but did it and it does make the differance),  it came out GREAT WITH RAVE REVIEWS FROM GUESTS AND ME. WILL MAKE AGAIN AND AGAIN.

Everyone loved this pie! It‚Äôs a great twist on a classic dish. I used 4 granny smith apples which were just right for the filling.  I added 1 tsp. of cinnamon on the apples and 1tsp. of cinnamon in the glaze. I made a lattice topping and the glaze seeped into the apples‚Ä¶..yummy! I‚Äôm going to try it with a mixed berry topping next!

Good, but not great. I'd recommend taking a piece, smashing it up, and putting it in the microwave. Maybe I wasn't paying attention, but in the fridge?? Didn't make sense to us.

As a breakfast apple pastry, this is good.  As an apple pie, not so much.  Used 4 granny smiths instead of 2, thank goodness, or we would not have known there were apples in there.

This is a pretty good pie.. I used half brown sugar and 3 apples and I used a single pie crust and put the glaze over the apples. The creamy filling is tasty and unusual. But next time I will make more cream filling.

Tasted really good - did not do the intricate lattice top for the pie, but the cream filling was superb.  I also added some fresh peach that I had on hand to make it a little more interesting!

Does anyone think I can make this without heavy cream? I found out recently that I'm lactose intolerant, and they sell Lactaid milk, so i can have that, but I can't have half and half or any other types of cream. I want to make this, but i'm not sure about leaving out the heavy cream.

I'm not a big apple pie fan, but my husband is, and we both LOVED this pie. He took it to work, and a coworker even commented that it "looked professional" HA! The custard went really well with the apples. I tried this both cold and warm and both were great, though warm is better. And because the custard added extra richness, it didn't need ice cream! The only thing I would change is to decrease the sugar in the custard some, but otherwise great. I'll definitely make this again.

Don't get me wrong, I thought this pie turned out looking like a million bucks, and I love apple pie, but this tasted like, well, cold apple pie. Nothing really too special about it. I think I will stick to my standard apple pie and keep serving them hot with vanilla ice cream.

Loved this recipe!!! First time making apple cream pie and I will not be looking for another recipe! We made it yesterday for Pi day (3.14.15) and it was a hit. The only thing I did different was, instead of just simple slits in the top, I made the slits into the Pi symbol :D Bummer we cut it up before I took a picture :( Next year ;)
Thank you!!

It was a hit last night amongst a crowd of thirty-something city-dwelling foodies. I made it with three Granny Smiths, but probably ate half an apple's worth. My fianc√© also ate a lot of the thinly sliced apples, he admitted as we left the party. For tonight's party I will add a fourth apple. I also added nutmeg and a dash of clove. One astute friend with a well developed palate (who secretly had three servings, I noticed) asked if he tasted a bit of nutmeg. I said yep and he gave thumbs-up with a nod of approval. Other adjustments were half white and half brown sugar. I added spices to the glaze, as well. It's my decided recipe for the 2014 Holiday Season. Easy as pie.

I made this for a family get together and everyone raved about this recipe.  I didn't give it 5 stars because while everyone else thought it was wonderful, I thought it was just ok. I'm not sure what I need to do to make it better, and I will make this recipe again, so I may be back to edit this review...

This was very good, I don't care for traditional apple pie and this was a nice spin on it. I used a packaged pie crust for the bottom and latticed puff pastry on the top, it was wonderful and I will definitely be making this again.

This is an amazing recipe. I use more then the apples they call for. I'm even going to try this with peaches, hmmm peaches and cream pie. Yum! Also I put a cinnamon crunchy top to my pie. But with the peaches I think I'll do a white crunchy top.

Great pie! I had to use 4 apples (Granny Smith) to get the filling to a decent height, because they weren't very big, and added a dash each of nutmeg and cloves. I also made my own from-scratch pastry. I served this after Christmas dinner and it was a hit. Just the right degree of sweetness. A bit time-consuming, but well worth it.

This was WAY good and everyone loved it! Just snuck a bite 12 hours later and even better! I used 3 apples and would use at least 5 next time. They do cook down and the pie didn't look full. Easy and beautiful, definitely going on the Christmas menu!

My husband and I both enjoyed this pie very much! I upped the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon and added a 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. I also added extra apples. Maybe 3 or so? Otherwise I followed the directions. Delicious!

Yummy! I used 2 large Granny Smith and 2 small gala apples for this pie. It came out really good. We all really enjoyed this pie. I served it cold but I think it would be better warm. Thanks for the recipe!

I have celiac disease and this pie was very friendly.  I used a pastry crust recipe out of a book that I have, and when the pie calls for flour to dust the apples with, I used Jules Gluten Free Flour Mix.  It seemed that I had to bake it for longer with a gluten free crust, about 45-55 minutes.  However,  I do think that the extra time made the apples softer, the way I like them.  I absolutely loved this pie, and everyone that tried it was begging for a second piece.

I LOVED this recipe! Like many, I made a few changes: more custard (a bit thinner and poured OVER the apples), added a little nutmeg to the flour and cinnamon (before I dusted the apples) and I used a regular pie crust for the top (verses a lattice). Took one pie to work and everyone who had one piece wanted another.  Am baking another one as I type.

Wonderful!!! I made by the recipe the first time, the pie looked slightly concave. But tasted delish. Made it a second time and doubled the custard and added enough apples to make the pie look all full and luscious. Too much cream. So next time i will make the cream as per the recipe and just load it up with the apples.

This recipe was soooo good!  I added 1-1/2 tsp of cinnamon, instead of just 1/4 tsp.  This is a pie I'm adding to my holidays!

Great flavor and texture--someone said it tasted like those little pies you buy at the supermarket with Snoopy on them.  I think that's mainly due to the glaze.  Yummy!

WAYYYY too yummy for words!  I absolutely love this recipe.  It was so simple to make...my 8-year-old made the custard part of the filling.  Hubby loved it so much he requested it for Christmas dinner, and he NEVER asks for anything in particular.  I think, in terms of variation, that you could do this pie either with or without the glaze.  I can imagine using other fruits, too, though I find nothing wrong at all with the combination of apples and filling.  Thank you so much for what will now be a staple in my household! :)

Very good!  The only thing we thought could improve it would be to use a fruit more associated with creams...peaches, strawberries, or blueberries for example.  The apples were excellent...just not quite what you'd expect with that great cream.  We also thought the glaze was very good but not necessary.  Thanks!

I made this for a dinner party last night - I added an additional apple, used a full teaspoon of cinnamon and added about 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg.  I served it chilled, but I did take it out of the refrigerator about 10 minutes before serving to let it warm up just a bit.  My guests absolutely loved it - even my partner thought it was very good and she's not an apple pie fan.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thank you, Kathy!

OHHHH MY! Everyone asked for this recipe!  Wouldn't change one calorie of it, and I can't wait to try it with peaches too! It does take a bit longer to make then claimed, but it was well worth it! Chill it at least 3 hrs! DELICIOUS!!

Very tasty! My friend ate 1/4 of the whole pie in one sitting! I did, however, modify a few things. First of all added a lot more cinnamon, plus threw in some ground nutmeg and allspice. It seems to give it more flavor. It also might help if you lightly grease the pan beforehand, it assists with a clean cut pie piece. Also, depending how many slits you cut or if you make a design in the top layer of pie crust, you might need some more of the glaze you put over it. Refridgeration is a key part (I did mine for 24 hours, it really helps it stick together).

This was very good. The glaze and custard filling added a unique spin to the average apple pie. I used 3 apples instead of 2 and it turned out great.

Love making this pie.  This is a great apple pie that taste delicious cold.  Making the cream requires patience and stirring on low temps.  That way you don't get clumps.  I find the more apples the better, so I usually ad an extra apple or two since they shrink during baking.

This was a very good pie, and relatively quick and easy.  I think it would be a nice summer alternative to "hot apple pie."  I enjoyed it, and will definitely make it again!

The first time I made this, I was very nervous. I am a single guy with some experience in the kitchen; not much with baking - but it turned out perfect.  This year, I made two pies, but I didn't "double" the recipe - I mixed each pie in two separate mixing bowls, and baked them together. This was a perfect recipe again! I kept it very cold, and I caught someone eating it like a pizza! It was very good!

My husband wanted to help me out for Thanksgiving by making a pie.  I found this recipe, and would have passed it by as not traditional enough if not for the reviews.  He made it with two of our granddaughters, and everyone raved.  5 Stars!

I thought it was great. I used 3 granny smith apples and a bit more cinnamon. I chilled it, but we definitely enjoyed it more when it was heated up a bit in the microwave.

Delicious, easy, a new family favorite!  I made the pie by following the  recipe exactly. I will most definitely make this pie again. I did make my own crust which I am sure made my pie taste even better!

Made this tonight, paired with vanilla ice cream, it was perfect :). 

I did have to add more milk to the sugar glaze though, just to make it a little runny. Also did an egg glaze to the pie crust before it baked it :)

Cracked me up to see the folks who won contests with this recipe. I 1st found it in a Pillsbury Bake-Off book, and it was a winner! I will say they used all heavy cream, no milk. Its the best apple pie ever, imo.

Have made 4 of these now and the family likes it better than any apple pie we've ever made.  I've added 6 bits of butter on top of the apples prior to putting on the top crust and it is yummee.

This pie came out great, and the family ate this up for Thanksgiving dessert. I used 3 apples but followed the rest of the recipe exactly and it was really easy to make! I didn't really like the glaze on top, it made it too sweet for me, but everyone else really liked it so I think that came down to personal preference.

This makes for a very elegant apple pie. I followed the recipe exactly, except for addding an extra apple (like others have said make sure to slice the apple VERY THIN).  I loved it and so did my family. The glaze was just wonderful. This is by far my favorite apple pie and I can't wait to try it again.

Amazing! I make a double pie crust with shortening for butter.  The custard is spot on and i use 5 apples bc we love apples in apple pie! Everyone raves about this recipe whenever i make it. Thank u!!

What a great variation! Not your mothers traditional apple pie. Fun to make and a rewarding treat. I prefer it served chilled.

I gave this 4 stars because it was really good but I made a few changes. I added 3 extra apples, more cinnamon and added apple pie spice, added apple pie spice to the glaze and doubled the glaze. The first time I would love to try this with other fruit, like blackberries or raspberries.

Love it! Made as directed and used homemade crust with lattice top. Did not get to serve when I anticipated so it sat in the fridge for 2 days, warmed in a 170 degree oven while eating dinner. It was like a warm apple cinnamon roll that was not too sweet. Perfect!

Truly the best apple pie I have ever had.  Added 3 more apples to the recipe because I like a lot of fruit or filling to my pies.  It was so good.  The creamy filling with the apples are incredible and the glaze on the crust tastes like you just stepped into a bakery and are eating a cinn-a-bun.  Slightly warm is the best way to eat it!

I wasn't bad, but the cream layer needed more seasoning. I was asked for the recipe by one of my guests, so I'm going to assume they liked it. But there were no rave reviews from any other guests.

When I started making this, I never imagined it would taste so good.  I absolutely loved it and won't make traditional apple pie again, when I can make this instead.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used 3 apples.  I think you can even get away with 4 apples to make it a little healthier. Highly recommended.

Wonderful flavor.  The crust got too brown so I needed to have used aluminum foil, used an extra apple.  Turned out perfect.

Yumm, this was sooo good. I made it for my sister's birthday, and she looved it too! I thought it was a really delicious pie, and the custard is soo good! I used 2 large fugi apples, and used evaporated milk instead of cream because that's what I had on hand. Turned out perfect and beautiful! Thanks so much!

Made this for Thanksgiving this year and it was a HUGE hit. Followed the directions exactly. As another reviewer stated, slicing the apples thinly made a difference; they had the texture I was looking for vs. the thicker sliced apples my husband had cut which were crispier than I would have liked.

This is now a "must have" for Thanksgiving every year. Thank you, Kathy!

I took this to Thanksgiving, and even though there were plenty of other desserts, I barely got a piece of this pie before it was gone. Then I made another one a month later just so I could have it all to myself.

This brings a creamy twist to traditional apple pie.  I used three apples and it was absolutely perfect!  I also added apple pie spice in addition to the cinnamon. Wonderful recipe.

This was delicious. My daughter loved it and so did my husband. I used brown sugar instead of white sugar. Once the mixture got thick I gave it a taste and I was in heaven. It reminded me of creamy pudding. Which gave me many new ideas thank you. Tonight I will be using this recipe again but the only thing I will do differently is I will mix cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg and allspice in the mixture. Then once it cools slightly I'm going to fold the apples in the mixture and pour it onto the pie crust, and use egg yolk and cream(egg wash) as a glaze. Thank you again for this creamy filling.

This pie was interesting...it seemed that the cream portion of the pie was absorbed by the apples...I was expecting more creaminess I guess. I added some extra apples too. To me, plain old apple pie tastes better and is less effort.

This was real good but I agree with the idea that this would be better with a fruit more associated with cream like cherries or berries.  I also think it taste better warm.:)

Excellent!! This recipe will be my regular apple pie recipe.  This was my first time trying a cream type apple pie and I now prefer it over the traditional version.  I used 2 granny smith and 2 honecrisp apples.  Otherwise all other ingredients remained the same.

It's super yummy. I had a piece of the pie only letting it sit in the fridge for 2 hours, I had another after letting it sit for 1 day, and today is day 2 and it tastes even better!!! Each day had a different flavor and I loved all of them. I can't stop eating it. The only thing that I did different to the recipe is that I added 2 dashes of clove and 2 dashes of nutmeg to the apple mixture.

I absolutely love this recipe!! I think the tartness of the apples combines wonderfully with the creamy sweetness of the cream and the glaze is not only delicious, but it makes a beautiful pie! The only thing I ever change is the number of apples that go in - I usually use 3-4 but I like my pie appley. If you have a favorite apple pie recipe, this is going to be different - so be warned that is not your average pie. However, I have never really been a huge fan of the standard apple pie and I will make this one every chance I get (and end up eating most of it myself).

This is in the top two of best apple pies I've ever had.  My husband doesn't generally like fruit pies because of the "gel", and he says this is THE BEST apple pie he's ever had.  It's a hit!

This pie was sooo good! I normally don't like fruit pies but the creamy layer makes it special. I'm going to try making it with cherries or peaches instead of apples. Yum!

I've made this pie several times over the years when I came across it on "All Recipes".   It IS an excellent one for sure.  Alterations:  Added one more apple, substituted white sugar for BROWN, INCREASED cream & milk slightly & ADDED a heaping handful of butterscotch chips when taken off the stove to cool.

Very good. Followed directions exactly. I used 2 large granny smith apples and it was fine. 3 might be better, but 2 was fine. I will be making this again, for sure!

We use three large apples per pie. Definitely double or triple the flour/cinnamon mixture and I like to add dashes or a few sprinkles of allspice, nutmeg and a pinch of ginger to that as well. Finally, we add cinnamon to the glaze and this pie is perfect and has been a part of our family Thanksgiving for the last decade.

Wonderful recipe! Snowed in today so I  made this recipe exactly except used 3 Granny Smith apples. Did not have heavy cream so substituted: 3/4 cup milk with 1/4 cup melted butter. Used half of this mixture to substitute for the heavy cream. Came out perfect.  Will definitely make this one again.

This recipe is amazing. Everyone loved it and said it was the best apple pie I have made. This will become our new favorite for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Update: i entered this pie in a auction and it sold for $700.00 the bidder was not disappointed in his purchase.

My twin sister and I entered this pie into a contest we did everything right with the ingredients and the process but unfortunately we lost, we didn't even place 1st through 3rd but  it came out great and tasted amazing! So we have no clue what those judges were tasting but overall this was a great pie and we encourage everyone to try this pie!

I made this pie exactly to the recipe and it was delicious!  In fact, the reason I made it was to enter it in a pie contest/auction at our church.  Out of over 20 pies entered, this one came in second place and brought $85 at the auction, which was raising funds for some much needed equipment upgrades to our sound system.  Thanks to the original creator of this recipe.  I will definitely make it again to enjoy at home.

This will become your new favourite go to apple pie recipe! The combination of the custard like bottom layer combined with the apples gives this pie a wonderful flavour profile. The glazed topping is the "icing on the cake" so to speak! 
This recipe is a real winner! You won't be disappointed

It's it the oven now, and the cream filling was great. Can't wait to try it out. Only thing I did different was instead of pie crust I made a graham cracker crust. I use these cause our family loves the Graham cracker taste, cinnamon and honey mixture in most of my pies.

Super pie-need to make sure custard is cooked/thick enough. Just enough sweet glaze and crunch. No need to sweeten apples. Such wonderful contrasts. Will (have) make over and over. Will maybe try smaller tart size pies.

I have been making this pie for years. I must admit I like it far better with a strawberry filling than the apple filling. Follow recipe for custard. Instead of apples  use,
 1 pint of strawberries halved
1 Tablespoon flour
1 Tablespoon tapioca
1/4 cup sugar
toss together and place over custard. Proceed as recipe suggests. It is delicious!

Made this for Christmas Dinner 2016 and it was extremely easy and everyone enjoyed it. The only differences I did was: (1) added 1 cup of heavy cream instead of the half cup. I didn't have heavy cream so I substituted 3/4 cup of fat free milk, 1/3 cup of melter butter and 1tablespoon of flour to thicken it. (2) I also added a can of apple pie filling as I did not think the called for recipe of 2 apples would be enough.

I have been making this since the mid-90's. Found it on the back of the Pillsbury Pie Crust box (back then they were "folded & not "rolled"--but no matter). It always gets raves & I wanted to make it for Thanksgiving this year. I could not find my recipe & only remembered the ingredients as it has been a while. I'm so thankful I found this online b/c I couldn't find it on my software program for recipes. Anyone who hasn't tried this---you need to. Also, I use Chinese Five Spice powder instead of the cinnamon plus use just a bit of it in the glaze as well.

I made this for my book club and it was a hit with everyone, even the spouses who showed up to sample any leftovers! I increased the number of apples (I had smallish Granny Smiths) to 4, added  more cinnamon to the apples, and also added cinnamon to the glaze. I'll make this again, I'm sure.

For something different, instead of milk in the glaze use white wine. Yummmm.

This is the second time I've made this. The first time, I made it just like the recipe states. This time, I added 3 oz of cream cheese to the custard (I cut into small pieces and mixed into custard until THOROUGHLY integrated) while it was heating. I cooked the pie as stated but chilled it only an hour. The pie was a little warm still when I tried it and it was delicious. It tasted like apple pie with melted vanilla ice cream inside. I will store this pie in the fridge but serve room temp. I think the refrigeration decreases the ability to taste all the flavors.

This was a huge hit!! I followed the advice of chilling the pie thoroughly.  I did add extra cinnamon, and sort of feel like you could add 3 apples instead of 2. But man was this good!! And so simple to make!! Follow the directions. You cant go wrong!

This pie was amazing! I didn't really know what to expect when I started making this pie, it just didn't seem like it would go together and still taste right but I was totally wrong. I made it using the recipe from this site for Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust. The cream that goes in the bottom is absolutely delicious! I want to whip up a batch of that and just eat it by itself. It is so light and creamy and not overly sweet. The apples have just enough cinnamon to give it a little spice without being overwhelming. And the icing that goes on top gives it just enough sweetness. My family went crazy over this pie, it barely lasted two days in my house. It will definitely be making this again!

For a different twist on an old American favorite, this is the go to recipe! The only change I made was using 3 apples. I didn't think 2 was enough and extra cinnamon because I just like cinnamon. This will be made in the near future many times over. Thanks for sharing!

I have to agree with the person that said the two fillings just don't go together. It was ok. My guests didn't care for it. I also agree with another person's rating that peaches might be a better option for topping the cream filling.

I couldn't find my mom's recipe for apple cream pie, which is my absolute favorite, so I searched with the ingredients I had and stumbled across this recipe. Everyone loved it and I've gotten several requests for the holidays! I used 4 large apples, good thing because 2 would have never been enough! I also added extra flour and cinnamon. When I added the apples and cream mixture into the pie crust, I layered it and it came out fab. Will definitely make this again! (my mom's is still my favorite though ;-)

First time I've ever made apple pie. I have never been a big fan of apple anything. This recipe changed my mind! Wow! So good. Couldn't wait to try it so I served it warm with homemade whipped cream on top and it was amazing. Enjoy!

I'm rating this a 5 because it's the best apple pie I've ever had. I did make some changes based on previous reviews. I added a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and cloves to the filling which made it the perfect pie for autumn with the spicy flavors but it overwhelmed the rest of the pie. If I made it again, I think I would omit the cloves and just use a dusting of nutmeg. I might add some real vanilla beans or use egg to make it custard. That cream layer is divine but as I said, it gets lost in the other flavors. I also think I might try this again adding caramel sauce to the filling and drizzling caramel sauce over the top when serving for a sweeter twist. I used 4 small apples and increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp which I do recommend doing. I made my own crust from this site (pie crust IV) which I highly recommend and did a lattice top. I will definitely be using this as my go to apple pie from now on. So many different ways to play around with the spices makes it great for all seasons.

This went over really well at Christmas.  I used 3 apples and extra cinnamon as others suggested.  We warmed each slice, served with ice cream and a little caramel drizzle.  Will make again.

I made this exactly the way the recipe was.  The only thing I did was used 4 apples.  I did not think it was to sweet.  My guests thought because it was served chilled it tasted like apple by alemode, without using ice cream.  I am making it again today for a party we are having tomorrow!

Stir the filling the whole time in the pan.  I didn't and it came out lumpy, so I remade it.  Very delicious.

AWESOME pie! I made it just as it is but added a couple more apples. I used Gold Rush apples from a local orchard and they were a bit small. I did a lattice top too and it was simply divine! That's saying a lot since I don't normally eat apple pies, I just like to bake them for others.

Its worth all the work! You can also use the glaze reciepe all by itself! I used cream instead of heavy cream, works great!

I absolutely love this recipe!  It has become my favorite apple pie recipe ever!  I always use an extra apple and I like to bake with natural sugar (just a preference). I have only used the glaze once, because I feel that one of this recipe's key virtues is that is sweet and delicious, but not too sweet. Sometimes I will just sprinkle a little raw sugar on top for decoration. I  have made a vegan version and it was crazy delicious. I couldn't even tell myself that it was non-dairy so I thought I would share my lactose free vanilla custard rendition .  I used 2 1/4 cups of soy half and half, you can use soy milk but you might want to up the amount of sugar a tad, 6 tbl. cornstarch, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/4 cup of natural raw sugar, 1 14 oz can coconut milk and 2 tbl. vanilla extract, and 2 tbl. vegan margarine. I mixed all the dry ingredients in the pot and then slowly added the soy and coconut milk over mediun heat just until boiling stirring constantly, then I added the margarine until melted, removed from heat and added the vanilla extract.  This was the perfect       consistency and was just as delicious as the dairy version.  I also used the pie crust I recipe that I found on this sight because it didn't call for eggs and it worked out beautifully.

I made practically all of this pie from scratch: the pie shell recipe from this site (I used pie shell IV), homemade heavy cream, had to use flour instead of cornstarch, and home-grown apples from the apple tree. I used Black Apples and they were great to bake with.  I think I should have used store-bought heavy cream and real cornstarch bc I don't think my home-made ingredients created the type of consistancy in the custard that it was supposed to have. Nevertheless it was still a good pie. I might try it again.

Awesome!!!!!!!!Everyone loved this including me, I will definitely make this again.  I did have some trouble with the glazing step, it was really thick so I heat it in the microwave for a little bit and drizzled it over top and that worked nicely.  Not sure how I was supposed to do it.

Spectacular!  This pie is really very very delicious. I used 4 apples (2 golden delicious & 2 gala), a teaspoon of fresh grated nutmeg and it was just right.  Everyone liked it a lot. A true hit!  Thanks for sharing.

This is the best apple pie I have ever made.  I made the following adjustments:  doubled the amount of apples and seasoning, swapped the cinnamon for apple pie spice and added 1 tbl white sugar to the apple mix.  Everyone was raving about it on Thanksgiving.  They ate more of this than the pumpkin pie!

I admit I was skeptical about this pie - I wasn't sure how apples went with custard.  I made it based on the 5 star rating it has - I am glad I did!  My husband and I both loved this!  I used more apple than the recipe calls for and I added a bit of nutmeg.  We chilled the pie really well based on other reviews and it turned out fabulously.  I would definitely make this again and again!

I don't care for traditional apple pie, but this variation is absolutely delicious.  The cream filling makes this pie scrumptious, and the recipe is so simple.

This is a good pie. I usually make a different apple pie from this site and it's probably not fair that all other pies have to be compared to that one, but this one is a little different. I like the creamy filling in it and I like the glaze on the top of the crust. I think the next time I make this I will add in more cinnamon and some nutmeg and add some cinnamon to the glaze or skip the glaze and just do an egg wash with cinnamon and sugar. Very good pie though!

Fantastic Pie.  I did increase the apples to three, left off the glaze (to much sweetness) and added a sprinkle of sugar before baking.  This was the closest to a perfect pie I have ever eaten or baked.

I had never tried anything like this before, and wasn't entirely prepared to like it. I suppose I made it more out of curiosity than anything. It was actually delicious...and I will make it again and again. We have one in the freezer and it's going with us to Thanksgiving dinner! :)

I made this pie using the "basic flaky pie crust" recipe from this site and it was delicious!  i added cinnamon to the pie crust, which i think gave it added flavor.  i used two large granny smiths, and i think there was plenty of apple, although if you have a really deep pie dish i might use another.  thanks for a great recipe!

This was a Pillsbury Bakeoff Contest recipe from several years ago. I couldn't find my copy anywhere, but luckily ran across it here. It's been a favorite at Thanksgiving for years. I always add an extra apple for a more "appley" pie.

YUMMY!!!!  This is the best apple pie I ever had!  The only thing I would change next time I make this is to put in a couple of more apples and a bit more cinnamon.

This is soooo goood.  I am not a pie maker, but I had a bunch of farm-fresh apples to use so I decided to give it a shot.  It was delicious.  The apples I used were sweet, not tart, and I increased the number of them.  You could easily use 4-5 apples, and I'd even suggest it.  The cream inside really stays separate from the apples and is a delicious surprise (I did serve it cooled as recommended).  I also used Jiffy brand pie crust mix which was quite good.  My mother has always been the "apple-pie queen", but this recipe rivaled hers--and I came home from our family get-together with an empty pan!

I have never liked apple pie but this one I love. My brothers girlfriend loves pie and she told me that this is now her favorite. She has requested this pie for her wedding. Thank you for the recipe.

This pie is delicious!  The cream in the pie blends nicely with the apples.  I did use 3 to 4 apples and doubled the cinnamon.  Great warm with French vanilla ice cream.

Nice Pie! Not my favorite but enjoyable.  I used one more apple and a little more cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. freshly grated nutmeg too.

I'm not an apple pie fan, but this is fantastic!  There's something about the cream that makes it so yummy.

Easy, looked great and received rave reviews.  Like others I used 4 apples and sliced them thinly.  My husband said that only thing missing was raisens - maybe next time.  Will definitely make again.

This pie is sooooo good. I almost ate the entire pie myself. I brought it to work and they all loved it. I will make this one again and again. Now the question is How do I make it and not eat it all myself and gain weight?

This was a HUGE hit for Thanksgiving 2006!  I am not a baker and this was a breeze.  Everybody LOVED it.  I also served pumpkin cake, pumpkin pie but the apple cream pie was the first one gone.
I do have a few things that I did different.  I used 4 apples (I had a deep dish pie pan) so I used a bit more cream and milk and cornstarch.  I also doubled the glaze recipe and it was definitely worth it.  People liked that touch the most.

This pie is insanely amazing.  I have never baked a pie before, and yet I have to say, this is the best pie I have ever eaten!!!  

My husband will not shut up about how delicious it is, and is telling all his friends.

The only changes I made were that I doubled the amount of glaze, per other reviews.

Do refrigerate this pie to let the cream set, but I honestly loved this pie warmed a bit once it completely cooled.  But no matter how you eat it, it is most certainly a slice of heaven!

One of the best apple pies I've ever had! I heard people that I served it to say it was "fabulous", "wonderful", "delicious". And it was easy to make. I used 3 apples instead of 2 and added half again as much flour and cinnamon. Would make it again in a heartbeat!

I made this pie a few years ago for a Thanksgiving dinner and my sister has requested it for every special event ever since! The "custard" part is so good I sometimes make extra so I can eat that just by its self. It kind of looks like a lot of steps but it's totally worth it!

Fantastic pie and easy to make.  I am not very experienced when it comes to pies, so I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome.  My husband calls it the 5 minute pie, because he takes it to work and it is gone in 5 minutes!  Thanks for the recipe!

This pie is so tasty!!!  It disappeared quite quickly from my house.  I would recommend keeping it refridgerated and adding more apples if you would like.  You have to try this!

This pie was my contribution to the family Thanksgiving dessert.  It was easy to make, held up well, and was delicious.  At their request I'm forwarding the recipe on to my sister and sister-in-law.

This pie was wonderful.  We ate the whole thing.  I let everyone put on their own glaze.  This will be a family favorite
