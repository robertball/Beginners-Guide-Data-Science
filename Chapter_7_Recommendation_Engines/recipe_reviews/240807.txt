Very tasty dressing only thing is I would recommend doubling maybe even tripling the recipe. You only get maybe less then a quarter cup of dressing if you follow the recipe as is.

I had never heard of double concentrated tomato paste before, but while I was shopping the other day, sure enough, there it was on the top shelf. (It's sold by the tube, and the tube is in a box, in case you're looking for it). It has a deep dark color and very rich, tomato flavor. I followed the recipe to a "T", but couldn't get the vinaigrette to emulsify. No matter what I did, I couldn't get it to blend together nicely. The oil kept separating and immediately going to the top. I considered putting it in my food processor, but I didn't want to dirty it for such a small amount of dressing. We ate it as is, and it had a nice flavor.

This dressing has a deep, rich tomato flavor and just the right amount of tang from the vinegars.  I have an abundance of fresh basil now, so I did add a little chopped basil to the vinaigrette.  The dressing didn't emulsify quite as well as I would have liked ( the tomato paste separates to the bottom), but once the bottle's shaken, it's good-to-go.

Pretty easy to make with first class ingredients. I love the roasted tomato paste and never thought about using it in a salad dressing. It works perfectly!!

I made this twice, because the tomato paste refused to emulsify the first time.  The first time I whisked it and it had bits in it, so I used an immersion blender and it still had bits in it, then I put it into a small food processor.  It still had bits in it.

The second time I put everything but the olive oil into a double boiler, thinking that heating the tomato paste might break up the bits better.  It did, but there are still small pieces in there.  It tastes good, I'll learn to live with the errant bits.  Also, I just watched the video, I would not have thought of putting this on perch.

SO GOOD!  And it all blended well. I don't know if it was the brand of tomato paste I used  (Contadina) or if its because I used one of those wire Blender Balls for mixing (just put it in the container and shake 5 or  times) but it blended perfectly and has not seperated. And I'm not sure why the other reviewer said that it made less than a 1/4 cup when just the EVOO alone is 6 tablespoons but I got about 9 tablespoons out of mine. True, thats not much but a little does go a long way. But it's so good, I've been finding reason to eat more salad so it won't last long, I'll probably make a double batch next time.

This dressing was really good. I served it atop my Butterhead lettuce. Yum!
