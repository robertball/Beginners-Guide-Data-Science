I received my first ground moose from my sister in AK. I was worried we wouldn't like it. I picked this recipe to prepare it, not knowing what else to do with moose meat. My whole family loved it! I did add a raw egg and about 1/3 c. bread crumbs to the moose meat to keep in from coming apart while making meatballs. Excellent recipe and I will make again even if I have to use ground beef.  (p.s. for those who do not have moose, it tasted really similar to bison/buffalo. I think that would be a easy to access alternative)

Moose is impossible to get unless you know someone who hunts.  If anyone knows of a game farm that raises moose meat for commercial sale, please let us know!  Had to substitute ground elk instead.  Unfortunately, my sauce turned out far too thick to pour evenly over the meatballs.  Very tasty though!

I hate giving such a low rating.. but the "sauce" was a paste.  Before I even heated it up it was already thick and pasty.. How is this working for anyone?

Delicious! I didn't read the recipe all the way through and just mixed all the ingredients into the meat rather than making the sauce first but they turned out amazing. I posted a picture - we served it over broccoli slaw sauteed in garlic and basil

i really liked this it was something different and really good. I never added the garlic powder or onion powder but I did cut up a small amount of onion to replace the onion powder and I really enjoyed it.

Giving the recipie a 4/5 only because I found when i added the chili powder to my sauce it became very gritty.  I didn't like the texture too much but the taste was still good . 

I found my batch a little dry after the oven so depending on how you like the meat... Keep an eye on it while in the oven... Might only put them in for 7-10 mins to bake insteAd of the 20 suggested. 

 I would definitely make again !

It was OK. The honey-garlic flavor didn't flavorful the moose meat enough and it ended up tasting too gamey.
