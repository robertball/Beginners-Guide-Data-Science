Pretty good recipe! Although I drained the Rio Tel before adding them to the meat, the flavor was great! I'd highly recommend draining the meat  so no big grease is in your meat when you eat the tacos. Also, no need to add more tomatoes on top of the tacos as the Rio Tel adds plenty of tomatoes in the meal already. Overall, really good and works well with sour cream in the tacos :)

Yes, the best. I will be using the Rockin taco recipe from this day forward. The perfect amount of spice, but I like kick.

Easy. Can substitute other diced tomatoes or picante sauce in the meat sauce.  I added some chopped onion and garlic to the beef. Flexible recipe to add or subtract some spice/heat. Use fresh chopped tomatoes, lettuce, and good cheese for the toppings. I like corn tortillas lightly browned in a cast iron skillet.

This is a great simple & easy recipe for tacos. My wife & I liked it better than the more elaborate ones we have used in the past. We used Rotell for the meat portion, but used fresh tomatoes for the topping, along with chopped onion and shredded cheese. We did not have any lettuce, but it was still delicious.
