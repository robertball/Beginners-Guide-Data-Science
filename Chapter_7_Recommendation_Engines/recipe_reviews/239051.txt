These were really good!!  We decided to bake instead of fry.  I put the chicken mixture in the tortilla and added about a TBSP of grated cheddar cheese, then rolled them up and placed in a 9 X 13 dish. I baked them uncovered at 375 degrees for about 15 minutes until the tortillas were crisp. They turned out great!! Thanks for sharing!

My family liked these flautas. The lemon flavor gave the flautas a tang that lemon lovers would like. I sautéed the onions in the butter and then added the flour. I used a whisk to smooth out the roux. I love to use roasted chicken so the chicken is not too dry. I used two chicken breasts sprinkled some poultry seasoning on the chicken breasts with pats of butter. Then I placed the chicken in a oven proof pan with a lid and baked the chicken for 25-30 minutes. Thanks for sharing your recipe Staria.

Yummmmmm! With a family of 7, I'm always on the look out for new Taco Tuesday ideas (you know, I don't want to keep repeating the same meal every week!). Everyone LOVED these flautas!

Very good recipe! I made some changes based on personal preference: used corn tortillas instead of flour, omitted black olives, added a little cumin and some cheddar cheese. Also baked as other reviews suggested to make healthier. Garnished with onion, tomato, and cilantro and used guacamole and plain Greek yogurt (instead of sour cream) for dipping.

I loved this recipe. For the filling I used serrano chile, salt, pepper, onion and the rue. I used left over chicken bought from grocery store. As I stuffed the flour tortilla added spice of mozzarella cheese.

I made this because I could not believe the ingredients and all the rave reviews.  I have to say we liked it a lot.  The kids asked me to make these again.  I followed the recipe as is except used shredded chicken from a rotisserie chicken instead of the canned chicken.  I'll be making it again.

I didn't have Paprika so I added 3 generous shots of our favorite hot sauce and one tablespoon of green chiles - they were  a hit!

In an attempt to recreate the ever elusive date night for the husband and I, I went searching for a flautas recipe that I could style after Chevy's/Rio Bravos appetizer flautas. Umm screw the restaurant, this is delicious! I was pleasantly surprised and now have a way to use up all the extra shredded chicken I always seem to have floating in the fridge. I omitted the black olives because I don't like them,  served this drizzled with Chipotle Sour Cream and Jalapeno Jelly for dipping. It was amazing. Sorry Chevy's, you lost 2 customers and your prices were going up anyways. Thank you so much for this simple yet delicious and satisfying recipe!!

I made it exactly as is except I only did a sprinkle of lemon because the first time I made it, it was too tangy. I also added about 2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese. This recipe is a hit my friends and family keep requesting me to make it!

My husband really liked these. I thought they were okay. I added a cup of grated up summer squash to make it a little more healthy. I also baked them in the oven for about 45 minutes until they were crispy.  They were kind of dry this way, so they needed salsa or guacamole.

This recipe is definitely now one of our family's favorite go-to dinners! The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I feel like the original recipe doesn't make quite enough filling (especially if you have a family of 4 or more), but we just make a couple of batches (haven't tried truly doubling yet, but will). I don't love olives, so I leave that out. I have also made flautas with pork meat that we had left over from carnitas, and they were amazing! Also adding that if you like the cut of the lemon juice in the meat, the recipe could use slightly more than what is called for!

I did this dish a bit differently.  I bought a rotisserie chicken and shredded it.  I put the shredded chicken into the frying pan, added just over a 1/4 cup of water and then one package of taco mix.  Once mixed I let it cool on a plate and then followed the instructions.  I disliked the roux mixture altogether as it gave the chicken a pasty taste so I added more lemon juice to even it out.  I rolled the chicken mix onto the tortillas and add diced green chilies on top along with some Tex mex cheese.  I baked mine at 375 for 15 minutes, spread some melted butter on top and then browned them for another minute.  In the future I will skip the roux altogether, and add more black olives.  I served them along side a bowl of homemade salsa verde salsa.

Finally decided we weren't going to keep this & try with our changes because we can try without a recipe. 1st we wouldn't use the roux because it dried everything out really bad. We also would put anything we put on top except cheese inside with other ingredients we'd keep. We felt the olives, paprika didn't do a thing to give any flavor so we figured we'd use green salsa, & more chilies. We'd have to fold like a burrito since we think deep frying would do better in all around crispy texture.

These were just ok for me.  I wasn't a big fan of the butter/flour in the filling.  I did use corn tortillas in place of flour and I only par fried them, then filled, rolled and baked.  This method seemed to work well.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

The flavor of these  are so good that you don't even miss the cheese!  Love the addition of the olives, which you don't normally see in flautas.  Dipped in pico, salsa and sour cream!!

Sooooo good!!!! Will Definitely make again!  I did add a pinch of cayenne because we like a little heat and I lightly sprinkled some packaged taco seasoning over the meat mixture.  When I make again I will cut the lemon juice by 1 tsp...was a little much for my taste but I only use fresh lemon juice which tends to be stronger than the bottle stuff.  Also..have them all rolled up & ready to go before starting to fry! They fry very fast so you have to work fast.

I added salt and pepper, diced green chili’s and a dash of vinegar for taste. 
Overall the premise is great. There was some difficulty keeping the tortillas rolled while frying as they tend to want to expand, even with a toothpick or three. 

That said: 
This is one the simplest and tastiest recipes for flautes my family has had, so thank you!

These turned out AMAZING. I boiled the chicken, shredded it, and threw it in a large pan with some salsa, blackened seasoning, franks red hot sauce, and some fresh lime juice. After putting everything together in small flour tortillas, I placed them carefully (with 2 toothpicks, 1 on one end of the flouta and the 2nd toothpick at the other end) in oil and let them fry for about 25-30 seconds on each side. My boyfriend and I LOVED them. This meal took me a long while to prepare (about an hour in total) not including the time to boil the chicken and fry the floutas, but VERY much worth it!! Will be making these again.

Super!!  I used part chicken breast and part boneless skinless chicken thighs and boiled them in Chicken bullion than cooled and shredded it.  On the recipe I omitted the black olives because I was making them for my grand baby and didn't think she would like them, but I'm sure they are delicious with them.  I melted the butter and then the onion than added the flour, just cause I thought the onions would cook better this way.  For the flautas I fried the tortillas in oil and than allowed them to cool than wrapped the chicken and placed in the oven to crisp.  I made a whole bunch and will freeze them so when my granddaughter comes to visit, I have something ready for her. I hope they freeze well.   I will definitely make this recipe again!! Thank you for sharing!!

Delicious!  I started with chicken breast that I had thrown in the crockpot on low overnight with a bunch of salsa.  I left out the onions because of the salsa in the chicken but other than that followed the recipe.  Excellent!

Sorry, we ate them so fast I couldn't post pictures.  Also, I used big burrito plantillas, therefore they were mega big!! Awesome, very tasty!

The flavors are outstanding and my family loved them. If you have a sensitive stomach they are really heavy. For me next time I am going to bake them and I'm going to try to find a way to use tons less butter.

Yummm!!!! I used the juice from half a lemon... that gave it an extra zing. This was delicious. I have no modifications.

Made this almost as written, didn't add the full amount of lemon and omitted the olives. This was very tasty, but I feel like it was missing something, not quite sure what, yet. On the plus side, my picky son liked them. Next time I will bake them, since these are not very healthy.

These were really good and easy to make. I left out the black olives and I added cheese. My family loved them.

I never had flautas before and it was a different recipe than I usually make.  This enjoyable dish was tasty, but next time I’ll not bother with the black olives and add a little more jazz.   It’s easy to adjust this recipe to your personal tastes.  I trimmed the ends off to neaten them up and absorb less oil when cooking.   I thought these were fantastic and I’ll definitely make them again.
