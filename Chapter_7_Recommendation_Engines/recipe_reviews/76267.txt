Although it says "every recipe works - every time", this one didn't!.  It made a VERY thick batter that only rose marginally, even though I followed the directions exactly... and it wasn't a problem with my baking powder, since I made some muffins at the same time that turned out fine!  Don't bother with this one!

Looked great, tasted like nothing.  I'm going to tweak the seasonings, but as it sits now, don't waste your time or ingredients.
