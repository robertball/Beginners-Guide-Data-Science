Great flavors and the mixture of textures make this recipe a keeper! I really enjoyed the cooking process and I did have to let it simmer a bit for the Ditalini to become tender. I added 1 part water to 1 part sauces through the process but definitely kept it at a stew consistency. Delicious!

This was good. Not so great 3 days in a row though! lol I like this recipe. Can be hard to find the yeast so we used parmesan cheese. Worked well! You hardly even notice the quinoa which may be plus for picky eaters.
