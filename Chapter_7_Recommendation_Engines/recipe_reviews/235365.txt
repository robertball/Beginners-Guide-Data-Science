The only change I made was using shallots rather than garlic as some of our family members cannot tolerate garlic - also I seared the meat prior to placing in the crock pot and it came out perfect! Highly recommended!

For me, it turned out too sour, I think because the kind of BBQ sauce I used was already sour so the addition of vinegar was too much, but otherwise I liked it. I might add even more onion and garlic next time

This pulled pork is great. I used a pork butt, and Stubb's BBQ sauce, cooked it for 8 hours on low and it fell apart. I reserved the onions to use in the rolls.The problem I had was that I could not get the sauce to thicken.  Will try to get it thicker the next time. Great flavor. Will make again.

This is by far the best recipe for pulled pork.  I followed the recipe exactly.  A hint: mix all the liquid ingredients and spices in a bowl first, then pour over the pork.

I chopped the onions instead of slicing them. I also added salt and extra bbq sauce. I was AMAZING.

Now a steady favorite of ours! Easy and delicious! I double the garlic, but other than that itâ€™s just about perfect.

I lived in Memphis for three years and this is pretty close!  I use a sweet bottled sauce in the crockpot and I also had trouble getting it to thicken but the pork tastes great.
