i would suggest letting this marinate for 24 hrs. My family has made ceviche for years fish and shrimp. and that is the safest time plus it gives it a better flavor

One thing I would like to add is that it should sit for at least 5 hours if the fish is raw, I personally am scared of that, so I just bring a pot of water to a boil and then add the tilapia for about 5-7 minutes until all white then drain water and shred fish and add everything else.  Although I did not use the cucumber, and I like white onion.

I cut the recipe down to only 2 fillets and still needed just about the same amount of limes, cucumber and tomato the recipe calls for. I also added Mango for additional flavor. After resting for only an hour and twenty minutes as called for, still tasted VERY raw. Tried tasting again the next day and was much better (about 24 hrs after making) so only 3 stars in my book.

DO NOT COOK THE FISH! Ceviche is raw seafood cooked by the acid of the citrus. If you precook it, you lose the texture and everything. You only need an hour to acid cook the fish. It is obvious that the texture changes from raw meat to not raw. This is not sashimi. I added a jalapeño too. We ate it with tortilla chips. Yummy!

Can't have a Ceviche without some chopped jalapeno or serrano peppers (at least not in Texas!).....and because it's raw, it really needs at least 5-8 hours in the fridge to macerate. Also, add some cooked 'salad' shrimp, and a 1/4 cup of good salsa (Pace "hot").

Sounds good!  I add 10 limes & 15 lemons, No tomatoe or cucumber instead I do All the color pepers & a whole bunch of cilantro & 4 cloves of garlic.  As for how long it sits, that's a personal preference.  But another important thing is to use a glass bowl.  We eat ours with Lime flavor tortilla chips.  Great summer meal & packed with protein & very low calories! Enjoy!

Not bad. I definitely took the advice of another user who boiled the tilapia for about 8 min. I am not brave enough to do raw.

I made this just as the recipe says and I was FABULOUS!!!  I love raw fish, (sashimi, sushi, etc) and I thought it was just fine marinating that long. So good!  I'll make this again and again. I think it's my new favorite food!  :)

Wicked Uncle Keith U got this right about the peppers.

Can't have a Tilapia Ceviche without some chopped jalapeno or serrano peppers (at least not in Texas!)..and because it's raw, it really needs at least 5-8 hours in the fridge to(marinade). Also, add some cooked 'salad' shrimp, and a 1/4 cup of good salsa but forget the (Pace)use hernandez (hot)salsa, Fish Ceviche is one of the best,rate right up there with Sashimi, Sushi an rice hot cakes with Green sauce.

I suggest to let marinate for al least 4 hours and, and when you chop the veggies keep them separate every one of them until ready to use it gives better flavor

I make this all the time and it's always delicious. I cook the onions with the fish and let it marinate over night.  I also use either 3 Serrano chiles or 1 and 1/2 habanero.  Can't have it without that kick, it's a must.  Serve it with crab meat on a tostada and it is now called a Mixta and it is always a hit at parties.  I also, cook it with shrimp or add boiled octopus to add some flavor and texture. By the way, if you pre-boil the fish, some, including myself, would no longer it ceviche.

You can toss some corn kernels too. For a twist, I use the small  end of a melon baller  and scoop kiwi balls into the salad. Yum!

Good basic recipe. I added carrots just because I had some and it adds a great crunch. Also added chopped canned jalapeños and some of the jalapeño vinegar because I love a spicy kick!

I cut the tilapia into pretty small pieces so that it would "cook" faster & more thoroughly (also cut up shrimp).  I used limes, cilantro, green onion and garlic and then put tomatoes, mango & cucumber on the side so everyone could make their own mix to their preferences!  I only chilled an hour and it was delicious, and leftovers even better the next day.

The fish is fine to eat after an hour (it tastes and feels cooked), but I recommend marinating for several hours for taste. We ate after an hour and it was bland and boring, but leftovers the next day were good after sitting overnight. Next time, I'll add more seasoning and let it sit longer.

great recipe nice simple delicious!  I would marinate overnight to let the flavors really set into The fish. I use equal parts lemon and lime juice to the better flavor....

I added some chopped Thai Chilis for some zing. Was yummy overall except that my lime juice was a tad bitter.
