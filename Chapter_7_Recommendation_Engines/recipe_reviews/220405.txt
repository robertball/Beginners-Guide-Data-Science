These were so easy and so decadent to serve for a simple supper. My neighbor thought they took a ton of work...WRONG! I did add garlic to the stuffing, other than that, I followed the recipe but scaled it back to serve 3. Thank you for a new way to prepare lobster!

The stuffing overwhelms the lobster too much.    And the stuffing has too few ingredients, you might just as well eat bread crumbs and a stick of butter  for supper.

I’ve never seen stuffed lobster made like this. Butter fly the tail, top it with a crabmeat stuffing, and bake in the oven for a bit. Put under broiler, if you’d like the topping a little crunchy. I’m from Connecticut. That’s how we do stuffed lobster and stuffed shrimp.

I don't understand:  If the lobster tail meat is already cooked, why bake it for 50 more minutes?!  That would make it tough and rubbery and inedible. Lobster or any seafood only needs to be steamed or broiled until opaque - no more than a mere 10 to 15 minutes. Rule of thumb for seafood:  10-12 minutes per 1-inch of thickness. I like my seafood on the drier side, so I cook it for 12-15 mins per 1-inch thickness, sorry Chef.

Easy cooked lobster tails:
There is something wrong with this recipe. It doesn't take 50 - 60 minutes to bake bread crumbs and COOKED lobster meal.
Do mean remove the UNCOOKED meat from the tails, then mix w/ the other indigents  - then bake?

I've never tried broiling lobster before but since I have a freezer full of Costco's lobster tails, I thought I'd take a few minutes to try this recipe for my dinner.
Since reading comments about what didnt work or what people didnt like, my review is merely my opinion and adjustments inspired by this recipe.
Here's what I tried:
I took my frozen lobster out of freezer and thawed it in cool, salted water. 
Once thawed, I cut the top of the two lobster shells from head to tail and pried the shell apart a little so I could get my butter etc into the meat. 

*When I make this again (very soon), I would take the other reviewers' suggestion and remove the meat as one piece, add my oil, S&P, etc.. THEN put the meat back in the shell to broil.

I poured about 1 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil on the bottom of my glass, oven safe dish (didnt have tin foil) and added a few slices from a garlic clove into the oil on the bottom of my dish.
Place the two tails on top of the oil and garlic.
Pour aprox 1/2 tsp of oil onto meat, 
Sprinkle salt & pepper on meat as desired,

Since I didnt have breadcrumbs, and being cautious as not to "over do it" and lose the lobsters flavour; 
I took a handful of herb/garlic crutons, crushed them up, then sprinkled onto lobster meat sparingly.

I put the rest of the sliced garlic clove into my 1.5 tbsp of butter and microwaved it till melted 
Pour melted garlic butter onto lobster meat, on the top of the bread crumbs/crutons.
I added another half garlic clov

I substituted panko for the bread crumbs and used half the amount. I added garlic and parsley. Also, used half the butter. Also, minced some shallots very fine into the panko. I rate it a 5 with my adjustments. Original recipe overwhelms the fish with too much bread crumbs. I think some crab meat would be a good addition, like someone else suggested.

It would be nice to know how big the lobster tails are. 2 cups of bread crumbs  with 4 oz tails is a lot different than 2 cups with 8 oz tails.

This was amazing! The first time I make any recipe for the first time, I follow it exactly.  Then after eating it, I may tweak it a little. I will be making this again! There are a lot of Fridays in Lent...and this is a special and easy recipe.

This could not have been any easier. I omitted the salt and used panko instead of bread crumbs. I would make this again.
