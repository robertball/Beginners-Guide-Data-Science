With 2 minor changes - ie left out the Lawrey's seasoned salt and the shredded cheese - this turned out marvelous.  With 1 pound of beef this easily made 4 servings with fantastic results.  Loved it.

very good.  I cooked the onions and celery a little before adding the rest of the ingredients.  Everything else I followed per recipe.  we served on top of egg noodles.  Everyone loved it and good thing we doubled the recipe because I am looking forward to seconds

I added a 28oz can of tomatoes since I had more meat than recipe originally called for. I also added more carrots, left out celery since we don't care for it and didn't bother with the cheese. Pretty good.

Al, Al, Al - this recipe was delicious, easy and perfect  for a winter dinner. I followed the recipe except I used cube steaks (on sale). The meat was tender to having a little chew which was fine. The sauce is excellent. I did not add cheese (do not need the fat and the taste was terrific as is); and I served with rice. This was a ton of food for two of us and our extended family enjoyed the leftovers. This is definitely a keeper.

My husband complimented it on the first bite.  Served it over rice with no cheese. A couple modifications:  (1) didn't use any flour so it was a bit soupy; (2) used home canned tomatoes, not stewed; and (3) cut the meat into bite-sized pieces.

I was a little nervous to try this as for the long cooking time. I thought it might be to dry. Well let’s just say I’ve been making recipes on here for years and this is my first ever review This was amazing I didn’t change a thing ( ok maybe added more cheese cuz who doesn’t love cheese) this will definitely been on my menu thanks for sharing:)

Very good. First time I have made Swiss Steak so I can't compare it to others, but the family and I agreed that Al's works just fine. I also sauteed onions, celery etc. before mixing with the tomatoes. I recommend this recipe for good taste, attractive presentation and straightforward instructions.

This was really good.  I only changed  a couple of things based on what I had on hand.  I used a can of crushed tomatoes and I used red and yellow bell peppers.  I omitted the cheese. 
 Everyone thought it was great.

Had a BOGO on bottom round steak and went to my trusty All Recipes for ideas. This was yum! Followed directions except for the cheese, as it didn't seem necessary. Served with roasted potato wedges and a baguette to sop up the flavorable gravy! Will make again.

I was looking for a heartier Swiss steak than the one I made for the kids 30 years ago.  This is it.  What a great recipe, and oven instead of stovetop worked so well.  I backed off the slow cooker recipes for this dish because I didn't want the meat to get mushy, and this recipe hit the spot.  I didn't change a thing except left out the cheese this time.  I felt the gravy stood alone.  And I made mashed potatoes with it.  Perfect!!!  Thanks, "Al"!

This is a winner! Made it per directions but left out the cheese. I've never put carrots in, but what a lovely idea! I had baby carrots on hand and cut them in quarters. They came out perfectly cooked! I'll be making this again! Thanks!

Made as directed with the exception of replacing seasoned salt with Cajun seasoning. I made sure to tenderize my steak beforehand and WOW, it turned so tender! I found that it benefited from additional seasonings so added paprika, onion powder, etc. Really surprising how tasty it was!

With a couple of changes, this recipe was not only 5 stars, but the best Swiss steak I've ever had! I substituted Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning for the seasoned salt and a can of Rotel tomatoes & peppers for the stewed tomatoes. Additionally, I did not include the cheese at the end. Originally, these changes were a little too spicy for my wife, so I added some extra beef broth...turned out just right!

This was DELICIOUS!!!  I rarely rate recipes, but this one certainly deserved a 5 star rating.  My husband kept saying "This is delicious" after every other bite.  I did leave out the Lowry's Seasoning and the shredded cheese.  Next time I will add extra beef broth, stewed tomatoes and flour to increase the amount of sauce.

Thanks for a recipe that I'll make many more times, Al!!

A GREAT way to use a tough cut of meat.  Perfect ingredient portions except I used 1/2 c of beef broth.  It just needed more salt/flavor.  Nice way to get your veggies.  I did saute the carrots and celery before other veggies as suggested by another review.  Baked the whole 90 minutes.  Hubby liked a lot.

Love this! So does my husband and teenager.  Used 1.5 pounds of steak and doubled the other ingredients . I left out the green pepper because I didn't have any. I served it with mashed potatoes. Delicious!

it's ok. Sauce had some flavor. probably better in a croc pot. I really think that's the only way to cook such a tough cut of meat. To much work to little reward.

I made this without the Worcestershire because I was out and it still turned out great.  Added mushroom because we like them. I also omitted the cheese, as it's (in my mind) necessary.

Made a few adjustments and we enjoyed the steak.  I added more vegetables so that with a baked potato I didn't need to cook anything else.

We grew up eating this meal but we had not had it in years. I mentioned it and next thing I knew, hubby had gone and bought the steak. I used the same ingredients minus the carrots. My onion was large and I used a tad more Worcestershire sauce. I added a red bell
Pepper also. I cooked this on top of the range and did not use the oven. This was delicious.   Leftovers heat well.

I used chopped steaks and. Red bell pepper and the rest remained the same. Delicious, easy, and fast to throw together right after work. Would be amazing in a slow cooker as well.

This was great!  The steak was a little dry, but I think I browned it too long; next time I’m going to try it with cube steak.

I made this dish, but had to skip the season-all salt since I was out of it. Substituted a small amount of Smokehouse Maple for grilling. That small amount really added a good flavor to the overall dish. If you try this, don't put too much on the meat. You don't want an overwhelming maple flavor.

I made this in the crockpot. I added 1 can of beef consommé instead of the beef broth. I used Fire roasted tomatoes as a replacement for canned tomatoes. Cooked on low for 7 hours. It turned out wonderful!

I made this following the recipe except omitted the cheese as suggested by other reviewers.  This was wonderful and both kids (8 and 10) like it!  Thanks, will make again.

I forgot to add Worcestershire sauce, omitted the cheese, and I used a little less oil to brown the beef, but the results were great - tender and tasty.

I found a poor piece of couponed round steak in the bottom of my freezer.  It probably should have been pitched.  I pounded and chopped and thanks, to this recipe, a great dinner!  I did not have stewed tomatoes, but crushed.  I added mushrooms to the mix and a couple good dashes of hot sauce.  The sauce simmering on the stove was super.  Be sure to use a deep casserole dish.  Will be making this again.

This was amazing! Great flavor.  Sauted the veggies first then added the tomatoes. Having homegrown tomatoes on hand was a plus! Reminiscent of home. (No Season Salt needed; Didn't top with cheese either)

This is a great recipe, just like my dad made when we were kids.  No cheese necessary, however!  Tastes good the first day, and the leftovers are even better.  I adapt many of my recipes to use with venison and this is one of them.

It was great the only things I did differently was I used chicken stock because I was out of beef stock and I browned the meat without the flour , sautéed the veggies and put it all in the slow cooker. I used Rotel because I was out of regular canned tomatoes so it has a small kick to it.  I just tasted a piece and my husband needs to hurry home from work or I'll start eating without him tonight. I can't wait to dig in.  Great recipe!

It was delicious! A bit time consuming chopping the veggies but well worth it. I had 2 lbs steak so I just doubled the recipe.  Followed it to a tee and it was a success. Thanks for sharing it.

I made this exactly as written, except I didn't add the cheese.  I would probably go a bit lighter on the oil the next time.  Other than that, it was wonderful - the entire family loved it and asked me to make it again.  Win!

This was very good, my husband is even looking forward to leftovers! I didn't use the cheese, and I took advantage of my frozen tomatoes. I drained them and added some homemade tomato sauce, instead of stewed tomatoes. If I didn't have such a supply of tomatoes I would definitely use the canned stewed tomatoes. I also added some fresh oregano as well. I will definitely keep making this :)

had to make this gluten/dairy free for my husband (used rice flour, soy cheese and omitted the Worcestershire and added Montreal steak spice instead) and he said it was not bad. The flavours are similar to other dishes I make and I didn't really think this was a standout...but when asked if I should make it again, HUBS replied 'yea, sure!'

Pretty good flavor and really easy to make. Everyone enjoyed it, a bit different from what I remembered but a good different. I omitted the cheese.
