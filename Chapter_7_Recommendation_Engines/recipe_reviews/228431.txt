Soooo yummy! I couldn't resist adding some green onion and bacon. I'm not sure it would have fit in my 2 qt casserole pan...I just baked it in the 5 qt pot that I boiled the pasta in. Next time I will add more chipotle since we like things spicy. A great recipe to tweak and play around with! Thank you!

Very easy and quick to make, and with the Chipotle peppers it's not bland at all. The second time I made it, I just doubled everything but the macaroni because it wasn't cheesy enough, half mild cheddar, half  jack/colby, then I had to put some in a second dish. So delicious, we love it!

As I was saying before, I did not have the cheese soup so I used shredded Parmesan and cheddar in the sauce with whole milk.  All I can say is this recipe is better than I have ever made before.  The chipotle will be doubled the next time.  I was cautious because my husband cannot tolerate spice like I can.  Delicious!!!!!!!

This is a good recipe, I really don't like changing recipe too much but I had to change this a little bit first I added a whole onions chopped finely and I did not add the whole container of chipotle next time I will, I also made two boxes of the elbow because I wanted to have left overs.  I added a little bit of flour to pan to create a rue I added heavy milk, and two cans of condensed milk, I added 2 cups of velveeta cheese, 2 cups of mozzarella cheese and 4 cups of cheddar cheese it came out very southern which is the taste I was going for, my husband loved it and next time I make it I will add more chipotle to it.

This is the best mac and cheese ever. I initially thought you add a " can" of chili's, then after adding 3, I saw my mistake. It was great anyway! I got lavished with compliments all night. I will definitely be making this over and over again.

Was so tasty and so so easy. Have tried several different recipes and this one was tops so far. Did add a bit of bacon but otherwise stuck to recipe. Think I might add more chipotle next time for more spice though. Maybe a mix of several cheeses would be good too. Yummy!

I hate to be one of those people that says "I love it, but I made it differently," but that's what I'm going to do. I didn't have adobo sauce (a shame because I love spicy food), and I used a different noodle (radiatore noodle) but this recipe is great because I wouldn't have necessarily thought to use the panko bread crumbs and the condensed milk, but it made for an excellent recipe.

Excellent! Very creamy and cheesy, with a subtle, underlying Chipotle flavor. And this recipe was so amazingly easy, too! 

The panko breadcrumbs must not be omitted. I swear, they are what truly make this dish awesome. My only change was that I had just 8 ounces of Colby, so I used that along with 8 ounces of sharp cheddar. I do love a sharp cheese, so I'll probably make it that way there next time as well.  And there will definitely be a next time!

Makes a bit more than 2qt. But that’s a good thing. VERY POPULAR at this house. Will try a version with corn and/or chopped peppers next time for a variety. But this one was a hit!  Added Cholula as we do in this house. Extra flavor without extra heat.

I made it just as written.  I tripled the recipe for an office pitch in.  Everyone loved it and have now commissioned me to bring it to all future events. I made an extra pan for the fam.  All 4 kids, 11 and under and spouse loved it as well.  The smokey flavor from the Chipotle peppers made this awesome.  Thanks for sharing.

This is delightful, but there are folks who think it's too hot.  My family enjoys spicy food, and the cheese is particularly good, creamy, but not terribly wet.  How's so well with bbq or other vinegar based meat sauces

Now, i hate to be one of those people that say “I loved it! But I made a few changes to the recipe.” But I did, and it was DELICIOUS. I made everything by the recipe but the only changes I made was that I added 5 chipotle peppers instead of one because my boyfriend and I like spicy. I also added applewood smoked bacon and fresh from the garden garlic chives which gave this recipe a huge boost of flavor. I am definitely making this again. We loved it!

I added more chipotle and used the 4 cheese Mexican blend instead of Colby (I don't like Colby that much), and we LOVED it.

Didn't change a thing and I'm a fan.  The Chipotle peppers gave it a kick so this might not be for you if you don't like spicy.  I had to use a 3qt dish for this.

Oh, my gosh, this is fantastic!  We are pretty much mac and cheese afficionadoes, with tops in the five-white-cheese, tomato sauce, or "enhanced" mac and cheese (with sausage, etc.) - but we think this is our new fave!  Made it exactly as the recipe calls, but doubled the chipotles (we like it spicy).  Just froze the leftovers for lunches down the road.

Pretty bland (though I can't complain about the amount of cheese). I would have doubled or tripled the amount of pepper.

Amazing. I used cheddar jack shredded cheese (my choice store didn't have cheese called for) and Goya chipotle peppers in adobo sauce(in the ethnic isle) loved loved this with few people trying it in the only one that likes a kick to all foods and this is it! Reheats well!!!

My husband loves this! I use half Colby and half pepperjack cheese and at least two chipotle peppers to give it a little more kick!

01-17-16 ~ Very, very good.  I made as written and we really enjoyed it.  Next time I will double the chipotle peppers as we like more heat than this offered.  Great recipe that I will make again.  Paired it with 'Orange Baked Ham' from AR.

We love this recipe! We like to add crumbled spicy sausage for a bit more flavor and we crush bacon flavored crackers for the top. Delish!
