This was fast even with my adjustments it only took 10 minutes!  I have young kids so I changed the directions just a little....I cooked the  milk, eggs, and vanilla until boiling and then removed from heat immediately and added the cream.  Next,  I whipped up the egg whites and folded in the sugar and nutmeg.   I added the milk mixture to the egg whites and slowly stirred.  I omitted the whiskey and we loved it!

I halved the recipe & it still made a lot just for our family.  (I wasn't making it for a party or anything.)  

I left out the liquor as some other reviewers had done w/ no problem?  My family said it was too thick & not sweet enough.  I added more milk to try to thin it out & more sugar try to sweeten it up.  My husband's drinking it, but I won't try this recipe again.

I didn't add whiskey, used Meyers Dark Rum instead.  Flavor is not bad, just not hardley there.  It just tastes like melted vanilla pudding.  There are other, better recipes for eggnog here on this site.

Really just tasted like whiskey and milk. Not terrible, but no real Eggnog flavor.

I get nervous about drinking raw eggs.  When I use this recipe without the full amount of whiskey (ie. for my kids), I heat the the milk first to 160-degrees then add the other ingredients after mixing with a mixer.  I continue to gently heat back to 160, stirring constantly, and then chill everything quickly.  If you cook too hot or too long, your eggnog will have lumps.

I found this recipe to be pretty fabulous :) We did have to let it set overnight to really get those flavors flowing. I also garnished with cloves.

This was great and pretty easy. Left out the whiskey as we wanted to customize by preference. Added some nutmeg to the mix.

Quick and easy!  Plus, it was the best eggnog I've ever had.  I even gave my cat a tiny bit (no alcohol!). 

One thing: be sure to mix it really well: on my first sip, I got some unmixed egg, and it wasn't pleasant, but after I whisked it more, it was great!  I don't understand why we separate then reintegrate the yolk and white of the eggs, though.

Like others said on here it made a lot but wasn't very sweet. I'm wondering if it would taste better if I combined the sugar into the yolk mixture instead of the whites.

Make sure to use pasteurized eggs. Also, letting it ‘mellow’ for days or weeks is actually the way to go. The alcohol is more effective at killing germs when letting it set for a while. This will be my second year making this.

Delicious, easy eggnog recipe that uses the entire egg. A little more booze doesn't hurt it.

This recipe is much easier than others I tried and much lighter, but tastes just as good.
