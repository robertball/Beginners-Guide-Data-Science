I am absolutely obsessed with these waffles. I must make them about once a week! The only thing I do to add my personal touch is add a little cinnamon and a little Truvia for my sweet tooth. Otherwise, perfect!

Oh, and DOUBLE the batch at the very least, always!

Very tasty recipe, but unless you are making extremely small waffles, I don't see how you'd get six waffles out of this recipe! I'll definitely double (at least) the recipe next time.

I used earth balance butter instead of  applesauce and almond milk. It was really good!

This recipe was spot on for me. 6 waffles, great crispness and rise. I did add more vanilla but found it plenty sweet as is. Followed the tip to make it in the blender - great hack and made pouring into the waffle maker all that easier.  I added chopped apple and walnuts as topping for fiber and protein. Definitely a keeper. Thank you

I will definitely make this again. I'm looking for healthier recipes that my husband will like. He isn't crazy when I "experiment" on him, as he says. He said "Great Waffles, Hon" after his first bite. I let him enjoy a little longer, then told him what was (and wasn't) in them. 
I did add 2 T of corn meal (I didn't have corn flour) and meant to add cinnamon, but forgot, so we added it on top. I also used unsweetened vanilla almond milk, because that is what I had. I served them with pure maple syrup. YUM! 
Our waffle maker is divided into four small waffles. It made 7 small squares. We even had 3 left over and I ate one plain, just out of the waffle iron. YUM again. Thanks for the recipe!

Doubled the recipe to feed a family of 4. Tastes best fresh off the waffle iron. Turned out great!

Add 2 tablespoons of cornflour to make a crispier waffle.
