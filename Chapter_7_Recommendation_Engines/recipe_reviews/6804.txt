Best olive breat recipe yet, and if you're going to spend 3hrs making bread, you might as well make two loaves.  the first loaf will be gone right out of the oven.
NOTES:  2pkgs dry yeast; 12oz jar pitted kala olives chopped; 1.5 tblspns salt;
Brush bread with egg white for a good crust.

This recipe is really good.  To make it more savory I rolled out the dough and spashed on some olive oil and sprinkled bleu cheese crumbles, more olives and more rosemary, then rolled them up like cinnamon bread.  It's so good with any meal.

Wow, adapted this to my bread machine and it is good.  Really great toasted with mozzarella cheese. YUM!  I also made it with whole wheat flour (with added vital wheat gluten) in the machine with great results.  BTW, it worked best for my bread machine when I calculated for 10 servings, squeezed the olives out thoroughly and tossed them with the dry ingredients, and used 1 3/8 cups of water.

I made this recipe exactly as given, and it yielded two lovely loaves of bread.  Will definitely make again!  Edit:  My bread looks NOTHING like the picture, which I'm pretty sure is a picture of a completely different recipe.

Yummy!!  This bread was a hit at a superbowl party that I went to.  I added the bleu cheese as suggested by someone else who wrote a review, it was a nice touch to an already mouthwatering recipe.  We dipped the bread in seasoned olive oil, it was sooo yummy!!

This is excellent!  I like my olive bread nice and herby, so I added 1/4 tsp each of thyme, oregano, and basil. I covered the crust with sesame seeds and a bit of coarse salt. I also added some chopped bell peppers, which meant I needed to cut the water a bit. 
I would not advise anyone to mix their water first...active dry yeast does not need to be activated, and good bread making technique is to add water a bit at a time until the dough is right. Don't let the water dictate the flour content.
Even without the additions, this would be nice tasty bread....thanks for the recipe.

Brilliant recipe!  I give it five stars, even though I don't really care for kalamata olives I thought it was good.  For something new, try having good ole' green olives IN KALAMATA OLIVE'S STEAD!  It makes it AWESOME-ER.  Sorry for the childish writing style, but this is a pretty cool recipe!

This was really great! I'm not big on lots of herbiness though so I only used 1 tablespoon  of rosemary haha. But this bread was so good that I probably would have been happy with the 2 even~. Thank you for posting this!

I really like this.  A tad dry with all the flour, but if you make as directed you would just stop adding the flour at the right consistency.  I used my bread maker on the dough setting, so I think I'd stick with 7 and 1/4 c of flour.  The olives do add some liquid, so it also depends on how wet they are.  Hubs wasn't a fan, but he's not a fan of olives, so no surprise there.  I made 2 small loaves and one large loaf; I'd probably make a few rolls next time and 2 larger loaves; it might be my smaller loaf pans, but if I don't divide carefully, I get too big of loaves.  thanks for the recipe!

Great bread.  I added some roasted and chopped green chile.  If you're from New Mexico, it's a must :)
Toast it up and lightly butter - heavenly.

Love this recipe.  I now know how to make fabulous bread.  It tastes just like warm Italian bread from a restaurant.  As for the oven time it was even better than stated 12 minutes.

This has become my favorite, go to bread! I have used some of the recommendations from others to add more spices like basil, oregano, dill and garlic. I roll the dough out and put olive oil on it then sprinkle gorgonzola cheese crumbled on top, add Trader Joe's Olive tapenade spread and roll it all  up like cinnamon rolled bread.  This is so very good!
