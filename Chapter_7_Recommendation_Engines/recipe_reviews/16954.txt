I was pleasantly surprised to find that this came out just as good as the fried rice I get at my favorite local Thai restaurant.

I followed the recipe in terms of ingredients, but here are a few extra things I did:

I pounded my chicken breasts flat, cut them up into strips, and quickly stir fried them in a little olive oil and just a pinch of salt. Once they were almost cooked through, I splashed on a little bit of soy sauce and set them aside. 

I cooked my sliced onions in the butter, (instead of the eggs. I used PAM for those) Great flavor and gave the rice a little something too.

When I combined all ingredients, I also added some green onion to this dish, red pepper, and red pepper flakes.

Also! *Make sure your rice is cold when you cook this!*

GREAT recipe, will use again and again. Thanks!

Excellent, easy recipe. I rinse the rice in cold water, so I don't have to wait. I also decreased the pepper because it's got a little too much zip.

Love this one! I used thawed frozen mixed vegis and added them after everything. Made for a very quick and easy recipe. 

I do recommend that you have everything chopped and ready to add before you actually start cooking as this cooks very quickly and leaves no time in between.

My 3yo loves fried rice when we are out so this was an excellent dinner for her! And I could chop the vegis and chicken into bite sizes for her and not worry about her trying to stuff something too big into her mouth! And the rest of the family loves it just as well, even my super picky husband (who seems to never eat anythign I make! LOL)

This is one of those recipes you can easily tweek to your own tastes.  I added peas and green onions at the end with the egg.  Only used 1/2 of the pepper called for & used seasme oil instead of the veg. oil.  Thought it made a very good side.  Will make again!

very tasty fried rice. I love the combination of flavors and it tastes even better with the seasonings all incorporated in the fried rice. I made some rice then cooled it down, placed it in the refrigerator to chill. I had a lot of leftover rotisserie chicken from costco so I chopped that up in cubes. In a small bowl I beat 2 eggs with a little water and melted a little butter in a skillet. I placed the egg mixture in the pan and heated it up until the egg set. I flip it over for another minute then set it aside to cool. In the same skillet I added sesame oil, heated it up, added a half onion, chopped and minced up. I let the onions cook down a bit before adding the next ingredients. I had a red bell pepper that I diced up and I added that, then 1 garlic clove, little grated ginger, frozen peas and carrots. When the onions were almost translucent I added in the diced chicken and then rice. I broke up the chilled rice while it was heating up in the pan to combine everything. I then seasoned with black pepper, a little salt, added 1T of soy sauce and about 2T of oyster sauce to taste. I continued to stir to mix everything in well. Lastly I added in the eggs, cut up in strips and then garnished with chopped green onions. The dish was colorful and a meal in itself with the chicken meat and veggies I added to the fried rice. A perfect tasty meal that I served along with "bacon-y bok choy", also from this website!

This was super easy and tasted yummy.  I added a some fresh ginger (since I had some) and 2 cloves of garlic.  I used sesame oil as it just adds a bit more of an asian flair!  It was great.. family loved it!

This needed some alteration, but turned out great.  And bear in mind it's a lot of work and requires significant chopping.  I added green onion and chopped ed pepper, as well as teriyaki sauce.  I also added some red pepper flakes for spice.  And at the last minute, I added some pineapple and pineapple juice and cashews for a special treat.  My boyfriend loved it!  It made a lot.

This is a simple, quick fried rice recipe that the whole family liked.  I omitted the chicken, and added shrimp and frozen peas. Used it as a side dish to sweet and sour chicken. I will definitely use this one again!

This was a very tasty and simple recipe.  I added some chopped up garlic to the onions as I sauteed them.  Also I recommend using A LOT less pepper as it is VERY spicy if you don't.  You really don't have to put any pepper in if you don't want to.  It's quite flavorful without it.

Best I have ever made! I cooked 4 chicken breast halves and then put the aside and chopped them up. I then cooked 3 eggs flat, shredded and put them aside. I cooked 2 cups frozen mixed veggies with the onion, added a little over 1.4 cup soy sauce, pepper, ginger, and garlic powder. I then added 5 cups of cold rice and cooked 5 min. Lastly, I mixed in the egg. PERFECT and THIS is the right amount for a family AND to have a little leftovers! You WILL want leftovers! Yummm.

This dish is much easier if you stir fry the chicken and vegetables in the pan, then add rice and stir. Move rice mixture to sides of pan, making a well in center. Add more oil if necessary, then scrambled eggs in well, incorporating the egg into the rice as it cooks.

One of my favorite recipes. If you want bits of cooked egg, make a hole in the rice and break the egg directly onto the pan surface, stiring as it cooks. If you break the egg over the rice and stir it in to cook, it imparts a wonderful rich flavor, but you don't get the nice hunks of egg.

Very good.  I made it without the chicken, but 
added some leftover green peas.  I served
it with asian flavored grilled chicken.
I look forward to making it with the
chicken next time.

Very good.  Added 1/4 head of finely shredded cabbage.  Wilted cabbage in hot pan before adding to mixture.  Next time I will add another egg, just preference. YUM, the whole family loved it.

If you mix in 1 Tbsp OYSTER SAUCE with your 2 Tbsp soy sauce it tastes just like chinese restaurant style fried rice...also green onions are a must, along with fresh or powdered garlic

Used sesame oil.  Gives it more of an asian flavor.  Also I was just making plain fried rice.  The second time I made it I upped the egg to 2.  Which my family prefers.  Also used a lot more soy than what it said to add.  Didn't add chicken as I was making as a side of plain fried rice.  Very good dish.   And YES rice must be cold!

My husband & I both loved this rice!  My husband said it tasted "magical" and asked me to make it again ASAP. I served it with Perdue General Tso Chicken (heated the frozen chicken with its ginger teriyaki sauce) and a bag of fresh mixed vegetables (carrots, brocoli, green beans mixture) which I stir fried in bottled teriyaki sauce. It was a great & easy quick meal with very little effort or time spent preparing it. Wish we would have had egg rolls or spring rolls with it too. 

The only changes that I made to this rice recipe were: 1 tsp of garlic powder, 1 tsp of sesame oil, 1 cup of fresh tiny peas: just because the fried rice that we order from our local Chinese food takeout, has those additions. And I think these 3 additions pushed this recipe from a 4 star into a five star, for our tastes.

I wish there were leftovers! But my husband ate it all...

I made this dish with a few changes: I used canned chicken, added frozen California blend veggies, used 2 tablespoons of teriyaki sauce and 1 tablespoon of hoisin garlic sauce, and I fried it about 12 minutes.  It was so good!  My EXTREMELY picky fiance loved it, and my friend who just got back from traveling in Asia devoured it.  Well done.

I'm trying to rate this without comparing it to take-out, which is what I was hoping it would be more like! It was very good. I did halve the pepper because I thought it sounded like too much. I also added some frozen peas and carrots to have some veggies. I felt it was lacking something though, not sure what. Will definitely try again with some changes based on reviews maybe?

** Tried with Sesame Oil instead of Vegetable Oil, that would have brought it down to 3 stars. I wasn't a big fan and will stick with Veggie Oil next time!

To get the authentic taste of Fried Rice, you need to use a dash of Sesame Oil with the Vegetable Oil - a dash to a teaspoon depending on the amount of Fried Rice you are making - and you need to add Ginger, either fresh or dried. Use a tablespoon of Ginger either fresh or dried. Otherwise, this is a nice recipe.

YUM.  I cooked the chicken in the wok with a T of olive oil.  When I took the chicken out and put the egg in, I did NOT add butter.... just cooked the egg in the left over olive oil/chicken fat.  When it came time for the veggie oil, I substituted sesame oil.  I used COLD rice, like many recommended.  This will be a staple in our house for sure!

This is a simple, quick, and delicious recipe.  My wife just love this, that I end up making it at least once a week.

Also... in addition... I substitute the butter and veggie oil with SESAME OIL and add a little extra soy sauce (than what the recipe calls for).

Great! Just don't use the full amount of ground pepper. It's way too much.

Delicious! My first successful attempt at this fairly easy dish.
Use DAY-OLD/LFTOVER, COLD rice that has had a chance to dry out a bit! I made two cups of rice in the microwave the night before & popped it in the fridge. After reading several reviews, I decided to use sesame oil ~ this is a MUST, imho. Along with sautéing the onions, I added two cloves of minced garlic and a sprinkling of powdered ginger. This is what created that yummy authentic Chinese food aroma ~ and flavor. I also used frozen peas & carrots and upped the egg to 3. Used about a 11/2 lbs of chicken breast I had mostly thawed and then sliced thin.
This was quick, easy and tasted AMAZING ~ just like take-out!
Adjust the black pepper to your liking.
This made a ton for the two of us....lots of leftovers and I read it freezes easy. I would also try to add a tablespoon of oyster sauce next time. Great recipe ~ I didn't follow it exactly, but thank you for giving me the basics.
Will make this again and again!

I thought this recipe had too much pepper, too much soy sauce and it really needed some vegetables.

This very good, especially with some mixed vegetables thrown in! I also added some sausage and Tabasco for a little kick.

This is a great recipe!  I doubled it and served it at our church potluck - only one serving was left in the dish.  As others suggested, I only used olive oil where fat was required.  I added diced carrots - sauted them with the onion.  I used brown basmati rice instead of white rice (better flavor and health benefits).  After the stir fry was done, I mixed in sliced green onion. I had just enough soy sauce for a dbl recipe - but it turned out really good, I wouldn't add anymore the next time.

This was good, but nothing like the dish you get at the chinese restaurants.  Hubby's comment was that it didn't taste like chicken fried rice...and I have to agree.  Reduced the amount of salt and needs something else.  My 1 yr old loved it and was mad when it was all gone.  Thanks for the post.

I love this recipe! I do prefer two eggs, you can barely notice it otherwise. We all dislike peas here so I usually add green pepper and added carrots this time (eating it as I type). Instead of plain chicken I used an orange chicken recipe and it blew it up!
Oh, and add a splash of seasame seed oil. Gives it such a better Asian flavor.

Loved this!  All of my kids, down to 2 years old, loved it!  I used "Uncle Bens Wild Rice" and used the packets that came in that also, for seasoning, and instead of chicken, I used cooked carrots, corn, and peas.  I doubled the recipe and my family ate it all for dinner and lunch the next day. Thanks for the recipe! I'll make this again and again :)

Good base recipe..I doubled the recipe.  I started by frying the chicken in Tastefully Simple Honey Teriyaki Sauce.  Pulled the chicken out and stir fried carrots, green onions, fresh green beans, cabbage and mushrooms.  Then added rice, egg, soy sauce, ginger and garlic powder.  Very good!

One tablespoon butter for the egg is too much, I found it to be greasy.  I cut the onion back to one half because I added other vegetables, red peppers and green beans.  I love that you can add any veg that you have on hand and it would work.  I did make my rice earlier in the day, I'm not sure if or why that part is important, but according to the top three reviews, it's crucial.  This didn't taste like the rice I find at my local chinese restaurant but it was still really good none the less.

Very easy to make.  I left out the chicken and used it as a side dish.  I also added green onions and a bit of garlic powder.

With some changes in amounts this is the first recipe I remember making as a teen with my dad.  Also, you can use Pork instead of Chicken or a combination of both.

Delicious! Family loved this recipe for supper tonight. I made a few changes based on suggestions from other reviewers and to make this a meal. I cooked brown rice a few hours in advance to ensure it was cold. Cooked egg in same pan as chicken without adding butter. Sauteed 3 chopped green onions, added 1 diced pepper (orange was on sale and added nice colour) and then 1 cup of frozen peas, added an additional tbsp of Japanese soy sauce. Thanks submitter and reviewers :)

I have to admit I was a tad nervous making this. I'm SO glad I did. It is delicious!!!! I had wanted to use green onion but didn't have any, so I used frozen chopped onions ( I hate chopping them myself ) baby bellas, and white mushrooms and petite frozen peas. I also used low sodium soy sause and just a couple of dashes of black pepper when I cooked the egg. I will never pay for Fried Rice again!!! I can't believe I waited so long to make this! Thank you for submitting this!!! It's wonderful!! :)

I'm not a huge fan of fried rice, but I really liked this one.  When making the rice, I replaced 1/3 of the water required with chicken broth since I served this only as fried rice, leaving out the chicken.

Simply some of the best tasting fried rice!  Two things you MUST do in order for it to work...use sesame oil and definitely use the rice cold.  I cheat and throw it in the freezer!  Also can chop up pork as well.

This recipe is a great place to start if you've never made chicken fried rice before and want to learn how. Once you've made it a couple of times it becomes very intuitive and you can easily tweak it to your liking.  I prefer this with brown rice, more egg, lots of added veggies, and WAY less black pepper.

I've made fried rice before and failed miserably, fortunately this time it turned out great! Good, easy to follow directions which allow for some creativity. I added carrots and peas to mine which not only taste delicious but look great too! For the chicken I used scraps from a store-bought baked chicken (so easy, even if it's cheating). I don't care for onions in stir-fry so I kept them out and it was still very flavorful. Thanks for the great recipe!

My family really enjoyed this. I let the chicken marinade in the soy sauce while I got everything together, I also added 1/2 Tbspl of sesame oil while stir frying for extra flavor as well as a teaspoon of crushed garlic and a 1/2 red bell pepper (I cooked these with the onion). Next time I would add another egg.

This recipe tastes good, but it isn't what I thought it would be. Not at all like fried rice in the restuarant. I also tried adding peas, but it didn't seem to help.

Easy to make and tastes wonderful! The only change I made was adding some veggies. I've never seen a fried rice that didn't have a few veggies. I used green peas and red bell pepper. My husband loved it. We'll definitely be having this again.

Great recipe and simple!  Only tweaks I will make / made are to use long-cook rice instead of instant and let it "fry" a bit longer.  I didn't use the recommended pepper.  Instead, I just gave a few turns of my pepper grinder and it was great!  I also added green peppers and sliced carrots during the sauté part. I also used a rotisserie chicken, so if I make with fresh chicken, I will make sure to season it as it cooks. Otherwise, very tasty and recommended by the husband for repeats.

This is so fast and easy! Everyone enjoyed it. It's best when made with day old, cold rice. It can be a bit gummy when made with freshly cooked warm rice. I add 3 eggs instead of one, just due to family preference. Thanks for sharing!

I didn't even get to cook it.  I followed the "15 minutes" start to finish guideline.  However, what isn't figured in is the time to cook the rice and make sure it's cold, and the time to cook the chicken.  I hate it when recipes misguide you on how long it takes to prepare them.  And, yes, I know it says "cooked" in front of the rice and the chicken, but unless you're going to go to a restaurant and buy those things, this is NOT a 15 minute recipe.  Let's be truthful.

A GREAT way to use up leftover meat!  I followed the recipe with very few exceptions: I added minced garlic to the sauté and frozen peas, diced pork and diced steak in the place of chicken to the stir fry (since I had leftovers of both meats; largely diced).  This turned out terrific and when I asked my husband how it compared to carry-out, he said he liked it better :D  •  The next time I make this, I will probably spray Pam instead of use butter, sauté some diced zucchini in with the onions and remember, for the love of Pete, to use COLD rice.

Loved this recipe and loved the fact it was so simple. Did not use egg b/c I don't like it but I make fried rice a lot, the difference this time is that I actually heated my BROWN RICE normally and then I put it in the freezer and let it get cold. I also used much more soy sauce & this recipe was great, even though very similar to the recipe that I currently use. Got compliments from a guest on this meal!

Our family loves this recipe.  I always make a double batch.  After making it a number of times, I've made the following changes:  I add steamed chopped carrots, decrease the pepper & onion.  I also double the egg, but these are all just personal preferences.  The recipe itself was delicious!  I think I might just have to make it again tonight.

Excellent, easy, delicious. Thanks to others for the frequent reminders to start with cold rice. I will decrease the amount of pepper next time, but I would not say it's too much. Just a bit much for my taste.

Delicious!!!  I made this with 3 scrambled eggs, added peas and red pepper, and used cooked frozen shrimp. So good, I made it twice in one week, and I can't wait to make it again!  Make sure your rice is cold, though.

I love this recipe! I usually double or triple it and add lots of things: bean sprouts, frozen peas and/or carrots, chunks of pineapple.  Sometimes I use shrimp instead of chicken.  VERY delicious!

This was a great base to start with!  I didn't add chicken but added some thinly sliced carrots and mushrooms.  I followed another reviewer's advice and added garlic as well and used sesame oil instead.  Delicious!

This is very good - not exactly like what we get at our favorite Chinese restaurant, but still very good.  I've made it twice now - once with chicken and once with diced ham-both times adding oyster sauce, shredded carrots, frozen peas and scallions.  Both versions were a hit!

Very fun base recipe.  I used ground chix thighs instead of chix chunks, used 1/2 whole wheat rice & added mixed veggies as suggested by other reviews.  Will make again with my additions as I can serve it as a full meal.

I aimed to make this as healthy as possible without losing any taste.  

I used fresh red (bell) pepper, mushrooms, onion, broccoli, carrots, 2 cloves of garlic, ginger spice and red pepper flakes.  Sauteed until soft in olive oil.  Mixed in cold brown rice, some left over rotisserie chicken, canned peas and added soy sauce.  As this cooked together on medium heat, I made a hole in center of the rice, sprayed some Pam and cooked 2 eggs.  As they cooked, I stirred them into the rice mixture.  Kept on the stove a few minutes to ensure the eggs were cooked  - turned out fantastic!

I don't know how this recipe has such a good rating. As is it is really bad. You must reduce the pepper by at least half to make it edible , and I like pepper. I made the mistake of just going by the recipe and adding all that ppper without thinking. :(  Adding, green onions, and a veggie or two is also needed. Wanted it to be great..it's not.

This is a good recipe, but wayyyy too much pepper. I didn't put in the whole teaspoon and it the whole dish tasted like pepper. Will use 2 eggs next time and add some vegetables.

I am reviewing based on the recipe as written. everyone gave it all the stars after tweeking a little. Well As written it is actually quite good! I am only used to local Chinese restaurants to compare and its the only thing I order. This was pretty close but I dont think veg oil is the oil most places use. Overall pretty good! The closest to restaurant quality!

Very tasty and very simple to make.  I probably added more soy sauce than the recipe called for... maybe 4 tablespoons instead of only 2.  Also, I forgot to make rice beforehand, so I put freshly made rice in the freezer for an hour to chill it and it worked out just fine.  This was a hit with the hubby and I will definitely make it again!

This was pretty good, but as the other reviews state, REDUCE the pepper.  Although a tablespoon of oil and butter is standard, I think that you should also reduce these for healthier eating. I will make this again, but I will probably add bean sprouts or make it with pork next time.

I enjoyed this. As with everything, I was lazy when I first made this so I didn't bother mixing the eggs and water. It turned out fine. I browned the onions without the vegetable oil and it turned out fine as well. When I made it the way I was supposed to, no one seemed to like it as much.

Fried Rice is the only kind of rice I will eat. I loved this. I used a little more soy sauce that it called for. It was great.  It is also great with shrimp.

I really loved this recipe.  I used onion, green and red bell pepper.  I guessed on the amt of black pepper and I used sesame oil (enough to coat the skillet) to stir fry.  Right before eating I added some table salt because I did not use as much soy sauce.  But this recipe had a great mild flavor and wonderful texture.  I will make this again.

Very good recipe. Perhaps a bit to much pepper though. I added peas to mine.

i love this recipe! i'm 14 and not a very experienced cook but got bored one day and decided to make it, it was super easy. i messed up and accidentally used freshly cooked rice(not cooled) instead but it still tasted amazing. the first time i made it i put in 1 teaspoon of black ground pepper and the taste was a bit too overwhelming and had me sniffling from the spices, so the second time i made it i only added 1/2 a teaspoon and the problem fixed itself. if you're not the most advanced or experienced cook, like myself, then i highly recommend this easy delicious recipe:)

I was quite surprised at how well this turned out for such a simple recipe.  I started with day-old cold rice and added a small bag of frozen vegetables.

As an Indonesian living in Europe, sometimes i miss Asian flavour for my meal. I tried this recipe with some alterations. Instead of using vegie oil, i used olive oil and for the chicken meat, i used chicken grilled. However, for my native asian taste, the recipe was not salty enough. I will add pinch of salt for next time. But all i can say is this recipe was a great help! Love it!

Excellent! Very easy to prepare and tasted like the fried rice at my favorite Chinese restaurant. Can be fixed with chicken, shrimp, pork....whatever you wish. I added a small can of mixed veggies as well.

I loved this!!!! After reading a lot of reviews I knew this was a keeper. I added chopped carrots and chopped water chestnuts and a lot more soy sauce - personal preference. I did add an extra egg as well.  Hubby wasn't impressed but that won't stop me from making it frequently!
Edited to add that I used garlic pepper instead of just pepper and used sesme oil instead of vegetable oil.  Just had some reheated for lunch.....love this stuff!

This recipe was EXCELLENT! My kids (4 teenagers) kept going back for more. I cheated a little and went to a Chinese restaurant nearby and bought 4 cups of steamed rice ($2.60) and put it straight in the refrigerator when I got home.  I used sesame oil, 4 eggs (I doubled the recipe), and 1 tsp pepper (for the doubled recipe)…the recipe calls for too much pepper. I may add peas and carrots next time and may try shrimp for a change. It definitely can be tailored to your taste. I also used gluten free soy sauce for my daughter who has celiac.   Very delicious and will make again and again!

Good basic recipe for fried rice.  Gonna give it a try with quinoa.  I do not know how the submitter could have made it plainer that the rice needs to be chilled, but apparently some folks don't read directions well?
2016 update: made with quinoa in place of rice, delicious! Even hubs, who does not like Chinese food at all and only tolerates quinoa, had seconds. Used leftover pork chops. Yummy

The recipe was very easy to follow and cook. It turned out fantastic and was super good. The only thing I will change the next time I fix it is to decrease the pepper. The amount it called for made it a bit to peppery for our taste.

Made a double-batch, using a rotisserie chicken. I made the rice a day before, and added 1/2 pkg frozen stir-fry veggies and a drained 4oz can of sliced mushrooms, and I used reduced-sodium teriyaki sauce instead of soy. We scarfed down the first batch, and I froze the second for a quick meal later on. Keeper!

I always read the reviews before I try a recipe to get helpful hints from others and the more reviews I read the more I realized that this recipe was good as is.  This is as easy and good as a recipe gets without putting your own spin on it.  I do add sesame oil and garlic because I love the taste of both of those but other than that I do the rice just like the recipe says.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe,

I love this recipe. I made it when I didn't have a lot of cash and I was craving chinese... now no take-out can compare. I sometimes have to tweak it based on what I have on hand or what type of leftover chicken I have, but it's always amazing.

Good but definitely not as good as fried rice you would get in a restaurant. Next time I will omit the pepper since it is very overpowering in this recipe.

Excellent base for my recipe. I'm watching my figure so I altered this recipe. I seasoned 2 boneless chicken breast with McCormick Cajun seasoning, browned in 1 tbs of EVOO and set aside. In the same pan I cooked about 3 TBSP of finely mined onions (hubby isn't much of an onion fan) When the onions start to brown lightly I added 1 egg mixed with 1 tsp of water (without additional oil )  I used leftover Uncle Ben's "boil in bag" brown rice, which is exactly 2 cups. Toss the cold rice with your onions and egg for a few minutes. I added "low sodium" soy sauce ( I didn't measure, just pour a little, stir and taste) I added the chopped chicken breast, stirred for several minutes. Since I used the cajun seasoning on my chicken and it really gave my rice a nice kick. Honestly, I wasn't expecting this mellow heat but trust me when I say it was the perfect amount of spice. No black pepper needed unless you just prefer it more on the spicy side. Lastly, I added about a cup of tender broccoli , lightly tossed and served. Yall my husband ate it up! Shoot I may never buy fried again! This recipe is a winner for those who want fried rice but without ruining their diet. The boil in bag rice is a real life saver. Boil an extra bag the night before and have an awesome dinner the next day. Thank you bunches to the creator of the recipe! XOXO

The only thing I did different was double the egg mix. This recipe is largely off scale. Far more onion than chicken and egg together. I don't know of many Chinese restaurants that would fair well doing the same. Then the pepper was far too much...as was the onion. I don't even know how this could be salvaged because beyond the scale inconsistency is the blah. My mouth tastes of pepper. Yep, just pepper.

Just in case this happens to you!

Right when I started cooking I realized I didn't have enough soy sauce. I thought I was in for a disaster! However, I simply added just a TAD of sesame oil (it's very strong) and some olive oil. I have to admit that I also added another tablespoon of butter right at the end. It's still wayyyy less butter than they use at our Japanese steakhouse. 

Anyways, the short of it is that it was FABULOUS!!! Super tasty and I didn't even do it right! The next time I make it I'll be sure I have enough soy sauce and also think I will add some frozen mixed vegetables. Either way it was a very satisfying and my asian food loving husband approved!

This was a yummy rice for our shrimp stir-fry. I've been trying to duplicate restaurant-style fried rice at home: while very good this recipe lacks something, maybe garlic/ginger in with the soy sauce? Thanks for sharing.

I aimed to make this as healthy as possible without losing any taste. I used fresh red (bell) pepper, mushrooms, onion, broccoli, carrots, 2 cloves of garlic, ginger spice and red pepper flakes. Sauteed until soft in olive oil. Mixed in cold brown rice, some left over rotisserie chicken, canned peas and added soy sauce. As this cooked together on medium heat, I made a hole in center of the rice, sprayed some Pam and cooked 2 eggs. As they cooked, I stirred them into the rice mixture. Kept on the stove a few minutes to ensure the eggs were cooked - turned out fantastic!

this was easy but there were no veggies included in the recipe so i added a bag of frozen stir fry veggies and it made it healthier.  i also doubled the egg with the added veggies.  my husband said it was just like stir fry at a restaurant.  thanks for sharing

4 stars as is, 5 with additions. Its a good base recipe. I didnt feel like dirtying a bunch of pans, so I sauteed the onions and 3 cloves of garlic in some sesame oil, then added thinly cut chicken strips and let the chicken cook a bit..douses with a little soy sauce, salt,  black pepper, and white pepper. Also added sliced green onion and chopped bell peppers. then i tossed in the rice and added soy sauce and some chinese salt on top. next time i make it i will put soy sauce and a little bit of the chinese salt in with the chicken mix before dumping rice in. then i made egg in a separate pan and threw it in with the rice. was yummy.

Great recipe! I added 1/2 c. peas, 1/3 c. chopped carrot, 1/2 c. bean sprouts and 3/4 c. chicken. Also I bumped the butter up to 2 TBLS adding one into pan with oil when sauteing the onions and carrots.
I probably had about 3 cups of rice from 3 days ago so my rice was a little bit more, but that was ok since I had all the other veggies. Turned out really good. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This looked like Fried Rice but had no flavor. I even added garlic as someone suggested, extra soy sauce, salt and chili powder - didn't cut it.

I'm giving this 4 stars when I really don't know what it deserves...I used minute rice which was a huge mistake. Will be making again with a different kind of rice. the leftovers turned into mush.

Fast and easy but my taste buds tell me it needs way more soy sauce, though I am a saltaholic!  The recipe called for an onion but I used green onions.  I cooked my egg in pam and used the oil to stir fry.  I also added frozen peas at the last minute and cooked just long enough to heat through.

If I had known how easy it was to make delicious fried rice, I would have been doing it long ago! This was actually my first attempt at fried rice, and this is my new go-to recipe for it! Just so good :)

Delicious!!  The taste is a bit plain if not added of salt.  I also added a couple dash of white pepper powder, garlic and sesame oil in this recipe as other reviewer said.  Will make this recipe again and again.  Thanks for sharing with us.

This is a fantastic base recipe.  I added carrots and small pieces of broccoli and used green onions for garnish.  I also used a dash of toasted sesame oil. For the chicken I used a roasted store bought chicken.  It was convenient and very flavorful.   Delicious.

This recipes was very easy and SO DELICIOUS! Make sure that you use all of the onion, even though when you're putting it in it will seem like too much. I used half of the onion the first time, and my mouth was burning the rest of the meal! It was still delicious and the second time was a lot better with the whole onion. Extremely easy and tasty!

Good. I will add peas next time and maybe try shrimp instead of chicken for variety. I used brown rice instead of white and it was very tasty.

This was pretty good--a bit salty in the end, it seemed. Serving it with sweet and sour chicken was a good contrast, though, so I still enjoyed it quite a bit.

So much simpler than I thought fried rice would be!  I added shrimp, mushrooms, sliced carrots, and a little crushed garlic when sauteeing the onions.  I made fresh rice, spread it on a plate and stuck it in the freezer while preparing the other ingredients.  By the time I was ready for it, it was cold, and I had no problems with it being too sticky or uncooperative.  This will definitely become a regular part of my rotation!

This was really good!  I didn't have oyster sauce, so I subbed with soy sauce and used white wine instead of the sherry.  I also added a tsp. of worchestershire sauce.  I added ginger in with the marinade and red and yellow peppers as well as mushrooms in with the broccoli.  It turned out great!

This was just okay. It wasn't really what I was expecting. I took the advice of others and made sure my rice was cold. I used brown rice instead of white rice, so I'm wondering if maybe that had something to do with the turn out. I ended up adding several spices and sauces to try and make it taste better, but I guess this one just isn't for me.

Very very good! This tasted just as good as any fried rice from a restaurant, and was super simple to make. I added some green onion for color (and because I just happened to have some that needed to be used up), and added a little extra soy sauce and used 2 eggs instead of just one. Delicious and easy!

Ok, I'm not giving this the full 5 stars because mine turned out just a tad bit on the dry side. I think it is a good place to start but definitely needs some improvements: I coated the chicken breasts in olive oil, put salt and pepper on them, and baked them at 350 for about about 40 minutes, then I cubed them. I sauteed the onion in sesame oil. I fried a couple of pieces of bacon and crumbled them in at the end. I also added frozen peas, carrots, and some fresh mushrooms and sprinkled on some green onions for garnish...YUMMO!

This was a great way to use up some leftovers in the fridge. The cooked rice was leftover from some Chinese takeout we got last weekend (does anyone ever eat ALL the white rice that comes with it?) and the cooked chicken meat was leftover from chicken quesidillas from earlier this week. Very quick and easy. I omitted the butter and instead just drizzled some oil over the pan before starting.  I also added some leftover corn from the fridge.

Halved the pepper and onion, doubled the egg, added 2 tablespoons of teriyaki sauce. We loved it! I should have made more. What we intended to have for leftovers we ate as seconds. 5 stars as I made it. 4 for the original.

Perfect with our family's favorite stir-fry veggie meal. I omitted the chicken. Otherwise I didn't change anything.

I have tried to make fried rice for years, and every recipe I've tried has failed. When I saw this one I decided to give it a go, and it was a success! I'm also glad I read one of the reviews that re-instated the importance of using COLD rice. That might have been my main problem in issues past. Anyway, this recipe taste just like the fried rice at Chinese food restaurants and my husband and I enjoyed it so much, we've had it for dinner two nights in a row! Thanks Lisa!

this was really good and reallyu easy. You can pretty much use it as a starter recipie then add whatever you want to it! I added green onion and garlic. I only used half the amount of of soy sauce and added ginger and teryaki sauce. I too added a 2nd egg.

I made some tweaks to this recipe to suit my taste.  But i wanted to share with everyone reading this that using Unlce Bens Converted rice makes a HUGE difference.  I also like to add toasted sesame seeds to the finished dish.  Hope this helps.

This is my husbands favorite!  I decrease the pepper because I have 3 kids.  I really think the pepper is a little much even for me.  Other than that this recipe is great.  Like everyone has siad, make sure the rice is cold (i put mine in the refrigerator).  I also like to add frozen peas.  We make this pretty often even as a main dish.

Very good and simple. I like to add more veggies (peas, green onions, small diced carrots) and sometimes add shrimp. I don't add the black pepper. I usually add a little oil to the wok, crack the egg directly into the oil (without water) and fry it there stirring it constantly so it scrambles. Then I add the cold white rice (brown works too) and then the rest of the ingredients seasoning with soy sauce to taste. Another variable is to skip the soy sauce and add cajun seasoning instead, to taste. Yet, another option is to add curry powder instead of the soy sauce. I've made it all three different ways (as well as without any seasoning at all if you are serving the rice with a heavily seasoned or sauced meat). It is really great and versatile.

This was rather boring in flavor. For basic ingredients it was as close to fried rice and chicken as possible. I left out the black pepper, because I don't care for it. But, it was pretty much just chicken with rice with onions, and I only used half the onion listed. The egg can be cooked easier to by making the rice mixture first. Then, make a well in the center to cook egg and then mix the rice in it quickly when it is almost cooked. I also think it definitely needs some frozen defrosted peas and carrots, maybe some green onion to replace some of the white, and then some other flavor, I would have to figure that out, to give it that authentic taste.

This was okay--there aren't a lot of complex flavors going on--I wished that there was another spice or something to give it deeper flavor. I doubled the recipe and also added frozen veggies (peas, carrots and beans). I kept the pepper at 1 teaspoon which was, even with the recipe doubled, far too much.

I tried this exactly as the recipe stated. It tasted WAY too much like eating a spoonful of soy sauce for my taste. I added:   1 tsp of garlic powder, 1/2 tsp ground ginger, 1 tbsp oyster sauce, 1 tsp sesame oil. I also used a bag of frozen broccoli, which I added to the end with the eggs. The original recipe earned a 3 star, but I think my additions made it a 5 star. I gave it a 4 because it was a great base to start with. Thanks.

This is a helpful recipe since the ingredients are on hand, but I was underwhelmed at the taste.  There was far too much onion - and way too peppery!  I did add canned chicken breast and turned this into a main entree.  Next time, I'll reduce the pepper onion by at least half.

This is the first recipe that I have used from allrecipes.com and it was a major hit. This was so good that everyone who got to eat some of this actually asked me to make it for them again the next day, My friends actually compare this to what you get from a Chinese food restaurant.

Super easy meal to use up leftover rice and chicken! I bet it would freeze well, too. I just scrambled the egg and set aside and didn't bother with cutting into shreds. Per other reviews, I left out the pepper and added a splash of sesame oil with the veg. oil. Also shredded the onion (picky kids hate to find pieces of onion in their dinner) I added 2 cloves of garlic, minced with the onion and grated half of a large carrot. Threw in some frozen peas and voila! Easy one pot meal.

I followed this recipe to a T while doubling it and I'm sorry to say that it most certainly does not taste like a Chinese restaurants chicken fried rice. It was just ok, but nothing spectacular. My rice was completely cold so I know there wasn't a problem there.

Good recipe to start.  You'll obviously want to customize it to your liking.  For me - add lots of green onions as well as peas and carrots and a bit more soy sauce.  Better than lots of my local restaurants!  Yummy!

this is my boyfriends new favorite recipe, really, he's had me make it 3 times in the past 2 weeks. i always make the rice the day before, or the morning of. i also tripple this recipe, just because it is good as leftovers. changes: the egg definitely takes longer than 1 to 2 minutes. i use pam instead of butter. i'm not a fan of mixed veggies so i use extra onion. i also add shredded carrots(the kind in the bag near the salad). and add green onions in the end. very very good & super easy to modify!

This recipe is quick and delicious.  It's also easy to adapt.  I prefer to use healthier grains, so I've made it with brown basmati rice and also with quinoa.  Both were delicious.  When the onion was soft and translucent,  I added  sliced mushrooms and bell peppers along with minced gingerroot and garlic.  Served with stirfried vegetables, this made for a complete, healthy, and delicious meal.  Thanks for sharing, Lisa!

I use this recipe each time I make fried rice, even if I don't add the chicken. I don't put the egg in first I wait until it is almost done then I clear the center of the pan and cook the egg then mix the rice in. I also use peanut oil instead of vegetable oil. I bought it for another recipe and could only find a large container so I now use it for all of my chinese recipes, it was so expensive.

Thought this was fantastic!  This was my first time making fried rice and it's definitely on the rotation now!  I was trying to make a one pot meal so I threw in some thawed frozen veggies like another reviewer suggested and was very pleased with how it turned out!

Very quick and easily customizable recipe.  My wife and I loved it!  Instead of cooking the egg separately, I poured the eggs in with cooked rice so the egg would cook with the rice.  Feel free to substitude chicken for pork, too.

Very good, very easy.  I used day old rice and excluded the chicken from the recipe, as I was serving the rice as a side dish to chicken.  Followed the direction exactly.  Excellent fried rice.  As good as any take-out I've eaten.  This is a asian-food-night staple!  Served with baked teriyaki chicken on top, and mixed in soy-glazed mushrooms instead of the typical peas/carrots.  A great meal!

I was surprised how good this turned out as it's such a simple recipe.  I used part chicken strips and part turkey sausage (casing removed) and added some chili flakes for heat.  Also used brown rice since that's all I had....gave it a nuttier flavor....yum!!

This is Awesome. Its super kid friendly and I was very fast even though I had to stir fry some diced chicken breast because I didn't have any cooked ready. I added Bell peppers that I stir fried after the chicken and I added 2 garlic cloves that I also stir fried. I am a soy Sauce lover so I increased that as well. My kids loved it and asked for 3rds. Add a salad and you have a whole dinner that's easy and good for you :)

Fried  rice is great comfort food! My boyfriend used to work at a very popular asian/sushi bar in my town as a back cook and made fried rice every day, his secret was to add a little splash of saki into the soy sauce before putting it into the pan.  It gives the rice a wonderful flavor that cant be replicated with anything else

Very good.  I use left over pork tenderloin instead of the chicken, add some frozen peas and carrots, and add an extra egg.  I also use a red onion, as the red, orange and green add a nice color to the plate.  Everyone enjoys it, so I make it pretty often.

I used to eat this dish in Peru a lot, it's called "arroz chaufa". It's best if the rice is a day or 2 old (in the fridge) and COLD! I add some sesame oil, which gives a nice flavor. Instead of the onion, I added chopped green onions instead. Delicious!

I only used 3/4tsp pepper and it was still a bit too strong.  I think 1/2tsp would have been plenty.  Also I only had 1T soy sauce and it turned out fine, but it would have been even better with the amount called for.  I added 1/3 cup each of finely diced celery, diced frozen carrots, frozen peas and used two whole green onions.  Even with the extras I added, the recipe only makes about two servings, not four unless you serve it as a side instead of a main dish.  It turned out better than my favorite Chinese restaurant makes it.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was okay but i feel like its missing something. I added pea pods, green onions and jumbo shrimp but it needs something more. Maybe ginger as another reviewer suggested. I may play around with this recipe.

This is a great recipe for quick and easy chicken fried rice! I had double the amount of rice leftover so I used 4 tbsp of soy sauce alltogether. I stir fried onions, some mixed vegetables and the chicken in 2tbsp of soya sauce for 5 mins before adding in the rice.I also added some hot sauce at this point to give it an extra kick! The entire family enjoyed it. I will definitely make this again!  Thanks!

Made this for New Years Eve Dinner and it was very good.  I added peas and mushrooms.  Next time I won't put chicken in it.  It was a very simple recipe...I made the rice in my rice cooker and then put it in the refrigerator to cool down and it came together perfectly.

I gave this recipe 5 stars, but I did alter it a bit. I left out the chicken and the onion. I made it as a side to go with "Perfect Sesame Chicken", also on this site. I have made this recipe several times. My Husband Loves it!  The key is to cool off the rice first (or it will be sticky) and have your skillet hot and ready before adding. I highly recommend it as well as the Sesame Chicken recipe. Makes a great, Restaurant style meal.  My Husband and kids (age 5 & 7)  Loved the Sesame chicken!

Super yummy! I forgot I didn't have eggs when I set out to make this, so I left those out.  I added half a bag of frozen peas and carrots at the end.

I marinated chicken tenders in a balsamic vingerette dressing for a few hours, added garlic, peas and carrots.  Made a 1 dish meal out of it and it was good.  Kids did not eat it as much as I had hoped.  But good.

This was very good!

I followed the recipe exactly, usually I look at the reviews, but I was in such a hungry hurry that I didn't.   WAY TOO MUCH PEPPER.  It was delicious despite this, but I would probably cut it in half next time.  Definitely will try it again!

SO good! We had this for dinner last night and I will never make another fried rice recipe again! Very quick and easy. The only thing I changed was adding green peas, but I think next time I'll make it as written. AWESOME recipe!

This recipe was quick and simple, but I found it to be a bit bland. My husband LOVES Chinese, so I wanted to find something he'd really enjoy. I tweaked this recipe and he loved it.  I'm not much of a Chinese food lover, but done my way, I liked it quite a bit as well. Here's what I did: I added garlic, a bit of ginger, added just a dash pepper, but added LOTS more soy sauce. I also used canned chicken breast and mixed veggies.Next time I make it, I'll cook the rice in chicken broth instead of plain water, which will add more flavor. Looking forward to it!

It was very good and very easy to make but I found it just a tad bit too spicy with one tsp. pepper so I cut it down to 1/2 tsp the next time I made it and added some veggies which made it perfect (for me anyway!)

Made this tonight because I had some left-over white rice and seemed simple enough that my children would eat it. Wow! Was much better than anticipated- even my VERY picky son said it was good! Froze some extra chicken and rice so I can make this for another quick dinner!

This is a wonderful quick lunch recipe and was just enough to serve me, my husband and 2 year old daughter this afternoon. I scrambled the egg with a small bit of butter, used olive oil for sauteing and added a teaspoon of minced garlic to the onion and some peas for a green vegetable. Even though it was not recommended, I used freshly cooked minute rice and it turned out just fine. Proceed with caution on that advice though because it might depend on the right   brand/style of rice to make it work properly.

This is surprisingly flavorful for so few ingredients.

I found the pepper to be a bit much so I may reduce it next time around. I added more chicken, rice, peas, broccoli, and bell peppers to help tame the spiciness from the pepper.  It runed out very delicious and healthy with the addition of the vegetable.

Very good! I made this for a surprise supper for my boyfriend and he loved it! I added some frozen veggies to the mix but otherwise followed the directions pretty closely. Make sure you use cold rice for the best texture and give your chicken a splash of soya sauce before adding it into the stir fry. Very yummy!

Some suggestions to punch up the flavor. Use sesame or olive oil instead of butter to stir fry. Use scallions instead of the onion... that's much better! Add another egg. And this needs a whole lot more soy sauce...

They served this at the union in college and I had a craving.  This did not disappoint.  I would lighten up on the pepper.  I cooked the chicken in soy sause and cummin and added a mix of frozen vegetables.  Will definately make again.

This was the most excellent fried rice.  I tripled it luckly!!  I served it with the "10 min. Szechuan Chicken" found on this site.  I did add green onions as well as the regular onion, I just cant picture fried rice without the green in it.  I will use this recipe over and over again.  Thank you so much.

I gave this recipe four stars because my kids really liked it.  I was hoping it would have a little more flavor.  I substituted leftover turkey for the chicken and added a little cayenne pepper.  Next time I'm going to substitute green onion and bacon for the onion and chicken and add extra spices (some form of garlic, red pepper flakes, teriyaki sauce).

If you plan to make this...make sure to have Chicken and Rice cooked first. ^_^
We added Teriyaki Sauce, chopped Garlic and Garlic Salt....forgot to add the veggies...oops.
But it was really good! (Veggies would have made it even better haha)
We did have to double some of the ingredients though...but hey! My son and Hubby Loved it so I'm happy!

This was really good, but it definitely needed more soy sauce than what the recipe called for. I also added frozen veggies to add more flavor as well.

I didn't get a chance to make the rice 24 hours ahead of time, but I did make it a few hours early and then chilled it. Will have to plan ahead next time, because it probably will be even better with pre-made rice. Thanks everyone for the tips!

Delish!  The time-consuming part is allowing the rice to cool off.  It's a great dish to throw together if you have leftover rice and rotisserie chicken in the refrigerator.

This recipe was okay. It could have been better, but it could have been worse. Firstly, FAR too much pepper! I would quarter the amount the recipe calls for. SEASON TO TASTE! Secondly, no veggies other than onions leaves the dish a little bland. Lastly, it will only take the time listed if you already have everything prepared. I'd say add at least ten minutes for the rice.

It's good for a quick and simple meal. But it seems to be stuck in a culinary doldrum. It’s a good meal to make quickly and get some calories, also it makes leftovers which reheat well. But there are quicker meals I have made that are equal or more tasty. And speaking of taste, that is where I find it falling short, flavor wise I found it monotone and boring. When it comes down to it, I might make this a couple more times. But really, it's stuck between two worlds, not quite a time saver and not quite flavorful enough. 1 star for a monotone flavor palet
-1 star for other things being quicker to make

Delicious!  The whole family loved this.  I made extra, so I used 5 cups of rice, 2+ cups of frozen peas, broccoli, and cauliflower, and I purple onion chopped.  I heated the veggies in the microwave to save time.  I also added approximately 1 cup shredded cooked chicken, 1 cup diced ham,  and 1/4 C. soy sauce.  I sprinkled in some garlic powder, maybe 1/2 - 1 T.  

I covered the bottom of a very large skillet with sesame oil, then added the cold rice and heated it through.   I added the meat next, stirred it well for a minute or so, then added the veggies and sauces/spices.  Cooked until heated through, just maybe 3 minutes.

Only one thing you should edit when making this recipe. I followed another review that said use sesame oil instead and I totally agree the flavor is way better! Also make sure to add some mixed veggies its a must.

This has been my go to recipe for years, but I had a picky eater
and added shredded mushrooms, zuchinni and carrots to make it a little healthier.  They never knew.

I make fried rice at least once a week, however, I sauté a lot of onions [ my taste ], use two day old, cold, brown rice  [healthier ], and for the meat  flavor I like small diced turkey ham, preferably Jennio, for the smokiness it adds. If I use another meat, or shrimp, I might add a dash of liquid smoke, and at the very end I add a dash of sesame oil. I have rice as opposed to potatoes, very often, and this recipe is very adaptable. There is nothing that won't fit in it, perfect for leftover veggies, chopped nuts, or whatever meat is left in the fridge, chourizo goes very well, just make sure all the items are chopped to the same size.

I made it as written (a rarity here sadly) and liked it alot...very tasty as Lisa said.  I have a few personal ideas that I will try...ginger and celery with the onion,  then peas, carrots.  Thank you LT for your submission.

I am not a fan of rice or Chinese food, but I made this dish as a healthy alternative to my husband's favorite Chinese spot and it came out GREAT! The family loved it. Made it again since then.

I could not fully follow the recipe because I was out of onion, but I did use green onion. I really liked the rice, but I will definitely make sure to have onion on hand next time.

Knowing how my family is about onions I decided to use only half and cut them only into large pieces if they wanted to remove them. The flavor was still there and they loved it. For more flavor, add a pinch of salt and pepper to the egg mixture. I also added carrots. :)

I made this tonight with a few adjustments since I am watching my calorie intake.  I used brown rice instead of white, and low sodium soy sauce.  I used 2 eggs instead of 1 for extra protein, and also left out the butter.

I used rice that I just cooked, not cold rice like the recipe called for, and it came out just fine!  While my rice was cooking, I boiled my diced chicken breasts with about 2c. of frozen peas, carrots, and broccoli.  When I was ready to stir-fry the rice, chicken, and veggies with the oil and soy sauce, I increased the soy sauce to 3 tablespoons since the addition of the veggies yielded too much food for just 2 tablespoons. 

I'm not a big fan of onion, except for scallions, so I left the onion out of the recipe and instead garnished with fresh chopped scallions. This came out delicious without any additional seasoning!  From now on, when I'm craving Chinese food, I'll make this instead of indulging on greasy takeout!

This is a delicious, easy way to use up leftover chicken and rice.  I added 2 cloves minced garlic, sliced bell pepper, and broccoli while the onion was cooking.  I also increased the soy sauce to 4 TBSP (I used low sodium).  It took much longer for 10 minutes to cook, but it was worth it.  Next time I will try adding peas and mushrooms.

My Mom made the recipe and the Dish was alright. It was just missing something because the chicken meat was dry. I even tried to throw in some Oyster sauce in the thing and it was still very dry, the chicken that is. The chicken being dry, is the only thing that's preventing this recipe from getting FIVE stars.

But the recipe is very easy to make and it's super easy to make alterations to the recipe to make it yours.

I've made this a couple of times and could never quite tell what was missing until I came across a fried rice recipe on youtube. The missing flavor is garlic powder and sugar, i.e 2Tbs garlic and 1Tbs sugar (or more sugar if desired). Don't get me wrong, this is a very good recipe. I just like it more so with the added flavor. Also, I added a half cup of chopped carrots and celery. Hope this was helpful.

As other people have suggested, using sesame seed oil will lend a more traditional flavor.  I used it with canola while mixing all of the ingredients.  I also drizzled rice vinegar and blended it all very well.  I like this recipe better than any other versions I've tried.

I don't think it gets any easier than this! I am a personal chef for my 15 month old daughter and my 24 month old son (lol) and I am so sick and tired of the same old stuff. My son is a picky eater but loves rice so I thought rice, veggies minutes to make....great! I am obsessed! Ok, so here's what I did.... I am Chaldean American,(parents migrated here in the 60's from Iraq,Catholic Minority) so everything we literally eat has rice. I had a lot of white rice left over in the fridge, had some left over chicken thighs and nothing went to waste. I was pretty proud of myself for reusing and well, recycling.  Ok, so I first melted butter in the pan, I had chopped up fresh garlic and onion. I cooked them on low heat until they got soft. I added broccoli chopped up really small, corn and fresh sweet peas and chopped up the chicken really fine. I added more soy sauce then what the recipe called for and just a pinch of pepper since this is for my babies and not me. I skipped the eggs because my babies hate it (even though I love it) and they are getting their protein through the chicken and the simpler the stir fry is, the more they eat and that's my goal. I just tasted is, and could gobble the whole thing up! How can something so simple taste so yummy in the tummy?! Had this dish been for me and my husband I would of added every vegetable and added baby shrimps or something. Happy eating people! xoxo

I made this recipe, but I almost doubled the rice- added bacon, and a bag of frozen peas. It was delicious, besides the fact that you do not need that much pepper- I would cut that in half.

The recipe itself was vague, but useful. I have made stir fried rice before and never knew the rice had to be cold. It turned out the best this time. I did make a few changes. I cooked the chicken with four diced green onions,3 small sliced carrots,  two stalks of sliced celery, 8oz. bag of frozen peas, 6 oz. bamboo shoots, a 1/2 tsp. oyster sauce, 1/4 c. soy sauce, ground garlic, and 1/8 tsp. ground ginger. Then, added the meat and vegetables to the rice after the rice, egg, oriental five seasons, and onion. Made a side of spring rolls! Perfect dinner!

Super simple yet delicious. I added mushrooms to the onions because I'm obsessed with them. For my chicken, I cooked a boneless skinless chicken breast in cayenne pepper, ginger, and black pepper to add a bit of sweet heat to the dish overall. Will definitely make it again.

This is the best basic Chinese Fried Rice recipe ever!  This is my go to recipe for left over rice.  I add a veggie and protein what I have on hand to make a complete meal.

Nothing beats real Chinese in my opinion, but this wasn't bad! I added a cup of mixed veggies to the stir fry for more crispness and flavor. Would of been even better a side of egg rolls!

drop the black pepper, add 1/2t chinese 5 spice, 1/2t seasoning salt or sea salt. definitely needs ginger, minced or fresh peeled and match sticked, add with onion to bring out more flavor. I would recommend match stick carrots as well, also added with onions.

This was really good and really easy. I rinsed the rice under cold water after I made it. I doubled everything except the pepper. I had a couple chicken breasts left over from another meal. Added a few frozen peas, frozen corn, garlic and an few extra dashes of soy sauce. Next time I will add another egg too. Everyone liked this dish

1st review: this was great with added chicken and vegetables. fried the raw rice until browned then  added liquid- very good! 5 stars!

2nd review: still 5 stars!  I added 2 cups of previously cooked cold rice into a skillet where I had stir fried sweet peppers, onions, chopped carrots and mushrooms, salt, pepper, garlic- added 3 shredded scrambled eggs, oyster sauce, and soy sauce and 1/2 pint home made chicken stock...delicious-even with no meat!

As written this recipe is just ok.  I can't imagine a fried rice recipe without sesame oil, which I ended up substituting for the vegetable oil.  It definitely gives it a little more of an asian flair.  Other than that, I'd watch the amount of pepper you put in it.  1 teaspoon seems like a lot.  I don't always use chicken when I make it.  I actually love to make it with ham.  MY godmother from Taiwan always made it that way and it's how I'm used to fried rice.

I did not like this recipe. I cut the pepper in half and there was still too much. Other than the pepper, there was not much other flavor.

This is really good. What I like most about it is that its a good starter recipe, you can swap the protien, or add any of your favorite veggies, and its only going to be more delicious. I use green onions in this recipe instead of white, and throw them in last. For a creamier version, toss the beaten egg directly with the rice mixture.

Everyone warned to use cold rice and me not being very experienced and short on time ignored it and it came out mushy but the taste was EXCELLENT! The only thing I changed was I used 6 cups of cooked rice and reduced the pepper to 1 1/2 tsp.

I made this for dinner last night and it was really good.  I actually added a cup of frozen peas and carrots for extra veggie goodness and it came out wonderful.  Since they were frozen I added them to the onions while they were cooking.

My family loved this, took the advice of some of the commenters and added the egg at the end along with 1/2 package defrosted mixed veggies.  I don't care much for soy sauce so I halved it and left the bottle on the table (only hubby added more).  Will make again!

Quite salty, but that's probably because a) I've only cooked one other dish from scratch in my life and b) I salted my rice a little too much. Very good though. x3

I'm not sure why people rate something above average when they change the recipe. It's very confusing. I was really disappointed with this recipe as I was looking forward to it. It just had TOO MUCH PEPPER. My mouth went numb. Next time I will drastically decrease the amount of pepper.

We love this, we must double the recipe so everyone gets some! We use approximately 1/4 to  1/2 of the pepper called for.  Just personal taste.  Both grandkids love it! That is something!!

Easy & delicious meal.  Next time I cook this meal, I think I'll add an extra egg.  I didn't feel like there was enough egg in this meal to go with all of the rice & onions.

Excellent recipe!  My husband doesn't like rice, and he liked this.  Next time, I think I'll add a bit of red pepper in with the onion/garlic saute.  A hint of spice would have really kicked it up a knotch!

It was good but very bland, at least to us. We probably compare it too much to Benihana because that's the local favorite, which of course uses triple the amounts of butter and soy sauce. This recipe is good but I probably won't be making it again. Next time I treat us to fried rice, I'll add sesame oil and more soy sauce and possibly some extra margarine. To this recipe, I also added peas and carrots and made the rice ahead of time and chilled it in the fridge.

a great basic chicken fried rice recipe. it can be tweaked to add your own favorites. I added sweet peas and omitted the onions. This is a good base recipe! Again, as others have mentioned, make sure your rice is cold.

Delicious! This was my first attempt at fried rice, so I was happy with how easy it was and how tasty the result was. I added red and green pepper (diced) and baby carrots shortly after putting the onion on.

This was good. I was tired and didn't feel like cooking - this fit the bill perfectly. Already had leftover rice. Added some chicken and garlic powder - also sautéed onion, some peppers and a bit of shredded cabbage. Hubby really enjoyed it too. Thanks for the recipe!

This was okay. It was more effort than my usual fried rice and not as good, so I probably won't be making this again.

This was a great basic recipe - exactly what I was looking for. I had brown rice leftover in my fridge, so it was already cold. I didn't have any cooked chicken, so I chopped up two small chicken breasts and cooked them up before adding all the other stuff. Like other reviewers, I was able to just add the eggs (I used 2) near the end by creating a well in the rice and scrambling them there. It distributed very well. That way I was also able to eliminate the extra butter and the extra step. I also was able get away with using only 2 teaspoons of oil in the whole dish. I think it worked well because I used a good non-stick skillet. If you don't have a non-stick skillet, you might have a harder time when using less oil and/or butter. I also didn't use anywhere near the full teaspoon of black pepper and it was still a bit too much. For some more flavor, color, and texture, I added some julienned carrots. I'd totally make this again. I'd like to try substituting beef and/or pork! Thanks for the great recipe, Lisa!

I would add more sauce, perhaps a bit of teriyaki? more oil? It was a bit dry, although my dinner date claimed it was too buttery...but all in all, pretty good flavor and texture!

My boyfriend loves this when I make it. Sometimes I don't feel like running to the store just for an onion so I just use onion salt and onion powder to give it the flavor. 

I've also used hillshire farms smoked sausage instead of chicken when I didn't have any chicken in the fridge. Was very tasty also!

This was easy and a great way to use leftover rice. I added an Asian veggie mix and some Chinese five spice as well and it was really good. I will be making this again.

very easy, very quick and pretty yummy.  Doubled the recipe except the pepper.  Less than 1 tsp pepper. Used brown rice for a healthier feel.  Gonna add chives as well next time.

Perfect & Easy! I added a frozen Chinese veggie bag (water chesnuts, snow peas, carrots, broccoli) and left out the chicken, becuase I was serving it with chicken and it really came out great!

I was very pleasantly surprised with this dish.  It had a lot of flavor, we loved it!  I added some extra soy sauce and some red pepper flakes.  I also added a couple extra eggs (personal preference) and cooked them with the rice.  I pushed the rice to the sides of the pan and scrambled the eggs in the center.  When eggs were almost done, I mixed them in with the rice and let it cook another 2-3 minutes.  Delicious!!!

This recipe was delicious!  It didn't taste exactly like the fried rice you'd get at a Chinese restaurant, but it was much less greasy. Also, it was extremely easy too cook, which is always a plus.

It has way too much pepper for one.  I tripled the recipe and guess I should not have tripled that ingredient.  It was sooo peppery.  I added peas and carrots.  No onions.

This was pretty good but not as fabulous as I had hoped because my rice was kind of mushy even though it was cold when I made the dish.  I did use brown rice though so maybe that is why. I also included a red bell pepper and some peas and excluded the onion and black pepper.

I must remember to reduce this!  It makes a whole lotta rice.  Not as good as the greasy stuff from the local Chinese Restaurant, but probably a lot better for the waistline.

I changed my original rating of 3 to a 4 after making it a second time.  I love bold flavors and this dish provides none of that.  It's chicken fried rice, so obviously it's a bit bland.  With that being said, however, this is actually a pretty good recipe.  Definitely add the pepper at the end, as it enhances the flavor.

This was very good and SO easy, but I agree that it needed a little something more. I will add more soy sauce next time, and more veggies like bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, and peanuts.

Great recipe, will make again. Only gave 4 stars because I think it needs some more veggies like carrots and peas. Oh and make sure your rice is cold it does make a huge difference.

This is my favorite fried rice recipe.  It's simple and easy and goes great with a package of frozen orange chicken and egg rolls for a quick soccer night dinner.  Make sure you cook the egg how it says in the recipe, it adds a ton of flavor.

Great start!  I made sure to pan cook the chicken with a little bit of oil, chopped onion, and celery.  I used brown rice and the consistency was perfect, even mixing while warm.  I also added some thawed (previously frozen) peas and diced carrots when the onions were almost transparent.  In the end, we loved it!

This was great as long as you cut WAY down on the black pepper. My advice is to add your pepper slowly and taste as you go. Other than this the flavors are awesome. I hate onions so I added a tsp of onion powder to the butter and it worked out great! I didn't find the amount of soy sauce to be excessive at all. If you like chinese food, you will love this.

Would have been five star if not for the pepper. WAAAAAAAYY too much pepper, almost inedible. BUT if you scale back on the pepper this is a great recipe made even better by the fact that I usually have most of the ingredients laying around. I usually add some frozen peas to this!

Good basic recipe for fried rice.  You can basically add any veggies that you want: I added green onions, mushrooms, peppers, and garlic.  I stir-fried the chicken with soy sauce, salt, and pepper.  I will be making this again.

I made a few adjustments to this and liked the results. I didn't exactly get the instructions for cutting the egg, and thought it might end up a mess if I tried it as the instructions indicated, so I began by sauting the onions and then I added the chicken, which I had seasoned with ginger, garlic and soy sauce. I also added the rice. I stir fried that all together until the chicken was almost done and then I added two eggs I'd beaten. In addition I sauted broccoli in butter and garlic sauce in a separate pan and then added that to the rice and chicken. Again, I was quite pleased.

Well I made a few changes to this, and I am sure some won't like that I rated it 5, but changed it up..OH WELL!  I made brown rice and let it cool in the fridge all day, then I made the Key West Chicken from this site, and set it aside.  I did the egg as directed, but used two, then sauteed onion, red bell pepper, carrots, and zucchini until tender, then added green onions and garlic.  When that was all soft, I added in the rice, cooked chicken, some bacon and the eggs, and probably 2 Tbsp of terriyaki sauce.  It was DELISH!!!

Not really an authentic recipe. Wasn't the worst but I won't waste my time with this again. The soy sauce needs to be cut, the recipe calls for too much! I give this recipe a pass, because the end result just isn't worth the effort.

I have to agree with the author-- DO NOT use rice that you just cooked! Makes for a very sticky meal in the end.

I made this a couple times now and wasn't terribly impressed with it. It was a nice rice dish, but not any tastier than what I could have gotten in my supermarket. Think I'll probably keep looking for another recipe.

This recipe is a great way to start. I ended up adding about half a cup of peas, a sprinkling of ground ginger, 1 teaspoon sesame oil and about a tablespoon of teriyaki sauce. It was wonderful! Next time I make this, I'm also going to add another egg.

Really quick meal when I have leftover chicken....just make rice in the cooker during the day.   I only used 1/2 pepper or it would have been too much.  Served with egg rolls.

I tried this recipe last week. I thought it was good but kind of bland. Next time I will definitely add brown sugar with the soy sauce to balance the taste.

I am absolutely amazed with this recipe.  I didn't have onions and I added peas and it is awsome.  Until today I had not given any thought about fried rice but this recipe is superb!  Thank you for posting it.

Thought this was great and simply made, and I took a chinese cooking class! Think this is a better version! Most fried rice has green onions instead of regular. And also great way to add your fresh veggies, just saute with onions. Heck you can throw in just about anything. I add a bit of sesame oil, and sometimes cook the rice in chicken broth for even richer flavor. Thanks!

Great recipe but we add more vegtables (you can even get frozen stir fry veggies).  You can even substitute the chicken with beef for a different taste.

Fried rice made easy. I always have plenty left over rice in my house so I fix this in a big electric skillet. I cut my chicken into strips rather than chopping. I would normally put in a medley of frozen Asian veggies but I didn't have any on hand. I grabbed a steamer bag of broccoli, steamed them and threw them in the rice. I also used olive oil and sesame seed oil instead of vegetable oil. My son loved this.

WAY too much pepper. Otherwise pretty bland in flavor, but maybe the pepper was drowning it out for me. Going to have to chuck the leftovers. Bummer.

I like this rice.  I added frozen peas and fresh carrots to ours and the second time I made it I omitted the chicken because we made our own broccoli beef recipe. Thank you for this rice recipe we love it.

Tasty and easy.  I added some Peanut sauce as well.  I only used about half the soy sauce because that was all I had.  We both liked it.

Excellent and easy to cook.  Whole family loved it.  The only thing I think I will change is to put less Black Pepper in it.  Was a bit much. I might also put in some vegetables.

I would give it five stars after some of the tweaking I did but the recipe itself was a bit bland. I used brown rice, added a half a bag of thawed mixed veggies and about a teaspoon of sesame oil. My dish needed way more than the amount of soy sauce indicated on here but that's a taste preference. I also agree with others that you could use less pepper too. I will make this again for sure though!

Very good. I use Quinoa instead of Rice. I prepare according to the package and chill the cooked quinoa in the fridge over night. I also add peas, carrots, baby corns and sprouts. You can really add anything to this recipe, it all tastes great.

this was pretty good as-is, less the pepper.  i will for sure make this again, and experment a little to perfect it.  will definitely use sesame oil next time and add carrots (i don't like peas or i'd add those too :o)) for the tiny bit of sweetness it lacks.  will add some green onion next time as well.  i whipped up some minute rice in the microwave and put it in the freezer while cooking the chicken and egg, totally cheating, but it worked great.  i also recommend cooking the chicken with garlic and ground ginger.

This is very quick and easy to make especially if you freeze white rice like I do or simply make the rice the day before and leave it in the fridge. I have made this rice twice using 1/2 cup of diced ham rather than the chicken. With that exemption the recipe is great. You can play with the amount of soy sauce you like

I always double the recipe, and still only add half the pepper and no onions (or just green ones if I have them on hand).  Sometimes we add cooked green peas, as well.  No matter - it's always wonderful and makes great leftovers.

I used PAM rather than butter to cook the egg.  I also added 1 generous t. of minced garlic and reduced the black pepper to 1/2 t.--plenty spicy!  I would have preferred to add peas & carrots to give it some more substance.  I garnished each serving with chopped green onions which was definitely needed.

This was a really great base to start with. Instead of butter and vegetable oil I used a little sesame oil and vegetable oil. I also sauteed 3 cloves of garlic and a while chopped onion before adding the chicken to cook. When the rice was almost done cooking i made a well and added 3 beat eggs and allowed them to cook that way.  Over all it was good and my family loved it, they didn't know that I made it without using the fried rice season packet I usually use.

It was a great way to make good use of left over rice. It would have been better with diced up carrots, and some peas, to make it taste more delicious, like the recipe from my Chinese friend.

When my husband goes for seconds & tells me it's good then it's a automatic 5 star recipe. :) My hubby is an extremely picker eater so it can be a little trying to find recipes he likes.  This was so easy and so good!  I wasn't sure what to expect with using so few ingredients.  The only change I made was using less pepper, 1 tsp seemed like a little too much, other then that I will be making this again.  Thanks for sharing!

Loved it !!! I have been waiting for a recipe like this for a long time !!!! I did not use chicken because I am not a huge fan, so instead I added broccoli at the end and it tasted amazing. I only used 1/2 teaspoon of pepper and it was a bit spicy. If I would've used 1 teaspoon it would have been way way too much. My boyfriend loved it and this is a hit at our house!

A favorite at our house for sure! I made 15 servings for dinner tonight. My children all had friends over and I needed something cheap, but filling and easy and this was it!  I only had 4 large chicken breasts but cut it up into small bites and seasoned with poultry seasoning, garlic powder and a bit of ginger, simmered in water and then drained and set aside. Made everything else as written and ALL the teenagers had at least seconds! A nice change than just Pizza for a group of kids!  Next time I'll make egg rolls too!  Thanks!

This was delicious!!! My husband I loved it! Is was even good cold right out of the fridge the next day. After reading other reviews I added more vegies and egg. The only complaint is that I thought there was to much pepper. Next time I will omit it or at least cut it in half.

This recipe was okay, but I rate it a 3 for two reasons. First there is way more pepper than needed. Second the prep and cook time is a joke. Yes if I magically had cooked chicken, onions and rice at my disposal it might take 5 minutes to dump them in the pan. So to call this a 15 minute meal is a little crazy...

Made this tonight using the leftovers from last night's dinner "Roast Sticky Chicken-Rotisserie Style". Yummy! I ate till I hurt! This will definitely be something I cook again but next time I will make sure the rice is colder.

This dish was all right. I think my rice was a little too wet so it didnt fry up as much as I would have liked. I cooked my chicken with garlic powder to give it more flavor. I'm not sure I would make this again.

I followed other reviewer's suggestions of cooking the chicken in olive oil and adding a little soy sauce to it, only using cold rice, cooking the onions with garlic and ginger, adding frozen veggies, and using 1/4 of the pepper. It still didn't have enough seasoning, except too much pepper, so I had to add more soy sauce and ginger.

This is really a good dish. I added chopped celery sauteed with the onion and frozen peas that I thawed before adding to the rice at the end.

I have made this dish many times and it is the best Fried Rice recipe I have ever made. It is very close to the local Japanese Steak House fried rice (just add Yum Yum sauce from this site). This time, I had a ton of left over Honey Baked Ham from Easter. I looked at the other Ham Fried Rice recipes and they did not have enough soy sauce in them to stand up to the sweetness of the ham. I decided to go back to the recipe that I know and love...just used ham in place of chicken. I also add a drizzle or two of Sesame Oil. This is a favorite in our house! Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is a good starting point but needs a couple modifications. To make it healthier, I used long grain brown rice instead of white, and added broccoli and carrots with the onion. It was delicious and I can't wait to make it again!

Ok, how long does it take to cut and cook the chicken? 15-20 minutes. To cook the rice takes 15 minutes and then you have to get it cold. 1 hour in the fridge? THIS IS NOT a 15-minute meal. It takes at least 1.5 hours total, at least!  Be sure to reduce the amount of water with the eggs. THAT bit added another 20 minutes to the mix as the water just boiled and the eggs never stiffened.  It did taste ok, but what a project and when you plan to preapre a meal in 15 minutes and your family is waiting, you will face an angry and slightly dissappointed mob. "All that time for this?" Is what I would have said. My advice? Keep looking.

Great recipe.  I did add a few carrots, chopped baby Bella Mushrooms and garden peas.  Followed the recipe exactly. The only thing I would say is that if you are serving this as a side you may want to reduce the amount of rice.  We had more than 1/2 left over.

I've made this I don't know how many times.  Love it a lot.  It teaches you important little things in making fried rice, like to always use cooled rice and how to make the egg right.  You can of course add more stuff if you feel like it.  For instance, I like adding peas, a little bit of celery, maybe some green bell peppers or other meat.  Actually I take the best aspects in this recipe and the best in this other one http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/House-Fried-Rice/Detail.aspx and mix them together to make the perfect fried rice.  Just keep in mind that you should add a little more soy sauce if you add too much stuff to the recipe.  I gave it 4 stars just because it is a great starter recipe.

Yummy! I followed the recipe (except took out onions as I can't eat them right now) and snuck in some cooked broccoli  I really really liked it, as did my very picky toddler! This will be what I follow in the future when I have leftover rice :D

You get 5 stars because my picky picky husband actually LOVED this. He went back for seconds then went back for thirds and scraped the frying pan clean.  I loved it, too.  I had seconds myself! I didn't think it tasted anything like the restaurant rice I usually get, but it had it's very own unique and wonderful flavor.  I think next time I'll go lighter on the pepper because it was a little peppery for my tastes, but that sure didn't phase my husband!  THANK YOU for posting this. This will be a new weekly dish for us!  I will be sure to double it next time so we actually have leftovers to send for my husband's lunch. LOL.

Great recipe!  You definitely need to use white rice prepared the day before so it requires a little planning ahead.  I love making this (minus the chicken) to go with basic stir fry.

Great, tasty and easy recipe.  I added more egg as my husband prefers a lot of egg.  I also added peas and carrots for color and my attempt to sneak more veggies into my kids' diet.  Thanks for great recipe!

I made this for a simple lunch one day. My mother and I both loved it, but I didn't have any rice so I used Penne multigrain noodles instead and it was fantastic! I also used grapeseed oil instead, as a healthy choice, I used no hormone chicken breast as well, plus an organic soy sauce. It was very good! But a lot less calories. I'll try it with rice next time.

This was very good and very easy.  I also added 1 diced red pepper and about 1/3 cup frozen corn.  Yummy!

Excellent just how it is I cooked it the other night, my kids didn't know I was making dinner so they looked a bit sceptical, my wife gave it 10 out of 10 and the kids left their plates clean.

Very easy to make.  My 13 year old son whipped this one up for us.  He used unsalted butter and still we found this to be too salty with the soy sauce.  Recommend that you use low sodium or add a bit of water to the soy sauce.

Try using roasted chicken-it makes it tastier! I had left over chicken from the night before and chopped it up rather than using boiled chicken and it came out better than I expected.

I found this recipe to be way too hot when using the called for teaspoon of black pepper.  It also needed some added peas and carrots to make it a little more interesting.

I was pretty unsure when I started this that it would taste good, but it did and it couldn't have been easier.  I actually used left over turkey from Thanksgiving and it was a great way to help use it up! Thanks!

Tasty, but the butter was unnecessary. Sometimes I'll throw in some peas or serve it with fresh steamed broccoli. Cooked this for a bunch of friends and it was a big hit!

I love this recipe! I use sesame oil to give it more of an Asian flavor. I also add a little more soy sauce, a dash of rice vinegar, frozen peas and green onions. It's also great with pork.

This is really good Fried Rice. I accidently made a lot (I was thinking with my stomach, not my brain) and I shared some with my roommate which he also loved, and he's a very picky eater. I did some minor touch ups, I used Sesame oil instead of veg oil and added some powder ginger and garlic. I didn't use Chicken (we didn't have any) but instead I used Turkey breast lunch meat and it turned out great. I will use this again and again.

It turned out to be really good and my husband and the little boy that stays with us ate it up. I used soy sauce and Thai Sweet Chili Sauce. My 3 year old hardly touched it, but will make it again.

I was a little leery since the recipe is so simple with relatively few ingredients, but my family loved it! I didn't add as much pepper as it calls for, and added frozen peas and corn and a bit of ground ginger as well and just a little more soy sauce. Very good for a quick meal to use up leftovers!

I added mixed vegetables, but this tastes very "healthy" and doesn't have the same appeal as my "local Chinese place". It's very good and I will make it again, but it doesn't quite hit the spot when you're craving that greasy take-out Chinese!

*NOTE: added a fried rice flavoring package from the store that GREATLY improved this dish, went from 2 to 4 stars in my book. if you felt it was bland, try an addition of these packets for better taste.*

A family favorite! I had some left over rice and teriyaki chicken and beef from take out and so this worked perfectly. I added frozen peas and carrots and yum. I also have made it with shrimp and it's great that way also. Sometimes I throw in cashews too.

I have made this recipe several times.  It is a good recipe, but I am still working to perfect it.  I use green onion and add beans sprouts to the mix.  I have also thrown in a can of mixed vegetables, and that added some color.  As mentioned several times in the reviews, use cold rice to make this recipe.  It makes a big difference.

Been makeing it for years like this. I like a couple of bacon strips crunched up and a half a handfull of frozen peas. Works with chopped up ham, kelbaska, shrimp,or whatever you have.

EXCELLENT!!! A regular meal for us now!! We tend to make larger batches of this, reheats well. Can eat with chicken for a meal and add to a stir-fry for another meal. Frozen mixture of vegetables is a must!! Also good to add chunk pineapple, ginger or cashews for a variety!

Really good recipe! Quick and easy to make. You can switch out the meats to your liking. Shrimp is great in this! Thanks for the recipe:)***Update, I sauteed  other veggies with the onion...broccoli, snow peas, carrots etc (whatever you like)...turned out great. I also omit the butter (use only EVOO and always add garlic). Cilantro is also a tasty garnish to this dish!

I doubled it for the 4 of us since it was the main dish. I used Sesame Oil instead of Veg and green onion instead of onion, and added peas.  Wonderful!

Had to double this for a larger family and it came out pretty tasty. I used steak instead of chicken, and added frozen corn and a bag of stir fry vegetables. It was really good. Even three kids had seconds. But, we would have liked this with more egg. I'll make this again.

very yummy recipe! tastes just like it was from the restaurant. i rated it a five because i didn't do anything drastic to the recipe. i am confident that if i didn't change it at all it would have still turned out amazing! the only thing i did different was double the rice, used 4 eggs, added peas, doubled the chicken, used 2 tablespoons of soy sauce and 3 tablespoons of teriyaki sauce. i also added half a tablespoon of sugar in my rice water.

Fantastic! In a household of tried and true fried rice fanatics, this always goes down a treat. I like to use white pepper (the people I feed it to won't eat anything that they can see pepper in) and I'll usually scramble the eggs instead of cooking it and then slicing it up... saves a lot of time. It's also fantastic with diced red pepper stirred into it. Happy eating!

This recipe works pretty good. If you're using Chinese soya sauce though, I think 2tbsp is too much. I also added green onions, chopped carrots and green peas. for extra flavour add just a drop of sesame oil

Great Fried Rice!!! I didn't need the water and used a lot less white onions only about a tablespoon of minced dried onions and a tablespoon of chopped green onions:)Added a little salt also. I cooked my white rice and stuck it in the freezer to get cold! Make sure it's COLD rice or it will be mush:(

A great way to use left-over chicken.  My family loves chinese food, and all of us enjoyed this.  I tried a couple of other fried rice recipes on this site, and this one is the best.

I made alot of changes to this.... I omitted the chicken to make it vegetarian, used short-grain brown rice, a mixture of sesame oil and olive oil instead of butter and veg. oil, 1 tbs. soy sauce and 1 tbs. teriyaki. I also added pinches of minced ginger and red pepper flakes. I cooked the egg with a bit of salt. I also added 1/2 cup peas and 2 tbs. peanuts. I would add other veggies like carrots, broccoli, or bell peppers if I had them. It tasted pretty close to restaurant style.

This is great! I cooked my chicken with some fresh pressed garlic, salt, pepper & onion powder, added a cup of green peas while cooking the onions, did everything else exact to the recipe and we both thought it was yummy! Will make again, make sure the rice is cold! I put it in the freezer in a glass bowl and fluff it around every couple minutes till it's all thoroughly cold, works great.

This is my favorite fried rice ...and will now be my go to recipe.  I boiled some frozen peas and diced carrots for 3-5 mins, drained and added toward the end of the rice cooking.     This recipe is almost exactly like what they serve in hibachi houses.  I threw the onion and added 2 cloves of garlic in while the egg was cooking....I shredded the egg and never bothered to remove it from the pan, I didn't think it was necessary.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

Delicious.  I added an additional tablespoon of soy sauce and 1 teaspoon of sesame oil.  I also used 2 eggs.  My husband who doesn't eat Chinese food loved it and asked to take the leftovers for lunch.

This in the best Fried Rice recipe.  My family loves it.  The only thing I add is frozen peas and carrots.  When I am short on time I spread my rice out on a cookie sheet and put it in the freezer to help it cool faster.  By the time I have everything else ready the rice is cool enough to stir fry.

My husband is the fussiest eater on the planet.  He ate this whole recipe up over 2 nights.  I did add some leftover corn into the rice and then I put some frozen Chinese stir fry veggies in a casserole dish (the kind you get at a BJ's or Sam's Club)it had brocolli, baby corn, water chestnuts, carrots, and snow peas.  I arranged the veggies on the outside and dumped the fried rice in the middle.  It made a nice presentation, but barely noticeable, since hubby inhaled it!  I've already made it twice.  It's much healthier than restaurant fried rice, since they use a lot more oil.  I used olive oil.  Thanks!

Tasty, economical, and made a great lunch for hubby and I. I addded in a handful of frozen green peas and some chives and parsley for color at the end. I sliced a partially frozen chicken breast up and just stir fried it in with the onion before adding the rice. Thanks, this is a good base and can be adapted easily.

I thought this recipe was excellent and simple to make. The only thing that kept it from getting 5 stars is that I thought 1 tsp pepper was a bit much. Next time I will use 1/2 tsp. Other than that, it was awesome!! Thank you for a fantastic recipe.

Great recipe, will make again.  I made a couple of changes that made the rice even better.  I marinated my chicken in soy sauce and garlic overnight, used a bit more soy sauce than was recommended, and added a cup of mixed peas and carrots.

Awesome recipe! Great way to use up leftover chicken and rice. I used leftover brown rice, and a stir-fry sauce that I had on hand. I thought the amount of pepper was perfect. This will be a staple around our house!

Amazing. The cold rice is definately the secret - I've made fried rice before, with warm rice, and it was always too sticky. Skipped the pepper and used SoyVay's Veri-Veri Teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce - the extra flavor (tons of garlic and sesame) was a real hit. This is a frequent request at home now, even for the picky eater!

I found this recipe lacked flavor in general; it did not taste like any Chinese fried rice that I have ever had at a restaurant.  Perhaps if you added some teryaki sauce it would improve the recipe.

My husband turned his nose up at this one. He commented that he'd never seen a fried rice cooked with pepper before. Although he didn't care for it, I liked it okay.  I reduced the pepper in half but should have reduced it even further. I added a dash of red pepper and red pepper flakes which added a nice kick. Instead of butter I used pam. Instead of vegetable oil I used sesame oil.  I recommend adding peas. It's a nice burst of texture and color.

This was pretty good fried rice. It seemed to lack a little something though...

This is a good base recipe.  I combined this with another to add more flavor to the chicken and to the rice if need be and my entire family loved it. I made the marinade from the "Ramjam Chicken" recipe on this website, only instead of 3 tbsp of white wine, I added 2 tbsp. chick. broth and 1 tbsp rice vinegar. I cooked the chicken in this marinade instead of letting it sit overnight. Then I added the leftover juice from the chicken to the chicken fried rice in the last minutes. I didn't measure, I just eyeballed it. It added some layers of flavor that otherwise wouldn't have been there. I will definitely make this again.

This was very good. Better our local Chinese Restaurant. I used more egg than the recipe called for.

This was very good, my husband loved it. Other than using brown rice and cooking the rice with chicken broth rather than water, I stuck to the recipe. I also added peas and carrots for veggies. Good recipe, Thanks for sharing.

This was ok.  If you are looking for authentic tasting fried rice like what you would get at a Chinese restaurant -  This is not for you.  This is definitely quick and easy.

I made this exactly as written except I used brown rice as I do with everything (well, I forgot to add water to my egg, but that doesn't count).  The brown rice is SO good you really should try it.  It was delicious and very much like the take-out fried rice I used to get in New York City. The pepper makes it-I ground black pepper over it right before serving and didn't measure it. The recipe should probably state "ground black pepper to taste" as everyone likes  different levels of spiciness, right? I will absolutely make this again-and I will never throw away leftover rice ever again.

Good.  Forgot to premake and chill the rice.  That probably makes it more flavorful.  I added a dash of ground ginger at the end plus a little extra soy sauce.

Here's what's great about this recipe - versatility.  The kids don't like celery in their fried rice, but the husband and I do. So I fixed the kids' supper, and then mine.  Then when the husband got home from selling Christmas trees, I fixed his - he didn't have to eat a reheated supper! Eggrolls keep warm in a toaster oven. Great recipe!

I made this with ground Antelope instead of Chicken and it turned out FABULOUS. I also used 2 eggs isntead of 1, and a few dashes of seasoned salt. Definitely a "regular" in my recipe box now :)

This was wonderful. Instead of putting the chicken in the rice I cooked the Key West Grilled Chicken and put the rice with it. It turned out wonderful. Thank you.

Pretty good, and easy to make. It was pretty bland though, even with the addition of garlic, ginger, green onions and topped with fresh cilantro. I will make again, though, and play with it a little. Maybe a little sesame oil will pick it up.

You can skip the egg part and still have a nice dish. A hot pan or wok will get the rice to brown, which is what we're accustomed to from the Chinese restaurant. Next time, I might add a little sesame oil to enhance the flavor.

Two Thumbs Up for this reciepe. Its very simple and its just as good as the other guys. You can substitute the shrimp and beef and cook them the same way as the chicken if ur not a chicken lover. It also tastes great as leftovers!

Yummy! I used the recipe for Grilled Asian Chicken to prepare the chicken. To this recipe, I added some green peas and broccoli. It was delish and I'm glad that I doubled the recipe. Thanks Lisa!

This is so much better than fried rice I get in my area! I doubt I'll ever order it again! The only differences I made were adding a little green onion and cooking the egg just a couple minutes longer. 
Thank you for sharing!

I totally agree with reviewers "Charly" that this needed Sesame oil,GREEN onion and MUCH more soy AND "J Mac" (that used the suggested amount of pepper): I cut pepper in 1/4, due to J Mac and the fact it just seemed like WAY too much. I am sooo glad I did. This recipe needs help, but it gave me the basics and after tweaking a lot, I came out with a decent fried rice. Thank you for the basic recipe.

Just made this for my family that could chinese food everyday of the week if I let them.  They LOVED it. They all said it was better than the we place order from. They called the recipe a "keeper."
Only thing I did different was add some celery and slice mushrooms for a healthier meal.  A must try.

I liked this recipe. Instead of chicken I used spam and cooked it with the onions. I just did not feel like waiting to boil the chicken. I also cut back on the pepper and I did NOT add salt. The spam's natural saltyness was enough for us. Thanks for the recipe.

I loved it. It was peppery. Not my average Chinese fast food fried rice, but very good. Perhaps it is more Thai like someone suggested.  My boyfriend, however, thought it was too peppery and wanted loads more soy sauce in it.  But pepper + loads of soy sauce tasted nasty.  

I used cooked salad shrimp instead of chicken since I had them on hand. Very num.  

Using the cold cooked rice seems to be the key to fried rice!

I LOVE THIS. It saves me so much money. I crave Fried Rice all the time and have never been able to get the same as my favorite resturaunts. But this is so easy and so close to it. I use at least 3 times A week thanks so much.

Great recipe!  To make it healthier, I used Pam instead of butter and oil, fat-free egg substitute and light soy sauce.  I don't eat meat, so I added carrots, snow peas and celery to half for me and added the chicken for my husband.  Have already made it twice!  Thanks!

I loved this rice. It was so easy to make. I added some ginger powder to it to add a little kick. I also added some peas. I think next time I'll try some bean sprouts and bok choy.

This is a very simple, but delicious fried rice recipe. I have made it with and without the chicken. Also, I have substituted shrimp for the chicken. This was equally as delicious.

Much more can be done to make this varied recipe a lot better. Add sauteed carrots, diced onions, a little garlic, green peas and green portion of scallions at the end, a little fish sauce or hondashi (nobody will know but it makes it better), a little hoisin to add depth if you don't have a wok. Day old rice is best but don't avoid making this dish if you'd have to make rice fresh.

Ok, here are my changes, I took 3 slices of chopped bacon, fried those removed them from the wok and scrambled 2 eggs and removed them , then added my veggies, and meat, and then the rice , added only put in 1 TBSP soy sauce, then added 1 TBSP Oyster beef sauce,  stirred to combine.  Now I did add pepper, but to cut down on the calories for rice I added 1 cup cauliflower minced to  1 cup rice.  added a total of 3 cups each.  Yummy.

This is a good recipe, but with a few modifications, it is just perfect! I added a little garlic powder and lemon juice to taste as well as adding more soy sauce to taste. I also added frozen peas and carrots and chopped frozen broccoli. Now it taste just like it was ordered from a restaurant!

This was the most awesome fried rice recipe.!!! I’ve made fried rice before and thought that this would be basic but there is definitely flavor here! I did season my chicken heavily and use green onion instead of regular onion but I throughly enjoyed it and added in siracha as well ! I love spicy !

This was really good. I added a few things. I added green bell pepper and garlic with my oinons. Added a cup of frozen mixed veggies. I had left over baked chicken that I favored with teriyaki sauce. Mixed all together. It turned out great. Will make again

First, thanks to everyone who told me to use cold rice,  I spread mine on a plate and cooled it in the fridge and it came out great.  Had some teriyaki marinated thin chicken breast to use so this was a perfect fit, I cooked them off first and chopped, then I started with a bit of butter and cooked white end of scallions and mushrooms before adding rice,  drizzled  it with some sesame oil.  Add my precooked, chopped chicken,  thawed carrots&peas a bit of oyster sauce and soy.  Moved all off to the side of skillet and put in a bit butter to scramble the eggs. Mix it in and you have yummy dinner that hubby loved.  
I served mine with Chungs egg rolls from the freezer section. This was so much better than ordering out bc it was a very quick dinner and I could control how much oil/fat went into it

I made two batches of this recipe. The first was good but we felt like something was missing. Because it was so easy to make, I made a second batch and made a few changes. I added sauteed julienned carrots and frozen peas for flavor and color. Also, cut back a little on the pepper. Again, it was good but not what we were looking for.

Love this recipe! Like others, I changed it up a bit to suit our tastes. Added a bag of frozen peas and carrots, some water chestnuts, and because I was meal prepping, made it with more rice, 4 eggs, and chicken. Very tasty, and a GREAT quick meal at night, or to pop in the microwave for lunch the next day. Or three.

I made this tonight for dinner and served it with chicken pot stickers and egg rolls. We liked it, but felt there was a bit too much pepper. We will make this again, but cut the pepper in half (1/2tsp). We also felt that we could add one more cup of rice (no need to reduce pepper if this is added). I did add an additional egg and water and added some frozen peas and carrots and a 1/4 cup green onion, plus a handful of mung beansprouts, which we cooked together with the softened onion prior to adding in the rice and other ingredients. The flavor was nice, but doesn't taste like a restaurant's fried rice. Maybe add more soy sauce next time?

This was so good. I did not add the chicken and just went straight rice and veggies. The chicken was not needed. I used frozen peas and carrots just to cut down on prep time. I put them in the skillet with water covering and cooked just until it boiled, drained the water and put the vegetables back in the same pan with other ingredients as listed.

delicious simple great for a weeknight meal . My only add on would be to cook the rice in chicken broth. It needs a hint more flavor. I did add asian vegetables. I have to say this is the best stir fry I have ever made.

Excellent recipe. I made it tonight. I didn’t add pepper, just a few grinds of a pepper mill (fresh) pepper. I did cook rice earlier in day and out in fridge, used 2 lg minced cloves of garlic. I followed recipe but added chopped celery & carrots, frozen peas, and zucchini quartered. I had cooked chicken premade. I did chop and prep everything first. I used organic tamari ( reduced sodium soy sauce). I made dinner but had doubled the rice so I reserved some onion & garlic and after dinner I fried onion & garlic in oil ( I used extra light tasting olive oil), added 1 tbsp Tamari after translucent, then added chilled extra serving of rice. Once fried and well blended then added to leftovers of chicken/egg/vegetable fried rice batch. I simply didn’t have room in my sauté pan as I made 4 cups of rice.  I loved this recipe and it’s flexibility. I have winged my own version in past but none tasted this good.  In past I added sesame oil but I think it is not needed as this tasted wonderful!

Oh my, this turned out so delicious! I did add 1 red bell pepper instead of green pepper diced, half of a jalapeno pepper sliced, green onions & fresh basil. I also used fresh carrots, & fresh celery that I sauteed in 2 Tsp of butter and 1Tsp of Oyster sauce ( as suggested by another review. I added snow peas that last.
Yummy! Wish I had doubled it!
There is a lot of prep work, slicing, dicing veggies. Fresh veggies are always best!
My fiance loved it!

Not too hard to make (for real, I'm just learning to cook), and tasted amazing!  Much richer than restaurants serve. My objective was to find a simple recipe that is a complete meal by itself, and that I can make in bulk and put in the fridge for lunches. By itself, it serves 1-2 people. I plan on making a triple batch next week for lunches.

Note: I did put about 1/3 the amount of black pepper in, though it was freshly-ground.

I swapped vegetable oil for more butter and added chicken broth to the rice rather--it was a much easier process.

We make this often. We’ve used rice cauliflower instead of rice.  We like it both ways.  We add the soy sauce to taste individually to cut down on sodium.  And we add whatever other veggies we have on hand.  Love it!

This has probably been the best friend rice I've made at home, and SO simple.  I did add some extra heat, and a little bit of sesame oil while cooking and some sesame seeds to finish.  I think next time, I'll add some cashews for a little crunch, along with more veggies.

WAY TO MUCH PEPPER.  Followed a reviewers suggestions.  For serving 8 people- Did 2 eggs, 16 oz of frozen stir fry vegetables, 4 cup of rice, 2 cups rotisserie chicken, 1/4 cups of soy sauce, and 1.5 tsp of pepper (will decrease pepper to 1/2- 3/4 tsp next time).  Will try again.

It was pretty bland. I would add another egg next time and I only added 1/2 tsp of pepper. I did not add the vegetables as I don’t like vegetables mixed into my food.

Very good, first time making it,  also read some of the reviews and added some Oyster sauce and some dry ginger, it was delicious, I tried it just to use up some plain white rice I had in the fridge. I will make this again, next time I am adding some chicken, carrots and peas and some sesame oil too :)

I made this recipe today for my husband and he loved it! I used rotisserie chicken that I cut up and celery in the recipe instead of peas. Also I used brown rice and low sodium soy sauce. We will be making this again!

Used two eggs instead of the chicken, and brown rice instead of white, but it came out great!  First time making fried rice of any kind, and I am very pleased.

My 11-year-old daughter and I made this for dinner. We enjoyed the time in the kitchen chopping up veggies (we added zucchini, carrots, and snap peas to the recipe.) The recipe came together quickly and she was super impressed with how good it tasted!  This is a new family favorite! We used rotisserie chicken and followed the recipe as it is written- just adding a few more veggies!  Easily adaptable to your own family's taste and a delicious and quick meal. (We ate it as a meal, not a side.)

This came out awesome- next time I will probably add some minced garlic only because I needed more of a garlic taste with the rice- but this recipe just following the directions is definitely good.

This was a very easy and tasty recipe. I left out the chicken since I was preparing a meat dish to accompany the rice, so to compensate I made the rice with chicken stock. My husband is always very honest about my cooking, and he said it was really good and went for seconds. Win!

This turned out to be a hit. I made a few changes though. I added green onion, peas, diced carrots. I didn't mix water with my eggs, and I added extra chicken, rice and egg. I've made it twice this week and my family loves it

This is a wonderful recipe if you have a leftover cooked chicken breast and leftover rice! I made the rice the evening before so it was kept cold in the fridge and ready to go. I also made an extra oven grilled chicken breast the day before with my spicy Kansas City rib rub that I use on my baby back ribs as well as on the chicken breast at 400F for 25 minutes and the spice from the chicken added a fantastic zip to this stir fry! I also added a cup of cooked frozen green peas to add another texture to the dish! This chicken stir fry recipe is so easy to make and you can tweak ingredients and spices to your own tastes! Love it and will definitely use this recipe again!

Awesome! My family loved it. I cooked the rice in the InstaPot while prepping everything else. Once the rice was done, I did rinse it in cold water. I also added frozen corn and peas after microwaving them for a minute or two so that they weren't frozen. I did end up adding more than 2 Tablespoons of low sodium soy sauce. I am guessing about 5 Tablespoons instead. Makes good leftovers.

This is my 2nd recipe made from Allrecipes and what a winner. I have to say, I feel like I made a pretty  good dish here. Following the brilliant instruction of course... I think my onion may have been a bit large and I probably could have let them sit a bit longer to get a little more squishy, so less of that on the next fry. We used a cup of leftover Amazing Chicken in this recipe, seasoned with Cajun and it works quite well. All of the ingredients really work together to give the rice a kickin' flavor. I may add some broccoli or mixed vegetables into the pan next time to give it just a bit more variety. This is definitely getting added to my rotation. Perfect for 2. Thanks OP!!!

I added another cup of rice; put 1/2 cup of onion and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Hubby is chowing down now and I’m sure he’ll go for seconds. I might also.  I think it’s safe to say we both liked it a lot.

Made this recipe with cauliflower instead of rice, 1 pound of chicken, and added peas and carrots. We loved it!

Put the rice to the side then fried the eggs.  I combined the eggs and rice.  I cooked the chicken next, then added the onion, then the egg/rice pot (5 eggs - yeah, we love eggs).  We seasoned with teriyaki and soy sauces with minced ginger.  Used butter and extra virgin olive oil.  Family LOVED it!

This recipe was super disappointing. This is the first recipe I’ve used, with strong ratings/a lot of ratings, that was gross. It’s bland, for starters. I had to add salt, which the recipe doesn’t even call for. I did use coconut aminos instead of soy sauce, So maybe that was the problem as far as the salt factor goes. But it was just boring and not good. I definitely wasn’t “wowed” in a good way. Won’t make this again.

This was great! There are more steps than I realized to this recipe so it does take some time. It was very peppery (in my opinion!) so next time I will add less pepper. It needed just a little more salt at the end but that's all I changed and I will definitely make it again. Thank you for sharing!

This was OK as written. I did add some chopped peanuts and petite peas, cut the pepper in half, and garnished with sliced green onion. My main beef with all the the All Recipes recipes is that there is never a serving amount given.

I used peanut oil instead of vegetable oil. I also put in peas , steamed snack carrots cut up, and green onions instead of onion. I left out the chicken because I was making garlic chicken.  But next time I may have to add Chinese BbQ pork, and some and some shrimp .. it is a great basic recipe to start from   don't worry about getting the egg paper thin.

I really like this recipe.  The only things I changed was decreased the amount of pepper because it was too much and added another cup of rice to have leftovers.

It came out ok. I followed the recipe as is without reason other reviews first which I regret. It definitely could have used more flavor. Next time I will use sesame oil, garlic, frozen vegetables, and an extra egg.

Super yummy after I made some minor changes to suit my preferences. I used sesame oil (and a bit more), more soy sauce, a little less pepper (I used fresh ground so it’s potent), and I added green onions and sautéed veggies. Making it again the week after first making it!

This is a really good recipe for fried rice. One thing I would recommend is getting a wok pan as this really helps.  Two changes to the recipe I made is adding some soy sauce to the chicken and adding some red pepper flakes to give it a kick. Also double the prep time to chop all of the vegetables and chicken.

Added more soy sauce & an extra egg after reading other reviews. Very yummy. 3 yr old SAYS she doesn’t like it, but we could tell she was faking- she just wanted noodles instead of rice.

Doubled the recipe for 4 adults and 2 kids. Added more soy sauce than it called for, added about 1 T sesame oil for the double recipe. Used about a half bag of frozen peas and carrots and smoked pork butt instead of chicken. It was delicious! We will do again. The extra soy sauce and sesame oil is a must. It wouldn’t have tasted so much like a restaurant without it.

Not enough soy sauce and wrong type of rice. You cannot use regular white rice it turned into an un tasteful and burned blob of mush. I will never use this recipe again there is a certain type of rice you have to use and its not listed!!!!!!!!!

Great recipe for my fav Chinese dish at home. Added steam in a bag peas and carrots and doubled the recipe. I think one onion is too much for the recipe, and I love onions. I used 2/3rds of a large sweet onion and it was spot on for double the rice. Will certainly make again.

This would have gotten a higher rating but holy cow it calls for too much pepper.   Reduce the pepper by half or even more and the recipe is pretty good.   I also cooked the onions in the butter, added chopped rotisserie chicken,   moved everything over in the pan and cooked the egg right in the same pan and then added the soy sauce as well as some garlic powder and some cooked peas.

It was really good and my family loved it! I added cooked carrots, peas and corn when I added the chicken and rice. I also added a dash of garlic powder and ground ginger to the oil while cooking the onions. I also used mostly canola oil but a little bit of peanut oil. My hubby and sons just loved. They had seconds. Thank you!

Excellent! I just added a little extra soy sauce and some  minced garlic and a little cayenne pepper and some other seasonings.  I'm already thinking of more ways to tweak it for next time.

Tastes not bad. A bit of mince ginger might bring it closer to the orient. But I wouldn't cook this for my kids. No veggies, not enough fibre.

I thought the taste was pretty good for a basic fried rice! Lots of options for protein: I mixed in some BBQ pork instead of chicken and it was delicious.

My family loved this recipe and I loved how convenient it was to make. I cooked the chicken in the wok with a bit of oil, soy sauce, minced garlic, and onion. I removed those from the wok and added everything else in. I made the eggs separate but didn't add water to them because that's sounded gross. Just whisked the egg and made it omelet style and then chopped it up with the spatula. I didn't add corn because niece would've freaked out, but addd peas and carrots. I just used a half bag of frozen veggies but it'll probably be better with fresh ingredients (but seriously who has time for that). Will def make again. Don't be stingy with the soy sauce either!

That dish Is almost perfect as it is. I have made several times. Always use cold rice as it can get mushy if you don't. I always add less black pepper than the recipe calls for. Not like a Chinese restaurant's fried rice but I think it is better. It is also great with teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce. Both ways are great!

I feel like I did something wrong since everyone else raved about the rice they made.  I had leftover plain white rice in the fridge (was a side for asian lettuce wraps).   Maybe it was too moist; maybe I should've rinsed it first.  I only had 1 cup, so I reduced everything else accordingly.  I didn't make any alterations other than leaving the egg out.

I really, really liked this dish. I didn't give it five stars only because I changed the recipe a bit to fit my needs. Instead of chicken, I added peas and asparagus and I used green onions instead of a yellow one. The soy was perfect, not too salty like l feared.  I served with sesame crusted tuna and sliced avocado.  Once the rice is made and cooled this is a quick and easy dish I will definitely be making again.

This should be used with sesame oil not vegetable oil, It tasted nothing like Asian rice. Really disappointing

The recipe itself is rather bland, I'd recommend adding garlic, peas, and some peppers for added flavor. also, disregard how much it says for soy sauce, just add as much as you think will be okay.

Only 4 stars because I made a few adjustments. This may be the first recipe I've ever reviewed and I've been on this app for years! Yum! The only changes I made were after I cooked the chicken I poured a marinade over it of Kikkoman fried rice seasoning mix and I used McCormick minced onions instead of the onion for more flavor. I also tossed in some canned sweet peas to the butter (doubled the butter) and minced onion. Oh and 2 eggs. Fantastic. Served with egg rolls.

7 3 17 I don't like giving recipes a low rating.  I don't see how this would rate higher, if made as listed.  One t pepper is wayyy too much.  'Not because of spiciness, it was very black pepper-y.  Red pepper would be a better addition.  To us, just nothing special.  'Think fried rice is one of those recipes ya just make, not follow a recipe.

This is as good as the hibachi grill! Easy to make I just added some Asian style frozen veggies, carrots, broccoli and snow peas, throw the veggies in with the onions and let them soften up, mix all together and it came out wonderful, also threw in shrimp to make it a combination stir fry, kids loved it, we will definitely cook this again!

I didn't realize fried rice was so easy to fix. It turned out great, my husband enjoyed it and I will definitely make it again.  I did add diced carrots and frozen peas in with the onions, next time may even try adding a little frozen corn also.

Holy pepper batman!! I added peas and carrots which was a good call, but next time I will definitely cut way back on the black pepper. Otherwise an awesome easy recipe for restaurant quality fried rice.

Have made this for decades using a very similar recipe from the Minute Rice boxes.  I also  scramble the egg, and I add frozen peas and chopped celery.  At the end I  top it with unsalted peanuts, which I  think put it over the top. Oh, and I leave out the pepper.

Great recipe. Easy to follow. My family loved it. I doubled the recipe, and added red peppers and peas. Tripled the soy sauce, but don't double the pepper. Delicious!

We loved this dish! I used all the same ingredients, I just modified the cooking process. I took the advice of another person and used sesame oil. 
1. I sautéed the chicken in sesame oil and then added the onion. 
2. Then added the soy and pepper (about 4 turns of the pepper mill), I added about a Tbspn of minced ginger since I had it.
3. I used frozen, steam able veggies and cooked them. Then added them to the skillet.
4. I then added pre-cooked rice. I kept it warm because it was minute rice. (will not use it next time.)
5. I added the egg that I cooked separately.
6. I felt it was missing something, so I drizzled some Asian BBQ/teriyaki  on top, stirred and served. We spinkled a little cayenne pepper on top for a little spice. YUMMMMM! Another keeper!

I've tried this and it fine. And not being critical but another 30 seconds will build the flavor an amazing amount. Along with your soy sauce, add about 1 tsp of sesame oil, and 1-2 Tbsp oyster sauce. Go slow on the sesame oil. It is very strong. 
Another little change is to use cut up pieces of rotisserie chicken. Use a combo of light and dark meat. Saves time and again adds flavor. If you want to add just a touch of heat, add in a couple of Tbsp of sweet chili sauce. It's not very hot at all but taste a little before adding to be sure you like it. 
As I said these additions take hardly any time and really make the dish sparkle.

This was good but I made mine differently, I use vegetable beans from the freezer section in my rice and did not use the rice cold once rice was cooked I added it to another empty pan and added the soy sauce I also cook the eggs ahead of time and added some water to the eggs before cooking it lightly scramble.  My husband love it would make it again.

I thought this was great, but increased soy sauce to taste, cooked chopped baby carrots and frozen peas with the onion, and left out the chicken. This vegetarian version is a great side dish or main dish. And it's SO EASY. Definitely use cold rice too!

My entire family loved it! I cooked the chicken from frozen quickly in my Instant Pot while I was doing the rice on the stove, then the egg and onions.  Took 20 minutes from pulling the chicken out of the freezer to sitting down to eat it! I did 2 eggs (family of 6), but next time will do 3 eggs.

Made this for a Sat dinner
Wife and lil one both thought it had too much "spice"
Next time we will reduce the black pepper
We also added 1 cup corn and 1/2 cup peas to the veggie list
Other than that it was a great recipe

Super easy. Each time I've made it I added in whatever vegetable I had on hand. Squash, broccoli, peas. I didn't use cold rice. Seemed like it turned out fine without it.

Yeah, so, I wish I knew what "cold rice" was and how to get it. But for real, this recipe is super cheap. I left out the onions and chicken because I'm a college student and I'm broke. I accidentally skipped over the "cold rice" part and cooked jasmine rice normally and threw all the stuff together. I made it with two eggs instead of one and with more pepper because I'm pretty immune to spiciness. So, despite being wrong, it was great. I did the math and if I were to buy the cheapest rice, eggs, butter, oil, pepper, and soy sauce, I'd make a two-egg, one cup of rice bowl for less than $0.75. Maybe I'll learn to make "cold rice" or just keep making it wrong. I'll probably add meat and vegetables once I get a job.

3 stars as written, 4 with changes.

Doubled the recipe. Used 1.5 cups uncooked short grain brown rice, 2.5 cups chicken broth. 2 eggs. Fried 2 onions, chopped carrots then add bunch of green onions. 5-6 TBS soy sauce, 3+ cups chicken thighs (2-2.5 lbs).  Added peas right before egg. Could use more flavor.

I substituted shrimp for the chicken as my wife is a vegetarian, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. The wife even said she liked this version better than takeout. Thanks!

Best fried rice I've ever made. I changed things just a little. Didn't cook that egg like it suggested. I used prob 2-3x chicken and also added carrots. Also used 3 eggs. 2 cups is a lot of rice!  Some teriyaki sauce also gave it just what it needed.

I made this and it was absolutely delicious. I took the suggested of one person who commented and salted my meat while cooking then added soy sauce after it was done and put it off to the side. For my fried rice, I used salmon and white pepper instead of black pepper. Also, while I was cooking the rice, I created a hole in the middle on the pan and cooked the egg a little bit then scrambled it and cooked it the rest of the way with the rice. Delicious!

My whole family loved this dish! I bumped up all the ingredients by adding an entire rotisserie chicken and three cups of cooked rice. I used the onion and added peas and ended up just cooking two scrambled eggs in the microwave and mixing it in. Great tasting easy dinner to make on a work night! We had it with some frozen steamed dumplings.

Rave reviews from this household. I did add a lot more veggies but base recipe kept in tact. I also made a double batch and it's all gone! I put tin foil on a large cookie sheet, spread the 4 C of rice on it and put in refrigerator for about 30 min to get it cold.

I made this, and it was amazing! It tasted just like the fried rice I order from my local Chinese restaurant. The only thing is that I didn't add the chicken to the rice. I only used a little bit of pepper. And I added peas and corn. I didn't notice is that the rice was supposed to be cold though. When I realized that, I just let the pot of rice cool for about  10 minutes on the stove, and then stuck it in the freezer for 20 minutes.  The next time I make this, though, I think I'll probably use two eggs instead of one. My daughter's only complaint was that there was not enough egg in it for her liking. But other than that - it was a big hit! There wasn't even any leftovers!

Very good flavor but this recipe was a bit salty. I will try low sodium soy sauce next time. I also used frozen peas and carrots as others suggested. I will make it again!

I loved this recipe!  I accidentally burned the onions a little, but it gave it more flavor. (Let's just call it that) We had a side salad with it and it was plenty of food for the 4 of us.  Everyone in my family ate it so it must have turned out good!  I will make it again, for sure!

This is a very versatile recipe.  I make it with several different veggies (zucchini, broccoli, veggie blend, mushrooms, etc.).  My husband LOVES Chinese food and he says this is the best since it tastes so clean (fresh and not as greasy).  I have never been able to make an Asian dish he likes until this one.  It is also a super quick and easy weeknight mea! One suggestion I have is to use toasted sesame seed oil.  It adds an additional Asian flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

Lisa this was awesome.  I have tried and tried to make homemade fried rice and is never able to get the consistency right.  I was able to perfect this one by your directions, but I used one day old cold rice and it didn't turn out sticky.  This has great flavor and is a regular dish in my house.
Thanks again!

I made this a couple of times. It is very tasty and tastes like restaurant made. I just changed the pepper quantity to 1/4 tsp otherwise the 1 tsp overpowers. I also stir fry broccoli.

I used precooked brown rice and quinoa, also used precooked chicken. This only took 5-10 minutes and tasted great! I didn't use fresh onions but I added dried minced onions for flavor and some garlic. Next time I will add mixed vegetables and try fresh onions. Very tasty!!!

Cooked the bite sized chicken in the wok until done and then removed it. Added garlic with the onion. Then added mushrooms after a minute or two and cooked until they were done. Added peas and carrots with the rice and chicken. It was really good. The kids loved it as well.

Followed to recipe to the letter... except added 4 cloves of garlic to ward off any vampires. Also added 45 mls (3 TBS) of green onion on the finish and added 30 mls (2 TBS) Sambal Olek Ground Fresh Chili Paste. The 5 mls (TSp) ground pepper was a little much but I get it. Hammered like a dog-turd you want spicy.  Next time I will make with a pinch of ground black and more of the dreaded rooster - Sambal Oelek spicy but less in your face. Great comfort food. Can't wait to make this for husband.

Came out even better than restaurant fried rice! I cooked the rice a few hours in advance and left it in the fridge. You don't want to use freshly cooked rice as it will stick together. Additionally, for some added flavor, I cooked the chicken with half olive oil, half sesame oil. That really gave it a great flavor.

Great recipe. Very similar to a fried rice recipe my Aunt used to make me when I was a little girl. I rated the outcome as a 4/5 stars simply bc I felt it could use a little more flavor. The sencond time I made this recipe I did add broken up pieces of baked bacon, chinese 5 spice, oyster sauce and sesame oil. I also substituted the vegetable oil with extra virgin olive oil. This ended with an all out flavor party in my mouth!!

Just made this - tasted sooo good! And easy to make especially if you have cooked chicken and cooked rice on hand. But even if u don't it's easy to make under 30 min.

I made this for dinner tonight out of last night's leftovers. This was a great basic recipe that can easily be seasoned to your personal taste. I added a very tiny bit of sesame oil and some Penzy's Bangkok Blend. I will purposely make too much chicken and rice next time just so I can make this again.

I've made this several times. I cut the pepper to 1/2 teaspoon.  The onion cook time is about 5 to 10 minutes. I love it. It is quick, easy and tastes great.

This recipe made it so easy to make one of my all time favorite dishes. 

I would like to add though, prep time is not really 5 minutes. You do need chopped onion and you need to make the rice several hours beforehand so that you can chill it before use, as well as prepare the chicken. A little planning the day before or in the morning is all it takes though, just boil the rice, then the chicken, chop the onion while waiting for those, put both in the fridge and then at dinner time you put everything together! I also like to add a bag of frozen vegetables when I add the rice, to get that food group in as well and because most of the Chinese places I go to have that in there. I usually make at least double what the recipe calls for because it goes fast and is sooo good!

This was great! I doubled the recipe and but didn't double the pepper or the yellow onion. I added 1/4 small diced red pepper just as the onion was finishing cooking. Right before taking it off the stove, I also added a few chopped green onions and a half cup of cooked peas. I will definitely make this again!

justswitch the meats up with whatever I have on hand.  Made this more times than I can remember. I have added frozen peas and corn since my son only eats those veggies.  The best out there.

I have been looking for a simple fried rice recipe for leftovers. This recipe was great. Added a cup of frozen peas and carrots, changed the meat to whatever was leftover, and it's great everytime. Cold rice is the key. Thanks!

My husband loves this fried rice and he's very picky eater. He says it's better than a Chinese restaurant. My 3 year old also loves it and it's hard to get him to eat much of what he used to since he's at this stubborn wanting-to-assert-his-independence stage. It's very simple, VERY easy, and VERY quick. And most importantly, it's VERY delicious! Easily customizable. We usually use chicken but I've also used ground beef and pork loin cut up. Can add more or less of each ingredient to your taste as well. Thanks!

This is a favorite in my household.  We thought the pepper was a little strong, so we omit the pepper and season to taste when we are eating it.   We have made this several time, we double the recipe and have little to no left overs.  My picky children love this!

GReat recipe! Although, like it was stated in a comment farther down the amount of pepper this calls for is TOO MUCH!!! Do not use a full reason, add according to taste! Other than that the recipe is fantastic and tastes great if you decide to add some carrots and green onion :)

Turned out delicious!  I added peas and shredded carrots to the onions after the onions were soft.  I used 3 eggs with 2 packages of thighs and 1/3 cup soy sauce.  Eating this right now and it's just delicious!

This was so simple and very good. The only changes I made was I added garlic paste towards the end of the onion cooking and added peas at the end. My picky husband was blown away and said it was the best fried rice he has ever had in the USA

My kids love this recipe.  It's quite flavorful and simple to make.  I also rinsed the rice under cold water to speed up the process.  It is definitely important that the rice be cold. I do add a little bit more oil at the very end when everything is frying together. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was delicious!  My husband & I both loved it.  The changes I made: use "onion, onion" from the TS line (instead of a real onion), add extra scrambled egg (personal preference), and add a bag of microwaved mixed veggies at the end.  I made sure the rice was cold before frying, as others reviewed (cooked it and then rinsed in cold water).  Really, really good & fairly easy!  I'll make this a lot, I'm sure!  Thank you for the recipe!

Not bad for a beginner chicken fried rice.  I used leftover  teriyaki chicken from the night before. I also like mine a little more well done to a spread out the rice on the bottom of my frying pan and let's it fry for 30-40 seconds then flipped it and did it again. It helped to make sure the wasn't to wet.

Great basic recipe & great to clean out the fridge. I skipped the pepper since my husband doesn't like spicy. I sautéed the onion with matchstick carrots.  Used 2 balsamic baked chicken thighs & a pint of leftover white rice from our Chinese the other day.  Threw in some broccoli & peas as well.  I think it tastes better than take out!

This is great! I usually don't review recipes, but wanted to let everyone know a little tip about cooking your rice. I don't use cold rice, I tried that trick and it didn't work for me. I now fry my uncooked rice in a very hot skillet, without oil, for 2-3 minutes until the rice turns opaque before I make it. I use a rice cooker to actually cook the rice but it works if you boil it in a sauce pan too. The rice turns out like in restaurants. You need to try this, it doesn't disappoint!

Second time making it and it turned out great and tastes even better. Used left over turkey instead of chicken.

this was a very easy recipe to follow. I used cold white rice (cooked) and I sauteed bell peppers with the onions. I also added a bag of mixed veggies before I added the egg.

This was a hit.  I made  serving for 5 even though it was just for my husband and myself, I wanted some left over for my daughter to take home. I read the many reviews and I added the frozen peas and corn, I used teriaki sauce, soy, and sesame oil and fresh ginger. All things that had been previously noted. Now to think of it, I forgot to add pepper.  I used a wok, too.  I found the suggestion about COLD rice beneficial.  I can't wait to use edamame and maybe water chestnuts next time.  OH I also used the Perdue  Carving chicken that is already cooked, so all I had to do was cut it up. Great one dish meal. Do as noted earlier, do yourself a favor and have everything cut up and at your disposal when you are ready to cook.

I made this with minute rice and it was delicious!!  HOWEVER the amount of black pepper called for is WAY too much.  I used a quarter the amount and it was too much.  Otherwise, I highly recommend this recipe.

I added some frozen shelled edamame and cashews to the recipe.  Jasmine rice cooked the night before gave the end result a fluffy but firm texture.  My girlfriend loved it!  She asked for the leftovers to be packed with her next day's lunch for work.

I would definitely add less pepper. I put in probably 3/4 of a tsp since I read a review that said that they added less. This was still too much pepper. Maybe try 1/2 tsp? I followed everything else exactly except no chicken. The times were good estimations of cook time. Despite the extra pepper, still a pretty good recipe.

Very tasty and simple to make fried rice recipe.
I made the following changes: used fresh carrots and frozen peas,  I fried the veggies first then chicken with sesame oil, soy sauce and garlic powder. Once this was all incorporated I added the rice and egg last.

Wonderful, simple recipe. I first rolled chicken tenders in flour and sautéed them in oil. I then cooked the egg in the same pan & then the rest of the dish. Cooking the dish in the same pan gives it lots of chicken flavor.


I served cooked broccoli and carrots as a side dish.

This is a go-to recipe for me.?? Loved it!

I like more vegetables in my fried rice.  Sometimes I add a cup or so of thawed frozen mixed vegetables or I get some from the salad bar at the grocery store. .  I usually get some peppers, peas, squash, celery and just fry it up with the onion.
I usually make a double recipe of rice a few days before and then refrigerate half for the fried rice

We liked this one!  And it’s a great way to use up leftover cooked chicken, leftover rice and some odds and ends in your refrigerator!  I made two servings, basically following the recipe, but making some additions and just a few small changes.  I did use a whole egg for my two servings and cooked it in just about a teaspoon of butter.  I sautéed some green onion, julienned red pepper, sugar snap peas and fresh minced garlic in oil, added the rice, chicken, shredded egg, soy sauce and a splash of sesame oil and heated everything through.  I served this topped with sliced green onion tops and Chinese rice noodles for some crunch.  Really easy and we’ll be doing this again for sure!  Thanks!

I'm glad I found this recipe.  It is my favorite chicken fried rice recipe.  I make it when I have leftover chicken and have made it multiple times.  I make the rice ahead of time and cool it.  I use brown rice instead of white because that's the only rice I buy.  Also, I use 1/4 tsp of pepper not 1 tsp because it was to peppery for me.  Otherwise, I make it as shown and hubby and I enjoy it.   Thanks Lisa.

Sometimes I go months between batches and refer to this recipe for reference. So I make mine a little differently. Finely diced carrots are stir-fried in sesame oil until slightly tender. Onion is added and cooked until translucent and slightly caramelized. Garlic and ginger is added to taste at a 1:1 ratio. Cold brown rice is added. Butter is added. Light soy sauce is added. Protein is added. White pepper is added instead of black. Red pepper flakes are also added at this time. A well in the bottom of the wok is made and an egg scrambled. Don't over stir the egg. Add green onion and peas. Add granulated chicken bouillon, if desired for richer flavor. 

I know it sounds like a lot of alterations, but it's really not.

Delicious! I added minced garlic when sauteing the onions (in butter not oil), and took a previous reviewers advice on how to cook the chicken and added red pepper flakes in with the green onions. The husband and I agree that we will make this again for sure!

Absolutely wonderful dish! The only thing I added was a half a cup of mixed peas and carrots, and (once the dish was ready to serve) a liberal sprinkling of my dear friend Tony's hot pepper powder. This is a keeper! My son can't wait for me to try it with shrimp, and I'm looking forward to that, too.

First time making this and the next time I make it there will definitely be some tweaks. As many have mentioned be sure to use cold rice, that is rice that was not just made. I used rice made from a previous night. I suggest on backing way down on the pepper. Next time I will season taste and adjust as needed.

Very tasty recipe! My boyfriend asked me if I had just taken it out of of takeout box because it looked just like the restaurants. I scrambled the eggs into small pieces instead of frying and shredding and was very good. Also waited for my rice to cool down before frying.

I added in some bean sprouts, carrots, and baby corn just to have more veggies in the mix. It was delish!

This is a fantastic recipe. It makes a great dinner and I also love taking it as a lunch the next day. I've made it a few times and have made minor changes, but I think it would be a 5-star recipe as is. I used less pepper (personal preference) and used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil. Also, I've sometimes used more or less chicken depending on what I had. My sister doesn't care for it - she says there is not enough flavor - so it probably depends on personal taste.

SUPER PEPPERY!!!!! One teaspoon of pepper (what the recipe calls for) was WAY too much. It overpowered the rice and it turned out super spicy. However, after adjusting the amount of pepper by adding maybe an 1/8 tsp or 1/4 tsp at a time, it turned out great. Overall, tasty, quick, and easy if you adjust the amount of pepper.

Very easy and fast! I added some frozen peas and carrots which had been thawing all day, will definitely experiment with other vegetables if I make this again.

I doubled this recipe for most ingredients, but did not double the butter or oil. I wish I had cut the pepper down because it was a bit overpowering. I also added peas and carrots I wanted to get out of my refrigerator. Excellent flavor.

I made this chicken fried rice for the first time tonight for dinner and it was sooooo amazing!! Taste just as good like the chicken fried rice from my favorite Chinese restaurant I go to. Will for sure make again. (Rice must be cold before you stir it. Cook the rice before you do anything else. Then put the rice in the freezer or  refrigerator )

Definitely a quick, easy dinner. Be sure to have everything cut, measured and ready to go because once you start, it goes quick ! I added diced carrots and peas and it was a hit at the table. Love this recipe because it is so versatile!

I'm vegan and wanted to make dinner for my parents. It was super easy to make and they loved it!!! I kept the chicken and also added salmon, but decreased the amount of pepper. I also chopped garlic and sauted them along with the onions. They couldn't get enough thank you so much!

Thanks to all the other reviews, I made sure the rice was cold. I cooked it and let it sit in the fridge for a couple of hours. I made it with chicken thighs, added garlic, green onion and mixed veggies to it. Also did 1 1/2 T of soy sauce and 1 T of oyster sauce! It was extremely delicious!

Been experimenting with various Cook's Illustrated Stir Fry recipes and they were good, but not great, and much more complicated than this one, which was GREAT!!  Also was the first time I used Bragg's Liquid Amino Acid's (soy sauce replacement) and that may have assisted, but overall the simplicity of this recipe shined through in a great way!

PS I also added a medium-large sized orange bell pepper.

This was super easy to make. Very quick prep and cook time. Kids loved it. Would like to add carrots and peas, or a frozen vegetable medley to it for an added quick veggie source.

Yum! I added peas and actually had to double the amount of soy sauce...I think probably because I used brown rice.  But otherwise, it turned out fabulous!  I ended up making a second batch, because the hubs liked it so much.  Now he has plenty of leftovers for lunch.  Thank you!!

This is soooo easy and fast and tasty... I substituted the chicken for pork and made this for my son's birthday dinner. WOW... where we all surprised. Actually I was asked "where did you buy this Dad", can you believe it!  I accompanied with some stir fried Asian vegetables (frozen) and chicken glazed in orange sauce. I made a large batch for some 8 to 10 servings and it was all gone. We where only 4 at the table. I will be making this on a regular bases.

I would recommend that you have all ingredients chopped and ready to use.  I also added finely chopped garlic, a little fresh ginger and bamboo sprouts and chestnuts. One other thing is to us cold rice, very important.  Try it... guaranteed to be thrilled  with a mouth watering treat. ENJOY...

I also substituted sesame oil for the vegetable oil and threw in some leftover broccoli for color. Didn't love it, but my husband did, so will probably do it again.

Very easy and simple. Lacked a "wow factor" for me so next time I think I'll add some more vegetables to flavor it up. Overall pretty good, easy, and cheap to make!

This is good, but not great. Would be better with hoisin sauce as an additional ingredient to give it more flavor.

We added garlic and ginger with the onions. Used 1 1/2 T of sesame oil & 1/2 T veg oil to give more flavor.  Added 1 T of oyster sauce and I increased the soy sauce by one T to give it moisture it was needed.  I added about a 1/2 tsp dried chile peppers to kick it up a notch along with a 1/4 tsp salt.  Use a half of a sweet bell pepper chopped then added it with the onions.
Due to food allergies the egg was left out.  Overall, my husband rates this a 3 out 5 but he is a bit picky. lol I rate it at a 4.  We will make this again as it was a great use of leftover rice and chicken which was quick to make.  A great recipe for getting home after a long work day.

First I cut my chicken breasts into strips and boil it  in water seasoned with olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper. You have to watch it closely and remove when its just cooked. Let it cool a few minutes before you cut it  into small cubes.
 I added garlic, shredded carrots, mushrooms, water chestnuts and asparagus.  I have also used frozen peas instead of asparagus. I added green onions to garnish.  My son loves this and will eat several bowls full.

This was delicious which surprised me as it is such a simple recipe. I followed the advice of some reviewers and cut the chicken into strips, cooked with some sesame oil and added a splash of soy sauce at the end. I also sautéed 2 cloves of chopped garlic with the onion. I used two eggs because my daughter loves eggs. It disappeared!

Definitely needs flavor. Use sesame oil instead of vegetable, double the amount of egg, add lots of garlic and add more veggies. After you do all that, it's pretty decent.

We've made this multiple times, and it is always so very tasty.  The nice thing is that you can add any other vegetables you'd like.  We generally add carrots and peas, sometimes corn, sometimes broccoli, generally serve the chicken on the side instead of in the dish.  It turns out great every time.

This is really easy and great tasting!  My family love it. I was wondering if it would be bland since there is not a lot of ingredients but it is just right for us!  Was even better as leftovers the next day.  It's a keeper!

This is the easiest fried rice recipe that I've found. Cooking the egg this way makes it come out perfect, I would've never thought to add water to it. You must use cold rice otherwise if you use hot/freshly made it comes out gummy and not separated, so leftover rice is perfect for this dish! Also personally I like to use teriyaki sauce instead of plain soy sauce as it makes the dish sweeter. Store-bought or homemade will do. I also add in about 1/4-1/2 a can of drained corn. Yummy!

Loved it! I added some asian seasoning while pan frying my chicken before throwing it in with everythung else  (ginger, garlic, and husin sauce ) also added more soy  (about an extra tablespoon. I steamed some frozen asian veggies in my rice cooker for about 5min and threw them in the skillet at the last minute. My boyfriend and kid scraped the plate. Love this quick and simple recipe and will be making again

Just added: cubed carrots and cut up green beans, can't do without my veggies. Grated ginger (which I keep in the freezer in a sandwich bag), and added to chicken. Not really changes just additions. 
This was so good, I will make it often. Excellent!

Delicious. I added carrots, sugar peas, and peas. I also doubled the recipe and used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil. I highly recommend using sesame oil instead of vegetable oil. I thought the amount of black pepper was perfect, but it definitely does give it a zip--a zip that plays perfectly with the sesame oil. Use cold rice for sure. Honestly, very, very good fried rice.

Wonderful recipe but a teaspoon of pepper is a little much 1/4 teaspoon or 1/2 teaspoon would make it so much better unless you like your mouth to burn a bit haha. Other than the pepper I put peas and carrots in tasted like the rice I get from the Chinese place in town

I made this for my family, and after finishing eating it, they told me to make it again. Laugh, I said, "Right now?" Thinking they were joking! They were not! I immediately made it a 2nd time that night and they devoured it! I've made it several times a week since! It's so amazing!

I had read the reviews and cut the pepper in half and I still thought it was too much. Otherwise, it's good.

My family loved this! It was the perfect compliment to the sweet and sour chicken I had made.  I added pea pods, sprouts, and an extra egg, to my version of the recipe. I also did not add the chicken. And like so many others have mentioned, make sure the rice is cold

I love this dish, but I added frozen veg. If you do frozen, add the frozen cooked chicken cubes and frozen veggies before the other stuff. But yep! Will make it again.

I made a couple changes like most people do, but nothing drastic, added veggies and sesame oil. The bones stayed the same, and this was a huge hit!  Will definitely make again.

Only change I made was to not put the black pepper in. We did that the first time and it made it way to spicey for us. Without the pepper it's better than any of the 3 Chinese restaurants in our town cause it doesn't come out a sloppy soggy mess. We make this at least once a month with beef and brocoli

This was ok in my opinion. I wasn't crazy about it but it wasn't bad either. My boyfriend really liked it. I think it would've been better if I used half a tablespoon of pepper instead of a full tablespoon. I could really taste the pepper. Also i think adding some vegetables would have helped.

I altered the recipe slight by using green onion instead of regular onion and adding broccoli and turkey sausage. It was absolutely delicious! I was surprised at how tasty it was. Better than regular Chinese food

Great pieces to add to a dish we've been making for years.  First time we added onions!  Loved!  We normally separate the whites from the egg and this way was much easier and made more.  We added green onions and recently found a "fried rice" seasoning we fell in love with that adds great flavor.  Thanks for posting didn't have any leftovers was the only downside. Lol.

Very good recipe and easy to make changes to suit your taste! I always add a can of lachoy bean sprouts  to all my fried rice dishes. I'm not sure where that came from but my mom who was a very adventurous southern cook did it and we like it that way. I'm sure it would be delish with fresh ones too but we live out in the country and the canned ones are easily kept in the pantry. Used a little less pepper (about 3/4 teaspoon) and even with the extra bean sprouts this was plenty. Added a touch of sesame oil too.

Made this for dinner. It was a lot better then I would have thought. I added a bag of mix veggies, shrimp instead of chicken and I doubled the batch. I really did not know how the family was going to take to it. Well I only have about 2 cups left. 
The only other thing like many people said. WATCH the pepper.  Make sure the rice is COLD!!

This was suprisingly good for how easy it was to make.You have to use cold rice or else you will have a mushy mess.The only thing I did differently was cut out the butter and vegetable oil and use sesame oil.Plus I added garlic and some steamed brocolli.Will definately make again.Thanks for the recipe :)

Made this for dinner tonight and it was fantastic...

I just made a few changes..I used sesame oil instead of veg oil and I used 3 cups of rice and used 2 eggs...I added way more soy sauce than called for maybe just a personal preference..I also added diced peas and carrots..

Definitely will be making this great dish again..

I made it exactly as written with no changes.  It was pretty bland.  Did not have much flavor at all.  I think a different oil would be better.  Perhaps some garlic, too.

I used thin cut breast that I sliced into strips and then stir fried in some olive oil. Added some red pepper flake to the chicken as it cooked. Very good. Both kids liked it and next door neighbor appreciated leftovers.

DELICIOUS!! And soooo easy. I made rice the day before and stored it in the fridge. Followed this recipe pretty closely with the exception that I doubled the soy sauce and added 2 cups of mixed veggies (corn, peas, carrots, beans). Definitely a recipe I'll make again.

I thought this recipe is a good start to a great dish, but its lacking in flavor. I would start with adding a pinch of salt and I prefer some veggies, such as carrots and maybe some English peas or bell pepper. I will definitely make it again.

Simply great! I make this all the time with leftover chicken.  I  add cooked peas, carrots and an additional egg for added flavor...  So good and you'll never have to throw that one leftover chicken breast or piece of pork tenderloin away.  Thank you for posting...

I've been making this recipe for some time now.  I did add a few things to it.  I added corn, sesame seed oil, ground ginger, minced garlic, and instead of vegetable oil I used olive oil. Also because of the soy sauce which I used about a quarter of a cup, I didn't see a need for salt. My family loves it!!

Fantastic! I made this for a side dish so I did not add chicken but did add some frozen peas and carrots (about 1/2 cup each) when the onions were almost done. Did not change anything else. Will be making extra rice every time now so I can make this recipe!!

I guess I used this recipe as a guide and took some other reviewers suggestions. I cooked the onion and chicken with Pam and sprinkled with soy sauce, ground ginger and garlic powder. When the chicken was almost done I added a bag of frozen mixed veggies. Then when the veggies were about done I added the rice, 1/2 the pepper & soy sauce. It turned out really well except the pepper was overwhelming, I will make it again but even less pepper, possible throw in some peanut butter, yum!!

I made some small changes, I added peas and carrots and cut back on the black pepper. But I also added some worcestershire sauce (about 2 tablespoons full) it was awesome!!! I will be cooking it again;-)

I substituted sesame oil for the vegetable oil, added 2 green onions, diced and 1 cup of thawed peas.

It was pretty good. Make sure your rice is cold tho.

I didn't change a thing--this recipe is easy, it's an inexpensive dish, and my family loves it.   We never have leftovers, which I suppose is the only downside!   I always make rice a day ahead of time and serve some of it with another meal, then chill the 2 cups so it's ready to go.  I use a 10-oz can of chicken to make things even easier.  I also let the onions sauté a little longer so they get brown--that way they add a ton of flavor.

Yummy for our tummies!  The first time I made it my rice wasn't cold enough and it was kinda mushy lol But....I tried again and took the advice of a review I read. They said to run your rice under cold water. I wasnt so sure about doing that but it worked perfect! When I reheated it the next day I didn't use our microwave. Instead I heated a little veggie oil in a fry pan with some garlic powder then put in the leftover rice. Yum!

Very good and very easy! Didn't feel much like cooking and was looking for just a simple but yummy recipe, and came upon this recipe. I decided to leave out the egg, just a preference, and added some ingrediants to jazz it up a bit. I used frozen chicken strips that I had on hand, thawed them, chopped them up and added them in. I also used some soy sauce packets we had a gotten from a chinese restaurant to use them up. To the onions I also added about a quarter of green pepper and a tablespoon of minced garlic. For the rice, since I'm impatient, I rinsed it in cold water llike another reviewer had mentioned. Tasted great, and made for some great leftovers! Will definitely make again for a quick and easy meal.

I was terribly unprepared for dinner when I made this. So I ended up not having all the ingredients. I just had rice, soy sauce, chicken, and a few eggs. It STILL came out tasting amazing. I just added a little Tony's seasoning for some extra kick. I cannot wait to try this again with all of the ingredients this time.

I thought the recipe looked boring compared to the veggie filled fried rice we order in but WOW this was really yummy and kid friendly! I made it exactly as written except I stirred in about 2 tsp of brown sugar into the soy sauce before adding it to the rice. When I make it again I won't add a thing.

I have made this recipe several times when I have left over cooked chicken. I omit the pepper because my kids are sensitive to it and I use half of an onion, which still seems too much onion for me. I also add frozen peas or mixed veggies. I've made it several times with brown rice and sometimes my rice is hot right out of the rice cooker, which has never gave me a problem. The flavor overall is great and it's very easy to make.

What a great recipe! Decided to make this for lunch for my brother and it was so easy to make and clean up after. We always have a lot of leftover white rice and this definitely revives it! One change I made is that I added some chili paste, sesame seed oil, chili soy sauce in addition to the other sauce, and more vegetables like peas, bell pepper, and carrots. The extra sauces add much more flavor, and the vegetables give a great texture and boost the dish's healthiness!

Great recipe but 1 tsp pepper is too much. I reduced it to just enough to season it - a few turns of the pepper mill. Taste great! Just like my fav resturant

I added brown sugar (for some sweetness), peas, carrots, green onions, and a little garlic.  Also some extra soy sauce due to the extra ingredients.  Turned out really well.

This was very good! I followed the recipe as is but I did add 1/2 cup of corn and 1/2 cup of peas. Will definitely make it again.

Simple, and easy to make...a great base to add other items. My husband liked it. I stuck to the recipe, but I think next time I will add some vegetables...carrots, green onions, peas. -Dancyn1

I cut this recipe in half for just me and I add a dash of teriyaki sauce for flavor. I also add a vegetable (peas or broccoli) to make it a complete meal. So easy and delicious!

Delicious, easy and quick. Used my left over turkey from Christmas dinner. Omitted the vegetables as my family wouldn't eat it that way. Was even able to sneak in some finely chopped onions by cooking them with the egg. Used chicken broth to cook my rice and instead of water with the egg. Will definitely make this again.

This was delicious!  I used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil and two eggs instead of one and it turned out great!  I want to double up on the recipe next time because there wasn't quite enough.

Worth 5 stars with my adjustments. I followed to a T, except to make it easier I used a large can of cooked chicken. Also added in a bag of steamed, mixed veggies. Gone in seconds! Super easy!

Thank you for this recipe! My husband and I both loved it! Here are my alterations..  Instead of using butter when cooking my rice, I used one tablespoon of coconut oil. It added a touch of sweet coconut flavor that went well with this recipe. I also added an extra egg, about a teaspoon of minced garlic with the onion, along with a sprinkling of cayenne pepper. Wonderful!

Really liked this recipe. Wanted no meat, as having Asian Lettuce Wraps, also from this site. All I did was substitute some green peas for the chicken, use no regular onion, just green onion, and a little more soy sauce.

I always look for recipes for fried rice when I have pork or poultry leftovers. This recipe was perfect for what I wanted. I read some of the reviews about the pepper after the fact but I only used half of what it calls for. I can always add more.  I believe this to be a basic recipe that you can add whatever you like. I will use again.

This was pretty good.  Don't think the taste of a restaurant can be duplicated with this recipe though.  I did add some teriyaki sauce, more soy sauce, used sesame oil, sesame seeds, added frozen peas and carrots, and green onions.  If these things weren't added I think it would have been pretty bland.  Even with these additions, it was just good, not great.  I'll have to tweak it a little more next time.

I used pork instead with a basamati rice I cooked flavored with curry and crushed red pepper.  I put the rice in the freezer for about 20 min, it done the trick, great recipe.

Made this recipe tonight. It was a big hit with my daughter, and sister (who is a more finicky eater). I usually have to ask for feed back when preparing a new recipe, this time I received two enthusiastic thumbs-up without asking. I did follow others advice and used 1 tbsp. sesame oil (instead of the veggie oil), 1 tbsp. oyster sauce, 1 tsp. ground ginger, and 1 tsp. minced garlic. 1 tsp. pepper was a bit much for me, so next time I'll use just 1/2 tsp. This is a great recipe to tweak to your liking. Thank you Lisa for sharing.

This was very good. Next time I make it I will do less pepper though. It was a bit too hot for my kids.

We have made this multiple times & love it! I do less than a half tsp of pepper & add frozen veggies

I made this just like the recipe, and it seemed bland. Mine was also a little soggy, but I suspect that the rice may have been a bit soggy before I added it. I probably won't make it again.

This turned out well. Following some other's reviews, I added some fresh ginger, finely chopped carrot and mushrooms.  I had some jasmine rice in the freezer that I used up for this dinner.  Topped with fresh chopped cilantro and added peanuts for some crunch.

Amazing!  I was surprised at how good it turned out.  The only change I made was to use veg oil instead of butter to cook the egg.  Fantastic recipe!  Making it again tonight!

We really enjoyed this! Only changes I made was to add garlic salt and poultry seasoning to the chicken and only used a 1/2 teaspoon of pepper. Definitely will make this again.

I doubled this recipe and it fed four people with a side of Szechwan Shrimp. As such, I removed the chicken and replaced it with frozen peas and carrots. Amazing! BUT, be warned! The recipe calls for 2 WHOLE onions for 4 cups of rice. I realized as I was chopping them up this was simply too much. I used about 1 1/4 onions (about 2 cups I want to say) and that was plenty. It tastes exactly like what you'd get at a nice Americanized  Chinese restaurant. Excellent!

I didn't have eggs or cooked chicken but I had raw chicken and a lot of leftover rice. I seasoned the chicken with garlic salt then sauteed/cooked it in butter, took it out then added more butter, cooked the carrots and onion then added the rice, black pepper, soy sauce and chicken. Still came out great even with the bare minimum!

This was tasty and really easy to make.  I didn't have any peas to add, and thought it really needed a little color, so I chopped up some fresh spinach and tossed it in with the onions until it slightly wilted. Next time I may add red bell pepper for a little more color.

Do NOT add the 1tsp of pepper! I doubled the recipe and so had to add 2tsp and it was SO much pepper that we couldn't even eat it. We ended up making more plain rice and just mixing it in, that made  it way better. We will definitely be making this again, just with 'pepper to taste' :)in even double checked that I put the right amount the recipe said, and I did... Not sure why it was so much.

Absolutely loved it! We always add fresh veggies towards the end and use an extra egg. I do agree that you need to make sure the rice is cold before mixing. Otherwise it gets mushy.

I have consistently used this recipe since I first found it here on Allrecipes a few months ago and I am making it for the second time in three days.  It was so popular when I served my friends this rice that they have asked me to make it for a dinner party they are having tonight.  Follow this recipe exactly and you will not be disappointed.

This recipe is great and so easy!!  I have made it several times.  After the first time, I did make a few changes according to my family's taste.  I used chopped green onions and added a bag of Birds Eye Asian Medley vegetables.  This recipe has made it into our regular rotation.

Very tasty rice!  I liked this much better than the local chinese restaurant's.  The only reason I gave it 4 instead of five stars is because it does not need that much pepper, it's just too much kick for me.  I should have read other reviews before making the recipe, but didn't have much time otherwise I would have known not to put that much pepper in.  And, make sure that you use "cold" recipe as the recipe states-it totally makes a difference.  I

I realized near the end that i used teriyaki sauce instead of soy. so i added a few splashes of that at the end.  either way i used way more sauce than the recipie.  I used about 4 tablespoons.  Yummers!!!!  It was a delish mistake.  I will do it this way each time.  This was my first time making my own fried rice.  I like mine better than  take out.

Quick and easy - and delicious.  Family loved it!  I even added in a little fresh, grated tofu and no one knew!  I appreciated the comment which said to let the rice cool.  Makes a difference with the frying!

This was good only thing I did differently was omit the chicken, I served this with thai chicken meatballs and a homemade sweet chile dipping sauce.

This is a good base recipe, not as good as a takeaway but good enough to fulfil any chinese/fried rice cravings! I strayed from the directions a bit: I used basmati rice instead of white rice. I fried the chicken with a drizzle of soy sauce and some garlic powder for more flavour, then added green onions, carrots, broccoli and frozen peas to make it a more satisfying and nutritious main meal. As a main its a bit dry but it's just fried rice so expected really, think I'll have it as just a side next time.

I made this with jasmine rice and added frozen peas.  Cooked the chicken and onions together at the beginning and then added everything else.  It was great!  I also halved the pepper as other reviewers suggested.

I thought this recipe was great. I don't understand why someone would give a 2 star rating with a comment like "GJESSICA11 - make sure the rice is cold". This justifies only 2 stars?

This is a great recipe! I did make some adjustments though. I cooked the egg in the microwave: beat the egg, pour it into a bowl that has been sprayed with pam, cook it for 30-45 sec. Also, I added mixed vegetables, which really added flavor!

This was great and easy.  I added a lot more vegetables than the recipe calls for, just buy the frozen bags of mixed Chinese vegetables.  It is much easier though to just scramble the egg.  I am not sure what the benefit is of cutting the egg into strips other than just wasting time.  Other than that the recipe is fantastic.  I also used less butter and less oil.  It's just not needed and the pepper is a little overwhelming so you may want to cut back on that as well.

This fried rice recipe was so good!!! I'm a college student and always looking for quick and easy recipes with fewer ingredients & this is great =)
-eggs provide protein
-rice provides fiber
-& the fact that extra soy sauce isn't needed with finished cooking lets some of that sodium originally there cook off!

GREAT GREAT GREAT recipe!

This was quick, easy, and delicious. However, the recipe claimed to be for 4 services, and was only enough for 2 servings when it was the one-dish meal I made it as. Would have liked to have more: maybe up the ingredients by 50%.

If you like the rice a little more sweet and less salty, try adding sugar to taste. This is a must for me. Also, peas and carrots make a good addition. Keeps and re-heats well, so make lots!

My only suggestion is to season the chicken while cooking it with some additional soy sauce and we cut the pepper back to 1/2 teaspoon and it was still overwhelming. Overall was great and we will make it again.

I doubled the egg & used green onion that I added at the same time as the eggs. I also added Chili Garlic Sauce (found in grocery store) along with the soy sauce. It gave it a little kick. I used brown rice instead of white. This is an AWESOME recipe!! Very easy!! He said peanuts or cashews would be nice.....I liked it without.

This was pretty good, but next time I will only use 1/4 teaspoon of pepper, it was way too overpowering for us. I added frozen peas and carrots and garlic.

Very good.  I used brown rice instead of white.  I cooked it fresh and rinsed with cold water as suggested by another reviewer.  Also, I used chicken thighs instead of breasts.  This is now a staple.

My husband really liked this and had thirds. All of my kids except one liked it too and my oldest had seconds. I thought it was missing something but that's okay. We didn't use onions and doubled it. Thanks!

I really needed a basic fried rice recipe and this was perfect! I substituted Tamari for Soy Sauce, added  frozen peas and small bits of semi-cooked carrots, and added red pepper flakes for kick. Thank you for sharing!!

I thought this recipe was great and very easy!  I added frozen mixed veggies, some ginger, and some red pepper flakes for spice.  It was great!

More of a canvas than a recipe, but a great base to work from.  Used brown rice (cooked in the am) and Chinese BBQ pork instead of chicken.  Added chopped peppers, green peas and green onion; ramped up flavour with sesame oil, fresh garlic and sambal olek (for heat).  Delish.  Takeout fried rice is pretty ho-hum.  This was excellent.

Edible. Way too much pepper, not enough soy sauce. Okay as a basic recipe but it needs to major alterations.

My husband is a fried rice fanatic, and he couldn't get enough of this stuff! We only add the chicken when it's our main dish - otherwise it makes a fantastic side. We used brown rice and added 2 cloves of garlic and some chopped green onions. Thanks for the recipe Lisa!

I used short grain brown rice and this did not seem to be a problem when used still warm.   I also add peas and sesame oil.  I sauteed green onions and this seems like a neat trick because I don't think my kids will detect them.

This is virtually the identical recipe in every single aspect, to what I have used for 30 years to make chicken fried rice.  I was taught this delicious recipe by the daughter of the owner of a Chinese restaurant.It is a favorite with my children and relatives, and guests are always amazed and rave about it.  Yet it is so easy to make, and great for a last minute meal, as I almost always have the ingredients on hand (I buy big bags of chicken breasts, boil, chop, and divide into one pound bags that I freeze for instant availability).  A few notes from my experience:   (1) You can even make the rice a day ahead, spread the cooked rice out onto a baking sheet (cover with a dish towel) and leave until the next day. When the rice is cool and dries out a bit, it stir fries much better.  (2) Green onion looks prettier.  I like to use it if I have on hand, otherwise any onion will do - and quantities are flexible - I often use more than in this recipe. (3) Frying it longer, I think makes it tastier.  (4) Optional - If desired, cook a small package of frozen peas and carrots (don't overcook! should be tender but not mushy.  I usually steam in microwave).  When fried rice is ready, stir in the cooked peas and carrots at the very end - adds some nice color and taste.  ( I only occasionally add for some tasty variation -- kids like this too very much).

Thanks for your recipe. 

I modified a little cause I think that's the great thing about it.... You can make to please who is eating it. 

I added chives instead of  onions, shrimp, chopped bacon, sugar snap peas, and julienne cut carrots at last sec, little thyme, celery salt too. BBQ my chicken breast with a little chicken rub and kraft onion bbq sauce and cut into thin slices once cooled completely. Omitted water, butter, and oil. Cooked it all in the bacon fat instead of oil. Bacon makes everything better:-) 

Easy to make and taste even better the next day.

Amazing!  It was just like chinese take out!  The only thing I did differently was to use brown rice instead of white, and a little extra soy sauce.  Such a delicious meal and great for lunch the next day!

The nicest thing about this recipe is how easy it is. So many times I have made Chinese recipes off this site and found that they were a lot of work for little payoff. This one is just the opposite.

This recipe was great! I used it as a side for fish. Very tasty. The soy was a bit strong so I think I'll cut it by a half a tbs or so next time. And I also didn't put any black pepper in it. I also used fresh jasmine rice, but I rinsed in cold water and then set it in the fridge while I prepped the rest of the meal. All in all this was very good and a definite redo.

This is not anything like our local favorite, but it was good and my kids really liked it. I did sautee two carrots (finely diced) with the onion and added some frozen peas. I left out the chicken because we don't eat poultry. I'll make it again because my family really likes it!

This is FANTASTIC. I don't think I'd change a single thing. I made it as the recipe says and it was delicious.... but then I made it again, and again, and again... and I've added a little to it. Now I almost double the soy and the onions. And don't overcook the onions, they taste better when they have a little crunch to them in this rice. I've done it where I added the weeks leftover pork, steak and ckn to it with peas and bean sprouts and it was out of this world. Really, really outstanding. Who knew making fried rice was so easy???

Absolutely LOVED how quick and easy this recipe was. From now on, now I know how to spice up my leftover rice. The family liked it and it'll definitely be a common plate at my house. The only thing I altered was adding half a can of mixed vegetables and one string of green onions. Thanks for the recipe!!

Tried this tonight.  I was looking for a recipe I could make without going to the grocery store.  Tastes just like my fav. resturant w/o all the extra sodium and calories.  I added broccoli to the ingredient list for a complete meal.

I made it according to the recipe and it was inedible.  Way too much pepper, essentially zero flavor otherwise.

Wow! This dish surprised me! Maybe I don't expect much from fried rice, but this recipe yielded my best attempt yet. Next time I'll probably cut back on the butter and oil by about a teaspoon, only half an onion and jazz it up with peas and green onions. That said, this is a great recipe as is!

Great recipe! This is my second time making it. I took suggestion of rinsing the cooked rice in cold water so it would not be sticky and it worked very well. I do think next time I will use sesame oil and add an extra egg. It's a keeper!

Wow this was so good. My very picky 1, 4 and 35 year old kids loved it! We switched up the butter and the oil. The butter is soaked up by the rice and makes it so smooth and creamy.

This tasted okay, but I felt it had too much soy sauce (I used a low sodium version).  I would also use less pepper and would replace some of the white/yellow onions with green ones.  It would also be nice to incorporate some veggies into it.  Overall it was good, just not anything like fried rice that I traditionally eat in restaurants.

Super tasty and VERY easy and fast.  It's a great go-to meal for my family as we usually have everything on hand.   We've made it several times and even have traded out the chicken for pork chops and that's been tasty too.

This was real yummy. I made sure rice was cold. I prepared everything before hand because it all comes together quickly. I added peas and carrots to this and green onions. I also used a fried rice seasoning I picked up at walmart. Delicious! Thanks for the recipe. I'm making this again tonight

Better than the restaurant's.  My husband ate two huge bowls full, leaving no leftovers.  I suggest a little less pepper and adding a 1/4 cup of frozen peas and carrots when frying.  Fantastic.

As is, this was ok.  Waayy to much pepper though.  I would recommend cutting it in half.  It's also missing a little something, maybe ginger and a pinch of salt.  We added peas and that made it a bit more of a rounded meal but of course veggies can be served on the side.  Will make again, but maybe tweak it a little next time.

This was a very tasty recipe for Chinese fried rice. I cooled my rice by running cold water in the pot and draining it a few times. Make sure when you make your rice that you quickly cool it and immediately place it in the pan to cook with the onion and egg. Very good stuff!

Great dish. Better than most take-out. I made a few changes. I used 3-cups Rice and 1-1/2 cups chicken. I substituted the veg. oil w/ sesame oil. I added 2-chopped green onions along w/ half yellow onion. I did not add the soy sauce, but instead used half a package of fried rice seasoning package w/ 2-tablespoons water. Came out awesome. I may add peas to the dish next time.

I used this recipe for my first attempt at making fried rice and it was awesome! My roomie is not a big veggie fan, so this was perfect for him and he LOVED it! In addition to the fried rice, I made the Chicken Lo Mein recipe from this site. I cooked all of the chicken according to the Lo Mein recipe then divided it between the Lo Mein and the Fried Rice... very tasty!!!! I love the idea of making this again and again, adding all sorts of different ingredients, as this recipe seems very versitile! Thank you for sharing!

Good base recipe- I've always wanted to try fried rice but figured I'd mess it up or something.  This was a good guide.  I definitely changed things up a bit- brown rice instead of white, no chicken, and 2 eggs, as well as a bunch of veggies (diced zucchini, green beans, etc.)  This will probably be my go to meal on those days when I just don't have energy to make something more complicated.  Thanks!

I thought "as is" that this recipe lacked a lot in flavor.  I'd give the recipe four stars after my additions--lots of fresh ginger, garlic and a splash of teriyaki.

This dish was delicious!  I added a tablespoon of curry powder, a mini can of peas and carrots and small shrimp at the end and it got rave reviews.  Due to time constraints, I had to use hot rice, but it didn't seem to cause an issue.  Finish with a squeeze of lime and you have a Thai version that will impress!

This is really good, however, there is too much pepper in it for my husband and I, so I don't usually put that much.  I also usually omit the chicken and use this as a side dish! Very good, just be cautious of the pepper.

Great recipe... I was short on time so I cooked the rice, rinsed in cold water and put into the fridge.  Used sesame instead of vegetable oil, added broccoli and corn. Great quick meal with lots of options for whatever you have on hand!

Quick easy, and as a bonus, I used (cold) leftover white rice from a recent Chinese takeout meal.   Also used sesame oil for extra flavor.  I added Chinese 5 spice to the mix, along with a mixture of low sodium soy and teriyaki sauces for a salty/sweet taste.  Peas and carrots for color, and we had a complete meal...  Yum!!

Delicious!  I added some cut up carrot to mine, and left out the chicken altogether.  However, it would be easy and yummy to add chicken from a rotisserie chicken you can buy in the grocery store.

This chicken fried rice is a great, quick meal to make. It isn't nearly as delicious as the kind you get in restaurants, but it has wayy less calories (the restaurants usually load theirs up with tons of butter!), so it evens out.

YUM.  Love this recipe.  I cooked it for my son and he requested it again the next night.  We used half the pepper the 2nd night and liked it even better.

Update: I use minced onion as it is much easier and usually triple the recipe.  We heat it up as left overs and add a little butter to keep it moist.

Good recipe since you can add and omit to it easily.  I just thought it was too much pepper next time I make I'll try half a teaspoon maybe less.

This was very quick and easy.  It had a delicious flavor!  Do not however add a teaspoon of pepper to the recipe.  I added 1/2 tsp and it was still too spicy for my children.  They loved the flavor, but couldn't handle the spice.  I will definitely make it again and just pepper to taste.

This recipe is great because it has very little ingredients. Alot of recipes on here have a ton of spice that I just don't have! I followed some suggestions and fried the onion and added 2 cloves of garlic in butter. Also, after I cooked the chicken, i let it sit in some soy sauce while i prepared the rest like someone suggested. I agree about the pepper. I only used about half a tablespoon and it was just right for me (and I like a little kick!) Will make again with some veggies like peas and carrots :) Thanks for the recipe!

I usually dislike fried rice, so I was VERY happily surprised to find out that this was delicious - and my girlfriend, who likes fried rice, loved it too! She's begging me to make more and we just had it two days ago! I think the pepper is what gives it a good kick. It reheats well (if you even have leftovers!). Definitely a recipe I will keep making. It's cheap, easy, and quick. Word to the wise: do make sure everything's chopped before you start, because this cooks quick. It works best when two people are working together in the kitchen!

This was okay. I think it might be better with green onions instead of a regular onion, and with the addition of peas & carrots.

This was awesome! My husband said it was the best he had ever had.  I thought it had a little to much pepper so next time I will cut it down a little.  I also added more chicken than it called for.

This was good.  I think that next time I might add a few other spices to make it a tad more flavourful

Decent.  I used the crockpot to cook my chicken and it was very good like that, but overall, the taste was decent.  not bad. not wonderful.

Delicious, VERSATILE, easy, budget friendly, and not unhealthy.  Love that I can make this with ingredients I already have on hand.  Staying in the rotation, very nice.

I think this could've been a great recipe, but the amount of black pepper was definitely overpowering. Too strong for my taste. I'm thinking of definitely cutting back on the pepper next time!

This is great dish! , I  added peas and carrots, I didn't have veg oil so I used Extra Virgin Olive oil which I don't recommend. That left an odd after taste. Beside that  my boys and Husband loved it !

Fast, simple and easy!  I was able to throw this together in 10 minutes and sit down for a meal after a busy day at work while my daughter napped.  I used shredded chicken (what I had on hand) and added some powdered ginger.  Next time I may add some peas/carrots and/or try with another protein such as pork or shrimp.

Very tasty dish.  Found it to be cumbersome putting it all together.  I took the advice of letting the rice get cold.  However, I think I overcooked the rice.  The finished product was a bit mushy.  Although, very tasty.  Will try this recipe again.

My goodness. This turned out so good.  I did tweek it a bit for my tastebuds.  I added a combo of sesame oil and olive oil to do the onions and added garlic.  Then I added the carrots and celery, waited a minute, added some chopped asparagus and red pepper flakes.  Followed the rest of the recipe except for the pepper.  Turned out fantastic. Will most definitely make again.

This turned out pretty good. I added a small can of peas and carrots and I also added some green onion.  Be very careful with the pepper. Mine came out a bit too spicy. Start small and then add more as you go. I would say to begin with like 1/4 tsp and work your way up.

I used Tyson's roasted chicken breast. I also added garlic with the onion and celery for a little color and crunch. I used sesame oil in place of the vegetable oil. Yummy!

A very easy basic recipe.  The flavor was ok but, my daughter and I both agreed that it's missing something. My husband really liked this so, I will probably tweak and make again.

great recipe! Hubby and I loved it! I did change only a few things. I added an extra egg because I love the eggs in fried rice and wished there was more. I also added a little extra soy sauce and some peas. Yummy!

this dish came out great.. i customized it a little by subsituting the onion with green onion (added a nice flavor) also i cut out th egg and added some bacon that i had already fried in a seperate skillet. the dish came out great, and i will most likely continue making it.

This recipe would not be appropriate for a week night dinner unless you already had the rice pre-made & cold and the chicken pre-cooked and ready to go. I did not, so it took far longer than 15 min to prep/serve this dish. As well, I couldn't wait for the rice to fully cool (people were hungry), so it was used hot. The rice was sticky/gluey either because it was used hot or because of the type I used. Flavour-wise, it was a very nice dish. Given the above comments, on a week-end (when you have the time) this would probably be a 4*.

It was ok.  It would have been better with slightly less soy sauce I think.  But then again, I didn't measure the soy sauce with a spoon, so maybe I didn't do a very good job of eye-balling it!  I used brown rice, which was still good!

This is a great base recipe! We have been using it for a few years now and it's a family favorite. The egg comes out perfect.  We like adding bell pepper and sometimes other veggies. We usually use BBQ Pork instead of chicken. YUM! ~Oh yeah, I do 1/2 the pepper; that was the only needed change to original recipe, for my family's taste.

Very good recipe. If you follow the recipe here and don't add anything else its a little plain but relatively simple and tastey. if you want to add veggies its takes a little more prep time. All and all a good recipe.

Good basic recipe but stuck badly to my pan -- maybe more oil needed?  Also I added garlic & chili paste (red stuff in plastic bottles in grocery store) - yummy!

This was a good dish. I added some mushrooms to the onion at the beginning, and threw in some leftover peas & carrots. I also used sesame instead of veg oil. Very easy to make, especially since I had leftover rice, chicken, and veggies waiting to be used in something!

I really enjoyed this, If your planning on making this you can add your egg during your 5 min. rest period of cooking then let it cook in. This way you eliminate a step and just put it into to fridge for when you plan on making your fried rice.

Very easy and very good. Hubby went back for seconds and kept raving about it being so good.  I cooked rice and marinated chicken strips in terriyaki sauce the night b4. Also I added a half pkg of frozen stir fry vegetables.  As some others stated you may want to cut back on the soy sauce.  I will definitely be making this one several more times...loved it!

I just used the template for this recipe. I changed it up ALOT. First off, I left the egg out. I added green onions, chilli flakes, corn, peas, and carrots. As for the chicken. I made strips and marinated them in chilli poweder (just a bit), chilli flakes, ginger and garlic paste, and salt. I let it sit for about 5 mins, and then I grilled the strips. I put some Wostishire sause in addition to the soy sause. and I put in the strips on top of the rice. It actually came out really scruptious. I wish I had added cabbage though! Good eatings!

This was easy and came out tasty.  I had some cold chicken cutlets to use up.  Instead of using onion (hubby won't eat) I sauteed minced garlic and chopped fresh carrots in olive oil.  As someone suggested, I rinsed the cooked rice in cold water to help it cool off before refrigerating for 1.5 hours.  Also, I used less pepper, and I marinated the chicken in soy sauce before cooking as someone suggested.  I added salt with the pepper.  Very satisfying light meal.   Thanks!

I'll give it a 5 since it's simple and good. I prefer scrambled eggs in fried rice over the strips. But I'm glad I tried that method. I always add garlic in with the onions and more soy sauce!

was enjoyable not much for a main course but great for a side. Might lower the pepper a bit because you can always add to taste but not take away.

This one's a winner! I did what another reviewer did and cooked the rice then rinsed under cold water instead of preparing beforehand. I also added peas and chopped carrots. I may add some chopped ham next time as well. Used a little over half the pepper it called for. Great meal the kids all loved.

Great recipe, tastes even better than my favorite Asian restaurant.  I sauteed frozen peas, a clove of garlic and finely diced carrots with the onions.  For the best results, use COLD rice.  I like Jasmine rice, once you use it, you will not go back to Uncle Bens! My family gobbled it up.  Next time I will try to make it with shrimp and maybe add a little ginger.  Thanks Lisa!

Absolutely fantastic!  I used brown rice instead of white, PAM instead of butter and olive oil instead of vegetable oil to make it healthier.  I also substituted frozen peas for the onion because we don't care much for onion.  But I'm sure it would be just as great or even better if I'd followed the recipe exactly too.  This was delicious and sooooo fast and easy.  Will definitely make again and again!

I made this recipe exactly as it stated. (For the chopped chicken I used some leftover chicken that I had baked in a light marintate.)  This was very good however there is too much pepper for me & my family's liking, that's why I deducted a star; it overpowers the whole dish.   I would suggest a 1/4 tsp. to 1/2 tsp. of ground black pepper.  The flavor is excellant, in the future I might try chopped ham and/or vegetables as a variation to the recipe.

This was EXCELLENT!  Tasted very similar to the take out stuff.  I liked this better because I know what's in it and I can control the oil.  I did make a few minor adjustments.  I cut down the pepper.  A few turns of the pepper mill should do it.  I also sauted some minced up carrot along with the onion.  When adding in the chicken I added a minced up clove of garlic.  At the end I threw in a handful of frozen peas.  Very good chicken fried rice and I liked that it wasn't overloaded with salt like some of the other recipes I have tried.

This turned out very well. I used canned chicken breast and minute rice. I put the rice in the fridge after cooking as some suggested. I will absolutely make this again, but I will use regular rice instead of Minute rice, just to see the difference. Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

Absolutely delicious, and so easy!  I did the oil half hot sesame oil/half canola.  If I had not changed a thing, this would still be truly yum!

I microwaved a bag of asian veggies and threw those in at the end along with some peas I had left over from another recipe.  I used more soy sauce and prepped my chicken, rice and onion the night before.  Turned out great!

I have made tons of recipes from this site, but very rarely post a review.  This was SO AWESOME though that I had to write one!  I doubled the recipe - made the rice in the morning and then just put it in the refridgerator.  I added more soy sauce than the recipe called for (I used the low sodium), so that all of the rice was coated.  Instead of chicken, at the end I added shrimp, pork, and beef (all cooked in advance), so it was more of a combo fried rice.  I also added peas.  My husband said it was better than the rice at any chinese restaurant we eat at - we loved it.  And it heats up well the next day too - we will be making this often!    Thanks for the recipe!!!  n.b. - I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.

Great recipe!  I pre cooked my chicken in Pure Sesame Oil, added my veggies and pre cooked rice, then the soy sauce & pepper.  I then cleared the center of the pan and cooked/scrambled the eggs (2).  I did not need the water or butter this way. - I've posted 2 photos - One with eggs, one without.

I made this last night and it was a great way to use leftover rice and chicken. I wish I could have added a bit more flavor to end the product - maybe add in oyster or hoisin sauce?

Excellent and so easy!  I will try sesame oil next time though as others have noted.  The rice MUST be day old or at least in refrigerator for 2 hours after letting the moisture escape or your rice will be mushy.  Also don't use more than the recommended sauce.  This could also make the rice mushy.

I wavered back and forth between 3 & 4 stars but decided to go with 4 because it is tasty and it is easy. My only hang up is that i don't think it tastes as much like the local restaurant as I would have thought given the rave reviews of others. I echo another reviewer in saying it's good, I'll make again, but it doesn't quite satisfy the craving of the real stuff. Next time I'm going to try the seseme oil and see if that makes a difference.

I didn't make any changes to the recipe and somehow my rice came out almost black! 2 TBSP was way too much soy sauce! Next time I will make it with less soy sauce and less chicken aswell since I usually serve rice as a side dish and serve chicken separately. :)

This recipe tasted ok, my main problem is that it is so bland as is, and not even extra veggies could revive it.  I also think that using the amount of pepper it says is way too much so I used half.  Its a good recipe to be able to say, hey, I made fried rice!  But its not the recipe that would make you want to go through the effort instead of making the phone call to your local Chinese restaurant.  Yes, its vital that you use cold rice. What I did was that same week I made rice for another dish, and made double the rice.  I put the extra rice into a ziploc bag, then froze it.  At the time of making the chinese rice, I put it into a bowl, sprinkled some water and microwaved until it was cold but no longer frozen.  The rice itself and everything came out great, its just now I'm at the point where I know I can make the fried rice, I just need a recipe that makes me say "wow" and this is not it.

I thought this was great! I added to peas to it as well as Ginger Soy. I accidently used too much, so I had to add a tiny bit of Splenda to cut the saltiness but it still came out very good! Next time, I will try to add more veggies. Glad I finally know how to make fried rice. I gave 4 stars only because you have to season this to your specified taste but this is a terrific base recipe.

I'm giving this 4 stars only because I didn't think it tasted at all like chinese chicken fried rice that I've gotten at any chinese restaurant.  Other than that, it's a really tasty dish and quite quick and easy to make.  However, I did add more chicken than the recipe called for only because I was using it as a main dish and needed it to be a bit more filling.  Overall, I was pretty satisfied with this recipe.  Thank you! :)

Great recipe for leftover chicken. I use brown rice and make it the night before. First, I saute the onion, then scramble the egg with it and add the remaining ingredients. Just make sure to have them all at the stove...it goes quick. An easy recipe to half if you choose, still using 1 egg.

I loved the flavor of this dish.  There was too much onion and needed alittle more soy sauce.  I will scramble the egg in the dish next time because the shredded egg fell apart.  Otherwise easy and very tasty.

I only rated this a 4 just because I changed it just a little bit.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, I only used 1/2 and onion, added a little garlic with the onion, didn't add chicken (just cause I didn't have any) and I didn't use pepper at all.  I will admit it didn't have huge flavor but it reminded me of the rice you get at the Japanese restaurants.  Next time I will probably add some peas and carrots and chicken but I think it'd be excellent with shrimp too!  I will definitely be making this again when I get my Chinese/Japanese cravings, it's so easy!

this is a great recipe ... i would only add and change a couple of things.   first i would add another egg, but that's just me, and i would scramble them!   second, i would add vegetables, like corn, carrots, green beans, peas, etc.   other then that this recipe is perfect and taste great!

Great side dish!  I added peas and a clove of garlic. I didnt add pepper (per others reviews) or the chicken because I used as a side dish. I used COLD bulgar wheat and it turned out great!

This was pretty good.  It tasted a little like just rice with lots of soy sauce. I did add bean sprouts and I liked the cool crunch of them.  I also added peas.  Will probably make this again but was hoping for a more unique flavor.

We loved this recipe !!!! I cooked chicken with garlic, salt, and pepper. I used less onion and pepper. I added frozen vegetables and a bit more soy sauce. It turned out delicious. I had to hide the left overs for lunch ;)

A very solid recipe that will be a staple from me from now on!  Some tips: (1) Use less pepper.  (2) Use less onion; I found even 1/2 onion was too much.  (3) More seasoning, perhaps some garlic salt or Maggi seasoning.  (4) Cook the chicken in soy sauce or let it sit in some soy sauce after cooking.  (5) Add veggies.

This was a great recipe I altered it a bit.  I chopped up some garlic also to go along with the onions very tasty!.  Also had to put extra soy sauce to give it the chinese stir fry taste to it.  As far as the pepper goes I would recommend a dash b/c if you use more than a dash it will be spicy. I put a dash of salt also. I didn't add any chicken I made this recipe and served chicken wings very delicious!!!

This is a recipe that begs for you to make it your own.  My twists: 1) Household vegetable oil is not really suited to high-temperature stir frying and it can add some odd popcorn taste.  I use extra light-tasting olive oil - adds nice smoothness without affecting taste.  Technically, peanut oil is probably the most authentic. 2) I add in soy sauce by sight just for color and let the diners add more for taste. 3) Stir-frying the meat with some seasoning that complements the soy sauce in the rice.  Five-spice and a hint of sugar, or ginger are good options. 4)  Thawed veggies (peas and carrots) and a little water chesnut are nice touches.   5)  Sorry, I'm not patient enough to use cold rice.  I microwave the rice while I stir fry the meat and then everything is done in just over 30 minutes.

I love this recipe.  My son loves fired rice and I was sick of spending 10 bucks for take out 3 days aweek.  Growing Teen he is.   So, I started making this and now I add veggies.  I love scallions and I add at least a 1/4 of a cup.  I added carrots and red peppers to the onions after the onions are done.  Next time, I will add more carrots as our 5 year old loved them.    I followed the veggie cooking directions from the Chinese Chicken Fried Rice I.

I had tons of left over rice and had to triple this recipe but it turned out great.  I did have to cook eggs longer (probably bc I had tripled it) and I would have used a little less pepper next time.  Also, I added bacon instead of chicken cause that's what I had on hand...  Everyone loved it!

Fantastic, basic fried rice recipe.  I didn't have chicken on hand, so I did what my (Chinese) grandfather used to do - I used Spam, cut into small chunks.  Sure, it's not the healthiest (even though I went for the low sodium option), but it actually lends a great flavor to it.  I also substituted brown rice for white (as I usually tend to do nowadays for any recipe that calls for rice), which gave it a great, full-bodied flavor.  This is a good recipe because you can build on it and add or subtract ingredients without really changing the basics.  Think I'm going to try this with pineapple next, like another reviewer did.

Not so much pepper. That throws the recipe off from being an authentic take-out chicken fried rice. I added some peas and sub. 1/2T oil for sesame oil.

Holy Pepper Monkey!  Toooo much pepper for us!  Otherwise, it is very tasty and I will make it again, but with about 1/2 the amount of pepper.

This recipe was very very good.  I didn't follow the directions exactly.  I made a larger amount, so I did 3 eggs.  I did not add water to the egg because I was not quite sure what the reasoning behind that was.  I sauteed some sliced fresh mushroom in butter, and added this to the rice.  When I cooked my chicken, I cooked it with a few tbsp of soy sauce, so it would have more flavor.  Each child had 3 servings at dinner tonight!  It was delicious!

Yum!  I added peas, carrots and green onions.  I omitted the sauteed onions because of the green going on top.    Made again on 5/7 and followed the recipe but used chicken, pork and shrimp as the meat.  Did not add any vegetables.  This was better than the first time I made it!  Upgraded to five stars.

This recipe was awesome! I wasn't sure how it would taste, I even had leftovers from the night before on standy. The only problem with this recipe....we didn't have enough :) Next time I might double the recipe. I used brown rice and cooled it under cold water. I also used sesame oil instead of veggie oil. More authentic flavor. And lots of soy sauce. Also added some peas. Perfection!

I am in college and made this! Pretty Easy, mixing it all together in tiny like wok can be hard. I used 2 eggs because that is my favorite part, but I think next time I might use 3 eggs. I added a little bit more peas and corn.

I've made this several times and it always turns out great.  A few changes: I use brown rice instead of white, use sesame oil, and add 1/2 cup shredded carrot.  It's so good and so easy!

This is a very good recipe.  I left out the chicken and added carrots and peas to serve with the Asian Lettuce Wraps from this site.  My rice was a little pastey, I know that is my fault and not the recipes.  Do make sure your rice is cold before stirfrying.

An outstanding fried rice recipe. My wife and I enjoyed making it together and eating it also. The only modifications we made was mixing the chicken with a little bit of soy sauce and a pinch of black pepper before cooking it. Turned out to be as good as most fried rice we’ve got in restaurants. Good job.

This was really good!  I followed the recipe for the most part, but also added some extra stuff that I had... peas, carrots and beans cooked frozen veggies and chopped cooked mushrooms.  I also used leftover rotisserie chicken for the chicken.  We really liked this!  It was very good.  I did enjoy the extra veggies because it was a good, easy way to get those into our meal!

Followed the recipe to the tee and it is very bland.  It is pretty much just chicken and rice.  Def won't make again.

Great fried rice! Better than in restaurants! Instead of chicken I used pork and added some frozen peas. Definitely will use this recipe again.

Very surprised at how good and easy this was! I made a few alterations, though. I used brown rice (it was what I had on hand). Since I had chicken in the other dish I was serving, I omitted the chicken from the rice and just added a chicken bouillion cube to the water that cooked the rice. About 1 cup of frozen peas and carrots were added near the end. This recipe was very good especially when considering how easy it was and with the ingredients being common. This one went into the recipe box.

This was delicious!  I live in Fl and it's very hard to find a good Chinese Restaurant.  I'm glad I found this recipe and I could still enjoy some good Chinese rice.  My kids and husband loved it.  I did make some changes, I omitted the pepper (too spicy for my kids)and added chopped pieces of cooking ham.  SOOOO Yummy!  This is a definite keeper and now I know what to do with my leftover rice (no food wasted).  Thanks.

I made this recipe as is, and I thought it was pretty bland.  I guess I'm in the minority, since it is highly rated.  I do think, however, that with some minor changes that this could be really good.  I think using sesame oil is a must for any fried rice recipe. I would also make sure to use really good soy sauce and increase the amount, decrease the pepper, and add peas and ginger.  I will try this again with those changes.

This was the easiest and best homemade fried rice ever. I added a little garlic paste as suggested by another review and 2 baby carrots sliced thin and chopped. I only made 1 serving of it because i didnt want to waste it if it didnt come out good needless to say I will be making it again tonight for my husband when he comes home. Thanks Again!!

I have made this recipe several times now because its so quick, easy, and delicious!  Nowadays I add frozen stir-fry veggies to add color and nutrition, but it is great without too!  An all-around excellent meal!

Had to tweak it up with a bit of garlic, chinese 5 spice, extra soy sauce, touch of ginger & LOTS of green onions.

Very, very good. I just tossed in some carrots and mushrooms to add more color and it was fabulous. Goes great with the Best Egg Rolls, a recipe I got from this site as well.

This recipe was great!  It was a last minute decision for me to make it, so I made the rice, put it in a shallow pan and stuck it in the freezer to cool it down to the right temperature (cold). I Followed the directions pretty thoroughly, I did find that one tablespoon of butter for the egg was a bit much.  next time I'll just spray with cooking spray.  I had the left overs for lunch today, and you know, it was better the second time around! Next time I'll make the rice ahead of time and add some mushrooms.

Be sure not to overcook rice.  Hubby thought it was too oniony...use less next time.  But was pretty tasty overall.  I had never made friend rice before.

Awesome. I basically followed the recipe but added some shrimp, as well as chicken. I also added some peas and green onions when I mixed in the rice (which I cooked the previous day before and refrigerated. I'll definitely make it again.

I made the mistake of not reading the reviews before making this one and it was a LOT of pepper--we jokingly called it pepper fried rice.  That said, we ate it anyway.  Next time I think I'll use about a quarter of the pepper and expect it to be wonderful!

This is very good, but I doubled the recipe and left the pepper the same and it was still too much pepper!  I'm from the south so I love spicy, but the pepper just didn't taste right in this dish.  Next time I will cut the pepper in half, but I will make it again.

This was delicious! I had some leftover roast chicken (the white meat) so I decided to try this recipe. My boyfriend and I loved it. The only things I changed were to add some chopped spinach when frying the onions (and I added some garlic, just one clove, while frying the onions too). I also threw in a few frozen peas after the spinach had wilted. So quick and easy and really tasty. Perfect for busy nights or when you have leftover chicken. (Although I'd add the spinach and peas or else it's not too high on nutrients, got to get your Five-A-Day, after all)

I made this for dinner last night, and my husband and I both loved it.  I used brown rice and cooked it in chicken broth to give it more flavor.  I also added about a cup of cooked frozen peas for more color and nutrition.  I did not add the pepper the recipe called for, simply because I don't care for pepper all that much.  I just ground a dash of fresh pepper over top just before serving.  We will have this one often.

Awesome fried rice!  Really easy too. I excluded the chicken because I used the rice as a side dish for Kung Pao Chicken (also from allrecipes) and doubled the recipe to serve 6. Aside from the chicken, I followed the recipe exactly, and the results were perfect. Thanks!

This was a really good recipe with the exception of the amount of pepper added.  Cut way back on the black pepper or you won't be able to taste anything else.  You could probably even do with it.

Definitely easy.  It's good, but is missing something.  I will try again, but make the rice in chicken broth like others suggested.  This will probably be the missing link... I hope.  :)

Like others have said, doesn't taste like restaurant, but good in its own way.  My 11 yr. old loved it and wanted more!

Mmmmm this was good!  Only reason I knocked off 1 star is because it doesn't really taste like restaurant fried rice, but it's good in its own right.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  Super easy.  I didn't have any soy sauce so I substituted Terriyaki sauce.  It was pretty good, but I am definately using soy sauce next time.  Since this was a last minute recipe, I cooked my rice and then popped it in the freezer for about 30 minutes, stirring a few times.  Will make again.

This is so easy to make!  I am a stay at home mom and love that a lot of prep can be done in the morning, and then you just throw everything together right before dinner.  Less pepper for sure. Used a store bought rotisserie chicken which made it even easier.  Very good!

Loved this recipe. Added some snow peas. Cooked chiken thigh meat in mirin and soy sauce with red pepper flakes prior to cooking the rice dish, so added about 5 min. to the time. This recipe is amazing. I wish I had some leftover rice from the Chinese restaurant to use, I had cooked my rice 2 night earlier to use with a different recipe and my rice is just always a little starchy. Still we ate every little morsel I can't wait to try it with the restaurant rice.

This recipe was awesome! It turned out really good! I had a red and green bell pepper in the fridge, so I chopped those up and sauteed those with the onions as well. I did have to add a little bit more soy sauce, but overall - it was just like the restaurant!

This was really good!  Take the previous posters advice - make sure everything is ready prior to cooking.  I used canned chicken breast and heated it through with some EVOO and about a tablespoon of soy sauce.  I didn't scramble the egg, but cooked two of them and cooked them fried-egg style and then chopped them up and put them over the chicken while I did everything else.  I used a small onion and added two chopped cloves of garlic.  Make sure the rice is cold and if it's lumpy, make sure you break the lumps up before adding it.  Used about a tablespoon more soy than called for and did about 1/2 tsp of black pepper and 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes.  It was really good!

This was SO easy to do and great tasting.  Thank you for sharing this recipe, it will definitely be a part of my collection.  I added peas to get the greens in and even my finicky eaters (including my hubby) loved it.

Thanks again!

My whole family loved this chicken fried rice!  The first time I made it though, I followed the recipe exactly - too much pepper for me!  I've cut that significantly since.

Very flavorful. My family enjoyed it and the only thing we did was cut the pepper in 1/2 and added a little more soy sauce (our preference). Thank you so much for a great tasting meal. I have my own recipe was too lazy to make it and wanted an easier one. :)  I think this makes more than 3 servings also. I have a family of 6 and I'd say it'd for sure feed 4 to 6 people depending on portions. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I have made a few variations of Fried Rice, and for some reason, the flavor was never right... THIS was right!! So easy! I do think it is important for the rice to be cold, and I wonder if that is what I have done wrong in the past. I am having my leftovers for lunch this afternoon!!

We really liked this recipe. I was surprised that just adding pepper gave it so much spice. It was good, but I might experiment with other spices next time. Also, it made 3 small servings, but the recipe would have fed 2 people more comfortably than three. We'll be making this again!

Good, simple- does not taste like fried rice from restaurants, but is likely healthier and still very good!   Will make with shrimp next time.  I served it with the Baked Teriyaki Chicken recipe from this website. Makes for very yummy leftovers!

I'm very disappointed with this recipe. It wasn't three servings if it was intended to be a main dish, and it was very bland. It really didn't resemble any fried rice I've ever had in Chinese restaurants. The black pepper wasn't adequate as the only spice. I'm not really sure what you could do to salvage this recipe, but adding peas is definitely a start. At least it made me respect how good the fried rice is at my favorite restaurant.

To die for.....this was perfect. I used cubed ham verses chicken because that is our preference. Also, I fried up the egg with Pam rather than butter to save calories. Added frozen peas, and plan on substituting sesame oil for vegetable oil next time.
It was totally awesome, and I have decided I won't be ordering takeout fried rice any more. Served with a Chicken Lo Mein also from this site.
Thanks for sharing!!!!

I omitted the chicken so we could just have fried rice along with our Kung Pao Chicken(from allrecipes.com) dish. We threw in some mixed vegetables and some chicken broth to give it a bit more flavor.

This was really good. I was worried because rice gets so hard when you let it sit but it softened right up. Very tasty. Next time I think I will add some more veggies. I also used vegetable broth to cook the rice in instead of water.

This rice is great!!  the only change i made was that I left out the pepper and added frozen green peas.  We had this last night and my children already want to know when we are having it again...

This recipe was very easy to make.  I did take the suggestion of adding some peas and carrots.  It was delicious. I will definitely make it again.

I just used this recipe as a backbone.  I added peas, corn, oyster sauce, chicken, and ginger spice.
Turned out pretty good.  I will use again as it had good tips.

This is a great compliment to take-out chinese rice. Did not have chicken so made it without and it still tasted wonderful! Making sure rice is cold throughout is key to this recipe. A keeper.

I made this for my husband's birthday, along with a few other dishes.  This was the best!  It didn't take too much effort at all, which allowed me to work on the other dishes.  I added a bit of garlic salt just for personal flavor, but the recipe was great without it.

I thought this was very good.  I made a chinese dinner for my whole family yesterday and this rice went very well with all the other foods.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because if you were to eat this on it's own I think it might need a little more added to it.  I plan to add to this recipe a bit but it is a great start.  Thank you.

I gave this a five because it was really good and super fast.  I added shrimp instead of chicken and green onions and peas.  It taste like my favorite chinese restaurants shrimp fried rice.

Loved it!!  I added some peas and sweetcorn to add a bit of colour/flavour and also used garlic powder and extra soy sauce.  My boyfriend loved it, will definately be making this again.

I really like this recipe, though next time I will use half the pepper, it was a little too much for me.  I also added sliced mushrooms, celery and chopped red bell pepper. I barbequed the chicken which gave it a really nice flavor, will definately make again!

I thought this rice was VERY tasty. I used Uncle Ben's Ready Rice and canned chicken breast. I also added about 1/2 a can of peas/carrots. It turned out great and I didn't even let the cooked rice cool before sautéing in the skillet.

Not bad.  I used shrimp in place of the chicken, but I think I will have to add some shredded veggies to be more tasty.

This is excellent! I used Pam instead of butter and I used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil. I also added chopped carrots and celery to the onion. I used white, red and green onion. I personally thought that the black pepper was too much but the rest of my family thought it was ok. We usually double this for our family of 4 since we all love it so much. This is also great without the meat for a side or with the chicken. We even add peas and more chicken sometimes to make this a complete meal!

I was very pleased with the simpicity and the results of this recipe. I normally do not add the chicken, but the fried rice by itself is wonderful. Most of the time when I am cooking the onion, I will chop up some baby carrots and add that and a box of frozen green peas.

This is a great recipe. A wonderful way to use up the leftovers. We added some bean sprouts and some carrots, for extra flavor. This is a new family favorite. Thank you so much for sharing.

This is how I have made my fried rice for years. I never added chicken. I have tried it with shrimp. I think shrimp goes well with it. I will try it with chicken sometime. Thanks for the idea.

not a bad recipe, added celery.  I would make it again, but may experiment with the spices.
