These cookies turned out much better than I thought they would.  I just made them because I had hard-boiled eggs left over from easter.  They had an excellent light and pastry-like texture, while the orange zest gave them a really delightful flavor.  I will absolutly make them again.

This recipe was terribly difficult as cookies go, burned in under 8 minutes, and has virtually no flavor. I would NOT recommend this.
