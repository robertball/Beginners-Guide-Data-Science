Yum!! A weeknight Winner! This was easy to prepare and with on-hand ingredients it was a cinch to make. I added extra garlic and chili's to the vegetable mixture rather than at the end of cooking. And mixed the sauce in the same pan rather than a separate pot as that was simpler. I also added some Sriracha to the sauce to give it a little more heat. When I was making this I thought some sliced ginger might be a nice addition, but I don't miss it, it's perfect the way it is. The peanuts are what really makes this dish, so don't skip them! I also used really flavorful concentrated chicken stock (low sodium) sometimes your ingredients can make or break the dish! I did add some green onions for a final touch which added some freshness and brightness. I will definitely make this again!

This was an easy weeknight recipe that I really thought we would like, but unfortunately, we found it tasted like it was missing something. I followed the recipe except for using skinless chicken thighs, and thin buckwheat noodles. I will make it again, adding some peanut butter and sweet chili sauce to give this recipe some depth.
