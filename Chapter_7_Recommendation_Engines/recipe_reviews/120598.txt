I took this to a cookout and doubled the batch so there would be enough. Almost everything else was wiped out, but there was still a half a pan of this stuff left. Most people thought it was just "OK", including myself. I probably won't make again, especially considering the cost of the artichokes.

this was pretty good. I had o adjust, as i only had one can of artichokes and when i went to store to get a can, they were all out. So i halved it, and made enough for me. this is a definante keeper.

Very yummy.  I'd bake for a little bit longer so the cheese is mixed in really well.

Didn't turn out well at all. It was very runny and bland. Will probably play around with it some more and see if I can change my mind.

My husband and I thought this was pretty good.  The only change I made was that I used frozen artichokes instead of canned.  I won't be making it again but if you had it at your dinner party I would eat it.

It was a little bland for my taste and felt like it was missing something.  It turned out a bit runny too.  My friends husband loved it but I was not a big fan.

Just ok.  Everyone at Thanksgiving dinner must have thought so too because I took home over half a pan home after everyone had packed away leftovers.

My husband thought this was worth 5 stars. I wasn't as impressed. So I'll compromise & give it a 4.

These were fabulous, I made this for a side dish for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it.  Needs no changes, perfect recipe. I would rate it higher than a 5 but there is no option.

Not being a big fan of artichokes, I didn't know if I'd like this.  Found it to be very rich and different!  This is a great side dish at Christmas or Easter, especially since it's unique.

FANTASTIC! I got a little over-excited with the paprika, but it was still good. :)
