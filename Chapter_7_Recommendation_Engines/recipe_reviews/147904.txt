Very refreshing drink. Would recommend 1 liter of lemon lime seltzer water and 1 liter of lemon lime soda if you don't want it to be too sweet.

This is recipe is really good.  Highly recommend letting it sit for a few hours before drinking so you get the flavor of the cucumber.

This was fantastic...I needed some creative ways to use up extra cucumbers and this worked wonderfully. Everyone who was brave enough to try it ended up loving it. Tastes better after it's chilled a while and the flavors mix.

I was a little skeptical of what this would taste like when my mother made it but it was perfect for a picnic at the beach!! Even my 16 month old daughter who doesn't drink anything other than milk and water liked it!

I HATE CUCUMBERS! I won't even eat a salad where they have once been (even picked out the flavor never leaves) But I do like pickels so I planted four cucumber plants in my garden. By harvest I was giving cucumbers away by the five gallon bucket full so I had to find something else to do with them. I was going to have a party so I looked up cucumber recipes to see if I could offload smoe that way. I made the lemonade and tried a sip. I told my husband it was different from anything I had ever tried and proceeded to continue preps for the party. I was surprised when I picked up my glass to discover in the process of preping I had drunk it all and now I love it. BTW it was a hit at the party too. Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

Interesting drink.  I was looking for a way to use up some cucumbers and found this one in my recipe box.  It has an interesting taste - not bad - just different.  It is most definitely worth trying and it only uses 3 ingredients.  Thanks Lori for sharing your recipe.

So refreshing on a hot summer day. Used 1/2 of a 1 litter bottle of lemon sparking water and 1/2 of a 1 litter bottle of lime sparkling water. Added 1/2 cup of regular water to make the 2 quarts. Then I let it sit in the  for a couple of hours before serving.  The cucumber flavoring came through nicely.

I made this Cucumber Lemonade for a small party of 12 people and all but one raved over it.  This was so refreshing and the cucumber adds a special surprise flavor.  I will make this again and again.  Thank you for submitting this recipe.

This was super easy and very refreshing.  Instead of the usual lemon-lime soda, I added lightly flavored club soda (lime).  Therefore, there was no additional sugar, and the flavors are more subtle allowing the cucumber to come through.  I also muddled the cucumber slices a bit in the bottom of the pitcher before adding the liquids because other people mentioned the cucumber flavor was too light.  I had a big enough cucumber to use about a quarter of it for garnish slices in the glasses, and I sliced up half a lemon for garnish as well.  
It was a hit... everyone was leery of it when I first told them what I was making, but in the end all but one guest was pleasantly suprised by how good it was.  I was asked for the recipe by two different people who were the biggest fans.  Delish!

My wife and I have 5 kids and needed a larger recipe!  I am an occasional cucumber eater; I like it every so often on a salad, so I thought I'd try this. I used the juice of 8 lemons, pureed the cucumber and strained the juice through a paper towel.  Used two cups of sugar and the juices in a gallon pitcher, plus enough water to fill the pitcher.  I like it a lot, all my kids minus 2 loved it. Excellent on this 90+ degree day.  For a variation, use a packet of unsweetened grape koolaid instead of the cucumber juice.

I bought one of those large, plastic beverage containers with a spout. It was perfect for all ages. Adults could add the alcohol of their choice. I used half plain seltzer along with the lemon lime soda. Tasted lovely!

Wow was this good. First you taste the lemonade and soda then the taste of the cucumber comes through. Made it to go along with the zesty pulled pork sandwiches also a recipe here. Went perfect together. Thanks for sharing.

I love this drink! I made it just like the recipe says but I let the concentrate and fresh cucumber marinate a little longer and talk about a hit at my boxing party. I love this, I’ll make again and maybe add sparkling water and fresh lemon just for a fresh burst! Thank you so much!!

As some other people mentioned, it was a bit sweet.  Next time,  I think I will use less of the lemon-lime soda.  The cucumber really tasted delicious and refreshing in the lemonade!

I am hosting a bridal shower for my sister in a couple of weeks so I am sampling a few punch recipes beforehand to find something new and refreshing.  This one is just that!  Tastes great, could even add a little more lemon juice or little more lemonade concentrate to give it a little more zip if you wanted, but it's perfect just the way it is too!  Or add some Vodka to make it an adult drink - could be dangerous!  LOL
