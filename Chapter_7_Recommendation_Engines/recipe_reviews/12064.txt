We really enjoyed this one. I used sweet grape tomatoes, cut in halves, instead of the plum tomatoes (for a sweeter taste) and used Vadilia onion dressing instead of Italian.  The feta cheese is a nice touch and my whole family loved it. A nice, sweet tasting pasta salad.  Thanks Spaggie!

Very nice!

I marinated my chicken for about an hour and then grilled it.  I also finely minced about 1/4 cup of sweet onion and about half of a sweet red pepper.  I also tossed in a few sliced baby portobellos I had left over, plus a couple of extra splashed of dressing  for the added veggie volume.

I thought this was delicious. I also used a little fresh squeezed lemon on the chicken, and it gave it a little more flavor. Very good!

Thank goodness for the Italian dressing, or this salad wouldn't have had much taste.  I do agree -- the feta cheese was a nice touch.  And it is a good, quick recipe for those hot summer nights.  But next time I may season the chicken strips differently (maybe with more kick, like cajun spices?).

I tried something a little different with this. I am on a low-fat diet, so I used 2 tablespoons of Italian Pesto salad dressing(instead of the feta cheese) and then 1/4 cup of fat-free Italian dressing. I also added garlic powder, red pepper flakes, black pepper and basil to the pasta. The recipe tasted great even without the feta and parmesan cheese.

Great easy recipe.  Next time I will cook my chicken in the Italian dressing, rather than mixing it into the pasta.

Great for a quick, summer pasta salad dinner or lunch. This recipe would be good for a picnic also.

Very good! I had leftover grilled chicken so I just shredded that to use. I added fresh basil and plenty of fresh cracked black pepper. Hubby loved this. Thanks :)

i used grape tomatoes instead of plum and i added in some veggies that had to be used up ( cucumber, onion and red pepper ) i used a creamy italian dressing from this site to dress it.. i did scale it back some so that it would feed us a simple lunch. i did not use the full 4 oz of feta cheese since its really expensive i just crumbled a good amount over the top ( maybe 2 oz) i used 1/2 bag rotini pasta and 1 large chicken breast. very good lunch with crackers. easily stretchable with extra vegetables since chicken breast is pricey at the moment and i dont think canned would give the same result. excellent.

This was very good, I marinated the chicken for a day before in a tomato basil sauce and cooked it on the George Foreman. Next time I make this I'll add olives and extra feta.

This was pretty good for something quick, but I think it would be better refrigerated for a while. I had to double the amount of dressing because it seemed too dry.

Used medium size pasta shells, added spices salt, pepper, garlic powder, Nature’s Seasoning left off the lemon pepper. Grilled sliced fresh garlic with green bell peppers. I also added sliced red onion and chopped cilantro. I did not use the Italian salad dressing, but tossed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar. I didn’t have enough balsamic so splashed in some rice vinegar. Brought it to a party, demolished!

I made Italian dressing using my Pampered Chef dressing bottle, reduced fat feta cheese, & ziti because I didn't have rotini.  I enjoyed the simplicity of this pasta salad, but I believe it would be more appealing with more fresh vegetables.  I ate it for lunch today, & I plan to get some fresh broccoli, carrots, & celery to crunch it up a little.

I liked this pasta salad a lot!  I pretty much followed the recipe, but used a little more tomatoes and a little less pasta.  It was quick, easy, and delicious!  I had it warm today but look forward to trying it cold tomorrow for lunch!

Easy lunch recipe.  Added 1/2 purple onion and balsamic vinegar.
