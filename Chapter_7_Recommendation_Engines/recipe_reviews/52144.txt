** VERY IMPORTANT NOTE ** I took a look at this recipe, and was really surprised at all the trouble people are having with it. Instead of spreading all over the place, these cookies should be rather cake-like, and they shouldn't spread much at all. I then looked at the recipe, and realized there's a typo - YOU NEED TO USE 2 1/4 CUPS OF WHITE WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR, NOT 1 CUP!! I have no idea how this typo crept in - I can't imagine that I would have submitted it that way, but who knows? Maybe I did. I'll try to get the site to fix it. Thanks!

Thank you thank you thank you!  These cookies are beyond belief they are so good!  Because of dietary restrictions related to my son's asthma we do not use dairy or sugar in our house and these cookies were an amazing start towards a dessert we can all enjoy.  To make them work for us I omitted the butter and dry milk, replacing them with a combination of 2 cups of milled flax seed  and a half a cup of soy milk.  I also replaced the chocolate chips with unsweetened carob chips.  Obviously that is A LOT of changes from a traditional cookie recipe so I was shocked when I was able to bring them to a lunch play-date and the other kids actually ate them!  Thank-you, it means so much to my son to be able to share with other kids.  They are already on high request at our house and I think that we will be making them to have on hand.

Let me preface this review by saying that my family is switching over to an all whole foods diet - no white flour, sugar, rice, potatoes, high fructose corn syrup or hydrogenated fats.  By and large, it's a fairly easy transition, but a good cookie -- that's hard to find!
These have excellent flavor, and are as easy to make as regular chocolate chip cookies.  The batter consistency is considerably softer than traditional choc chip batter, and has a wicked aftertaste - don't worry, it doesn't come through in the cookie!  They have a different but not bad texture that is halfway between a cookie and a muffin top.  We've taken to calling them muffkies.  These are not going to satisfy any cravings for chewy, dense, Mrs. Fields style cookies; but they are a nice sweet treat for kiddos if you're trying to amp up the nutrition.  I probably won't make these again for a while -- I'm going to try experiments with raw sugars and crystalline fructose to get a "cookier" cookie.

Ok my kids and myself all say these are the best cookies we've ever had! I combined whole wheat flour and organic white flour to make my own whole white wheat. I used some walnuts since I was out of pecans. I used regular skim milk, not powdered. I don't keep powdered milk here. I also added some wheat germ, and some flax seed. Truly they were chewy, sweet, but not too sweet, and really hit the spot. I woke up excited each day to eat some!

Good, for what they are. Cakey, not the texture of a cookie. Substitutions: I used Agave Nectar instead of honey, 100% whole wheat flour instead of whole white wheat, margarine not butter, and 1/4 c. almond milk instead of powdered milk. This way they are not dairy and lower glycemic. Def satisfies a cookie craving.

I need to try these again b/c my first try didn't seem to turn out right.  They are tasty and cakey like some of the other reviewers have said, but something still seems off.

My two year old loves them, as do I. I can't resist adding a little oatmeal to chocolate chip cookies, but otherwise I followed the recipe.   Like other reviewers said, the first sheet turned out a bit more like muffins than cookies. For the second sheet I added some liquid milk to the recipe and then really tried not to over-bake them (I tried to err on the side of under-baking since they bake a little bit even after they're out of the oven) and then they turned out more like cookies. I am staying away from refined sugar so I will make these again when I'm craving a good, substantial cookie!

These are little more cake-like than most cookies, but I was definitely surprised by how good this was. Everyone who tried it loved it, too! I changed it by using liquid milk, omitting the pecans, spreading it in a cake pan, and baking it for 12 minutes, and it was great!

Excellent recipe for whole wheat flour!  I subbed skim milk (liquid) and Walnuts for Pecans and added 3/4 C ground Flax Seed meal for added texture and good stuff and they came out great!  My 4 year old who hates "mom's healthy cookies" loved them!  Thanks for sharing!!

first, they came out flat like flapjacks so added some oatmeal...these cookies were not that sweet, the sweetness primarily came when you bit into the chocolate chip. I gave some to family member and they enjoyed because it wasn't too sweet.

My husband and I try to stay away from refined sugar, sticking mostly to honey and maple syrup as sweeteners.  It works just fine, but delicious baked goods can be a trick to make.  This recipe is great!  I changed a couple things to make it work for us and they turned out delicious.  Instead of powdered milk, I used full fat yogurt, and to keep from getting that hardcore honey taste, I used 1/3 c. honey and 1/3 c. maple syrup instead of 2/3 c. honey.  I also added just a pinch or so of baking powder to combat the acidity of the honey.  Then I spread the batter into a pan and baked it for 12 minutes as bars, which made it nice and easy.  GREAT recipe!

Really GOOD!  I altered the recipe a bit, but I'm sure that I would have loved the original too.  I used about 3/4 cup of Land "O Lakes light butter, substituted agave nectar for the honey, and used 1% milk instead of powdered.  Oh, and I used egg substitute instead of whole eggs.  I will be making this again!  Thanks so much for the recipe!!

I gave it 4 stars because I did make a lot of adjustments to make the kind of cookies I wanted (not because I didn't think these looked good, I was just wanting to make something like a healthier version of the cookies my mother makes).  I didn't use nuts or powdered milk, and I replaced half of the butter with applesauce.  I also added 1/3 cup brown sugar, 2 cups of ground oats, 1/2 cup flaxmeal, and 1/2 cup dried cranberries.  They're more cakey than and not as sweet as the usual cookies, but that's to be expected.  Someday when I'm not baking these cookies for friends who are expecting the family recipe, I will try the recipe as it appears here.

Thank you!!  I was looking for a healthier alternative to the regular desserts filled with sugar, butter, and white flour.  I have found it.  I substituted the butter with Sunsweet Lighter Bake and used whole wheat flour as that was what I had.  Yummy.  Thank you so much for sharing!!

I can't eat processed sugar so this was a good cookie recipe to satisfy my craving for a cookie. It is cake-like and that worked good for me! I chopped up an Organic chocolate bar so there wasn't any processed sugar from the chocolate either.

I thought that they were a little dry the first time, but the whole family loved them! My fiance's brother said they tasted like sun smiles! We made them again and changed some things to make them a little less dry and lofty:

REPLACE FLOUR WITH 1 1/2 C. WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR + 1 1/4 C. GRANOLA, AND DO SLIGHTLY FEWER CHOC. CHIPS 
Also put the eggs in at room temperature.

They come out more like a classic cookie and taste even better because they are easier to get through, whereas the originals kind of stick to your mouth.

Very soft cakish sort of cookie! However, to me it is a bit on the sweet side. I think the next time I make them I will cut down on the amount of honey. I think my Sunday School class is gona' love 'em!

Sorry, but these proportions must be wrong...all runny and not really a good taste.  I think there should probably be more flour.  Please repost if you can figure out the problem.  Would like to find a good recipe with honey, butter, and whole wheat flour.

So-so cookies. first batch was really cakey and after a couple of days really dry. Second batch I flattened and undercooked a little and they were better. Mild sweet taste that was not an overwhelming sugary taste like most cookies. My kids liked them, my husband didn't. For being healthier than most cookies, not bad, but I have tasted better. These would probably be better with a little peanut butter and oats added

Thank you so much for this recipe! They are so yummy and soft! I did not have powdered milk so I used 2% milk and I did not add pecans. I am trying to stay away from white sugar...will make these again and again!

We used a little more flour than this recipe called for but the cookies taste great! Good recipe.

I liked these better than the No Cholesterol Chocolate Chip ones.  These had a good puffy pillowy cake like texture.

I made these with Bob's Red Mill whole wheat bread flour, organic vegan  mini chocolate chips, and 1 T. cream (in lieu of powdered milk, which I never have).  I also used about 3/4 tsp. of salt since I ran out.  Next time, I will use the entire teaspoon of salt (because these cookies NEED it) as well as another tablespoon of cream (possibly even subbing almond milk or half and half).

They taste good.  I don't like them near as much as my old family chocolate chip cookie recipe, BUT since we are no longer eating white sugar (or brown sugar, or white flour, etc.) these certainly do make a tasty replacement!  They are PLENTY sweet enough, and they have a soft cake-like texture.

Great Recipe!! Easy to make and bake, and the kids loved that the cookies were soft and chewy. This will become a staple in our house.

I like the whole wheat option. Very soft texture. Very salty. Seems to have twice as much salt than standard cookie recipe.The flavor and texture improved when eaten cold so I kept them in the fridge.

Taste great for being a more healthy cookie, but cookies fall apart easily after baked.

Excellent cookies - surprisingly easy to make and very good.  My only issue was with cooking time - I had to bake them 13 to 15 minutes to get them firm enough to remove from the cookie sheet, but other than that I had no problems with the corrected recipe.  They turned out medium-dark brown, but stayed soft and chewy.

Excellent cookie.  I used 2 cups of regular whole wheat flour and 1 tablespoon of vanilla.

I baked it as a bar cookie. Maybe I did something wrong, but my high hopes were definately dashed on this one.

I had high hopes for this recipe as it called for honey and whole wheat flour instead of refined white.  The batter was a light consistency but held its shape until placed in the oven.  Therefore, once it began baking it spread out considerably and actually made a complete mess in my oven.  It would probably work well if it was cooked in a cake pan and not on cookie sheets, and just cut it afterwards as bars.

An excellent cookie without refined sugar or white flour!  My family loved them!  I didn't have pecans so I substituted dried cranberries and they went very nicely with the chocolate chips!
