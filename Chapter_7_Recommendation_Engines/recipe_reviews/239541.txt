Made the recipe according to the directions with the addition of green onion when forming the cakes for color and I made 6 smaller cakes instead of 4.  Served with the Louisiana Remoulade from this site because my husband likes heat.  As always, Chef John's recipes are a guaranteed winner!  My nine and seven year old children asked for seconds.  And just a note...if you didn't make the recipe according to the directions, don't give it less then 5 stars  because you didn't make this recipe, you made your own, which wasn't as good...

Went fishing at Prince Willems Sound near Valdez for Silvers. We returned home with about 50 lbs. of salmon fillet. For a week we had salmon every which way we could think of. I’m not a fan of fish or crab cakes . . . but, what the heck I tried it. I made this recipe “Chef John's Fresh Salmon Cakes”. Now I’m a big fan of salmon cakes . . . I didn’t alter the recipe except I added two tablespoon of Huy Fong Vietnamese Chili Garlic Sauce for a little kick. This is a keeper.

So delicious! I added an egg and used seasoned pepperidge farms thanksgiving type breadcrumbs instead. It was so so good. Better than any Salmon cakes I've ever had or made myself. This recipe is definitely a winner! Love it!

Turned out great!  This was my first time making it.  My husband does not like onion, red bell pepper or capers so I omitted those and I added some red pepper flakes, and a bit of horseradish and extra cayenne pepper.  I also used my Quisinart to chop up the salmon and mix the ingredients together.  Will make this again.  Thanks.

4-16-16:   I wanted to try this recipe so badly that I used the packaged boneless, skinless salmon which is what I had on hand.  I did add the cloves of garlic in with the onion mixture and I used a lemon pepper seasoning in place of the Old Bay....didn't add any additional salt.  It was beyond perfect!  This has to be the best tasting salmon patties ever!!!  Thanks Chef John!  Even though I didn't use the fresh wild caught salmon, it was still delicious.

I followed the recipe exactly as written (because how can you review a recipe if you've made changes), and we really liked the results.  I made these one day and we ate them, cold,  for lunch the next day.  These will be made again however I plan to add about a tblsp more mayo and will try baking instead of frying.  Also didn't have time to make and then let the remoulade sit, so I will plan better and next time and add this to the cakes. Will add a pic next time too.

Made using onion powder and garlic powder because I thought I had both onion and garlic in the house but did not. I omitted cayenne pepper, seafood seasoning, and mustard and used seasoned breadcrumb. It tasted good to me and was my first time having salmon or any type of fish cake

I made these last night for supper - and I can honestly say that these are the best fish cakes I've ever eaten. No changes made to the recipe,  PERFECT as they are. There where no leftovers.

Love this recipe! I wanted to serve stuffed peppers but I do not eat meat so I search for chef John’s salmon patties and found this recipe. I stuffed  yellow peppers and grilled on my gas grill  on indirect heat for 15 to 18 minutes. I did not make the Sauce but that would be a nice complement   
So with leftovers,  I chopped the 1/4 stuffed pepper and heated it up in the microwave. I cooked and over medium egg and placed it on top. It was fabulous !!!   Bon appétit !

Best ever Salmon Cakes.  Made them tonight.  Threw away all the other recipes.  Will only use this one from now on.  Remember:  put your patties in the freezer at least 15 minutes before cooking and they will stay together.

These were great. I followed the recipe but made them into small cakes and served them as an appetizer with spicy mayo and cucumber. It yielded around 10. Thanks, Chef John!

The only change I made was to cook the salmon patties in an air fryer than in a skillet.

Oh my gosh....this is the BEST EVER salmon cakes.  And I do not like Salmon!! My boyfriend does so I made them for him but I loved them!  The only thing I did was use 2 green scallions instead of regular onions and a touch more cayenne pepper for a heat and a touch more old bay seasoning.  I also used fresh Sockeye salmon. Fried them in olive oil with a touch of butter about 3 minutes on each side.  Served with lemon.  DIVINE!!!!

Followed the recipe without making any changes.  Turned out amazingly.  I made a lemon-basil aioli and served them with kale and couscous.  Will definitely make these again.

I  did use fresh COOKED salmon and therefore had to add a bit more mayonnaise.  Other than that followed the recipe and my husband and I really enjoyed this. Served it with the rumolade recipe.

I'm an advanced home cook/baker these are the best Salmon Cakes I've ever tasted. I can't keep my head out of the refrigerator. I took all wet ingredients including the eggs and processed them til they were pureed well. Then processed the Salmon put the recipe together let it sit couple hours then fried them. I didn't change quantity or ingredients. They stand on their own not sauce necessary.

Chef John does it once again.  This is an amazing salmon cake and quite easily put together. Made it exactly (that's why I'm rating this recipe) as stated by Chef John and it was loved by all.  They were so good that you do not need any sauce to accompany these cakes. Only mistake I made...I should've made more. Underestimated the feeding frenzy that would ensue. Thank you Chef John...again.

Solid recipe!  Had no capers but did have artichoke hearts on which I put a fine dice so the pieces were caper size.  Served the cakes with warm pineapple mango salsa. Added a little extra heat in both the cakes and the salsa.  On the salsa the recipe calls for an onion and garlic saute and moving the onions, garlic and jalapeno to the side of the pan and putting the mango and pineapple in the pan to caramelize.  Just because you have garlic in the pan I would take the saute out just to be sure the garlic doesn't go brown and get bitter!

I used fresh farmed salmon and added 2 tablespoons of pickled hot banana peppers (chopped) to the mix, but stayed with the recipe otherwise.  Quite delicious!

Made this as a going-away dinner for my brother (back when Mom was still around, it was her go-to meal for him whenever he visited). 

Lt is top notch, Chef John... top notch! :)

Followed the main recipe to the letter... Roasted some frozen broccoli for the side... all in all, it is a keeper!

This is a great recipe and turns out great even when adapted.  I make these at least twice a month - even my 2yr old loves them.  I leave out the onion and red pepper (7yr old would not eat them otherwise!) - and they're still yummy!

I don't particularly care for fish but needed to add it to my regular fare. Not particularly appealing to me but thankfully recipes like this make it so much easier. I did tweak, skipped the Capers, added fresh minced ginger, used crushed red pepper instead of Cayenne and loved the results. Have already made it twice since and know it will become a regular go to. Thanks for sharing!

Made some changes.
1. The supermarket was closing and the only remaining fresh salmon was frozen. This package of Honey Smoked Salmon from the Honey Smoked Fish Co. (marked down from $21.99/lb. to $9.97/lb) caught my eye. So I said what the heck. I must have OCD, because these salmon cakes were calling me.

I'm allergic to (just don't like) mayonnaise, so I substituted 2 organic eggs and didn't add any salt. 

Everything else was as suggested by the recipe. 

When I first tasted them last night, I didn't know whether I liked them or not. They were ok, but nothing to write home to mom about. My wife said they were very good, though because of her salt sensitivity would only taste it along with her fresh made black eye pea soup.

But, today (next day)... These things are the BOMB... I am definitely going to do this again.

This recipe is amazing.  Unbelievable flavor. I did use a small food processor to help get the celery and bell pepper minced. I think it may of helped keeping  them together when frying them. Also we made a New Orleans Remoulade for topping which was a great complement.

1st time making salmon cakes with fresh salmon and will not be the last.  I normally do not leave reviews, but this recipe is delicous and followed exactly, needs no egg or additional ingredients.  After chilling - even if you do not have a full hour, the panko absorbs the moisture of the salmon and holds the cakes together beautifully.  Also delicious the following day cold.  Thanks Chef John!

Just added some fresh dill because I had it on hand. Wonderful recipe!
For those who said they fell apart, that is why the recipe calls for resting the mixture for 1-2 hours after combining. The panko, given enough time, will absorb the liquid in the mixture and bind nicely. Also, don't mess with the cakes once they are in the pan. Turn them once only.

These were fantastic!  I didn't have the 1-2 hours to chill and let firm so I added one egg.  It seemed to help pretty well and the patties held together.  Will definitely make again!

WOW! These were so good, definitely adding to a regular rotation! Not usually a fan of salmon, they don't have a heavy fishy flavor. Moist and held together nicely. I did sub out coconut oil for the last step of frying the patties (didn't have enough olive oil). Thanks Chef for a great recipe!!

These were delicious.  I used our own canned spring salmon and had the ingredients adjusted for serving 3.   It made 4 patties and I added an egg.   A repeat for sure!

Used canned instead of fresh because I’m poor. I love love love this recipe! My only other modification was that I used roasted red peppers in a jar instead of fresh because I’m extra. My guests and significant other love these as well.

This is an excellent recipe that can be tweaked to your tastes. The Old Bay is a nice touch and the pinch is all you need. I left out the cayenne, but added a little dill. I don't use olive oil to fry anything, even at lower temps. The flavor is wasted and the smoking temperature is low. I used vegetable oil. I also had to add more than the recommended amount of bread crumbs since it was too wet. I'll make these again!

I finally made an account for allrecipes because of this recipe. 
I followed directions except for adding some small hot peppers chopped and mixed in. I went back and forth about whether or not to add a beaten egg. I did. 
This recipe is excellent ! Thank you Chef John.

We have a share in Sitka Salmon Shares and receive frozen salmon burger.  This is the perfect recipe to use with our salmon burger.  I used a little more peppers and a few more bread crumbs--exact measurements are not that important.  I had no problems getting the cakes to stick together.  They were delicious!  I will make them the next time we get a package of salmon burger.

Made these as written except used only about 1/2lb salmon and no capers cause I’m not a fan. Chopped some of the salmon fine, some medium, some course. The fine mushed up while mixing and seemed to act as a binder. The patties turned out fantastic! Light in flavor and texture while still appearing as flaky fish in the patty thanks to the course chopped. Served them on brioche buns and my wife said make these anytime. Even the two yr old seemed to enjoy and asked for more (with ketchup :) ). Awesome simple recipe Chef!

I'll never use canned salmon again!  These salmon cakes were the best.  Made them for dinner last night and my husband loved them. FYI, when buying fresh salmon make sure to get it without the skin.

Husband said ‘THAT was really something special!’  I used fresh salmon, wasn’t crazy about that part of the process (lol) May try with canned next time BUT these were just truly soooo delicious maybe I shouldn’t ‘mess’ with perfection!!

Made it as specified.  It is amazingly delicious.  Everyone liked it, even those in the family that don't love salmon.  I accidentally charred a few of the cakes and everyone agreed that it tasted better that way.  So a little char won't hurt!  Thanks Chef John!

I used fresh salmon with this delicious recipe.  Very easy, takes very little time to prepare.  Cook to your liking; we like a bit of crispness on the outside so higher heat, shorter time.  Served with a remoulade sauce.  Convince your guests (and family) to come to the table immediately; this looses something if not hot.

I made this once before and it was a big hit. The recipe called for an away at this time we’re going to add an egg to see if it’ll bind it better. We’ve also tried chef John’s meatballs so his recipes are pretty  good. Thank you

Made these exactly as the recipe states. Served with Chef John’s remoulade 2.0. Never expected these to be that good. They were absolutely delicious. They would be perfect to introduce a person to salmon. Anther great dish by Chef John.

This was great! I had two 4 oz. salmon packets defrosted so I halved the recipe. The only ingredient I didn’t include was red pepper (ran out of it), but it didn’t negatively impact the flavor. I was hesitant about the capers since I’m not a fan of them but decided to include them. I’m sure glad I did! They gave it a nice flavor. Served it on a bed of spring mix with a lemony dressing. Will definitely make again

Awesome recipe Chef! Followed as directed without additions, packed very well and handled very carefully. Made a couple of patties and the remainder made logs to either use in dog buns or cut in half for street tacos. Only 1 log broke in half, I may try adding an egg as well next round.

I made these with lake salmon, didn't have garlic or celery so I used garlic salt and celery salt. I used seasoned Italian bread crumbs also. 
The best I've had. Can't wait to try them with exact ingredients.

We didn't care to much for this recipe. I used canned salmon instead of fresh and it came out tasting just like tuna fish. An that's a lot of work, to end up with that flavor. I do not recommend doing that. I will not be making this again, though I do like some of his other recipes.

I cannot eat eggs or wheat gluten, so I followed this recipe and substituted panko for GF panko and the mayo for Vegan Mayo. They were delicous. They were very fragile, but I can work with that. Good starting point. I make a similar cake with crab.

My neighbor brought me a year old frozen salmon fillet, it had freezer burn on it and looked really bad.  I used Chef John's receipt and it was amazing how it turned out.  I have been making this salmon for about 3 years now and I am always pleased with the results.  Thanks Chef John!

OMG these were absolutely out of this world! I served them to company and got rave reviews. I have to admit because I was chopping the salmon into pieces, I bought leftover cuts of salmon that had been packaged together for sale in my grocery store. It was hugely discounted because they weren't perfect pieces of fish, but who cares???!! Win, win! Made some homemade tarter sauce and served with strawberry spinach salad and some beautiful saffron rice.

These are delicious! I wasn’t expecting to enjoy them as much as I did! Very easy to make. My boyfriend likes things spicy so I added a touch of hot sauce but they would’ve been just as great without it!

We loved these. I covered each patty in panko crumbs before cooking on the George Foreman for about 4 or 5 minutes. Served with tartar Sauce,  coleslaw, and quinoa

Made this again but substituted mushrooms for celery as that's what i had on hand. delish. made a third time and put an egg in too

I left out the capers on the first batch. These are excellent for leftover poached salmon. I used eggs to hold together better. Pairs well with dill mustard, dill pickles, and Stone IPA!

This was amazing!!! Love Chef John's recipes anyway, but this one was outstanding. Doubled it and the only change was omitting the celery because I thought I had some and didn't. So I increased the onion and pepper a bit. Served to my girlfriends during one of our gatherings and rave reviews all around (from my husband too!!). Mine was well refrigerated before making patties and cooking so I don't know if that helped them stay together or not - but they didn't fall apart in the least. Quick cooking and SO much flavor - love, love, love

I have made the recipe three or four times and it is an amazing hit each time. I follow the recipe  by the letter so far Chef John has never disappointed me. I use fresh salmon but can’t see my way to consider canned salmon it would so wrong. The capers add an interesting flavor and I add a few more than recommended. Plus an extra dusting of Panko is a good idea. These  “patty cakes “ fry up great in my mom stick pan with a nice sear so yummy! Enjoy!!

I have made this recipe many times and love it!  It is my to go to recipe for salmon cakes. You can make it just as Chef John as posted or add a few tweaks depending on what you have on hand. I recently added some fresh lemon zest & dill to the salmon while the pepper/onion/celery mix cooked, a nice fresh addition. But honestly, just the way Chef John has it posted is the BEST!

They were really good because there were no bread crumbs for filler.  I served them with a sauce of mayo, mustard, lemon juice, paprika and a pinch of cayenne. Yummy!

We love Chef John’s salmon cakes. These are a bit time-consuming from beginning to end but chilling the salmon cakes before frying them help keep the cakes intact. Followed the recipes to a t. My salmon-loving Family gobbles them up every time. Thank you, Chef John. Everything you post turn out so delicious.

Oh my goodness, this is a delicious recipe! I just made a tester salmon patty cake while the rest of the salmon refrigerates for me to cook them later. I wanted to be sure these were seasoned well enough. They are! The change I made was using a green bell pepper instead of red because I needed to use it up and I don't have red. Also, for those wondering how much salt to use, I looked up how much salt should be used per lb of fish and it says 1tsp. That helped me adjust the salt to how much salmon I had (I had a little less than a pound, which is less than what is stated in the recipe).  I mixed half of a beaten egg into the salmon mixture based on other's reviews. I didn't want to risk it falling apart even though Chef John's did not. Other than that I did the recipe as stated and it is outstanding. I am going  to serve it over some very lightly buttered egg noodles with a bit of gourmet aioli I found at a market (instead of the remoulade he suggests only because I don't have time to make it). Thank you Chef John!!! This would be a great small appetizer (if you make little patties) or a great starter entree for a dinner party.

If I could give these 10 stars, I would! I swear, Chef John’s recipes are amazing, and these salmon cakes are no exception! I served them with Chef John’s remoulade recipe that he mentions in the video (I also gave the remoulade recipe 5 stars).

These salmon cakes taste great on their own, but PLEASE try serving them with the remoulade! The flavours in these cakes are amazing. I didn’t think you could buy Old Bay seasoning here in Canada, but believe it or not, I found it at Wal-Mart (of all places).

My partner and I both said these are better than any seafood cakes we’ve had at ANY restaurant...ever!!!

Keep ‘em coming Chef John!!!

Followed recipe- made four and they held together beautifully. I used less Panko and mayo then chef John calls for but with refrigeration time they hold together beautifully. I use an electric griddle to cook all my crab cod or now salmon cakes in. Get hot and put cake on. Patiently wait for it to crisp on one side then turn and repeat. No butter or oil needed. I probably did not use enough old bay or cayenne and will up that next time. Aldo added some horseradish and some ginger. Next time I think upping those four ingredients will make them 5 stars worthy. Chef John says it is a versatile recipe and it is- always fridge your cake and u can use less mayo and Panko, and he does use far less then most in this recipe -which I love since you want to taste the meat not breeding!

I liked the ingredients so I used this as a base to make this with 2 cans of tuna. Switched the servings to 2 and followed the recipe. Added a bit more crumbs and 1 egg. I also used green onions, and a generous shake of Old Bay seasoning. As suggested in another review I put them in the freezer for 15 min. Fried in olive oil with just a little sesame oil added.  Do not touch for 5 minutes , flip gently and then 5 more minutes. Was surprised that they stayed together  Served with tarter sauce and lemon wedges.

I love salmon and enjoy all sorts of different preparations and recipes but, I've never made salmon cakes.  These are to die for!  I followed the recipe to a tee except for one thing.   I hate it when people rate a recipe and change the ingredients.  But, the only red peppers I had on hand were the ones that I had roasted two days prior.  They were influenced by a lot of garlic, fresh basil, and olive oil.   These are very company worthy and I will make again and again for company or just for me.  Thanks for a great recipe!  Debbie

My husband was always saying he wanted salmon patties but I didn't really care for them as I've only had the ones made from canned salmon. But I love fresh salmon so through the magic of the internet, I found this recipe. I made them tonight and we both loved them. Score!!!

I could taste the capers.  Really good.  Served over a bed of sliced/chopped spinach and romane.

Loved it! Great, simple recipe where the star was the fish and very little filler. Instead of salmon I used freshly smoked trout the hubby caught. I  omitted the capers (as we don't care for them) and added 1 tsp lemon juice for some acidity. Served with hollandaise sauce and they were great.

Great to find a recipe that uses fresh salmon. Most are for canned, which are good as well. But the fresh taste is enhanced with this recipe. Very good. Wouldn't change a thing.

Delicious and can't wait to make these Salmon Cakes again. Only change - left out the cayenne pepper, just went with the Old Bay seasoning, and thought this was enough kick for us. Also, I broiled the salmon cakes instead of frying - personal preference. We used left over cooked salmon that we had the night before. Note that if using left over salmon that has already been seasoned with salt, you will not need to add more salt when making the salmon cakes. I forgot this small, but important point and found my cakes were a little too salty (but even with that, still delicious!).

yummy. I used the leftover, already baked up pieces from the other nights dinner. Fried in coconut oil rather than oo - tasted great. I would add a little more capers, huz says not. made my patties small, like appetizer size, so they cooked up quickly. Also, as others suggested, I added an egg to help bind all together.

Delicious!!! I made them with Gluten free panko instead but still was very yummy. It does make a huge difference when you put it in the fridge for at least an hour or so. I will definitely be making these again.

I really loved this recipe! The only thing I did was use only 1 garlic clove and added a few tablespoons of minced fresh Italian parsley , some lemon zest and a squeeze if lemon juice. We get a lot of fresh Alaskan salmon from a neighbor and I am always looking for new ways to cook it. This is a keeper!

Perfect recipe to use  some thawed salmon filets.  I didn't add celery only because I didn't have it.  Wonderful flavor. Kids & hubby LOVED this recipe.  (My husband said they were so good, he thought I bought them at the grocery store)

We live in Alaska.  Hubby came home with 25 salmon.  We were looking for new recipes, we decided to try this one.  Awesome, fantastic, delicious!!!! We just added a lemon cream sauce on top.  Probably will make tomorrow for company.

Good for leftover fish as well..  I blended my leftover fish and added it to this recipe. I recommend  a bit more moisture if working with leftover fish.  Egg helps could also use a little milk to help bind if using leftover fish. I never know what to do with leftover fish this worked great.. Thanks

I have made this with Italian flavored gluten free bread crumbs and found them very tasty.  

We make them in a batch and freeze.  they make wonderful quick meals. The other way we make them is in fishing camp using the bits and trim from filleting a salmon.  There is a nice quantity of salmon that can be harvested from the skeleton and bellies to make the fresh salmon cakes.

These have become a new favorite way to eat salmon.

They were quite tasty, but tended to break apart  during cooking. I did also add an egg to bind it.
I will make them again but add a bit more panko and maybe  a few extra capers.

Really yummy.  I followed the directions and had no problem with the cakes staying together. I did add a little more capers for flavor because of the online reviews of being bland.  I loved the panko breadcrumbs on top of the cakes to crisp them up.

Loved this recipe. Made it exactly as written except did not have capers so I used a teaspoon or so of dill relish.  I cooked longer than called for probably 5-6 mins per side. Nice snd crispy on the outside. Will be making this again.

Easy to follow recipe. I followed the directions but didn't use all the exact measurements. I'm also adding egg to bind it. This is my first time so I'm hoping it comes out good. Smells good and I like all the ingredients so we'll see...

These were the best fish cakes I've ever had of any kind. I made no changes. Served them with dynamite sauce on the side. Excellent recipe!

A company meal. I love it with the fresh salmon. Could not have tasted any better. I served it with a mayo/yogurt/dill sauce. Yum.

These salmon cakes were amazing.  Didn't tell my husband what was in store for dinner because he's a recent convert to salmon, so I was afraid this recipe would be pushing the envelope, but they were a hit!  The capers made this dish.....don't try and sub this ingredient.  Used 3 small wild salmon fillets  and got 4 cakes that were perfect serving size, so we each had 2.  So mad there were not leftovers because a cold salmon cake would have been fabulous for lunch!

I had leftover fresh poached salmon in my refrigerator, and decided to make Chef John's Salmon Cakes for dinner.   I did not, however,  have any Capers, Old Bay Seasoning's or cayenne pepper on hand so I had to omit them.    Even with these three ingredients missing, these cakes were very moist and delicious.   When I have Capers, Old Bay Seasoning and cayenne pepper in my pantry, I will make these cakes again to compare the two.

First time I made this recipe I followed it exactly and we enjoyed them but had to add some hot sauce to give it a little more flavor.  I'm making them again tonight and adding more cayenne and seafood seasoning per our tastes.  Great alternative way to prepare salmon!
