I LOVE this cake! My son is allergic to eggs. I needed a cake that would taste good and hold up well for shaped birthday cakes. This one is perfect! I have used this recipe to make cakes shaped like a whale, dragon, and komodo dragon, among other things. It tastes great by itself or with frosting. It is easy to cut into layers. It IS a little more dense than what you might be expecting. It reminds me of a pound cake. Nothing wrong with that!! A good eggless cake recipe is hard to come by. I almost wept the first time I used this one. LOL

I tried this recipe and it was terrible! I should have realized, any cake with no eggs has to come out dry and heavy.

this cake turned out wonderfully! I was a bit hesitant about the batter as it was so thick but it turned out to be a wonderfully light, fluffy perfect cake! I did the strawberries and it was just great! Thank you so much for this recipe I'll make it again and again!

The batter didn't turn out right, ended up having to add more milk. After done baking it tasted like a bad sugar cookie.

Everytime I make this it's gone in no time!  I am making it again for a party and have to make a separate one to keep!  Strawberries are a must!  Delicious and easy!

I am rating this 4 out of 5 right now, but if my son actually eats it - it will get 5! I have tried several eggless cake recipes, and they are all okay - not great - unless you top it with an inch of frosting. I ate one of these cupcakes without frosting - and it was delicious! Now, I just need to get my leery son, who thinks all cupcakes taste like cardboard to try it!!! So excited!

Cake was dense like a pound cake, flavor was good.  All that I shared with said they were yummy!  Topped cupcakes with a Chocolate buttercream frosting and a strawberry garnish,

I will try again as a double layer cake with strawberries in the center.

Tried this cake with a filling and frosting from other recipes (I had some white chocolate chips I needed to use up).  It is very unusual. The batter is very thick but it is supposed to be, DO NOT add more milk or it won't turn out at all.  The white chocolate is a challenge to deal with, make sure it doesn't cool too much or you will have white chocolate lumps in your batter.  It is a dense cake, somewhere between a pound cake and a quick bread, but the flavor is good. Not sure I would use it again, (I don't make a lot of cakes anymore since my kids are grown) but it is a good choice if you need to avoid eggs or want something different than your average cake.
