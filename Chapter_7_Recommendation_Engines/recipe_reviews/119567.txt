delicious- I cut it down to 1/2 for 2 of us and used 1 reg egg, because that is  what I had on hand, instead of substitute egg------------ its a nice easy and tasty change from pumpkin pie!

My son-in-law says this is one of his favorite pumpkin desserts of all time.  I baked this pudding in a casserole dish at the 425 degrees for 10 minutes and at 350 degrees for 50 minutes.

I used real pumpkin that was more watery than in the can, so I only used 1 C liquid (1/2 C cream and 1/2 C whole milk) and added an egg.  I baked them in greased muffin tins, and this recipe made 12 when filled to the top of each cup. Thanks for the nice recipe.

It was a great pudding but a little sweet.  Maybe next time I'll use 1/3 to 1/2 less sugar.  I also used Soy Cream instead of the milk and real pumpkin from a pie pumpkin and it turned out delicious. Thanks,
D

Wow! Fabulous. I cut recipe in half also, used 1 real egg, made evaporated milk (mixed 2/3 cup non-fat dry milk and 3/4 cup water), otherwise followed directions. Made in cupcake pans. Since I am gluten intolerant, it was wonderful to have pumpkin pie taste. Thank you, bless you!

I never give a review this low, but I was embarrassed to bring this to a friend's house for dessert! I followed the recipe exactly except added a walnut streusel topping...which was the only part of it that I liked! They were polite and ate it, but I definitely regret making this and won't be trying it again. I should have stuck with regular old pumpkin pie.
