This recipe was not only easy but a crowd HIT! I marinaded the chicken overnight with Lawry's Hawaiian Marinade. The chicken was so tender. The pineapple slices and provolone were great togther! SO tasty! A definite cook book add!

I used this as a base recipe and added my own touches. I pounded the boneless, skinless chicken breasts between two pieces of saran wrap to make them tender and less thick. I used my fav. teriyaki sauce to marinate and I also sauteed some sliced mushrooms then added some sauce to the mushrooms.  I grilled the chicken on wood chunk briquettes (the smoky flavor was amazing). I use swiss or provolone cheese and grill the pineapple per the recipe. I used plain mayo instead of thousand island. My sister suggested to use chipoltle mayo to add a little kick. I may try that next time.
Great recipe to add your own touches to!

These were really good but I did make some changes....I skipped on the tomatoes and lettuce (the sandwich is already juicy from the pineapple).  Also, I didn't have any onion rolls so instead I used sesame rolls and then added onion strings to the sandwich(I really recommend this addition).  Also, I'm not a fan of thousand island dressing so I used dijon mustard and instead of the provolone I used muenster jalapeno cheese!  I realize that this is a lot of changes but I just made it according to what I had in the refrigerator and my BF and I loved them!

I think that the 1000 Island dressing would have to be a personal taste - not one that appeals to me.  BUT I do recommend trying Swiss cheese with the chicken burger!  A local restaraunt here uses Swiss on their chicken/pineapple burger, and it is DELISH!  Something so good about the swiss and the pineapple together.  Trust me!!!  Go reg mayo though!

Not very good at all - I've had this type of sandwich in restaurants and loved it, but I didn't think the thousand island dressing went well with the marinade and pinapple. Needs something spicier...

This recipe was a hit.  Didn't use thousand island, used chipotle mayo like another user suggested.  Made my own marinade with pineapple juice, soy sauce, garlic and onion powder since I couldn't find commerial marinade.  Used the frozen breasts and marinaded them overnight.

I'd been looking for some time to duplicate a sandwich my husband and I first had while on vacation in Florida a few years ago. This is the taste we remember, we both love it. The Thousand Island dressing makes it great. We like using a soft bun. If you can't find Hawaiian marinade I've had to use a sweet and sour dressing for the marinade and it came out great also. As I make this again today I realize I didn't write previously that I pound the chicken to all one thickness so it cooks more evenly. Also I find with some chicken breasts they are just too big often I can make two sandwiches  out of one chicken breast.

This sandwich was very tasty.  A solid four in my opinion, but my husband's praise bumped it up to five!  The thousand island dressing nicely complements the sweet chicken and pineapple.

I was looking for a recipe that reminded me of a "Hawaiian" sandwich my kids loved in Belgium.  This came very close to hitting the mark; just made a few changes to make it just like what we ate there.  Thank you!!

We LOVED this recipe!  The first time, we forgot to pick up onion buns and make the 1000 island dressing, but it still turned out wonderful. The second time, everything was there and it was even better!

This was ok. I didn't really care for the sweetness from the pineapple, and the tastes didn't really go together.

I should have used smaller chicken breasts. It was good but very messy and hard to hold together. I think next time I'll use smaller chicken breasts and skip the lettuce and tomato. It was just too big to handle. I had a jalapeno lime marinate I used, which was good.

Just got back from spring break in Maui when I made this recipe... had enjoyed a similar sandwich at the 5 Palms in Kihei a few days earlier... and this sandwich was better!
The marinade is wonderful, used it on it's own for a chicken main dish

Good recipe. I made a few changes to mine. I used ciabatta rolls, fresh baby spinach and roasted tomatoes. (The roasted tomatoes are easy to make and make this sandwich really stand out!) Also recommend mayo or honey/dijon mustard instead of thousand island.

This was the first time cooking on the grill, and it came out great. The kids said I do a better job than daddy. hahahaha I made just as stated. It took a lil hunting to find the marinade, but I found it. I let it marinade for about 8 hours. The chicken was so juicy and full of flavor. This recipe is def. going into rotation at my house.

YUMMY! I used the thinner chicken breasts that Schwann's sells for these. Thick chicken breasts on any sandwich is just not for my family. Anyway, these were super easy and very very good. My family doesn't like Thousand Island, but used mayo, mustard, bbq, or a combo all of. I would suggest marinating for at least 6 hours.

This hit the spot!  I cooked the chicken and pineapple rings on the George Foreman grill and omitted the thousand island dressing.  Served it with Apple Cole Slaw.

I've had this recipe in my recipe box forever! A bad case of spring fever had this sandwich sounding irresistible so I decided to try it, finally. I'm glad I did. It was totally worth cleaning all the snow off of my outdoor grill and standing in the semi-dark in 20 degree weather to get the perfect flavor.  Only I skipped the tomatoes and added roasted red peppers instead. YUM!

The whole family approves of this one! Very easy. I did the whole thing on my George Foreman Grill. We will definitely be having this again. And just because of personal preference I think we will use the chipotle mayo next time instead of the Thousand Island dressing. But we made it as the recipe stated and it was very good!

Great recipe! My whole family loved it. I marinated it for about an hour, I think next time I will leave it overnight to add some more flavor. I used low-fat swiss and light thousand island and it is still great. I also recommend sticking with the onion rolls, I like the added flavor.

I forgot to marinade the chicken so it only ended up in the marinade for about 10 minutes.  It was still a tasty sandwich.  Will make again.

This was a fabulous recipe. My family is so   hard to please when it comes to cooking them a meal that I am often scared to try new things, but this recipe was worth the risk, everyone loved it and I won't change a thing the next time I make it.

I love pineapple on my pizza, so I knew I would like this recipe.  Simple yumminess!  I used a teriyaki sauce for the chicken....used cheddar cheese, and instead of the dressing, just mixed a tiny bit of the teriyaki in some mayo.  Definitely will make again :P

This was really good - really easy to prepare too! The thousand island dressing added to it so don't skip it. Next time I will eliminate the lettuce and tomato on mine because it sort of overtook the rest of the sandwich and maybe I'll put two rings and two slices of cheese on mine :)

I marinaded thin chicken breasts along with minced garlic, for about 4 hours, then on the grill.  I did not use the thousand island dressing.  I knew it was going to compliment each other at all.  After taking the chicken off the grill, I add baby swiss cheese slices (you should really try using the swiss) , and I also grilled the pineapple rings for a few minutes.  I serve with a long grain wild rice.  Tasty!  For a shortcut, you can cook the marinated  thin sliced chicken breasts in the skillet, and have an open faced sandwich (to cut out carbs)

Cooked this on my George Foreman grill, which I haven't used in forever. Chicken came out moist. Pineapple and Swiss cheese on top was a perfect, light touch. Used Walden Farms Amazin Mayo instead of Thousand Island dressing. Fun, different way to cook chicken!

Made this tonight with a few modifications (minus the cheese, plus onion slices, used Lowry's Hawaiian sauce, whole wheat buns, and thighs not breasts).  The first bite was a hit and I immediately declared that we'd be serving these at a summer BBQ for sure!  Thanks for the inspiration!

I love these burgers, they are addicting. I didnt have time to marinade the chicken, I just covered them in the hawaiian teriyaki sauce before cooking and basted them throughout. Still tasted great. Good with swiss cheese too. (ALSO, I used this recipe with garden burgers for my vegetarian friend and she LOVED them)!

This was so yummy. Light, but filling. I added some crushed red pepper in the marinade for a little kick and we're not a fan of onion buns, so a simple change in that and we had an awesome summer lunch.

Very good! A nice change for a summer day. Rather than traditional BBQ, to have the sweetness of this sandwhich. I made exactly as said (marinated overnight), wouldnt change a thing. Will make again for sure.

I couldn't exactly figure out what "hawaiian marinade" was so used the Yoshida sauce to marinate overnight the chicken breasts.  Was incredibly easy and yummy!
