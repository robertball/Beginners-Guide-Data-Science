This was good, but the spices weren't near close enough to gingerbread for me. I made this a recipe for one and I used fat free half-n-half instead of full fat and I used Cafe Verona brewed coffee. It's tasty but not quite there for me.

This is delicious! I am enjoying one of these now. All I had to use was Land O Lakes fat free creamer and I forgot to add whipped cream and it is still so rich and good that I will be skipping lunch. It's not a bad idea to strain out some of the spices so you don't get a big, spicy mouthful at the end.

My husband and I made this to sip while we decorated our Christmas tree.  We've decided to make it a tradition!  The molasses mixture can be kept on hand for visitors over the holidays.

Fabulous!  The only problem with this recipe is that my husband is now addicted to this stuff.  We usually skip the whipped cream (out of laziness) but I've made this once using cinnamon whipped cream with great results.  I also add some ground cloves directly to the molassas mixture instead of dusting it on top and sometimes I add a little ground nutmeg.  We've used ordinary milk a few times instead of half-and-half, but it's not quite as good that way -- the cream smooths out the flavours somehow.

Ok...but not as good as I thought it might be.  The spices made the drink a bit granulary.  And I put in much less mix in the drink.  Best to have at room tempeture when adding or it takes a long time to dissolve.  Decent, but not great.

Good! I didn't add the whipped cream but I am sure it would add to the richness of the overall product.

I can only drink coffee if it is flavored with something. I think this recipe has really good flavor, but it was a little too sweet and too rich, I could not drink the entire cup. I will try it again with a few adjustments.

This was really good but really rich! It's enough to knock you over...or at least fill you up so you don't want you next meal. I left out the whipped cream, and it was good enough without it.

Need a last minute gift idea for the coffee lover?  I made this and put it in the Condiment Squeeze Bottles you can buy at most any department store.  I tied a ribbon around it (it would be great if you found gingerbread men ribbon) with a tag shaped like a gingerbread man!  With just a squeeze you have gingerbread coffee!  Delicious!

AMAZING! I was a little skeptical because I am not a huge fan of molasses, so I scaled it down to one serving for starters and WOW...it's the middle of Summer, and I cannot WAIT for Fall and Winter because I'm going to make this ALL of the time! I'm actually thinking about making a larger amount of the 'syrup' to store in the fridge so it's a little more convenient to make. I used fat free cream and cool whip and it was delicious!

I found this recipe last year during the holidays and my mom and I loved it.  I fell in love with Starbucks' gingerbread latte and this is a wonderful fix for that (the taste is pretty close!).  We made the syrup up and kept it in the fridge and enjoyed it several times.  We pulled it out on Christmas for family who came over and it made a special treat.

I really enjoyed this... was spiced just right not to mask the coffee flavor entirely. I only added just a hint of whipped cream to color the top, although I did add just a bit more white sugar to taste. Cloves can be overpowering fast and I was leery to garnish, but they did add that last little flavor booster it needed I thought. A special blend.

Pretty good. I didn't add whipped cream and I did use fat free milk in the coffee. The flavor was nice but not fantastic. I think it tasted like gingerbread but at the same time it had a strong molasses flavor. I will try it again with less molasses and maybe a bit more cinnamon and ginger.

This is certainly tasty, but it was a little too heavy for me. Great flavor, although I think I could have done without that much molasses. I topped with French Vanilla Cool-Whip which tasted fantastic with this. Thanks :)

Did I just put baking soda in my coffee? Yes! and I like it. It does taste like gingerbread. Don't be sceptical, try this. What a nice surprise. Thank you Jennifer for sharing this unique recipe.

I altered the recipe a bit as I didn't have molasses and whipped cream. I used honey instead of molasses and put double cream instead of the whipped cream. It's soooooo good! Can't get enough! 
PS I make it with tea as well as with coffee. Tastes amazing either way!!!
I tried it last week and it instantly became my favourite drink ever! Don't have to spend 5 euros a day for Starbucks lattes)))

Tastes just like a gingerbread cookie was dunked in my coffee.  Very easy to make.  I didn't have whipped cream but I'm sure that would only make it 6 stars instead.  I wasn't sure about waiting the full 10 minutes to let the mix refrigerate (impatient to try it) but I saw how the mix puffed up a little with the baking soda and turned a nice caramel brown color.  Thanks for sharing!

This tastes like a gingerbread cookie, but the baking soda and 10 minutes of refrigeration are unnecessary.

This was pretty good! I made this as written except I used Splenda brown sugar. In the directions it doesn't state where to add the teaspoon of cloves, so I added it with the other spices and also dusted it on top of the whipped cream. I think this recipe just needs some slight tweaks because the gingerbread flavor was very mild. I would use half the molasses next time because it over powered the other flavors. And I would double the cinnamon and cloves. I would also dust the top with fresh ground nutmeg along with the cloves. I will definitely be trying it again! Thanks for this tasty coffee idea!

I thought this was really great.  I had to use vanilla Cool Whip, because it is all that I had, and it worked fine.  I did not think it was grainy as some others had stated, but my coffee was really hot, so maybe that helped.

this is a very good recipe. I think the flavors are just right, however don't skimp on the half n half or the whipped cream. They really bring it all together. Drink it when it's raining outside!

Better than the gingerbread lattes I've had at the local coffee shops, and much, much more affordable - I've already shared this with my pottery class and my sister-in-law. It's a hit - thanks!!

Yummy! This was easy, didn't take too long, and my coworkers loved it too. Just like drinking a slice of gingerbread. Thanks!

Very tasty, likely really good base for addition of brandy.

I thought this might be a good coffee for the fall, but I was not a big fan.  I'm not sure if it was from the molasses or if it needed more ginger, cinnamon and cloves.

Great recipe! I used honey instead of molasses and it turned out great. I used milk instead of cream and skipped the whipped cream, as I just wanted a nice, simple warm drink. Delicious! Def. making again.

I was in the mood for an ice coffee drink so made an icy cold coffee variation instead. I made the molasses mixture than added the hot hot coffee so they blended well without being grainy tasting. Than took the mixture and poured it over ice cubes in my blender, added chocolate syrup and cinnamon creamer instead (no half n half), ran blender to desired consistency.  Plus, the ice made it frothy so didn't need whipped cream after all. 
Frothy,  incredibly delicious and will make again and again.

P.S. In the future, will make it less like Diabetes!

So yummy! I thought this sounded a bit weird, but I was really surprised how good it was. I only used about 1/2 T of the mix in my cup, and that was plenty sweet for me. I'll make this again.

Wonderful !  The only change I made was to add 1/2 t of cloves to the  mixture ... Because I love cloves ...and figured I won't always put whipped cream on top as one reviewer said it didn't need .. Such a nice treat for the holidays !

This was really delicious. I had no problem with texture or flavor. It makes me want to continue to put molasses in my coffee.

I wouldn't make this again but for those who are regular coffee drinkers that enjoy flavored brewed coffee - this is something you would want to try.

Really good but my husband and I weren't tasting a lot of gingerbread flavor. Maybe our coffee was too strong, or we will have to use more mix next time. We were bad and used real whipping cream in place of the 1/2 & 1/2 and omitted the whipped cream. All in all it was really tasty and great for the holidays.

Good but really sweet!  I didn't have any coffee so I added some of the sauce to hot cocoa and that was very good.  I can see this sauce tasting good on everything from coffee to ice-cream to cakes.

This was very good.  I only used about a teaspoonful of the stuff in a cup of coffee and the tablespoon was too much.  I also didn't have whipped cream, but, oh well.  I'll bet a little Bailey's or Kalua would kick this up a step!  Thanks for the recipe Jennifer!
