Should bake in deep dish pie crust I'm glad I put it on top of a foil lined cookie sheet. Haven't tried it yet but I'm sure it's going to be good:)

So easy to make and I had all the ingredients on hand. Definitely put a cookie sheet under the pies! I made one exactly as per the recipe and it was delicious. I decided to experiment a little with the second pie and added some milk chocolate chips. Also delicious. Next time I may try a little lemon zest to the original. I just like to play around with things a bit but it's perfect as is.

I think it has too much coconut and not enough pineapple. Also it was way too sweet for me. I don't think I would make this again since most of it got in the trash.

I make this frequently. It goes fast at bake sakes. A deep dish pie crust is definitely needed

We loved it! We made one and a half times the filling and used two 9" pie crusts and they came out perfect. Added a scoop of Cool Whip to top it off. So good! Will definitely make again.

I have made this pie every christmas for the last three years! The pie cooks out beautifully and taste delicious!!! I followed the recipe to the tee make sure you use a deep dish pie shell if you only want one pie.

Wow this is my most favorite pie ever!! I made my own crust for it and followed the recipe exactly (except I used half unsweetened and half sweetened coconut) and it turned out amazing!! It's not as sweet as I was expecting just perfect! This recipe would make great tarts too!
