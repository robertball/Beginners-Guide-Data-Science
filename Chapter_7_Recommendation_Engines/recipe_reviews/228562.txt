I’m always pleased when I’m the first reviewer of a recipe and can write an enthusiastic and positive review.  I do have my criticisms of this recipe, but they’re no biggies and don’t detract from the resulting muffin at all.  First, don’t bother measuring out 1-1/2 c. of the pumpkin. After doing so there was so little left in the 15 oz. can that I just used all of it.  Second, I found that just 1/4 c. of raisins was skimpy – so I added another 1/4 cup.  My remaining criticisms are slightly more important.  As I looked over the ingredients and then the batter itself, I could see this was going to make way more than 18 muffins; and so it did.  I got 24 perfectly sized and rounded muffins.  The instructions to make the streusel are unconventional, so I chose to prepare it in the standard manner of mixing the flour and sugar, adding the butter until crumbly (I use a fork) and finally the oats.  Because there were 24 muffins, not 18, I was short of topping and had no motivation to drag things out again to make another batch.  I had enough to top 12 muffins very nicely and chose to leave the other 12 without. With or without topping, they’re lovely.  They’re light and fluffy, not heavy and dense.  Without streusel they’d be great with cream cheese frosting, but they’re just perfect as is.  They’re gorgeous too, and just as delicious as they are pretty, not overly sweet and lightly spiced, so the pumpkin unmistakably takes center stage.  Bonus:  the topping actually stays put!

Was craving something with pumpkin and this did the trick! So moist and great flavor, the only thing I would do differently is add some chopped pecans to the streusel...other than that perfect!
Update: I added a cream cheese filling to these muffins and it worked out perfectly! I made the filling out of: 8 ounces cream cheese, softened, 1 cup powdered sugar & 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. I then placed the mixture on plastic wrap and made a log out of it, wrapped it up and put in the freezer for a few hours and then just sliced it when I needed it to put in the center of the muffin batter. So good!

If I were to rate this as a regular size muffin I'd give it 4 stars, but as a mini muffin this gets 5! I was able to make 12 regular muffins and 40 mini muffins. Make sure to double the streusel mixture. Also, I added about 1/2 cup of finely chopped pecans to the streusel; so glad I did! I found that the minis had the perfect balance of streusel-to muffin for optimal flavor; de-friggin'-liscious! I've Pinned the recipe and will be making these numerous times this fall. Great to make, store half to eat within a few days and freeze the rest. Then, as you want a muffin or two, remove from freezer and heat in microwave. Thanks for sharing!

Oh my!  Just a few things, as noted in the other reviews and I feel the same way...double the raisins,  use the whole 15oz can of pumpkin, and you MUST double the streusel topping!  I ended up with 24 muffins, but I suppose it depends on the size of your muffin cups.  I filled my cups almost to the top, leaving only enough room for the topping and they came out looking great.  These really are fabulous muffins!

Anyone who knows me knows I love to cook. My husband has been looking for a good pumpkin muffin. He was disappointed in Dunkin Doughnuts when he tried their pumpkin muffin. So I decided to give this one a try for him. This recipe was easy and taste awesome! He loved them as well as my daughter! You can't go wrong making theses muffins. Only thing different I did was to add a little more pumpkin spice, oatmeal and double the streusel topping( a must have). I am definitely pinning this one on pinterest.com!

We really loved these muffins but I wish Allreicpes.com had not taken away the Nutritional data at the bottom of all the recipes.  As a Weight Watcher I need to have this information and it is a great loss to the site.  In fact, it was one of the features I originally liked most about the site and has now made this recipes site less useful and less appealing to me.  In this day and age where most people are watching fat, fibre, carbs and protein content (and calories)more closely, why would you discontinue this service?  Please, please reinstate it.

This is the perfect recipe for fall! But I did have to -triple- the streusel (admit it, it's the best part!) to get a nice crunchy top to the 2 dozen mini and 9 full sized muffins the recipe made.  I also had to improvise on the 'pumpkin pie spice' seeing as it's not something I keep in the cupboard, but a combination of 2.5 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ginger and 1/2 tsp cloves did the trick quite nicely.

Great breakfast and easy! I made one dozen and thinned the rest of the batter for pancakes! The best pancakes I've ever had! My family agrees!

This recipe is magical! I had to make a few adjustments because of health reasons. Anyone who practices alternative baking knows what a pain it is to make adjustments and, often times, the recipe doesn't turn out or it is just so-so. But this recipe? Magical!

I used a gluten free flour blend in place of the all-purpose flour. I substituted one for one. I then reduced sugars to 1/2 cup total, using coconut palm sugar in place of the refined sugars. I then substituted coconut oil for the vegetable oil--one for one. 

Even with my adjustments these muffins came out incredibly moist and delicious. I struggle with muffin recipes as most GF muffins are dry, sometimes crumbly and simply not good. I was so very pleased with how these turned out. Very moist, full of pumpkin flavor (I find that pumpkin flavor often gets lost in the baking process) and delicious!

Thanks for a great recipe!! Great way to start Halloween morning. :D

Delicous pumpkin muffin.  Followed recipe exactly.  Next time I may try butterflymamma's cream cheese filling idea.  Also pecans in the topping would be a great addition.  Yum!

These muffins are the BEST! They are light and almost melt in your mouth. The only things that I did different was that I used the full can of pumpkin and reduced the applesauce to a little under 1/2 cup. I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I made my own. I doubled the amount of streusel so that I would have enough for all of the muffins. This recipe made 24 muffins...We have 6 people in our family and we all loved these... My pumpkin spice mix is - 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp cloves, 1/4 tsp allspice.

So, I've rated this recipe before but I can't find a way to easily update/edit it, so here's another go.  I wanted to update it to mention (since I am not a huge fan of cleaning my muffin tin and I don't like wasting paper & aluminum for the cups) that a single recipe makes two perfect loaves (my Pyrex dishes are 8.5"x4.5").  When I bake this recipe I use cream cheese filling (8 oz. cream cheese + 1 c. confectioner's sugar + 1 tsp vanilla) and add pecans to the streusel.  Plus, I really like the flavor of the raisins with the pumpkin so I increase them to 1/2 cup.  I still bake the loaves at 350 but it takes at least an hour in my oven to set up.  Hope this is helpful!

Wonderful muffin!  Opted to leave out raisins, but wow are these good!  I baked for 20 minutes and they were perfect.  Doubled the topping amount so I had enough.  Made a batch of the mini muffins too, they cooked about 13 minutes.  Will be making often!  Thanks for this awesome recipe!

I made this recipe with a few minor changes to suit my tastes and for ease. First off I used a whole 15 oz. can of pumpkin purée instead of measuring out 1.5 cups. I doubled the raisins (next time I'm tripling it). A couple hours before baking I put the raisins in a bowl with the eggs and vanilla (which I had whisked/beaten/forked together) and let them sit covered on the counter. Any recipe with raisins will benefit from an egg and vanilla soak tremendously.  The raisins come out soft and especially tasty. I also doubled the streusel and added cinnamon (about 2 teaspoons) and all spice (about 1/2 of a teaspoon). The recipe made 21 muffins for me. I could've stretched it to 24 if I'd not filled the cups almost to the top (I wanted decent sized muffin tops for the streusel). The muffins are delicious and popular. I will make them again.

Made these this morning with adjustments to suit what I had in the kitchen as well as cutting the sugar some.  I have found that less sugar doesn't seem to affect the outcome for the most part.  I used a total of 1-1/2 cups of sugar instead of 2, didn't have applesauce so I went with all pumpkin.  Stirred in some cranberries and topped as the recipe reads.  They were excellent, moist and still sweet.  A definite keeper - especially for a pumpkin lover!

Delicious muffins -- I made them for a work breakfast and people were asking for the recipe. I used sultanas for the raisins since I had them, and they were a great fit for the color and texture of the muffins. The recipe does make 18 very large muffins -- spreading them out should make 24 reasonably-sized ones.

Not one complaint with this recipe. Was excellent. This does not produce a crumbly topping rather it melts in and is almost carmelized tasting in places. I didn't have oil so substituted butter for the batter but no other changes. I tripled the topping and that perfectly covered 12 regular sized and 36 mini muffins.

This muffins were very moist and easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly except I used a whole 15oz can of pumpkin and left out the raisins. I did have trouble with the topping not getting crumbly so it ended up being one big chunk of streusel on top of the muffin but that was fine with me. The muffins were laking some flavor so next time I will be increasing the pumpkin pie spice. overall these muffins were great and will be making them again in the near future.

Great recipe! Instead of the crumb topping I topped the muffins before baking with salted pumpkin seeds to add some extra nutrients. The salty crunch made a nice contrast to the spicy sweet muffins. This recipe is a keeper!

Followed advice here to use entire can of pumpkin and doubled raisins.  Only other change I made was to sub one of the three eggs with flax meal.  (one tbsp flax meal in three tbsps water for five minutes.  Then use just like an egg.)  These are seriously good, maybe a little sweet.  Might try cutting back on sugar next time.  The applesauce I used had no sugar.

I am a baker and this recipe is fabulous. Just a couple modifications I made and I'm glad- double quantity of raisins and double quantity of the topping. My actual yield was 17 muffins. I used large ice cream scooper to get consistent size for all. They end up looking like jumbo muffins. I got rave reviews from friends who are bakers as well. Thumbs up- this recipe is moving to my "favorites" binder.

Just made these for breakfast and they were a hit with my family!  I did make a few changes as posted by other reviewers.  I added a full 2 c. of pumpkin puree and substituted about 3/4 c. chocolate chips instead of the raisins as we are a chocolate family. Also, I doubled the topping and instead of the heavier rolled oats, I used two instant oatmeal packs that I had in cinnamon roll flavor. The spices in the pack and the finer bits of oats made the topping less heavy looking and gave it a great flavor.

Wonderfully moist muffins, I didn't have the applesauce so just used more of the pumpkin. I am not a pumpkin pie fan but I love pumpkin breads and muffins.

For the person wanting the nurtitional info, it is still there just scroll down under the reviews toward the bottom and click on the button "see more" and it gives the complete breakdown.

Just make these, you won't regret it! Wow....I ate two right out of the oven. My boys loved them too. Definitely a keeper. I subbed half of the flour for white whole wheat, used 2 cups of pumpkin and skipped the applesauce (had 2 cups of pumpkin to use up)...used probably 5.5 tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of 4 tsp, tripled the streusel and added chopped almonds. Mine made 22 good sized muffins, baked @ 31 min. Really, so very good!

Yummy, moist muffin! I used mini chocolate chips instead of nuts. I think a dollop of cream cheese frosting will make these muffins a close second to coffee shop muffins.

I loved, loved, loved, these muffins!  I had to press the topping into the muffins, because after taking the first batch out of the oven, the topping was falling off.  (I didn't mind eating it off the counter)  :) I will make these again, they feed my pumpkin craving.  MK

D'lish! I followed other comments and used the whole can of pumpkin and just omitted the applesauce. I forgot to put in the raisins, so I put them on top and then omitted the streusel top. They are absolutely fabulous!

I made these tonight.  They are awesome.  Easy recipe to follow.  I have tried many pumpkin muffin recipes, but none come close to this recipe. I got 24 muffins and doubled the streusel as receommended.  Yummy!

Excellent pumpkin muffins!!! Don't bother measuring the 1 1/2 cups pumpkin.  After doing so there were only a couple tablespoons left so I just used the whole can.  I have made these twice--first time adding the raisins, second time adding cranberries instead of the raising.  Absolutely delish either way.  I didn't put the streusel on them simply because I prefer a little less sweet. I will most definitely make these again and again!!!

Exactly what I was looking for. Moist, fluffy and cake like. Recipe made the 18 muffins as stated. My only recommendation would be to double the topping.  This will now be a "must make" for fall.

These were amazing!  The family loved them. I did use the entire can of pumpkin (just cause I didn't want to waste any.) and added more raisins.  But, other than that, I wouldn't change a thing!

Made these with my oldest daughter and we had fun doing that :) Used only one cup of brown sugar (not packed hard) and omitted white sugar. Used 1/3 c of oil and subbed applesauce for rest of oil. Used 2 t of pumpkin pie spice and the rest a combo of cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, and cloves.  Did not make topping. We loved these!

Excellent recipe. I found it sweet but my husband and kids thought it was just right.  I used cinnamon, cloves, allspice and nutmeg since I didn't have pumpin pie spice.  I have made it as muffins and as bread and both turned out well.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

I really like these muffins. I just made a few very simple adjustments. Like others, I doubled the streusel recipe, used a little extra pumpkin puree, and instead of pumpkin pie spice, I used cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg. I lowered my oven temp to 325 degrees and baked them for 18-19 minutes. They came out moist and dense. A perfect pumpkin muffin for a Fall morning!

Outstanding! Moist and delicious!
Followed instructions of previous reviewer and used entire can of pumpkin, and doubled the raisins. Great for a crowd...This recipe made 2 dozen full sized muffins.

I thought this was good but I think the actual muffin part would be better with nutmeg, cinnamon, and cloves in it instead of pumpkin pie spice (like pumpkin bread). It would make it "spicier". I think the topping should be doubled also! It's the best part but there's not enough of it.

This is the second time making this recipe and its a huge hit every time. The only thing is I add cinnamon to the recipe and I add cinnamon to the streusel topping. I double the streusel topping and my family hates raisins so I omit those. I also add chopped walnuts. Instead of using plain applesauce I use cinnamon applesauce. This recipe is unbelievably delicious.

Great fall recipe ~ I did use 1/2 cup of golden raisins and changed the topping slightly. for the topping I used chopped pecans in place of the oats.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly, thank you for sharing.

I hate to bake, but this recipe was pretty easy. I followed the recipe exactly, and the muffins are delicious. Not too sweet either. The "streusel" didn't seem like a traditional streusel, but tasted good. Will make again; beats buying a muffin everyday for breakfast.

This is a great recipe! I only used oil simply because I didn't have any applesauce on hand. Muffins were super light and fluffy and more importantly super tasty! I was planning on making double topping from other reviews but am glad I forgot. I figured i'd make more if i needed it, but I actually had some topping left over using the original measurements. I left out the raisins as my family isn't big on them, but i'm sure they would be a delightful addition. Looking forward to making again and again adding new flares and flavors. Happy baking/cooking!

I made this recipe exactly as written...I did not change a thing.  I didn't have pumpkin pie seasoning but did make my own from a recipe on this site as well.  I filled the muffin cups almost to the top and I got exactly 18 muffins.  I had enough streusel topping for all of the muffins.  They are delicious.  A nice light & fluffy muffin.  I will make these over and over!

So yummy! I woke up to a perfect fall-like New England morning,just the right occasion to make delicious pumpkin muffins.The only changes I made were: I used 1/2 cup of sour cream in place of applesauce.I love they flavor & texture sour cream gives to baked goods-they turn out perfectly moist.I also decided not to add any raisins.The batter & topping amount were perfect to make 12 large & 12 mini muffins.My 2 year old daughter could not get enough! Thanks for sharing =)

I would probably bake there for a few minutes less than the recipe calls for, as they were a little too done on the bottom.

Great taste and easy to make! Just like the first reviewer said, use the whole can of pumpkin. It's only a smidge more than what's called for, so don't bother measuring! I also got more than the dozen muffins. It says, I think about 20 , but mine were small, and I think 12 would have been more like bake shop muffins, with the muffin top, but I felt I had enough streusel.

Just for handiness and health I used more oats and less flour; more pumpkin and no applesauce; cranberries instead of raisins; and coconut instead of veg. oil. They are amazing! Make sure you get the spice right before you start baking, more is better for me. :)

Made this recipe quite a few times now. I don't really like how the streusel holds up after a few days so I just omit it and sprinkle some oats on top. I haven't made it with raisins, but sometimes I add dark chocolate chips. Next time I'm going to try increasing the applesauce and reduce the amount of oil. Reliable muffin, always turns out great.

I'm a pumpkin fanatic and loved these muffins.  I got 18 muffins out of the recipe.  I left out the raisins for personal preference.  I love the flavor and texture of these muffins.  Thanks for a great recipe to cure my pumpkin cravings.

Delicious and moist! I cut the sugar (used ~3/4 cup each brown and white instead of 1 c.) and oil (by 1/3 c.) a bit and increased the applesauce (by 1/3 c.) and they were still so sweet and moist. Also doubled the raisins as suggested by other commenters.

I made these this morning as I was craving pumpkin. I also used the full can of pumpkin. I added chocolate chips instead of raisins and instead if the streusel I sprinkled on this Caramel Crunch topping that I bought from Pampered Chef. Turned out yummo. Great recipe.

Love this! Not too much of any one thing. I didn't add the raisins, but think some pecans in the struesel would add something to them.

These were absolutely fantastic! We ate the muffins with our lunch and had them for breakfast the next morning. 
The one tiny mistake was that this recipe makes a full two dozen muffins. But I was pleasantly surprised to find that out, so I was very pleased with this recipe :)

My 4 month old started crying before I could make the streusel topping but I still think they were quite good . I ran out of applesauce so I just used the whole can of pumpkin. Omitted about 1/4 cup of white sugar. Didn't miss it.

These were excellent.  I substituted wheat flour and added 2 Tbsp flax seed and used my jumbo muffin pans (made 12) ... Just the right amount of streusel for jumbo size.  I also doubled the raisins.  My kids loved them and they are definitely going in my recipe book!

My batch yielded 24 muffins and I filled the cups almost to the top.  Double the streusel topping if you like a sweeter muffin.

Great muffins! Just the recipe I was looking for to use home processed pumpkin! The topping is just perfect and stays put, I hate it when you lose all the goody to the floor! Followed reviews and doubled topping, perfect!

Just tried these. My husband says they aren't bad but he would not go back for seconds. A little to much pumpkin pie spice seems to leave a somewhat unpleasant aftertaste. Very moist and has an excellent texture.

Love it! Omitted the applesauce and just used one 16-oz can of pumpkin puree, reduced the brown sugar in the batter to just half a cup, omitted the raisins, and used allspice instead of pumpkin pie spice. I usually don't tinker with recipes so much, but with muffins, you usually can't go wrong. The kids *devoured* these and said several times that they tasted just like pumpkin pie. They also didn't realize there were oats in the batter (as opposed to just on top). This recipe is a keeper.

I used all pumpkin instead of any oil and doubled the streusel. I also used a cream cheese filling (8 ounces softened cream cheese, 1 cup sifted powdered sugar, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla). This made 24 muffins. If you use the cream cheese filling, you will need to bake for 35 minutes. It's hard to tell when they're finished and you want to err on the overbaked side because if you don't, then the muffins will "crater" when you take them out. I'd probably make the spices stronger next time.

The muffins were fantastic, would give them 8 stars if possible.  I used the the entire can of pumpkin (15oz.) and used whole wheat flour.   I also used Butterflymamma's cream cheese  filling -  excellent!! & doubled the streusel topping.   I dropped the filling by  teaspoon onto wax paper & froze it before adding to the cupcake liners.  Only sugestion,  fill the liners 1/3 way, add the filling, finish filling the liners.  It was hard to push the filling down into the batter without making a mess.  Very moist, flavorful and unfortunately gone......

Very good muffins.  I actually got 2 dozen full-sized cupcakes out of this recipe.  I would probably make 1.5 times the streusel topping next time.

These muffins taste amazing! They get 5 stars for taste, other than a slight taste caused by either a little too much baking soda or baking powder, next time I will cut down a bit. I am going to have to play around with the ingredients to see if I can cut down on the sugar and fat content.

Its all about the topping.  Will definitely triple the topping next time.  I doubled it this time and it wasn't quite enough to cover the 18 muffins I ended up with.  I used half whole wheat flour/ half white and I used splenda for the white sugar.  I poured the batter into the muffin cups and let the kids put raisins and/or choc chips on top. We mixed them in with toothpicks.  They ended up staying near the top of the muffin though so next time I will mix them into the batter before filling the cups.  For 18 muffins with dbl the topping and splenda these equaled about 250 calories each.  They certainly need raisins or choc chips b/c the bottom half of these without any were just too plain.

The absolute BEST pumpkin anything I have ever made!  I used white whole wheat flour and I doubled the topping - otherwise followed recipe.  It made 24 amazing muffins and I have been getting great reviews from my family as well.  Due to the wheat flour they were done in about 20 minutes.

Made these the night before out hike last Saturday. I knew we'd be running around in the morning and wanted something quick to grab to take out the door to the mountains. We went with some friends and everyone loved them. The kids gobbled them up and LOVED the topping. I TRIPLED the topping, doubled the raisins  and made big muffins.  Will be making again and sending the recipe to my friend who we went hiking with. Thanks for the recipe. I think I will try some pecans next time. (Although they are great like they were).

THESE ARE AMAZING!!! I had all of the ingredients on hand except for the applesauce so I used the rest of the small can of pumpkin puree in place of it. Other than that, I didn't make any substitutions/alterations. I have made several recipes that have a "streusel topping" and most of them (when baked the same amount of time as the cake/pie) melt/dissolve during baking. This streusel held up and looked BEAUTIFUL when the muffins came out of the oven! SO YUMMY!!!

Splendid recipe.  I used paper liners and prepped for 24 muffins.  I didn't have enough oil on hand so I replaced it with melted butter with excellent results.  I also used Quaker Instant Oats.  As others noted, I made sure to double the topping.  This recipe is a keeper.  Even my pumpkin-hating husband has eaten a few.  There are only 4 muffins left and I made these last night (sans raisins).  There are no complaints about any aspect of this recipe.  Having a gas oven that cooks on the hot side, I had to make sure to cook on the shorter side of the cook time.

Delicious! Made 24 full muffins for me - again, as others have said, that may just be the size of my muffin tins. Also doubled the streusel as other reviewers suggested. They're absolutely delicious!

I love to cook, but I am a very hesitant baker, nothing ever seems to come out right. These muffins were so easy to make and they were so good!  Very moist and very flavorful.  The strusel topping was great too. I scaled down the recipe using the tool at the bottom and it worked very well. I also made my own pumpkin pie spice using freshly grated nutmeg, cin., cloves, and ground powdered ginger. Very good stuff!  I will be making these again!

I cut this recipe in half. I used homemade pumpkin pie spice and upped the vanilla to a full teaspoon. Raisins were optional for this recipe, I chose to add them. I got 11 regular sized muffins out of one recipe. Baked at 350*, my muffins were done at a little over 20 minutes. These were moist, chewy and packed with spices. Since I made these yesterday, there are none left. Not only did my family love them, so did my co-workers.

I lightened this up by using egg beaters, 1 cup of whole wheat flour (instead of all white) and half oil and half applesauce (in addition to the required applesauce).  Like everyone else, I used the whole 15 oz can of pumpkin puree.  I doubled the topping based on reviews and I had more than enough to top the 22 muffins I got.  I was lazy and used the food processor to prepare the streusel topping instead of the method in the recipe.  They are definitely a breakfast muffin - not very sweet which might be my fault as I used unsweetened applesauce. Perhaps my pumpkin pie spice was old but it seemed to need more flavor.  Great base recipe and I'll try again with fresh pumpkin pie spice as well as saving some for cream cheese frosting.  Went great warm with my morning coffee as is, though.  Thanks for sharing!

What a wonderful treat to enjoy on this beautiful fall day, especially served along side a cup of “Baked Apple Dumpling” coffee. Simple pleasures are the best.  I substituted butternut squash I had grown in the garden and baked the previous night instead of the canned pumpkin.  This recipe made 24 muffins instead of the 18 mentioned.

I read all the reviews and really couldnt wait to try these muffins I'm not sure how they taste yet as they are in the oven now.  I made double of the topping, didnt use the applesauce, did use a 15 oz can of pumpkin puree.  The recipe made 6 Texas size muffins and 6 regular size one. The 6 big ones are going to the office tomorrow and the small ones are for home.  They smell great cant wait to try them.

The muffins are fluffy, moist and amazing!  I followed the direction, excluding the raisins.  I used a large muffin pan, filled the cups 3/4, and got 12 muffins.  Doubled the topping and cooked for 35min.  The house smelt amazing and my husband ate 2 straight out of the oven!  These muffins are a slice of fall heaven!

I made these tonight so there would be a yummy breakfast waiting for the family first thing in the morning. They did not disappoint! I didn't see the need for applesauce too, so I just subbed 1/2 addtl pumpkin puree, used 2/3 cup organic extra virgin coconut oil instead of the veggie oil, and used 1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour instead of 1/2 c. regular flour. I also used 2 extra large goose eggs instead (goose and duck eggs are amazingly superior in baked goods!). Finally, I added 1/4 c. shopped pecans and 1/4 c. pumpkin seeds (I just happened to have on hand) to the streusel. The recipe made 22 very full muffin cups and one batch of topping covered all of them.

Family likes these muffins!  Followed the suggestions of the first reviewer by doubling the topping, using the entire 15oz can of pumpkin, 1/2 cup of raisins and making 24 muffins.  I cut the white sugar to a little less than half, and they were still plenty sweet.

Amazing flavor, texture, and something new with the streusel topping!  These were gone the next day after I made them for my family (and it made quite a few!!!) The only change that may be needed is to make a little more topping ... it was spread a little thin.  And since I didn't have applesauce, I substituted it with pumpkin, although I'm sure it would have been great either way.  But all in all, a great dessert muffin!

I substituted coconut oil for the vegetable oil and increased the oats (1 cup oats, 1/2 cup ground oats) and decreased the flour to 1 1/2 cups. They were a crowd-pleaser!

These are just ok...I used all organic & high quality ingredients but they came out very bland. They are fluffy & moist & only needed 25 min in the oven...they could've probably used a couple min less too. The recipe made 24 regular sized muffins & the streusel was barely enough to cover a dozen. Wasn't a big deal to me as I made a cream cheese frosting w/a hint of cloves for the other 12:) I would make these again, but next time I'll add in some pecans in the batter as another reviewer mentioned & I'll definitely up the cinnamon & nutmeg for sure!! I'd probably add in some cloves as well. Also, maybe do 2-2.5 cups of pumpkin.

Really good! Plan to make again this week. Almost followed recipe as written... but didn't have pumpkin pie spice on hand so improvised with 2 T allspice, 1 T cinnamon, 1 T nutmeg. No raisins either, but added 1 Cup chopped walnuts. Loved the recipe, worked well with paper muffin tin liners - moist with wonderful streusel top!

I enjoyed the moistness of the muffins. I omitted the white sugar and only used brown. I substituted raisin for Craisins. 
It made 12 large muffins, exactly for something quick,when running out the door to work. I do agree the streusel is the best part.

Fantastic!  These muffins are light but full of flavor.  I have made these muffins three times, each time varying the amounts of white vs. brown sugar, flour vs. oats and oil vs. applesauce.  Each time they have come out incredibly delicious!  My favorite was using only 1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup oats and cutting down flour by 1/2 cup, using 1/2 cup oil and 2/3 cup applesauce.  I did not have pie spice so I made my own (see Allrecipes Pumpkin Pie spice).  We love these muffins and will continue to make them again and again!  Thank you for such an incredible recipe!

Delicious! Made adjustments as per suggestions. Didn't have the applesauce, and added the extra pumpkin. Was also generous with the spice, and doubled the topping. Made 14 large muffins.

This is a great recipe!It makes enough for 2 dozen which is great because there will be some to freeze and save for later. It was fantastic as is, I followed the recipe exactly. The only thing I might consider next time is maybe doubling the raisins. This one is a keeper!

To sum these up quickly?  Just...wow!!    A new " go to " favorite for me to whip up. Followed recipe as written,so the only thing I can note is that I used my home made applesauce.    My girls will have me at Rockstar status after breakfast in  the morning!

I just made this recipe and my husband and I loved them!  The muffins are moist and fluffy with great flavor.  I followed the recipes exactly only I baked mine in a muffin top pan. The baking time was only 10-12 min.  I will definitely be making these again.

Not bad. Moist. Good streusel topping. Used stevia instead of white sugar. Maybe that's what made it just ok. Instead of raisins, I used dried cranberries and bumped up the pumpkin pie spice a little. I would try some of the other pumpkin muffin recipes before making this again.

I have to agree that adding more pumpkin (the whole can) and more spice makes these muffins absolutely delicious. The recipe certainly makes more than 18 regular muffins; I got 18, 24 mini- and a medium loaf this last time. Plus, streusel must be tripled to make the right balance. They are very popular among my friends, and I have more to share.

These are delicious - some of the best muffins I've tasted.  Very moist with just the right amount of spice for my taste.  I did substitute about 1/2 of the flour with whole wheat flour for some extra fiber, but otherwise made these exactly as written.  I also omitted the streusel topping (no brown sugar left) and just sprinkled some cinnamon sugar on top before baking.  I'll definitely be making these again.  Thanks!

Very tasty recipe! I particularly liked the topping (though I doubled it as a few other reviewers did). I used a full can of pumpkin and only a half cup of oil, and used 1 c. each of wheat flour, white flour and oatmeal. Also chocolate chips in place of raisins, but otherwise left it the same. Very moist and delicious!

These are amazing! Very moist and flavorful. I ended up getting 24 muffins out of this recipe. I did not have applesauce so I took the advice of another reviewer and used a 1/2 cup more of pumpkin puree in place of the applesauce. They came out great! I will be making these again.

Moist and full of flavor.  I ran out of brown sugar so I used white sugar in the topping and that was tasty.

My family loved it so much . I made a few changes : used 1cup of  Truvia baking blend + 2 TBS molases in place of 2 cups of sugar (next time I'm gonna add more molases may be 3 or 4 TBS).  As it was suggested I used the whole can of pumpkin. I  skipped the topping and made a cream chease glaze (4 ounces cream cheese, room temperature,
1/2 cup powdered sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 3 to 4 tablespoons milk) I got 18 muffins  and baked them at first on 400 degree to get the cracked muffin tops then reduced it to 350 for 15 mins

Really tasty muffins! My first pumpkin muffins and my husband and I thought they were great. I left out the raisins and next time I will leave out the streusel topping as it was messy and not ideal for eating in the office. Maybe some sort of frosting might hold together a bit better.

I didn't have applesauce, pumpkin pie spice, or enough brown sugar, so I used one cup of oil (total), two cups of white sugar in the muffin, and allspice. I didn't measure the spices, and I'm glad I didn't because the muffins themselves have such a warm, fall taste. They're magnificent. I quadrupled the crumb topping, and I wasn't crazy about it on its own (the pieces that fell off), but with the muffin it's okay. It made 12 regular sized and 3 jumbo, filling to the top. I'll definitely make the muffins again and just find a different crumb topping.

Yummy!  I tripled the streusel and used my fingers to mix in the butter.Recipe made 24 regular muffins.  Made my own pumpkin pie spice which is so easy, you can find the recipe on this site.

They were definitely soft and kind of fluffy...doubled the streusel b/c, like other reviewers said it makes quite a few more muffins than it says. Also, might add cinnamon next time.

I spent about an hour looking for just the right muffin recipe. I settled on this one and decided not to add the streusel topping or raisins. I just didn't want anything too sweet. These were perfect! Oh, and like a dummy, I forgot to add the spices. No problem, because they were great anyway. My breakfast guests took the leftover muffins home, so it looks like I have to make more. Thank you for the great recipe!

SO, SO good! Make sure that you double the streusel topping so that each muffin has plenty. As is these are super delicious but we add fresh cranberries to the mix and it really takes them to another level. We have also added chocolate chips & that was tasty too.

I made these muffins for work and they were a huge hit.  I doubled the streusel recipe because I made mini-muffins and wanted a high streusel to muffin ratio.  I topped it off with a little glaze.  Dropped in the break room at 230 and they were gone by 500

I too tripled the streusel. To take this recipe to a five star I would add pumpkin seeds to the streusel, pecans to the batter or streusel, and possibly a cream cheese filling; otherwise, it is rather ordinary. I would also consider making LARGE muffins for a lovely presentation for Holiday party.

These muffins were amazing.  I tried to lighten the recipe by doing only 3/4 C of each of the sugars, substituting 1 C of whole wheat flour for all-purpose and switching amounts of oil & applesauce (i.e. 2/3C applesauce & 1/2 C oil.  They were so good... I can only imagine how good they were with the "real" ingredients.  I doubled the streusel as others suggested. (so much for light!) I got 24 mini and 12 regular muffins.

AMAZING.  I subsituted more pumpkin for the applesauce and added crumbled almond paste to the streusel topping.  This is a keeper, they vanished instantly from my kitchen.

Really delicious muffin!  Followed the muffin part of the recipe exactly, but I did double the topping.  (I think this is a must!)  I also added a dash of cinnamon and pecan pieces to the streusel.  LOVE these!

These are very yummy. I made a batch with the topping and another without. I found that it tastes delicious either way but if I want a sugar fix I grabbed one with the topping. This was very easy to make and didn't take as long as the recipe said. I baked them at 375 degrees because then they have the domed top compared to getting the flat tops. 25 degrees makes a difference.

Great flavor.  My pumpkin seasoning was made from one of the Allrecipe recipes.  I used home-frozen squash puree and home-canned apple sauce, unsweetened. Made 20 big muffins. Probably a bit too moist because they didn't want to come out of the muffin tins and most of the tops came off.  Next time I'll use paper liners.  And there definitely will be a next time.

Cont...Ok, have just done some fact finding as I was curious and unhappy about the bitter after taste, which I and a few others mentioned with this recipe.  Hope this helps make this a true, 5 star repipe!
 taken from www.thekitchn.com "When heated, sodium bicarbonate also produces sodium carbonate, which doesn't taste so great. It leaves an unpleasant, alkaline flavor behind. But if you mix baking soda with an acid (like lemon juice or another citric acid carrier) then the sodium carbonate is partially neutralized and leaves behind less aftertaste. This acid also helps the carbon dioxide gas release more quickly.

Baking powder is basically just baking soda with acid added in. It has just enough acid to use up the sodium carbonate. Shirley Corriher in her great book Cookwise says that 1 teaspoon baking powder contains 1/4 teaspoon baking soda. The other 3/4 teaspoon contains the acid and cornstarch."
So, in future by eliminating the bicarbonate of soda completly and using only baking powder and self rising flour, the problem is eliminated.  Most of the other muffin recipes I looked at called for just these two.  Happy baking!

Just made the muffins and they are delicious.  I didn't have any applesauce so I used apple butter instead, plus I doubled the streusel.  Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe.

What an amazing recipe! I didn't change anything but maybe next time I will add pumpkin seeds. Made exactly 25 muffins. One thing I did notice is that for the streusel mix, I needed to add another 2 tbsp of flour and oats to make it more crumbly. Will be making this again for Thanksgiving!

These were fine.  I liked the streusel topping idea because it made them really easy to transport. I made them as mini-muffins for a tea and one recipe made about 90 muffins.  The muffin itself was very cake-like.  Not at all dense.  I definitely would have liked them to be more substantial in texture and flavor. Also the steusel was weird, paste-like instead of crumbly.  Should have taken the advice of another reviewer and made it in a more conventional method.  All worked fine for the tea though and not a bad recipe at all.  Thanks!

These are delicious and came out just like the picture, so pretty! I doubled the topping and glad I did! This recipe made me 22 regular sized muffins. I didn't have apple sauce so I used apple butter instead and it worked out perfect. I also left out the raisins.

This was an excellent recipe, the muffins turned out moist and very flavorful. I did everthing the same as how the recipe was written with the exception of the pumpkin pie spice, I didnt have any on hand and wasnt willing to buy any, so I put into the batter, 11/2 TSP of cinnamon, 1TSP of nutmag and 1TSP of ginger. This is a must try!

These muffins were awesome. They were very moist and flavourful. I used 2cups of pumpkin and I replaced a 1/3 of the oil with applesauce. As suggested by others I made double the amount of topping. The recipe made 17 good sized muffins. I will make these again for sure.

Amazing!  I did take a couple suggestions from other reviewers like tripling the strudel mixture & adding pecans as well as stuffing with cream cheese.  These muffins are to die for!  A permanent addition to my cache of recipes!

I rated a 3 because of  my mistake of forgetting the applesauce. This made the muffins a little dry. Cooked at the correct temperature and time. I'm guessing the applesauce really makes it more moist. Don't know if I want to  waste this much ingredients  again. Maybe try again in 6 months. They look great,  just not moist and not enough  flavor. Don't think I'll be  sharing with my neighbors.

Love these!  I  made a few changes due to what I had on hand.  Only had 1 cup pumpkin so added 1/2 cup of crushed pineapple and added walnuts instead of raisins.  Also replaced more of the oil with applesauce.  I used a Splenda blend for both the white and brown sugars.  Will make again, this is a keeper!

Made these today. They are so fluffy and light. I ended up with 31 regular sized muffins! I'm glad I followed the reviews that suggested to double the crumble. While the first batch was baking, I put the extra crumble in the refrigerator. It was much easier to use on the second batch. I subbed dairy-free butter.

Delish.  I halved the recipe and made my purée from scratch but I found that 11 muffins were made From the batter and they cooked in 25 mins.  I also made a mistake and forgot to add the salt so I mixed it into the crumb mix and it was still amazing

Lovely, lovely recipe! These were very moist and I found the flavours were even better the next day. Highly recommend!

My muffin liners were “regular” so I actually got 24 muffins.

Delicious very moist, the only thing I did differently was to add 1/2 cup of raisins to batter and 1/4 cup of chopped pecans to streusel. This recipe makes a lot, I made 6 double sized muffins and 12 regular sized muffins.

I did my best to mess this recipe up, but it came out great anyway.  I must have gotten the second tsp of baking powder out  well that I put in by mistake.  Getting older, and so cooking can be a challenge at times. I didn't change a thing.  They are moist and delicious, and I can't wait to share them with my family.

This is a great muffin! Next time I will take the advice of others and make more streusel topping as this muffin is not too sweet. I also plan to mix in some chopped pecans to the topping. I will also add two extra teaspoons of pumpkin spice to the recipe. I did not use raisins, as my family does not like them.

These were the perfect fall muffin.  I did not have applesauce so I used sour cream instead.  I was also out of raisin and nutmeg.  They were delicious even without the missing ingredients.

These are SO good!!! I only had 1 egg to use, so I threw in 1 mashed banana and 1/4 C of flax seed in place of the other 2 eggs, and the muffins turned out to be fabulous. I skipped the streusel topping because I wanted to freeze the muffins for breakfasts throughout the month, and they were plenty sweet enough without it. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

These muffins are were a huge hit with everyone I shared them with. I used sugar substitute for the white sugar, doubled the streusel topping and added a 1/2 cup of chopped pecans. The muffins were fluffy and delicious and the pumpkin flavor really shone through. The next batch I plan to try with dried cranberries for an extra Fall kick. Excellent recipe!

I doubled the recipe following all directions and ingredients. Instead of using the optional raisins I used pecans crushed up. If you use the nuts you can use as much or as little as you want depending on your taste. These were fantastic with nuts I made a few with no strudel topping and no nuts they weren't as great as the ones with the nuts, the nuts really bring out more flavor. My son said they're okay they need more pumpkin which I do agree if you're doing no raisins, no nuts, or no strudel topping they need to have a little bit more flavor. Overall I will be making these again with the nuts and strudel topping.

I made these without the topping bc I was short on time and these are *amazing*! I can only imagine what the topping tastes like. They taste like a delicious cake, they’re light & airy and they have the perfect blend of tastes. I also like heartier, denser muffins but these are equally delicious. Will make these again.

Outstanding.  I cut the sugar with some Splenda to reduce calories, and tossed in some walnuts.  Wow, these are exceptionally moist and flavorful!! The only pumpkin muffin recipe I'll ever make.

This is the best muffin I have ever made!!!!   I am always in search of "the ultimate" recipe.  This is it!!  I made an error on this batch, and it still turned out great.  In the middle of the recipe, I realized I was out of eggs! (I am NEVER out of eggs) but today I was. I had to stop everything, run to the store for eggs. So when I got back into baking, I ended up forgetting one egg and the vanilla. Duh.  But the recipe was still fab-u-lous! PS..I added chopped pecans and more golden raisins. YUM!  Made exactly 18 muffins, and I used 1 can pumpkin. The 4 tsp pumpkin pie spice brings out the pumpkin flavor!

These were delicious! Thank you for sharing. I took other posters’ advice and used less oil—3/4 cup of canola oil. I will try using applesauce instead next time and add raw sugar on top too. I also substituted 2 cups of the flour with whole wheat pastry flour. The result was delicious and moist with a little less fat and some added fiber.

I really liked these muffins, I think as much as my old stand by recipe.  They just need a bit more pumpkin flavor, which I will improve upon when I make them again.  Note: add more pumpkin and spices!  I agreed with Naples34102 regarding the streusel, and combined those ingredients in the traditional way.  It was a nice topping without being overpowering.  I combined all muffin ingredients in 1 bowl, starting with the wet first and adding the dry last...no need for a blender, just use a whisk.  I, too, added a few more raisins and I think the next time I will add a few nuts also.  Reduced the recipe to make 6 muffins, and ended up with 8, this the recipe definitely yields more than listed.

I have made these muffins a few times and they’re delicious! I followed the top review, but didn’t add raisins, and doubled the streusel topping.  They freeze very well!  

I also never have pumpkin spice on hand so make my own using:  4 tsp. ground cinnamon, 1 tsp. ground nutmeg, 1 tsp. ground ginger.

I made these as written.  I'm not crazy about the  oats in the crumble topping and the pumpkin flavor isn't very strong, so next time (my husband really liked these, so I'll try the recipe again) I'll omit the oats from the topping and add some extra pumpkin pie spice.

Certainly I made changes cause I cook with what I have on hand. Mushed up an apple and a banana together instead of the apple sauce, used cinnamon, cardamom, and allspice for spices  and used dried cranberries. Turned out delicious!

These turned out fabulous. I made a lot of modifications.  I used gluten free Krustean flour. Duck eggs and natural sugar. No white sugar. And no apple sauce. I used plain low fat Greek yogurt instead.  The other thing I changed was I used extra virgin coconut oil. These came out rich sweet and moist. 
I tripled the vanilla, doubled pumpkin pie spice,and added more cinnamon. Then added both milk chocolate and semi sweet chocolate chips. 
 And I made them huge.  Everyone loved them they disappeared fast.

Great recipe!  It makes a lot, too.  I reduced the granulated sugar by a half cup and it was still very delicious.  I also subbed one cup of whole wheat flour instead of using all all-purpose.  Doubled the streusel like other reviewers suggested.  It made 24 muffins and one very full mini loaf pan.  Thanks for the recipe!

These muffins are delicious!  I doubled the recipe and got exactly 36. The ingredients were all things I had in my pantry, which I love!  They were a hit with my whole family.

I followed the recommendations of some bakers and used the full can of pumpkin puree and doubled the streusel topping. I got 18 nice and fully rounded muffins. Mine baked perfectly in 25 minutes. If I had pecans on hand I would have used these as well in the topping.

I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. I also substituted more pumpkin for the apple sauce. Used whole grain amaranth flour instead of white.  And for the topping I used pumpkin seeds and granola with the butter and sugar.

These are so great!! I didn't add the raisins, but put in pecans and walnuts instead, lightly chopped. I also cut down the sugar to 3/4 cup of each and they were still very sweet. I'll probably cut it to 1/2 cup of each next time. 

Make double the streusel it calls for, you won't be sorry!

Will make again. Used a little less sugar, including replacing some of it with Splenda.  Reduced oil by half, increasing apple sauce to compensate.  Added finely chopped pecans to batter.  Excellent!

Delicious, moist, and a perfect balance of pumpkin, spices, and sweetness. As others mentioned, the recipe yielded 24 regular size muffins, so I doubled the streusel recipe and had enough for all 24. I also added an extra 1/2 tsp. of vanilla, but other than that, I followed the recipe as written, and they turned out perfect. My entire family loved them. Thank you for a fantastic fall recipe!

I subbed a mixture of honey and molasses for the white sugar, and replaced the vegetable oil with 1/3 C butter and 1/3 C applesauce and added pumpkin seeds on top of  the struesel.

These muffins were just okay. Nothing extra special, though took a lot of ingredients and lengthy process. the topping was not nearly enough for the amount of muffins and kind of oozed over the muffins instead of crumbled. They muffins could have also been more moist.

I made these for my grand children, they were a hit! I left out the raisins, no one wanted them included. I also used einkorn whole wheat flour as that is what I had. I was afraid they would be heavy but were perfect. The recipe made 24 muffins so I doubled the streusel and not a bit too much. Today I put a second batch in the oven, the first batch was gone in about 18 hours!

As is typical for me, I said I want pumpkin muffins for breakfast...I start to make them and then have to play the substitution game because I'm out of lots of things...so these are my adjustments...use the full can of pumpkin, 1.25 cups brown sugar and no white sugar, use 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup Greek yogurt and skip the applesauce, replace raisins with 3/4 cup chopped walnuts, add 6oz mini chocolate chips, skip the topping. I got 12 regular and 6 jumbo muffins and they were moist and soft and delicious!

What do you Donita leftover pumpkin filling? I ad a good cup so I cut the recipe down to thirds and made six muffins. Also, I make more streusel for the holidays and use it on various pastries. Yum.

Yummy! I made this recipe exactly as written. It made 24 muffins instead of 18 so I made a little more streusel topping. I'll admit, I didn't blend the butter for the topping but instead cut the cold butter into the sugar. the way I'm used to. They came out looking EXACTLY like the picture and everyone loved them. Not too sweet, definitely a keeper!

I made these on the weekend and it was my first ever attempt at making anything with pumpkin.  They're absolutely delicious and my whole family loved them.  I opted out of adding raisins and I got exactly 18 muffins with a tiny bit of batter left over.  We have big cans of pumpkin here, so there was plenty left over.  I agree with the others about the streusel though, I'm definitely going to double the recipe next time...which will be this weekend because they're great for breakfast at work!

I had no apple sauce so I used 1/2 cup carnation milk instead. Worked fine. Also doubled the streusel topping and made 24 muffins.

Fixed exactly like the recipe, even with real oven cooked pumpkin., no can . While the muffins had good texture and tastes very good, it did not taste like pumpkin. It tastes more like spice cake hence the 3 stars. Worth making again when I want a more spice cake like muffin but NOT when I want a more pumpkin tasting muffin.

This recipe was okay but I'm still on the fence about weather I'll make It again. I like healthy food, and even added my own roasted buttercup squash rather than pumpkin, but even with the substitution of chocolate chips versus raisins I still found it tasted too healthy (not sweet enough) and that there was too much baking soda flavour. I also added butter rather than vegetable oil. The streusel on top was very good, and the muffins were very moist, which was good. If I made it again I'd add .5 tsp less baking soda, half a cup more chocolate chips and double the streusel, mixing half of it into the batter.

These are delicious and portions came out just as recipe indicated. I replaced the applesauce with 1/2 a mashed banana just because I didn't have applesauce. I also replaced white sugar with organic coconut sugar (cut amount by 1/4 c), 1/2 the vegetable oil with coconut oil, & 1/2 the all purpose flour with almond flour. Also, I added extra cinnamon to the mixture and hazelnuts to the streusel. These came out perfect and will make again.

Made this exactly as is, just switched the apple sauce with plain yogurt because I always have that in the fridge.  Made these several times and they're always perfect.  Big hit with the whole family.

These muffins are so o good. The only downside is the calories per muffin so I recommend replacing the oil and eggs with healthier alternatives and bypassing the strudel entirely.

So good - takes a little longer to make than other muffins, lots of ingredients to mix. But very tasty - makes 24 muffins, and freeze well!

I used Greek yogurt in place of the applesauce.  Then, I also topped then with confectioners sugar glaze. My boyfriend says they caused a "courtyard brawl."  Will DEFINITELY make again!!

Delicious muffins that stay moist even days later! I added a generous 2 cups of pumpkin instead of 1.5, and made the streusel topping the traditional way (sugar + flour, cut in the butter). Would highly recommend and plan to make them frequently!

Thank you for this wonderful recipe and all of the comments from people who have modified it to their tastes.  I have made this recipe several times and have perfected it (to my taste) by tripling  the streusel, reducing the sugar in the muffin by 1/2 cup and adding prunes and dried apples instead of raisins.  Also added pumpkin seeds to the streusel and main muffin!

Amazing! Doubled the topping, used the full can of pumpkin, and used butter in place of the applesauce and some of the oil since it's what we had. Didn't add raisins and still made a beautifully sized 24 muffins that came to the tops of the muffin cups without spilling over. Nice, crispy top and a light, fluffy texture with a good pumpkin flavor. And, as my husband said, they look professional!

3/2017 Great recipe, moist and sweet. I made a few changes  to suit our preferences. First, I decreased the brown sugar to 1/2 C, and they were plenty sweet. Also, I used 1/2 C of vegetable oil and the full can of pumpkin (15 oz). Second, soak the oats in the liquid mixture so that they soften up (or use quick oats). Also, I used half all-purpose flour and half whole wheat pastry flour for extra nutrition. Finally, for convenience, I omitted the streusel topping and sprinkled the muffins with Sugar-in-the-Raw.

Made these for a group of friends and a big hit! I did double the recipe just for the streusel and it was the perfect amount. Also soaked raisins in water for about 20 mins before adding to plump them up. Personally I would like more pumpkin flavor but not sure how to modify recipe to get that result. Will definitely make again and again!

I liked it even though I made some changes.  I changed the oil to melted butter because I was out of oil.  I only put in 1/2 cup white sugar.  I put in a full two cups of butternut squash instead of the pumpkin and applesauce.   I accidentally forgot the spices, and figured it would be ruined.  Nope, it was still quite tasty.  I also replaced the raisins with dried blueberries and added 1/2 cup craisins.  The only reason I took off a star was because the streusel topping was not even close to the right texture, so I added 1/2 cup flour to make it more crumbly.  It still did not turn out right, but it was still tasty.  Next time I'd do exactly the same as this time, except add the spices.

These were good.  Used whole wheat pastry flour, reduced sugar only using 2/3 c of each (and still plenty sweet)  replaced 1/2 of the oil with unsweetened apple sauce. Next time I would only add the strudel to the ones that would get eaten right away. And 1/2 the sugars.

I regularly look at the reviews and really appreciate the helpful comments.  I took the advice from other bakers and doubled the topping and I had enough for the 50 mini muffins.  I used butternut squash instead of pumpkin and apple butter instead of apple sauce.  I am very happy to use ingredients that I had on hand and very pleased with the results.

I made mini muffins.  It made 5 dozen.  I doubled the streusel topping and it was only a little bit too much.  You can really pile it on.  Thank you for the recipe.  Like others, I used the entire 15 oz. can of pumpkin.

I replaced the applesauce with an additional 1/2 cup of pumpkin puree.  Increased the oatmeal to 1 cup. In place of the vanilla extract, used orange extract. I added extra cinnamon to the batter. I left off the streusel topping. It made 12 medium muffins and 24 mini-muffins. I freeze them to mix up and add variety to breakfast during the week.

Will definitely be a keeper recipe! I made this Gluten Free by swapping the flour for Namaste perfect flour blend. My kiddo is allergic to wheat and egg but he can have egg in a baked recipe.  This worked out excellent. Very moist and yummy. I also used 2 cups fresh pulp purée.

These were exceptional, moist muffins! They were almost cake-like and reminded me of the pumpkin muffins I used to love at Perkin's restaurants. I followed the recipe exactly as is and made 12 jumbo muffins. My teenage daughter and her friends ate them for breakfast after a sleepover and couldn't stop raving about them. Serve them warm (microwave them if necessary) with a little butter, and it's heavenly!

GREAT. Who doesn't love a good streusel muffin. These were 
very good.  Recipe easily made 24 large muffins.  I also doubled streusel, and raisins. For the pumpkin spice I used  1 1/2 tsp.cinnamon. 3/4 tsp. ginger 1/2 tsp. allspice 1/2 tsp nutmeg.
All else the same.

I love these muffins!  A few edits:  I used roasted butternut squash so, which is super  easy - just cut squash lengthwise and roast on a cookie sheet with a  little water at 350 until it is soft.   I also did  not have apple sauce so I used  1 1/2 ripe bananas.  I also used only 1/2 c. white sugar (and it was still a bit too sweet) and substituted 1/2 c. wheat flour but still used 2 c. white flour.  They are delicious - I will make them again!

This  muffin was a hit! I decided to do this recipe as a present and I had gave it a test run today, it turned out amazing! I followed some advice on tripling the amount of streusel because this recipe yields a lot more than 18, (around 24-26), also regarding the  streusel, i recommend adding a total of about  2 -2 1/2 cups of flour because the original turned out way to creamy. I hope this helps all who make it!

I made these exactly as directed and while they are good, they aren't very pumpkin'y'. They are moist, tasty and awesome with cream cheese frosting, but I had hoped for a more pumpkin flavor.

I made this as written with the exception of using additional pumpkin puree in place of the applesauce since it was missing from the pantry. With the exception of the streusal being enough for maybe half of a batch they came out well.

I made it exactly as written and it was amazing. Really, one of the best muffin recipes I have made. It is moist, tender and sweet, but not too sweet.  The generous amount of pumpkin pie spice gives the muffins extra yumminess!

This is super easy to make and absolutely delicious and moist.  The topping was so easy and yummy.  They looked like they came from a bakery with the taste you can only get from homemade.  I look forward to using this recipe for many occasions in the future.

Good recipe, followed the others & doubled the streusel topping.  I have a kiddo with a peanut/tree nut allergy so no nuts for us.  I have made this recipe a few times & they always go over well.

I made these muffins for our church coffee hour.  They were so moist and delicious -- everybody loved them and wanted the recipe.  Since I was making them for a crowd I used mini muffin/tart pans and the recipe was enough for 60 muffins and baked them for 12 -1 3 minutes.  I kept the recipe the mostly same but tripled the amount of streusel so that each muffin had plenty of topping. I also used most of the 15 oz can of pumpkin instead of just 1 1/2 cups.  I will definitely make these again.

To make it healthier, I halved the brown sugar and white sugar,  used 1/4 cup of oil and  whole wheat flour instead of all purpose. I doubled the applesauce and skipped the streusel topping altogether. They turned out great! A definite make again! Tastes like it would be excellent with shredded carrots in the batter too.

I did not have applesauce on hand so just used a little extra oil--approx 1/4 cup. I figured since you can substitute applesauce for oil in other recipes that would work.. and it did.  I also quadrupled the streusel topping because we like a LOT of topping on them --they were delish!!  I will definitely be making these again!

These came out really well. I had a partial can of pumpkin. Next time will use a full can aND make 24 muffins as others did. Used 2.5 tsp cinnamon, .5 nutmeg, .25 tsp of cloves, all spice and ginger rather then pumpkin spice.

Swapped the all purpose flour for whole wheat and the raisins for dried cranberries and upped those to 3/4-1 cup as a 1/4 c wasn't enough and left out the streusel and topped with cream cheese frosting instead. These were really good, I would make them again.

These were fabulous!  I used chocolate chips in place of raisins.  I also used whole wheat pastry flour.  I used the streusel topping , but might leave it off next time...they didn't need it.  This recipe does make at least 2 dozen regular sized muffins.

These were excellent! The only thing I changed was to double the streusel topping as per other reviews. This made 2 dozen muffins for me with the streusel covering each one.

I absolutely love these muffins! I didn't add the raisins, as I'm not a fan of them. I will definately make them again and again this time of year, for sure. I might add some pecans to the streusel next time, because love them.  Thank you for this recipe!

These were some of the best muffins I've ever had! I did alter the recipe a bit to make some healthier substitutions. I changed the all-purpose flour to 1 1/4 cups whole wheat flour, the eggs to 3 flax eggs, and a 1/2 cup of raisins. As for the streusel topping, I doubled the flour and oats to make it more crumbly. They turned out perfect.

I made a few healthy substitutions and these are the BEST pumpkins muffins!!!  In place of white flour I used 11/2 cups of whole wheat flour and 1 cup of almond meal.  I added 1/2  cup ground flax seed.  In place of the white sugar I used a cup of organic applesauce (so 11/2 cups total applesauce as the recipe already called for 1/2 c......NO white sugar).  I used organic coconut oil in place of vegetable oil.  And I added a teaspoon of cinnamon.   DELICIOUS and healthy!  I did double the streusel and it was plenty!

Added extra spice (left out the pumpkin pie spice). And next time I would add a bit of oil.  I' am not satisfied with the texture without a bit of healthy oil.  They are good and I need healthy, good-tasting muffins.

I followed the recipe exactly and I could not be any happier on the turnout.  They were fabulous. Everyone loved them and I will definitely be making them again.  I did not have a problem with the amount of muffins or not enough streusel topping as one or two the other reviewers.

Doubled the streusel topping and omitted raisins, but otherwise made per instructions. These were fabulous!

5 stars because the flavour is excellent. I would take away a star because the streusel, as written, is hard to work with. It makes a lump in the middle and then the butter melts and spreads all over - the muffins, but mostly the pan. But the flavour is so darn good that I'll keep it at 5 stars. The only modification I made to the recipe was the pumpkin pie spice. I don't buy it so I used (in approximate amounts) 2tsp cinnamon, 3/4tsp each nutmeg and ginger, 1/2tsp allspice and 1/8tsp clove.

Didn't taste like pumpkin as much as I would have hoped. The muffin had the consistency of a pumpkin loaf/bread instead of a muffin. I won't be making this recipe again because it lacked flavor.

I got this recipe mixed up with another and added 2 cups of finely chopped apples. I always use half the sugar in all sweets also.  They turned out great!

Very good. Didn't have enough brown sugar to make topping. Not too sweet. Perfect for breakfast with coffee or tea.

Delicious. These are the very best muffins I've ever made. The recipe is devine as is, but I have also added cream cheese filling (wow!) and sometimes I use 1/2 whole wheat flour. They freeze really well.

I tried to follow this recipe exactly, but didn't have everything on hand so had to make a few slight changes.  Overall, these muffins are amazing! Sweet enough, with a nice crunch from the streusel topping, and a nice mix of light and airy with the denseness of a muffin. This made enough batter to make 1 dozen large muffins and 3.5 dozen small muffins.  I tripled the streusel topping to have just enough to cover each muffin with about half/1 tablespoon of it. I cooked the small muffins 2 pans at a time for 15 minutes exactly, and the large muffins for 20 minutes at 350 degrees, they came out perfectly done.  I used 2 c of pumpkin puree (to finish off the container), and I used 2tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp allspice, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and a sprinkle of cloves.  If I were to make this recipe again, i would reduce the amount of oil from 2/3 cups to maybe only 1/2 cup or a bit less (it wasnt necessary to have all the oil, i think they would be tender enough without it), and I would up the amount of spice by a tsp. 
I made a streusel topping the way i usually do, which is to cut cold butter into the flour/brown sugar mixture, and I sprinkled it on top.  I added cinnamon and pepitas to my streusel topping.  I didn't have raisins on hand, so omitted those.  i will definitely make these again.

This recipe makes lots of muffins.i made a dozen regular size muffins and 24 mini muffins. I made my own applesauce ( one chopped apple and added the raisins to soften them. Ran out of all purpose , so last half cup was self-rising flour.No pumpkin pie spice ,so I used allspice, cardamom and ground ginger and homemade vanilla. And included 1/2 cup ground flax seed. Added chopped pecans to the streusel topping. 
The resulting muffins were light,moist,with burst of Apple, chewy raisins and crunchy topping!!

Fantastic. I didn't use vegetable oil but I used coconut oil as well as whole wheat flour instead of all purpose (2cups instead of 2.5 due to the heaviness of w.w. Flour).

Nice easy muffin recipe, but it does make alot. I chose to make mini muffins as I was making them for a business meeting and people are more apt to pick up a little muffin. They loved them and even packed some to go. I used a whole can of pumpkin as others suggested and doubled the topping. No other changes were made. The mini muffins took 18-20 minutes to cook.

I made the base as written, including the raisins, but instead of the streusel topping, I added a small dab of neufchatel cheese and some walnuts on top.  It was a great way to use up the leftover cheese and when right out of the oven, it oozed into the warm muffin.  While I'm sure adding sugar to the cheese as others have done is also tasty, the muffin is sweet enough without it.

After following the directions, the recipe yielded two full dozens.  Also, the time was a bit off.  The muffins were done in less time, but since I followed the recipe, as 25 minutes as the base point, I'm not sure when they would have been sufficiently baked.
