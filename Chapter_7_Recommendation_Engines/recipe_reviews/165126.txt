Really good with the following changes:  Reduce cereal to 2 cups and add 1 packet RANCH DRESSING MIX to boost up the flavor.  I used 2 tsp Italian Seasoning blend and a dry 4-cheese blend.  This amount covered 4 large breasts.  Be sure to serve it with a moist side dish like Fettuccine or any other noodle with a light sauce and a veggie of your choice.  An easy weeknight meal and good to serve to company.  Lots of flavor with the changes!  Went down well with a Pinot Grigio.  Enjoy!

this was really good!  it didn't take too long, not hard to make at all.  i followed the recipe exactly and everyone liked it.  i was a little nervous about the rice krispies because it seemed a little weird to put them with chicken.. but it worked well!

Tasted good, like stuffing, & the family liked it. But whatever I did wrong made the coating come out very lumpy & it was messy to work with. Also it took a long time to prepare.

This recipe doesn't seem like it would be bland, but it is, as well as a bit dry.  There is no wow factor.  It looks nice, smells good and tastes okay.  If you already have these ingredients on hand then I would say make this dish but I wouldn't recommend spending any extra money to make it.

A great & healthier alternative to fried chicken! I use seasoned flour instead of plain and it jazzes up the flavor a bit.

This was a great recipe. My daughter said it was the best chicken she has ever had. I made a few little changes, but that was because I didn't have the rice krispies and I am a Wisconsinite who loves cheese. Basically since I didn't have the right type of cereal I used crushed corn flakes, and instead of the alloted amount of cheese, I added an extra 1/3 cup. This was a really good recipe and I plan on making it again. The cheese was not overpowering, and it may just be my taste buds, but I almost tasted a hint of coconut flavor. Not sure where that came from, because it was probably just me, but I loved it. Thanks for posting the recipe.

Delicious, easy chicken recipe -- and my 11 year old loved it b/c I let him crush the rice krispies w/ a rolling pin in a big baggie!
