This is a Great alternative to the everyday pot roast.  It was a breeze to make.  While it called for grilling I did make it in the oven instead and it turned out great that way.

I was a little leary about adding 1/3 cup of pepper, but I went for it. Served it to my mom, dad and new husband.  The roast was fantastic.  A wonderful outer crust but tender and juicy inside. Will definitely make this again.

This roast is scrumptious!  I added red potatoes to the pan, and they came out wonderful!

I marinated this overnight using a square cut rump. I came to realize that while it did leave a nice crust on the meat , it did not make it tender. I cooked it on the grill and probably should have pulled it at 140 and let it sit before cutting.

This was AWESOME! But instead of lamb, I used ground beef, because I already had it. Tasted fantastic. Once the meat and seasonings were simmering, I added a little more tomato paste for moisture. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Boyfriend wants it again so it MUST be great. :)
