I have made shortbread time and time and time again.  With this recipie, I have never had so much trouble.  It would not roll out at all - I tried, it crumbled.  Picked it back up, and it crumbled yet again.  I even had someone else give this recipie a try and they had the same trouble.  I will not make this again.

I wish I had read the reviews first!  I had the "crumbling" problem as well.  It would not roll out.  I ended up just rolling small balls by hand, flattened them slightly and baked them that way.  They are ok.  Not the yummy shortbread I was hoping for!  Oh well.

This recipe was not the best recipe ever. The taste was okay, I guess. But the dough continued to crumble. I didn't care for this recipe.

These turned out pretty well for me.  The dough was crumbly at first, but if you work it a bit it gets easy to roll out.  The chocolate dough was much stickier than the plain dough, though - I think I would use a little less shaved chocolate and possibly more cocoa.  All in all they turned out pretty well.

Is lot of comments said that the dough crumbles a lot, and I had the same problem at first, but you can use the heat from your hands to melt the butter and it becomes more like a dough. It rolled out quite nicely after I played with the dough for a while. My only complaint is that it tasted a little too much like flour for my liking, but that can easily be fixed. :)
