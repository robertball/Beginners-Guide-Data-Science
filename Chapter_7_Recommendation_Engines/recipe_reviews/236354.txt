I made this soup twice and really like it, it is a quick and easy soup and makes plenty for left over’s. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe to the T. The second time, I added a chopped medium onion and used hot Italian sausage, came out great. Definitely follow the directions on cooking the gluten free pasta. The recipe calls for a 12 oz package of gluten free elbow mac, by mistake I picked up an 8 oz package from the store ( Barilla gluten free mac was not available in my store) and it turns out, this was plenty of macaroni in the soup for me. Definitely a keeper recipe!

Not terrible but way too bland for my taste. Next time I'll definitely saute an onion and garlic with the mushrooms. It also really needs additional seasoning than just salt and pepper. Upon tasting it I added marjoram and oregano which helped but it needed the onion and garlic and it was too late for that.

Liked how easy this was to make. A simple & tasty comfort food. As others have recommended; I agree sautéing an onion and adding herbs. My husband is not a soup kind of guy- but intentionally asked me to save this recipe! It's a keeper!

Gluten free elbows were not found in 2 of my local stores but gluten is not an issue with me so shells it was. I understand that boiling the sausage gives it the firmness to slice it but I have done that in the past in soups and ended up with spongy sausage so I chose to cut the sausage out of the casing, roll it into mini meatballs, and brown them in the skillet until I rendered enough fat to saute my mushrooms in. How can it get any easier than throwing the pasta in to boil for 4 minutes and then turning the stove off and letting it sit for 10 minutes?? Add some extra herbs/seasoning,top with parm, and you have yourself a winner here. Barilla beats all in the pasta world!

Great recipe!  Instead of mushrooms, I added baby spinach during the 10 minute wait at the end. I had the golden tomatoes already so I used that instead.  Added about 2 teaspoons of oregano too.  I'm thinking maybe another can of beans would have been good too!  Used the whole box of 1 lb cellentani pasta because I didn't want to store a small amount in my pantry. Got to try! Definitely sauté the garlic and rosemary in olive oil for flavor.  Oh! And sprinkle parmasian cheese in the bowl before serving! A keeper!  Sent my pics.   Hope they post it!

I used hot italian sausage for a little extra zing and added another can of beans per suggestion by another reviewer. Also added a little extra seasoning as some reviewers said it was bland. I was going to try adding some spinach as another reviewer did, but forgot to buy it while I was at the store. I think it would add to the health value and color factor. I was unable to fing the gluten-free elbows, so used some extra fiber shells. Over all this was good; I still felt like it was missing a little something.

This soup is so hearty and comforting! I would use low-sodium stock as you can always add salt but can't remove it! Sausage can also be left out but I thought it was a great addition.

I made this recipe last night and was disappointed in the results. there were too many ingredients and the flavors did not marry well and took more time to prepare than was indicated.

Earthy, hearty, and definitely comforting! My only changes to the recipe/instructions: I used sliced white and baby bella mushrooms, I used garlic infused EVOO and no fresh garlic (makes me sick), and I added extra dried crushed rosemary and fennel seed to the sauté. DO NOT SKIP THE GARNISH! Fresh out of the pot, my impression was “meh” - adding s&p + the olive oil and fresh chopped parsley took it up to “omgggg yummmm ??”.
