These were teriffic tasting.  I tried very hard to make them a little healthier and lower calorie.  I made the following substitutions with great success: 3/4 c. spleda for the 1 c. of white sugar, EggBeaters for the eggs, low fat sour cream, reduced from 16 tablespoons of butter to 14 and used half real butter & half light butter.  Even then, when you cut them into 24 squares (which I think is a better serving size than 30 squares), they are still pretty high calorie.  Next time I'll probably cut the crust/crumble mix down by a 1/4 and use less crumble on top.  I did say next time, because these are so tasty I will have to make them again.

As another reviewer said, its a little sweet; next time I will cut both sugars to 3/4 and the flour to 1 1/4.  I did add extra cinnamon to the filling, it wasn't enough so next time I'll add some to the crust.  Mine also took a lot longer than 20 min, more like 30+.

Wow! What more can I say?  I loved this and my family raved about it.  It's not too sweet and the 'crumble' was just right.  I'm going to try this using a date filling in the next one. Refrigerate it before cutting and you will get nice clean squares. I have added this to my 'Mom's Recipe Book' and it will be passed on to my daughters and daughter in law's.  Thanks for sharing.

Delish!  And Easy!  I found this recipe in an attempt to use up some sour cream and raisins I had on hand, and I'm not disappointed.  As other reviewers suggested, I cut down to just 3/4 cup of sugar and 1 1/2 cup of flour to cut "too much" sweetness.  I also added an extra sprinkle or 2 of cinnamon to both the filling and the crust.  Will definitely make again!  Bon Appetit!

As I am typing this, I just finished eating a bar of my 2nd batch. Yes, 2nd. I made my first batch yesterday and it was marvelous. Today, I made my 2nd batch using all healthy ingredients just to see if there is a difference. I used whole wheat flour, egg substitute, fat-free sour cream, light margerine and Splenda. And guess what?? It is still marvelous. Now I can enjoy these bars without all the guilt! Thanks for the recipe.

Fabulous...stupendous! My family loved this dessert. I used dried cranberries instead of raisins because we don't like raisins, but this dish was to die for. Bravo to the chef.

Everyone asks for the recipe--it's good for using up raisins that are "less than moist."

These were excellent!  I thought the recipe was a bit unclear as to how long the raisin/egg mixture was supposed to cook, and didn't see how a mere 20 minutes would be long enough to cook the eggs, so I cooked it slowly over medium heat until it was thickened.  I then had to carefully smooth it over the crumb crust (being careful not to dislodge the crumbs int he process).  I baked it for the usual time.  I'll definitely be making these again because my family was upset there weren't any leftovers from the church function I took them to!

I really liked these.  They were great right out of the freezer.  I would like to try with about 3/4 fo the amount of sugar though.  I think these would also be wonderful with strawberries substituted for the raisins.  YUM!!

Was trying to find something new to bring for a church fundraiser and hit the jackpot with this recipe.  My family liked them so much, I bought more ingredients to make another batch.  Thanks!

I added cinnamon to the crust as well and about a half cup more raisins...only because my container was just about empty.

I have never underestimated a recipe as much as I did this one...it was amazing!  I was intrigued by the concept, so I knew I had to try to make it, but I never guessed it would actually be so yummy.  My bars didn't come out in three distinct layers (they were more blended), but I thought they were perfect just the same.  I'm going to give them out at Christmas gifts and I'm sure they'll be a huge hit; thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I thought this was a great recipe, although a little too sweet for us.  I halved the recipe (8x8 pan), using two eggs in the filling.  Instead of softening the butter, I just put the flour, brown sugar & butter in a food processor, mixed until combined, then added the soda, salt & oats.  Came out great.  I would reduce the amount of sugar next time, as my family doesn't like overly sweet desserts.

YummmO ~ I can't say enough about this recipe.  I added a drizzle of cream cheese frosting that went sooooo well with the sourcream raisin center.  They should be called invisible bars, cos they disappear like magic!   I agree with some of the other users that it is a bit too sweet & cutting back the sugar by a third helped a lot.  Next time i think I'll reduce it by half, just for my own taste.  They froze beautifully and were just as yummy.  I'm thinking date bars would be great with this recipe, but any filling would work well.

Yummy!  Great way to use up a large amount of raisins or leftover sour cream.  I only had one cup of sour cream and it still worked great.  The directions don't really tell you what to do with the filling but you need to cook over medium heat for about 10 min, stirring constantly so as not to scramble the eggs.  When it's thick, remove from heat.
Also, to make it easier to cut and serve, it's best to use about 2/3 of the crumbs on the bottom and the remaining 1/3 over the top.
Yummy, old-fashioned recipe that is still good today.

These are a great idea. I think I should have doubled the filling though. Either that or put more crust on the bottom and a really thin layer on the top. I used whole wheat pastry flour instead, cut down the sugars to 3/4c and baked it for 30min like the other reviews suggested. I used golden raisins. It came out fine and I chilled it in the fridge for a few hours, which is a really good idea to make the filling firm up as others suggested. The bars weren't too sweet at all. I didn't have corn starch, so I just used more flour and it was fine. Cream cheese would be good with them and they'd be good with dates instead of raisins too. Overall pretty good. And they freeze great too!

So sorry - I see the potential for this recipe, but as it stands I can't give it more than a '2'.  If you enjoy grabbing a cup of sugar and pouring it into your mouth, then go for it ... seriously, I *like* sweet things, but there's a point where you have to stop and this goes beyond that limit.
Again, great potential and could be fun to tweak, but nope ... not for me.

I baked these for my father because he likes Raisin Sour Cream Pie.  When he tasted them he said "these taste just like Raisin Sour Cream Pie."  I did cook the filling until it thickened and reached the boiling point before spreading on the crust and baking.

Yum!  These bars make a nice dessert, with the only problem being I ate too many of them.  Used light sour cream with no problem.  Super easy!

Fantastic! Used to love these bars as a child, & could not find recipe until found here. Try Serving warm, or reheating, with some vanilla ice cream over top. It's to die for. Always a big hit with everyone who tries!!!

I URGE raisin lovers to try these bars. They are quick and easy and the filling is delicious. They keep 4-5 days in the fridge covered with plastic wrap just fine (I know this because I accidently forgot to pack them on a weekend away:) ) They are great with coffee or just as a snack. Thanks Prudence!

This recipe was addictive.  We couldn't seem to eat just one or two.  Not too sweet.  I added a little extra cinnamon as we like it so well.

I have been wanting to make this for a long time and finally did last night.  I soooo wish I had read the reviews first, however.  I baked them for the 20 minutes the recipe calls for, then left them out overnight to cool. This morning when I went to serve them to my employees at work, it was nothing but raw mush.  Great-smelling, but raw. Considering it had eggs in it, we thought it best not to chance it.  Next time I'll definitely bake it for the 35-40 minutes others suggested.  And I definitely will make it again; smelled too amazing not to!

I was looking for a raisin bar recipe like my grandmothers, came across this one and thought I'd give it a try.  It is excellent and I will definitely make it again.  I used some of the suggestions from other reviewers and the next time I make these I think this will be the perfect mix:  use the full cup of brown sugar, 1 1/4 cups flour, 3/4 cup white sugar and 2 1/2 cups raisins (it definitely needed more than 2 cups).  Bake at 350 for 35 mins.  Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!

Very good!  I'd give them about an 8.5.  They also freeze well

This surpassed my expectations - I was just trying to use up an excess of sour cream! It was unclear how hot the mixture should get on the stove, so I just heated it a little until well mixed, and I allowed it to bake for 30 minutes, turned out perfect. I don't like over sweet, and this was the perfect sweetness in my opinion.

Granted they are wonderful but just too sweet for us.    Cutting back sugar by 1/2 is fine and could see no appreciable change in the quality of the recipe.

These are so good.  I gave one to my Dad to try and he REALLY liked them.  This recipe is a keeper.  The only change I had to make was the amount of time left in the oven.  I had to cook for 45 min.

I had too much sour cream around and was looking for a recipe that used a good bit. I found this one and was only vaguely optimistic that it would be good but it it WONDERFUL just as it is but definitely increase bake time to 30 minutes.

YUMMMMMY!  I followed this recipe to the letter however I made a personal substitution: I used Craisins (dried cranberries) instead of raisins.  Just my personal preference.   These were so amazing.  I also let them cook about 30 mins instead of 20 mins so the topping was a bit more crispy.  I have passed this recipe on to all my friends - we're hooked!

I thought this recipe was very good, but I don't know if I understood it or not.  I cooked them over low heat until they were hot, but I don't know if I cooked it long enough.  I would like to know if I would have to use a candy themometer or if I am just not understanding the recipe.  I cooked them for about 30 minutes, but I'm not sure the texture was right.

Tasty.  Maybe a little cinnamon or nutmeg to the crust would give it a little more oomph.  :)

These are pretty good.  Would be just fine served as a dessert.  The baking dish I used was smaller than 9"x13".  I think 9"x13" is too big; the layers would be so thin.  As far as the cooking time, 20 minutes was enough for me because I didn't eat any right away.  After chilling it in the fridge, it was sturdy enough.

My husband loves sour cream raisin pie, and I thought this might be an easier alternative for summer enjoyment!  I added 1/2 t. of nutmeg, as that's what is in his mother's pie recipe in addition to the cinnamon.  I also replaced 1/2 cup of the flour with whole wheat flour. I might suggest baking the bottom layer for a few minutes before pouring on the cooked mixture and adding the topping.  I do this with another oatmeal bar recipe I make - and it gives it a bit firmer bottom.  This recipe also seemed a bit dense at first - but it seemed to lighten after a day or two!  Will definitely make again.

Very easy. We really liked the taste of the filling in these bars. Very nice looking when they're cut up and served. I did have to bake for a full 21 minutes after the time given of 20 minutes. Also I had to use fat free sour cream because its what I had and they still were delish.

I will definitely be making these again.  This recipe is extremely forgiving, and still works well with many tweaks!  I had just under 1/2C sour cream to use up so I thought I'd try this recipe.  I cut everything into 1/3 (oddly enough), and it all seemed to work out well.  Even though I didn't have the full 1/2C of sour cream, the filling was delicious.  I used lower sugar craisins instead of raisins, and lowered other ingredients based on other reviewers (1/4C sugar, 1/4C brown sugar, and 1/2C of flour).  It would have needed 1/3 tsp of ground cinnamon, but from other reviews, I decided to increase it to 1/2 tsp.  I cooked it on the stove for about 10 minutes until it thickened.  My small sample of this recipe fit into the bottom of a glass bread pan perfectly.  20 minutes didn't seem like enough.  I did 25 minutes and I think it still could have gone longer if you wanted a bit more of a crunch.  Now that I know how great this recipe is, I'll be making it again, and hopefully the full recipe this time!

this recipe is amazing and all the other suggestions of alternative fillings are excellent!!  Ooo, apricots!!  One suggestion tho, I blended the sour cream and eggs together in the food processor before adding them to the pan mixture to avoid eggs becoming cooked eggs instead of a mixture.  worked beautifully.  There will be many batches of this one!!

I liked the bars. The instructions were easy to follow. I may use a tad less sugar next time.

I want more filling though and not sure how to go about this. Cook less,or add an egg, less corn starch without doubling it and adding more sugar.

This bar is absolutely fabulous.  I made it with craisins and added 1 tsp of almond extract, 1-2 tsp lime juice and 1-2 tsp grated lime rind to the craisin mix once it was cooked and cooled.  I also added some cinnamon to the oatmeal mix.  thanks for a marvelous recipe.

Wonderful!!! I had sour cream and raisins that needed used so stumbled upon this recipe. I did take the advice from the other reviewers and only used 3/4 cup sugar, 1 1/2 cup flour and added extra cinnamon to both the filling and crust parts. This is a keeper!

20 minutes, 30 minutes, heck, just cut to the chase and eat the dough.  Either way, it's going to taste like sugar, butter, raisins and cinnamon.  Don't bother with this recipe.  If you want an oatmeal cookie, make an oatmeal cookie.

I felt as though i should have cooked the raisin-sour cream mixture longer so that it would set better, but the flavour was amazing. I added some rum to the filling and it was excellent

I was a little concerned that they were so mushy.  However, everyone just raved about how good they were.  They were a big hit at my office.  Some said it was their new favorite.

I agree that the cooking time for this should be 30 minutes.

this was ok, nothing too special.
i cooked it for 30minutes and it was very wobbly when it came out of the oven. if you let it sit in the fridge it firms up nicely.

I just made these and they are wonderful.  The only thing I changed was that I cooked them 30 minutes instead of 20.  They just are too mushy and almost raw-like with the 20 mins. 30 was perfect. They are great! Filling too.

i just made this recipe and it seems like the 20 min cooking time just isn'e enough. they seem all mushy in the centre as if they are raw. All I can taste is baking soda. Maybe I should put them back in the oven for another 15 min or so. But the taste isn't anything to write home about either. The bars on the outside were a better consistancy, but they were bland and had very little taste to them. I wouldn't bother making this recipe again.

These were really good.  I too, cut back on the sugar, but thought that made them more like a granola bar and less like a desert.  However, they would be better as a granola bar if they had more fiber (I added a cup of walnuts to the filling)  So I think I'll keep the full amount of sugar next time and eat/serve them as desert.  Very tasty and moist.  Even my kids liked them.

Wow! So easy and with all the ingredients I had on hand. I sent these with my husband to work for 'the boys' and they all raved about them. They've requested another pan this week. The funny thing is that he said they all stood around with their coffee and a bar trying to guess the filling. Excellent...a definate keeper. Thanks!
