I've made these meatballs a couple of times. They are delicious with spaghetti and make a dynamite meatball sub! I used Quaker Old Fashioned Oats since that's the kind I had, and I used Panko bread crumbs. The video instructions say to cool the mushroom mixture after adding the oats. The written instructions above omits that step. I followed the video instructions and let the mixture cool to room temperature before adding the cheese and remaining ingredients.

Color me impressed! I was skeptical that these could be as good as the real deal, but I stand corrected. If the mushrooms are chopped finely in the food processor, even the texture is darned close. I suggest processing the mushrooms rather than trying to chop finely enough by hand, which is tedious work. I processed a half pound at a time, and in under 10 seconds of pulsing, they were nice and fine. After making according to the recipe exactly the first time, I made only one small change going forward. Since the object is to try to closely simulate a real meatball in flavor as well as texture, I started with the onion. Instead of adding it to the browned mushrooms, I began by carmelizing the onion in the olive oil. Then I proceeded with the recipe as written. This lends one more layer of meaty flavor and gives a nuanced complexity. I'll definitely make spaghetti and these puppies on Lenten Fridays, as well as "meatball" subs. If they come apart when added to the sauce, it's because the mushrooms were not cooked long enough before adding the rest of the ingredients. Cook until dry. Allowing a minimum of one hour for them to simmer in the sauce is necessary for the taste to meld and develop appropriately. The only way anyone would know they're a vegetarian alternative is the appearance, as real meatballs do not tend to be that dark on the inside. One other note, this recipe always yields 24 for me, (using a 2 Tb scoop) not 16, a fact that doesn't bother us at all!

If I could rate this on taste alone it would get a 5!  These are great and the texture is amazing.  I also like the colour mix in it.
However these didn't hold together very well for me and I needed to cook them for an extra 5-6 mins in the oven to ensure that they didn't fall apart when I was cooking them in the pasta sauce.  Chop everything very finely and add extra breadcrumbs if neeeded.

Yummy! I have tried store-bought phony meatballs & have never found one I liked. These are really good.  They were time consuming to make, but I made a double batch, so that did take more time.  I urge you to watch the video before attempting this recipe because Chef John is not only cool & has an awesome voice, he also has great tips for making the best meatballs.  I chopped my mushrooms, as he said, to about the size of a kernel of corn, but wish I would have made them a tad smaller.  I sautéed my onions separately only because I was feeding anti-onion eaters.  I also used half eggs & half egg substitute made out of flax meal and water.  This recipe is a keeper!

I made these for my dad for Father's Day. I used the food processor to get the mushrooms and onions nice and small; glad I did. It was amazing how much this recipe actually looks like meat. I used a small ice cream scoop just like I do for meatbalIs. I only refriderated a couple of hours and i am curious how much better they would be refrigerated overnight. I must confess dad did not get the full serving of  meatless-meatballs because It was so good before I even put it in the refrigerator (had to sample) and then amazing after it was cooked ( had to sample). I will make this again and turn my vegetarian friends onto it. Thanks once again Chef John.

I love mushrooms.  My husband and son do not share this view with me.  While I was making the recipe my son came up and said "I am NOT going to like that!"  He ended up eating most of the meatballs. My husband loved the recipe and is now making them again tonight (4 days later). Great recipe, thanks for helping to turn my family into mushroom believers!

#1: Delicious! Stayed together like a real meatball with a firm outside(be sure you flip often in the oven to crisp up all the sides) and melt-in-your mouth center. 
I used a small cookie scoop to get uniform balls.
#2: Easy to make vegan! Replace eggs with a flax meal eggs, replace butter with a reduced amount of coconut oil, be sure the bread crumbs are vegan, and replace cheese with a sprinkle of nutritional yeast. 1/4 of the recipe(4-5 medium balls), veganized and without sauce, only 185 calories!

This is the best meat free recipe i have found! i used baby bellas, gruyere cheese and egg beaters. Next time i will veganize it with vegan parm and a flax egg. i served it with red gravy for sandwiches and also made a glaze of angry orchard hard cider, organic blackstrap molasses, soy and pink peppercorns. both were excellent!

Okay, I read this recipe and watched the video and my immediate thought was  . . . ya right!   I don't believe it. . . but I just had to try and it.  And I was blown away.  They turned out fantastic.  You really can't believe that these are not made with lean ground beef.    I'm just making them now a second time.  They will be a favourite in my family for a long time.  The only thing I changed in the recipe is I used 1 egg and egg white for the second egg.  Mostly because I only had one egg in the fridge. But the egg white will make it even healthier.  I'll just have to see if they mixture rolls into balls tomorrow after resting in the fridge overnight.

I made this recipe for the first time the other day and it turned out excellent.  I've been following a low GI diet plan, so this recipe was perfect for dinner.  I did only use one egg and they held together just fine.  I loved them.  I plan on making them again and again.

Love this recipe! I'm making it again for xmas dinner. This time I substituted half the mushrooms for lentils to boost up the protein content and the flavor came out just as nice. It's a wonderful vegetarian option to add to the Italian dinner table.

I made this with a white sauce and thick rotini, and it was amazing. My boyfriend even loved it and he's a difficult to please carnivore. I didn't have onions in the house, so I used leeks instead and it turned out well. I didn't have time to let it refrigerate for too long either, but they held together perfectly. Can't wait to try this with spaghetti! I'm going to make a bushel of these and keep them in my freezer for all my meatless needs.

These mushroom balls are amazingly delicious with an awesome biting texture.  I also super love that it is all made by hand--no food processor needed!  I've made this recipe several times and even turned it into a mushroom loaf that was yummy and sliceable for sandwiches.  I've tweaked it now and made it with an Asian flair minced bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, onion, ginger, garlic, soy sauce, sesame oil, and a dash of sweet chili sauces.  It's in the fridge still but I'm looking forward to them on my rice noodles tomorrow.

Followed the recipe exactly and these came out great. It really does end up looking like meat. My non-vegetarian husband and brother really liked them too. Only thing I would change is cooking them a bit longer in the oven to get more crispy on the outside but that's just my preference. Will definitely make this again.

These are amazing.  I didn't use nearly 1oz of parmesan cheese, but they were still fantastic.  I'm not sure why there is a review that someone's were falling apart.  I imagine they didn't cook the mushrooms down enough if they had to add more breadcrumbs.  The texture was perfect.  My 5 year old son devoured his and raved about them.  They are very comparable to the Nate's veggie meatballs that are ridiculously expensive for what they are.  These are in permanent rotation.  I'm going to try making a very large batch and freezing the balls before cooking them.

One of my favorite recipes. I've made it several times, and it always satisfies that spaghetti-and-meatball craving my husband and I get as vegetarians. Word to the wise - don't make them too big, or they will not cook all the way through or hold together well! Small means small; I learned that the hard way, haha. :) Otherwise, the mushrooms' meaty flavor could fool almost anyone.

My husband said if he didn't watch me make these he would think they were made with meat. And my Vegetarian friend immediately asked for the recipe. They don't take any more time than meat balls. I cooked them in my toaster oven for 10 minutes, turned them and cooked them for 10 more minutes. They were crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, delicious.

I made this last night and it did not disappoint!  I put the mushrooms and onion in the food processor so they were really finely chopped and it held together just like a regular meatball.  I didn't read ahead about refrigerating for 4 hours so mine just stayed in for about 2 hours and it was fine. I did have to cook a little longer than the recommended time, probably about 20 minutes and they could have used another 5 to be nice and crispy,  which is how i like my meatballs. Definitely a delicious meatless option that I will be making again!

OMG these are soooo good. I have never made vegetarian meatballs before and I am so glad i used this recipe for my first go. My meat-eating family agreed these were so good you didnt even miss the meat. For this particular recipe, i do recommend watching the video before making them. It helped me know how long to cook everything and what to expect. I will absolutely make these again

When we stopped eating meat, one of the things that we missed the most was our turkey meatballs.  These were absolutely delicious and we can once again enjoy a meatball sub!! Usually not a fan of "meatless" recipes, but these were great, both the texture and the flavor!

I'm still looking for the calories per meatball.  Wish recipes would give the calories for the entire recipe and when I make 20 or 25 meatballs, then I can figure each one.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I made smaller meatballs and it still took 15 minutes.  Easier if you use a non stick surface to bake.

This recipe is a true keeper! Very tasty and delicious! I used portobello mushrooms and mozzarella cheese instead of the parmesan and button mushrooms. I also made my own homemade bread crumbs too and marinated overnight. Die hard Meat lovers would be extremely surprised to find out that something so appetizing actually be made without meat! Will definitely be making this again and again.

Delish! Both me and my carnivore husband loved them as sliders. Prep takes a bit of time, though, so next time I'm going to make a bigger batch to freeze.

Made this for my veggie brother. Really straight forward. The time consuming part is the resting in the fridge. I made night before so spent lots of time in fridge to really firm up. Used mini food processor for onions and mushrooms. Also sweated the mushrooms in jalapeño infused garlic olive oil to start. Flavour was awesome and the texture lovely and firm. Definitely a recipe for my 'Go To' section for any veggie guests in the future.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  I strayed from the original recipe by using baby bella mushrooms, leaving the mixture in the fridge 48 hours (forgot we had dinner plans the day I was originally going to make them), and adding two pinches of cayenne pepper.  Absolutely delicious!

This recipe was fantastic.  I kept having doubts about a few things as I progressed through the process of making these little gems. I wanted to "add my own touches" but decided to do it just as Chef John did in the video.  It's VERY important to watch the video before making these as a few very important pointers are not listed in the written recipe.  This is a keeper and will replace "meat" meatballs at least half the time we have a meatball dish.  Great way to cut back on red meat!!!  Thank you John.

Made these for my vegetarian and carnivore family.  Everyone loved them.  Us being us, I had to add extra cayenne but the flavor and texture were perfect.  Thanks!

Do they take a little time? Sure. Are they worth it? Absolutely. I followed the recipe exactly except for two things: 1 -  I let the food processor do my chopping and 2 - I used baby bellos because they have such a meaty flavor. DH and I love mushrooms, and honestly, if someone had served these to me, I wouldn't have guessed they had no meat at all. They held together beautifully while simmering in the sauce, and the texture was spot on for me. Next time, I'll double the recipe and freeze half. Lovely dish.

This is my fourth time making these meatballs. As a nanny, I try to make delicious  and healthy foods for the family I work for. They are picky eaters, but they love these meatballs. I serve it with fettuccine noodles.

Great taste and texture!  Finely chopping the mushrooms is key, otherwise these come together easily and hold up well in the sauce.

These are easily the BEST TASTING meatballs (meat-free or meat-filled) that I've ever made. I was so surprised at the texture and how well they stayed together. They are just delicious. I did, however, make a few minor changes to the recipe to suit my kitchen. I omitted the cayenne pepper, added about 1/4 c additional cheese (mozzerella/parmesan blend) and a few teaspoons of chickpea flour as I added the last egg because I was a little light on breadcrumbs and also to bulk up the protein and help them stick together a little better. I baked them for about 25 minutes, flipping a few times, let them cool completely and put them into a preheated crockpot filled with tomato sauce on "warm" while I waited for my husband to get home. Truly worth the time and effort, and like everyone else here I will definitely make double- or triple!- batches in the future to freeze!

As usual, a great recipe from Chef John! I was so happy to have good meatless meatballs with our pasta dinner. I used the food processor to chop the mushrooms and everything came together just fine. After baking I put them in a slow cooker of hot tomato sauce and let them cook for a couple of hours. They held together very well. I will make these again  and again. Thank you!

Wow. A great meat free recipe. I omitted the parsley and used cilantro. 
I also used gluten free bread crumbs ( ground up matzo cracker). Well worth the work. 
I also used the same ingredients for an eggplant lasagna. It was awesome. 
A must try.

These were really really good and I am a meat and potatoes kinda guy. I let them sit overnight in fridge as suggested and could not be any happier. Make sure to watch the video first though as the process it described much better.

Usually I have some tweak or caveat for the recipes I rate, but in this case I just followed the recipe as described and ended up with a delicious final product.  I'm going to try to veganize it next-- I don't think it'll be that hard to do.

After reading all the reviews, I plan to process everything finely before mixing together, and possibly adding an extra egg. That way, they should stick together without being refrigerated for too long. I don't consider this to be much work, other than the frig part, which isn't work, it's just too time consuming. My frig is very small.

I'm a huge fan of Chef John, his videos and the recipes of his I've made. This one is good, but I prefer my mushroom taste to be more obvious. They are amazingly "meat-like", and taste good, but are a lot of work & I doubt I'd make them again. I'm glad I tried them, though!

These were fabulous!  I made them a week ago and am making them again tonight.  I did exactly what the recipe said in terms of ingredients and measurements.  It is important to let all of the liquid cook out of the mushrooms and I do let the mix sit overnight in the refrigerator. After I baked them for 15 minutes, I turned them over and baked for another five, turned one more time and baked for five. They held together really well.  Everyone loves these and meateaters can't believe they aren't meat.  I will check out Chef John's other recipes.

Amazing!  My adult kids couldn’t believe  how good they were!  I followed a couple of suggestions in other reviews and did the onion first, used my food processor to chop the mushrooms, made sure to cook mushrooms until all moisture had evaporated and simmered on the stovetop for a full hour.  They were a huge hit!  I will definitely make them again.

While the recipe is great,  the technique is a bit flawed.  You should never salt mushrooms before browning as this lengthens the process. instead I recommend browning without salt and adding later on to taste.

Very good! I used cashew Parmesan, to make this non-dairy and it was great. Next time I’ll try flax eggs to make the whole meal vegan. I also liked the idea of half mushroom half lentil to add some protein. Great recipe.

For the vegans out there, you know your substitutes: ground flax with water instead of eggs, nutritional yeast instead of cheese, etc.

I made this with the substitutes and I really enjoyed the flavor and texture. 

I found that with a little moisture from the cooked mushroom/onion mixture and oatmeal flour (pulsed oats in blender) the starch from the oats acts as it’s own binder without having to use eggs or any other binder. So I omitted the “eggs” and used a little extra oat flour. 
Nutritional yeast (Nooch) acts as a vegan-friendly alternative to cheese. Because nooch are dried flakes, it combined nicely with the semi-moist mixture. 

Overnight in the fridge for me is a must. The spices really work their way into the mixture more profoundly and the texture improves. I prepared these for appetizers at a potluck cooked in a grape jelly/ketchup glaze as a sweet and savory sauce (akin to teriyaki).

Keeping this recipe for sure.

These are basically ground up stuffed mushrooms shaped into a ball and held together by eggs.  They may look like a meatball, but they tasted like stuffed mushrooms, and if that's the flavor you're looking for in your sauce, then make these.  You won' t be disappointed.   If, on the other hand, you are looking for a nice vegetarian meatball substitute, keep looking.

I made these once before and have a batch in the fridge waiting to be cooked, they do take a while to prepare and you should def watch the video.  Did anyone else notice the recipe says 1 pound mushrooms, but the video says a couple of pounds of mushrooms.

I'm hooked!  Was looking for ways to start introducing meatless alternatives to our meat loving family's diet. Everyone here loves mushrooms; but I still have that one 20 something y.o. that would find a problem with making into meatballs. So as far as he was concerned we were having Spaghetti and Meatballs....... He said great ??  No big changes made here. Used a mix of Creminis, Fresh Shitakes, and Whites Processed mushrooms probably a little much.   Ended up almost like canned chopped olive consistency.  Used a little bit extra butter to brown and used Progresso Italian garlic and herb breadcrumbs so cut salt back to 1/2.  Barely got 2hr fridge time. That's it!  Rolled up beautifully, stayed together through simmer and I was fooled. That child....,, just asked if there's leftovers for work. Nope!  lol.   Ps. Added approx.  2oz Parmesan

Followed the recipe exactly other than not sure how much cheese I added. Baked directly on a baking sheet for 15 minutes. They turned out great. One step closer to eating meatless meals. Thank you!

These were really great, delicious. The only adjustment I made was using old fashioned oats, which are thicker than the quick cooking variety. I put them in the blender for a few seconds to try to make them smaller, but that didn't seem to have much effect on them. The recipe is a bit of a time investment by my standards, but well worth it. The three of us ate all of them and everyone loved them. I would mention, though, that I only had the three cups of sauce mentioned in the recipe and needed about a cup and a half more; I had to keep adding water to it as the not-meatballs cooked to keep enough liquid on them.

These meatballs came out quite tasty with good texture. The 4 servings came out to making around 15 medium sized meatballs.

So good! Wish I had doubled the recipe. I used half the amount of mushrooms chopped very fine. I made this gluten free by replacing the breadcrumbs with more oats. Otherwise made as is. They held together perfectly! Next time I will quadruple and freeze for a later date.

Made the meatballs ahead as recipe dictated, and added them to homemade sauce and spaghetti noodles.

5/5, homerun. Thank you for a great vegetarian option to a homemade Italian/American classic Chef John.

My third time making these! The first go I didn't have time to overnight them in the fridge. The first time they formed nicely. The second and now the third, I had problems.  I've discovered that if I start to form the balls right when I take them out of fridge, they crumble and fall apart. Then I discovered that if I let them sit out on the counter and get some of the chill out of them, they form and stick nicely. Next time I think I'll use the food processor rather than hand chop the mushrooms, I think that might help too. Phew, glad I found a solution since I made a double batch! So excited now for Christmas dinner - lasagnas (one meat and one veggie) and these "meatballs" and sauce. YUM!!!

Loves, love,love this recipe. I was looking for an alternative to store bought mock meatballs. These are way better and super easy to make. I did change it slightly. I used my milling blade on the oats and and gave the mushrooms a few spins in the nutribullet. They had a slightly softer texture then meat but the flavor is so amazing.

I would love to try this recipe but I have a question.  My husband does not like Parmesan cheese and can almost always detect even the smallest amount.  Is the cheese used for flavor, texture, or both? And if for texture, is there an acceptable substitute? Thanks!

I've tried this recipe and the meatballs were perfect for my meat -free dinner. I processed finely all ingredients in a food processor and then baked them in a non stick pan (like an hamburger). Delicious! Thanks.

I loved these so much! I made these for dinner on a whim one day. I defiantly just skimmed the recipe before I made these though and already had cooked and mixed everything together BEFORE I saw that says to refrigerate them! 
As I already had the pasta and sauce on, I need to think on my feet. 
I ended up searing them in a cast iron skillet until browned and them just added them to the sauce. 
I was worried about them being too soft and falling apart but they help together and still kept their shape. Even after stiring them around in the sauce. 
I defiantly will refrigerate them next time to see what difference  it makes to the texture. Im just happy I got a thumbs up from my vegetarian boyfriends!

At first, I was skeptical. I made the meatballs. On the first entry into the oven, I was horrified as they didn't seem to be holding together. But after one turnover and then one more, they were a good consistency. Good enough that they have been basting in my tomato sauce over the last hour without crumbling.

 I am literally sitting here shocked that his meatballs are still intact with my chicken meatballs. These take some patience but they work.

PS They are also delicious.

I love these flavorful meatless balls and serve them with red sauce as in the recipe, but also with bbq sauce or in sandwiches.  The chilling is pretty important to helping them stay together.  I use the convection setting to get them nice and brown.  They are a bit of work, so I make double or triple batches and freeze them.

Cooked exactly as written but recommend watching the video....a couple details there not mentioned in the recipe. Whole family approved....even those who "don't like mushrooms". Gonna make a double batch to freeze some next time!! It's a keeper for sure.

This is the second time I've made this. It is truly delicious and tastes like a meatball for sure. This second time, I tried using a food processor as one reviewer suggested. Don't do it. I should know better than to mess with a Chef John recipe. The mushrooms were harder to brown in the pan and they came out a but mushy. Not good. Stick with the directions. This is an excellent recipe just as written. Thanks again Chef John!

These meatballs are fantastic ! I was skeptical at first thinking they would be bland , but quite the opposite- they have a deep rich flavor. The garlic and spice combination is perfection. As so many have said, it is hard to believe they are not ground beef. My kitchen smells just like when I was a kid and my mom would be simmering her Italian meatballs in homemade sauce all day long. So impressed! Followed the recipe exactly using the food processor to get everything nice and small. they formed and held together very nice. Thank you for such an awesome recipe for Meatless Monday !

Good. Great for mushroom lovers. A little moist. May try adding more oats next time.

I made a double batch of these meatballs (only the meatballs) to freeze for when my son and his girlfriend come for Thanksgiving.  They are both pescatarians.  I did eat one to see what they tasted like and it was quite delicious but I am a lover of all things mushroom anyway.  I read the reviews and did as some suggested; I used my food processor to chop up the mushrooms and onions, and also my parmesean cheese was thicker so I pulsed that a few times also.  I didn't have any rolled oats, just quick cooking steel cut oats so I used that.  I did let my mixture sit in the refrigerator overnight hoping it was enough moisture to soften the steel cut oats and it was.  I don't know how much difference (or if) the quick cooking steel cut oats made but what I got was delightful.  I didn't have a cookie scoop so I formed the "meatballs" by hand.  With a double batch I came up with 35 of them so I think I made them pretty much the right size.  I look forward to serving them as spaghetti and "meatballs" and "meatball" sandwiches for my loved ones!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made these and found them very tasty.  They held up well into the sauce.  My husband liked them too.  Now, how would they be as burgers?  I’m going to try that too!

This is a fantastic recipe.  The secret is to allow the mixture to sit over night.  Makes very moist and flavorful meatballs.  I have been making these every week since I found this recipe and the only time they were dry I didn’t soak them long enough.  Thank you!!

I made this exactly as directed and was very disappointed.  The meatballs disintegrated in the pasta sauce.  The taste and texture were totally not to my liking. It did not taste like meat at all.

This would be a 5 if it were just a tad less time-consuming and messy to make, but the meatballs DO taste a lot like meat! Didn’t quite fool the 6 and 7 year old boys, but one of them liked it at least, and like the adults, didn’t mind the absence of meat. I am going to make a double batch to freeze so when time is short, I will be prepared. The only thing I will change is to briefly pulse the oatmeal to make it less noticeable in the finished product. Be prepared with extra sauce, though - the meatballs really sucked it up and I barely had enough left to coat the pasta!
Try them! I’m

I have made these several times and they are loved by everyone. This last time I used a mini chopper instead of cutting all the shrooms. I think it made the sauté times longer because of the finer cut, but they stayed together just fine...even after simmering in the sauce.

Omg so tasty

I used steel cut oats instead of rolled (the recipe doesn't specify) and it was so tasty

Doesn't taste like meat but the texture is very good!

I followed the instructions and when I put the meatballs in the sauce to simmer, they fell apart. The flavor was good so next time, I will heat the sauce, put the hot meatballs on the sandwich and spoon some heated sauce over the meatballs.

Very good-- the whole family liked them.   The kids had them 3 times before I let them in on the secret that they were eating mushrooms (which they claim to hate).  They are a bit laborious so I will probably look for other ways to incorporate this super food into our diets.

I wanted to like it, but the balance of flavors tasted a bit off.  The mushroom flavor was too prominent in the end result for my liking, and the whole process was just too time-consuming to use this recipe on any kind of a regular basis.

I made these exactly as directed. They were ok in my opinion, which is actually high praise as I absolutely detest mushrooms. A little time consuming, but fairly easy to make. Will not be a regular, but I will make them again.

This was great and actually tasted like regular meatballs ... really happy I tried this. 

I added a bit of Italian Vegetable Ground Round (soy ground beef substitute) ... it added to the authenticity of the meatball

I made it exactly as the video shows.  Maybe it was just me, but  I thought it was just ok.  I won't make again.  That doesn't mean that I don't always enjoy Chef John's humor in the videos.  He is a funny guy.  Five stars for the comedy material.

Great, tasty recipe & a nice alternative to "meat" meatballs;  you can barely tell the difference. I find the recipe to be a little time-consuming, so I tend to do the prep in advance.

I made these for my family and a bunch of teenage boys. We have a long history of failed meatball attempts. After a brief debate, we ended up telling them that they were meatless. Nobody would believe us. “There’s no meat in these?” was the most common sentiment. Like many of the other reviewers, I pulsed the mushrooms in the food processor rather than chopping them by hand. Also, I used red pepper flakes instead of cayenne. Besides that, I stuck to the recipe. Absolutely delicious! We’ll make them again.

As advertised, these meatballs could easily be mistaken for real meatballs.  I made a slightly finer texture of the mushrooms which did not simulate the consistency of regular ground beef.  I would suggest cooking them longer than the recipe so that they would maintain shape in the sauce.  They do take longer to prepare than regular meatballs but are worth it for those who desire a vegetarian alternative.

I've only just become a Vegetarian.  I was skeptical of this recipe, but I followed it to the notch.  I was quite surprised by the flavors and I love mushrooms with spaghetti.  I did use Angel hair pasta and Marinara.  Even people present who eat meat ate it and said it was very good.  Definitely a keeper!

It would be more helpful to put at the beginning of the recipe that the mix should refrigerate overnight for best results. Once I read through that note at step 4, I changed my dinner plans for the night and made the meatballs a day ahead. We use meatballs to make Greek pita sandwiches. The store options for meatless meatballs are loaded with additives and are dry. Instead of simmering the meatballs in pasta sauce, I used 2 cans of mediterranean eggplant and canned tomato sauce. My children enjoyed them so much, they suggested we open a restaurant. My meat craving husband agreed. These meatless meatballs are worth the extra prep time.

Hard to rate this accurately because I used the recipe as a guide for meatless meatballs but I made substitutions to make it GF and Dairy Free. 
Texture is good. Perhaps a little too much garlic (especially if you're feeding a child). I used half crimini and half white mushrooms. 
I used kinnikinnick  bread crumbs and for the cheese I made a simple cashew blended "parmesan". 
I also used a homemade marinara sauce which I didn't care for. I will make this again with a different sauce and maybe substitute some of the garlic for garlic powder.

Loved it the first time I made it! Make sure to follow the directions, and get all the liquid out of the mushrooms. Quick tip: I cut the mushrooms by hand the first couple of times, but it saves time and gives it more of a beef texture if you put them in the food processor.I made a vegi-loaf using this same recipe. I had some left over ricotta, so I threw that in there with some bbq sauce and added a little more bread crumbs to makeup for the extra moisture. I baked it at 350 for about 1hr and 15 min, adding extra bbq sauce on top half way through cooking.

These are fantastic! The wait time is a necessity. Add a bit more moisture if needed to make them hold together but be very sparse on it.

Even my self proclaimed carnivore father loved these!

These do not disappoint!  The texture and flavor are fantastic. Do take the time to chop the mushrooms very fine and also to cook them down very well. Unlike many other meatless options, these do not fall apart when you attempt to form them into balls. I did add 1/4 cup ricotta cheese only because I had it and have also made Chef John's Ricotta Meatballs, which are also amazing, and thought the addition wouldn't hurt.  Very labor intensive but the reward is there.

I’ve made this recipe many times, it is easier with a food processor. I tried it the first time chopping the mushrooms by hand, but every time I stored the mixture in the fridge overnight and it’s come out great every time

The taste was a little strange, but not unpleasant - just something you kind of have to get used to because it’s not really what you expect a meatball to taste like. The texture came out just like a meatball though. I paired this with some quinoa and veggies and it made a hearty, delicious vegetarian dinner.

Absolutely delicious!! I followed the recipe to the T! The only thing that I did differently was keep them in the refrigerator an extra day. Still, the taste was amazing! It was a slightly higher demand recipe, with all the mushroom chopping and waiting.  But so worth it! Will definitely save this recipe!!

I hate mushrooms, but made this for a vegetarian that was coming over for dinner.  I cannot believe how good they were!  Basically the taste is what makes them so good. Chef John knows what he is doing!  They were a little hard to mold, and you don't get many, but they were really good.  A keeper recipe!  Am impressed!

These were VERY good.  I refrigerated the mix for 5 hours.  The cook time was a bit longer. Maybe closer to 20 minutes. I started with 10 minutes, added 3 more then flipped them all and cooked another 4 minutes.  They held together very well in the sauce and taste delicious!

These were delicious even to the carnivore's in the family.  They passed the test in our Italian family! Be sure to watch the video of the very beginning when he instructs you on how to cook the mushrooms. Enjoy!

Had a guest who couldn’t have dairy so made this two ways, with and without the parmigiana. Surprisingly we preferred the one without cheese but either way it was delicious. Used home made tomato sauce which was much easier to make than I thought. My friend was so impressed she took the leftovers and a copy of the recipe home.  By the way, 2 eggs divided doesn’t mean separated, it just means use one here and the other somewhere else. Imagine my surprise after I’d separated them!

I'm not sure how this recipe doesn't get 5 stars all the time!!  I followed it exactly with the exception of the type of cheese I used.  I only had a shredded/3 blended cheddar mix on hand.  I made 1/2 a recipe. I didn't even wait the 4 hours to roll them, they rolled instantly.  I have 3 teenagers in the house, including one that still eats meat (my son).  He LOVED them.  Once I saw how well they were being received, I got up and packed my lunch for the next day.  I put 3 meatball in my lunch (served on carrot rice ... recipe from allrecipes.com too).  Well, I got to work and opened my lunch to show a co-worker how nice they turned out... and to my surprise - only 2 meatballs in my lunch and an indent where the 3rd used to be.... one of the kids went into my lunch and stole one of my meatless meatballs!!  I have guests coming this weekend, I will be serving these meatless meatballs!! Amazing and flavourful. Don't change the recipe... it's perfect the way it is!

Delicious!
As per other reviews I used the food processor to finely chop the mushrooms. Next time I will try the onion in the food processor as well to save time. 
I didn't have time to simmer the meatballs in the sauce for 45 minutes but it turned out fine anyhow.

My daughter recently declared herself a vegan, but not a strict one.  She is completely meatless, so I made these for dinner last night.  I followed the recipe to the letter, and they came out fantastic.  The grandsons still preferred meatballs, but my daughter, wife and I loved this dish.  It takes a little more prep than I'm used to in the kitchen, but as whatsisname says, your patience will be rewarded.

The written recipe calls for 1 lb of mushrooms - but I watched the video and he said "a couple pounds" of mushrooms - so I followed that.  I think that's why my meatless balls fell apart in the oven.  I ended up turning the recipe into a bolognese sauce - the flavors were great!  Next time I make it I'll use 1 lb of mushrooms.

Stop reading all the glowing comments and make these immediately! They will change your life! Or at least will become a regular staple in your lunches and dinners! They are also amazing if you omit the cheese for those that are vegan or calorie counting.

My new meatless meatball go to recipe. I have used the meatball shops meatless recipe before but this one is easier to prepare and tastier too.  I pretty much followed the recipe as portrayed in the video. Used a food processor to chop the onions and mushrooms fine. This go around I added chopped walnuts (an ingredient in the meatball shops recipe that added extra protein and healthy fat). I also let it sit overnight to really meld all of the flavors. They are baking now and smell terrific!

My husband, who will not eat mushrooms, loves these.  I try to make a double batch and keep in the freezer for him.  They are gone within a week.  The chopping and dicing is time consuming, since I want the mushrooms to be very finely chopped.  Perhaps I will experiment with chopping in my food processor....

We love Chef John any way, but I made this for my family. 2 girls ,one hates mushrooms... and 2 boys. It was a hit! It became one for the recipe box. The biggest plus was that may daughter  that hates mushrooms, asks for them every week. My 3 year old eats them up too. That ARE rather tasty!!

Excellent! I also use this recipe to make DELICIOUS meatless burgers. I omit the cheeses, oregano, cayenne pepper; and add half package of Lipton Onion Soup Mix. The longer you allow them to set the better the texture. I allow them to bind overnight. YUMMY!!!!

Absolutely loved these.  A little skeptical about a meatless meatball but I love mushrooms and wanted to try.  They came out amazing.  I used white, crimini and shitake mushrooms.  Prepared mixture in the morning and baked them at dinnertime.  Crispy outside and soft and delicious inside.   Made  vegan mushroom gravy and served over mashed cauliflower with green salad.   Amazing dinner!   Definitely making again.

I feel like this recipe takes a lot of prep, but the meatballs are really good. We didn't cook them in the pasta sauce after baking, but I assume that's good as well.

We used pre-made breadcrumbs that had garlic flavoring in them. I would recommend regular breadcrumbs because I thought this made the meatballs too salty.

We'll definitely make these again. Thanks for the recipe!

Pleasantly pleased with this recipe. The texture was good. I did however increased the amount bread crumbs and oats to stiffen the mixture a little because it was not as firm as i would like it .

These meatless meatballs are super delicious! I was amazed at how much they resemble meat-meatballs and mines held together well when I placed them in the sauce. They are amazing! I will add these to my vegetarian menu and glad I found this recipe.  Thank you Chef John!

They were better after sitting in the sauce overnight and they were a bit gummy. Maybe cutting oats in half and adding quinoa would help with the texture. A food processor would speed up the process for sure.

This recipe does the unimaginable: makes a meatball that tastes like meat! I gave the recipe to a vegetarian friend, and now they have it 2-3 times a week. The kids love it.

To compare these to real meat raises expectations, and unfortunately these don't even come close. I made this for my family of adventurous eaters, but while the texture was pretty good, none of us liked the taste or the smell of these. I made them exactly to recipe, simmered them in a delicious marinara sauce, and served them over pasta, but each of us could only gag one or two "meatballs" down. I'm sorry to be harsh to Chef John's recipe, but these were a big disappointment. They will go down in our history, not as "meatless meatballs," but as "weirdballs."

Very good also as burger patties. My wife claims they are better than the vegetarian patties you can buy in store. Also, I find if I pan fry them they hold together better than when baking (and its quicker).

Excellent! These are sooo tasty, and my husband that dislikes mushrooms did not realize they weren't meat!! He kept making the "mmmmm" sounds as he ate.  This one is a winner!  We have to avoid gluten here and it was super easy to adapt to GF ingredients, too.  Thanks Chef John!!

This is an excellent recipe!! All of the ingredients were in my larder except the parsley and used cilantro instead and refrigerated it overnight.  Will definitely make this one again.  So very good.  My husband went back for seconds...

Wow!  These "meat"balls are fantastic over spaghetti.  I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing.  Great texture and taste.  My husband and I are eating mostly plants and didn't miss the meat at all!  We had to stop ourselves from eating 2 servings and save some for lunches.

Made these lovely meatless meatballs and served with wholewheat spaghetti and a packet sauce that they serve with meatballs at IKEA. Made the ingredients and left in the fridge overnight. Very tasty and will definitely make again.

Made this according to Chef John's recipe and it got rave reviews from my dinner guests. One diner told me to serve as a side dish so as to enjoy the flavor and textures better. The only change I will make next time will be to shorten the time in "cooks" in the pasta sauce but that is a trifling issue. 
Thanks Chef John!!!

Made it exactly as written minus onions (personal preference).   More flavorful than I would have expected.  Perfect texture.  Took a while to prep, but 100% worth it.

Deliciously deceptive, and I don't like meat substitute meals specifically because they never taste 'meaty'. First time, I made the meatballs just like recipe, even hand chopped it all. Added to sauce, then added spaghetti and it was really good!! The key is to really cook down those mushrooms (watch the video).  Second time, I made a loaf by tripling the ingredients. Everyone loved the loaf with rice and gravy, even the meat/potato skeptics who were well aware that it was not meat! My mushroom hating daughter liked it from the first bite and ate a good portion of the loaf. Two loaves made, hoping that they would last for a few days, were quickly eaten that same night. I would suggest getting a food processor, as most of my time was used chopping everything up. I am a believer in this meatballs/loaf recipe and will make this again and again.

Loved this recipe. I followed another review about letting it cool completely after adding the oatmeal, and I left it overnight. It was AWESOME.  I let them simmer and stirred them and they broke so the next batch I made sure not to stir at all and they were perfect. I'll definitely make these again and again.

Amazing! Watch the video as it identifies an important tip not found in the written directions. Specifically, after adding the oats to the mushroom mixture, let it cool to room temperature before adding the cheese. Next time, I would use 2, 24 ounce jars of Rao's Homemade Tomato Basil Sauce if making meatball sandwiches or serving over a bed of quinoa or rice. Fantastic faux meatballs like only Chef John could create.

Tastes a little bland by itself, but it tastes great with feta cheese, vegetables in pita bread. It made a good sandwich.

Spaghetti and meatballs are back on my menu. I made these meatballs and put them in Chef Gorji Pomodoro Sauce ( Buy at Whole Foods) and ladled over Banza chickpea spaghetti. I had a completely normal glucose reading this morning.  Something I haven't had since October 2016, and most certainly not after a pasta meal. I am beyond thrilled  with this recipe. The meatballs are undeniably delicious. The only changes I made was using Garlic & Herb Flavored Bread Crumbs and Quick Cook Steel Cut Oats (buy at Trader Joe's) because that is what I had on hand. Will I make this again, YOU BET! Even my two friends who shared the meal with me couldn't stop raving about how delicious the meatballs were.   They both went home with the recipe.

This recipe is a bit labor intensive but delicious and makes enough meaballs for two dinners. I didn't cook the mushrooms long enough to absorb all the liquid because they seemed as though they might get too brown but this was a mistake on my part as the meat balls fell apart a bit as they were cooking.  However they just ended up like meat sauce and the flavor was great.  My husband didn't know he was eating mushrooms until I told him.  I will definitely make these again, but will cook the mushrooms longer until all the liquid is gone!

Overall - delicious; family loved this unique recipe.  
Best tip - I used a food processor for the mushrooms, onion and garlic.  Definitely cook the mushrooms until they are brown and fully done so that the meatballs do not fall apart.
Changes - I used 1 full egg and 1 egg white.  I probably did not need the second egg white actually.   Also, I started cooking at 7:30PM so there was no time to let it sit for 4 hours or then simmer in the sauce for an hour.  Nonetheless, it turned out great.

Made for one daughter who doesn't like to eat meat, and served it to another daughter too without telling her it was meatless. She said , "Mom, this meatball sub is awesome!!" Hee, Hee ;) I added extra garlic bc I always add extra garlic. Everything else pretty much the same. Another reviewer suggested processing the mushrooms rather than chop for consistency. I did that and it worked out great; made checking for browning in the pan and in the oven a little difficult, but worth it. And "As Always", Thanks Chef John!

Didn't change the ingredients, just took others suggestion of finely chopping mushrooms and onions. Make sure you have in the fridge four hours as the recipe calls. I also baked mine for a total of 25 minutes, they firmed up better that way. Very tasty will make again!

I will definitely make these again.  I made the recipe exactly as written, as I usually do the first time I try something.  I used panko breadcrumbs because that is what I had.  I followed the suggestion from other users and used the pulse on the food processer to chop the mushrooms.  Great time saver! 

Let the mixture cool before adding the cheese per the video (sit down and relax with a glass of wine).  I refrigerated the mixture overnight to get the best results.   I got 16 meatballs using a 2 TBL scoop not filled quite all the way.  They did seem a little crumbly so I mushed them together with my hands.  Once baked (took my oven 13 minutes, they got a golden brown), I gently placed them in the simmering sauce and did not disturb them for about 45 minutes. 

Hubby said if he did not know they were mushrooms, he would have thought they were meat.  Tasted like a tender meat meatball.  

Loved and will make a again!!

This has become one of my favorite recipes.  I followed some other reviewers tips and use my food processor to prep the mushrooms.  These are so tasty and tender.  I'm starting to make it once a week.  I highly recommend it.  My husband eats meat and I don't.  This is a recipe we both love.

Absolutely phenomenal! The flavors work so well together. Rich and tasty!! Will definitely make this again. Would be great for a party or put over some pasta. But good enough on its own!

These are outstanding!  I made them mostly as directed.  The only change I made was in using old fashioned oats instead of the quick variety, because the old fashioned type was all that I had on hand.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a T!  These will now be a staple in my vegetarian menu!

Followed the recipe as is.  I was so excited to try the meatballs after I cooked them, that I didn't wait to have them in my dinner.  I found them to be a bit salty, and spongy from the bread crumbs and oatmeal, which become a bit moist after sitting in the fridge so long.  They taste better when eaten with the sauce and pasta together.  They had okay flavour, though I think I'd add half the salt next time and maybe try some worchestershire sauce to get even more meaty flavouring in them.  But they cooked up nicely, browned on the outside, and didn't fall apart when added to the sauce.  The family enjoyed them overall, and would eat them again.

I tested one prior to cooking it in the sauce and was very impressed just how flavourful this meatball is! I'll be making this often in my house! I also cooked double the amount so they'll be plenty of left overs! I'll be serving this with a side of salad

These were seriously a lot of work, prep time, etc BUT totally worth every minute of it! I followed the recipe to the letter (Chef John's recipes are always fantastic)  even though it seemed like an awful lot of work. The result was fabulous taste and texture and the family gobbled them up and asked for seconds. That is, until the husband asked "what did you make these out of?" and the 4 year old got wise to the fact that the meatballs must be 'meatless'. Figuring the jig was up, I revealed the main ingredient. The husband was amazed that the meatballs were made of mostly mushrooms and the 4 year old was disgusted and started making gagging sounds. Jokes on her, she ate 3 'meatballs' and LOVED them (even called them the best ever) before she knew what they were made of.  I will definitely make these again, but next time I will remind the husband to keep his darn mouth shut except to enjoy the 'meatballs' and not ask unnecessary questions about the ingredients.

I've tried many recipes for vegetarian meatballs over the years and this is by far the best - I'll throw all the other recipes away.   The technique is really what's important in this recipe. Like other folks reviewing this recipe, I would highly recommend viewing the video first (especially since the written recipe forgets to mention that you need to cool the mushroom mixture before adding the Parmesan cheese).  Thanks, John, for this recipe.

I wanted to like it. Mine held together just fine and looked delicious but both the taste and texture were off for me.  I love mushrooms and can make a great meal out of a portobello so I really had high expectations. I will not make this again.

I made the meatballs exactly as recommended except that circumstances only allowed 3 hours in the fridge (they were still amazing!). I used them in a sweet and sour meatball recipe. We don't eat meat and this recipe was an exciting find. I will be making these often. Can't wait to include them with Allrecipe's "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" recipe.

I was worried that I may have messed this up because I used the food processor to chop the mushrooms and they ended up very paste like, however these are terrific.I made my own marinara sauce and made put them on a nice crispy baguette topped with Swiss cheese for a awesome low fat, vegetarian  meatless ball sub.

I made this tonight, and had to review it because it was THAT good!  Actually, I meant to make it for last night's dinner until I got to the instructions that said you have to refrigerate it for at least 4 hours! Had soup last night instead, and refrigerated the mixture until today, but it was worth it. My vegetarian husband said it reminded him of what real meatballs used to taste like. To make our meal even healthier, we served the meatballs and sauce over spaghetti squash. It was seriously delicious.

Excellent recipe I saved half for pesto and will use half with the tomato sauce it worked well with the pesto and I can't wait to try it with the tomato sauce this is the best made alternative recipe I've tried so far.  The texture and flavor are very good.  Thanks.

These meatballs are amazing!!!! I was a little worried because I made the meatball mixture before I watched the video, and my mushroom were not browned correctly,nor did I let them cool before adding the other ingredients, but they still came out amazingly delicious!!!! I also don't like mushrooms (well at least I thought) I was open minded and it paid off because this recipe is a keeper!

These were perfect! Meat eaters present insisted on sharing in my daughter's meatless meatballs, after tasting them. The held together, browned nicely in the oven (next time I will turn them half-way through), and held together in the sauce. AND tasted great!

I've learned that I can always trust Chef John!

GREAT meatless meatball.  My husband said they were some of the best meatballs he has had, and his grandparents came from Italy.    Terrific option to feed non-vegetarians AND vegetarians to leave them both happy at the dinner table!  I used  a food processor and it made these easy to make too!

Takes a long time to make, (I tripled the recipe to take to a Christmas party.) but well worth the effort. A food processor is a must to get the mushrooms finely chopped. I cut down on the garlic by 1/3 and slightly increased the cheese. The look and consistency are almost identical to ground beef meatballs. I will definitely make these again.

Made these last night.  I am a relatively new vegetarian, and was craving something with a "meat" texture.  I tinkered around with the recipe a little adding more heat (chopped jalapenos), and using Panko breadcrumbs for more texture, and baked them.  They came out SPECTACULAR!   Would highly recommend

I made this with several types of mushrooms. Delicious. I also froze this dish and it proved to be as good. When reheating after frozen it is better not to do this in a microwave as it can become watery . I wanted to freeze this as my son is a vegetarian  and I like to prepare ahead of time so I don´t have too much to do on the day.
A good option

I couldn't stop eating these, they were so good! I did make quite a few changes though, using just what I had on hand. First, I supplemented the white mushrooms with a different kind because I was slightly short of a pound (not sure what they are called but they are longer and skinnier than the white ones). Next I omitted the garlic and Parmesan but doubled the onion and parsley. Instead of bread crumbs I used about a cup of short-grain brown rice that I buy ready to heat and serve (it's the brown counterpart to "sushi rice" so it's on the slightly stickier side). Lastly I used old fashioned rolled oats. After chilling the mixture about an hour I went ahead and rolled them into balls and then put them back in the fridge overnight. The next morning, after baking them until lightly browned, I gently heated them in a portobello mushroom sauce (Muir Glen Organic). Everything held together nicely and the texture was great. I think the original recipe must be quite forgiving based on the success I had with my modifications. Willing to try the original recipe but for now I'm very happy with the results I got!

This is my second time making these, and it is already one of my ultimate favorite recipes!  They are so delicious!  I had missed meatballs and meatball subs since turning vegetarian 7 years ago.  Freezer, store-bought kind do not compare, plus those are usually a bunch of processed  anyway.  These are time-consuming, therefore I recommend making 2-3 batches at a time and freezing them.  I made traditional meatball subs, and have also marinated a batch in 1/2 grape jelly and 1/2 chili sauce for a sweet and savory meatball appetizer.  This is a must try!

Used a food processer with blade to process mushrooms to ground meat texture.  The mushrooms take a while longer to cook their liquid out and get golden brown, but worth all the effort.  I used 8 oz. white and 8 oz. crimini. I added a minced shallot as well, about a tablespoon.  No other changes and these are the best meatless balls you will ever make.  Yummy!

These are amazing. My daughter went vegetarian a year ago and she really misses spaghetti and meatballs but no longer!  I used a food processes and minced the onion and mushrooms together.  I was worried they were processed to fine but it worked great!  I then proceeded to brown them until liquid was pretty much gone.  Then I put the mixture in the freezer for 1/2 hour as I didn't plan ahead.  I baked them until brown which took longer then the recipe stated.  Froze left overs and that worked perfectly as well.

I made these for a vegetarian friend.    The meatless meatballs really  were tasty, but kind of soft in the middle.    Must admit I made them early in the day and they sat in my spaghetti sauce for hours.    Haven't decided yet if I will make these again as they were lots of work.

I had a vegetarian guest for dinner and gave these a try.  I made them exactly as directed but left out the cayenne, as my wife doesn't do spicy well.  They were delicious and could easily pass as beef meatballs.  I served them over spaghetti squash, with garlic bread on the side, and it turned out to be a meal that I thoroughly enjoyed, despite thinking that I wouldn't care for it.  We all had second servings and there were no leftovers.

I've just started a plant based diet  and so I left out the cheese and used egg white (didn't know what else would bind the mixture).  The uncooked mixture is delicious.  Got em in the fridge chilling.  Going to have them for dinner.  I don't care if they fall apart.  This looks like another winner from my favorite Chef, John!  Thanks Chef John!????
UPDATE:  I actually kept the mixture in the fridge for 24 hours.  I baked them and put them in my homemade tomato gravy.  These are the best meatballs I've ever made.  My hamburger meatballs are usually not the best.  This recipe is terrific.  I don't think anyone would guess there's no meat in there!

I just finished my second batch and they taste even better then the first. I think that's because I wasn't as particular with the measurements of the ingredients. I followed what the ingredients said, but I wasn't exacting. Anyway.  The only other thing I did differently was to add the water as suggested in the video and the meatballs seemed to soak up the favor more. This recipe is great whether you're trying to become a vegetarian and still have a longing for meat or you are a carnivore, because however you serve these meatless meatballs, they are delicious.

It tastes very good with rich flavor of mushroom.
However, I had a hard time to reduce water from mushroom during stir frying. After all, my veggie balls became flatted. is there any tip reducing water from mushroom?

What a great surprise.  My wife doesn't typically like mushrooms in her food.  She didn't even know until I told her after eating one.    Has a great texture and takes on seasonings and sauce flavor with very mild hint of mushroom.

Made exactly as Chef John suggested! I couldn't believe how good these were. My wife and I were so impressed after years of making our meatballs with ground pork and ground beef. We, literally, could not tell the difference; although these were just a wee bit more tender. They really soak up the sauce! Oh, it is really important to watch the video as one other reviewer noted. Great recipe Chef John! Thanks for sharing!

These were very good (albeit a  LOT more work than using meat! haha). I agree with others that it is a good idea to watch the video and DO be sure to brown the mushrooms up for the best flavor. I did use a food processor which helped with the chopping time. 
I added spinach to a basic homemade tomato sauce and served over couscous. Very good!

I made these meatballs twice for myself and a couple of other health-conscious co-workers.  First as Swedish meatballs and the other time as spaghetti and meatballs, both served over tofu noodles.  Everyone absolutely loved both recipes and said they did not miss the meat at all!  One lady said that she really missed spaghetti and meatballs because she had given up red meat and pasta.  She's ecstatic that she can have this healthy version.

These were very good, and easy to make using a food processor.  I didn't have any problem with them holding together; I used a small scoop to portion them and then rolled them into compact balls with my hands. Bake them ahead and store them in the freezer to use as needed.

Delicious! With a few small substitutions I made a vegan, gluten-free version to meet a number of dietary requirements at a work pot luck. The texture and taste are incredibly similar to meatitarian meatballs. I'll definitely be making these again... and I don't even like mushrooms.

I made burgers from this recipe. They were GREAT! Burgers had texture and stayed together when cooking. The only improvement would be to add some partially mashed red or black beans to the recipe. I will defiantly make this recipe again. Next time trying a meatloaf.

Made this several times with other applications (ie: sliders, burgers, faux sausage patties); it is a versatile, forgiving, and delicious recipe that has become a basic "go-to" for me to prepare and a favorite of my family.

I made this recipe as written, but I do want to state that the mushrooms should be very, very finely chopped. I used a food processor to do the job. I couldn't tell that they were made of mushrooms and neither could my son or husband who both enjoyed them.

I made these for a vegetarian dinner party and they were fantastic! I doubled the recipe but only used two eggs total, and I pureed the mushrooms in my food processor rather than trying to mince them by hand. It takes a while to cook out all the liquid, but it's worth it. This was the fourth of a five-course tasting menu and I served them with pasta tossed in homemade marinara, the meatballs on top, and the whole thing topped with marinara and grated Locatelli Romano. I paired it with a 2013 Seghesio Cortina Zinfandel, which is fruity with light tannins and it was perfect.

Yummy!  Will make again and again.  Doubled the recipe and still didn't have enough left over.  I added some Worcestershire sauce and a bit of beef broth.  Will try again with black beans or lentils as well.  Very savory.

I usually don't comment on here, but I MUST!!!  THESE ARE AWESOME!!!!  Seriously!!!  I did not wait the 4 hours (who has time for that??).  SO SO SO SO SO GOOD!!!!  I used my Ninja to chop the mushrooms, and I thought I ruined it when most of the mixture was almost liquidy, but it did not ruin them at all.  So, really, you can't make the mushroom too fine.  WOW, really!!!  MAKE THIS!!!!

My husband does not like mushrooms! I made these and put them in the fridge. He found them, added some of my homemade pasta sauce and ate them! He loves them. I don't know when, if ever, I will tell them that they are made with (of) mushrooms but I will continue to make and eat them. They are great! I made no changes to the recipe - not necessary. Easy to make and delicious.

These are excellent made exactly according to the recipe.   The only things I might change are to process the mushrooms and onions in the food processor and  bake them just a little longer as others have suggested.  I finished them in a marinara sauce but they would be just as good to serve as Swedish meatballs,

They went over so great at potluck lunch that I was asked to make them for a vegetarian tasting get together.

My teenage daughter is a vegetarian. I search far and wide for **good** substitutes using real food. This recipe is fantastic! I use a food processor to finely chop the mushrooms and onion - and I even give the oats a few pulses. They're freezable but a little delicate - if proper care is taken, the meatballs stay together. I even recommended the recipe to non-vegetarian friends who commented that the recipe is time consuming (it is, be prepared) but that the results were delicious.

This is an excellent meal, i am not however a vegan and enjoy meat very much as a (side dish) and not as the main dish but then again i mostly eat a lot of indian recipes who do not require so much meat. In any such case i served this meal for my friends and it was perfect! This is in my opinion the best alternative to meat balls as mushrooms are so good however i have to admit i used portobello mushrooms instead of white as i realised at the last minute i had no white mushrooms lol

The texture was a little more dough-y than I would have liked, but the flavor is so so good. Calorie wise these are on par with lean beef or turkey meatballs, but you can bet the unhealthy fat content is much less in these meatballs.

These were so amazing. I've tried other meatless meatball recipes, but this one wins for flavor and texture. I think the trick was letting the mix rest in the fridge to get to the perfect texture. I added chopped eggplant that I roasted in the oven along with the mushroom duxelles. Everyone needs to try this!

Awesome recipe! Definitely watch the video as it points out several steps that really made the difference. Like making sure All the liquid is gone when cooking the mushrooms before adding the butter...and refrigerating the mixture overnight made it very easy the next day as well as added so much more flavor.  Thanks!

Really good. Time consuming, but worth it! Cool after cooking mushrooms/onions and before adding cheese. I made the night before, no problems with them holding together. My son said they tasted just like regular meat balls! Its been so long since I've tasted the real thing, I couldn't compare. These hit the spot either way.

Delicious!  As a recent vegetarian, I was missing spaghetti and meatballs.  These are so flavorful and the texture was perfect. I could definitely see using the base mixture for chilli or taco's with some added spices.  I'll be making these again!

Recipe made 20 meatballs. I prepared the mixture on Thursday night, then rolled and baked the meatballs Saturday night. I used one jar of artichoke Parmesan pasta sauce and added only 10 meatballs. I simmered about 25 minutes, not 45. Most of the liquid had been absorbed or boiled away.  They were so delicious. I put them on top of angel hair pasta with some raw baby spinach underneath. Most of the pasta remained dry - could have done without because the meatballs were so good on their own. Topped with the cheese and parsley from the recipe plus a bit of basil, fresh pepper, and pine nuts.

I prepared the recipe as stated but I browned mine in a skillet with a drizzle of olive oil until thoroughly browned on all sides, creating a lightly crusted exterior.  I then poured my sauce directly into the skillet and heated the sauce through, the "meatballs" stayed intact. This is a phenomenal recipe! Very , very delicious and healthy, will certainly make again!

So good!!  I was inspired by all the positive reviews.  We have been vegetarian for a couple years now but don't force our teenagers to follow suit so I'm often making 2 versions of a dinner so they don't feel deprived because of our whims. (I realize if I really loved them I'd deprive them of things bad for them but I'm not convinced all meat is bad.  How it can be processed is, and how our older selves can no longer process it :/).  
This is one of those rare recipes that satisfy us all and enable me to return to more traditional Sunday night pasta.  
I followed other reviewer suggestions and used food processor to make light work of the mushrooms.  It had pluses and minuses.  It basically made mushroom meal which was much more similar to using ground meat but was harder to judge when cooking it - when it was properly browned. I erred on overlooked as undercooked mushrooms are awful and ruin a dish. And on one like this, that requires a lot of prep, it would be tragic.  It's not hard though and next time I'll plan on making meatballs a day ahead so it can sit overnight.  I ended up with 16 small scoop meatballs.  For a single dinner it was perfect at 4 a piece, but I will also double next time since part of the joy of meatballs is no cooking the next day because we have meatball subs.  I used regular rolled oats and always use pecorino instead of Parmesan.  Other than that made exactly as instructed.  (Thank you other reviewer who mentioned allowing mushrooms to cool before

Absolutely amazing! Both meat & vegetarian lovers raved about these meatballs and I didnt have the time to let the mixture sit 4hr let alone overnight so can only imagine how they could be any better?  I had no issues with falling apart but did pulse mushrooms, onion & garlic in food processor to finely mince, cooked until all moisture was evaporated which took on my stove on medium-low about 30-45 min., used 1/2 cup egg whites since had those on hand.  Made otherwise as directed and baked after mixing all ingredients and WOW!  Texture like meat.  Rich flavor.  Truly 5+ stars!  Thanks for sharing this keeper.

I love most of Chef John's recipes and as is I really like this one, but I have some tips for this one to get a better meatball. Use a few different kinds of mushrooms if you can.  The white ones are usually the least expensive, but the baby bellas and some portabellas or even a handful of crimini's will definitely amp up the taste if you can get them.  They'll also change the texture  a bit.  if you have a chopper, go ahead and use it. I know some ppl worried about mushroom paste and how the meatballs would hold together, give the chopper a few spins, don't lay on that button till you get paste and you can use a sturdier bread crumb and slightly less pasta sauce.  Use crushed stuffing.  put it in a plastic bag and go over it with your rolling pin.  dont make it powder like.  you want larger than bread crumb pieces.  Please note that Parmigiano-Reggiano  is the expensive Italian cheese, outside the EU the same cheese made the same way is just called Parmesan.  Parmesan however can be a bit saltier, so depending on how you like salt, you might want to omit the pinch here.. Salt can always be added at table if it needs it. Get the Parmesan tho and save a few bucks.  as for the pasta sauce.  don't skimp here, or try not to anyway (we all have to skimp sometimes :)) the better the sauce, the better the meatball that 99 cent can of pasta sauce doesnt do these meatballs any favors.  finally, these aren't meant to sit in sauce, they will get mushy, these have a good sauce served ove

Absolutely delicious flavor! I have a vegetarian daughter-in-law and being Italian, we often have pasta & meatballs.  I was happy to offer her meatless meatballs that were truly delicious.  All the meateaters who tasted them swore they had to have meat in them.   They do take some effort, but well worth it.

The best meatballs I've ever had!  Trying a lot of vegetarian recipes and this one is the best so far!!!  My son and  I made it together - it was fun and so delicious!   Going to try to replace bread crumbs with Quinoa.  Don't know if it will hold together, we'll see.  UPDATE - didn't work with quinoa.  Oh well, I'll stick to the recipe.  It really is sooooo good.  Still the best meatballs ever!

I made these for my family's Xmas gathering because of the high number of vegetarians attending. All the vegetarian and non vegetarians really liked them.  The best comment came from my vegetarian nephew who said."These are the best vegetarian meatballs I have ever eaten!  They were not funky in texture or taste!"  They have a great meat like texture--those mushrooms.  No one could guess the main ingredient!!  I will be making a double batch next year or maybe a triple batch!

This recipe was spot on. The smell coming from the oven you'd never guess were not MEATballs. I did use Italian seasoning in addition to fresh Italian parsley. I only had 3 cheese blend parm, trader Joe's oatmeal and panko, so I used those. Refrigerated for at least 4 hours and in the oven I flipped every so often to get them crispy all over. We made "meatball" sandwiches with pepper jack cheese on sourdough.

I've made these several times.  I've been a vegetarian for about 20 years now and really miss meatballs.  I served these with pasta and as a meatball sub.  They are fabulous!!  My daughters are also vegetarians and love them.  As other reviewers said I waited until the mixture cooled before adding the egg, cheese, etc.  I used a food processor to chop the mushrooms.  I can't say enough great things about these meatballs.  Thank you so much Chef John!

I followed the recipe and it turned out great! I seek out non soy based vegetarian foods so this was perfect. I shared the leftovers with my fiancé, cold and dipped in hummus...so good!

These have a great consistency and are actually pretty simple to make. Don't skimp on the salt, the meatballs kind of need it. I went lighter than it said but should've just trusted the recipe.

Very Good! I actually compared this recipe to the mushroom veggie burger one also by Chef John, and decided to use this one for the veggie burgers. Chef John, in the video for this states that this is based off the veggie burger recipe. 
I halved it because I only had 8 oz of mushrooms, used 1 egg , 4 cloves of garlic and a handful of parsley. I used Quaker instant oatmeal because that's what I had and followed the directions in the recipe, but did not let this sit in the refrigerator at all. 
Instead, I made the mixture, put about 1 teaspoon of oil in a pan, formed patties (I got 3) and pan cooked them for about 5 to 7 minutes on each side adding shredded mozzarella as soon as I flipped the parties the first time. Really good on a potato hamburger bun with mayo, lettuce, tomato, ketchup and pickles. I plan to double the recipe, make the patties and freeze them so I have them on hand. My kids really liked them, even the one who hates mushrooms!

These are amazing.  They're even better than some of the real meatballs I've had. The one change I made was to use multigrain cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs.  The grains really added to the savory taste of the mushrooms.  I will definitely make these again (soon).

This is a great base ball! The first time I made it, everyone said it was almost like stuffing as a ball, which of course is a great thing. So, I thought,  "what could make it better?" Sage and celery. Wow! Love love love! One of my little men doesn't do sauces so we do this with mashed potatoes and gravy and a side. Will always make this and NEVER buy brand meatless balls again, they all fail in comparison and are so processed.

I made these for the first time and the texture was surprisingly good, like actual baked meatballs.  The taste was just a little on the bland side, so next time I will add more garlic, some onion salt and some Italian herb seasoning.

Sooooo  good.  My husband even ate and enjoyed the meatballs and he is really a canned peas kind of guy.  Made them exactly as written.  No need to change anything.  I could not believe the consistency--it was just like meat.  
Excellent!  Will definitely make again

This recipe is amazing. The taste, the texture, you couldn't tell they weren't meat. I will say that I only used 1 clove of garlic instead of 4 as I wanted to taste something besides garlic. 5 STARS definitely deserved and I thank you for sharing.

Companion & I liked these a lot but I didn't get the outside crunch that other reviewers had from baking in the oven.  Will try again with rolling in extra bread crumbs prior to the baking.

I followed the recipe to a T...  It took a bit of chopping of the mushrooms but the smaller they are, the more it works.  And make sure you actually cook them until the water is evaporated.  After it sets...  Take the size ball you want and pinch it together, then gently roll them in your hands to make them round.  If you take that bit of patience to make them firm, after baking, you will have a solid ball of YUMMINESS!  My daughter didn't even realize they were made from mushrooms, not meat!

I've made these "meat"balls a few times. My boyfriend is a vegetarian and he obviously loves them. I'm not (and I'm not a huge mushroom fan) and I LOVE them. I don't really follow the recipe word for word but I just throw the ingredients in until it becomes sticky. And the resting period is crucial. Best meatless meatball recipe I've ever had!

These are excellent. I'll keep this short, we eat spaghetti and meatballs once a week. I made this recipe, and three meat-based ones in a month. My husband, the anti-vegetarian, said these were the best. The flavor is awesome, the texture is awesome, I make changes every time depending on what I have on hand, but this is now my go-to recipe for meatballs. Thank you!

I whipped these up quick one night. I did not let the meatballs sit for hours, I just used it right away due to my schedule. My kids were not able to tell the difference. Also, I went ahead and cooked these right in sauce, I did not bake them first. Will try it again.

Holy  these are good!! Passed the test on a staunch meat eater!!! Dropped these into some homemade red sauce and served w salad. Best part was that I offered salad to my other half and he said he didn't want any veggies...hahahahahahah! He was eating nothing but veggies in the main dish!!

Loved the texture and the taste was pretty good, but I should have browned the mushrooms more. Especially after watching the video, I see how vital this step is. I think mine lacked the depth of flavor that other reviewers got, so I will brown them a bit beyond "golden brown" next time.

These were ok to me. I grew up around a lot of vegetarians and even spent some time as a vegetarian myself so I've had many different kinds of vegetarian meatballs both store bought and homemade and these ranked about middle of the pack in my opinion. I think these are the kind that actually are better outside of a tomato based sauce just on their own.

This recipe is amazing!  I made it exactly as written a few days ago.  I'm back at it today and the only change I'll make is to double it.  Thanks for giving the vegetarians out there something they can share with their meat eating friends!

I made these meatballs and substituted nutritional yeast for the cheese (lactose intolerant).  They came out great and also freeze very well.

Delicious!!  Definitely will be making this again!  I used to eat meat so I know how meatballs taste. I would definitely choose the meatless meatball over the one that's made out of meat.

Tried this recipe, flavor was great, however, my meatballs melted into the sauce. Since I didn't want to alter the recipe, I chopped the mushrooms by hand, didn't want to turn them into paste. It was tedious work. So we had a great tasting mushroom sauce, no meatballs.

I have a serious aversion to anything with mushrooms, but my husband loves them so I decided to give this recipe a try. So glad I did! The texture was just like a regular meatball and the flavor was amazing! Definitely adding this recipe to my regular rotation, thanks Chef John!

I have made these four times now .the last time I did the mushrooms in the food processor which gave them the consistency of fried beef ,perfect for shepards pie or any other recipe that you would use fried  meat.

This is a great recipe. Made them for 1 vegetarian and all the meat eaters ate them. I left the mixture overnight and it was delicious and wasn't too hard to make. Then cooked them in my own sauce (Hunt's tomato, some lemon, srirarcha and sugar) and they still worked great. They were delicious.

These are really great!   I will definitely make them again.  I don't think they tasted just like regular meatballs, but they are a really great food all on their own.

For me, baking the meatless meatballs at 450C was too hot. Next time I will turn down the heat to 425C for 10 minutes.

This is an amazing recipe - and everyone loved it first try!  Daughter couldn't figure out what kind of meatball it was - just knew I promised it was totally meatless!  A real keeper!!!  Thank you, Chef John!!

These did not have the consistency of a meatball but the taste was very good.
