I apologize to the submitter for not using the Amarula liqueur as she or he intended in the recipe. I'm sure it's wonderful, but since I wanted to make this at the spur of the moment, I needed a hasty substitute so I just used hot, brewed coffee. It was delicious, even without this exotic liqueur and I'm sure it would have been as good or better had I used it. Since chocolate is the star of the show in chocolate fondue, I used a fine quality bittersweet chocolate rather than the chocolate chips. This is rich, smooth, and creamy, though I increased the amount of cream a bit, while reducing the amount of liqueur (again, I used strong, brewed coffee). I found that scaling this to 6 servings was more than enough for hubby and me, and the leftover fondue was perfect for chocolate covered strawberries!

Really good.  You could play with other liqueurs such as kahlua, gran marnier, cassis, Irish cream, etc.  You may have to lessen the volume though.

I made this for boyfriend, he loved it! You can get this special liquor at beverages and more, or cost plus. It really gives it a amaretto/bailey's taste. DELICIOUS!

Easy and quick to make with great results. We used Kahlua instead of the other liquor, it worked fine.

I made this for a women's night out party & it was a hit. Everyone ate it up within minutes & were very happy & relaxed throughout the evening. I used Myrtle liqueur beacause that was all I had & it was great!

Definitely recommend making this with actual Amarula, as the recipe states. It is an AMAZING tasting liqueur, I've never had anything like it before, and it is what makes this chocolate fondue so unique. Great idea, thanks for sharing!

I used milk chocolate chips instead and this was the PERFECT valentines day dessert!  I would make this again in a second.  The amarula adds a mild flavouring that tasted amazing!
