I combined this recipe with some elements of another ambrosia salad recipe from this site and came up with a delicious ambrosia salad that serves 8-12(I served this at a Father's Day gathering for 12).  I used a 20 oz can of pineapple chunks, a 15 oz can of mandarin oranges, 1 banana halved lengthwise and sliced, 1 cup of sliced strawberries, 1 cup of flaked coconut and 1 cup of coarsely chopped pecans.  For the dressing, I whipped together 2 cups of low fat sour cream, 1/3 cup Splenda and 1 tsp vanilla.  I mixed the dressing and fruit together and chilled it for about 3 hours before serving.  It was delicious!! Next time I make this, I will cut down on the sour cream a bit, maybe try 1 1/2 cups. This is definitely a fruit salad I amke frequently and it will be very easy to decrease and serve for 6

I first made this recipe in 4th grade after we studied Hawaii and had a luau!
We called it 5 cup salad or ambrosia and this is exactly how I made it--to keep it simple, 1 cup of each of the above 5 ingredients.  If you can find can find colored mini marshmallows they are more festive.  Also, my mom likes to use fruit cocktail in addition.  Remember to drain the fruit well, especially if it sits overnight before you serve it.

The perfect amount!  I modified slightly by adding only 1/2 c sour cream and a cup of cool whip.

Good with these modifications: I took the tip that said to mix 1/2 sour cream with 1/2 cool whip (also added 1 tsp of vanilla to that mixture). I also doubled the recipe. I added chopped bananas, chopped maraschino cherries, & strawberries & chilled for several hours before serving. It served a group of 12 for Easter lunch. Everyone loved it!

This Ambrosia Salad is great. I think the sour cream is just right,I find Cool Whip so artificial tasting! The only thing I did different was to add Maraschino Cherries.

I wanted to double the recipe, and incorporate other's suggestions.  I stirred together 1 cup sour cream, 1 cup Cool Whip, 1/2 Tbl each of vanilla and sugar. I used 22 oz mandarin oranges and 16 oz pineapple and added ~ 1 1/2-2 cups strawberries, 1 banana & 1/2 cup blueberries.  I didn't double the coconut or marshmallows, using 1 cup of each.  Then added ~ 1/2 cup chopped pecans.  It was just sweet enough, the textures were good and the pecans added a little variety to the flavor.  Thanks for all the ideas.

I love this stuff!!!  I use 2 cups of mini marshmallows (the multi-colored version) and only 3/4 c of sour cream.  I think using sour cream is so much better than the Cool Whip that other Ambrosia Salads call for.  It's just too artificial for my liking.  Make sure the salad is nice and cold before serving.

This is just like my Gram's recipe, which was lost!  She always layered the top with coconut instead of mixing it in, then decorated the top with marachino cherries!  It looks great in a big punch bowl.

This is yummy, I did alter the recipe a bit, I added the oranges,pineapple, and a can of fruit cocktail, cherries, I also added about 1 TBLS white sugar, Just to give it a hint of sweetness but not to sweet, Everyone devoured it! I like it so much better then the cool whip version. Thank you for the recipe.

This was great as is, but I like my ambrosia a bit sweeter. I left off the coconut altogether, and added maraschino cherries.  I mixed the dressing separately by adding the sour cream, cool whip, 1/2 tsp of french vanilla flavoring, and a packet of strawberry jello crystals and mixed with the fruit and chopped walnuts. It was divine! I did make enough for 8 people so I used a bit more than what this recipe called for.

I made this for a brunch a couple of days ago.  I followed the directions exactly.  It was good.  Tasted like I remembered when my Mom made it years ago.  The only thing I would change if I made it again would be to decrease the sour cream slightly.  It gets a little runny after sitting in the fridge overnight.  :(

I made this just as the recipe called for and it was great!  My preferences would be another can of oranges and about half the coconut, but it was still really good just the way it was :o)  The sour cream instead of whipped topping is the way to go and if you ask me, this recipe tastes just like your local grocery store deli's.

This is my secret guilty comfort food.  The sour cream is way better then the whipped creme versions, because its not so sickly sweet.

I have been making this for years and it is always a good, easy salad to make especially for the holidays. I always use more oranges and pineapple chunks and keep the other ingredients the same. I usually use a 20 can of pineapple and two 11 ounce cans of mandarin oranges.  This time I added some fresh kiwi and that was a nice addition.

WE have been making this salad for years in my family for the holidays (great with ham).Our only difference is adding marachino cherries. It's my favorite. Not a holiday meal without it!!

I took this to a pot luck the first time I made it (always a leap of faith, but with so few ingredients I thought I was safe) and it was a big hit! I used fat free sour cream (we have Tillamook brand here in Oregon, and it's fantastic)  and you couldn't even tell. Not the healthiest "salad" in the world by any means, but definitely a crowd pleaser.

I made this according to the recipe except that I added slivered almonds because the recipe my Mom made when we were growing up had them in it.  It was good but all that coconut made it a little too sweet for a side dish.  I made it as a trial run for Easter, and I'm glad I did because it just isn't quite what I'm looking for to serve with Easter dinner.  But I still ate it all up!

This was good, and just what you are looking for if you don't want a "too sweet" Ambrosia.  I missed some of the creaminess of Ambrosia's with cool whip, so I added about 1 cup of cool whip.  BUT, I did enjoy this as a lighter version then cool whip Ambrosias. I will make it again!

This salad is tasty and refreshing. The only thing I did different was to add some condensed milk(to your liking) to the sour cream in  order to sweeten it up a bit. I recommend using a well known brand for marshmallows,I bought a generic brand and it got very soggy once it sat in fridge overnight . This salad greatly benefits from sitting in the fridge several hrs. or overnight it gets better with time, another suggestion would be to first combine the sour and condensed milk and then fold in additional ingredients in order to not break up the tangerines that much. I also used pineapple tidbits instead of chunks due to texture prefrence.

My stepdaughter would eat her weight in this stuff if she could!  I always had this at Easter growing up.  Or any other time we had a ham.  We slice a banana into it just prior to serving as well.  And sometimes slivered almonds, or some white grapes...  I would NEVER put cool whip in this.  The sour cream breaks down the marshmallows perfectly, and cool whip would make it way too sweet.

I did change up this recipe quite a little bit.  I just used regular flavor marshmallows instead of the flavored, but next time I think I will do the fruity marshmallows.  I also added a little mayo too.  Maybe 1/2 cup.  Also I added a small can of marashino cherries (cut in half.)  And about 1 cup of chopped walnuts as well.  I chilled a good long time (approx. 6 hours...the longer, the better.)  This was good.  Great for an occasion with kids!

Couldn't get simpler. SO GOOD. Add a couple drops of red food coloring to give it that Retro look. SO SO GOOD

THE BEST. This is the way my family has always made it.  I prefer it to the cool whip kind.  I also cannot stand recipes that add grapes of fruit cocktail. This recipe is perfect as is. YUM!

Yummy!!! I used a small can of fruit cocktail as well as small cans of mandarin oranges and pineapple. I was nervous that the sour cream wouldn't be sweet, but the other ingredients make it totally sweet. It was a big hit!

This is exactly how we make it in my family but we also add chopped walnuts and it's a great combination. If you have no allergies to nuts, I suggest you try it!

I LOVED this recipe. I made it for my baby shower and people just adored it. The cherries really give it some pizzazz!! It is by far the best ambrosia salad recipe I have ever used!

Yummy. This was awesome. I altered it a bit by adding 1 large can fruit cocktail in its own juice and used 1/2 cup sour cream and 1 cup cool whip. It is definitely better the 2nd day. I will make this again and again.

Brought this salad camping. And couldnt of been a bigger hit or better dessert. Instead of only pinapple and mandarines i used 2 cups of canned mixed fruit salad. Insead of all sour cream i used half soy-whipped cream. Perfecto!

What I really love about this is it is quick and easy to double for a big group.  It is something that kids or all ages really love too!  We had this at a family get together and many asked for the recipe.  It was so easy I could remember it without even looking.

This is super easy and super yummy! Perfect the way it is...no need to alter or add extras. Perfect for any summer party and great at wedding/baby showers. People always love it and ask me for the recipe. I recite it from memory and they can't believe how simple it is. I remember my mom making this a lot when I was growing up so I have a nostalgia for it :)

This is the real deal, none of that whipped topping stuff!  I grew up with this salad and still like it.  Thanks for posting this Judi.
