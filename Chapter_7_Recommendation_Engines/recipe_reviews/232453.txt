I have had one similar, but a lot easier to make! Just put everything all together in 2 qt casserole dish, quinoa uncooked, cover and cook on 350 for 30 min. Remove, stir, and put back in 15-20 min until all liquid absorbed. i also put in black beans and frozen corn. Add different veggies every time I make it. SUPER EASY this way.

I loved this! I followed exactly as written, including using a fresh diced jalapeno. I did get a bit nervous when the quinoa took longer to cook than I'm used to, but it came out perfect! I too added a can of rinsed and drained black beans. Of course to make it unhealthy, I added a small dollop of sour cream and a teaspoon of shredded cheddar cheese to mine. I doubt the bf will touch it (he's weary of quinoa), but perhaps if I drown his in cheese and sour cream, he just might touch it. Thanks for the recipe!

I Loved this recipe, and it could be used as a main dish or side...here's how. I sauteed, several small sweet peppers along with a red onion, added the quinoa to toast it. After a few minutes a added a full cup of salsa (didn't have the Rotel), also didn't have the taco seasoning, but used 2tsp. of cumin...cook as directed. Once it was done, I topped with a large amount of fresh cilantro, and diced green onions. It's great as a side dish this way...if you want a main dish, add a protein (chicken and black beans or?), top with melted cheese, or add it all together in a burrito. It's also great with diced avocado/sour cream on top.  Thanks so much for this recipe, I made a huge batch!

Delish! Make sure to use low-sodium chicken broth or it will be too salty.

Loved this recipe! It was full of flavor and quite filling. It took a little more time for the quinoa to soak up the liquid but overall it worked really well.

So good! I added a can of black beans (rinsed and drained) and 1 cup of frozen corn. This is the first time I ever made quinoa, and I loved it! Great recipe that I'm sure I'll make again!

Loved it!  First time I cooked quinoa, and I'm now a fan.  This recipe really enhances the quinoa and as usual, I read reviews before making so that I can modify to make it even better!

Delicious, paired this with the spicy garlic like chicken and used it to make tacos on whole wheat wraps! Healthy and delicious.

I love making this quinoa recipe! I use the low sodium taco seasoning and low sodium chicken broth and it comes out wonderful- never too salty! I also add a large can of chunk chicken breast, drained, at the very end. I divide this up in small containers and freeze them. I pull one out in the morning, take it to work and warm for lunch. Makes a perfect protein-packed meal to keep me going all afternoon. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this recipe today with Isreali Couscous. It was delicious! This is a keeper recipe. I will surely use on the regular. The only thing I had to change was the liguid to couscous ratio which was located on the back of the box.

It's awesome. Super easy and very tasty. I used half the packet of taco seasoning. Also, used organic low sodium chicken broth. Reduces the sodium content to a great extent. Overall it's a great recipe. Must try!

Pretty dense & spicier than I was expecting. After eating I was hungry again within an hour. I had added chicken to the meal as well, which I think really helped the dish.

Update: I made this again adding quite a bit of cilantro paste, Italian tomatoes (basil included - which added another level of flavor & toned down the spice) & Latin red beans (Bush's) along with the southwest chicken I threw in last time. This created a heartier meal with a lot of flavor levels. I'll definitely be making this again soon!

This is absolutely delicious!! It is a bit salty, so next time I'll look into a substitute for the taco seasoning. I baked two chicken breasts, shredded them and added them to the recipe when I added the chicken broth. I also used one fresh, large tomato rather than the can of tomatoes with chile peppers. I love it!

I absolutely LOVED the flavor. I followed another review and served it with sour cream and cheddar cheese. My husband even loved it. I used the "hot" rotel so I only used half a jalapeño. My only problem was that the quinoa didn't cook properly. It stayed kind of crunchy. This was my first time cooking quinoa so I'm sure it was my fault and not the recipe.

I made some alterations based on what I had on hand, but this is very good.  Will make again.

My changes, doubled the recipe for a one pot meal,  sauted some chicken with the onions then added the quinoa, and only added 2 cups chicken stock (that's all I had), the rest water and instead of jalepenos I added can of green chilies.  My family loved it and they aren't usually fond of quinoa.

Yum! Quinoa is out of my families comfort zone because I have only made it once (and that was a big fail). I followed the directions this time and it came out delish! I had homemade chicken stock and taco seasoning mix since we have to eat low sodium. I added garbanzo beans the last 5 minutes and fresh spinach after taking it off the burner. Total healthy meal! Hubbie had to add cheese to the top of his and he ate it with tortilla chips, but he two bowls! Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe!

I used triple the amount of quinoa and the same amount of jalapeño and onion because I don't like spicy food. Amazing

Good flavors but way too much liquid for 1 cup of quinoa. I would reduce the chicken stock to less than 1 1/2 cups. (Maybe different brands of quinoa differ in dryness.) know your quinoa and adjust accordingly.  But keep in mind that the canned tomatoes add a lot of liquid.

This was delicious. Added half pound browned ground turkey to mixture after it was done cooking. Then i added mixture to green peppers and baked at 325 for 15 minutes.

This looked good, but this was what I had on hand (& I'm a bit of a lazy cook): quinoa, salsa, taco seasoning, melted cheese topped with favorite toppings (sour cream/ranch, guacamole, etc). Fast, yummy, filling. Thanks for a great inspiration recipe.

We followed this recipe closely, except we only had regular chicken bouillon, and we elected not to add a fresh jalapeño because of a couple sensitive palates in our house. Other than that, we followed the recipe to a tee. There’s so nice way to say it, so I’ll just say it: this is just flat-out inedible. It is extremely salty, and I doubt that’s only because of the chicken stock substitution. Also, a whole packet of taco seasoning proved to be probably 3-4 times more seasoning than would be reasonable. (Are there different sizes of taco seasoning packets, by the way?)  Maybe it’s because of the taco seasoning we used (see picture), which I only chose because it had ingredients I could pronounce (unlike the typical brands like Ortega). Whatever the reason, this was just gross. I gave it two stars instead of one because I didn’t follow the recipe 100% exactly and didn’t choose a typical American taco seasoning, so you get one star’s worth of benefit of the doubt.

Used some dried cilantro because I didn’t have fresh and used some fresh flat leaf parsley. Used regular diced tomatoes because I had fresh certain peppers from the garden. Was spicy!!! We liked it

giving it 4 just because this would have been way too salty with a whole taco seasoning packet...I used a 1/2 packet. but the flavor of this dish was really great and it was super easy to make.

from a 1st time maker of anything with quinoa. Followed the recipe exactly, except left out the jalapeno and used taco seasoning from this site. Loved it even though it was spicier than expected. Will try it with diced chicken next time, or in a burrito. Great and easy recipe. Thank you for expanding my horizon!

So great! Made it tons of times. The kids weren’t so sure they would like it because it looked different than what they usually eat. It’s their favorite dish. It’s the ONLY dish this family of 6 can agree on.

Very yummy. If you don’t like hot, leave out the jalapeño and spice it up with chili powder if needed. I loved it hot and cold. I served it to my Bunco group and they loved it. I had a little left over so I heated it in the microwave and put a fried egg on top. Very good!!

Delicious! I add a can of black beans . Also great with shredded chicken. I’ve even added an over easy egg after plating it, the egg yolk adds a yummy richness!
Fresh ciliantro is a must!

I left out the garlic due to an allergy and I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned.  I wish I had cut down on the jalapeno because this was too spicy for my taste.  It was good though and I'l make it again.  I'll probably follow the advice of other reviewers and add a can of beans when I do.

I made this once because I had some quinoa lying around and I wanted to put it to good use. This is more Tex Mex than Mexican, but it's still very tasty. One thing I did do (besides omit the jalapenos) was add corn and black beans, to give it a more vibrant and tasty look. I'll definitely make it again soon!

(I forgot to mention that I didn't use all the taco seasoning, only half?, and instead of actual chicken broth, used chicken broth seasoning and water.)

This was great!  I made it as a side with tacos,  and we all liked it.  The only change I made was omitting the jalapeno pepper, because my kids would find it too spicy.  Nice and healthier break from traditional Mexican or Spanish rice.

Delicious recipe. First time cooking with jalapeño. Next time I will add only half as it was a bit too spicy for me. Otherwise look forward to making this again!

Never made before so i followed the basic instructions. Pan seared fresh garlic and onion, added yellow and orange peppers and salt.  Instead of taco seasoning i added a blended mix of roasted jalapenos, tomato, onion, garlic  and a squeeze of lemon juice. Added 1 cup of quinoa (rinsed ) and 2 cups of stock. cooked for twenty min on low heat from boil. Came out perfect. Topped with Avocado, fresh cilantro and  bit of lime and dash of salt...

Simple recipe.  I used my own taco seasoning about 1 1/2 tablespoons, and used plain diced tomatoes.  Worked out well.   However, not exactly sure cooking quoina in the skillet without some liquid is a good idea; creates a potential to burn and I had to manage it more closely than I prefer.  Overall, don't  be afraid to experiment with a basic recipe like this one.

I added more chicken broth since I included a can of black beans and shredded chicken. I also used HOT rotel to give it a kick. It was a hit. I'll be making it again.

I make this all the time; it's a staple at my house due to ease of cooking, packing a flavour punch, and flexibility: I add canned red kidney beans, or peaches and cream corn, or even canned tuna to make it into a main if I'm feeling too lazy to cook a main and this. All of it turns out great. I am eternally thankful to this recipe and its poster for saving me a lot of time.

We loved it. It was super simple to throw together. We did replace the olive oil for avocado oil, chicken broth for beef and we didn't have any rotel so we just used two fresh roma tomatoes. But either way, I would imagine it would be delicious.

This is a super tasty and filling dish. It took a while to reduce the liquid so next time I may cut out 1/2 cup of the broth. Added diced chicken to it and it was great!

I added some diced grilled chicken and sliced black olives to make it more of a main dish. I thought using a whole packet of seasoning along with the peppers in the tomatoes had it a touch too spicy for me so I then added a dollop of sour cream to my serving and that made it pretty good. So with some minor modifications thought it was good but not breathtaking.

I halved the recipe and then I added too much taco seasoning. Oops! It was just real spicy. I will make it again and add less spice. 
It tasted good and was a good side to salsa chicken.

Okay... I made mine in my rice cooker.   Sauteed the onion and Quinoa for five minutes, added the garlic and jalepeno for 2 minutes.  Then added the liquid and tomatoes and taco mix (I used Penzey's).  It did take about 2 cook times in the rice cooker, but it turned out very good!!!  Serving it with a pork loin roast tonight, but adding some grilled chicken or even steak would be delicious!!!  Got to give this one a try!!!

Great recipe!!! I made this with fire roasted tomatoes, and homemade taco seasoning from this site. I find it spicy enough without chiles. Also a splash of lime juice and a little lime zest really compliment this side dish well. I will never have Mexican rice again this is so much better!

Very good! I used small sweet peppers instead of jalapenos.  I also added chopped mushrooms with the onion.  I added a can of black beans (rinsed) and a two small cans of chicken (drained) with the tomatoes and broth.  It took a little longer to cook, but it turned out good.  First time to cook with quinoa.

Great tasting and texture. Cut way back on taco seasoning but everything else I did exactly as recipe was written. I plan on adding chicken next time and using as a main dish.

Fantastic! I added some kidney beans, red bell pepper and roasted vegies and topped it w just a bit of sour cream. My husband who claimed he didnt like quinoa has just had 2 helpings. Oh, also used 1 C. vegie broth w 1 C water in place of Chicken broth.

I made this tonight for the first time, as a side dish for burritos, and it was great! I left out the optional jalapeno and didn't top it with fresh cilantro, but we didn't miss them. It's a tasty alternative to Mexican Rice. Tonight I used Original Rotel and it was a little spicy for me and my husband, so next time I'll probably use the Mild Rotel. I'll definitely be making this again! Thanks!

I was looking for something good and this was it. I used my own stewed tomatoes. I followed the rest of the recipe. Browned some ground meat. I put spinach on the bottom, topped with meat and a little cheese then put on the quinoa with extra cilantro and a yogurt salsa. It wAs really delicious!

I made this last night for dinner and really enjoyed it.  It's very similar to a Mexican rice dish that I made, but was better because quinoa is better for you and more filling than rice.  I basically followed the exact recipe, using 2c of quinoa and 3c of broth, rather than the stated amounts.  Otherwise I kept everything the same, including only using one can of tomatoes with chilies because I felt that there was already too much liquid in the pot, and it worked out just fine.  It took a little longer to cook than 15-20min, but I assume that's because I used more quinoa and broth. This is not something that you want to let sit, make sure to give it a stir every few minutes so it doesn't stick to the bottom of your pan. I served this as a side dish with a ground turkey and veg tostada.  For an extra treat, top the quinoa with cilantro, a sprinkle of cheese, and some sour cream.  Yum!

This was a big hit in my house - everyone loved it much more than the Spanish rice I have made.  Very tasty, and this was my first foray into using quinoa.  I will definitely be cooking this again!

Great recipe! I made it according to the directions except I did add a can of drained black beans. We garnished it with green onions, cheese, and Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. Will be making this again. Thanks

Love this recipe!  The flavor is perfect.  And if one vital dummy-proof instruction were included, I'd give it 5 stars.
Be sure to COVER while it simmers, otherwise the liquid will absorb faster than the quinoa will be prepared.  This will lead to a hard texture.  My daughter won this argument as to why she didn't cover the pot.

Yum!  I just got back from a fat lady weekend in Vegas, and was craving some delicious Mexican food.  I wanted something that was going to be an alternative to the traditional heavy and cheesy Mexican, so I searched a Mexican quinoa to sub in for the rice to compliment my Mexican turkey lettuce wraps.  This was delicious and was better than the rice I usually make.  I don't think I'll ever make rice with my Mexican food ever again!  I included the jalapeño, but I think next time I'll add two!  Thanks for posting this recipe!

I prepared dish according to instructions, with the exception of using "no salt added" chicken broth and I used more broth to cook the quinoa longer in order to get it to the consistency I like.  Absolutely a keeper and I agree with other reviews that grilled shrimp would be a nice addition to this dish to take it from a side dish to an entree. The cilantro took it from good to great.

Loved it! Reminded me of Mexican home cooking with a healthier flare.  I did make some changes based on our likes. I used 1 3/4 cup broth instead of the 2 cups.  I didn't have onion so I used onion powder.  Instead of taco seasoning, 1 tsp cumin.  Once I added everything to the pan, I added about 7-8 fresh baby carrots and cilantro.  This allows the cilantro to infuse its flavor while cooking.  The carrots we use in traditional Mexican rice to make it a little sweeter. Don't get me wrong, it's not like sugar but cuts through the spice a bit.  Loved it. Will definitely make again!

This is very similar to the Mexican rice recipe I use. I did not use taco seasoning, but added some garlic salt and ground cumin to the onion and quinoa mixture. Good side dish with rotisserie chicken. I'm learning to eat gluten free, so looking for recipes that use other grains. This is a keeper.

This was really good, but very salty....even using low sodium chicken broth and taco seasoning mix.  Next time I will use half the packet of taco seasoning mix.  Also, it took at least 45 minutes to absorb the water.

I have been looking for new ways to serve quinoa. My family loves taco night and this makes a perfect side dish! Tastes great! My kids who were suspicious of a new food, tried it, and 2 out of 3 really enjoyed it.

This is a great start... I added mushrooms, chili beans, corn and olives - then melted some cheese in just before serving.  I also added a can of tomato paste and some water since I omitted the chicken broth - because that's my preference.  I'm looking forward to experimenting with the base recipe for lots of future meals!

New to quinoa, LOVED this recipe! I added kidney beans (would have preferred black beans but didn't have any), and I dropped a dollop of sour cream on top when serving to the kids.  I will make this again!

I loved this recipe.  I'm new to quinoa, so I've been trying different recipes using it.  This is my favorite so far.  I made this dish with only one change; I left out the jalapena papper.

My husband loved this! He asked if we could have it again the next day. It took a lot longer to absorb all the liquid, like 40 minutes, not 15-20 like the directions say. Didn't have any jalepenos on hand so i added some cayenne pepper to give it heat.
