I was unable to find the shichimi togarashi in my Asian market but I found a recipe online and made my own. The recipe didn't specify so I used shelled edamame since they are easier to eat. This turned out great and is one  I will make again. The shichimi togarashi  packs quite a punch so if heat is not your thing you might want to go easy on it.
