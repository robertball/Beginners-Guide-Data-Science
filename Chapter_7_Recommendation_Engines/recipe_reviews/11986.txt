I haven't tried Peter's recipe, but I make a great tuna pasta which is pretty similar.

First, I would not use spaghetti, fettucine, or linguini.  Try to stick with penne or rotini.  Do not overcook the pasta!

Second, while the pasta is cooking prepare 2 cans (6 oz each) of drained albacore tuna (flaked) in a large bowl.  Use the tuna can to measure the olive oil.  I usually fill it up half way.

Add olive oil to tuna, then salt and pepper to taste.  Mince 4 cloves of garlic in bowl and stir.

When the pasta is done, drain and run under cold water.  Then add pasta to tuna mixture.  Add more salt and pepper.  And 2 more cloves of garlic.

You can eat this cold, or nuke it in the microwave for 2 minutes.

Not too bad for a simple recipe. Didn't have much in my cupboard, but this recipe came out nicely. I didn't have fresh garlic or parsley, but still came out fine with garlic salt and dried herbs. I found that I needed a little more oil, but maybe I had too much pasta. Either way, it was good.

I made this tonight after searching on here for a Tuna recipe.  I made this recipe exactly as written, EXCEPT I used about 9 oz of spaghetti instead of a lb.  It was very very very bland, so I added a ton of pepper, milk, parmesan cheese, and salt.  It was edible but still not at all what I call good, even after I jacked it up.  I DO NOT recommend this recipe, unless you like bland food.

Used two 6-oz cans of tuna. Still produced insufficient sauce for a pound of pasta. Came out rather gluey.

My Mom use to make something like this.  Though she used butter instead of olive oil. I subsituted butter with the amount of oil and added about 4 Tbs. extra. I also added about 2 to 3 Tbs. of lemon juice.  Then added what I had left in the fridge. Some peas, 1/4 c. of milk, about an 1/8 c. of sour cream, 1 oz of cream cheese and 1/2 tsp. of thyme. It was an easy quick recipe that was quite pleasing it's one thats easy to make your own.

This recipe def needed added ingredients but it turned out really good.  I added old bay to taste, half a block of cream cheese, 1 1/4 cup of milk, 1/3 cup sour cream.  Its very simple to make and i had all of the ingredients already at home.

Thanks to Erimess, I made just a 2 serving size of pasta, and this came out great! The flavors blended very nicely. So easy and quick, too!

Not only because of reading prior reviews, but also because it was obvious to me that this was just WAY too much pasta for this recipe, I cut the paste to ONE FOURTH.  And once I did this, it was actually pretty good.  (This of course also means it's only 2 servings.)  I thought the resulting flavor deserved a 4, but I knocked it back because I can see where the original recipe would be *extremely* bland with all that pasta and cutting it by that much was a pretty drastic measure.

I had very high expectations for this recipie and it really let me down. First off it gets very dry near the end and the pasta is hard to mix with the sauce so you have to add a lot more oil and water. Also, WARNING: Cooking tuna in a pan makes it smell and taste very VERY Fishy. Half-way through i didnt even want to eat it was so fishy smelling, and I like fish. I doubled the garlic and onion even before I put in the tuna and you cant even taste it. The fishy smell and taste overcomes it all, I would not recommend this recipie to anyone.

This was very good!  Husband had a HUGE plate.  Excellent if you don't want a mushy, soupy casserole.  After reading the reviews, I eyeballed about 4 servings of spaghetti to cook, not sure what that amounted to weight-wise.  For a little something extra, I threw some green beans in with the tuna; broccoli/peas would probably be good too.

The recipe was bland to my taste, so I added a can of cream of mushroom soup, and some brocolli to the dish and it give a very creamy sauce.

This was pretty good. I used whole wheat pasta, half margarine and half olive oil, and I doubled the amount of garlic and parmesan cheese. I didn't care for the texture of the cooked tuna, so next time I will add it to the pasta with the parsley and cheese. I also think it would be better if you added some lemon juice.

This is the second time I've made the recipe (trying to replicate pasta al tonno that we had in Italy). Both times, the pasta seems to be on the bland side. This time I was careful to make sure 2 cloves of garlic and actually more than the 1/2  chopped onion. My kitchen smelled wonderful and by the time I added the pasta (I used rotini) everything was bland. I just noticed Jeankat's review and the next time I make this, I'm following her recipe!

I should have read the other reviews first, instead I just looked at the stars. :/ I followed the recipe as written except I also added some frozen peas, and ended up with a bland, gluey product. It really does need to be doctored up with some more ingredients. Disappointing because it seemed like it was going to be a tasty meal with ingredients that I had on hand, and super easy. Oh well.
