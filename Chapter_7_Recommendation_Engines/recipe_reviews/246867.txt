Best Chicken Parm I've had.  I didn't mess with the recipe...imagine that:)  however, they list cayenne pepper as an ingredient, but don't specify the measurement.  I went with a pinch and didn't feel it...next time 3 pinches.  Great dish but a lot of work all at once.

I've made all 3 of Chef John's Chicken Parm's, and this one is my favorite. Only change I made was to use italian seasoned panko bread crumbs, which I highly recommend.

The dish takes too long to make, and the crust was kinda of too thick.  The chicken was not done in 10 minutes in the oven either so by the time it was done, the crust was kinda burnt.  Not worth all the effort.  Neither my hubs or I cared for this dish.

This was amazing! My new go-to chicken parm!  I used 3 chicken breasts and didn't change the other quantities (except more pasta sauce) and it worked out great.  Rao's Tomato Basil sauce was delish in this recipe.

I didn't have any cheddar handy, so I used mozzarella and pepper jack. I also had Italian panko crumbs instead of plain.  It still turned out great!  I also used your plating recommendation from the video to keep the underside from getting soggy.

Oh my goodness!  I didnâ€™t change a thing.  The chicken was so tender, the coating was seasoned perfectly and the cheese topping was out of this world.  Nicely done Chef John.  I will look for more of your recipes. He husband says this will be a staple in our household

First, whoever determined this dish would be in ready 34 minutes must have been on something. It took me 1 hr 40 minutes from the time I started.
Second, the dish was ok, but I prefer mozzarella rather than ricotta. And I never heard of cheddar in chicken Parmesan.
Third, the recipe was incomplete. It tells you mix the cheese together and put half on the chicken. And that's it. Nothing about what to do with other half. 
I won't be making this again

We loved it! It took a little longer on the oven to bring it up to proper temp but in Colorado at a mile high that is pretty common. I added spaghetti and I did top it with sauce for my preference. We ate it all even the kids.

I'm a newbie to cooking. I did this recipe for me and my woman. I didn't add the cayenne because I must have missed it in the ingredients list. It all went together easily.  I did have to cook it a couple  minutes longer than expected which made the outside a little darker than I thought it should be. might be the Colorado altitude. It tasted amazing! Better than what I've had at a restaurant. We both loved it.

I thought was relatively easy and super delicious. I had enough vegetable oil so had to use that instead of olive oil...tasted good to me, but presumably will be better next time with the right oil. Thanks for another keeper!

It was delicious but I made a few changes. First, I fileted the chicken into smaller pieces, dipped in egg and bread crumb then baked it. I sprayed the baking pan with Pam and drizzled EVOO on top of the chicken before baking to retain moisture. Cooked at 400 for 30 minutes. I also used grated mozzarella instead of cheddar, added salt and pepper and little dried parsley and parmesan. I then topped each piece with the mixture and topped each piece with sauce, not much just enough to cover the cheese mixture. I baked at 375 degrees for about 20 imnutes.

I had to use a bit of gruyere instead of cheddar, so it might not be fair to criticize, however...I do prefer regular chicken parm with mozzarella and not ricotta

I reviewed this previously but wanted to stress that it really is an easy recipe. I don't cook a lot but a beginner can do this and it tastes great. Everyone in the family loves it. Will make it often.

This was a big hit with the family. The Cheddar cheese gave it a little extra zip that you don't usually get with normal type chicken parm made with mozzarella. I will definitely make this one again.

This was delicious. The only typo I noticed was that though the directions say to add cayenne pepper, it's not listed in the ingredients. I used 1/8 tsp for my first try, but I think I'd add 1/4 tsp the next time. The only thing I added was some chopped fresh basil to the parsley at the end.

Not very hard at all and it tastes fabulous. I used 3 medium sized chicken breasts because I had to serve 3 and it worked fine.

I thought this was very good but not any better than my other chicken parm recipes.

Too much work I think. The end result was ok.
