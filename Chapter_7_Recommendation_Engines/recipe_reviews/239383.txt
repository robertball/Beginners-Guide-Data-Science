The recipe is a very basic chili recipe that you can add to and season as you wish.
I live in Canada, we don't have chili beans, I used 1 can each no salt kidney and black beans rinsed and drained and 16 oz homemade baked beans in tomato sauce.
I added 1/2 a green pepper and 3 stalks of celery that I had that needed to be used up.
The tomatoes I had were fire roasted.
For seasoning I used 2 tbsps chili powder, 1 tsp each garlic powder, onion powder and cumin,  and 1/4 tsp each salt and pepper.
I only needed about half the tomato paste and added about 1/2 cup of water to make it a bit saucier but it was still nice and thick.
I chose this recipe because my son doesn't like really tomato-ey chili or chili that has "weird" stuff in it.
I made this for the April Allrecipes Allstars Canada challenge #ARFaceless
