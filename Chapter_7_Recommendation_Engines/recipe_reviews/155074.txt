I was looking for a fried pork chop recipe that was different than what I normally use and found this. I made this for dinner tonight and it was great! The only thing I changed was that I fried them in a mid/high heat and then baked them for the remaining time. We tend to like our chops a bit more done. It was nice and crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Yum! Thank you!!!

I used Bisquick instead of flour.  I doubled the spices (paprika & garlic powder).  I also added a tablespoon of salt to the breading since I had no crushed crackers.  I used 1/2 inch pork chops and fried 2 minutes per side.  No baking.  These came out super moist and tasty.  I served the pork chops with rice and broccoli.  This was a quick and tasty supper!

This was really great! Both my kids ate it! I added some pepper and chili powder to the flour mixture. I put both the dry combination's in large baggies and shook them, instead of using bowls. I could only fit three pork chops in my iron skillet, so I only put in 1 cup of oil. For those of you who had problems, if the oil is too hot, the outside of the pork will cook faster than the inside. If the breading of falling off, that probably means you don't have enough oil. When you're frying, you can't skimp on the oil! Thank you for posting this. We had a lovely dinner tonight!

I actually tried this last night and, while it was good, great even, it didn't really have the kick I'm looking for.  I'll play around with the seasonings and see if I can get some flavor-induced spiciness out of it.

I Love this recipe, the pork was tender while the coating was nice and crispy, just how we like it in our home. The only thing I would do, is add more seasoning to the flour coating and maybe add a little more on the one side as I brown it in the pan, As we do like a lot of spices on everything.    And since I like my husbands meals hot when he walks through the door, I browned them first and finished them off in the oven.  (in case of traffic issues making him late)  Thank you so much harperfamiy, for sharing this with us. I will be making this often and will be trying the coating on chicken next time.

I bought 4 packages of pork loin boneless rib chops (15) for a great deal and wanted to try a breaded fried recipe.  I only cook fried food maybe once a year.  This was it.   I started with most of the original ingredients, though I didn't have saltine crackers or potato flakes.    In the first bowl I increased the flour for the additional 11 chops (2 cups was plenty)  added powdered sage, cumin, brown sugar, powdered cinnamon, ground red pepper, and increased all other original ingredients by sight.  No change to the milk and two eggs bowl.   In the cracker bowl I started with fancy herb and garlic crackers, some ritz knockoffs, added crunchy honey oats cereal and some bran flakes cereal, all crushed.  As I tried one chop with the crackers and one with just the flour seasoning and egg I decided the chops with crackers where definitely better. I added some chil powder to the cracker cereal mix to give it what I thought it was missing.  I did turn the heat down to medium and flipped at about 4.5 minutes per side to get the right color crust (used canola oil)  So here I am with 13 fantastic chops at 2AM, I'm not hungry after the first two.  Tomorrow I'll do a chicken gravy and rice dish to go along with it and hook up the neighbors and girls at work.  Thanks Becca for a great recipe.  I'm giving it 5 stars because it inspired my additions and it came out tender and juicy. - Dale

Had about 8 thin cut boneless chops wanting to braise with peppers and balsamic vinegar, DW halted that and requested  my fried chops, her favorite. Well who am I to say no to my love. In an effort to get away from traditional Italian breaded I found this recipe and decided to give it a try. Let me just say that supper was a big hit. Only thing I did different was to use ritz crackers  cause no saltines and added a little herbs di Provence to the flour with s&p. Made some peppered country gravy with the cooking oil and flour to make a rue and used some chicken stock and milk. DW says this is a keeper for sure.  Chops were tender and juicy, didn't even need a knife with just the right amount of crispness. Note to others,  be sure you have enough oil  this more like deep frying your chops should almost float and be sure of temp. I used 3/4 inches of oil at setting 7 on electric range and they were perfect  golden brown. Thank you for sharing recipe, I  just sorry didn't get pics, will post next time.

There wasn't much flavor in the breading, even though I added some chili powder and a bit more paprika and garlic powder. Frying them for 5 minutes on each side made them very dark brown, while the meat was still pink inside. So I threw them in the oven like another reviewers suggested, which made the juices run out and got the bottoms soggy. By the time we sat down to eat, the breading was falling off the meat, even on the top. My fiance liked them, but he's not picky. Don't know that I will be making these again.

great recipe!  i made these for the hubby and kids last night and they both really enjoyed them.  i followed the recipe exactly, and my only hesitation in giving this a 5 star rating is the need to increase the spices - next time i would at least double the seasonings to give the breading more flavor.  otherwise, the coating turns very crispy and this recipe is super easy to make.  i added a homemade white peppered gravy and served with mashed poatoes.  this is a keeper for us!

Wowza...  these were really yummylicious!  I used bone in chops and pounded (the meat, not the bone!) to tenderize.  To the reviewers who found it lacking in the spice dept, I added some Sririca to the egg wash, and also sprinkled them with some of my house seasoning (1 tsp each cayenne & black pepper plus a tbsp salt) before tossing them in the flour. Comfort food, y'all!

LOVE LOVE LOVE. I have never made pork chops so crunchy and juicy! I have repeatedly tried to bake a crunchy pork chop but always ended up w/a soggy bottom. The "frying" was perfect. Used 2 pork chops and no potato flakes, instead used butter crackers & panko crumbs. BUT I look foward to trying the tater flakes since the cracker/panko crumbs were sooooo delicious! I also fried 2.5 min on each side then 1 more min each side. THANK YOU for such a great recipe! I can't wait to tweek it w/additional spices :)

Good recipe!  Besides using thick pork loin chops I add a knob of butter to olive oil for frying and whiz the saltines in a food processor. The pork stayed tender and juicy yum!

I liked this recipe but found it lacking in something?  It may not be fair to rate it just 3 stars as I may have under seasoned the meat before I applied the recipe?  Anyway, the egg wash was a nice touch but I might suggest marinating your meat in something, perhaps "Dale's" seasoning before applying the flour, etc.  I really like this recipe so I'll give it another try soon.

This is so easy to make. The batter stuck beautifully, the cooking was super quick at only 12 minutes for a chop and my family ate it all! I served with mashed potatoes and gravy plus green beans and it was nothing less than a southern soul food dish!

I made these with boneless chops  and added a little Creole to spice them up. While they were frying I added a pat of butter to each one for additional flavor and they were some of the juiciest most tender chops we have ever had. We decided that this is definitely a keeper recipe.

I've made this a number of times and my husband loves it! Only thing I change is substituting honey Graham crackers for the saltines. I've made both ways but we prefer the subtle sweetness the graham crackers adds.

I'm retired now but I sold food most of my life. This is an excellent recipe and I'm encouraging people to try it as everyone's taste are different. It had a little to much breading for me. TRY IT YOU MAY LOVE THIS RECIPE.

Remember, if you use thicker pork chops, you may want to fry them a little longer than 5 minutes unless you like a little pink in your pork.

I'm not very good at pork chops, so when I got "these are really good" from my family, I was impressed. I used the loaded mashed potato flakes (flavored with sour cream, bacon & cheese) which gave it a little more flavor.

If you don't like this, you are doing it wrong.  Add some spices if you like it!  When I make chicken using this method, I use those chicken in a biscuit crackers.  You can use any kind of cracker you want!   This is soooo good!  The potato flakes really make this great!

Very simple but delicious recipe.  My family LOVED it.  I cut the pork into approx. 1 to 1 1/2" slices before coating, like you would when making Chicken-Fried Steak Fingers, which is more "kid friendly" then Chops.

I made a small batch, so I didn't use the proportions called for, but we really loved the crunchy breading. I knew pork needs alot of seasonings, so I season the chops also (before the flour.) I will bake mine after browning next time also, using a rack to keep them crispy. Great recipe, thanks!

I had no potato flakes so I used a whole sleeve of Ritz crackers...other than that I followed it exactly. I thought they looked amazing...but I agree with most everyone else that they needed more spices & flavor. I will definitely use this recipe again & add more spices! I would've given it a 5 but it's a little bland for my taste & needs just a little more flavor...but the overall recipe made my pork chops look AMAZING! I will for sure try this for country fried steak!

This was my second time making this dish.  So quick and easy.  The pork chops are always moist inside.  This time  I added some cheez-it crackers just to change it up.  Still tasted great.

These are great pork chops. Served with country gravy and some mash and you can't go wrong. For those who ended up soggy, not enough oil or oil not quite hot enough before putting chops in.  I used a nice thick chop  and they were loved by all!

These were the best pork chops I've ever had.  I used very thick boneless chops and had to cook them much longer than 5 minutes per side but they were still very tender and juicy.  The coating made them very tasty too.

My husband loved it! I always know when he's happy with a new recipe when he gives a thumbs up and says "Do over!" I made it as it was written with 3 chops and I felt that even with 4 it would have been a waste of a lot of breading so I will cut it in half next time. I also used smoked paprika in the dredge. I think that next time I will also use buttermilk as opposed to the milk/egg mixture to give it a little more tang. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

My family LOVED this; tender, crispy and delicious.  There was more than enough of the coating to prepare 8 chops; I froze 4 and cooked 4.  The frozen chops cooked up beautifully after being frozen.  The two things that I would do differently is to add a fair amount of salt and pepper to the potato flake/crushed cracker coating, to give it some additional flavor and I found it necessary to cut the chops into medallions while frying them, because the inside was still raw and the outside was getting too brown.  The leftovers were even better, so make extra and enjoy!

I made it! It was okay. Coating stayed on great which gave it a nice crunch. Think the seasonings should have been a little more to bring out the flavor more , next time!

Just recently made this recipe
I was a bit skeptical since  pork chops are so tricky to cook
They either come out dry, under cooked
But this came out perfect
So tasty , juicy . I will be making this again
Even my picky daughter ate it

Made this tonight.  After reading the reviews it needed a bit more spice  I put a dry brown sugar spicy rub on it and let it sit for 15-20 minutes then followed the recipe .  Lots of flavor.

very good but changed recipe to use Ritz cheese crackers which deflects oil from getting into meat-same as I use for pickerel and perch-sometimes shrimp-does not work on ocean fish-also add tablespoon of the Keg steak spice-try this-think you will like it.

Yummmm! I used Bisquick instead of the potato stuff in the third dipping step. I could've used a bit more of a kick, but overall it's a keeper.

Without a doubt the best breaded pork chops I have made. I made them exactly per the recipe but fried them in a nonstick pan using a little coconut oil. I only needed about 4 tablespoons for them to come out  tender and golden brown.

I didn't have any Paprika, after looking online for a stable substitution , I used little Cayenne Pepper.  Also, I didn't have any Saltines so i used Panko Lemon Pepper bread crumbs I did have.   I served it with brown gravy, sauteed onions, corn, and mac n cheese.   It was a huge hit for not only my Husband but, also with my picky tween daughter!

We loved this recipe. We had extra thick pork chops that were on sale. I was concerned if the coating would get done faster than the meat but everything turned out very good. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I made this almost exactly as written. Only change was that I threw in a package of jalapeño shredded cheese to the food processor when making the saltine cracker mixture. Hubby was over the moon!! Thank you for the great recipe!!!!

So I was afraid I messed up because I forgot to poke holes with the fork in the chops before breading and frying but they turned out great. Secondly this makes a TON of stuff, for 4 chops I'm pretty sure you could safely half the recipe. Thirdly I didn't have any potato flakes so I used bread crumbs as others did. Lastly I did the flour, egg bath, flour again, egg again and finally into the cracker mixture. Yummy!!

my husband can be picky about the choices I make for his favorite meats but this one had him in a happy food comma :)  will make again.  Oh and when I cook I tend to overcook.  He commented that it was juicy and cooked perfectly.  I say its the batter that made it so. 
the only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is the work involved in making it.
