I used Cooking White Wine because that's all I had and it was very good. What would have taken it over the top would be one of the wines listed in the ingredients. I know I've seen Cooking Sherry and Cooking Marsala in the past which could be used if you don't drink wine. It netted 12 servings for me. I wouldn't hesitate to make this again.
