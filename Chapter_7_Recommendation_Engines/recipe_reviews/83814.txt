I'm honored to give the first review of this fabulous recipe! These cupcakes were simple to make and came out so moist and flavorful. I ended up with 30 of the best cupcakes I've ever had. My family and coworkers called them fabulous but I call them evil....cause I can't stop eating them! I used the Chocolate Frosting 1 recipe that I found on this site. I highly recommend this one, you won't be disappointed.

Wow!! I didn't expect to like these as much as I do.  They're not to sweet and they are moist.  I did make some changes as suggested by other reviews and some of my own.  I used all natural peanut butter, used 1/2 apple sauce and 1/2 oil no shortening, and used 1 cup whole wheat flour and the balance in all-purpose.  These are definately a keeper!!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!

Yum!  After reading through some other reviewers' suggestions I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup apple sauce in place of the shortening.  And by accident, I only used 1 cup of brown sugar.  I didn't notice a lack of sweetness by any means; perhaps the sweetness in the applesauce balanced this out.  The cupcakes came out moist with a delicious peanut butter flavor, not overpowering.  I frosted them with milk chocolate frosting and my peanut butter-loving fiance said they were "the best food" he has ever had!  I put about 10 of the cooled cupcakes (w/o frosting) in a ziplock bag and froze them.  To thaw, simply take cupcakes out of the bag about 45 minutes before you want to eat them.  Tasted so fresh and moist!  I will definitely make these again.

These turned out great! As per one of the user comments, I added chopped reese peanute butter cups to it. I also iced it with chocolate ganache and added a couple of reeses pieces on top.
I followed the reciped for 24 servings but it yielded 32 regular sized cupcakes. 
They wered delish! And even more so after 6-8 hours. So I would recommend making them in the morning for the evening or allowing them to sit overnight.

Excellent, however I would advise against not using cupcake papers. I opted to grease the first batch with shortening, disaster, they are so moist that the bottoms stuck to holder.

I absolutely love these. So does my husband. Had to use oil in leiu or shortening but everything else is the same. I used Adams natural peanut butter for a strong flavor. I've made these three times in the past week! They're great with chocolate buttercream frosting.

Wow!  These turned out perfectly.  They rose beautifully and had a very intense peanut butter flavor.  I chopped up some Reese's peanut butter cups I had sitting in the fridge and added that to the batter before spooning into the tins. Once they were baked and cooled I frosted these pretty cupcakes with my own milk chocolate buttercream.  Yummmm.  Thanks for this great recipe!

These were so delicious - I probably gained about 3 pounds just from eating them every day (about 2-3).  I used store-bought chocolate icing on top since I love peanut butter with chocolate.  The only complaint I have is that they were very crumbly (messy) and I stuck to the recipe.  They could have been a little more moist too.  Maybe I'll try them with oil next time (as that's a secret many bakeries use).  Thanks so much - I'll be making them again.

Very good cupcakes! Taste fine alone but I love frosting! This is my favorite recipe for peanut butter frosting: 1 c. powdered sugar, 3 T. softened butter, 1/2 c. peanut butter, and 2.5 T. milk or cream.

I have many years of experience with baking, and this is the first time I wanted to throw the end product away.  First, there was too much batter for 24 cupcakes.  I had to fill them too full, causing them to spill over the cupcake liners.  Second, they did not raise like cupcakes should; they came out of the oven flat.  Third, I had to bake them about 15 minutes longer than the recipe stated in order for them to be fully baked.  Fourth, when I tried to remove them from the pan, the tops (that were baked out over the liners) just fell off.  They tasted okay, but not good enough to make again, even if I wouldn't have had the above-mentioned problems.  I dont' understand how this recipe got such good ratings.  I rely on the ratings to decide which recipes I will try.  This was certainly a dud!  I'm really miffed that I wasted my ingredients and my time!

I used Skippy Peanut Butter and ended up with 1 Â½ cup of peanut butter. I also used fresh buttermilk for the milk called for in the recipe. The batter consistency was thick yet fluffy. I filled 24 cupcake liners almost to the top and baked them at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. They rose up beautifully filling up my house with a wonderful peanut-y aroma. They baked up a round golden brown top shape, some with slight cracks. The cupcakes do not overflow while baking, they hold their shape well. I did not find a problem with the cupcakes sticking to the paper liner.  The ingredients, directions, baking time were spot on! I liked that it yielded exactly 24 cupcakes just as recipe states. The cupcake top was borderline hard more like a muffin. With my first bite I noticed the cupcakes were moist, fresh tasting, not dry, but light and fluffy. There is a good peanut-y flavor, but not overpowering and not too sweet. Thou I wouldnât have minded a stronger peanut butter flavor (personal preference). To finish the cupcakes I frosted them with, âRich Chocolate Frosting,â also from this website, onto the cupcakes. I sent these off with hubs to share with his coworkers.

Amazingly delicious! These cupcakes taste like fluffy peanut butter cookies. You must use OIL instead of shortening to make them very moist. Don't even try using shortening. It made about 32 cupcakes. Some were slightly cracked like cookies on the top, and to prevent that I recommend baking them spread out (6 cupcakes per 12-cup muffin tin).

These were really good! As suggested I did 1/2 cup veg. oil and 1/2 cup applesauce and did away with shortening. I was afraid these were going to turn out more like a muffin but was pleasantly surprised!! They are VERY moist. I frosted with whipped chocolate frosting and they taste just like a reeses! I did want to mention to fill the cups up almost all the way (they don't expand a whole lot...) but besides that, very good and will be keeping my altered recipe!

These cupcakes came out great - I love the recipe!  What a nice change from boxed cake mixes to make cupcakes!  I'm having a hard time deciding whether to pipe in a jelly filling, or use chocolate (or both?).  For high altitude, I added 1/4 cup extra flour (because box cake mixes always say to do that), and I also added an egg white for extra "fluffiness" - because I like to do that.  I ended up with 30 cupcakes using about 1/4 cup batter per cupcake paper.

Doubled the recipe and got 60 cupcakes. Used a bit more peanut butter and a bit less shortening than called for - wanted more peanut butter flavor and I got it!  Frosted w/ chocolate buttercream frosting and topped with 1/4 of a smallish peanut butter cup - not the regular "big" size and not the miniatures either. (Only place I've seen this size  was Walmart and they were 8/$1.) Baked them in the morning and frosted them in the afternoon; ate them the following day and they were VERY well received.  (Made an equal number of red velvet cupcakes - these peanut butter ones were most popular with the kids and the RV with the adults - interesting, tho I suppose not surprising.)

These cupcakes were better than average, but I didn't taste the peanut butter at all and I used skippy natural. I sifted the flour twice and made sure to NOT overbake. The BEST part was the reeses cup I placed in the middle before baking. What a nice surprise! I topped with chocolate fudge icing. If I make them again I will add MORE peanut butter than 1 cup...

Wow!  These cupcakes are great!  I followed the recipe except increased the peanut butter to 1 1/2 cups and used oil instead of shortening.  I filled the cupcake liners 2/3 full and was rewarded with 24 medium/large yummy cupcakes just like the picture.  I baked mine for 17 minutes.  Great recipe!

Im sure these can be great cupcakes, I just liked the idea of Peanutbutter cause we love peanutbutter cookies and peanutbutter cups. I really thought these were bland. Like a couple of others, I could alter the recipe but then it's a whole different recipe. I wish the others all the best, these were just not for us.

I was so excited to try this recipe, especially with all the rave reviews.  I have been cooking and baking for over 40 years so I'm no beginner and did nothing wrong, but apparently my tastes (and my family's) are just much different than almost everyone on here.  Because these were terrible! I really don't understand what everyone liked about these.  But I just had to write a review, because although I rarely do, I felt that someone might be saved the time and trouble to make these.  Yuck.  Almost no taste and consistency was terrible.
My only regret was that after trying a bite and then throwing them all in the garbage that I could have thrown them out to the squirrels in my backyard at least, but too late.

These were excellent and moist, following the recipe without changes. I did frost with canned chocolate frosting and while the frosting was still sticky, dropped some Reese pieces on top for decoration. It was a total hit for a graduation party. Teachers liked them too. Perfect for a kid or teen party.

The very best thing about these amazingly light cupcakes is that the recipe is so flexible! I used almond butter, and WOW! Other substitutes were butter instead of shortening and rice milk for my milk. I used a light brown sugar, and organic vanilla. Baby boy turns ONE tomorrow, and these will be his precious first cake. I made them for friends & family & plan to serve them just as they are right now--not a smear of frosting necessary--yum, yum, yum!! I think I'll have a hard time keeping him to just one...or two...or three. Since it's his first nut product, that's another reason I used almond, but mostly just because we were out of PB! Organic, though. Organic almond butter & butter, etc...

Very delicious and unique cupcake!  I substituted creamy almond butter for the peanut butter due to my husband's peanut allergies, and it tasted great.  I also used 1/4 c apple sauce and 1/4 c canola oil for the shortening as others had suggested, as well as 1.5 tsp lemon juice to the batter instead of cream of tartar (which I didn't have).  Tastes great with whole wheat flour if you prefer.  I sprinkled the cupcakes with powdered sugar and it was a very tasty dessert.  Will definitely make again, and  I will probably try it with chocolate icing or glaze as others have suggested!  I used cooking spray instead of greasing/flouring or using liners, and the cupcakes came out easily.

I made this plus 4 other cupcakes from this site for a fund raiser at work topped with store bought fudge frosting and half of a peanut butter cup.  This was the first one to sell out with people looking for more.  I just made them again and topped with peanut butter frosting (1 tub of vanilla store bought frosting and 3/4 cup PB and 1 TBS of milk) and they were AMAZING.  I am not a chocolate freak so these have to one of the best cupcakes ever.  They will be moist as long as you DO NOT over bake.  My only change was to use oil instead of shortening.

Excellent cupcakes! They baked up beautifully and taste lovely. Suprisingly light and fluffy and a big hit with everyone. I frosted with chocolate frosting and then drizzled with Peanut Butter Glaze from this site. I did use butter instead of shortening. Thank you! :)

These taste really good, but I also came out with very flat cupcakes, so that was disappointing. I also had a hard time getting them to cook all the way through. They were either raw or slightly burned, even with the temperature turned down.

Oh my, these are dangerous because they are sooo good!  I followed the recipe except did 1/4 shortening and 1/4 oil since some people suggested oil and I didn't really want to change the recipe. I added dark chocolate kissables (the little candy coated kisses) so some of the cupcakes and those were the best! They got soft and really added to the flavor and who can resist chocolate and peanut butter together? The cupcakes with the kissables in them didn't even need frosting! My chicklets were in heaven with these! They'll be wanting them again.

I was so excited to make these for work...and home.  The batter was tart.  I hoped that after baking they would be ok.  Nope, these almost had no taste whatsoever.  Put frosting on, hoping that is what they were missing.  Nope.

Very good recipe.  I followed exactly as stated but did add a bit more peanut butter to really bring out the flavor.
Since they are so sweet, instead of icing, I topped with a shot of whipped cream, drizzled with caramel sauce and sprinkled with some chopped peanuts.  Beautiful!

Made these a few weeks ago and turned out great. I did not alter the repice at all.  Made a second batch and only filled the cups half full then put in a spoon of grape jelly in some and raspberry jam in others then topped up with more batter.  Had a couple of bananas that had seen a better life so smooshed them up and did the same - adding a spoon full to some of the cupcakes.  What a pleasant surprise for those biting in for the first mouthful.  No frosting but just a drizzle of glaze for a bit of decoration.  These were plenty sweet and plenty tasty without icing.  No one knew what "centre" they were getting so each cupcake was a pleasant surprise.  This will be a keeper  but will have to experiment with applesauce in place of the shortening - especially as there is an OVER ABUNDANCE of apples at my house.  Canned applesauce is filling the shelves and if it works in this recipe will be put to good use this fall and winter.

No amount of adjusting, adding, etc. could make these worthy of more than three stars. Hardly any peanut butter flavor (tried Peter Pan and Skippy natural, ), tasted the flour more than anything, bland to say the least. I dumped a couple handfuls of chocolate chips in my last batch to try to salvage them...nope.

Really enjoyed these and were easy to make. I did make a couple changes based on what I had available, vegetable oil instead of shortening and cinnamon instead of cream of tartar. Still turned out great.

Excellent!  These were a real hit at work potluck.  Made two changes, and they still turned out great.  I used veg. oil instead of shortening, and I omitted the cream of tarter, because I didn't have any.  I frosted them with the Chocolate Frosting I, that I found on A.R.  Yummy!  Give them a try, you won't be sorry!

Ok I just made these and put a chocolate peanut butter frosting on them. They are WONDERFUL.. I bake a lot so I try to never have more than 1 cupcake or a few bites of cake etc just to watch my diet however you can't eat just one of these.  They are so yummy. I only had 1 1/2 bups brown sugar so I had to use 1/2 white sugar with it as well and it was still GREAT!! Thumbs up, I will make these often.. Thanks for sharing..

This recipe is fantastic!! The only thing I changed was I used natural crunchy peanut butter, added milk chocolate chips, Nutella for the icing and topped it off with a singular peanut butter chip. These were a hit with my family and friends. Delicious goodness for the peanut butter lovers.

Delicious. I used 1/4 cup shortening + 1/4 cup oil (instead of a full 1/2 cup of shorteniing), and a "heaping" cup of peanut butter after reading a bunch of the other reviews, and they turned out perfectly with exactly 24 cupcakes and a 20-21 minute baking time. They have plenty of peanut butter flavour.

I will ice them with a combination of chocolate and peanut butter icing.

I modified the recipe for high altitude (I live at 7500 elev., so I always need to reduce sugar and leavening, and increase flour and liquid.)  I made them with butter instead of shortening.  The cupcakes were awesome!  I went a different route and made PB&J cupcakes. I hollowed out the cupcake, and put strawberry jam in some and grape jam in some. I made a peanut butter cream cheese frosting with 1/2 cup peanut butter, two bricks of cream cheese, a teaspoon of vanilla, 3 tablespoons milk, and about a cup and a half of powdered sugar.  I then put a drop of strawberry jam on the strawberry filled cupcakes, and a drop of grape jam on the grape filled cupcakes.  They were outrageous.  Way beyond anything I could have imagined.  Thanks for the recipe. I will try the cupcakes with chocolate frosting or chocolate ganache another time.

I don't know what I did wrong!  Mine didn't come out anything like a cupcake.  They tasted like muffins.  They looked just like the picture.  The peanut butter flavor was good, but they weren't moist and light like a cupcake.  If you want a muffin, this is a good recipe.  If you want a moist, light cupcake, this isn't for you.  Sorry...

Reduced sugar by 1/2 cup, but added 1/2 cup white chocolate chips. Tasty, but "sank," causing holes in the muffins. Used 1/2 coconut oil & 1/2 applesauce in place of shortening.

I was really dissapointed.  I made these cupcakes(sub oil instead of shortening and added 1/2 extra cup peanut butter)  The cupcakes were bitter and tasted more like flour than peanut butter.  You couldn't taste the peanut butter at all.  The best part of the cupcake was the hershey kiss I put in the middle.  Very very dissapointing.........still looking for a peanut butter cupcake recipe.

I cut this recipe in half to yield 12 cupcakes.  As much as I thought my peanut butter loving kids would love these cupcakes, they just didn't.  If it weren't for the fact that I topped these with Caroline's Chocolate Frosting (from this site), most of these would have gone to waste.  They are really lacking in peanut butter flavor, and while they aren't dry, they are crumbly.  Even with the relatively low amount of shortening (1/4 cup for 12 cupcakes), combined with the peanut butter, these have an almost greasy texture.  Sorry, these won't be a repeat in this house.

I enjoyed eating my Peanut Butter cupcakes! I filled them with a thin white icing and topped them off with a icing that included grape jelly. My siblings and parents really them as well. My only change was to use crunchy peanut butter, instead of regular peanut butter. But overall, an excellent recipe!

I made these cupcakes and they came out AMAZING!  My father, who doesn't eat sweets, asked for not only one but THREE. I filled some of them with grape jelly.  I also topped some with marshmello frosting, some with chocolate frosting, some with nutella spread and left the rest plain.  I highly reccommend this recipe and I know I will be making these a lot more!

I followed the recipe exactly and the cupcakes came out good. They were thicker than traditional cupcakes due to the peanut butter, but very good. This was a big hit with the kids.

These cupcakes are awesome! I made it according to the recipe (and added chocolate chips) and ended up with 32. They were perfect with a glass of milk. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

These were delicoius, with alot peanut butter flavor, but not too much sweetness. Probably not the healthiest breakfast, but a delicious one, no doubt.  Plus, the recipe makes a ton, and they were good for freezing for later.  Super easy!

I made them exactly as the recipe directed. Initially, I didn't like them very much. The outside was hard and the peanut butter taste wasn't very noticeable. I thought the recipe was a dud. However, the next day, and now today, I have to say the texture and flavor have actually improved. I've got them stored in a plastic storage box tightly closed with chocolate frosting on them and now they are perfect. So I would say they improve after a day or 2 if tightly stored.

These cupcakes are so light and airy! I was expecting a richer peanut butter flavor so next time I'll add some peanut butter chips to the batter. Thank you for the yummy recipe!

I followed all the directions accordingly. We did not care for them at all. They left a strange taste in my mouth. My husband and I each had one, and didn't eat the rest. Dissapointed.

Good cupcakes with just the right amount of peanut butter (used Adam's natural).  I did half veg. oil/half applesauce instead of the shortening and they came out nice and moist.  I frosted them with "rich chocolate frosting" from this website.

If I could rate these 4.5 stars, I would. I've made them twiceâonce as written and once replacing the shortening with oil (I used grapeseed because it's tasteless). Why the switch? I always find that any cake or cupcake other than pound cake or some other dense cake is lighter, moister and fluffier when I use oil. I generally use butter for all my other baking, but oil seems to work best for me in cakes and cupcakes. These taste great topped with Rich Chocolate Frosting (add some peanut butter) and topped with a teeny, tiny PB cup (I buy them at trader joes). Everyone loves these. xoxo

These were pretty good. I think this is probably as much peanut butter flavor as you're likely to get in a cake.  I found the sugar level appropriate, but added more salt (about a teaspoon) and I'm glad I did. I subbed more PB for the shortening, since commercial PB is basically shortening and peanuts.  You definitely need an electric beater for this, and don't expect to incorporate much air. I think that's why a lot of folks reported not much rise--with very few bubbles to start with, the small amount of soda and acid aren't going to make a whole lot either and you won't get the light and fluffy volume you might have been hoping for.  With the amount of batter, I used an ice cream disher to measure each cup, and my disher fills my normal muffin tins almost full. I thought that might be rather too full, but since the rise is small, it wasn't bad. The muffins did spread out, and the tops ended up rather like peanut butter cookies sitting on top of a little, dense cake. We like them. We didn't have any trouble with the tops breaking off, either, mostly because nothing stuck to the pan at all--used paper liners for the bottoms based on other reviews.  I plan to frost them with chocolate today. I am debating popping the tops and doing an inner layer of chocolate instead of doing the tops, just to preserve the 'cookie' look they have.  Anyway, pretty good unfrosted. Next time I might try changing it to add lift, maybe more egg or soda/tartar or milk.

These were fabulous.  I added chopped Reeses PB cups to the recipe and used the creamy chocolate frosting recipe I found on this site and they were delish!  I added a piece of PB cup on top of the cupcake.   I also took an apple corer and made a large hole in the center of the cupcake after they were baked and cooled and filled it with rasp preserves.  It was like a big surprise when you bit into the cupcake.

Thanks for the recipe! I followed it pretty much as instructed. I only substituted the shortening (do not use it) for a mix of oil and apple sauce. I found the finished cupcake pretty good although the peanut flavor was not as strong as I would have liked. Note ~ I am a bit peanut butter crazy! Also, the cupcake was not as moist or light as I would have hoped for - although still pretty good! I finished cupcake with a tasty cream cheese frosting!  All in all it was a good recipe, but next time I will tweak the recipe more to my tastes.

These are very good. I made minor modifications. Used vegetable oil in place of shortening. Used "natural" peanut butter. Crushed up ~24 mini Reese's Peanut Butter Cups and mixed them into the batter before spooning it into the tins. I baked mine for about 19 minutes, and next time I will take them out a little earlier - I found them to be a little drier than I would like. Frosted them with chocolate frosting and added half a mini PB cup on top, just for fun!

My husband LOVED these!!  I made the recipe just as given, but topped them with vanilla buttercream frosting and a grape jelly swirl.  Very moist, and the perfect amount of peanut butter flavor.  I had to throw half of them away because he was trying to hurt himself eating!!!  LOL!!

These are SO good! I made half a batch (12 cupcakes) and used CRUNCHY peanut butter in the cupcakes and for a yummy peanut butter frosting I made. I injected grape jelly into the middles of all the cupcakes, topped with the crunchy peanut butter frosting and then drizzled warmed grape jelly on the tops. They were very cute and delicious. I got to eat one and my boyfriend and his brother had eaten the rest by the next evening! Haha!

Great cupcakes, but as another reviewer said, there is way too much batter for 24 cupcakes.  This caused the cupcakes to spill over the edges and the result was not pretty.  Mine didn't rise either, But the flavor was great once I frosted these with the Creamy Chocolate Frosting recipe from this site!  MMMMM!

I used cake flour instead of all purpose flour and it made it sooo silky. Then I added a vanilla pudding frosting to the top so that it just made a perfect dessert all that much better!!!

AWESOME!!!  I came down with a horrible cupcake craving and found this recipe--soooo glad I tried it!! In fact, I'm eating my second one right now and had to pause to enjoy the last bites :)  I used previous reviewers comments and used lemon juice and oil (in lieu of cream of tartar and shortening, because I had niether).  I used natural peanut butter, because that's all I have. I used the chocolate frosting (II? I think) recipe from this site and it is a perfect pair :) Accidentally added too much vanilla, but it did not seem to alter the peanut buttery taste. My only complaint was my own fault--I baked them just a couple of minutes too long so they were not quite as moist as I would have liked them to be.  Though not quite dry--but borderline.   My husband and I both love these--will make again!

I loved this recipe, it was very easy to make and very moist.  Instead of making cupcakes, though, I put batter in a 13x9 cake pan, and baked it for 35 minutes, and it was really good.  I iced it with homemade chocolate icing.  Even better. Every recipe I have ever tried from this website, has been a keeper.

I made these today and my kids and husband loved them! I did add a few milk chocolate chips to the tops of the muffins before I put them in the oven. I did have to bake them for quite a bit longer than 15-20 minutes, but I made large muffin size cupcakes. I think I will add a bit more peanut butter the next time I make them- I found the peanut buttery taste wasn't strong enough for me (or perhaps I'll try natural peanut butter; it was mentioned in a few other reviews. Thanks for the recipe!  So I made these again last week; I added chocolate chips (just a handful) to the batter prior to cooking them- they were great! I also used brown sugar splenda instead of regular brown sugar and used whole wheat flour instead of white. Now, my husband liked the one's made with white flour better- but the kids didn't even notice a difference (and neither did I)

I read many of the reviews raving about these cupcakes.  I must say I was VERY disappointed.  I bake weekly - and the peanut butter flavor just wasn't there for me.  I believe this recipe needs more peanut butter flavor.

I used butter instead of shortening, a bit more peanut butter, and frosted with homemade chocolate fudge frosting.  Delicious!  They tasted like a peanut butter cookie in cupcake form.  Thank you for this recipe!

I just finished making this recipe and boy, do these taste some kinda good! I read the reviews prior to baking so I exchanged the shortening for veg. oil. I bumped up the taste by adding an extra 1/4 cup of peanut butter, an extra teaspoon of vanilla and I stirred in reeses peanut butter chips right before filling the muffin tins. I plan to frost them w/chocolate, but the one I just ate was w/out frosting and it was Oh, so good!

These were spectacular!!I substitued veg oil for the shortening and added chocolate chips.  I also used a Peanut Butter buttercream frosting.  I took them to work and they received rave reviews.

It's simply a divine cupcake! I used chunky peanut butter and half butter, half olive oil. I feel that the recipe needs more peanut butter as the taste was rather subtle. On the other hand, I would reduce the amount of milk to maybe just slightly over 1 cup as the taste was a little strong. But the milk flavour gave the cupcakes a really nice dimension in terms of taste. All in all, a recipe that I would make again and again! In fact, I'm giving my former tuition teachers these delights for Christmas this year!

These were the best cupcakes I have ever had! I am not even the biggest fan of peanut butter, but I loved these!! I used skim milk, egg whites, and margarine in place of milk, egg, and shortening. They came out great!

I could not wait to try this recipe after reading the ingredients and the reviews.  I even doubled the batch so I could take them to work.  Unfortunately I was extremely disappointed with the end result.  My husband and I both thought they tasted like watered down peanut butter.  Maybe I did something wrong, because when they were baking they didn't smell quite right either.  I triple checked the recipe, thinking I forgot something, but I didn't.

These were easy to make and had a good taste/texture. I followed the recipe exactly and I was able to make more than 24 cupcakes. I made some with the Chocolate Frosting I recipe and some without. I definitely preferred it with the frosting. It was a good combination.

I exactly halved this recipe (to yield only 12) but other than that followed the recipe exactly.  These cupcakes were very moist and flavorful (plenty of peanut butter flavor!).  For those complaining that they weren't very flavorful, perhaps you were using cheap peanut butter?  I used Jif and they were great!  Definitely will make again.

Great Recipe!  Had the family asking for more.  I used crunchy peanut butter instead of creamy, but otherwise followed the recipe as is.  I iced 1/2 of the cupcakes with buttercream frosting and left the others plain.  The adults liked the plain and the kids loved the iced.  I will certainly make these again soon.  Thanks for the recipe!

I had to alter the fat (shortening) with butter due to not being prepared ... These cupcakes are awesome with no frosting. I placed some Chocolate disks on the top of a few before cooking and that gave it a bit of the chocolate flavor (could have been more). I was looking for a good 'go  to' peanut butter cake recipe and found it the first try.

I substituted vegetable oil for the shortening in these and they came out beautifully light and fluffy.  I used half regular light peanut butter, and half unsalted/unsweetened PB.

Like many other reviewers, I opted for a chocolate fudge frosting, which complemented them very well.

They have a very full and unexpected flavour - not your average cupcake!

I gave it a 2 star rating because I am not sure what I did wrong. I DO know I forgot to add the "pinch of salt". Would that cause the cupcakes not to rise? Outside of forgetting the salt I followed it to the T. The ones that are smaller look baked through but flat the bigger ones do not look baked through and also are flat. We will still eat them.

Honestly, I would give them 1 star for the taste, but I'm thinking I did something wrong along the way, so I'll give it 3. Tasted too floury and not PB at all. :(

I followed this recipe exactly and I had the same results as another reviewer....flat and they came out looking like a peanut butter cookie on top of a muffin. Did not rise at all. Very disappointed, since I made them for a birthday party :(

I think I may have a new favorite dessert. I am not big on sweets so this cupcake is perfect for me, not too sweet but still a delish treat.  I topped my cupcakes with a chocolate ganache and they were just sooooo good. I also put kisses in the middle of half my batch  husband said they were very good.  I used the apple sauce and veg oil instead of shortening as others had suggested and they were very moist and came out of the liner cup perfectly.

They had a good flavor but.....instead of rising, they layed across the muffin pan making it very difficult to remove.  Basically I made pb cookies on top a cupcake bottom.  Sure, I possibly overfilled them but never had I seen something so ugly come out of the oven :(

If you like a dry, almost fluffy cupcake, than this is for you.  Flavor is good, but I like a heavy, moist cake and can't get it to happen with this recipe.  I've added more Crisco, even some oil and baked just till cake tester came out clean.  No go.  Disappointed.

YUM! moist and fluffy just the way i like it! i made these at 3am one night wen i couldn't sleep (not a good time to bake s/t u'll wanna eat immediately!) i had run out of milk so i very strangely decided to substitute it by melting some vanilla ice cream that was hogging my much needed freezer space! well evidently they came out delicious but maybe i'll make them again with milk just to check the difference! 5* thanks for the recipe!

very easy, moist, and tasty.  I dipped them in chocolate icing and added some sprinkles.  Three nine year old boys inhaled them.  I made a half order and got 14 not just 12 cupcakes.  I will make again.

I followed the recipe exactly. I loved them, the taste was superb! i only encountered two problems: one, they did not rise up very high... (which was not really a big deal) and two, they stuck like crazy to the papers. my cupcakes totally came apart when trying to get them out of the papers! i recommend just greasing the pan instead! I also frosted mine with a nice cream cheese frosting... superb! these are awesome because they are not too sweet or peanutty... they are just right. my husband was not excited about them when I told him I was making peanut butter cakes... he is not wild about peanut butter deserts... but he absolutely adored these! I will definitely make again!

I added chocolate chips and was hoping to taste the sweet-salty combination with the peanut butter. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The cupcakes are very sweet with only slight peanut butter flavor. The brown sugar needs to be cut down or the peanut butter and/or salt in the recipe increased. I was going to frost with chocolate icing and changed my mind. I'm glad I did as they would have been overpoweringly sweet.

I made these with my brother Thomas (5). We used 1 cup of honey instead of the sugar and added 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips because he wanted peanut butter-chocolate cupcakes. We glazed them with chocolate icing. They turned out absolutely delicious! They were so moist and special! This recipe is surely a keeper!

These taste like cake versions of soft old fashioned peanut butter cookies.  Not super sweet, but VERY tender, so be careful to cool them and use caution when pulling them out of the muffin tins if you don't use liners.  I made a chocolate butter cream frosting for a Reeces sort of cake.  All thumbs up from my family.

This is super delicious.  I plan to dip the tops in ganache, but they are still incredible without it.  I subbed coconut oil for the shortening, 1:1.  I also cut the brown sugar down to 1 cup, based on the other comments.  I will definitely make these again.

Delicious!  I used oil instead of shortening, only because I have found that in doing so you are gauranteed a moist cake...which it was.  This is not a very sweet cake.  I frosted these with Rich Chocolate Frosting, but felt that it was too sweet for this cake.  Next time I will dip the tops in a ganache, so that the chocolate does not overpower/hide the peanut butter in the cake.

Wow, these cupcakes were delicious and crazy soft and fluffy.  I don't think any cupcake recipe I've used before has produced as soft a texture as these!   This was the first peanut butter cupcake recipe I've tried and I certainly wasn't disappointed.  I took the advice of some other reviewers and used oil instead of shortening.  I frosted with a creamy chocolate frosting recipe from this site.  Delicious, definitely a keeper!

Fantastic recipe! I mixed everything by hand (I even make my own brown sugar) and they turned out great. I followed the advice of several other reviewers and used 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup canola oil instead of the shortening, and I love how they turned out. I was planning on frosting them, but they taste amazing without it! Definitely will make these over and over again...

These were very good peanut butter cupcakes.  I think they need just a bit more peanut butter flavor.  Topping them with the Rich Chocolate Frosting from this site made them five star cupcakes.

This recipe was perfect.  I did make a couple of changes but it had nothing to do with the recipe itself.  I am always changing things to make it healthy for my family.  My flour is 1/2 wheat and 1/2 flax.  I ran out of eggs but I used apple sauce in exchange.  I do not use shortning, so I used olive oil instead.  The brown sugar, I cut this in 1/2.  I do not like to feed my children alot of concentrated sugars.   These muffins came out perfect!!!

Very nice cupcakes! I used a "dark roast" peanut butter from Whole Foods that worked great. Using a portioner this recipe made 3 dozen easy. Looking at one of these cupcakes after baking, one can imagine that a peanut butter cookie wished that it were a cupcake and it came true. :) They really look like someone turned a pb cookie into a cupcake. I filled and topped mine with a chocolate frosting, because filled cupcakes are more fun. ;)

Wondefully delicious! I topped these with fluffy peanut butter frosting from this site. Will definitely be making again! I also substitued 1/2 cup butter in place of the shortening as I had run out and I used 1 1/2 cups peanut butter and they were still moist.

I added oil instead of shortening, Baking powder instead of soda,,and it was the greatest,,I was so proud to have made this scrumptious cake,,it wasnt dry,,   I made a frosting for it and made it as a cake instead of cup cakes,,  To Make Frosting: Blend together,,,1/4 cup peanut butter.. 1/8 cup butter or margarine, 3 cups confectioners' sugar, 4 1/2 tablespoons evaporated milk and 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract, stirring slowly until mixture holds its shape. Then beat until very smooth. If necessary, gradually add tiny amounts of evaporated milk to bring to spreading consistency.  I also heated this mix in the microwave to blend the butters ,,also waited till cake was cooled to pour it on,,,   5 stars

These were so great, moist, tasty and peanut buttery.  I actually scooped 1/4 cup of batter into cups and then pressed peanut butter cups into each cup and they were incredible.  The other cupcakes on this site with peanut butter cups looked nicer but were dry and not as tasty.  In these, the peanut butter cups sank a little, making them not look as nice but they were much better tasting.

Very easy to make... I followed the recipe exactly even though I was tempted to add extra pb (but my mom told me to "stick to the original recipe" for once, so i did)  and it definitely needed the extra peanut butter!  It's a good recipe, but they don't really rise as much as the boxed cupcake mixes (shame on me, i know... but i don't use those anymore, honest!)  but still very good! I've yet to eat one totally cooled down or iced though, so my review might change by the time that i do that :)

I made the recipe as given only adding a cup of semisweet chocolate chips to the mix with very good results.  I was running short of time for the last batch and so shut off the oven at 10 minutes baking time. When I came back three hours later the cupcakes were done just right and the oven was cold. This is a nice trick if you are short on time and know your oven. I have used this idea on many a batch of cookies.

These are easy to make. I followed the exact recipe. The cupcakes were fabulous! I used chocolate icing and I also added some chocolate chips to the batter. It made 24 cupcakes and 2 hours later there are zero left. I will be making these again.

These tasted good but were pretty heavy and dense for a cupcake.  They seemed more like muffins to me.  I'd make again if I could figure out a way to get them to be less like a muffin and more like a cupcake.

These cupcakes tasted really good, but they were very crumbly like others have said.  I tried making minis for a bridal shower and the tops of them broke off when I took them out of the pan.

These were tasty.  They did not rise for me and looked flat.  The bottoms of my cupcake liners did look greasy.  The taste however was really good and it was simple to make.  Maybe I will use baking powder next time?

Mmmm! I love peanut butter and these were so so good! We couldn't stop eating them! I used apple sauce in place of sugar and I also added about a half a bag of peanut butter chips. The texture of these was so incredible! I'm ready to whip up a batch right now!!

Like others have said, these cupcakes were dense/rich...but delicious! I did not have an issue with the cupcakes being too dry. I added an extra half cup of peanut butter (other reviews said it lacked pb flavor) which worked perfectly. I also added choc. chips to half the batter...this absolutely made them for me, though others (with less of a sweet tooth) liked them without. Next I'll try minis with choc icing!

Being the peanut butter lover that I am, I couldn't pass up trying to make this recipe. It was DELICIOUS! I made a couple changes to the recipe. I used 1/2 Cup of vegetable oil instead of shortening and used all natural peanut butter as reccomended. They came out really moist and had a great peanut butter flavor. To top it off I made a chocolate ganache recipe from this website. Yum Yum Yum! I will definately be making this again!

My first attempt at cupcakes from scratch. I substituted 2 tsp lemon juice for the cream of tartar and 1/4 c oil for the shortening. They turned out slightly moist, although not as much as I would have liked. Topped with a chocolate butter icing, they were delicious and disappeared quickly. I will definitely make this recipe again.

I used 2 tsp. lemon juice instead of cream of tartar, a heaping cup of peanut butter, margarine stick instead of shortening, 1 1/2 tsps of vanilla, and sprinkled chocolate chips on top before baking.  They were perfect except I don't think it tasted enough of peanut butter.  I'm thinking to try the natural peanut butter next time.

I made these cupcakes for our new year's get together and they were gobbled up! I took the advise of several other reviewers and used oil instead of shortening, an extra 1/4c. of peanut butter, an extra tsp. of vanilla and added Reese's peanut butter chips just before scooping into the cupcake cups. Once cooled, I frosted with chocolate frosting. We LOVE these cupcakes!

Delicious!  I made these on the spur of the moment, so I made quite a few substitutions: soymilk for milk; 2 tsp of baking powder for the salt, baking soda, and creme of tartar; margarine for shortening; and equal parts brown sugar and Splenda for the brown sugar.  I was worried it would turn out badly, but they turned out wonderfully!

These cupcakes were pretty blah.  They weren't bad, and the texture was perfect.  They were just boring.  They didn't have enough peanut butter taste.  I didn't add chocolate frosting, but I'm sure that would have helped.  I can't see making these again.

These were OK, although i'm pretty sure I screwed something up somewhere! My batter wasn't really cakey.. it was a fluffy batter. I can't figure out why, unless that's how it's supposed to be? Mine definitely don't look like any of the pictures posted here. They didn't rise all that much and they're a little dry. I probably should have taken other reviewers advice and used a natural peanut butter for more peanut taste. But they're a decent cupcake (though almost more muffin-y?) and nice with chocolate frosting on top.

yummy and gorgeous, I had to restrain myself to wait until they were all baked and not just gorge on the batter itself.

as per the reviews, i added a 1/8 cup of vegetable oil so it wouldnt crumble, but they came out a bit heavy. maybe next time I'll try just half that measurement. 

had these with chocolate buttercream icing. to die for!

My younger brother needed twenty cupcakes to hand out to the class for his birthday. I checked out cupcake recipes, tried this recipe, and it was delicious. It was hard because A few crumbled and we had to make at least two baatches because of all the crumbling. But this is a recipe I'd recommend

This is a great recipe!  Moist and flavorful and tasted even better the next day. I did everything the recipe suggested and added strawberry jam for filling.  The kids at home loved it! :)

mmmmmmmmmmm these are so good! I have just finished one, i topped them all with chocolate buttercream. These were my first peanut butter cupcakes and i was wary because last tie i tried cooking with peanut butter it turned out very very wrong. But these were amazing. I will be making these a lot!

I made these as written except I didnât have shortening so I used 1/4 butter and 1/4 cup oil. I also did as another reviewer suggested and added half the batter to the cups, then a spoonful of blackberry jam and topped off with the rest of the batter so they had a surprise filling. Mine needed the full 20 minutes and they were perfect - moist on the inside with a slightly crunchy top that looked just like a peanut butter cookie. And they taste exactly like peanut butter cookies, just in cupcake form. I used Skippy extra chunky and there was plenty of peanut butter flavor. I frosted them with cream cheese icing. Next time Iâll try them without the jelly and with a chocolate cream cheese frosting instead!

Of all the things i have baked these cup cakes seem to hit a note of perfect taste that everyone I gave these to just loved them so much. Only thing I did different is I blended together dry and wet so the top of cakes would drop after baking them I put melted chocolate in middle on top then added frosting.

Made these cupcakes for church last week and felt the taste was really good.  But they were really heavy.   I like a light fluffy cupcake so I tweaked it very little.  Instead of using shortening I used butter and added an extra T. of peanut butter.   They turned out the way I liked.  And taste amazing.  This is my new favorite peanut butter cupcake recipe. Thank you.

I added some peanut butter chips to this recipe and made grape jelly frosting to top it off. My friends tell me that they will never think of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich as lunch again instead it will be desert!

I baked these with oil instead of shortening and they were still amazing. Followed the recipe and only added milk chocolate chunks. This was easy and very tasty. I suggest keeping an eye on them when theyâre nearly ready to make sure they donât over bake.

Okay... where do I start? Well, you know that a cupcake isn't good when the batter is yummier than the actual cupcake. I wouldn't stop eating the batter, so I had high expectations. When I took the cupcakes out of the oven, they smelled like flour and were very dense. Without the frosting, they tasted like I had mixed peanut butter and flour together and popped them in the oven. With the frosting, it tasted like sweetened flour. I would not make this again, even if I added more sugar. If you're reading this, please don't make this and waste your ingredients!

Subbed butter for shortening, otherwise as written. Wonât make again, too sweet. Decent texture, not as rich and moist as weâd like. Looking for other options for a childâs party.

These cakes were amazing!! I did use 1/2 cup butter instead of shortening and they were delicious! I topped them with a chocolate buttercream which actually took away from the peanut butter flavor a little. I will definitely make them again but will use a different frosting, like a honey buttercream instead. Great recipe!

I just finished making these.  They turned out wonderful.!  I didn't have any shortening, so I used veg. oil.. Some I left without frosting, some I frosted with chocolate.  I put a few chocolate chips in some.  All of them are wonderful.  I got 24 cupcakes.  Oh, one more thing:  I didn't have any cream of tarter, so I just added the same amount of lemon juice, after I added the vanilla.   Thanks for the recipe.

I doubled the recipe, and used half white and half brown sugar. I made mini ones, too. They are YUM! There is enough batter for at least 2 batches, so I made a batch to take to some friends.
Great Cupcakes!

These were FABULOUS! I couldn't believe I made them! They tasted like they came from a ritzy bakery! I topped mine with Peanut Butter icing (from this site) and a Reese's mini on top! They were a huge hit. Instead of 1/2 cup Shortening, I used 1/2 cup Vegetable Oil and I added 1/2 cup Apple Sauce.

Holy cow. This is the best peanut butter cake recipe I've made, and I've tried quite a few. I made a half recipe, as I didn't need a lot of cupcakes--but even a half recipe made well over a dozen large cupcakes. And I added an additional huge scoop of peanut butter, as recommended by other reviewers (not very precise, I know--I used a large, serving sizes spoonful extra).

I made this as a cake for my husband's birthday. It was a big hit. I used chunky peanut butter, 1 1/2 cup, and also added Reeses Peanut butter chips to the batter. Frosted with milk chocolate frosting. It was just perfect, not too sweet, very peanut buttery and rich flavor. Will me making them again as cupcakes soon.

Pretty good recipe. Not too heavy as is the risk when using peanut butter. Whip up an awesome peanut butter frosting and I will be happy to give a fifth star.

We manage nut allergies so I had to substitute the peanut butter with Wow Butter since it's a nut-free spread (tastes like pb).  These were delicious.  Mine did not rise as high as I expected but I may have over-cooked them.  I also used coconut oil instead of shortening.  I didn't see the recipe for the chocolate frosting so I topped ours with a maple frosting.  Wow!  These were great!!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very peanutty!  We received a vat of cream cheese frosting from hubs' family, so I made some cupcakes today . . .these definitely make 24 cupcakes and used up a good portion of the cream cheese frosting.  Very nice flavor of peanut with the cream cheese frosting.  Thanks for the recipe!

First off, I am a pb-holic so this review comes with bias. I absolutely love this recipe, to the point that I made an account on allrecipes just to boast about it! The cupcakes were amazing - moist, soft, and like many other said, not too sweet which was a bonus for me as I don't really like too-sweet desserts. You don't even know how much I am in heaven eating these things. The tartar sauce really gives them a great kick too, so the cakes are somewhat savoury tasting. IMO they are rather rich, but I don't mind that at all. Finally I switched from shortening to salted butter and omitted the pinch of salt because I have a thing against shortening. Anyway, amazing recipe.

These cupcakes are not too sweet and are just firm enough. I filled some of them with raspberry filling to make peanut butter and jelly sandwich cupcakes and then put chocolate frosting on them. Yum!

After reading the least positive reviews, I was really quite skeptical to try but, curiosity got the better of me. Besides, I cannot resist peanut butter.. Lol! So I changed serving to 6. Had to sub the tartar with lemon juice as i realised too late i ran out. They came out delicious! Soft, fluffy and not too sweet. You really must cream the butter first, then slowly add the sugar, making sure they are light and fluffy before you add the other stuffs. Or else, you'll come up with a soupy mess.  Really enjoyed these. Ty for sharing!

These cupcakes are amazing! My friends and family (and my husbands co-workers) ask for them by name. However, they are not the same consistency as normal cupcakes, which if you know anything about baking with peanut butter it's expected. The only things I change are I sometimes add a little more peanut butter and I almost always add broken up Reese's peanut butter cups  to the batter and as garnish. Thank you so much for this awesome recipe!

I own a little bakery online, and i was kind of lost when a costumer ordered peanut butter cupcakes for a wedding! So i decided to give this recipe a try, and i was really surprised that they turned out amazingly beautiful and delicious! Sooo easy to make, i used butter instead of shortening and the result was amazing! Perfect cupcakes! I'm not a PB lover (actually, i kinda hate it!) but these are def. On my top favorite!

I do not have ANY idea what problems other reviewers could have had with this recipe. I absolutely love to make a cake from scratch and this one smelled great every second. While the cupcakes were baking you could smell the little crystals of brown sugar turning the peanut butter into heaven. Topped with Fluffy Peanut Butter frosting and a mini peanut butter cup- couldn't ask for a better Father's Day treat for my peanut butter loving husband. Thanks for the great recipe!

These were delicious! Light, moist, and fluffy. I didn't have any shortening, so I used butter. They turned out great. I added strawberry preserves to my standard buttercream frosting and made them peanut butter and jelly cupcakes. They're so good I don't know if they're going to last until the get together I'm supposed to take them to tomorrow.

Easy and yummy.  I used cupcake liners and it worked just fine.  Made 24 cupcakes.  Weren't as moist as I expected but will definitely make this recipe again.  Paired it with a whipped vanilla frosting.  Was a hit on Mother's Day!

I just made these cupcakes for our horse club fundraiser and they were the first cupcakes to sell. I did make a few changes after reading other reviews. I used butter instead of shortening and I added 1 cup of reeses peanut butter chips to enhance the peanut butter flavor. I topped them with a chocolate buttercream frosting and put a minature reese cup on top of each one and they turned out amazing. I think my husband and I are addicted to them, they are now our favorite cupcakes.

These were amazing! The recipe was easy to follow, specially for a novice baker like myself. After reading a few reviews, I decided to use vegetable oil in place of shortening, and since I did not have cream of tartar, I skipped that and the baking soda, adding 6 teaspoons of baking powder instead. Absolutely delicious, moist and satisfying!

A very nice cupcake. A little dry and they do not keep for more than a couple days. The trick, I have found, is to add a really good icing. Either a chocolate buttercream or a strawberry jam icing, it's good if the icing is nice and sweet as the cupcakes are not super sweet.

These cupcakes are great! I made the recipe with some the substitutions that others have suggested: 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce instead of the shortening. For flour I used 1 cup whole wheat flour & 1-1/2 cups all-purpose flour. For the sugar, I used 1-1/2 cup light brown sugar & 1/2 cup dark brown sugar, which gives a richer flavor. I used natural creamy peanut butter for a stronger peanut flavor (and less sugar). I baked the cupcakes in foil wrappers (jumbo sized), which made 24 cupcakes exactly. I baked them for ~24 min. (probably because I used the larger muffin foils. Yummy! Also, I used the buttercream chocolate frosting on here that uses hot fudge topping as an ingredient and it was a perfect pairing. Enjoy!

These were the Hit of the Party. I live in Costa Rica and getting certain items like decent peanut butter can be challenging...so naturally Making peanut butter cupcakes for our friends birthday party was a huge hit. I frosted them with Peanut Butter Frosting and they were wonderfully delish. YES- I will make these again!

I think these are really good! The only thing I would change for next time is to double the peanut butter. I wanted the cupcakes to have a very strong peanut butter flavor, but it was a little mild.

I made these last night for some guests with chocolate sour cream frosting.  It was a nice combo.  I used the 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil recommended by another reviewer and thought they were slightly dry- next time I'll try the shortening. They were quick and easy to make and the short cooking time (we needed 20 minutes) really helped.

I made these for a birthday party.  These turned out great.  My mother is diabetic and LOVES peanut butter.  I switched sugar with Splenda and these were gone in under 10 minutes.  The kids didn't even realize they had Splenda in them. This recipe is definitely a keeper for my family.

Delicious & moist cupcakes. Very easy recipe. The only thing I did differently was add milk chocolate & peanut butter swirled morsels to the tops of each cupcake.

The cupcakes were just ok.  I was so excited to make these, as I LOVE peanut butter, but I was disappointed.  As others mentioned, mine turned out dry, and I feel like I need to dunk them in milk just to eat them.  The flavour itself was just ok.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I won't be making these again.

I followed the recipe exactly and found that they completely fell after I took them out of the oven, which was disappointing. They didnt look pretty but tasted great!

So moist and absolutely delicious! I filled them with milk chocolate ganache and topped with chocolate buttercream. They taste like a cakey peanut butter cookie!

I followed the recipe exactly as written. They were AWESOME! Super moist, not too sweet. Everything I would want in a cupcake. We did not even need frosting. Very tasty and gone very quickly. Will do it again!

Sorry, I don't like to leave negative reviews, but the best I can say about these is "they were okay".  That being said, I may give them one more try because I had to substitute some of the brown sugar for white sugar with added mollasses.  Maybe that made a real difference in the flavor.  I topped them with a chocolate ganache icing which went well with the cupcake.

I followed this recipe exactly and the end result was very tasty.  I will make it again, however I believe that I will add in some applesauce/oil as they turned out a little dry.

The flavor of these is so good! Mine ended up kind of flat and I don't know why. I frosted these with Almost Professional Buttercream frosting.They still tasted great and were very moist.

In particular there was nothing wrong with these cupcakes, but I don't think they were all that great. They were fine to eat but I wouldn't say that they were delicious. I put chocolate buttercream frosting on them which was what made them good, but I think without this frosting they would not be that good. I don't think I would make this recipe again.

Hmmmm..I am not sure about this one, I gave it three stars though. I did everything the recipe said to and substitued the shortening for oil but this cupcake tastes nothing like peanut buttery goodness to me.  It stinks because they look absolutely beautiful coming out of the oven but just don't taste like peanut butter to me at all and if it doesn't taste like it then people wont buy them...Maybe I will use a different kind of peanut butter...I used natural peanut butter thinking it would give that stronger flavor but not so much...I will try it again sometime this month with a few tweaks here and there...Overall I think this can be an awesome recipe with a few adjustments but we'll see how the second time around goes! :)

WONDERFUL! If you are serving them hot you MUST top them with marshmallow fluff and it makes them even more amazing! The only change I used the lemon juice instead of cream of tarter as reviewed by someone else.

These cupcakes are very good and easy to make.  I took the advice of other reviewers and substituted oil for the shortening and used natural peanut butter for a more intense flavor.  The end result were cupcakes that were moist and had a good peanut butter flavor.  The recipe was very easy to cut in half to make 12 cupcakes instead of 24.

Very Good! I was a little skeptical, I have never made PB cupcakes before.  They were so moist, I made them for a party and they were well liked by all.  I sprinkled some powdered sugar on top because I felt like they looked naked, but they they would probably be just as yummy without!  It's a keeper!

I shouldn't have substituted lemon juice for the cream of tartar - the tops of the cupcakes collapsed as soon as they cooled.  My friends said the tops of the cupcakes looked like peanut butter cookies.  But oh my, the cupcakes were WONDERFUL! I put a small amount of buttercream chocolate frosting on the tops and they tasted like those Hershey kiss-in-the-middle-of-a-peanut-butter cookies.

I made this into a 4 layer cake with rich chocolate frosting. I used oil ins tead of shortening and next time I will bake at 325 for two 9 inch rounds for about 35 min because otherwise the edges got a little darker and the middle was not done. It tasted great!

It came out very moist. I was worried since it had peanut butter it would be hard to eat and would be dry but completely the opposite! Will make them again for sure.

Loved the cupcakes.  This recipe is so easy to make.  I needed a large number of cupcakes for a function and this worked out great.  This is like a gourmet bakery item with the chocolate peanut butter candy inside of it and a chocolate fudge frosting on top. As a finishing touch, I place half a minature peanut butter cup on top of the frosting.

This recipe was good...but I'm not sure if I baked them too long because the top was not soft but the inside was very moist. They do need frosting and I made a chocolate one with unsweetened cocoa and I followed the recipe on the back and it was delicious!! Do frost them :)

These cupcakes are soooo good. I mean amazing. The only change I made was using vegetable oil instead of shortening. I iced them with chocolate buttercream icing and it was HEAVEN!

This recipe is very good!  I did add mini-chocolate chips and used some wheat flour and the rest all-purpose.  Can't even tell it has wheat in it!  I ended up with 30 cupcakes and they were filled!  I had to add time since they were bigger, but watch your time!!  I almost burned mine!  This recipe is a Keeper - thumbs up (as my kids say and do!)  Thanks for the great recipe!

I used an entire 16 oz. jar of extra crunchy peanut butter (about 1 1/2 cups), 1/2 cup of canola oil, in lieu of shortening, and some semi sweet chocolate chips.  Although this didn't taste too much like peanut butter the texture was wonderful and they tasted yummy.  Hubby loved them and will make again.  Thanks for sharing.

Very yummy - made a batch this morning - would also be good with jam in the middle! I added 60% cocoa chips to some of them - perfect!!! Used applesauce & oil instead of shortening-worked great-they finish in the oven quickly-I over did them by about 2 minutes-still great!! The kids have been eating them with ice cream!

Very good recipe. As I really watch my sugar intake, I used Splenda Brown Sugar in lieu of regular Brown Sugar. I also used oil instead of shortening...and threw in about 1/2 cup of mini choc chips. I'll definitely make this recipe again.

These are light and fluffy, but not terribly moist (not really dry and crumbly either).  I didn't think they tasted of peanut butter enough - even though the house smelled like I'd made peanut butter cookies.  I probably won't make these again.

I haven't tasted them yet, since the cupcakes are still in the oven. However, they look amazingly good :) I made half batch plain, and to the other half I mixed in semi-sweet chocolate chips. I can't wait to taste them!

The shortening in this recipe was OVERPOWERING everything else and it's not good. I followed the recipe exactly and you cannot even taste the peanut butter, which is probably because of the shortening.  Kind of muffin-like too.

Never made peanut butter cupcakes, but absolutely love them!!!  Topped with creamy chocolate frosting and it's an amazing treat =)  Didn't have any cream of tarter, so substituted 2 tsp of white vinager instead.  Worked out great!  Would definately make again.

These tasted great however mine didn't rise like what was shown in the pictures. I followed the directions to a T so I am not sure what went wrong. Maybe I over mixed??

I made these after having pb cupcakes from Sprinkles and was having a craving.  I substituted lemon juice for cream of tartar and added chocolate chips into the batter.  Topped with chocolate frosting and they were awesome!!

These were so good - light,fluffy and moist. Even people who "don't really like paenut butter" loved these.  I covered them with homemade chocolate frosting and Reeses Pieces crumbles. Yum Yum.

This is a great recipe! I followed it to the letter. The only reason I gave 4 stars was because they did come out sort of crumbly on the outside. They were less like a cupcake and more like a muffin. That being said, this was the first time I've EVER made homemade cupcakes so I'm pretty sure I undermixed or overmixed. I encourage everyone to give this a try, I don't understand some of the other bad reviews.

We substituted trans-free margarine for shortening and halved the sugar.  More like muffins, but still excellent, especially with Rich Chocolate Frosting from this site!

These were OK. They were pretty bland in my opinion. I added a dark chocolate frosting to give it an extra kick which helped but I won't make these again.

I wasn't sure about how these turned out, but when I brought them to work-everyone loved them and asked for more!  Next time, I'll add chocolate icing so they're like peanut  butter cups.

These cupcakes were o.k.  I would not make them again. Nothing really wrong with them, I guess that based on the reviews of others, we were just expecting something better.  Next time I will make peanut butter brownies instead.
