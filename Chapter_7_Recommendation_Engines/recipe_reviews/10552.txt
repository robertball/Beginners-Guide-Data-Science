I make these ALL THE TIME!  I am no good at making perfectly round cookies, so I put the batter into 2 round 8" or 9" cake pans.  They come out perfectly round!  They are even really good if you put them in the freezer (I forget how I figured this out), so next time we have a birthday at my house I am going to cook the two cookies, freeze them, put a layer of vanilla ice cream between them, decorate the top with chocolate icing and ta-dah!  I will have a giant ice-cream cookie sandwitch cake!  Someone else should try it (since I do not have another birthday for 6 months) and let me know how it goes!  When done baking I flip them unside down on a cooling rack and then flip them back over on another so they are right side up.  The presentation is great because, as I said earlier, they are perfectly round.  You can also half the recipie if you only need one giant cookie... or make two and give one to a neighbor!  Have fun!

GREAT RECIPE!!! I dont understand what people are talking about as far as spillage goes.  I have made this recipe 4 times and all times this cookie came out wonderful!!!  maybe this tip will help - I made the dough, used a 16inch pizza pan from walmart ($4) and lined the bottom with parchment paper - then press the dough into a ball in the center - place parchment paper on top and press slightly with my hands into a circle -  then i used my pampered chef rolling pin and simply rolled into a perfect circle - about 1 inch from edges.  i peeled off the parchment like a dream and baked - no spillage at all -  baked great, tasted great - looked professional!! thanks!!!

With the recommendations from other reviewers, the giant cookie was a BIG sucess at my nephew's B-Day party! I only used the 2 cups of flour and 1/2 tsp. salt recommended, and a little extra vanilla. Everyone thought the cookie was moist and delicious!  They also thought the cookie was made by the Great American Cookies company.  I imitated the frosting decoration they use on their giant cookies (see attached photo).

PLEASE READ! You MUST leave about 2 inches of room around the side for the dough to expand while cooking or it will spill over. This comes out perfectly! I used a very large pizza pan (16 inch) that I bought just for making large cookies like this and that way when I spread the dough out (not too thick), I have enough room to allow the dough to expand. I top with store bought chocolate icing and the buttercream icing from this site because I found those two types closely resemble what the mall cookies taste like.   *Update* When I spread the dough on the pan, I add extra dough around the edges/side, because the cook will expand and as the cookie spreads, the edges will thin out and become more brown otherwise. Make sure to add extra dough just to the sides. Using a large pan and adding extra dough around the sides, I still have a little but of extra cookie dough leftover.

I tried to make this recipe in 2 heart shaped pans I have for Valentine's day, and they're about 8" across. Tried to make 2 cookies, and should have made 3 as they didn't quite cook in the middle. Whatever size pan you use, I would esnsure the dough is no more than 1/4-1/2" thick. However, the recipe itself is delish and I'm sure I'll get it right next time! Will also half the salt next time.

This recipe was great! Instead of putting the mix into a pizza pan i put it into 2-9 inch pie pans, which worked out great.  I also heat it in the microwave for 15 seconds before eating, for a fresh baked taste! YUM!!

This cookie was amazing!  Halved the recipe and baked it in a 9-inch pie pan for 18 minutes.  My favorite cookie now!

This is great!!!  Just as good, if not better, than the store bought ones.  I followed the instructions exactly, but used half milk chocolate chips and half white chocolate chips.  I also baked the cookie for approximately 18 minutes and it came out beautifully golden brown, soft and delicious!  I made it for a birthday and decorated and wrote on it with cream cheese frosting.  It got rave reviews and a few "this is the best cookie I have ever tasted" comments.  Try this...you won't regret it!

Awesome, awesome, awesome!  I only had a 12 1/2 inch pan...so, through trial and error, had to take some of the cookie dough out so that it didn't overflow and start my oven on fire like it did the 1st time I tried it! Oops! I took about a cup and a half of dough out for the smaller pan.  To grease the pan, I used butter flavored cooking spray and it made the cookie even better.
GREAT recipe - I've had it for a week and have made 4 of these cookies already for bosses (was a perfect gift for bosses day - all decorated) and friends! All got RAVE reviews! Thanks!!

This is a keeper. We love the cookie cakes for birthdays. Its a change from the traditional cakes. I used a 12 1/2 inch pizza pan. I took 2 cups out of the finished batter. Baked for 13 minutes at 375. Made a pan of 2 inch cookie out of the leftovers.

Would Give this 5....BUT...

*A little too much flour (next time I'll use 2cups not 2 1/4)

*Baked at TOO High of temp
(NOTE:  I have used Mrs. Fields books for years...her BIGGEST tip is to bake at a LOW temp for longer amount of time)  I baked this at 325 for 27mins

Now, considering I plan to make it again...I will also suggest that others reading this note that this is A LOT of dough.  I put this on a half sheet with parchment underneath & made a large heart shape (Father's Day) by putting dough in freezer for 10 mins ahead of roll out...shaped with hands then rolled topped with another piece of parchment.  Turned out like store quality!!! ;)

Also, I used this frosting recipe:
http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Grocery-Store-Frosting/Detail.aspx

And, one more tip...if you want this to be a surprise, head to your restaurant/baking supply or fav pizza place for a box to deliver your delish gift in!  YUM!

This is the exact recipe from the Nestle chocolate chip package. Reduce flour and salt as others mentioned. (Use 2c flour, 1/2t salt) Bake on parchment & leave a 1&1/2" space around entire edge of a 16" round pizza pan and it will bake up to fill the entire pan to the very edge. I worked at Great American cookies as a youngster and here's a couple tips from that experience: Make the dough a day ahead, chill & then roll out the next day to make it super easy to work & spread evenly. Bake for about 20-23 minutes & turn the pan every 7ish ignites to assure even browning. Remove when a little underdone (puffed up but not browned in middle) & let sit on pan for 10 minutes to finish. Wrap cooled cookie up tightly in saran overnight and the edges will be soft to serve the next day - cookie still fresh as ever!!! Otherwise, simply trim the edges off if you don't want them crunchy. That's the way they do it. ;-)

Yummers! We used the exact ingredients except we omitted the nuts. I baked this on a jellyroll pan and left 1/2 inch on the edges for expansion. I baked at 350* for 25 minutes - covered with foil the last 5 minutes to keep the edges from browning too much. We'll be making this often. I'm looking forward to making this into an ice cream cookie cake for my son's birthday as suggested by another review. :) Excellent stuff.

I made this for my 14yr olds birthday party.  He does not like cake.  The birthday cookie was great.  Everyone enjoyed it.  I follow suggestions of other posters.  I reduced the flour to 2 cups. Increased the vanilla to 2 teaspoons and reduced the salt to 1/4 teaspoon.  I cooked in a 12 inch pizza sheet.  I used parchment paper under the cookie and took the suggestion to roll the cookie out with parchment paper on top.  I pealed the parchment paper off the top prior to cooking.  I lost a little of the dough when it stuck to the parchment paper, but I would do it the same way next time to keep the process neat.  I did go around the edge and make sure that there was 1 inch clearance all the way around the cookie before baking.  This meant moving a little dough around.  The cookies came out as perfect circles and taste great.  On the second cookie I reduced the heat to 350 and cooked the cookie for 18-20 minutes.  I cut the cookie in strips and then cut those strips down diagonally into bars rather than cutting like a pizza.  I netted several servings.

Just came out of the oven and I'm completely unimpressed.  It looks funny (the texture is off - it seems like it is too lacey with air pockets) and doesn't taste quite right (again, the texture is off and it doesn't taste anywhere near as good as the homemade chocolate chip cookies I made a few weeks ago).  I have high hopes for this, though, so I'll try it again and make some changes next time.  This time, I made these changes according to other reviews: only 1/2 tsp of salt and only 2 cups of flour.  I thought the dough seemed too sticky.  Also, didn't use all the batter so I could leave a 1 inch border so it wouldn't overflow the pan.  And used parchment paper beneath and on top of cookie for easy release - Baked at lower temp (325) for 27 minutes.  NEXT TIME I am going to use the full 2 1/4 cups of flour and will use the parchment on the bottom but not on top.  (I couldn't take it out of the oven until the top was cooked enough to pull that parchment on top off and by then I felt the cookie was done too much).

This was great. Thanks for the tip! Made a perfect cookie cake for my hubby who isn't big on cake, but LOVES chocolate chip cookies. Our friends made me promise that this wouldn't be one of those desserts you make just once. Will make again for our anniversary! I knew it'd be good when I recognized it as the Nestle Tollhouse recipe. Thanks for the tip with how long to bake it though!

This turned out very good! I didn't have chocolate chips so I used m&m's which was a little more fun for a children's birthday cake. I used 2, 9 inch cake pans  layered the 2 cakes with chocolate frosting in between and decorated around the edges with frosting and m&m's. I also tried one with vanilla ice cream in between the 2 cakes it was a giant  ice cream cookie sandwhich. I only baked them for about 19 minutes, and they turned out perfect.

This is a great giant cookie recipe. I made this for my sons birthday and he loved it. I used the recommendation of  2cups flour and 1/2 tsp of salt and a little extra vanilla.  I also left a little room around the edges. Worked out great.. No "spillage" I then topped with buttercream frosting  recipe from this site. This cookie was very moist and tasty.. I will definitely be making this one again...

Incredibly good!  Insanely rich!  I can see why some people would say to reduce the chocolate chips a bit, but I didn't and probably won't in the future.  Was a hit at my nephew's birthday dinner!  I used a 16" pizza pan, formed the dough and spread it out to the 14" line, but the cookie spread almost all the way to the edge of the pan.

This was good although a little dry around the edges with the long cooking time - and I undercooked it.  But my oven runs hot so that could have been the whole problem.  Also, all this is is the Toll House chocolate chip cookies recipe, just made into one big cookie instead of lots of little ones.

Yummy!  I actually took this recipe and added it on top of a brownie mix.  To make a cookie brownie.  It took about an hour to bake but it was soooo good!

This recipe is the BOMB exactly as is it! I make this all the time and it is 100 times better than the ones from the mall!I never will eat another one from any cookie company!I double the recipe and put it in a 16" cake pan and bake for 28 minutes at 375. The cookie comes out nice and thick! If you treat the pan before putting the dough in, it will come right out after cooling for a while. I use a mixture of equal parts canola oil, shortening, and flour, mixed well till no more lumps and use a pastry brush to brush it lightly into the pan! Works like a charm!

ahhhhhh-mazing!  I baked mine on a pizza pan on top of another baking sheet to protect from spillage, but it did fine.  Just follow the tips from the reviewers about leaving 1-2 inches and it will do great!  this was top notch professional bakery quality!  thanks so much for making me a hero on my son's birthday!!! :)

Tastes better than the ones in the store and was easy to make!  I'm very excited to find this recipe since this is a birthday tradition in our house!  It turned out great and everyone raved about it!  I had to remove 1 1/2 c. batter (one of other reviews) as well because I only had a 12" pan and it turned out fine!  Thanks!

I made two of these and brought them to school today. Literally everyone thought I bought them at Great American Cookies. They said that they were so light and delicious, and one of my teachers even asked me to make more and bring it to class one day. I didn't change anything about the recipe, and it still came out wonderfully. I'm definitely making this again, it was amazing! Thanks for the recipe :)

This recipe makes way too much batter for the 14" pan recommended. I used a 14" pizza pan and left room around the side for it to expand and it still spilled all over my oven. It tastes good, but the mess leaves me less than impressed. If you make it you really must use a bigger pan or take some of the batter out before baking. I think the original recipe should be edited because the recipe does NOT work for the 14" pan recommended.

I've made this twice, and the trick it to make sure the dough is thick around the outer ridge of the pan so that it bakes evenly, or else the cookies will thin out around the edges as it cooks. The cookie tasted delicious (even after several days!)--I made it as a welcome home treat for my daughter and kept it under a cake serving glass.

i must admit i wasn't how sure this would come out.  i used the two pie pan method and then i gave a slice to my wife (the guinea pig lol).  She loved it i mean she was dancing while eating, a sure sign of food perfection, which made me really happy.

I made this for two cousins who are leaving for college and it was well received.  On my first attempt, I used two 9 inch cake rounds and the cookie cake tasted good, but the texture was off because there was too much batter in each pan.  The second time I tried this recipe, I used a large rectangular cookie sheet and left about two inches around the edges for the cake to spread.  I baked it at 350 for 22 minutes; the edges got hard and crispy, so I just cut them off and was able to shape the cake neatly this way.  It looked nice and tasted good, though it was a little dry.  I followed the ingredients closely aside from omitting walnuts and adding an extra teaspoon of vanilla.  Everyone ate it and said it was good and I'd definitely use it again for cookie cakes, but I'd maybe look for a way to make it a little more moist.

This cookie turned out really well.  I used a 14 inch deep dish pizza pan for it, and it worked great.  I just had to bake an additional 5 minutes to get it done.  I did scale the salt back to 1/4 tsp. Otherwise I followed it exactly and it was great.  Very moist delicious cookie!  We will be making this again.

So good!! The only adjustment I made was to divide recipe in half and baked in 10' springform pan. I sprayed it with baking spray and left about a 1/2 inch around. I used this for my son's birthday and decorated with m&ms. Everyone loved it!  It is much easier and quicker than making a batch of cookies!

This recipe deserves 4.5 stars. The cookie dough is delicious, and i especially love that it included walnuts! Yummy! I took the advice of one  reviewer and made two cookies in 9" cake pans. I simply followed the recipe exactly as it stated, then divided the dough evenly amongst 2 cake pans, pressed it down all the way to the edges of the pans, and baked them for about 19 minutes. I didn't know if the cookies would turn out okay since I am in a high altitude city and there wasn't a high altitude variation, but the consistency of the giant cookies were great! I froze the cookies, then stacked them on top of each other, adding a thick layer of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream between them for a friend's birthday. While the flavor was incredible, freezing the cookies did make them rather hard/difficult to cut through. I thawed it outside of the freezer for 35 minutes before serving, and it was still a difficult eating it with a fork. If you want to make the giant cookie-ice cream-cake like I did, I would recommend making only half the cookie dough to divide among the two cake pans, so that the cookies are less thick and therefore easier to cut through when frozen. Also, be sure to let the ice cream soften before spreading it between the layers to make assembling it easier and less time consuming. I will make this again!

I followed this recipe except I omitted the nuts and added 1 cup of cream cheese.  I left about 1-1/2 inches from the edge of the pizza pan and had no troubles with overflow like some did.  My family loved it and said it was so much better than store bought.  The cream cheese helped keep the cookie soft and moist.  I will be making this again!!

Great Cookie. Made it for the first time for my husband's birthday and it was a hit. I read some of the reviews and used only 2 cups of flour. And I also made the cookie in a cake pan (I wanted a smaller cake). The batter fits in two 9 inch cake pans. And I omitted the nuts-no problem. Thanks for the recipe I will be making it again.

Great tasting cookie, so easy to make.  One suggestion is to put a baking pan on the rack below that cookie in case any dough spills over.

I made one of these cookies for each of  my young son-in-laws.  I wrote their names on them wrapped them in cellophane  and  ties  with a pretty ribbon.  It was really a hit.  They agreed that this recipe is definitely  a "l0".  The only problem was they  had  a hard time getting them away  from  my daughters.  Great fun to make!

This is soo good! This cookie cake melts in your mouth and is a PERFECT dessert!! After one bite I wanted to eat the entire cake! I made no changes other than using gluten free flour instead of regular flour. I will definitely make this again!

Once again another chocolate chip recipe from the bag, i just used it for baking time/temp.  I halved the recipe and used an 8" pan, and lowered the temp to 335 until the center tested done, so it wouldn't burn the edges.  Next time, I would take 1/2 c of batter or so out before putting in the pan.

HOLY SUGAR!!  Whoa, this cookie was sweet!  I subbed one cup of the chocolate chips with M&Ms but I think I would have only done a 1/2 cup of each because it tasted like pure sugar!  I also took the advice of so many other reviewers and decreased the flour by 1/4 cup but I think it should have been left in.  I also increased the vanilla by 1 teaspoon.  DEFINITELY use a baking sheet with sides because this cookie SPREADS A LOT!!  Even after leaving about 2 inches around the outside of the dough.  It was a fun cake alternative for a 5-year old's birthday.  :)

This is the same exact recipe as my mom's.  I've been making this for many years. Only one thing is different in that I use 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of shortening.  I usually only bake mine for 20 minutes, too.

I have made this cake several times.  I leave the outer edge free of cookie dough as the dough spreads as it bakes.  The cookie cake is very easy to decorate anyway you like.

What a hit! Seriously looked proffesional when I was done and tasted great! The cookie was 12inch round baked it in a pizza pan.  It was made as a gift for my son's friend who was getting his yellow belt in Karate. I got a small package of M&Ms and used yellow food coloring added to white frosting. I wrote congrats in the center and piped all around the cookie and added the candy. I went to a party store in my area and purchased a 14" round plate to put the cookie on, wrapped it in cellophane and yellow ribbons.  My friend thought I bought it at a local bakery.  That made me feel good. I did not add the walnuts and it still came out great. I loved making this cookie and will be making again for a special little or I mean big treat!

Turned out great! One recommendation, put tin foil or another pan underneath the cookie pan in the oven.  Mine baked a little over the edges and caught on fire in the oven!! My whole apartment filled with smoke.  But the cookie still tasted delicious.

I find these cookies a bit too dry and yet greasy, not the chewy kind that I was looking for. That being said, anything with chocolate chips inside tastes pretty good. I do like them, but will search for another choc chip cookie recipe.

I add cinnamon and substitute some of the white sugar for Steen's cane syrup and it is always a huge hit.  Advice: Split it into two and bake for 15 minutes each and you won't have to worry about your pan being too small and it oozing over the edge.

I made this with dark brown sugar, it gives so much flavor. I had to omit the walnut, because I didn't have any. Other than that I didn't change a thing about the recipe.  I did find I had way too much dough. I used two pie plates, and the cookies came out about 2 cm's thick. That aside, everybody like the taste including me! I've been asked to make this again for my mother in law 's birthday! Definitely a hit!

What a great cookie.  I used dark chocolate bits and everyone enjoyed..not a crumb left.  Good advice to leave room in the pan for expansion.  I made 8 cookies to keep at home for us!

I used this recipe for a banquet I attended thinking that it probably wouldn't taste quite as good as it looked, but honestly it turned out AMAZING! I added white and milk chocolate chips to a doubled (32 serving) version of this recipe. I rolled the dough onto a pizza pan covered in foil (which just fit) and baked for 25 min. after cooled I decorated it with frosting. Everyone loved it and it turned out great, thank you!

Perfect!  I made it on a large cookie sheet and it was beautiful!  Good soft texture.  Instead of icing (who needs more sugar?) I used chocolate chips turned upside down pressed into the cookie immediately after it came out of the oven to decorate.  Everyone was thrilled and the leftovers are great!

Well this is a decent and tasty cookie recipe. I'd recommend not spreading the cookie batter all the way to the edges unless you like really really crispy edges. I spreaded it all the way to the edge of the cookie pan and it grew up side the side of the pan and when it cooled it looked like it the rest sank inward...wasn't to pretty around the edges. But other then that, was tasty, the kids liked them. I cut off and trimmd the edges off for the kids and I didn't use nuts in this due to a neighbor child allergic to nuts. And added Chocolate Marshmallow Frosting from the site. I got rave reviews from all the kids and set them free outside with chocolate sugar highes. :)

Love it! Love it! Love it! Didn't do anything different to the recipe. Baked it for the twenty min. it turned out perfect. I'm just hoping next time I'll get to decorate it before they start eating it.

I wanted something different for our anniversary and this hit the spot. Very easy to work with..easy to cut into heart. This does spread a little but I used margarine instead of butter and that was probably why. I will be making this for other occasions.

This is great and very easy to make.  Taste ever better when you bake it on a Home and Garden Party Stone.  I also removed some of the batter as sugested by others.  Just make a bar cookie out of the left over batter.  Also as an added touch you can frost with chocolate frosting.  I will make this again and again.

A big hit! Yes, it overflowed the pan, and I actually had a fire in my oven. But next time I'll be sure not to spread the mixture too close to the edge of the pan. And I'll put foil on the rack below in case it drips again. Because there will be a next time! Tasty and fun.

This is a very sweet and good cookie. I added some white choco chips along with the semi sweet standard into the mix to change it up a little. I baked these in a cake pan and all 3 came out perfect! I iced the top and the kids went nuts with different toppings until they had their own creations. We cut them with a pizza slicer when they wanted a piece because they are so big!!

This was seriously the best cookie dough I have ever tasted! I did have to add a little over 1/2 a cup more flour, and just used a whole bag of chocolate chips, and it turned out great. I put it on a cookie sheet, my son wanted it football shaped so it didn't have to be round! It is the only big cookie I have ever gotten to turn out, and it was huge! He was happy, I was happy, and the whole sixth grade class was happy!

Fantastic recipe.  I used a smaller pan so didn't need the entire mix - and my batter still overflowed when cooking........i learned my lesson.  Dont push the batter right to the edge of the pan & only put enough batter in so it's about 1/3" high.  Very tasty - and I got many compliments on it.  Thank you!

First things first: For absolute best results, use 2 8 or 9 inch cake pans!!! Seriously, I made this recipe exactly as is when it came to ingredients. I put the batter into 2 9 inch cake pans, one square, one round, so I could cut the round in half and put the two together for a heart cake. I made this last night and decorated it, and it was HUGE. It is almost entirely gone today because it was absolutely delicious!!

Perfect for making the famous mall "Cookie Cake" at home.  I followed the recip with one change (egg replacer for allerigies) and it came out great!  I made it in a 16" pizza pan and it fit fine.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I took MMGBOSSLADY's suggestion of adding cream cheese .. but added only 1/2 cup. They turned out really good. My son, who does not eat cake or icecream, loved it for his birthday. I melted some darh chocolate and layered it on top. Will surely make these again .. with the cream cheese.

This makes a perfect cookie cake.  The only alterations I made were to substitute 1/2 cup shortening for half of the butter and to omit the nuts.  I got many rave reviews (including 3 marriage proposals)!  The strange thing is, I think this recipe makes lousy cookies, but for some reason the cookie cake turns out amazing. Don't discount the recipe just because you're not a fan of the Tollhouse cookie recipe.

My 3 year old son and I made this cookie for Father's Day. I don't have a pizza pan, so we used two pie pans. I lined the bottom with parchment paper, and left a half inch around for the batter to spread. We all enjoyed this special treat!

I have made this a few times now. I bake the cookie in a pizza pan and leave an inch and a half border around the cookie dough. I lower the oventemperature to 325 midway between baking and turn the pizza pan to ensure even cooking.   It is so much easier and better than baking someone a birthday cake and they always love it. I decorate it depending on the occasion. It always gets great reviews.

This is a great, easy recipe.  The kids think it's so cool to eat a giant cookie:)  I followed the recipe exactly except I don't have a pizza pan (cant find it since we moved:()  I read about other people having theirs spill over the sides of the pan so deiceded to use a 9 inch non stick, spring form pan.
No parchment needed, and it's deep so it absolutely wont spill over.  Just let it cool a while and release the spring sides.  Comes right out and flips onto the cooling rack.

I got a PERFECT soft cookie!  I used a 14 inch lipped pizza pan and lined it with parchment cut a little larger than the pan .  I also used 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup butter which always decreases the amount of "cookie spread".  I used all the flour but did reduce the salt to 1/2 teaspoon, and used a mixture of semisweet and milk chocolatea chips totalling about 1 3/4 cups.  I spread the dough all the way to the edge, thinking the lip and parchment would control it, and it worked perfectly-- I used all but maybe 1/4 cup of the dough.  I baked it at 350 and the edges didn't overbrown.

Overall, great recipe. Giving it a "four" only because of all the adjustments. I spent a lot of time reading other reviews and combining lots of different advice. As for ingredients, put in only 2 cups of flour, 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips and 1/2 teaspoon salt (my dad, a professional cook always taught me to put in half the salt called for in a recipe). I made it in a 12" pizza pan...the cheap, disposable kind that can be purchased at the grocery store. Greased and floured pan. Used all dough minus 1 cup. When spreading the dough, left 1" border from the rim to allow the dough room when baking. Came out of the pan well...though I took my time with it. Baked it in between the 350 and 375 marks on the middle rack for 18 minutes. Used the left over dough for individual cookies. Baked those on a stone for 10 minutes at same temp as large cookie. My kids and husband devoured it all. My husband suggested we go into the cookie business!

This has replaced my old choc chip cookie recipe!  It was delicious - soft and moist.  Great fun for my kids to help out with.  Following other reviewers, I removed about 1 1/2C batter before I baked it (and I have a 14in pizza pan!).  That worked well, although I should have decreased the baking time a few minutes.  I'll probably make this for our next kid's b-day party and have fun decorating it.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Barb!

This is a wonderful recipe!  I didn't have a round pizza pan, so used a cake pan for part of the dough and used the rest of the dough as regular cookies. The one in the bigger pan had a softer consistency and the regular cookies are crispy.  Awesome!

It came out great. I used a pan with sides for two reasons. One was the over spill everyone was mentioning. The other was I wanted the cookie itself to have sides more like a cake instead of having side like a regular chocolate chip cookie. I decorated the cookie for a Birthday. I'm going to make it again today for my grand daughters Birthday, maybe I'll get more creative with some frosting on the top.

People this is a totally standard chocolate chip cookie recipe (check the back of your nearest bag of chocolate chips)... and your giant cookie will turn out perfect!! Just spread it evenly in your pan and bake.

Great stuff! I've made it many times and we usually eat it all in two days or less. I've found that adding only 2 cups of flour as opposed to 2 1/4 creates a less floury taste that is more appealing. We also typically add more chocolate chips than called for just because it is yummier :) Enjoy! :)

Awesome!! Instead of baking this in a pizza pan I used a medium cookie sheet. I omitted the nuts and baked it for about 22 minutes. I had some left over cookie dough which I just made into cookies. I refridgerated the rest of the  cookie dough while the big one was baking. When it was done I baked the rest for 7 minutes. I used a buttercream icing to frost the cookie cake. I also ran out of parchment paper, so I used aluminum foil sprayed with a little bit of cooking spray. I was able to slide it right off when it cooled!

I can't actually comment about this recipe because of the disaster it created in my oven.  DON'T USE PIZZA PANS with the HOLES in them!!  It didn't even occur to me that this could be problematic but it very much was.  Little bits of dough fell to the bottom of the oven almost immediately.  It was smoking within 3 minutes.  This, then, created a super-preheat scenario in the oven that then made the cookie too brown.  In case you didn't think about the potential issues that would come with a perforated pizza pan--DON'T USE A PERFORATED PIZZA PAN!

I made this in 2 9-inch cake pans, using Nestle's dark chocolate chips and added 1/4-1/3 c. ground pecans to the batter instead of chopped nuts.  It came out just right, soft and chewy!

OMG!  So so so so good!  I didn't change a thing about the recipe as far as the ingredients go, except for using half semisweet and half milk chocolate chips.  I used two 12-inch pizza pans lined with parchment and baked for exactly 18 minutes at 360 degrees (baked one pan at a time).  I couldn't even wait until they were cool:  I dug right in and cut myself a wedge while still pretty warm and melty.  Absolutely delicious!  Thanks for a real winner.

Don't understand these ratings.  I followed the instructions perfectly without good results.  The batter tasted good, but cooking it at 375, the edges burned and the center did not cook through, not to mention the texture was too fluffy for cookies.  I have made better giant cookies using the bagged dough.  One tip - after baking, to get the good giant soft cookie, press the dough down firmly after letting it cool for about 5 minutes.

Made this for my husband's birthday because he does not like cake or ice cream. This was a HUGE hit. I followed the recipe exactly except I used half semi sweet and half extra dark chips, and as suggested by another reviewer, I used parchment paper in my pizza pan because I have the style with holes in it. Everyone LOVED it and they want me to make it every week.  I may try it with a little less sugar next time--was very sweet.

This recipe is so close to my own that my husband had no idea that it wasn't my usual cookie recipe. 

I wasn't feeling very ambitious to make the usual 4 dozen cookies with my recipe late at night so hubby had for work the next day and the giant cookie was the answer!  I only used 2 cups of flour and cut back on the salt as well.

5 Stars and two thumbs up for letting me get to bed sooner! =)

I made this exactly as is.  Only difference was the pan - I used a 15" circle cake pan.  It turned out perfect and even popped out of the pan easily and in one piece.  Tasted so yummy!  Baked for 20 minutes.

Made the cookie as the directions posted.  Only change was for milk chocolate chips, not semi-sweet.  At first I though the edges were going to be hard, but it was all the same soft consistency throughout.  

I made it in a 14" pizza pan that has holes in it.  It had a 1/2" edge.  I made a round of parchment to the size of the bottom.  I also sprayed pam on the pan before putting the parchment in to help with the sides and to keep the parchment stay put.

After laying the dough in the pan, I wet my hands lightly and formed it into a disc leaving it about an 1" from the edge.

Tasted great and I will make it again.  Highly recommend.

This is a great recipe, if you lose track of it, it's on the back of Nestle's toll house semi-sweet morsels bag. As a variation, I've added a 1/2 cup cocoa & 1/2 cup coconut, 1 tbspn cinnamin, 1/2 tspn nutmeg & 1/2 tspn spicy black pepper . . . they are great!!!

The cookies are very tasty, easy to make and fun! I made them in two pie cans that were 9.5 inches. They turned out very fluffy and good. If you are looking to make a giant then this is the recipe for you. :)

My 1st attempt has turned out unbelievably perfect! Yes, it's the Nestle Toll House recipe, but the bake time was extremely helpful. I used a 12" round pizza pan and put the extra dough in the freezer.

Yum, yum!  Very easy and great flavor.  I used two 9 inch pie plates and it worked beautifully.  You don't need to worry about the dough spreading because of the higher sides.  Tastes great frosted!

This worked great as a giant cookie, and I used a lipped pizza pan. The boys were impressed.

OK--given my screen name-I cannot believe I have never made a cookie cake!  This was quite enjoyable.  I did add in 1 tsp of baking powder as well and I got a little crazy adding in all different flavor chips.  YUMMY!  Now I am on a roll and made one adding in 3/4 cup peanut butter and milk, white, semi and peanut chips, and mini m&m's.-HOLY GOODNESS!  Oh and for a fun treat for a friends b-day I saved enough cookie dough to make a smiley face with and added in a few tbsp of cocoa ..and after spreading the regular dough into the pan..I plopped the chocolate dough into a smiley face figure on top and just patted it down alittle.  It was wasy cute.

Great. Barely changed a thing in the recipe  besides adding 2 tsp of vanilla extract and using 1/2 semisweet and 1/2 milk chocolate chips. Lined the pan with aluminum foil and pam'd it. Cookie was super easy to take off. Followed the cook times as stated. My brother is a HUGE chocolate chip cookie fan and I made this for his birthday. He ate half of the cookie in one sitting, again great recipe!

good recipe.  i followed the recipe exactly, except used a little less than 2 cups of flour as i prefer buttery, not floury/crumbly cookies. really don't know how people get them to stay in shapes like hearts! ... mine spread out to fill the whole pan

two tips - don't overcook (take out at the minimum time) and i really wouldn't reduce the 1 tsp salt... when you're using 1 1/2 cups of sugar, 1 tsp salt is not much and you need something to cut the sweetness

YUM!  I used a 12 inch pan, and put an airbake cookie sheet underneath to catch drips (we didn't have any though).  It was excellent.  I lowered the heat to 325 and cooked longer but it still wasn't quite all the way done in the center, which was perfect.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used light margarine instead of butter.

This recipe was pretty fantastic!I originally decided to make it because i love the giant cookies at old chicago and thought it would be a fun thing to try. I however bought a 15 1/2" pan from target that was actually intended for pizzas.it had holes in the bottom which did make a mess in my oven but did not start anything on fire as other reviewers have written.I would look for a pan without holes but this one is not too bad.Make sure you leave 1-2" across the edge of the pan to prevent it from overflowing into your oven.Tasted fantastic!my dad could not get enough!

I thought this turned out quite good (though mine was also pretty dense). Some friends said it was really salty. And it possibly was--though I like ccc's to be slightly salty (as is normal). I don't know why, I followed the recipe exactly.

I made very few changes to this recipe: reduced both sugar slightly, omitted the salt and walnuts and used only 200g of plain choc chips as that was all I had. My pizza pan was nowhere near big enough (10 inch?) so I used that plus 2 small cake pans. Remember to leave a gap between the edges of the mix and the edge of the pan, as the cookie will expand. OMG!!!!!!!!!! The closest thing I know to choc chip heaven! 200g of choc chips is PLENTY! This is the "cake" I want for my next birthday and probably quite a few in the future. Thanks Barb.

Delish!  I made this for a friend's birthday, decorated with frosting and those candy letter, it was a hit!  I read the reviews about the spillage, so I divided the recipe into 2 and put each in a 9-inch pie pan.  It worked great, although like someone else said, make sure you don't make the batter too thick or the middle won't get quite done.  Also, I omitted the walnuts and had no problems.

I've made this recipe 4 times now, and each time it comes out perfect. I agree, however, that a bigger pizza pan is needed. Today, for example, I made only half a recipe's worth, and it *still* took up a 12 inch pizza pan. Also, I've made this with sliced, toasted almonds instead of chocolate chips and then topped it with cream cheese and berries.

My grandson wanted a cookie cake for his birthday.  I bought one last year and it was very dry so I decided to find a recipe and bake one.  I read all the reviews and am grateful so many people took the time to write. I did what many people suggested.  I cut the flour to 2 cups, left out the salt altogether, and doubled the vanilla. I used a regular pampered chef cookie sheet and left a space around the pan so the cookie could expand.  I lowered the over from 375 to 350 and baked I for 22 minutes. My grandchildren loved it so much 4 of them have put in advanced orders for their birthdays.  Needless to say that made me a very happy grandma. It was moist and not to sweet even though I did decorate it with Happy Birthday Chris.

fun and easy - pretty much followed the recipe except to reduce the salt to a 1/4 t. and added a box of pudding with the sugars.  I also divided my dough in half and used an 11 inch tart pan to bake it in (11 - 15 minutes at 350 degrees using my convection oven). The scalloped edge made a pretty presentation and I could use 2 cookies to make 1 large sandwich cookie if I wanted.  Will definitely make again and again.

I made this last Monday because we were craving cookies but I wasn't in the mood to go through the trouble of making pan after pan of individual cookies, and I had this recipe I wanted to try for family parties. My oldest son and husband absolutely loved this! My only problem was my fault...I used a round pizza pan smaller than the one suggested, and the cookie dough melted and expanded and overflowed the pan into my oven. I was guessing at the size pizza pan I had on hand, and was apparently off by a few inches! But, the mess was surprisingly easy to clean up and didn't affect the finished product at all. The cookie was soft and chewy and buttery. My husband said it would be perfect served warm with vanilla ice cream, and my son just keeps asking me to make it again. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This tasted just like the cookies you find at mall cookie companies.  I followed the recipe exactly, and had perfect results.  I turned it into an activity with my 3 and 5 yr old kids, and they had a blast.  We called it "the world's biggest cookie" and they were fascinated.  We kept the decorating simple and put a few red and green sprinkles on for the holidays.  I will definitely make this again, possibly for my son's birthday party.

If you have chocolate chips at home you have this recipe...but I didn't have the bag so I'm glad someone posted it! It's the same cookies we all grew up with. However, tonight I made some changes which resulted in a less than stellar cookie. So learn from my mistake: don't use all white sugar unless you want a super crispy cookie, add extra dough to the edges if using a huge cookie sheet instead of a smaller pan,  and make something else if you don't have chocolate chips because a walnut cookie isn't as yummy as it sounds! Also, I think 375 is a tad too high. I reduced the serving to 4 and the recipe does scale down well.

Perfect.  When my husband wanted chocolate chip cookies for his birthday, I knew I wanted to make a big cookie and decorate.  This turned out well, although it didn't come out of the cake pan that well.  Next time I'm gong to do on my pizza stone and trim it to make it perfectly round.  Or maybe my spring pan.

Perfect recipe for what I needed - the whole family (and classrooms) enjoy this cookie.  I made one large cookie on a stoneware pizza round.  The first attempt the cookie expanded and ran off the edge.  No problem - just trimmed it up and disguised the rough edges with icing.  The second time I made sure to leave a little over an inch to the edge and it worked perfectly expanded out just to the end of the pan.  I decorated this with store bought icing and it looked cute.  The cookie has just the right balance between soft and chewy with a little crunch on the top/sides.  Will use this recipe for many kids birthdays.

This recipe is a favorite among my cooking students.  We divide the dough into 4 equal portions and bake them on 9" pizza pans for 20 minutes.  We use butter as margerine tends to spread more. (Perhaps that's the reason some are experiencing the spillage.)  Each 7th grade student has their own cookie to take home . . . if it gets that far.

I made this for my husband to take to work for his birthday, and it was a huge hit. Everyone raved about how good it was, and my husband's specific comment was about the moist, chewy center. I made the listed recipe, other than not adding the walnuts, and then baked it in a 12in. round cake pan (as my pizza pans are still in the process of being moved to our new home). As other reviewers state, this dough does expand generously, and in a 12in. cake pan this means it made more of a large cookie bar cookie than just cookie. (As it expanded upwards.) So if you're using the more recommended shallow pan, I would say to be careful so it doesn't overflow. But I will definitely be making this giant cookie again, and again!

I have made this twice and both times it has come out perfectly! I have not had the spillage problem that others had.  I did use a 14" slightly heavy duty pizza pan with a high edge, so maybe that's why it didn't spill over.  I didn't leave any room between the edge and the dough--I pushed it right to the edge and the whole thing cooked perfectly in 20 minutes.  I did line the bottom with parchment and ran some shortening over the edges and it came out of the pan with no problem!  My daughter can't wait to bring it in for her Valentine's Day party at school!

Amazing!!!  I've never found a cookie cake recipe that worked.  But this one was perfect!!  I did add 4 oz. of cream cheese.  And to spice up the presentation I put it in a 14" Papa John's Pizza box.  But then some didn't believe I actually made it.  lol

I cooked two cookies instead of 1. I had one with chocolate one without.  They were amazing and easy to make.  I would definitely recommend this to everyone. The one problem with this recipe is you have to resist eating all the cookie at once.

I followed the recipe exactly and spread this on a very large round pizza pan.  I had left several inches around the outside of the pan, which was good because the cookie does spread out as it bakes.   I was worried that the cookie wouldn't bake all the way through in the center, but it came out perfect and my kids were very impressed!  Next time I will either leave out the salt or not use as much - I could taste it and I don't think cookies should be salty!

I made this yesterday with the little girls I nanny.  They had a blast baking and decorating it!  I used a 14 inch round cake pan.  We piled the dough in the middle of the pan, placed parchment paper on top and smoothed it out until it was about 2 inches from the sides. It cam out great!   Has anyone tried to take one of these cookies out of the pan in one piece?  I was nervous it would break because it's SO big.

DELICIOUS!!!!! It was a huge success! I placed the batter into two round cake pans (I should have used a springform pan) but it turned out really well. I then used Betty Crocker Buttercream frosting for the writing and melted some dark chocolate to drizzle over the cake. I then placed vanilla bean ice cream inbetween them to make a super ice cream sandwich. My boyfriend was truly pleased and surprised!

This came out AWESOME!!! Used a 12" pizza pan and still had dough leftover for about 7 or 8 large cookies on a cookie sheet! Kids flipped over them! Thanks for sharing this! This is my new "from scratch" giant cookie!

Has no one else noticed that this recipe is nothing but the Toll House chocolate chip cookie dough recipe?  I still have to give it 5 stars though-it really did turn out great.  I was amazed how easy it was.  Definitely leave room around the edges for spreading.

This was a hit for my son's 8th birthday. I left out the nuts, and made two 9 inch cookie "pies" from the recipe. I think less chocolate would have been better. Maybe 1-3/4 cup. This stored well too.

I made this recipe according to the directions.  This is NOT my favorite cookie recipe.  Waaaay too much sugar!  And I have a sweet tooth!  Next time I will use less sugar and more flour.  This cookie spread out so much, the edge over baked and was very crisp and brown.

Very similar to the Wilton Giant Choc Chip cookie recipe, but larger. I love the Wilton one and the pans to use are very cheap. Find them online for only about $7. They make great cookies each time and have the recipe for that pan on the back.

A great cookie, although as others have said it's the Toll House recipe exactly.  I didn't incluse the nuts, and used the mini chocolate chips (Hershey's) instead of the regular-sized ones. Made it for my husband for Father's Day.  Also, as mentioned by other reviewers, make sure to leave some room around the edges when spreading the dough into the pan because the cookie will spread and needs somewhere to go (otherwise it may run up and over the sides of the pizza tray/pan.)

Made in a 12 inch aluminum disposable pizza pan and turned out excellent. The cookie was so moist and baked perfectly. I piped frosting on top and served as a birthday cookie. I will def. make this again. Super easy and super delicious!!

I make all the cakes for office birthdays and some people just like cookies better. This was Fantastic! I found a 16" pizza pan at Wal-mart and that was perfect. This is also great for a kid's party, and it travels really well. I have also used an oatmeal butterscotch cookie and it worked out fine. People are so amazed and it's so much easier than making cookies. Try it! I wish everyone at work wanted a big cookie!!

This was delicious.  However, be careful about overfilling your pan.  Mine spilled over the edge and made a huge mess!  Next time I will use a larger pan.

Turned out beautifully!  I reduced the flour to 2 c., didn't add nuts, and baked in a 12" pan at 360 for 25 min.  I also placed parchment paper under the cookie for easy removal.  No need to put any on the top.  I left 1" around the edge and it spread perfectly.  I also left out approx. 1.5 c. of the dough (due to 12" pan) and made 6 individual cookies.

I made the cookie in a heart-shaped pan and it baked perfectly for my husband's birthday dessert.  Instead of just chocolate chips, I added a mix of chocolate chips, mini m&ms, and mini reeces pieces.  Some of our guests had thirds!

this really hit the spot! I was just looking for a recipe for choc. chip cookies and came across this one. i used a 16" pizza pan, but I scaled the recipe down to 12 servings(i didnt want it to overflow)and it was plenty enough. I used semi sweet choc chips and white choc chips along with walnut chips and it was wonderful. I followed the suggestion of a user and lined the pan with foil and sprayed with Crisco flour/shortening spray. I put the dough in a ball on the foil and covered with parchment paper and rolled the dough out evenly with a rolling pin abt an inch from the edge of the pan. (You dont want to roll it all the way to the end or it will bake over the edge of the pan). I didnt have any problems at all with it sticking and it came out very nice and chewy- i even took a large biscuit cutter and made a few "sandwiches" with vanilla ice cream in the middle and froze for later-yummy!! thanks for the post :D

I just made two of these giant cookies and they turned out great!!!  I didn't add the nuts, and I used a large (16") pizza pan to bake them on.  I put parchment paper on the pans before spreading out the dough, and it was so easy to remove the cookies after they were done baking!!  I lowered the oven temperature to 325* and baked each cookie for approximately 27 minutes; covering them the last 5 minutes of baking to avoid overbrowning.  I did trim the edges of the cooled cookies that were crunchy, and I will decorate them tonight with just a little chocolate buttercream icing! Yummy!!

I took the advice of other reviewers and decreased the flour to slightly over 2 c. and the salt to 1/2 t.   I used the disposable foil pizza pan from the grocery store (12").  I used all of the batter (with the exception of a few spoonfuls that I lost to my helpers) and pressed it down to within 1" of the edge of the pan with parchment paper.  I also decreased the oven temp to 325 degrees.  The cookie did not overflow the pan.  I cooked it for about 28 minutes.  Decorated for son's school birthday party with a tube of store bought frosting and it was a big hit.  Thanks!

Yummy!  This was perfect! Everyone thought I bought it at Mrs. Fields.  Instead of 2 cups of semisweet, I did 1 cup milk chocolate and 1 cup semisweet.  It turned out great!  Thanks!

Yum! =)  Followed the directions exactly, except that I had to line my pizza pan with foil and then spray it with nonstick cooking spray (it had holes).  I didn't have parchment paper or anything, so I just kind of smushed it in a flat, circular shape with my hands, leaving about an inch from the edge of the pan.  Kind of sticky, but it didn't bother me!  Absolutely no overflow. =)  The only thing is that the cooking time seems to be a little off.  I set the timer for 20 minutes, and I checked the cookie with about 5 minutes left.  It was done.  Any longer, and I would have had a burned cookie.  I might have used a slightly bigger pizza pan than the one recommended (making a thinner cookie), so I would suggest just checking your cookie at about the 14 minute mark to see how it's going!  Tastes great!  Looks great! =)

I didn't actually use this recipe because I used chocolate chip cookie dough in the tube from the refrigerated section of the grocery store.  I only searched the recipes to find out how long to cook it.  For all you people that had spills all over your oven-Have you ever heard of parchment paper!!??  If you roll your dough out on parchment paper, the dough stays put, will not spread at all.

This is the tollhouse cookie recipe.  I enjoyed the circle shape but I also make them into bars by putting them into a rectangle pyrex and cooking for 25 minutes.

Fantastic!  I followed the instructions exactly, except I used a 12 inch pizza stone to cook it on.  I took out 1 and a half cups of batter as other reviewers mentioned, and it worked out great!  My SO said it was the best tasting cookie hes ever tasted.

Excellent!  My husband requested a cookie cake for his birthday so I used 2 12" pans as mentioned in other reviews and divided the batter.  I used the buttercream recipe on this site and it was perfect.  The cookie was nice and moist and got raving reviews.  
Thanks Barb! A definate winner!

I made this recipe for my great grandson's 5th birthday. When he saw it his expression was priceless! Instead of 2 cups of chocolate chips I used 1 cup of choc chips and 1 cup of M&M's. It was a big hit. I will definitely be making this again!

My first giant cookie and it turned out wonderful!  As others have mentioned, this cookie does spread so I did follow their advice and did not spread to the edge of the pan.  I did, however, follow the recipe exactly except for walnuts.  I decorated with store-bought frosting because I was very short on time.  Next time, I will make my own though.  The cookie was very moist and delicious....tasted better than the mall cookies for sure!

Made this today and it was a hit! I did the 2 cups of flour, half the salt as suggested. It made a 14" pizza pan and 9" cake pan. PERFECTLY! I left 2" around the edges of both so it could expand and made the center thinner then the outsides. Just take out the 9" sooner of course! I did do it at 350 for a few min. longer.

Burning and dripping mess, smoking up the house!  I left 1.5" around the dough and it was dripping and burning in my oven within 5-10 mins.  It needed more flour than 2 1/2 cups.  (maybe press the flour into 2 1/2 cups?

This recipe is wonderful!  My nephew wanted a giant cookie for his birthday party instead of cake so I tried a few recipes and this is the best!!  You must use a 16" pizza pan as stated by other reviewers.  Leave 2" around the whole cookie and make the dough just as thick on the edges so you don't get crunchy edges.  I cook it at 350 for 20-25 minutes because my family likes it soft in the middle.  Thank you for a great recipe!  I don't even bother making individual cookies anymore.  I just use a pizza cutter and make slices.  One time baking instead of by the dozen! :)

This was the best cookie I ever made. I put it in two 8 inch cake pans and it turned out wonderful. I used other users advise and used 2 cups of flour and 3 teaspoons of vanilla. I also added some mini M&M's I had. I will be making these again.

This IS the Nestle Tollhouse recipe.  I've always had an issue with spreading the dough, and the tips about using parchment paper works!  Thanks so much!  If you use M&Ms instead of chocolate chips, save some to put on the top about half way through baking.  If you mix them all in, you won't see them on top of the finished cookie.

I doubled the recipe and made this in two 9-inch cake pans.  It was good.  I added m&m's.  The kids really liked it.  I served it with ice cream and hot fudge.

Love this recipe! My middle son doesn't eat cake at all! I always make him a "cookie cake" instead. Always turns out moist and delicious! I like to put it in two 9in pie pans, that way we can eat one while it's still warm and have the other for later! Thanks for sharing!

Excellent cookie cake, but don't pour all the batter into the dish. I used a 9" pizza pan and it overflowed and spilled into the oven making quite a mess.

I made this for Fathers Day we loved it!! I used 1cup white chocolate chips and 1cup milk chocolate chops and omitted the walnuts because of allergies. Cooking time is spot in for two round pans. I will be making these again.

This is the same recipe used for "Toll House" cookies and pan cookie found on the back of Nestle chocolate chip packages. I made this using my cheap electric pizza maker and followed advise from others. I rolled out the dough on sheets of wax paper (I ran out of parchment) after freezing for a few minutes, making it about 3/4 inch smaller than my pan. I placed the cookie in freezer after rolling for another few minutes in order to remove easily. I also made a whole in the middle because I was afraid it wouldn't bake evenly in the center. Cookie came out perfect.

I had to flip the cookie out onto a board, then back over to decorate the top as we decorated it for my daughters Pi day snack.  It did not seem to be quite done and it had baked its recommended time.  Is this a chewy cookie and could anyone reassure my that the cookie will be fine once it cools completely?

The cookie turned out really well. However, the time took much longer than suggested. We had it in for over 30 minutes, took it out and the center was still not finished. We had to put it in for another 15 minutes before it was done.

I've owned a Wilton Heart shaped cookie sheet for a while, and ) that I would attempt to make a cookie cake. Wow...I ended up having to add some more flour (almost a cup) to the finished dough, because even with the chips in it, it was still to "sticky" to spread. I used parchment paper and spread a very thin layer of shortening on it,  to prevent it from sticking. I also ended up baking it 28 minutes. I haven't had a chance to eat it yet (made it for the hubby and kids tonight). Also- for an EASY frosting idea..just take a regular size container of vanilla frosting, and add powdered sugar to it until it's piping consistency =) It's what I use ALL the time for my piped sugar cookies, and it's LOVED by all! Will post later about the taste =)

This recipe was great. I melted then cooled the butter a bit to make the batter a little bit wetter... I find that this helps the cookie retain its moisture. I cut the recipe in half and put the batter in a 9-inch round pie pan and cooked it for 20 minutes. It was perfectly round and flat on top, perfect for decorating. I added a little more flour because I live above 6,000 ft.

Yummm! I made this exactly like Barb said except I put it in 2 9" round pans. Delicious! I made it for my 2 boys for good behaviour at school bus stop. They loved it! It wasn't crunchy and it was kind of thick like a bar. Definitely will make again and again!

Absolutely Amazing, Everybody loved it and it went way faster than the store bought cake. I didn't have a pizza pan so I used two nine inch pie pans and it came out PERFECTLY! I had extra batter left over though. It was so easy to make and took so little time. The cookie was so moist and chewy everybody really enjoyed it. I had recipe requests and requests to make more for upcoming events. I will admit that I used King Arthur's white whole wheat flour because I didn't have all-purpose flour, but it worked wonderfully! Will make again, this is my go to dessert now and it is so much easier, quicker, and tastier than baking a real cake

I just wanted to say that YOU HAVE TO MAKE ThIS RECIPE!, However, I did not find this recipe on this site, this is infact my new permanent goto recipe for chocolate chip cookies that I found on joyofbaking.com. The only difference between this recipe and the one on that site is a half a teaspoon more vanilla on their recipe. There's even a video on that site of someone making the recipe. So although I have never made this recipe in the GIANT chocolate chip cookie form, I felt that I had to leave a review and rating on here to inform people that these make PERFECT regular chocolate chip cookies. The entire recipe makes approximately 4 dozen 3 inch cookies and you just put tablespoon sizes of the dough on a silpat or sprayed cookie sheet or w/e and bake at 375 for 10-14 minutes. DELICIOUS! And this coming from someone who has tried at least 2-3 other chocolate chip cookie recipes from this site that have turned out either cakey or rock hard after cooling. Stays chewy for AT LEAST 2-3 days if put in a covered container or wrapped in plastic or foil wrap. They could stay that way for even longer but I wouldn't know as they never last longer than that around here! Enjoy! PS: Make sure to use  LARGE eggs, NOT extra large or jumbo, I think it makes quite a difference as there's way more egg in an extra large egg or jumbo compared to a large egg.

Wonderful recipe; extremely easy to make and tasty to boot! And very fun to decorate, as well: soft enough to eat yet hard enough to wipe off your icing mistakes (if you made any!).

Yummiest cookie cake ever made.  Nice and chewy/moist.  Did up the vanilla to 1 1/2tsp.  Followed other reviewers advice and used vented pizza pan lined with parchment paper. Cooked very well.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out so wonderfully!  I have made it in two 9 in cake pans and also on a pizza pan, both worked well.  For the pizza pan I used a 15 1/2 in pan and spread the batter to about two inches from the edges.  Also, I used the other reviewer's tip to put parchment paper under it as well as on top to roll it out to the right size.  It is a big hit!!

AWESOME!!!  I made a huge oven-sized pan cookie for my 7 year old's birthday 'cake' for school.  I frosted it like a cake and used a pizza cutter to cut it.  The kids said it was the best treat ever!  I recommend if you're going to make it this big, to lower the temp, leave at least  5 inches all around the edges for spreading, thicken the edges so they don't thin too much and brown.

Really good, I did have a smaller pan, 12" and I had to cook it a few minutes longer because of the thickness, but it came out sooo good. Everyone loved it and a scoop of vanilla ice cream was a perfect addition!!

Easy, cheap alternative to Great American Cookie Co. Tastes good, but there's something about those darned mall cookies that can't be beat!   I searched high and low for a 16" pizza pan to no avail, so I ended up using 2 9" rounds. I had to decrease the baking time by almost 5 minutes, but it turned out moist and perfectly done. The only thing I recommend is adding more vanilla; otherwise, it's a good recipe.

Excellent giant cookie.  Dubbed by my friends as 'The Epic Cookie'.  I had to use a 12 inch pan.  Left a bit of the dough out so there wouldn't be any spillage, do to the slightly smaller pan.  No spillage!  Will definitely be making this again.

I made this recipe for my son's 9th birthday (and allowed him to decorate it himself.) I ended up cutting it down to fit into a container I'd saved from a purchased cake. I have to state that this is really NOT an original recipe, but is the exact recipe on the Nestles semi-sweet chocolate chips bag.

I made this for my hubby and son for valentines day.  I decorated it with the buttercream frosting from this site.  They both loved it.  It was nice to surprise them with something a little different but the same chocolate chip recipe that they love.  I will definately make this one again and will have fun decorating it for different events.

Excellent!  Tasted as good as or better than what we would buy at the grocery store.  My family ate it up in a day!

This is the same as the recipe on a package of Nestle chocolate chips. It is very good, but don't worry, you can find it if you're at the supermarket. I usually add more vanilla (~2-3 tsp) and people always love them. Also, it makes good mint chocolate chip cookies if you replace the vanilla extract with mint extract.

I made this cookie for my son's 7th birthday party and was a little nervous that it wouldn't come out of the pan well or that it would be too hard.  I wasn't able to flip it out of my pizza pan like another reviewer said, so I had to take the chance it would be good at the party.  Luckily it was great!  Very soft and good overall taste.  I had leftover batter (because of my pizza pan size) so I put the rest in a silicone cake pan - which I wouldn't recommend.  I wasn't able to get it done in the center and I battled getting it out of the pan.  Just use a metal pan for much better results.

I made this for my in-law's yearly christmas party and it was a hit!  Made it about 3 hours before party and I put it in fridge to make sure the icing stayed in place.  It probably sat out about an hour or so before we ate it and it was wonderful and SO soft.  Will deffinitly be making this again in near future!

Really great recipe!  I looked all over the web on how to make a "mall style" cookie cake and this is the recipe I searched for.  It came out PERFECT!  Mine only baked for 15 min and it was just right.  I've also used this method with store bought cookie mix and it's just as good.  Buying these pre-made costs about $30, making one costs $3!

This cookie was good. I didn't have a pizza pan though so I just put it in a cookie sheet pan with sides.I'm not sure if my cookie was thinner from putting it in the different pan or not but the cookie was done about 5 min sooner then the recipe said it would be. Good recipe though the cookie was chewy and yummy.

I followed the directions exactly and it turned out great! My only warning is: this cookie EXPANDS - I would recommend using a larger pan. I used a 16 in. pan and it expanded all the way to the edge. Be careful! :)

I followed the recipe exactly except I used a 12 inch pan, so I tried to use the rest of the dough to make separate cookies.  It didn't work, they all melted together.  The giant cookie turned out great though, and tasted great! Thanks.

I use Allrecipes a lot, but this is the first recipe I've rated.  I followed the recipe as written and it was delicious.  Be warned, though:  I used about a 16" pizza pan and the cookie spread out to the very edges (many others complained about overflow with smaller pans, and I can see why). 

My husband is picky and will let a batch of cookies rot before eating something he doesn't like.  This has disappeared.  Great cookie dough, lots of fun! I wrote on it with Luscious Buttercream Frosting, also from this site.  I'll be doing this again!!

This turned out very nicely; I made it for my future father-in-law's birthday and he declared it to be delicious and ate quite a bit all by himself! I was surprised at just how good of a cookie it was... I made it the day before I gave it to him and just covered with foil and it was soft, chewy, and very tasty the next night.  I was so scared it was going to spill all over into my oven, it came close, but it didn't! This is a great alternative to a traditional cake. Plus, it's much cheaper than buying the cookie cakes at the stores!!! I'll make this again and again.

I made this for a friend's 30th birthday party, due to a fit of nostalgia for the Fuddrucker's birthday cookies. I tried to make a round happy face, but the dough expanded when I baked it into the form of the pan. The cookie was sweet and gooey. mmmmm...

I did a trial run for my daughter's birthday and it did run over but I used a pizza stone and I accidentally melted the butter instead of softening it.  I'll be making it again!  Great recipe.

This was just what I was looking for!  Taste just like the big cookies you buy in the mall.  The only change I made was not using nuts.  I baked in a convection oven at 350 at about 10 mins.

I followed this recipe to the letter, spread it on a 15" round pizza pan and it overflowed all over the bottom of the oven, burnt and filled the house with smoke.

I love this recipe!!!!  I never thought about just using the recipe on the bag for a big cookie. So I was searching for a recipe to use for a going away party and this was great!!  I'm making it again this weekend for a birthday party!  This will definitely be a staple in my house!

For five years I have muted my enthusiasm for this recipe.  Now my word is out.  This is the most utilized cookie recipe I have.  Birthdays, soccer games, school functions, Christmas presents, this cookie is so versatile and so popular!  Everone asks for the recipe and it never goes out of style. None of us really like walnuts so we leave them out and never miss them.

Awesome!!  I baked in 2 10" silicone cake pans (Le Creuset) and it was perfect.  Because of the silicone pan it was really easy to get out.  Perfect golden brown, even, really yummy.  Better the next day.  I'd definitely make a day ahead.  I used 1 cup semisweet and 1 cup Reese's peanut butter, omitted the nuts.  My 2 yr old son was very excited when he saw it!

I made this into a heart-shape with my kids for my husband for Valentine's Day. It makes a lot. I ended up having 2 hearts (using 2 cookie sheets). The edges (where the cookie was thinner) got burnt, but it was easy to cut that part off with a pizza cutter.  We decorated it with pre-made icing. It's very easy and yummy!

Hit of my daughter's birthday party.  I used half the recipe for a 12" pan and it came out perfect.  Agree that it made one of the best chocolate chip cookies.  Plan to make this again, and again!

It's literally the recipe that's in the Nestlé Tollhouse Chocolate Chip bag. The only difference is baking time due to large pan vs. spoonfulls.
I halved the recipe, because I didnt want a super thick cookie.
I lined my 12" iron cast skillet with parchment paper and spread the cookie dough out, avoiding ~1"from  the sides, knowing that the cookie would spread out while baking. 
I took it out of the oven as soon as I smelled baked cookie, ~22 minutes. Left in pan for another 3-5 minutes and then slid the cookie out onto a plate by pulling the parchment paper. It was perfect

This recipe makes a very good, moist, giant cookie. This year I'm making it for Halloween and calling it a monster cookie. The only recommendation I have is to give enough room from the edge of the pan. I allowed only 1 inch. It was not enough room. The cookie spread over the edge.

I now make this EVERY year for both my daughters' birthdays. I don't change a thing with ingredients but I do cook on a 9x13 cookie sheet at 325 for 27 min. It turns out perfect every time!! I've given out this recipe several times over the years. Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

I made a cookie tonight. The only change I made was the pan I baked it in. I used a 12 inch spring form  pan. Greased well. Total baking time was 30 min at 375°.Easy release from pan.I am pleased with the results.

This is one of the best chocolate chip cookie recipes ever!  Cook it a little longer and it is very crisp, a little less a you have a beautiful soft dough cookie.  Either way it is delicious and a frequently asked for treat.

I made this in a normal pan, not a pizza pan and it still worked out relatively well. I cooked it for the full 25 minutes and it turned out really nice and crunchy on the edges and gooey on the inside

followed recipe exactly, but within 15 mins it spilled over edges of cookie tray, leaving burnt cookie droppings all over my oven.

I took a wild chance and tried to shape this in a gigantic heart shaped cookie. Within 10 minutes in the oven it was about to spill over the sides. I took the advise of others and quickly oiled two 9" cake pans. I scooped the gigantic blob into the pans and put them back in the oven to finish baking. It is very forgiving because it turned out great. Thanks for the recipe!

I made a few changes after reading the reviews: reduced the white sugar to 1/4 C, upped the vanilla to 1 Tbs, and reduced the flour to 2 C.  Baked at  350 F for 20 minutes, in two 9-inch aluminum pans, using parchment paper.  They came out perfect!

I made 1-1/2 batches of this batter and it filled a rimmed cookie sheet perfectly.  Baked 30 minutes at 325 degrees.  Used less salt per other reviews.  Everyone loved it and it came out great.  Perfectly cooked and even for decorating.

I made this for a work party, and it was a huge hit! I did some research before making it and made the following modifications:
-Heat the oven to 350°F.
-Use 2 cups flour.
-Use 1/2 tsp. salt.
-Line the bottom of the pizza pan with parchment paper.
-Spoon the dough into the center of the pan, and use a silicone spatula to spread and round it out.
-Leave 2" of space all around between the dough and the edge of the pizza pan.  This will prevent the dough from spilling over as it expands in the oven.
-Bake the cookie for 35-37 min., and turn the pan every 7 min. for an even bake all around.
-I bought 16" cardboard cake rounds at Michael's to use as the base for the cake.  When you take the pan out of the oven, cool the cookie in the pan for 20 min.  Then, place a cardboard round on top of the pan and turn the whole thing upside down.  Remove the parchment paper, take another cardboard round, place it on top of the cookie, and turn the whole thing upside down again.  Now your cookie will be right side up on its base.
-I bought Wilton icing tubes from Michael's to decorate the cookie.  They were cheaper than the ones at the supermarket and better quality.
-If you need to transport or store your cookie overnight, ask your local pizzeria for a pizza box.  They will usually give it to you for $2 to $3.  Once the cookie is in the box, generously wrap the entire box in plastic wrap.  This will keep the cookie from hardening.
-Use a pizza cutter to slice up the cookie.
-Enjoy! :-)

This was fantastic--a huge hit for my husband's birthday!  He had been talking about the big cookies he saw on a business trip, so I gave this a try.  I used two 9" round pans and took the advice of heaping the dough on the edges a bit.  We served it warm with ice cream on top, and it was perfectly soft from middle to edge.

I had the same problem with this recipe as others. It was wet and the taste was not as good as others I have tried. I used another recipe from the site and the cookie stayed together and I was actually able to make a true giant cookie.

It was so easy to make!  Love this recipe. I didn't have a pizza pan so I just placed the dough on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.  I made sure to have an inch or so on all sides to allow for the dough to spread during baking. Came out great!  Now, I just have to figure out how not to eat it before giving it to the birthday boy.

I made this in 2 round cake pans and baked for 20 mins....lined the pans with circles of parchment. Followed the recipe exactly otherwise. They turned out well, and I sent one of them next door to the neighbors who help shovel my walk when it snows.  Thanks for a very good recipe.

We followed the recipe exactly omitting walnuts. My 6 year old daughter measured it all and my 1 year old daughter did most of the stirring. I baked it in two 9” heart shaped pans, baked for 18 minutes at 350° and then stacked them for a Valentine's cookie cake. A real hit with my husband and the whole family. I will never buy slice and bake cookie dough ever again. I will try this recipe to make an oatmeal cookie with raisins or cranberries; white chocolate with macadamia, chocolate cookies with peanut butter chips; and so many more.

This was good, but not my favorite. I left the amount of salt called for since I didn't add nuts. I think the people that are finding this too salty aren't taking into consideration the nuts in the recipe. If adding nuts, add less salt, if not, add the amount called for. I did add a bit more vanilla. I give it 4 stars on flavor and 5 on the ease it is to make it.

I didn't use walnuts, and my pizza pan is only 13", so mine was slightly thicker. I used 1 cup chocolate chips, and 1 cup mini M&Ms. Turned out amazing!

I used this recipe in a small cookie pan and divided the dough in four piles. I added milk chocolate chips, flaked coconut and almonds to one, Reese's peanut butter Chips to one, pecans and semi sweet chips to one, and crushed Ferraro roche candies and white chocolate chips to the last. The result was a fairly equal amount spread into four different corners of the pan, creating four different delicious cookies to choose from! Experiment people! Variety is the spice of life

Delicious and easy! I will definitely make this again. Baked for 27 minutes in a quiche pan and it turned out soft in the center with a great golden crust across the top and on the edges.

I love a cookie cake! This is especially delicious with frosting. I use the Mint Buttercream Frosting (with vanilla instead of mint). I followed the suggestion of using a little less flour, and it worked very well.

I'm bot sure what to rate this, as there is probably a wide margin of human error on my part.  I read a ton of reviews, calculated and heeded a load of advice from everyone's recipe modifications and the cookie still turned out like a sugary hockey puck.

BIG HIT last time, and better than the cookie company recipe. I made mine in non-stick cake pans 8-9". I had read the reviews and left some space around the edge (1/2"). Making this again today for a grand-daughter's birthday on her request. First batch was for 2 birthdays, so that each child had their own cookie. I used ready made tube icing to decorate. Putting this on a recipe card today to make sure I don't lose track of this recipe. This is now a family recipe favorite!!

Omitted the nuts, halved this recipe, and baked in a 9 inch glass pie plate for 23 minutes. These were really good. I will most definitely be making these for parties.

This was really good.  I don't like standard chocolate chip cookie recipes because they usually have way too many chocolate chips (I realize I am probably in the minority with this opinion).  This recipe was perfect with the exception that it was a little greasy - a problem that I find inherent in chocolate chip cookies in general, and not a flaw in this particular recipe.   I doubled the vanilla as one reviewer suggested, and I did not add the nuts because my kids won't eat them, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly and baked it on a 16" pizza pan, and the cookie came out perfectly soft and yummy.

Made this recipe two weeks ago for a football party and everyone loved it! Per another review, I doubled it, baked it in a 16 inch pan at 375 for 28 minutes and it was perfect! Making another one for a teachers birthday today!

This is now the go-to easy birthday cake tha the kids want me to make.  I have made it as is and also made it substituting chocolate chips for the nuts called for (some people don't like the nuts in cookies).  Both turn out beautifully.  I have made homemade icing to pipe on but after making the cake I find it's easier to use the canned stuff since it doesn't take that much to do stars and letters.

FANTASTIC recipe! I used a little less salt, as per one review and baked it for closer to the 20 minutes to ensure it stayed moist. It turned out amazing...I'm still getting compliments a year later. I'm trying it this week with mini M&Ms...I hope it works!!!

Delicious! Normally, I'm a nut lover, but I left the walnuts out because I wanted just a simple chocolate chip cookie. I also left about an inch of room on the pan like previous reviewers suggested. It came out great! I also used all 2 1/4 cups flour and the cookie wasn't dry at all.

Wonderful recipe! The cookie cake we made was better than store bought. I also use this to make regular size cookies. For those that want to cut the recipe in half, know that 1/2 of 3/4cup is 6 Tablespoons- makes for easier measuring.

Came out great using springform pan.  Made 3 big cookies.  Followed others advice and only used 2 c of flour, 1/2 tsp salt, and doubled the vanilla.  Also used 1 c all purpose and 1 c white whole wheat.  20 min at 350 was perfect for a very moist cookie with nice firm edges!  Decorated with "cookie icing" recipe found on here and chocolate ganache, yum!

Great recipe! I used chocolate morsels instead of chocolate chips because it seemed more appropriate for a giant cookie to have giant chips. Didn't have a pizza pan, so I used two cake pans: one 9" round and one heart-shaped. I lined the pans with aluminum foil to make getting them out of the pans easy. The two big cookies were delicious and adorable!

Took someone's advice and made this in a 10 1/2 in spring form pan.  There was some dough left over, but it made a perfectly round cookie.  Great for my 2 year old daughter's birthday!

I made half of the dough, reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup white plus 1/4 cup brown, added 2 Tblsp. cocoa and left out the nuts because my kids don't like them. I also used whole-grain flour. I baked it in a 10-inch springform pan, the bottom lined with parchment paper, and baked it for 20 minutes at 350 deg.
The cookie came out great, very tasty!
The texture is a bit cake-like, but that's what I wanted anyway, and I think if you take the whole amount of sugar, it will come out more fudgy and crispy.
I made the cookie for my middle son's 6th birthday, he does not like cake, and it is a big hit! Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

I made this cookie cake for a Super Bowl party and it was extremely popular. The cookie was soft and chewy from edges to middle, and the flavor was fantastic. I frosted it with the frosting from this recipe: Cake with Buttercream Decorating Frosting. Everyone kept going back for more!

When I baked this fourteen inch cookie I tweaked it a little bit by not adding as much flour as the recipe said. I think I was about a cup short of the flour and it turned out great! It tasted more like a brownie than a cookie but my boyfriend and I loved it. I used pecan nuts instead and the texture was incredible. I would recommend this recipe and make it again myself probrably adding a little more pecan nuts and decorating it with peanut butter icing.

Turned out perfect.  Recipe made two 8 inch cookies in cake pans and one gingerbread man cookie (stuffed stainless cookie cutter and let cook in oven - thicker as couldn't spread).  Family enjoyed man cookie other two are in freezer as I contemplate using with ice cream between.  The round cookies are 1 pound each!  I also used one cup sweetened shredded coconut instead of walnuts.  Cooked rounds 25 min and man cookie 33min.  Lined cake pans with parchment paper for even browning - I cut paper in circle and used pam cooking spray to hold it down.

My daughter wanted a giant cookie instead of a cake for her birthday,so rather than buy one at the store I said I can make one.I just happened to have a 14 in. pizza pan.It was a big hit with the teenagers.They all thought it was "awesome".My son that turns 34 today requested I make one for his birthday. I also made one for our school's annnual auction,they had silent auction baked goods table,it went sold for 10.00 then I also donated a gift card to make one whenever someone wanted one.I can see I'll be making this ALOT.

I made this recipe in two 9-inch pie plates and they turned out perfectly. I sent them off with my husband to his job and between four guys both cookies were gone in an afternoon. Definitely a keeper! And this is the only way to make cookies if you can't find time to sit around waiting for different batches... plus then you get an awesomely huge cookie!

Easy, had most of the ingredients already on hand. Made in two pie plates for my daughter's birthday. Used canned Duncan Hines chocolate frosting for decorating. She loved it, her friends loved it, and their parents loved it. My son has already requested it for his birthday as well. Good recipe!!

This cookie is pretty much fool proof. It taste delicious. However, I didn't bake mine as long as the recipe called for and it made a little too much dough for my pizza pan. I usually make a big cookie and a smaller one.

I'm not sure what is different about this recipe, but this was the best chocolate chip cookie I've ever made. I don't have a pizza pan, so I made it "bar" style in a 9x13 glass dish. It was pretty thick and took a while to get the center done, but turned out great!

To give credit where credit is due, I found that this exact recipe (except for the type pan) is the Original Nestle Toll House Chocolate Chip Cookies recipe. When getting out the chocolate chips for this cookie, I saw the recipe on the bag.

I use this recipe all the time - it's the exact recipe on the back of the chocolate chips bag.  I make mine in 2 8in pie pans, and I do that probably 3 times a month.  My husband loves to take them to work to share with his co-workers.  I have a really hard time knowing when they're done and they end up overcooked.  But that's on me.  Only suggestion is to sift the flour/bs/salt mixture - it does make a difference.  Actually sometimes I don't use the salt either which works fine, and sometimes I use peanut butter or reese pieces instead of chips  yum!

This recipe is great.  My son has food allergy's to Milk and eggs so I had to use an egg replacer, dairy free butter and dairy free chocolate chips but it still turned out great.  I used store bought decorative icing and this cookie tasted as good as if I bought it from the bakery.  (I made 2 cookies from the recipe in 9 inch round pans.)  Five Stars!!

I cut this recipie in half, left out the nuts, and baked it in an 8X8 square pan.  It was so good!  The cookie was about 2 times the thickness of a store bought giant cookie, a little fluffier than a regular cookie, but not too cake like, and soft (even the edges).  Will definately be making this one again and again.

Perfect!  Using a 12" pan, I covered about 2-3 cups of dough with parchment paper and rolled flat, leaving 1" all around to allow for spreading.  Baked for 18 min.  After the cookie cooled, I topped it with store bought, whipped frosting and sprinkles to serve as a birthday dessert.  There was enough dough left over to make an extra dozen  regular size cookies.  I can't believe I've never done this before - it's so easy!

The Cookie was HUGE! (I got so carried away with decorating it - I forgot to leave room to write "Happy Birthday!!!"  to my husband - The 4 kids are our children - cheering for their Dad!) It was a big hit in my family! I took "AudraFelix's" great idea and made a fabulous birthday cake for my husband! I baked the cake in a 18x26 sheet pan that had a lip and was covered with parchment papar. (I guess I could have baked it in 2x 9x13 pans - but I want's sure if i was going to decorate the whole cookie or fill it with ice cream. I wanted to keep the cake non-dairy - so i filled it with "Polly Welby's Excellent Chocolate Mousse" from this website (great recipe - no raw eggs!) I frosted the cake with some Wilton decorating icing and some "Sturdy Whipped Cream Frosting" - also form this website! I did use other reviewer's advise and scaled the flour down from 2 1/4 cup of flour - to just 2 cups. I left out the walnuts. I used Smart Balance non-hydrogenated margerine in this recipe in place of the butter - usually I can substitute it in cookies and get a similar result - but in this giant cookie - the cookie turned a bit too brown for my liking - I baked it at 350 for 20 minutes. The cookie tasted delicious - but it did not come out as light as the other pictures that were posted for this recipe. This is the same exact recipe as "Original Nestle® Toll House Chocolate Chip Cookies " from this website - so if you just plan on making these into cookies - I am sure they will come out gr

I made this recipe for my boyfriend's brother, at his request. I made one a few days before just so I had time to come up with a backup if needed. It turned out great the first time, so I made it for the actual birthday too. My only suggestion would be to use a very large pan and maybe not all of the dough. My first one went over the edges and almost to the bottom of the oven. I used the semi-convection feature on my oven to be sure that it was cooked all the way through. The birthday partiers loved the cookie. Personally, I think it is just a little bit to sweet, but good nonetheless.

This turned out great!  I made it for my daughter's last day at preschool.  I used another reviewers suggestion and put it in a disposable aluminum pizza pan.  I had about 1 cup of cookie dough left over, but the rest fit perfectly in the pan.  I wouldn't change a thing about it.  It looked just like the ones you buy in the stores.  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent!  Make sure to take out 2 cups of batter or you will definitely have batter spilling over the edges of your pizza stone!  I used parchment paper underneath, which worked great.

Excellent giant cookie recipe. Mine did spill in the oven but my fault. I put it on a 12" pizza pan. Next time will use the 14" or 16" to be on the safe side.

I halved the recipe and had to chill it before baking (I made it in the morning and couldn't bake it until evening).  Although this works wonders with little cookies, didn't work that well with this cookie, as I had to bake it a lot longer than stated and move it to the bottom of the oven to cook the bottom of the cookie.  So it was a bit more brown than I'd like but bf loved it.  He asked me if I forgot to mix the chocolate chips because apparently he had a big glob of chocolate.  So I must not have mixed very well, but he loved the cookie so I don't care.  I'll try to follow the instructions next time!  Thanks for the recipe!

This came out GREAT!  Made if for my son's slumber party, OOPS Crashover party (boys!!) and cut it up like a pizza.  I did add extra flour because it seemed too sticky.  It came out SO GOOD!  Make sure you leave the 1 1/2" around the edge because it WILL fill up the pan (used the cheapy pizza pan from Walmart).  Now I have to make this for EVERY party!!

YUMMY!  I made this for my son's prechool party in a 14 in pizza pan.  I left an inch all the way around before cooking, and it turned out perfect!  I only cooked it for 18 min, though, and had to use all granulated sugar since I was out of brown sugar.  I came home wiht an empty pizza pan, the kids loved it!!  Thank you!

Excellent! Ever since I clapped my eyes on a cookie pizza at Godfather's, I, a profound chocolate chip cookie fan, was wondering how much of each ingredient should be used. Very helpful for parties!

For my pan, I used almost all the batter (-1/2 cup) and spread it out within an inch of the edge.
The other review was right-- this is the exact recipe on the back of the Nestle chip bag.  It works well as a cookie pizza, though!

I made this for one of my son's birthday parties, because after 2 parties I'm pretty sick of cake. Everyone loved it!! I served it warm with vanilla ice cream and it didn't last long. I used 2 12 inch pizza pans and it worked perfectly. PLEASE do not try using one you will only have a mess!!

Great recipe!! I made this for a party and  cut it into squares. There was nothing left at the end of the party! Nice a soft and yummilicious. I messed up and added 1 tsp of baking powder and baking soda so it grew a little larger than the pan. But I just cut that off and it was still so delish.

My girls and I made these giant cookies, and had a blast decorating them for Mother's Day Cookiegrams. They were a huge hit! I left out the nuts, and reduced the sugars. I also divided the prepared dough to make 2 cookies in 12" pizza pans. You must leave 1-2 inches for cookie expansion. The only thing is I baked them for 18 minutes, and the edges still got quite dark and the cookies came out a bit dry. Would probably either lower temp. or bake less time next time.

My daughter made this today for her bf's birthday. I like the novelty of making one giant cookie, but I think the recipe would work better with a different batter. It was so thick that it was difficult to spread evenly, and even using a 14-inch pan, there was too much dough left over. I would try this again but probably use only the idea of the pizza pan and use the dough from one of my other chocolate chip cookie recipes, which don't seem to be quite as thick.

well..maybe I did something wrong, but this did not turn out for me, even though I bake cookies very frequently.  I made the recipe as bar cookies in a 10x15 pan.  They were dry and didn't have much flavor.  Maybe it was the mixture of milk chocolate and peanut butter chips that I used.  Better luck next time?

This turned out perfect!  I had a pizza pan with holes and a slightly curved edge that I covered with foil. (I might lightly grease the foil next time.) I purchased a can of white icing, tinted it and piped lettering and decorations on it. It looked as good as the ones at the mall and it tasted great. It was one of those times that you are half sorry that you invited the neighbors over because it turned out so good! Too few leftovers! Yum!

I used a 15x10 pan, prepared the recipe as listed (with the exception of the chips-- I used about 3/4 cup of peanut butter chips......also, didn't use walnuts) and it turned out really nicely.

I followed others advice and used a 12" pizza pan and also got 20 small cookies from the recipe.  I left a 1" rim around the pan to allow for spreading and baked 18 minutes.  They were almost perfect - just a tad brown.  Will try 17 minutes next time.  They cut perfectly.  I'm not sure what the reviewer was talking about who said the cookie was too greasy.  Perhaps they used too much crisco when they greased the pan.

As written this doesnt work. I think the key is you have to read everyine elses review....and you need a pizza pan with a rim or divide the dough into two pieces and use 9" cake pans. If you use a cookie sheet it just spreads out and gets too crispy. The flavor is good and yes its the tollhouse recipe. I will make this again, but need to purchase a large rimmed pizza pan. My 5 year old really wants a big decorated cookie cake.

it was pretty good but there's way too much dough for one cookie, i'd cut this recipe back by about 1/4.  the cookie tasted too greasy for my taste but my family really liked it.

Turned out so very good and stayed fresh for a couple of days so we could finish it up.  I made a 12-inch pizza pan and also a pie plate with the recipe and the pizza pan still overflowed a little. Tasted GREAT!!!  No need to buy one!!

Really good! it definitely expands to fill the pizza pan so when I tried to make a heart shape, the bottom closest to the edge actually started spilling over.  Best to center it in the pan if able!
I did put walnuts in it, but that is personal preference

Terrific!!  I made these for the first time with a couple of little ones, and they had a blast, but especially when we tasted this giant cookie.   Also, like all cookies, these will spread, so don't press them to the edge of the pan.  I used parchment paper and they were thicker at first, so I was a bit concerned, but in the end, they spread perfectly .  

Because of personal preference, I exchanged the vanilla for orange oil -- extra super yum -- and added 1/3 cup of coconut flour, an extra egg, and instead of walnuts, coconut.  

We are waiting for a picnic tomorrow to make it available to the world, but boy, that sample test is really terrific.  Highly recommended.

I didn't have brown sugar, only white and honey, didn't have enough chocolate chips, no walnuts, and my over door literally fell off while cooking this, throwing the temperature Lord knows where and making the over tilt so cookie ended up lopsided with 75% of the batter on half the pan and this thing still turned out AMAZING! I can't wait to try it when things work as they should :P

Following other suggestions I reduced salt to 1tsp in a doubles recipe.  I also needed all the flour because I used melted butter.  The cookie baked up perfectly on an aerated pizza pan covered with parchment paper.  I spread by hand with wax paper over the top

After making this I was very happy with the taste/look of the cookie.  However, making this was trickier than I anticipated.

I refrigerated the dough overnight as suggested by another, but when rolling out the dough I quickly realized that the whole thing needed to be wrapped in plastic which caused some issue as the dough spread out, I needed to keep adding pieces of plastic wrap.

Once rolled out, the next trick was moving this soft, flat, huge disk of dough.  I managed to not destroy it too much whilst moving and then removing the plastic, but it still was far from simple.

Lastly, the cooking time was  shorter than in the recipe; I only cooked it for about 20 minutes (turning it every 7 minutes) due to it looking like it was about to burn.

Overall, I probably won't make this again - I'd rather buy one from the store already made.

Do NOT make this in a pizza pan!! My cookie dripped through the bottom of the pizza pan and burned at the bottom of the oven, filling my apartment with smoke and triggering the fire alarms!!! What a waste of ingredients!!!!

Me and my Grandfather where making this recipes.  We put the brown sugar in twice by mistake. We put in more flour and more butter and made a random batch of cookies. Then  we stated the giant chocolate chip cookie recipe all  over again.  Surprisingly the random batch was good.

As another reviewer suggested, I made this in two 9” cake pans and it was incredible! Everyone ate it UP! I’ve attempted cookie cakes in the past to no avail and this one was perfection. I made buttercream icing and decorated it for our celebration. Absolute perfection.

As long as you leave 1/2 an inch for the batter to grow toward the rim, you won’t have spillage. My kids ALWAYS ask for this cake for their birthday!  I use the Pampered Chef Large Round Pan

This was by far the best chocolate chip cookie I have ever tasted! I will defiantly make it again. The first time I made it I didn't put the nuts in and it ended up really good. The entire family loved it (Even the picky eaters)! I will defiantly be making this again!

A version of this recipe appeared in the Dec/Jan issue and I made that one.  It has the same ingredients but called for using two 8 or 9" pans, and baked at 325 vs 375.  I followed the published recipe and in spite of an extra 9 minutes of cooking time, the cookies were not done in the center.  The flavor was good but I will use the website version next time to ensure more even cooking.

I too halved the recipe and baked it in a 9-inch pan. I used a silicone pan so the cookie slipped right out. Frosted with a whipped ganache and candies. Loved it and would make again for another occasion!

I followed the recipe as written.  The “cookie” was delicious and I didn’t have any problems.  I chose to bake them in two eight inch removable bottom tart pans.  Good texture, taste and presentation.  I will make this again.

This is our go to substitution for birthday cake.  The recipe steps forget to mention adding vanilla. We think 22 minutes cooking time  is perfect, and be sure to leave some space around the edge of the cookie before baking so it has room to expand.

This turned out far better then I anticipated. I baked it in two 9" round pans (One glass, one ceramic) since I don't have a pan big enough. I left an inch or so around the edge for expansion and both came out cooked perfectly through.

I made this recipe based on all the great reviews.  I can only give it one star - Unfortunately, the only things that were great about it was  how well it looked and that it was soft and chewy (the way I like my cookies). I wished that it tasted as well as it looked.  There was no flavor to it, taste more like flour - That wasn't just my opinion, it was the opinion of more than half of my son's basketball team.  I have never made anything the boys didn't love. I guess I should have stuck to nestle's recipe for this.

Made it twice - first time, perfection!  Second time, overbaked.  I would only suggest to really watch your bake time depending on your pan. The first time I used a round pizza pan and it was perfect, and the second time I spread it out in a larger rectangle and failed to cut down the bake time due to thinner "dough".  Super tasty though!  Will continue to make!

Made this in 2 9" springform pans.  Turned out great.  My family likes peanut butter so I added 1/2 cup.  Easy to transport after they're made.  Good texture and taste.  I'll make these again for my son who doesn't like birthday cake.

Delicious!  I put it on a pizza pan and thought I had it far enough from the edge but it did overflow. Made it for a birthday and everyone loved the cookie. Next time I’ll give it more room and put something underneath. Does not make good individual cookies

Made suggested modifications from comments section. 2 cups of flour, 2 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of salt...so yummy, moist and soft. Comments  are the best for most recipes, thanks to all the tried and true!  My whole family loved this massive cookie, especially my 8 year old twin food inspectors!!

I've made this cookie every year since my son was in third grade! Now he's in 11th and turning 17 and he still wants only this big cookie cake! It's delicious! I omit nuts and cut the chocolate chips back to 1 and a half cups and I think that's plenty. I line my pizza pan with parchment paper and cover it in wax paper as I roll it out with the rolling pin. It works a little easier if you have it  set in the fridge for a bit first. Let it cool and decorate! So easy and the most delicious cookie recipe I've ever used!

I used a 14" cast-iron pizza pan and withheld 4 cookies worth of dough, used just 1 1/4 M&M's, no nuts (someone is our group was allergic) and baked at 335 degrees.  I left 2" of room from the edge of the pan and so glad I did as it expanded all the way to the edge!!  After it cooled, I frosted with homemade chocolate buttercream and decorated it. It not only looked great, but the taste was a superb. I was asked to make it again!

Followed the recipe as written, without the nuts, and in two 9-inch cake pans.  Were perfect with some vanilla ice cream on top!

Added an extra egg yolk and cooked in 9 by 11 pan. Took a little longer to cook- 35 min maybe? Used half chocolate chips/half mms. 1.5 cups probably would've been enough. I've used many similar recipes and this ones definitely a keeper!

I also make this all the time but I usually use a 13X9" pan. I just cook at 350 for a bit longer. It makes the cookie a bit cakier(?) and chewy. Soooo Good!

This was a really great cookie. The only change that I made was to cut the salt back by half.  After reading some reviews I spread the dough on the pizza pan and left two inches around the outer rim for expansion. I made one large cookie, 27 minutes, and 18 regular sized.

I used two cups of flour, about .75 tsp of salt and two tsp of vanilla. I baked the two cookies in 9 inch cake pans until they looked done (I don't remember the exact time). I was afraid the hot, soft cookies would break so I left them to cool in the pans. I drizzled white and semi-sweet chocolate on top. These were soft, very good and super easy.

This is by far the best cookie recipe I've made.  Definitely recommend giving it a try - you will not regret it.  I used 2 - 8 inch pans and baked it for 25 minutes on 350° and it worked out great!

AMAZING!!! 
I did not have a pizza tray so I used two 8" cake tins instead. This worked really well! It had more of a brownie texture, and was a bit sticky but delicious nevertheless. I used baking parchment in the tin (going up the sides as well) and this meant that the cookie was really easy to turn out onto the cooling rack. The cookie was really soft when it came out, so the baking parchment really helped to stop it falling apart. I decorated it with M&Ms after seeing one of the pictures, and this made it eye-catching, and it also added a bit of crunch to the cookie. It is delicious warm and served with ice cream. 
The cookie ends up looking really dark and *chocolatey* if you use the 'dark brown soft'  sugar. So next time I think I will use 'light brown soft' instead. But it certainly didn't stop it tasting delicious!!! This would make a great gift, and it tastes as good as a Millie's cookie! I will definitely be using this recipe again.

really delicious and soft and chewy. I made it late at night so i didn't let it cool completely before trying a bite. I put it in the fridge overnight and it was much better in the morning. I halved the batter and used a 9" cake pan and it was really delicious. I also didn't have any chocolate chips or m&ms or walnuts so it was just basically a sugar cookie and it was still very very good. I will definitely make this again

I followed the recipe exactly! I made 4 adjustments, 1) I baked it in a  10 inch cast iron skillet, 2) put half the dough in and pressed to the edge with greased fingers, 3) melted 1/2 cup hazelnut spread in microwave for 30 seconds and spread over the layer and then put the rest of the dough on top and pressed to the edge, 4) baked it for 40 minutes at suggested temp. Came out beautiful and served with ice cream. Next time, oh yes there will be a next time lol, I will use the 12 inch skillet so it's not so thick

I made the cookie in Pizza Pan for my son's 14th birthday as he's a big fan of cookie cakes. All the kids love it. Worth making it. I added 2 and 1/8 cup of flour and feel if I added 2 1/4 it would still be ok. Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe.

This turned out great and was super easy and quick. The dough does expand though so next time I'll try to remember to use an extra pan. I doubled the batch and have a heaping cookie jar full. Great recipie.

this turned out super greasy.  I made it exactly as the recipe called for and was quite disappointed in how it turned out. if you like your cookies to leave a grease soon on a napkin, then this is the recipe for you.

I took the suggestion from another review here to use 2 round cake pans.  The turned out great, chewy and soft.
Will be making this again.

I make this cookie cake at least 5 times a year and have been doing so for probably 4 years. I follow the recipe exactly. The only thing I could possibly add to make this better is to suggest using a deep dish pizza pan for baking. After one overflow when I first made this, that seemed the logical solution and they come out perfectly every single time. I love this recipe and this is the only birthday cake my husband, 3 children and father in law request.

Excellent!  The wife and kids loved it!  The cookie turned out almost cakelike in a 9" pan.  It was perfect cut in pie slices.  I've made it twice, and I'm sure I'll make it again!

Good. I made this for a family birthday party.  I will use parchment paper as someone had suggested the next time, the edges had stuck to the pan. I also accidentally bought mm's that were filled with peanut butter, but everyone liked it.

I baked this recipe for 22 minutes( I'd do it a bit longer next time.)  And made a few changes. they were not adding the nuts, put chocolate chips in the dough and then white chocolate chip cookies on top before cooking  and also put only 2 cups of flour. the cookie pizza was a little crunchy on the outside and a bit to soft on the inside. otherwise it's DELICOUS!!!! Very good! I'd make it again. (you should make it!)

We loved it! Great recipe! I made it exactly as-is. I took another reviewers advice about making sure to leave 2" around the outside. I baked on a 15" diameter pizza stone. Will definitely make again.

My child requested a big cookie instead of a birthday cake. I used this recipe as written except I can't use nuts because my child is allergic. In place of the nuts, I used an extra cup of chocolate chips. Made it in a big Wilton cake pan (14") and it was absolutely perfect. The texture was great;  both soft and chewy. Everyone was very impressed and we had no leftovers.

This is a great recipie. I have been making cookies for a year now. been trying many recipes that Claim to be THE BEST. by far this is THE BEST. a few tips, use softened butter as requested. Do Not use melted. I used 2 cups of flour that way my cookies came out perfectly chewy and soft. I also added oatmeal. but only add in oatmeal in 2 cups of flour since it soaks moister. Good Luck!

I made this for my son's birthday party (he doesn't like cake or frosting).  It was super easy and turned out great.  Thank you for other people's tips on using a pizza pan, parchment paper and rolling pin.  It worked great...there was not a crumb of the almost 16" cookie left.  My son said the giant cookie tasted better than my regular sized cookies.  Will definitely make this again!

Perfection! I lined my pizza pan with foil. When I spread the batter I left 1 to 2 inches of space to allow my cookie to grow. I only used 1 cup chocolate chips plus topped it with M&Ms without pushing them down. I took it out of the oven after 18 minutes when the center was still soft but golden. Cookies always harden as they cool. So it came out thick, chewy, gooey yet firm. Store in foil, plastic or Tupperware at room temp, it lasts fresh for 3 days!

I made this for my son's 7th birthday and it turned out great! I put dough in the freezer for about an hour before I rolled it out onto a 16 inch airbake pan (the kind with the holes in it).  I rolled it in between 2 sheets of parchment paper and left about 1 1/2 inch around the edge for it to expand.  It turned out perfect! We will definitely use this recipe for many birthdays to come!

EXCELLENT recipe!  Made this for my FIL's bday, and everyone loved it. We used an 8x10 pan, so cooking time was a little different (I ended up doing an additional 15-ish min. A 9x11 prolly would have been the same cooking time as the round pizza pan). Will definitely make again.

I added m&m only on top for looks, and left out the walnuts. A edible transfer really topped the look of the cake off.. even tho I started running out of icing around the edges. Great recipe!

Came out great even though it was first attempt. I only used two cups of flour as suggested and cut back on the salt. I might use the whole tsp of salt next time though to counteract the sweetness. Also used a 12" pizza pan but my pan had holes in it and the cookie was a bit undercooked in the middle. I baked it for 17 minutes at 350. I might try a lower temp for longer next time. Although with any choc chip cookie, undercooked is always better than overcooked!! Also didn't use the whole batch of dough. I just spread it to about 1/2" thickness and left an inch of margin in the pan. Top tip: If you decorate with icing around the edges, no one will see the browned edges. I will definitely be making this again!! 

Editing to add: Made this for the 2nd time. I forgot I only used 2 cups of flour last time and this time used 2 1/4 per the recipe. BIG MISTAKE. Cookie is now cake-like, too much flour for sure. Doesn't have the chewy consistency of my first one. What a shame. Lesson learned!

This was a great recipe. My husband thought it was at first too sweet but then later said it was delicious. I love sweets and thought this was a perfect recipe. I did some experimenting with the batter in an 8" pan and small tiny bunt like pans since I didn't have the 14" pan. All types ended up delicious in their own way. I saw a review that the texture was off after cooking, I did notice in the tiny pans, where it cooked through quicker, the texture did look different, but it certainly didn't change the taste or turn me off from eating it. Those were my son's favorite kind. Another review mentioned leaving space or not filling up very high - I will agree with that after NOT following it and needing to readjust my pans and batter. The only issue I had with this is it makes so much and I love cookies so much that I've probably put on 5lbs over the holiday weekend ;)

Bottom line, I will use this receipe again and again.

I just made this earlier today. I used a springform pan and didn't have any spillage issues. The center did appear to be undercooked after it had cooled for awhile, so I put it in the fridge to firm up and it's perfect.

Made this for my sister's birthday. It was a last minute decision. I had all of the ingredients but no pizza pan. Put most of the dough into a greased springform pan and the rest in a pie plate. She was so surprised and the guests all gave it a thumbs up.

Made two versions, one diabetic for my hubby with Splenda products, the other with cocoa powder as part of the flour, both were delicious! Great texture that really is a super thick chewy cookie! Baked them a few weeks ago, and about to try yet again!

So I read about OVERFLOW a bit too late. I usually read reviews before starting a recipe and make adjustments accordingly. After extinguishing a small oven fire, I ended up with a decent cookie anyway. Used the recipe as is. I placed some yellow and green M & Ms on the edge but lost them in overflow. Baked at 350 for 21 minutes. I trimmed the overflow edges with a butter knife as soon as it came out of the oven. Let it cool and then transferred it to a platter with a flat spatula. Decorated with Wilton green sparkle gel and white icing.

Excellent! Just use 2 cups flour and spread an inch from the edge so it doesn't spill. Turned out great!

I made this last night exactly as directions said minus the nuts. We made it with a Hello Kitty cookie cake pan and it came out very good. I felt it was a little dry on the edges but the inside was really good.  I think I will try cooking at a lower temperature next time (325) and cook for same time to see if it comes out a little softer.  My kids loved it! Will make again.

Delicious!! I was looking for something small so I cut the recipe in half and used an 8 inch round pan. I also lined the pan with waxed paper so it was much easier to transfer out of the pan. Thank you very much for the great recipe!

The dough was too much for the pan size listed….the cookie started rising and falling out all over the oven after 10 minutes and the cookie dough wasn't even close to being cooked.

I made this cookie as a birthday present for my friend. I wanted to put something in it besides chocolate chips so when I asked her what her faviote candies were, York Patty mints were on her list. So I found the York mint pieces (they look like M&M candies but york mint) and I put them in the recipe. I also decided I wanted it to be a chocolate cookie so I replaced 1/3 cup of flour with cocoa powder. I used two cake pans and lined them with parchment paper, added only two cups of flour and a little extra vanilla.  The cookies came out Great! I put one of the cookies on a silver plater, wrapped it in plastic wrap and tied a purple ribbon around it and gave it to her. She LOVED it! As for the other one I cut it into bars, and gave them to my family.

Also: when the cookie is a day old, and you want it warm, put part of the cookie in the microwave for 20-30 seconds, it came out warm and soooo good

Used the recipe as written except cooked it at a lower temp, and made the edges a bit thicker in my 16" pizza pan, and it came out PERFECT!  Baked at 325* - forgot exactly how long I cooked it.

Great recipe - cookie was crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside and looked just like the Mrs. Field's cookie "cakes".  Baked this on a pizza stone using the recommendation to roll out sticky dough between 2 sheets of parchment paper.  Need to just remove top parchment paper.  There is spillage so must put a large baking sheet on the shelf below the pizza stone.

I made this for the kids(while they were at school) but it smelled so good I had to eat some before it even cooled!! Tasted AMAZING! I also only used 2 cups flour (instead of 2 1/4) and 1 extra teaspoon vanilla. I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi sweet...I'm sure they're both just as tasty :)

Looked over some reviews but in the end its fool proof. My 2 year old helped me measure. I did 2 cups of flour but 2 1/4 would have been fine. I put it on a silicone baking mat but this thing has so much buttery goodness you don't need to worry about sticking. I recommend parchment on the bottom since I used a perforated pizza pan (16").  Use a piece on top to roll and even out. Peel off before baking. I had enough to make a giant cookie and a side sample cookie since I couldn't wait Til the party haha. Left space to spread. M&Ms do sink if added before baking. Enjoy!! Thanks for the recipe!!

Like other folks, I halfed the recipe and made it in an 9" cake pan.   I used half chocolate chips and half M&M's and left out the nuts in mine.   I baked it just 20 minutes and felt the edges got a little hard.   Next time I will underbake it a tad.   Too bad the kids weren't around this weekend or they would have loved it!   Fun for birthdays, easy to frost and decorate.

Very nice recipe. I wanted to make this for my 7 years old's Birthday. I followed the recipe and only used light brown sugar. I didn't have any nuts in the pantry so I omitted them. Also I didn't have a 14" pan so I divided the batter into two 9" round pans and baked them. One mistake i made was not reducing the baking time. i baked the pies for 20 mins, Next time I will bake them for 15 mins instead of 20. But it was still very delicious !

Came out perfect!  I left an inch around the edges, used 2 cups of flour and cooked at 350 degrees for 20 minutes.  I have a dark non stick pizza pan and I think you have to lower the temperature a little bit when you use a dark non stick pan.  I will definitely make again.  Thank you!

This turned out well. I was aiming to make a giant sandwich cookie as a birthday cake. I baked it in two 9-inch pie pans and used a copycat Oreo frosting recipe I found elsewhere on the web. Super sweet and rich, but that just meant smaller pieces were eaten and it lasted longer!

Perfect! I love brown sugar so I just used brown sugar. And then my daughter and I shaped it into a heart shape. Baked for 20 minutes and it was great.

Just like a pizookie, served warm with vanilla ice cream. YUM. So easy to make and so delicious. I halved the recipe and baked it in a greased 9" cake pan and it came out great, crispy on the edges and chewy in the middle. I baked mine for 20 min.

This was delicious! I brought it to a party and everyoe said it was the best cookie they had ever had! The only change I made was to omit the nuts and make it a monster cookie by adding peaut butter chips, m&ms, and peanut butter m&ms.

To make 2 pans with the 10.5" diameter circle, change recipe to use 3 eggs. Make sure the cookie is not taller than 1/4" full.

Got good reviews from friends! The taste was really good and it cooked all the way through which I was worried that it wouldn't. Only a few complaints. I molded a cookie to a hugh pizza pan, leaving a few inches on the side because others had said that it spilled over. When I took the cookie out of the oven after 20 mins, it had gone to the edges and threatened to spill over. It wasn't a big problem, just something to keep in mind. Also, the "crust" or the outside of the cookie wasn't really as chewy and good as the middle. I guess this is to be expected but still. 

Despite my complaints it was still very good!

Well, for starters, I'm 13 and I was doing this for a school project. This was my first time making it and it came out PERFECTLY! I told my mom that from now on, I'll be making this a lot. I loved it that much! I was actually kind of surprised when I found a pizza pan that was big enough to hold it. But I loved this recipe! Best one yet!

Very Nice cookie. Tastes good, bakes well... A nice way to make someone smile :)
I baked it a few times in the 14' pizza pan and as people suggested, I left about 1 inch space for spreading, but it didn't spread much, there was still space to the boarder... however I did not use all the dough. I had to take some out (made few small cookies) So I think this recipe would be perfect for 16' pan.

Fantastic!  We just made it for my husband for Father's Day.  We mixed regular chocolate chips with white chocolate chips.  Yum!  Thanks for the great recipe.  I used my round deep dish Pampered Chef dish.  25 minutes...Perfect!

Very good. I omitted the walnuts, and split in half and made in two 9" cake pans, with wax paper in the bottoms to make turning out easy. We froze one (unbaked) for later. thawed it most of the way, and then baked it for 25 mins. Perfect! Everybody loves these with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

This was one of the first recipes I made from this site, probably 5 or 6 years ago before I became a member to this site. The cookie pizza was pretty good, but to me nothing really out of the ordinary-still fun though. Just make sure not to overdo the frosting-I tried to make mine look like a real pizza and everyone agreed there were a bit too many toppings :)

Add me to the list of reviewers who had a burnt mess at the bottom of my oven.  I thought I'd be OK using a Pampered Chef pizza pan - the recipe says 14 inch and my PC pan is 15.  I'm sure the cookie itself tastes great and it's a cute idea, so I'm not writing this recipe off.  However, next time, I will definitely take some batter out.  Make sure you listen to the other reviewers on this one!  Or you will be like me, sitting here with no birthday cake cookie for your husband, and a burnt oven to clean out.  :(

Delicious!  Want to play around with some to make it a little more dense, less crumbly, and maybe a little more moist, but will definitely make again.

I think this recipe was pretty good...but for some reason mine turned out really dense and difficult to cut.  I followed the recipe exactly, but when I ate a piece it's density almost made me feel ill.  Maybe I did something wrong...overall good recipe though!

I used a 16" rimmed pizza dish for this one, and used all the batter, which seemed too liquidy for regular dough. It came out thick and moist, with no running over. SOOO many chocolate chips! It overpowered every bite... in a good way. Next time I might put more sugar in it, since I didn't ice it.

This was very yummy.  I made this for Valentine's Day because cookie cake is my boyfriend's favorite kind of "cake."  He absolutely loved this.  I used a frosting recipe from here, and it just added to the goodness.  I am keeping and using this recipe again in the future.

I thought there were too many chocolate chips.  I used two round cake pans with about 1/2 cup left over batter, they turned out fantastic.  I will use this recipe several times for sure.  I have a new birthday favorite.

I had major overspill problems using a 16 inch pizza pan. What was left turned out pretty tasty, but my oven can't be used again until it gets a serious cleaning. I used M&Ms as I was out of chocolate chips and omitted the nuts. If I ever make this again, I will definitley split the recipe and use two pans.

this cookie saved me!!!! i volunteered to make 3 giant cookies for a wedding (in a moment of insanity) and chose this recipe.  so glad i did.  i baked it on a 16 inch pizza pan and still did not use all the recipe.  left out about 1 cup.  and left about 1 1/2 almost 2 inches from the edge to give it room to spread.  mine took only 18 minutes to cook.  what a big, beautiful cookie!! i am very happy with the way this recipe turned out.  thank you so much =)

This was one great chocolate chip cookie! Made it for the birthday of a very special child in our life who doesn't like cake, but loves the big, huge birthday cookies at the mall cookie store. This cookie was perfect. Crisp on the outside, chewy inside. I made the dough walnut-free, but once I put it into the pan, I pressed chopped walnuts into one half of it for the adults. It worked out great.

Following this recipe, i got a great tasting, thick and chewy cookie that was well baked.  I cut this into bars and got great reviews by my family...much easier than drop cookies too! I definitely recommend you try...while not AMAZING they are pretty darn good!

I followed other users' suggestions and divided the batter into two portions, each of which I baked on a 12" pizza pan. No overflow problems, and the cookies *looked* delicious, but they turned out to be far too sweet for my family's liking (and mine is a serious chocoholic family). I omitted the walnuts, though, and possibly the nutty bitterness is necessary to balance out the sticky sweetness?

I've made it three times in two weeks. Love it! Used butter flavor pam, left one inch border to allow cookie to spread (avoid spillage). I had a 13 in pizza pan so used excess mix to make six cupcakes. I doubt I'll ever return to drop cookies again!

I searched for a recipe like at the store at the mall , and my search is over! It was VERY good. I am going to buy a larger pizza pan, like a 16". I was bold and put it on a 14' stone and I had drifts over the edge all the way around. But the taste was unharmed. Nuummmmy!!!! ( I did sub about 1/2 of the all- purpose flour with bread flour, as I was out, and cut my salt and soda in 1/2) This could have made it overflow.

I made the cookie dough and (following others instructions, removed about 1 1/2cps.) baked it on my large round Pampered Chef pizza stone.  The darn thing still seeped all over my oven, but (after an extesive clean-up) the end result was worth it.  I made home-made icing and piped decorations...just like the mall but a lot less expensive.  I will make again, using MUCH less batter and lining the bottom of my oven!   Still a great recipe and idea!!

Excellent cookie! As delicious as the ones you buy at the mall.  Easy to make.  This description is right, makes a HUGE cookie.  I would do as other reviewers have suggested and remove 1 and 1/2 cups of the batter before spreading on your pan, or the cookie will spill over all in your oven.  I used a 14 inch round pizza pan and all of the batter and it BARELY fit.  The dough will spread so make sure you leave about an inch of room between the spread batter and the rim of your pan.  Decorated the cookie cake with store bought icing and it was a hit!  Will make this again and again, but will cut the recipe in half.  mmmmmmmm!

It's the Toll House recipe, so it's (one of) the best chocolate chip cookie recipe. Makes a outrageously huge cookie, very impressive for company or, even better, for kids parties. Omitted nuts and, as usual, to die for when fresh out of the oven.

I made this for my son's 2nd birthday because he doesn't like cake. I used an Airbake 15 3/4 pizza pan (bought at Target). This size was just right for the whole amount of dough. I covered up the holes with aluminum foil, sprayed with Pam, and left a good inch between the edge of the cookie and the edge of the pan. Because my son doesn't like icing, I decorated by sprinkling MnM's baking minichips on top (in addition to the full amount of chocolate chips in the dough!). I baked it for about 19-20 minutes. It looked great and turned out perfect.
