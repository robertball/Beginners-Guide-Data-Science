Since I was the first to try this recipes, I felt compelled to jot a few things down! I really dislike the taste of celery, but decided to try it, and it was suprisingly phenomenal for a celery recipe. However, I did substitute a couple things that really improved and masked the celery taste. I used shitake mushrooms instead of regular ones and added red peppers instead of green peppers. I also omitted the butter to make it lower in calories and fat! The flour, milk and cheese make this side dish creamy. And the thick bread cumb layer really adds something. Give it a whirl, you won't be disappointed!

Who would want to be caught dead making celery for dinner. What's for dinner? Celery casserole.....LOL! My family would run out the door. Well, but I have leftover celery all the time and never know what to do with it. I thought I'd try this recipe and found it to be really tasty. When my husband heard what it was made of it shocked him but he still thought it tastes great. Who would've thought....? I really have to say, I'll be making this again and again. What a pleasant surprise!

This was delicious. So easy. I tried it because I had a lot of celery on hand. Wasn't sure if I would really like it or not.  But it's great! I used fresh mushrooms and sauteed all the veggies with the celery.  I also cut the recipe in half since there were only two of us for dinner. Thank you for a recipe with a "real" sauce and not a sauce made from canned soup. Much better, fresher flavor.  I think I might try using this recipe as a sauce for a green bean casserole.

This was very good. I made a vegan version of this recipe. I cooked the celery until it was soft and I substituted oil for the butter, 1c soy milk for the milk, 3/4c nutrtional yeast for the cheese, and some finely chopped rice idilis for the bread.  Next time I will use 1/2 c nutritional yeast and 1/2c water instead of the cheese (as mine was a little too thick). This recipe turned out creamy and satisfying. It was very good.

As my girlfriend was leaving on holidays and unloaded her fridge on me, I received along with other things celery which I had just purchased myself on shopping day.  So the hunt was on....this recipe fit the bill to a T.  Used fresh crimini mushrooms instead of canned, fresh red bell peppers, some green onions and minced a couple of garlic cloves to boot.  Did 50/50 butter and canola oil for cooking the veggies and made the roux with almond milk.  It turned out amazeing.  Very flavorful and fresh tasteing.  Thanks for a keeper.

This was quite tasty, and you wouldn't know that I used half the butter, nonfat milk, and reduced fat cheddar! I liked how the celery was tender but still crisp.
I substituted onions for the pimentos and mushrooms, and added them at the beginning with the celery. 
I had to half the recipe because I ran out of celery. 1 cup of chopped celery is about 2 1/2 or 3 stalks.

I used gluten-free flour and breadcrumbs, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It's certainly easy and it turned out delicious! I'm sure I will be making this again in the future.

We really like celery in this house but I prefer it cooked so this recipe hits the spot.    The only changes I made were to accommodate our tastes and that is use fresh mushroom and red peppers.   Thanks for a good side dish which will get used often.

Too salty!!! I was very skeptical about a celery casserole, but was pleasantly surprised by the flavor; however, it was WAY too salty for my taste. I think I could have omitted the salt completely and it would have been much better.

This was a great side.  The only thing i did different was I did not put in pimento, because I did not have them on hand.  And, instead of bread crumbs I topped with french fried onions, because I had a can already opened.  My husband said he'd rather have this side dish instead of the tradional green bean bake.  Thank you for the great recipe

This was very good! I only put a small amount of the butter in but next time will completely omit it. I think chicken would be a great addition to this as well.

I'm not a picky eater, but this recipe just didn't work us.  We through out half the batch, and honestly, I felt a little ill after dinner.  I see from the reviews that other people love this recipe, so I guess it's a matter of taste.

I had a ton of celery to get rid of, so I wanted to make this but I don't care for bell peppers or pimentos.  I subbed some onion and used an 8 oz package of fresh baby portabellas.  This recipe is very yummy!  Flavorful and reminded me a little bit of stuffing because of the bread crumbs.  A keeper!

This is so good!  I have made it a number of times.  Only once did I have a problem and that is when I tried to double it.  I made it until where it should have been put in the oven and let it sit overnight in the fridge.  That time it got way to runny.  I don't know if I should have not increased the liquid or if letting it sit produced all the excess liquid.  That is the only time I had a problem.  This is one of our new favorites now!

Delicious, but don't think I'll make again.  It was just tooooo "celeryish".  Also, I think the celery and green pepper could have cooked together, and could have cooked at least twice as long, because it was just a little too crunchy for our tastes.

An interesting use of celery as the main ingredient for this side-dish casserole!  Instead of the green pepper, we used some frozen banana pepper that we had frozen from the garden, but aside from that tweek, followed the recipe as written.  
Nice accompaniment to some chicken breast for our dinner.

This is a 10!  Winner, winner--never had this kind of dinner.  The recipe actually had the right ratios of ingrediants.  Creamy, crunchy, cheesy, comfort!  My husband thinks it is an 8.  He says it needed some meat.  Does a delicate but hardy dish like this need anything else?  SOOO good.  I loved it!

I thought this was surprisingly good. I halved the recipe using multi-colored peppers in place of the pimentos which I didn't have.  I didn't have pimentos so I subbed some multi-colored peppers for them. I also sauteed some fresh mushrooms and the peppers  separately, before adding them to the sauteed celery. I like to use buttered round crackers in place of bread crumbs. I know celery can be kind of bland, so I gave the mixture a light sprinkle of cayenne pepper before adding the cracker crumbs, and that was a good call; it gave it a subtle zing. I can see adding seafood to this, such as shrimp. Nice recipe!

Delicious and easy.  Made it a meal-in-one by adding chicken breasts (3 large, chopped, cooked) to the celery before baking it in a 9x13.  I added fresh mushrooms at the beginning instead of canned, and skipped the pimentos, as I didn't have any of them.  My family of 6 loved it, but I could have added 50% to the recipe and still not had enough.  Yep, the 3 of the 4 kids are teens...

I really dislike celery, but at the end of the month, sometimes it is the only veggie that we have left, so I put it to use.  I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe and actually ate more of it than the kids (who like celery) did.
