This was so very very yummy! I had never made my own pasta before tonight. Something I always wanted to try. My mother in law gave me a pasta sheeter a while back and I finally found time to use it! It was so fun to make. I did find that the dough needed some moisture so I added just enough 1/2and1/2 for richness to bring the dough together. Let it rest for a few minutes and it was smooth sailing from there on in! It cooked up quickly and beautifully. I love the flax meal in it too! It gave it extra texture as well as the added nutrition benefits. It looked beautiful in the dough too! The bolognese sauce was delicious. I had an over abundance of open red wine so I subbed that for the water. I added a bit of ground sweet Italian sausage as well. Just personal preference. The recipe as is would be just as yummy. I just can't seem to leave well enough alone. I always have to put my own spin on things. I will be coming back to this dish again and again. So simple yet great for guests as well. Thank you so much for sharing!

ok I'll try this tonight but without the flax seed meal. I haven't access to that so I wonder if that's needed for the noodles. I suppose I'll find out. This recipe does look easy.

This is a pretty good pasta sauce but it doesn't have even a nodding acquaintance with Bolognese sauce. It's biting into what you thought was an apple and it turns out to be a pear; good but an entirely different taste. This sauce has waaay too much tomato flavor for a Bolognese sauce; the Ragu Bolognese and Northern Italian Meat Sauce recipes on this site look a lot more like the real thing.

I have never made Bolognese Sauce before. I made it last night and we really loved it. I usually do not make changes to a new recipe but I did add 1 tsp. of Basil and 1 tsp. of fennel seed. My husband tried the noodle recipe but ran into some trouble with dryness. He will try again and watch the amount of flour going into the noodles. All and all we loved this recipe. Thanks for sharing it with us.

I prepared this for dinner tonight and thought it was excellent. I used 2 28-oz. cans of San Marzano so reduced the water to one cup. Didn't make homemade noodles but used Penne pasta. It is a keeper for us.

I have to agree this is bland. Two cups of water? I was kicking myself for adding it at the end. I've tried spicing it up with tomato paste a little red wine and red pepper flakes. It will never be as good as a jar of Rao's so that's frustrating.

I only made the sauce part of this recipe and it was delicious. I substituted Italian sausage or Chirico foe the hamburger and the flavor was awesome. I like to make this on a Sunday and have it later in the week.

I watched the video before making. I was confused because the recipe in the video was different. The video called for 2 carrots and 1/2 cup of water instead of 1 carrot and 2 cups of water. I added 1 carrot and 1/2 cup of water and all the other ingredients as stated. I simmered the sauce for 3 hours with lid on. The sauce had the proper consistancy so did not add more water. I precooked 16 oz of penne as shown. My wife slowly added the required cup of parmesan cheese to 4 cups of sauce; stirring constantly while slowly adding. The cheese formed a solid mass in the sauce and finally had to be extracted and given to the dog. The 4 cups of sauce was not nearly enough to cover the 16 oz of Penne so the remainder of the sauce was added. It also failed to adequately cover the Penne. The tomatoes failed to blend with the meat to produce a rich tomato base. It tasted OK but was nothing special and I will not make this again.

Maybe I don't know what a Bolognese sauce is supposed to taste like but I thought this tasted kind of watery even after substituting tomato sauce for most of the water. It is also a little heavy on the oregano.

I thought it was very flavorful - I made the sauce according to the recipe on a Sunday evening and then served it with rigatoni the following night. I was disappointed that the sauce was very watery. Since there were leftovers I continued to cook without the lid to see if it would thicken up a bit. Next time I probably wouldn't use all the crushed tomatoes.

I'm normally a baker and not a cook. I was proud of myself. I only made the bolognese sauce not the pasta but I'll be making it again! And again... and probably again. I only used 28 oz of the crushed tomatoes and subbed a 14 oz can of diced seasoned tomatoes. I probably could have let it reduce for another twenty minutes but the parm at the end held it together pretty well.

I was worried that this recipe was too plain to be good. Not so! Very tasty and affordable weeknight dinner. I used spaghetti squash instead of pasta. Will definetly make again. Froze half of the sauce and the other half lasted 3 nights for my husband and myself.

I thought this was a pretty good recipe! I did add some ingredients to it because I found it a little under-seasoned and bland.. some basil (dried and/or fresh) a couple tablespoons garlic oil and little more salt and pepper made it a real great recipe! I left out the flax (a little too much for me ) and did without the water. Additionally I simmered to sauce for 2 hours. Overall pretty good!

I love Bolognese but the real stuff is sort of a lot of work. Thought I'd try a quickie but it was only OK. First of all unless you love oregano don't even think of using a whole tablespoon. I used 2 teaspoons and it still overpowered the sauce. Because of that I can't really tell you how it would taste. Could have used a little more salt as well - basically flat. Easy though. So cut the oregano and add a little more salt! Maybe it might work.

Delicious! Never buying bottled spaghetti sauce again!! My family preferred not adding the butter and parmesan cheese at the end.

I did not make the noodles. I bought hand made noodles from the store. I followed the sauce recipe but added a little more garlic powder (about 1/2 tablespoon more) and it came out perfect.

This is an absOlutely DELICIOUS ragu sauce that I make for my family on a regular basis.... I make a big batch and then freeze it in smaller portions so it's always on hand for a quick dinner. My son the fussy eater even LOVES this and asks for it as "melted meat"....(luckily he doesn't know there are carrots in it)! I've made a few changes that I find help make a smoother sauce....I first combine the diced onions & grated carrots together and leave them overnight in a plastic container (or for a few hours until onions are translucent). This helps the 2 flavors meld together and break down before it's even cooked... I then sauté them in the EVOO & garlic BEFORE adding the meat I find it makes the onions a softer consistency. I let it cook for about 15 minutes then add the meat I also use a potato masher to combine all the flavors & ingredients together while cooking in the pot (makes a much smoother sauce)....and I use dried basil instead of oregano. Lastly I don't add butter directly to the sauce instead I melt the butter over the cooked pasta for a velvet coating then put sauce on top!!!

Yes I made the Bolognese sauce and thought it was wonderful. I added 3 T. sugar to the sauce. I will make this again. Thank you for the recipe.
