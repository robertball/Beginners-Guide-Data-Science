I hate to make major modifications to a new recipe, so I followed this recipe to the letter, put into a 425 degrees F oven, checked at 20 minutes, and the mozzarella cheese was totally burned.  I pulled it off, sprinkled on more  mozzarella, and cooked for about another 8 minutes, until it was just starting to brown.  In the future, I would cover this casserole with foil for half the time (at least), remove the foil, and then back into the oven, allowing the cheese to melt.  Better yet, I think cooking this at 375 would be even better but, again, covering it with foil for part of the time, so the cheese doesn't burn.  I added the Italian seasoning to the sauce rather than sprinkling on top of the cheese.  A lot of water cooked out of the zucchini, and the bottom of dish was pretty deep with water.  I just poured it off, and then cut into serving sizes.   The Greek yogurt mixed in with the marinara made a really flavorful sauce.  A few tweaks, but it did end up tasting really good.

This was absolutely delicious! I used the Veggetti to make zucchini "pasta" and followed the recipe as written. I did add sausage to the sauce as we have teenage boys who want meat in everything! Make sure you check it after about 15mins because it does brown rather quickly. I threw a piece of foil over the top at 15mins and kept it in for another 15. This is a winner and will be a staple for years to come. Thank you!

Loved it!  Great way to use up lots of zucchini - getting more veggies and reducing wheat/carbs in an eating plan.  I sliced the zucchini with my mandolin and sautéed it on my cast-iron stovetop griddle.  The next time I will either slice the zucchini thicker or do a double layer between the sauce and cheese, so that it has more structure.  I also added some ham, because I thought the carnivores in my family would be more open-minded to the zucchini noodles that way.  Everyone really liked it!

Great recipe, just drained a lot of moisture from the zucchini before putting it in the baking dish. Will be a favorite with our family! Thank you!

Delish!  I sautéed mushrooms and ground chicken for some protein and then added the sauce.  Great for meal prepping

Zoodles are a good substitute for pasta. We liked this casserole. Take your time with the squash. It holds a lot of moisture, and sweating it it the pan helps removes it. The sauce was easy to make. I had vanilla yogurt so i used it. There was no vanilla taste, but it added sweetness. Next time I make it I'll use plain yogurt or sour cream.

Great sauce flavor, but seems to missing something. Plenty of options to tweak this one though.
