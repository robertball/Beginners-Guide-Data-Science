I thought I'd save some time by simply adding the rice to the soup & letting it cook in the broth...it absorbed all the liquid, and the recipe isn't soup anymore! It turned out more like a stew, and has an absolutely wonderful taste! I may not ever make regular stuffed peppers again!

Wonderful stuff! If I could give this 10 stars, i would.
I made a few changes and it came out tasting exactly like stuffed peppers. I did not use sage,my opinion is sage does not belong in this dish. I did use 1 tsp oregano,1 tsp basil, 1 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp accent. I also cooked the rice in the mixture and used 1/2 beef broth too. It did come out very thick but that is how we like it. Next time i will add a small can of tomato paste because i like more of a tomato flavor. I did not add taco seasoning like others did. Next time i will try this with cabbage. Thanks for the great recipe.

Such an AWESOME recipe!!  I add a little twist to mine though.  Even though I cook my rice first before adding it to the mix, I do find there is quite a bit of absorption of the juice, taking away from the soup.  So what I do is add, depending on the quantity I am making, a few cans of beef broth.  I think using the beef, with the chicken broth, adds a little compliment to the entire mix making a great meld of flavors! Using the extra broth keeps this soup, just what it is, soup and not a rice mush.

My husband first tasted stuffed pepper soup in a resturant and we both loved it. I checked allrecipes.com and found this one and feel like I hit a jackpot. It is not only very easy to prepare but it tastes just like we had.  Thank you for sharing your recipes.       I have also given this recipe to 7 co-workers. All of them are coming back with rave reviews.Gail B

I just made this soup but I changed some of the ingred. and made it a 5 star according to my husband.  Used 1 lb. free-range ground chicken plus 1/2 lb. ground round.  Also added celery and garlic with the onions and peppers.  I used 3 orange and yellow peppers instead of green.  I also used 1/2 carton organic beef broth and 3/4 carton organic chicken broth and 2 cans of diced tomatoes coarsely pureed.  I added organic brown uncooked rice after the above came to a boil and simmered it for 45 minutes or so. Then I added several spices.  My family raved about it and said I could make it anytime! I probably just about doubled the recipe as stated.

I have to tell you a secret--I don't like bell peppers-at all.  Period.  I decided to try this recipe because my other half loves stuffed peppers.  I added more minced garlic when I was sweating the onions and it was tasty!  This recipe does not have the overpowering taste of bell peppers and I love that.  After I added the rice I had to add more liquid because the rice soaked it up, but that's ok!  The day after it's good too.  It's more of a goulash consistency, but oh so yummy.  My family LOVES this recipe!  Thank you!

LOVED IT. I agree that I wanted a tad more flavor than the seasonings indicated - so I added a splash of red wine, some garlic and basil as well as a little worcestershire sauce when I was browning the meat. None of my personal seasoning decisions make this less than as written - I just wanted it to have a bit more kick. Thanks for the recipe!

Great flavor and filling dinner.  This is a great recipe a quick throw-together dinner.  I usually have all the ingredients on hand.  I did add one more bell pepper and omitted the sage (just don't like the taste of it in anything).  Also used one can of Rotel and one 14 oz can of diced tomatoes instead of one 28 oz can of tomatoes.  It's even better the next day.

This was honestly the best I've had in a long time.  Hubby is a food snob, and still loved it!  In fact... has asked for it twice since we had it the first time about a month ago!!  Thanks!!

Easy, especially if you have a blender or food processor to help you chop.  You can do all the prep work the day before and throw it in the slow cooker.  Freezes great - double it and stock up!  A hit at potlucks - be ready for lots of compliments & recipes inquiries.  It's one of these recipes that tastes even better the next day(s), and the flavor becomes more hearty and rich after freezing. Changes: doubled onion, green pepper, and rice amounts & used brown instead of white rice (my family of picky eaters never even noticed).  I also used beef broth instead of chicken and substituted Italian seasoning for the thyme and sage.  Also, added garlic - a LOT!  But - as with any recipe - season to YOUR liking ;-)  It's a regular in my meal planning rotation.  DELICIOUS!

This soup is soooo good.  My husband and I also had this soup in a resturant and enjoyed it so much that I had to try to make it at home.  I made this soup using turkey meat instead of ground meat and it was just as good and a less less fat.  I also substituted beef broth instead of the water to give it more flavor....DELICIOUS!!!!

Hearty and comforting!  My only change was to add some fresh minced garlic when adding the peppers and onion.  After adding the rice and letting it sit for awhile the rice does absorb quite a bit of the liquid making it thicker...more stew like.  But, that's how we like it.  If you want it more soupy, I'd definitely add an additional can of broth.  Sprinkled a little cheese on top and this was perfect!

Excellent! It really does taste like stuffed peppers. I did end up using beef broth instead of chicken, added garlic, used oregano and basil instead of sage and thyme(didnt have any) Also added 2 jalapeno's which added a little spice. It reminded me alot of Stouffer's stuffed peppers which I love. I do think next time I wont add the rice to the whole pot but add some to the bowls as we go.

Mmmm!  I made this soup exactly as directed with these additions:  minced garlic, bay leaves, a dash of Worcestershire, and instead of the chicken broth - a beef bouillon cube and a bottle of dark beer.  Fantastic!  Thanks, Kate, for a great recipe!

My wife lost her recipe for stuffed pepper soup, so I dug this up on allrecipes. She came home with a worried look on her face, but 2 spoonfuls later the lost recipe didn't matter. I used 1 pound of turkey and 1 pound of beef along with a can of tomato soup instead of sauce and it tasted great! Next time I will use more peppers and some red pepper flakes.

I made this in a crock pot on low for almost 6 hours after I browned the beef and my house smelled wonderful and everyone LOVED it! It was a great meal to come home to after work. I served this with fresh bread and a side salad. I doubled everything and added the rice in at the beginning and it was a thick stew instead of a soup but that's what we all liked. I'm DEFIANTLY making this again!  THANKS!

Loved this at a church function and found this version so I tried it with a few changes.  Used 2 cups beef broth instead of chicken broth, exchanged the sage for 1/2 tsp. Italian Seasoning and added a clove of minced garlic when adding the onion and green pepper.  I also used short grained brown rice instead of white.  Better the next day after the flavors combine but you might need to add more broth to soup it up as the rice absorbs some of the liquid.  This is quite "tomatoey" so just cut back on the tomato sauce and add more broth to suit your taste buds!

Ok, I know you shouldn't really rate recipes when you change them, but these were rather minor tweaks because I was using what I had on hand and I had read a few other reviews.  I really like this recipe a lot!  It's even better the next day!  What I changed was I used a large can of crushed tomatoes in place of the diced (all I had) and I think I like that a lot better.  Since it was so tomatoey with that, I only used half the tomato sauce.  Along with the spices indicated, I added a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce (because it makes everything better!!) and I added about a TBS or less of brown sugar.  I really think the brown sugar really rounded out the flavor perfectly.  Next time I make this (and there will be a next time!) I think I'll add another pepper, and maybe try quinoa in place of the rice.  Can't hurt right?

My husband and I LOVE this "soup".  I made it exactly as written (with the exception of brown rice instead of white), and thought it was fantastic.  It's best to start with the knowledge that this is thick like a stew, but since we actually prefer that to liquidy soup it was perfect! It reheats very well too, so it's great to take to work! :)  Next time I think I'll make it with ground turkey!

What a great recipe. I did make a few changes though - I used ground beef instead of sirloin, red and green peppers, 2 10 oz cans of beef broth instead of the chicken, and 1/2 tsp oregano and 1/2 tsp basil instead of the sage. It was so good. Will definitely make this again.

Delicious! I did change to beef broth and used a different spice blend...only because I hate sage and thyme! I used oregano, basil, garlic and red pepper flake for a kick. The base is a fantastic recipe to change according to your personal preferences! From other reviews, I have personally kept the rice in a separate container to be added per serving as I will eat this over a few days.
You won't be sorry if you try this one.

8-29-2016  ~Hearty soups with a rich, tomato based broth are right up Hubs’ alley.  And because we’re both quite fond of stuffed peppers as well, I figured I’d have a winner with this one, and I did.  I followed the recipe loosely, employing my own minor preferences – my own tomato sauce, fresh herbs rather than dried, more broth (half chicken, half beef) and less canned tomatoes, less rice, and less onion.  It was really only all about proportion preferences where I deviated.  I also added garlic, a little Worcestershire and, along with red, green and yellow peppers from my garden, a last, stubborn zucchini.  If this wasn’t “liquid,” and you didn’t serve this in a bowl and eat it with a spoon, this truly IS reminiscent of stuffed peppers!  Served with BLTs on homemade Italian bread with red-ripe tomatoes from my garden, this was a satisfying, homespun, comfort-food supper.

This was healthy, easy and very tasty.  I used 1/2 green pepper and 1/2 red... I also used italian turkey sausage and changed up the spices... a dash of thyme, 1/2 tsp of oregano, 1/2 tsp of basil and about 1/4 tsp of crushed red pepper.  Sprinkled w/ a little mozzarella cheese to serve.  Awesome... thanks, Kate!

I made this soup tonight and all I can say is WOW!! It was OUTSTANDING! I followed the recipe exactly as written EXCEPT I did add 1 can of beef broth (per others reviews I read) to make it a little more "soupy" as the rice does absorb alot of the liquid. My whole family LOVED it...including my VERY PICKY kids! =) Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, Kate....it's a keeper!

We have had this out & it sent us on the search for the recipe.  This one is the best we've had! Even my picky 12 yr old son loved it!

We thought this soup was wonderful. I left out the sage though as I am not a fan.  I used one can of beef and one can of chicken stock and I had cooked the rice in the morning so I didn't have to worry about it. It seemed to take a little more thyme to me and a fair amount of salt probably due to the rice. I will definitely be making this again.

I made this tonight and made a few changes also.  I used beef broth instead of chicken and ground turkey instead of beef.  I added a can of tomato soup also.  That's what we put on stuffed peppers.  We also like to have this with mashed potatoes.  Yummy!!!

Great basic recipe.  I listened to the reviewers and made quite a few changes/ additions (it's a bad habit of mine).  Left out the sage and thyme, but added italian seasoning, basil, oregano and red pepper flakes.  I seasoned the beef while browning, added minced garlic to the onions when sauteeing and 2 diced jalapenos for a little extra kick.  BF doesn't like chunks of tomatos, so I added a 29 oz can of tomato puree instead of the diced tomatos and substitued 15 oz of beef broth for the can of the tomato sauce, also subbed beef broth for the chicken broth.  Used brown rice instead of white. Was good for dinner, but when I heated up for leftovers the next day, I added 2 hot italian sausage links (cooked & removed from casings) and an extra 1.5 cups of beef broth.  Perfection :).  Next time I'll increase the beef broth by 2 cups & add 1/2 lb. of hot italian sausage.

This is a good starter to the soup, but I think the diced tomatoes are a little bit too much.  The next time I make this I will cut out the tomatoes and double the tomato sauce and chicken stock.

My partner and I at work love this soup.  A few changes that we like was to use sausage instead of sirloin and using cheese and cilantro as toppers.

WOW!  This is the best.  My husband was skeptical but LOVES it.  As others have said the rice does absorb the liquid so I make up half the rice and put it into half of the soup to eat right away and freeze the other half the soup without the rice.  Then make up and add the rice when we have the the rest later.  We also put in about 3 green peppers chopped into large chunks and usually more chicken broth.

We had an extra bell pepper sitting around from omelets last night, so my wife remembered that we both enjoyed stuffed bell pepper soup from a local restaurant we eat at - we found this recipe, and really enjoyed it.  We opted to cook the rice and leave it separate to avoid the mushiness that other reviewers had mentioned.  I just put a small amount of white rice in the bottom of my bowl before smothering it with the soup.  We also added Worcestershire, red pepper flakes, GARLIC (of course!), some emeril's essence (we didn't have sage) and actually added a yellow bell pepper for extra color.  We ended up almost tripling the recipe because I have some relatives I want to bring extra food to, and boy are we glad we did!  Thanks again A-R for another great recipe.

This was delicious!! I did not add the thyme or sage. I added some crushed garlic to the onion and peppers. When I filled each bowl for my family, I sprinkled shredded sharp cheddar on top and this really made it stand out. I will be making this again!!!

Okay the first two times I made this dish I skipped both thyme and sage because I didn't have them and the dish was delicious. I'm making it again and now have some thyme so I added it and in my opinion ruined the soup. Skip the thyme, it's overpowering. Otherwise this is a great recipe.

Because I like a little more kick - I added minced garlic and worcestershire sauce to the meat when browning it.  I added another green pepper because we love them.  I also added a dash of hot sauce and some Italian seasoning.  I added two cups of water and the rice directly to the soup - saved using another pan.  MMMMM good

so good, quick, and easy. does taste like stuffed peppers without the fuss. can be prepared in no time. I omitted the sage(don't care for flavor), and added a touch of cumin instead, added some celery, garlic,chopped cilantro, and red pepper for a bit of zing. had to add more stock than directed once I added the cooked rice.(used basmati out of necessity).  makes a bunch and froze some containers. serving with rosemary cheese bread also from this site. thanks for this quick recipe with great leftovers!

Very tasty.  I doubled the recipe and I used brown rice, but only used 1.5X the rice.   I also used half ground beef/turkey.  This was very good and I will keep it in the rotation.  Thanks for sharing!

This was very good. Mine ended up more like a stew or chili than a soup (perhaps I simmered it too long) but the flavor was very good.  It tasted just like stuffed peppers but was easier to make.  Easy fall/winter dinner!

Very hearty and extremely filling.  I do agree with some other reviews that sage doesn't belong in this recipe.  Next time I will just use garlic powder, black pepper and a little chili powder.  I did pour in a can of tomato soup and a can of water since the rice soaked up a lot of the liquid.  All in all, really good :)

I increased the rice to 1 1/2 cups and I used 2 green peppers. I eliminated the sage and thyme and instead used a can of diced tomotoes with basil, oregano, garlic (I also added an addtional 1 tsp of each). Add a splash of worchestershire sauce.....delicious!

I spiced this recipe up by using one 14oz. can of diced tomatoes and one 14 oz can of diced tomatoes with chilies (hot). I added a clove of garlic with my onions.  I also used one green and one red bell pepper and 2 cups beef bouillon instead of chicken broth. I didn't have any sage, so I left it out and added a little Italian seasoning. It turned out quite spicy, but very good.

Very easy and very yummy.  I changed just a little.  I omitted the onion because my husband hates onion, added a clove garlic.  I didn't have any sage so I left that out too.  I also didn't have salt but I'm sure the broth had plenty.  I added uncooked rice right with it once it got hot and let it cook in a slow cooker for a few hours.  That seemed to fine and made one less pan to wash.

I found this recipe while searching for a stuffed pepper recipe.  After reading the reviews, I thought I'd give this soup a try.  It was awesome!!!  My husband went nuts over it. I made a couple changes to this recipe.  I used 32 oz. chicken broth, 29 oz tomato sauce and 1 t. italian seasoning instead of what the recipe calls for and I added the uncooked rice to the pan without cooking first.  It turned out thicker, almost like a stew, but was awesome.  This recipe is a keeper and will be made often!

This is a really easy, healthy and tasty recipe. I substituted ground turkey for the beef, and brown rice, which I added (with 2c. water) right into the soup.

I love this recipe! I made a slight tweak, using brown rice instead of white, and it came out fantastic! I have made several soups from recipes on this site and they were all amazing! I feel confident trying new recipes from all these fantastic cooks on this site!

I made this in a crockpot and used ground sirloin and ground chicken. I added tomato paste, celery and carrots as well. I didn't add the rice into the crockpot, but made it separately and poured the soup over the rice when it was done. Delicious!

This was pretty good, but the rice absorbed all the broth.  My husband went back for a second bowl and the broth was all gone.  I think next time I will add more broth.  There seemmed to be way more rice than meat, so I will probably reduce rice to 3/4 cup next time.  Unless I was reading the recipe wrong, it sounded like 1 cup of dry rice which makes a lot of cooked rice.  Overall it was pretty good.  I will make again.

This soup is good, I had to add some sugar to even out the acid of the tomatoes, and I will probably leave out the thyme next time I make it. I also used marjoram instead of sage, and used half beef broth as some others suggested. I would have given this 5 stars if not for the thyme....

Very good. Definitely chunky (especially once refrigerated) but I prefer a chunky soup. Make sure you use white rice, brown rice expands in soups!

I love this soup but I gave it 3 1/2 stars because no way does sage go in stuffed peppers.  Great base recipe for the ratios.  I added garlic, more peppers included a poblano for a little heat, and chopped fresh tomatoes.  Instead of the sage, I used a dash of italian seasoning.  If you don't have time to cook your rice separately, use the frozen pre-cooked rice.

Reallly great recipe!  I did make a few changes due to prefernces and dietary restrictions:  I used red pepper instead of green, I used crushed tomates instead of tomato sauce, and I wasnn't in the mood for rice, so I used mini gluten free pasta shells.  I have a very bad cold, and this has been the one thing that helps when I've been eating it.  It's a nice change from my usual chicken soup when I'm sick.

Love it! Even my kids enjoyed it! I did substitute the sirloin for turkey just to lower calories.

This was an excellent, flavorful soup perfect for someone on a gluten-free diet. In fact, my family prefers this over regular stuffed peppers. We serve it with mashed potatoes instead of bread since a family member has celiac.   I did make some alterations based on the ingredients I had on hand, although I'm sure the original recipe would have been just as good.   I used a large can of tomato puree instead of diced, 1 lb. ground turkey in place of sirloin, beef broth in place of chicken, and 4 small bell peppers instead of 1. I also added a clove of minced garlic after browning the meat.   I added the uncooked rice to the soup during the last 30 min. of cooking along with a cup or two of water. Turned out great, and the rice was cooked perfectly.

This is FANTASTIC!! I made one change by using Italian Venison sausage instead of ground sirloin.  It's a family favorite now.

Oh wow, this soup is amazing. I loved every bit of it. All I did was added a little extra meat and used a little bit of cayenne pepper to make it just a little spicy and it tasted great.

This is an excellent, easy recipe!  I can't eat onions, so I substituted with garlic.  I love a thick stew, and so I threw the rice in without cooking it first.  YUM!!  I will definitely make this again!

This soup was super easy and great tasting.  Followed recipe pretty close.  I used my own tomato sauce and used two small cans of diced tomatoes (one regular and one with hot peppers)  I also cut up one hungarian hot pepper and one green pepper.  I also added garlic.
My husband says this is definately a keeper.

Great recipe - easy to make for a crowd. I doubled this recipe and fed 12 (including several big eaters) and still had lots of leftovers.  Only changes were that I omitted the onion, used taco seasoning packet instead of individual spices, and accidentally used 28 oz tomato sauce can instead of the 15oz can - it actually makes it more soupy, so I recommend trying it.  Everyone loved it, thanks for the recipe!

I thought this recipe was good as a base for the soup.  I added 2 tablespoons each of minced garlic, garlic powder, and italian seasonings.  I also added 1 more can of chicken broth so that it would be less saucy and more like soup.  I may add one extra bell pepper next time so that it is a more prominent ingredient, rather than a soup that happens to have peppers in it.  Thanks for the recipe.

I first tried this soup in a restarunt. I then found it at this sight and it tasted the same.  I did a slight adjustment,  I used halve the amount of vegetarian crumbles instead of ground beef.  It was great.

Great recipe. Easy to make. I did add a few modifications as per the reviews. For the sautee, I used 1/2 a whole red onion and 1/2 a whole yellow onions (just for the milder flavour). Also used 3/4 of a green pepper and 3/4 of a red pepper and 2 cloves of garlic. For the soup, I used 1 28 oz can of beef broth instead of chicken. And 1 28 oz of tomato soup instead of tomato sauce. I used 1/2 a can of diced tomatoes, I just added them in gradually because I didn't want to over do the tomato flavour. I also seasoned with 1/2 tsp of oregano, 1/2 tsp of of basil and 1/2 of red pepper flakes and then salt and pepper to taste. Oh I I did add a splash of worchestire sauce when browning the meat. And topped it off with some Parmesan cheese. 'Teas divine. Can't wait to make this again. :)

This is a good meal on a cold day.  Personally, I use sage in thyme in chicken dishes, not beef.  I made the recipe as is, and afterwards wished I had of left those two out of it.  However, I would make this again...with the exception of the sage and thyme.  I would instead add a little more fresh ground pepper and salt.

Needs more peppers and onions, garlic, and seasoning. I made it with beef broth instead of chicken and crushed tomatoes  along with the diced tomatoes so that it'd be more of a tomato broth. I cooked the rice until it was still a bit underdone since I knew it'd cook more in the soup. At the suggestion of others I added the rice into each individual bowl before I served the soup so that it didn't get mushy. But this was a great starting off point!

Delicious recipe!!  I used Marie Bond's spice recommendations because we are not big sage or  thyme fans, and we were very pleased with the end result.  I will definitely make this again, especially in the crisp fall season when it can steam up my windows and the smell wafts through the house.  Thanks for sharing such a delightful recipe!

I have made this soup several times now. The first time, I  followed the recipe exactly to see what this was like. How I have gone through life with out this soup is beyond me!
 Since then I have tried a few suggestions in the reviews which have also come out tasty.  I have found this recipe is very forgiving. I've used all different color peppers. Ive chopped up whatever fresh tomatoes I had to add to my small can of diced tomatoes. I even added leftover tomato juice since i was low on broth. I've got a pot simmering  on the stove as I write this. It smells so good! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Love this soup! the only things I changed were I used beef broth instead of chicken.Also I used spaghetti saauce instead of tomato sauce.That's what I use when I make my stuffed peppers.Spaghetti sauce gives it more flavor.The soup tastes exactly like my stuffed peppers.

I am wondering how everyone can give 5 stars when they change so much of the recipe ? Sometimes when people look for recipes they do not read the comments , they just check the rating by the stars . I don't believe I read 1 review that did NOT change anything in the recipe. I don't understand , the recipe that they are giving 5 stars to is NOT the above recipe. Am I wrong ? I get the changes . But then is it really the above recipe that you are rating?

I used low/no sodium canned products (chicken broth, tomatoes, tomato sauce) which is necessary if you're sensitive to salt like my family is and since I doubled the chicken broth, I doubled the sage and thyme.  From this point, I changed it quite a bit to fit my family's taste. The rating is for the spice/broth ratio, etc and not my changes.  I used super lean ground beef, added more bell peppers than called for (1 16 oz bag of frozen) and replaced the rice with quinoa which I cooked in the pot with the simmering meat/vegetable mixture (hence doubling the chicken broth).  We always add sliced mushrooms to our stuffed peppers, so I did in the soup as well.  Very tasty and will go into our menu rotation.

I loved this recipe! But like many others I did make adjustments. I used sweet Italian sausage instead of ground sirloin, oregano instead of sage, 3/4 cup quinoa instead of rice, and spaghetti sauce instead of just tomato sauce to give it more flavor. I served it with mozzarella cheese on top. It was awesome!

My husband asked me to try making stuffed pepper soup so I selected this recipe.  We both loved it.  It has a lot of flavor and the rice adds nice texture.  Made only a few modifications based on what I had at home.  Used Italian seasoning in place of the sage and thyme, and mixed some beef broth with the chicken broth.  Then I threw in some minced garlic to suit our tastes.  As another reviewer suggested, I did not add the rice to the soup;  I put a spoonful in the bottom of each bowl then ladled soup over it.  A hearty and satisfying soup, and I appreciated the ease of preparation.

Wonderful! Used some great tips from other reviewers (thanks). It's a keeper! Didn't give it a 5 because of Sage and Thyme...

I made this for my family.  They loved it so much that there were no leftovers! I wanted more so I made a quadruple batch 3 days later!  I added diced tomatoes with spicy red pepper for a little kick.  That really made a big difference.  This recipe is a keeper!

I just absoultly love this soup.  The only thing i changed is the thyme.  I don't like that strong flavor so I just used a small pinch instead of the 1/4 tsp.  Also I used ground turkey instead of beef and it was fantastic.  I don't like stuffed peppers because of the pepper itsself, but I do love this soup.

This is a great and easy soup to make. The only thing I did different is a have a hand blender and I blended up tomatoes a little before putting them into soup, but otherwise it was great, highly recommend.

I followed the recipe as is.  The first day it was okay.  I added a lot more salt and spices to make it more exciting.  The next day I was surprised to discover that the soup had morphed into a mushy rice blob overnight. This is a good recipe for the adventurous who like to adapt recipes.  For a busy mom like me?  I will continue my search for a stuffed pepper soup recipe.

This is good!  I prefer it with the following substitutions:  2 beef boullion cubes mixed with 2 cups water instead of the broth.  1/4 tsp Italian seasoning instead of the thyme and sage.  For salt and pepper, I use 1/4 tsp pepper and 1 tsp salt.  I also add 1/2 tsp sugar to cut down the acidity of the tomatoes.  For rice, I just use one boil-a-bag.  One other tip...I made this once with the plain sirloin and then another time with leftover grilled burgers and the one with the burgers was even better!

This is an delicious soup, and a great way to use up ingredients in your kitchen!  I made this with what I had on hand: two green peppers instead of one; 2 cups of leftover homemade tomato sauce; 3 cups of chicken broth I had in the freezer; and ground turkey instead of beef.  Some of the quantities and ingredients were slightly different, but I would feel confident making this exactly as written, knowing it would be great!  The rice does absorb the liquid (as always), but the new stew we had for leftovers was delicious too.  I would probably add some more salt or seasoning to my bowl next time, but my young kids and husband ate it up!

After making this, I'll never make regular stuff green peppers again.  I found the flavors in this combination much more through-out, even.  I did add a little garlic being a lover and some water as it became extra, extra thick. Super yummy and easy.

This was a great recipe. Everyone in the family loved it and I will make it again. I gave it 4 stars because I did make a few changes. I left out the sage because of a personal dislike and the salt because I think there is enough in the tomatoes and broth.  I also added about 1/2 T. worcestershire sauce, 2 beef bouillon cubes and 1/4 tsp each of basil and garlic powder because I use those when making stuffed peppers. I also used groud venison instead of sirloin.

Definitely an easy soup to make.  After reading the reviews for it, I decided to add a little extra tomato so it wouldn't be so thick (although I love thick soups); and I added some extra spices to compensate for the extra liquid.  Turned out great, and husband loved it, too.  Next time I'll double the recipe so I have enough for my lunches for the week!

Very filling and delicious. I did need to add more stock after I added the rice as it soaked up a ton of liquid. I thought it was even better as leftovers letting the flavors meld together.

I only made this in order to use up some ground beef that i had thawed and peppers that were getting old.  I didn't expect it to be so great!  It is really delicious.  I was out of chicken broth, so substituted a can of vegetable broth that i had on hand.  I used a scant half cup of brown rice instead of the white.  I added some basil, oregano, a splash of worcestershire.  Next time I will probably add minced garlic.  Terrific recipe!

This was absolutely delicious. I made a couple additions. I added about a cup a sliced mushrooms a can of corn. I used taco seasoning to taste, garlic powder, and cayanne pepper for a little bite. I also used brown rice rather than white. So good. Served with sour cream and a bit of shredded cheddar cheese. Yum.

This is good.  I'll make it again.  But, it's not anything all that exciting and it kind of made me want chili.

This is VERY good stuff! I used crushed tomatoes instead of diced, and beef broth instead of chicken. I skipped the thyme and sage, and added some garlic powder and a little Italian seasoning instead. I cooked up the beef/tomato mixture and put it into the crockpot. I added the rice and extra beef broth to compensate for the rice soaking up some liquid. I put into bowls and topped with some shredded cheddar. Serve with some fresh bread out of the breadmaker, and you're good to go! Will make again.

This is an awesome recipe!  I made this with 2 green peppers and probably a little less than a pound of meat.  Once I added the rice and let it simmer (making corn bread) I had to add more chicken broth as it got pretty thick.  My boyfriend really liked it and he tends to be pretty critical of food, so that is 5 stars for me!  Thanks!

I made this last night for my husband and myself and it was delicious! I did however make a few changes based on my preference. I added garlic and worstchire sause to the meat while it browned. I used green pepper & onion tomatoes in stead of plain diced tomatoes and I added a can of beef broth along with the chicken broth. Hope ya'll enjoy the changes! =)

OMG out of this world. I made it all up and poured it over cooked rice. If doing this way cup the liquid down to half. Sooooo goooood. I used tomato soup instead of the tomato sauce which I think adds a little more flavor... and I didn't have the tomato sauce anyways. Great! Picture to follow, next week when I make it again.

Very good with a few changes.  I used beef broth, two cans, and cooked the rice in the soup, so I had to add about 4 cups of water as well.  I will halve the amount of rice another time but still increase the liquid considerably.

What a hearty soup for a cold night.  This turned out great and was ready from start to finish in less than an hour.  The only things I did different were add an additional can of chicken broth and I used brown rice vs white, as that is what I had in the pantry.  Perhaps the next time I make this I'll try beef broth and for the meat use 1/2 ground sirloin and the other 1/2 Italian sausage.

A restaurant we visited had stuffed pepper soup on the menu, so I had to find a recipe.....my family enjoyed this. I used V8 juice instead of broth, so that when the rice soaked up the liquid, I could add it and not lose flavor. I did not cook the rice separately. I also used Better than Bullion rather than canned stock. It was a good autumn meal.

I found this recipe by accident last night and couldn't wait to make it. I modified it a bit. I used half chicken stock and half beef stock. I used the leftover stock to cook the rice in. I did not use thyme or sage instead used oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder and red chili flakes to taste. I topped it with shredded mozzarella and sriracha sauce, delicious and spicy. Next time i plan to make it with chicken and sausage. AMAZING recipe...thanks for sharing!!

This is easy, quick, and wonderful! I used beef broth instead of chicken broth (its what I had) and no sage - garlic instead, and it was delicious! This is my new favorite soup. It was done in under 1 hour. What can be better?

This was a good starter recipe.  I used 2 lbs. sausage, 2 bell peppers, and omitted the broth.  I added 2 T brown sugar and 2 T cider vinegar instead of the soy sauce.  Mine was more like half soup, half casserole.  Family loved it - including 4 teenage boys.  No leftovers.

I tried it because I love stuffed peppers but only had 1 green pepper.  I did make a few changes.  Since I was only cooking for 2 I cut the recipe in half, used a whole green pepper, a whole onion, fresh diced tomatoes, and brown rice.  I added the rice into the mix to cook instead of cooking it seperatly.  It turned out great!

I followed others advice and used beef broth, oregano, fennel seed and a little brown sugar.  It was absolutely delicious.  I don't like green bell pepper at all so I substitute with red bell peppers. I also add at least 2 cloves of fresh garlic. The best soup I've ever had and I make lousy soup. Update:  I have made this without the rice but add extra ground sirloin or chuck and it is wonderful.

We were pretty disappointed with this soup and will stick with regular stuffed peppers or a stuffed peppers casserole from now on.  The sage and thyme just didn't seem like the right seasonings, but I followed the recipe anyway, and at the end we were adding garlic and italian seasoning to try to take away from the overpowering sage and thyme taste.  The vegetables need to be doubled at least.

OMG, this is so good.  I didn't really measure much, just used it as a guide... I had no idea you could make something so simple that tastes so great.  Truly just like stuffed bell peppers.  It wasn't that filling, and I added more rice as I was eating it, but truthfully the amount of rice in the recipe is just right.  Thanks for posting this!

This recipe was fast and easy to put together.  It resulted in a soup that eats like a meal, definitely more like chilli or stew than soup.  I used one yellow and one red bell pepper instead of green peppers and I added a bay leaf with the other spices.  The flavors were great!  This is not a spicy soup so the next time I make it I might experiment with kicking it up a notch.  I will be adding this recipe to my favorites!

If you're looking at this recipe because it is the simplest verison of Stuffed Pepper Soup, look no further.  This is delicious!  I didn't measure any rice, I just cooked some rice and put the desired amount of soup over it.  Instead of ground sirloin, I tried 1 lb. of wafer steak, cut into bite size pieces.  I highly recommend that modification!  Otherwise I followed it exactly.  As soon as you smell this soup, you will know that it is right!  A+

This soup is amazing. I've always been a fan of stuffed peppers and had to try it.  My whole family enjoyed it. I made just a few small changes.  Used 1.5 lbs of venison burger, added an extra green pepper, minced garlic and garlic salt, and used 3 cans of broth (2 chicken, 1 beef).  Also wanted to mention; in the decription it says beef broth and in the recipe it states chicken broth.  I think it's supposed to be beef broth in the recipe.  But it's tasty either way.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent recipe. This was much easier than stuffing peppers and tasted the same. I used one green and one red bell pepper and I added the minute rice to the soup instead of cooking separately. Very filling and tasty! This one goes into my recipe book for sure.

I love this soup!  I don't use the thyme or sage.  Instead I add a sprinkle of chili powder, a dash or two of hot sauce, and a sprinkle of sugar.  I use only half of the rice.  To save time, I use frozen diced onions.  So many friends and family members ask me to make this soup that I multiply it by 5 or 6, cook the whole thing in a roaster oven and freeze in containers for distribution!

This tasted just like my moms stuffed peppers (which were one of my favorite meals growing up).. and it was so quick and easy compared to the all day affair of preparing and cooking a stuffed pepper meal! It's also VERY filling.. so if your looking for a quick and wonderful "stuffed pepper" meal that will stick to your ribs this is the meal for you!

The only thing I'll do different next time I make this meal is add a little extra bell pepper for my own personal taste. 2 thumbs up!

I substituted shallots for Onion and low sodium chicken broth and no salt added tomatoes & sauce to cut down on the salt. I also cooked the rice in a rice cooker. It came out really really good! I will definitely be making this easy recipe again!

Instant Pot Recipe! I knew that I wanted to try this recipe when I saw it but I made mine in my IP! I browned FROZEN burger and onion-then drained the fat. Added everything else just as the recipe called for. I had only Success Rice bags so I made one and dumped another one in the soup. I put the lid on, closed the valve and turned the IP to the soup setting for 15 minutes. I released the pressure valve—it was done. Served over the other bag of rice with hot rolls! I think that this recipe will be great for potluck dinner—it makes a lot!

I love this soup! It's so hearty, delicious, and easy to make! Sometimes I use half ground turkey and half ground sirloin, and I add other seasonings like Italian blend and garlic powder. It's also great with elbow  or shell pasta for a change from rice. It's a family favorite!

Made it tonight, as it is always on our minds on cold, raw, and rainy days. When I make it, I substitute ground turkey for ground hamburg and also don't add the rice to the soup, but add it to each individual bowl, as the rice gets soggy by the next day. This recipe has become a winter time favorite and can be made within a hour, which helps when we both work.

Great easy recipe. I tripled the onion and added 2 cups of celery and a 1/4 cup hot sauce. Amazing. I also did as others and did cooked the rice in the soup and supplemented  my broth. I used beef broth instead of chicken

I made adjustments as follows; I used ground turkey, I added one tablespoon Worcestershire, about three diced carrots, oregano instead of sage and I used 2 cups of a brown rice quinoa blend in place of the rice. My whole family, including picky eaters LOVED IT.

Please use beef broth, not chicken. Beef gives a richer flavor.  If your kids don't like green bell peppers then sub red ones and add some diced carrots.    Change out rice for orzo if you want it a little different.

1tsp. Oregano,1 tsp. Basil,1tsp. Garlic powder. Switched out white rice with brown. Added an extra can of beef broth to make a little more soupy, 1 can rotes tomatoes,1 can diced tomatoes. Our garden this year produced jalapeños that taste like green peppers, so I added 10. Then topped with cheddar cheese when served. Yummy

I made my rice separately and left in the pan. That way we could add as much or as little rice as we wanted. This soup has excellent flavor and would be wonderful on a cool fall day with a nice crusty bread.

Surprise!  I'm rating this based on the recipe as written!  We didn't like the sage in this.  Purely a personal thing, but none of us felt like it even went with this dish.

Ahhh, I did make this a second time and used things like Italian tomatoes and threw in some stuff from the fridge, a few stalks of celery, garlic, red peppers, half a red onion, some leftover beef fajitas (just the meat) from the night before and then used beef broth.  Total game changer!  No sage, the extra veggies and meat and the beef flavor really made it wonderful.  I wouldn't normally tell people about redoing a recipe, but this one needs to be shared!  YUMMY!

I have made this several times now.  I used beef broth instead of chicken, because I feel like it tastes more like the stuffed pepper taste I know (I have particularly needed the beef broth the times when I have substituted ground turkey for the ground beef).  Like others, after the other ingredient have cooked, I added the rice directly into the pot and I added more liquid (beef broth or water) at that point.  For seasoning, because I don't usually cook with sage and thyme, I substituted and used  Italian seasoning and garlic powder.  Everyone loves this recipe.  So glad I found it!  It's easy and delicious.

The only change I made was I did not add the sage.  I am not a big fan of sage, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I thought the soup was just delicious and will definitely make it again.

I put it in a crock pot on high for 6 hours. I had lots to do that day. I cooked the rice in a sauce pan (I'm old fashioned). Then I added it to the stuffed pepper soup the last hour. I used two chopped peppers. My family and I loved it. I'm thinking about making stuffed cabbages that way!  Mrs. T.

Very good. Will definitely make again. Added minced garlic,used 2 green peppers, 1 tbs Italian seasoning instead of the spices in the recipe, 1 tbs Worcestershire, and extra broth (beef) because we like plenty of broth in soup.

Oh, this one’s going in the winter rotation! Absolutely delicious! I added a little Worcestershire and soy, and topped each bowl with some shredded cheddar cheese — all ingredients in my regular stuffed peppers. Outstanding recipe!

It was good. I used home canned quartered tomatoes and did not have any tomato sauce so I used a small can of tomato paste and added a can of water. I also used beef broth instead of chicken added a can of water and cooked the rice in the soup instead of separately. May used more peppers next time.

This was a great base recipe. I used beef broth instead of the chicken broth and I doubled the tomato sauce. I made this in the slow cooker and added rice for the last hour of cooking. It was loved by even my non loving green pepper kids.

Very delicious soup!  The only thing I tried a little different is I used mini sweet peppers instead of a green bell pepper and I added two cans of beef broth.  My customers and family love it.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good. Didn't add sage but added Italian spices and garlic.
Used brown rice and even though it was already cooked it did soak up a lot  of the juice.  A hearty stew.

It was good, but needed something to make it above and beyond.  While it tasted like stuffed peppers, it needed some more spice or something - I thought this recipe was a little bland.

The soup was good, maybe needed more seasoning in the beef when browning.  It seamed to taste better the next day.

I don’t put sage or chopped tomatoes in mine. Extra tomato sauce and just a little more garlic not much more than what is in the original recipe. I we like ours more stew like ,so rice goes in when it starts boiling I add it along with salt and black pepper. Oh 1/2 pound more beef.

I love this soup!  It’s my favorite thing to make because I love stuff peppers.  I add extra ingredients like ground meat, onions and tomatoes.  This is great when it’s cold outside or almost anytime.

This was really good.  I altered a few of the ingredients, due to our personal taste and what I had on hand.  I used a quart of  my home canned stewed tomatoes, NO tomato sauce, and cut back on the sage  and ground thyme, as they can be overpowering .  I added the cooked rice just before serving, so it didn't soak up the soup to much. Great recipe and easy.  Will definitely make again.

My favorite soup ever!  I made this in the instant pot! Browned 1# of italian pork sausage (was what I had on hand) on the sauté setting until cooked through.  Added the peppers and onions and sautéed until onions were translucent.  Added the tomatoes, tomato sauce and chicken broth (which I doubled).  Added seasonings.  Set instant pot to high pressure cook for 8 minutes; natural release for 10 minutes.  Added 2 cups of cooked white rice when done.  Stir and serve with a sprinkle of parmesan cheese - delicious!!!

Came out great. I used quinoa in place of rice, added an extra green pepper, a banana pepper, and used my own tomato & basil puree (since the garden is pumping everything out!). I also used 1/2 ground turkey, 1/2 pork sausage with sage. It was GREAT!

Great recipe. I actually put all the ingredients together in the crockpot. I left it going low and slow while at work and came home to a lovely aroma. The rice is super easy so you can either set it ahead of time as well or put it on when you get home. Makes plenty for easy leftovers and I actually added 24 oz of chicken broth which increased the volume without taking away from the flavor.

I made this twice now, and got GREAT reviews about it.  One time I used chicken broth, the second time beef broth--the beef was better than the chicken, IMHO  I also added a dash of red pepper flakes to "brighten" this up a bit the 2nd time.

I loved it and will be making this again. I did do a little bit of modifications to add my own touch for my tasting by adding a half of a red pepper, plenty of back pepper and also a little bit of crushed red pepper to give it a little heat!!! My husband even loved this and he doesn’t like soups.

This was great. I would cover the pan as you simmer onions. And with final simmer. Doesn’t say to add rice so we just put it over rice and some people mixed it in a bowl. Tastes great just like stuffed peppers. We did not have any thyme. So didn’t add it. It was fine.

This is a very tasting soup. One of my favourites. As I added extra veggies-celery and mushroom I also added 2 extra cups of water and use boiloin cubes. You can cook the rice in it however you need to adjust the water per rice instructions.

Really good soup.  I added one more pepper, about 1/2 cup more onion, used beef stock instead of chicken broth, added two large cloves of garlic minced with the peppers and onions and 1 1/2 tsp. of basil instead of the thyme and sage and I used brown vs. white rice.  I know it  changes the original recipe, but I changed the ingredients knowing what my family loves.  We really liked this soup and will make it again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was such a quick, easy, and delicious soup to make so it will be made many times in the future.

I did make slight changes though.  First, I didn’t have an onion in the house, so I made it without.  Second, I had about a pound and one-half of ground chuck so I used all of it plus I put in an extra diced pepper.  Lastly, I added the rice directly in with all the other ingredients as opposed to cooking it separately.  This probably resulted in me needing to add extra chicken broth but that was fine, as a result we shared some of this tasty soup with the neighbors.....thats always a good thing to do!!

This is a great soup! I have followed the advice of others and made a few changes. I wanted more meat and peppers in it so I used 1 lb of ground sirloin and 1 lb of ground turkey as well as 3 large green peppers. I also used almost a carton of beef broth and cooked the rice separately so that we add it to the bowl.
I did not use the sage. Instead, I added dried basil, oregano, garlic powder and thyme. Also, I added about 2 tbsp. of sugar to offset the acidity of tomatoes. Next time I'll add a few seeded and diced jalapenos. Thank you for the recipe!

Having an abundance of green peppers, I was looking for a good recipe to use them.  This was a good choice!
I essentially doubled the batch, though I went with 3 green peppers and kept the rice amount the same.  Everything else I doubled and it turned out great.
I will definitely make this again!

Absolutely omit the sage and thyme-  weird flavors in there.  Like the idea of oregano and basil and beef broth-  will try that next time

Fantastic recipe! I used basil and oregano for spices and i used beef broth because it was all i had on hand.  Also, I added about 1/4c of ketchup to enhance the tomato flavor.  I couldn't stop eating this soup! Thanks for sharing !

Definitely one of my new favorite dishes!! I made a few spice changes based on previous comments and used ground turkey. Also I used two green peppers. I really don't think one would be enough for the overall size of the dish. My husband (who isn't usually a fan of stuffed green peppers) and my two granddaughters all loved it. Also, we sprinkled some shredded cheese on top which made it even better! I'm still full from eating too much of it but I'm already looking forward to having the leftovers tomorrow!

I was out of chicken broth so I used beef broth and it was great! Also I added about a cup of water and I put the rice in raw and let it cook to save an extra step. Turned our perfect.

I made this in the crockpot.  Recipe turned out really well.  The only change I would make is more liquid at the start .  I added the cooked rice for the last 30 minutes and it absorbed almost all the liquid, but the flavor was outstanding.

I use beef broth instead and since green peppers don't agree with me use a mix of red and small amount of green for color. I also add a hot pepper for some kick. One of my family favorites.

I am not a tomato based soup person so I left out the tomatoes and added a small bottle of chili sauce and a large clove of chopped garlic for some kick.  I exchanged brown rice for the white because it is so much healthier and I cooked it in beef broth.  I agree with the reviewer who said sage doesn't belong in this soup; i used fresh thyme and beef broth instead of chicken broth.  My man loved it!

This was just what I needed as I wanted a brothy, tomato based soup bc I have tonsillitis. I didn't use sage. I added in a few dashes of oregano & garlic powder. I also threw in some diced jalapenos from my garden. This was easy to make, filling, tastes great leftover, and pretty cheap to make without all the hassle of real stuffed peppers. Thanks for sharing!:)

This recipe is awesome but I made quite a few changes due to the ingredients I had on hand.  I used 1lb of beef and 1/2 lb of ground sweet sausage (I will use hot sausage next time for some spice).  I added many chopped vegetables - onions, garlic, celery, 2 large red peppers, zucchini, mushrooms, and cherry tomatoes. I also did not use the herbs recommended but used a handful of fresh basil and oregeno from the garden - YUM!  I used only beef broth and added water to help thin the soup and I added tomato paste.  I didn't have rice on hand but I had about a cup of risotto which I cooked separately and added - turned out perfect!  The soup was amazing topped with some shredded sharp cheddar cheese!

My family loved this soup (and my hubby isn't crazy about stuffed peppers but loved the soup version). I did add one can of tomato sauce 8oz and one can of tomato soup, instead of  16 oz of tomato sauce. 
It was delicious!

This was very good, my whole family including my picky children loved it. However, next time I make this, I will definitely leave out the sage as it does not fit this dish.

Thie has become a family favorite!   The only thing I do differently is add my dry rice to the soup and let it simmer till the rice is done.   Mine is more like a stew rather than a soup but we like it very much that way.

I followed the recipe directions and doubled the recipe because I have a large family. I also doubled the amount of chicken broth because the rice soaked up the original recipe's amount  even though it was cooked in a separate pan. Also put in twice the amount of peppers as mine were small. Delicious!!

Easy recipe to put together. I put this in the crock pot after cooking the Hamburg. I also cooked the rice then added it.

My husband made this, and the result was so satisfying and delicious, it's boosted his confidence to make more soups! He didn't realize it was so easy -- and with ingredients we had on hand. His modifications: 1 litre of beef broth and 2 cups of chicken broth in place of the tomato sauce. He used about 3 tbsps of tomato paste and also simmered it with a cup of frozen corn before adding the rice. Skipped the sage in favour of garlic salt and taco seasoning. We will pass this recipe on to our bachelor son as well!

I made this for a soup party I had on Halloween.   It really does taste like stuffed peppers, only better.   I like the ratio of the ingredients better than stuffed peppers and so much easier.
This recipe is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

I found this to be excellent. I love soup. Sometimes it's a hit or miss with recipes. This was so hearty and delicious. Very flavorful. I did add a little bit more liquid. I like to do that, because I feel like broth usually gets absorbed so easily, especially when there are leftovers.

This was a hearty soup but I felt like it was missing something.  I increased the garlic, added some  Worcestershire sauce and a little hot pepper sauce to spice it up.  I will make this one again!

Not as good as the stuffed green pepper.  I added cheese, sour cream, and jalapeño slices afterwards, gave it a little more flavor. Next time I'd add more green pepper, burger and more liquid. It was very thick.

My family loved this! I did make some changes; Italian seasoning/basil instead of thyme/sage (those spices are not for stuffed peppers) and I added garlic.  Turned out amazing! Will make again!

My husband and son loved it. Next time I am going to cook the onions and 1/2 the green pepper with the ground beef and add the remaining 1/2 of the peppers as directed in the recipe.  Then it'll be 5 stars for me too. I added 2T vinegar and 1T sugar like I add to my baked stuffed pepper sauce.  And I used a can of tomato soup since I did not have any tomato sauce.

The night before I made this dish my husband and I ate at a local Italian restaurant and I ordered their stuffed pepper soup. I loved it so much I searched for a recipe to provide me the same taste. My husband said trying to replicate the delicious soup the next day was a mistake but he and I were pleasantly surprised. Although this recipe does not replicate the restaurant soup it is fabulous. The flavor comes together quickly and the ingredients are typically in my fridge and pantry. This soup is a staple throughout our fall and winter months!

Great recipe. I double the recipe when I make it. Followed recipe exact except for substituting 1/8 cup brown sugar for the sage and thyme. This will be perfect for fall camping trips.

An easy and delicious soup!  I can't believe how tasty it is considering it calls for canned tomato's, but that's what makes it fast.  Just make sure you add cooked white rice or you'll have a so thick "soup" you'd have to use a fork....and it wasn't very good!  I used a half cup uncooked white rice, thinking I could save a step...it was a disaster! I've also used ground turkey and the flavor is just as delicious!

Delicious!  I made a loaf of homemade bread with this and everyone loved it.  I did add a few of my own tweeks to this recipe.  Like extra green pepper, stewed tomatoes and tomato paste to thicken it up.  I didn't cook the onion and peppers for very long, I like a little crunch in my peppers.  Give it a try!!

We made the soup exactly like the recipe and when it was done it smelled amazing, but when we tried it we didn't like it, but if you liked stuffed peppers you probably would like it.

I just changed up the spices, I used petite diced tomatoes with garlic and added Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning.  Like several other reviewers, we had tried this soup in a restaurant, this recipe is close.

I found this to be a great "get you started recipe" I had hot Italian sausage so I used it instead of Ground beef, then I used some mild Hungarian peppers and two Red bell peppers, doubled the sauce and broth but used beef broth instead of chicken. Brown rice instead of white and it turned out wonderful. Not to spicy but definitely not bland. Thanks to the recipe I the ingredients amounts and basic instruction, I now have a soup I will make over and over.

This soup is better than actual stuffed peppers and very filling!  I added some oregano (but I put that in just about everything) and some freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano. I also didn't add all the rice.  Just about half.  I can't wait for tomorrow when it's even better!

Pretty Good.  I used ground turkey and a quinoa/brown rice blend.  I also added shredded zucchini (I was already cooking and had some left over and didn't know what else to do with it).  I also didn't have any Thyme on hand.  Next time I'll be sure to add it because I felt like "something" was missing.  Anyway, I will definitely make this again - as directed (except for using ground turkey).

I made it as directed except for the thyme and sage. I used a half teaspoon of Italian seasoning blend. It's delicious the next day. The next time I make it, I'm going to make it in bulk, freeze batches before adding cooked rice, and when I'm ready to serve, add 2 cups of cooked rice to the thawed soup-a quick home-made meal when you are pressed for time.

I made this for the guys this week.  It was easy and delicious.  I did all of the prep work the night before and then put it in the crock pot and refrigerated until morning.  The next morning I turned on the crock pot.  I made some brown rice and we ladled the soup over the brown rice and it was delicious.

My favorite soup recipe...hands down!  Had tons of green peppers from the garden last year and I will have no trouble using them up in this soup.  Is a lot like a chili but the rice makes it different.  Simply delish!!

This was really good.  I gave it 4 stars because I made changes based on others reviews and my own taste for things.  I added 1/2 tsp. oregano and omitted the sage - that just didn't seem to fit into this recipe.  I used about 1 tsp. dried minced garlic and about 1/2 tsp. garlic powder (you can never have too much garlic, right?)  Instead of chicken broth, I used 2 large beef boullion cubes and about 3 cups water.  I used about 2 T. Worcestershire sauce and 1 T. soy sauce - I know, soy sounds odd for a dish like this but it brings the beefy taste out in a soup.  I used some cooked, brown rice and we really enjoyed it.  With the changes (maybe more like additions) we'd give it a 5 star.  In all, this was way better than one of the other Stuffed Pepper Soup recipes on this site and a terrific meal for a cold winter day.  Thanks Kate.

As above, don't put the rice IN the soup, cook it separately and put the portion you want into your bowl when serving. Don't put the leftover rice and soup together either. Rice will be too mushy when heated up.

I use half of the hamburger,(not supposed to have saturated fat) and use diet lean and it seems to be enough and tastes great. 

Some shredded cheddar on top of your hot soup in your bowl is great if you can have it.

Very good soup.  I'm not much of a soup person, but I love the hearty flavor.  One change I made was I used one pound of original sausage rather than ground sirloin.

This was really good.  It definitely needed more seasoning, in my opinion, so I added some onion powder, garlic powder, dried parsley and basil, and a dash each of Worcestershire sauce and Frank's Red Hot sauce.

I added a red pepper, a second green pepper and measured a quarter teaspoon of each spice and cooked my rice with the recommended salt. Simple, hearty and yummy!

I've made this many times, but I changed a few things. I only put a small amount of rice in the soup, but keep a bowl of cooked rice on the side to put in the bottom of the soup bowl. The only seasonings I use are salt,pepper and oregano. I do add Worcestershire sauce. I use beef and chicken broth and about 3/4 can tomato soup with the rest of the tomatoes/ sauce. After browning meat/ adding onion and green pepper, I cook in the crock pot. On high a couple hours then low for a couple. Also some cheddar cheese to top off the bowl! (Sorry I don't use measurements, I cook by sight and taste)

I just made a double batch of this tonight, but used 3# of meat and no rice (since we are eating grain free right now).  It was excellent!  I did cook the onions separately in ghee to let them caramelize and added a tablespoon of honey to give it a little sweetness, counteracting the acid of the tomatoes and sharp flavor of the green peppers.

While driving from So Cal to Phoenix one trip we stopped at a little local restaurant in Needles and decided to try this soup. It was SOOoooo delicious we immediately knew we'd have to find a recipe. This comes so close to what we enjoyed without any changes at all other than making it a bit thicker than a 'soup'. I'd say we like it best 1/2 way between a soup and a chili thickness. Very hearty and warming.  We only add the cooked rice when we're ready to eat and only in the amount of soup we're eating. We found  by leaving the rice in the pot caused the rice to break down.  Very delicious recipe!!

We loved this!

Admittedly, we used it as a starting point. With household roots a blend of Puerto Rico and the Mississippi Delta, we do *not* like bland. After reading the other reviews here, I added a few liberal splashes of Worcestershire, somewhere around a teaspoon or so of powdered garlic, several shakes of adobo, two packets of  sazón, and more Tabasco-style hot sauce than would probably appeal to many cooks here. We did use black pepper, but no more added salt, because the adobo and sazón contan plenty of that for the main pot; one of us still added more salt at the table.  I think I'd have liked a bit of filé instead of the thyme, but we were out, and the thyme worked just fine.  Finally, I ended up  using a whole 32-ounce carton of fat-free chicken broth; the small can definitely wouldn't have been enough. (I like the suggestions from others to use half chicken and half beef, but since I'd already opened the larger carton, that's what we used.)

I agree with the reviewer who offered ten stars if that were possible--this one's a keeper!

For an extra kick I use 1/2 hot Italian sausage and 1/2 ground beef. I also use one 10 oz can Rotel tomatoes and one 10 oz can of diced tomatoes. My family loves the extra spice it gives it!!

Absolutely awesome soup.  I used ground turkey instead of sirloin, added onion and garlic and used a hot pepper as well as the green pepper.  I also added a can of diced tomato with cilantro and lime juice.  This is a keeper and we will have this many times during the winter.

I found this very bland so tweeked it a Little. Used chicken broth and beef broth and a half bottle of beer.  Also added red pepper flakes and some worchestershirte.  Cooked the rice and added it little by little. Did not use all the rice saved the rest for refried rice. Used red pepper not the green as red has more flavor.

We loved this soup. Perfect for a cold fall day and leftovers are easily stored for later. Used brown rice and didn't have thyme or sage but it tasted fine without them. I will add taco seasoning next time like others suggested. Yum!

I made this instead of stuffed peppers.   Good basic recipe although I changed some things. I used green bell pepper and hot banana pepper ( we like things spicey ) I didn't have chicken broth so I used beef broth and also about a tablespoon of beef base. I added about a talblespoon of brown sugar because it was a bit on the sour side, which may have been becasue I used my home canned tomatoes instead of store bought. The sugar took the edge off quite nicely and made a great tasting soup for this snowey February day.Thanks

This recipe was just wonderful!!  I doubled it so we'd have leftovers and thank goodness because everyone in my house had seconds!!  The only changes I made were to add the rice uncooked to make it more stew-like.  I also added a little garlic.  This ones a keeper!!

Excellent! I always have a lot of peppers and tomatoes from the garden and am looking for ways to use them. I used 2 green peppers and 3 large tomatoes, instead of the canned tomatoes. I followed the recipe pretty close and it came out wonderful and it is easy to make.

This has a good flavor but I would only use half the rice next time I made it.

A really delicious soup!  Have tasted other recipes...but this is the best.  I made a few minor modifications that include: 1-1/2 lbs. ground chuck, and 2 chopped green peppers.  Everything else stayed the same! Thanks, Kate!
