I peeled and cut my mango last night, then stuck it in the freezer so that I could use it in this smoothie and omit the ice. I used one packet Truvia sweetener instead of sugar. I'm sorry, this smoothie just wasn't a hit. I shared this with my son and though we drank it, we didn't enjoy it.

I really didn't like this. The honey was overwhelming, the mango taste drowned out, and there was too much milk to make a proper smoothie. Throwing the ice in with the other ingredients helped - but not much. I won't be making this again.

I did not care for this recipe.  I should have listened to the 2 previous reviewers.

I agree with reviewer Basq; this was not good enough to try again.

I used half fresh and half frozen mango.  I still threw some ice in but don't think it was needed.  I have to agree with gramcracr -- the bigger greenish/red/yellow type produce *twice* as much mango as the smaller yellow ones, so it's going to make a huge difference the type of mango used.  I think this would be awful with one of the smaller ones.  The larger ones are about 1-1/2 cups cubed.  I used one small and then filled in the rest of that measurement with frozen.  I tasted plenty of mango, and rather than thinking it was too sweet, thought it needed the sweetener cause mango isn't sweet.  (Needs sugar or juice that's sweet, or something.)  Using the bigger mango this was fairly good, though there are other mango smoothies I like better.  But it's worth a try if you use enough mango.  (Though blame can be put on the recipe -- when something varies in size so much, a measurement/weight needs to be given, not how many!)

It's actually a really light, refreshing drink. And for those who didn't care for it, maybe try the large mangoes (the ones that are red/green/yellow) if you were using the small yellow ones.

This was great. I tweaked it a little - froze the mango and did not add the ice, cut the honey in half. Deliciously divine.

Yum! I substituted the milk for almond milk because I'm lactose intolerant. Then I threw everything in the blender including the ice. It turned out delicious and refreshing. This makes for a great breakfast smoothie.

i dunno about you, but this recipe was waaaaay too sweet for my liking. not to mention that it is all watery because of the milk content.

I added a bit more honey and sugar, and a little less ice.  But, it was the best thing i've ever made!

This was the first smoothie I ever tried.  It was okay, but I have to agree with others...the honey was overpowering... I added a banana and that was pretty decent.

The sugar stayed grainy, and the whole thing was too sweet.  Next time I will probably make it without the sugar.  I also added a frozen banana to thicken it.
