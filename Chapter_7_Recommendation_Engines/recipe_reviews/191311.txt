Quite good. I used La Creme vanilla yogurt and homemade lemon curd. I really was the only person who thourougly enjoyed this parfait, the boys were non-plussed. I think the toasted coconut and homemade curd really made this extra special.

Made this recipe because trying to get rid of pantry items and had the ingredients.  I had old jar of lemon curd I especially wanted to use up.  My husband loved this and so easy.  Good enough for entertaining.
