Delicious! Wish I had more sauce, may double it next time. Everyone loved it including the kids (12 and 5) but I served their sauce on the side. Such an different and enjoyable way to serve pork tenderloin. I didn't have fresh gingeroot so I substituted crystalized ginger. Served it with roasted red potatoes. Plan on making this for guests.

This was not one of my favorite recipes.The meat turned out well but I was not impressed with the sauce. My kids wouldn't eat it, and my husband thought it was alright. Maybe I am not use to the taste of the 5 spice.

Sorry, I didn't much care for the 5-spice flavor in this recipe. I prefer cooking pork tenderloin with wine instead.

This grape sauce is AMAZING!!! It is such a simple way to dress up a tenderloin. I made it for my parents and company and it was a big hit! I am making it again tomorrow and will use it again and again!

I loved this recipe!  My guests raved about it and ate seconds and thirds. The only change I made was to sear meat first and bake in 400 deg oven for 25 mins.  Used instant read thermometer to check when 145 deg internally, removed from oven and let set for 10~15 mins loosly covered with foil. Made sauce during this resting time.

I agree with the comments about 5 spice pdr.  Leave it out if you don't like it but if you do, this is a delicious recipe just as it is.  I used green grapes that were past their prime.  It is a great way to use up grapes that aren't crisp anymore.  The pork and sauce are very good together.  This is a "make again" according to my family.

I ended up baking the pork in a shallow dish at 325 for 45 minutes.  The pork turned out great.  The grape sauce leaves something to be desired.  Was not work the work to make the sauce.  Will not make again.

I omitted the 5-spice powder only b/c I forgot to add it, I also used powdered Honey from a local spice shop instead of regular honey to cut down in sugars. As someone else did I also cooked mine at 325 degrees for 45 minutes b/c I don't have a grill. I was a bit worried about the grapes but the dish was great!!

Great company fare but make sure they like the flavor of 5 spice powder.   This is certainly not for everyone but the end result (if you like this spice) is wonderful.

This was excellent. I didn't like the Honey Grape sauce at first when I tried it on its own but then I added more honey and tried with with the tenderloin and it was awesome. Def. would make again.

This was pretty good, although I made some alterations. I omitted the shallots, used about 1 teaspoon of garlic, used some rosemary, and used Montreal Steak Seasoning as the rub.  I used ground ginger, omitted the five spice, and doubled the remainder of the ingredients for the sauce. The basic pork was very tasty.  The sauce was good, just a bit different.

My husband and I loved this recipe! I did use onion because that's what I had on hand and I eyeballed everything else; that's how I cook. I had already cooked pork that I just heated up and then served the sauce over it. It was great tasting!! Will make this one again and again.

This tenderloin was great, made for company and had wonderful reviews. the only thing I did as a change was to cut the 5 spice in half and it was the perfect amount. Great Great flavor thanks for this recipe

This is a very flavorful recipe. Make sure you like 5-spice powder or you may be disappointed.  I used an immersion blender for the sauce and it worked perfectly. Served with roasted new potatoes and a salad and it was great!

Thoroughly enjoyed this recipe.  The sauce really styles up what would be a ordinary grilled pork tenderloin entree.  It comes together quickly for a weekday dinner and has very nice presentation.

I used pork chops that were browned in a skillet and finished cooking in the oven.  This sauce is fantastic!  I'm excited to try it again and to have it on chicken also!

This is a delicious dish especially when you add the 5 spice powder which is widely used by  Chinese chefs to bring out the aroma and add flavour in the meat.

The sauce is okay but has no connection to the tenderloin. We found it rather flat.

Made this last night.  Was very good.  One of the reviews said there was not enough sauce so I doubled it and have enough for several dinners which is OK.  Did not have any Asian 5 spice do did not use it.  Don't know how much difference that would make.

I baked the pork chops in the oven with some olive oil and butter instead of grilling them. Omitted the Asian spice and ginger. Also topped the pork chops with grapes after pouring the sauce on them. The flavor was delicious, my husband and I loved this recipe!

We enjoyed this recipe - went together as directed and smelled wonderful!  I did not care for the color of the sauce - but easy enough to remedy in the future.

Loved the grape/5-spice sauce!  A tad on the sweet side for me, may back off on the honey a bit next time but will definitely be making again and again.  A keeper for sure.

I tried this recipe because it sounded so unusual with the grape sauce- we loved it! I cooked 2 pork tenderloins in the crock pot after dusting with the asian seasoning. I also adjusted sauce ingredients to yield about 1 cup to drizzle over sliced tenderloin. Served over buttered rice. YUM!!

I made this for us - made half the recipe since there are only 2 of us - last evening!  It was just great!  I didn't grill the tenderloin but roasted it with salt and pepper in my toaster oven for 35 mins @ 350 degrees for the one pound tenderloin I used.  I cut back on the soy sauce by about a teaspoon (too salty) and put in a heaping tablespoon of honey.  Halved the rest exactly - perfect.  I had the left over pieces with the sauce on top for lunch today - cold!  Even that was great!  This is going in my own cookbook and will definitely serve it to guests!

We all really liked the little Asian twist the glaze had. Very tasty
