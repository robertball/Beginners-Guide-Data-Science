The crust for this pie was amazing. However, I followed the instructions perfectly for the creamy lemon portion and it did not turn out for mel. The taste was somewhat bitter and the cream cheese didn't melt all the way which left it looking lumpy and caused it to not set up. I was disappointed.

I was making this recipe for a group of friends. The crust was great, but could not get the filling to thicken enough and when added the cream cheese it was not smooth and creamy. I did the filling twice and was very disappointed. I ended up going out to buy a dessert. So very upset.
