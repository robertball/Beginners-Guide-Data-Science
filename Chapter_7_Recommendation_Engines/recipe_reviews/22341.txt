This is exactly what I was looking for! I followed the recipe exactly in making the pastry. It is so soft and moist, just like the ones you buy in the pastry shops. Everyone loved it! Thanks!

Edit: I used this recipe together with Pastry Cream recipe and they both complemented each other very well!

These were good but a filling of light white creme would have perhaps been better.  My pastries were very light (which is good!) but when the dark filling absorbed a bit it made them look heavy.  With the chocolate on top, the filling makes the eclair pretty rich.  My guests liked them but next time I'll switch out the filling for something that's non-chocolate.

I used instant pudding, and instead of slicing the eclair in half and filling with pudding, I punched a small hole in the side and spooned the pudding inside.  A very fancy dessert!

The recipe was great. But instead of slicing the side open to insert the filling, i would suggest taking a small paring knife and poking a small hole in one end of each one. Then using a pastry bag equipped with a small tip, pipe the filling into each one. You can control how much you want each one will have and its all contained inside.

I have this recipe from some book or something, it is AMAZING!!  I dont use chocolate pudding though, VANILLA pudding is FANTASTIC, it tastes sooo good, like i bought it from a fancy bakery or something.  Recipe is perfect!! Instead of the 4 eggs(which are listed as medium in my sheet) i use 2 extra large eggs.  works out fine!

This recipe is great! Although as other reviews noted these are not exactly miniature. I greased up my hands with shortening to shape eclairsand made 36 bite size eclairs using a melon-baller for consistency. I cooked at 400 for 15 minutes, then reduced temp to 350 for 15 more. Then i let cool on the baking pans insteadof transferring to a wire rack.  I did not cut the slits in the side, I used a corkscrew to poke holes once they were out of the oven for good and a ziplock bag with one end snipped off to fill. I ended up needin 1.5 5-oz boxes of non-instant pudding. For the frosting, I just turned over and dunked into melted icing and flipped back over to let dry, then drizzled the remaining frosting.  Was a huge hit!! The best news, one is only about 100 calories!

I had never made eclairs before this recipe, and they still turned out perfect! It was really easy to follow, and my family loved them (didnt last long!) **cutting the slit in the sides part way through made all the difference**
thanks for the great recipe, will be made again for sure!

I made these today for our Sunday dessert. They were quite easy to make ahead of time and keep in the refrigerator. I don't really see why you need to use non-instant pudding instead of the pre-made packaged one. I was surprised that the pastry part came out light and crispy. I'll try these again when we have company.

It was delicious and fairly easy to make. I just had a little trouble getting them into small half inch loaves. I recommend using a pastry dispenser.

These are very GOOD! except they were not miniature actually they were the biggest cream puff/eclairs i have EVER SEEN! but they were still very delicious! and the icing was fantastic! ... ..... .... . I followed the directions exactly but used a 5 oz. pudding mix since that was all i had! it was JUST THE PERFECT amount to fill each eclair evenly! i will make this again very soon actually,(within the week,quite soon right?....)THANKS

What an easy and amazing recipe!  These were the best eclairs I've ever had.  I did use vanilla pudding as a personal preference, but other than that this recipe is perfect. The pastry was delicate and the chocolate frosting was creamy and not overly sweet.   I will definitely be making these for the holidays.

Delicious and easy! I used a pkg. of sugar free fat free cheesecake flavored pudding. I didn't cut the tops off. I gently eased the slit open and put filling in there. I got 10 pretty big eclairs out of the recipe. Maybe I'll get better at making them smaller.

Yummy yum YUM. These were delish! Like a true French delicacy! I am making these for a French party, so yesterday i decided to test these out. I went to the local grocery store, Seiyu, to buy ingredient. I saw some  ready made eclairs and decided to try them out to, to see what they should taste like. I go home and make eclair, mine were kind of ugly when i put them on the sheet, i thought they might expand like a cookie they don't. These were just for me and my family tho so it was fine. Right out of the oven, they wern't that tasty, but i refrigerated them overnight and BOY were they crazy good in the morning! MUCH better than store bought. I follow recipe exactly, except for vanilla pudding instead of chocolate!

I loved these. If they aren't cooking all the way through, what i did that seemed to work was took a knife and instead of a one inch slit I did it most of the way through. For the filling I used a vanilla filling similar to bavarian cream, one 8 oz whipped frozen topping (thawed) 3.5 oz vanilla pudding, 2 tsp. vanilla extract. Came out super delicious :)

Delish! However, the icing needs major changes. Half the conf sugar and triple the chocolate. Its was so dry I couldn't even stir it, so added milk and chocolate the make it smooth and creamy. Ended up great, got rave reviews at the party!

Made this into heart shaped eclairs for Valentine's Day and they were delicious! I am only giving 4 stars because I did make some changes.  As other suggested, I used the French Pastry Cream recipe instead of the pudding and it was perfect!  Also had to add some cocoa powder to the frosting to make it taste chocolate.  Mine did not require near the baking time either - not sure if it was because of the shape although I wouldn't think that would make much difference.  Will make again though!

Well, they taste like Eclairs!  I used vanilla pudding (instant) and it helped it from tasting too chocolatey...the chocolate topping was great and the pastry was okay.  The dough was difficult to work with and I thought I did something wrong, but when I cooked them they turned out fine.  I would probably try this recipe again.  It was pretty easy.

I can honestly say this is the easiest recipe I've ever followed.  The only problem I had was they came out a little to big for my liking.  So next time I cut it down.  I made a dozen and filled 6 with whip cream and 6 with vanilla pudding,  topping them with melted chocolate chips.  Both were awesome.  This recipe is a definite keeper!!

Unbelievably easy and delicious!! For the filling I combined Homemade Vanilla Pudding from this site + whipped NutriWhip and just drizzled melted dark chocolate on the tops. They were excellent.

I decided against chocolate pudding and chose Jello custard flavor that's not instant and needs some cooking.  The size is 2.9 ounces, but calls for two cups of milk and, for extra richness, a beaten egg yolk in the mix.  I used 1% milk and it requires constant stirring on medium heat until you get a boil, (about ten minutes) then it's poured into a bowl to chill. The result is a wonderful filling that tastes just like French pastry creme.  The dough is simple to make on the stove, but requires a lot of heavy mixing as you throughly blend each egg before adding the next.  These are not miniature - I had 12 eclairs that puffed to full size - baking timing was exactly right.  Used Ghiradelli baking chocolate squares for the frosting and followed the recipe exactly.  They took awhile to make, but the results were impressive and delicious!  Piled them on a lovely plate and took them to the family's house on Valentines Day.  Absolutely would do these again.  Wonderful!

Great recipe. I made a traditional pastry cream instead of the instant, and it made them taste truely authentic! I also piped the eclair batter onto baking sheets which made it very easy and uniform in size. Very yummy treat.

These pastries didn't turn out as light and fluffy as I would have preferred. That being said, I think almost any filling would have been successful--next time I might try herbs and garlic or cheese.

These really made an impression! They were easier than I thought they would be, but the dough was a bit sticky to work with. I used 3 eggs, margarine instead of butter, and I made a vanilla pudding filling (made with vanilla pudding mix, 2 cups soy milk- to keep it non-dairy, and a container of whippping cream to make it a thicker consistency- since the soymilk doesn't let the pudding thicken). In my oven, it definitely took less than 35 minutes- they got a bit overdone. Also, don't grease the cookie sheet! Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is great!!!! I used instant vanilla pudding for the center. and I used a frosting unit (or plastic bag with a hole in it) to actually squeeze out the eclair batter. Delicious when put in the freezer by the way.

The pastry was so easy! I was really surprised about that!  I used instant pudding (all I had on hand) and chocolate ganache from this site to top them!

These were a BIG hit at my dinner party.  I substituted whipped double cream with some icing (powdered) sugar and vanilla and piped this in through the hole cut while cooking.  Chocolate pudding sounded a bit too sweet to me.

These eclairs are not only easy to make but they are delicious!! I used vanilla pudding for a filling instead of chocolate.  I piped the pudding in through the hole that I made during the baking.  They look as good as they taste.

Everyone loved these.  I was a bit nervous to make a pastry, but they were not as difficult as I thought they would be.     I used vanilla pudding mix and mixed in half of a container of cool whip, tasted delicous!  Other than that, I followed the recipe.

Pastry bags are a must! makes it so much easier and I used vanilla pudding...maybe next time fold in some whip cream to make the filling fluffy..I only baked mine for 35 mins and made a slit on top and piped in the filling. Also make the chocolate last it sets up sort of quick!Over all it was super!

This recipe is excellent except for two things. One, it's worth making a pudding better than your average box mix and definitely NOT an instant mix - instant is too soft and will break. The second is that these are not "mini". They're huge. To make mini, I dropped teaspoon scoops of dough and reduced the two baking times to 30min/5min. They came out beautifully.

Excellent recipe!  So easy, even I managed to pull these off!! Delicious!  I piped the eclairs onto a baking sheet, and filled them with pastry creme thru the slit cut in during baking.  So yummy!!

These eclairs are great. In my oven I needed to deduct 10F and 10 minutes, so make sure yours don't overcook!
I would have given them 5* but I was not keen to try the chocolate pudding center- I just used a pastry cream recipe and injected them into the eclairs through the hole I had poked in the side during cooking. Lots of tasters and lots of love for these eclairs! 5* if you make them with pastry cream!

A great recipe, conghairdeas! I used a pastry cream recipient by the user christiniebeanie instead of pudding to fill the shells, and though I thought it seemed like too many eggs at first, it ended up tasting amazing!

These are by no means mini eclairs! I made 14 and they were still kinda big. Even after lowering the temp and shortening the baking time, they burned on the bottom. I probably made the slits too deep because they were completely hollow and broke out the bottom when I removed them. I had to fill them upside down! I used vanilla pudding (would have used bavarian creme filling if I had it) and the taste was awesome. I will adjust them and try again!

I tried my hand at this for the very first time today, as I've always wanted to be able to make eclairs.  I only changed one thing, I used vanilla pudding. They were the best I've ever eaten. Better than a bakery. Will use this recipe on any occasion that arises. Thank you for posting it. It's surely going to be a winner that goes on for years in my home.

I was disappointed in this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly for the pastry, and they did not rise at all.  The spread dough rectangles cooked into flat rectangles.  I put the pudding on them anyway to try and salvage the mess of a pastry it became, and even the kids didn't want more than one.  Bummer.

I didn't really like these. It was almost as if they were over cooked on the outside and under cooked on the inside. They had a strange taste to them too, not like store bought eclaires. I followed the recipe exactly, so I'm not sure what happened. I really liked the icing though.

The Eclair part didn't really work right, some fluffed up and some didn't. I didn't like the flavor very much eather they were a bit eggy, they tasted a little like yorkshire pudding.
Gave them four stars because others in house liked them.
