I'm giving this recipe 4 stars because I altered it so much, I'm not sure its fair to give it a 5.  I couldn't waste HALF a can of pumpkin, so I doubled it right off the bat, using a 15 ounce can of pumpkin. I ran out of flour, so I used half all-purpose and half whole-wheat flour; I ran out of white sugar, so I used half white sugar and half brown sugar. They turned out wonderful- I would say better than any other recipe I've tried!  In the future, I will use the half-wheat/half-brown sugar again.    Also, I use more spice than most of the pumpkin cookie recipes call for.. so I added a 1/2 tsp of clove, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, and 1/2 tsp of allspice in addition to the cinnamon. divine!  Way better than store bought.

I cut the vegetable oil down to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce.  The cookies came out moist, firm yet cakey, and held their shape while baking very nicely.

I was very disappointed by this recipe - not much flavor. I think it could be improved by adding salt and possibly using brown sugar instead of white.

I like that these are not strong tasting cookies. Not too sugary. We carved pumpkins and used the carved bits instead of the canned pumpkin and it was delicious! Boil the pumpkin bits like you would potatos them mash. Excellent!

Good cookie. Tasted better the next day after they sat awhile.  Get sticky so wax paper better layers or a piece of bread in the container (as mentioned by another rater) is helpful.

These are very moist cookie and when storing them I recommend putting a slice a bread with them to help control the stickness.  They are a great tasting cookie.  Yum!

If you like cake like cookies, these are great.  I changed the servings to 18 because I didn't want to waste 1/2 cup of pumpkin after opening a small can.  Love these and have been making for years!  I sometimes ice with peanut butter icing if I have time (i.e.  there are still some left when I get around to it!  LOL!)

This cookie is really tasty.  I changed a few things too, did 1/2 cup apple sauce (unsweetened), 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/3 cup white sugar.  I also added 1/2 tsp vanilla, extra spices, and dark chocolate chips.  Oh, and I did 1/2 whole wheat flour and a whole can of pumpkin.  It ended up making 27 cookies.

Awesome cookies!! I added 1/4 tsp. ground clove to kick up the spice and subbed white chocolate chips for the semi-sweet ones. Great flavor and cakey texture :)

Excellent moist cookie.  I like this recipe because it does not use shortening like most of the other recipes.  I did take some advice from other posts though.  I cut the cinnamon in half and added nutmeg, cloves, and ginger.  I also used whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cups pumpkin.  Delicious and healthy too!

This is a great use of extra pumpkin pie filling. the light chocolaty texture was exactly what i wanted. but i would add a pinch more of :  cinnamon and nutmeg [or cinnamon plus by pampered chef works and tastes great!] I made the cookies biger using just less than a 1/4 cup, and baked them for 13 min.

The cookies were good straight out of the over, but then turned gooey in about 2 days which was sad.

Can't taste the pumpkin, but cookie is good. Used 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup white. I don't like things overly sweet. I also added 1/2 tsp salt. Actually, I used raisins, rather than chocolate chips, because it's healthier & they add their own sweetness. But the pumpkin/raisin recipes all use butter, and I wanted an oil recipe. Very light and cakey cookies -- like little pillows. Baked at 350 for 10 minutes on GREASED sheet.

very good cookies! but they actually turned out to be almost like muffins in their consistency, but were still delicious!  I also used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar instead of all white.  And a full cup of sugar is probably not necessary.  Could cut back a bit and they would still be nice and sweet.

These were pretty good. I didn't have canned pumpkin so I used cooked and then mashed carrots. Subbed the oil and used applesauce.

I added a half cup of chunky peanut butter to the recipe.  The cookies turned out fluffy and moist- but I would recommend using more spice and more pumpkin.  All in all, I was pretty happy with the end results.

I altered and quadrupled this recipe by using 20 ounces of freshly processed butternut squash, 15 ounces of canned pumpkin, 1.5 cups white sugar, 1.5 cups Stevia, 1 cup brown sugar, 3 eggs, 4 tbsp half and half milk, 2 tbsp vanilla extract, 2 tbsp of baking powder, 2 tsp of baking soda, 1.5 cups oil,  1 tsp salt, 2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ground ginger, 1 tsp ground nutmeg, 7 cups of all purpose flour, 1 bag of Hershey's Special dark chocolate chips, and half a bag of Reese's Peanut Butter chips.  Mix wet ingredients and dry ingredients separately then mix them both together very well and baked at 375 degrees for 13 minutes.   Delicious!!!

These are so much better than the ones that you buy in the store! I would suggest putting not as many chocolate chocolate chips, that many are kind of overpowering. Excellent cookie!!

This is exactly what I think pumpkin chocolate chip cookies should be!  I did add a little extra cinnamon because of the other reviews, but I doubt that it mattered.  All you really want to taste is chocolate anyway! That was a perfect recipe.

These are the best cookies.  I bring a platter to my Dentist and his staff every year, and they love them.  Very easy to make.  The texture reminds me of marshmallows.

Very disappointed. I had high hopes for this, but they turned out to be very bland.

These are wonderful. I did use the whole can of pumpkin,  which is more than the recipe calls for, but I didn't have a use for the leftover pumpkin. These are soft, cake-like cookies. Yummy!

This is a favorite EVERY time, even for those who don't love pumpkin! I make these often (even out of season - who cares!). I use the whole can of pumpkin and skip the milk, then add 1/4 to 1/3 more flour to the batter. They bake up exactly as they are dropped (no spreading) so I can get 16-18 per cookie sheet with ease.  It's actually entertaining to watch people look them over (since they don't look like a typical chocolate chip cookie), tentatively taste one.... then grab 1-2 more right away! I like to make them heaping teaspoon-size so that there are 2-3 bites per cookie. This is by far my favorite (and favored) cookie in my recipe collection.

I used applesauce instead of oil, used extra nutmeg and doubled the recipe because everyone loves them.

Excellent cookie.  Not too sweet or overpowering.  Just right and I don't feel guilty having twice as much as a regular cookie.  It does need a little salt though other than that it is mine and my husband BEST cookie because it is not too sweet

I made these cookies and found them not to be too tasty.  In fact, if it wasn't for the taste of the chocolate chips, they would not be very appealing.

Delicious.  They turned out just right. The cookies are good hot cold or even room temperature. I thought they would end up soggy but no just nice with a chewy inside.

My four year old loves these cookies and my husband describes them as the softest chocolate chip cookie he's ever had.  I used home roasted pumpkin and they came out great, added a bit of flavor.

These were so bland. They need more pumpkin flavor and sugar and spices.

I doubled the recipe because I had so much pumpkin to use and I must have used a little more flour than necessary because mine were cakey, but still really good.  I used mini chips and only used half of what was called for and it was perfect.  They were also a HUGE hit with my 2 year old.
