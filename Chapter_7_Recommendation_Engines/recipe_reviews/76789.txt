Easy to prepare. Recipe would be improved by cutting the peanut butter by half (or changing to an unsweetened brand of peanut butter). Recipe as listed fills approximately 4 12" tortillas.

We make a version of this recipe all the time BUT we add zucchini instead of cauliflower, and definitely CRUNCHY peanut butter.  We tried it with creamy once, and it wasn't nearly as good. The only thing that takes a long time is chopping everything.

I added chicken, which was tasty, but there were not nearly 8 servings!  Also left the peanut butter out and just spread it on the tortillas before filling, because there was no liquid/oil left in the pan after cooking the veggies and I thought it might be too thick.

I used organic peanut butter instead of Jif, zucchini instead of cauliflower, and left out the scallions.  The sour cream was a dipping sauce.   It was good but needed a little more flavor.  Adding the scallions, extra peanut butter, salt, or crushed peanuts might work.  Next time, I would add mushrooms or bell pepper and NO onions.  Fresh broccoli is a MUST for this recipe.  Pita bread would work well, in lieu of tortillas.

I changed it a lot added chicken, more spices, didn't use jiff, etc. But it was a good starting point, and a yummy dinner.

Reasonably good, would make again. I might add more onions and a bit of something hot, for contrast.

This was fantastic!  As others have said, use 1/2 the amount of peanut butter.  I prefer natural, unsweetened peanut butter.  I also skipped the sour cream.

Added chicken, and did everything else according to the recipe.  I chopped everything with a hand chopper to speed up the process.  Crunchy peanut butter is definitely the way to go!!  Plan on making this a lot!

Great idea! Needs more curry powder and I had to add some water to the pot when the vegetables were cooking. But this opens up possibilities of adding other stuff like tofu etc

I would give this 3 stars based on taste.  It was just mediocre.  Not bad, just not super exciting.  However, I decided to bump it up to 4 stars based on it being so easy to make.  Just a little chopping of veggies, and the rest only took about 5 minutes.  As some other reviewers mentioned, I chose to use zucchini in place of cauliflower.  I like cauliflower, but the zucchini just seemed easier!

Absolutely delicious!! Easy to prepare and full of flavour.  This is one to play around with but a definite keeper.
