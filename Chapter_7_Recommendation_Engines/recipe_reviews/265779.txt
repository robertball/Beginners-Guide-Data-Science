This was very easy to make and quite refreshing. I followed the advice of a previous reviewer and only used about 2 tbsp of honey. All in all quite delicious. Especially since I don't have an ice cream maker

This is pretty good for a quick sorbet. I would definitely only add in the honey 1 tbsp at a time; because if your mangoes were really ripe when frozen, you may not need the full 1/4 cup. I also feel that this could use a little "zing" of some kind. Maybe a little lemon, lime, or pineapple juice would bring out the mango flavor a little more. Overall, not bad, and super quick to throw together. Thank you for the recipe!
