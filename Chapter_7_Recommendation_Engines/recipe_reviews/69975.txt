I thought the 15 cloves of garlic and 10 chilli peppers sounded kind of crazy- but it's actually genius!  The garlic isn't overpowering but the chili peppers definitely give it some kick! I tossed in some mushrooms and used udon instead of the noodles they recommend- I'd probably add more veggies if/when I make this again- but I really like veggies.  oh yeah- and I think it needs a bit more light soy sauce in addition to the black soy sauce.  Spicy, easy and yummy!

I had to make a few changes due to ingredient availability in my area. I went to two different Asian markets and neither of them knew what the Chinese yellow noodles were. They recommended a fresh chow mein noodle (yellow in color) that they sold in their freezer section. All I had to do was thaw them out and they worked nicely with this. Chinese mustard greens are also not available so I used Napa cabbage instead. This one has great flavor but not for the faint of heart. I recommend taking the seeds out of the peppers. I would make a few changes in the steps if I made this again but overall a great recipe.
