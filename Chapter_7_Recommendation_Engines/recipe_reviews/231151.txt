Wonderful flavors! I substituted raisins for the dried cranberries and used plain Greek yogurt instead of mayo. Also, I left out the salt and pepper. The sweetness of the fruit balanced the tuna and yogurt perfectly. This is my new tuna salad recipe of choice.

I've never been as big a fan of tuna salad as my husband, but I did enjoy this.  The cranberries and fresh apple provide just the right amount of sweetness.  I did miss the crunch of chopped celery, so I'll probably add a little next time, and 2 Tbsp of mayo was more than enough.  Had today for lunch using pita bread with some fruit on the side, but would be equally good on some spinach or lettuce.

I loved love loved this. I normally don't make tuna fish because it's boring to me. This was not. I did add about a tbsp of lemon juice, which have it a nice little bite. Delicious!

Great recipe!  Now I'm going to substitute Greek yogurt (my wife doesn't like mayo), take the hint from the photo with your recipe and serve slices of fresh fruit on the side (she loves avocado and papaya), and serve stuffed into 100% whole wheat pita, along with spinach leaves!  Thanks for sharing!

This was super easy and yummy. I doubled this recipe for my family of four. I chopped the spinach up and added it to the salad. I served it with flatbread but honestly it was yummy without bread.

This is soo good! I took the advice of another reviewer in effort to add more protein/health it up by substituting the mayo for Greek yogurt. I also used dried cherries instead of cranberries and added celery and put some provolone cheese on it. My boyfriend loved it. Made it the night before in bulk so it is quick easy protein filling to put in a whole wheat pita for a mid afternoon snack!

I helped a friend who hosts a local television show, and we decided to do a cooking demonstration for this particular recording. I made this salad, and after the recording was completed, we shared our salads with the studio crew.  Everyone LOVED this salad!!

Good recipe. Since my family's tastes are more spicy than sweet, I made a  spicy-sweet tuna salad. I added 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, raisins instead of cranberries, 1 whole chopped apple, 1 1/2 tbsp light mayo and 1/4 tsp raw honey. it was the perfect blend of sweet and spicy. YUM!

This was pretty good. Slight changes I made: used miracle whip instead of mayo, used 2 5oz cans of tuna, and added 1/4 tsp of garlic powder. My kids loved the sweet and crunchiness of the apples. Great simple recipe.

Really good.  I increased lite mayo to 1/4 cup, decreased craisins to 2 tbsp and added a squirt of fresh lemon juice.

It’s so nice to have a light tuna salad with lots of good crunchy bits. This is my go-to tuna salad now. Be forwarned it does not hold together like normal tuna salad, so will spill out of the bread. Make sure and serve it on a plate with a fork to pick up the fall-out.

Good recipe. I didn't add salt or pepper though. I think I'll add celery next time instead of green onions. I'll also do Greek yogurt instead of mayo. (I used Olive oil mayo this time which was slightly healthier than regular mayo.)

The apple and the cranberries help offset the fishy taste, for those who'd rather lighten the tuna flavor. I love tuna, but really enjoyed the sweet juicy addition of the fruits.

Easy and satisfying.

Great option when you don’t want the typical pickle relish version!!  I’ve done with dried raisin, cherries and cranberries (whatever was in the pantry). I add some celery and curry powder to round out the sweetness.

Made exactly as listed but added a sprinkling of roasted sunflower seeds and used raisins instead of dried cranberry because I had those on hand.  This was really good!  This will be a great addition to lunches.

Good recipe as is but I found the apples and cranberries made it too sweet for my taste.  The second time I made my own mayonnaise fron a recipe I found online, added chopped celery as suggested, and cut down on apples and cranberries .  Delicious!  I am now making it a third time and don't have any apples so we'll see....
