Halved this recipe because I only had 1 eggplant on hand. This turned out pretty good but I felt the sesame seeds were out of place and that it also needed some acidity. I added some lemon juice and that did the trick. Next time I will leave out the sesame seeds. Overall good recipe and one I would make again.
