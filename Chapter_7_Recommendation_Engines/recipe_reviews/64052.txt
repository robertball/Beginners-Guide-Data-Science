Surprisingly good!  I had fish sticks in the freezer I wanted to use in something new and different.  I couldn't get the green chili's but had jalapeno's and so I chopped about 2 T of them, and added about 2 T of the juice to the sauce and it really was great.  We will definitely be making these again.  Quick, Easy, Cheap, and GOOD!

I love Mexican food and this was the perfect way to change it up.  My husband and kids loved it, too.

I was really surprised!  Just the thought of "fish stick" enchiladas sounded gross, but I read the reviews and decided to try it.  Wow, wasn't expecting them to be that good!  My husband really likes them too, even though when I told him what I was making, he made a disgusted face.  :)

I didn't have all the ingredients, so I used this as inspiration. I used corn tortillas. I mixed the cream of mushroom soup with minced onion and a can of green chilies. I divided it evenly among ten tortillas. I put two fishsticks on each and sprinkled with cheese. Pour a little green enchilada sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 pan. Roll up each enchilada, put it in the pan with the seam side down. Pour the rest of the enchilada sauce. Bake as usual. Delicious! This is a great recipe with room for creativity.

This is a great recipe because it's fast and easy, and my husband couldn't wait for seconds (and I can't normally get him to eat fish, period).
