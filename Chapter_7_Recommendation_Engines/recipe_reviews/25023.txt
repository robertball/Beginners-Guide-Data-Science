This recipe is fantastic. We made these as bar cookies in a 9x11 and baked for 20 min. They were nice and gooey when warm and set up great once they cooled.

These are the best cookies! I looked all over for a recipe oatmeal cookies with cocoa, as I always have cocoa on hand, but not always chocolate chips. They are really moist and even without the chips, very chocolatey!

I've been looking for a variation on tired, old Tollhouse, but the man insists on chocolate chips! These are fantastic! Chewy and soft, even the next day. No hard cookies here! Very rich and chocolatey. The cinnamon complements the chocolate nicely, adding a unique flavor, and the cocoa powder makes them not just oatmeal cookies with chips in them. Double the recipe to make 72. Sounds like too many cookies, but who measures them out by the teaspoon?! Definitely glass of milk territory!

This was an almost unanimous 5-star recipe a year or so ago.  The recipe hasn't changed of course, so you've got to wonder what the newbies are doing.  I do use butter instead of margarine.  I must make them slightly larger than the recipe calls, because I end up with 24 cookies instead of 36 (but they still are somewhat on the small side).  I bake them for almost 15 minutes, enough for the bottoms of the cookies to barely turn brown.  They turn out perfect every time.  Not the least bit dry.

What can I say? I couldn't keep my fingers out of this dough!! I used reduced-fat butter and substitued unsweetened applesauce for half of it - I couldn't tell at ALL.  Scrumptious! Keep an eye out when they're in the oven though, I couldn't tell whether they were "brown" or not so I just took them out after 10 minutes, they didn't look done, but they were.

These cookies are the best!  My 4 year old daughter helped me make them, until it came time to put them on the cookie sheet- at that time she couldn't resst eating the cookie dough and was kicked out of the kitchen. :)  My husband said everything about this cookie was perfect and wanted this to be a regular in our house.  I used m&m's semisweet baking bits and the cookies really looked "cute" with them.  Like another reviewer said, you can't tell when these are browned.  I cooked them 10 minutes and when I took them out they were a bit mushy. However, after sitting for the recommended 5 minutes, they firmed up.  They are a soft, chocolately cookie and I love the oatmeal texture.  I didn't know about cinnamon and chocolate together, but the combination is wonderful!  Really great, easy recipe :)

Pretty good cookie but maybe a little too much chocolate. The oatmeal is way overpowered by it. Call these "Chocolate with some oatmeal for bulk cookies" and you won't be far off. Still all in all a decent cookie.

I am so glad I came upon this recipe! I am a WW member and have been searching for a delicious 1 point cookie! I took this recipe and turned it into a 1pointer...Here are the changes I made to make them 1 point each:  1/2 cup whole wheat flour + 1/2 cup AP flour, 1/3 cup sugar & 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup butter + 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/8 cup mini chocolate chips. My kids loved them, what else is there to say? :)

After reading many of the posts, I too, decided to make as a bar cookie and added the following raisins, dried cranberries, pecans, a teaspoon of molasses, a dash of pumpkin pie spice and a couple of Tbsp. of rice dream. I only used 2 Tbsp of cocoa, omitting the 3rd. Used a combo of light butter and margarine 3 to 1. Otherwise following the recipe as written. Baked in a 8 x 11 pyrex dish for @ 25-30 minutes at 350. They're moist and very flavorful and a great hit here! Yummy.

AWESOME..YUMMY..SPECTACULAR! Every one and I mean EVERYONE loves these cookies! I have to give them away because I end up eating all of them. :o( Try making them bite-size for a variation. They are fun to pop into your mouth..but dangerous because you eat so many  that way. LOL

Lovely, fudgey cookies.  I used raisins instead of chocolate chips.  I will make these again.  Husbie wasn't so crazy about them, but he doesn't care for oats or raisins.

Ok, Let me tell you..... this recipe is just an awesome recipe.  I was skeptical at first after I read a couple of the reviews but the other reviews made me reconsider.  I am so glad that I did. My teenage boys flipped for these cookies.  Now after 5 batches I think they are satisfied.  I can't imagine these cookies to be the least bit dry, if they were I can assure you they were over cooked.  That is the key to cookies, do not over cook them.  Hats off to the person who took the time to send in this recipe.

Scrumptious cookie!  I  love chocolate and I love oatmeal cookies, so I had to try this recipe.  Followed the recipe exactly & wouldn't change a thing.  Made these to take to a family luncheon and they were an absolute hit with both kids and adults.  :)  The subtle cinnamon flavor underneath the rich chocolate was well received by all!  Thank you for the recipe!

I was searching for cookie recipes that would ship well to send to my son who is currently stationed in Iraq. Not only did they arrive in one piece but they were a hit with my son and the rest of the airman. I did make a few changes. Used butter instead of the margarine, added some dried cranberries,chocolate chips,chopped pecans and a little coconut to keep them fresh. Of course I had to do a taste test before shipping and they were outrageously delicious. Thanks so much for the basis of a very good cookie. They are already asking for more.

These are great and easy.  I made them with the help of my two youngest daughters, 4 & 7, but all my girls liked them a lot.  The taste of chocolate and cinnamon is wonderful and we love anything with oatmeal!  I like that they are quickly and easily made with ingredients that I have on hand.

This recipe won me over by having "chocolate oatmeal" in the title.  It's such a great combination.  I actually replaced most of the white flour with whole wheat flour...and didn't use quite as much sugar (not a whole cup).  And wow, delicious!

Excellent cookies. I followed the recipe exactly but used butter rather than margarine. I used very good quality dark chocolate chips. The cookies stayed moist and chewy the next day.

I adore this recipe. I leave out the chocolate chips, but follow everything else exactly as it calls for. The cookies are delicious and hearty - exactly what an oatmeal cookie SHOULD be.

These are not bad.  I would cut back on the 
cinnamon next time.  I think the key to these little bad boys are almost under cooking them.  I stuck to 8 mins exactly and let them set up for a couple of mins on the cookie sheet before removing them to rack.  I got 3 doz plus 9 out of my batch and I added 1/4 cup chopped walnuts

Wow, I have been looking for a recipe like this for years!  I used butter instead of margarine, and whole wheat pastry flour instead of all-purpose.  For flavor I used 3 heaping tablespoons of cocoa, but chopped pecans instead of chocolate chips (my 2 year-old doesn't need the extra chocolate) and put the whole thing together with a toddler to help.  Fast, easy, and delicious.  Don't skip the cinnamon! YUMMY.  Next time I might add some flaked coconut!

these were really really good, the only thing i did different was not adding choc chips, i didnt have any, but they still have plently of chocolate flavour, my kids love em.  Also when i put them on the cookie sheet i rolled them into balls first, this way they look nice and round after they are done, 11 min was just about perfect for them in the oven. Thanks for the recipe!!!!

These we great!  I had to sneak the oatmeal in because no one over here like oatmeal cookies- but they loved these!  I added an additional 1/2 c of chocolate chips.  I also cooked them for an additional 2 min. Yummy perfect!

Mine turned out inbetween cakey and chewy.  If I make these cookies next time, I will try not to use baking powder to reduce the cakey texture.  I like this time's texture though.  For my taste, chocolate and cinnamon go well!  I used butter instead of margarine.  I used 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour and 1/2 cup of whole wheat, and put 1/4 cup of ground flaxseed in flour mixture just because for a little bit of nutrition.

What a delicious chocolatey cookie! Wanted a slightly healthier chocolate cookie so I wouldn't feel too badly about giving it to the family. Only change I will make is less salt, or use sweet butter. It was a little too salty for my taste.

Yum! I made them in my mixer and the oatmeal got a bit broken up (my butter could have been softer I guess, but in winter it's hard to do) I loved how they turned out! Crispy, chewy and then fudgy in the middle. I will be making these again!

This is an awesome chocolate cookie:  they really do satisfy a chocolate craving.  I used whole wheat pastry flour instead of all-purpose, and 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce in place of the margarine (DH won't allow margarine in the house).  I took the advice of TRIPLE_LATTE and baked them for exactly 10 minutes.  Although they seemed undercooked coming out of the oven - and even sitting for the prescribed 5 minutes -- once totally cooled they were perfect!  Thanks, Norcal, for a really great cookie!

These were pretty good. I used a little chili powder to go with the cinnamon and give them a little kick.  I enjoyed them but they definitely aren't the best recipe I've ever made.  Very easy though.

These were great and satisfied my chocolate craving without being totally unhealthy. I had to change the recipe slightly because I didn't have enough oats. I used about 1 cup oats and replaced the other 1/4 cup with finely chopped pecans. I also used whole wheat flour.

DELICIOUS!!  Follow exactly for excellent cookies that the entire family will enjoy. Not too chocolatey and just the right amount of oatmeal. Chewy and not crispy so it's just about perfect in my book!

These were really really good. Especially while still warm and gooey. I didn't have enough chocolate chips, so I used equal parts of chocolate, mint and white choc. chips, and the flavor was amazing. Loved them!! Will add to my file of delicious cookie recipes!!

These cookies are everything you are looking for in a cookie.   I made them exactly as written with the exception of adding chopped walnuts (a personal preference) and found them to have great chocolate taste and a wonderful chew.  The cinnamon gave just a hint of zip.   They were excellent and I will be making them again.  The next time I may replace the cinnamon with espresso powder to deepen the chocolate flavor.

These cookies are awesome! My mom had made the best chocolate oatmeal cookies when I was a kid, and I lost her recipe a few years ago, and have been looking for one like it since. I've tried several versions, but none were the same - until I found this one! The only thing I changed about this recipe is that I added a 1/2 tablespoon more of coca powder (I love chocolate).

Wonderful!  My hubby ate a half dozen of these cookies when they came out of the oven!  Soft, chewy, with just enough crisp around the edges.  I added a half cup of butterscotch chips as well.  Turned out really good!  I highly recommend this cookie recipe to any chocolate lovers out there.

We loved these cookies! I made a nutty version of them using leftover chopped walnuts & pecans, and substituted in 1/4 tsp of almond extract. I also used white and semisweet chocolate chips.  Special thanks to the reviewer who mentioned that they won't "look done" but they are.  Very true.

These are a perfect pick-me-up!  They're not too sweet or too rich, and they're just chocolatey enough.  I used toffee pieces instead of chocolate chips.

the only thing I added to this recipe was a teaspoon of instant coffee like a previous reviewer mentioned. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a T and  They turned out FABULOUS.  I will definitely be making these lovely cookies again!

These are different...I'm not sure how I feel about the cinnamon yet.  I def wouldn't leave it out, that's kind of the whole point of the recipe, but I'm just not sure if I LOVE it.  What I do love, is the texture of the cookie...nice and crisp, yet still chewy.  I made the recipe as is, except I used mini chips (had a bag open).  A nice change of pace.  This yielded 32 cookies for me.  *UPDATE*  I just ammended my rating from a 4 to a 5.  Why, you ask?  Because it's the next day and I CAN'T STOP eating them!  They have a great texture and I've decided I really like the hint of cinnamon.  These are great...now, put the cookies....down!!

Oh wow, these are good!  I used butter instead of margarine, left out the cinammon and used white chips instead of semi-sweet.  My only complaint is that they didn't make more!  (I got about 1 1/2 dozen smallish cookies).  I will make these again and again!

I just made these cookies and they are sooo good. I don't know what recipe some of the previous reviewers followed, but they are definitely not dry at all. Very moist and just the amount of chocolate. I used 'old-fashioned' oatmeal and butter instead of margarine. They seem to get better with cooling. Leave the cinnamon out if you don't care for the flavor, but it gives these cookies a unique flavor. I also made them a little bit bigger and they don't spread out so you can bake three across.

We really didn't like the combination of chocolate and cinnamon at all....for those that love chocolate and cinnamon together - you'll like this recipe. It's been suggested that you can leave out the cinnamon - but then it's a different recipe!!!! Sorry -  but won't make these again.

It's very chocolatey but tastes awesomew!! I used quick cooking oats instead. I found that the cookies didn't spread that much. I'll try using butter instead of margarine next time. I used an ice cream scoop for the first batch, didn't flatten much. it was rather thick. 2nd and 3rd batch were rolled into balls and then flatten. they were much better looking cookies. they are chewy and chocolatey. u can omit the chocolate chips. I reheated them the next day to make them crispy . I don't really like chewy ones.

These may be the best cookies I have every made. I followed the recipe exactly, and added trader joe's peanut butter chips instead of chocolate. The combination of the chocolate, cinnamon and salt was divine. Like other reviewers I baked them 10 minutes and then let them set on the cookie sheet. Even though they don't seem done at first, they are. Crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside, PERFECT!

5.22.13 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/25023/chocolate-oatmeal-cookies/ ... 'Haven't baked yet, but the dough is AMAZING!  It reminds me of the flavor my absolute favorite chocolate cake.  I'm letting sit in the fridge to plump/hide the oats from the kids.  Only using white sugar.  Other than that, no changes...These are really good. They are somewhat chewy brownielike. They aren't oatmeal cookies with chocolate though. They're chocolate cookies with oats & chocolate chips - which is much better. If you want the first, add chips to your oatmeal cookie recipe; but I'm sticking with this!  :D  I refrigd for a couple hours, but they still spread too much for me not to add more flour or oats or oat flour next time. 'Made large meatball size 2"?! 'Done in ten, but they had to sit 5 on the pan or you have to eat them all yourself since you won't be getting a whole cookie.  Oh, I only had 1/2c MINI chips. With their being small, there were enough to get in each cookie.  Last tray was smaller balls 1" or so.  'Took same amount of baking time, but less cooling time, maybe 3 minutes.  :?  :D  K didn't like the oats. They didn't get hidden too well since the cookies spread.

Yum, delicious, these are fantastic!! I did use butter instead of margerine but that's the only change.  Next time I'd like to add walnuts, because I love them in cookies, but the taste and texture of these are really good!

I was reading the reviews and looking at the recipe and I made just a few adjustments.  First, I made a double batch because they are going to a friend and his boss as a thank you gift.  I cut back on the sugar by 1/4 cup each. I used half dark cocoa powder and half regular cocoa powder.  I omitted the chocolate chips.  I also added some fresh ground nutmeg, a dash of allspice, and 1/4 tsp allspice.  These are AMAZING!  They would be amazing as written - very sweet but amazing. I adjusted it to suit my taste. Cayenne always kicks up a wonderful floral flavor in chocolate.  I definitely suggest you try it!

A dough that is easy to work with. A cake like chocolate, cinnamon, and sweet cookie. I used white chocolate chips for contrast.

I made these into bars with just 2T of the cocoa. They were very dry and bland. I won't be making these again...sorry.

Oh my gosh these are wonderful! I did add a tablespoon of water and 1/4 teaspoon of chili powder after reading the reviews. I also baked them for 8 minutes then left them on the cookie sheet to cool for 2-3 minutes. We tend to like chewy cookies over a crisp one. I could see how adding a little coffee instead of the chili or dried cherries would also be good. Very nummy!

Very good if you want a chocolate cinnamon fix!  Easy to make.  Used the mixer to mix everything and about 1 T less butter than it said to.  Also added about 1T of water.  YUM

These cookies are chocolatey excellent!!  I used a small ice cream scooper to drop onto a baking sheet and increased the baking time to 16 mins.,  but the scooper decreased the serving size from 36 to 16. But the cookies were 3" round sized.  You will love these cookies!!!

Next time I will try adding more oatmeal since I love the oatmeal flavor and texture.

Made them with Michigan dried cherries and chocolate chips--I am not particularly a cherry fan but my husband is.  I am a chocolate fan, however and these are VERY good.  Will make with chocolate chips later just for me :-)

Fantastic cookie, and somewhat healthy thanks to the fiber in rolled oats & cocoa powder.  I did substitute butter for margarine and I left out the cinnamon.  They're messy for kids to eat thanks to the gooey chocolate chips--will leave them out next time (the chocolate chips, not the kids).

Very good cookie. The cinnamon is very subtle, in my opinion.  Next time, I'll add more. I got 6.5 dz out of a double batch.  Followed the recipe. I really whipped the butter/egg mixture well before adding the dry ingredients. I took approx. tablespoons full of dough in my palm, rolled and flattened it a bit, and placed it on the pan.  10 mins was perfect in my oven.

Yummy cookie! I was kind of weirded out by the cinnamon and chocolate combo, but it turned out to be a nice flavoring. Didn't have chocolate chips but did have some white chocolate that I melted and drizzled over the tops.

Great recipe (I didn't change anything other than using quick oats and milk chocolate chips). I think the cinnamon added a nice complexity to the flavor. I made only 13 cookies with the full recipe since we like larger cookies. :) For the first batch I rounded the dough into balls and they were nice and thick, I flattened the second batch and think I prefer the balled cookies since they have such a nice moist center. They were very fudgy in the middle. I really enjoyed these. And they definitely go great with a glass of milk!

I made these cookies without the egg and mixed in some flax meal and soy milk instead. I also didn't have brown sugar, so I used regular white sugar and a bit of molasses. I rolled the cookies into a ball and rolled them in some powdered sugar, came out so pretty!

These were my first try on oatmeal cookies. Great first try!! Folks thought it was a very professional snack. For myself, I'm thinking about cutting the oatmeal to just 1 cup. But all in all, wonderful! Cheers!

these are by far THE BEST! I was looking for something with chocolate and oatmeal and came across these. They are fantastic! My daughter helped me make them but I had to walk away from the cookie dough because I could not stop eating it!!!! Thanks for this recipe, I will make it over and over again!

I had a hard time stopping myself from eating all the dough! I even convinced myself these were healthy because I used whole wheat pastry flour, and of course they have oatmeal in them. The dough is at least as good as the baked cookies.

These cookies hit the spot.  I wanted something fast and delicious.  I left out the chocolate chips, and used an olive oil based butter spread instead of margarine or real butter to cut calories, and add even more of a healthy twist.  Thanks a million for the recipe!

Wow.  I'm sure it's amazing as written, but I subed out half the butter for apple sauce and flax seed, used dried cherries instead of raisins and still included some chocolate chips because you can never have too much chocolate. I had to brush my teeth to stop myself from eating them.

After reading the reviews, I opted to make these into cookie bars, and was glad I did!  I served them warm for company with vanilla ice cream and hot sauce over the top.  They were a hit.  My son is not a big sweet eater, but he told me how great they were.  Plus, a pan is so much quicker and easier than cookies!  I'll keep this one!

There are so good and addicting!  I ate 5 the day I made them. My husband really liked them as well.  I followed the recipe as written and wouldn't change a thing except to possibly cut down on the salt next time.  They kind of tasted a litte salty.

I really didn't care for these at all. I substituted raisins for chocolate chips. I was hoping for a chocolate covered raisin taste, and there just wasn't enough chocolate. 

I guess they really do need the chocolate chips. I didn't care much for the cookie's flavor itself.

Delicious!  And so quick and easy to make.  A nice blend of flavors although I may add just a pinch more cinnamon, I didn't think it was overly noticeable.  I used a small ice cream scoop and got just shy of 3 dozen.  I used butter in place of margarine and the cookies spread out just right, not too thin at all!

Ridiculously delicious, especially when just slightly underbaked.  I used a generous 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips (as suggested by another reviewer) so as not to disturb the chewy oatmeal texture. Wow, are these good.

I tried this recipe two times now and both times they turned out not as chewy as i had hoped...my cookies turned out on the harder side but were still very tasty.  My children love them and i will make them again.  thanx for sharing this recipe with all of us.

These came out awesome. I wanted my kids to have some nuts for protein so I made the following changes:
Added 1/4 cup super fine almond flour and 1 tbsp maple syrup.
Omitted white sugar and used 1cup light brown sugar total.
Flattened the dough by placing a piece of wax paper and lightly pressing the dough scoop before baking and added MnMs on top.
They came out crispy on the edges and chewy on the inside.

These cookies were a big hit. I used a bit less sugar (third of a cup each kind rather than a half) and raisins rather than chocolate chips.  The result was a delicious crisp outside moist inside cookie.

I changed the recipe a bit, added about 1/4 cup extra oats, 1/4 C almonds, a couple tablespoons of ground flax, and omitted the white sugar altogether. 
With the addition of all that dry I had to add an additional egg but they were fabulous. Cutting the sugar put the sweetness right where I wanted it.

Outstanding recipe.  I needed a chocolate vegan gluten free recipe.  This one was easy to adapt.  I used oat flour and egg replacer.

Made exactly as the recipe was written, and they're simple, delicious and I love that it's a small-batch recipe, so there's not a ton of leftovers that the sort-of-dieting husband can be tempted by. Next time I'll add chopped pecans.

I used cinnamon cocoa powder instead of the regular kind, and only used one egg as a reviewer suggested. The cookies are very quick to mix up, but very sticky right then. I popped them into the fridge for a couple of hours, and they were perfect at 10 minutes: crisp and yet chewy.

Used cake flour so didn't add baking soda. Replaced white sugar with brown sugar completely, but turned to be still too sweet. Next time will reduce sugar by 1/4. But overall excellent recipe!

I've made these probably 30 times. They are definitely our favorite cookies. I always substitute Reese's Peanut Butter Chips for the chocolate chips and add about 2x as much as it calls for. They are sooooo good!

These are by far the families favourite cookies. I make them a little healthier by using whole grain spelt flour and adding ground flax. I also sub the vanilla for peppermint essence for a mint choc chip cookie.

This recipe is pretty good. The only thing is that when next time I do it, I'll use less sugar, as even though I'm a big sweet eater, this turned out to be too sweet for me. Good about the recipe is that it stays moist inside after cooking and at the same time has a nice firm top.

I made this recipe exactly as written (with the exception of using unsalted butter instead of margarine.)  Oh my goodness, they are wonderful.  I found I needed to bake them 12 minutes instead of 8-10.  Definitely allow them to cool 5 minutes on the sheet before removing them to a cooling rack.  This is a recipe I plan to make again and again.

The cookies baked well and tasted great.  After reading other review, I limed the cocoa to about 2-1/4 tablespoons of cocoa.  That gave the cookies a deep chocolaty taste without being overbearing.  I'm glad I didn't add any more.
     I baked the cookies on parchment paper.  They didn't spread and the finished cookies lifted off easily.  This recipe is a keeper, and a good alternative to the toll house chocolate chip cookies.

Sorry, but I didn't find these cookies exceptional. I thought the flavors were muddled and the cookies a little boring. They went fast, but so would animal crackers in my household. If you're going to make cookies from scratch, these won't be WOW cookies unless you do a lot of doctoring. If you don't have the time for that, move on.

These were good, chewy and chocolatey. Bit too sweet. Wish had used only 1/4 cup white sugar.  I used butter instead of margarine. Also had to add a bit of milk as the dough turned out v. dry.

I had high hopes for these since I love oats, cocoa and cinnamon, but they fell short of my expectations. I found them to be dry and kind of bland surprisingly. They do also seem to taste a little sodaey.

Delicious! Made these with chocolate chips and between my three roommates and I and all our friends they were gone in just over a day! Going to try making them with dried cranberries next time!

I made these cookies because I promised my toddlers we'd make cookies today, but after promising, I relized I only had one cup of flour.This recipe only calls for one, so we were able to make some. I would probably not make these again they just were not that great, though they served their purpose so I did not have to break my word.

these are fantastic! I love the depth that the cinnamon adds to these cookies, and how they're not just a chocolate chip cookie with oatmeal added to them. Will def make again!! however, I only got 32 cookies instead of 36, and I would recommend making them cookie shaped because my just kinda stayed in dough balls (which was really good, I smashed down the second tray and that worked well)

I saw the picture and was VERY excited to try this recipe!  However, the amount of oatmeal called for did make the dough and therefore the cookie.  I only cooked them for 9 min in my oven.  They are not as moist or as sweet as I expected them to be.  Sorry, maybe I was expecting them to be different.

Made exactly as written. Texture is great, the taste is ok but a little bland. Did not find them at all "rich and chocolatey" as other reviews state. I'll probably try again but add more coco and choc chips

The only alteration I made was to add 1/2 tsp almond extract and used butter instead of margarine, and that was nice.  When I first mixed the dough it was extremely stiff and I didn't have a lot of hope for it.  I had to knead it to get the oats all incorporated.  I must say, though, that it's a tasty cookie and not at all hard.  They are crumbly and I might do something different if I make them again to get a more soft, tender texture.  Adding 2T of milk or perhaps cutting back a little on the flour might help.  The dryness is the only reason I'm giving them a four, though, because they taste very good.

This chocolate cookie is awesome!  I made them into bars, and cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup for brown & white sugars like other reviewers suggested. I also added in some flax meal and used spelt flour instead of regular flour. And a combination of black onyx cocoa and regular cocoa powder. Super yummy, will try with coconut and double the recipe next time.

Crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside.  I used butter and freshly milled whole wheat flour. Did not use chocolate chips since I didn't have any.  Will make again!

I was disappointed with these. I thought they were a tad dry and bitter from too much cocoa. My kids liked them, but I'm not sure if I they are worth trying again when there are so many good cookie recipes out there.

I wanted to make these a week ahead of time, so extended the cooking time by 5 minutes to prevent them going soft in the container. We prefer a crisper texture. Added a teaspoon of instant coffee in preference to cinnamon. A great success!

These cookies are awesome!  They disappear almost as fast as I can take them out of the oven.  This recipe works well with the allergen substitutions I have to make (no nuts, dairy, soy, eggs).  I substituted the egg with Ener-g Egg replacer, replaced the margarine with Spectrum shortening, and used allergen free chocolate chips.  I used less oats and did have to add some liquid because the dough was quite dry.  They are very chocolaty but as a chocoholic family that's OK.  This is an awesome new cookie for my food allergic son to enjoy.. with the changes of course.

I did not care for this. I had to mix in the oatmeal and chocolate chips with my hands because it was so dry and stiff. The cinnamon gives it a weird flavor. I bake cookies frequently and would not recommend these at all. Sad I decided to try something new, very disappointing.

Sorry folks, this recipe was nothing special. In fact, I'd have to say I followed the recipe to a tee, and they turned out very dry and tasteless. Even a big glass of milk wouldn't help these puppies.

Very nice! My son loves this cookie! I add one more egg and sometimes more oats just to make it healthier as he is a picky eater! he still loves it! I add butter instead of oil with a little bit of milk; it turns out moist! A keeper!

These were the first chocolate oatmeal cookies I have ever tasted.  I'm not so crazy about the oatmeal in them, but they are good and chocolatey enough.  If I make them again, I will make them as a bar cookie.  This recipe only made 24 cookies for me, which was just enough, but I think most families would need to double the recipe.

The are my new favorite cookie -- they are simply awesome!!! I did omit the cinnamon (I didn't think it would go well with chocolate - my personal preference) and also used mini chocolate chips. I also added a bit more cocoa. YUM!!!

This is a GREAT and more healthful cookie recipe! I add cinnamon, as it's so nice with oatmeal and the richness of the chocolate. I do use butter instead of margarine, and dark chocolate chips (just b/c these items are a little healthier), but it's a perfect recipe :) A standard in my house.

One of the best cookies to ever touch my mouth! Use real butter, it's worth it here.

I didn't find this recipe by searching for cookies - it was on the main AR page under Newest Photos. They looked yummy so I thought I'd give them a try. Wow.   An easy recipe using a few basic ingredients, this one is a keeper. My dough turned out a bit on the dry side after everything was mixed but that was my fault - I eyeballed the measurements for everything. Had I accurately measured the ingredients, I'm sure my dough would've been less dry. Still though, the addition of a tiny bit of water corrected my mistake.  These cookies turned out amazing: chewy and chocolatey. I'd likely add a little more cinnamon next time, and try it with chocolate chips (I didn't have these so just used cocoa). I also have a sneaking suspicion that a little bit of coconut in this mix would be really nice, as would be raisins (which was listed as optional here). When I make this dough again (soon!!) I'll have to experiment with a few cookies.  Thanks for posting this. What an excellent recipe.

Pretty good, although I prefer a richer chocolate flavor. My husband, who is a HUGE cookie fan, thought they tasted like gingerbread (bc of the cinnamon I'm guessing) I appreciate the low(ish) butter content (no margarine please!) and oatmeal for added fiber & protein. Per usual I substituted in Splenda brown sugar. Will probably make these again, but NOT in the midst of a chocolate craving =)

Good.  I rolled them in a mixture of cinnamon, powdered sugar, and chocolate and underbaked them a little so they were nice and soft.

Very delish.  I altered them and used 3/4 c oatmeal and 1/2 c coconut...a great addition.  I also used part mini chocolate chips and part white chocolate chips...I wouldn't use the white chocolate next time but I might try them with peanut butter chips.

really good cookies, they didn't last in my house, but there were 2 left the next day and they were still moist and chewy. I also added 1/4 cup each of wheat germ and ground flax.

I was surprised by how good these were. I made pretty big modifications-- halved the sugar, liquid egg white instead of the egg, a yogurt butter substitute, skipped the chocolate chips-- and they still came out amazing! They were low cal to begin with, and I imagine that my modifications probably knocked off even more.   Fantastic recipe, thanks!

These cookies are absolutely delicious! I used Hershey's Special Dark chocolate cocoa, used butter instead of margarine and I didn't add chocolate chips and I will definitely make these again. Can't wait to try them with coconut!

Dangerously good cookies!  I just made these into cookie bars, and they cut beautifully after cooling.  I used butter because I didn't have margarine."These are probably the best cookies ever!" said one cookie eater... and I bake LOTS of cookies. YUM!!!

These are great! Followed the recipe exactly and came out splendidly.  Then, the second time I happened to have half of a bag of coconut in the cupboard, so I did coconut instead of oatmeal.  DELICIOUS!  Have to cook 2 minutes longer, but came out so chocolatey and chewy, sort of like a macaroon but cakier.

Cinnamon, chocolate and oats are my oldest daughter's 3 favourite food groups, so these were perfect for her. As usual when I make an oatmeal cookie, I was really pleased with how well they held their shape. These didn't last very long at all. Many Thanks for a great recipe.

I felt compelled to submit comment for the 1st time. I have tried many chocolate cookie recipes over the years in hopes of finding one that reminded me of the ones my grandma used to make sometimes. Plus I have been having a cookie craving since yesterday. This one not only nailed it, but was even dare I say better with the extra goodies added.  I didn't have chocolate chips, so I added chopped almonds and real butter instead. So yummy & beautiful the way they crackle on top, my husband said. Also had to bake mine 5 min longer, maybe it's my oven.

Excellent cookies! I substituted cinnamon chips in place of the chocolate chips just to give it an extra cinnamon kick and it worked out really well. I'll try it again sometime with the chocolate chips. The dough is thick and a wooden spoon doesn't really let you mix the oats and chips evenly so to really mix this well kneed the dough with your hands just before spooning onto the cookie sheet.

This recipe has quickly become a household (and "neighborhood") favorite among friends and family. And, in fact, is the #1 request for cookies in my house.
The only modification I make is to substitute 1/2 the chocolate chips for peanut butter chips.
Excellent!

Ok, so I have to admit that this recipe has been "haunting" me for months....I was too scared of the cinnamon, BUT  I finally broke down and tried them and LOVE this recipe!  Thanks to lovestohost for giving me the nudge (several nudges, actually) to try these! Now, I wish I had doubled the recipe!!!  The only change I made was leaving out the chocolate chips & they were still plenty chocolatey.  So, if you have been afraid of the cinnamon---Don't be...it is not overpowering at all and adds a nice little "something" to these!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

These are my favorite cookies I have ever made and everyone who has tasted them loves them! The cinnamon really adds a lot without being overpowering. I leave the chocolate chips out just because I am not a fan and thought it sounded like a little too much chocolate. It is a very very stiff dough, so make sure your mixer is up to it. Otherwise, pure heaven!

I used butter, because I never bake with margarine.  I like the cinnamon and the cookies have a nice chocolate flavor.  I wish they looked as good as they taste.  I have always thought cocoa gives the finished product less of a sheen than chocolate would.   I tried to make them small enough to get the full 36, but only got 33.

These biscuits are great.  They are crunchy on the outside and chewy in the middle.  The kids were eating them as they were coming out of the oven and I had to shoo them away!

Rated by my 9 year old: YUMMY! These are the best. We didn't have chocolate chips or raisins. They are warm & chocolatey! Mom's note: Accidently forgot the baking pwdr in the first batch but they turned out! Family really enjoyed, thanks! PS Did not add the cinnamon as I thought that would be a weird addition.

Great recipe, add extra chocolate chips and be careful not to burn them as they don't look cooked after 10 min but they are.
A really great cookie recipe.

I think minus the cinnamon these would have been a five star for me.  I made for a group of people who also agreed that the cinnamon was a bit much and they would have loved them without it. The texture and chocolate taste were perfect.  The only subs for me were I doubled the recipe(which gave me a batch of 40 cookies-don't know about the 36 cookies without doubling-must be the size of nickels..LOL) and used butter(didn't have margarine) and instead of equal brown and white sugar..I gave more to the brown and skimped on the white by 1/4 cup.  I am going right now to make again with maybe just a speck of cinnamon or none at all.

I didn't have chocolate chips and I used special dark cocoa and quick oats.  These are amazing!  I accidentally used 1 tsp of baking soda and left out the baking powder but was pleasantly surprised that aside from flatter cookies than the picture they still tasted wonderful!  Can't wait to see how the texture and taste is if I actually make them right next time, if they are this good with my error. Don't know how many cookies it made because I could not stop eating the batter and the cookies as soon as they came out of the oven. YUMMY :)

FABULOUS! I love the hint of cinnamon. My son and I made these with quick oats and white chocolate chips. Used a tbsp to measure out dough and made 32. Yummy. Thanks for the recipe!!

RIDICULOUSLY DELICIOUS.  This is such a great recipe not just for it's flavor but because of the ingredients.  My 2 1/2 yr old is allergic to dairy so it's so gratifying to find a cookie recipe that she can make with me and enjoy eating.  We eliminated the choc chips and replaced with raisins (awesome) and substituted the margarine for SOY margarine.  Since the recipe calls for margarine rather than butter, the substitution does not greatly alter the taste.  Really wonderful.  We enjoyed making and eating them all!

I have to say that after reading all of the great reviews, I was somewhat disappointed. The cookies were good, but I only ended up with 28 small sized cookies. I even added both raisins and chocolate chips. I think that there needs to be more butter or something like that, something that would add to the batter. It just seemed as if something was missing. The taste was good, although my husband does not prefer them.

Very yummy! I didn't have chocolate chips, other than that I followed the recipe exactly. They have the texture of a cakey cookie, and just enough chocolate flavour. The cinnamon wasn't overpowering at all so don't be afraid to add it.

This recipe was great.  I did use butter instead of margarine and tried to up the health factor by using half all-purpose flour and half whole wheat flour.  I had to add in a little more butter to offset (1.5 T) the dryness - but these were great cookies that I will make again!  Also added white chocolate chips.

I doubled the recipe and then placed half the cookies in the oven and then added cocoa powder to the other half. I got two different batches of oatmeal cookies at one time! Worked out great, and very tasty.

Perfect!  Cookies are my specialty, and I loved making these.  I only had a cup of oats left and they were still perfect.  I used 1 cup chocolate chips.. because I can never get enough!  I'll be making these again and again!

I made this recipe twice, both times with great success. I can't imagine them being too dry. One tasty suggestion, add 2 cups of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the 1/2 cup to make them really deliciously chocolatey!!

This is a wonderful recipe. It's very chocolately. Really, how can anything made with cocoa not be great! I made this using half semisweet chocolate chips and half white chocolate chips. It makes it look a bit different, but it's a nice variation.

Really good! I didn’t add raisins or chocolate chips and they still baked up great in 8 minutes. I did chill the dough for ~20 minutes. I had some leftover cream cheese icing to use up so I made chocolate oatmeal creme pies. Thanks for the recipe!

Made these without the chocolate chips, and added 1/2tsp espresso powder because I like it to boost chocolate flavor. They were chewy and delicious and I will definitely be making them again. Next time I”ll try adding the chocolate chips, I didn’t have any today. I expect they are completely over the top with that addition!

I added 1/2 c raisins & 1/2 c walnuts and left out chocolate chips. Also increased the cocoa to 4T.  Used 1 heaping T for each cookie and baked 10 min. Yum!

These are the best chocolate oatmeal cookies I have ever made.  I added 1/2 cup sliced almonds because I love nuts and they turned out perfect.  Deep rich chocolate flavor with the texture of oatmeal.  Yum

These were great! I loved the little kick of cinnamon. I baked them on a baking stone so had to bake them about 15 minutes instead of what was recommended.

Wonderful recipe.  I made 24 cookies on 2 sheets worked out perfectly following the recipe - cooked 8 minutes exactly and rested 5 minutes none broke.  Taste is great. The only change was since I don’t have margarine, I used 1/4 cup butter with 1/4 cup shortening. Just chewy enough. Thanks for sharing

I put in the exact amount of sugar in the recipe, and I thought it was too sweet. I would recommend putting in less sugar than called for. Other than that, it was delicious!

My son’s new favorite! I made it two ways. First, I made it exactly according to the recipe- with butter bc I don’t have margarine. So good! However, my son loves anything with chocolate and peanut butter so the second time, I used peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips. Huge hit. Now, this is the only cookie he asks for when he comes home from college. This is a winner. Note- store them in a cookie tin with a slice of bread to keep them soft for longer. Yummy!

My new favorite!  Love the cinnamon notes with the chocolate.  I made it exactly as the recipe is written, except I used butter because we don't use margarine.  So good.  I might try adding peanut butter to it one of these days.

I doubled the recipe. Instead of doubling the butter I used 1/2 c butter and 1/2 canned pumpkin. I also altered the oatmeal to 2 cups and used 1/2 c of flax, chia, coconut fiber blend for added nutrients. I had some caramel bits and pecans on hand so I threw those in too about 1/2 c each.  They came out soft and fluffy and kid approved. I will Definately keep this recipe close.

Wow!  What a great, soft cookie!  Living at a higher altitude, I left out 1/4 cut oatmeal.  Then I excluded the chocolate chips.  Otherwise, made it the same as the recipe.  Absolutely stunning!

these are so good and bake up beautifully.  10 min in my oven was perfect.  I used butter in place of margarine, as I never use margarine when baking. They are crispy on the outside, and soft chewy/fudgy on the inside.  I used a combination of white, butterscotch, and chocolate chips.  I did double the batch, and you might want to also if you are making these for a crowd.  The proportions as written are fine for a quick cookie to have for a snack in home, or to give away to someone as a gift but they are sure to be a crowd-pleaser so you may want to double the recipe.

Will totally make it again! I doubled it and used shortening and 1 tsp of butter flavoring, since I didn't want to buy margarine for just this recipe.  Also added 1 TBL Cocoa. Ended up cooking for 14 minutes. Otherwise as written.  Really great soft texture, just don't try to take them off the sheets without letting them sit for 5 min or so, otherwise they are too soft.  Next time I'll add nuts.  Would be really awesome with dried cherries too, as a riff on a Black Forest cake.

I love these! Usually the only changes I make are the chocolate chips. I use about 1/3 cup white and dark chips and then use butterscotch chips for the rest. I find they really give the cookie a good chocolate balance. Great recipe!

These are my favorite, especially warm and gooey.  They also freeze well.  As others have said, be careful not to overbake.  I've been taking them out as soon as they lose their shine and don't look wet anymore.

I gave this recipe 5 stars because these cookies are a great twist on the traditional oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. I added about 1/2 c. more oats than the recipe called for so ended up adding in roughly 1/4 c. unsweetened apple sauce to get the right consistency. This really helped to play up the cinnamon in the recipe making it taste more like an apple cinnamon chocolate oatmeal chocolate chip cookie - YUM! My friends devoured these cookies and a few requested the recipe. Thanks for the recipe and happy baking!

I tweaked it a bit to suit my taste. Added 1/4 cup more butter, 1/4 cup more oatmeal and instead just used 3/4 cup of white sugar. Plus white chocolate chip cookies for aesthetics haha! But anyway this is a beautiful base recipe. Will definitely make it again!

Soo good! I made the following changes and they were amazing! I used 1/4 white sugar, 1/4 margarine and 1/4 apple sauce, doubled the cinnamon and half the chocolate chips and they are gooey, chocolatey and delicious!

They are baking as we speak! I used 1/4 c. agave instead of the white sugar and 3/4c. oatmeal... I wanted the rich chocolate taste! So far they look great and chewy! I made about 20 cookies instead of the recommended 36? Also, they needed to cook closer to 12 minutes because I live in a higher altitude. Great recipe though!

I was not sure if I would like this recipe, and I'm not sure why I thought that, but I absolutely loved it. It's a hearty chewy cookie with a rich flavor and just enough chocolate and sweetness. My 6 year old loves it too and I thought for sure she would reject it because of the cinnamon. She's a bit picky. But I will definitely keep it to make again!

This turned out great!  It was so good!  I really liked the softness of the cookies.  They were soft, but not chewy.  I may add more chocolate chips next time, and I also think that this recipe would be great with pretty much anything (peanut butter, mint, coconut.)  I ate a ton of the dough, but what made it through the oven was just as good!

I'm giving this a high rating, because I finally found  a recipe that works really well with Egg Replacer!!!!  My husband took one bite and looked at me and said this is really good X2!!  I know its a winner.  Although instead of 1 egg replacer I added 2 Egg replacer to this recipe.  so it would equal 2 eggs.

These cookies were great! I just put a little less chocolate in though so they weren't too overpowered and it turned out perfectly. One thing to note though is that the 3 dozen recipe actually only makes closer to one dozen, at the most…. haha

Really good!  I  used Truvia in place of white sugar, and that dropped a few more calories. I also used raisins.  Hubby, who is a big lover of oatmeal raisin cookies says this is a keeper. I liked the photo where someone flattened the cookies with a fork, think I'll do that next time too.

I love this recipe!  I always halve the shortening and sub 1/4 cup shaved coconut for the last 1/4 cup of oatmeal. I refrigerate and roll them into balls before smashing by about half on the baking sheet. They come out perfect!

I suspect these cookies rely heavily on the chocolate chips for flavor. I didn't have any and made them without and they were very bland. The cocoa turns them brown but doesn't add much flavor, the cinnamon is more of an aroma than flavor, and they look nothing like the cookies pictured, more like overcooked sausage patties. I'll be trying another recipe next time.

I loved this cookie!  The cinnamon, salt, chocolate and don't leave out the oatmeal (which I rough ground in food processor) and I made bars instead of drop cookies.  They really were a great, unique flavor combo though!  And chewy!

First I made a single batch and baked as cookies; they were good, but a little dry.  They didn't spread hardly at all.  The next day I made a double batch of dough and baked in a greased 13x9 pan for 25 - 30 minutes.  These turned out more moist and chewy;  I think these are better as bars.

AWESOME COOKIES!!! The first time I made these cookies I made them per the original recipe.  They were good but not great. The second time I read a few more reviews and followed the directions as per Leah Joy, 1/2 AP flour, 1/2 whole wheat flour. I subsituted 1/2 the butter with unsweetened applesauce and used less sugar.  THEY ARE PHENOMENAL!!  Crispy on the edges but still delightfully chewy.  The flavor was only enhanced, they are sooo chocolately!  Thank you Leah Joy.  I am a diabetic and every little bit helps.

My daughter and I made these cookies together. I am guilty of subbing butter for margarine. It's just a personal preference. They were delish. DO NOT COOK THEM OVER 10 MINUTES. They will burn. After 10 minutes of cooking the bottom was browned but not burned. Any longer and they would have been toast. Update: 8 minutes is PERFECT! This recipe is a keeper. I can't wait to try it again with the addition of raisins or peanut butter chips.

The kids should definitely enjoy these. My cookies didn't flatten the way others had, but they still taste yummy. I made the following changes based on doubling the batch: 1/4 salt, 1/2c butter, 1/2c apple sauce, 2c golden sugar vs white & brown combo, and added 1/4c wheat germ. Made small cookies and baked for 8mins.

I didn't think the cinnamon went well with the chocolate. I left the batter in the fridge for a bit to keep it firm, but it still ended up too thin. I think it needed some more flour.  I only used 2 tablespoons of the cocoa. I think it would have been too much with all three.

I have used this recipe three times now.  They absolutely come out great every time.  I omit the chocolate and add 1.5 cups of raisins.  They are quick and easy to make!

I LOVE this recipe. The absolute only thing I change is leaving out the cinnamon (not a fan). Every time I make these cookies everyone raves about them. Even "I do not like oatmeal cookies" types love these. I have made them twice in the past week for two different office parties.

They come together quick with mostly ingredients you'd have on hand anyway. I like to mix together with my hands once I add the oats and chocolate chips. You definitely need two cookie sheets, these make a lot of cookies. Don't worry when you take them out that they seem all goopy and fall-aparty, they set up very nicely after about 15 minutes.

Great! I was torn between making oatmeal raisin cookies and chocolate cake and this hit the spot perfectly! Only complaint is that I doubled the recipe and got about 36 cookies? It might be that I just make them larger than I should so I'm chalking this up to an ID10T Error. ;D

Great chewy cookie! I add a splash of milk while i'm adding the flour mixture and we skip the cinnamon. I doubled this recipe and still only got 4 dozen cookie. I guess I'll triple the recipe next time.

I don't usually makes subs in recipes but tried it this time with success.  I used half butter and half applesauce along with half white and half wheat...all to make the cookies a bit healthier.  They were great...a little crunch like an oatmeal cookie but a bit moist from the applesauce.  Yummy!

I make these with coconut oil (around 1/3 cup is still enough if you want to cut it back) and they are PHENOMENAL. They might just be my favourite cookie. They remind me of brownies but have the earthy chewiness of an oatmeal cookie, and the cinnamon is that little something extra. I leave out the chocolate chips and some of the sugar for my own good because I cannot stop eating them!

These were the best.  I did add add half cup whole wheat flour and half cup white flour, rather than the 1 whole cup of white flour.  I also cut back on the sugar by a quarter cup.  They ended up perfect.  I had to make another batch.  :)

These are wonderful. I have put white chocolate chips, toffee bits, and dried cranberries in them too. I like to grind up candied pecan as a little secret ingredient .

These cookies were pretty good. I ended up adding 1 cup of chocolate morals instead of the chips. One thing I'm curious about is chopped nuts in it next time.

I have found our new favorite cookie, ever. The only change I made to the recipe was to add 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. I followed everything else exactly. The cookie comes out with a tiny crunch on the outside with a soft middle.  The flavor is fantastic.  Best cookie ever. I made the fist batch 5 days ago, they lasted 4 days. Just two off us. I just finished making another batch.

GREAT COOKIE.!! i doubled the recipe because these freeze really well. i altered the recipe for what was available in my kitchen. i used butter instead of margarine, i used 1/4 cup LESS white sugar and oats. i also used walnuts instead of choclate chips and added a 1/2 cup MORE walnuts. plus i added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg (because i believe it compliment cinnamon & oats very well.

Since good brain foods include oatmeal an dark chocolate/cocoa, I decided to find a chocolate oatmeal cookie recipe. This one hits the spot! I did however make some changes to the recipe so I did get a technically different cookie. I used wheat flour instead of all-purpose and I subsituted avocado(another good brain food) for the margarine. Also, for all of the cocoa and chocolate chips I used dark! I recently had a concussion, so I wanted some comfort food as well as semi-healthy and good for the brain. They came out crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, definitely a good treat!

These are simple, delicious, and crowd pleasers for sure!  I love the combo of cinnamon with the chocolate so I doubled the cinnamon and loved the extra kick!  Thanks!

Great recipe! I made it tonight and my mom loves the recipe, along with other members of my family. The cookie dough is really good, too! If you don't have unsweetened cocoa powder use one ounce of baking chocolate, melted, and decrease the margarine by a tablespoon.

AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS! These were so chewy and moist! I didn't ave chocolate chips on hand, so I just omitted them. But I followed the recipe just as it's written otherwise. The only thing I wish I had done was double this recipe! They were so good we ate them all right up! I could not stop eating them! The cinnamon adds that extra tasty flavor that made these cookies irresistible!

These are great! I got a little funky and used white chocolate chips instead of the unsweetened chocolate. It's perfect! I read on the reviews that some thought the cookies were overwhelmingly chocolatey and this white chocolate chips seem to do the trick.

I've made these cookies a ton of times since I first stumbled on this recipe on here. My family absolutely loves them and so do I. I knew I would, because I love cinnamon and chocolate together, but my kids and their friends have been even more enthusiastic. The only change I make is to use butter instead of margarine because I don't buy margarine.

This is a great recipe. I don't like cinnamon, and I used dark chocolate instead, and the cookies are wonderful. I hope that my husband starts eating these, or else things could get dangerous with an entire batch in front of me!

YUM. I followed the recipe, except I split the cup of flour into half all purpose and half whole wheat, and I used dark cocoa powder instead of regular chocolate. Very chocolatey, therefore an A in my book!

I added an additional tsp. of vanilla and used 3/4 c. white flour and 1/4 c. whole wheat. I had no problems with dryness as others noted. My family INHALED these cookies-- I've never seen a batch disappear so fast.

Odd recipe... the dough was very dry and when they baked, they didn't flatten out, they just stayed in round little balls. HOWEVER - biting into one was pure heaven! Really delicious. I will try again and maybe add another egg to the ingredients.

Made this tonight and loved them.  The touch of cinnamon is why I gave this 5 stars.  It compliments the chocolate in such a nice way.  Makes them taste of Christmas. I made them exactly as stated with no changes at all. Thank you for recipe!

FANTASTIC!!! This chocolate lover (and my husband) absolutely loved these.  I had Hershey's dark cocoa and it was delectable. It's thick and delicious and chocolately and the oatmeal adds a great texture. You've got to double the recipe. It's honestly in the top 3 best doughs i've ever tasted. i made the first batch as the recipe said - wonderful. in two days, i had to make another batch BUT was out of oatmeal. i added in chopped walnuts and peanut butter chips.... GREAT!!

I found I had to add another egg to the batter; even before I added the oats, it seemed like the batter was too dry. Something's missing, I don't know what... After reading other reviewers' comments, I omitted the chocolate chips and instead added a handful of raisins. Maybe I'll dust with icing sugar.

These are delicious. The cinnamon adds a really lovely flavour to what could be an ordinary biscuit. Great texture with the oats. I have had to hide them from my 4 year old (and my husband...)!!

OK, here's the deal--I tried one as soon as I took it out of the oven.  I'd have to say, that based on the great reviews, I was slightly disappointed, tastewise.  BUT, the next morning, these were AMAZING!  The taste had developed overnight, and I now see why they have such high marks!  I used "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" (as I always do with baking).  I also suggest upping the 1/2 c. of chocolate chips to maybe 3/4 c.  AND DON'T FORGET THE CINNAMON!

Awesome! I substituted half of the margarine with applesauce and loved it. I used raisins and craisins instead of chocolate chips, and 3 1/2 TB of dark chocolate cocoa powder. A great cookie from which to get your chocolate fix, all while telling yourself it's healthy. ;)

These are great! I didn't change a thing. I think they would be good with half peanut butter chips and half chocolate chips or some chopped up peanut butter cups. I think they tasted better after sitting for awhile. I can't wait to make some again. I think I'm adding these with my other holiday treats. Thanks for sharing!

Many people in my life are addicted to the chocolate chip cookies I make, and they're good, but I still wanted to find a cookie I was truly addicted to! These cookies are absolutely wonderful. I bake cookies regularly, and can usually resist eating multiples as soon as they come out of the oven, but these cookies are addictive! I did make a few changes because of my preferences, but definitely not because I had doubts about the original cookie recipe! 

I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup unsweetened apple sauce, used 1 1/4 teaspoons of cinnamon, added a package of instant chocolate pudding mix, and added 1/2 cup of raisins in addition to the chocolate chips. 

These cookies turned out chewy, cinnamony, chocolatey and absolutely delicious! Some people may have reservations about cinnamon and chocolate together but give it a try! The combination is unexpected but delicious. These cookies taste incredibly comforting, like an old family recipe, but also gourmet!

These are so fantastic, and never last long in my house. And they are sneaky healthy, since I use only wheat flour. They DEFINITELY curb my chocolate craving. Just don't eat with the container near you...it's hard to stop!
**Edit**
I made these with a twist last night...omitted the vanilla and cinnamon, and used 3/4 tsp. mint extract. I didn't feel like scooping them out into cookies, so poured the batter into a greased 9x9 baking pan and baked 25-30 minutes. They made 9 wonderful bars--it was like eating 3 cookies at once, which is FINE by me :). Next time I'll up the mint to 1 tsp., but they were very tasty as well. It's a fun recipe to play with.

For the vegans out there, here's what I did (and correct me if I'm wrong w/ any of the ingredients):
Vegan butter spread
EnerG egg substitute
Still very good but oddly salty? Usually I omit salt completely from cookie recipes but this time I didn't and I wish I would have. The cookies didn't spread out at all, which is fine, but you can put them close together on the cookie sheet. Good stuff!!!

These are sooooo good! I added 1/2 cup of nuts which only made them better.  Instead of greasing the pan, I used parchment paper.  This kept the bottoms from being greasy. I am making my second batch today.  I may try 1/2 cup peanut butter in these. Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

This is a very good cookie, reminded me of the no bake chocolate pb oatmeal cookies!

I didnt have any choco chips so I used M&Ms instead and they turned out great. A little dry and crumbly the next day but still very tasty!

Very nice! Love that these take nly 1 stick of butter VS the 2 sticks in many oatmeal cookies.  The chocolate flavor really comes through, even without the choc. chips ( I subbed raisins).

These were absolutely FANTASTIC!!! My little siblings kept going back for seconds! The texture is extremely chewy, and when you split them when they come out of the oven, the chocolate chips ooze  just like the commercials! And just the right amount of cinnamon!

I didn't have any chocolate chips so I added walnuts.  They were really good and I'm sure they would have been fantastic with chocolate chips - I will definitely include those next time :).  Thanks for the recipe!

These are VERY, VERY good!  I used softened butter instead of margarine, otherwise I followed the recipe exact.  My 3 children loved these cookies and are begging for more.  I was skeptical of the cinnamon but it was excellent flavor!!

These came out quite well, but I find the cinnamon overpowering, and I don't think it's a good combination. My fault for adding the cinnamon anyway!

These cookies were good but not great. They got hard pretty quickly, so don't make these if you like chewy cookies.

The cookies practically beg for a glass of milk, but the texture is too brownie-like for my tastes. Still a wonderful recipe.
I used butter instead of margarine  and got a nicely shaped cookie. Enjoy~

I baked these for 8 min. and found the cookies to be quite dry.  They tasted all right although the amount of cocoa used doesn't give an intensely chocolate flavor.

I have lots of oats and looked for a good cookie recipe but found this one to be a bit dry. The chocolate flavor was good but they weren't moist at all. I shared them with friends who just said the cookies were "ok".
