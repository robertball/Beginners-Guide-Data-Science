Oh my GOD!  This is so excellent, I cannot even tell you!  I knew it would be good (anything with a whole block of Velveeta Cheese is bound to be good!) but I made this for a Christmas get-together, and my guests couldn't leave it alone.  Everyone ate so much of it that we had to postpone dinner!  The recipe makes quite a bit, so if you're only making it for a few people, you might want to pare it down a bit.  I added a can of crab meat that I had in the cupboard, and it couldn't have been better!  You can really play with the ingredients, add more green onion, other seafood, or whatever you want.  This dip cannot be beat if you are a seafood lover!

This recipe was awesome!!  I served it for a Mardi Gras party.  Instead of 1 lb of cheese I added 2 lbs. And I also added shrimp and crab and served it in bread bowls.  It was completely gone by the end of the night!!

I did love the taste of this dip. I served it with frito scoops. It had very good flavor. Only problem I had was that it wasn't a very thick dip. It was runny and it spilled on everyones shirts. Also this recipe makes a lot. I cut the recipe in half and still had some leftover after serving 20 people. But I would make it again this time less milk and more cheese I guess.

I made this recipe, but with a new twist.  I added twice the Velveeta, half a pound more crawfish,cut the crawfish into thirds so that it went further, and then stuffed it into hollowed out pistolettes.  I then slathered the pistolettes with butter and baked at 350 until lightly browned.  Absolutely fabulous!!  This can be served as a appetizer, side bread, or even a main dish!  Definitely a crowd pleaser!

I first had this at a restaurant & didn't even want the food i ordered, i wanted more dip. I am going to try using Shrimp next time & think that will be even better. I last made this on Christmas & everyone in the house loved it. I don't use the Hot Sauce..

I was expecting hunks of crawfish but this pretty much became  smooth cheese dip with crawfish flavor (no hunks of meat, all the crawfish cooked down).  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't great.  I may make again, but I would throw the crawfish in last so it would say chunky.  I also used 2x the cheese like a lot of reviewers.  SIDENOTE: although it didn't go over so well at a party, we have found what we had leftover was very tasty slathered over a piece of salmon :)

I added a can of  Ro-Tel with green chillies. I also doubled the flour and cut the butter down  to half a cup. It was a big hit at card night .
