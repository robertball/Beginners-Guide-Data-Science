This recipe turned my non fish hubby into a fish guy!  I followed the marinade and the dressing recipe to the tee...  I made a garden salad with capers, bacon, Parmesan cheese and boiled eggs along with the veges!  The dressing was the star of the show!  I didn't have sushi grade tuna... but had tuna steaks... I just cooked them to med rare and they were perfect!  Restaurant quality... Sure to impress at your next dinner party!

I only made the fish and sauce and served over rice instead of making the salad. I liked it but hubby LOVED it. I did double the jalapeno (personal preference), and subbed onion for shallot.

Simply yummy. The flavor is amazing!  I barely seared the tuna. I used sushi grade. My whole family loved it. Definitely a keeper. Thanks Ryan.

OMG, this is the best salad recipe ever. The dressing is mouth-wateringly delicious. I served the veggies on garden salad greens and topped it with sockeye salmon (cooked on the bbq) instead of tuna. I included young garden potatoes in with the carrots, beans and cherry tomatoes and I served garden cucumber slices on the side. I will definitely be making this one again and again.

The vinaigrette was delicious, and went great with the tuna.  I wasn't fond of the chervil, my wife however, loved it.

We absolutely loved this.  My 5 & 6 year old said they didn't care for the dressing, but the 2 year old, 10 yr old, & 11 year old ate it up! As did my husband and I.  Thank you for sharing.
