Very good! I'm not a fan of fennel seed so I didn't use Italian Sausage-I used a beer brat and removed the casing- Just our preference. I also used chicken broth instead of water. Everyone loved it! Even my little one! Great recipe! Thanks for sharing! Will make this one again!

This came out kind of dry and I could not taste the pumpkin. I'd use more pumpkin puree next time.

Used 8 oz regular mushrooms and ground venison Italian sausage instead of sweet link. Liked by all, should have made a double batch!

This was  delicious;  I subbed greek yogurt got the heavy cream and it came out fine.  I do think it was  a bit too much pasta for the sauce, but that may be my own preference

I love this dish. So do my children and my husband. I make it differently, but the gist is the same. I use heavy cream and no mushrooms:). Just 1/2 cup to make it creamier and a cup of dry white wine (reduced to half) enhances flavors.

I made my own breakfast sausage with ground pork instead of using Italian sausage.  This turned out great - I have SO MUCH frozen pumpkin pur√©e and this is a tasty way to use it up.
