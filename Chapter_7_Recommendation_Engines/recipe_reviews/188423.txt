These are great. They're not supposed to be particularly crispy, but in order to insure maximum crispiness: Skip the water soaking step. That's to keep them from turning grey, which, after you add all the red stuff--they won't look grey. So skip that. I reduced my amount of oil and V-8 (spicy variety) til the total amount for this recipe was 1/3c. of liquid (not 1/2 c. as recipe would have it). Spray your pan with Pam, and spray the tops of your taters with Pam--both times. Don't skip the step where you flip them, that is ESSENTIAL in oven fries. You haven't got to flip them precisely, but you DO need to move them around on the sheet, or else they'll cook unevenly and any shot you had at crispness is gone. I also reduced the cayenne pepper and left out the salt (the V-8 has plenty for me.) Thanks for a keeper!

These knocked our socks off!  I changed the method a little, but not the ingredients, due to lack of time.  I skipped the 10 min water soak (which would remove some surface starch) and then put them in my convection/microwave oven on fast bake.  After ~15 minutes, I put them under the broiler to brown them up... for about 5 minutes, then stirred them up (they weren't in a single layer cause there were too many for the pan) and broiled 5 minutes longer.  They never got crispy, which is not a big surprise with a liquid seasoning, but they were HUGE on flavor and DH commented several times: "wow, these fries are killer!!" I served them with the Green Chili Chicken Sandwiches from this site and it was a fine meal!  Next time, I will make them the long way to compare results.  Thanks for a great recipe! UPDATE: Since the fries never got crisp, even under the broiler, I decided to try something different: I mixed up the dry ingredients, deep fried the potatoes (twice to make them crisp) and then sprinkled the dry ingredients over the potatoes and mixed to distribute the spices evenly.  With a 1/4 C. oil added to the original mixture, I can't imagine that frying them would use much more, if any, than that.  My deep fryer is very good and the oil is 375* which allows little oil to be absorbed or cling to the fries.  We liked this version even better.

I followed the recipe closely and was surprised at how these turned out.  Usually fries in the oven are too mushy for me, so I cut the potatoes very thin (about 1/4" thick strips) and they crisped up very nicely.  Also add 1 tsp. of paprika to the mix and it will really help tie in all the flavors.  Great submission.

These were good waaaay salty better to put less and add more in the end if needed. They were not crispy so I increased the oven temp to 450 until they crisped up....

My husband loves this!!! He's a potato lover and these hit the spot for him!! I did not however have chili powder so I used paprika and no veg juice so i got half of a small can of tomato sauce and added a bit of water to it. I greased my sheet with Pam and increased the oven temp to 400F and they were SCRUMPTIOUS!!

I only give this 3 stars because they came out mushy and squishy on the inside. The seasoning was yummy though! I have made other baked fries before, and reccomend baking them at a higher temp and for a shorter period of time, so the outside is crispy and the inside is fluffy.

Very nice.  I halved the salt and did 3/4 less cayenne--I don't do that spicy!  I baked at 400 but they still didn't crisp up.  I broiled for about 5 min to crisp them up a little, which worked a bit.  Still, nice and spicy and awesome flavor, so worth the effort to see if a higher temp might work to crisp them.  Thanks for the recipe!

I liked the way these tasted but have to work on getting the crisp just right. I think the temp needs to be higher so I'll try that but the taste is good.

These fries were a big hit. They are packed with flavor. I did as another reviewer suggested and fried them in a deep fryer. I whisked together the oil, spicy vegetable juice and about 3/4 of the spice mix and let them sit for about 10 minutes. I fried the potatoes in 350 degree oil. At 375 degrees they browned too quickly before the inside was done. Then I sprinkled the remaining spice mix onto the fries after I drained them. I added a bit more salt. Fantastic. Thanks for the post.

OK, but I baked at 425. If I do these again, I'll reduce the cayenne pepper because you can't taste anything else. Different.

These were great fries for sure!! I made them a few months ago and have been looking forward to having them again. They are scary looking after you get all the spices on them though. The smell of the spices about worried me. I wasnt sure I was gonna be able to eat them. They were great! I used a different base instead of the tomato juice. I replaced it with Frank's Red Hot sauce. I also cooked them a little longer than what the directions say to.

I took this recipe to another level; I used sweet potatoes! EXCELLENT!  The marinade is very yummy, and I'm looking for other applications for this marinade.  Next time I might use Snap-E-Tom for the juice.

I used 11 red potatoes. It was an hour before they got crispy (if they even did get satisfactorily crispy), but maybe my slices were a little big.

I thought they were tasty!!! Although I had no veg. juice cocktail so I used about 1/4 cup of tomato sauce. ( one of those super small cans they sell and then just freeze the rest for next time! )  Would be a good aptz for a tail gait party!

The seasoning on these fries are really great! I didnt soak the potatoes because I didnt have tomato juice. Nonetheless, my fries were still good. I am used to baking fries on 425...higher the heat, the more crunch, which is what we like. So I baked for close to an hour on 425. We had Tex-Mex Burgers with Cajun Mayo here from AR. Great college game day food!

These are a huge hit in my house!  I make skinny fries, don't soak and put the oven to 400 degrees.  Other than that I follow directions and ingredients.

We used my spiral slicer and made these into curly fries! They were pretty thin, so we ended cooking them only about half as long.

making them crispy--i disagree with the person who says not to soak. we make oven fries frequently and the soaking helps tremendously.  the key is to get them COMPLETEY DRY, not just patting dry.  parchment paper helps, too, as does higher oven temps.  using less liquid in the recipe helped for me--i just used 1T olive oil with the tomato juice (blood mary mix is AWESOME INSTEAD!!!) and it worked much better when i tried it this way than the 1/4 cup oil.

Great recipe.  I like very crispy fries so I took the advice of some of the people who posted and deep fried the french fries about 10-12 minutes then sprinkled on the spicy powder mixture right after pulling out of the fryer.   Thanks for this great idea!

Great recipe! I didn't have the vegetable juice so I used ketchup. Worked out great. I like my fries crunchy so I baked at 425 degrees F for 20 mins.

Very good recipe. We especially enjoyed the spiciness. We doubled the ingredients due to extra potatoes and it worked great. Although they were very good, they would maybe be a little better if you were to add some nacho cheese. Other than this minor detail, they were very good. All in all, if you like to live on the edge, try these Spicy Chili French Fries.

These were very tasty, though my family loves spicy food, so I upped the cayenne and chili powder, and also threw a little bit of Red Rooster Hot Sauce and chili paste. Gives it a flavorful spiciness to it, rather than just heat. Great recipe!

Awesome.  We were afraid they would be too spicy, but they were perfectly seasoned.

I cheated a bit and used frozen steak fries.  I had to bake for much longer, not sure if it was because the fries were store bought, because it sounds like others were having probs with the fresh potatoes not getting crisp enough with the given temp and time.  Also, I cut the cayenne in half and we LOVE spicy, but a whole teaspoon is a ton.  Also, I skipped the salt.  1 Tbls seems high at any rate.

After reading reviews,  I decrease the amount of liquid being used but kept the powder ingredients the same.  It was a little spicy for some of the guests. It did have great flavor and I will try again with modifying the spice level.

I made this for the first at my mom's house, to go along with our fried catfish. We fried ours instead of baking them. I know it's not as health, but we were already heating up fresh grease for the catfish, so we fried our potatoes first. I found it best to fry them half way then drain and cool on drip pan, then drop in hot grease again and finish cooking them. Makes them nice and crispy. It turned out perfect and all my family loved them.

I didn't care mush for the water, because they were a little mushy.  I have heard that most of the nutrients in the potatoe, is in the skin.  So I tried another batch leaving the skin on, but washing very thoroughly and left the water out and they turned out a lot better.

i loved these, I actually like my fries to be mushy or soft BUT if you want them crispier don't use as much olive oil and tomato juice but you will have to flip them more
often

These were wonderful. Quite possibly the best home made fries I've made. I did cook them a little longer than called for so they would crisp up a little. Definitely a recipe I'll use for something different over and over.

I just tried this recipe and it was very good except for the fact that they are believably spicy, and I love spicy food and usually don't have a problem with cayenne pepper, but with this recipe I strongly recommend using a 1/4 a teaspoon of cayenne pepper! Other than that they were excellent. ;)

Everyone raved about these fries! I skipped soaking in water to make them a bit more crispy. Great side.

These were really good and easy to make! I didn't have tomato juice so I used barbeque sauce and only used a teaspoon of salt and no dried onion.
