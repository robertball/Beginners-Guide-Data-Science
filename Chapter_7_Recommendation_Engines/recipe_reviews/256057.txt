Began eating plant based meals only this past September.  Found this recipe and it is a hit among my meat eater husband and son. It is an easy go to dinner, that makes a lot and everyone enjoys. I add salsa Verde to the top of each bowl, kicks it up a notch.

I made this tonight and it was really good.  I used Rotel tomatoes as mentioned by some others.  We only had a 1/2 c of farro, so I added about a half cup of quinoa about 10 minutes after the farro was cooking.  I added a little more corn and some edemame.  My husband and I both liked it and will make it again.

Very delicious and satisfying!  I used 2 full zucchini, 2 ears of corn and a full red bell pepper. Everything else exactly as the recipe suggests. It’s my first week on a plant based diet and I’ve already made this recipe twice.

Great recipe. Like the addition of the Rotel. I also added a splash of lime juice at the end. It seems the brighten the taste and goes well with the Cilantro

This was easy and even my husband, who is a true meat and potatoes guy, loved it!  He did add some parmesan cheese to the top :)

Delicious and simple.  I added black pepper and chickpeas. Very customizable. This will be part of our regular rotation.

This was great. We sliced up some chicken sausage and threw it in the mix but this dish would have definitely still been great without it. I'm putting this in my things to bring to a potluck rotation too. Will make again.

Great recipe, thank you!  I didn't have green pepper or corn in the house, so I added a can of rinsed chick peas.  I also used the Rotelle fire roasted tomatoes with green chiles which added good flavor.

This was quite tasty. We aren’t vegetarian, and I had a turkey smoked sausage in the fridge, so I chunked it up and sautéed it with the veggies. Also, before sautéing the veggies, I tossed them with olive oil, the cumin, salt, and a few dashes of Penney’s Mural of Flavor in a separate bowl. I also only added the fresh corn to the sautéing veggies in the last minute so that it was still crisp. Even without the sausage, this would be a great vegetarian dish. Definitely going into our regular rotation. Yum!

We all really liked this recipe. I've made it twice, once with added queso fresco and once with a sunny-side egg on top. Very good.

This was shockingly good.  I'd never had farro or anything like it and was honestly afraid it would ruin the delicious vegetable blend.  I loved the chewiness of the farro and each bite of zucchini or fire roasted tomato was the perfect flavor pop.  While I love spicy dishes with complex flavors this dish shines by allowing you to really taste each individual ingredient.  A new favorite for us!

Delicious! I only used 1 cup of farro and used a red pepper instead of green. This will be part of my regular rotation. A hearty, meatless meal that satisfies. Leftovers are great.

This was my first try at farro and it came out fantastic.  I am not a fan of green peppers so I substituted a red one.  The farro was perfectly aldente.  This will become a regular in my meal rotation for sure.  It was a hit with everyone in the house, even the non-zucchini lover!
