The flavour of this compote is outstanding  but the recipe should indicate the number of cups, not stalks, of rhubarb. I made this exactly as written and 10 stalks yielded just under two cups, I think that there should be at least four cups. It didn't thicken and was very sweet, not tart. I checked this at 15 minutes and the texture was perfect for us. This is a keeper and definitely something that i will make again, thanks for sharing.
