I usually just throw most of these same ingredients together and end up with the same thing - nice to have actual measurements though.  I used the same seafoods listed except the mussels (personal preference).

This was a great quick recipe.I halved it since it was just for two people and we still had a bowl leftover. The only thing I would do to improve it would be to add some tomato sauce since it was a bit thin.I served it with a fresh garden salad and garlic cheese bread.Tasty dinner!

Nice taste very flavorful. Wish it was a little thicker. Added salt for intense taste. Red pepper flakes have nice heat.

Easy to follow recipe. I put all the liquids, tomato and spices to simmer for an hour prior to adding the seafood. It developed deeper flavors . I used canned clams because there no fresh clams at the seafood market. Great meal, will make again!

I agree with another reviewer.. 4 or so tablespoons of tomato paste, black pepper and salt livens up the flavor a bit. It is a wonderful recipe as is, but some of us like a richer broth that the tomato paste brings.  I used fire roasted tomatoes which also added a nice depth to it. Wonderful when served with some crusty buttered bread.

My family loved this! Substituted frozen mussels in wine sauce for fresh and used canned clams. I put all the seafood into a shallow pan (including juices), added 1 T butter, 1 tsp crab boil and 1 T chicken broth; simmered until juices reduced by 2/3 and added to the rest of the ingredients. Great low fat dinner!!!!
