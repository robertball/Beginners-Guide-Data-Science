I made these last night for a cookie tray. They smelled wonderful as they were baking. I doubled the nutmeg to give them a little more flavor. As is I would give the recipe 3 stars but I added a eggnog frosting to help them taste like eggnog (not just a sugar cookie) which bumped them up to 4 stars. Eggnog Frosting: 1/2 cup butter (beat until fluffly) beat with 3 c. powdered sugar add 1/2 tsp. brandy extract and 4 TBSP. eggnog beat an additional 2 min. I added a few drops of yellow food coloring to the frosting to give it the look of eggnog. Overall the cookie was good but don't expect amazing.

I made a couple batches of these last Christmas and people really loved them! I plan to make them again this year however I double the nutmeg and sprinkle extra nutmeg on when I bake them - makes for a more "eggnogy" flavor...otherwise they taste a little like plain (but good) sugar cookies.

I was looking for a different kind of cookie to make this Christmas and I saw this recipe and thought I'd give it a try. I had my toughest critic taste it my husband and he loved them. I thought they were easy to make and taste great. Leslie73

YUM!!! We made this tonight and will be making at least two more batches for various family functions - I know the first one isn't going to make it until next week! These are tasty but very plain looking. After the first sheet full I sprinkled nutmeg over the tops - it really helps both the appearance and flavor. If you don't want to sprinkle more on top then double the amt of nutmeg to get that eggnog flavor. My son loves eggnog and he fell in love with these cookies! One note - my batter was really sticky even after being refrigerated for quite a long time. It was humid here though so it could have used some extra flour. I really liked them as well - of course I like eggnog but I also don't like super sweet cookies - these are more rich than sweet which is just fine with me! To bake them we used parchment paper over cookie sheets - I'd doubt these cookies will easily come off much of anything else! Just the nature of the cooky. They did just great with no problems on burning or sticking. Thanks for sharing a tasty recipe!

This recipe won the annual Christmas Cookie Contest at my mom's house last year. I made them on foil and peeled the foil off and they came off great. I also drizzled white chocolate across the top to add a little pizzaz. This dough is very versitile since you can made the base without the nutmeg and then divide it into three bowls add nutmeg to one for eggnog cookies white chocolate chips to another and molasses and ginger/cinnamon to another and get three different kinds of cookies from one mixing of dough. If you beat the dough a long time the cookies turn out nice and chewey. If they are too flat for you just add a little more flour to the recipe. I always bake a test batch before I put the flour in the fridge for any reason. This is a great recipe!

I rarely add salt to dishes like this. So I just didn't add the salt. The butter has some in it after all. And it wasn't needed. They were still wonderful and tasty without the salt. I liked how soft and almost cake like the cookie can be. They plump up beautifully. It's definitly a keeper. I found however the cookie was too sweet! Some said rich but I found it was sweet. I'll be cutting the 2 cups of sugar to 1 1/2 cups next time and hope that's enough of a reduction. After reading the recipe was kind of bland in terms of seasonings I spiced it up adding 1 tsp Cinnamon 1/4 Allspice 1/4 tsp Ginger 1/2 tsp Cloves in addition to the 1/2 tsp Nutmeg since this is how I spice my eggnog drink. It seemed logical to me to season eggnog cookies the same way. The spicing was good and I will keep the measurements as is. Makes for a spicy cookie but not too spicy (at least not for me). I used rum extract in my frosting instead of vanilla. I really liked that addition. Though I haven't figured out exactly how much extract to use to make sure it's enough but not overpowering. I'm still playing with that. Perhaps when I figure out how much I like I'll update this message.:) Thanks for the recipe!

I was kind of disappointed in these after so many reviews. Even with doubling the nutmeg as others did and adding 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and a couple dashes of clove I found them kind of bland. Also they did not spread as much as I expected causing the midde to not be done when the edges were getting crisp. I gave this 4 stars because I added some pumpkin pie spice to the last couple dozen and some chopped pecans I had on hand and wanted to get rid of- then I smooshed them down a little so they would be flatter. After doing this they were absolutely delicious. Also yield I got was over 5 dozen...Recommended with adjustments.

These cookies were easy to make and I could taste the eggnog flavor but they reminded me of vanilla wafers. There was nothing to draw your attention to them on a platter of cookies. They were very plain looking and rather non-descript. I will pass on making them again.

I liked these as did my husband (who is not a fan of egg-nogg). Per posted reviews I both increased the nutmeg in the recipe and sprinkled the tops of the cookies. I also added about 1/2 tsp cloves. It took me a batch or two to nail down when to take them out (on stone cookie sheet they took considerably longer suggested). Make them small - they spread quite a bit.

sooo good. A nice twist on the simple sugar cookie. I doubled the vanilla extract and rolled the drops of dough in a sugar/nutmeg mixture before baking which gave them a festive sparkly sheen. I think they taste adaquetely eggnog-y although I'm sure the addition of rum extract other reviewers have used would really make these outstanding. I just didn't feel like buying something that'd sit in my spice cabinet for 10 years!

These were not as spicy as I had hoped for so I did add another tsp of nutmeg and 1tsp of a cinnamon/ginger blend. They baked up nice and soft reminded me more of a snickerdoodle.

I loved these cookies. Eggnog is my husband's favorite so I tried this recipe and I myself could not stop at just one. They are great with vanilla ice cream.

I made a few changes - doubled the nutmeg and added eggnog icing that another reviewer posted. Without these changes the cookies were fairly plain and only a 3-star. However this is the 3rd year I've made them and with these changes my husband loves them!

These cookies were easy to make. My toddler helped! They also tasted very much like eggnog. YUM! They could use something decorative... to make them look more festive but other than that they are a wonderful holiday treat. I will be making these again. (I added a bit more vanilla to my batch)

I thought these cookies were really good and they are somthing different than the original Christmas cookies. some people loved them. others not so good. You have to like eggnog to like these. Thanks for the great recipe I will be making more this Christmas. I refrigerate mine for about an hour or so before baking them.

It wasn't a bad recipe but it was kind of plain. I think some eggnog or rum icing might have spiced it up a bit.

I loved these! I made them exactly as the recipe called for except I replaced the vanilla extract with rum extract which I really think helped give them that eggnog flavor. I also used fresh nutmeg. Overall I got many compliments on the flavor of these cookies. Be careful when baking because they bake up really quickly and you want to take them out of the oven when they are barely golden on the bottom and edges in order to retain their soft texture.

they need one less egg and maybe use a rum extract or more spices to follow up on more flavor. unless you choose to decorate with some kind of flavored frosting the cookies themselves are kind of eggy. maybe my eggs were to large. a nice simple cookie but the flavor does lack.

Very bland sorry. I even upped the vanilla and nutmeg. They are very light and fluffy though. They need frosting or something else to spice them up!

These cookies always bake up great but can be a bit bland on their own. Top with eggnog icing (from the Eggnog Cupcakes recipe also on this site)--- the icing really makes them!! A couple of notes: Double the nutmeg and definitely use parchment.

These cookies were a hit at my Christmas party. I had to play with the mixture by adding more flour as the batter was runny. I also looked up an egg nog frosting that really made these cookies stand out and brought out the egg nog flavor. After frosting I sprinkled the top with nutmeg to give some extra flavor. Will definitely make these again!

These turned out very good but I made a few modifications. I added extra nutmeg for starters then because I didn't like their shape when just dropped onto the cookie sheet I decided to roll them into balls first. If you're going to do that you'll have to flour your hands (repeatedly) because the dough is VERY sticky. After they cooled I frosted them with a butter cream frosting made using eggnog and a good dose of nutmeg incorporated and a light sprinkle of nutmeg on the tops. Turned out very yummy with a cake-like texture. I would make them again.

Dough tastes more like eggnog than the cookie does after it's baked - both are equally delicious though! They were a hit with all who ate them:)

These cookies were delicious! I doubled the nutmeg and even sprinkled more on top before I put them in the oven. I also added 1/4 tsp. cinnamon to the batter. They taste just like eggnog! They are nice and soft and rich! Yum!
