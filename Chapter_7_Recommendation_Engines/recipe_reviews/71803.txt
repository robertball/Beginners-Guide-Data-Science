If you like your potatoes crisp you must add your favorite oil to this recipe either with or without butter and don't cover.  The potatoes will brown their best if you don't 'play with them', just let them cook/brown turning occasionally, also for a little added flavor add a little garlic salt and onion powder.

I made these in my cast iron skillet, used 2 T of butter, which was plenty, and added onion during the second 10 minutes.  The timing was perfect and they turned out amazing!  Thank you!

Always delicious! I make sure to wipe them dry with a clean kitchen towel before I throw them in the skillet, so they're really crispy. And I do use olive oil most of the time instead of butter.

Good Base recipe. I used canola oil and butter and dried off potatoes with paper towel after cutting them and they were nice and crispy when cooked. The key is not to keep stirring the potatoes if you want them crisp on the outside. I put some diced bell pepper and chopped onions. Also garlic powder and onion salt to taste. Thanks for giving me the idea for a nice compliment with our Saturday morning omelettes and fruit.

If you slice the potatoes instead of cubing them the cooking time is about right.  I did 15 mins cover on and 10 off.  I like this version of home fried potatoes...if you want the crispy version fry them in oil.

We make these a lot ~ for breakfast, dinner, and late-night snacking. I add chopped onion and sometimes cut up pieces of bacon (yum). You can really play with the spices here ~ whatever appeals to you.

Finally a fool-proof home fries recipe!  We used red bliss potatoes with rosemary, then threw in some minced garlic for the second 10 minutes.  They came out perfect.  Great with any meal.  Almost impossible to mess these up!  This has now become my official home fries recipe.  Thanks Angie!

Growing up, my mother and grandmother always quarted their potatoes and boiled, drained, and refrigerated them overnight.  The next morning they cubed them and fried them in butter with salt, pepper, and onion.  The frying time was quicker in the morning.  I have tasted them both ways and I personally think they taste better when pre-boiled the day before. (Evenly cooked thoughout too.)

This is a great base for home fries.  Like any other recipe everyone has their preference.  Some people swear by bacon grease, others by oil - cook the potatoes in whatever you like and get them just as crispy as you like.  Thin sliced or cubed with or without onions or spices.  Home fries are a Sunday breakfast tradition that go great with any kind of egg, bacon and toast.

Super tasty and super easy!  Here are my suggestions:
Cook potatoes covered for 8 minutes with salt, pepper, butter and 2 tbsp veggie oil.  Uncover- add chopped onion, bacon, and paprika.  Cook another 8 minutes uncovered.  Limit the stirring, they brown up better if you let them sit.

Much better with half bacon grease, half butter. It's one of my favorite ways to eat homefries, especially when trying to recover from a heck of a hangover. Say it with me, EVERYTHING IS BETTER WITH BACON.

Home fries are one of those "simple" recipes that are oh so hard to replicate at home. The only changes I made were using  1 1/2 tbsp butter and 1 1/2 tbsp oil (I've used both vegetable and olive oil, both work fine) per others suggestions and using Johnny's Seasoning Salt. I like the blend of seasonings in it. These potatoes came out crispy, yet moist. Great base recipe.

That's an absolutely great and oh ! so easy recipe ! I made it today following the recipe to the letter ( exception: I used a combination of unsalted butter and O.O.) and it turned wonderful !
I cubed the potatoes and fried under the lid without desturbing and then took the lid off and seasoned with salt and pepper and stirring fried some more ( less than 10 minutes even )
 Thank you so much for the recipe !

 Everyone will enjoy the "Quick and Easy Home Fries"

Good basic fried potato recipe. I find that adding a little canola or vegetable oil along with the butter will help crisp up the potatoes. Butter alone burns easily leaving the potatoes with an unpleasant look. I have better luck without using the lid.

Delicious! Slightly crispy on the outside, tender but not too mushy on the inside. I soaked the potatoes in salted water for a few minutes before cooking (helps to remove some of the starches to keep them from sticking together when frying) I then patted them dry, and spiced them up with seasoned salt, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, and a few green onions. They were absolutely perfect! Thanks so much for this great basic recipe!

Pretty good basic recipe, followed pretty much as written except didn't use russet but 'white premium'. I used a non-stick pan, about 1.5 tbsp butter (stick measurement) since I was too lazy to try to measure out the scaled down amounts. For my one & half potato took about 7 mins uncovered since I cut them down to small bite sized cubes & didn't want to burn them. They came out basically really crisp brown on one side yet cooked soft on the inside - like diners. Yes, quick and easy home fries. I ate it all with ketchup on the side as if dining out....will be trying other variations as others have mentioned. A keeper!

Great recipe! I only used half of a potato because I wanted to try it out for myself for breakfast. It came out great! I added onion and cooked it with the potato according to the recipe. Salt pepper and ketchup on the side, and they tasted like they were fresh from a diner, crispy outside, soft inside. awesome. 
I used less butter and the time was a lot shorter because I had less potato.

Simple, but a great recipe to start with. I used 3 Yukon gold potatoes, 1 Tbsp butter, and a cast iron skillet. They tasted just like diner home fries (the butter is the key to the diner taste, I think).  Mine didn't really crisp up, but I used much less fat and didn't dry them after dicing. I also added in diced onion, green pepper, breakfast sausage, and mushroom after uncovering and cooked everything probably an extra 10 minutes. I know that varies considerably from the base recipe here, but I wanted something that tasted just like diner fries to accompany my french toast, and this recipe got exactly the results I wanted.

Great! I doubled the recipe, added minced onions, onion and garlic powder, and parsley flakes. It does have a lot of butter. I lined a plate with paper towels and put the potatoes on it. I made muffins, cut them in half and placed the halves in the iron skillet I used to cook potatoes. Beautifully buttered muffins, no waste.

Great recipe, I didn't change anything. I cooked the recipe exactly as posted and the potatoes turned out perfect. They were crisp and brown on the outside but still soft on the inside, without being mushy.

They were really good! I used 4 potatoes and kept everything else the same; could have cut the butter to 2 tablespoons. I cut them pretty small and had to cook for about 8 minutes longer. Will make again!

Nice and easy. I used seasoning salt instead of plain salt, and added a dash of cayenne cuz we like it hot :) Potatoes done nicely, and I would recommend not stirring them too frequently so they brown better.

Followed a couple of recommendations by other reviewers: used part olive oil and part butter, added some grated onion, and cooked uncovered for about 25 mintues. Really great!

This was a pretty good recipe. I took the advice of others and added some garlic salt and union powder. I also added some diced onions. I covered my potatoes for 15 minutes and then uncovered for another 15, turning every 3-4 minutes.

I'm a newbie when it comes to cooking and tonight I decided to try these. They were magnificent. In my skillet I put canola oil and 4 tablespoons of butter before adding my potato cubes. They were absolutely delicious. Thanks for the recipe.

This was the easiest home fries recipe I have used. All the other recipes require other ingredients that I don't usually have on hand. It is so simple and tastes great! To spice it up I added red pepper flakes (just a little) and a little garlic. They tasted just like the restaurant down the street!

Very very good.  This has been my most successful (and appreciated) stab at breakfast potatoes yet.  PERFECTLY COOKED using the times and method provided.  The second time I made them I threw in some sliced onion, a little garlic powder, and a bit of parsley.. also great!

Made these with breakfast this morning.  Very easy.  As some others suggested, I pat the potatoes dry with paper towels before adding to the pan, and added some diced onion, Italian seasoning, and paprika.  Took about 25 minutes (uncovered the whole time).  Came out great!

These are exactly as described: quick and easy. Oh more importantly really delicious. I sprinkled mine with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes (aka pizza heat).  So good, and I have since made them 2 more times.

This recipe makes the most delicious breakfast potatoes I've ever had. I made them exactly as the recipe called for, in an enameled dutch oven. The potatoes had a tendency to stick to the bottom of the pan, and I wish I would have gotten more of it off the bottom of the pans. I will surely make this again, in a different type of nonstick pan.

Pretty good recipe. It needed something a little more, so I added paprika and onions to it. This made me eat 2 servings! Next time I will cut down on the amount of butter as it was too greasy for me.

Surprisingly easy and delicious! I didn't think it would turn out well without deep frying it in oil or at least cooking the potatoes a little first, but it actually turned out great. I added a little onions and minced garlic and it tasted delicious.

I was looking for a quick home fries recipe and found this one.  I must say that this was very quick and easy.  They turned out to be very good!  Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Thanks!

What a great way to use up potatoes! I had a few (they were getting soft, and still turned out with a perfect texture!) that I didn't want to spend a lot of time on, and tried this recipe on a whim. I sliced the potatoes into traditional french fry-shaped sticks, and followed the recipe exactly. The fries were a little brown on the side that got 10 minutes covered, and a few were soft when the batch was done, so next time I might start stirring a little sooner. Other than that, the recipe was amazing! My husband loved them, saying they were as good as the restaurant fries we had eaten last night. Easy and delicious - thank you!

I also sliced, which makes them a little harder to turn (the suction) but they were still delicious--tender inside and crispy outside.

These potatoes were good and very easy to make (as the title suggests). Not real flavorful, but if you're in a hurry and want a quick side dish it's great. I did think the cooking time was off quite a bit though - I cut these into bite size cubes and these took at least 45 minutes before they were cooked all the way through. We served these as a side for breakfast for dinner of scrambled eggs and bacon, but this would be good to go along with almost any type of meal. Thanks for the recipe, Angie!

Just as the other reviewers have said, these were quick, simple and tasted very good without deep frying. Takes a bit more effort but worth it. Would like to try next without using the butter (and maybe olive oil or something).

These were great, and I made them exactly as written.  I was worried that they would not cook through in the allotted time (they did) and that they would not get a lovely golden brown color with the lid on (they did).  I made them in a few minutes on a weekday for a quick breakfast for supper.   It is a good thing they turned out well as everyone hated my strata, so this is all we ate.  ;-) Make with confidence!  I will add these to my Easter Brunch menu.

These were simple, quick & yummy!  Only thing I changed was to use Season Salt instead of regular salt.  Next time I might try it with a little onion and maybe a little ham and cheese to make a meal out of it.

Delicious! 5 stars for cooking method, I was afraid of making this recipe as I tried making hash browns before (I know these aren't hash browns but you can't ignore the similarities) and it turned out disastrous. But this is totally full proof! And customizable too! What I did was used 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and one HALF a tablespoon of bacon grease (So I do agree with others that it doesn't need the full 3 tablespoons of oils). Mine took only about 15 minutes total to cook but that could be because I cubed them quite small. Soaked them in ice water for like 30 minutes (but I'm sure that doesn't make any difference, I only did it because I had something to do between cubing and cooking and I didn't want them to get brown. Instead of just salt and pepper I added Cajun seasoning (Look up 'Cajun Spice Mix' here on allrecipes) a little the first 10 minutes and then to taste the last 2-3 minutes, the same with more salt. I also added a little green onion and yellow onion in the last 3 minutes. Turned out DELICIOUS this way. Will be sure to make again!

This is a great home fries recipe.  I fried the potato and left the pan uncovered.  I fried the potatoes for 30 mins. to make sure they were cooked.  I added red onion in the last 10 mins.  Everybody loved them.

OMG! This recipe is awesome! I am chowing down on it right now actually. Instead of using Butter or Margarine (because we don't have any in the house right now) I used a little Virgin Olive Oil and it came out wonderfully. Thanks for sharing this, it's amazing! :)

I added roughly 2 Tbs of olive oil to this recipe.  I also added italian seasoning and garlic powder.  Next time I will cook them longer to get them slightly more crispy.

I have cooked quite a few things before, but never home fries. Mine were ready sooner (but that's because I have a restaurant grade stove, and its low heat is like a residential stoves high heat,) I also added chopped onions half way through. They came out very good. 
ADD ABOUT 3/4 TBSP OF ROSEMARY 5 MIN BEFORE ITS DONE. IT DOESN'T TASTE QUITE RIGHT WITHOUT IT.

Thank you so much for this recipe! I used to pre-boil the potatoes and it would take forever. This allowed me to make the potatoes in under half the time. After the first ten minutes, I added chopped onion, minced garlic, and chopped green onions. Picture perfect and delicious. Thanks a million!

These were great!  we are going to make them again but I think medium high in a cast iron skillet isn't the right temp (at least on my stove).   My home fries didn't look like this picture, were more done than that.

Easy and very tasty! This was my first attempt at home fries.. I have tried hash browns before, with terrible results. These are wonderful! I used a cast iron skillet, and I think a little bit too much butter, as my potatoes came out a little too crispy in some parts, and a bit uneven. However, they are still delicious! I added about 1/8 tsp of onion salt and garlic salt in addition to pepper before tossing the potatoes into the pan.

Very good and a lot less fat and calories than a traditional home fry.  I added onion the second 10 minutes like a previous comment stated which I really liked.  I ended up cooking it for 10 minutes covered, 10 minutes uncovered when I added the onion, and then an additional 10 minutes covered to get the potatoes tender enough.

This was good.  Used Yukon potatos, no onion or green pepper as my kids don't like them, but did season with Lowrey's.  Crisped up just fine.  I think the trick is to leave them alone and not turn them all the time.  Let them fry for about 10 minutes before turning.

This is a great recipe -  I've used it a few times and it comes out perfect every time. I cook it with the lid on for closer to 15 minutes and I like to use a mix of salt, pepper and garlic powder for the seasoning. The home fries come out crispy on the outside and the seasonings are cooked right in. Highly recommended.

thisis a very good recipe. like the other si use on thi site, its pretty simple and basic, leaving a lot of margine for adjustments according to personal preferance. the cooking time and directions are perfect. i give 5 stars (due to texture, which is a very inportant factor when cooking), however i prefer to use yukon gold or yukon rose potatoes. also,  i prefer to use white pepper and coriander and a few otehr seasonings and herbs to liven up potatoes. the texture is perfect!

Great restaurant style homefries...I use oil instead of butter and dry off the potatoes well before cooking.

These were good, but really they were not crispy on the outside, they were all kinda just mooshy. Anyways, they were still alright, but I will just stick with frozen ones in the deep fryer, thanks!

I usually don't try things that seem this simple. I have this notion that they will be boring. This was simple and easy and very tasty. I did find that I needed to cook them longer than directed so that they weren't undercooked. My husband and baby really liked these! I will make again!

I was raised on these. I just love them. Once in a while I do some changes, like onions and garlic, but mostly I just cook as stated. Thank you so much for reminding me of a family favorite!!

Recently I've started adding some quartered Brussels sprouts when I make these potatoes. Super good! (If you like Brussels sprouts.) Some of the leaves tend to separate and get all crispy in the skillet. Make yourself a nice pile of potatoes and Brussels, then top it with an over easy egg, and mmmm.... you're in heaven.

I made these last night and they were terrific.  I'd never made fried potatoes before, so the detailed instructions were very helpful.  The only change I made was substituting one tbsp of butter for olive oil and using seasoning salt instead of regular salt.

If you've read many of my reviews you know I don't hand out 5-star ratings for anything but recipes I consider extraordinary, but this one deserves it.

It's hard to believe that anything so fast and simple could taste so good.

Works best for me with potato cubes that are cut about 3/8-inch square.

These are the BEST!  I put the raw, cubed potatoes in a zip lock, poured the melted butter (cooled down a bit)over them, then squished around to get the coverage I wanted.  I tried some of the suggestions many others have posted... wonderful. Everyone tells me they are the best home fries they have ever had!  Thanks Angie, and thanks, too, to all who have added their hints & tips!

Simple and tasty. I cut my potatoes a bit small and they were done faster, but they were also a bit mushy. They were extra tasty with a dash of garlic powder.

My family loved these. No need to peel or boil. The title says it all. I added some garlic powder and sprinkled a little parsley at the end. I'd make these for breakfast or dinner.

I made a few modifications and ended up with a sensational dish. I melted 4 Tbsp. of butter, then added fairie dust, Yep pepper seasoning, garlic salt, garlic pepper and a sprinkling of Cayenne pepper to the melted butter. l then added in the well-drained potatoes and sprinkled in a little more of my seasonings and stirred to coat the potatoes with the seasoned butter. l also heated on medium-low heat to prevent scorching.

This is just how you start with home fries.  Easy,  fairly quick.. but a bit plain.  here's how I do it for my family: we use left over baked potatoes from the night before (usually make extra just for this) if I don't have them, then I boil a few the night before with skin but not entirely fork tender because i'll be frying them in the morning.. then I refrigerate until morning .  Why? because they're a lot quicker to peel cold and partially precooked, Peeled with the edge of a spoon no less. If Im too rushed, then so long as they're washed really well, I don't peel and I microwave a bit to soften but not cook through.  I also dice/chop onion and some green and red peppers. Saute till almost tender the onion and green pepper.. remove from pan,
add your peeled/not peeled, partially cooked chopped potatoes.. and when they're mostly crisped and about 2-3 minutes from done, I add back the onion and peppers..  I usually use butter for the onion and peppers.. and olive oil for the potatoes (higher smoke point, crispier potatoes)  I usually add black pepper on top before serving and have hot sauce on the table.  but you can add what you like to the pan or at table, bit of parsley... garlic.. dill.. bit of grated cheese.. whatever you like.  Sky's the limit now that you have the base.
This is a great base recipe!! thanks for posting

I make home fries like this all the time except I use bacon grease, sliced onions and add a few dashes of red pepper flakes. I have found that not covering the pan will result in crisper potatoes. Good basic recipe.

I've been doing it wrong all this time. The key was cube the potatoes, rinse with cold water and towel dry before adding to skillet. Used olive oil instead of butter, added three cut up  pieces of bacon and sprinkled with a little garlic powder.  Will add onions next time.   Browned beautifully and potatoes were nice and crispy on the outside.  No more soggy home fries.  Thank you!!

Followed the suggestions of others and added olive oil to butter 50/50. Didn't cover the potatoes and didn't turn too frequently. Turned out nice and crispy.

I added oil after cooking it covered to basically fry the potatoes after they cooked. I also added onion powder and garlic powder. I took half out after trying to brown them in the butter so I would have the perfect mixture of soft and crispy! Will be making these again, soon!

Delicious! I found more cooking time was required - about 30 minutes instead of 20. I added onions, garlic, and onion power.

I love potatoes, and I love this recipe!  I followed it exactly except I made sure to dry off the chopped potatoes before putting in the pan.  I think I added a bit of minced garlic too. I also used olive oil instead of butter. Like other reviewers said, I keep them still so they get crispy. They were dee-licious!

I took a recent reviewers idea and added peppers and onions during the last ten minutes, I also seasoned with adobo Goya instead of salt and pepper. My hubby really enjoyed them, diner experience at home, will definitely make them again

This was a great, very quick, and easy recipe. I added vegetable oil to my butter as well as onion and garlic powder. I had never made homefries before and they came out perfectly! I'll be making a lot more of these for breakfast and late nights, thanks!

I make easier potatoes.  I bake some or nuke some then bake a head of time. Store in the frig.  When I want pan fried potatoes I just chop them up and then pan fry those baked ones.  They in my opinion are even better as the skins get crunchier and so easy to just take from the frig in a hurry.  Absolutely delicious!!!!!

I followed the recipe but fried some bacon and then used the left over grease mixed with the butter while cooking. Then I wrapped it up by sprinkling pieces of bacon  into the potatoes while they cooked uncovered for the final minute. They came out great. Crispy outside with a soft inside.

This is how I have fried my potatoes my entire life, except for the lid, which I never use.  Garlic salt or powder, salt & pepper to taste.  Occasionally throw in Italian seasoning, onion or bacon, depending on my mood.  Good basic recipe and pretty much fool proof, unless you try to crowd in too many potatoes - then they don't crisp up as well.  My family loves these with eggs and bacon or sausage.  I always cook them in my old cast iron pan, and no camping trip is complete without these potatoes.

Perfect.  I added scallions and parsley toward the end.  I used a cast iron skillet set to high with the lid on and then for the last part, where you remove the lid, I set the heat to 4.  Needed a little salt and pepper at the end.

I added in green onions to this recipe for a kick of flavor and a bit of garlic powder.  Mine didn't quite crisp up like the recipe said they would, but I was attending to kids on a really busy afternoon when I did this recipe, so it very well could be my fault.  We'll definitely try this one again.  I cut my potatoes the night before and left them in the fridge in ice cold water and that saved me a lot of time during the hectic after work/school dinner hour.

You need to add spice/herbs to this recipe.  It is terribly bland.  Thyme, basil, oregano, paprika, chili powder if you like but definitely some garlic and onion powder.  If you like bland, you love these.

Yum! I used a combo of bacon grease, butter and coconut oil since I had it on hand. I peeled the potatoes (personal preference), cubed them small and dried them with paper towels. I made sure not to stir them at all once I put the lid on the pan and only mixed a couple times during the second 10 minutes. Great recipe and great tips about leaving the taters alone. I'll definitely make these again. Super easy.

Easy and quick. I also added smoked paprika to the potatoes and made them really crispy by keeping them for half hour before adding asparagus.

A quick and easy recipe that creates crispy home fries that are cooked through.  I followed the cooking instructions exactly-cooking 10 min with the cover on, and 10 with the cover off.  The trick is to leave the potatoes alone, and let them brown, turning only a few times.  I added onion for flavor, and my own spices.  This is now my permanent home fries recipe.  Thank you!

Love this recipe and so did my family! I used oil in my pan instead of butter and other than the fact that I burnt some to the bottom from not stirring the potatoes enough it worked perfectly. I also added some garlic powder, paprika, and onions to them while they cooked. I had no leftovers from the first time making them. Definitely will make this recipe again and again. My daughters will make sure of it!

These were wonderful.  Made as directed but used half canola oil and half butter.  Next time will add onions, too.  A very nice addition to our weekend breakfast!

Pretty good, but nothing special. They turned out as expected with such a simple recipe. Added oil to help crisp them up as other reviewers suggested, and didn't mess with them. Worked well.

A really great recipe and easy to make. I think the key thing is to make sure to cover the potatoes for 10 mins then cook it without the lid for another 10-15 mins. It was also very tasty with some chopped caramelized onions and Lawry's seasoning salt.

These home fries were great.  I added some very small chopped fresh onions to the pan with the butter and some seasoned salt which I would highly recommend.

I make these almost every morning when my BF is home. I used EVOO instead of butter and then season with whatever sounds good. Usually I used a a greek garlic seasoning with some Ravens Seasoned salt. So yummy!

This reminded me so much of the way my mother used to make them :-) I didn't have a lid that would fit my cast iron pan, so I just didn't cover them. It did take longer to get them done, and mine blackened a bit (mmm just how I like them!). I added onions, garlic powder, and chili powder. I'd make them again, but only when I'm craving comfort food, as oven-fries are just much easier. Thanks for the recipe!

I've tried and tried so many Home Fries recipes to end up with a "mushy" mess.  I love this recipe, only change I made was to add chopped onions and some garlic and they where delicious!!!  Will try again & again.

If it says potatoe we love it. My version can be used for any kind of meal. We wedge slice these leaving the skins on. I take a storage bag put 1/2 cup olive oil in it, add Mr.mrs Dash. Add the potatoes and make sure they are coated. Line a cookie sheet with foil, pour out the potatoes on the sheet. Bake in oven, 350 degrees for 25min. or until done to your liking. woohoo Taters!!

I used cubed baked potato (with the skin on) and added onion.  This has to be one of my favorite side dishes...or even one of my favorite meals.

This is one of those recipes with simple ingredients where apparently technique makes the difference.  Followed directions to the letter and also a reviewer's hint to dry cubed potatoes before frying.  Used a combination of oil and bacon grease instead of butter with great results (in a black iron skillet, of course,using medium-medium high setting on burner). Sometimes I've had trouble burning fried potatoes, this time no problem).

I always loved Home fries, and now I don't have to go to a diner to eat them! I added garlic powder, and onion powder and kept it covered for a little more then 10 minutes, and then to get them crispy I don't turn them often, I let them brown a little and then turn them! It ends up taking 30-35 minutes to actually make them not including prep) but it was so worth it!

Good method, have made this a few times now. I do add a bit of olive oil to crisp up the potatoes a bit. I've tried both cubed and in round slices, and both are good! I also like to sub in a bit of garlic salt.

This is a great recipe.  Instead of butter I use coconut oil.  I also add cumin, oregano and garlic salt.  My family and friends love to have breakfast at my house and eat my home fries.

The only reason these only rate 3 stars is that they easily took double the time to cook.  the short & easy cooking time was their first attraction!

These were really quick and easy. They cooked up perfect! I did however use canola oil in place of the butter, and used a whole onion. Added lots of pepper, onion powder, and garlic salt.

Tried today.  Never did Home Fries before.  I added diced Garlic.  Don't do that.  Tasted great.  Was not visually appealing. I want to try onions next time.

These were really good.  I used a hot and spicy garlic oil instead of the butter and it gave them just a little kick.  I cooked much longer than the 10 minutes suggested after the lid was removed to get them really crispy.  They were certainly good enough for company.

I thought these were good, not great.  They were not crisp, as I would've preferred, but the flavor was pretty good (I added paprika & included about 1/2 cup diced onion--a little smaller dice than the potato dice).  My husband thought they were really good.  Will try again and maybe leave the cover off for more of the cooking to get them crisper?

Thanks for sharing this excellent basic recipe for home fries. I always use garlic infused olive oil in place of the butter. For a tasty variation, try dicing a bit of red and green bell pepper and some minced garlic.

These were so easy, and I got rave reviews at breakfast. To save time, I cubed the potatoes the night before and let them sit in a bowl of water in the fridge until I was ready to use them. I also used a spice mix instead of s&p. They just had a little kick to them - went great with a southern frittata! Thanks for such a great recipe... I will certainly use again and again.

My husband flipped for these! I added a bit of garlic, onion & cayenne pepper. When we eat breakfast out, he always orders these wherever we go. He said these were better than any he has ever tasted.

Excellent!!  I used my dutch oven (stove top).  I added a small onion for the last 10 minutes and a touch of cayenne pepper for a bit of a kick!  I was pleased with how crisp they came out!

These turned out pretty good, I added a little chili powder along with lots of salt and pepper.  I think next time I'll cook them a little longer, I like them a bit crispier.  Thanks for the recipe.

Really good! I stuck to the recipe for the most part but did use a combination of butter and olive oil. I seasoned with salt and pepper and then added onion powder and season salt at the end. They didn't get as crispy as I like but it was still great!

This is awesome. So simple I almost can’t believe it’s a recipe on here, but I had never made it, and it really came out awesome. Everyone loved it and asked for it again. Recipe seems fairly dummy proof. I followed as written but I wouldn’t hesitate to make adjustments. It’s easy too. Really good.

Yummy!  I adjusted seasonings - less red pepper flakes, added a little garlic powder, some paprika, some turmeric, and dried chives.  

Once I removed the lid and cooked for 10 more minutes, they were way too hard on the inside.  I had to cook much longer to finish.

I only cook twice a year. My husband’s birthday and Father’s Day. Even I made them!  They were easy and delicious. It’s a must try recipe.

This worked pretty well for me, but most reviewers seem to mention this is as a starting point. I only used two potatoes and two tablespoons of butter but kept the cooking times the same. I noticed that some of the pieces got much browner than others from sitting directly on the skillet longer during the first half of this recipe. I would reccomend stirring while the lid is covered because even though I love crunchy potatoes, the softness of the bites that covering the skillet provides is too invaluable to me. You can always add oil and other seasonings or garlic or onion once you remove the lid. Just let them sit in intervals and only stir to make sure they all get equal treatment every few minutes.

I thought these were really good! Just don't forget to check them during the initial 10 minutes of cooking while they're covered. Mine got a little bit over browned!

Delicious! I cut the sugar down to a little more than 1/2 cup - next time I'll cut down the sugar a little less, it was a little too tart. The berries solidified nicely - I followed the tips to used 5 tablespoons instead of 3. I noticed the berries tasted a little watery - I recommend drying off the water after washing really well. Will make again!

I made these today (1/9/19).  I used Yukon Gold potatoes as that was what I had on hand.  I added a little bit of olive oil to the butter because I didn't want the butter to burn (it burns at a lower temp than olive oil).  After taking off the lid, I ended up letting the potatoes cook for about 15 minutes.  They were pretty close in taste (not quite as crispy so will add a few more minutes to the final cook time n the future) to the diced potatoes at one of my favorite restaurants in Mpls. (Hot Plate).  I definitely will make again.  They would probably be good with a little parmesan sprinkled on them at the very end.

I salted my cubes and stuck them in the fridge for a few hrs, pouring off the water that dripped off.  When cooking I used an herb butter (rosemary, chives, mrs. dash original blend), sprinkled garlic salt before cooking. Delicious!

These are the easiest, tastiest home fries recipe I've come across.  Will be incorporating this into my breakfast routines.  I used creamer potatoes by the way, really good. Crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside.

Made these with red potatoes as they were what I had on hand and I was dying for some comfort food. These turned out excellently! I sliced my potatoes fairly thin vs.cubing them, but other than that followed the recipe exactly. Very simple but great flavor. Thank you for sharing!

Wonderful recipe! I have made home fries many times without a recipe and they usually come out mushy and never crispy. This recipe is so easy and they came out PERFECT! I did of course add a bunch of seasonings to them (onions, garlic, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, parsley) but the cooking method is great!

One of my faves, quick and easy. I never make 3 potatoes worth, but since the potato/butter ratio is 1:1 i just adjust.

...and after all these years, I now have a reliable recipe for home fries. I use a cast iron skillet. Make sure the potatoes are in a single layer - better results if you don't crowd them into the pan. I usually use half butter and half olive oil, sometimes I add onion (at the beginning of cooking time), or sprinkle lightly with: onion powder or garlic powder or cayenne or paprika (toward the end of cooking time - some spices tend to burn and give a harsh taste to foods...)

I peel, cut, and boil potatoes for 15 minutes. Drain them and let them dry out for another 15 minutes or so.
Add them to  skillet  over medium-hot heat with grapeseed or olive oil, brown 'em up, lower heat add butter, paprika, salt and pepper.
Done.

This recipe turned out wonderful!  The only change I did was add  fresh cut rosemary (per my family's taste). Yes - I waited 6 minutes then "flipped" the potatoes - turned out nice and cripy.  Per other reviewers  do not do a lot of stirring or moving the potatoes around as it will reduce the "crispy" consistency.

Perfectly simple, easy, & fast recipe for home fries!  We added just a touch of cayenne for some spice. They turned out fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside.

Had to make these twice, the second with personal revisions since the dish turned out to soggy ;I had to drain between paper towels then put in a cookie sheet in oven for an additional 20 min. My revisions: I did not use the stated amount of butter instead I used 1 tablespoon in the pan and halfway thru cooking drizzled a tiny bit of extra virgin olive oil. I also did not cover these potatoes since the steam makes them way too soggy. I also added crumbled sausage and shredded cheese, put inside warm corn tortillas and topped with pico de gallo and jalapeño flavored sour cream.

Awesome! I used this dish for breakfast and as a side dish for dinner. The simplicity makes this dish a go-to when I have taste for potatoes.

Great technique!  They were crispy, but not burnt.  I added some garlic powder and they were deliciously seasoned.   I cut them into small cubes and they cooked quickly.  Thanks!

Followed all instructions!
I was so excited that my potatos were actually cooked! You just don't know my potato struggle!
Kids got as is, adults were fancied up with rosemary and garlic powder. Over medium eggs were added on all.  Thank you!

I disagree with the other reviews that say to add oil or cook without covering.  I made these the first time without covering,  the potatoes weren't cooked through.  The next 2 times I made them as directed.  The only thing I changed was to add diced onions during the second 10 minutes of cooking.  I love this recipe!

I also used both butter and oil, did not cover the pan and got excellent results. I just stirred it once in a while so they could cook evenly. They came out nice and brown on the outside and soft on the inside. I did add some garlic powder, onion powder and salt; that definitely helped to give it more flavor. I added some of the potatoes  to my homemade beef hash (leftover pot roast, along with chopped onions and peppers in the processor and browning for 10 min). I also had some of the side with that, as breakfast for supper (and ketchup needed)!

This is a good starter recipe.  I use oil and never cover mine, they don't get crispy enough.  Also if you want to add more flavor you can add onions, garlic, and even some peppers.

I tried to make it like hash style and honestly I never thought it would be that easy to do this at home. It's an easy good recipe. Just make sure not to leave it and play with them to avoid getting the potatoes burned.

This was so much easier than I ever thought it was to make this. Not to mention how fabulous the texture and taste is. I personally added onion powder ( no hash brown or home fries should be without a hint of that flavor, even if you think you don't like onions) and Lawry's seasoned salt. Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper is my go.  I Made sure the pan was well buttered and even threw in a a bit more when it started sticking. I personally am a cheese freak and put cheese on everything so I melted some American cheese on top. Land o lakes is my favorite. I melted the cheese on med heat with the top on instead of a microwave and slide it onto my plate. I paired it with some plain Fiber One cereal for the added fiber (in my head it makes me feel better about the fat and carbs I just made. Lol ) Oh and with a thirst quenching cup of OJ to complete this breakfast.

Great base directions to get southern style home fries.  Agree with directions to let them sit and not stir to get crispy.  Cooked in cast iron pan.  Used small Yukon golds & didn't peel and diced small.  I followed another comment and added some oil (had avacado oil) to butter.  Stirred in some green onions for last five minutes.  Turned out great with kosher salt & pepper on top.

This is a straightforward recipe. I used olive oil and high heat to turn out  very crispy. A little water will soften them the last 5 minutes of cooking if desired.

Great recipe, I used olive oil instead of butter, and Mrs. Dash instead of salt and pepper. Added red  onions 10 minutes after  plus lid. 10 minutes later Amazing.

not yet but will try onions and bacon next. Fantastic spuds. I have since made this dish numerous times with and without onions and season salts. Very easy and fantastic flavor when using red potatoes.

I have cooked these for years. Covering them is important if you cube them bigger. Shredded not necessary. I season my potatoes with cayenne pepper, garlic powder, rosemary. I don't use this much butter. One Tbs. Is plenty...I let the spices be the star of this dish.

Awesome! I used butter and added a bunch of other veggies at approximately the 10 minute mark (e.g. red and green peppers, mushrooms, chopped onions, jalapenos, etc.) and it turned out wonderful. I wanted these to turn out a bit more crispy so I followed the recommendation to not move them around or cover them. However, in the end I did end up covering them because after 20 minutes they were still a little crunchy. I think covering them with a lid helps steam them a bit.

The first time I tried this recipe, I was eating the potatoes right from the skillet!  Try doing the same with sweet potatoes (or yams, as we have up north).  Instead of salt, use a mixture of cinnamon and sugar!  Deelish!

This recipe is good, quick and easy.  I did read somewhere in the reviews that oil can be used instead of butter.  This should help the potatoes to brown more quickly and be crisper.  Good job though will use for breakfast.

SO GREATTTTTTTT! My mom did not think that this recipe was going to work, but it was delicious. Definitely making larger doses next time. 

A crowd pleaser.

The method was good (cook with lid on for ten minutes, then off for ten minutes). Everything else was way off. Butter doesn't get hot enough without burning to fry potatoes well, so you need at least half to be oil. Also, the basic recipe is quite bland -- needs onion, bell pepper, black pepper, or something extra. Still, it's a simple, basic recipe that's worth experimenting with.

I tried this recipe last night for a late dinner.  OMG.  Talk about delicious!  As I cut the potato I put it in cold water until all were cubed.  Afterwards, I rinsed them several times to remove excess starch and I patted them dry with a paper towel.  I used Challenge Whipped Butter in a cast iron skillet, sea salt, coarse black pepper, and turmeric.  The trick is to have them on medium heat and only flip them once or twice. Add a little more butter if they're hard to pick up.  Then remove and drain for a bit.  I WILL EAT THIS AGAIN! :D  Thank you!

I'm potato-stupid. That is, I can cook all kinds of things, but when it comes to potatoes it doesn't matter what I do, they don't come out right. So it's saying something that these came out great on the first try. Followed recipe exactly.

Just had a ton of leftover potatoes from my barbecue last night. Since they were already cooked I just threw in the ingredients, heated them up and done!  Quick, easy and good.

This is the EASIEST and FASTEST way to make french fries! There's no oil leftover from frying, oil mess to clean, or extra flour coating on potatoes before frying or anything! SUPER simple and delicious way to get instant fries! LOVE THIS!!!

I've made this a couple times now and they come out OK, not great. Very dry, and potatoes unevenly cooked. Will continue to experiment with cooking time, ingredients etc. Thank you to OP and others for contributing:)

I love quick and easy.  The only changes I made was to use red potatoes, and starting the potatoes in my cast iron skillet and then putting it into the oven to finish with the breakfast casserole I was baking.  I wish I had made more, because they were eaten very quickly.

Easy basic recipe as is.  I do often substitute a little bit of bacon grease for flavoring and add sliced onion along with the potatoes.  Very yummy.

Excellent recipe...nothing like real butter and high heat! I brown mine like this recipe, then I add chopped onions & red bell peppers and season w/Greek seasoning or Adobo and plenty of pepper! I finish at low heat uncovered.....Do not turn the taters anymore than absolutely necessary!

I always microwave my potatoes before pan frying, it makes things go so much faster.  I like onion in my hash browns, so while the potatoes are in the microwave I start the onions in the skillet.  I also add paprika to help w/the browning.

Loved this recipe w/ a few tweaks I used from other reviews & recipes - thx to all for ideas! I used a dozen red potatoes instead of russets, cubed & dried, then put in skillet w/ 2 tbsps olive oil + 1 tbsp butter. Also added freshly ground sea salt & pepper, garlic powder, touch of cayenne. Someone suggested sprinkling in some bread crumbs for extra crispiness & to leave lid off for 10-15 mins at end. Threw in some fresh garlic & onions when they were 5-10 mins from done. All of those ideas/additions along w/ basic recipe worked great! My family loved these; the amt this made should've fed 8 or more as side dish but the 4 of us polished all of them off!  Definitely a new family favorite - they ask for these all the time!

First time making home fries. Hubby was gonna make mashed last night. Plans changed after son peeled potatoes, so used those for this morning. I used Season all salt and Pepper. Because of some of the reviews I melted the 3T of Butter and some EVOO. My Husband Likes them and this is an easy keeper that could definitely add some onions, etc.

This was easy to make and soooo gooooood! All I added was a little splash of Mrs. Dash... the garlic one. But that's because I like everything to have garlic on it.

Super tasty and super easy. I used Yukon Gold and dried the potatoes before putting them into the skillet. Super easy. I also added some garlic powder and for the second half I cut up 1/4 of an onion and mixed it. I'm eating them right now and they are perfect! Thank you for this!

Fantastic- just as they are. I happened to have some fresh rosemary in my garden and added about 1 tsp. but I have a feeling they would have been just fine without that addition. I will certainly make these again.

Very easy.  Added olive oil to the butter to try for the crispy potatoes, I didn't get it though.  Added some garlic salt and onions as well.

This was so quick and easy!  I followed the recipe but added some onion powder, garlic salt and pepper.  It gives it a little more flavor and i never see a problem adding garlic to anything!

These were delicious!! My husband was really excited to see these on the table. He said that he hadn't had any fries like this since he was a child! The only complaint is that they took twice as long to cook. Will make again, but will allow more time.

My DH is very fond of these.  He likes them with a few strips of sliced-up bacon, a little bit of onion, garlic salt and italian seasoning.  I like them plain with some shredded cheese melted over the top...yum!

Also, to cut back on cook time they now sell fresh, pre cooked, & cut potatoes in different "styles" inc. diced in the produce isle.  They're by Reesers (sp?) & are the ultimate time saver, esp. when you have young kids or just want to make something quick.  I personally don't like my home fries really crispy, I prefer them to have more of a light, crisp "coating" on the outside (I call them "diner style" lol) but my 2 y/o likes them crispy b/c he thinks they're a kind of french fry lol
I will say that if you're cooking for more than 2 or 3 then you're probably better off doing the potatoes yourself  b/c unless Reesers are on sale, it can get pretty pricy buying enough to feed everyone but if you can afford it, def. go for it!  
and don't forget like I said before, nothing's wrong with using frozen diced onion in any recipe... no one will be able to tell the difference lol

(I'm a single mom to a pretty impatient 2 y/o so I'm all about shortcuts but I still try to keep it as healthy as possible)

I was skeptical because I've tried my hand at home fries many times, but this is by far the easiest, tastiest & most efficient way to make a great side!

Eh this was okay. I used white potatoes so maybe that's why they weren't crisp. For a fast recipe this was decent. Will try again with russets.

This is very good and easy to make. I added a dash of garlic powder. Super delicious! Thanks for the recipe.
