Based on the review I did some searching and found this recipe (http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/green-tea-cupcakes-topped-with-green-tea-buttercream-frosting-recipe.html) that shared some of the quantities / ingredients in this recipe but incorporated some important differences so I used that recipe to make some changes to this one. The changes are that I included adding 3 tsp baking powder 1 tsp salt and using oil instead of butter. I also used a full cup of milk and a little more matcha powder - 3 TBS. I made those changes and my cupcakes were WONDERFUL. Perfectly tender cupcakes with a little crispy top. These are delicious!! I topped them with a quick and easy matcha glaze (about 1/2 cup powdered sugar 1/2 tsp matcha powder and 1 - 2 TBS milk to thin) then dipped the slightly still warm cupcake tops in the glaze.

the funny thing about this recipe is that the ingredients says 1/2 cup milk but it says nothing in the directions! I wasn't sure when to add it. I thought I overlooked but I didn't. so I added the milk in the batter anyway. and the result it came out so dry and does not taste good at all. Sorry I tried:(
