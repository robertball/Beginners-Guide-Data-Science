This recipe has potential but, as is, I can't give t more than a 3. It felt like I was eating an italianate cauliflower with a Canadian-flair chicken. 

The cooking times are off. 4o minutes for a boneless chicken breast, even if wrapped in bacon, gets you dry chicken. I tried lowering my times to 34 minutes and at 410 and it was still dry. So: lower the cooking time to 30 minutes tops; 25-28 would work for any size chicken breast.

The cooking also affected the cauliflower. It was overcooked, a bit bitter, and the garlic and parsley overwhelmed. Next time I will take off the garlic and the parsley, cook it with onion and shredded carrots, see if that works better. Because of that, I think that instead of thyme I would season this whole thing with sage instead of thyme:

While at that; I will try skip the sugar mix and instead brush the bacon with some maple syrup and maybe sprinkle some fresh-ground pepper. I think that all these flavors would make this dish a whole lot more coherent. It is up to you guys to try it, though :)

My husband has always hated cauliflower, but this recipe is wonderful.  I didnt bacon wrap the chicken; I just sliced boneless skinless thighs in strips, piled them in the middle of the pan, then brushed with bacon grease and sprinkled with half and half mild chili powder and brown sugar.  At the end, I just mixed the herbed cauliflower and chicken strips all together, and served in big bowls.  YUM.

I made this tonight for the Bfriend and carnivores in my life. I was really concerned about the flavor of the cauliflower. I did have to roast a bit longer than stated but I just watched color. I added chopped red onion and green onion to the cauliflower the last 15 min of cooking because I had them leftover.  This was delicious! Flat out just good and pure nutrition. Thank You!

Yum-my!  I did use acorn squash to fill the call for 2 lb cauliflower, as I only had 12 oz.  We have half left for another meal.  I'll definitely make this again!

I served it on a bed of fresh arugula.  Looked like a restaurant meal!  Sorry, didn't think to take a picture.

This was my first time to make a sheet pan meal. The cauliflower rice was superb. The chicken was just ok, a bit dry. I believe the problem was the temperature being too high. Seeing that the chicken is thinly sliced, it practically burned. I'll try a lower temperature next time. Thank you for the recipe.

Delicious and definitely a keeper. I did add some chopped red onion in with the cauliflower about halfway through cooking. The chicken breasts were thick so I cut them in half horizontally as thick filets and the cooked for 43 minutes total. Thank you for the recipe!

I just used fresh, whole, boneless breasts, and frozen riced cauliflower, and it came out perfectly! My family loved this, and it will definitely be in our rotation from now on!

Have made this twice now using boneless chicken thighs and riced cauliflower from Costco.  It’s a fan favorite and we will be making it on a regular basis.

This recipe sounded delicious but it ended up being way too sweet. First of all — it cooked in almost half the recommended time. If I hadn’t been conservative about the suggested cook time and checking the oven it would have been overdone. I did cut back on the brown sugar but it still came out too sweet and because I had to cut back on the cook time the bacon never caramelized as per the recipe. 
I did like the cauliflower part cooking alongside the chicken. It had a nice flavor too. I would attempt to try again with bigger pieces of chicken and less brown sugar.

Absolutely a delicious entrée! The bacon drippings did make the cauliflower rice a little mushy (but, hey, it's bacon grease... who can complain?). To make the caulker rice more rice-like try  putting it on a separate baking sheet when cooking.

This was quite delicious.  First time hubby and I have had riced cauliflower.  I’m so glad I read the reviews pointing out the long cooking times.  I halved the recipe and cooked for 15 min plus 15 min and chicken was perfect.  Only reasons it gets only 4 stars is because of the cooking time mistakes and that it is almost low-carb, except for the sugar.  Then again, that’s one of the reasons it’s so tasty!

I enjoyed making this one much more the second time.  Changes: Added more Garlic, Parsley,Thyme, and Pecans. I took chicken (7) out earlier for a total of 16 minutes per side and did a final 2 minutes broil on both sides to get bacon crisp.  Next time more chili powder and brown sugar! Kids gobbled it down

This recipe was fantastic.   I made a bigger batch and cooked the chicken and cauliflower rice in two separate pans, side by side in the oven.  When They were done, I poured the drippings in the rice.  This was a very YUMMY dish!!

Yes, I made it as written and enjoyed the flavors of the herbs & bacon.   I don't eat enough veggies and the cauliflower was good with this because it absorbed the various flavors!  I will make it again and have already shared with others.

Only change I made was; I didn't have any parsley, so I added cilantro instead.  It was very good, and my husband said it was a definate keeper.

Easy and full of flavor.  I did this as an easy hands-off weeknight meal so I used frozen bags of cauliflower rice and dry versions of the herbs. I'd love to try it with all the fresh stuff soon too.

Excellent way to eat cauliflower. I had pork with it and we all loved it.
