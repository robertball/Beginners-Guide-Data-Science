Yummy!  We put our cheese sticks in the freezer until solid before dipping and baking, they didn't melt at all!

These were okay. They didn't crisp up like fried sticks and the cheese started melting out. I won't make them again, as I think these really need to be fried for the breading to cook properly.

Loved it...but due to people saying they got runny I reduced the heat to 300 and also added some garlic powder for extra flavoring...it was perfect! Will make again! Also used wax paper on the pan and cut the sticks in half if that makes a difference...very good :) family approved!

Loved 'em! I attempted these for the 1st time and found that if I 'smoosh' the bread crumb mixture on the cheese sticks, it stays a lot better and creates more of the traditional style. Great for kids!! They will have fun with all the smooshing :)

Sadly, I agree with "mmyers168".  They didn't crisp and the cheese did ooze out.  Some things have to be fried, I guess.  This is one of them.  Just go for the caloric mozzarella stick and save your calories elsewhere. Will not make again and threw away recipe.

Definitely needs some tweeking... All melted together and did not crisp up. Most likely not making these again, unless I fry them.

I thought these were pretty good. I cut the cheesesticks in half & only warned up for a couple of minutes. I only gave then 4 stars only because the fried ones are so good, but these were good too. :)

I agree with Cherries, that freezing helps a lot! To give them a slightly crispier taste, I added an egg  coating and then a flour coating. I pan fried it until it's a light brown color , then I cooked it in the oven at 300 degrees F. for about 3 minutes. Turned out to be AMAZING!!!

Love it! Double dipping and making sure to coat the ends will keep it from melting. Anyone who says it didn't crisp must not have used panko so yummy!

I made these and they turned out great! I dipped in the egg mixture and breadcrumbs a second time, and then gave them a quick spray with coconut oil before popping them in the oven.

This recipe was ok.  Not as good as fried obviously.  Hit the spot when I was craving, but I won't be making these mozzarella sticks again.
