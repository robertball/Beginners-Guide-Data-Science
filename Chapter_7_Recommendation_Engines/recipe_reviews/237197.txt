Great soup! I used veggie broth and a stick blender.. We haven't added milk yet because it is so perfect as is! Our son is a vegan and I'm taking a big bowl in to work tomorrow for him! We may add in milk or soy milk tomorrow.I did use extra carrot's as another reader did. It took a while for the celery to cook down and i used olive oil for that,plenty of onion in the veggie broth so i didn't need to use more than a half of a small onion...!! will make this again many times!! a great way to get fresh celery and carrots on the dinner menu!!!

I made it once.  There are just of us and we finished it in two days.  I used 1%  milk (all I use) skipped the potatoes altogether.  Again, I used red onions because that was all I had.  I put all the veggies through a stick chopper.
They were so nicely done, I didn't even bother with pureeing.  I am getting ready to do another batch this evening.
This recipe is a definite keeper for family, guests and take along for potlucks. It deserves 5 stars but some people may think I am exaggerating.  Awesome soup.

I used vegetable broth rather than chicken broth, and plain rice milk and boiled potatoes rather than milk and potato flakes. Topped with fresh parsley and sauteed tofu cubes. Fantastic, thank you for this recipe.

This soup was excellent. I only added 5 bay leaves and 1/4 cream cheese bar.. Delicious. I'll make it again.

I had an extra bunch of celery and didn't want to waste it.  The only two things different that I did was not add celery seed (I'm not a fan), and I did add some minced carrot into it.  Otherwise, very tasty.  I'd make this again.

Didnt have a full bunch of celery so reduced the liquids and seasoning . Used my immersion blender right in the soup pot. Baked a potato and mashed it w the milk and added it to the blended soup.  Oh, used  1 Tbsp butter instead of butter flavoring. The pepper gave it a nice kick! Husband said “tastes like more”!??

I think I'm a bit biased because celery isn't my favourite. My bf liked it though. I'm not sure if he was just being nice or if he actually liked it. I don't think I'll make it again. It was a bit bitter.

Nice soup.. light but tasty.  I had to make a last minute substitution  I thought the box in the cupboard was potato flakes.. it was pancake mix, so I diced up a potato and threw it in instead of the flakes

Mine turned out way too peppery :( I would cut the pepper and celery seed in half if I were to make it again.

I used potatoes instead of the potato flakes. Very very tasty.
