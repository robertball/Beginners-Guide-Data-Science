I LOVED this! I'm not sure why i never tried pizza on the BBQ before, but Im sure glad i did, and it will for sure become popular on our summer menu :) I used homemade dough rather than store bought, and it worked out great! Also used the Blue Ribbon bbq sauce i received in my missing ingredient package..and WOW..LOVE it! Added some red onion,just because and used yellow and red tomatoes. This is such a great way for people to customize their own pizzas. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I made two pizzas; one as is and the other to suit our taste. The first (the original recipe) was bland but really loved the idea of grilling on the BBQ. I'm glad I made a second one because adding more ingredients really brought that pizza to a different level. The only downside was we ran out of propane while cooking the 2nd one so we finished it in the oven. The ingredients I added on the second one was; spread tomato paste at the bottom and top with BBQ sauce, shredded chicken instead of chopped, sliced red onion, sliced red pepper, garlic salt, Italian seasoning, black pepper and I substituted Mexicana mild along with Habanero shredded cheese instead of Colby-Monterey Jack cheese and sprinkle fresh chopped parsley. Beside the mild flavor from the original one, it was interesting to try a new way of cooking pizza and using chicken and tomatoes which for us, was a first.

This recipe is so good! I recommend using a spicy bbq sauce to max. the flavour you'll get.  This recipe is easily customized. For example, I added feta cheese and used Monterey jack instead of Colby.  I'll be making this one again, for sure!

We really liked this. I used Prairie Smoke & Spice Blue Ribbinâ€™ Sweet Sauce from the Missing Ingredient for the barbeque sauce. I did substitute some things used ingredients that I had. Instead of dough I used naan bread,mozzarella cheese, and added mushrooms instead of tomatoes. It was the first time we had made pizzas on the grill but it won't be the last!

I thought this was great! The BBQ sauce I used was sweet and spicy. A perfect compliment to the BBQ flavoured rotisserie chicken I used. I followed all the ingredients and amounts but added a little red onion and red pepper to it. The pizza dough I had was not working for me, no matter what I did it had holes and it fell apart, so last minute I ran out and got a pre-made crust as all my fillings were ready and waiting! Here in Canada the only cheese I could find was a mild Mexicana blend with Colby, Jack and Cheddar cheese. Besides the red onion and red pepper I don't think I'd add anything else, it's perfect. Great for a summer time cook-out!

This was a family win!  All of my kids, ages 1-13 plus hubs, my mother AND MIL LOVED this dinner!  I used Wegmans brand brown sugar BBQ sauce and did not have enough to add the smear directly onto the grilled crust but it was just the right amount of sauce for this picky crew.  I pan fried the chicken tenderloins with just olive oil, salt, and pepper then marinated the cooled chicken after tearing it apart for a good 5 hours.  I also added red onion because it's my favorite.  Perfect dinner for a busy momma!

This is a genius idea! I made the recipe as written, except we cooked it on a perforated bbq pan instead of directly on the grill. That way I was able to take the pan back to the kitchen to add the remaining ingredients instead of at the barbecue. Oh, one more change - I caramelized a yellow onion and added that on top of the other ingredients. We loved it, and can't wait to try this again and mix it up a bit! Thanks so much for the recipe!

i am no longer a "grilled pizza" virgin! LOL i made this recipe as part of an Allstar Challlenge. i made two...the bbq chicken recipe, almost as the recipe is written, the other a more traditional one as far as toppings go. the bbq chicken pizza, was a suprising hit. i have to admit i was a bit leary, as i am a traditional kinda gal when it comes to pizza. Pepperoni, mushrooms, green pepper and if i'm feeling adventurous....*gasp* onions!!! but i took one for the team and forged ahead way out of my comfort zone regarding method AND toppings and was quite pleasantly suprised. i used the Blue Ribbon bbq sauce which has a nice kick to it. i didn't have colby/jack cheese, so i used montereyy jack and little bit of old white cheddar for a bit of zing. i also made my own pizza dough. it seemed like a lot of work, but that may be because i was way out of my comfort zone. i really believe that this pizza is as good as the bbq sauce you use, and the one i used is AMAZING! next time, to save a little work...i will try using whole wheat as the crust.

This is so delicious!! It was my first attempt at pizza on the bbq, and wow my mind is now racing with all of the possibilities! I used whole wheat pita bread for the crust and it was amazing. Will be making this again for sure!

I made this pizza for dinner and we loved it! I used Blue Ribbin' Sweet Sauce BBQ sauce, and the end result was loved by adults and kids a like. I did make a few changes though...I added red onion and goat cheese and removed the tomatoes (kiddo's don't ike them) - needless to say, the pizza is also versatile with respect to the toppings.
