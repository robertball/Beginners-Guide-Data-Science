Great chutney recipe. Not as heavy and acidic as some chutneys can be. I have used this chutney with cold meats and also tried it with cheese in a sandwich as an experiment (worked really well!). I would reccomend however, letting this chutney sit in fridge for a while - i left mine for 3 months. All good chutneys need to mature. I found it too sour and vinegary when freshly made.

It has a wonderful taste and smell that lasted till the last spoonful.  I made mine for the B-day party and leftovers kept in the frige for a week (till we ate them all).  The only thing that i wish for is better color/appearance, but then again maybe i cooked it too much.  Will make it again for sure.  Thank you for sharing this nice recipe.

This is just what I was looking for to brighten up simple dinners and sandwiches.  Great way to use the bountiful harvest.  One reviewer mentioned letting it 'ripen' for 2-3 mos.  Could this also be canned? i'm thinking it would be a great hostess gift for the holidays.  Or is it not necessary to can because of the vinegar??

Great recipe, my husband loves it. For my taste, the peach taste is not prominent enough, but it still is a very good sauce.
