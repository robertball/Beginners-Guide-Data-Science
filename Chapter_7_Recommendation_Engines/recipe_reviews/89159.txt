Liked it a lot!  Next time I make it I'll probably modify it and use less beef broth and more condensed soup.

Different. It was good though. 
I used 1/2 cup broth, instead. Hubby liked it. The only thing was the sausage was more overpowering which took out the mushroom-flavor of an regular Stroganoff. Will make again.

Awesome and Super Fast!! Cooked from start to finish in 20 min. Added 1 tsp garlic powder and used cream cheese instead of sour cream. It came out perfect.

Tasty weeknight supper.  To make it stretch farther, I mixed the sauce right in with the noodles and served it as a casserole.  Someone mentioned the sauce was runny - not at all!  It was perfect.

Great basic recipe. Helpful changes: (1) 1/2 lb of sausage and 1/2 lb ground chuck instead of 1lb sausage; (2) 1 Tbsp flour added to meat after it is drained to thicken sauce; (3) 1/2 c of beef broth rather than 1 c plus 1/2 tsp of beef boullion to increase flavor without making it so watery; (4) sauteed onions added (to taste preference). Result: more balanced flavor, thicker sauce. Will definitely make again.

This was missing the hearty tang that I am used to with stroganoff. I'm not sure why. I did reduce the broth by 1/2 as per other posts and I am glad I did.  I suggest adding onions and garlic at the meat stage. I sprinkled in some paprika, as that is what is in traditional stroganoff.

Made some changes, but this was really good! Added onions, fresh mushrooms and substituted yogurt for sour cream.

I thought this recipe was very good. I omited half of the beef broth and used ground beef instead. I also added some Mrs.dash garlic and herb seasoning. Very easy to make if your in a time crunch!

i made this recipe tonight for dinner and i really loved it.  however, i did modify it a little.  first, i used fresh mushrooms; they have a better flavor in my opinions.  second, i added onions.  otherwise, i left the recipe as is and it is delicious.  i did not think it was bland or boring and would definitely make it again!

I thought this was very good. I will omit the beef broth or reduce to 1/2 C. next time so that it's thicker. Or maybe use cream cheese instead of sour cream.

So quick. So easy. So tasty. I used mashed potatoes instead of noodles, but either would be great. Rice would also be delicious. When you are in a hurry, but still want great taste, this recipe is perfect.

Very soupy, would use half the broth next time, and I used chicken broth, the flavor was excellent.  Also added an onion to the sausage while browning it.

My 5 year old gave this recipe a 10 thumbs up, and my 6 year old asked for 4 helpings! This was so easy to make, that the sauce was ready by the time I had the noodles cooked. To save time on a busy day, I mixed the noodles and sauce together and put them in a casserole dish, then put it in the oven with the delay timer on and it was ready for us when we got home. Some of the reviewers said it was bland, some even mention the 'kielbasa'. I can only think that they used the wrong sausage. This actually calls for a roll of breakfast sausage, it if you use what it calls for it's amazingly flavorful!

This is a great dish!!! The only thing we did different was used spicy sausage and a sage mix sausage(added onions and crushed garlic to the meat while it browned), 1/2 of the beef broth and doubled the Worcestershire sauce, and we are a mushroom fan so we doubled the mushrooms.

My family loved this! I thought it was so-so, but I am giving it the 5 stars on behalf of my family that devoured the entire dish! They said it was yummy! Did I mention I have four picky kids? It was also so very easy to prepare. I would recommend this if you are looking for a very fast family friendly dish that your kids will enjoy.

This recipe was great!! Totally different from the norm!  I make beef strogonoff a lot with beef.... but my family just gobbled this one up with the sausage.... I used a sausage I had made with brocolli rabe in this recipe.... it was amazing. I also used fresh mushrooms and added some cooking sherry while cooking..... and served over egg noodles with some steamed veggies.... this is a recipe u must try and u can invert different things with it if u like.  A Keeper!!

This was excellent.  I grew up with my mom making beef stroganoff, but I have to say this is just as good (dont't tell my mom that though)!  My husband got some pig sausage from a friend, so I was looking for a way to use it up, this was perfect.

Yummers! This was very tasty. We felt it was the sauce that really makes this good so we substituted the stated sausage with what we had in the fridge “Sausages by Amy” (Apple & Gouda cheese chicken sausages) from Costco and used low fat sour cream. It turned out wonderfully. We will definitely make this recipe again.

Easy and good, will probably make this again. I did not have any mushrooms in the house, used fresh green peppers and onions instead.

Absolutely loved this recipe.  It is easy and fast to make.  This recipe is also very versatile and any kind of sausages should work here.  I had done the following we loved onions and fresh mushrooms so in a little oil I fried them up.  I used bratwurst sausages which what I had so removed the casting and crumbled into the same pan.  After I allowed the recipe to simmer for a bit I added about 1 tsp of Italian seasoning.  will be making this again.

This was great!  I skipped the canned soup and made my own roux with beef broth.  I omitted the mushrooms entirely (though I would have liked them, I'm out numbered) - it is a wonderful recipe and all 4 picky kids plus hubby loved it.  Next time, Ima double this bad boy!  Thanks so much for submitting :)

I just made a few adjustments to make it easier for me. First, I used ground deer meat instead of sausage. Instead of the canned mushrooms I used 1/2 a package of fresh mushrooms and pureed them into the sauce. I also used cream of celery instead of cream of mushroom. It came out fantastic! I will definitely make this again!

This was quick and easy.  The flavor was OK and we'll probably make again on busy weeknights.  Next time I'll add onions to boost the flavor a bit.

I like this pretty good.  It is good to make with hot sausage.  I wouldn't mind trying fresh mushrooms.  I dont pay good attention about exact measurements.   I put some chicken broth instead of beef cuz it was all I had.    What if you put some cheese in it?   I used egg noodles.  What about that?  I put some garlic powder and some paprika.  My bff put more pepper on it which I thought was weird, but she quit smoking.   Now she uses lots of seasonings.   hahahaha!    Yeah!

Super simple and budget friendly!  I threw in onions, garlic, paprika and dried parsley.  I would make this again in a pinch and I can see how this dish would be kid-friendly!

YES!!  We used equal parts of stock and sour cream, added paprika, dash of cayenne for a little spice, and no soup as we didn't have any on hand. Also added a bit of grated parmesan to thicken. We used rigatoni pasta and meatballs!! Thanks everyone for the suggestions!!

Fantastic! The only thing i did different was saute onions and garlic before adding the pork (kielbasa). It was a little thin but stuck well with the egg noodles. definately a keeper!   FYI- For those who are concerned about the sodium intake, most of the items it asked for come in reduced sodium. Thats what I used and I feel it did not hurt the recipe at all. I also used "reduced fat" it items that had it avalable.

have never left a review before, but this recipe warranted one!!
This was great, my husband and kids all give it 5 stars.  I did change it up a bit, used 1 tbsp of worcestershire sause and 2/3 cup of beef stock.  Will definitely make this again!

The recipe was a bit small for a family of four...but doubling the recipe (not quite doubling the noodles) the second time around was perfect.  My stepsons were a bit skeptical when they saw the dish, but they both loved it.  Easy dish for a busy night.

My husband & I thought this was great.  I kicked it up a bit by using Hot Italian Sausage in place of regular sausage.  It was really worked.  We call it italian stroganoff.

I tried this recipe because I was craving something hearty like stroganoff, and this recipe looked promising. I was wrong. I just wasted money on the groceries, my time spend cooking it, and the time spent eating it. I am granting it two stars because it at least tasted something like stroganoff should taste like, but nothing more. I even skimped on the broth due to other reviews but it was still too thin and weak. I chose this recipe because it looked fast, but do yourself a favor and make the real thing.

I have a son that will eat nothing, picks at everything.  He took a 2nd helping(the first was big)and said "I love this stuff, now this is dinner"  I'm making it tonight for the 2nd time and doubling the recipe because it was a family favorite.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was just ok for me.  Not quite what I expected.  I had expected the pasta to have a bit more flavor, but found it to be on the blander side. Both my husband I rate it a "3."

This is one of our favorites. However, after making several times we changed it a bit.  I use 1/2 package cream cheese instead of sour cream. We don't like mushrooms, so we add frozen peas at the end and cook till warm. Adds a little sweet crunch.  YUM!

Instead of canned soup, made a roux, then added the beef broth to make a simple sauce/gravy.  Also used sliced fresh mushrooms, cooked in with the sausage, along with a little sliced onion and minced garlic.  Fabulous!

We thought we'd like this recipe. We like all the ingredients in it...but when mixed together, they made for an odd combo. It was the sausage. Tasted pretty strange in there. Edible, though. The kids gobbled it up, haha! 
It was a really quick meal. I'd make it again...but with ground beef instead of sausage.

I did everything the recipe said and the sauce came out runny like soup. After my fiancé added corn starch to thicken it, it was thicker, but it tasted terrible. Again, my fiancé had to come along and season it, but it couldn't be saved.
I guess I'm used to my Chef fiancé's cooking, but being a new cook, I wanted to try to whip up something fast & easy.
It was fast, it was easy, but it wasn't tasty.
I have a lot left over.
I will NOT be making this again!
