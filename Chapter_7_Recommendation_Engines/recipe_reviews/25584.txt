This is very good. My mom LOVED it! I will make a couple changes next time I make it. For the sauce, I'll cut down on the amount of sugar, maybe 1/4 c. instead of 1/2 c. Because although the sauce is very good, the sweetness of it overpowered the cake, and I couldn't even taste the apples. I also think I'll reduce the cinnamon from 1 1/2 t. to just 1 t. Plus, I would suggest adding a dollip of whip cream to the individual slices or serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. To cut some of the sweetness of the cake. This one goes in my recipe box.

All I have to say is wow! This cake is delicious. I used red harry & david apples and it came out wonderful. I was fearful it was going to turn out like a fruit cake but I added the full amt of walnuts and raisins anyway. The topping is the best part so do not skip it! I followed someone's suggestion and only used a 1/4 cup of each sugar. I believe it would overpower the taste of the apples otherwise.  I thought the amt of butter in the topping was unnecessary so I only used a 1/4 cup. Pour all of the topping onto the cake. It tastes great warm and even better once it sets. A day later and there's only one piece left. Definitely a keeper.

This cake is great.  Here are my hints:

First, dice the apples.

Second, to make this cake in a 9 x 13 pan, double the "cake" part and 1 1 /2 times the icing.  This takes care of the icing being too sweet or overpowering.

This cake can easily be made vegan by subbing in soy milk for milk and 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce for each egg.

Very easy to make. It is fabulous but the icing is too sweet. Use Granny Smiths which not only hold their shape but add some tartness. The icing is important and shouldn't be skipped, but reducing it by half wouldn't be a bad idea. Plumping the raisins is nice and not mincing or chopping the apples too fine is good for texture. The icing does set and the next day it is firmer. Overall not expensive to make and absolutely worth making a second time, etc.

I made this dessert for a German party and it was a huge hit!  I doubled the cake and used a 9x13 pan.  I made 1 1/2 times the glaze and it was perfect.  Don't scrimp on the walnuts and raisins, even if it seems like too many!

PHENOMENAL!  I was so skeptical when mixing the batter- I had diced 3 small granny smith apples and it seemed the batter was mostly apple with very little dough.  I told my husband dessert was going to be crappy.  Let me just say I was so wrong!  It was nothing to look at when it came out of the oven, but with that frosting (don't skip the frosting!) it was so delicious.  It was the two of us and the pan was gone in 24 hours. I would make this again, especially for morning coffee- it's just as good out of the fridge as it is out of the oven.

This is the best apple dessert I have found.  If you're tired of apple crisp or apple pie then definitely try this one.  I used sweet apples so I reduced the sugar in the cake to 3/4 cup and omitted the raisins in the topping but kept them in the cake.  Absolutely delicious!

I've made lots of cakes from Allrecipes.com and this one is amazingly great!  I didn't know what to expect based on the picture but mine was beautiful.  The caramel-like topping was a little more than I needed- I had leftovers.  I used walnut halves sprinkled over the cake and poured the sauce over them.  I used apple pie mixed spices instead of just cinnamon.  I left out the raisins since I'm not a big fan, but it was just wonderful tasting and very easy to make.

I followed the suggestions of several reviewers and I reduced the sugar to 3/4 and the cinnamon to 1 t in the cake.  I also halved the topping.  Next time I would also leave out the raisins in both the cake and the topping.  The cake is already very sweet and I don't think it needs the additional sweetness of the raisins.

I made the mistake of following the recipe as writteing and and not heeding the advie of others. I agree that it is much too sweet (too much sugar and raisins). I would cut the cake sugar in half at least and 1/4 the icing & raisin amount in and on the cake. It overshadows the apples and it's much too rich and sweet with not enough cake. However, many of my friends did like it as is and asked for the recipe.

Really good dessert.  The method is unusual but it works like a charm.  I reduced the sugar in the cake and sauce.  Next time I'm going to bake for 35 min., my oven must be hot.

Very good cake, nice and moist.  I soaked the raisins first to plump them up.  For the topping, I mixed a can of swetened condensed milk with a little cinnamon and finely chopped walnuts and poured it over the still hot cake.  Delicious!

I was very disappointed in this recepie. Maybe my concept of Apple Cake is different then the person who submitted the this but with only 1 cup of flour and 1 egg I felt that it was not enough for a cake. I followed it exactly as written but the "cake" was very dry mostly apples, nuts and raisins and the topping never did thicken. Will not try this again. Sorry.

This recipe was fantastic!  The cake is incredibly easy to make, and the moisture and flavor is incredible!  I wouldn't change a thing!  I used a crisp apple like Graventstein (German, of course) and it tasted amazing!  I would stick to the square baking dish, though--it is so rich, you can serve small pieces and people will still enjoy it.

Although the concept of this recipe is very good, I was disappointed with the quality.  I did take the advice of previous reviewers and cut the amount of sugar by half in the sauce part ( I used only brown sugar and omitted the white sugar for a more caramel- like flavor)  However, 1 egg to 1 cup of flour for the batter portion did not work, there is not enough liquid in the batter portion to absorb the flour, I added another egg, but found that it was still very dry and tough when baked.  I was surprised not to see this mentioned by other viewers.  This recipe requires some "tweaking" before it can be a "keeper".

This had a nice flavour but was too sweet for my liking.  It definately needed vanilla icecream and less sugars.  To me it tasted like a very sweet muffin.  Would not make it again.

I have to admit I expected sometg a little different. I like the cake by itself but I do not care for sauce. It was way too much and too sweet even though I reduced sugar in cake by 1/2 cup and in topping by 1/4 cup. My mom used to make similar cake to this, but she shredded the apples, which gave it more moisture. When it was done she spread some preserves on top. I might try her version with this rec next time.

I wanted to use up some left over Granny smiths and thought this recipe sounded good. We had it for dessert tonight and it's almost been eaten already! I did not even make the topping, but it was still wonderful. Simple, light, and not too sweet.

I doubled the recipe to fit in a 9 by 13 pan.  I was a little worried because the batter was  dry and also it didn’t call for salt in the cake or sauce but I followed the recipe.  I used all the sauce (doubled it) and I’m glad I did as it soaked down into the cake and made it real moist.  Anyway, I loved the cake and will continue doubling it.  Oh, I had to bake it longer checking every 5 minutes.  I took it out when there was just a few crumbs on the knife I stuck in the center.  I could tell it wasn’t a wet dough but moist crumbs - better to under  than over bake it - allow for residual bake time.

It was very sweet. I made a lemon glaze to pour over the caramel glaze to temper the sweetness. Didn't really taste the apples very much, and I had put in a little more than called for.
However, the next day, it all seemed to blend better, got more pudding-y. I was looking for a sort of gooey cake/pudding type of thing, which this more or less turned into. Next time I'll make 1/2 of the topping, and maybe add lemon zest or extract both in the cake and the glaze.  (Lemon zest can improve almost anything! I think it "brightens" the flavors)

I have made this many times and we really like it but this last time I made it I realized I was out of raisins so I used dried cranberries instead.  It is very sweet and the tartness of the cranberries were a nice contrast to the sweetness.  From now on I will always use cranberries.

I read most of the reviews of this cake before attempting - I used 4 small Granny Smith apples, 1 teas of cinnamon (but I think 1.5 would have been better) and 1/2 the topping and it was excellent - the topping was not too sweet and was enough to give the cake a moist texture.  I made it for friends and they raved about it.  My husband has said it is his favorite cake now.

I actually had a friend make this recipe for thanksgiving, and I had to ask for the recipe. What she had done though was make the butter mixture and then put that on the bottom and then scooped the batter out on top of it. This allowed the sauce to soak more into the cake as it was cooking. One thing I force myself to keep as a holiday recipe so I don't get fat making it all the time :)

Oh my gosh, this is good!  It's so easy to make, and so chewy and good!  I cut back a little on the sugar in the sauce, other than that, made it just as is.  Perfect with hot coffee and vanilla ice cream.  This is worth making!

It was really good even without raisins and walnuts in the topping. I found in the cake alone the walnut was overpowering. Anyway it was tasty. Thank you!

This cake was delicious but did take the suggestions of other
reviews and reduced the amount of sugar to 3/4 cup of sugar and chopped the apples. It was nice and moist!
