Delicious!! Try using Sriracha salt, it gives the sandwich a hint of spice and garlic. I doused it in hot sauce but it is indulgently delicious as written. There is a slight discrepancy in step three regarding the bread. Regardless, hindsight taught me that next time I will put both slices of bread -butter side up-in the same pan I used to cook the egg (without wiping it out). Then, I'll flip one over, layer the ingredients and top with the other bread slice, butter side up. Then flip the whole sandwich. Because the sides that weren't  toasted were soggy. 
Thank you for the recipe.

Used Muenster cheese instead of cheddar because my kids arenâ€™t bug fans. It turned out great and I got two thumbs up! Will definitely be making this again.

This dish was bland to me.  I think adding bacon would help.

Very tasty and healthy as well! I didn't have any swiss cheese so I used old cheddar and added chopped onion for some added punch. Turned out really well!

This was amazing!  The one change i made was to use guacamole, didn't have any avocados left.  I'll have to try it with just an avocado next time, but i'm pretty sure i'm gonna do the guacamole version again as well.

Thanks for sharing this!

My execution of the ingredients was not very good but the end result was very tasty.  I didn't have Swiss cheese, just sharp cheddar and my avocado was too ripe so I smashed it and spread it on the bread, along with the other ingredients.  Both my hubby and I really liked this sandwich but the way I made it, I think it would be better as an open- faced sandwich.  Definitely a good recipe to try again.

I used 2 slices of marble rye bread and the cheese I had on hand Monterey Jack and Vermont sharp cheddar.  I fried the eggs on a griddle over my stove using my little veg oil then layered the buttered bread and layered egg, cheese and avocado.  It was delicious!

I made it a "Three Cheese" Egg and Avocado Sandwich:  I just added a third cheese (Muenster) on top of the second slice and then piled on the ingredients as instructed.  It helped to hold the avocado chunks in the place too.   I used whole grain wheat bread and it was killer.

Excellent sandwich! I used multi-grain sour dough bread and only one egg. Would never think to add avocado to a sandwich like this, but it works really  well here. I had it for lunch, and it is very filling. Thanks for the easy recipe!

Skip going out for breakfast! This is awesome! I did mash up my avocado with some garlic and onion powder. Otherwise I made it as written.

Having been sick I didn't feel like going out to eat or to the grocery store.  I was getting my appetite back so I happened upon this recipe.  No Italian bread so I substituted honey oat...it was great!!  Five stars in my book!!!!!

Wow!  That was good stuff!!!  Hard to find good breakfast recipes for 1.  Only had swiss cheese and whole wheat bread, but still delicious!  I never realized avocado would go so good in an egg and cheese sandwich.

Only needs one egg
Can get by with half the cheese
More salt & pepper
Some chili sauce would also be good

Will have hubby make again for sure. You don't need all the egg. We used 3 eggs which was plenty.  Next time we'll try some bacon & only use 2 eggs. We didn't have Swiss cheese so used Gruyere which I think I'd stick with now with the Cheddar cheese. Hubby did say he'll mash the avocado though because with it sliced it slid all over trying to come out from inside the bread.

This is a pretty hearty meal. I will definitely make it again as it fits as a very good lazy weekend meal/brunch. I did not have Swiss cheese so I had to use GruyÃ¨re and really it gave it a mild tangyness to the whole dish.

Loved it; thank you first of all! My bit of change was using a spicy avocado mix, which gave me my kick. As well I used cinnamon raisin bread and it was quite filling.
