So delicious!!! The veggies are perfectly caramelized and seasoned. I did find the cook time was a little long - my veggies were done after 30 mins. I also ended up using only half the herb butter, so you may want to make half. This will make the perfect side dish over the holidays. Vibrant colors are always a nice addition to your plate.

Only need to cook about 30 minutes.  Herb butter is excellent!

I made changes!   I have a garlic and onion intolerance so I used a garlic infused olive oil, cut the veggies thin, and it baked in less time.  Was DeLish!   Thanks for the spice suggestions!

My family loved this and I will definitely be making it again. I didn't have rosemary so I left it and used dehydrated chives instead of fresh. I have never eaten parsnips before and thought it was delish!

They were ok. Parsnips tend to cook faster than carrots. Might put them in after carrots have cooked for 5-10 mins. Colour was nice. Flavour was all right. Nothing out of the ordinary. Prefer roasted in butter and honey.
