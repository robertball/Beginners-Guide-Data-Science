The recipe is sooo good! And unlike some people, I took the liberty of changing that 1/2 cup of salt to 1/2 tsp of salt instead of leaving a bad review...definitely uncalled for.

This was a very good recipe. I used two tablespoons more puree however, in the hopes that it would impart sufficient strawberry flavor. Bang.

This was the best cookie ever!
I used 1/2 tsp of salt as suggested, and it had the perfect sweet salty combo. It reminds me of cookies I bought from the bakery when I was younger... I ate the whole dozen in a day

I loved the recipe the cookies were wonderful... But I must say to the woman who said it set her fire alarm off... Maybe you should try cleaning your oven or here is an idea take the cookies out before they burn .  Can't blame the recipe for a novice baker...

I was hoping for a stronger strawberry flavor, but these are really good cookies anyway! I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the strawberry puree. The strawberry is still subtle but the cookie is good. I think next time I will make extra puree and reserve and mix with some confectioners sugar to make a strawberry glaze on top to make the strawberry flavor pop even more.

Thank you everyone for your reviews. I'm not sure what you are talking about with the 1/2 cup of salt because it says 1/2 teaspoon maybe you looked at the sugar by mistake. I'm glad that most of you liked it and hope more people try it and like it as well.

Very nice, chewy cookie.  The strawberry flavor was evident but it still tasted like a good quality sugar cookie.  I made two changes: I subbed whole-wheat flour for half of the flour called for.  If anything, that might have made the cookies more difficult to appreciate,  the texture was perfect.  My other change was to refrigerate the dough overnight before putting on the sheets and baking.  IMO, that is always the way to go w/ cookie dough whether the recipe calls for it or not.

02-22-19 Update: Made these again today and this time they look beautiful! The dough was still sticky but now I know how to roll and flatten them. 
They're definitely not the prettiest cookies I have made! But they taste pretty good. I doubled the strawberry puree as suggested by other reviewers.  My dough was extremely sticky. I was unable to roll them so I used a cookie scoop and sprayed my fingers with Pam and flattened them out after sprinkling them with red sugar.

Wonderful!  I must have made small cookies, though, as I got 5 dozen 2 1/2 inchers.  I used Polaner strawberry instead of using real ones, but they are fantastic.  I can't wait to try this with other fruits, too.  I bought blackberry and cherry with the strawberry, so I'm good to go.

Double amount of strawberry puree.  Add a little extra flour to compensate.  Dough is very sticky!  Chill in fridge for at least an hour before rolling into balls.  Roll balls in sugar and press down slightly on pan before baking.

Admittedly, I was a little skeptical when my 7 year old decided he wanted to make strawberry cookies. I imagined a very artificial tasting end result. I was so pleased to find this recipe using fresh strawberries. I was still skeptical as baking with fresh fruit does change it's flavor. I am so pleased with how they turned out! We used frozen strawberries instead of fresh and it was fine. The strawberry taste is subtle but true; not overpowering at all. In fact, I think I will add a little extra purée the next time we make these. This recipe is a keeper!

As another viewer said they used strawberry jam as a substitute for the strawberry puree.  It was so good!  I used homemade strawberry jam, and the recipe is a keeper.

I just finished making it and it was superb: crunchy on the sides yet very chewy on the inside. I followed the recipe as is except for the strawberry part. I live in a tropical country so what I have is the mango-pineapple jam. And it taste heavenly! My daughter played with it by putting marshmallow on top and confectionary sugar in some. Will definitely make again and will experiment more. Thanks!

These cookies are awesome! I’ve made three batches now. I’m not a big butter person, so I halved the butter, and upped the strawberry purée to 3/4 cup. Will likely up it to 1 cup next time. I also rolled them in sugar, mostly to make the dough easier to work with, super sticky.

The consistency of the batter was perfect. I couldn't taste the strawberries, however, and I was hoping to. I may try again and alter the recipe for more strawberry puree....

I've made these as written and with 5T of strawberry puree. Both are very good. Obviously, increasing the puree gave a stronger strawberry flavor. These were popular with my kids and at a party I brought them to. I used a scant half teaspoon of salt and pureed frozen strawberries.

This is our new favorite homemade cookie! I rolled balls slightly larger than 1" in diameter and ended up with 54 cookies (4 1/2 dozen). Next time I will aim to net 5 dozen, as I think that cookie size is perfect. Chilling in the fridge for about 20 mins made it less sticky. The sugar mixture was twice what was needed, even with 54 cookies! I saved the rest for next time. Don't be tempted to add more sugar on top of the cookies; it makes them too sweet.  I made fresh puree last time and froze the rest. I simply thawed about 1/3 cup and added it to this recipe along with 2 extra teaspoons of flour. I wanted more strawberry flavor. These are just perfect! Thank you!

Definitely would make again, added a lot more strawberry puree to give more flavour. We also made a dent in the middle of the dough with our thumbs and filled it with the strawberry puree and they were a hit. Baked the same as the recipe states. So Awesome!!!

I really loved this. I added some cream cheese when i was beating the butter/sugar and it really increased the chewyness. i also infused some black Almond tea and threw on some matcha icing and my coworkers devoured them! 12/10 would definitely recommend

I added more strawberry puree, and instead of rolling the cooie dough in sugar, I put sliced strawberry on the top and they turned out amazing

Would make again! Great for using up a small amount of strawberries. Parents loved them. I also liked them, and I HATE strawberries!

Everyone in the family, from my 3-year-old granddaughters to my 78-year-old husband, loved the strawberry taste and chewiness of these cookies.  And they are easy to make.

I like this recipe because it doesn't call for alot of sugar. I also like that it uses real fruit for flavoring instead of artificial flavoring. I haven''t made them yet, but when I do I will  use whole wheat flour instead of all-purppose. Using  all purpose flour is basically the same as sugar and has the same metabolic effect. Sugar & highly refined foods is the driving force behind most of today's chronic diseases also called metabolic diseases (diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, high cholesterol etc.)

These cookies were great. I followed the recipe with only two changes. I only had strawberry preserves on hand, used 4tsp, which was plenty. I also added chocolate chips. Very tasty. Thanks for sharing!

So good! Added a little more strawberry -- still didn't taste as strawberry-ish as I would have liked, but the cookies were phenomenal anyway! Big hit!

This is a great recipe. I couldn't find red sugar here in southern Italy, so I used sprinkles instead. Also I doubled the amount of strawberry puree to six tablespoons. For me, even this was not enough as I love the taste of strawberries! Very moist and not overly sweet. It's a very easy recipe that requires very little cleanup. Definitely my new go to cookie recipe.

I used 5 tbs freshly puréed strawberries. Yummy! Very pretty and a refreshing update on the plain sugar cookie. Will definitely make again!

Flavor is great, but the dough is very sticky. Maybe more flour, but I'm not good at monkeying with baking recipes.

These are great cookies. Although I too increased the amount of strawberry puree, the strawberry flavor was very subtle.  Seems like a regular sugar cookie. Still very yummy!

These cookies were sweet, but I did not think they had enough strawberry to them. I upped the puree to 5 tbsp.'s as one reviewer said they increased it to, but still seemed very bland.
