Surprisingly good! The recipe was so interesting I had to try it.  I used two cups all purpose flour so I added 1 Tb baking powder and 1 tsp salt to make it self rising.  Otherwise I followed the directions exactly.  I used miller light since it's the cheapest stuff we have on hand.  They turned out nicely golden and lightly crisp, we loved it.  Especially since our George Forman waffle grill has a hard time cooking waffles well.  Very easy recipe and will try it again.

By far the best waffles I have ever made.  Perfect crunch. These waffles have become our new Saturday morning tradition.    I used sour cream instead of milk to make them extra crispy and it was great!  This recipe is fool proof!  This recipe works best with a high quality iron.

After making these several times, I recommend using Miller High Life beer.  It is super bubbly so the waffles are very fluffy and the beer flavor completely disappears.  I tried using a honey weiss, a heavy amber bock and a lite beer.  Also, a very small amount of cinnamon and these are better than any waffles my family and I have ever had!

I did the + 1Tbsp Baking Powder & + 1tsp salt to make my all purpose flour self rising.  This recipe results in a super light waffle.  When mixing, I stirred by hand and I was very careful to not over stir so they aren't tough.  You can definitely smell the beer when you're cooking it, but eating it you do not taste the beer.  I used a regular beer the first go around and after that cheap beer purchased for the recipe, always warm beer though, I think that helps with it being fluffy.  Super yum! Edit- Try stirring in chopped ham and shredded cheese and serving with salsa, amazing!

Did not like these at all.  The batter was easy to make, but was very thin and needed to use almost 1 1/2 cups of batter in my waffle iron (busquick batter only uses 1/4 cup).  I used Labatt Blue Light beer and the waffles came out very bitter and tasteless despite adding an additional tablespoon of honey to the batter.  I could not get the waffles to crisp at all.  I had higher hopes for this recipe, but sadly I will not make these again.

These were so light and fluffy with a delicately crunchy outside!  We loved them!  I didn't have butter on hand, so I used canola oil.  I also increased the honey to about 1 and 1/2 TBS.  They were delicious!

I made these last night using Shiner Ruby Redbird, which is a grapefruit and ginger beer from here in Texas, and they've definitely become my go to insert-beverage-here waffles. 

Using a brand new waffle maker of unexplored abilities, the outsides were nice and crisp and the insides were soft and fluffy. 

I got ten 4 x 4 Belgian style waffles using slightly more than 1/4 cup per waffle. Textures inside and out were perfect - this is without beating the egg whites, and halving the butter.

I think anything Belgian/white/wheat/lighter/not things college kids drink would be tasty in this waffle. 

You could definitely smell the beer as they were cooking, and the flavor came through a bit, but not so much as to be overwhelming.

Deliciously flavorable!  Agreed that these aren't so crunchy, but I'll work on that.  Only change I made was to add a teaspoon of cinnamon.  I used Straub Beer, a small brewery in St. Mary's, PA, which uses natural ingredients and no preservatives.  It is a lightish beer.  I didn't have any syrup on hand, so I decided to  work with what I had on hand that one collects to be creative with--now was the time.  I heated some peach-rhubarb jam in the microwave and threw some pomegranate seeds  on top.  Fab!

Made these as directed.  Mine were not crisp but very limp.  There was a slight aftertaste.  I added more honey and it improved the flavor a bit.  I won't make these again

Pretty darn good.  AND I got to have the fun of shocking everyone as to the main ingredient.  A side note... its a great way to use up beer that no one liked.

I hate to rate this so low, it gets a star because they were edible and another star because of the ease of the recipe, but these were not at all crispy even after putting them directly on the oven rack, nothing would toast or crisp these up. They also had a weird taste, I think it was a remnant of the beer, my dd said they tasted like bananas. Overall not good.

Great recipe.  I used to use a similar one using Bisquick but didn't have any.  The only changes I made were making my own self-rising flour (2 cups flour, 2 1/2 t baking powder, 1/2 t salt),  reducing the butter to 1/4 cup, and did not separate the eggs.  Will definitely become my standard

INCREDIBLY EASY & TASTY! Self-rising flour can be made on your own. For every CUP of flour, add 1 1/2 tsp Baking Powder + 1/2 tsp salt - and just whisk together well in a separate bowl. If you're concerned about the rise, for every cup, take out 2 tsp of the finished mixture. This was my first time "beating eggs until stiff white peaks form" and I was successful! It does make a difference in the recipe as it gives it that extra "oomph".
   For the egg whites, make sure they are at room temperature, & mix them specifically in a glass or copper bowl (egg whites for white peaks form better this way). Make sure the glass/copper bowl you are using is absolutely clear of any oils or any water as it will be difficult to form these peaks! To help with the process in the beginning, you can use a pinch of salt to strengthen those proteins, and whisk away quickly! This might take some time, but you should notice many bubbles forming, and it'll actually start to turn white. About half way through mixing, add only a drop or two of some sort of acid, such as lemon juice or vinegar will do. Keep whisking. Look for photos of "egg whites stiff white peaks". It should almost begin to look like whip cream. This was slightly tiresome as I did this by hand, my electric hand mixer was too loud to use in the morning. Lastly, I used "Pyramid Haywire Hefeweizen" beer. I poured it in slowly and it immediately begin to bubble, but that's normal. when pouring into flour I suppose. Everything was great!

with 4 starving kids, I was looking for a quick recipe that didn't call for much milk.  The waffles turned out great, even though I took the shortcut of not separating the eggs.  I had frozen blueberries which added a nice taste.  Very good for a quick meal!

THE BEST!!! I've been looking for the perfect waffle recipe for a long time - crispy on the outside & light and fluffy in the inside.  I've tried a LOT of recipes and this was IT!! Love it. I subbed in AP flour with baking powder and salt for the self-rising. Turned out so well. Thank you so so much!!!

Very interesting! not that crunchy, but this can be helped if the honey was increased. the beer flavor really does seem to disappear, so don't be shy to try this recipe. It's easy, and I'll probably launch my own variations of this using different carbonated drinks...

The wife and I tried this today.  We did not have self rising flour, so I, as suggested in other reviews, we added 1tsp of salt and one 1tbsp baking powder.  We used sour cream instead of milk.  For the beer we used Boulder Brewing' Chocolate Shake.  A bit of the chocolate flavor came through.  If the 5 stars didn't giver it away already, this recipe is fantastic.  The waffles turned out amazing.  We used a thin n crispy waffle iron for ours, but I would imagine these would work well in a belgian waffle iron too.  I highly recommend making these.

I also followed the recipe and was disappointed when I couldn't get them to cook all the way through on my waffle iron. They were limp and soggy. I ended up taking the leftover batter and making crepes.

Absolutely the best waffle recipe that I have ever found.  Every other recipe either in the box or hand made tastes like you are eating a pancake.  These have great flavor and have a crisp sweet outer shell.  Two thumbs way up on this one...

These were not good, they were not crispy at all, the batter was thin. I used Heinekin light beer and I'm guessing that's what gave them a bad flavor. Waste of ingredients. Will not make again :(

These turned out delicious! I also used 2 cups of all purpose flour instead of the self-rising and added 1 Tb baking powder and 1 tsp of salt. I also added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and they turned out awesome. The Miller High Life beer worked perfect.

used shock top, a wheat beer and left a bitter finish after a bite.  but overall, the batter turned out beautiful and no overnighter!  use beer with less flavor.  oh and used buttermilk.

I would like to preface the below comments by saying if I were served this recipe in any resturaunt I would be very happy with what came on my plate.  I found the recipe to be lacking in any real flavor other than a lingering dull beer taste. As far as crispiness, texture and appearance this made the perfect waffle. Personally I need a little more flavor.

Great recipe. My batter was thicker than I anticipated, but there were no issues with the waffles.

needed a bit more sweetness, but otherwise a hit on the first 'at bat'. I mixed butter and oil, added baking powder and salt, and used a 12 oz can of miller lite beer (so adjusted the other ingredients). New waffle iron worked great.

Easy quick waffle.  I used coconut oil instead of butter and some kind of pineapple cider that I couldn't bring myself to drink but didn't want to waste.  I was to lazy to separate the eggs.  Long story short these were easy and tasty.

This recipe is incredibly simple and delicious. The beer we used was a coffee stout, and I had no milk so we used eggnog instead.  I didn't have to add the 12 fluid ounces of beer. More like 9 oz.  but it turned out incredible, the perfect crunch with fluffy and somewhat bubbly interior. Beautiful spiced roundness with the eggnog and coffee stout additions.  

Also I use applesauce in place of the butter, Same amount it calls for. 

A definite addition to my collection of recipes
