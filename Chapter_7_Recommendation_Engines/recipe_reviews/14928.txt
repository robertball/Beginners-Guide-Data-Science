Like another reviewer, I found the recipe as written to be merely average; but when veggies are added and the ginger ale thickened into a sauce, I'd give it 4.5 stars. The way I did it: Pour about 2 cups of gingerale into a frying pan; "saute" (technically, more like "boil") the kielbasa for a few minutes. Take out and set aside. Add sliced onions, mushrooms, and a red pepper; add enough ginger ale to cover veggies, then cover the frying pan and simmer until softened. While veggies are boiling, arrange kielbasa on a cookie sheet and add brown sugar. When veggies are softened, remove and add to cookie sheet; put the whole thing in to broil. While it's broiling, mix about 1 tbsp cornstarch with some cool ginger ale, then mix into the ginger ale still in the frying pan; boil until sauce is thickened. When the broiling is done, add veggies and kielbasa to the ginger ale sauce. Put into pitas with a squirt of honey mustard sauce, and serve.

This was surprisingly really good! I followed the directions exactly except that I reduced the amount of ginger ale to 1 cup. "Saute" isn't accurate; you let the kielbasa boil in the ginger ale until it cooks away and leaves a sweet glaze on the kielbasa; then when the brown sugar is added and broiled, it makes a sweet crust. I was really surprised! I served it with the "Honey Mustard Dressing II" from this site, which is another great recipe.

This is a great recipe! I added some sliced onions and mushrooms to the ginger ale after removing the sausage and let them cook down until the ginger ale turned into a nice, carmely glaze. I served it in pita bread with the honey mustard and it was such a hit! The recipe says serves 5 to 6, but my boyfriend and I finished it off in one sitting. I will definitely be making this again.

I used polish sausage and sliced them in half lengthwise.  Everyone loved them.  I did as one other suggested and used the gingerale left in the pan to saute onions and mushrooms, which I served over the sausage.  Served with baked potatoes and green beans.  Yummy & easy!

I followed other reviewers' advice and served this as a  main dish by putting it in a pita pocket.  I used Healthy Choice smoked sausage instead of kielbasa.  It was absolutely delicious and simple and enjoyed by the whole family.

We tried this a few nights ago and husband and I loved it.  Very flavorful.  We were making a meal of it, so I simmered onions, red bell peppers, and some asparagus in the gingerale after taking out the sausage.  I cooked onions first, until the liquid was cooked waaay down, as we like our veggies kind of crispy.  Just cooked to a nice thick sauce.  The veggies were delicious and the sausage was very tasty  As the recipe submitter said, it was a great combination of sweet and salty.  My favorite way to have sausage.  (I used the light Turkey Polish Sausage)  Will do again often, as it was so fast and easy. THANKS FOR THIS ONE!

I also took the idea to make this kielbasa with mushrooms and onions. I reduced the amount of ginger ale though. The only other suggestion I would make is that you make sure not to use a sweet honey mustard as it makes it all too sweet.

Versital & delicious! The fun part is sauteing
the veggies of your chioce in the ginger ale, before broiling with the sausage. I've used
"baby bella" mushrooms, vidalia onion, sweet red pepper, & zucchini with great success! The serving sauces can be much more than just honey mustard- although that
seems to be the best. Make a lot- and get ready for raves!

Didn't change anything. It had a good flavor and was very simple to make, perfect for a night when you need to get dinner on the table quickly. Nothing spectacular, but simple and quick. Served it with mac n' cheese.

These don't last long.  They need a bit more cooking time to get a nice crust on them.

Pretty good!  I added a bit of crushed red pepper to spice it up.  Like the previous reviewers, I added orange bell peppers and onions, and sauted the whole thing before adding the ginger ale and brown sugar.  I also put it in a toasted pita.  Good, quick supper.

Forgot to buy ginger ale but what did I find in the fridge? A beer! Tasted great as a main menu item with rice pilaf on the side. Simple recipe that tastes great.

This rating is for MY recipe that I based off of this one!!  I did not use the ginger ale at all, but here is what I did:  Right off the bat, I added sliced onion, sweet red pepper, squash, zucchini and mushrooms as well as the sliced kielbasa to a large pan.  I added a little olive oil, black pepper and garlic powder and turned the stove on high.  I made my own honey mustard sauce with dijon mustard and honey (found on this website) and I added the brown sugar to this mixture and poured it all over the meat and veg.  I let this cook (covered) on high until the veg were done, then i uncovered and browned everything.  I served this on wheat couscous!!  This was DELICIOUS!!  A keeper!!

Very good! I especially enjoyed how the brown sugar caramelized onto the kielbasa. I made it as written, and then tried it again adding onion and mushrooms and stirring in the sauce to serve over rice - as suggested by other reviewers. I preferred the way it was written. Just dipping it into the sauce. Mixing it in with everything lost that yummy brown sugar glaze.

I am not usually a big fan of sweet things, but the honey mustard mixed with the brown sugar is a good combination, not too sweet at all.  It was also so easy.

We love kielbasa cooked this way!  I also add vegetables:  sliced onion and brussel sprouts.  Sauteed in the liquid after the kielbasa, the sauce nicely balances the bitterness of the brussel sprouts and the onions are delicious.  After broiling the kielbasa and brown sugar, I toss it back in with the vegetables and reduced sauce and serve it over rice.  Heavenly!  A new comfort food at our house.  :)

Made as recipe stated, only using less ginger ale and more brown sugar.  I like the idea of using beer instead of ginger ale, because we almost always have some kind of beer around, and I couldn't taste ginger ale at all.  I like the idea of boiling down the ginger ale into a syrup, and using mushrooms (no onion, alas!), and serving in pitas.  Broiled about 4-1/2 minutes, but I think a little longer would have better to make the sugar a little more caramelized and crispy.  A keeper!  Thanks!

I love this, but my family wasn't so keen on it. I thought the flavors were great and loved the mustard sauce. ALso, if you use turkey kielbasa you can save a bit on the fat.

Very tasty! I used chicken kielbasa, and made my own honey mustard, so it would be a bit sweeter than a store bought version. Highly recommended!

This was very good.  I didn't have ginger ale so I used beer instead.  Turned out great!  I think there may be a mis-print in the recipe, 1 tsp. sugar doesn't seem like enough.  I used 1-2 tablespoons and it was very good.

At first I tried this recipe at home just for my husband and I and we loved it.  I then made it for his 30th birthday party and everyone kept raving about it, they ate it all up.  Just make sure that you keep cooking in the ginger ale until a glaze forms on the kielbasa that way the brown sugar sticks well and cooks well in the broiler.

The recipe as shown merits just 3 stars -- but the review which suggests using the liquid to cook up a mushroom & onion glaze, and then serving it all in pita bread, turns it into a 5-star meal.

Brought this to a family gathering and it went over well. It went fast. Family members asked for the recipe and were going to use it for their party too. Thanks so much for sharing

Very tasty!  A nice change for us; I usually saute kielbasa with spicy mustard and Worcestershire sauce.

This was okay.  I liked the ginger ale flavor and dipping it into honey mustard.  I happily ate it for dinner but I'm not sure I'd serve it to a group.

so easy, but I use more brown sugar - just sprinkle till some on each piece.  Has become one of my standard - take alongs because everyone who has had them before, wants them again!

I doubled this, used Healthy Choice sausage for me and kielbasa for my husband and kids.  I cooked them one at a time.  I didn't double the ginger ale, it seemed like it would have been too much...  I went with curse10 's suggestion and sliced an onion and left it to turn into carmely-saucy yummyness, which I felt made this a keeper!  I served it over rice and my kids gobbled it up.

This was simple and added another level of flavor.  We use turkey Kielbasa which doesn't have much flavor but this really perked it up.  
Thanks

Thanks Megan!  Great recipe.  I too cooked some chopped up onions and mushrooms, plus I added some green peppers to the ginger ale. Fill a pita pocket and add the honey mustard... delicious!!  I will be making this dish again.... soon!

Best thing I've cooked in a long time. I'm always looking for new ways to use kielbasa and this is a keeper. Using honey mustard sauce with this creates a taste sensation.

Im giving this a 5 star with the changes offered by Robin F.  The only things i did different from Robins suggestions was to add extra brown sugar to the gingerale before thickening with the corn starch. I used some summer squash and zucchini i had on hand along with an onion, red pepper and mushrooms. Mixed it all together and served over rice. The sauce tasted wonderful mixed with rice.

Tasty and easy. I simplified it by cooking the kielbasa until the ginger ale reduced and carmelized, then stirring in some whole grain dijon mustard. Saved cleaning the broiling pan, and no need to add extra sugar or sweetened mustard. Hubby loved it; will make again.

The kielbasa was actually too sweet for me. I think I might have added too much suger. I will make it again just to see if that is what was wrong.

I used only half of the ginger ale, and took other advice to serve with sauted green peppers, onion, and mushroom.
Next time, I will leave sausage pieces larger and serve on whole-wheat brat buns.

Loved this one.  Next time we'll use a stronger ginger ale like Reeds to get more ginger flavor.  Delicious and easy.  You can't get better than that.

This was very yummy! My kids gobbled it up. I cooked the ginger ale into a glaze and added a 1/4 cup brown sugar when broiling. I will be using this as my kielbasa recipe now! Thank you for such a simple yet easy recipe!

I haven't made this yet but I plan on on doing so very soon. The only changes in the recipe that I plan on changing is only using 1 cup of the ginger ale, and boiling the kiebasa in it until it's gone, and sauteing up some green peppers and onions, and mushrooms.

Really good - I cut Kielbasa in larger pieces and served as the main meal portion along with slaw, carrots cooked in butter and oven browned red skin potatos.  My husband is a picky eater and he enjoyed it very much.

I made the recipe as shown except I cooked the kielbasa with onions. It went over very well, but not spectacular.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful, and this is coming from an authentic Polish kielbasa conisseur, lol. I've never made kielbasa this way, but I'm so glad I came across this recipe. Try it, you will love it.
