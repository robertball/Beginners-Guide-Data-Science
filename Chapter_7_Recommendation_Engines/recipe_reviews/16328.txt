My husband and I LOVED this. I make this often and it's very easy to reheat. I omitted the cheese and it's just like the old fashioned shepherd's pie my grandmother used to make.

This was a good basic recipe, although I omitted canned green beans and carrots. Instead, I added one chopped green pepper and sauteed with the ground beef and onion, and also used creamed corn instead of whole kernel corn. I also subtituted 1 cup grated cheddar cheese for the 1/2 lb. processed cheese and prepared 2 cups of instant mashed potatoes instead of 4. Was very quick and easy and my husband really liked it.  Thanks, Cindy!

Wow!  Was that ever good!  I used 16oz of frozen mixed veggies and grated cheddar cheese (saving a handful to put on the potatoes for visual appeal) and it came out great!  This is a great alternative for those who are not huge fans of the condensed soup version.  I added some spices for extra flavor and it was fantastic!!  Thanks!

My meat and potatoes man LOVED this (as did my roommate and daughter)...but me? Well - it was okay but I think I'd rather do the tater tot hotdish thing (also meat & potatoes dish) than this.  Loved the ease of the recipe and its not difficult and I guess when your short on time, ingrediants, and just want a down-home meal this would fit the bill but I think I'd otherwise pass. I would say make this if you love this sort of thing...

I'm not quite sure why it's called "Jacob's Coat"--if it's referring to the coat of many colors in the Bible, it was Joseph who owned this coat.  Anyway, this was very good.  I used half instant and half regular mashed potatoes, and I added some mushrooms and green peppers to give it a nice flavor.  It's very filling and reheats nicely.  God Bless!!

Very good!  I only used green beans and corn, as I was out of carrots and peas, and I used frozen vegetables, rather than canned.  I also cut way back on the amount of vegetables.  I made the equivalent of a 20 oz bag of frozen vegetables.  I made real mashed potatoes, rather than instant, and only used about 2-3 cups, rather than 4.  It took a lot of time to prepare, but it was worth it.

I'd add more cheese on top of the potatoes.  I used canned corn and beans, meant to use carrots.  A good rib stickin' recipie.  Thanks : )

Very good.  I used Butter and Herb box potatoes though and it really added to it.  Next time I might try boxed augratin or scalloped on top!!  Thank you.

This recipe might not be among the fanciest, but my kids LOVE it.  My 8 year old stepdaughter can make most of the recipe w/out help; another plus.  This is a good "meat & potatoes" recipe, and a great way to get my kids to eat their veggies.  It's especially good with "real" mashed potatoes.  Thanks for the crowd pleaser!

A good base recipe. I added a package of stew seasoning to the meat and made my own mashed potatoes, which I covered with sharp cheddar during the last 5 minutes.

GOOD, BUT COULD BE BETTER. I WOULD ADD MORE CHEESE AND GARLIC SALT OR POWDERAND MAYBE SOME DICED TOMATOES. MY 2 YEAR LOD LOVED IT!!! HE ATE ALL THE LEFTOVERS. IT JUST NEEDED A LITTLE SOMETHING MORE FOR ME.

Nice hearty recipe.  Great on a cold fall evening.  I modified using homegrown herbs and vegetables from my garden.  Sprinkled chopped fresh parsley, majoram, & thyme over my homegrown carrots, peas, beans, & corn.  I also added shredded cheddar & monterey jack cheese over beef mixture, next added vegetables w/herbs, layered processed cheese over veggies and topped with homemade garlic/parsley mashed potatoes.  I added milk instead of water.  I wasn't quite sure how the top crust would brown, but it came out perfect.

My picky boyfriend even had seconds.

I Loved how easy this was! I added Pepper and Garlic salt to the ground beef and onions. It tasted great. I used frozen veggies, so the cook time was a little longer. I also added Lima beans. Next time I will try a brown gravy on the side too. This is a definte keeper.

The family thought this was pretty good. Forgot to add the cheese and it still was tasty, had to add some spice though as it seemed very bland. Thyme, garlic salt and onion powder did the job beautifully.

This was a nice easy throw together dinner. I only added corn and peas because I was worried about "overdoing" it but it could easlily carry all the veggies called for. 
 This will be a repeat. Thanks for posting.

This isn't GOURMET, but it is good and is easy to fix.  In fact, it is what I usually fix and take to households who have new babies or an illness and need a meal brought in.  As another reviewer noted, it should be called "Joseph's Coat Casserole."  See Genesis 37:3.

I use the meat/onion mixture on the bottome of a 2 quart cassrole mixed with a little instant mashed potatoes. Then I layer a can or corn, and then the remaining potatoes. I make enough potatoes for six servings. Then then cheese goes on top. I will try adding more veggies. Sounds good!

My husband thought this was OK. I thought it lacked flavor. I'm not a canned vegetable fan so I judged the veggies to be a bit mushy. There are other "shepherd's pie" recipes that are much tastier. Wouldn't make again.

I did take a few suggestions from other reviewers and seasoned the meat with garlic italian seasoning and season salt, I used real mashed potatoes and added chives to them I used frozen mixed veggies as that is what we prefer. I did precook them before putting them into the casserole. My hubby and both kids(except onions:) loved it. Very rarely does everyone like the same meal!!

My husband requests this casserole on a regular basis.  I usually have to make extra mashed potatoes since the 4 doesn't seem to cover it.  I also put a few pats of butter on top and add Parmesan cheese at 5 minutes left to bake.  I also season the hamburger to give it a little more of a "kick".  Great job though!!

I can't believe I'm writing this, but I actually threw this one out. HOWEVER...I think it had a lot to do with the fact that I tried to use ground turkey (just use the real stuff LOL).  However, I could taste the "canned"-ness of the veggies.  Would probably have been awesome with the beef and fresh veggies.
