This is a good base recipe. However, with my in-laws being Chinese and owning a Chinese/Vietnamese Restaurant for a few years, I have picked up a few tips that I thought I would share with you. I cubed 3 uncooked chicken breast into little pieces and seasoned it with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and a tablespoon of oyster sauce (found in the international aisle of your local supermarket--and don't worry, it doesn't taste like oysters). Heat up 2 TBS of butter with 1 TBS of sesame oil, then add 3 cloves of minced garlic with the chicken. Cooked until no longer pink, then I add about 4 sticks of thinly sliced Chinese sausage (found in asian markets). Cook for 1-2 minutes. Add 4 scrambled eggs to the meat. Cook for 3-4 minutes, then add a 16oz bag of frozen peas/carrots mixture. I mix in about 7 cups of cooked Jasmine rice (must be cold). Add soy sauce (about 1/4 Cup) and stir fry until light golden brown. Stir in chopped green onions and sprinkle in black pepper to taste. Voila, authentic Chinese Fried Rice in about 15 mins. Hope this helps... ENJOY!

This is a good foundation for fried rice. Be SURE to use sesame oil - not regular oil - since that is one of the basic flavors of Chinese cooking. Add garlic, ginger, sesame seeds, and salt and pepper. Also - make sure that your rice is cooled before you mix it in, otherwise it will become a think, starchy mess. If you want a sweeter flavor, add some teriyaki or stir-fry sauce to taste. Use a wok! This is a great recipe to have fun with.

Lovely meal.  Must use rice that has been fully chilled or it will clump together.`Also it needs some garlic and additional spices to give it that authentic chinese flavor.

My family loved this one.  I used a freshly cooked batch of rice, so the end product was a little sticky.  Next time I would use left over rice.  I sauted grated carrots and celery first, then added the chicken for a softer texture.

Excellent recipe except I omitted the eggs and green pepper and used scallions instead of regular onion.  I also added about a teaspoon of Hoisin sauce (found in the Asian section of your local grocery store).  Gave it a really good flavor.  I will definitly make it again!  I forgot to mention that I added a 1/2 teaspoon of fresh grated ginger root also.  It made all the difference.

I used this recipe as a cooking and "shopping for ingredients", training opportunity. (twelve year-old kids) I fixed this as the main meal and Gyoza (Japanese dumplings) for an appetizer. The kids (and parents) loved this! I cooked it all in one large wok. I like a little extra "Bam!" as Emeril would say. So, I added about two tablespoons of schechwan sauce. The chicken was cooked in olive oil over a med-high heat. The chicken shredded as the dish neared completion. This will definitely be fixed again.

This recipe is very delicious, and fast and easy to make.  My very picky 2-year-old ate tons of it.   I omitted the eggs and added broccoli to mine.  It was perfect.  One thing to make sure you do is wait to add the pea pods until the last couple minutes, because they turn brown and mushy if you cook them too long.  I waited until it was time to add the rice, which was just right.

No, this is not an "authentic" recipe, but knowing that, it still is pretty good.  I love Asian-flair foods while my boyfriend and roommate do not!  This was a good compromise because both of them repeatedly stated that this was good.  So, for those who eat this type of food alot, it may not suit your tastes but for those that are "new" to this type of food, would likely enjoy this recipe. Plus, you can add whatever veggies you prefer.

I read every single review (184 of them) and was so surprised that not one of them mentioned that the rice should be 2-3 days old, not just chilled.  In addition, to keep the rice grains separate like restaurant rice, add about 1 tsp. or so of oil to the rice and mix thoroughly with your hands.  Follow these two suggestions and there will be no clumpy rice.  I used brown rice cooked in chicken broth, which was so good I could have eaten just that alone.  Brown rice takes longer to cook than white rice, but is so much healthier (all the natural nutrition is removed when it is made white), and it tastes so much better.  This is a great basic recipe with lots of helpful tips from other reviewers.  Thanks for the recipe and the reviewerâ€™s contributions.

Good base recipe. I make fried rice often now and have made some modifications. To keep it more traditional (vietnamese), I leave out the bell peppers and celery and add more peas and carrots. I also add cooked shrimp (diced), green onions (sliced), and chinese sausage (thinly sliced) b/c they are a must! I always season the chicken with garlic, salt & pepper, and oyster sauce for more flavor when stir-frying. Fried rice is one of my all-time favorite things to eat but never learned to make, so thanks for the recipe that got me started!

As is, I felt this was a bit bland and didn't taste quite like the Asian style restaurant fried rice that we get around here.  I added some seasoning (garlic, onion and chinese 5 spice) and a about 1 T of teriyaki.  It was pretty good after that.

This is very good and I love that you can just use whatever veggies you have on hand.  Definitely add some onion though.  The directions need to be updated, however.  I always cook my scrambled eggs separately and stir into the rice at the last minute.  Recipe should also specify that the rice should be cold before stir frying.  If you use fresh cooked white rice you will end up with a sticky, sloppy mess.

The key to this for me was the order of ingredience, I sauted the chicken in some sesame oil, then added the onions soy sauce, let onions cook until soft, then added the peppers and carrots (no celery), then the ROOM TEMP. rice, then the remaining Soy and last the pea pods. This tasted like it came out of a take out box- Thanks!

What a great recipe. My family likes things chopped up a bit smaller than most so I did this. They didn't even know they got cooked carrots. I added chopped peanuts and this make it even better. This will be a staple in our house.

So funny after reading a lot of the reviews of this recipe!!!   No one makes it the same and some people think it tastes like take-out and others don't.....so who's to know whether you'll like it or not???  This is better than some, not as good as others...fried rice is what you make of it and your tastes.   I never put in celery or peppers...almost always use leftover pork and peas, not pods.   Soy sauce is essential and green onions are a must...make this recipe the way you want and it will be absolutely delicious.   The idea and cooking process are the right idea, so just go with what you like in it....

This is very good.  Tastes like Chinese restaurant take-out.  I followed the recipe exactly and I will do the same next time I make it.  I agree with other reviewers who said to use sesame oil and not a substitute.  Also, be sure to use chilled rice.  The only mistake I made was making only a half batch.  We were left wanting more!

This was an AMAZING recipe. It had plenty of flavor and was excedingly healthy. However, the time was strongly underlooked. I am not an amazingly fast cutter, but I do advise that you don't make this dish if you are wanting to eat soon. If everything is already cut, then the 25 minutes prep time is probably legit.

Don't be fooled. This dish was WORTH the time spent to cut everything; however, just be aware that it takes more than 25 minutes to prepare. =)

My family loves this rice.  Very important that rice is completely chilled. I have taken to making white rice in bulk and freezing in bags for use later.

Excellent recipe, made it with carrots, extra egg, and took out the 1/3 cup of Soy sauce to make it taste a little less salty, also added a small amount of butter.  Very good highly recomend!

I'm giving this a 4 because like others said it's a great start.  I used Marytee's advice and added some butter, garlic powder, minced garlic, pepper and most importantly, oyster sauce.  I tried a recipe for fried rice with just basically soy sauce and it felt like it was missing key ingredients.  The main ones I think are sesame oil and oyster sauce so don't skimp on those.  Also, I recommend using low sodium soy sauce because mine was a tad too salty and I used less than it called for.  I did also make an extra egg (I halved the recipe) because it wasn't nearly enough with just one.  I think if you make it as is with the additions that others recommended, you will have a dish that is very similar to what you would eat in a Chinese restaurant.  I know at least for me that's exactly what I was looking for!

Great recipe!  I omitted the celery and carrots.  Be sure you use Jasmine rice.  It enhances the flavor of the dish.  I also added a tablespoon of butter with a little bit of oil.  The oil prevents the butter from burning, where the butter adds richness.  And you don't have to use just chicken.  My first try, I used chicken.  The second time, I cooked up some Spam and cubed them up.  It was yummy!  My mother uses chinese sausauge (found at your local Asian food market).  Thanks for a great recipe.

While this recipe doesn't taste anything like the fried rice you get in chinese resturants, its still pretty tasty.

Turned out great. I seasoned the chicken with garlic and onion powder, salt and pepper like another reviewer recommended. I cooked the chicken in a little bit of olive oil and added the sesame oil at the end before adding the egg and 1/3 cup of soy. I have been told that sesame oil loses its flavor if you cook it at a high temp so that is why I added it at the end to maintain the flavor. I used random veggies in my fridge, broccoli, green onion, yellow pepper and a chopped jalepeno for heat. I also added a 1/2 TBSP of chili oil to make it spicy. I used brown rice for the health factor. It really turned out great and is a good base recipe.

VERY good recipe but I would suggest to stir fry the carrots apart from them all and for a long time! and I made egg drop soup with it.

This only gets 1 star, becaues the instructions are so bad that I can't figure out how to make it. The ingredients specify '2 eggs', but the instructions state 'stir in scrambled eggs'. Do you just whip them and add them raw? All at once, or drizzled? Or is there supposed to be a step where you place them in a pan and scramble them over heat?

This is a really good "end of the week" dish where you can use all of your leftover vegetables.  Don't leave out the sesame oil, it really adds flavor to the meal.  My husband likes his fried rice served with a can of sliced vienna sausages, which is surprisingly good (especially if I can forget the amount of sodium and preservatives in one can!)

This was pretty good, but nothing spectacular. It lacked flavor and did not taste like the kind you would eat at a restaurant. However, it was simple and filling.

I made this tonight for dinner. Actually I prepped most of the stuff early in the day including cooking the rice. So the meal came together fairly quickly. I included all the ingredients except the pea pods. I used baby peas instead. And I used Rice Select Royal Blend with Red Quinoa....so glad I used this rice blend. And I didn't measure much of anything (as usual) and added some seasoning like Lawry's Seasoned Salt and some pepper. My hubby and I really loved this. And it made a lot even when I scaled it to serve two. Oh, yes, and I used EVOO instead of sesame oil...my preference in almost everything. Sal....you made us really happy! Thanks.

I love this recipe!  Like the other reviewers I add a little oyster sauce and seasonings to chicken when I cook it.  Also cook the chicken with some ginger and garlic.  And if you don't have day old rice, I will make a fresh batch and spread it out a bit and freeze for an hour or so.  It works the same.

Very tasty! The chicken came out VERY dry though (my reason for 4 stars) so I would recommend adding the chicken later rather than cooking it the whole 15 minutes.

Very tasty- will definitely be making again . Added bean sprouts and pea pods at the very end so they stayed crunchy.  Added fresh garlic and fresh ginger. Didn't measure the soy sauce used - just used to taste.  Will add 3 eggs next time.

This is great. I'd suggest using DARK soy sauce instead of normal. Otherwise, the color will be too light, and you will end up adding more soy sauce... and your rice could get mushy. 

I didn't use chicken.

I added some oyster sauce (just a bit), which I mixed with the dark soy sauce. I also added garlic and 5-spice powder, and it turned out great!!

Added lots of salt, poultry seasoning and corn to the recipe and no peppers. Had great flavor, but beware of the sesame oil, it can easily dominate the taste if you don't use a light hand with it. Great recipe to tweak to your likings.

I used brown rice leftover from last night.  I used frozen peas and carrots instead of pea pods and carrots and added some minced garlic while I cooked the chicken & onion.  I personally love cilantro & green onion in my fried rice so I sprinkled some on top... Yummy-O!

This wasn't awful, but it didn't wow me either. I'm new to fried rice, so I think because the recipe said "Add rice, stir, heat through" that I didn't "Fry" the rice sufficiently. I'm still giving it a 3 because if that was the case, the instructions weren't clear. Still, it was easy and good, just not what I expected by the recipe title "fried rice".

I thought this was a great recipe!  I did change a few things due to other reviews.  I sauteed the chicken with a little garlic powder and pepper.  I didn't have any sesame oil so I used peanut oil instead and toasted some sesame seeds to give it some extra flavor.  I also added a little garlic and ginger to the rice while cooking.

Basically, a bland recipe for those sensitive to spices.  If you want a little more action, add some ginger or gingerroot in with the onions and use vegetable oil to cook the onions.  Save the sesame oil until the end. You might want to add a little garlic if you like to give it a little kick.

This is a very good basic guideline for fried rice.  I always go to hibachi grills and envy them for their rice making abilities. The rice I made last night, rivaled the rice from the restaurants. I improvised quite a bit though. I followed other peoples advice about refrigerating the rice to keep it from getting hard. After I finished cooking the rice, I marinated it with soy sauce and put it in the fridge. I then sauteed some green onions, peas, and carrots in a pan with soy sauce and butter. I tried the sesame oil the first time but ommited it the second time, and it was better. After I sauteed the vegetables, I added the rice and more soy sauce. I also put in some water chestnuts, and it was perfect. I will definitely make this again.

I just made this last night and it was delicious.  Just what I was craving.  I didn't use as much pea pods as the recipe called for because I thought it would overpower the rice but I think I'll add the half a cup next time.  Very nice recipe

This is a great recipe. I changed a few things because I just didn't have the fresh veggies on hand. So, I put in a bag of mixed frozen veggies, and for the rice I used two boil in bag brown rice bags. Lastly, I added garlic butter at the end to give it a little something extra. It came out awesome!!!!!! Thanks for the recipe!!!

I kind of liked this rice but my husband liked it a lot. It was a bit bland so I put a bit of garlic salt a little more soy sauce than stated. I should have waited for the rice to cool off more because it came out a little mushy. I will do this recipe again but next time I'll use the boil in a bag white rice just because it comes out fluffier and doesn't not stick too much.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I used a teaspoon of sesame oil and 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil, only 4 cups of rice, and left out the bell peppers. Good, basic recipe for your own additions, but I loved the pea pods!

It was very delicious and the look was appealing. Although there was not enough salt. Everyone loved it and will make again!

Pretty tasty. I made a couple adjustments. I left out the egg (never really liked that part), added some garlic, and a little ginger. Also used some black bean sauce. :)

This was........ok. Rather bland. It was agreed by all that it was "just ok."  We are big chinese cooking fans at my house. This was a little of a disappointment to us. But that doesn't mean the rest of you won't like it.

This is a good recipe.  It's great with a few modifications.   I left out the bell peppers because to me they just don't seem to belong in stir-fried rice.  I've made this twice now and it's delicious with these changes.  Be sure to cook the rice the night before or morning of and refrigerate otherwise you'll have a sticky mess.  Rice needs to be cold.  I used 1 cup dry rice to get 4 cups cooked.  That's all that will fit in my pan when I stir-fry.  Be sure to not use any salt when cooking rice, because this dish will be salty enough from other ingredients.  Also used 2 thick leftover pork chops cut into small pieces instead of chicken.  First scramble eggs with 1 Tbs. water and cook flat in skillet with 1 Tbs. vegetable oil.  Cook for 1 min., flip for another 30 seconds and roll up like a cigar and set aside.  Chop into ribbons and then smaller pieces with spatula.   Add 2 Tbs. oil to skillet and cook bias cut carrots 3 min; add bias cut celery and onion and cook 2 min; add 1 clove minced garlic and cook 30 seconds.  Add 1-1/3 c. frozen peas (1/2 of 12 oz. bag) and cook 1 min.; add cooked meat you are using and cook 1 min.  Add rice and sauce and stir to warm and mix  (Sauce:  3 Tbs. oyster sauce, 1 Tbs. soy sauce, and 1 tsp. sesame oil stirred together.)  Add 3-4 chopped green onions and eggs and mix to warm.  Yum!

Didn't have all the ingredients on hand (had no pea pods or peppers), but this recipe worked really well for me in a pinch!  It was exactly what I was looking for and tasted great! Thanks so much for sharing :D

I think this is a good basic recipe.  I recommend  tossing the cooked chicken with soy sauce and then sautÃ©ing fresh minced garlic and ginger with the chicken mixture.  Add the veggie and cooked rice, and after some time the scrambled eggs.  In no time you've got a quick meal!  My family enjoyed it!

There is one element not taken into account here.
You have to know how the restaurants make the rice so it does NOT stick together. 
Fortunately this was shared to me several years ago and I am sure it is still the way it is done.
I was told long ago, that to make your rice NOT stick together you had to wash it thoroughly to remove the starch from the outside of the rice before cooking.
The first time I did it I found out that you also have to know how much water to leave in it after washing. This was more difficult at the time than it sounds. To alleviate that problem I put the rice and proper amount of liquid in the pot before I washed it and noted the water level, so I could strain off the overage before cooking.
Hope this helps with the clumping issues.

I'm a single Dad and i get my kids for a week out of the month. I have been looking for things to prepare four kids that everybody would like. Even as I was cooking my oldest Daughter of 14 was saying how gross it looked and I don't like this or that. All said and done she went back for seconds!! I took the tip of cooking the rice before hand during the day and chilling it properly. Overall this dish was a hit with everybody! Even the 2 kids who live upstairs came and ate it. feeds 7 easy like the recipe says.

This was excellent! I used brown rice to make it healthier and with all the veggies and seasoning, you can't even tell. It made enough for my family of 4 plus leftovers for lunch.

Very good recipe - I had only almond oil and substituted peas pods by adding broccoli. If you don't have soya sauce, try using a splash of oyster sauce.  My husband loved it!

Good flavor, I did saute all the vegetables before I added the chicken since the chicken is already cooked.  Will be making again.

Was not a fan and was SUPER disappointed because (aside from it using up a lot of perfectly good ingredents) I LOVE chicken fried rice and thought id found a recipe to do it at home.. Bottom line rice came out soggy and bland- Next time Im gonna just pay the $5 and get it already made.. Ohhh well it was worth a shot but no, I wont be making it again :(

This was very good, and my mom and sister really enjoyed it!  My only fiasco was in cooking way too much.  I tried to cut it down to around 5 servings and still ended up barely fitting it into my pan!  Mistake is all my own, however; cleaning up the kitchen was a small chore after such a good meal.

Good basic recipe, add/substitute veges, meats and seasonings for personal taste. Used leftover brown rice and added peas in the last step to keep from becoming mushy. Bland but improvised with seasonings - parsley (fresh), basil, garlic, accent, seasoning salt (dash), etc. Guests loved the dish w/the Red/Burgandy Wine. Will definitely use again with personal touch!!!

Very yummy!  Was a hit with my family.  Substituted a frozen mixed vegatable blend (what I had on hand) for the veggies listed.  Added additional soy sauce while frying the rice.  Turned out fabulous!

Quick basic recipe made quicker with the addition of frozen stir fry veggies, rotisserie chicken, leftover scrambled eggs with ham, pepper, fresh grated or 1/2 t powdered ginger. Top it off with the addition of shrimp which cooks in minutes while the rice is steaming makes a wonderful, quick weeknight meal. You can use anything you have left in the refrigerator that you want to use up. Makes this a very versatile dish.

This was a pretty good base. Put chopped shrimp in at the end instead of the chicken in the beginning. I think I would have liked a tad more of the sesame oil but pretty good overall

Lots of fine dicing, but well worth the effort. Prep time stated is not accurate.  Figure on taking an hour.  I cut the chicken back to .75 lb, then added about a half pound of cooked shrimp sliced in half.  It's also wise to add the Snow Pea Pods a little later in the cooking process to protect the colour and crispness. A pretty dish, with excellent flavour, and very popular with my guests. Oh yes, cook the rice the night before.

The only changes I made was to add a little fresh ginger and I left out green pepper (don't like them).  It was a lot of chopping but otherwise very easy and I thought it was great!  I really liked that it had a lot of veggies in it and was fresh tasting with no butter!

Great and fast recipe. Added more soy sauce for flavor, but raved by my husband. I left out the chicken and made another chicken dish to pair with it and used this as a side dish, then made the (what was left) leftovers lunch the next day. Thanks!

I made this on Sunday and let me tell you, it was great.  Everyone had seconds.  I follow the advice of Mary Tee a previous reviewer.  I added chicken and the oyster sauce.  It was very, very good so this I wil be making again.  Thanks for sharing.

Delicious!  I followed the directions of other reviewers and added a bit of garlic powder, ginger and a bit of hoisin sauce.  I also cooled the cooked rice (made enough for 6 ppl) in the fridge so it was sufficiently cooled when we mixed it all together. It turned out really well and we'll definitely be making this recipe again!  Oh, and the leftovers were still great the next day!

This is a great way to spruce up white rice if you cooked too much! The sesame oil is a MUST and definitely cut down the soy sauce at the end. I eyed it - about half. Four star, not quite a fiver.

I love this recipe for fried rice! We eat it at least 2 times a month and there are always leftovers for dh to take to work for a couple of days.
I always keep chopped onions and peppers in the freezer that I flash freeze when I have extra fresh that I don't want to go bad. I use those and plain frozen peas plus I usually have carrots in the fridge. I use whatever else I have on hand from the recipe and this becomes a 'whenever' recipe that I don't have to buy ingredients for!

This was a good base recipe for fried rice. The sesame oil makes the recipe taste more authentic. I also found that using cold rice and a wok also improved the recipe. I added my own choice of veggies and my fiance loved it!

Very nice basic recipe- I added lots more veggies, though- student budget! Next time I will use less soy, though- a bit too strong for me. Great job!

Instead of pea pods, I diced some bok choy and used only a 1/3 c. of the soy sauce. Plus, surprisingly, cooking spray worked just as well instead of the oil.  The recipe was quite delicious and I assume far healthier! I will definitely recommend/use this again!

We used frozen early peas, omitted the carrots & pepper, substituted green onion for the onion and brown rice instead of white rice. This was very yummy! The longest part was preparing the rice, but other than that this is a very quick, simple, and delicious meal. Excellent flavor. Will definitely make again. Thanks!

A nice change from the usual boring rice we eat!  I think it's nearly impossible to make it exactly like the take-out stuff but this was still very good and actually had a light and healthy taste.  You could really taste all those veggies and both kids had second helpings.  A make-again recipe for sure.

This was pretty good, but I felt like the flavor could have been better. I might try it again and add some more spices or something. It was pretty good, though.

While preparing this, I wasn't concerned whether it was going to taste authentic or not; I just wanted to use up some leftover chicken. Yup, needed more seasonings and to make life easy on myself, I just bought a package of frozen asian style vegies and threw them in. I also browned my rice first because I love the nutty flavor it brings. My gang loved this Sara and I thank you!

Left out the celery as well as the red  bell pepper. Also added a tad of garlic and used frozen minced onion as a timesaver. Instead of soy sauce, I used stir-fry sauce. Overall, pretty tasty.

A mushy mess. The flavor was fine but the rice all clumped togeter in a big, sticky ball--not what I think of when I think stir fry.

Very good base; I added a clove of garlic, onion powder, fresh ground pepper and garlic powder for additional flavor per reviews I read.  I also threw in some frozen peas.  With my adjustments, my family loved it.  Filling and delicous and served as a complete meal.

I made this according to the recipe. Way to much Soy Sauce is used! Not only did it make the rice gummy it was like eating a mouthful of salt. Much to salty.  Also, by adding the cooked chicken so early the chicken ended up overcooked.

Although it doesn't say how to cook the chicken, prior to mixing it together or alone.....we cooked the 3 mins on each side, then set aside and added them back in the step it says to add it. Also it doesn't mention to cook the rice 1st and let chill, since it should be added to the dish while it has been cooked prior also! A little play with it in one way or another is to us just part of cooking new recipes! Enjoy!!!

I made this last night and my husband and I loved it. I used leftover rice, low sodium soy sauce and substituted frozen veggies for the fresh ones noted above. I didn't have chicken so I used uncooked strips of steak instead. The steak tasted horrible(not the recipes fault) but the rice was a show stopper. Next time I will double up on the rice because we were left wanting more.

I used about 3 cups brown rice for this cooked in vegetable broth (3 cups cooked). I also used fresh broccoli- 4 stalks, fresh sliced poblano and jalapeno pepper- unseeded, 1 onion- sliced, 4 cloves of sliced garlic, 1 10 oz. package frozen peas, 2 peppers- yellow and red, 3 cups chopped smoked turkey and 6 eggs. I cooled the rice down after I cooked it, then stir fried the broccoli in about 2 Tb. olive oil, then added the onions, peppers and garlic, added the turkey after that to warm, then added the peas. I put the rice in another pan, cracked the eggs over and stirred until scrambled. I added soy sauce, salt, pepper, adobo seasoning and cilantro sauce. I mixed altogether. Very very good- this is a forgiving recipe- add whatever meats or vegetables you like. It's a great recipe for Weight Watchers- it contains most of the power foods! Love it- and my husband does also- he is not even needing to lose weight:)

This was good, but not fantastic. I'd make it again as a side, so I'd actually halve or quarter the recipe; that was a LOT of rice.

The egg scrambled at the end was not good. I couldn't taste or see the egg in the end. The amount of oil was off and the rice kept sticking.

Excellent, tasty, and loaded with vegetables. You can add whatever vegetables you want. Next time I will add broccoli.

Just made this tonight for dinner.  It was delicious!  I used a pork tenderloin that was marinated in teriyaki sauce & cooked brown rice the day before & chilled it.  I had to use the veggies I had on had so I had finely chopped brocolli, red peppers, onions, & carrots.  I used the sesame oil someone else mentioned - definitely adds to the flavor.  I scrambled the eggs first, set aside and added with the rice.  If I had green onions I would have added them at the end, otherwise this was fantastic - a new favorite in our rotation.

Excellent recipe and so easy to make. Everything cooks in one frying pan so fast and easy clean up too. Very simply to substitute what you have on hand.  I added a teaspoon of oyster sauce as suggested but not sure it added anything to the taste.  I cooked the egg in the fryer first omelette-like and then sliced it up and set it aside to add at the very end.  I also added a generous tablespoon of garlic to the onion while frying. The rice absolutely MUST be made a day ahead for this recipe to turn out well.  I didn't have any carrots but didn't miss them either.  Reheated very well the next day for my lunch so this is real keeper meal for me. Thanks for posting it.

Very easy to make. I modified the vegetables a little bit, using regular frozen peas instead. Everything else I had on hand, it was quick week night dinner. I used fresh rice from the rice cooker, I found the end result to be quite similar to what you get at a hibachi style restaurant (Benihana). My kids ate it all and asked for more, That's the best compliment a mom can get when trying a new recipe.

Made this once to rave reviews. I added chicken bouillon (liquid concentrate), then just added soya sauce to taste. With the bouillon added I'd rate it a 5.

LOVED this recipe!  I didn't have sesame oil, so I sauteed some sesame seeds along with some garlic before I added the chicken and veggies.  I also added some poultry seasoning to the chicken.  Turned out great!  Will make again!

Simple and tasty. I seasoned the chicken and slapped it on my trusty george foreman grill and swapped out some veggies. Used a lot more oil then called for, but that may be because I tend to cook things too high. Definitely let your rice cool thoroughly. This whole thing actually takes longer than is advertised, but is worth it.

This is a good simple fried rice. I didn't have the pea pods so I used bamboo shoots. I usually add frozen peas to my fried rice, I think that would be really good added to this. I used leftover Tasty Chicken from this site for the cooked chicken. Turned out great!!

I don't know if this is a fair review, (I omitted a few things) but......I used olive oil, and much more of it...maybe 3-4 TBS.  I just used frozen peas and carrots for my veggies.....also, I didn't put in the chicken either.  This tasted great, I'm sure even better with the other ingredients:) except the peppers:)  I'll make this again.

This had too much soy sauce for my taste, but my husband at every little grain in his bowl. Next time I plan on cutting down on the soy sauce, which will probably make it taste perfect to me. The chicken was super yummy!!!

This was good, but there was something missing. I cooked the rice the night before so it was nice and cold. I baked the chicken a couple of hours ahead with garlic powder, onion powder, salt & pepper. I only had low-sodium soy sauce on hand (I will try regular next time) and I used celery, carrots, green peppers and onions (all minced, my boyfriend isn't a veggie person ;)) as the veggies. I think I might try adding some ginger and garlic powder to this for some extra flavor.

Great alternative to chinese take-out! My kids won't eat rice but they love this dish. I take a few liberties based on other reviewers and to make it kid-friendly (celery not a favorite) but it is remarkably close to the restaraunt fried rice.

What's clear to me reading the reviews is that most people don't know how to make rice. Steaming is great is you've got a rice steamer. I don't. Most of you don't.

Take a volume of water that is twice that of the intended volume of rice. Bring that to a boil, adding salt, pepper, butter and chicken base. Add long grain rice and reduce heat to simmer with lid in place. Do not remove lid for at least 20 minutes. Fluff and use rice per recipe or as side dish. Veggies may be added at the earliest boil stage and will be perfect when rice is done.

It won't be sticky. If you want sticky, use a medium or short grain rice.

This recipe was good (and easy).  I am a beginner cook and had no problems with this what so ever!  I omitted the peas because we're not big fans and added green onions.  I probably will not use the eggs next time because mine did not turn out like they do at the resturant.  My four year old who usually doesn't eat rice or the vegetables in this told me 'it was the best rice ever'.  :)

This was so good I made it for about 20 people and there was only one serving left when it was all said in done. Plus two people asked for the recipe. I did as other here did and added ginger fresh garlic. I also did not have the green pepper and green pepper and pea pods on hand but I did have 2 bags of broccali sitr-fry that all those things plus more. After steaming them with my rice when it was cooking I then chopped them up so they were not that big and bulky. It turned out great I will do this one again. Thank you!

Very easy and simple recipe. I made a few alterations: brown rice instead of white, shrimp instead of chicken and 1 tsp of fresh ginger. Very good!

Let's see.. what did I change. I skipped the eggs.  Wound up just using carrots and onions for the moment. We didn't have much else for veggies on hand. Put in some minced ginger along with the meat - about a tablespoon's worth. I screwed up a little, but this may have been a good thing. I didn't pre-cook the chicken, and I used hot sesame oil. So after sautee the onions a bit in the oil, I tossed in the chicken and cooked it up that way. Gave the dish a nice spicy flavor. Excellent! I can't wait to make it again and fiddle more.

The recipe was Good and SIMPLE! I used only peas, carrots, and onion so it was like the kind you would get at a Chinese restaurant. Plus I added an extra egg. Great recipe if you like variations.

I cooked this dish for a church function and got rave reviews.  I did substitute the chicken for chinese sausage that I had purchased from a chinese market. It is a dish that is pleasing to the eyes and tastebuds.

We thought this was awesome!  Just did a couple things differently.  I diced the carrots, celery and onion and boiled them in chicken broth for about 5 minutes to make them more tender.  Did the same with boiling the chicken in chicken broth for more flavor.  Did not use bell pepper.  Increased the soy sauce.  Absolutely LOVED this recipe!

Thank you Sara!

I cooked my rice the night before and made sure it was very cold, but it still seemed sticky.  I added teriayki sauce and seseme seeds, and it tasted pretty good.  Was better the next day.  I used my food processor to chop the veggies, I grated the onion, celery, and carrots, and sliced the peppers.  Turned out great and even my 1.5 year old liked it!

This is my first attempt at cooking a
stir fry. I said to myself, "What a

experience easy and fun. I added some
mushrooms and zucchini to the vegtables
and some sunflower meats to the rice.

This was great, add or don't add any leftover veggies you want. For everyone who re writes the recipe or makes a lot of changes - instead of 'reviewing' it that way - why not just add your recipe to a collection. It seems silly to review something when you've completely changed the entire thing

Made this for dinner. Used sesame oil (1/2 T.), Italian green beans instead of snow pea pods - too expensive, plus added some seasonings that you can only find at Penzi's: 1/2 T. Berbere - nice kick, and about 1 T. of Bankok seasoning. Husband won't eat onion, so I used plenty of garlic. He loved it!

Awesome Recipe! Added some more veggies like diced Brussel sprouts, broccoli, mushrooms, green onion and a drop of spicy sauce to the chicken while it was cooking along with some salt and pepper! Turned out amazing. Will definitely recommend.

My husband loved this which I was surprised about since he usually doesn't like Chinese food. I don't know if I will make it again though because you have to cook and chill the rice and cook the chicken prior to making the dish.  I'm just usually too last minute for that thoughtful prep except once in awhile when I have time.  Very tasty though!

Hard to believe, but I had never eaten Chinese Fried Rice before.  When eating Chinese out we always ordered steamed. So, not knowing how it was supposed to taste, I didn't make any changes to the recipe, but I did make mine with leftover pork chops.
There isn't a picture, because my husband and finished it all between the two of us.
I will definitely make this again, but will try different meats or seafood.

As others have said, this is a great basic recipe. I do recommend the following:
1-Add garlic- 
2-I donâ€™t cook the food in sesame oil, but definitely use it to finish the dish- it adds great flavor.
3- I have made with both chicken and leftover pork, which turns out great.
4- scramble the egg separately, gently fold in right before serving.

This recipe was simple to follow and makes enough for many meals throughout the week. I can see why people suggest adding additional ingredients though, as compared to the typical Chinese dish, it can seem a bit bland. I'm curious to try this dish again with some additional ingredients.

First time at making fried rice. Very good. I did not have peas, or peppers, but followed suggestion of 2 Tbsp butter and 1 Tbsp sesame oil. Put onion and garlic granules, garlic and ginger when cooked meat. Used only 3 cups rice. Added cashews. Yum. Also used 1/2 low sodium and regular soy sauce.

I used the most helpful review in its entirety with these modifications; I used boneless,  skinless chicken thighs  and I used my food processor to chop finely. Skipped the sausage.  Added frozen mixed vegetables and cooked the rice in chicken stock. My family liked it so much we ate the leftovers 3 days in a row!   We used it as filling in lettuce wraps. AWESOME.

Very good.  I made it exactly as presented.   Lots of vegetables and the chicken used was cooked in the crock pot first,  so it was very tender.   I forgot to get carrots so I had to use a can of carrots I had on hand.   I will make it again,  but next time I will use more soy sauce.

This recipe is ok. I use a lot more spices and also a chilipepper chopped in very small pieces. The fried rice will  taste  better, when you cook the rice one day earlier and put it in the fridge overnight so it is really cold.

I have made this dish twice so far. And actually, rather than following the recipe, I have followed MaryTee's instructions in her "Most helpful positive review" (I have just omitted the sausages though). And my oh my... It turned out awesome. Everyone came back for second helpings...

Good, especially considering it has so few ingredients. Because I made a lot, I had to stirfry the ingredients in batches and therefore needed to add more oil. I also suggest doubling the amount of chicken, since we could barely tell there was chicken in the recipe with the amount it called for. Fresh pineapple chunks would be a good addition. My family enjoyed this. I will make it again.

We used (cold) brown rice, added a teaspoon of minced garlic and a half cup of diced carrots with the peppers, and added a half cup of steamed peas (instead of pea pods) at the very end.  Definitely tasted healthier than our favorite takeout, but just as good.

This is very good, but I added a tablespoon of oyster sauce and fresh ground ginger too enhance the flavour, will be making this regularly.

I used the recipe except for using different vegetables that I had on hand. I've tried making fried rice before, and after trying this recipe, I realize that the sesame oil is a must for the correct flavor.

Yum! I've made this several times now. Used all advice from Chinese/Vietnamese restaurant gal. Sesame oil is a must. Cold white jasmine rice fries up the tastiest. Very adjustable recipe and adapts to what is on hand. Spam or chicken sausage cut into little pieces fries nicely too. Or meatless and use couple extra eggs.

Thumbs up from the hubby and three kids, which almost never happens when we try new recipes.  Omitted the celery and added broccoli - so yummy!!  Also used basmati rice.  Will definitely make again!

This was great! Cooking Chinese food is so hard and you have to go into it knowing it's not going to be perfect restaurant quality, but it was pretty close. I forgot a couple of ingredients (I'm the worst cook ever). I didn't use peppers or onion or egg. I used chicken, corn, broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed it and it was super easy to make!

Fantastic base for fried rice; did make a couple of small changes, frozen veggies, oyster oil.  Will certainly make again.  This was a lot better fried rice than I usually make.

I cooked the chicken first then added the onion & soy sauce, I saw no reason to add already cooked chicken when it only takes about 5-6 min to cook cubed fresh chicken. The recipe is very good and yes, I would make it again. I also used gluten free soy sauce to make a completely gluten free dish.

I'd have to agree with MaryTee.  Read her review for helpful hints.  This is a very good basic recipe.  Food, like wine, is personal preference; recipes are merely a guide.  Good cooks leave in what they like, take out what they don't have on hand or like, and substitute  to their or their family's taste.  The addition of  garlic, oyster sauce and mixed vegetables  takes this fried rice over the top in flavor.

This  recipe was fun to make.  The flavor and texture was very appealing.  I would only make two changes.  I used sliced scallions in place of the pea pods.  Also, I will prepare the scrambled eggs in a separate pan from now on instead of trying to cook them in the same pan, as the video suggested.  I would add the eggs last.  Very enjoyable meal.

I'm sure the recipe is delicious exactly as it's written, but I made a few changes based on what I had on hand and my past experience cooking fried rice. I did not use red bell pepper, pea pods, and green bell pepper. Instead I used shredded cabbage with the onions, carrots (my daughter doesn't like cooked carrots so I made sure they were just tender crisp... she ate them!), and celery. I coated the chicken with about a 1/4 tsp garlic powder, a 1/4 tsp onion powder, 2 tsp ponzu sauce, and 1 Tbsp hoisin sauce. I used low salt soy sauce in place of regular, and added a few chopped spring onions on top. Other than that (ha ha) I followed the recipe as written. Best fried rice ever!

I took the advice from Marytee and it was delicious but instead I used chilled brown rice, 2 red peppers ( not a fan of green) snow peas and fresh peas. Everything else was the same. Tasted delicious and was over flowing with veggies the way my family likes it. Great recipe. Thanks for posting.

pretty good recipe. I rated it a 5 star because husband and daughter liked it and its a good recipe to use up the end of the week veggies.{like one rater stated} Took alittle time to cut up everything and cool the rice. I did add garlic and sauteed with the onion and also sprinkled in ground ginger. Cooked the carrots with the oinion and added a little more sesame oil in the last step. Thank you Sal.

Will add additional seasonings next time like garlic and Chinese 5 spice. 6 cups of rice is way too much- only used about half of what I prepared, partly because no more would fit in my pan. May try a wok, but even then I think 6 cups would be too mush relative to the amount of vegetables.

Great chinese fried rice, I made this with General Tsao's chicken so I didn't do it with chicken. But still great fried rice. Also I used one reviews advice to use oyster sauce, and it tasted great!

Top Notch!! Great Side Dish!! I leave out the chicken and make numerous types of stir fry's like beef and brocoli to put on top. Its amazing!! We eat this often at my house. My family loves it so much even all by itself with some soy sauce. Rice is a new favorite around here. Which works for me because I love rice, just couldnt get my family to eat it much before though. THANK GOODNESS I HAVE THIS RECIPE NOW!!!

I really liked this recipe.  First time trying something like this.  I did change a couple things though...I made the rice using olive oil in it (1 tsp olive oil for every cup of rice).  Also, I used stir fry vegetables in the recipe which went over really well.

Disappointed.  First ALLRECIPES recipe I have not thoroughly enjoyed.  Was bland.  I even incorporated some of MaryTee's suggestions such as Hoisen Sauce and pre-seasoning chicken. Made it because my son, home from the navy, encouraged me to make more worldly ethnic dishes since he has experienced and loved them; but even he said it was blah.  It was better cold than warm.

Very tasty! Not quite like takeout, but worth making. I did add minced garlic, and that was quite good. Will make again, perhaps with a little less sesame oil to adjust the flavor and light sodium soy sauce to control the salt intake. Possibly make the rice with low sodium chicken broth? That could be tasty. Overall, though, good recipe.

I browned the chicken with butter and used a frozen package of cut celery, onion, and carrots plus some frozen peas. Much easier than cutting everything up. I added some ground cayenne pepper which everyone seemed to like. It says 7 servings but it really feeds 4 adults.

I love, love, LOVE this recipe for fried rice! I wouldn't call it truly authentic, but it's so tasty, who cares! One caveat, however; I strongly recommend you use cold rice and not rice that has been freshly made.

Fantastic. Exactly what I have been looking for. I did omit the pea pods, just because I rather not have them. The whole family loved it. Will be making this again. Thanks for the recipe.

I had fun making this and the kids I fed it to really enjoyed it, too!
2nd time: used pea pods, carrots, peas, onions. Meant to toss in some bacon. Next time hubby wants me to add water chestnuts. Also need to remember to make a spot for egg to cook at bottom of wok, then break it up after it cooks.

Yum!  This is so good and very easy to make.  Plus my kids loved it. I cut this recipe in half but probably could have made the whole amount as there was nothing left.  Next time I'll leave the egg out; I don't think that it added much to the recipe.

I added added a half a can of chinese stir fry vegetables to make this a little more authentic.  This made a nice enough lunch but I probably won't make it for guests.

I omitted the chicken, and sliced the snowpeas into strips. It was a little bit bland, but as the pork dumplings we were having with it were really flavorful, it didn't matter too much. Thanks!

Even though this recipe was fairly easy, I think next time it will be easier just to run to the local Chinese take out.  The flavor was alright, but not comparable to take out, in my opinion.

Does not taste like the fried rice served in restaurants, but is a tasty dish, making a pound of chicken go a long way.
