This recipe was awesome. The only thing different that was done, was I marinated the chicken for a few hours in a baja style marinade (another recipe found on the net). It added some nice flavor to the chopped chicken.

My family really liked these wraps. They were very quick and easy to make, and could be customized in a lot of different ways. Next time I think I would add more lime and cumin to the dressing, just to add even more kick!

These were pretty good, but missing something. I think I will make them again but next time use some cilantro and cumin in the dressing.

Pretty good & made for a very quick lunch.  I used less chicken as you can see (1.5 breast).

Awesome. A terrific summer dish - very tasty and filling, but not heavy at all. My husband LOVED it. I loved the grilling step (used my George Foreman and it worked great). I'll make again and again! Thanks :)

Suprisingly very good!  Definately needs the cabbage for the crunch factor. I was nervous about the ranch with chili powder. I made it as written with a couple of additions. I added in some cumin and cilantro though not very much because I didn't want to regret it later.  I don't know if I noticed it or not, but it didn't detract from the taste. I will keep this in my rotation after making grilled chicken.

These were amazing! Instead of the ranch dressing, I mixed a bit of ranch dressing mix in with the sour cream (I used lite) and then added another 1/4 cup of sour cream. The entire family loved it (tho I had to make a couple cabbage free version for the kids). It was so quick and easy. I can't wait to make it again.

My WHOLE family loved these - considering my two picky ones ages three and one, that is quite the feat.  We ditched the coleslaw (because I didn't have it) and used a little lettuce instead.  So yummy!  My husband was grateful we had leftovers for lunch the next day!

This was WONDERFUL!!  A couple of things. . .our grill died, so I tried the broiler option.  Put a tortilla shell under a HI Broiler temp for about 30 seconds, or until darker brown spots appear.  Flip it over and put some cheese on the non-toasted side.  Add the serving of chicken ingredients, spread it to within a couple of inches on 3 sides, and sprinkle more cheese on the top.  Put it back under the broiler until the cheese melts. . .WATCH IT! Fold it bottom first then sides and secure with a toothpick. I would bet that the grill is even better, but without one, it's a keeper, too!  Thank you for sharing!

Made this, as written! Huge hit among the adults! My 13 year old, daughter didn't love it, but she did eat most of it. It is definately something I would make again. 
Very good base recipe. I think next time I will add a few things to jazz it up, but it is still very tasty!

The family & I thought these were just okay, a little plain.  I think I will try them one more time and add a little more seasoning & some green onions, however the recipe as is was a little disappointing.

Very good!  I used the finely chopped cole slaw blend and no one even knew it had cole slaw in it until I mentioned it.  This is a keeper.

Great wrap with a lot of flavor.  I used leftover grilled chicken in this recipe.  The added flavor of the coleslaw, chili powder and lime juice added just the right amount of crunch and seasoning to this recipe.  So easy to put together and on the grill for 10 minutes.  Yum

These were good. My kids(12 and 6) loved them because they put ranch on everything! It's also a  tasty way to get some vegetables in your kids.

I made these as directed and added chopped cucumbers and lettuce to the wraps. I also used Spinach wraps instead of the traditional wheat tortillas. They are a big hit in my family.

These are absolutely delicious! I have made them several times for different people and everyone raves. It's amazing how putting a wrap on the grill for a few minutes turns it into something really special. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I made this with a few adjustments. I did not have coleslaw blend.  I used flour tortillas and mozzarella cheese instead.  I also marinated the chicken first and added onion powder and a little bit of cayenne pepper.  Delicious! Didn't even need the salsa or sour cream.

I had a small cooked chicken breast and some cabbage (not the pakcaged slaw mix, just shredded cabbage) that needed used up, and I needed a lunch for work. So I decided to make these wraps for my lunch. I left out the tomato because I am out of them. I mixed everything up and placed it in a tupperware, and wrapped up a couple tortillas. I don't have a grill at work, so I ate these cold. Very yummy, would probably be even better grilled!

Great recipe! Made minor changes. Extra cumin and some taco seasoning from Savory also, used lettuce instead of coleslaw blend! Thank you Knudsen.

I didn't change the recipe a bit but a little bit of pepper might give this dish that little something extra. It really depends on your personal taste.

This was a delicious chicken wrap! Reading other's review about the chicken having no flavor, I just rubbed some taco seasoning on it before placing it on the grill. I used Romano tomatoes instead. I am a fan of the thicker consistency of combining Hidden Valley Ranch packet and sour cream instead of the bottled ranch.  Will definitely be making this again.

Loved this recipe!! Be sure the closely watch the wrap when it's on the grill. :D Made a few for the kids without the cabbage. Much, much better with the crisp of the cabbage.

Added cilantro, cumin, and more lime juice. Also, didn't have regular Ranch, so I used Chipotle Ranch. It was pretty tasty, the hubby thought so too.

This was OK. The chili powder overwhelmed everything else, and that was sort of a deal breaker for me. Four stars because the kids loved it. Different ingredients, same grill method might make something spectacular.

Deserves five stars!  I followed a few other reviews and added cumin (about a 1/2 tsp) and an extra Tbsp of lime juice.  This is the second time I made these.  The first was a disaster with the toothpicks.  The second try I used cooking string.  Worked perfectly!
