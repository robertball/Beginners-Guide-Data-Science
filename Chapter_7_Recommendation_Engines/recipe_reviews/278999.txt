4.9.20  I didn’t have fingerling potatoes, but I did have a bag of multi-color miniature potatoes, so that’s what I used.  The house smelled wonderful when these potatoes were roasting, but when I checked at 20 minutes, they looked  very dry, so I did give them another little drizzle of olive oil and a stir.  Unfortunately, we really couldn’t taste the lemon at all.  We love roasted potatoes, and these still were good enough that I’d make again.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.
