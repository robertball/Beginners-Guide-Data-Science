I've modified this recipe so much it barely resembles the original! I'm rating it 4 stars regardless, because it gave me a starting point to what is now one of my family's favorite dinners........... A few things I do is double (or more) the rice, add a can of cream of mushroom, a package of pea pods, 1/2 package of mix veggies, sliced water chestnuts, mushrooms, minced garlic, and celery seed instead of fresh. For the almonds I use Almond Accents (original). They're paper thin and pre-salted. These are a necessity in our opinion. We also serve our noodles on the side so they don't get mushy and everyone can add to their own personal taste. I use rice noodles. The ones that look just like chow mein noodles, but a tad thinner. We prefer these and they only cost a few cents more.

I am giving this 5 stars because, even though I didn't follow it exactly, it inspired me to create a recipe that my family LOVED.  My husband has always loved hamburger helper's Rice Oriental so I browned the hamburger with onion powder and garlic salt (my 3 year old recoils at anything with chunks of onion) then added the rice, water, almonds and soy sauce.  I am not a huge fan of condensed cream soups so I just made a quick gravy/sauce by combining about two tsp of corn starch and water.  The flavor was JUST like hamburger helper and the almonds were a wonderful touch.  Much, much healthier and cheaper.  I will definitely be making this again!!!

I didn't follow this recipe too closely, but it was a easy to prepare meal.  I used cream of mushroom rather than cream of chicken soup.  Didn't have celery or almonds.  I really think the extra crunch would have been nice, it was a little mushy and didn't have much texture without.  If I make again I will probably follow the recipe more closely.

My mom use to make this when I was a child.  I was craving it yesterday so looked here and found this recipie.  It was perfect.  I didn't put in the almonst, since my husband hates them, and used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken, because it sounded better.  Hit the spot.  Easy weeknight meal.

My husband really enjoyed this.  I added fresh garlic to the hamburger and didn't have almonds so used water chestnuts.  It's a good addition to my everyday recipes but wouldn't hesitate to serve to company either.  We added our own soy sauce to taste at the table.

This was a good tasty meal in one dish. It reminded me of those canned chow mein dinners we grew up on, only I liked this much better. It just needed some garlic, ginger, and more veggies like bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, and water chestnuts to make this top notch. I doubled the rice and cut the onion in half. I added a little garlic to the meat as it cooked. I didn't really measure out the chow mein noodles, just covered the top with them. We will definitely fix this again.

I upped the rice to 2c and like so many others, used cream of mushroom soup instead.  Other than that, followed the recipe to the letter. Pretty good stuff, not gourmet by it is a homey, filling dinner. Thanks

This was very good.  I took it to work for lunch and actually had people stop and tell me how good it smelled!  I took some of the advice from other reviews and added a can of water chestnuts to this.  I also toasted the almonds to bring out more of the flavor.  Thanks!  Good recipe!

I replaced the ground beef with beef stew meat that cooked in the slow cooker all day!  Also, I added a can of chop suey vegetables.  I would also suggest adding a can of water chestnuts.  Yummy!

We loved it!  I added just a little more celery and no almonds, because of my husband.  We left the table without any leftovers....so I will be doubling it next time.  My teenagers loved it too!!  Thanks for the recipe!

This has been a go to quick and cheap meal in my family for ages.  Over the years I have changed the recipe and added a packet of onion soup mix, 2 teaspoons of granulated garlic, 1 bunch chopped green onions and 1 can of sliced water chestnuts

This is a good recipe.  I halved the recipe, but left 1 lb of hamburger and the whole can of soup, and about 1 cup of rice, and then cooked in an 8x8 pan. I used celery seed instead of actual celery.  Next time I make this, I will use water chesnuts instead of the almonds.

This is just what I was looking for. Made the recipe as stated, except didn't use any almonds and used a lot more celery. I loved it! I would use about 1/2 cup more rice next time, and maybe try cream of celery. But overall I thought it had a great taste, very comforting.

This is bland, even with the suggested water chestnuts. Some have called it comfort food, but we found it boring.

I made some changes to suit our family's tastes... I used crm of mush, added water chestnuts and substituted cashews for the almonds. I also jazzed up the beef with some spices - an asian blend I have. It was very tasty. Will serve again for sure!

This recipe was fast and easy!  The only suggestions I would make are to add more soy sauce and less celery.  The celery tended to be a bit overpowering and the soy flavor was a little transparent.  Otherwise, it was great!  It made much more than I thought it would!

This recipe has a lot of crunch with the almonds and chow mein noodles, which I really like in casseroles. It's a great variation on the traditional hamburger casserole (usually topped with tater tots). I didn't want to cook rice separately so I used 90 second microwave Teriyaki rice that I had and that worked fine. I also used mushroom soup instead of the chicken as chicken and beef seemed an odd combination. It was quick and easy to make as well. I added Asian Medley microwave steamer veggies as a side. An easy, hearty meal with good flavor and crunch.

we've made this one a several times now and is still surprisingly delicious! (although, we have dubbed this dish: 'Pile', it tastes better than it looks) This is a very forgiving recipe too- water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, throw it in if its sounds good! I like to eat mine with extra soy sauce...

I know this is a staple in households every where, so I thought I would give it a try.  My kids were very willing to try it, but just didn't like it.  I ate it, to avoid having it go to waste - I would say it was OK, but not good.  If you need something quick to fill a space, this is it.  However, it's nothing to write home to Mom about.

Such yummy comfort food. I used the chicken soup and added a can of water chestnuts, and also briwn rice instead of white. A bit healthier and still very tasty.

This was just how I remembered it from growing up.  Great simple recipe to get dinner on the table.  I also add water chestnuts to it to give it a little more flavor and some garlic.

This was a quick and delicious weekday meal...true comfort food that warmed and filled our bellies!  I added some salt and pepper and garlic powder to the ground beedf while browning.  I also threw in some beansprouts fro extra crunch.  I used about a cup of noodles which I stirred right into the casserole and saved a handful to sprinkle on top.  I was very satisfied with the finished casserole and it tasted even better the next day as leftovers for lunch!  Will definitely make this again!

I made this because I had all the ingredients on hand, plus a ton of chow mein noodles that I needed to use up. It was surprisingly really good! I did modify it just a bit to suit our tastes... cream of mushroom instead of chicken, water chesnuts in place of the almonds, and added a can of sliced mushrooms. Don't omit the celery! The flavor really works with this dish. I was afraid the soy sauce would be overpowering, but it was just right. This is very filling! Thanks :)

Made this for the 1st time Monday and from the time I got home from work until we were eating was 45 minutes.  Wife loved it and gave it 4 stars.  After she finished her fourth helping she upped it to five stars.  I threw in some chopped up chicken leftovers, put in water chestnuts and a little more soy sauce, great thing about casseroles, can add just about anything.

My mom used to make this when I was younger - it was my favorite.  Since then I have made it for my husband and whoever else was over at the time and people always rant and rave and say they never knew I was such a good cook =)  I use a can of cream of chix as well, but also add can of cream of celery and then milk to thin out.  I also add mushrooms and more rice - not sure how much more - enough so it isn't soupy.  I most definitely is comfort food!

For this recipe, I changed years ago, skipped the almonds, changed two cans BEEFY MUSHROOM SOUP for the cream of chicken, and two cups cooked rice in place of one plus 1/4 teaspoon fresh ground pepper.

This is comfort food for me... my aunt, who is now 90 years old, used to make her version of it for me and my brother when we were children. So I do it her way. Cream of mushroom soup. And my way... add a bag of stir-fry veggies, some red pepper flakes, ginger, garlic powder... nix the almonds. Sometimes, I add a bit of stir-fry sauce to jazz it up, but whatever, I love it!

For what it is--an easy to prepare casserole--this one gets five stars from me.  The taste isn't sophisticated, but with a really good side dish (I used Asian Coleslaw, available on this website), the casserole really comes alive.  I had it twice today. Next time, I'll probably make a double batch.  If you are looking for tasty and hearty family fare with a very likeable and familiar flavor--this might be it!  I love the crunch that the noodles provide.  If you reheat it, the noodles will soften, so for leftovers, you may wish to add fresh noodles to retain the crunchy consistency.  I will probably add water chestnuts and maybe some Chinese veggies next time.  Great stuff!

This dish turned out wonderful. I added extra seasonings, celery seed, pepper, garlic powder, and a small dash of red pepper. Very robust, filling and aroma makes you hungry. The recipe is easy, you don't have to be exact on the amounts, it is very forgiving for the beginners is the kitchen.

After reading all the reviews, I made the following changes: I used 2 cups of rice, I added a large can of water chesnuts and I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken. I also added fresh mushrooms when I was sauteeing the onions. I was very happy with the result. It was great tasting, easy meal.

Delicious, and very quick & easy to make. Since we like a lot of veggies, I added about 1/2 bag of stir fry vegetables along with some frozen green & red peppers. (It would be fine without them,too.)CindyH

I tried this tonight with leftover turkey instead of hamburger.  Instead of regular rice, I made a package of Uncle Ben's wild rice (mushroom flavor) according to the package directions and added it.  I also added water chestnuts.  It was great!

I'm so glad I found this recipe!  I first found this  recipe in an old, old Betty Crocker cookbook - then I lost the cookbook!   When I make it, when I have it, I add ground pork w/the hamburger - it really ups the flavor.   Then, I add to the meat, and the sauce, minced fresh garlic and ginger and (extra) soy sauce.   That takes it really over the top and adds that Chinese flavor most people look for!  I prefer cashews to almonds but that's just me!  Oh, and since I was out of the Chicken Rice canned soup, I just subbed the equivalent amount of a chicken broth that I made from a good quality chicken base I keep on hand; since the soup is condensed I added extra a little extra chicken base.  Thanks Cindy,  for bringing this dish back to me!

I have been using a different website that had this recipe, and made this for dinner a lot.  I got a new lap top, and lost the website.  I then found it on all recipes, and I have to say, that the other recipe was much better.  For one, they added both cream of chicken and cream of celery.  They also added 5 tablesspoons of soy sauce.  Their recipe is much better, and creamier.  This recipe is somewhat drier, like crumbled ground beef, and didn't have that "aisian flare", somehat bland.  So you may want to add another can of cream soup, and definitely more soy sauce.

Had to use up flour taco shells so I sliced and put them on the bottom of the greased baking dish.  My children love the oowey goowey shells on bottoms of all caseroles.  Thanks Cindy B for a nice recipe.

My husband says I should definitely make this one again.  I agree.  I didn't have almonds on hand, so I toasted some sesame seeds.  We really liked that flavor.  Other than that, I made no changes.  I did cook it about 1/2 hour longer, because we like the noodles on top browned and crispy.

I have a simlar recipe but instead of the cream of chicken I used cream of mushroom, cream of celery and chicken and rice and then just add a 1/2 cup of minute rice...I do bump up the soy sauce a tad too. I bake it covered for 30 minutes and then remove the cover and add the noodles and bake for additional 10 minutes.

This recipe is OK for the kids but isn't anything special.  I made a few changes, cut the onions to a cup, added water chestnuts, added another cup of rice, added  a tbsp of brown sugar, added some fresh diced garlic, and of course some salt and pepper. I liked my recipe better  but my wife said it was still missing something.

EXCELLENT!  Though the noodles aren't crunchy when you eat it for left-overs, it still tastes great.  Add a little water to it when reheating.  Delicious!

My family has been making this dish for years, but we've never classified it as an 'Asian' dish. After reading some of the review, several people called the dish bland. I like to season the beef with ground pepper and a little bit of cumin, as well as adding garlic and a few dashes of cayenne pepper. Also, make sure you use actual chow mein noodles as opposed to rice noodles- you loose the 'crunch' factor with the tiny rice noodles.

Great and easy to make. I also add extra rice and some ginger as most reviewers have noted. If you don't have celery try a can of water chestnuts or some Asian-style pea pods for extra crunch and color.

I've made this recipe 4-5 times now and my young daughters all enjoy it!  I also used 2 cups rice and omit the almonds.  I did try with cream of mushroom soup once when I didn't have cream of chicken on-hand -- the cream of chicken soup definitely tastes better.

Easy enough but not a big hit with my family.  My daughter said it was too salty and she just picked at her plate and hubby didn't like the chow mein noodles so even though I thought this was a good/quick weeknight meal, I don't think I will be making it again.

I follwed the suggestion of another review and used water chestnuts instead of almonds. I also used a little more soy and a lot of black pepper.  This was very easy and actually quite tasty.

This is a five star recipe with the following changes and additions:
Use one can cream of mushroom, one can cream of celery.
Add one can of sliced water chestnuts.
Add either one can of mushrooms or fresh.
Up rice to one and a half cups, you can just pour in uncooked white rice.
I have never used beef, I always use ground turkey and it tastes delicious!
Bake at 375 for 45-50 min until bubbly, do not put on chow mein noodles until the last 10 minutes in oven.  Divide noodles so you have some to top each serving with for crunch.

My family really liked this! I served steamed oriental dumplings with plum sauce or honey garlic sauce with it! I do think next time I'm going to try adding a little green pepper to the casserole next time, just because i think it would go well.

My mom used to make something like this when I was growing up.  Very tasty.  Good for leftover lunches also.  I did use cream of mushroom soup.

So easy, and I'm always looking for easy! My mother made something like this, too.  My teens loved it! Like others, I changed the soup to cream of mushroom, added water chestnuts, peas, fresh garlic, pepper, a little cayenne pepper for heat and used ground turkey. I baked with the Chinese noodles and they do not go soggy when lightly placed on top.  I would add a little more soy sauce.  It was definitely comfort food, not gourmet...just good. ;)

My mom used to make this - probably one of my favorite meals. I have varied it by omitting the onions/celery/almonds and substituting a can of chinese vegetables. Either way, if I need a comfort food, this tops my list.

A house guest requested this recipe since his mom used to make it when he was a kid.  It was different, not something I would normally make.  I added mushrooms and water chestnuts, used garlic almonds that you find in the salad section.  I also added plenty of garlic salt and pepper.  Both of my children loved it, good comfort food.

Fast weekday meal.  We make ours a little different...maybe even easier.  Brown 1 lb hamburger or ground Turkey with 1 small onion chopped. ADD:  1 can cream of Mushroom OR 1 can cream of Chix soup. Plus, 1 can of Chix Noodle Soup, 1 cup instant rice, 1 cup water and sliced water chestnuts (optional).  Stir in pan and pour into 9x13 pan - bake at 350 till edges start to bubble.  Top with chow mein noodles and back till crisp.  It's a kid family favorite.

This was alright. Mine turned out pretty dry.  I toasted the almonds before adding them so that added some good flavor. I've been making something similar for years using left over meat loaf and egg noodles.  I think I'll stick to that.

We liked this. I used 1 1/2 cups of rice and that seemed just right for the amount of ground beef. I used ideas from others and added ginger, garlic powder and water chestnuts. I think next time I will add mushrooms too. Will definitely make this again soon.

This was an okay meal - not bad once in a while, but not a favorite.  I also found that doubling the rice and soup made for a better tasting dish.

Very cruncy casserole, but pretty bland...even after adding garlic powder and more soy.  Would cream of celery soup be better than cream of chicken?

I am so surprised this wasn't that good!  My biggest issue is it was TOO DRY...I followed other readers suggestions and used 2 cups of rice, which I think was necessary, but I think it needed 2 cans of soup to work with the extra rice, and I only used one as the original recipe suggested!  So, while I like the ingredients, I wouldn't make it again...if I do, I will try it with the extra can of soup just to see if that helps.

This is one of my  favorite recipes. Been making it for at least 15 years or more. Great for potlucks. Heats up well and can be made ahead of time, frozen & poped in the oven when you come home from work. Very easy to put together. I add extra water chestnuts as we love the crunch.

I loved it, picky hubby hated it. I used the mushroom soup instead of the cream of chicken, added water chestnuts and Asian spice blend. Hubby said it was too bland, I thought it could have used some more spices but overall I liked it.

I don't add the noodles before baking, I toast them slightly in my toaster oven (watch, don't burn!) and everyone sprinkles them on at the table according to taste. We also pass the soy sauce, and black pepper in case someone wants more. The cream soup can be celery, mushroom or chicken and you can add stuff or leave stuff out and adjust to taste or what you have on hand within reason... It's so versatile! This is so good with a side of fresh fruit salad.

I am giving this a 3 and only a 3 because my family liked this and I did not. The taste was not that great. Not terrible...just not something that I would look forward to making again. I would however suggest putting others things in there to spice it up...maybe some pea pods and the like.

We loved it!!!!  Added a can of mushrooms,used cream of mushroom soup and "veggie meat" instead of hamburger.  My non-vegetarian husband did not know the difference.  The leftovers were delicious also.  Would recommend only putting the noodles on half if you are expecting to have leftovers as they did get soggy.

I thought this was yummy!  I'd do a few things differently though:  would probably add water chestnuts or bamboo shoots, and would hold back the amount of chow mein noodles.

This was great for a quick dinner.  Make it as is or add some water chestnuts, pea pods, whatever you prefer.  I passed it around to my co-workers who all tried it and everyone thought it was definitely a keeper.

As many others did, I used Cream of Mushroom soup instead of chicken and left out the almonds.  Next time I will be adding water chestnuts and more veggies.  The flavor was great but a little heavy on the hamburger.

My Mom made this when I was a kid and it still brings back so many memories.  I usually double the rice, soup, and water.  I also substitute the almonds for sliced water chestnuts.   My family loves this.  I also put the Chinese noodles around the edges so that my picky eaters can eat without the noodles.

I was hungry for a chow mein noodle casserole I made many years ago. I couldn't find it ANYWHERE on the internet so decided to combine the two. The AllRecipes version is not quite the same. My recipe called for a can of mixed vegetables so I added that.  Otherwise I would suggest to doctor it up to taste!

Been making this for years. If you use Minute rice and two cans of cream soup you can skip cooking the rice separate. Tastes the same. I add mushrooms. My boys grew up on this. Fast weeknight meal.

used onion powder, garlic powder, celery salt, a little ground mustard, salt and pepper on ground beef.  Used 2 C of rice, mixed with cream of chicken and herbs, a few slivered almonds (meant to add toasted sesame seeds but forgot).  Kids liked but didn't love.  Liked it without the noodles on top.

My teenage daughter approves this dish because it reminds her of Hamburger Helper, which is great because this is much healthier!

I doubled the rice, used 1.5 lbs of ground beef, but would recommend also doubling the celery.  Next time, I might add additional veggies - maybe green beans, peas, carrot slivers.

Like others, I used cream of mushroom soup and 2 cups of rice.  It reminds me of my childhood so that is why I think I love this recipe so much.  It's not fancy but it just tastes good to me.

I got this recipe out of a sunset cookbook 40 years ago, minus the almonds. Back then all you could get in most grocery stores was La Choy soy sauce, for my own taste I have found it works the best.

I have a similar recipe that I like a bit more..... it uses Cream of MUSHROOM soup and canned or sautéed mushrooms and bamboo shoots cut into thin matchsticks.  NO water! Soy sauce and condensed Cr of Mush soup are the only liquids.  I omit the celery, but the almonds are a must!!  Place in BUTTERED casserole and bake

This is a really tasty casserole. The only problem I had was the chow mein noodles started to burn on top. I had to take some off before I served it. I think next time I make this, I will add them halfway through the cooking time.

I love this recipe!  I customize by using Cream of Mushroom instead of CofChicken, and add a can of Chicken Noodle Soup too.  I definitely double or more the rice with more soy as well.

We don't add the almonds or noodles because we don't like the crunch. I used cream of mushroom soup instead. I always double the batch. Great every time! UPDATE: I don't bake this any more. It's fine on the stove top with modifications. I don't use almonds. I use 1/4 c water. I saute my celery and onions a bit with some oil, then add the beef. Then I toss it all together. Done in 15 min.

I've made this recipe twice now, and both times it was delicious!  The first time I did exactly as the recipe stated (minus the celery since my husband won't touch the stuff), and he loved it.  When I made it again tonight, I used fresh, crushed garlic while browing the ground beef, c.o. mushroom soup, made beefy flavored rice, and had to turn this into cashew chow mein (thought I had almonds in the freezer, but I was wrong.)  I added about 3/4 cup of cashew pieces.  My family went absolutely crazy over this version, and my daughter want's me to make it for a party she's going to this weekend.  Thanks, Cindy, for a great and easy-as-pie recipe!

This was an easy recipe. I made it for that reason alone. The kids really liked it, the hubby and I could take or leave it. Just so so. Made with garlic as suggested and added fresh mushrooms to it. Didn't mix the rice with the meat mixture and bake it. Instead added the soup, water, etc. to the meat and just served it over hot rice.

I made this casserole with some suggested changes and some of my own.  I omitted the celery since we dont like it, and added some salt, pepper, minced garlic, chinese pea pods, garlic flavored "almond accents," and used beefy mushroom soup instead of the cream of chicken soup.  I also added a couple of cans of sliced water chestnuts that I had drained and marinated overnight with low sodium soy sauce.  I also increased the amount of rice and kept some chow mein noodles to add on top of each serving.  We enjoyed this, but the pea pods look kind of wrinkled if you reheat this the next day.

I tried this last night.  It was ok, but kind of bland.  I think it needs extra soy sauce or some other spices.

This was o.k.  I used Worcestershire Sauce in place of the Soy sauce just for that different flavor.  I also doubled the rice and used ground turkey.  I take a couple cups of this mix out before adding the soup (picky non-canned soup lover husband).  I also did not have chow mein noodles, so tried the canned fried onions.  They were pretty good.  Kept them covered for most of the cooking to avoid burning them.

On a scale of 1 to 10, my husband and I both gave this a 6.
Not bad, but also, not fantastic.

This has become a family favorite - I've made it twice in 2 weeks! My husband and 3 year old daughter love it, and my mother-in-law raved about it when she had it while visiting us. It's REALLY versatile, you can use whatever you have on hand, it's quick, and it's filling. Hooray!

I loved it, very different.  My fiance didn't like it, but he told me afterwards that he doesn't like chow mein noodles or cooked almonds!
It is pretty salty, so you might want to use low sodium soup and/or soy sauce if you don't like salt.

This recipe was easy and tasty.  It's also very versatile.  I've added bean sprouts, more veggies, etc. and a little less noodles and it always comes out good.  Makes quite a bit too.  A definite keeper.

I was a little disappointed in this recipe.  It wasn't very flavorfull and the noodles made the dish a little dry.  It could use some zing! I might try 2 cans of soup, garlic, more soy sauce, green pepper and X-tra spices next time.  I think that would be a whole new recipe.  Maybe I should post it later.

I was afraid to uses 3 tablespoons of soy sauce, but I left all other salt out and it was delicious.
