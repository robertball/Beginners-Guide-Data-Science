I loved these as posted, then I made some changes to try to duplicate the real Spanish version of these delightful cookies, but many will probably be turned off by the LARD.

Substitute lard for the butter, double the cinnamon in the cookie, and roll in sesame seeds instead of the sugar/cinnamon coating. They should come out super soft like fine sand and just hold together. In Spain they are traditionally wrapped after baking and you SQUEEZE the cookie before unwrapping so it holds together. Forget Chocolate Chip or Peanut Butter Cookies, THIS IS WHAT COOKIES ARE ALL ABOUT!

A not too sweet little cinnamon cookie just perfect for a little something with a cup of coffee.  Don't be afraid to coat the cookie well with the sugar/cinnamon mixture and be careful not to overbake.  It should be a soft, tender cookie that just melts in your mouth.  Not good however, for those who need a heavy sugar kick.

These actually turned out really good...I tasted them when they were warm and  I was ready to throw them away. But when my husband got home, he tried them and loved them.  I tried them again and these cookies are definitely cookies that need to be cooled down before eaten. After they cooled down, they tasted just what I expected them to taste. Will definitely make again.

Fast, easy, and delicious!  I made these late at night for my daughter's Spanish class the next morning.....she said everybody loved them.....the teacher said if she'd make him another batch, he'd give her an A on her final! I made it just like the recipe says and they were perfect....melt in your mouth!

I rated a 4 instead of a 5 because it just doesn't say "WOW" to me but it is still very MARVELOUS! Honestly, I think it's just a personal preference thing....that's why you should read more than one review right?

Followed the recipe exactly and turned out great..HOWEVER... like others have said, it is not necessary to make that large of the cinnamon mixture.  Just make the balls first..., eye your cookie balls and just guess logically how much sugar you should use...it's pretty obvious not a whole cup.

Weird how people complain or like that it's doughy.  People shouldn't even mention that! It's obvious that you should've baked it longer or less based your preferences. My first batch turned out dry (baked too long) and so my second batch I baked it shorter. My point is...this cookie CAN be dry.

This recipe is worthy of making again in the future! It IS one of those melt-in-your-mouth type cookies.

The recipes did not produce 24 cookies, but they were still very good.  I would add a little granulated sugar to the poweredsugar/cinammon mixture that you roll the balls in to make them a bit tastier, but I really liked them.  Softening the butter at the beginning of the recipe really helps.

these are very good, will definitely be on my Christmas list next year! I doubled the vanilla and cinnamon in the cookies, next time use 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 cup icing sugar for rolling, 1 tbsp scoop made 37 cookies, 15 minutes was perfect, tossed cookies in leftover sugar and cinnamon mixture.

Anytime I go to Texas I search out these cookies from local Mexican bakeries. I tried this recipe and it was just like those in the Lone Star State. I hate creaming butter, but in this case it's worth it! I"m so glad to finally make these in my own home. Thanks!!

I followed this recipe to the letter and knew I was in trouble when instead of a "stiff dough" I ended up with a powdery, crumbling mess that wouldn't stick together for anything. Can anyone tell me how to fix that?

Fantastic, easy cookies. However, I only used 1/2 a cup of confectioners sugar for the coating and still had a lot extra. I also doubled the cinnamon all around and it tastes great.

Very easy to make. The taste is also light and yummy, and the fact that I love cinnamon is a big factor.
I used only about 2 tbsp sugar + 1 tsp cinnamon for the topping, and I still have just a bit left.

This is an overall good recipe because it does not require milk or eggs,both of which I don't have in my fridge at the moment. There needs to be a bit more flour in the recipe, and the cinnamon sugar mixture should be cut in half. Other than these two small problems, the cookies are great.

These are delicious! I coated before baking in the confectioner's sugar/cinnamon mixture, but then after baking I coated again in granulated sugar/cinnamon, which is the way they are often served here in Texas.  Thanks for sharing.

I also tweaked this recipe slightly, and was very happy with the results: I doubled the recipe amounts for a larger yield, and also added an extra 1/4 cup more powdered sugar, 1/3 cup more flour, and 1/2 tsp more vanilla for the dough, as well as quadrupling the amount of cinnamon for the dough (baking mellows out cinnamon enormously). Cinnamon sugar powder: I only needed about a cup of powdered sugar and I put quadruple amount of cinnamon for that as well, sifting the sugar and cinnamon together. When you bake them, it melts the sugar and cinnamon coating, providing a very thin sweet coating to a light buttery cookie. Be careful if you make small, truly 1 inch diameter balls, the bottoms can caramelize and burn quickly. (caramelization is okay, burning is not, but burning quickly follows caramelization). Please keep in mind that the extra amounts of sugar, flour and cinnamon I added are for a doubled recipe of 48 yield. Delicious! I'm going to make these for christmas gifts when that time of year comes around...

I love this recipe!!!! I wish I could rate it more than 5 stars.  It's AWSOME & VERY EASY TO MAKE.  It's added to my recipe collection.  The only thing I'll change is to add a little more cinnamon.   They're great with coffee.  Thanks for the recipe & Happy Holidays.

I absolutely love this recipe! Every time I make it for fiestas in my Spanish class every one asks me are those the cinnamon cookies! They love them and they are easy to make. These are one of my favorite cookies and if you need something Mexican to take to a party this is what you should make but don't expect to be taking any home because they will be gone!

These cookies are so easy and full of wonderful cinnamon flavor.  I made the mistake of not rolling the balls in the powder sugar and cinnamon mixture before baking, something that I have never seen in a recipe. I instead rolled them in the sugar mixture after they cooled for a few minutes. The result was still a wonderful tasting cookie. They were crispy on the outside, yet melt in your mouth tender on the inside. They were ready to take out of the oven in about l2 minutes. They will be ready when they are just brown around the edges, watch closely. Thanks so much for sharing!

Yummy!  These cookies were good.  I had been looking for a recipe similar to this one.  I substituted Anise Seed Extract instead of the vanilla ~ since the cookie I was looking for had Anise Extract in it.  I am happy I tried this because they came out perfect.  Also I followed another reviewers suggestion and added a full teaspoon vs. the 1/2 tsp. it calls for in the recipe.

Just as another reviewer stated, these cookies are meant to be dry.  Polvo means dust.

I agree with others and had lots of the topping left over.  I also found the dough not stiff enough to roll into balls, so I added a little extra flour.  Good cinnamon taste!

Needed a Mexican cookie for a cookout. These were outstanding! I did as others suggested. Doubled the cinnamon and vanilla in the recipe. After I baked them, I rolled them one more time in the powdered sugar and cinnamon mix. They just melt in your mouth. Big thumbs up!

These are awesome. My go to recipe whenever my daughter needs to bring something to Spanish class. I always double the recipe. I also use a small cookie scoop to make sure the size is consistent. Make 1/2 or even 1/4 of the amount of sugar called for to roll the cookies in. I also put the dough in the frig in between batches because the warm butter gets pretty soft.

Very easy, tasty cookies! I used margarine instead of butter since that's what I had on hand. I also added 1/4 C more sugar and left out 1/4 C flour to make them sweeter. They spread out a bit more than the ones pictured, but they were very yummy!

Oh these are amazing, i added nutmeg to the mixture though, and brown sugar instead of granulated sugar to the final coating. Just remember, that when you form the balls, dont handle too much, because the butter will melt too fast and when baking, go flat instead of retaining their round shape. Roll between palms!

For those of you (such as me) that haven't had "Polvorones de Canele" before, they are like a tasty cross between shortbread and snickerdoodles. Next time, I'm definately doubling the recipe as it doesn't make many and I'm using more cinnamon (1.5 tsp)in the batter for more flavor. As another reviewer suggested, definately watch the cooking time closely.  In my oven, it only takes 12 minutes to perfect doneness.

Was told by my son that these have to be made again and again.  They melt in your mouth!  I would like to try adding a bit more cinnamon in the dough next time but that is personal preference.  Great tasting cookie!  These don't spread out at all so I was able to fit a lot on a pan.

These cookies came out great! I made them for a "Western" party at work, and they garnered many compliments, including "If Danielle makes cookies, you KNOW they'll be awesome! She's the cookie lady." I referred people to this recipe. These cookies came out so fluffy, yet moist, they just melted in your mouth. And the slightly hardened sugar coating added to the contrast of the wonderful light cookie below. Now, I  have a really wacky oven...it's about 40 years old and needs replaced. :) so i had to set my oven to 250 degrees, otherwise the sugar burned and the cookie was undercooked (i only mention it because who knows how many other wacky ovens are out there!) It was also very humid the day I made them, and super hot, so the dough came out too gooey to be rolled in balls. I added extra powdered sugar and flour (just a little) to compensate for this, and put the dough in the fridge for an hour. I will DEFINITELY be making these again! :) Thanks!

Initially the consistency of the dough was to moist and sticky, so I added a 1/2 cup of flour and also used 1 tsp. instead of 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon. Next time I would only use 1/2 cup of icing sugar to roll the cookies in instead of 1 cup, as I found it to be wasteful. Turned out to be a great recipe! It reminds me of a cinnamon version of butterball cookies.

I have made these twice now and I just love bringing them to parties.  They're quick and simple to make and they have so much flavor!  I do add a bit more cinnamon.  Don't over-bake or they'll be too dry.

These are like crisp butter cookies with cinnamon.  I took these to work - I work with 4 Argentine immigrants and they devoured them.  They loved them and made them feel right at home.  This will go in my collection of cookies to repeat.

Awesome!!! This recipe was so easy and great for high altitude. I had to find something to bake and bring to work for a 'theme' pot-luck and this was a big hit. I did not make any adjustments and the worked perfectly. Had to keep an eye on them to make sure I did not over bake. Thank you!!!

I thought they were Great! but it needed a bit more flour because the dough would stick to my hands but other than that they were great. I also doubled the cinnamon :)

I made these thinking they would be a good subsitute for snowballs (Mexican wedding cake) cookies.  They really aren't like those, though.    These are like a shortbread, very melt in the mouth consistency.  I would add more cinnamon in the dough next time because I really like cinnamon and as written its pretty subtle.   You could use the abundant cinnamon/sugar to roll the cookies in after they are baked.

So yummy! Definitely a crumbly, dry cookie but if that's what you're in the mood for, this is the best recipe out there! I think I've found my new favorite cookie! The recipe is super easy to follow and I didn't need to make any adjustments, except for adding a bit more flour so the dough wouldn't be so sticky. I also baked them for 10 mins and checked on them every 2, and they were done in about 14. I'll definitely be making these again!

these were soooo very good. My son's Spanish Teacher loved them. I made some changes on the 2nd batch just for my own taste...1 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  when doubling the recipe add 1/3 cup more flour and 1/2 tsp more vanilla.  I also added 2 Tblsp granulated sugar to the confectioners sugar before rolling cookies in it.

These cookies are so easy to make and so yummy!  We had a "snow day" the other day, so the kids and I decided to make cookies.  I was out of eggs, and picked this recipe.  I'm so glad I did--the kids love them, and my husband (who claims to not like cinnamon) really enjoyed them as well.  They just melt in your mouth!  I did not have to bake them for 15 minutes, more like 11, but my oven does tend to run a bit hot.  I've passed this recipe on to some family members and will certainly make it again!

I am very happy with how this cookie turned out.  I upped the cinnamon to 1 tsp and used anise instead of vanilla extract.  I had no problems with the dough, it was a perfect consistency.  I made my balls small, I ended up with 32 cookies.  Mine turned out perfectly rounded just like the picture.  I baked them exactly 15 minutes and the cookies were melt in your mouth, not under cooked or over dry.  I recommend using confectioners' sugar as the recipe states to roll them in, they had a delicous coating.

Very tasty cookies, I'll be making these for a family event next time. I also had a large amount of "topping" left. I would recommend halfing that and adding more cinnamon to the actual cookies themselves.

These are the simplest cookies I've ever made.  I always have the ingredients on hand so I can whip up a batch without running to the store.  The only problem, is that every time I share them, I have to remember to bring the recipe with me because everyone wants it!

These are fabulous! I did increase the cinnamon in the dough a bit and eyed them instead of cooking them for a specific time (when they were slightly cracked on top, I called them done), and for what it's worth, I did toss them again very gently in cinnamon sugar once they had cooled a few minutes. I think these are excellent and will definitely make them again in the future! This recipe is a keeper!

Wow! I thought these were great! I agree that the dough was a little sticky, so I put in the refrigerator before rolling into balls. That worked. I made them into 1 inch balls like recipe calls for (made 28). I think I would make them smaller next time (they do increase in size – not quite double). I decided to powder the cookies after baking with the confectioners sugar/cinnamon also. I still had plenty of the mixture leftover. These were melt in your mouth delicious and extremely easy/quick to make! Wow!

I am in love with these cookies!! They taste just like the biscochos at the farmer's market. I add cayenne to the coating and re-coat them after they have cooled. Don't try to substitute margarine, they will be chewy. Delicious!!!!

I picked this recipe because it seemed easy in terms of both labor and ingredients. I cooked them an extra 5 minutes and they came up very light, some might find them dry but I think they are meant to be light and crumbly. The one odd thing was that the sugar coating ended up separating and damp. I am not sure how this happened but they are still delicious.

I absolutely loved these cookies. Contrary to some of the reviews, they were soooooo simple to make. My neighbor and I made these for our multicultural event at school. With both of us being thirteen and beginner cooks, we needed something simple and quick (the party was in 2 hours!). This recipe was fantastic for our purposes. We showed up with two plates of these cookies all were gone in a matter of minutes. Fortunately, I had the opportunity to taste one for myself and I was impressed. Many of the attendants loved them as well. I would definitely recomend them. (;

For a churro-like topping, substitute the confectioner's sugar for granulated sugar for the cinnamon mixture.

The ONLY thing I changed was that I used 1 & 1/4 cups of flour instead of 1 & 1/2.  Baked for 15 minutes........WONDERFUL!!!! My mother in law came over while they were baking and the first thing she said after "wow" was "melts in your mouth".....Just as described!!!!

I made these for a bake sale and people loved them. I found them to be a little buttery for my tastes and they didn't stay round. But if I ever did a bake sale I would make again, they went super fast!

These tasted just like the ones I had at a party this weekend.  I wanted more of a shortbread taste and less cinnamon so I didn't add cinnamon to the mixture you roll the cookies in.  It was perfect!  The ones I ate at the party were little round balls.  I wonder how she got them to stay round?

Followed this recipe exactly. The taste of flour was overwhelming. I agree with the other reviewer that said the cinnamon sugar coating could be cut in half. We ended up with way too much left over.

These cookies taste 'ok',  but they're flat (nothing like the ones shown in the picture) and they're very dry and grainy...I followed the instructions exactly so I'm not sure how to make the difference, they probably would taste a lot better with the appropriate revisions.

They were easy to make, but I did not like the final result.  My husband didn't like them either and requested a class of water to wash the dryness down.  I guess it all depends on your taste.

I have to say these things melt in your mouth.  I did take ideas from others and doubled the cinnamon (instead of 1/2 I put 1 tsp of cinnamon).  Another thing I also changed was that instead of rolling the ball of dough in the sugar/cinnamon mixture, I baked them first.  After they were done cooling, I rolled then in the sugar/cinnamon mixture.

Loved these cookies! Next time will decrease the baking time a bit as they came out a bit hard, but still very good. Baked them 15 minutes, next time will start checking at 10 minutes.

Very yummy-soft, melt in your mouth!  The only thing I would do differently is to recoat the cookies when still warm as this forms a wonderful cinnamon icing on the cookies :)

Wonderful! I followed the directions exactly and was worried they would burn cooking them for 20 minutes. However they turned out brilliantly. Rich, delicate and melt in your mouth!

I decided to make these cookies on a whim... soon after I realized that there were no eggs in the refrigerator! I followed the recipe as printed, except I added more cinnamon in both the cookie and the topping. ( I love it!) They just got out of the oven, and I tasted one as soon as it was cool enough. They were really good! If you are looking for a really sweet cookie than than don't make this. But if you want subtle sweetness, than you've found the right recipe!

I made these exactly as written....and...I thought they were a pain to make!  Dough really needs to get firm in order to "roll into balls".  They were very sticky while handling...But, they were a HIT!  Brought them to work for cinco de mayo and they were gone by 9:30 am!  Just let the dough firm up and you will be all set!

I made these cookies exactly as the recipe stated and found the dough to be very sticky rather than stiff as the recipe said it would be.  Once baked the cookies fell apart and tasted like eating a stick of butter.  Several people at the party I brought these too also tried them and agreed. I was very disappointed as I usually have success with well-rated recipes from this site.

I made these for a Cindo de mayo get together & while they weren't a hit (too much other food to choose from), they did have a really good flavor. My only complaint is that they crumbled easily. I got almost 3 dozen small cookies out of this recipe.

Very nice little cookies.  They are crunchy yet soft and crumbly all at the same time.  Not a very sweet cookie; so if you have a sweet tooth, this might not satisfy it.  I don't have much of one, so these are nice for me.   I got 21 cookies out of the dough, so this batter does not make that many at all.  I used my small cookie scoop, though, so if you make much smaller cookies you'd get more.  Very easy, just takes a bit of time to dip in the sugar/cinnamon mixture and bake.  I didn't use the amount of sugar and cinnamon called for dipping; that would have been way too much.  I used about a 1/4 c of sugar and maybe 1/4 tsp cinnamon, and I had only a small amount left over.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made these tonight. But before I started, I read the reviews. I added more cinnamon and sugar once they were almost cooled. My husband gobbled them up. He LOVED them! Saving them for another time. THey are super easy to make. They yield a lot of cookies tool  But they go fast, since they are so small :)

Very good and easy to make.  Reminds of of snickerdoodle cookies.  I must have done something wrong because when they cooked they flattened out instead of staying in a round ball like the picture.  But the taste was wonderful!

Very good!  These melt in your mouth and have a lovely light cinnamon flavor.  Very quick and easy, I whipped up a triple recipe and had nearly 100 cookies for a party.  Also I froze them and they thaw like fresh.  Couldn't tell the difference.

They are similar to a dry snickerdoodle.  I like the buttery, almost flaky texture, and the look very pretty after baking.  My classmates approved as well.

Good recipe, to make them sweeter I added 1/3 c white sugar and 1/3 c brown sugar. Also following the suggestions of others I decreased the sugar cinnamon mix for the rolling part and added brown and white sugar to that as well. Overall, mine turned out delish and went GREAT warmed up with vanilla ice cream!

These are sooo good! They just melt in your mouth. I added a little extra cinnamon to the dough, and had to use another 1/2c flour to get the dough firm enough to roll. Also used 3T powdered sugar and 1tsp cinnamon for the topping, and still had a little bit left over.  Will definately make these again.

I love these cookies!  The only change I made was to increase the cinnamon in the cookie to 1 tsp.  I decided to do half the batch rolled in the powdered sugar/cinnamon mixture and the other half rolled in sesame seeds (thanks to oz's comments) and it made for two pretty different, outstanding cookies.  I love sesame so I liked the sesame ones a lot, but most of the people I had try them preferred the ones without the sesame seeds.  Although my husband thought they were "dry", I don't require all of my cookies to be chewy and gooey, so I loved the texture. The "melt in your mouth" description in some of the comments is completely accurate.  A lovely, light cookie, made with just a few ingredients that I generally have on hand.  Well done!

My husband needed a dessert for the Mexican bar at work but one co-worker is deathly allergic to nuts so we tried these. They were gone in a flash. I didn't care for them but I don't care much for cinnamon and thought they were greasy but I didn't have to eat more than one.

These were the hit of the night at my Mexican themed deck party last night.  I loved how easy they were to make & they were nice & light which was great after a VERY filling meal.  I accidentally cooked one batch longer & so I would say to anyone who makes these, make sure to only bake for 15-16 minutes so that they are still super soft in the middle.  Overall, loved the texture and flavor...thank you so much for sharing this delightful recipe!   :)

Melt-in-your-mouth WONDERFUL! These come together very quickly and baked into beautiful puffs (they don't flatten much). What a fun, new recipe for me - a nice twist on a snickerdoodle-type recipe. I found that I didn't need all the sugar/cinnamon mixture; lots of extra.

This recipe is great, just like my mom's. we make them every year during the holidays. I add more cinnamon and roll them twice, once right after the oven and a second time after they have cooled completely. Yum, yum.

Very airy and crumbly cookie with an overwhelmingly buttery taste. You definitely need something to drink with these. Unlike some other reviewers, I thought the cookie was very sweet and had too much cinnamon. I guess my personal preference is for something more substantive. Mine flattened only very slightly on the bottom and crisped around the edges. I think with the high butter content of the cookie, it isn't really necessary to oil the cookie sheet. I baked the cookies for only 10 minutes. I don't know if I'll make them again because I really prefer something more doughy. However, if you really like cookies that fall apart the second you bite into them, then this might be the cookie for you. Frankly, once it gets into your mouth, though, it's like sucking on powdered sugar.

This is a AWESOME RECIPE!!!!! O_O i will be making this again and again my whole fam loved it. i also used less powdered sugar,added 2 tbs of suger and added more cinnamon to the cookies and the powdered sugar mix. Just to make it sweeter and have more of a cinnamon taste, If you dont do that it will still taste just as good but i think the modified version is better. Oh and one more tip dont use 1 cup of powerded sugar that is waayyy too much use less even a haft a cup is too much. :]

Awesome cookies, a little less sweet and a nice cinnamon tang.  They didn't even make it out of the tupperware and onto the plate.  I was not able to get them to stop flattening out, but I hope to remedy that next time.  The quantity of cookies was a nice excuse for me to buy some new cookie sheets, WOWZA can you get differences between types.

these were yummy. they smelled like cinnamon buns baking.  the batter is definatly buttery, but once you roll it in the powdered sugar mix, it holds its ball form nicely.  when they come out of the oven, they crumble when you take a bite. its a nice texture. they are not super cinnamony, but that is ok. i definatly like them. not fantastic, but not bad by any means.  a good simple easy cookie to make

Absolutely yummy! These remind me of those little powdered donuts you buy in the wrappers. So good. So easy to make. Wish I would have doubled the recipe...but then I would have eaten twice as much! 

Will definitely make again!

These went over big at our "Marching Taco" party at work. They were easy to mix up, a little time consuming to roll but very much worth it. I always use real butter, and Watkins Cinnamon and Vanilla. Also, a tablespoon cookie scoop is a good investment, and makes the perfect sized cookies. I know I will make these again.

Very good cookie.  Although, anyone who has ever had the 'Goldylocks' version knows that this recipe isn't quite the same.  Still, it is very good and it will be a regular in my cookie rotation.

Made them for a tapas party we were hosting. Doubled the cinnamon as recommended, and although they are slightly undercooked, they taste terrific! Thanks

These are much drier than a typical cookie but that is how they are supposed to be.  The name of the cookie comes from the word "polvo", meaning "powder" in Spanish.  These cookies are exactly that - powdery.  The topping definitely makes too much, so try rolling the cookies in the leftover topping while they are still warm. This recipe worked out fine!

My nieces and I enjoyed the flavor! Delicious and easy. I did add extra sugar and cinnamon, but that's because I like them sweeter.

While I am sure this recipe is supposed to produce a dry cookie, these were awful. In order to form a stiff dough I added additional flour as I read about in other reviews. The cookie itself did not taste bad but it was so dry that it was very hard to chew. These cookies were the laughing stock of a Mexican themed party I brought them to. I would never make them again.

This cookie is exceptional!  I recently made and took them to my Cinco de Mayo spanish party, and my freinds begged for more.  I only had one problem, the dough was not forming quite right, but once I added more flour, it came out great. Also, I had extra cinnomon/sugar left over, so we are using it for french toast topping.  Great recipe! :)

After getting the dough mixed, I found it to not be sweet at all.  I added another 1/2 cup of sugar.  Did not help the cookies.  I even dusted them with sugar after they were done.  They have the consistancy of oatmeal cookies.  No one in my home would eat them.  I guess it is an acquired taste.  I threw the recipe away.

Excellent cookies. They were too easy to gobble up, and didn't last very long in my house. I found it to be a flexible recipe and very customizable. Can we do something about the spelling in the title? The word should be "canela", not "canele?

Made per recipe and it baked up 
Ike powder. I thought refrigerating the dough would help, but it didn’t. I added quite a bit of flour to the second round of dough so it was at least moldeable at room temp. Not the best recipe, certainly.

The first try with this recipe, I was really underwhelmed by the lack of cinnamon coming through once the cookies cooled.  It was more like butter sugar cookies, which I'm not a big fan of.

On the second try, I increased the cinnamon in the batter to about 1 1/2 teaspoons, and the vanilla to about a table spoon. For the powdered sugar, I upped the cinnamon to 1 1/2 teaspoons and made sure not to dust off too much of the sugar coating before placing it on my baking sheet to give it more of a crunch once they've cooled. 

These turned out very delicious, not too much cinnamon, but just enough to actually taste it rather than the buttery confectioner's sugar taste (bleh). And this is coming from someone who's not a fan of sugar cookie-esque recipes. lol

EXCELLENT!  The family gobbled them up quickly.  My picky kiddo said they were the best cookies she'd ever eaten!  I didn't have any issues with dry dough like some reviews mentioned- in fact my dough was a little on the wet side, so I ended up letting it chill for 30 minutes before shaping it.  The dough was easy to work with.  After rolling the dough in the powdered sugar mixture I returned to the fridge for another 10 minutes or so before baking.  After removing from the oven I was little disappointed by how little powdered sugar I could see on the outside so I rolled each of them in the extra powdered sugar mixture (there was plenty) while they were still warm and then allowed to cool.  Definitely a keeper!

These turned out like extra good Snickerdoodles.  The dough was too soft to roll into cookies, so I put it in the fridge for an hour, then it was fine.  The only thing I changed was using regular white sugar and cinnamon to roll them into and get that "sandy' effect.  Delicious.

I made these cookies for a Spanish project and they turned out great! The only thing is that if you want the cookies to be bigger you should make a double batch because they turned out a little small. But other than that I loved them a lot and it was super easy to make!! I also suggest you put some regular sugar in the mixture of cinnamon and powdered sugar, it makes it textured better and taste a little better!

These cookies are truly luscious!  I doubled the recipe and mixed them in my KitchenAide.  Easy.  I didn't add extra cinnamon to the cookie dough and I "eye-balled" the cinnamon/sugar rolling mixture, dumping in what looked like the right amt. of cinnamon.  I did roll them again in the cin/sugar as soon as them came out of the oven.  I used a one Tablespoon scoop and baked them at 350 in my convection oven for 15 minutes.  Oh, I put half the dough in the freezer while I scooped out the first batch.  Not a good idea!  The dough congealed very quickly and I had to let it soften a bit in order to scoop it again.  No harm done, however!  I really had no problem with "soft" dough.  Make these!

These were very good. I might have done something differently; I rolled the cookies in the confectioner's sugar/cinnamon after they were cooked. I don't know, it just sounded weird to do it before baking and I wasn't in the mood to risk it. Also, I subbed some butter for lard because the original recipe uses only lard; they came out very tender, slightly crumbly, as they should. The dough is very crumbly and needs to be smoshed together to form the cookie, but they keep their shape just fine while baking and afterwards too.  I rolled only half of them in the conf. sugar/cinnamon and I think I liked the ones without much better.  I also only got 20 small cookies from the batch and would have liked maybe 1/2 a batch more (husband and I have a mega sweet tooth) . If you have pecans, that would be sooo delicious to add! But that's not traditional. Like another reviewer said, the traditional thing in Spain is to  dab the top of the cookies in sesame seeds and then bake . And lard. They're called mantecadas here in Spain(manteca=lard) ! Definitely will make again :)

I have not had an authentic polvorones de canele, but I did not really care for this. The cookie is very dry and fragile. I made them for my son's Spanish class and was afraid to send them to school.  The taste was fine.

Easy recipe. I made this for my son's Spanish class.this will be a hit there I'm sure.  I'd made these again. I have quite a bit of the powder sugar & cinnamon mixture left that I rolled the balls in. I'd double the cinnamon and lessen the powdered sugars. I'll keep the mixture and make again in a day.

The dough is crumbly so be careful when forming it into balls. I doubled the cinnamon for the batter and the coating. I only needed less than half a cup of confectioners sugar to coat them. Following the 24 serving recipe amount, I yielded 18 cookies.
They were a hit at a ladies' potluck! Everyone still talks about them and asks me to make them again! They do melt in your mouth!

This was a hit with a Mexican themed party! The only change I made was to use cinnamon extract instead of vanilla. I read the other reviews and many suggested more cinnamon. The extract provided just what I needed.

Although the recipe makes less cookies than it says, it was still great! The cookie had a crispy cinnamon outside and a soft inside. They were the best cookies I have ever made. I made them for my class and they all love them! Will be making these again.

OMG! I am so happy to have happened upon this delightful recipe. Have made & shared them several times and people just love them! These cookies are easily & quickly made, are lighter than air and just sweet enough, and what I love most of all about this recipe is that it is very easily made VEGAN!

These cookies were really good! I tripled the recipe for the dough, but only used a single recipe for the cinnamon-sugar mixture, and I still had a lot left over. I used a lot more cinnamon in the dough than the recipe called for, about 2.5x as much. My cookies were done after 11 minutes. They melt in your mouth. I would make them again.

I made these delicious cookies for Cinco de Mayo celebration for my son's Spanish class.  My first thought was to make Mexican Wedding cookies but the teacher had requested food with no nuts.  These cookies were very similar just cinnamon instead of nuts!  These cookies were delicious and easy to make since all the ingredients are things you already have on hand.  After reading reviews, I also added extra cinnamon to the recipe,  instead of 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, I used 1 teaspoon.  They were delicious!

I made a few changes AFTER I made the recipe as directed. The recipe is perfect as is, and the changes I made are for personal preferences only. Here is as I made: oven 350, 1 cup butter + 1/2 cup sifted powdered sugar, cream together. Next add 1 tsp vanilla, 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp finely grained salt NOT Kosher, as it does not melt well. Finally 1 + 1/2 cup sifted cake flour + another 3 TPS of sifted cake flour. Mix in a separate bowel 1 cup non sifted powdered sugar + 2 tsp cinnamon. Flour counter with some of the powder sugar/cinnamon mix. Roll dough out, using however much powder sugar/cinnamon mix to roll out the dough. Cut with round cookie cutter no more than three inches. Redip cookies into powder sugar/cinnamon mix to recoat the cut cookies on both sides. Place on lined cookie sheet. 15 minutes is usually enough, however oven times vary.

I followed the recipe exact and the mix was too soft to roll.  I added more flour and it was better.  They baked nicely, however  when the cookie cooled they were  bit hard and it was bland.  I was not very impressed.   I will not make these again.

Taste's just like Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal the way I made it. Here's what I did:
- Add 1 egg (for 2 dozen cookies)
- Use granulated sugar to roll it in 
- Added a LOT more cinnamon than the recipe called for (enough to strongly smell it for both the dough and the sugar)
- Finally, I cut the butter in half, so instead of using 2 sticks of butter for 24 cookies, I used one. I did this because it seemed like a lot of butter for that amount of cookies.

I really did enjoy this recipe! It helped me with an outside activity that I had to do for my Spanish course. When I was making the recipe everything worked out like it was supposed to but I was left with quite a bit of sugar and cinnamon.That's ok though because that can be saved to make this recipe again. The only trouble I had was they did burn a little bit so I would probably make them for 10-12 min. Overall they were great and my dad at most of them. :)

Use real butter - A student made these for her history class and let me try them. I thought they were delicious so I am making them for the first time today. My dough did not get stiff enough for rolling in balls. I think this may be due to the fact that I used margarine (Parkay stick))instead of real butter. I have done everything else as instructed in the recipe. The dough is in the refrigerator now hoping to "stiffen" it up.

Not sweet like my favorite cookies and a bit sour even. Perhaps I am just not a fan of Mexican cookies.  Definitely cannot say I will make them again.

Easy to make and ends up with good texture but the flavor somehow lacks a punch... I may have to tweak the cinnamon portions to make it tastier.

My daughter had to prepare a Spanish recipe for an end of year project and these cookies were a hit.  We did cut down on the powdered sugar as was suggested in some of the other reviews but other than that we made them as the recipe was written.  They were delicious and were a hit with her class.  Her Spanish teacher even asked her to bring in additional copies of the recipe because all of the recipe cards she had brought in had been taken by students so they could make them at home.  Thank you for posting this recipe.

very good, not-too sweet, little cookie. definitely agree with other reviewers in that you do not need 1 cup confectioners' sugar for the topping- i probably used half that amount and still had a lot left over. also doesn't quite make 24 cookies but they are very good. has the flavor of a horchata or a churro w/o being overly sweet. made these on a night we had mexican food and they were perfect!

Were sooo good! The only thing i did was add about 2-3 tbsp of granulated suger and a bit more cinnamon....so delicious! My mom said that the only prblem with them was they are so small, so it is easy to convince yourself to have about six!

I can't wait to have these with coffee tomorrow morning! I needed to add about 1/4-1/2 cup more flour to the dough (and even then the dough was still very sticky and soft), but the cookies turned out great! Tastes like pie crust infused with cinnamon. Very crumbly, too, but I think that's how they're supposed to be (or that's how they are straight out of the oven - I couldn't wait to try them!).

I brought these in to work for Cinco de Mayo.  One of my coworkers, who *never* gives out compliments, said three in a row and then asked me if I'd make some more!  These were easy to make and didn't require any special ingredients.  I agree with an earlier comment that their taste improves when they cool.  Another one of my coworkers, who originates from Mexico, couldn't help but correct the title though... according to him, it should be "canela".  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Like a cinnamon shortbread.  I doubled the cinnamon as someone suggested and I think I'd go with the recipe as written.  I'll have to try it that way first though before I decide!

I rated this four stars after making it but a year later they are still the cookie I remember most from last Christmas so I'm upping it to a five.

Amazing! Melt in your mouth for sure. I totally agree with a previous comment that they taste better after cooling. Also, I "whipped" them up in way under an hour. I only cooked for 15 mins. and they were perfect. Also I substituted almond extract instead of vanilla...because I love it, and they turned out great. Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper.

These were great and super easy to make!  I work in an after school program and thought this would be an easy, quick recipe for my kids to make.  They really enjoyed making them and enjoyed eating them even more.  I snagged one before they were gone and they were very tasty, not overly sweet at all.  The only thing is we had a lot of extra sugar / cinnamon mix left over after we dipped all of our cookies, I think halfing it would work best.

These were just ok to me.  They needed a lot more cinnamon flavor and the texture was strange.  Another user stated it best-like sand crumbling and melting on your tongue.  If you are looking for a savory, chewy cookie then keep looking.

this was fantastic i loved the buttery flavor and sweet taste.I had a little to much powder sugar mixture, but that was okay because I'll save it for the next time i make it. also add a little more flour and refrigerate for a little time so that it didn't melt when i formed the balls.

I love these so much. I put them in my Christmas goodie bag for all my friends last year and they all loved them too. I don't change a thing and they always come out great. These get made whenever I need something sweet to share with people, which is fairly often.

I made these for work and everyone said they were fantastic and melt in your mouth. It's weird to think a cookie could melt in your mouth but it's true. They do. I made one batch and the housemates and I ate them all, so I made a double batch and they were a bit different (odd that doubling would change anything) but still good. The only reason I'm not giving them a 5 is because they're not something I would want all the time, but they are delicious!

Very yummy!  The cookies were light, sweet and melt-in-your-mouth good.  I made these for my cub scout den for Cinco de Mayo.  They gobbled them up.  I did double the recipe, but left the sugar/cinnamon topping ingredients as is.  There was plenty for the double recipe.  I will definitely make these again.

These were easy to make.  I like cinnamon, so I'd add more to the recipe.  The recipe didn't make that much so I'd also double it.

I brought these to work last week and although I did not care too much for them, they were a hit. Just not sweet enough for me.I may try again with the advice of using regular sugar.

Delish!  I used 1/2 c margarine and 1/2 c shortening because that's all I had, and it worked fine.  Not too sweet, crisp, tender and melted in your mouth.  I got 25 cookies, and I should've doubled this.  They were gone too fast!  And let them cool before eating.  These taste best at room temp.

Really good cookies!..  I quadrupled the recipe because I needed lots of cookies!  I doubled the cinnamon in the dough and probably made them about 1 1/2 inch balls, baking them for 15 minutes.  The amounts given for the sugar and cinnamon at the end was enough for all my cookies; they obviously suggest way too much!  Besides that I was hoping they'd turn out good because I volunteered to bring something in the Mexican theme for our church's "Feed the Homeless" night.  Everyone loved them!  They are easy to make too.  Easier than snickerdoodles which we love and they taste similiar.  The powder sugar gives them an interesting melting texture.  I will definately make them again!

Made this recipe for a dinner with my parents and the cookies were a hit. Even my mother who generally avoids sweets was inhaling them. :D

Great recipe! Instead of 1 cup of butter I used 3/4s of a cup, and 1/4 cup of margarine because I ran out of butter. Turned out fine anyway. I also added granulated sugar to the "topping" mix which gave the cookies a more textured, sugar crusted exterior!

These cookies were so easy and quick to make. I made them at the last minute to take to my daughter's preschool class for a Mexican theme lunch they were having the next day. The kids loved them! Since the recipe is so easy my 4-year-old was able to help me. Would make these again for sure!

Really tasty and powdery. Mine spread out a lot both times I made them (following the recipe to a T). The second time, I had even refrigerated the dough before baking. Still, they tasted great.

Needs quite a bit more flour than the recipe calls for & again, halve the cinnamon-sugar mixture for the crust. But all in all, a very enjoyable cookie, particularly for Christmas!

I made these for an "End of the Year Spanish Party" and a bunch of people kept asking me for seconds! I would definitely add more butter as needed because the flour doesn't come together as well. Otherwise, print out some copies of the recipe because people will be asking for them!

I made these for a Christmas get-together and everyone loved them! I was surprised at how quick and easy the recipe was and how delicious they taste! Next time I will half the amount of cinnamon-sugar mix that I rolled them in b/c there was a lot left! I will definitely make this again and recommend it to my friends.

I changed this recipe quite a bit, but the girls at work and I still enjoyed them. Instead of butter (since I was completely out of it) I subbed cream cheese. I did have to quite quite a bit more flour like everyone else did, but they still came out quite tasty. I upped the cinnamon as I love cinnamon, and they still weren't overly spice flavored. These are just unassuming, yummy little snack cookies.

Pretty much a flop. I took them to an international dinner that my school was having, and they were just okay. Didn't get any great comments on them. They taste alright, nothing awful, but I definitely won't make them again.

WOW! i cant believe what a hit these cookies were!! I have a feeling i will be making them for every occasion for the next little while. I found that there was a little more of the cinnimon sugar dipping mixture left over i will probably use half as much next time.

These are really good. They're basically a shortbread cinnamon cookie. They won't last long at my house. :-)Thanks Cathy.

They were not what I accpected them to be, but they were still really good!! they don't exactly look like the picture however. They were also light and airy. I partially melted the butter, which led to the dough not being stiff, but they tasted even better this way!

They had a really nice taste, but definitely too much flour! If I had left the recipe like it was they would have had a very crumbly dough, but I added some water to them, and the dough was fine. The cookies turned out great too.

I made these cookies for my daughter's fourth grade class for Mexican day, the cookies were a hit.  They had a shortbread flavor to them and the cinnamon really made the cookie.

Tomorrow is Cinco de Mayo and my daughter needs to bring something in to school for her Spanish class.  Of course, I checked out "All Recipes" for some ideas.  These cookies were easy to make and are delicious.  I doubled everything in the recipe except for the cinnamon mixture that you roll the cookie dough in.  Everyone in the family wished I made more!

Any time I make a dessert of some kind, I test it on my four year old.  He absolutely loves desserts and always gives me his honest opinion.  He loved this cookies.  I melted some chocolate chips and spread them on top to add more flavor.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as is and they were great!

These cookies were pretty dry, but were still ok.  The taste was alright, but there was too much salt.  Sorry, I dont think i'll make these again.

Although the batter seemed too buttery at first they turned out great! They tasted a lot like lady fingers, as recipe we used to make with left over cookie dough from roll-out cookies.  Yum Yum!
