The dressing turned out to be too sour for me, so I added 1 teaspoon of honey to the mixture. In addition, I added sliced of cucumbers and cherry tomatoes, and used Dole's Spring Mix instead of watercress. It was delicious.

I'm rating this on the vinaigrette more so than the salad because the salad as written is quite simple.  I made the dressing a day ahead of time to let the flavors meld.  It is quite pungent with the red onions, dijon mustard, capers, lemon juice, and rice wine vinegar.  But those strong flavors complement the simple salad perfectly!  In addition to the lettuce and smoked salmon, I threw in pinenuts, grape tomatoes cut in half, and one avocado cubed.  The creamy avocado and fresh smoked salmon were fabulous together.  This is truly a salad fit for a meal!

I added slices of red potato to the salad and served an entire filet of salmon on top of each persons salad. Very elegant and so delicious!

This was really good. I left out the capers, as my husband and I don't like them, and added a tablespoon of honey- and mixed the dressing in my food processor. It was nice and simple but packed with flavor. A great, cool summer meal. Will make again as soon as my hubby smokes some more salmon!

I had a lot of watercress and found this.  I mixed the watercress 50/50 with spring mix.  I'm watching calories so I also cut the olive oil back to a few tablespoons and added an equal amount of water.  I read the comments about adding something sweet so used Honey Dijon mustard.  But the lemon/vinegar goes very well with the peppery bite of the watercress.  Have most of a smoked filet flaked in a bag and with the dressing pre made this will be a super quick salad to whip up the next few days.  

I smoke salmon pretty frequently and this will be a regular rotation for the cold leftovers.  Thanks.

I used mixed field greens and smoked salmon from Costco. Overall this is a delicious salad except that the dressing is too sour.  I halved the recipe and served it as a meal for my husband and I.  We both agreed that it's a delicious and healthy meal but if I make it again, I'll probably halve the amount of lemon juice and vinegar next time.

This was very good. I had never eaten watercress before and was disappointed with the taste. However, once it is combined with the salmon and dressing, it tastes great! I will make this again.

I have to admit I didn't have the watercress but the rest of it was spot on.  I served this at the family Christmas party and it was the hit of the affair.

This recipe is so great.  My husband had a lot of left over smoked salmon and we were searching for a recipe to use it in.  We loved it.  Spinach and spring greens can be substituted for watercress and we highly recommend throwing in some sweet peppers and avocados.  This is definitely going into the recipe box.

This was a great salad. I used arugula instead of watercress. Also added some garden tomatoes that added a nice touch. Will make it again!
