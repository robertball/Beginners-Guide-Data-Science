My family really enjoyed these. I thought they were good but could have used a little stronger flavor. They were pretty simple to make.

This is an easy and good recipe. I also took the leftovers and browned them in a bit of olive oil the next night for supper! The recipe is very good if you watch calories!

Nothing great - very easy to make... but they just lacked flavor overall.

I thought this was pretty nice the way it was presented if you're not happy with it there's always "tweaking"..... some have no imagination & don't belong in a kitchen. kudos to Kitzer tweaking is trial & error

These looked horrible but the taste was cook. I used beef and chicken stock since I had half a can of each hanging out in the fridge. With some added salt and Italian seasoning these were really yummy

Sorry I really wanted to like this because it reminds me of Potatoes Boulangere and this seemed as if it would be an easier way to make them but this recipe is really bland. I read the other reviews that stated this so decided to use chicken stock instead. Unfortunately it didn't make much difference. Potatoes soak up salt and this I feel was lacking in this recipe. Also some butter at the end would have really helped to make this dish richer. Sorry but I won't be making this one again.

Great recipe and I omitted the cornstarch because I m in the habit of mashing 2-3 pieces of potatoes to create the creamy texture in its dressing. I used yukon waxy potatoes and a tiny cooked russet for the sauce-dressing replacement of corn starch.
