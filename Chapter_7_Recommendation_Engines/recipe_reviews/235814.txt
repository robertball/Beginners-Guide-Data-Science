Brought it to my in-laws for Thanksgiving.  Was a hit.  
Healthy, tasty, and easy!  No dressing needed at all. 
Tip#1: To make peeling/cutting the butternut squash easier, poke holes in surface of the squash with a fork a few times, then microwave for 3 to 4 minutes.   Let cool.  Peel, cut and roast as directed. 
Tip#2: Can be made ahead - Roasted the butternut squash and onions the night before, then refrigerated.  Just before serving the next day, I microwaved the squash/onions for a few minutes and mixed them with the spinach/nuts/cranberries.  Tasted good the following day too!

Very good! I had some leftover butternut squash, so they weren't exactly the size specified, so they cooked a bit faster, but that was fine. I also added a bit of garlic powder, salt and pepper, and those were great additions. I didn't have any pecans this time, but I can't wait to try this w/ them added. Sweet, tart and savory...a great combination! Thanks for sharing. :)

Just saw this today, I've been making this recipe for months after having it at a local deli vegetarian bar.  I love it! Thanks for putting the recipe out there....

Looking for ways to use squash recently, I came across this recipe once again. I served it for the first time last holiday season with prime rib and a wild rice side, and the meal earned high marks. I added extra spinach, a favorite food of my family, and seasoned lightly with salt and pepper. It was an easily prepared, quick cooking, beautiful side dish. Always weight watching, this is a great light addition to any meal, and most importantly, it is delicious.

Tried it for the first time last night when my daughter and her boyfriend came for dinner...we all loved it and will make it again.  I did like it with the red onion, but used toasted pine nuts instead of pecans...great flavor.

I don't know what I did wrong, but this did not come out that great. I followed the recipe and everything. Not making this again.

I peeled the squash with a potato peeler first and cut into cubes; a lot easier I think.  Recipe was good and I'm always looking for recipes to fix butternut squash as they grow abundantly in my garden and I usually have them all winter long.  This recipe is really healthy with just a dressing of olive oil and then I added a little salt and pepper.  Thanks Marcia.

Really good, the only problem I had was the onions were done way before the squash, despite cutting them larger based on the reviews.  Next time I'll saute' the onions separately.  Good with a little balsamic vinagarette

Like KTOLAND, I first discovered this dish at Wegmans.  When I sampled they were using it to promote their herbed olive oil.  Didn't buy their oil, I make my own by crushing some dried thyme, rosemary and marjoram and mixing them into my oil.  I also swap walnuts for the pecans because I always have them in the house, and have often omitted the onion due to oversight.  Doesn't matter, this is a fabulous dish and very forgiving.  I like the one reviewers suggestion to try arugula, and can't wait to try it.

Fantastic! Wegman's sells this in the prepared food section and I just had to find the recipe, and this is the exact recipe.  One of my favorite sides.

Fabulous.  Only thing I did different was add cranberries at roasting time.  It was an accident, but really great dish.  I will always add cranberries to baking time.

I am new to cooking and tried this for the first time last night with pecans. It was delicious!! The only downside was that it took me a good while to get the squash peeled, gutted, and cubed. It was totally worth it, though, and I will be making it again!

Just made this tonight in prep for tomorrow. Wow! Delicious!  I had to use a yellow onion because I must have used my purple one ??. Still tastes great, but the purple probably would have made it that much prettier. I did add the optional pecans, and recommend that you do-very nice added texture and flavor!

The most eye appealing dish we had at Thanksgiving!  Instead of regular pecans, I added in maple-candied pecans for a little extra taste and crunch - yum!  At hit with everyone at the table.  Thank you!

The only change I made was to toast the pecans before tossing them in. Great recipe, was a hit at the Thanksgiving table!

I really liked this recipe.  I used shallots, dried cherries and toasted pine nuts in place of the red onions, craisins and nuts, respectively.  The squash took longer to roast as stated, but it turned out great.  I will make it again for sure.

This is a keeper.  I served this at Thanksgiving and it was delicious.  I roasted the squash and onion ahead of time and reheated it in the oven before tossing and serving with the other ingredients.  My guests asked for the recipe as well.

This is the perfect combination of ingredients. I think there might be a seasoning other than salt that would make this even more delicious, but I've yet to figure it out. Just as a side note, I happened to have plain quinoa on my plate the night I made this, so I mixed. Another yummy side dish!

Didn't try it yet but will soon because it can't miss!  I love roasted vegetables.  I will leave out the red onion, though.  I don't understand the over use of red onion…in almost every restaurant salad and many side dishes.  It makes me burp and wreaks havoc on my breath!

This recipe is fantastic!  Healthy, fresh and full of flavor.  I read the reviews and followed the recommendation of microwaving before roasting to help with the peeling (great suggestion!), I will also cube a bit smaller than 1 inch square pieces which will likely result in a bit less roasting time and I added just a bit of raspberry vinaigrette dressing.  It was delicious and will definitely make it again soon!  Enjoy!

Because this dish is so healthy I rated a 4star. But I had a hard time peeling the squash. Took more time than I wanted to mess with. The taste was ok to me. I used walnuts didnt have pecans.

Loved the flavor combo. As suggested, I did season the butternut squash, lightly sauteed onions instead of roasting with squash. I will be making it again

We made this according to the recipe. It came out quite well! The flavors are very nice. One item we would suggest: we used fresh spinach. But the spinach was a little old at the store. We used a very light vinaigrette dressing (2tablespoons) on the spinach  and it made it delicious! I think fresh or young, spinach leaves would not need any dressing. My picky family liked it mucho!

Excellent salad.....made it for Xmas dinner and it was well received by everyone.  Hint:  it does need a dressing, would recommend finding a good pomegranate or raspberry vinaigrette to lightly toss with it.

Seems like it needs some sort of very light dressing — just to add a little moisture.

I made this for a company Christmas lunch. Most everyone loved it. It does do well without a dressing. But, I think it would be perfect if I knew of a dressing that would complement it.

This was a nice "something different" for Thanksgiving. Everyone loved it. It'll be a new normal for us.

I thought it was great and my company loved it as well.  Leftovers the next day were awesome.

I would love to know how everyone else’s red onions didn’t burn besides just a few of us.  I used plenty of olive oil but the onions were completely charred in just over 15 minutes. The taste was bland too, but seasoning helped. I liked the healthy factor and with some changes, this would be better, but as written, it’s not great.

This was easy and delicious! Used lettuce instead of spinach and the warm slightly oily butternut gave the leaves a lovely flavour. I am sure spinach will be even more flavoursome. There was no need for dressing as it was just yummy like that. Also sprinkled feta cheese on top. Will definitely make this again

My guests enjoyed this salad. I purchased pre-cut squash for convenience.  Rated it 4 stars because I believe the addition of a blend of salt/pepper/garlic and onion powder while roasted the veggies enhanced the flavor.  You really don't need added dressing for this salad. The olive oil is enough.

The red onions were burnt in the oven at 450 degrees and for so long.  The flavor was very plain.  I had to add dressing or maple syrup to give any kick.  It was just okay for me.

This will certainly become a family favorite.  Made it the other night and my husband raved about it.  Great flavors that compliment each other.  Plan to make it again next week and will try toasted pine nuts in place of the pecans.
