As written, this recipe is quite bland, but with a few easy adjustments, it became an AMAZING side dish that got (muffled, from a full mouth)incredibly good feedback from the boyfriend.  I used 1/2 2% milk and 1/2 cream, but almost a 1/3 cup of grated asiago, and it was perfect and creamy.  Also, skipped the butter and just threw the garlic and onion in at the beginning of rendering the bacon.  I left out the chicken, as that was my main dish, but cut the bacon into larger chunks and it was great!  Also doubled the garlic amount, and added salt, pepper, cayenne, and red pepper flakes to liven it up a bit.  At the end of sauteing the veggies i threw in about 8 oz sliced fresh mushrooms, and it was phenomonal!!  Tossed the cooked pasta with fresh chopped parsley, olive oil, pepper, and a little parmasan and served with Mushroom and Swiss Chicken (see review)...I thought my boy was gonna fall to his knees and start to sob from sheer appreciation!

This is a fabulous recipe, especially if you follow some of the other suggestions in the reviews. Definitely use the 1 cup of asiago cheese for the real flavor of the cheese. I also substituted 2% milk for one of the two first cups of cream. I could have done without the sundried tomatoes. I realized too late that they should have gone in first thing so they could soften up and provide the flavor they were supposed to. I also used about 1/4 cup of chives in place of the green onion for color and for a less pungent onion flavor, the red onion provides plenty of that. A fabulous recipe, well worth the effort! Enjoy!

Made a few minor changes and thoroughly enjoyed this dish. Changes:
Did not use bacon Used half milk, half cream Used olive oil for veggies, added a bit of butter for taste Doubled garlic 
Used 3/4 c asiago 
Added 1/4 cup chardonnay with initial cream and tomatoes
Soaked sun-dried tomatoes ahead of time and simmered sauce after tomatoes went in on really low heat for about 15 minutes. Had to add a bit more milk.

I think simmering the sauce with the soaked tomatoes really helped their flavor dispense.

I didn't have asaigo cheese, so I used parmesan. I also traded out the heavy whipped cream with milk and butter (1 cup heavy cream = 3/4 milk + 1/3 cup butter) to lighten it. This is a wonderful recipe! Very delicious! Thanks Michelle! My family loved it!

Wow, delicious! In reference to previous reviews that complained of the tomatoes being too dry, I would recommend either buying the sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil, or re-hydrating the dry kind by immersing them in a little olive oil and water and microwaving for 30-40 seconds. Drain them, and add them at the same time as the asiago and bouillon. I only made a few slight modifications. The heavy cream is really not necessary, I used 2% for the first part, and 10% for the second and the sauce came out plenty rich! Also, if you're a garlic fan, double what the recipe recommends. I used about 1/3 of a cup of Asiago, as someone had recommended, but found it a bit too salty. I will use a little less next time, or omit the bacon. Great dish!

G-O-U-R-M-E-T!!!  This was delicious!  I could have drank the asiago cream sauce by the glass for starters. I made a few changes & it was perfect.  I'll be making this for company soon.  

I added basil, freshly ground pepper & extra cheese to the sauce.  I used much less than 1 cup of sun-dried tomatoes.  I wasn't sure if I liked them or not so didn't want a bunch.  I probably used 1/3 cup & it was perfect.  I also omitted the red onion since I don't like cooked red onions and used 8 ozs of fresh mushrooms sliced instead.  YUM!  The last cup of heavy cream I switched to 1 cup 1% milk.  

I never need to eat out again.  This is better than anything at Olive Garden--seriously!  Everyone at my house loved this!

This is my absolute favorite meal EVER!!! I would give it 10 stars if I could. I did make a few changes though. First, you must add more cheese, I use about a cup. Second, I use chicken tenders and marinate them in Italian dressing (at least) overnight. Finally, I skip the green onion. I love green onion, but found them to be quite overpowering in this dish. I have made this numerous times and have even taken it to a pot luck dinner. I left with an empty dish and everyone left with the recipe! Thanks for posting!

This recipe was great, just like something you'd get at a resturaunt!  I took the advice of increasing the cheese (I used about 3/4 cup) and I decreased the onion (boyfriend is not too fond of them, I used 1/2 cup each of green and red and still was a bit much).  I would half the recipe if not making it for a group of people next time.  Since there is only two of us we had lots of leftovers, which wouldn't usually be a problem since we try to take leftovers for lunch the next day.  When reheating, the sauce breaks and becomes very greasy!  Otherwise, it was great and will make again.

DELICIOUS! I didn't want this to be too dense so I used half and half in place of the heavy cream and increased the Asiago to 3/4 c. I followed another reviewers suggestion to add the sundried tomotoes from the start to allow them to soften up, so glad I did. Other than that, I didn't have a red onion on hand so I used shallots and sauted that in 2 tblsp of olive oil rather than butter. I also threw in about 1/2 c. of pine nuts w/ the garlic and shallots, omitted green onions and used 1/4 c. chopped fresh basil. I used Penne pasta and toppped w/ parsley and feta cheese. My new favorite dish! Thank you so much Michelle, for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

My 3 and 6 year olds loved it!  It was full of flavor and great with salad.  I softened the sundried tomatoes by boiling them for about 5min. before I added them to the cream sauce.  I love garlic, so I added a little more than called for and eased up on the onion.  I also omitted the bacon and used about 1 cup of cheese.  This dish is definfelty a keeper.  Right up there with restaurant dishes.

This is great as is....no changes.                                                  Frankly I think for someone to change any recipe to their liking ......keep it to yourself or you post a new version. To sweet... to salty......to rich...... change this or that, I think it is insulting to the person who created it. My opinion.

I have made this recipe exactly as stated. It is rich, creamy, amazing goodness. Don't worry about fat or calories, it is a wonderful indulgence at least the first time. I'll try to make it with the suggested variations, but as is it is a wonderful recipe. I served it with Asiago garlic bread last night, accompanied by a nice salad and a perfectly chilled chardonnay. Try it, you won't be sorry! This is a new family favorite.

This recipe didn't tell you when to add the sun-dried tomatoes and I though it was a little to much onion.  Not one of my families favorites, especially considering all the work that went into making it.

5 stars for this one- -if you're into Heart Smart foods, this one is not for you. But, if you want to serve up a deeply satisfying meal that even your kids will just love, here it is. Because you’re cooking with cream, do all the prep prior to starting. Just have it all laid out before you start, so you can move right along. I found the recommended amount of Asiago cheese so small I just couldn’t take it seriously. So I had a good time adding shredded cheese—probably about a ½ cup. Frankly, it probably didn’t much matter. The flavor here is really about the mix of the Sun Dried Tomatoes and the cream. I made no substitutions other than Parmesan (because I had it) for the Asiago…and it worked beautifully. Grilling the chicken is a very nice touch, by the way. The sun-dried tomatoes we used were packed in oil—the oil deepens the flavor, too (I know, I know…there isn’t enough FAT in this recipe as it is?). My wife and I ate it as is, for my son I added some thin ribbon pasta to put it on—he’s 13, and it was inhaled. Notice the little touches that you might want to substitute around, like say, yellow onions, instead of red, or maybe skip the green onions? Honestly, you can, but, this is an extremely well thought out recipe, my strong recommendation is that you go with it right down the line. I will next time, right down to the Asiago in the one-tablespoon amount. Honestly, this one is that good.

Super, fantastic and mouthwatering!  I made it like the recipe said (without the bacon) first then made it again with my adjustments (again without the bacon).  I used 1 cup skim milk and 1 cup heavy cream to lighten it a bit... I added the sundried tomatoes right away to milk/cream mixture and brought to a low boil.  I upped the asiago cheese to 1 1/2 cups.  I omitted the butter and sauteed one pound of sliced mushrooms with the onions and three times the amount of garlic, adding 1 tsp of cayenne pepper and 2 tsp of black pepper.  I added 1/2 cup of fresh chopped parsley... Then last but not least -- I didn't have bowtie pasta the second time I made this, so I used three cheese tortallini and it was MORE than a hit.  Some people even suggested it was better than a few of the Italian restaurants!  I will be making this a third time without the chicken for a few of my vegetarian friends.  Overall -- this recipe is fantastic -- I really loved it -- thank you for providing it!

This was a hit!  I used sun dried julienne tomatoes.  I also tried to cut down on the fat by substituting half of the cream it called for with 2% milk.  It turned out great!  My cousins asked for the recipe.

Based on the other reviews, I was expecting this "one of a kind" fantastic dish.  It was good.  But not worth all the calories or the amount of time spent to prepare it or the expense.  It was missing something...not sure what.  I was pretty disappointed.

I used half and half as well as a milk and butter combination (I doubled the recipe), used 1 cup tomatoes and increased the cheese to 2/3 cup.  I used one pkg of bacon and fried it along with a whole white sweet onion and doubled up on the garlic.  I also added 8 oz sliced portabella mushrooms in with the chicken but could've added it in sooner to cook the mushrooms down more.  It was fantastic!

My boyfriend and I LOVE this recipe, and have made it several times now!  You say that it is certainly not low fat, but I actually use skim milk instead of cream and I think it is super delicious!!  With the bacon, sun dried tomatoes, garlic, and onions, I don't miss any flavor using skim milk.  In fact, it is still creamy and delicious!  We do use more milk than called for: 4 cups instead of 2 in the first part of the recipe, and then the 1 cup in the second part.  So 5 cups of skim milk total.  It really makes the sauce much creamier.  We also use more garlic.  Thanks!

I have made this recipe several times and each time my friends loved it & have asked me for the recipe. Best to make for a large group who won't mind pitching in on the prep! Some changes: I used sun dried tomatoes preserved in oil and blotted with paper towels-saved some chopping time. I used 2% milk instead of 1 of the cups of cream, could even substitute more milk. I put in lots more cheese each time--about a cup is what I have settled on as the right balance. If you are looking forward to making something impressive, this is a great recipe, despite the long prep time.

This recipe has a ton of potential ... it didn't tell you when to put in the sun-dried tomatoes, and didn't realize until into the process, so I used reasoning that they went into the cream sause.  There was too much onion and not enough cheese for my liking, I would make it again and ajust.

This recipe got great reviews at a recent family party.
I did make a few changes: 1c. 1/2 and 1/2; 1c. Skim Milk; 1/2c. shredded Asiago Cheese; 1c. chopped sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil w/herbs; omit butter; saute red onion in bacon renderings; 1c. chopped chives; 1c. skim milk.  Will definitely make again!

This was very good. It could use a little more seasoning as was slightly plain. I loved the sun dried tomatoes in it.

It has a great taste, but while my tongue was happy but my tummy was queezy after eating it. Maybe it was the fat, not sure, I don't normally have that problem with cream dishes. I made as it was but added a little more asiago and kept the sun dried tomatoes in with the onions, chicken, etc. I noticed the flavor of the sauce from just adding cream to that was really good, so I think I will try it again with just adding a little more cream to that part and skip the asiago cream sauce part. Maybe just add some sprinkles of crumbled asiago to the top.

Definitely restaurant quality. I, like many others, substituted milk for the last cup of cream. I would use even less cream/more milk next time, as it was plenty rich. I liked all the onion (it was very mild) and, unsure about using bacon, just used a couple Tbsp. of real bacon bits from a bag. The flavor blend was incredible. More cheese in the sauce as well (3/4 cup). TIP: be sure you have sweet-tasting tomatoes. My dried ones were a cheap brand and a bit bitter, but my oil-packed ones were sweet and added a lot of flavor. Last, I liked the chicken thinly sliced, and the addition of cayenne--- OVER THE TOP!!! Thanks Michelle!

Great recipe!  I modified a little: didn't have Asagio cheese so substituted with 1/2C Parmesean.  Didn't know where to put the butter in so left it out.  Also used 2C heavy cream for first part but 2% milk for the second part and thickened with cornstarch.  For shortcut with chicken, didn't grill ahead of time -- just sauteed it with the bacon, onion, and garlic and it came out great!  Would definitely make again.

Great recipe!  This has a lot of good flavors in it and was delicious.  I love sun dried tomatoes and had picked some up to make a pasta with them and I decided to try this.  The only thing is, I picked up the tomatoes in oil.  And I dont know if next time I need to sautee them first or what because they was really soggy and had an oily flavor.  Im used to the yummy sweet kind.  So maybe Ill just try a different brand.  Thanks for the recipe! *UPDATE* I made this again and it was extremely better this time.  I purchased the dry packed sun dried tomatoes and it made such a better difference!  I wont be buying those oily ones again!  This recipe is almost exactly like a dish at The Cheesecake Factory.  So much cheaper to make it yourself! Excellent!

This is so yummy that I throw caution to the wind and ignore the fact that it is definitely not the most healthy of dishes.  It is DEEEELICIOUS.  It is a rich dish with several flavours that complement each other nicely.  Across the board, this recipe gets rave reviews when I make it.  I wouldn't change a thing and happily recommend it to others.  I'm drooling just thinking about it right now... :)

I really enjoyed this receipe.  I read through the other suggestions from other subscribers and incorporated a few plus add a few of my own.  I used penne pasta, my personal preference.  I used 1 cup of heavy whipping cream and 1 cup of half and half in the cream sauce.  Up the cloves of garlic from 2 to about 7, I love garlic.  Also upped the asiago cheese to 1 cup.  This was the only changes I made.  When I reheated the pasta as far as leftovers I tossed a little milk in the pasta and then microwaved.  Next time I think I will make another change.  I think I will use proscuitto in place of the bacon.  Thanks for a great receipe Michelle.

Fabulous! I left out the sun dried tomatoes, I don't care for them. I used milk in place of the 3rd cup of cream and only 1/2 cup butter(1 stick). I used sweet onions, more than a cup of Asiago cheese and about 2 tsp of prepared garlic plus several shakes of powdered garlic. I didn't grill my chicken, just simmered it in a little water till done. You could use leftover chicken in this recipe easily. Also, I used a package of pre-cooked bacon and it worked very well and cut down on the prep time. This dish is time consuming but it's worth it. The sauce is to die for, I added a couple jigs of Louisianna hot sauce and a couple shakes of red pepper flakes also. This added depth and flavor but wasn't noticeable and didn't make the sauce "hot". Also, I used dried parsley and put it directly in the sauce.

If the sauce looks dry after mixing in the bow tie pasta and other ingredients, I found adding a little milk worked to make it creamy again. Wonderful recipe!

This was really good.  I used half heavy cream, and half 2% milk per other recommendations and it turned out fine.  I also used more cheese, probably about 1/2 cup.  I think next time I will leave the bacon out, just because it kind of overpowered the other flavors.  Overall, we loved it.  Thanks for the great recipe!

very good -- I agree, more cheese, less green onion, substitute milk for some of the cream, and the bacon is unneccessary.

This is sooo rich, and it tastes soooo good. I loved making it; I rarely cook anything complex, and it was a blast doing all this chopping and mixing and sauteeing. I made a wonderful mess! It was weird how the instructions never tell you when to add the sun-dried tomatoes. I didn't realize this until the end, so I added them then. I think they were supposed to go in the cream sauce at the start, so they could soften a bit more.

WOW! So delicious and creamy! I did change a few things as per other reviews... also it was a little cold out to grill. This is what I did.  I sauteed diced chicken breast in butter, added the garlic and onions to that mixture, as well as some mushrooms. I substituted half and half cream for half of the heavy cream. I added a lot more garlic to the chicken mixture. I also added cayenne, chili flakes and a lot of salt and pepper. For the cheese sauce, I added 150 grams of asiago. The end result was DELICIOUS! I served it in a big huge pasta bowl (very Italian family style), and also served garlic bread and caesar salad. This is SUCH a keeper. Thanks!

This had great flavors, although I changed the recipe a little.  I used half and half instead of heavy cream, 1 cup of asiago cheese, 1 jar of sundered tomatoes in oil (which I cooked the diced chicken in) deleted the bacon and red onion, doubled the garlic and I threw some broccoli into the sauce while the pasta cooked.  I only used 2 tablespoons of butter to sauté the garlic and onion in.  It was delicious!

Something about bacon and heavy cream seemed so wrong, so I left out the bacon. Still, the recipe lacked flavor. Needed salt, among other things. The sun-dried tomatoes did not go with the cream sauce. Sorry, didn't like it.

This was delicious! My husband loved it too, I increased the Asiago a bit and seasoned with salt & pepper. Also replaced a bit of the cream with milk.  Definitely not low fat so make servings smaller, but great with a salad!!

My husband and I resisted the urge to tweak the recipe and the pasta turned out AMAZING! We did leave out the chicken though since we were having the pasta as a side with filet mignon.

Delicious dinner! Good cold for leftovers too!

This was so good! I made this for my church group and everyone loved it. I used 1 cup of Asiago cheese instead of a tbsp, added the sun-dried tomatoes to the cream in the beginning, cut out the bacon and added mushrooms. I will definitely make this again!

Pretty good, I used half and half in place of the heavy cream.   I also used about 1/3 c Asiago and 1/3 c parmesan.  I like a little more garlic flavor so next time would add a little more, otherwise a very good recipe.  Easy to make and like the fact that  I had all of the ingredients on hand.  Will definitely make again.

Awesome!  This was a delicious and easy recipe!  I used 2 cups half & half for the sauce and then added 1 cup 1% milk later on ... made the sauce in one saucepan and the pasta in another ... and left off the chicken to make it a lighter dish.  Delicious and I would love to make this again and again!  Hubby gave it 5 stars and the kids ate it too!

This is a really great sauce, tastes fancy and not a lot of fuss.  The sun dried tomatoes really set it off, so if you don't like these, I'd say skip the recipe.  I used a whole white onion and no green or red.  I also used mozerella instead of asagio because it's what I had on hand.  I put the tomatoes in to the sauce right away to help them soften, and I added a dash of crushed red tomatoes.  I used just a spoonful of bacon (the prepackaged crumbles.) We used wacky mac for the pasta.  It made about 8 cups with pasta included.  Yum.

Read the suggestions! They helped me immensely. It sounded good at first read but I knew it would need more cheese. I had some sun dried tomato concentrated paste I needed to get rid of so i mixed that in the sauce. Substituted Scallops and Shrimp for the Chicken. Also added a lot of asiago cheese and some salt and pepper. Used thin spaghetti and also added a tiny bit of rosemary and pine nuts. It was the BOMB! so awesome. I like my food strong and I think the key here is lots of Asiago.

Yummy, yummy, yummy! I've made this so many times now and I love it every time.  It is a recipe that takes  a little while to make, but worth it.  It's also very high fat, so we just make it for special occasions.  I've made it as is and with a couple of changes depending on what I had on hand and it's always been superb.  The only downside is that it doesn't reheat very well, because all that fat separates.  But that just means you gotta eat it all up the first time ;).

This was very decadent but delicious!  It would have been fabulous w/o my changes but in an attempt to make it a TAD healthier I changed the following: I made the cream sauce w/ half and half instead of heavy cream.  I also used parm instead of asaigio - personal preference. I used about 1/4 cup.  I did not use bacon or butter - I simply sauteed the onion and garlic in olive oil. I also used turkey sausage instead of chicken (It is what I had on hand).  I did not use the extra cream - I deglazed the pan with 1/2 cup white wine and 1/2 cup vegetable stock.  I also added a cup of peas.  It was delicious!  Thanks for the recipe idea!

I didn't like this much the first time I made it but that's because I added way too much cheese (1 cup). The second time I made it I only used half a cup and used prosciutto instead of bacon. One of my favorite dishes on this site.

WOW! Exceptional taste and colorful look to this stunning dish.  This is by far the best pasta dish I've ever tasted! The proportion for each ingredient is perfect with the exception of the Asiago cheese: I doubled the amount of this exceptional Italian cheese; I strongly recommend the additional amount.  Safe to say, the Asiago cheese mixture turned out fabulous.  The bacon / onion mixture is absolutely phenomenal!  I used crumbled bacon instead of bacon cooked in a skillet and I used rotini pasta instead of bow-tie pasta.  May I suggest the addition of red pepper cut in julienne style in the Asiago cheese mixture along with finely chopped fresh mushrooms in the bacon / onion mixture.  Whoever created this phenomenal pasta recipe is an absolute genius and deserves one heck of a trophy! I will definitely make this exceptional pasta dish again, especially for dinner parties.

One of the best pasta dishes that I have ever made!  I only made a few changes: omitted the chicken & bacon because we don't eat meat, added an extra clove of garlic, and used 1 cup of shredded Asiago instead of 1 tablespoon.  Also, I used sun-dried tomatoes that were packed in oil - no problems with them being chewy. So rich and delicious!  I definitely recommend this one.

We enjoyed this recipe, even the next day re-warmed.  I did use half & half instead of heavy cream.  Also added a lot more cheese.  Next time I'll use the sun dried tomatoes packed in oil (I think it will give more flavor).  This was an expensive recipe to make, but, would make again for special dinner.

The BEST recipe I've gotten off of any website.  I used half-and-half instead of the heavy cream for nutritional purposes plus omitted the sun-dried tomatoes.  

Recipe turned out great and was well worth the effort.  Thanks!

OMG!this was amazing...a huge dish if there is only 2 of you, but leftovers are still wonderful. MADE 3 changes, used HALf& Half instead of cream, use lots more cheese (pre-mixed asiago,romano,parm mix from walmart for $1.86/bag...) and sauted onions,garlic and such with butter but added 2 tbsp white cooking wine.(really good) This dish knocked our socks off!!! with an Italian husband,it reminded him of his true roots!!! thanks!!!! happy cooking

Looks great and tastes even better.  I made two small changes.  I browned the chicken first and added a little sherry to the cream sauce.  Thank you.

AllI can say is:" Thank you, thank you, thank you!" I made this recipe for an intimate last minute dinner party and WOWED them all! It was not only delicious, but, fairly simple to make. I, too, cut back on some of the fat and didn't grill the chicken. It was outstanding. I even had the guests ASK for leftovers to bring home! That was a first! I'll bet this recipe will be awesome with shrimp, too!Thank you for sharing this recipe which is sure to become a family favorite. Carrie Beth

Excellent Flavor.  Everyone loved it.  I would only eat this once a year for fear of instant cardiac disease due to unbelievably high fat content.

I added sauteed mushrooms and nixed the green onions.

good, creamy pasta dish. needs much more flavor so increase ingredients or use others for stronger flavor. i didn't have chicken so used bell peppers, onions and garbanzo beans. used bow-tie pasta. i enjoyed making a home-made sauce and combination of cheese and sun-dried tomatos. Thanks.

This recipe was great! I made it a couple times and never had enough... I have to remember to double it! I used a little more asiago, and a little less chicken as my sauce came out very thick the first time.  Enjoy!!!

I changed up the recipe a bit.  Added portabella mushrooms and chopped spinach instead of the onions and chicken.  I also used 1C of fat free half and half and 1C milk instead of all the heavy cream (tried to decrease some of the fat).  Increased the asiago cheese to about 1/2cup and added a nice amount of rosemary.  It was delicious-

I would give this 10 stars if I could!  It was surprisingly very quick ( I had all four burners going at once!)  I substituted the bacon for bacon bits and was completely satisfied.  I did used more 2% milk than cream and only used a regular old onion because it was what I had on hand.  Did not really enjoy the tomatos, (it did say to put it in, unless that was recently added).  Husband enjoyed it much.  We have tons of leftovers even though I scaled it to 3!  Definite keeper!

I cooked it three times now. It is really addicting! You could use whatever cheese and pasta you want. I tried it with a mixed blend of cheddar and mozzarella. This is a great recipe because my friends and I loved it!

We liked this meal.  I think I would have looked for ways to use fewer dishes next time. I don't normally measure bacon in cups.  I cooked 7 slices and crumbled it and that seemed adequate.  Green onions is another thing I don't measure in cups.  I used 4 green onions and that seemed to work.  I subbed out half and half and 2% milk for the heavy cream. It was still plenty rich. It says it serves 8, I think 4-5 adult main course servings is more accurate.

Sauce is delicious!  A few changes: 
I added 3 oz Asiago & little basil to the sauce.  
I used 2 cups 1/2 & 1/2 & 1 cup milk instead of the heavy cream.  
I also omitted the onions & butter.
I had homemade sun dried tomatoes and had no issues with them being hard like others.
Next time I would definitely add mushrooms and the omit the chicken.  Green onions are a take it or leave it.

This recipe was amazing! Directions were clear, and I didn't have any snags. One thing to note: this does not keep for leftovers!! The leftovers were full of oil, and the cream sauce was virtually non-existent. Definitely eat this all at once.

Restaurant food at home!  We prepared as written but used a 12 oz. box of bowtie pasta instead.  We used sun dried tomatoes in olive oil and we topped with additional asiago.  The dish is (obviously) very rich so I suggest  it be served with a tossed spinich salad with a light dressing and some crunchy- crust french bread (because you will want to get every drop of that cream sauce).  I am making this again this weekend but this time to show off for guests!  Thank you, Michelle!  (Edit...I’ve now made this several times and I’ve substituted fresh Parmesan for the Asiago and prefer it that way.)

Made a few substitutes based on what I had on hand. Didn't have cream so I used 1% milk with about 2 tablespoons of light margarine. Also substituted a parmesan/romano blend for the cheese. I used chicken bacon and used the same pan without dumping out the left over drippings and cooked the onions in that instead of butter. I think this made it more flavorful. I only had yellow onions and I think they were fine to use. I also added salt and pepper to taste. This recipe was husband approved!!! I will definitely make again!!!

I thought this recipe was just OK. I pretty much made it according to how it's written, except I added more asiago, red pepper flakes and used 1% milk in place of some of the heavy cream. I found this recipe to be very rich and some of the flavors didn't combine very well. I love sundried tomatoes, but I don't think they compliment bacon very well. If I ever make it again I think I'll omit the chicken and the bacon. Maybe I'll add sliced bell peppers instead.

I loved this! I should mention that I did cut back on the onions. I used a little less than half the amount required. I could have used more. Next time I will simply half it. I also did not use the bacon because I didn't have it or the parsley. It was still outstanding. Will make again!

I have made this with the chicken and without.  Delicious either way.  I used pancetta instead of bacon.  I have been told by my friends and family hat this is restaurant quality worthy.

great base recipe for creamy alfredo sauce. Not ever going to purchase jars of alfredo again. I didn't have asiago or sun dried tomatoes on hand so I used parmesan and fresh grape tomatoes sliced in half. Turned out amazing. I did also through in a few diced galric cloves to the pan when I sauted the onions and used more like a 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese insted of the tablespoon it called for.

I thought the dish was amazing, with just a slight few changes.... I tried to lighten it up a bit (but since it was my first time making, didn't want to alter too much) I used 3/4 cup 2% milk and 2 1/2 cups heavy cream... I did double the garlic, and used a little over 1/2 cup asiago in the sauce and omitted the green onion. When I made the sauce I first sauteed the onions in 2.5 tbsp butter, then added garlic and then the cream, bouillon, cheese, cornstarch mix, tomatoes, and fresh parsley. I let that simmer while I cooked the chicken in the bacon pan (after draining almost all the grease), added some garlic, and chicken broth to that pan and cooked till done... Cut up chicken, added to sauce, added the cooked and crumble bacon (I have found it easiest to cut up bacon into pieces with kitchen shears and then fry it and drain it in a strainer) and then tossed it with the pasta...added extra asiago on top. After all that, it was still missing something, I think it needs red peper flakes or cayanne...definitely some salt... my husband said it was kind of bland. Flavor was excellent... just needs a little boost. 
I know that my version is not quite the orignal, but I found this to work best and easiest for prep and taste.

Oh-So-Good!
 I followed other suggestions and used 2% milk entirely. I added tons of fresh grated asiago. I buy my sun-dried tomatoes dry, so I mwaved a bunch for about 30 seconds, covered, in evoo. I skipped butter, instead rendering in bacon fat. I only use thick cut butcher bacon. I skipped the chicken. I also used with 100% wheat penne (no durum or semolina wheat)

Very rich and creamy, but seemed to be lacking something.  If we try it again (after I get over the guilt of the heavy cream sauce) I'll have to try some of the suggestions others have listed to liven it up.

I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but I found the sun-dried tomatoes overpowering. I may try this again, but if so, I will use half of the sun-dried tomatoes called for.

Great ingredients with flavors I love.  Was surprised to find it took nearly 90 minutes as I didn't use any pre-prepared meats or substitutions.  A short order chef might be able to cook this in 25 minutes but I sure can't.  All the flavors were lost in a melange that tasted good - but my expectation was that it would be amazing.  Will not be trying it again.  It did look great!    With the same ingredients I probably could have made several dishes that would have highlighted the tastes of the ingredients and been worth the effort.

I don't know.. I felt for all the ingredients and fat in this dish it came up a bit short. I halved the fat by putting half heavy cream and half milk but I can't see how this altered the taste all that much. It was still a very rich dish. Just eh.

Great Recipe. I made a few changes as others suggested.Used 1 C Milk & 1 Cup Cream, Increased Asiago to 1 Cup, added 1t Cayenne Pepper & 1t Italian Seasoning. I also used canned Stewed tomatos. Overall great flavor and easy. Instead of frying the bacon...I just threw it in the oven when I started to prepare dinner. Will make again.

Absolutely delicious! Takes quite a few pots/pans to make it but worth it! Only altered the recipe by adding additional asiago cheese.

This dish is deeelishous!!! My stepson got seconds so I know it was good. I used angel hair pasta instead of the bow ties & I added frozen chopped spinach to the cheese sause towards the end when you are reheating. I also used Kraft shredded parm, ramano & asiago cheese about 1/4c. Instead of grilling chicken I fried it in the bacon grease. I did not use the green onions or the red onion

After being out in the cold rainy all afternoon, this hit the spot.  I didn't bother substituting fat free half n' half for the cream - just went full fat.....and it was delicious.  No alternations were necessary for a comfort meal.

This was sooooo good! I used almost a full cup of freshly grated Asiago, half and half for the first part and 2% for the last part.  I cut up my chicken and put in the pot with my bacon, onion, and garlic. Next time I will cook the bacon by itself for a bit first as it never got crispy.  I omitted the butter all together and used a little olive oil instead, but didn't really need it at all since you have bacon grease.  I used a yellow onion in place of the red and didn't use the green onions at all.  I used sun-dried tomatoes in oil and just eye balled the amount.  I also used a lot more garlic than called for since I love it!  Husband and 8 yr old loved it!  Thanks so much!

Very tasty! Though I had to substitute ingredients I did not have- this recipe was full of flavor. I could not find Asiago, so I used twice the amount in Parmesan cheese- that gave it a very nice flavor. I will make this again!

I made this last night and absolutely loved it!  My only change was using shrimp instead of chicken.  Next time I'll use both!  I served with the garlic-cheese flat bread from this website, so not a healthy, lowfat meal.  Great for a special occasion!  Better than going out for pasta - So yummy - thank you for the posting!

Excellent! Did involve three pots, and some work, but was worth it for us. I would cook the chicken and bacon ahead of time. Thank you for a new chicken/pasta dish!

This was incredibly delicious!  I tried to make it exactly as posted; however, I only had about half a cup of sundried tomatoes packed in oil and I messed up with the chicken (didn't realize it had to be precooked).  In any event, I cooked the cubed chicken with the onions in butter before adding the green onions and cream.  It was definitely worth the effort.  Kids loved it and husband had seconds and thirds.  We are still enjoying leftovers in the office.

Me and my husband enjoyed this recipe minus the sun dried tomatoes. I did not like the rubbery taste they gave the dish.

I used an entire container of cheese, and doubled the tomato amount. 

Once "doctored" it was really good. Will make again.

Incredible recipe!  I made it vegetarian by deleting the chicken and replacing the bacon with tiny bits of tofu, 'slowly fried' on medium heat in oil & butter and sprinkling with salt, soy sauce and a bit of worcestershire sauce now and then until attaining bacon-ish flavor.  I then added the butter and onions and continued the recipe.  I love the green onions in this, they really add to the flavor.  The cream/sun dried tomato sauce is very similar to one we serve over gnocchi (and love), but the additions of this sauce make something new, totally different and we love it with the bow-tie noodles!  definitely add extra cheese, use sun-dried tomatoes packed in a flavorful oil and we like a little extra cream too to make it saucier.

This was so delicious my husband loved it. I took the other's advice and put in 1 cup of the asiago cheese and didn't use the whole red onion. I added shrimp along with the chicken and sprinkled it with some crushed red peppers and some cayenne pepper to ad some spice this was super good, and after surving it I It topped off with grated asiago cheese on top delicious thanks so much for a tasty meal.

I made this for a large dinner party and it turned out great! I ended up having to simmer the sauce for longer just to keep it warm for guests due to late arrivals and it still turned out amazing! This will be a favorite for our family and will be made again and again! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was really good, except for the sun dried tomatoes.  They were really chewy.  I have never tried them before, so this was an experiment.  The sauce was excellent tho, and I will be making it again without the tomatoes.

This was delicious.  I did add more asiago cheese 6 oz, and 1/2 a bag of mixed italian shredded cheese.  This was a big hit!!! I did salt and pepper and used PENNE pasta.  Will be making this again!

I made this recipe at the request of my girlfriend, whose favorite dish when she goes out to eat is sun-dried tomato pasta with chicken.  She gave this version an enthusiastic thumbs up, claiming it was even better than the restaurant's.  I thoroughly enjoyed it myself.  Warning: it's fairly time-consuming, especially if you grill the chicken fresh, but worth the effort.  I wouldn't skimp on any of the ingredients here; low-fat is not what this recipe is about.

The dish is so rich, creamy and delicious!  I first had it at a dinner party another couple hosted.  I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because 1 Tbsp. of Asiago is not enough to enhance the flavor at all.  I added 1/4c.  I also used shrimp instead of chicken because I didn't have any chicken on hand, but it was equally as good.

This recipe is definately worth the trouble.  My 2 kids and husband raved about it, and my senior-citizen mother who HATES pasta dishes of any sort even had seconds.  I, on the other hand, thought it was good but not amazing.  I like highly flavored dishes and this was more subtle in it's flavors.  A few chopped kalamata olives in it I think would be good.

This was absolutely excellent!!  Like one of the reviewers, I used extra asiago cheese to make it thicker, instead of cornstarch.  I also used turkey bacon instead of regular.  This recipe was a hit at my party!!  I will definitely make this again!!

This was a great dish to make when getting other cooks involved.  Had one friend on the chicken- another on the pasta- another on the sauce - another on the dicing.

It was a hit with the guys. And for myself (who isn't much of a dried tomato fan) I have a new appreciation for sun-dried tomatoes.

this was great and my picky husband loved it.  make sure to cut the tomatoes into small pieces (mine were too big).  i actually didnt have asiago so i left that out, and i used left over alfredo sauce that worked great instead of the the creams.  i also added a lot of cayenne to spice it up..great recipe!

My family and friends beg for this dish.  I personally omit the red onion as I think it is too strong ad over powers some of the other flavors. I also follow the other suggestions of adding a lot more asiago to get that flavor.  I have found that this can be a very speedy recipe if you buy precooked bacon and chicken (like you would put in a salad).  Ultimately this is one of the top ten recipies in my home.

YUMMY! I made this last night and I cant wait to eat some leftovers.  I have to say my Mom was not all that impressed i think because of the strong taste of the sun dried tomatoes.  But for me and my hubby 5+ stars on this one.  I agree you should use a penne pasta i tried bowtie (was all I had on hand) soaked up too much of the wonderful sauce.  Thanks.

This is good stuff...let me start off by saying that. This is REALLY, REALLY, REALLY good,  sinful, fattening, luscious, heavenly stuff. Yum! Okay, onto the review...I halved the recipe, and since I didn't have butter I used the bit of bacon grease that was left in the pan after I fried it. Instead of just asiago cheese, I tossed in a little Stilton that I had in the fridge, and lacking cream, I just put in some sour cream before it was done cooking. I didn't have any pasta (quelle horreur!) so I served this with rice instead. I can't wait to make t again. Thanks for sharing!

So good! I noticed that a lot of people reviewing this recipe used a mix of milk and cream to cut down on fat - it's easier to just use fat free half and half. I used that in place of all three cups of cream in the recipe and the sauce still came out absolutely flavorful. I thought bacon would be a little weird in this dish so I used mushrooms instead.

Excellant recipe.  I made the cream sauce earlier in the day and used a asiago, parm, and fontiana cheese blend and refrigerated it.  Pan seared the chicken with grill seasonings in a smaller amount of the bacon fat.  I used 2 percent milk for the second part of the recipe to reduce the amount of fat.  This one tastes just like a pasta dish that I always order at the Macaroni Grill.  You will love this one.

VERY VERY GOOD.  I doubled the amount of cheese for some extra flavor and used 1% milk in the final stage instead of heavy cream.  I also did NOT put any meat in the dish.  My girlfriend and I loved it and will be eating the leftovers tomorrow night...mummm good.

I changed the recipe a little and for that I am keeping this recipe at 5 STARS because I can't imagine it getting anything but BETTER. I didnt use the bacon. I increased the asiago cheese to 1 cup and used additional sun dried tomatoes to "finish the jar" and I also used the oil from the tomatoes when sauteing the onions. I used an extra cup of heavy cream (operator error!). This dish was needless to say REALLY rich! 
With the changes I made it was a little thick and cheesy but delicious. The only thing this effected was that it wasn't picture perfect. Next time I will use the right amount of heavy cream and probably use part milk as other reviewers stated. I probably won't use the tomato oil to saute the onions. It tasted good but altered the appearance some. I'd like for a dish to be delicious AND appealing to company! Very good recipe.

I've got to give this five stars even though I'm not a big fan of the sun dried tomatoes. For me, doing without them would've made this an awesome recipe. It was still very good with them, though.

This was fantastic! Rich, creamy, everything I could have asked for! Even my mother LOVED it and she HATES pasta! This was the first recipe I EVER used and it went perfectly. Just make sure there are no distractions because you have to move quickly. IT WAS SO GOOD. Kudos

This is the most fabulous pasta dish I have ever made.  I made it for company-twice and both times it got rave reviews.  The sauce made without the chicken is also a great accompaniment with the beef tenderloin I grilled.

This recipe was fantastic. Like others have said, I replaced the bacon with mushrooms and upped the cheese to about 1 cup. I also added a about 1 or 2 tblsp of chopped fresh basil to the recipe and it was absolutely great. I will definitely make this again.

I've made this dish several times and have tweaked it each time. For a low-fat version of this recipe, I subbed the cream for fat-free half-and-half, used turkey bacon, added portabello mushrooms and sprinkled in some white pepper. The leftovers don't look pretty after being refrigerated, but it's still very tasty! Thanks for sharing!

Excellent recipe, but loaded with fat!!!  I tried to cut down where I could: using half and half instead of the heavy cream, omitting the butter.  In the end it still tasted wonderful and rich.  I loved it and so did my husband and 2 kids.

This dish is very flavorful.  I found it tasty. Choosing the correct brand of sundried tomatoes can make or break this dish. It needs a full bodied tomato with very little tartness.  I also found  I could substitute some of the heavy cream with light cream and half and half.  This helped reduce the caloric intake. This is a great recipe with many flavors.

This recipe is just over the top!!!!  I took others advice and added more Asiago cheese.  I don't understand why some had trouble with the sun dried tomatoes the directions clearly state when to put them in.  I would give this more stars if I could!

I made this for company, and it was a huge hit.  I used 3 cups of the heavy cream.  Next time, just to cut down on the calories, I will substitute one cup with milk.....I also used a bit more asiago cheese than the recipe called for.  Very few leftovers....

My family really liked this recipe.  I read reviews before cooking and did use 1 cup of milk in place of the cream at the end.  I used pre-cut tomatoes in olive oil, which added a nice flavor.  Maybe a bit too much bacon, but not horrible.  Also, I did add more cheese, 3 Tablespoons.  Served with a fresh bread and it was so so good.  Will make a family regular!

This is a very rich, but very good recipe.  I used Brakeburn Italian style chicken breast and it added a very good Italian grilled taste.  Next time I would try fresh tomato instead of sun-dried tomatoes.  Very tasty!

Considering all the ingredients this recipe called for, I thought it was rather bland.  Wasn't really worth the time involved.  I was going to serve it to company and was kind of glad when company canceled.

I made it exactly as written. I omitted green onions and added a splash of white cooking wine. It was great!  My kiddos and husband gobbled it up!

Okay, I made quite a few changes but stuck with the main ingredients. I cut 2 large chicken breasts in half and browned in olive oil and then cooked through adding some chicken broth to keep from burning. Meanwhile I cooked some fettuccine and set aside. When the chicken was done I removed it from the pan and added 1/4 cup of butter, not quite 2 cups heavy cream, 1 cup sundried tomatoes, 2 teaspoons minced garlic and brought to a simmer. I threw in some fresh broccoli and sliced fresh mushrooms and cooked until crisp tender. I added the cooked fettuccine, mixed it together and topped it with a cup of grated Asiago cheese and the 4 chicken pieces. Super easy and super good!

This is going to be part of the family recipes now, I just made a few modifications.  I use more bacon, more asiago, more chicken that was marinated well, also used sun dried tomatoes from a jar, and I used a couple shallots in place of the red and green onion.  I have made it twice now, and both times it was phenomenal!!!  It takes a little time, but well worth it!!!

Excellent recipe.  I used half and half cream instead of the whipping cream and it was still rich and creamy.  I also added a half package of frozen spinach.  I would imagine you could add almost any vegetable if you like..........You've gotta try it.

I used 1 cup cream and 2 cups whole milk, but otherwise kept to the recipe and it was awesome!
I used julienned sun-dried tomatoes in oil and they worked great. It was a lot of prep work (cooking chicken, bacon, and dicing veggies) so I'll be keeping this for weekend meals.

This came absolutely delicious with a little tweaking! The kids went crazy for it! I used 1 cup of heavy cream and one cup of 2% to start and used about a cup of asiago cheese to give it a nice rich cheesy flavor and stirred in the sun dried tomatoes right after the cheese and let them cook into the sauce a little. I used a whole red onion and doubled the garlic and to top the plate off I sprinkled it with some Asiago and fresh chopped parsley and served it with fresh baked Italian bread! Yum! This was very heavy and rich so eating smaller servings of this was a good idea, made a lot of food, plenty of leftovers after 4 of us eating!

Absolutely spectacular with my modifications per other people's advice.

I boiled chopped tomatoes for 15 min in chicken broth.

I added more seasonings red pepper flakes, pepper, pinch of cayenne pepper.

I added the bacon last. I used 75% half & half and 25% whole milk. 

I sauteed red pepper flakes and spinach with red onions and removed spinach and added last along with bacon and parsley.

Doubled the butter. 

Great recipe!

Amazing!! Once I made my own changes of course. Exchanged heavy cream for 10% light cream (next time might blend with 1% milk for an even lighter version), increased cheese to between 1/3 - 1/2 cup, added in red pepper chili flakes, cayenne pepper to taste, increased garlic & used chicken thighs because I find them more tender & flavourful. Leftovers the next day were awesome & this was a big hit with my family!

We really liked this recipe.  I didn't really change much, but I did change a few things-mostly quantities. 

Definitely more cheese--how can it be an asiago cream sauce with only a T of asiago cheese?  =)  I almost wonder if that was a typo-I probably used almost a cup, then sprinkled more on top when finished.  I used less butter to saute the onions-1/4 cup would have been too much.  I also used half and half for the last cup of cream, and didn't do the parsley. Oh, and used reg yellow onion. A little more garlic, but I always do more garlic.

The sun dried tomatoes I used were packed in oil, so no need to soften-just rinse well.  I used precooked bacon, as I had a lot of that on hand.  Plus, it is a little bit healthier than reg bacon, although really-in a dish like this, who is counting?  

I cooked the chicken breast in a little bit of olive oil, with salt and pepper, instead of grilled chicken.  then sliced against the grain.  I used that pan for the sauteing of onions etc.  

I wonder the reason at the end for adding a cup of cream, then adding in the asiago cream sauce.  Couldn't you just do three cups of cream in the beginning, and omit that step?  I make cream sauce a lot, and have never seen this.

The meal was good, but just not as good as the amount of time it took to make.  I have used the sauce for the Chicken Cordon Blu II recipe and doubled it adding different cheeses including Asiago and it is out of this world.  This just didn't live up to the expectations.

It was very very good!  But I can't give it a 5- because I say less tomatoes and more garlic (for my taste).  I think I'll also try it without the bacon next time.  This is an extra step, an extra cost, and extra calories for an item I usually don't keep in my kitchen.  It adds one extra flavor to the recipe- but it would have been delicious without it too.

I followed this recipe almost as is - I did not have Asiago cheese , so I used shredded parmesan.  Other than that, I followed the recipe to a T.  All my husband said was, " You can make this anytime."  'Nuf said.

I followed the suggestion of others and added more asiago.  It was way too strong and the sun dried tomatoes were too overpowering.  Parmesan cheese as a substitute would have been perfect and not using the tomatoes.

Good recipe, but I did make changes to make it a little healthier.  I used spaghetti squash instead of pasta, milk and chicken broth instead of cream and boullion, and 1/2 the amt of sundried tomatoes (this was our first try with them and I wasn't sure if we'd like them). It turned out pretty well.  The bacon makes the dish I think, so the more the better!

I made this exactly as written except I thought it called for mushrooms, so I sauteed 8 oz of mushrooms with the garlic and onion.  My husband was very skeptical (he even kept some chicken out incase he needed to make a sandwich), but he was the first to go back for seconds.  Will make again at special occasions, as this is not very good for your figure.

Used 1/3 Parmesan cheese, mixture of 2% milk + half and half, 3 large garlic cloves for the sauce.  (Make sure that when you increase the cheese that the butter you use is unsalted.).  The sauce had wonderful flavor.  What would make it even better next time around is 1/4 cup of white wine added when cooking the onions.  Instead of using grilled chicken, I boiled 2 large chicken breasts with garlic powder, dried onions, salt and pepper.  After 30 minutes of boiling, I removed the chicken and after slicing put the chicken into the sauce.  Also added 1 cup of frozen peas/carrots while the brown rice pasta was boiling.  Next time I would like to add more veggies like mushrooms and bell peppers.

This was awesome!!! When I can get my dh, 6 year old and 15 month old all to devour it, its a keeper!! I added ALOT more asiago to it, and seasoned my thinly sliced chicken breasts with salt, pepper, and italian seasoning before grilling. At the end to just me and my dh's plates, I added a bit more salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes to give it that extra kick!! Sooo yummy!

This can be made a little healthier and more flavorful without much alteration, per others reviews. Skip the butter and just saute the onions and garlic (and uncooked chopped chicken) with uncooked chopped bacon pieces after they've cooked down a bit.  I don't measure strips of bacon by the cup.  I used half of a standard package, but in retrospect I think 2/3 of a package would have been perfect. I didn't bother dividing the cream, but used 1 c cream and 2 c 2% milk for the sauce. Also added a whole cup of asiago. The texture was perfect. (You could easily add 1.5 c asiago and the sauce wouldn't suffer!) I used sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil, which don't need extra cooking time.  This sauce requires a healthy dose of salt and pepper to optimize the flavor.  Could definitely also add red pepper flakes if you like heat.  I  added 2/3 of a bag of a fresh spinach after I'd combined everything together and allowed it to wilt for a couple minutes. I threw the green onions on top along with the parsley rather than cooking them.  Yumma!

Very nice recipe - as suggested previously, i sauteed the vege's in the bacon drippings, used 50/50 2% milk and cream, and added ~2 cups of sliced mushrooms after the vegetables were 80% done.

This recipe was awesome!  I had to do a couple of modifications because I did not have heavy cream... I used buttermilk instead & rinsed petite diced tomatoes.  Even my 12 year old twins want to eat this again.  Thank you for posting the recipe!!!

Too much prepping, too many pots to wash, too much money and not enough flavor.  I couldn't wait to try this recipe and I followed it to the "T" however it was very bland.  Although we were able to eat it, so I gave it two stars.  The bacon added a strange flavor. Maybe with some changes it could be better.

Very yummy but definitely not worth the work for me. At one point I had 3 pots on the stove, the oven on (roasting the chicken) and the microwave on too (only because I did myself a favor and bought the bacon pre-cooked), and kids to watch, so that spelt trouble. Had I known it took so long to make, I'd have gone out to an italian restaurant instead... H7Th hubby and kids weren't even crazy about this dish.

This recipe is restaurant quality.  We felt like we were eating out.  It is soooo good.  I took some of the suggestions of previous reviews and added mushrooms, used 1/2 milk, 1/2 heavy cream.  This is a keeper in my house.

This dish was so good!! I did add some citrus and basil seasoning and added more asiago cheese then it called for. I added 3 cloves of garlic instead of 2. Next time I will add about another 3/4 bacon, mince the onions and use less of those. But, this is a great and filling dinner!!

I made this as written except added fresh sliced mushrooms which required some more butter.  My kids said it was "restaurant quality."  Great recipie ........... lot of  prep but worth it in the end.  I also used the sun dried tomatoes that came in a jar soaked in Olive Oil, so they were already soft and the addition of the Olive Oil was great ..... next time I make I will add some fresh basil leaves which I think will give it that extra little boost of flavor it was lacking.

Very good.. everyone enjoyed.  I enjoyed it even more after I added more shredded asiago cheese and s&p before serving.  Another similar recipe that I enjoy from this site is Bow Ties with Sausage, Tomatoes and Cream.

Really good!  I used fat free 1/2 & 1/2 for the cream, and added about 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese in addition to the Asiago to give it a little more taste.  Will try sun-dried tomatoes packaged in a jar next time instead of the dried to give a little more moisture.  Definitely a keeper!

This was delicious and my kids, who hate sun dried tomatoes, had seconds and thirds. I used half and half and it still came out great. And I had no asiago so i used fresh grated pecorino.  Thanks for a keeper!

Oh My Gosh is this dish amazing!!!  We all loved it to pieces!!  I followed the recipe pretty much exactly.  I used one extra clove of garlic and used Light Cream instead of Heavy Cream towards the end.  I did use Heavy Cream at the beginning.  I grilled my chicken on the grill marinated with Italian salad dressing.  This recipe is definitely labor intensive, but well worth it!!

This is an excellent recipe, however I chose to cut way back on the cream and used mostly 1/2 & 1/2 and milk.  I added much more Asiago which added to the 'creaminess' as well as added flavor, and sprinkled in cayenne pepper. I had uncooked chicken breasts, so cubed them and browned with the onions and garlic in a little bacon fat.  My picky eaters thought it was great!

This was pretty good, although I believe I will make some changes for the next time.  3 cups of heavy cream sounded like too much, and indeed, the sauce overpowered the whole dish and it tastes too rich.  Next time I'll use half and half or milk.  Also, I don't think 1 TB of asiago is enough!  I couldn't taste the cheese with all the cream involved.  The onion/garlic mixture was great, however, and I think would do better with a less heavy sauce.

The first time I made this, I did not like it.  I repeated it just in case I did something wrong the first time.  I'm glad I gave this recipe a 2nd chance.  It was absolutely delicious.  I used 1 c of the cheese and used 1 c milk for 1 c heavy cream. YUM!

excellent.. my sister and i felt like we were eating at a local fine italian restaurant! definitely add sun-dried tomatoes right into the pot from the very beginning, as someone else suggested.. also used 1 full cup of asiago for more flavor.. the flavors just melt in together nicely!

I made this exactly according to the recipe and it was awesome.  I usally make quick meals, so this one seemed to take me forever and it had a lot of steps for me, but it was worth the time.  Totally unhealthy but really good!

I had half a jar of sun dried tomato pesto and some Asiago cheese leftover from another recipe so decided to try  this dish. I used about 1/2 cup of shredded Asiago in the sauce instead of only a tbsp. I didn't have any heavy cream so I substituted 2 cups of 1% milk and 1 cup of half&half for the 3 cups of cream. Instead of cooking the bacon I substituted real bacon bits from a jar (not the imitation kind). We really enjoyed it and didn't find it bland at all.

I used this recipe because I wanted to use up the rest of the Asiago cheese I made with another recipe on this website.  My husband and I liked this recipe, but my kids did not, so that is why I gave it only 4 stars.  The entire family preferred the Chicken and Bowtie Pasta with Asiago Cream Sauce recipe a lot more.  I think the sun dried tomatoes is not what went well with my kids.

I chose this Asiago Sun Dried Tomato Pasta for a wedding. I cooked enough for 185 people and got so many compliments and also many requests for the recipe. It's been 3 years and I still get the compliments and the requests. It's a wonderful, tasty and colorful dish. Excellent!!!

This recipe is absolutely sensational!! and VERY yummy! I've made it twice now and I have had nothing but compliments.  I used 1 cup of cream and 1 cup of 1% milk for the sauce.  Also I added the sundried tomatoes in first along with the juices in the jar, which I think brought out a lot more flavor (I didn't do this the first time I made it).  I did not add the bacon.

This is an easy recipe and it is delicious.  I am a guy and if I can make it without screwing it up, (I'm not a cook!), then anyone can.  I couldn't find stand alone asiago , but I did find a asiago, parmesan, romano mix and it still came out delicious.  It impressed both my wife and my mother!  Oh yeah, leftovers were excellent as well!

I loved this Recipe! I have had it in my recipe box for a few years now. It's just very time consuming, there is a restraunt that makes this same recipe in my town and it's cheaper than buying all the ingredents. Still very good if you have the time.

My husband and I really liked this but it was not a hit for my three year-old...he didn't like the sun-dried tomatoes. Since the recipe only calls for one tablespoon of Asiago cheese, I just substituted for fresh Parmesan cheese since they are very similar cheeses and my grocery store only sold Asiago in wedges costing $5.00 a pop. Also, I thought that one cup of sun-dried tomatoes was a bit much an overwhelming. I got like three chunks of sun-dried tomatoe in every bite. I will put about half a cup next time. Other than that the dish was wonderful!!

This recipes was awesome. I did increase the amount of asiago to about 1 1/2-2 cups as the suggestions said with asiago on top of each serving. I also did not want to add bacon so instead I sauteed mushrooms. It ended up I forgot to add the last cup of heavy whipping cream, but the pasta came out perfect without it. My husband liked it so much he had 2 plates full and plans on eating the leftovers tonight for dinner as well. Said it was even better than going out to eat for this type of dish!

This recipe was a hit.  I modified it some by omitting the bouillion, cornstarch, bacon, green onion and parsley.  I also added mushrooms and spinach.  I tend not to measure anything but can definetly say I used more garlic and cheese.  I used a full 6 oz container of the asiago.  All in all it truned out great.

Enjoyed this a lot. Substituted a tablespoon of Mascarpone for the Asiago and added a bit of Parmesan as well. I also sliced a whole mild chili down the center, removed the seeds, and added it to the sauce at the same time as the tomatoes, removing it before serving. The heat was a nice addition.

Fabulous!  I took this to a BBQ and everyone asked for the recipe.  Only because I could not find Asiago cheese where we live, I used Parmesan cheese in replacement.  Still came out SUPERB!!  I have already made this twice and sent the recipe off to friends and family.  Thanks for a great recipe.

great recipe, a bit rich though.  But still great.  I did substitute one of the cups of cream for milk, the guilt of all that cream got to me.  I also use the sundried tomatoes in a jar.  I like the added flavor they seem to add.  I think next time I will cut back on the tomatoes and the bacon a bit.  Also, to save time, use the already cooked bacon bits, recipe style.  SO much simplier than frying up all that bacon if you ask me.  I along with others added a cup of asiago cheese.

This was an excellent dinner.  Everyone loved it except my one daughter who isn't fond of tomatoes.  The reason I rated it a 4 instead of a 5 is because it was a lot of work.  By the time I grilled the chicken, made the bacon and did all of the other prep work I was exhausted.  On the positive side though all of this could be done in advance and at the end it would be very easy and quick.  Even with all the putzy work I will make this again.

I LOVE this recipe. It is perfect for entertaing and delicious. I have made a few adjustments to it that have made it even more bar none! I added pine nuts and, a hint of olive oil and ground red pepper flake to the final step. These touches give it that final zing if you like a little spice! Yummy yum yum!

This was very good. I didn't add the bacon and I don't think it really needed it, the sauce was rich and flavourful without it. We could taste the chicken, tomato, garlic & cheese in every mouthful. There wasn't a single that flavour dominated the dish which is what made it so good.

This was very good.  Very creamy and the tomato was just right.  I didn't give it 5 stars because:
I added more cheese.
I didn't see why you had to make the cheese part 1st-then add it later.  This made another step that didn't seem necessary. 
This did however make enough sauce for 1lb of pasta.
  I will make again, adding the extra cheese.

I made a low fat version of this recipe and it still turned out great.  I'm pretty sure it would be better with heavy cream, but most things are.  I used fat free half & half and skipped the bacon.  Although I made up for it a bit by adding about 2/3 cup of a parmesean, romano & asiago cheese mix.  I had to put in 2 T of cornstarch to thicken it up a bit more.  I also added mushrooms & red bell pepper and used a shallot instead of red onion (it's what I had on hand.)  As well as rotini pasta instead of bowtie (again, what was on hand).  Lots more parsley too!  I think a bit of spinach would have been a nice touch as well so I'll do that next time.  THIS MADE A TON!  I should have halved the recipe.  Three of us ate and I think there's enough for more than 6 servings if you don't overeat.

Very delicious. I made this for an opening reception.  Fifteen minutes after i put out the platter, all the pasta was gone. I made a small change...I used a small block of cheese (stirred it in til it melted) to thicken the sauce instead of corn starch.

Definately use half and half instead of cream.  I thought this recipe had too many onions and would omit the red onions next time.  I also didn't taste the bacon much.  The sun-dried tomatoes did give a great taste and over-all this was a "keeper".

Very good.  I made this tonight for dinner.  I subed the heavy cream for half-and-half like other reviewers and I did not have any asiago cheese so I used fresh parmesan instead.  Still turned out great!  My picky husband even went back for seconds!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!:)

Pretty good. Not lying when they say this is rich....I tweaked it a bit, used about 3/4 cup fresh parmessean cheese. Also instead of using grilled chicken, I used costco's chicken in a can, which was pretty good. Overall I would make this again....

Amazing.  So simple and delicious...I subbed out some milk for the heavy cream and it was still unbelievable.  Perfect dinner for a rainy night.  Eating the leftovers for lunch as I type...yumm.

My husband liked this very much, but way too fattening for me (I don't diet). His cholesterol is through the roof though.  Had to add many different spices to enhance this dish because we both felt it lacked flavor.  Glad that everyone else was impressed!

Yummy recipe.  I made this with cut up grilled chicken.  It was a big hit for a dinner party.  People were really impressed.  The only down side is that it is a lot of work but who ever said good food came easy!!  Excellent.

My husband is very picky when it comes to food. But I can say that he completely loved this! I added some more cheese than was listed here and it tasted awesome! He even said there was no need to go to the Olive Garden, this beat it out.

Amazing. I added mushrooms and more asiago cheese as some of the others have mentioned, a little cayenne pepper too. I used 18% table cream, but as the sauce simmers, try adding a little skim milk if you find the consistency to be too thick.

Fantastic recipe!  Definitely a keeper.  I made a couple changes...  only used 1/4 cup of bacon and instead of using cream in the last part of the recipe, I used Half and Half instead.

Pretty good.  I used half cream and half milk to cut back a smidge on fat and didn't use bacon.  Also I just used a regular yellow onion since I didn't have red.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and added salt, pepper and some red pepper flakes.  Yum!

I would give this a 100 out of 10 if I could! It is the best dish ever, and doesn't take too long if you use pre-cooked chicken strips and pre-chopped onions and garlic.  I also cook the bacon in my George Foreman grill to get the best result.  My favorite recipe to date!

I made this dish for 12 people. Be careful when changing servings sizes in the recipe as it yieled enough for 20!! I did up the amount of Asiago and instead of using heavy cream on the finish I used chicken broth which thinned out the sauce, which was too thick. I also used pre-cooked chicken and fresh basil instead of parsley. I was a big hit and we have plenty of leftovers!!

This recipe is great.  I used 5% cream which worked well - much lighter than the heavy cream.  The cornstarch will thinken the lighter cream.  Also, I would cut the bacon in half next time as it was a bit overpowering.  I cut the sun dried tomatoes down to 1/3 cup as others had suggested and added mushrooms to the recipe.  Everyone was impressed - not a morsel left for the next day!

I made this for a small dinner gathering.  I thought it was good, but not great.  If I made this again, I would add additional asiago.  It is one of my favorite cheeses and I thought the flavor of the asiago was lost in this dish.

I did what a lot of others did.  I increased the amount of asiago cheese to 1 cup and used 1/2 cream and 1/2 milk.  I made it for Valentine's Day and my boyfriend LOVED it....so did I.  The only thing I would do differently is maybe lessen the cheese the next time, as it may have been a little too "cheesey".  Regardless, it is a great recipe and I will definetly make it again.  My rewards on Valentine's Day were worth cooking!!!

This recipe was delicious!  I cooked it for my boyfriend on a special night, and he was amazed!  The sauce is so thick and creamy, and the ingredients compliment each other very nicely.  And the asiago cheese gives it a kick! I would recommend this recipe to anyone!

Very good.  I did as others and doubled the asiago and soak the sun dried tomatoes.  I also used 1/2 the heavy cream and 1/2 milk.  It turned out wonderful. Flavor was awesome.  Thank you.

OMG!  If you are looking for a recipe to wow  your friends for a dinner party, this is it!  Excellent!  The only change I will make next time is, instead of the sundried tomatoes, I will top with fresh diced up plum tomatoes at the end!  Everyone will ask for the recipe no doubt!

Excellent.  I did think it was a waste to throw away all that bacon grease though.  I figured if I was going to give us a heart attack anyway, I might as well just dump the butter into the bacon grease then go from there.  It turned out very nicely.

This was very good albeit very rich.   Next time I will cut the sundried tomatoes to ½ cup and substitute mushrooms for the bacon, just due to personal preferance.  I didn't put in as much green onions as it called for and I left out the red onion altogether - just didn't feel it was necessary.  I also put in more Asiago than what was called for - probably doubled it.  Because it's below zero outside, I used a cut up rotisserie chicken instead of grilled chicken and it was fabulous.  This is reminiscent of my favorite at the Olive Garden Restaurant, the portobella mushroom ravioli.  Next time I substituted some of the cream for milk and I like this better; not so heavy.

Way too much going on here!  You lose some of the flavors since there are so many.  The onions over-powered the dish in my families opinion.  Not worth the calories!!  I'm extremely surprised there are so many rave reviews!

Served this for a dinner party and it was wonderful.  I left out the chicken since it was a main dish, and added precooked bacon at the very end (to accomidate a vegetarian)...Also I added way more asiago cheese to the sauce in the first stage.

This tasted great!  Can't go wrong with bacon and asiago cheese, right? The only thing I changed was that I didn't add the last cup of cream.  It didn't look like it needed it and the consistency was fine without it.

This is soooo good!  I made it for a friend's birthday and everyone loved it. I made the cheese sauce the night before and had everything else ready to go so all I had to do was finish the sauce and cook the pasta.  Super easy!  Thanks!

Made this tonight. Good but not out of the ballpark great. I used a tri blend of asiago, romano and parmesan cheese. I used half and half instead of the heavy cream. I added some sliced roma tomatoes and fresh spinach. Added a few shakes of italian seasonings, salt and pepper. Thanks for the post!

I followed the advice of previous reviews and substituted 1 cup milk for 1 of the cups of heavy cream, increased the cheese to about a cup and halved the onions.  I thought the recipe was good, but not great.

A little bit heavy, but very good flavor!  There's a lot of chopping involved, so it's something that can be done as a group, where there are lots of helping hands.  I just made this for a dinner party and everyone LOVED it!  Definitely recommended!

This was good and not nearly as difficult to make as one might think with an excellent presentation. I made about 2/3 of the pasta and half the chicken, but made all the sauce, and it was just right...not dry, not too saucy. I had no Asiago (a true crime), so I used grated fresh Romano, and it was still good this way, but would have been better with the old, complex Asiago flavor. I too subbed half of the heavy cream with half and half with no problem. This recipe needs more garlic, maybe more chicken bouillion, and salt if you use a not-very-salty bacon. There is still something missing though. I hope someone figures it out and lets me know, because this has potential to be a PERFECT dish! I will make again and adjust the sauce to taste.

Very good flavor.  I thinned out the cornstarch with more than 1 T water after trying it as written and having cornstarch clumps form. Will definitely make this again. Would be good with mushrooms too.

I have posted before saying that I love this recipe.  I'll give some advice on changes I've made to this recipe:
1.  Always use the sundried tomatoes including the oil they are soaked in - gives it more flavor.
2.  Use a bunch more asiago cheese than is called for.  I put some in the pan when making the sauce, but also sprinkle some on top of the dish when I serve it.
3.  I use pre-cooked, real bacon bits to save time, but still enjoy the flavor.
4.  I don't use two types of onions - only vadillas.

Still one of my favorite recipes ever.

Good luck,

This was a wonderful recipe.  Although I couldn't find asiago cheese I substituted it with parmesan and added more.  I also added more semi sun dried tomatoes and it came out great.  Everyone loved it !

Very good! We really enjoyed this recipe. To make it vegetarian-friendly, I didn't use chicken or bacon. We substituted baby portabellas instead, which were delicious, and also added extra sun-dried tomatoes. We also used olive oil instead of butter (mainly for the taste). The flavor was great, and I will definitely make it again. It was also great with whole-wheat pasta!

I found this recipe to be excellent - a few things overlooked - but overall very good.  Note that you may want to increase your pasta quantity and the fact that this is a very heavy and rich recipe - but overall excellent.

delicious, but a lot of prep work! I added the sun dried tomatoes in the very beginning - I will make again - was good as leftovers as well.
