I must admit I made some changes and it was outstanding - rather than layer I combined the cheese, sour cream, curry powder and chutney and left in refrigerator overnight.  I spooned into dip dish and sprinkled with cashes and green onions.  I omitted the coconut as it was sweet enough.  It was a hit at my Thanksgiving dinner!  I was told to market it!!

It was amazing.  The only thing was I used half the coconut as I am not a fan of it but it went with the chutney perfectly, next time I will use more.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe.

This spread is a great blend of flavors that is easy and always goes over well.  I don’t care for onions so leave them out, but they’d make it more colorful.

I’ve been making something very similar for years. Definitely pre-mix the cream cheese and curry to blend flavors. I’ve always toasted my coconut, too. And use golden raisins. Always an unexpected hit!! Best crackers to go with are wheat thins. I’ve tried a variety!

This is an excellent recipe.  My picky kids even liked eating it.  For the Chutney, I was able to find a 12 oz jar.  The recipe called for an 8 oz jar.  I found using half of a 12 oz jar was sweet enough.  I highly recommend this!

Everyone gobbles this up. It's so easy and can be made earlier in the day. I use a little less coconut and toast it ~ brings out the yummy coconut flavour!

I was quite reluctant to make this dip because of what I thought were funky ingredients to put together. I could not have been more wrong! I doubled the ingredients to make enough for a 9x13 pan. I took it to an Indian themed party and it was nearly gone.  I served it with Pita chips. It is definitely my go to dip for now. Thanks Joanne!

Served this at a dinner party, and my guests promptly dubbed it "crack dip" because it was so addictive. Fabulous mix of flavors - super easy to prep.
