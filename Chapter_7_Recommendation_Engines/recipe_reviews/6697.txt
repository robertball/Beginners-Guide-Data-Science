(NOW WITH A LOW-FAT ALTERNATIVE!!) This recipe is GREAT!  I have made these several times now with a few modifications that make people come begging for more: I doubled the spices (if not more), used only 2 cups sugar, left out the walnuts and added about 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Lastly, instead of making bread, I made muffins...TO DIE FOR!!  In standard muffin cups the muffins take about 30 minutes to bake at 350.  With these changes, NOW it is a 5-star recipe!! EDITED TO ADD: I decided to try a LOW-FAT version of these and it turned out GREAT!  Adding to my previous modifications, I also substituted 1/2 of the oil for applesauce.  There was absolutely NO DIFFERENCE in taste or moistness.  No brainer, save the calories and fat!!

This bread is so easy to make, and even easier to eat! I used half a cup of applesauce w/ a half cup of oil, a heaping teaspoon of vanilla, a bit of extra pumkin, only 2 cups of sugar w/ a tsp. of brown sugar, & added a tsp. allspice to the mix. It turned out fabulous! Thank you V Monte, we also love your recipe for Zucchini Bread!

I added 3 TBS pumpkin pie spice, 2 tsp vanilla and 1 cup of pecans. The extra spice gave it wonderful flavor.

fabulous! very easy to make and quite delicious. its a bit too sweet for my tastes, so i suggest making it with a little less sugar, then using half brown sugar, half white. a little vanillia would also work well.

So Good and moist.  VERY EASY and delicious. I put everything in a bowl at once and mixed.  One Recipe made 4 mini loafs (40 minutes) and one 9X5 large loaf (1 hour)...very good!  ;)

I've tried different recipes for pumpkin bread.  This one is much more moist than the others. It is nice that it makes 3 loaves.  I made 2 large and 3 mini loaves.  The larges ones were done in exactly an hour.  I took the small ones out after about 45 minutes.  I added a little ground cloves and some vanilla for some extra flavor.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

YUM!  We used raisins instead of nuts as was suggested and it was very good.  We made the mistake of trying to do it all in one pan, which meant the very top didn't get cooked entirely and the edges were a little burnt.  Follow the directions- 3 7x3 as recommended.  Anyway, a wonderful recipe.  All three of us loved it.

Very good, although it didn't seem cooked enough at one hour.  The middle was still doughy.  Very flavorful.  May try again and add some pumpkin pie spice as recommended by another reviewer.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I used the recipe scaler and doubled this recipe.  It was extremely easy and very, very  good. I believe next time, I will add a little more cinnamon.  It was very good as it was, but I like a little stronger cinnamon flavor.  Also, I have a convection oven, I decreased heat to 325 and an hour was still a little too long.  Be sure to check it sooner if you have a convection oven.  You gotta try it!!!!!!

I've been making the same pumpkin bread for the last 40 years but today I felt like experimenting. I'm an experienced baker who generally can get a pretty good idea of what the finished product will be by reading the recipe. This recipe seemed to have all the right ingredients and proportions (albeit a little light on the spice, but I was still willing to give it a shot as written) so I have no idea what could have accounted for the fact that it just was not what I had expected or hoped for. I agree with other reviewers, particularly "MommyofFour," who found the bread "too moist, lacking in flavor, and almost eggy." Perhaps it's just a personal preference or perception.  Until I come across something better, I'll hang on to my good ol' recipe on the beat up recipe card I wrote out when I was a kid--so far it's still the best.

I questioned the amount of sugar and oil so I cut it down to 75% of what it called for and it was still too sweet and greasy.  The bread appeared saturated in oil when I cut it!  This recipe could easily be cut to 1/2 the amounts of sugar and oil and you would never miss it. If you like a really moist bread just add an individual size natural apple sauce for moisture and sweetness, if you like, instead of all that oil & sugar.

Love this recipe...  My changes: Replace water with Borbon, add 1/2 cup chocolate chips in addition to Walnuts and Pecans...  Living at 8000 ft, I bake it for 55 minutes (5 minutes less) and reduce the amount of basking soda to make sure it's moist

This is a winner. This is the first year in trying my bread making, and got nothing but rave reveiws.. I have relatives that don't favor pumpking, telling how good and moist this bread is.  Plain is Great! Nuts are better, and I use raisins which was fanominal. Thank you for sharing!

Yummy!  I made this totally fat free - cut recipe to 12 servings, used 1/2 c applesauce in place of oil and egg beaters instead of eggs.  Didn't use nuts and still tasted decadent.  Thanks a bunch!

Excellent! Very tasty bread. I used fresh squash (buttercup not butternut) which is REALLY sweet, so I cut the sugar down to 1 cup, and I like to use whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose white. It came out fabulously! Even my friend's 10-year-old who is pickier than you can imagine had 3 slices of it!

I made the low fat version and added half a bag of semi- sweet chocolate chips. I made muffins not loaves. Just make sure you use puffin liners if you use chocolate chips, or the chips may stick to the pan. I haven't ever had that happen but some say it's possible. Very awesome with chocolate chips!

It was really easy to make and so gooood. I divided the recipe in three to only make one loaf which I regret...I took it out about 5 to 10 minutes ago and its pretty much done. I sprinkled some confectioners sugar on it and it was perfect and I left out the nuts...I took it out about 10 minutes early and it was awsome...super moist!!

Absolutely delicious.  I reduced the oil to 3/4 c and added 1/4 c. yogurt and it was very moist.  I will adjust the proportions again next time to 1/2 oil and 1/2 yogurt.  Also, mixing the cinnamon and nutmeg into the wet ingredients intensifies the flavor.

After reading the prior reviews, I made some adjustments: for dry ingredients, I used 1 1/2 c whole wheat flour and 1 3/4 c white flour.  Decreased salt to 1 tsp and decreased sugar to 2 c.  I doubled the spices: 2 tsp nutmeg and 2 tsp cinnamon, added 1/4 tsp cloves and a few shakes of the McCormicks Chinese 5 spice (contains a mix of anise, cinnamon, star anise, cloves and ginger).  For wet ingredients, I used a generous 2 c of mashed baked sugar pie pumpkin (which I peeled and cubed, then baked covered with foil for~45 min a few days prior).  Increased the water to nearly 1 cup (since I used whole wheat flour which other reviewers said absorbs more water), and decreased to 1/3 c veg oil with 3/4 c vanilla yogurt.  Added 1 1/2 tsp vanilla. Mixed 1 cup large dark chocolate chips into 2 of the 3 loafs and omitted the walnuts.  I used 3 4x8" loaf pans, and cooked on convection at 325 for only 45-50 minutes. Pure perfection!  YUM!

I make muffins, instead of bread- 30 minutes at 350 is perfect. I also use a 1/2 recipe for everything to make about 1 muffin tin worth of muffins. I add more nuts than called for and dried cranberries, substitute 1/2 the veggie oil for applesauce, cut down the sugar to about 1 1/4 cups (for the 1/2 recipe), and add 1/3 tsp vanilla. These are delicious, moist, awesome muffins. Great for a snack or bfast with a smoothie.

I tweak this recipe so that its my very own but its a wonderful base recipe for a highly complimented holiday bread!  I have scores of people who ask for it every year. Hint: Use some whole wheat flour & some brown sugar instead of just white.

This is my favorite favorite favorite recipe!  I've made it so many times now.  The bread is so moist.  It makes a large amount, so usually, I make muffins and a loaf.  I use the pumpkin that comes in the can, and usually I use about a can and a half (15 oz can + almost half of another can).  I always add the light dry ingredients first, mix those up, then the sugar, stir that thoroughly, and then all the wet ingredients except the pumpkin.  I also beat the eggs before adding them.  Then I add the pumpkin last.  I think that helps to prevent having lumps of things in your bread.

Delicious and moist!  Couple modifications- I increased to 3t of cinnamon and decreased sugar to 1 cup brown and .5 cup white and they were plenty sweet!  My kids loved them!

I was hoping this would be the perfect pumpkin bread but, as with most pumpkin breads, it is just too sweet for me and also too oily.   Needs adjusting which I do constantly and also too much baking soda because we do not like that taste.  Sorry, too many adjustments to rate as it stands.   The basics are there if you want to play around with them.

This bread is absolutely delicious, I have made it many times and even made my family pumpkin lovers. I do substitute cashews in the recipe because my family likes it better. Thanks for sharing.

I used 2 Cups of sugar instead of 3 and spiced it up a bit more as the other reviews suggested. I also added 1/2 C more mini chocolate chips than called for. Excellent recipe! Everyone raved!

We made this today and it was yummy! We added pecans and doubled the nutmeg and cinnamon and added 1 teaspoon of cardamon. Instead of vegetable oil we used coconut oil, and we are a sugar-free house so we used 3/4 tsp of stevia. I also tried with a rice flour all purpose mix and it turned out great also. Thanks for sharing!

Beautiful bread!  I did, however, substitute 1-cup more pumpkin puree for the oil and used dates instead of walnuts (the basic composition of the bread remained the same with these substitutions)...perfectly moist, rose gorgeously, just wonderful!

I have made this pumpkin bread multiple times and in three different ways: plain, with walnuts, and with raisins.  And, I have made it with both fresh and canned pumpkin.  It is, in my never-to-be-humble opinion, the GREATEST pumpkin bread recipe on planet earth! Instead of three smaller pans (7"x3"), I use two regular sized loaf pans (5"x9").  This quick bread is a MUST for every baker's recipe file!

Giving this recipe 5 stars after following the suggestions of others...doubled the cinnamon and nutmeg, added 1/2 tsp allspice, 1/4 tsp cloves, used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar, and added 1 tsp vanilla.  Very tasty!

You can sub using the oil for applesauce in any recipe  It makes it  better for you than all that oil  or even 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce.

I just made this bread today and am replacing this recipe for the one I use to use.  Absolutely delicious.  I just used two 5x9 pans and got two beautiful loaves.  I did have to bake it 20 minutes longer but that is ok.  Very nice bread.  Thanks for the recipe.

WOW!!! So good!! I followed a suggestion and I used only two cups of sugar (1 white & one brown), 1/2 cup naturally sweetened applesauce for 1/2 cup of the oil, evaporated milk for the water and 2 tsps of pumpkin pie spice, a pinch of fresh nutmeg and cardamom. I also added an oatmeal streusel topping. AMAZING!!!  Would probably be great drizzled with a cream cheese icing. I made 2- 8" x 4" loaves.

Okay, so I made some healthy changes.  

First, I used entirely whole wheat flour.  I prefer to use King Arthur White Whole Wheat flour for most of my baked goods rather than the traditional whole wheat.  To be honest, I couldn't tell the difference.  I also subbed applesauce for half of the oil.  When substituting whole wheat flour for white, it's important to make sure not to skimp on moisture; the whole wheat absorbs more moisture, which can leave your baked goods dry.  I used extra-large eggs (all 4), and put a tiny bit more applesauce in, maybe a tablespoon or two.

As did most, I added more spices, and decreased the sugar.  I almost doubled the cinnamon and nutmeg, but also added about 1/4 teaspoon cloves and a sprinkle of ginger.  I used brown sugar, about 2 1/4 cups instead of 3.  I used raisins instead of nuts.

After all these changes, I got a moist, flavorful pumpkin bread that I would feel very comfortable giving away as gifts.  Healthy to boot; if one were so inclined, they could probably get away with making it with egg whites and Splenda too, hence making it very low-fat and sugar free.  Maybe I'll try that next time.

Moist and tasty. I used two 9x5 loaf pans and added 1tsp of ground cloves to the batter as well. I baked for 1 hour and it was perfect. I dusted the top with icing sugar for a little more sweetness. By itself its fragrant and mildly sweet, but still delicious!

The consensus in my home is "It's a keeper!".  I added aprx. 1/2 tsp. more cinnamon and 1/4 tsp more nutmeg along with aprx. 1 cup each of choc. & butterscotch chips while omitting the raisons as they are not a favorite.  They make great muffins and freeze well.  A good "make ahead" treat for the holidays!

I have made this pumpkin bread recipe two years in a row now.  I like the fact that it makes three loaves, and it is so easy to put together.  I made it this year with my Pre-K class and we shared the extra loaves with the staff of our school.  Everyone loved it and was very thankful that we shared it with them.  Even my little 3 & 4 year olds liked it.

This is my favorite recipe for moist pumpkin bread.  I follow recipe exactly with the exception of  adding 1/2 cup of raisins.  Sometimes, instead of raisins, I will add dried cranberries or chocolate chips. We especially like the orange flavored cranberries.  It is also good with a vanilla glaze or cream cheese.  Great recipe!

I made this recipe exactly as described except without the walnuts (didn't have any) and added raisins. It was delicious! My husband told me not to change a thing, except maybe to get walnuts next time. This was twice as good the next day. Thank  you!!

This was very good. I made this twice. The first time with the exact recipe, the second time with few minor changes.

I at least doubled(maybe tripled) the amount of spices and added less than 1 tsp of ginger powder also. 
I used 3 cups of fresh(microwaved pumpkin) and used 1/3 cup of water instead of 2/3 cup. 
Added a variety of dried fruit (dried apple, blueberry, rasin) and walnut and roasted almonds.

My coworkers loved it and asked for the recipe. I highly recommend making these minor changes.

I used this recipe for a brunch. It was a huge hit. It was very moist and flavorfull. I used the cimmamon + that  I got from Pampered chef. It would have been just as good with the nutmeg and cinnamon. I can't wait to make it again.

Mmm... Just had a fresh out of the oven slice, this recipe is great! I did add 3 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice, and 2 teaspoons of vanilla, and I think that really added to the flavor. Next time I would also use half brown sugar, instead of all white sugar.

This was the first time I every tried to make pumpkin bread and I was not dissapointed.  I did use about 1/2 cup raisans in just one of the loafs and next time I think I will put raisians in the whole batch.  Also used 1/2 oil 1/2 applesauce.  Very moist and delicious.  A keeper.

Very easy and yummy too!  I have been teaching my daughter to cook and this was perfect.   I did add less sugar, 2 1/2 cups.  And, I did add 1 teaspoon of ginger and 1/2 teaspoon of cloves.  Also, I didn't have walnuts on hand (I don't know how that happened) so I used pecans. This is definitely a do again recipe.

1 word described this recipe for me awesome! I just threw all the ingredients in a bowl, and into a bundt cake pan, for about an 1hr and 20mins.  It turned out wonderful! I had a similar recipe i had years ago, but had lost it.  This is it, next time I'm going to add chocolate chips! Thankyou for the wonderful recipe!

Made this with 16 oz of semi sweet chocolate chips added in. Even the batter was good. It took an hour and 15 minutes to bake in a loaf pan and a square cake pan.

This bread is awesome.  I made this today and substituted 1/2 oil and 1/2 of my homeade applesauce.  I used 1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice and 1 tsp. cinnamon.  I used 1 C. white sugar and 1 1/2 C. brown sugar.  I baked it 55 mins.  I didn't have many raisens so I tossed in some craisens too.  All I can say is YUMM!!!!  I'm sure the original recipe is great too.  Enjoy....

This is EXCELLENT bread! I made some tonight for my husband and I and it's splendid! It tastes very similar to Banana bread, minus the banana. That's great for us because my husband loves banana bread, but is allergic to bananas!   I didn't have a bread pan to make it in, so I used a bunt pan, and placed all the dough in the one pan. It worked out great, took 70 min to bake and now I have really pretty bread. :-P

To me, it seemed like this recipe had too much sugar and oil and not enough spices. So I made the following alterations: I replaced half of the oil for applesauce, decreased the sugar to 2 cups, doubled the spices, added 1/2 tsp. allspice, 1/2 tsp. cloves, 1 tsp. vanilla, and 1 cup raisons (no walnuts). It came out very moist and tasted great! It was a huge hit and I'll be using this recipe every holiday season from now on.

I really enjoyed this recipe- but i am giving it 4 stars for 2 reasons. The first is that the average can of pumpkin has slightly less then 2 cups of pumpkin in it- which makes it hard to make this recipe unless you open 2 cans. To solve this problem i used 1 can of pumpkin and a half cup of applesauce which worked just fine! The second reason why i only rated this a 4 star recipe is because i tasted the batter as written and thought it needed a  little more in the spice department- i added a small pinch of cloves and a bit of allspice. With these changes- i thought the bread came out great. I made them into muffins because i didnt want to wait an hour for bread to cook. I will make this again!

Excellent recipe!It baked well in three foil 3x8 pans from the grocery store.  Took a little longer than 60 minutes, more like 70-75 minutes.  Very good texture and melt in your mouth yummy.  My kids ate the sloces with butter, but I didn't.  It didn't need it.

Great recipe.  We used applesauce instead of oil.  Added raisins (instead of walnutes), and it was a winner!  Oh, and a little extra cinnamon. :)

Within a two day period I made an additional 2 batches of the bread.  For a total of 8 loafs.  However, on the last batch I used the small loaf pans.  This made 4 smaller loafs for individuals to used rather then two larger ones.

This was a great recipe.  I had never made pumpkin bread before, but it turned out great.  I did however add one teaspoon more cinnamon and used only 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 cup applesauce.

v monte: PLEASE thank your Mum for this fantastic recipe!!! For over 50 years, I've tried many pumpkin bread recipes and hated them all!Too dry, too sweet, too complicated. WHY I kept trying, I don't know. Made this without changes and it finally became the pumpkin bread of my dreams! Made them as jumbo muffins rather than loaf bread, simply to make commuting easier. Very moist, days after; rich pumpkin taste; super easy recipe...my half century quest has been solved! Passed it along to all my friends the very next day, I was that impressed. :)

Very good.  I used one cup chopped walnuts and one cup Craisins.  Next time I would rough-chop the Craisins.  When they plumped, some of them were a bit big.  I also used 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon as I bought some Saigon cinnamon and think it's really strong!  I made seven mini-loaves (about 3" x 5.75").

This was delicious! My picky husband & picky sons loved this. I only used 2 cups of sugar maybe less & used allspice & cinnamon but a ton of it. Oh & I used 1/2 a cup of oil & 1/2 cup of apple sauce instead of a whole cup of oil. It was so good & moist!!

This recipe is so delicious! The bread lasted maybe a week in my house. I followed the recipe with one exception, adding a teaspoon of vanilla extract. A few friends have actually asked me to make this for them, and I love the whole process of baking this bread. I want to make it all the time now!!

Great (large) recipe, and easy to make. My first time making pumpkin bread and it turned out just fine. I made the recipe into one loaf and two dozen muffins. I omitted the walnuts, as I'm allergic and used some chocolate chips and some raisins in my muffins. I also substituted half the oil for applesauce as other have suggested. Will definitely use this one again!

Never made pumpkin bread before in my entire life! I have always loved it buying it from stores and cafe's and buying it every time its in season. This is a very good recipe and it tastes amazing. Just be careful if you try to use a different size pan. I used a 5x9 and then used the rest in a bunt pan.

This was awesome! I added walnuts. I also changed the sugar to 2 1/2 cups of white and 1/2 cup brown. added 1 tsp of vanilla. I didn't have plain cinnamon so I just added about a tbsp of cinnamon sugar. And I also used a whole (15 ounce) can of pumpkin. I whisked it all together by hand. I baked it in a 9x5 1/2 for about 1hour and 20 minutes and it baked perfectly. I could only make two loaves with my size pan... but that could also be because me bf kept getting spoonfuls of the mix as the first one was baking...Will probably be makifn this for both of my thanksgivings this year. SUPER easy, quick and delicious! I think next time I will add a crumb for the top it would taste nice.

What a great recipe.  Minor changes as per the other reviewers.  2 c sugar (1c white and 1c brown).  1/2 c oil and 1/2 apple sauce.  2 tsp pumpkin spice in place of nutmeg.  kept the cinnamon.  Added 1 tsp vanilla.  1/2 wheat flour, 1/2 white.  Texture was wonderful.  I added pecans b/c thats what i had.  Thx for sharing the recipe.  I will definitely make again!

Delicious!  I did change a few things however.  I used half whole wheat flour instead of all white flour, half cup of apple sauce and half canola oil, reduced to 1 cup of splenda, half cup of brown sugar and half cup of white.  I also used 4 tsp. of pumpkin spice, 1 tsp. of cinnamon.  I used raisins and topped it off with a cream cheese icing.  I am in love with this bread!

Wow, I just pulled out the muffins and have already eaten 3.  They are awesome.  I did add some extra cinnamon and then about 1/2tsp of cloves and used some pie pumpkin I mashed back in November.  Did not have any nuts, but probably awesome with nuts and/or raisins.  I cooked them for 30minutes at 350.  They came out moist and tender.  Could not have asked for a better tasting pumpkin bread.  Thank you.

This is one of my desert-island recipes. My family gets upset if there's none on-hand in the mornings. I make a huge batch of it and freeze most of it in quart-sized bags. It thaws beautifully and one batch lasts weeks that way. 

I followed the advice of others: I substitute apple sauce for half the oil, and I double the spices. I also sometimes increase the amount of pumpkin if I double the recipe, because I don't want to waste the rest of the large can.

Can I give it ten stars?  
This pumpkin bread is delicious!!! I did use nuts and I added raisins, which made it so tasty!  It made 9 mini loaves, about 3"x6" aluminum loaf pans.  You will need to cut the bake time down a little.  Try this recipe!  Oh, also, I used fresh pumpkin!

I have made 6 loaves of this bread for my husband. He absolutely LOVED them. He even took it to work and one of the guys said he'd pay for a loaf!! So I've sent a couple as gifts. This recipe is definitely worth a try.

Whoa! This was UNbelievable. I made all the suggested changes: 2c sugar instead of 3, double spices, and 1/2c oil plus 1/2c applesauce. This was so dense and SO moist! No one would ever know it lacked a cup of sugar and half the oil! Like a dessert more than a bread.

Fantastic recipe - so moist! I skipped the walnuts and used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon and nutmeg. I made them this time as muffins - only needed 30 min in the oven. Leftover baked squash works well instead of pumpkin too.

The only thing I changed was cutting the nutmeg in half and then adding 1/2 tsp of ground cloves as well.  Everyone loved it so much at Thanksgiving I wound up making a loaf for each of my family members for Christmas.  I will definitely keep this around for years to come!

I cut this recipe in half and put it in my bread machine so that I could leave and come home to yummy pumpkin bread.  Wow, it was delicious!   I did make two alterations though, I put in a teaspoon of vanilla (for 1/2 the recipe) and I used 1/2 of the white sugar the recipe called for and substituted the other 1/2 with brown sugar.  Everyone here just gobbled it up. I definitely plan on making this bread again and again, and maybe adding some raisins, nuts, chopped dates and cranberries.  But even without all of the extra goodies, this bread is great.

This was a fabulous recipe.  I didn't make the bread and made it into cupcakes instead.  I also halved the oil, used 1/2 cup cinnamon applesauce in place of it, used double the nutmet and cinnamon. I also added crumbs on top and baned until knife came out clean. Great recipe monte!  thanks!

Way good bread! I made it with all applesauce instead of oil, a little pumpkin pie spice, and 5 egg whites. Mine was done faster than called for...so check it early.

I like this recipe, because it is versatile. I scaled it down to one loaf. To make it more diet-friendly, I used 1/2 c. applesauce and 1/3 c. veg. oil.  I also used 1/3 c. of Splenda-sugar blend instead of the sugar, and I used just one egg.  I add 1/2 c. of chopped pecans and 1/2 c. of baking raisins, because I like my breads to have different textures and flavors.  I increased the spices as well. The end result was fantastic. Divided into 18 servings, my bread has about 125 calories per slice.

Received great reviews from home and work.  I used 1/2 a cup of nuts and 1/2 a cup of raisins.  The mix was nice using both.  I also dusted the pans with sugar instead of flour.

I have used this recipe several times, usually without nuts, and once with chocolate chips instead (which the kids LOVED). I use about half the salt called for in the recipe and still get great results.  
Also, if you chill it overnight so the flavors can meld, it gives the bread a slightly stronger "pumpkin" flavor--just wonderful! I've also found that this bread freezes well. Makes a great gift!

This recipe is fantastic!  The only thing I changed because of my family's tastes, is I tripled the cinnamon and added 2 tbls of vanilla.

Love it!

This recipe is definitely a "keeper".  I did make a couple changes.  For spices, I used 1 1/2 t. pumpkin pie spice (pps) and 1 1/2 t. cinnamon.  I also used 1 c. raisins. Next time I think I'll use 2 t. pps.

it was great, but we made some changes:
instead of all purpose flour we used whole wheat flour, Instead of 1 cup of oil we used 1/2 cup of applesauce and 1/2 cup of oil, we only used 2 cups of sugar, and we put 1/2 cup of cloves in it. After that, it was a 5 star recipe!!!

Excellent recipe. The first time I split this into 1/3 to make one loaf and it worked well. I used fresh pumpkin puree and no raisins. It was excellent and I plan to make this one for a second time this season.

First off, let me reiterate the advice of others, use 2 cups of sugar, one white and one brown. Also, I also liked the advice to increase the spices. (Mine totaled 2 TBSP once I finished of cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg.) 

Just a word of warning, don't put too much stuff into this wonderful bread or you will miss the good pumpkin flavor. On one batch I added craisins, nuts and chocolate chips. It was just too much and overpowered the subtle sweetness of the bread, but as the mistake was my own, it didn't affect my rating. ENJOY!

I use this recipe every fall, and everyone loves it. Comes out perfectly every time. I make always make muffins with it. The only change is that they only need to bake for 20 minutes or so. I've also topped them with cream cheese frosting for pumpkin cupcakes.

This was great! I doubled the spices, but left everything else the same. My children lovvvved this too. Since there is quite a bit of sugar in this, I'm going to try replacing some of the sugar with applesauce next time. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This bread was moist and delicious!! It was a hit in my household, I will definitely be making this again!! The only thing I will do differently next time is add 1 cup of walnuts instead of the 1/2 cup the recipe called for. Two thumbs up!!

This bread is awesome! I made it for my husband to take to work for a treat and it was gone within 2 hours of him arriving to work. Nothing but raves! I opted for the raisins instead of the nuts because of a personal preference, but am betting it would be good with either/or...or even both! Thank you for sharing this recipe, I will definitely be making it again this fall.

The pumpkin bread batter was enough for 1 large loaf pan and 1 8 x 8 square pan.  Just kept checking until the batter no longer clung to the tooth pick.  So moist and so tasting like Autumn.

Follow this recipie to the T. It is delicious and if you wrap it, with saran wrap, about 5 minutes after taking it out of the oven it is super moist! My kids and husband wolfed it down and were asking when I would be making it again.

Per the recommendation of another reviewer, I added about 2 tsp (I think?) of vanilla. This was such an easy & tasy recipe...I loved it!  The bread was very most.  I added about 1tsp extra cinnamon & sugar to the top of the bread after I got it out of the oven.  I will make this again!!!

This is a great recipe!  Moist and tasty.  You can use any substitute for the pumpkin, I have used canned pumpkin pie mix, canned yams and bananas.  They all came out terrific!  Next time I use bananas I am going to put chocolate chips in it, yum!

I am not a pumpkin fan but this bread was good.  I used half wheat/half white flour, used half applesauce/half oil, cut the sugar to 2C & also added chocolate chips.  My daughter loves it!

I couldn't decide between 4 and 5 stars - if there were a 4 1/2 that would be it! I followed the recipe to the T except for the fact that I had no nutmeg so I doubled the cinnamon and added a pinch of ginger. I made only 12 servings (muffins) and baked for approx 30 min. They came out moist and flavorful.

As per other's advice, I used almost 1/2 cup oil 1/2 cup applesauce with some flaxseed.  I used only 2 cups of sugar (1 white, 1 brown).  I doubled the spices and added allspice and vanilla as well (1 tsp as well). I used 1/2 cup of raisins.  It made 1 loaf and 18 muffins. Loaf I baked for 60, muffins I baked for 30 mins ~ all at 350F.  It turned out very well - could use a bit more raisins - next time I would use 3/4 of a cup of raisins instead of 1/2.  I would definitely make it again ~ very flavourful and not very unhealthy after the adjustments.

Really liked this.  Did as others suggested - cut sugar down, subbed applesauce for oil, increased spices.  Great flavor and texture.  I cooked this in 2 large loaf pans rather than 3 small, and it didn't cook all the way. I think I had it in for about 15-20 minutes extra, but I didn't set a timer so I'm not quite sure! Will try again and update.

I do not like pumpkin. I had a can that someone gave to me, so I tried this recipe. All I can say in YUM!!!! I baked this in 2 cast iron bread pans and it was perfect. I topped it off with a cream cheese frosting. My husband won't leave it alone.  I have found a favorite recipe. Thanks!

Good recipe...put 1/2 cup oil and pureed 3/4 of an Asian pear to make up the other 1/2 cup.  Canned pumpkin was 15 ounces so I put about 1/2 cup of sour cream too.  Very moist.

Not the best pumpkin bread I've ever made.  It was very sweet.  I doubled the spices, so that was good.  The texture was good, very moist.  But it wasn't very pumpkiny.  If I made it again, I would definitely add more pumpkin.

Excellent recipe! I made this today for some friends coming over to watch the big game, and it turned out fantastic! Everyone loved the bread and it was gone in a flash! I used 1/2 c. oil and 1/2 c. applesauce per the recommendations from other reviews -- very moist and delicious flavor.

This was really good, I was pleased with the results. I did make quite a few changes though. Like other reviewers I used half applesauce and half oil, I only used two cups of sugar and used half whole wheat, half all-purpose flour. In addition to that I also added some more spices, 1/2 tsp cloves and 1 tsp allspice. I didn't have any 7x3 pans so I just poured the whole thing into a 9x3 pan and baked it at 335 degrees for about 1hr and 20 minutes. It was huge but very yummy!

I made this bread for my family post Christmas.  Everyone loved it.  I followed the recipe and it turned out very moist.  Very good and great texture.  I will be making this bread again this very week.  Next year I will make it with real pumpkin pulp.

One recipe made 8 mini loaves, which I am giving away for the holidays.  I baked the loaves for 40 minutes and they came out perfect -- moist and delicious.  For spices, I made the following adjustments: 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp cloves, and 1/2 tsp allspice.  I also added 1 tsp vanilla and used raisins instead of nuts.  Next time, I will definitely use more than 1/2 cup raisins.  The recipe is so large that 1/2 cup raisins doesn't go very far.  But overall, this was a really easy recipe and I will make it again.

Excellent! Just perfect taste all around. Let me say, this recipe is wonderful whether you take all the extra advice about spices or not. I've made it more times than I can count and we all love it both ways.

This recipe was awesome! I had had some trouble in the past with some pumpkin and banana bread recipes I tried, they always turned out too dry or too dense. 

But not this one! It was perfact! Moist and fluffy. And I love that I already had everything I needed to make this at my apartment. 

The only thing I changed was adding two over ripe mashed bananas, some extra pumpkin spice and I used two cups of white sugar and one cup of brown.

I defiantly recommend. I know I'll be making it again!

A very flexible recipe. I used 1/2 the oil and added applesauce for the other half. I also not only added the nuts, but also added about 1 cup of cranberries. It turned out great!

Made it exactly according to the recipe, except no nuts.  It was very moist and tasty.  My husband loved it.

I only made 1/2 the recipe and put it in a 9x3 pan.  I baked it at 325 degrees to make sure the center cooked.

Awesome! Won't try any other pumpkin bread recipes now that I've found this one. The only changes I made were: substituting 1 cup of white sugar for loosely packed brown sugar and closer to a cup of walnuts, rather than the 1/2 c called for. I just thought with that much batter, the 1/2 cup wasn't enough. I used to 9x9 loaf pans. I used one that was the dark non stick kind, and that was fine baking for just 1 hour, but my other pan was a glass pan, and it took closer to an hour and 10 minutes.

Delicious for sure and a big hit with my friends for a pot luck brunch. I made it with brown sugar instead of white and with walnuts. The bread is so moist and the flavor is great.

Great Recipe.  I had to use 1 c. brown sugar and 2 c. granulated because I ran out of granulated sugar.  I also used whole wheat pastry flour for 1/2 of the flour.

Excellent and easy to make. Really tasty and moist. I added some chopped dates along with the nuts. Will make again. Everyone asked me to make more. This year I am planning on trying with whole wheat flour and Splenda baking blend on one batch and adding chocolate chips to another batch. I have been using this recipe for many years now and it is the best.

Very delicious! I used 1/2 wheat and 1/2 white flour, used 3/4 cup cranberries instead of nuts, and added 1/4 cup brown sugar (which is a bit too much, next time I will cut the white sugar by 1 cup and add 1/2 cup brown sugar), plus 2 tsp vanilla.  Recipe produced 5 mini loaves (5x3) at 40 min and 3 muffins for us to have right away.

This recipe was easy enough to make, but I found it lacking. I don't know if it was the recipe or the pumpkins from my garden. I found it not sweet enough, I may make again, but next time around add more sugar. I think it is worth trying, from the other reviews I gather it is good, so maybe it was something I did or did not do.

This recipe was basically good. I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and reduced the amount of sugar to a little over 2 cups and added 2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice. In the end, I wish I had left all of the sugar and added that extra tsp. of pumpkin pie spice. It turned out well enough that I'll try to make it again.

This is the best pumpkin bread ever! I have made this same recipe for years and then ran across it on this website. I added 1/2 c of applesauce, like others suggested, and 3 heaping teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice and a dash of vanilla. This is a keeper.   It is the very best!

Before making this, I read some of the other comments about this recipe being too moist, so I left out the water. I also halved the recipe.  It still took a little longer than an hour to fully bake, so I had to cover it with foil so it wouldn't burn. This was my first time making this recipe, but it turned out really well in the end! Perfectly moist and pumpkin-y.

I love this recipe. My mom gave it to me years ago.  I don´t use any salt and in place of the spices in the recipe I use 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice +2 teaspoons cinnamon. The flour is increased to 3 1/2 cups plus 1 cup raisins instead of walnuts.It makes a lot and to avoid the raw dough in the middle, I only fill each of the two large loaf pans with  2 1/2 cups of the batter  and make up 18 muffins using the rest of it.

Used applesauce instead of oil, and used fresh pumpkin. The flavor was just ok, and the crust was tough and chewy, resembling a bagel.

This bread comes out lovely and moist. You can change up the additions and it still tastes wonderful. I have tried adding banana in place of the pumpkin. I also love to throw in walnuts and chocolate chips. The possibilities are endless with this delicious and easy pumpkin bread recipe.

OMG delicious is right. I left out the nuts and the allspice & used fresh pumpkin. There was none leftover. Thanks for posting.

I love this recipe... using fresh or canned pumpkin.  It also makes up into muffins or mini-loaves, just reduce the baking time to ~30 minutes. Great for gifts.  I use pecans though.  ;)

Very good!  My 7 year old loved it. I added vanilla, doubled the cinnamon and added cloves.  I also baked 16 mini loaves (probably the size of two cupcakes each) at 32 minutes.  I used pie pumpkins.  I baked seeded halves face down in water before pureeing like I cook other squash.

Delicious. The only change I made was to use pecans instead of walnuts. I made 4 mini-loaves and 1 small loaf (7x3 inch pan) from recipe. Four gifts and a  loaf for family. Perfect amount.

Decreased suger to 2 1/4 c, increased cinnamon, and slightly decreased nutmeg... This was SO good!  I can't imagine how sweet it would be with 3 c, but decreased it was wondeful, sweet, but not over-poweringly sweet.  Just what I wanted to "toast" for the baby.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

I like this recipe b/c it's easy and uses common ingredients. I modified it quite a bit, though to make it a little more healthy. 3 1/4 cups Organic Wheat Flour 2 tsp baking soda (forgot the nutmeg and cinnamon) 15oz can of Organic pumpkin (Trader Joes) 1/4 cup ground Flax Seed (meal) 1/3 cup Grapeseed oil 1 1/2 tsp sea salt 3 cups Organic brown sugar 2/3 cup Organic rice milk 3 organic, range free eggs With this I made 2 loafs in standard size bread pans. I used an olive oil spray and organic wheat flour on the pans to prevent sticking. I also made two glazes, one for each loaf, to experiment.  One was a simple Organic powdered sugar and rice milk mixture.  The other was a unique glaze that I envision using frequently in the future for various toppings:  Abuelita Granulado powder and Organic rice milk.  If you're not familiar with Abuelita, it is a Mexican hot chocolate made by Nestle Mexico and has a unique chocolate/cinnamon flavor.  The "Granulado" version is new (as of July 2009) and should be able to be found at any store that has a Hispanic aisle or section.  The glaze was a hit with the family and I was quite pleased with the result.  I highly recommend it.  For about 6 tsp of sugar or Abuelita Granulado powder, use 1 tsp of milk or water.  Make sure to mash or sift the powder to break up all hardness.  Drizzle over top of loaves.

I cut this recipe in half and made one small loaf and a giant muffin.  I combined others' suggestions such as using some brown sugar in place of the white sugar and I substituted pumpkin pie spice for the nutmeg and used extra cinnamon.  It is very good bread!

I took the following suggestions made by other reviewers: muffins instead of bread, 325 degree convection oven, 1/2 applesauce & 1/2 oil, 1 teaspoon of vanilla, double the spices and 2 cups of sugar (1 cup white, 1/2 dark brown, 1/2 cup light brown).  In addition I substituted a blend of whole wheat and white flour (1 1/2 cups whole wheat and 1 3/4 cups white four).  I also supplemented 1/2 nuts with 1/2 cup raisins.  For the water I used 1/3 cup vanilla flavored seltzer and 1/3 cup plain water.   The results were delicious.  Thanks for providing the recipe and inspiration.

The best, hands down. Made if for years and it never gets old. For an extra kick you can add peanut butter chips. Yum!   To make it as muffins, bake 21-23 min.

I tried to make a "clean eating" version of this recipe; I think the pumpkin flavor was milder but it was still really tasty.  For the flour, I did 1-1/2 C. wheat and 1-3/4 C. white; for the vegetable oil I used 1/2 C. applesauce (thanks other reviewers!) and 1-1/2 C. flaxseed meal; for the sugar, 2 C. of sucanat and a tsp. of brown sugar; I also added a tsp. of vanilla, a tsp. of pumpkin pie spice, and a dash of cloves and a dash of cardamom. I left the eggs alone, as I wasn't sure how to change them. I'd maybe even add more spices next time, and not use the flaxseed meal to get a more "traditional" taste. Also I cheated and added chocolate chips to tempt my husband! All in all very good!!

Holy moly, that is good bread. I combined many of the suggestions given by previous reviewers and thought a summary might be helpful here: instead of the spice suggested, I added 3 tbsp pumpkin pie spice (which I made vs bought), 1/2 tsp cloves, 1 generous tsp vanilla, used half oil/half applesauce, reduced white sugar to approx 1 3/4 cups and added approx 2/3 cups of brown sugar, and added 1 generous cup of chocolate chips.

Absolutely fabulous!  I used only 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar; also, substituted applesauce for 1/2 of the oil.  Still very sweet and did not affect the moistness of the bread at all.  Will make this again and again - plain, with walnuts, and with raisins.

I give it 5 stars with these changes:  I used 1-1/2 cups of whole wheat flour and 1-3/4 white flour, added 1/2 teas. more cinnamon, also added another 1/2-1 cup pumpkin,  only used 1/2 cup oil but added 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce, I don't like bread so sweet so only used 2 cups sugar and finally I added 2 teas. vanilla.  I'm the kind of cook that hardly ever follows a recipe exactly, but never the less this is a great basic recipe to go from.

Amazing. WOW. This is the best bread recipe period. YOU MUST TRY THIS. I used only 1c sugar and 1c brown sugar instead of 3c sugar. I used 1/2c oil and 1/2c applesauce instead of 1c oil. I added more cinnamon and cut out the ginger because i didn't have any. I melted a little butter and mixed it with a little brown sugar and when the bread was out of the oven, i poked holes all over and poured the butter mix all over. YUM.

I would give this 10 stars if I could.  It is really good and really easy.  I cut the recipe in half, doubled the spices (used cinnamon sugar instead of cinnamon because that's all I had), added 1 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp. allspice, used only 2 cups of sugar, and substituted apple sauce for 1/2 of the oil.  I didn't blend in the walnuts until the rest of the batter was well-mixed so that they would not get too crumbled.  I made 1 loaf out of this half-recipe (bought an 11 inch loaf pan) and used convention bake at 350 for 35 minutes.  Perfect!

Decreased the sugar to 2 cups and added only 1/2 canola oil and 1/2 cup apple butter.  Turned out great.  I also added chopped pecans to one loaf,  chocolate chips to another and fresh cranberries to another.  Fabulous!!!!  I don't think I used the right size pans but it still tasted great.  May cut back on the time to 50-55 mins.  Great recipe!!!  Thanks!

I loved this bread.  I wanted to use applesauce to cut the fat but I ran out :-(  I did use 1/2 cup raisins and I doubled up on the nutmeg and cinnamon (2 teas each)...This recipe was so easy and I used fresh pumpkin which I pureed by baking two halves at 350 for 90 minutes and then used my hand mixer to get it smooth.  My pumpkin made 4 cups so I can't wait to make the next batch of the DELICIOUS bread.

I made this for my office and got RAVE reviews! It was so EASY to make, its virtually fool-proof! I did use dried cranberries instead of nuts, and I think I'll use apple sauce instead of oil next time. But those are my own prefrences. This is AMAZING just as it is!

My husband loved this bread.  I used applesauce in place of the oil.  I didn't add nuts, but I made one loaf with chocolate chips (kids favorite), another with craisins (my favorite) and another just plain (husbands favorite).  Very versitle and delicious.

I made some changes to increase flavor, as suggested by other reviewers: used 3 Tbsp pumpkin pie spice and 2 tsp vanilla extract, decreased sugar to 1 cup white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar. Made one batch with 1 cup raisins, another batch with 1/2 cup mini choc. chips. Both were delicious! To make it more healthy: used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, used half unsweetened applesauce/half oil, used baking and brown sugar Splenda instead of regular white and brown sugar. You can't even taste the difference!

Very tasty! I followed except for 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice and only 2 cups sugar.  I left out nuts. I made one loaf and then added choc chips for muffins. Muffins cooked up in 20 minutes for me. Yum!

All I can say is WOW! I was in a random pumpkin bread mood this afternoon and this recipe totally hit the spot. It was absolutely perfect, even though I goofed a little bit and added too much flour. I think I'll try it with more spice next time. Thank you!

I made this bread I dont know what I did wrong it came out to moist I like for bread not be to dry or to moist. I added everything except the nuts. I dont know if I just did not cook it long enough or what but I was a little dissappointed this was not my first time baking anything either I have baked many good recipes.

I made this and brought it to work and it was gone in 10 minutes!  I gave it as a gift to my friend Ann at Christmas time. Since then, she has made at least 6 loaves to give away.  I cannot get enough of this bread.  So moist!

Followed this recipe---almost exactly.
I used pecans instead of walnuts.
I used 2 9x5 loaf pans and 2 12count mini muffin pans.  To prep my pans, I used pam, then a mix of flour and sugar coat.

Other than that...the recipe was followed as written.
I was impressed. The bread was moist and tasty.  My husband, who normally does not like "sweet breads" thought it was great!
I'm putting this one in my recipe box!

Great recipe. I was able to fit the batter into two loaf pans.  I substituted 1/2 the oil with applesauce as others suggested, and I chopped some fresh cranberries and put that in.

This is a great recipe. I think it's the oil that makes it so moist. Will try subbing applesauce for part of the oil next time, as other reviewers suggested -- just to make it more healthy. I used only 2 C sugar, and about 1/4 c brown sugar, plenty sweet. Also used 2 1/2 T pumpkin spice instead of the other spices called for. I made one loaf, and about 20 muffins, cooking them for about 25 mins. I added 1 c chocolate chips because we like them. Thanks for another good one!

Wow! I made this recipe when I was expecting company. I made the 3 loaves each a little different; one with golden rasins, one with cranberries and one with chopped pecans. (I made the batter and once they were in the pans, I sprinkled these ingredients evenly and mixed them in lightly so they would be inside and not on top). I had pureed butternut squash in my freezer already measured to 2 cups, so I gave it a try in place of the pumpkin---nobody knew! I did add 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice, 1/2 cup oil with 1/2 cup applesauce, and 1 1/2 cups white sugar. Even with my alterations, my week long company couldn't get enough! They would pull it from the fridge every chance they had! If you have some homemade apple butter to put on this for breakfast...it is supurb! Even plain, warm or cold, a definite keeper! :-)

Excellent!  I used 1/2 cup melted butter plus 1/2 cup veg. oil and evaporated milk instead of water to make it richer.  Added 1/2 tsp Allspice, a pinch more nutmeg.  Everything else exactly by the recipe. Definitely a keeper!

Everyone LOVED these! I used part wheat flour, half apple sauce for the oil and half brown sugar instead of all white. Delicious. Next time I might not add quite as much sugar because they were very sweet. That isn't bad, but I just want to see if I can get by with using less.

this was an excellent recipe when you want you don't have much time and want something yummy! I accidently picked up pumpkin pie MIX instead of puree at the store and I was really glad I did. I used the spices as suggested and it was delicious. I like that it made 3  nice loaves..I kept one  for my family, took one to work and gave one to my son and his fiancee. 
One thing for sure it gets better the next day... REALLY moist!

Agree.  Very good.  Added cranraisins instead of any nuts.  Very tasty.  Also made in both large and small loaf pans - equally good in both.

Followed the recipe exactly and this bread was both flavorful and very moist. I'll try some walnuts with the mix next time. An excellent addition to my bread box recipes.

i made this as posted. i toasted the nuts for 10 minutes first before chopping. i used pecans...didn't have any walnuts. added a teaspoon or so vanilla. made one large 9x5 loaf, baked 1 hour 10 minutesand 24 mini muffins at 40 minutes. i filled the loaf pan 3/4 full and it rose well above th rim. everyone commented oh how moist the bread was. i won't make the mini muffins again. i must go buy another loaf pan. i think it will easily make two 9x5 loafs.

Really a great recipe. I did as others and changed it around a bit.  I added cloves and vanilla, I also subbed 1/2 c ff vanilla yogurt and 1/2 cup oil.  I also used splenda instead of regular sugar.  I used only 3 eggs. It seems to be a pretty versatile recipe to use.  Thanks so much.

I substituted 1/2 cup applesause for  half the oil, added about a 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and reduced the sugar to 2 1/4 cups (just couldn't bring myself to add 3 cups sugar!). I made 4 mini loaves and 12 muffins. The texture is great, but I think a teaspoon or so pumpkin pie spice would have helped the flavor. I did not find the taste eggy at all as others had mentioned. As with most quick breads, the flavor was much better the day after I baked it. Overall great recipe. I love that is was quick and easy and made a lot of bread. I will make it again.

VERY GOOD!!! made 24 muffins out of it and still had some left over. I made half of them as the recipe says and then added raisins to the other half. My only regret is not putting raisins in the whole thind. I did cut back about 1/2 cup of sugar and added some allspice and extra cinnamon!!!! oberall great recipie.will def make again.

Okay 1st, let me start out by saying, I bake ALOT.  I do not consider myself in the same league as a Professional Baker, however, I do know my way in the kitchen very well.  That being said, I was very disappointed with this recipe.  The bread was waaaaay to moist for my taste and even with me adding extra cinammon, nutmeg, cloves, vanilla & allspice, this still left more to be desired.  It tasted like bread with a light pumpkin flavor, to be honest.  Plus, like another reviewer said, it had a very "eggy" taste to it.  I like a more bold spicy (cinamon spicy) flavor in my pumpkin bread.  Sorry, this recipe didn't do it for me...

I see why it's named "delicious pumpkin bread".  It's so easy to make and so good to eat!  I only used 2 loaf pans so I had to increase the baking time.  First I put it back in for 10 mins then covered the pans and did another 8 minutes --- PERFECT!!!!

This is the best pumpkin bread I've ever had, BUT I made a lot of changes to the recipe. I havled the sugar amount because the sugar-to-flour ratio is way too high, especially for bread. Even then it was a little too sweet. 

I also had too cut down on the wet ingredients to offset the removal of the sugar. I halved the oil-- a whole cup seemed like way too much anyway-- and used only 3 eggs (the recipe also seemed to call for too many of those).

And of course I upped the cinnamon and nutmeg amount. I always do that. 

I baked the batter in 4 mini loaf pans, and the results were beautiful and delicious. The texture and consistency of this bread is amazing! 

I'm going to try freezing a loaf to give to my boyfriend next time I see him. I thnk this bread will freeze extremely well!

My friend gave me this recipe to try, and I have to say, it's my new favorite!  I made the recipe with both fresh and canned pumpkin (with the fresh we omitted the water) They were Fantastic!  I made muffins instead of the bread. I shared them with friends who also agreed they were awesome.

This pumpkin bread was very good, my kids loved it. Scaled down recipe to 12 servings and baked in a loaf pan for 45 minutes, very moist.  My 11 yr old daughter made this by herself.

This is sooooooooo good! I used mostly splenda in place of sugar,used only 1 cup of sugar, and 2 cups splenda. I used cloves and ginger too. I healthed it up a little by using one half whole wheat flour and the rest white. Thanks I had had bread like this before but couldn't come across the recipe.

Excellent, moist bread.  I added a 1/2 c. of applesauce, since most solid pack cans of pumpkin are now 1 3/4 c. rather than 2 c.  Also added 1/2 c. of raisins soaked in water & cinnamon for 1 hour before making the bread (thanks to whoever had that idea here!)  Rave reviews from my family!

Excellent! I didn't have smaller pans so I made 2 large loaves and baked them for 1 hour 20 min. I also added an extra dash of cinnamon and ginger. The bread came out extremely moist. Everyone loved it and asked to take the leftovers home with them.

I have been making this exact recipe for 35 years! lol I don't remember where I got it but it is the best and this time I am going to try the less sugar and less oil for applesauce. I am using fresh roasted pumpkin that I puree. I am going to add spiced Capt. Morgan Rum for half the water....maybe all the water. Will see how it smells while mixing. Will let you all know if it flies or not. If not I am gonna make myself a hot buttered rum and settle in front of the fire! Wow add all Rum for the water! I increased all spices to 2 tsp. adding cloves, allspice,ginger and 2 tsp. vanilla.I always cream my sugars and eggs, oil & applesauce then add dry ingred. a bit at a time just till mixed.I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 dark brown! It is sooo good! Am gonna make muffins next with the semi-sweet choc chips! Thanks for all your ideas! Try the rum.....OMG! Amazing! Wonder what would happen using apple cider! Someone try it and let us know. Happy Holidays!

This bread is delicious and moist. I do not consider myself an experiences "baker," but was able to make this successfully. After reading other reviews, I modified the recipe by using only 2c sugar and 1c semi-sweet chocolate chips. I also added 1/2tsp extra nutmeg and 1/2tsp extra cinnamon. The bread does have a strong nutmeg taste but I love it. If you don't particularly love nutmeg, stick to the original recipe. I can't stop eating this bread - will definitely make again.

This bread is VERY yummy and extremely moist. I tweaked the recipe ever so slightly and it was fabulous! I also added a bit of quick oats and cinnamon/sugar mixture on the top to give it a really great finish and it made it look pretty too! Here is the receipe I used below:
Delicious, Moist Pumpkin Bread

3 ½ cups Flour
3 cups White sugar
2 tsp. baking soda
1 ½ tsp salt
2 tsp. Ground nutmeg
2 tsp. ground cinnamon
2 cups solid packed pumpkin puree (I used 1 large can pumpkin – about 3 cups)
2/3 cup water
1 cup vegetable oil
4 eggs
½ cup walnuts (optional – I did not use)
¼ c. quick oats (optional)
Cinnamon/sugar mixture (optional)

Directions:
1.Grease and flour pans you want to use (I only greased…worked fine)

Incredible.  Love this bread.  My wife had a package of pumpkin seeds with dried cranberries sitting the fridge left over from one of those salad packages.  I used that instead of the walnuts.  Turned out great.
Thanks for the post.

I used real pumpkin (my Halloween pumpkin that was baked and pulp removed) instead of canned and it was a winner.  I've made two batches (three loaves) in two weeks and they are eaten already.

Like others, I replaced half the oil with sugar free applesauce - great. Also I used fresh, boiled pumpkin instead of canned, and so I omitted the extra water (since the pumpkin was so wet) and also used probably 3 cups total. Used chocolate chips too.

Based on my experience with the Banana Banana Bread recipe, I adjusted the oven temp to 325* - again, the bread turned out moist through and through.  The only other adjustment I made was to use 1 3/4C white sugar and 1C light brown sugar.  I would have switched out the oil for applesauce, but I didn't have any on hand...next time I'll use applesauce.  Husband is raving about this bread.  I guess it is one of my new regular recipes.  :)  And I will, most assuredly, be making gift loaves for the holidays.  YUMMY!!!

This was the BEST bread I've ever made! I added pumpkin seeds and diced fresh dates. I also used 1 and 3/4 cups coconut sugar in place of the 2 and 1/4 cup white sugar.  It was sensational!

This is the first time i made pumkin bread i have made other types. The first thing that should be addressed is what kind of pumkin puree to use. Theres 100% natural , then theres pumkin thats ready for pumkin pie puree. When buying punkin at the store it doesnt say solid pack or anything like that. So i have the stuff thats ready for pumkin pie I couldnt understand the reason for water as its pretty runny and after reading the reviews some said it didnt have enough flavour . So i took a thirty oz can and cut out the water lowered the oil to 3/4's and added 4 cups of flower instead. I didnt add much more spice to it just a teaspoon of pumkin spice oh and took off one egg as well .. and only put in 2 cups of sugar..  came out perfect . loads of pumkin flavour not too sweet pretty much a whole different recipe as how i did it tho.  I couldnt understand the reason for no brown sugar but if I were to use the natural pumkin i would definitly use brown sugar in it.

This is a great recipe! My family loved it. I tried 1/3 with almonds, 1/3 with macadamia and 1/3 with raisins. All three tasted good, but my favorite was the macadamia. I have even freezed it...

The best pumpkin bread ever. I added raisins, used 1/2 applesauce, half oil.  Amd I used 2 tsp pumkin pie spice. Moist, excellent flavor. I made several and gave them to friends who also thought it was the best they'd ever had. Perfect.

This recipe was great.  I added a cup and a half of chocolate chips.  I also used 2 tsp of pumpkin pie seasoning instead of the nutmeg and cinammon.  I read another review saying that this bread tates better with age.  I agree with this.  I don't understand why that is.  I tried some last night fresh out of the oven and I could barely taste the pumpkin.   This morning it was delicious.  I def recommend this recipe.

This pumpkin bread is truely delicious. The steps are simple and the result is good, moist and smells wonderful. I used two 9"x3" loaf pans and they are perfectly baked at 350 dreegree for one solid hour. I also tried baking in one batch with a 9"x13" dish, it also baked well with one hour bake time. I put chocolate chips instead of nuts. The combination is nice. Really enjoyed making and eating this pumpkin bread. Definitely a keeper!

Quick and easy! I made a half-batch and put about 2/3 into a loaf pan and the rest made about 6 large muffins. The muffins were done in about 30 minutes and the loaf was around 45 minutes.

This is the best, moistest, most flavorful pumpkin bread I've ever tried. My 9-year old daughter has made about this recipe over and over the last couple of weeks, because we always want one loaf for us and a couple more to give away. We don't change a single thing.Thanks for a great recipe!

This is by far a great recipe, I added a couple handfuls of semi-sweet Chocalate chips.  What a great addition.  Made it for a Cookout and had rave reviews.

Wow...this is great.  I'm eating a piece  warm from the oven now.  I did the 1/2 oil, 1/2 applesauce.  Used one 15oz can of libby's pumpkin pie filling (can never find pumpkin puree...what is that?), 1 heaping t of cinnamon, 1/4 t. pumpkin pie spice, no nutmeg, about 1/4 t. vanilla and about 1/2 c of raisons...din't measure them just dumped some out of the box.  Filled just 2 loaf pans and took them out of the oven in about 55 minutes.  The tops cracked a little, but the texture and taste are wonderful.  I'm gong to freeze one loaf for Thanksgiving weekend.
1/1/09...made this again and didn't get the same results.  The middle didn't cook.  I guess I didn't check it before I pulled it out of the oven because it sure was gooey.  Will have to watch that next time I make this.

Amazing!!!!  I am kind of new to baking and this recipe was perfect.  We made muffins and bread out of this recipe (the muffins only need about 30 min).  Our friends thought it was great!!!

I used a 9 x 5 loaf pan, and just wanted one loaf, so I halved the recipe (adjusted it to 12 servings) and it was the perfect amount.  I also had only pumpkin pie mix rather than plain pumpkin, so I used that with a few adjustments - reduced sugar to 1/2 of what it called for, spices were already in the pumpkin pie mix, so i just added a dash of nutmeg - should have also used a dash of cinnamon.  I added a teaspoon a vanilla and reduced the water a bit because the pumpkin pie mix was a little runnier than pumpkin.  Note - I used a dark coated pan and this cooked up in 52 minutes, if using a dark or coated pan, you should reduce your heat by 15-25 degrees, or the edges can cook too fast.  Wonderful recipe - can't wait to try it with chocolate chips.  Thank you for sharing this!

This was absolutely the BEST pumpkin bread I have ever made! The only thing I added was 1 teaspoon of vanilla to the egg mixture and it was the biggest hit with my family.. I highly reccomend this one!!!

Good - next time I would follow advice of others and add half applesauce for the oil, and reduce the sugar a bit.
I added coconut and it turned out great.
I will make this again.

Darn delicious. I ALWAYS think breads taste better the next day.  This one smelled wonderful while it was cooking; I couldn't wait for a sample.  If it tastes better tomorrow I don't think I'll be able to stand it!  It is moist and so flavorful.  I did not add the walnuts.  It is a little sweeter than most pumpkin bread recipes I've tried.  I like it but others may want to make some adjustments with the sugar.  I have to have another piece.  DELICIOUS!

Great recipe. Makes ALOT! I ran out of vegetable oil, so I replaced w/1/2 c peanut oil and 1/2 c applesauce. Added pecans and it turned out wonderfully. Big hit at the office. Descriptions were "moist", "not too sweet" and "yum"!

This is always a hit and is wholesome too.  I bring this to satisfy the masses at social gatherings.  I never come home with any left.  Easy, no frills recipe that can be dressed up with cream cheese whipped with confectioner's sugar for an icing spread.

What great pumpkin bread. The pumpkin that I used yielded more than 2 cups (maybe 2 1/2), so I just threw it all in. It took a little longer to cook, but was SO moist (not gooey). I added more nutmeg and cinnamon than called for and used some ginger, too. Everyone that had it raved about it. I have added it to my recipe box!

This is absolutely the best pumpkin bread ever. I have given this recipe out to at least 15 people who have simply raved about the flavor of this bread and requested the recipe. So simple and sooooo delicious. I make about 20 loaves to give out in the fall and that amount is quickly rising. A MUST to try.

I added a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips... very yummy and a big hit. I did use half whole wheat and half white flour and substituted applesauce for half the oil called for. I do this in almost all my baked goods, and still get rave reviews. Thank you for the recipe - I'm adding it to my recipe box!

It was pretty good...i added extra pumpkin pie spice,used raisins, and baked it in only two pans for about 1hr 15mins. I brought it to work and everyone really likes it.

It is in fact delicious.  I changed the recipe slightly.  I substituted 1 of the cups of sugar for 3/4 cup brown sugar; I split the flour into 1 1/2 cups all-pourpose flour and 1 3/4 cups wheat flour; followed the recommendations of others and substituted 1/2 oil for applesauce; and added 1 tsp. of pumpkin spice.  My mother took the bread to work and several people said it was the best pumpkin bread they ever tasted.  I gave them this recipe.

We made this according to the recipe except for the spices.  I didn't have nutmeg, so we used 1tsp of cinnamon and 1tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  I baked two loaves and the rest in heart-shaped tins.  Both turned out great and everyone loves it.  
I was testing this for a bridal shower and we are using the heart-shaped mini loaves and slicing them in half like a bun and filling with the Fluffy Orange Spread also listed on Allrecipes.  They are fabulous and cute.

This is a great recipe.  Since  I didn't have a smaller loaf pan, I had to use a large one and muffins out of the rest.  I highly do not recommend doing this.  The inside never fully cooked.  I eneded up having to carve away the cooked portions then trying again.  Even after all that labor, it was still a good bread.  I added dried cranberries and chocolate chips instead of nuts, just to make sure it was as unhealthy and delish as possible ;)  

I didn't have a problem with the amount of eggs in it as some of the others did.

I liked the way the bread crusted a bit and the inside was moist. 
I did add a bit more nuts and pumpkin puree. 
Had I not told my husband it was "pumpkin" bread, he would have raved about it. 
I did catch him eating some. :)

Fabulous.  I used this recipe with the Banana Nut Bread in a jar method of baking and it turned out wonderfully.  And it made great little fall gifts for friends, pastors, and babysitters.  (My dad claimed three of the jars for himself!)

This bread is so moist and oh so good! I was a little afraid it would not turn out after I had it all mixed up becuase it was so thin... I used pumpkin I boiled and pureed. I though, humm maybe I should have 2/3 cup of left the water out, but it turned out great and my family LOVES it.

This was pretty good and really did come out super moist.  It just wasn't as pumpkin-y as I hoped.  I guess I was hoping for that rich pumpkin flavor that is in those pumpkin muffins at Paradise Bakery, but no such luck.  It was very good, though.  Next time I will add more spices.  Thanks! :)

This is the first recipe I have made with fresh pumpkin. The pumpkin was 3 months old but the pumpkin bread came out so good! Easy recipe and so tasty! The only change I would make next time is to add more nuts.

good bread, but if you are a high altitude resident you'll need to add more flour or less water.  The top of my bread was still somewhat doughy.

I used a 15oz can of pumpkin for this recipe.  I could not find my nutmeg so I used 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice.  I made 24 muffins and 1 small bowl of bread as I did not have another muffin tin.  I also used 3-1/2 cups flour....that was an OOOPS.  

Next time I think I will use the nutmeg and pumpkin pie spice.  I would rate these a 4 based on the changes I made.

Yummy! The batter looked very runny but came out perfect and very moist after baking.I made two loaves and about 24 mini muffins. I reduced sugar to 2 cups, added 1 ts unsweetened cocoa powder and a TBS dark rum.

This recipe came out very well! I made muffins and everyone loved them. I substituted All Spice for the nutmeg (because I did not have any nutmeg on hand), added a few extra tablespoons of oil, and extra ground cinnamon. They came out very moist and flavorful.

Very good! I did omit one cup of sugar and add a dash more nutmeg and cinnamon and baked part of the batter in a bundt cake pan....Did very well! Think I will add raisin and more walnuts next time. Also will sprinkle tops with cinnamon and sugar (when made in loaves) Just to dress it up a bit. And add glaze if made into a bundt again. Thanx for the recipe!!

This is a fantastic recipe.  I made mine low fat by using low-fat butter, egg-beater eggs, and used half splenda/half sugar for the sweetener.  It's super-moist and full of flavor.  This was a tasty cake, even reduced calorie. Will make again and again. :)

This is a good recipe and can easily be adjusted to fit your tastes.  I will definitely be making it again.  I liked the fact that it made three loaves.  I made one plain, one with nuts, and one with raisins.  I did make a few changes by reducing the sugar to 2-1/2 cups instead of three, adding some vanilla extract, and using milk instead of water.  The consistency was great and the loaves were devoured in two days (gasp)!

An easy recipe that tastes really good.  I cut the recipe in half and made muffins instead of a loaf.  Big success!

Add another 5 star review to the list! I added 3 tsp of pumpkin pie spice, a splash of vanilla  and 1/2 cup of cinnamon applesauce. I omitted the walnuts. This was super delicious, I do like the consistency of the Pumpkin Bread IV form this site better, but the taste of this can't be beat. I baked the three loaves for 1 hour and they were too done; my oven must be running hot. I recommend checking these at 50 minutes and I will remove at 55 minutes next time. Happy Thanksgiving y'all!

Thank you for this receipe. My son-in-law loves pumpkin bread and he fall in love with this one. Quick, easy and moist. Increased the cinnamon to 2Tbsp., the nutmeg to 1 tsp. and added 1 tsp. ginger. Left out the nuts because of allergy's and it was still delicious. Thanks

Wonderful warm from the oven with a bit of butter.  I made it in 2 loaf size pans and baked for about 70 minutes and it was the perfect amount.

This is THE BEST pumpkin bread recipe I`ve tried. I made three changes, I added 1/3 cup more sugar, a bit more nutmeg and cinnamon, and I used the easy pumpkin mix instead of the puree. But truely I think it would be wonderful without the changes!

This is my every-year recipe now. Since I started making it, I've changed over to whole wheat flour, only 2 cups of sugar, I add flax seed and wheat germ.  I buy the small baking pumpkins, cut them, bake them til soft on low heat then put the pumpkin pulp in processor. I get about 4.5 cups of pumpkin from ONE small baking pumpkin and it's fresh :)  Worth the effort!!

This is wonderful! So moist and delicious. Everyone I have served it to has raved about it.  When I made it I used 4 mini-loaves and 1 regular loaf pan they all turned out great. Also freezes and defrosts beautifully.

Incredibly moist and my 2 year old loves them! As recommended by a friend, I cut the recipe in half...and used one 15oz can of pumpkin, a little extra cinnamon and some ginger.  I still yielded 18 reg. muffins, 12 mini muffins and 2 small loaves.  Well worth it!

This pumpkin bread was delicious, though, I did cut the amount of sugar in half, and was SO glad that I did - the sweetness was perfect at 1.5 cups. I honestly can't imagine using a full 3 cups of sugar - would be way too sweet for my family.

It was absolutely FANTASTIC!!!
I altered the recipe in number of ways:
1) I used "Lighter Bake"a prune based oil/butter substitute and 1/2 cup grape seed oil 
2) I used about 1/2 cup more pumpkin 
3) I used 1/2 cup honey and 1/2 cup brown sugar for sweetening
4) I used 2tsp vanilla 1tsp coconut extract  & 1tsp maple extract (not artificial flavors)
5) I used 2tsp cinnamon, 1tsp pumpkin pie spice, 1/2 tsp  nutmeg
   I did add walnuts as well.
  I  have made pumpkin bread recipes that were pretty bland, and I made this for a very special gathering, so I didn't want a flavorless so, so quick bread. This was about the best pumpkin  bread I have ever made or tasted;  it was the most deeply perfectly flavored pumpkin bread ever.

I liked it very much, it's moist & tasty.  It's a little too sweet for my taste so next time I will reduce the sugar maybe by 1/2 cup or try 1/3 cup less first. Also I added 1/2 cup of raisins, and wish I had added more. I replaced the vegetable oil with melted organic coconut oil. I'm using this in most of my baking, I like the nice hint of coconut taste it adds plus It may be healthier.

I will definitely add this recipe into my "ready set go" file.  Quick & easy & deliciously moist, I only made 2 changes: instead of 3 cups of sugar I used 2 cups with cup of powdered Stevia.  Since these were fresh carving pumpkins with a little less flavor I added 1 tsp of  liquid pumpkin pie spice.  Next time I'm adding raisins.  Yummo!!

Delicious. I changed a few things based on reviews and what I had: 
I used 2 c. sugar with about 1/2 c. brown sugar.
1/2 c. olive oil instead of 1 c. and bc I didn't have any veg oil. 
Used 3 c. fresh pumpkin shreds from Halloween pumpkin which I pureed with water - left out extra water due to this
Doubled cinnamon and nutmeg and added a tsp. allspice
Added 1 tsp vanilla
Added 2 heaping T cocoa (didn't have nuts or chocolate chips)
OMG hot with butter! So glad I added extra spices; this is delicious.

Wonderful pumpkin bread! Lots of flavor and so moist.  I made two batches this weekend. One batch resulted in 6 small loaves. That in combination with a cream cheese/brown sugar spread and homemade apple butter was a big hit at work!

I did two thirds the recipe and made one large loaf. It worked well! I  also replaced the nuts with dried cranberries and loved it.  This is very comparable to a local bakery's pumpkin sweet bread - Very good!

Made it by the recipe except for adding raisins and walnuts!  Do not feel it could have been better. Shared a loaf with both my sisters and their husbands and all enjoyed it.  Taste GREAT and was just moist enough!!  I have found a hit!!  Thanks!!

Every person who had a taste of this recipe said it was wonderful.  Making it again this week for a bake-off at the office.  Wish me luck.  (Oh, and by the way, I used golden raisins and walnuts.)

I think this needs some baking powder added. It’s not fone in the center even though I cookedit until the toothpick came out clean, and it didn’t rise at all. Very disappointed. I think I will go back to my old recipe.

My first time doing pumpkin bread and it was delicious indeed (I followed the recipe and used raisins instead of walnuts). I brought some slices to my mom and she loved it. In fact, she asked me to make her one.

This is good but 3 cups of sugar is 1 cup of sugar per loaf.  Trying to keep the flavor but cutting the calories and fat out of this recipe.  Try substituting applesauce for the oil and drop the sugar down at least 1/2 cup.  I do 3 1/2 cups of flour with 2 1/2 cups of sugar.

I used fresh pumpkin, added about 1/2 tsp of ginger, 1/2 cup of craisins, and omitted nuts. And I ran out of white sugar so substituted about 3/4 cup of brown sugar for the white. SO GOOD!!! This recipe will definitely get a do-over!

I was looking a great Pumpkin Muffin recipe.  Not all bread recipes make great muffins.  But this one does.  I made only a  few changes.  I used 4 egg whites instead whole eggs,  1/2 Whole Wheat Flour and half white flour, and I  used only 1 cup of sugar.  I added chopped dates and walnuts.  They recipes made 19 muffins.  The muffins are moist and lower fat and lower sugar.

It really is a wonderfully moist bread with great consistency, but a little flavorless. The second time I made it I added another tsp of pumpkin spice, 1/2 tsp more cinnamon, 2 shakes out of my ground cloves (cloves go a long way), and a tsp of  vanilla. Maybe I wouldn't have needed to if I had used pumpkin pie filling instead of pureed pumpkin, but it came out wonderfully!

Delicious!  I've made this several times.  I double the spices and sometimes use 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips instead of using nuts. Sugar can be reduced if preferred and still taste great.

I make this exactly to the recipes specs.  Used walnuts and no raisins.  It is heavy, moist and sweet exactly like you want.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because nothing is perfect!  Can't keep my husband out of it!!!!!!

I just made this today. I did half the batch the recipe called for. Added  half oil and half apple sauce, raisins and pecans. It came out good, not too oily or sweet at all. Could have used a bit more spice though.

I make this recipe as muffins instead of as bread, and it comes out excellent! Instead of the nuts or raisins, I use cranberries and add a little extra spice. It lasted a day in my house, which is not long at all.

I made this recipe and did read a lot of reviews prior to making it.  A lot said that there was too much sugar but this recipe makes 3 loaves and I use 1 cup of sugar in my banana bread so went with what the recipe called for.  I had a ton of squash which in my mind is pretty much pumpkin so I used cooked squash instead.  It worked well and the bread is the best pumpkin (squash) bread I have tasted.  I will be making this again and using squash as I did this time.

The recipe yielded 3 dozen muffins. They were a hit. I added ½ cup of dark chocolate chips. They were moist and not too sweet. When I baked them as muffins, they baked a lot quicker. I  took them out of the oven after 40 minutes of baking.

I loved the moistness of this loaf! I made it just as-is but put the walnuts on top of the loaf before baking it rather than in the batter and I was very happy with the way the loaves turned out and so was my whole family. However, the recipe lost points with me because it didn't have enough of the aromatic spices and flavor that are commonly associated with pumpkin...anything. This recipe will be a keeper and I will make it again but I will experiment with the spices a lot more.

Only change I made was using dried cranberries rather than raisins or nuts (cannot eat nuts). Gave the bread a nice tang.

This has become a family favourite!  I did substitute half the oil with applesauce, reduce the sugar, add more spice and added chocolate chips.  I make them into muffins.  My favourite muffin ever!

Delicious!!! 

Changes I made and still yummy: Used half white whole wheat flour and half oat flour. Used half canola oil and half applesauce. Used 2 cups of sugar instead of 3. Doubled the spices. Used two cans of pumpkin 14 or 15 oz.

I'll definitely make this again. Actually, I've made it once before. Scrumptious every time. I got the recipe bookmarked.

UPDATE:
I used this recipe to make banana bread. I changed the servings to 12 and used 1 3/4 cup of mashed bananas instead of the pumpkin. Used 3/4 cup of sugar. Doubled the spices. And made the other switches I mentioned above in my previous review. SO DELICIOUS!!!!

Awesome just about describes how this turned out!!!?? I used whole wheat flour instead of APF just to make it a bit healthier, and added some chopped pears in the batter..and it turned out super moist and so light! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is my new favorite recipe! I halved it, and made one 9x5 loaf. I scaled down the cinnamon because of my preference, but other than that I followed the recipe and it's fantastic. I wasn't sure about the directions at first, but I followed them and this resulted in a light, moist bread with no undercooked bottom. It's best to just mix until blended. Thank you!

Delicious. Didn't add any nuts, raisins or chips. I used coconut oil instead of the veggie oil and doubled the cinnamon, only because my family loves cinnamon. Really moist and flavorful, great pumpkin bread -Thanks!

This recipe is a keeper!  I served this last night at our couples Bible study & everyone enjoyed it!  I baked it in a bundt cake pan, hoping it would cook well & be moist.  I baked for an additional 15 minutes & didn't use the nuts.  The next time I make this I'll adjust to a little less sugar & fill my bundt cake pan to only 3/4 full. It rose quite a bit.  Make sure you use cooking spray or a non-stick pan so it comes out easily. I also made & drizzled a vanilla glaze on top & it looked delicious!

I make this pumpkin bread all the time, and it comes out perfect every time. Everyone who I know who has tried it, ever adamant pumpkin-haters, loved it! I entered a loaf in the county fair this Spring, and it took best in class for quick breads. Great recipe.

I have made this many times.  Everyone loves it.  They are amazed at how moist it is.  Don't overcook it.  I bake it for 1hr & 5 min.  It may not look done, but it is.  I made it for Christmas gifts this year.  You have to try it!

This came out great. I cut the recipe by 2/3 and only made one loaf at a time, but I've now made 2 and we keep eating them so fast, I may make more and freeze them next time. Instead of oil, I went with applesauce as others mentioned and I threw in a couple teaspoons of vanilla. I added 2 tablespoons of flax meal for some extra nutrition, too.

Just wonderful ! I love this recipe,, thanx so much. I did a few changes tho as well. I changed the sugar to one and a half cup white sugar,and one cup(packed) brown sugar. Also, I added one tsp vanilla, and 4 tsp pumpkin pie spice. I also ran out of vegetable oil, and used margarine instead. Was a little hard to mix,,, but all in all,,, turned out great,,and moist ! I dusted with icing sugar after loaves cooled. I only had to bake for 40-45 minutes,,hour would be too long.
* The only thing I would do differently is possibly add more spices.

Thanx again,,,and WILL use this recipe again.

Made several loaves of this last year & loved it, but with changes. white-whole wheat flour,1c brown sugar,1c white, meant to sub just 1/2c. oil 1/2c appleasauce, mistakenly added 1c applesauce & 1/2 c oil. Dbl spices & 1 tsp vanilla,1c pecans, 1c raisin  It came out fine,but I think the sugar could be reduced even more. will do 1 1/2c brown, more nuts and raisins next batch & get the oil/apple measure right. its very easy to put together & love that its 3 loaves.

I've been making this for years. No substitutes, just follow the recipe. Bake for an hour or a little longer depending on what type of pan you use. Disposable pans usually take longer than my metal pans. Anyway this bread is super delicious!! A fall favorite every year.

As the name suggests its actually delicious :) everyone in my family including my 20 month old loved it. I substituted about a quarter of All purpose flour with Wholewheat flour and yet it was super moist and tasty. Probably next time I'll trying using some honey instead of sugar to make it healthier.

I used half a cup of applesauce as a substitute for half of the oil, and used raisins and baked it in a large cake pan.  The husband took it to work for a pot luck day and it was an instant hit!  Everyone insisted that he bring it more often!

I read a lot of reviews and made all of the changes that "SDOUGLAS" suggested, including reducing the sugar from 3 cups to 2 (I ended up using 2 1/2), more than doubled the spices, added cloves, (TASTE THE batter!), used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce, mixed dry ingredients and wet ingredients separately, and added 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips. I only cooked for 20-22 minutes and they were so moist. Even the ones that I didn't use a muffin cup for popped right out of the pan!

Love this bread!  My husband went crazy for it.  It's Fall (almost), so pumpkin everything!  This recipe was fast and easy to follow, and cooked in right under an hour.  The only alterations I made were using 2 cups of sugar opposed to 3, and adding mini chocolate chips for extra sweetness (I will try walnuts next time too).  Also, you might want to double up on the cinnamon and nutmeg.  I used 1 1/2 tsp of each, and it could have used more.  The mix makes A LOT of batter, so the spices just get lost in there.  I made one large loaf and 9 muffins.  Muffins were great too!  The muffins baked in under 40 minutes.  

This recipe will be a Fall fixture in my house!  Enjoy it in yours :)

this is sooo good. I just baked it, in one 9x5x3, using 1/2 of the whole ingredients. i TOTALLY forgot to put the walnuts, and i really regret it. I'm sure it would be even BETTER if i put the walnuts in this bread...Maybe it was too much batter, and i had to bake about 1hr 20mins, til the toothpick became clean when i inserted in the middle of the bread, and the both edges got hardened, so probably it would be better to use the whole amount of ingredients & the pans she calls for. But Still, the taste is amazing!!! now, i'm typing this, eating the piece of the bread, still can see the STEAM coming out of it, and i put the whipped cream on the top! YUMMYYYY!!

This was really yummy!  Next time I might use a smidge more pumpkin to give it more flavor.  I used pumpkin pie spice instead of the spices recommended.  I also substituted the raisins for chocolate chips.  My whole family loved it!

Delicious!  I made it with fresh pumpkin that I cooked in the microwave for about 30 minutes and pureed in a blender.  I also included the walnut which gave it a great crunch.

I took some of the previous reviewer's suggestions, I doubled the cinnamon and nutmeg and substituted apple sauce for half the oil. I also used chopped almonds instead of raisins.  The bread tastes delicious, I will definitely be making this again!

We loved it. Used apple sauce for oil. Used brown sugar substitute. Added black walnuts. It will make great Christmas gifts for neighbors.

Okay so i followed what everybody else suggested and I subsituted half of the oil with apple sauce and used brown sugar which turned out great :) I reduced the sugar by half...it was still too sweet for me (maybe because of the applesauce and the dates.) I added a dash of cloves put in toasted pine nuts and dates...which also worked out. I used kobacha squash which is often known as japanese pumpkin (I didn't have real pumpkin). The flavour was excellent! But I found that it was just a bit mushy. I think it's from adding extra pumpkin and applesauce. But, I will diffinitely be making this again. Thanks for the recipe :)

Soo good. This is the first time I've ever baked anything that didn't come out of a box. I made the low fat version with half apple sauce and half oil. I also added chocolate chips. Yummy! So good heated up!

LOVE THIS! This has become a tradition for me to make for my family. After making it now, over twenty times, I can definitly say that it is a fantastic Pumpkin bread! I do think that the nuts add something special to it, so I never make it without. Also, even though it may take a little longer than what is listed to cook the bread, make sure not to over cook it! I have made that mistake a couple of times, also tried more spices, which I do not recommend. The recipe is pretty good on it's own; it really doens't need much of anything else(:

Like some other reviewers, I swapped out half the oil and sugar with applesauce, raising and extra walnuts. While the taste wasn't bad, the cooking time was way under. I'd say you need to add another hour in the oven.I'll keep working on this.

Delicious pumpkin bread. I was looking for a recipe beacause I had a can of pumpkin. I made this bread and oh my it was the best ever, I dont like pumpkin desserts of ant kind and I decided to taste it beacause it felt so moist. I loved it and gave it  out at Christmas. My brother in law loved it so much he bought me cans of pumpkin to make more for him. Also I put some in the freezer and it was still moist when I thaw it out to eat. I give it a 10 star recipe. Thank you.

Made only one adjustment to this recipe and that was decreasing sugar to 2 cups and added a cup of raisins. Probably could have used 1 1/2, but did not want to find out the hard way. This bread is flavorful and moist. Everyone that I gave a loaf to for the holidays raved about it. Simple and easy recipe for any novice baker. Many other reviewers mentioned that this bread was not "pumpkiny" enough in flavor and in all my many years of baking do I recall any pumpkin bread or other pumpkin recipe with a strong pumpkin flavor except maybe pumpkin pie which is probably due to the fact that it's all pumpkin and no flour. 5 stars!!!!!!

Mine flopped after following recipe exactly.  My baking soda was new...I checked it.  It looked great coming out of the oven, but a few minutes later it reacted like a burst ballon.   I'm wondering if I should have left it in the oven to cool slowly, but nothing in the directions mentioned doing that.

This bread was amazing.  In lieu of the walnuts, I added the zest of one orange, a handful of dried cranberries, and a handful of toasted pecan pieces.  I wrapped up loaves and gave them to neighbors for Thanksgiving.  They have asked for the recipe.  The one loaf we kept for ourselves was still moist a week later (just kept it wrapped in plastic wrap on the counter).

i *love* this recipe. i've made it several times now and keep getting asked for the recipe. i leave out the nuts and add raisins instead. (i just dump in one of the small snack-size boxes). i also used the easy pumpkin pie mix with all the spices added and sprinkle in some more cloves for added flavor. this bread is so moist!

This is one of the best!Gauranteed to turn out right, even if you goof up a little.I have my 2 1/2 year old grandson with me this week. I decided to let him help me make this bread and a pumpkin cheesecake recipe. So I forgot the sugar until the end, and started using the pecans from the other recipe. Then used walnuts for the other half. I did use 1 cup brown sugar, in place of some of the white. It turned out Perfect!! Thanks for the great recipe. It is a keeper!

This had a great texture, was perfectly moist and lighter than I expected a pumpkin muffin to be.  It also had a good pumpkin flavor, but it needed a lot more seasoning. It served as a wonderful base recipe though.  I made changes in flour and sugar types, subbed some oil with yogurt and added a lot more seasonings. The final result was a completely different recipe, but I appreciated having this one to start with.

This bread was very good. I did as some others said and added a little bit of vanilla to give a little more flavor. I changed it to a serving for 18 because I didn't have enough pumpkin for 24 servings. It ended up making two loaves. The first loaf I made with nothing in it just plain. The second one I added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips for my husband because he doesn't like nuts. They both turned out very good and very yummy. I will for sure be making this again.

This recipe is FABULOUS! Sooo moist and easy to make. I love pumpkin bread and have not found a recipe as moist as this. I did add a 1/2 tsp of ginger and changed the sugar to half white/half brown. I made two batches one with golden raisins and the other with a pecan crunch topping.I had company for dinner that evening and they just loved it! Thank you for this great recipe!

My substitutions may have ruined this recipe, but this just didn't do it for me. My bread came out chewy. The flavor is fine, I'm just not a fan of the texture or consistency.

I sent this bread to work with my husband to share.  His co-workers said don't ever divorce me and and when am I going to send in more goodies.  I added a few extra walnuts than the recipe called for and I also added some chocolate chips.

PERFECTION! Moist, tasty YUM.  I followed other reviews and substituted 1/2 cup oil with 1/2 cup applesauce and used only 2 cups sugar. Using the applesauce instead of oil saves 1200 calories and 140 grams of fat! You girls are geniuses!

i loved this recipe. i made one loaf and six large cup cakes from this recipe.  I added 1/2 cup walnuts and raisins.  my husband likes it to.  i did experiment with it and added a small amount of streusel on top of two just to see how it would turn out.  the streusel is a very good idea.  ill have to make this again.  only critique if i had one to make is that there is "something" missing.  im not sure what it needs to put it over the top, but its "something"  but awesome recp.  :) :) :)

This turned out great.  Following other reviewers, I used half cup applesauce and half cup oil, and I cut a bit back on the sugar.  I added extra spices, including some pumpkin pie spice.  I also added a little bit extra pumpkin (around an extra third cup)  It was so moist and made my house smell so yummy.

I made this recipe for the girls at work and I didn't even print or save it.  Everyone wanted a copy of the recipe and they told me it was better than any pumpkin bread recipes they had made before!  I had to find it again and it took me a few days but it was delicious and I have now saved it to my favorites!

Great pumpkin bread! 
I followed the advice of others and substituted half the oil for applesauce (heaping 1/2 cup for moistness) and doubled the cinnamon. I also added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and 1/4 tsp. ground cloves. I halved the sugar and it was still sweet - I think the recommended amount of sugar would make it dessert-sweet.

Absolutely delicious!  I added 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice and a 1/2 cup raisins to the recipe.  I got 8 mini loaves and wrapped them in plastic wrap before they cooled.  The next day, they are so moist you have to lick your fingers to get the sticky off.  YUM!

This bread was fabulous! I did add more pumpkin pie spices (cloves, allspice). I made two loaves and a pan of muffins. After pouring the first pan I added chocolate chips to the rest of the batter. It is delicious with and without the chips. I also spray my pans and coat with a cinnamon and sugar mix before I pour in the batter. One side note...I lost count of my cups of flour and I think I only put in 2 instead of 3. All of the bread came out very dense and resembled the weight of a brick, but the flavor was fantastic and my family has eaten most of it already. I will definately make this again and try all of the flour!

The best part about this recipe is that you can make it in about 5 minutes.  It is so easy.  I think you need to add more spices than what the recipe calls for to it to liven up the flavor (anything that you could put into a pumpkin pie).  I also added chocolate chips and cloves to mine and it made it more of a dessert instead of just a pumpkin bar, and sprinkled powder sugar over the tops.  I halved the recipe and it made a 12x9 pan full of bars (and it was still a lot of food).

I made this to sell at a Bake Sale.  We put out samples.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  It is so moist and delicious!  The only little change I made was to substitute 3 tsp of Pumpkin Pie Spice for the cinnamon and nutmeg.

This recipe was pretty good, but I think there is a better one out there. I substituted brown sugar for white sugar and added extra spices. I had some chocolate chips on hand and tossed them in. Our house enjoyed the bread and it stayed moist for a few days, it was just lacking the "oompf" I was looking for.

Adding a little extra pumpkin pie spice was the only change I made to this recipe. It is very moist and tasty. I loved it and so did the people that I work with.

This was good- makes a lot of bread.  Made exactly as recipe indicates with the exception that I used two 9x5 loaf pans.  I'm giving this 4 stars as I was frustrated with the format of the ingredients.  Typically the ingredients are listed in the order they are used.  I got to the point of adding the pumpkin and realized I didn't have all my spices in.

This bread has great texture, but I found it way too sweet and a bit heavy on the cinnamon while light on the other pumpkin pie spices.  If I try this recipe again, I will reduce the sugar and cinnamon, and add ginger and cloves with the nutmeg and cinnamon the recipe calls for.

Fantastic recipe!  I did take some of the other users suggestions - used 1/2 whole wheat & 1/2 regular flour.  I also used brown sugar.  Thanks for this awesome recipe!

Yummy!! Decadently moist & perfect!  Made a few changes - used 2 cups all purpose cake flour & 1 1/4 cup whole wheat flour---used 4 oz applesauce to make up pumpkin amount from 15 oz can---used 2 cups natural sugar, 1/2 cup white refined sugar & 1/2 cup splenda---added 1/4 cup amaretto---added 1 tsp vanilla.

It has decent flavor, but the texture has WAY too many eggs.  I did lessen the sugar to just over 2c, & if I were ever to make it again (and I might just to test it out) I will only use only 3 or maybe even 2 eggs.

The preperation was very quick and easy. All of the ingrediants except pumpkin are found in most kitchens. The clean up was also very quick. Overall it is an easy recipe. You just combine the ingrediants by hand or in a mixing bowl.
The baking time shoud be extended because the center was still mushy with dough.
It was definately elicious and there were no overpowering tastes. Everything was blended very well. I would use this recipe again.

Smelled wonderful baking, tasted nice too.  The pumpkin flavor is well balanced.  I soaked the raisins in whiskey and vanilla before adding them and used two large pans so the baking time was extended.  Next time will use smaller pans to prevent excessive browning on the edges.

GREAT Recipe.  Easy to make.  I added 1/4 cup of walnuts, 1 tsp of vanilla and used 2 cups of mashed bananas.  When bananas are too ripe in our house I just put them in the freezer and defrost the day I want to make the bread.  Will make again, our family has been helping themselves to multiple slices!

This pumpkin bread is indeed DELICIOUS! I made it just like the recipe but added just a little more spices. It makes a lot of pumpkin bread so next time I might half the recipe. Thanks so much for this recipe - it is soooo yummy!

This was my first attempt to bake fresh bread, and it came out perfect. The loaf was extremely moist, and the pumpkin flavor was the perfect amount, not too overpowering. After tasting it, my mom has requested i make 6 loaves for her to give to her co-workers for xmas.

This recipe is awesome!  Since I've been pregnant I've had a huge craving for anything pumpkin.  This bread hit the spot!  My family LOVES it!  I soaked some raisins in water and cinnamon for about 30 minutes and only added 3/4 cup oil.  It came out super moist and OH SO dee-lish!

Wonderful! Now taking orders from my husbands co-workers for more of this. This is so moist... I like to spread butter all over the tops as soon as it gets out of the oven to make it a little more moist! Yummm!

This was a hit at thanksgiving. I made them into muffins and cut them into fourths and served them as an appetizer. They were all gone. I also got two loafs of bread out of the mix. I added a little allspice other than that I stuck to the recipe. Great !!!
