These cookies are amazing. So easy and quick. I've made them three times already and were a hit every time. I wouldn't change a thing to the recipe.

Pretty good cookies but not earth shattering. Extremely easy to make, no need to get out the stand mixer or the hand mixer. Thought it seemed like a little much to use an entire bag of Choc Chips and an entire bag of Craisins but it wasn't too much at all. Chocolately, nutty, chewy from the Craisins, pretty good! The cookies are not overly sweet by any means. Good cookies but skilled bakers could EASILY improve this recipe. I am just not one of those people so I cannot offer any great tips here. Might add a bit more sugar for a bit more sweetness. By the way, had regular Craisins, not the cherry ones, maybe the cherry adds a needed sweetness or dynamic flavor that I was missing. Either way, good cookies but not the best cookies I've ever had but definitely the easiest/quickest cookies I've ever made. Certainly worth a try!
