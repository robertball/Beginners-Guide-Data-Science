The flavor is amazing. BUT keeping the shape of the burger patties was a little difficult when I cooked them. So perhaps next time I might add bread crumbs to help the pattie maintain its shape when being flipped. This is a fantastic recipe regardless. I would recommend anyone try this one for a healthy plant based meal.

This reminds me of baked beans!  Easy to make, great to eat!  You have to make sure the lentils get well mashed, otherwise the burgers might break up when they are flipped!  Thanks for the recipe, Cheerios!  I will be making this again!

Great flavour combo Cheerios!  What a nice melange of tastes and textures.  I followed the recipe exactly and it renders a tasty, easy to handle, easy to fry "burger".  I formed the patties differently to see which came out better.  I made a couple a bit chubby and the other various thicknesses; the chubbier ones - although they took longer to fry - actually had a better result in both taste, texture and manageability.  The celery gives it a nice crunch and they are indeed chewy like the description states.  I was weary of the molasses and mustard frankly, but Cheerios' inventions have never let me down and he is right-it is different but good.  The ginger, molasses and mustard gave this a tangy but delicate flavour.  They weren't sweet at all.  A lovely wholesome flair.  I sprinkled some fresh, chopped parsley and balsamic vinegar on top to garnish.  Simply delicious.  Thanks for this recipe.  UPDATE:  These freeze well.  I froze half of the mixture before frying them and they cooked well once thawed.  Just wait until they thaw and then form the patties and cook as written.

This was very bland. Flavorless. Not sure how it got great reviews. If you are inclined to make it more seasoning will be needed. I would definitely cook the lentils an additional 10 min. as suggested by another reviewer

Excellent recipe. I didn't read how to cook it and put aluminium foil on bbq with some oil and placed it there. Cooked approximately 4 minutes per side, flipped quite well, deformed only a bit. I also cooked the lentils 30 minutes instead of 20 and did not need to mash because it mashed itself when I mixed it all together.
