I've always been intimidated by ribs; they seem like too much work.  But this recipe was fantastic!  Soooo easy and soooo tasty!!!  This was the first time that my husband and I loved a recipe the first time we tried it, without having to "tweak" it again later!  Most definitely a keeper.

nice recipe, i added a bit of red hot to make it burn!  i will also add, dont leave the top open so long, if you want them to fall off the bone start them open, than close them tight so they will fall off the bone!!  Great recipe to get you started!!!

We absolutely loved this recipe for ribs!! Different and delicious, the crowd we fed thoroughly enjoyed it. We boiled them till the meat almost fell off the bone and then grilled them outdoors, basting this yummy sauce on top. I think they would taste better this way anyway.

Very good, but next time I will cover the ribs for the last hour.  45 minutes uncoveed and 60 minutes covered.  That way the basting sauce will not dry out and burn.  My smoke alarm went off!!

I used the Kikkomans chili(it is not the chili with/without beans) and also the plum sauce for this recipe(found in the Asian isle of the grocery store). I followed the recipe to a Tee and it turned out great. It's also easy to make in a crock pot, definitely a keeper. Thanks.

The plum/chili sauce is a nice twist. I brined the ribs in water, sea salt, brown sugar, lime juice, soy sauce, and cloves and slow cooked them on the grill. I added the plum/chili sauce when half cooked and wrapped them in foil with additional sauce for the last 45 minutes. They were a huge hit at our pool party.

Very good. I used country style ribs and the sweet chili sauce from the Thai section of the store. The glaze made a nice sauce over rice alongside the ribs.

I made this for a group of friends and I must say this is the easiest i could ever imagine it could get for ribs. I always thought making ribs was complicated this was my first time making them and it was simple, and best of all came out delicious! The only changes i made is that i added about 1tsp of ginger to the sauce and some brown sugar. Loved it and will use it again!!!

I made this sauce for pork ribs at a rib cook off.  I came in 3rd place against a professional chef and my ribs never made it to the grill.  Even they they were only baked they were very tasty.  Watch out these are spicy though.

This recipe is delicious!! I didn't have the chili sauce, so I just added some hotsauce.  First I brownded the ribs then slowly simmered them in the sauce.  They were tender and delicious!! Super easy and clean-up was not too bad. No leftovers tonight.(perfect served with some fried rice)

These were amazing. The chili sauce I used was not super spicy so these were mild. I might find or add more spice next time for my taste but they were perfect for my boyfriend. We made a batch of pork ribs half with this marinade and half with another marinade (Honey Garlic also found here on allrecipes) and both were very flavorful. We cooked them all on the BBQ.

I found this to be more dry and less flavorful than other similar glazed rib recipes.  I won't try it again.

Great simple way to cook pork ribs.  There is so much flavor.  You always hear people spending hours on ribs but this is just as good and less time.

Awesome!  I tasted the sauce before basting it on the ribs, and it seemed like the ginger was overwhelming; however, the ribs turned out fantastic!!  No overwhelming taste at all.  I served it with "Asian Coleslaw," also from this site.  Thanks for the recipe!

The sauce turned out excellent. I like to go with a mix of sweet and regular chili sauce.

OH MY...I used 12 oz of "sriracha" hot chili sauce (the one with the rooster on the front) and it was all you could taste and waaaay too hot (and I like hot), I don't think I used the right kind, maybe I'll try heinz chili sauce next time

Followed this recipe exactly and it gets 5+ stars.  These baby backs were cooked to perfection.  I'm on the fence about the taste of the sauce but my guy loved it.  The one thing I will do forever is follow the cooking times for baby back ribs.  Thanks so much submitter.

This was my second time to make pork ribs but this is the best recipe compared to the first one that I used. The meat is literally falling off the bone !!! I love this !!! Best if paired with potato salad and some green beans. Thank you for this recipe.

I used country style pork ribs. As per other reviews, I bake them for 45 minutes uncovered, pour the sauce over top and cover tightly with foil. continue baking for another 45-60 minutes. They come out so tender! I recently began adding a little brown sugar, about a tablespoon or so and about 1/2 tsp of ground ginger to the sauce. Absolutely fantastic. A favorite in our house!
