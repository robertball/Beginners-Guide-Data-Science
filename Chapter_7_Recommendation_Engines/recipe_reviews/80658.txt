overall very yummy, and with a nice array of festive colors.  my only complaints are that it was a bit too sweet, and swimming in dressing.  next time i make this i'll halve the dressing recipe, and further halve the amount of sugar.

My husband loved this recipe, he went back for seconds.  Everyone else that has tried it has loved it.   I used red onion instead of pimentos - personal preference.  Dressing was great as is.

This came out great - topped with tomato basil feta cheese, and a little ground chipotle pepper for color and spice. I took the other reviewers suggestion and halved the dressing formula, with sugar cut back to 2 Tb.It was just wet enough and there was enough marinade to coat everything as it was stirred up again.   It was a little sweet and savory at the same time. Thanks for sharing.

This was delicious and just what I was looking for! I left out the green pepper and pimento as a personal preference, added a little chopped red onion for color, and a little crushed red pepper for color and spice. The dressing was perfect, not too sweet! Happy New Year1

my sister-in-law makes a version of this and tops it with tomato basil feta cheese.  The cheese is wonderful with the dressing.

Delicious salad, but I leave the celery out due to my personal preference.  But everyone I have served it to really likes it.  I have also substituted the sugar with splenda and it was good as well.  Thanks Kate!

I used to make one almost identical to this in the restaurant I cooked at last. Love it. I used fresh cooked & cut up bacon instead of bottled. I also made it more flavorful by adding the bacon grease I cooked the bacon in. If you do this, decrease the olive oil by half.

We enjoyed this so much! I've made different variations of black-eyed pea salad, but this is my fave now! The only thing I did differently was add a red bell pepper instead of a green bell pepper and I added garlic powder as well. Yum!

I don't normally rate recipes but this recipe is awesome!  I did this according to the recipe but added red onion as well as some cilantro.  So good and I tasted it right away...I can't wait until all the flavors marinate together and eat some for the New Year!
