YUMMY! read recipes of traditional p.cake and tweaked it. PERFECT! Don't preheat oven! Other websites recommended this & it worked! If you have a kitchen Aid stand mixer: this was my method- whipped 1C butter flav. crisco + 1/2 C. real butter & 3C sugar for 8 minutes at highest speed, occasionally scraping the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula.  Then added one egg and whipped one more minute, added another egg and whipped one more minute, scraped the sides of the bowl, and repeated the process  until all 6 eggs were whipped in, which added 6 more minutes to whipping time.  Turned mixer to lowest speed, then added 1 cup of sour cream (was short on sour cream so used half and half to fill up the rest of the measurement), 2 teaspoons of coconut extract and 1 teaspoon of almond extract [cuz one reviewer said smelled like sun tan lotion while baking] and kept the mixer running while I sifted the flour and baking soda into a separate bowl. added a tiny pinch of salt. Then slowly poured in the dry ingredients into the mixing bowl at lowest speed still & as soon as it was all in and wet, turned mixer off & gentle stir with spatula then poured it into greased/floured bundt pan.Crucial: bake at 325* for 70 minutes! cool on wire rack 10 minutes b4 inverting from pan. glaze crown  w/ thick mixture of half&half,powdered sugar, & 1 tsp  coconut extract.  sprinkled 1 C. coconut on top of glaze, & 1/2 C. choc chps on top of that. Thnx Paula 4 best cake I ever made!Excellent! Beautiful!

WONDERFUL and so simple to make! I loved that this used crisco and I didn't have to remember to bring butter to room temp., lol, but believe it or not, this still had a nice, buttery taste to it. The smell of this baking is intoxicating! Oh, and the baking time was spot on in my new oven. :) Loved the slightly crunchy top and the moist beautiful texture if the inside. This is a keeper, for sure~YUM! Paula, Thank You and your MIL for sharing such a delicious recipe! :)

I thought this baked up sooo beautifully, instructions were very well written, but I did not care for the coconut extract & I had to add an additional 40 MINUTES to the baking time??!! Not kidding at all....40 min. It smelled like suntan oil in my kitchen while baking & I couldn't get past that sentiment while eating it. I would've preferred to get the coconut flavor from shredded coconut itself. That being said, I took it to a family get-together & got positive comments on it. This was a really hard one for me to rate. I'd give it 10+ stars for appearance & texture.

This cake is absolutely fabulous! The thick, rich batter bakes up into a moist and delicious cake. The crunchy top is huge hit with my cake lovers and is the prized part of the cake. I added the seeds of one vanille bean for a complimentary flavor and those lovely flecks of flavor.

I switched the coconut flavoring for almond and the sour cream for yogurt, since that's what I had in the house.  I iced it with a lemon glaze and it was heavenly.  It was a rich cake with a light flavor.  Unfortunately, I only had a few pieces since it quickly disappeared!!

This is what I think of when I think of pound cake. Itâ€™s dense, creamy, and not too dry. I added some blueberries on top. I had to use butter. Shortening is not available to me where I live. Thank you for the recipe.

Great recipe, thanks for sharing! I did make a few minor changes...used 1 1/2 tsp Coconut Extract and 1 1/2 tsp Vanilla Extract and added maybe 1/8 tsp salt. Love the texture and the crunchy top is wonderful! I have made this a couple of times and will make it again!

I made this scrumptious cake for my husband and it was an instant winner! It is a very moist cake. The only change I made was adding 1 cup of sweetened, flaked coconut - at his request.
I will definitely be making this cake again!

Very nice cake..    The texture turned out nice.     I however reduced the Crisco to half and added that much coconut oil.    It turned out excellent.

I really liked this recipe, tasted so amazing. I did use a little less butter and replaced one of the 3 cups of flour with 1 cup of organic coconut flour, did not add the extract as it wasn't needed. Next time I think I will add some fresh fruit in it, maybe? Also, my baking time was way more than the recipe said at 300 degrees, but totally worth the wait!

Very good cake recipe, however, I did not use coconut flavoring but did use vanilla and worked out well.   All pound cakes are very similar except maybe one two,or three flavorings, Either use oil or butter or may call one half oil and one half butter and or sour cream, buttermilk 
Or cream cheese. They all basically have six eggs. Three cups flour three cups of sugar. Many times I use 1/2 cup less sugar and so far works out well

Don't know what went wrong. Made it twice and cake fell both times. Guess I'll stick with the cream cheese pound cakes. I usually have good success with those.

I was looking for a Sour Cream Pound Cake like my Mom use to make. She passed away 30 yrs ago and I could not find her recipe.  This one was close.  I served it with cherry vanilla ice cream, like my Mother use to.  Thank you for bringing back a memory.

Oh. My. Gosh. This is an incredible recipe and I will so make it again. My mom loved it and I sometimes substitute the coconut extract with peppermint, almond, or orange extract. Five stars is not a good enough rating for this awesome pound cake.
