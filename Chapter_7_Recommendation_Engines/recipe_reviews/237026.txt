This is really good, and easy to make. Some suggestions for next time: add slightly more sauce to the beef, stir cheese into the crust, and add baking powder to the crust to make it fluffy. Other than that, this was amazing, and a great change from that rock solid gluten free pizza you get elsewhere.

this is a great recipe, I made 2 changes to the recipe, after I add the mozzarella I add my pepperoni's and when I do the Italian cheese I use about 1-1&1/2 cups of cheese (I like extra cheese)

My fraternal twin sister underwent surgery and was told afterward that she couldn't have much dairy anymore. Soon, she came down with wheat allergies. As a chef, it's not only hard for me that she can't eat my creations--which have every bit of food we love--but it's hard to find and make gluten-free recipes that suit her needs. I didn't want her feeling left out of family dinners, so when I saw this recipe, I knew it would be a snap to make. The texture is wonderful, and the flavors are fantastic. My entire family loves this, and now I'll make it often when my sister visits. It's delicious, flavorful, easy, and spot-on perfect. Give it a try!

This is a family favorite!  We are Celiac and my 13 yr old has made this so many times she no longer needs the recipe.  It's so versatile that you could make it twice in the same week and it could be completely different.  

Lisa B's is the tried and true but we always top with pepperoni, black olives, and chopped green onions. Yum!

*Updating review- We no longer use just rice flour, we use a GF all purpose flour like Bob's Red Mill.  It makes the crust a lot less grainy.

This was pretty tasty, and fairly easy to make. I was worried that the "dough" would be grainy with just the rice flour, but it was fine. The dish reminded me more of lasagna than pizza, but I would definitely make it again.

I absolutely loved this recipe. I will definitely be making it again. I would probably go with less ground beef the next time to see if that changes anything in the taste, but that would be the only thing I'd change.

This was a really good basic recipe that is great as is or with different additions like any regular pizza. I agree with the other reviewer in that it definitely is lasagne-like, almost a lasagne-pizza hybrid. I followed another reviewer's recommendation in adding about a tsp of baking powder to the flour and adding more sauce. The crust was a tad on the bland side, so I think next time I may mix in 1/2 cup grated parmesan to the crust mixture before spreading.
Ok, the one thing that really threw me for a loop was how liquidy the crust was! I was sure that I messed up somehow because the recipe said to spread the mixture, not pour it! I mean it was a pretty thin liquid, but somehow it bakes up nicely! I will definitely make this again!

My husband and I are on the GI diet, so this pizza recipe using whole grain flour was really appealing. It's not bad, but bland. The product is more kind of a healthy "pizza helper" casserole than a pizza, so don't kid yourself. It is perfectly tolerable, but I wouldn't serve it to guests and will try other options for traditional, bready pizza crust with refined wheat flour before making this again.  If you're trying this for the first time, do add some salt and maybe a teaspoon of baking soda.

Just tried this. I salted and added Italian seasoning to the meat and onions mixture. Also salted (a dash) the rice flour mix. I have no idea what cheeses are in the 3 Italian cheese mix, but I used a Parmesan/Romano mix with some Havarti. (I can't eat cheddar or a lot of other cheeses.) The dish turned out deliciously! My husband and myself both decided this was one of the "keepers".

First time making this and it's pretty tasty! I opted to use GF flour. To the dough, I added a dash of baking powder, garlic powder, salt and oregano per other suggestions. I will definitely cut down on the amount of hamburger next time. It was a little too much like a sloppy joe. The 'crust' was delicious, though!

I switched out the rice flour with Pillsbury's GF all purpose flour, the beef for turkey, and added more cheese...it turned out great!

This is a regular in my gluten free kitchen.  I mix in whatever toppings sound good and usually  use sweet turkey italian sausage and a little uncured pepperoni on top.  Personal preference, but it is always a winner

My family enjoyed this. I like how versatile it is. You can make it with any ingredients you and your family like. I broiled for a couple minutes at the end to brown the top and get it crispy. Thank you for the recipe!

We have to be gluten-free. This is the second time I have made this.  My husband really likes it and asked for it. I added pineapple and mushrooms. I will make this again and know that anything  that you put on a pizza can be put in this.

This was delicious, easy, and quick to make! I changed it up a little for what we had on hand, but the basic concept of this recipe was great and I'm definitely adding it to our regular dinner rotation. I skipped the ground beef, and used pepperoni and black olives atop the first cheese layer instead. I also added some basil, oregano, and garlic powder to the crust batter.

This was very good and more simple than rolling out pizza dough. After reading reviews I added about 5 oz of extra sauce.  I also added pepperoni, green peppers, and banana peppers just for preference. I will make this again and again.

I made this exactly as written and it was very bland.  The crust was chewy and the filling just not that great. Needless to say we will not make this again.  There are way better gluten free recipes out there to monkey with this one.

SO GOOD! I have family and friends who are gluten intolerant, so I always have GF options when we're together. I tried this recipe and served it to all my bible study group, and we loved it. It was so good that I made it for my family during our vacation. Everyone loved it! We like onions, mushrooms, and black olives, but it would be good with any choice of toppings...or in the case of upside down pizza, bottoms!
