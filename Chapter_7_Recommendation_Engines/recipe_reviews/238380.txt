Same recipe I've used for years - remember from childhood and now my kids do too.  I make a massive batch with whatever green tomatoes are left in the garden - so its something like 3 pounds of tomatoes, 3 pounds of apples, as many raisins as you've got....then once it cools I package it in quart size freezer bags and freeze them indefinitely.  They never freeze solid so whenever you want a pie, just pull out a bag and throw it in a crust.

Wonderful way to use green tomatoes from my garden!  Made "Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust" and followed recipe and even my husband (who swore he did not care for mincemeat pie) enjoyed it.  Will be making more to can for later use!

What a great way to use green tomatoes! And we used pears from our tree instead of apples. (Love using what we have). Also added an orange and a a lemon just because. Since we want our pies for the holidays, I plan to freeze the filling --assuming we don't eat it all right out of the pot! Delicious!
