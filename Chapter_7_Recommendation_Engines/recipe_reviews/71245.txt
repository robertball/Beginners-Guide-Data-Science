Delicious! I made these for a party and everyone loved them. I served them with Major Gray chutney on the side. Contrary to the first review, I didn't find these time consuming at all.

These are "okay" as written.  They are a five star recipe when you dip them in an egg and milk bath and then roll them in cracker crumbs before frying.  The bread crumbs just didn't taste quite right.

These were easy, and I really liked the idea in general. However, the recipe definitely lacked some oomph. Next time, I would definitely double the garam masala, because I couldn't really taste the spices at all (I did go easy on the cayenne though, because I don't care for hot spiciness). Thanks for a good idea. I might try this again but use different vegetables and experiment with the spicing. Thanks!

This was easy to make and it tasted good.  I did not have that spice so I addded cumin and some cayenne and that seemed to work.  It was added some variety to my normally boring vegetarian cooking.

I made these veggie burgers for the first time tonight and they were great!! I used two potatoes and two cups of frozen veg (sweetcorn, carrot, grean beans and peas) and I doubled the spices and I got four big burgers out of the mixture. My husband suggested using some HP brown sauce next time so I might try that. Thanks very much for this recipe!

As written these are bland, but with my modifications they tasted great.  I followed the recipe, but I didn't add the green beans until the final 3 minutes of cooking.  I didn't want mushy vegetables.  I hand mashed them and left some of the potatoes chunky.  For seasoning I added 1 tablespoon (yes one tablespoon) of garam masala.  I'm used to spicy food and this was still mild flavour with a kick.  I also grated one medium onion and two garlic cloves.  The first time I made this I used only seasoned bread crumbs.  They turned out great, but this time I made them with 3/4 a cup of seasoned bread crumbs added to the potato mixture, and I dipped them in egg and about 3/4 cup of panko.  They turned out much crispier.  The seasoned bread crumbs added to the flavour, but I will continue to use panko as the breading.  I top these with mango chutney.  Everybody who has had them says they're great!

Made these for Recipe Group. I have never used garam masala before and was intrigued to try the spices. The patties kept falling apart after cooking and hubby thought them bland and said they needed something. I did not care for the strong clove taste from the garam masala. I did use panko bread crumbs and added a little corn to them. I just didn't care for them. Thanks anyway Dhano923.

Recipe Group selection of 2/26/11.  I grew up eating leftovers this way but without the spice.  I cooked extra mashed potatoes last night and had some odds and ends of vegetables that I was saving for soup so my veggies were peas, carrots and corn about 1/2 cup of each.  I used homemade breadcrumbs which were a combination of whole wheat and rye in the patties and panko for the coating.  They were not bad.  The spices perked up an otherwise rather bland mix.  It is a good use of leftovers, but I can't imagine myself making these oherwise.  Thanks for sharing.

These were ok! I did panko for the bread crumbs and frozen vegetables in place of the green beans and peas, and doubled the garam marsala. These just really didn't have much flavor. I spread some Thai chili garlic sauce over the top and that help but on their own they were just unimpressive.

These were great and got rave reviews from my BF! I added corn and doubled the garam masala as per other reviewers. I also didn't have any bread crumbs so I used crushed crackers, half saltine and half buttery rounds (Ritz). Will definitely make again, a great vegetarian side!

these tasted great but would not bind together.  maybe i didn't drain well enough.  i added corn, extra garam masala and extra cayanne.  definitely worth trying again.

These became a great hit at the party.  Everyone loved them.  They have a slight hint of that notorious Indian spice and the pepper gives it a nice punch.  I recommend this recipe for others who are into experimenting with spipes.  
Con: They take quite some time and slaving over a hot stove.  (But it's worth the effort).

I never review a recipe without making it exactly as written.  When I served those we liked them with a 31/2 star.  So we played with it and this is what we came up with.  I added 1/4 cup minced onion, 2 cloves of garlic, about 1 teas. of Italian herbs and 1/2 cup parm cheese.  Wow now we loved them.  I still make it the original way but with the added onion and garlic too.

We didn't care for the flavors in this at all. I had no problems at all with them falling apart-they actually held up beautifully, maybe because I don't own a masher & just use my hand mixer. I thought they were flavorful, just didn't care FOR the flavor. It did help to dip them in ketchup:) Made for Recipe Group.

This is a wonderful recipe! Easy and healthy. I had no potatoes so substituted them for cauliflower. Turned out great! Will make again for sure.
