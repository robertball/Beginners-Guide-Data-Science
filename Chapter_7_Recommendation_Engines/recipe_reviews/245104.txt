My family loved this. Don't waste time separating the flesh from the skin, instead, throw the whole thing (minus the stem and the seeds) in the blender after it has baked in the oven. 
Another tip: Microwave the kabocha for 5 minutes before halving it. It makes it a bit easier to cut.

Really good base recipe, I strayed a little bit with the curry paste, I used curry cubes from the Asian grocery store and added some red pepper flakes so my soup had a bit more af an Indian curry/traditional curry flavour but with the coconut milk, lime and ginger still tasted fresh. I will definitely use the recipe again and try to vary it to what ingredients I have on hand

Turned out great. Added purple yams to make it chunky.

Delicious,  curry paste gives just a slight hint of heat , the small amt of ginger adds to a mild asian flavor    Will defininitely make again!

This is a phenomenal recipe.  Both my husband and myself enjoyed it.   I used ginger paste instead of fresh grated ginger, and omitted the cinlantro (personal preference).  It was absolutely delicious.  I will be making this again for sure.

This was fantastic, the perfect fall soup with amazing flavor at every bite. I followed the recipe except I used 2TB of curry paste instead of 3. Next time I'll go full with on as I could stand for it to be spicier, it was flavorful but not at all spices. Great first time trying kabocha squash, will be doing this one again.

I picked up a Kabocha squash and found this recipe.  It was easy to make, but I made an error in judgement and decided to use up some Thai-Ginger vegetable stock that I had in the cupboard for ages.  Because it also had thai curry seasonings, the soup was way too spicy- bad move!  Next time, I will only use the chicken broth per the recipe and maybe dial back the curry paste from 3 TBLS to 2TBLS.  I cooled it down by adding more coconut milk the next day, and also served it over jasmine rice.  The flavor was great - aside from me over-seasoning it; my hubby & I liked it over the rice better than by itself.  Will definitely make again!
**Update:  I made it again- per the recipe and it was delicious!

We bought this squash not knowing what to do with it and a recipe search yielded this recipe which is now one of my favourite soup recipes (if not my fav)! Flavour was amazing (has a great kick) and it just got better through the week as we ate it. Delicious!

INCREDIBLE!!!  I love kabocha, garlic and ginger, coconut and lemon!!!  I never would have thought to put them together.  Brilliant!!!!  I ate three big bowls of it before I could stop!  I don't eat spicy food so I omitted the curry paste and it was still amazing.  Also, I doubled the recipe, though I only had one can of coconut milk, but it was enough.  I baked the kabocha for an hour, which turned out to be a bit too long because it was mush by then.  At that point it's hard to separate the skin, so I'll bake it for less time in the future.  I'll be making this again very soon!

I didn't have red curry paste so I used 2 t sriracha instead.  First bite was good and then we could feel the spice in the back of our throats.  Really good and decided it's a perfect soup for a head cold.  Bought some reed curry paste so I'll be prepared next time around.
