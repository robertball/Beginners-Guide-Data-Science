I made it exactly as written. I questioned the 1/4 cup of sugar,  but added it in. It was sickeningly sweet. It was probably ten times too much sugar. I looked at other recipes, and they called for 1/4 teaspoon of sugar. I used the remaining dough for an apple/dessert pizza. The dough itself was a nice crust, only so sweet it was gross with pizza toppings.

This pizza dough isn't at all sweet to me or to anyone else I know who's tried it. Still my favorite thin crust, and I'm glad most of you agree that it's good.

I altered the sugar to 1 teaspoon and pre-baked  my crust and it came out great !!!  It was thin  and textured with a crispy crust.  Will definitely use this again.

This was a great crust and easy. Only down fall I have is 1/4 cup of sugar was a to sweet! I think next time I will  only put a table spoon as I seen others call for around that. But other than that it fluffed up great..made enough for 2 pizza! I sure can’t complain about anything else. ??

I followed the directions perfectly and added Italian cheese season!  So yummy but wonder if prebaking it would be better before you add all your toppings!

This is so awesome tasting did not change a thing except let it rise until it doubled about 90 minutes. The crust was so crispy and I pre-baked it for 8 minutes then topped with all toppings and returned to oven for 10 minutes.

Just sprinkle with garlic powder and olive oil the outside edge to pre-bake crust for about 6 minutes
