I used parchment paper instead of waxed paper and candied cherries in place of Maraschino cherries (not as soggy).  I had a hard time getting the whites to stiffen, but adding a few pinches of salt and some cream of tartar did the trick. Yum!

These taste so good! I made them with mini eggs as it was close to Easter, in stead of  using the cherries.

Word to the wise: Do not use the wax paper, just use non stick baking pans. I had so much smoke coming from my oven while making these because the wax paper burned. Cookies were saved.
