I had leftover beets roasted in olive oil, thyme and salt and pepper (I roasted too many for Borscht). From there I followed the recipe exactly.  Man these are amazing.  It's a week later and I can't get enough.  I will be making this recipe for everyone!

This salad is a keeper! I steamed fresh organic beets in my instapot.  So easy and quick! The flavors really go through if you make it the day before you serve it.

This is a simple and yummy recipE. If you like wilted onions put beneath beets and adddressing or first toss beets in dressing and then add to beets and toss. Allow to sit at least one hour.

I used this recipe as a starting point for roasting and pickling golden beets. Besides the beets, I changed the balsamic and wine vinegar to the white variety. Perfect!

I didn’t have the time I would have liked to let the beets and brine come together and found this recipe. It was a great substitute that didn’t take days to properly pickle the beets

My daughter ate it all before I even got to try any. That tells me all I need to know.
