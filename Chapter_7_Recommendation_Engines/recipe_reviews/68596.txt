This is one of our time favorites!!! Usually just make 2 NY strips but I double the gravy..you definetly want the extra. Heres how I do it...
Season steaks, fry for 5 min. each side in a little olive oil, take steaks out.  Add 2 cups water, then add 2 packets of brown gravy mix. Stir well, add 1/2 cup heavy cream, peppercorns (about 10), 2 teaspoons vinegar. Bring to a simmer and add the steaks back in.  Simmer for about 10 min.  We made no yolk dumpling noodles with it.  Plate the noodles add steak and gravy over it.  Yummo!!!

This recipe is an A+! I just made it. Didn't have cream so added sour cream and decided to throw in some mushrooms. Oh and I broiled the steaks. Fantastic!!! Awesome recipe thanks.

My family loved this recipe.  The only thing that I changed for my husband was switching the peppercorn for regular pepper.  It made it easier for my little ones to eat.  Also...definitely double the gravy.  Yummy!

I omitted the vinigar and the white wine, substituted both for a dry Red wine. Tasty, and very similar to the flavors of the sauce used at Outback Steak house for dipping the Lamb Chops. YUM!So Easy! Thank you.

This was good. I had to simmer it a bit to bring down the strong vinegar taste. To make the peppercorn flavoring stronger I crushed a few peppercorns to add long with the whole peppercorn.

Really good, added mushrooms and used fat free half and half, little bit of kitchen bouquet.  We'll be doing this one again, quick & easy.

Not really what I expected....the peppercorns didn't give the gravy much flavor.  If I made again I would omit peppercorns and vinegar and maybe add some mushrooms.

I really shouldn't even rate this because I changed it so much. I just used it as inspiraton. Used the heavy cream and white wine but I used Better than Bouillon beef au jus starter, some gravy master and some Montreal steak seasoning with ground pepper instead of whole peppercorns. I added some milk and butter to smooth it out and thickened it with a little corn starch mixed with cool water and poured into the gravy. It's pretty good over mashed potatoes and with steak on the grill.

Really good and quick but did taste processed. But if you love brown gravy mix (which I don't normally eat), you will love this.

This was delicious and so quick and easy.  Didn't add the peppercorns - don't like them.  This would be good on almost any steak.  We marinated and grilled ours. It was also excellent on the mashed potatoes.  My 19-month old kept asking for "more gravy."  I'm spoiled; I won't eat steak without it.

I was very happy with the outcome of the gravy. I added red peppercorns and simmered the gravy for a longer time to soften the black corns. I’ll definitely use this recipe again.

I only made the gravy to add to wiener schnitzel, but it was a huge hit.  High School German project to make the dish, and I insisted to my son that the gravy would be the real star, and I was right.

If you don't have any gravy mix, you can make some with the following:

1/4 cup corn starch
1 Tablespoon Beef Boullion granules
Pepper to taste
garlic powder to taste

Mix this all together, then follow the rest of the recipe.  The gravy is TO DIE FOR!  The small splash of white vinegar just makes it!

I didn't want to waste an entire bottle of wine for just one TB.  I used  Red wine vinegar and  thought the out come was fine.  I also cooked the steaks in butter and Olive Oil , put on a plate to keep warm, then deglazed the pan with a bit of beer (we DID have one of those open. I added the prepared gravy and mushrooms to the pan, cooked long enough to heat the mushrooms thru then put the steaks and accumulated juice back in to coat.
