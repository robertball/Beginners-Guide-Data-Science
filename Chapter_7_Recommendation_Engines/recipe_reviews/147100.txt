As other reviews had suggested, I poured about 7 ounces of chicken broth over the top of the dish before baking it.  I also added a little bit of fresh dill.... tasted GREAT (with a little bit of salt, too).  To help make sure the potatoes and chicken were fully cooked, I sliced the potatoes thinly AND sliced my chicken breast halves in half.  I admit that after I cooked the chicken at 350 for 45 minutes, I still had to increase the temp to 400 for an additional 30 minutes!  I have plenty of squash in my garden, and I'm always looking for different recipes to use them in so they don't go to waste!  It seemed to be a hit with the hubby and kids.  I'll be making this again, experimenting with different herbs and spices!

After reading previous reviews I decided to marinate the chicken in Italian dressing to add flavor, I also added a little bit of chicken broth at the bottom of the pan.  I cooked as directions said exactly otherwise, after 1 hour in the over my chicken was still completely raw in the middle, so I upped the oven to 400 for another 20-30min.  The pototoes were still hard so I had to throw them out, my chicken was dried out, about the only thing that was good was the squash.  I served with sauteed asparagus.  I might try again but change it up a lot, otherwise I didn't like this at all.

I changed the recipe slightly. I seasoned the veggie with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. I also added red onion slices. I layered the veggies left out the chicken and cooked according the recipe. I mixed canned chicken, shredded cheese and Italian seasoning. In the last 10 minutes of cooking I added the chicken mixture to the top of the veggies. Turned out pretty good.

Surprisingly good. My chicken had not completely defrosted so I sliced it thin to help make sure it cooked through. I pretty much followed the recipe as written, but had a hard time fitting everything in a 2-quart dish so I used a larger dish.

Yes it is a little bland.  I am planning on trying to marinate the chicken next time.  I also added chicken broth, I figured it couldn't hurt.  But it is a satisfying and healthy and I will definately make this again and would recommend it to a friend.

It was okay. The flavor was pretty bland and it turned out really dry. I ended up having to add about 3 cups worth of chicken broth.

It needs to be cooked a lot longer.  It was also pretty bland.  Disappointed.
