Depending on where you live - baking times change - 

Pay attention to the TURN OFF THE OVEN part

I live in Indiana where there is a lot of moisture so I leave these for 20 minutes - you'll want to play with that.

I Make these once a week    The new idea to turn off oven works like a charm   While visiting my boys in college - my youngest asked me to add Parmesan so I sprinkled a bit on before I put it in the oven.   He enjoyed it

It was pretty good.  I am always looking for new healthy side dishes.
Need to make sure the pan isn't too crowded for every leaf to crisp nicely.

One thing I would mention is that 20 is way too long for a single batch.  Mine burned after 15 minutes.  Not nearly as good when they are burnt.

Baking while the oven was off is a bit of brilliance... not only quick, but it better avoids over heating. I added grated Parmesan cheese before baking which worked just fine.
