Hubs SAID he liked his salad but frankly, it sounded weak.  But then again, he didn’t top his with the blue cheese dressing because he doesn't care for it.  He used Hidden Valley Ranch.  He skipped the avocado because he hates it.  And he, without any deliberation, chose to exclude the crumbled blue cheese because, you got it, he hates it.  He has no idea what he was missing.  Who wants a salad that’s “just all right?”   First, right off the bat I made my own blue cheese dressing rather than using some inferior bottled stuff.  I made a small batch of  “Absolutely the BEST Rich and Creamy Blue Cheese Dressing Ever!,” also on AR, and it was so good it probably would have made ANY green salad better.  I used a creamy Gorgonzola, an Italian blue cheese. I used red-ripe Roma (plum) tomatoes and a good amount of bacon – which, of course, remember, more is always better.  As for the chicken, I didn’t bother to grill it when I had perfectly cooked rotisserie chicken breast to slice up. A simple and simply delicious salad, easy to throw together, particularly if you make a good blue cheese dressing ahead of time and take the short cut of a rotisserie chicken.

Great salad, but an absolute MUST is making your own dressing.  Not to have freshly made blue cheese dressing would be a sin.  Use "Absolutely the BEST Rich and Creamy Blue Cheese Dressing Ever!" recipe found on AR.  Your family and guest will rave about this salad.

Nice take on a classic cobb salad! This was a great way to use up some leftover grilled chicken I had on hand.  I did up the amount of bacon - who doesn't love bacon, right?  And I added an additional hard boiled egg. Like others, I opted to make my own blue cheese dressing and my favorite by far is "Absolutely the BEST Rich and Creamy Blue Cheese dressing" from this site and the title is very fitting.  Since my husband is a die hard ranch dressing fan I opted to use "Chef John's Ranch Dressing" - also from this site.  This made for a great throw together weeknight meal that turned out fabulous. Great served with warm crusty bread.

I added some broccoli and mushrooms with this summertime salad.  Nothing like blue cheese dressing on a chicken salad.

This was just not good.  Way too much blue cheese.  I LOVE blue cheese but blue cheese in the dressing and more blue cheese in the salad, overpowered everything else.  If I were to make this again using my own tweaks, I'd leave the blue cheese out of the salad and rely on the dressing to provide that element.  I did make the AR Blue cheese dressing too btw.  The chicken was great.
