I was disappointed in this recipe.  The cake was very dry and seemed rather blah.  I won't make it again.

My sons and husband really liked this just the way it was. I thought it was a little dry and needed something. I had some leftover blueberries so I made blueberry sauce from this site to drizzle over it and that made it amazing.

Only thing I did different after reading other reviews, was to downsize so many dishes was, put all dry ingredients in a bowl and mixed, put a well in center and added all wet ingredients except for blueberry mixture. Blended well then layered in bundt pan. Turned out perfect, super moist and only 2 bowls to clean up!!!

I like this recipe.  It came out great the first time I made it, but the 2nd time I made it, it wouldnt release from the bundt pan. So now I am going to try it in a single layer pan. I used extra blueberries and and mixed them into the batter, then topped with strrusel as directed. The streusel is really good and its a great use for blueberries.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  Just went to pick more fresh blueberries to make it again.  I added extra blueberries (1/2 cup)..more is always better!!
