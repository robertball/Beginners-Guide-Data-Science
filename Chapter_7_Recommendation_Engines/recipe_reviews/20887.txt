My kids love buffalo chicken anything. What I usually do is pound the chicken thin, season with salt and pepper (and sometimes paprika and red pepper), fry them in butter. Meanwhile I toast bread or prepare buns and spread blue cheese or ranch dressing on one side of the bun. When chicken is done I blot it dry and then coat both sides with heated hot sauce. (These are usually a little drippy) Garnish with veggies and serve!

I thought these were really good, but I wish the chicken had absorbed more of the flavor from the hot sauce.  Maybe marinating like other reviewers have suggested would help.  I didn't have any of the green sauce, so I just used Frank's since that's all I had.  I served this on fresh ciabatta bread with some herbed mayo. Made for a good lunch. Thanks Lisa.

Although very hot, I did enjoy it.  However, my girlfriend almost dumped me for serving her something that hot.  Next time I think I'll use half the amount of hot sauce.

I liked the idea of this recipe, but didn't have all the ingredients.  I mixed 2 T melted butter and 1/4 Crystals Hot Sauce together.  I marited the chicken breasts about 15 minutes and then grilled.  I topped with more sauce.  Next time I may try broiling in the sauce, but I never have any luck with broiling.

Chicken was moist, but the flavor was disappointing, basically just hot sauce on chicken.

I used Wingman buffalo wing sauce instead of the hot sauces.  I completely forgot about the paprika so I'll have to try that next time.  Add Ranch dressing on the bun and it tastes just like the Buffalo Ranch Chicken Sandwich at Chili's.  I also add a little extra buffalo sauce to the bun.  If the sauce gets on the pan while cooking, it will smell really bad, but tastes wonderful.

This recipe was really easy to do, but it wasn't hot enough for me....if you want it hot let the chicken sit in the mixture for awhile and soak up the sauce.  Will make this recipe again.

I love hot sauce and have made this a few times. Usually, I don't even make a sandwich out of it. I just eat the chicken by itself.  Very quick and easy. I prefer to use Louisiana hot sauce, its a little less peppery and very cheap to buy.

I used this recipe as a base.  I fried my chicken breast, then coated in Frank's Hot Sauce to which I added 2-3 tbsp of melted butter. No broiling here, since I never have any luck with broiling.  Of course, mine was messier and I just had to add blue cheese and blue cheese dressing on top!  Thanks Lisa for a great chicken sandwich!  My hubby has requested this for lunch the last two weekends in a row!

This was great even without being put in a sandwich.  The chicken was delicious eating all by itself with a side dish of rice and a veg.  Thanks for sharing.

Good recipe. But what's the purpose of the paprika? Shouls you use the more piquant Hungarian paprika or the regular run-of-the-mill stuff?

This is a great idea for a quick meal.  I did not make these into sandwhiches, instead using bone-in split chicken breasts.  Also, I used Franks's Buffalo wing sauce instead of the hot sauce combo.  I grilled the breasts and served with blue cheese dressing on the side.  My family really enjoyed this meal.  4 starts because I used a bottled sauce.

we had this last night.  It was ok, but not the taste I was looking for.  I used Ken's buffalo sauce instead of the hot sauces, so maybe if I'd followed the recipe I would have liked it better.  Will probably try again.

This was an excellent recipe!  I added a little margerine to the chicken while it was cooking to give a more authentic buffalo taste.  Frank's hot sauce is an absolute must.  You won't even need the green pepper sauce.

I used Frank Jr. Red Hot sauce (half of a 12 oz. bottle).  I marinated the chicken with the hot sauce and paprika.  Then broiled it as called for. I also put a slice of Swiss cheese on each breast towards the end of the cooking time. I used French bread instead of the baguette. We also spread some ranch on the bread. It was really good. I would definitely use this recipe again!

Very good! I left out the onion. Per other reviews, I pounded the chicken breasts down a bit. Next time I think I'd do it even more.

Very easy, and very quick! I just used Frank's wing sauce because that's all I had. I recommend flattening the chicken breasts though---makes it a little easier to eat the sandwiches---and putting on more buffalo sauce after removing them from the oven. I buttered the buns then dipped the sandwich in bleu cheese dressing rather than putting it on the bun. Also, I'm dieting and this was nice and low fat!

Yummy! This is easy enough to throw together on a weeknight. One suggestion would be to pound the chicken a little to make it thinner. Sometimes my chicken breasts are huge and that makes the sandwich a bit awkward to eat.

Great idea.  I cut the red pepper sauce with margarine (about 1:1) to tone it down for the kids, and they love it!

Made as written and after doing so I have a suggestion. You lose a lot of the hot sauce once the chicken starts cooking and releasing its juices.  So, if you were to partially cook the chicken first , drain it, and then add the hot sauce you will get a better coating on the chicken yielding more flavor and heat. All in all we enjoyed this though and it is one I will make again.
