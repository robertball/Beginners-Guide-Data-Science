I want to add something, it is super important to very thoroughly coat the semolina with the butter before adding the yogurt. The layer of butter around the semolina grains will prevent the gluten from binding with the addition of yogurt. Yogurt has water in it which activates the binding nature of gluten, making a dense, impenetrable cake.
