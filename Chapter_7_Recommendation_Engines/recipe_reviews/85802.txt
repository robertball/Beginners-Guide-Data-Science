I wanted to note... a little late, but better late then never, add between 2-4 cloves of garlic. Depending on how much you like. I forgot to add that in when I submitted the recipe.
Glad ya'll liked it!

Great recipe!!! I will definitely make again! I omitted the pine nuts and artichokes because I didn't have any and I added 2 or ts of minced garlic. I ended up with about 1 cup of pesto and tossed it with a (cooked) 1 lb. box of campanelle pasta, sauteed baby bella mushrooms and some extra sun-dried tomatoes. There were about 4-5 generous servings.  I'd like to make this again and include the pine nuts & artichokes. This would also be great with roasted eggplant/zucchini and broccoli or paired with grilled chicken. This is a dish that's impressive enough for company, but also quick & easy so it's perfect for everyday eating, too!

The first time I made this, I used dry tomatoes, instead of the oil-packed ones, which made it too dry to toss with pasta. I spread it on a thick, whole-grain pizza crust, top it with crumbled feta cheese, artichoke heart chunks, sun-dried tomatos, and maybe a few Calamata olives. Bake it for eighteen minutes, or until the cheese starts to brown, then remove it and let it sit for 10 min.
That's GOOD pizza!

My sister and boyfriend (both against all things green) loved this. I made a few minor changes to pacify my lactose intolerant system. Instead of Parmesan, I used nutritional yeast and replaced the feta (often made with cow's milk in the US) with crumbled goat cheese. I also didn't have quite 2 cups of basil, so I put a little extra tomatoes in instead. I left the final product a little chunkier so that I could add it to pasta. I tossed the pesto with penne pasta and wine-sauted (savignon blanc) mushrooms for an oh-so-delicious dish that I served with baked chicken.   I think I'll make a double batch next time to freeze. I've read up on freezing pesto and the best I've seen is to fill ice cub trays with the pesto and top with plastic wrap (so that it touches the pesto) and freeze. Once frozen, put the cubes in a freezer bag and use as necessary. I can't wait to try it!

This is the best pesto I've ever made!  I used it for the Pesto Cheesy Chicken Rolls.  Wow!  It was awesome by itself and spectacular in the chicken.  Thanks!

Excellent!!  I took another reviewer's advice and used it on pizza as a sauce covered with feta cheese, fresh grated Parmesan cheese, and artichokes.

One of the best pestos I have ever made!  ...although red and green doesn't mix to make a very pretty color.  I didn't have any parmesan cheese so I used a vintage white cheddar cheese in place along with feta and it worked great.  Also used garlic powder since I didn't have any fresh and I replaced pine nuts with toasted walnuts because thats what I had on hand.  Definitely worth a try!

LOVED THIS!!!  This is the best pesto I've ever eaten!  Minor changes:  added 4 garlic cloves, used dry sun-dried tomatoes, used marinated artichoke + a little (~2T) of the juice to make up for the dry tomatoes, goat cheese instead of feta, 1/8c parmesan, 1/8c nutritional yeast, almost 1/4c pine nuts topped off with walnuts.  The flavor was excellent!  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

This is a very good recipe. I didn't use any artichoke heart (I wasn't sure if I needed fresh or canned, and, either way, I didn't have any on hand), and  I made it with the dry sun-dried tomatoes with a little extra olive oil. It came out thick but very tasty. Just realize, a little goes a long way with this sauce. I made an entire 16 oz whole wheat pasta and ended up using only (roughly) half or less of this sauce. I also didn't need much salt or pepper either - the feta cheese, parmesan, and tomatoes added their own flavor.

Fabulous! Left out the artichoke as I didn't have any. Two large garlic cloves definitely added some zest.
Took me ten minutes to assemble even though I had to go out and pick the basil.

This was a great recipe. I ended up using it to make stuffed shells and stuffed mushrooms. For the shells I added ricotta cheese. Then for the mushrooms I used the stems of the mushrooms and some seasoned breadcrumbs. I also added garlic to the overall mix.

I thought is was good, make sure to add the garlic.  I thought it needed a little bit more flavor, but that could be easily done with how you use it.  I used it with shrimp, but I think in a pasta, on a portobello or on a pizza would be wonderful.  I have leftover pesto so tomorrow I'll make a pizza and top it with artichoke hearts, sundried tomatoes, feta, kalamata olives and see how that is.

followed the recipe exactly on this one, and the basil seemed a bit overpowering.. not sure if i just got a really good batch or what, but i amped up a few other of the ingredients (feta, artichoke, sundried tomatoes, garlic, ended up using close to 6 cloves) to my taste and squeezed in half a fresh lemon, and it came out amazing :)

Delicious! I made this for a pasta salad. I put it over bowtie pasta with some fresh mozzarella balls, grape tomatoes, and more parm & pine nuts (served chilled).

Very, very good tasting recipe.  Don't forget to add garlic (I usually add to taste as I love my garlic!).  This goes well over pasta, on pizza, or as a dip for bread.  The feta imparts some saltiness to the dish so check before you season with more salt.  All in all a fantastic dish!

I loved this recipe. I think I'm going to start an herb garden so I'll always have the basil on hand. I used some fresh tomatoes, diced, and some minced garlic, but it was really good.

Absolutely wonderful. The only minor change I made was to add marinated artichoke heart quarters, since we always have that on hand. I also used romano cheese instead of parmesan, because I happened to be in Whole Foods and they had an incredible romano on sale. The key to good pesto is the ingredients - don't skimp on the quality of your cheese or olive oil! This is the best pesto recipe I have tried. We tossed it with penne for a quick weekday meal and it was just lovely. The flavor is so smooth and balanced, it would also make a wonderful dip. Just clipped a ton of basil to make more!

Really tasty... I added ALOT MORE OLIVE OIL,1/2 tsp kosher salt,1/2 tsp black pepper, and 1 tsp.chopped garlic to the food processor.  Everyone loved it.  I will get more fresh basil at the farmer's market and make more!

This was my first time making a pesto sauce, and I absolutely loved it!  I have never been a huge pesto fan, but this changed my mind.  So simple and delicious.  I had no artichokes on hand, that was the only ingredient I omitted.  Served with spaghetti, extra pine nuts, and sundried tomatoes. YUM! :)

Super easy recipe! Took me maybe 10 or 15 minutes total to finish. I had to alter it a bit because I was running low on basil. (My basil plants did not do well this year.) I simply added more sun-dried tomatoes and made it more of a "red" pesto.

This recipe was tasty, definitely a keeper.  I tried it on pizza dough, but I didn't like how the flavor and texture of the bread took away from the pesto. I think pasta would be much better with it, maybe even potatoes. I didn't have sun-dried tomatoes, so I also added more olive oil, and used sunflower seeds instead. Great recipe, thanks for sharing.

This was wonderful!  Even my picky husband and 3-year-old daughter LOVED it!  I used it in a Chicken Pesto recipe that another reviewer recommended from this site and it was great.  I made a large batch of it and froze some for future use.  Wonderful way to use fresh basil from your garden.  Thanks for sharing!

Very tasty.  I used this as a base with some chicken breasts sauted in olive oil, added this sauce and 1/2 cup chicken broth and served over pasta. Very flavorful!

One of, if not the best pesto recipe I have ever tried-- just a GREAT  combination of flavors. I left out the artichoke hearts but will definitely add them next time. I will be making this one again soon -- thanks!

I added garlic and used dry sun-dried tomatoes. I didn't have artichoke so used extra basil. Substituted the pine-nuts for a handfull of soya flavour snack-mixed nuts - tasted great!

Used this recipe on baguette, pizza sauce and in pasta. All round amazing recipe. Just remember to add the garlic, that makes the world of difference.

6/2019 - This was very good, tasted fresh and healthy - I used about 4 cloves of garlic in the mix.  Looked beautiful on the pasta, too.  Maybe lacking as much flavor as I like, possibly needs more salt.

Delicious!  Delicious!  Sautéed fresh green onions with sliced mushrooms, & diced fresh tomato.  Poured these cooked veggies onto 1/2lb cooked mini farfalle along with the pesto sauce!  Topped with quartered pepperoni slices & mixed again.  Loved it!
