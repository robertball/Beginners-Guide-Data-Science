This is the original contributor of the recipe (although my handle has changed). I had not used this recipe in years and decided to see if it was still here. I have to say I was rather shocked at the amount of butter myself! I took a reviewer's suggestion and substituted chicken broth for half of it, and that was great. Maybe you could even do 3/4 broth. My kids love this kind of chicken and its easy to leave the sauce off for picky ones. Enjoy!

I made this last night--it was a huge hit at my house.  The sauce is excellent--tangy, zesty, summery, and creamy--it's a refreshing change!  Because the breasts are breaded, they soak up the savory flavor.  *Hint*: I substituted italian-seasoned/garlic bread crumbs and two stalkes of freshly chopped green onions for the plain bread crumbs and chives, which tasted scrumptious!

This dish also reheats great!

Delicious, but greasy.  After frying the chicken in oil, and then adding a butter sauce this dish was too greasy.  However, it tasted great!  Next time I'm going to try grilling my chicken and then pouring the sauce over to cut out some of the grease. Yum!

I would give this 5 stars the way I made it.  After reading all the reviews, I changed things up a bit.  I cooked the chicken as according to the recipe, although I seasoned with pepper before breading.  For the sauce: first, I deglazed the pan (there were burnt parts of the breading, and NOTHING to drain), and got that clean.  Then, I added about 1/3 cup chicken broth and 3 tablespoons of butter, got that boiling and reduced it a bit.  Then added 2 tablespoons of lime juice (not from a lime), then chives, and the dill.  Prior to making the sauce, I mixed some flour with some water, made about a tablespoon's worth of the flour paste to thicken the sauce.  I added that last, and let it all boil for like a minute.  Then, I put the chicken back in and served.  Nice thick TASTY sauce.  Not too limey.  The dill flavor came out nicely.  It all blended SO well.  YUM!  Will definitely make again.

We loved this: Even the kids ate everything. My teen-aged daughter loves chicken piccata and she said she liked this even more. Very easy to prepare. The one change I made was to forego breading and just pounded the breasts. Used bottled lime juice as I didn't have any fresh ones.

This was good, but not what I expected.  The sauce is basically just butter with some dill and a tiny bit of lime juice.  The recipe says (after removing cooked chicken to a platter) to drain grease from the skillet---there is none left!  Two tablespoons of olive oil get soaked up pretty quickly by the breaded chicken!  The lime juice sizzles and almost immediately evaporates (in the form of steam) before you can add the butter.  So you end up with dill flavored butter--not a bad thing, but not quite what I was hoping for.

the chicken was excellent, but i've gotta go with queenmab on the sauce - way way WAY too much butter! it overpowered everything, including the lime - which isn't easy to do!
i subbed saltine cracker crumbs for the bread crumbs - just the right amount of salt built in!
will make again, but will play with sauce - i think i'll knock back the butter to two tablespoons and add 3 tblsp of honey to soften the lime. not bad but needs work.

I made this last night for my husband who is not real fond of chicken.  Well, he absolutely LOVED this recipe.  I had several key limes so used three of them and oh was it good!!  I too am watching my weight but I will not change this recipe - I would suggest you use a little more lime juice.  I served it with spicy yellow rice and my husband loved that too.  It is definitely a keeper and he wants it again next week!

This recipe came to me as the recipe of the day, and I made it for my boyfriend and my roomate and they both loved it.  In fact, the following week they asked me to make it again, and I did because I loved it too.  This recipe is quick and easy and tastes great with a ceasar salad and some couscous served on the side!

My family loves this recipe!  Instead of using Chicken Breasts I used Chicken tenders.  It worked very well.  Made it kind of like chicken strips.

First time I made this, I fried the chicken in the olive oil.  We found it too greasy.  The next time I made this recipe, I followed the recipe completely except I baked the chicken in the oven for about 10 minutes @ 350.  After the chicken was cooked, I melted the butter, but only 3 tbsp & squeezed the lime and then drizzled it over the cooked chicken breasts.  As a final touch, I sprinkled the herbs on the chicken.  Much better and not nearly as greasy.    Very tasty and the lime flavour was wonderful.

Excellent, tho’ I didn’t follow the recipe precisely.  Hubs and I try to watch carbs where we can, so I coated the chicken breasts in almond flour rather than bread crumbs.  (I’m relatively new to this but it’s delicious!)  Not called for in the recipe, but I seasoned the chicken as well as the flour well, with salt, pepper and garlic powder.   Lemon juice was more compatible than lime with what I was serving with the chicken, and I deglazed the pan with some white wine in addition to the juice.  Reduce that to just a couple/few tablespoons (for 2 servings), then over low heat swirl in the butter (little by little or your sauce will break) for a luxurious sauce.  Couldn’t ask for a lovelier, more inviting presentation or a more delicious entrée.

This was absolutely delicious, but I did change a few things.  First I used full boneless breasts and baked them (instead of frying) at 400 degrees for 20 minutes I sprayed the tops with PAM Olive Oil to brown the tops.  Secondly, I used 1/2 of the lime juice and (like many others) used only used 3 tbsp. of butter in the sauce.  It was great.  I paired the dish with couscous cooked in lime juice (1 lime) and chicken stock.  I mixed in honey (2 tbsp) and fresh mint from the garden.  My 9 year old said it was "crazy good".

WOW...Refreshing and tasty dish!!! I love the lime in this.  I've don't think I've ever had the combination of chicken and lime in a dish..didn't know what I was missing. I did scale the recipe down to 2 servings (to try out) and doubled the sauce. Will make this again!

This recipe was wonderful! My husband always loves when I try something different. We both loved the citrus taste. I cooked the chicken breasts partially in a skillet until brown, then transfered to the oven to cook for 20-25 minutes on 250 degrees. In a separate pan,  I sauteed mushrooms, onions and a pepper. After they were brown, I began the lime sauce. Just before serving, I transfered mushrooms, onions and peppers to sauce and served over chicken. Absolutely Wonderful!! Thanks for a GREAT Meal!!!!

For those of you who love the flavor of cilantro, subtitute 1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh cilantro for the dried dill. Yum! Definitely reduce the butter ;-) I used panko crumbs instead of bread crumbs. Another yum! Thanks for the recipe idea, SMLUCY!

I exchanged some of the butter for chicken broth, and the result wasn't so good. I also turned down the heat before I added the lime juice so as not to have it evaporate, but it still didn't  have much flavor. This recipe was ok to be honest, but I had really high hopes for it.

Just made this tonight and it was wonderful!  I love lime and was so happy to find a recipe for chicken with lime that didn't include garlic or curry!  I didn't have any chives, fresh or otherwise, so I used cilantro and I cut the butter in half and tripled the lime juice!  Marvelous!  I'll be adding this as one of my "regular" menus

I thought this was very flavorful.  But I agree that frying it, and then pouring a butter sauce on it, is by far too much grease.  I even halfed the butter, and used chicken stock for the rest.  I think next time I will brown the chicken in the pan for a few, but finish baking it.  Then top with sauce.  My husband thought it was very good.  If you do fry, I suggest serving this a light side, such as a baked potato, or a salad.  I ended up doing a creamy orzo dish, and thought it was too much.  Try this chicken though, can be well adapted to your taste, and is a great addition to the recipe box!

This is a great recipe.  It was flavourful AND easy.  I served mine w/ quinoa on the side and they went together nicely.  I'm reducing the butter next time but only so I can look my weight loss coach in the eye.  Thank you.

This recipe turned out great.  I used lemon instead of lime because that's all I had.  That substitution worked just fine.    I agree w/ other reviewers who say it's greasy.  Next time I will bake my chicken at 425 for about 25 minutes, and then use the sauce over it.    I used 3 tablespoons of butter and it was great.

The chicken was good, I baked mine at 425 for 25 minutes. I dipped my chicken in olive oil and lime juice and added some lime zest to the bread crumbs. I did not care for the lime sauce but my husband and daughter liked it.

For flavor I suppose this gets 3 stars, but this is not chicken with lime sauce. This is chicken with lime butter. Not sure why a person would go to the trouble of fixing the chicken in healthy olive oil, and then pour a large amount of greasy, high fat, butter over it. Lime and a few herbs added to butter, do not a sauce make.

Wow, what a great sauce. Use less butter and/or more lime juice. I think I'm going to try it on baked fish. Thank you so much for this recipe. UPDATE:Used this sauce with baked fish...so incredible.  Still using less better for health reasons.

This was very very delicious. i will most certainly make it again. Pounding the chicken was the way to go. They flattened out so much, since i was just making this for two i was able to cut them in half and have enough for lunch the next day. You have earned 5 stars!!

Awesome!  Family loved it!  I seasoned bread crumbs with salt & pepper and added about 1 tsp honey to the sauce (it was too bitter for my liking), but other than that it was fabulous!  Served it with brown rice and veggie mix.  Definitely not a recipe that you'd want to serve with a heavy side dish.  Although it's definitely high in fat, it's also amazing in flavour.  I'll be coming back to this one!

This recipe turned out really good. I used cornbread crumbs and served it over rice with some fresh veggies on the side.

I love this recipe! Definitely one of my fave and will now be one of the regulars at home. My kids couldn't stop raving about it and was even boasting to their dad that he missed a really great lunch!

I have to agree with one of the reviewer that you have to watch the heat. The outside of the chicken might look brown, crisp and all ready but inside it might still be undercook.

I had some parts of the chicken breast that are thin so that's cooked through and through. While, the thick parts, I cooked in the oven for another 3-5 minutes (350 F).

Came out juicy and really beautiful. 

The sauce, you'll have to go by taste. If it's big on the sour side, then add some salt. 

The greasy part might also be true because I only used 3 tbsp butter and it's already more than enough.

If you're not happy with just the lime sauce, you can have gravy with this chicken. The star of this recipe is the chix so just be creative if you're bored by the original sauce.

For me, I think it's simple, tasty, and pretty. For a mother like me, recipes like this make life soooooo easy, so it's a five star for me.

We thought the dish was excellent.  Some reviewers cautioned that it was too greasy, but we didn't think that at all.  After cooking the chicken, I poured out all the oil as suggested.  The lime juice, which I doubled, immediately started boiling, so I continued on with the recipe as written.  Instead of pounding the chicken, I used a needling device.  The resulting chicken was tender enough to cut with a fork.  Served with Company Couscous also on this site.

This was delicious!  I used crushed Ritz crackers in lieu of bread crumbs and waaaaay less butter (actually, margarine) than called for, and it came out perfect!  Just tangy enough--a nice, light citrus flavor.  Mmmm!

Quite good, if a bit fattier than it needs to be.  I used less butter and added a little plain yogurt - that was still tasty.

The sauce is scrumptious! I dipped my chicken in flour, then egg, then breadcrumbs, browned it in the olive oil then trasferred it to a cookie sheet & baked it in the oven on 350 for 20 min. I used 2 limes, 1/2 the amount of butter & some chicken broth when making the sauce, as suggested by others. I will definately make this dish again! Thanks!

What an awesome flavor. The chicken is easy to prepare and the sauce comes together quickly and flawlessly. I doubled the sauce as I like to serve chicken with rice and we love to have enough to pour. Only change I made was the 1/2 the butter (a little less) and use chicken stock for the rest of the juice.

YUM! We loved this dish.  My husband really enjoyed it and had to resist a second big helping.  I used Ritz cracker crumbs like someone before me.  thanks for that idea since I didn't have any bread crumbs either.  I served it with angel hair pasta and asparagus and it made a great meal!
Thanks for this great recipe.

Absolutely delicious!!  Pounding out the breasts made them so tender.  The only thing I'll change next time is reduce the butter--couldn't taste the lime juice enough, but a nice easy and yummy supper-the family all loved it.

My family enjoyed this meal. I liked the lime in the sauce, but it was too buttery for me. Next time I might just spritz the chicken with some lime juice. My mother loved the sauce.

My family loved this recipe.  I made it last week and it was requested again tonight.  I cut the butter in half and added a couple of tablespoons of honey - made the glaze a little sweeter and it coated the chicken better as well.  Great tip on letting the chicken sit on a cooling rack for 10 minutes before frying!  That seems to make a big difference.

I give this a FIVE STAR!! It is very good and refreshing.. before I started making it I read a lot of the reviews and the main thing was about the sauce and too much butter AKA there was a butter taste.. So what I did was added more lime untill i found it to be more of a lime taste then a butter. Not only did I do that I also squeezed a bit of lime over the chicken once it was done so that the lime could really sink into the bread crumbs. It was a family hit!!

This is one of my fav recipes. I cook it at least twice a month. I fry my chicken just till golden brown then put in a oven dish. Make the lime sauce and pour it on top. I cover the chicken with tinfoil and put in  the oven till cooked through. So yummy!

Loved this.  Will make again.

We are gluten free in our house.  So I used a gluten free mix of "bread" crumbs.  Because it was corn based, the chicken has a sort of cornmeal type outside.  This worked for us, but when I make this again, I will exclude the breading/breadcrumb aspect and just pan fry the chicken breasts plain.

Wonderful!  Took the suggestion to make the sauce with 1/2cup chicken broth and 2tbsp of butter.  Used onions instead of chives and the sauce was amazing!  Will make more sauce next time...it ran out before the chicken did.  Thank you!

Excellent flavor.  I have a few changes...cut butter to 2 TBLS and added a heaping TBLS of instant bullion plus 1/2 cup of water (maybe more) and lime juice.  then I thickened with a little cornstarch for a perfect sauce.  Definiately an easy and impressive dish for a "company coming" dinner

Very tasty. I graded the a little bit of the lime to give it that extra zesty citrus flavor and it was awesome. The family liked it and we are adding it to our rotation. Easy to make. I just sliced the chicken breasts in half instead of pounding them, works just fine that way. Doesn't make a lot of sauce but it worked out.

I loved it, but I did make some changes.  I used chicken tenders and pounded them a bit.  I used Italian bread crumbs to cover the chicken.  I used the juice of 2 limes.  Only 2 TBSP butter and no chives or dill but used 1/2c. wine and 1/2 c. chicken broth and onion in strips.  I am going to post a custom version, but I loved it. I think I will double the liquid next time to make more sauce.

Loved this recipe. I have made it twice. I mix in a little panko with regular bread crumbs for more crispyness.  The first time making it I made a single chicken breast and cooked the chicken in the lime sauce for a few minutes because the chicken wasn't quite done and I actually liked it that way better, it gave it more lime flavor.  The second time making it I wished there was more lime flavor and less butter.

AMAZING!  The best chicken breast I have ever had.  I am not that fond of chicken breast but this was so moist and tender and the lime sauce was the perfect touch.  All the others are going in the trasH.  This is the new favorite.  I did add a little flour to the sauce to make it a little thicker but either way I'm sure is good.

This recipe was delicious.  I made it for my husband and daughter and son-in-law and they all raved about how good it tasted.  Needless to say it was completely gone.  I did use half the butter and the sauce was light and tasty.  I recommend it highly.

Unfortunately, we lost 7 chicken breast on this recipe as nobody would finish eating it :( I was initially intrigued by the lime idea but worried about the butter. This is essentially chicken with flavored butter on it; not very good at all.

This was awesome!  Even my husband loved it and he is a very picky eater.  

I used chicken cutlets and Adobo Lemon Pepper seasoning.   Since I did not have eggs on hand I poured a little zesty italian salad dressing over the chicken before coating it with the bread crumbs.

The lime butter sauce was delicious and the chicken was nice and crispy yet tender.

This will be a family favorite for sure.

This recipe is perfect as is. My husband and 17-year-old son would eat it every day if they could. Wonderful flavor! The key is heating the lime first, because I forgot once and put the butter in first - it was not as flavorful.

I got this recipe in the recipe for the day email and thought it sounded pretty good.  Not a big fan of Dill weed but together with the Lime and butter it really complimented each other. I let the butter carmelize a bit and used green onion instead of chives. The whole family loved it and my daughter said she could never eat chicken any other way..LOL  I will definately be making this again. PS: If you drain the chicken onto a papertowel while making the sauce it won't be greasy.

After I had pounded the chicken breasts, my husband called to say he would be late, so I marinated them in add'l lime juice until he got home. We love lime and we loved this recipe! Even before the dishes were washed, husband wanted to know when we could have this again.

This is a great recipe under 30 minutes to prep and cook if you want a fast dinner.  There wasn't a lot of flavor to the sauce.  I did use 2 limes instead of 1 to override all the butter.  Overall, it was good but not great.

I made this and did not change the recipe at all. I think the chicken could have used some salt and pepper. I would make this again but would tweak it to make it a bit more lively.

This has a lot of potential but for our tastes, the lime/dill combo didn't work nor did it produce enough sauce to be nicely drizzled over all 4 breasts.  If I make again, I'll swap out the lime for lemon and use fresh dill.  Could easily be made with cilantro and mexican beer (without dill) for a more Mexican twist.

We really enjoyed this recipe.
I did take hints from previous reviewers and:
- I pounded the breast till they were a cm thick.
- Used crushed crackers as the crumb. In this case half rye and half salted seasame crackers.
- I added seasoning to the crumb, in my case onion powder and caynne powder.
- I used chicken stock in the sauce.

I also added chopped chili peppers to the sauce along with some soy, lime pepper and a little cornflour.

This is on the repeat list.

Amazing recipe. I used tree limes instead of one because i just didnt think one lime would be enough! Three limes wasnt over kill. The dill weed was just perfect. I also used whole chicken breast and pounded them, which made a massive chicken breast but good to go. Easy prep, easy cook, and easy clean up. Will definitely do this again!

This was absolutely DELICIOUS! My very picky boyfriend ate until he was about to burst. I used the recipe for the lime sauce (minus the butter and sub some chicken broth) to marinate the flattened chicken in. Really made everything explode with flavor.

Please remember to pound out the chicken and roll it for thin pieces. Without doing this, your chicken would not be cooked in 3-5 minutes as suggested. The lime butter sauce is a nice taste :) *I was out of chives, but will make it again with it!

This recipe turn out very good. I did make a couple changes though. I used only 1 tablespoon of butter and substituted the rest for chicken broth which in turn made the sauce more watery than intended. The flavor was still good though. Maybe next time I will try to thicken it a bit with corn starch. I didn't have any chives so I omitted those. I could barely taste the dill so next time I will add a little more.

Really enjoyed this recipe!  It was easy and I had all of the ingredients on hand.  Instead of bread crumbs, I used almond meal to make it more paleo friendly.  I also doubled the lime juice and used only 3 T. butter.  I added the chicken stock, as others suggested too.  Delicious!  Mybwhole family liked it!  Thanks for sharing it!

DELICIOUS! Very easy recipe and quite delicious. I didn't have a mallet-type meat tenderizer to pound the breasts thinner so I just used more olive oil and cooked them in the pan longer. I pulled the chicken out & squeezed the lime juice right into the pan, added the rest of the sauce ingredients and voile! I used dried chives and it turned out great anyways.  Served this with Black Bean Cous-Cous Salad (from this site) and the cilantro & lime in that salad was VERY complimentary to this chicken.  My dad stopped by for a visit, had a taste & asked for the recipe, he loved it too!  This will be a staple recipe of mine.

Very good dish a little on the greasy side, be sure to cook chicken at least 15 minutes until fully cooked. Then add your sauce over the top.  Recipe is not very clear.

Totally fantastically finger-licking delicious, but agree with others--less butter! I didn't have chives or dill weed so I chopped up cilantro and 1 large mint leaf... my 3 year old kid who isn't fond of chicken any more gobbled it up and asked for seconds.

This is one of my favorite recipes on this site. It is so flavorful and isn't difficult to make. I admit I don't pound the breasts, I've just cut the thickness of a breast in half. It still is very tender.

This turned out ok - I actually liked it more than I thought I would, but I think the sauce left a little to be desired.  I used egg whites and soft, fresh bread crumbs, one tbsp oil, and replaced the dill with more chives.  The sauce was a little too greasy, but it tasted ok.  I might use this as a stepping stone, maybe add some wine next time.  I think this recipe definitely has potential.

Turned out great.  My revisions: Instead of butter, I used olive oil, mixed with with some lime juice, chopped cilantro, chopped green onions/chives. Placed that on top of the chicken before serving. My BF loved it, he said he like the seasoning, and couldn't believe it was healthy!

Liked this a lot. I seasoned the bread crumbs with a little salt & pepper and garlic powder, and substituted 3 tbsps of chicken broth for 1/2 of the butter (as suggested by others). I also used 2 tbsp bottled lime juice instead of the fresh lime and dry chives as I didn't have fresh. Very yummy.

I used the broth instead of butter as suggested by the author.  The chicken tasted very "limey".  I am still working on modifying this recipe.

i used only 2 tablespoons of butter, 2 limes, dill and chicken stock to make the sauce.  I also lightly dusted the chicken with seasoned flour and quickly browned it in 2 tablespoons of oil.  I returned the chicken to the pan after the sauce was done to finish off the cooking.  The flour also helped to thicken the sauce.  My husband really liked it.  My 2 year old did not.  i think it will taste even better tomorrow after the flavors meld together.  Tastes even better the next day.  The sauce mellows out. My 2 yr old loved it the next day when the lime flavor wasn't as strong.

We really liked this one a lot...the only reason I didn't give 5 stars is I did change up the sauce a bit.  I didn't use quite as much butter and added a little chicken broth and thickened it some.  But the presentation was gorgeous...I loved the green of the chives and the dill.  It was really easy to make this and admittedly I didn't want to cook....

By dredging in brown rice flour, this becomes a wonderful gluten-free recipe. I have made this for a couple of years now, and it is a family favorite!  The fine texture of the rice flour coats the chicken better and results in a finer, quicker overall golden crisp, with less olive oil needed.  I also enjoy the kick of lime, and add a tsp of zest to the juicing step.

I liked this recipe - I was dealing with half frozen chicken breasts so, I did as the recipe said (frying for 3-5 mins of each side) and then baked in the oven at 450 for 1/2 hour. It made the crispiness even better! I used only 3-4 tbs of butter in the sauce, and boiled that with cut up pieces of chives, and squeezed a whole lime into the heated butter. It was awesome. My husband loves it and he suggested we cook this for when we have company.

I made minor changes to the sauce. I used 2 tbsp of butter, half a cup of chicken broth, one juiced lemon, and sauteed leeks. It was AWESOME. Also, I used paper towels to blot the chicken breasts after frying them since there was so much oil. Overall, it turned out delicious and I'll definitely make it again.

I had to give the cook a standing ovation on this. If I can say that it needed anything I would say I would have liked to have tasted a bit more lime in the butter sauce.  The crunch coating lended a beautiful crunch while the pounded chicken was 'butter knife' tender. I moaned for each forkful that went into my mouth.  I can hardly wait til she makes it again.

I really liked this. My 2-year-old son ate 1 1/2 pieces of chicken, so you know it was a hit!  Like other reviewers, I reduced the butter and used broth (hubs has high cholesterol). I didn't have chives or dill so I used garlic and some ground coriander instead.  I also threw in a little white wine to deglaze the pan and subbed bottled lime juice since I didn't have any fresh on hand. I can only imagine how tasty it would've been if I had made it as written, but even with my substitutions it was tender and deliciously lime-y.  I'm so pleased I found this recipe--I was looking for something quick and different to make for dinner and this fit the bill perfectly.  Easy, quick, and super tasty--thank you SMLFISH!

I made this recipe and personally wasn't fond of it. However, one of my guests has been a vegetarian for nearly 7 years and is making a transition into eating meat again and LOVED it. He said he would give it 5 stars.I found it greasy and it hardly tasted of lime. I would personally give it a 2.5.

Just watch out that the temperature of the pan is not too hot when adding the lime because it can evaporate.  I would use more lime and add some pepper but it was a great lite summery type of dish.  I also used panko instead of regular bread crumbs.

We really liked this!  I thought I had limes in the fridge, but turns out they were lemons.  So... I used lime juice from a bottle, which I know isn't as good, but it was still tasty.  Lucky for me there was enough left over for me to take for my lunch tomorrow!

Lime is one of my favorite flavors, but I just wasn't impressed with this dish.  It was good, but I was expecting more flavor.  I liked that it was fast, easy to prepare and didn't require many ingredients, but it just seems that something was needed to give it a little pizzaz.

Very good. Nice flavor. Made a few changes due to health reasons. Seasoned the chicken with onion powder, garlic powder, dill, salt and pepper. I did not bread the chicken, simply grilled in pan and went from there. I used 1/2c chicken stock and 4T brummel and brown. Also added some minced garlic to the pan after the butter. Husband liked it.

I thought this was very good, and my boyfriend thought it was EXCELLENT.  I have been asked to "add it to the rotation." 
I substituted chicken broth for some of the butter, as suggested.  
And I used panko bread crumbs and added salt, parsley, cumin, and pepper.

Excellet dish!  I also did my wife's firm tofu with the chicken and she raved about the flavor as well.  This easy recipe has been added to my "regular rotation".  Except for the pounding, I suspect it would work well for fish too.

Really good with a few mods. Didn't bread the chicken, I rarely do.  Used more lime since we love it.   I also added some white wine and chicken broth, let it reduce, then added only 2 tbsp of butter that was coated in flour which thickened it up a bit.  Will definately make again.

Used panko crumbs to bread chicken...lends just a beautiful crunch....double the sauce for sure, used 6 tbsp butter total kept adding lime until i had reached the perfect balance. *Note: i freeze the juice of limes in an ice cube tray so I always have it on hand. Served with sweet potato fries seasoned with cayenne..perfect match!

This was a GREAT recipe, I can't believe how tasty it was! The only thing is that I didn't have enough 'stuff' to make the sauce and had to add more to make enough for 2 chicken breasts.  I also subed chicken broth for some butter to cut down on fat and that was really tasty.  All in all, great recipe.

It's the dill that really makes it...the smell and the taste, combined with the butter, lime juice, and the tasty breading...it's making me hungry just thinking about it!  The lime adds just enough flavor without being "citrusy," so those who might worry that the chicken becomes too tangy (that was my worry) can relax.  The butter and dill flavors mostly take over - the lime just adds a little something.    I did cut the butter in half and used chicken broth (that's what I had handy) to supplement some of it.  It seemed to work very well, and provided a little extra flavor.  I will definitely recommend using a separate skillet for the lime/butter sauce.  If you put the lime juice in the hot skillet that you just cooked the chicken in, it will immediately cook away and vanish in a puff of steam.  Using a smaller skillet is also recommended, it makes stirring the sauce and drizzling it over the chicken a little easier.  I will definitely be making this again in the very near future!

Excellent crispy tender chicken recipe.  I didn't have bread crumbs so I used bran cereal but with frying in a bit of olive oil it tasted good.  I didn't cut the chicken in half, I just pounded into nice large cutlets.  I LOVE lemons and limes so I used an entire lime even though I halved the recipe.  We didn't think it was over powering.  I served it with an avocado/onion/grapefruit salad and Jo's Rosemary bread (found on this sight).  With a glass of wine it was a wonderful dinner.....thanks for the recipe

This was very good but was a little freaked by frying something then pouring butter over it! It was good but not good for you.  I think I will try the chicken broth idea next time.

Six Tablespoons of butter! Wow! I reduced it to 4 Tbsp and it still a lot of butter. I should have read the other reviews and used chicken broth with 2 Tbsp of butter.

This was so fantastically different! I thought it was so interesting and unlike anything I've ever had before. My husband and I both loved it so much, there were no leftovers. We did 1/4 chicken broth substitution and it was a little buttery...I think 1/2 would be appropriate.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  Something different to do with Chicken.  I did salt and pepper the chicken before coating it as my son would not eat it with the sauce so I didn't want his piece to be too bland.  I oven cooked the chicken for 30 minutes at 350, cut the butter down to 4 TABS and added 3 TABS of white wine.  I decided I wanted a thicker sauce so I added 1/4 cup of milk and a little cornstarch thickener.  I had used what I felt was two small limes worth of juice. It was way tart so I added a squirt of honey to tone it down.  This was even better as left overs!  Will definitely make again.

Love breaded chicken! This was a lovely recipe. Only change was to try to cut calories by following someone's suggestion to 1/2 the amount of butter in the sauce by  cutting it with chicken bouillion (3 TBSP butter / 3 TBSP bouillion). The sauce was the perfect accent to the breaded chicken - 4 min per side on medium was enough. Served with mashed potatoes mixed with sauteed shrooms.

We were extremely pleased with the recipe. The cooking instructions when followed to the tee resulted in an extremly moist chicken. The tangy lime and butter with herbs gave it a nice taste. I am anxious to cook this for other family and friends, I think they would enjoy.

I made this recipe exactly, except I only had three chicken breasts and I also salt and peppered the chicken before breading it.  I though it was great.  My boyfriend raved about how tender it was and also really liked the lime butter. It took me a bit longer to perpare because of having to pound out chicken, but the cook time is quick because of pounding it.

I was surprised at how good this was. The fresh lime juice is the key I believe.  I didn't have chives so used chopped green onions instead.  This is defintely a keeper.  Thank you for sharing.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was good.  I also used the Italian Seasoned crumbs. The olive oil is absorbed very fast and not much left for the juice.  I did add the butter to the pan, chopped green onions and lime juice and let all come together to a nice sauce.  I found it a bit greasy and I will try the chicken broth next time maybe some flour to thicken the sauce? I will try.  It was good and tasted GREAT!  My husband loved it!! Thanks

Too much butter - the sauce is all butter! We expected a bit more flavor - next time I would probably cut the butter and use some chicken broth and use a little extra lime juice. Good recipe to use for left over chicken cutlets.

I loved this recipe!  The lime was a GREAT flavor to have in this, next time I might even add a little more lime. I used Italian style bread crumbs and I baked the chicken instead of frying it and it turned out great. I also used dried chives rather than fresh and it was fine. This would also be great on a white fish or with lobster!

I subbed crushed Ritz for the breadcrumbs and seasoned them really well w/ garlic, pepper, and onion salt.  I also used only about 2/3 of the butter and used chicken tenders.  This was a very nice chicken dish and everyone enjoyed the sauce, I appreciated how subtle the lime juice was, it didn't overpower the chicken at all.  Overall, very yummy, thank you.

I didn't have any bread crumbs, or oats (which I usually use for a substitution), but what I did have was a package of the ChiChi's corn cake mix. I coated the chicken with that. While my daughter first said, what's that funny taste, I've never seen her eat so fast before (except for sweets of course).

Awesome - we have this often. Kids like it as it's "chicken nuggets with SOUR sauce." I like it because it's secretly nicer than chicken nuggets. I double the lime in the sauce and use panko. Works great for company as well. Definitely dry the coating as the recipe directs - what a great tip!

This was really good, and easy too.  Everyone loved it, and couldn't get enough- even my babies (ages 5 and 3).  My husband said to "Let this be a recipe you make again, please."  I loved the lime flavor, and next time I may add more.  I cut the butter down to 4 TBS.  Pounding the chicken makes it so nice and tender.  I had to cook for a little longer than stated though.  Served with brown rice (cooked in chicken broth) and a Caesar salad.

Instead of pounding the chicken breasts out and frying them, I breaded and baked them, using seasoned bread crumbs.  I melted the butter, added lime juice, dill, and chives and poured over the top of the chicken after it came out of the oven.  Delicious!

I make this for my husband and 2 & 3 yr old boys almost weekly.  They all love it.  Very tender.  I cut the pounded out breasts into smaller portion sizes, for ease in serving.  Also, my husband doesn't like lime, so we use lemon.  This recipe is a family favorite at our house.

This was so easy to make and delicious! The lime juice was a little tangy, so I added about a tablespoon of white table sugar which seemed to balance it out fine. A keeper!

I was looking for something a little different to do with chicken breasts. This was a great idea. But as others have said  Ionly used 2 tablespoons of butter, but  Iadded a few other things. I added Juice from a lemon, tablespoon of lemonpepper and a Whole red pepper julienned. The peppers really took the citrus flavors. Oh and I didnt bread the breasts at all, just grilled them with garlic,lemmonpepper, and onion.

This was really good the pounded chicken was nice and moist and the sauce was tangy and creamy at the same time.  I used about half of the butter specified and found it be just right.

I followed the other reviewers comments and only added 2 tablespoons of butter. The result was the sauce was way too tangy. I then added honey as suggested by PIETRO but it wasn't quite the right flavour to go with lime. Perhaps some brown sugar and a splash of white rum would work?

I made this for hubby and I. I really pounded the chicken and let it rest after I put it in egg and then Italian Breadcrumbs. After taking the Chicken out of the pan, I added lots of Mushrooms and more oil. Then I added about three tablespoons of butter, some wine and then the lime juice with the chives and dill. The thing that made the recipe was adding the zest of one whole lime!!! I served it over Jasmine Rice. Definitely a keeper.

I gave a 4 star rating, but I wasn't wild about the sour (lime) sauce.  I did deglaze the pan with white wine and reduced that and the lime juice.  It was good, but a bit sour.  I may make this again because my husband really seemed to like it.  It did produce a very moist chicken breast.

My family loves this chicken. It's a weekly staple now since it's fairly quick & easy with tasty results. I don't always have fresh herbs on hand so I usually just used dried chives and sometimes dried tarragon. I think the butter is what makes it so tasty. Since it's hard to get my kids (teen and preteen) to eat much, I do the butter. Yes, I know I have a weird family since most teens eat anything

It was too hot to grill outside so I tried this recipe.  Served over brown rice.  Plenty of buttery sauce to spoon over the rice.  My husband, 8 yr. old & I loved it.  Different from any other chicken I've tried.  My husband doesn't like sweet sauces and really loved the lime in this.  Definitely a keeper at my house.

Would definitely make ths again but substitue half of the butter for chicken broth as some of the reviews suggest. Also, after draining the grease (there was hardly any) and adding the lime juice it evaporated almost immediately.  I ended up puttinglime juice in a new separate pan on low amd continued from there. The sauce - although very buttery - was delicious and tangy.

The chicken was delicious. I did take the advise of another reviewer and added 1/4 cup chicken broth, 3 tablespoons of butter, dill weed and 2 tablespoons of line juice. Brought it to a boil and let it cook down some.

This was delicious and easy. I don't usually like breaded chicken with lemon, so I was really making this for my husband, but I loved it as well. I sautéed the chicken in olive oil to cut down on fat. Served it with the "garlic quinoa" and "Mediterranean kale" from this website.

Positively sublime.  Followed modifications as suggested by mandalala 's review and everything came out perfectly, quickly and balanced. Served chicken and sauce over rice and even our picky three year old devoured her portion - and asked for more. Thank you for a great recipe!

I added chicken broth to the butter sauce some sliced and minced garlic, used fresh dill and thickened the butter lime dill sauce with a little flour and cream.  Came out killer.  Recommend using old biscuits for your breadcrumbs.

5 stars :) Replaced the breadcrumbs with crushed cornflakes and made it gluten free. I suggest juicing the limes first and pour in the juice, not squeezed directly into the pan. As another review said, that will make the juice evaporate. Any remaining sauce is delicious over broccoli. Enjoy!

Edit: This has become one of the family favorites, we've tried it a bunch of different ways. One of the best ways in my family's opinion is with crushed rice cereal for breading and replacing the chicken breasts with tenders

The base recipe for the chicken is wonderful, especially since you can add your own spice blend.  However, the lime sauce is WAY tart and too sour for the chicken it goes with.  I've made this twice, and both times we had to put the sauce on the side and use very sparingly.

This chicken was tasty and very filling (lots of butter!).  I did not have chives and used parsley in its place.  This did not have as strong a lime flavor as I thought it might, but it was still good.

I made this exactly to recipe and something about it made me want to take another bite in spite of the fact the lime I used must have been strong and it totally overpowered the sauce.  Next time I want to use maybe half a lime and some chicken broth as some of the other reviewers recommended.  It came together quickly. I sometimes like having a recipe I can throw together in 30 minutes.  Served with sweet potato fries and sweet baby peas.  It helped to balance out the strong flavor of the lime sauce and chicken.  Thanks SMLucy for submitting this recipe!

This is a GREAT summertime dish.  The combination of the thin breasts lightly breaded with the lime & butter sauce is da bomb.  I would never have thought to combine these two elements on my own, so I guess that's why I need to keep coming to this website for fresh ideas!  I did cut back on the butter, as others did; but other than that, this recipe stands up just fine.  I paired the chicken breasts with a cool cucumber salad, and *bam* major summertime dinner winner!

I served this to a friend and my 93 year old Mother. It was EXCELLENT! I didn't put too much sauce over each serving and served it with un-adorned new potatoes so it didn't taste too greasy to us. I used wheat free bread crumbs that I made so that I could eat it too. It was WONDERFUL.

Fantastic, juicy, crispy chicken! I will definitely make this again.  I adapted it a little bit though. I used unsalted saltines instead of breadcrumbs; I tend to do that with any breaded dish- baked or otherwise. 

I used chicken broth with a fraction of the butter and threw in some corn starch to thicken the sauce. I also added a tbspn of pickle juice.

Rating is based on what I made. Good recipe to make with ingredients on hand. I thought it could be crispier, but the family liked it. I dredged the chicken in soymilk instead of egg due to allergies and used Italian bread crumbs. I also followed other suggestions and used chicken broth instead of butter, so I had 1/2 c broth and 1/4 c lime juice, then added dried dill and dried chives and poured it all over the chicken.

I thought this recipe was a perfect spring time lift! I did use two limes instead of one and about half the butter. I like the extra lime "kick!" Will make this many times more!!!

This chicken was AMAZING!! I made this for my family of 5 and there was none left. Next time I will double the sauce; it's sooo good! I didn't have fresh chives on hand so I used minced garlic instead - turned out DELISH!! I followed the advice of some reviewers and replaced half the butter with chicken broth. This recipe is a keeper!!

We tried this last night. A Mid-Winter Zing for the tastebuds! We cut the butter way down and it still turned out to be a hit. This was an easy week-night meal that we'll definately make again.

Great dish. Used coconut oil instead of olive oil as well as cutting the quantity of butter and lime in half due to only making dinner for two rather than going all out with six servings. I liked the taste though the chicken could have been left on for longer. I filleted the chicken breast and still took a 7 minutes per side to get the chicken done on medium heat. Increasing the heat would only burn the outside breadcrumb mixture faster. Extra couple minutes seemed to do the job. Served this dish with green beans and a lime/cilantro brown rice recipe from here. Used half the lime on the chicken and the other half on the rice. The whole meal came out fantastic. 

Thanks for sharing the recipe. It is going in my box for future use.

This is DELICIOUS and so easy to make. i like to add a little Cayenne to the breading to give it a little kick. I'll be making this often to say the least. MUST TRY.

This is a great recipe that can easily be altered to suit any taste. I made the sauce using bottled lime juice to deglaze the pan and about 4 T margarine. I used 1/2 t dried chives. And followed the rest of the recipe. It was great, everyone loved it, we will have this again.

Huge hit at our house.  Made it twice last weekend to rave reviews both days. First time I followed the recipe but did cut down on the butter a little and added a tiny bit of half and half instead.  The second time I did salt the chicken a little before putting in the egg mixture.  Also added garlic to the olive oil to cook the chicken.  I increased the lime juice and cream because everyone wanted more sauce.  Both times I used green onions rather than chives.

OMG! This chicken is so good and tasty! So moist and juicy! I would probably next time add more lime juice and pulp.  Nice twist on plain chicken!

I made this at work yesterday, and shared it with some coworkers. I was asked for the recipe by 3 people and all 5 that I shared with loved it.  Its easy recipes like this, that they think I'm a master chef in my spare time.  Simple with a few ingredients makes for a good dish.

I made this tonight and it was fabulous!   I used garlic herb bread crumbs, and changed up the sauce a bit because I didn't have dill or chives on hand. I sauteed 3 cloves of garlic in olive oil with one table spoon "smart"  butter  and added basil  1 1/2 limes juiced and a tsp of honey. ( to cut the zing a bit)  Quick, easy and a big hit with my guys.

Very tasty recipie...I did not have chives so I used red onion instead.  I also cooked the chicken in coconut oil which gave it a nice tropical flavor.

My family was impressed! I am a huge fan of lime so this recipe was perfect for my taste! Only thing I changed was chives- I used green onion instead. Definitely adding this one to the monthly dinner menu!

Enjoyed this one!  The sauce was a tad bit too tangy for me but I put some tabasco sauce on later which really complimented the lime flavor!  Also next time I'll probably add more chives.

Did all of the above, but cooked it on the grill instead of broiling or pan frying. Everyone at our dinner loved it and asked for the recipe.

Such a simple recipe, and yet the result is anything but!  My entire family finished every last bite of this chicken and we were fighting over the last of the sauce.  Made sauce with 1/4 c. chicken broth and 4 Tbsp. butter.  Would definitely make again!!

We really enjoyed this dish, and will definitely make it again.  It has a great fresh taste.  I made it slightly differently because of what I had on hand.  I used Italian bread crumbs and freeze dried chives and dill.

I try so many recipes on the net that taste horrible.  This is the best chicken I have ever tasted.  I'm not even a huge chicken person but my husband is.  He doesn't like sauce but I made him try it.  We had ages 2, 12, 26 and us older and everyone loved it.  I doubled the sauce and used a lot more bread crumbs and oil.  You need to keep the bottom of the pan coated or they don't brown.  Awesome....thank you!!

I followed the recipe exactly and this was wonderful! I didnt worry about the butter because I only spooned it over the chicken so it didnt work out to that much butter per breast.  Try it, you will love it!

My husband and I both really liked this recipe, but it just had a little too much butter for us.  The lime added a great flavor though.  Next time, we'll take the advice of one of the other reviewers and substitute some chicken brother for half of the butter.

Easy to make, and very tasty.  I used whole wheat bread crumbs, and added a bit of honey to the sauce.  Overall great recipe.

Quick and tasty. Just used Italian style Panko crumbs without the chives and dill. Used 2 tablespoons of butter and 2 limes with some chicken stock and thickened with potato starch for the sauce. Is  a keeper.

I made this dish tonight and it was devoured... I read the reviews before making it and I only used about 2 1/2 tablespoons of butter and it came out perfect. It was quick and easy to make and everyone enjoyed it.

I planned to make this for my boyfriend as the first meal I cook for him. After reading the reviews I was a little weary, so I decided to make a little sample to try to see if I should tweak anything! I used to the Italian breadcrumbs and fried it, let it dry out both times. And then I made the Lime sauce like the recipe called for except adding a small amount of flour and also a small amount of chicken broth. Very impressed!! Cant wait to make it for him now! :)

This was very overpowering.  The way the chicken was cooked was awesome, but be careful of the heat level, it will start burning before the chicken is cooked all the way through.  I would do the chicken again, but substitute a honey dijon sauce instead.

this was amazing.. my fiance and i just got done with our plates and i had to pick up the laptop to write my review. i made a few changes though. i added some garlic powder and parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs for the breading. then i fried the breasts in oil for 5 mins on each side. then while i was making my sauce i used the juices from some hot salsa and about a tablespoon of the tomatoes and peppers in the salsa and some garlic powder. this chicken came out so juicy and was bursting with flavor. i wish i had my fiance's look on camera when he took that first initial bite. he was nodding in approval.. :-)

Chicken was greasy with the frying (to be expected).  I do believe that I should have cut down the butter for the sauce.  I tried to thicken up the sauce a little with cornstarch because it seemed so odd to me to pour melted butter on top of already greasy fried chicken and just have it soak in and make the breading mushy.  It had pretty good taste, I did like the combo of the dill and lime together. I'll probably repeat sometime down the line.

great idea but one thing. if anybody is having a problem with the grease fry it then bake it to get rid of the extra grease, and that help it obsorb more of the lime flavor.

My first review since this Jersey gal picked up and moved down to Kentucky to be with the love of my life! Yea! This was yum as is but I'll admit I kicked it up a bit by adding chopped garlic to the sauce. I took  "Likes2cook's" advice and stretched the sauce by adding in some chicken broth and thickened with corn starch. As far as the chicken is concerned, I had shredded cheese I wanted to use up so I incorporated that in with the bread crumbs. My chicken breasts were really large so after frying to a nice golden brown, I finished them off in the oven.  Rob and I both enjoyed this dish and I'll be making this one again in the near future. Thank you!

This is absolutely yummy, but I altered it a bit. I cut amount of butter in half, used 3 limes, and increased amount of sauce by using about a half cup chicken broth with cornstarch to thicken.  I also used panko crumbs to make it extra crispy.  My husband, who doesn't much like chicken and douses it with barbecue sauce no matter what sauce or seasoning I use, this time left the barbecue sauce in frig and scooped up as much lime sauce as he could and wanted even more.

Maybe I did something wrong, but the sauce was absolutely horrible. Even though I removed the pan from the heat for a few minutes, the lime juice pretty much evaporated right away, and once I put in the butter it turned a brown color from the pan drippings... which is good for a gravy, but not if you're making a citrus sauce. It also was unbelievably lime-y. Perhaps my lime had way too much juice in it.

Letting the chicken sit for 10 minutes before frying is an important step so that the coating really stays on the chicken.  Excellent flavor & amazingly tender!

Delicious! After I fried the chicken I put in two tbls of butter, a little chicken broth and the lime juice. Cooked for several minutes then poured over the chicken. Next time I may use another lime.

This was fantastic!  I was on the hunt for something different tonight and this certainly was.  LOVED the dill and lime flavors, my son had his girlfriend here for dinner and all 4 of us thought this was great.  I made roasted potatoes too which I drizzled some of the sauce over (on my plate) and I thought that was excellent too!  I stuck pretty much to the recipe except for using Italian panko bread crumbs, added a splash of lime to the egg and subbed in 1/2 cup of chicken broth for 1/2 of the butter.  Great new dish for us, thanks for sharing it!  Nice change.

Really good. Even my picky eaters will eat this if I leave off the lime sauce at the end.  The rest of us LOVE the lime sauce.  I do use about double the lime juice that the recipe calls for.  We like it a little more limey.  Thanks for the recipe.

This chicken turned out great!  My kids ate the chicken with ketchup like chicken nuggets and I layed a handful of mixed greens and spinich on top of my chicken and used the the lime sauce as a dressing on top of the greens and chicken.  Very yummy!  Too bad my husband missed this dinner...will make again!

This is the #1 requested recipe in my house.  My family asks for it every week and have begun to call it "that heavenly lime chicken".  Honestly, we all love butter and have not found it to be overwhelming.  Sometimes I add the juice of one extra lime just to make more sauce.  The chicken is so tender and the sauce has a perfect flavor.  We have served it many times to dinner guests and it has always got rave reviews. For those watching their weight, serve the sauce on the side and dip the chicken to control how much butter you consume.  We just love this recipe!!!!

Something very like this recipe is a favorite of ours.  However, I learned from following this recipe that drying chicken after dipping in egg and crumbs, adds to crunchiness.  I used panko instead of bread or cracker crumbs.  And, because I didn't have a lime, substituted lemon.  Next time I'll try orange.  Should work just fine.

I wasn't very impressed with this, in fact I was rather disappointed. I think it's a good start to do some tweaking. I didn't think it had enough lime flavor & with the amount of butter in it, it wasn't really a sauce in my opinion. It was just lime hinted butter. I will definitely try again, but with some changes.

I love the lime sauce in this dish - i followed other suggestions and just used chicken tenderloins instead of pounding the breast, and used Italian bread crumbs. Also substituted 2 green onion stalks for the chives. I had the same issue of the lime juice almost evaporating immediately, so I added chicken broth until it cooled down a bit, then the lime juice (substituted most of the butter with just broth.) I made this with a mushroom risotto. Thanks!

Very, very nice for our family, and not too time-consuming. I didn't feel like pounding the chicken, so I just popped it into the oven at 400F for about 20 min. after the saute.

I pounded the breasts, but did not coat them in the crumb mixture.  Sauteed them until brown and then removed them from the pan.  I deglazed the pan with the lime juice and a little white wine.  Added sage, (it was what I had on hand) and then gently stirred in the butter.  Delicious and easy!

Great flavor! I always marinate my chicken with a marinade of some sort to match the recipe first. This one use a garlic and herb by Lawerys. With that you don't need the egg batter for the bread crumbs.

This was awesome! The only thing I changed was rather than bread crumbs, I used italian panko crumbs and flour to help it stick.  Also, I baked it in the oven then broiled for a couple of minutes to make them a little crispier.  Soooo good!!  The lime sauce is awesome, I added a little extra lime juice.

I doubled the sauce and also put it on bow-tie pasta and it was great!  I too substituted chicken broth for half the butter, and it was perfect.

I used the bagged breaded chicken so I didn't have any scraping.  Instead, I used 2 T butter and a scoop of flour in a saucepan followed by 1 cup chicken broth and 1 cup milk (the lime and dill followed).  I then threw in a handful of shredded cheddar cheese so it made it a creamy and cheesy lime sauce.  It was good!  Next day cold leftovers were wonderful, too!!

Keeping the oil hot will prevent it from soaking up the oil - using a cast iron pan is the best to maintain the heat needed.  The breading fell off mine; but it tasted good.

The flavors of this recipe were okay, but nothing special. The sauce was too thin and the flavors were flat, and it was impossible to get the chicken breasts to 1/4 inch thin, so by the time I had cooked them until they were done the breading had burned. The chicken was also underseasoned, probably because I used panko. Bottom line, I probably won't make this again.

Too much dill. I would recommend splitting the breast. Mine were too thick to fry in the pan, and the breading got a little black. Pretty good chicken, though

Delicious and simple!  The sauce is VERY tangy, but the butter gives it a rich flavor that complements the chicken well. It literally took me 30 minutes to make!!

This was so flavorful, and so good, I can't wait to make it again. What I did diffe rant though, was...I am not to big on thebread crumb coating, so I crushed saltine crackers instead, mixed in about 1 Tbsp flour, and 1 Tbsp Potato flakes, through some salt and pepper in, and after dipping chicken in the eggs, I coated it with the cracker mix, and did everything else the exact same. This is one fantabulous recipe!!! Oh, I almost forgot, the limes I had weren't very "juicy" so I used store bought lime juice, and I used about 1/2 cup of it for double the recipe

this recipe was quick and easy to prepare and the lime gives it a great flavor.  i did not have the problem that others did with the sauce being too buttery.  the only reason i don't cook this more often is because we try not to eat fried foods too often.

I had high hopes for this recipe.  It sounds great but then I realized how fat the "sauce" is.  And I wouldn't call six table spoons of butter "sauce".  I won't be making this one again.

Quick & easy.  I added black pepper to the bread crumbs & omitted the chives as I didn't have any on hand.  Also had no limes, so used jarred lime juice.  I think it still turned out good.  The only downfall was that the chicken breasts didn't cook as fast as the recipe called for.  Had to stick them in the oven to finish cooking.

Supper good.  Made it for my family a few nights ago and it was a hit.  I did use Pepperidge Farms seasoned bread crumbs and even added a little extra seasoning.  The sauce it awesome.  It's very tasty and very easy.  Great one to add to your recipe box!

Not bad, quick & easy. Bake the chicken (@ 400 for ~20 minutes) and substitute 1/3 of the butter with milk to make the dish less greasy. The milk makes the sauce thinner but the taste is the same and it lightens the sauce up.

Very tasty! Next time will cut back on the butter, though. Thanks for a keeper, Suzan!

I was a little put off by how buttery the sauce was...I was hoping that it would be more creamy.  Otherwise, the flavor really was great and the lime was a nice touch without overpowering the dish.  My kids actually ate their chicken first (and they always tell me how much they hate chicken) telling me that it was the best chicken they've ever eaten...hubby had 2 pieces of chicken, he never does that...this is a winner!

It was tasty, and we liked the lime flavor, however the butter made what should have been a light tasting dish rather heavy.  I wonder if whisking chicken stock with a tablespoon of butter, a hint of lime and capers would change my overall biew of this dish?  As it is, it's just okay.

This recipe was very easy and absolutely delicious. I did add some lemon juice to the lime juice as I didn't have enough lime juice. I also added garlic powder and pepper to the bread crumbs as suggested by another member. YUMMMM

Thanks for the recipe - I made it with a little twist.  Cut into strips, coated chicken with egg whites and corn flakes crumbs.  Baked at 450 for 20- 25 minutes. I Made the sauce with chicken stock, butter and lime juice with the fresh chives and dill.

The sauce was great, but  the chicken should be seasoned well before coating.  I am a fan of panko bread crumbs. It made the chicken quite crispy; however, you have to coat very well.

I make this recipe and everyone loved it.  I included the juice from 2 limes instead of one and bought Purdue thinly sliced chicken breasts to avoid the pounding step.  I also had extra lime available to squeeze on as desired.  Delicious!

First off, I’ve never made a recipe from this site that matched the prep and prepare times listed. Unless you have a sous chef, I don’t see how you could make this recipe in the time listed.  You have to wash your fresh herbs, let them dry, chop them, wash your lime, juice it, prepare your flour, yaddah-yaddah-yaddah, And before you know it an hour of prep time has gone by not 15 minutes as listed. That being said you need to allow yourself at least two Hours to prepare this dish. I prepared it using 2 tablespoons of butter a 1/3 cup of low-sodium chicken broth, fresh dill weed, and fresh chives and it was delicious.  I also used chicken thighs instead of chicken breast as I have found they are so much more tender and flavorful than chicken breasts.  That being said, the whole meal was absolutely delicious served over jasmine rice with veggies and fresh fruit. It will definitely be a staple for us and a winner.

I made this and tried to follow the recipe. I did use Panko bread crumbs be cause that is what I had. Loved the crunch! I had the skillet too hot when I added the lime juice so I will remember that next time and I would like to try cutting the butter with broth when I make it again, but I definitely recommend this recipe! It is so quick to prepare and the lime highly complements the chicken. Thanks for a great recipe!!

Really good with a couple of tweaks. Too much butter in the sauce.  Will only use 1 T next time and the rest chicken broth .  Made it with crushed Hi t of Lime tortilla chips and doubled the lime juice in the sause.  Put a couple of lime wedges on each plare to squeeze over chicken before weating.  Did I say I like lime in anything?  I even buy the lime beer salt to flavor things..

Excellent!  I used both chicken breasts and thighs.  Hubby is a breast man and I prefer dark meat.  I might have had more chicken than the recipe called for as I needed to double both the egg and bread crumbs.  I used gluten free Panko and it was a winner winner chicken dinner at our house.

This was a good place to start, but after reading several reviews, I made some revisions when making this dish. I mixed salt and pepper in some flour and coated my chicken prior to cooking them in the oil. Then I deglazed my pan. I used 3 tbs butter, 3/4 cup low sodium chicken broth, pepper, zest and juice of two (very small) limes, and the herbs to make the pan sauce then thickened it with a cornstarch slurry. I then served the sauce over the chicken and fettuccine noodles. I could have used more lime flavor, but my husband liked it as it was.

This has become a favorite for me to make for my wife and myself. I use a mix of orange juice and lime juice, so this is citrus chicken. I don't do much reduction, as we use the sauce for both the chicken and rice. I don't bother with dill or parsley.

I loved this meal.  Didn't change a thing until I ate the leftovers. when, just for fun, I stirred a dollop of sour cream into the lime sauce.  Still super yummy.  Served with Jasmine rice.

I made this for dinner tonight using Trader Joe's chicken tenders that I pounded down.  Following the recipe pretty much as written (all the ingredients but without measuring), the taste was really wonderful.  We have some leftovers, so tomorrow I'll add some lime cilantro rice to extend it.  Thanks for a lovely dinner!

The end product was juicy , tangy and delicious!  The only change I made was that I realized I may not have tenderized the chicken breasts enough so maybe they were still too thick and didn't get done enough in the skillet.  I didn't want to burn them soI transferred them to a baking dish and baked for 25 minutes at 350 degrees, then poured the lime butter over them once they came out of the oven, and the result was great!

Made a low-carb version of this, substituting almond flour/meal for breadcrumbs (and added Tajin con LImon seasoning to bread crumbs).  It was very good.and hubby had no clue it wasn't regular bread crumbs.  Did reduce butter to 3tbs and replaced with chicken stock as others suggested.

This was amazing!! My ENTIRE family loved it and found the citrus flavor refreshing! I did use two fresh limes and when I make it again I plan to pan cook until brown and then transfer to oven for an additional 10 minutes of bake time.  I will be making this regularly for sure!!

I was really excited about this, and like others, and every other recipe in my life, had to make a few changes.  I cut the breasts into strips and roasted them with a little oil, salt and pepper at about 400 for about 20 minutes.  Just before they were done, I melted about 3 tbs. of butter, added the dill and the juice of a lime.  Some have said there was very little lime flavor, but ours was very pronounced, almost too much so.  I tested it, then tossed in about 1/4 cup of cream to tone it down.  It was really great on the chicken, but I poured the sauce on baked potatoes and it didn't improve them.  Next time, and there will be a next time, I will use a smaller lime or only half.

Chicken was good!  Sauce wasn't really for me; next time I'll just top the chicken with freshly squeezed lime instead.  I made it with a rice and basil mixture and chopped asparagus

This chicken dish is awesome!  I prepared it as the recipe indicated except I didn't have any fresh chives, so I just chopped some of the green stem part of green onions as a substitute, and it worked great.  I also had really large, thick chicken breasts, so I sliced them horizontally in half and then pounded them to flatten and tenderize.  I found I needed to add more olive oil as I fried, but the chicken wasn't greasy at all.  It was moist and tender.  The whole family loved it!  I will definitely make it again.  Very quick and easy for a busy week night meal.

I loved this, my mother-in-law loved it, and my wife loved it!  The changes I made were few, I added an extra juice of a half of lime and to the sauce I added Prosecco wine to stretch the sauce a bit.  I was a wonderful use of dill and chives, just great. Thank You

It's delicious. I love the sauce, but instead of chives I put garlic because I couldn't find chives anywhere. So I decided to put some minced garlic and it gave the sauce nice flavour.

I thought it was an excellent  base recipe. I used chicken tenderloins instead of chicken breast . I used about 1/2 the butter though. I added a 1/2 cup of chicken broth in place of the rest of the butter.  I also seasoned the chicken with some lawrys seasoning salt, garlic powder, onion powder & black pepper.  I didn't scrape the pan either, as the breading & crumbs made the gravy better.  I put tHe chicken back in the gravy & let it simmer another 10 minutes or so. It was very tender & everyone in the house loved it! It will be in the rotation!

I couldn't help but take a picture of this and add it to the others. I added more lime (because I love it) and totally used this amount of butter. It's not like we eat this richly every day, and even though using chicken broth is also a great idea, I'm a fan of Julia Child's quote "With enough butter, anything is good." This was a treat!
Thank you, SMLUCY (or rather SMLFISH) :)

tried this tonight and I loved it.  My husband likes fish and I do not, so I used this recipe and cooked both the chicken breast and a cod fish filet.  The only thing I did different for the fish was that I did not coat it in egg, just put a tiny bit of olive oil so the bread crumbs would stick.  Also, I didn't pound the chicken, just cooked it a bit longer.  Absolutely delicious.  We will be making this often.

One of my favorite meals. To make it a bit more healthy, I usually use 3 tbsp. of chicken broth and 3 tbsp. of Brummel & Brown (butter substitute) instead of 6 tbsp. of butter. And I bake the chicken instead of frying it. As long as you don't overcook it, it still comes out juicy and delicious!

Was very good to us.  The lime flavor was refreshing however the sauce was just a bit much on the greasy side. Next time might use less butter and add chicken broth. Served mine with penne noodles.

This is similar to an old recipe I use but I bake the chicken breast first with no breading. Melt butter in a skillet, and add
2 tbsp. Lime juice, 2 tsp. Fresh dill, fresh minced chives, and simmer the sauce on very low heat until chicken is done. Place chicken in skillet and coat with sauce. I add a LOT more chives because I like them and it does not affect the taste of the sauce. I think it tastes better without the breading and it is much healthier without sacrificing taste.

This was delicious! I agree to cut down the butter by about 2 T, and add at least twice the lime juice called for. I'm a southern girl and I love butter but, it's too buttery and not limey enough for my families taste.

this has become a regular in our house with a few variations. I'm able to buy the chicken breasts at my local grocery already sliced thin so--big time savings there. also I substituted equal parts brown rice flour and almond flour for the bread crumbs...sautes up nice and crispy--kind of a cornmeal consistency, and gluten-free. I cut the butter back to about half to enhance the lime flavor and leave out the dill--serve it on the side in a bowl as I have a picky teen. Very tasty and pretty quick for a weeknight dinner.

I thought this was delicious! I took the advice of other reviewers (that's why I LOVE Allrecipes!) and cut the butter in half, and added a little honey. Others mentioned the lime juice evaporating - I opted to melt the butter in the pan first, then add the juice and spices. Loved it!

The good news is..... the butter and lime made this chicken MOIST, even when you reheat it in the microwave as a leftover.  On the other hand, I agree with another reviewer that less butter could be used.

The bad news is..... I didn't like it that well.  But, I didn't have chives, I made it without chives.  Perhaps the chives is an important ingredient.  

I cooked it on 200 in an electric skillet.  Like another reviewer stated, there was no grease left to get rid of.  But, keeping the heat low helped keep the lime juice from evaporating.

Definitely adding this to the recipe book. Quick & easy for a weeknight dinner. To make myself feel less guilty about the delicious lime-butter sauce, I made a side of roasted veggies only. No additional carbs or fats needed for this meal.

Needed something new to try with chicken breasts. This was great, although I did amend it based on the herbs I had on hand and less butter (thanks to past reviews). My finicky kids loved it. I was shocked how tender the kitchen was and how much the pounding helped. Will make again, perhaps with chives and dill the next time. Loved the lime.

This recipe is great for once in awhile. If you are worried about the butter, try splurging on some organic grass-fed butter. It has more vitamins and it has the unsaturateded fats we are all looking for. No bread crumbs, just salt and pepper and a little garlic.

I make this often, my family loves it. I do it a bit differently. I salt and pepper the chicken breast after flattening and skip the bread crumbs. I use a non stick pan and a few drops of olive oil. I use half the butter and two limes, and two chopped green onions and dill.

It was tasty, but not a lot of lime flavor and I used 2 limes. I skipped the "dry on a rack" step. I don't think it's necessary at all and it saved time.

I love easy recipes! Added chicken broth in order to reduce butter and have enough gravy to put over Quinoa which is healthy but needs more flavor... Didn't have chives so i subbed fresh garlic.

YUM!!! This dish is unbelievable! I made it for the first time last week and have made it three times since then. Whole family loved it - even my kids ( 7 and 9). This will be going in my weekly rotation!

Made this tonight for dinner. Husband and I liked it a lot. I did not use all of the butter- only 2 Tablespoons and put in 3/4 cup chicken broth in the sauce. I used fresh herbs. Will be making this again soon.

Awesome flavor.  Per other reviews, I deglazed the pan with 1/3 cup of chicken broth, mixed with the lime juice, reduced by half, then swirled in 2 tablespoons of butter.  I forgot to add the chives and dill weed, so simply springled them over the chicken after drizzling with the sauce.

This was a tasty breaded chicken recipe.  I guess I didn't pound the breasts flat enough, because I ended up sticking the browned chicken into the oven for 15-20 minutes until it finished cooking through. Not a big deal.  While the dish was good, I am not sure that I'd make it again; the sauce was not "wow" to me.

LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!
Very light tasting.  Juicy & flavorful!
I did reduce the amount of butter & adapted as some of the reviewers stated (with a little honey).  Each time I made this recipe (twice so far), it was a success and empty plates!  Will definitely make again!

I followed several viewers advice and used one half chicken broth instead of all of the butter. I also used panko instead of bread crumbs. It was really good, BUT it needs "something". My boys doused it in cholula sauce and they thought it was fabulous. Next time I'll try adding the cholula to the egg wash, just for a little kick. I served it with jasmine rice and next time will make more lime sauce for the rice as well.

Very good recipe, however I think the best measurement for the lime is going to depend on the person.  My wife and I had this and it was delicious.  There was just a tad too much lime for her, while perfect for me.  Overall great dinner, I will make it again.

Loved this recipe, so simple, yet I would never have thought to put lime and butter together with lightly breaded chicken.  The only changes I made were I reduced the amount of butter and replaced with some chicken broth, and used some cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  Oh, and no chives because I didn't have any.  Fantastic!  Even my husband liked it!

The chicken looked great. The sauce was good, but not great, but I didn't include the dill as I am not a fan. And, I used green onion instead of chives. So, maybe it was my own fault. I'll make the chicken like this again though...and maybe change up the sauce.

I had to make due with a couple substitutes, but it turned out fantastic!  I didn't have any dill on hand, so I added maybe a teaspoon (probably a little less) of mustard (the condiment version).  I served with brown rice, and added garam masala powder, chives, mustard, and lemon juice to the rice for flavor.  And sauvignon blanc?  Please!  I drank orange juice.  Complemented the meal just fine!

Very easy and quite delicious.  The chicken turned out very tender.  I substituted chicken broth (1/2 C) for half of the butter, as suggested. I also used panko bread crumbs (what I had).  Would make again, but next time I might double the sauce

This was much easier to make than I expected...although I forgot to pound the chicken first. I just cut it up in smaller pieces to get it to cook all the way through. I would maybe add another lime in the future since I really like the flavoring it gives the chicken. But overall, it turned out delicious and crispy on the outside.

This was amazing! I fed this to my exceptionally picky child, who won't eat meat, and she at all of it! I think I would double the lime next time as the butter kind of overwhelmed the flavor, but other than that, excellent!!

Just made it tonight. This is actually only chicken cutlet with a lime sauce. I followed what the original author recommended about 3/4 of the sauce being chicken broth and the 1/4 butter. I also added grated parmesan cheese and paprika to the bread crumbs. No chives because I didn't have any. It was ok, not spectacular.

Love it! Kind of like a lime chicken piccata. I took out the chicken, made the butter/lime sauce & then just put it back in the pan & coated both sides. Served with a packaged rice mix. Will totally make this again!

Excellent!  The chicken was tender and moist.  The sauce is tangy and really delicious. I used 1/2 the butter than was called for and used a spray on the pan so that it wouldn't stick.  That cut the calories quite a bit. I highly recommend this recipe

This was a very good recipe! I did however take the advise of other reviewers and added 1 c of broth and used 3tbs of butter instead of the recommended 6 tbs. I also added a bit of cornstarch/water to the sauce right before serving to make the sauce a bit thicker. This is a definite keeper!

I made this for my family last night, and it was a HUGE success! My husband isn't a big fan of chicken, but he loved this recipe. Being weight/calorie-conscious, I only used half of the butter and substituted in low-fat, low-sodium chicken stock and a dash of white wine. I also used seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain. I'll definitely be making this again.

I made this last night and loved it, but I made it a little differently.  Instead of using the ingredients to make a sauce to go on top, I mixed the egg, olive oil, 3 tbsp butter, 3 tbsp chicken broth, chives, 1/2 tsp ginger (as recommended below), and fresh juice from two limes to make a marinade.  I cut the breasts in half and pounded them down to make cutlets, then marinated them for an hour before breading them and cooking them in the skillet.  I also mixed in a little salt (made them really flavorful!) and flour with the bread crumbs -- they turned out fantastically!

Delicious!  Chicken was nice and crispy!  The sauce was light and flavorful!  I didn't have any dill so I used a little bit of ginger and it was great!

This was surprisingly outstanding. I used margarine as I don't like the buttery taste with chicken and cut the amount in half. Chicken was moist and extremely tasty. I also used garlic bread crumbs. Five stars for sure!

I love this recipe. Mostly because my chicken came out perfect! She/He asked that I let the chicken dry for a bit after breading it and it made a huge difference. I will remember that from now on. I cut the mount of butter in half and subtistuted it with a little bit of chicken stock. I also used cilantro instead of dill just because I made the "Tropical Sweet Potato Fries" as a side and that has Lime and Cilantro in it. I am sure the Dill is great with it as well.

The dill in butter was very off tasting. We also had a few issues where more oil had to be added to the pan to cook the chicken. Also the butter sauce overall did not add enough to the chicken and it still felt like something was missing.

A yummy recipe! I used 5 TB of butter instead of 6 and cooked the chicken breasts individually, added more oil each time for that really golden look. Thanks for the recipe!

left out the dill weed, i hate the stuff. Hubby said "it tastes like cracker barrel catfish" and gives it 3.75 stars. 7yr old son said "it's a little bitter at first, then it tastes like stale gum", and gave it 4.5 stars. Mom (I) said, "well, it was easy to cook, and it had a nice little zest to it" and gives it 4 starts...but will likely not make it again. I took the advice of others, and halved the butter and threw a healthy swig of white wine in it's place. I also threw a little flour in to thicken the sauce a little.

Homemade breadcrumbs: cut 1/2  loaf of french bread into 1 inch cubes, toast in oven under the broiler for a few minutes, then food process them until fine.  I also followed the suggestion of reducing the amount of butter in the sauce and adding chicken stock which still left the sauce buttery and delicious but not too greasy.  This is definetly a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

Made this the other night and it turned out great! I added some Garlic Powder and Salt while prepping the chicken just to add a little taste to it. I used 2 limes instead of one and took out the dill. It still turned out good. My boyfriend loved it so much he ate all of it. Will definitely make this again.

Very nice!  I'm a single person and eat very tiny portions, so I used only one large breast cut into four pieces and pounded out to even thicknesses.  I kinda followed the sauce part for 2 servings (2 Tblsp butter)and juice of a whole very small lime.  It was all very, very good.  Served with peas drizzled with a touch of the sauce.  Will use the chicken for a salad in tomorrow's lunch.  I loved the lime butter, but will probably discard the leftovers due to calories.  Oh, and I didn't have dill, but had some fresh marjoram and it was very good.  Will make again!!

This chicken was a huge hit.  Since we try to watch cholesterol, I only used olive oil and no butter.  I also used boneless, skinless thighs since I had them on hand.  I browned them in a skillet, then put them in the oven for about 15 minutes.  We'll be having this chicken again!

This recipe is great. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it was a little to dilly for our tastes (3 out of 4 family members). It so easy to make and looks great on your plate. Oh I also didn't use quite as much butter.

This is not a dish for anyone eating healthy, but it is more than worth the extra calories. Me and my boyfriend made this for dinner tonight, and it was fantastic. It was so easy to make, and we had almost all of the ingredients already.   The only things we really changed were that we added crushed red pepper to the breadcrumbs and we didn't use the dill in the sauce. We served it with rice and corn. And when we cut the corn off of the cob, we used some of the extra butter sauce on it and it was great.   We will definitely be making this recipe again. I'm even going to tell my mom about it.

I made this recipe just as written except I didn't have any dry bread crumbs so I pulverized some club crackers and used those instead. This recipe was fantastic and easy to make. My wife loves me trying out the recipes I find here on her. Thanks for the recipe I will make this one again.

Thanks for the great recipe and accurate instructions.  I used fresh chives and fresh dill; it was wonderful.  I used 4 T. butter instead of 6 T. for the 4 chicken breasts and it made enough sauce.  I am not an expert cook but this recipe made me look skilled.  My boyfriend said he felt like he was eating at a four star restaurant!  Am definitely going to make this again.

I think my lime was too big---this was VERY TART.  But, since I'd cut the butter down and added some chicken stock, I just added a bit more of both of them.  I also double dipped the chicken in the eggs and breadcrumbs so it was nice and crispy.  Will definately make again, but with a smaller lime.

I've made this at least three times now and it's so delicious!  My family loves it.  I haven't tried it using chicken broth and half the butter amount.  I will definitely do that next time, even though the butter makes it so flavorful!

Excellent recipe.  I solved to too much butter problem by simply by adding no butter at all, and using the olive oil from the frying of the chicken.  Since the chicken was skinless, there was no chicken fat.

I made this tonight looking for something different to do with chicken breasts and this recipe hit the spot! The only thing I did different was I didn't pound the chicken(they were small breasts) and I added garlic salt to the breadcrumbs. I used lemon juice instead (our lemon tree has about 100 ripe lemons on it right now) and I omitted the dill and chives. After browning the chicken, some pieces still weren't done, so I boiled the lemon juice and added the butter and put the chicken breasts back into the pan, covered and simmered for 10 minutes. They came out soooo juicy and tender with a subtle lemony taste. Family really liked it,very good recipe, thanks!

SOOOOO tender. I added some of the lime juice to the egg mixture so it could get some more lime flavor. Delicious. I served it with edamame and yams.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I might would change up the lime sauce just a tad but overall it was delicious.  My chicken breasts must have been huge because once they were pounded, they were the size a dinner plate!  I cut them in half and doubled the recipe.

This is a wonderful recipe and definitely a hit with my husband. I saw someone said that they're greasy, but mine really don't turn out that way. I fry them in very little olive oil in a non-stick skillet and remove all the oil from the pan before putting in the butter. I also squeeze two good sized limes and put less butter than the recipe calls for which makes it a bit tangier and less fatty. I'm also pregnant and can't tolerate dill at the moment, so I use chives and cilantro instead. EXCELLENT. I'm sure it's great with dill too, but not for preggo lady. :-)  Happy eating!

I loved this recipe! The only thing different I did was season the chicken with salt and pepper before coating it in the bed crumbs. Super easy, tasty, and a good way to work out the days frustrations by being able to hit something with a mallet!!!!

Not your regular chicken!  Tasty and different.  I made the recipe healthier by using only 1 Tbsp butter, 1 Tbsp light butter spread and 1/2 cup chicken broth.  I also used fresh dill/chives.  Wonderful!

Sometimes chicken breast recipes can be very dry.  This was an absolutely wonderful exception.  I did add chicken broth so that there was adequate sauce.  I have a similar lemon chicken recipe that calls for chopped sweet onions.  I believe I'll try adding the onions next time.  Thanks for this delightful recipe.

I made this last night and it was so good! My family loved it, even the kids. I gave it 4 stars because I made a lot of changes to fit my taste. I took other peoples advice and used 1/2 the butter and added some chicken broth to the sauce. I also thickened it up with a little corn starch and water and used green onions because I had some and didn't have chives. I seasoned the chicken breasts with some garlic salt and pepper before breading and also seasoned the bread crumbs with a little salt and pepper. I thought they would be too bland without some seasoning. Overall, a good recipe, you just need to tweak it a little to suit your taste. My husband loved it and I will definitely make it again.

This was one of the best receipes ever - I could hardly stop eating it. Used only 3 tbls of butter and it was delicious.  I will double the sauce receipe next time - not enough sauce for 4 breasts.  I will make this at least once a month.  Thanks for the receipe!

The chicken turned out great, very moist. The only thing I would suggest is for someone to give measurements for the lime since many limes vary in size. And many use the package lime juice. Not complaining just a suggestion. I used about 4-5 squirts but not sure if I used to much or to little I also added the chicken with white rice and soy sauce. I will make again. Thank you.

very good! used italian bread crumbs because that's what i had on hand. my youngest daughter (also the pickest) liked the chicken without adding the lime sauce. everyone else loved the sauce. the sauce didn't have too much of a lime flavor, but that may have been my fault. i used lime juice instead of squeezing a lime and just may not have used enough juice. will definately make again! the only thing i will change is to use a little more lime juice.

I am sorry to say that I expected more with this dish. The flavors didn't seem to blend to well and it came out kind of bland. I don't think that I would make it again. Sorry.

Taste was really good.  I had to add more lime at the end as the lime flavor seemed to disappear the longer it was heated.  If you are watching your cholesterol, forget this recipe.  I don't understand the part where you drain the grease from the pan just to add more in the form of butter.  You are actually pouring melted butter over your chicken, and this is called a sauce?

A fast recipe to prepare - I liked it alot, my husband thought it was too lime tasting (hense the 4 stars; our average). I used panko crumbs, and found letting the chicken sit for the ten minutes after the crumb mixture was put on worked well. I used canola oil - allows for higher heating before smoking, so easier to prevent burning. I used 1 1/2 tsp of fresh dill. I will try again - reducing the lime slightly to keep harmony :-).

Loved this dish.  The tangy lime sauce really went well with the fried chicken.  I didn't have chives, so I used the light green part of some scallions, sliced very thin.  I think this would be an EXCELLENT sauce for fried fish as well, and plan to use it for that.

Absolutely amazing! The Lime sauce really did it for me, it was delicious! And, like other reviewers, I only used about 3 Tbsp. of butter. It turned out awesome. I was cooking for three men that night and they all loved it too. This is definitely one of my new favorites!!

Way toooo much butter. The lime with the chicken is good starter, but other than that it lacks a great deal of flavor.
Sorry, but thanks for sharing.

This isn't a review so much as a question.  Am I supposed to drain the oil from the pan and put lime juice in that pan or am I supposed to drain the oil into a smaller saucepan and make the sauce in that smaller pan?

excellent! Super easy and fast.  I used one less T butter than what was called for and I forgot to pound the chicken breast first so I needed to cook a bit longer.  It was still delicious and I think I'll double the recipe next time.

I made for 8. I feed three growing boys plus a husband. It was very lime-y, almost to much. I will use half lime half chicken broth in future.

This was so great!  While I was cooking it I thought it might have been a poor choice, but my husband (and I) loved it!  I ended up using the lime juice in a container vs the fresh - just because limes here have gotten so expensive!!  It still turned out really well -- I served it with rice and steamed brussel sprouts : >  Yumm.

Very good dish. I wish the sauce was a little more creamy though. (I dont know how to do this needing help) I served it on a bed of fresh squash and zuchini cooked with butter, salt, and pepper. Made for an amazing meal. Very summery.

This recipe was great - I wasn't able to tenderize my breast to a 1/4 inch and I think I might use boneless, skinless thighs in the future instead, but the sauce was really tasty and satisfied my desire for something different.  I do plan to use this recipe again.

I'm going to give this a 5 star because I absolutley adored this dish. My boyrfiend said it was really good but I could tell it wasn't out of this world for him, but who cares about that it was awesome! I wish I would have made more because I made this with chicken tenders and two per person wasn't enough. I didn't use the egg just rolled the wet chicken in bread crumbs. I thought I would need more sauce so I doubled the lime juice, it was really lime-y! A little bit goes a long way, didnt need that much sauce. I didn't have chives, used green onion. Great recipe! Try this one!

We really enjoyed this.  I added fresh garlic while frying the chicken, and I used Italian bread crumbs instead of plain.  I also added more dill and chive than called for. Very different flavor for a nice change.

This recipe is good but I gave it 3 stars because I think it could be a lot better. Next time I will play around with adding a little sugar to the sauce to cut the tart flavor. Also try adding some chicken broth to cut down on the butter. I would also add some type of pepper (i.e. jalapeño) for a little kick. I have also thought of adding some cream cheese or sour cream to the sauce to make it creamy....(might be good)

This time I did add minced garlic to the oil before cooking chicken, and added bacon bits to the sauce. I think this would also be great served with garlic mashed potatoes.

Recipe as is….okay but definitely as potential.

We love this!!  I have made this several times already and it never fails to impress.  I also squeeze more lime juice into the butter at the end.  Make this...you won't be disappointed!

Quik and easy with delicious results!!!!!  We found that sugar snap pea pods go excellent as a side dish.  The lime butter sauce tastes great on them as well.

Wow, this was good!  I didn't have any chives and I only used half the amount of butter it called for.  Great flavor!

MMMMMMMMMM - is all I kept hearing from the table as my eight year old devoured this!  His was gone before I even sat down!  I was surprised with only using one lime - but it was perfect.  Instead of chives, I used some green onions sliced thin.  This will definately be put into our meal rotation.  Thanks!!

This was pretty good - the husband liked it, so that's a good sign :)  The little zest from the lime juice was much appreciated.

I really liked this a lot.  My husband made it and he used flour on the chicken first to help keep the breading on and then finished it off in the oven.

This recipe was tasty.  It was a bit tangy, but the combination of flavors was nice.

I thought the flavor of the chicken was excellent. I did have to microwave the chicken for 3 minutes because I had thicker breasts of chicken, but they were still delicious.

This is a great go to dish any day of the week.  Next time I think I'll try pounding the chicken and balance the citrus with something sweet.
