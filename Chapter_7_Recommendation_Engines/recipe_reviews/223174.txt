I made this a while ago and it was very good, I thought it would be too sweet but, it came out to be the perfect balance of sweet and spicy. I used some of the garlic chile paste that I had leftover. Served with the white mexican rice recipe from gema, on this site.  Thanks for sharing Ken!

This was excellent. It's spicy but not too spicy. I didn't have ancho chile, so used NM chile powder. I had whole chicken breasts, and after marinating in the rub for an hour, I wrapped them in aluminum foil and let them cook on the grill for about 30 minutes on low. Took them out of the foil and basted with the glaze. I didn't have mango puree, so I used orange-mango juice along with a wee bit of fresh mango. This is a keeper!

This recipe is fantastic!!!  But no need for another pan to clean, and flavor to go to waste...I grilled it the entire time of cook over charcoal.  I wouldn't recommend gas as the direct flame could make the chili powder/rub burn potentially.  Put on the glaze at the very end, then add more once off the grill.  Delicious!!

Very, very good.  Finished this off by bringing the marinade to a boil and thickening with a corn starch slurry to make a sauce to serve with.

I made this with bone-in breasts. Spicy, but good. I couldn't grill, so we cooked it in the oven the whole time, adding the glaze toward the end. Grilling would have been better, but it was still good.
