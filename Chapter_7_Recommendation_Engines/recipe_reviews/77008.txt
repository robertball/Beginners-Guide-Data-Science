This pork roast is absolutely awesome!  Here's what I did a bit differently:  we were serving 6 guests so cut the whole pork roast in half but used the full recipe for the stuffing.  Timing was perfect but did take out of the oven  at 150 as I figured it would still cook.    Moist, tender and perfect.  The Port Wine gravy was delicious.  Served with pureee of Sweet potatoes and roasted onions with balsamic vinegar and it was a wonderful accompaniment.  Be sure the meat therm. is placed into the pork and NOT the dressing.  Although the recipe said to baste with the pan dripping, there were none -- only burnt pieces on the cookie sheet.   As the pork was setting, I added the   juices from the pork  to the gravy.  Do try -- it got rave reviews from our guests but be careful not to overcook as a friend did.  Take it out at 150 to rest!  I will definitely make this over and over again.  Cheap, delicious meal!  For those who  wish to cook at 350, I think the very slow cooking time is what gives it the flavor and tenderness.  The timing really does work as boosting the  temperature up to 400 makes it nice and brown and taking  it out of the oven at 150 is perfect as it sets for a while.

Thought I would try something different than turkey for Thanksgiving...WOW!  This recipe was great and easy to prepare.  The sauce with port wine was gone before I knew what happened. I took the roast to an internal temp. of 155 and it needed another 10 minutes in the oven; roast was moist and everyone loved it.  UPDATE: Since my first review I have now doubled the gravy/sauce because everyone loves it.  Also, 1/2 way through the cooking I added some chicken stock to the pan so the drippings did not burn or stick to the pan; this made it very easy to scrape the pan for the gravy.

Sophisticated & soooo flavorful!  Not too difficult to prepare either.  I used a 3lb pork loin (rib section) & baked at 350 degrees for about 1 1/2 hours.  I broiled it at the end for a few minutes.  Perfect presentation & texture.  I used the same amount of ingredients from the original recipe (8lbs pork loin) & doubled the sauce at the end.  Way more than enough for two people.  Plenty of leftovers, which we plan to have tonight :)  Definately give this a try.

A good trick - add some chicken stock to the bottom of the pan every twenty minutes or so & stir w/the drippings.  It'll keep the bits from burning & you'll have plenty of "drippings" to make the sauce.  Great when you want to double the sauce.  Also, baste the roast each time you add the stock.  It keeps it moist and flavorful :)

A fabulous recipe!  I made this for a large dinner party and wanted to save some time, so I stuffed the loin the night before.  I think doing this allowed the garlic and rosemary flavors to completely permeate the entire body of the roast.  It was a complete success, and quite beautiful as well.

I served this for Christmas, and it was fabulous!!  I used a 4 pound pork loin to serve 8 people, and it was beautifully browned once done.  The only change I would suggest is instead of using whole garlic cloves to stuff it with, coarsely chop the garlic before cooking it in the olive oil, until soft.  Then, use the smaller pieces to stuff the loin along with the apricots (also coarsely chopped) and cranberries.  The pan sauce is amazing with the pork, and especially good on roasted garlic mashed potatoes.  This was yummy, my entire family raved about it!!

4.5 stars for the recipe itself, but 5 stars for taste. This was delicious and made the house smell so good while it was cooking. It was also not difficult to prepare, especially for what I would call a "special occasion" dish. My only complaint is that the temperature and cook time did not seem to make sense. 250 degrees seemed really low to me, as I have always roasted a tenderloin at 350 before, but I decided to follow the recipe to the T, at least the first time around. I scaled the recipe for a 2.5 pound roast- I plan to make the full scale, 8 pound version for Christmas, but wanted to do a trial run, and I'm glad I did! Anyhow, just as I suspected, the roast was nowhere near done when I went to check it and baste it as the recipe calls for. In fact, it was barely browned on the bottom, while the rest was still raw.  At that point, I increased the temperature to 350 for the rest of the time and it turned out fine. I am not sure if it matters that I used a smaller roast. Other than that, it was absolutely delish, different, and impressive looking! YUM! Thanks!

excellent, outstanding and superb!  we had this for christmas eve dinner with my parents and we all agreed that this recipe has won a special place in our family's traditional holiday recipes.  i had no trouble with the cooking time.  i thought i might, but it came out wonderful.  the pan drippings were even a little bit over done.  i did use a much smaller roast, about a 3 lb.  i will be making this meal again in about two weeks when my brother comes in for a visit.  next time i'll stuff the roast more and definitely make more sauce.  i served this with a caprese salad, the recommended roasted onions and mashed potatoes.  one last thought, the meal wasn't too heavy and didn't sit like a brick in my stomach like a lot of holiday meals tend to do.  best christmas eve ever!  1/14/06  i made this again for a visit from my brother, his family and my grandmother and her husband.  everyone raved (even the skeptics).  this time i used 2 3lb. roasts and still the cooking time worked perfectly.  we thought we might have leftovers, didn't happen.

I agree- you need to change the temperature. A 6lb roast will take about 1 1/4-1 1/2 hrs at 325`.  Use a working meat thermometer to check for doneness at 155-160`.  It is a beautiful presentation! I used dried apples instead of apricots, and also dried cherries(yum). My sauce did not come out "saucy" but more "brothy", but it tasted good, and I agree it should be doubled to have enough.  I will make this again! Thanks for sharing.

I made this last night and it was the best pork roast! Very moist. My family wasn't wild about apricots but they still ate it. I was wondering about using chopped tart apple instead...Had a 5 lb roast and roasted it @ 350 for 1 hour, 10 min then 400 for 20 min. Perfect!

Exquisite! Served this @ a dinner party to rave reviews. The only change I made was to use 1 (250 ml) bottle of apple jelly which made enough sauce for basting & serving. A keeper!

I first made this Christmas 2008 for family... They loved it.  I used apple and raisins instead of the apricot.  To have enough room I put it in a hot grill after the initial cook time.  This worked great and freed up the oven for other things.    I made it again last season for 40 persons.  Our neighborhood  Progressive dinner is a formal event. A committee makes the food for all the main course homes.  We followed the recipe except we added more gravy makings to have enough to send out to all.    We took the loin out at 130 degrees and after a short rest, we sliced into servings.  Then tied 8 servings togeather 5 times  then wrapped in heavy foil and refrigerated.  The next day we sent it out to the homes with the rest of the meal.  After gathering for appitizers we split up and went to dinner.  All the host/ hostess were very pleased.  They just put it in a 250 degree oven until they returned from gathering for Appitizers.   Pummped up the heat until loin was 150 degrees.....When we all gatherd again for Dessert the Pork loin was all they were talking about.     When we were sending out invites this year I again had requests for last years main course recipe... I would say over 1/2 of the people asked for the recipe then or now.

Absolutely Wonderful...I changed it only slightly by putting the roast in the crock pot all day(while at work) and came home and did the rest of the directions where you stick the roast in at 400 degrees! Turned out great...BTW I added sauteed mushrooms to the port sauce...

I made this for our Christmas Eve dinner two days ago, and what a success it was! I had found this recipe this past summer and decided to prepare this dish for our Christmas Eve dinner this year. I was looking for a new way of presenting a pork dish. Having been born in Cuba, I have been exposed to pork dishes for many, many years. Until I was 14 years old in 1968 and left the aforementioned country, pork was roasted over a pit on the ground, sometimes covered with banana leaves, other times with branches from the guava tree. On either case, it was quite delicious. This rosemary-scented pork dish just de-throned all the previous ones. I followed the recipe exactly as presented here. The only thing I did differently was that I doubled the sauce as suggested by several other members. It was a good thing I did. The gravy boat went around the table a few times and there was no gravy left when everything was said and done. Besides my wife and myself, there seven guests having dinner with us. The pork loin fed us all and there was enough for seconds. I will upload a photo of my attempt at this dish. This recipe is a keeper! Thank you very much!!

Oh my gosh !  This is the most delicious Roasted Pork dish that I have ever tasted ! And the presentation is beautiful. The family loved it !  Dont forget to buy the string to tie up the roast, so that you dont loose the stuffing, and helps keep the beautiful presentation shape.  Make extra sauce, it will go quickly. After about an hour, I started intermittantly adding chicken broth to the dripping pan so that the dripping for the sauce  would not burn.

Wow! A very impressive, affordable, and tasty way to feed a crowd. The sauce was a hit too. I sprinkled some cranberries and paprika on top of the roast for added drama when serving.  I used an 11 lb. loin and found I needed to increase the temperature to 300 and longer than 20 min at 425. Took 3hrs to cook. Definitely give this one a try, just be sure to leave plenty of time to ensure it is cooked before guests arrive.

Instead of the port wine sauce I made an apricot glaze to bake on top also reserving a little for post cooking sauce. I stuffed the pork roast with stuffing and diced up dried fruits. Wonderful taste! LOVE THUS RECIPE!

Tasty. Definitely double the sauce. I used raisins as well. Substituted hard apple cider for the chicken broth. Used dried rosemary. Would make again.

This was the BEST ever pork loin roast I ever cooked.  I did substitute apricot preserves for the apply jelly--only because I could not find the apple jelly.  My guests RAVED over this "over the top--restaurant quality"--meal.  Absoultely delish!!!

This was the 2nd year in a row I have made this for Xmas dinner and it is soo good and flavorful.  I followed recipe to the tee except instead of using cornstarch to thicken the gravy, I used a little bit of flour.  Be careful when adding the flour; make sure you use a whisk and keep it moving the whole time or else you will get lumps.  It tastes even better the next day.  We have been enjoying the leftovers.  Will make again and again!!

Excellent recipe.  I doubled the stuffing and sauce as recommended and was happy I did!  I made this for my Christmas dinner and everyone loved it!  One tip, I put the loins on a rack on top of the jelly roll pan and put some chicken stock in the bottom of the pan because otherwise the apple jelly and pan drippings burn.  Definitely try this recipe!

To save time, stuff nite before.
A good trick - add some chicken stock to the bottom of the pan every twenty minutes or so & stir w/the drippings. It'll keep the bits from burning & you'll have plenty of "drippings" to make the sauce. Great when you want to double the sauce. Also, baste the roast each time you add the stock. It keeps it moist and flavorful :)

It was ok. Really fruity. I thought it would be exotic and interesting, and I guess it was- but not something I'd do again. Noone touched the leftovers.

This was awesome. I didn't do exactly as written. I used garlic powder instead of 16 cloves garlic.  I did 3 slits instead of just one.  I used Riesling instead of port.  I will not go out and buy ingredients when i have perfectly good substitutes.  I did this on a 2.5 lb roast too rather than a 8lb.  We had seconds and thirds! I served with white rice this was so yummy!

oo lalala this meal was delish! Made this for xmas eve dinner and the scent of rosemary and garlic wafting from the meat was heavenly. The only thing I did different was to sear the loin before roasting. The outer layer was crisp while the inside was tender and juicy. All of my guests went for seconds and thirds. Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious, the pork was tender and juicy and had great flavor.  I have to say though I was not impressed with the port wine sauce.  No one at the table touched it, not sure what I did wrong with that.

I tried this for the first time with a houseful of people. I had to increase the oven temp because I didn't allow myself enough time to cook.  After an hour, I turned the oven up to 400 and just checked it every once in a while.  The color was wonderful and the port wine sauce was amazing.  I'll definitely make this again.

This is a delicious recipe! My mom wanted me to find a recipe for pork loin, so I found this one and she made it. The pork was so moist and the sauce was delicious! The only problem is that the sauce started to burn early on, so I would recommend waiting to add the apple jelly mixture until later so it won't burn.

I made this last Christmas for my family and got rave reviews.  As I was cooking it early to take to Christmas lunch I didn't do the glaze and just had a traditional crackling instead.  Wrapped it well in foil and it had the standing time in the car on the way to Mum's.  It was just nicely warm for lunch, moist and flavoursome, with excellent crackling.  The rosemary/cranberry combination was really good - a nice change from the usual apricot/prune stuffing.  I will definitely make this again.  With thanks from Sydney, Australia.

Wonderful way to use a pork loin. It was on sale this week at my local market and I prepared it for Sunday dinner. Excellent flavor! I added dried cherries to the fruit mix only because I had them. The sauce was superb! This is a real keeper. Many thanks!

Made this for Christmas dinner, and everyone loved it!  I had no apple jelly, so I used Red Currant instead.  It was DELICIOUS - try it for an interesting variation!  I used a 9lb. roast, so the 150 just wasn't cutting it.  After 2 hours in the oven, and about an hour before my guests were due to arrive, the internal temp was only 80 degrees.  I turned the oven up to 350 until internal temp was 130-ish, then turned up the heat to brown it.  Everyone raved about this pork and the gravy!  I thought it was too dry.  (I cook pork roasts weekly in my Romertopf, and they are always much more juicy).  I only gave the recipe four stars because the cooking times/temps do not scale well to different sized roasts.  I imagine the recipe works perfectly when using the authors originally intended roast size.

This recipe was a total hit at my Christmas Eve dinner. My Grandfather-in-law, who is a self proclaimed food expert said that this has renewed his faith in roasted meats! :) All the stuffing and herbs really permiated through the meat and it was simply outstanding! It was also so simple to make! It's a keeper!

I tried this recipe because it was rated so high AND I like Pam Anderson's recipes.  Boy, am I glad I did.  I halved the amount of pork I used because I was only cooking for 4 (and we still have lots of left over) but used the full amount of everything else (stuffing and sauce etc.) for the pork.  It tasted soooooo good and I am not even a pork easter.  I hardly cook pork because I cannot stand the smell of it but this tasted really good and I didn't notice the odor/smell I dislike of pork.  I will be making it again.

Beautiful recipe. The slight addition I made was to add some chopped walnuts to the stuffing.  Served with parsnips baked with maple syrup and paired with a lovely Pinot Noir.  I might search next time for an intensified version of the port-based sauce.  All in all, a very worthy alternative to standard holiday fare such as turkey, goose, duck or ham.

Woah was this a crowd pleaser! Had NONE left! It was tricky for me, I am a kitchen dabbeler, but it came out fantastic! The sauce from the drippings was divine! I wish I would have used more apricots, they were a divine find in the roast.

This was amazing! I changed it slightly by adding some walnuts inside the loin as well as the fruit. I also did not make the port wine sause and instead made a red wine reduction with cranberries. Unfortunately my sause turned out too sweet but otherwise everything was great! Small tip though I took out my pork at 130 degrees and let it rest. It was cooked to perfection!

My husband and I served this for a Christmas dinner party over the weekend.  We cooked it for about an hour at 250 and then turned up to 350 for remaining time.  I couldn't find apple jelly, but found apple jalapeno jelly which tasted spicy out of the jar, but couldn't taste the spiciness on the meat.  It tasted really nice.   We also used a dried fruit medley by Sunmaid, that had apples, apricots, prunes, etc in it.  It worked out really well.  Topped with the port sauce, this makes a very attractive and tasty main course.  We served it with scalloped potatoes (also an all-recipes recipes) and fresh green beans. I will make it again for my family for Christmas dinner! yum!

This meal was amazing!  I served it for Christmas dinner for 6 and everyone was raving for the next two days.  It was so tender and juicy.  My husband even made the comment, "how can it still be juicy as leftovers?!?!?"  

I used pears rather than apricots and the flavor was sensational.  I used two three pound pork loins with the same amount of stuffing for the inside.  I also doubled the wine sauce and it tasted delicious - the perfect topping.  The suggested sides were all a hit and it was all fairly easy to prepare.  Thanks for all  your rave reviews, I agree it really is "the Best!"

I bought a 7.75 pound pork loin that I thought was whole.  When I opened the package it turned out to be 2 halves.  No problem, I just used half the filling in each one.  I cooked them uncovered in a 15x10 jellyroll pan at 325 for 2 hours.  Then upped the temp to 400 for 15 minutes, then broiled to give the golden color for about 5 minutes.  There is confusing feedback for this recipe.  For example, I don't know how anyone ended up with a done on the outside, raw in the center unless they cooked it WAY too high.  Further, cooking at as I did rendered an EXCELLENT product, juicy, amazing flavors infused in the meat, cripsy on the outside where the marinade had caramelized, and done perfectly.  However, my meat thermometer registered 190 when I took it out of the oven.  Even when I moved it to another section of the meat to ensure it wasn't stuck in the filling it registered 180-190,but this was one of the juiciest roasts we've ever had.  I used the seasonings and fruits exactly as written and it turned out SO flavorful, the rosemary (used fresh) was not overwhelming at all.  I did not strain my pan juices and the sauce for this was fabulous.  I did add a handful of the cranberries to it as it simmered, the tartness of which cut the relative sweetness of the sauce perfectly.  I am giving this one 5 stars because despite being worried from the feedback I've read, turned out absolutely wonderful and is simple to make.  I will definitely be making this one again!

This recipe is wonderful. I followed it to a "T" and made it as one of three pork loins for Christmas Dinner for my family of 42.  My uncles are all super picky about their pork, but they gobbled this up, and it looked so lovely and smelled fabulous cooking. It was such a hit, I made it 2 weeks later for my mother's bible study and again rave reviews. This is a great showoff recipe!

This recipe was almost perfect - except for the apricots. They just seemed to overpower everything, and made the dish overall way too sweet. Next time I would love to dry tart apple slices in their place, and I am betting this would be a 5 star recipe. I also did not use fresh rosemary, I used dryed rosemary and I chopped it up (I just dislike the pine-needle-like texture).

The flavor was outstanding.  The only thing I did differently was I injected the fruit mixture because I did not have kitchen twine.  I also baked it at 350 for 4 hours (5 lb. roast) It was fall apart delicious.  Thank you.

Absolutely delicious and easy to make. Next time I will increase the amount of apricots, cranberries and roasted garlic.

My wife and I went nuts with this recipe, we never change anything the first time we make something, and the only thing we've done since was try different fruits. excellent, this is a keeper and it's been well used around here.

Didn't have Apple Jelly so substituted Apricot jam.  Didn't have time to make the port sauce but there was plenty of Au Jus and meat was tender and juicy.  Got rave reviews.

Wonderful and easy. Came out so elegant. I had an 8 pound roast and having concerns that the ends would be overdone before the center was cooked I cut it in half and prepared 2 separate roasts. I had 16 people for dinner. I stuffed it with the dried cranberries, roasted whole garlic & oil and dried apricots (whole). I could not get fresh rosemary so I used dried. Salt & pepper inside and out and brushed oil over the outside. I was concerned that the 250 temp was too low so I just roasted it at 350 for about 2 to 2 1/2/ hours. I couldn't find apple jelly so I used apricot. I did double the gravy recipe. It was very good with the port wine and the pan drippings. I really liked cooking it on the cookie sheet as it allowed all the sides of the roast to brown. All of my guests raved about the dinner. One of my guests was a Chef and he couldn't stop talking about it. Easy, wonderful and impressive. I will make this again and again.

Good starting point but the cooking technique was a problem for me - the 400 degree part at the end scorched the roast, burnt up the pan juices and ultimately it was dry.  Next time I'll sear it off in a pan, start at 400 then drop to 325 until a 150-160 internal temp.  Aside from that, the flavor was good.  Used dried cherries, blueberries and apples instead of apricots and halved the rosemary (I like the smell but not the taste) and subbed with fresh thyme.  Sauce made as directed and it was lovely.  As another poster said, I'd test run it before serving to company.

This was an excellent recipe that was made even better by the addition of peppered goat cheese.  At the point of adding the fruit and pan-roasted garlic to the cavity of the pork loin, I added about 6 oz of cheese, dotted throughout.  It added a lovely creaminess to the texture, and was a big hit at my Easter dinner.

I have just recently joined the AllRecipe.com group. Primarily because of this recipe... I have been here at this site for several years and have reffered it to many a friends. This recipe is one of the very best I have come across. Simple preparation. I used a 6.75 lb Pork roast, raised the initial cook temp from 250 to 260 for 1.5 hrs. added double the garlic (sliced it though) also sliced the apricots and halved the cranberries. Time was perfect, as was the temp of the Pork. Gravy came out great, was able to add juice from the roasting pan. Meal was delicious, juicy and tender. Served with Minnesota Potatoes, vegetables and Lobster tail. Will definately make again. Highly recommended. My compliments its creator.

I've made this a couple of times, the last time was at Christmas for a large dinner party.  Looks great, tastes better.  I cook it on the grill using a disposable aluminum pan.  As it cooks, add a little water to the pan if the pan starts to dry out.  You need a meat thermometer to tell when it's done, cooking times aren't very reliable when  grilling in Syracuse in winter.

This was a fantastic dish.  I used cherry essence prunes instead of apricots.  I used a 3 1/2 lb roast and the timing was a bit off.  At 90 mins it was already at 155, so for a smaller roast check the temp before 90 mins.  It was still very good.  My boyfriend thought it was not overdone, but I thought it was a tad bit tougher than I would have liked.  I would also bake in a smaller glass casserole dish rather than a cookie sheet.  The pan drippings burned on the cookie sheet. DEFINATLY double the amount of sauce.  It was the best part.

Wow, this is a keeper! I messed up the recipe a bit (carelessness in reading the directions), butit still came out perfect. I was impressed with how tender and moist the pork was - my pork usually comes out dry! This is so easy to make, but results in an impressive presentation (one guest said it looked like something from a magazine).

This was sooo good. I made this for a special dinner. I had over my son's future wife's parents for the first time, just days before the wedding. It was such a big hit. Her mother left with the recipe in hand. She could not get over how good it was. I also shared the left overs with our neighbor and she also requested the recipe! I added extra cranberries because I like them so much and I think they go great with pork. I will be making this for every holiday I can and then some. Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe.

This was a fairly easy, tasty recipe.  If you like rosemary, I would use quite a bit more - I didn't think the flavor came through nearly enough.  Other than that, it was as described!

OMG! You must make this. Best pork recipe I have ever had. I used a small 2.5 lb pork loin for 2 people and we have a little leftover. I used a meat thermometer and followed the instructions exactly - came out so moist and tender. I did add a little chicken broth to the bottom of the pan to loosen up the drippings and then used this when making the sauce and it was delish.

This recipe is incredible.  I made it for New Year's dinner and it got rave reviews.  The sauce with the port is so good, you could eat it with a spoon.  We are having leftovers tonight, but since there wasn't a lot of leftover pork loin, I'm going to fix a pork tenderloin that I have in the freezer.  I'm going to fix it the same way, and make extra sauce.  This makes a beautiful presentation.  I would make this for family OR the President of the United States!  It is truly impressive!  It is absolutely delicious and not at all hard to make.  Just takes a little time...but boy, is it worth it if you want to impress people!

This recipe will stay on my Christmas Eve buffet menu for good! I use an 8-11 lb. loin and the cooking time works out to be just over 11 min per lb. at 250 degrees. I put the apricots in last to hold in the cranberries(they sometimes fall out of the cavity. You have to really tie it up about every inch so you don't lose any of the yummy filling. It is time consuming, but worth it. 20 min at 400 degrees(even for an 11 lb roast) is sufficient. Don't over cook it after all that work! Everyone looks forward to this dish and the port wine sauce is superb. Thanks for the recipe.

This was a huge hit!  Delish!  I don't make substitutions usually when trying things for the first time, but I didn't have any port, so I used sherry and it was great.  Thank you!

This is an excellent recipe.  Easy and very impressive to serve.  I was generous with the olive oil.  Dried rosemary is fine to use though I used less than the 3 T. calleld for of fresh rosemary.  After I covered it with the extra oil, apple jelly, garlic and rosemary, I baked it, but did not finish the recipe with the wine, etc.  People were very impressed with this(The reciped was increased to served a party of 35).

This turned out gorgeous and delicious!  I went to 4 different stores looking for apple jelly and ended up using grape jelly instead since I thought it would go well with the port...and I was right! 
I didn't get any drippings either, just some burnt stuff. I did cook it on a rack.  Next time I will spray the bottom of my pan with PAM and add some liquid to the bottom of the pan. It went perfect with the Syrah tasting we did that night!

I am planning on making this dish for a Christmas dinner gathering. I have read all the reviews and if you brine any meat you will never have to worry about dryness. I will take all the reviews and create my own version and will return to post mine..Happy Holidays.

A very yummy roast with beautiful presentation. I doubled up on stuffing ingredients and everyone loved it. I'll be serving this again. The slow oven that gave some reviewers concern is the whole reason this becomes a moist, but beautifully browned roast.

This is a GREAT DISH.  I should have listened to the advise and doubled the sauce.  Not only is it good, but it is a beautiful presentation...I followed the recipe exactly.  I can't wait to make it again.

This went over great for Christmas dinner. It was fairly easy and looked delicious. I substituted dried figs for the apricots to avoid sulfites and that worked well. I think it would have been great with just the garlic and cranberries too.

Loved It!!!  I had to do a few modifications since I was using 'inventory' I had on hand, in my kitchen.  Dried Rosemary (not as good as fresh, but it was in stock).  Used Peach Preserves instead of Dried Apricots.  Used a Dried Berry Mix from my favorite discount Food Store Chain.  Cooked in 2C of Chicken Broth to keep it moist.  Flavor was AWESOME, serving it on a bed a Jasmine & Wild Rice blended together.  Smells & taste tested WONDERFULLY.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!!!

I have made this many times for dinner parties and it always turns out terrific. Made it again for Christmas dinner this year and substituted fig preserves for the apple jelly and added chopped dried figs to the stuffing. Delicious! This recipe is very scalable. I've made it with smaller loins up to an 8+ lb. loin. For tender, juicy pork, use a meat thermometer whatever the size. I roast to a final temp of 150 then let it rest covered with foil for 20 minutes and it's consistently perfect. Enjoy!

I made it for a regular weeknight meal (scaled down). I followed the recommendations of others to roast at 350 and finish at 400, which was great. The pork came out tender and flavorful, but the filing, which is the whole point of this recipe, was disjointed. You either got garlic OR apricot OR Cranberry

I do a quicker version of this too. Cut slits in roast, cook the garlic in oil, fill slits in meat with dried cranberries, add the oil in slits and all over. Salt the outside heavily, add the broth in the pan and cook low and slow.

Wow!I made this for company (taking a chance) but it was loved by
everyone.  I bought a 5 lb. loin roast for 6 people, but had way
too much left over and we've eaten pork for 4 days now. I didn't use
the juices left as it seemed a bit too fruity, so I just doctored up
a package of pork gravy and it went well with the mashed potatoes. I
will be sure to make this again.

I wanted to try this before I served it to company.  I added fresh baby spinach to the stuffing.  It was great! And the sliced roast looked beautiful with all the colors.  Very easy to make just a lot of steps.  It was a big hit.  I made a 4lb roast to serve 4 grown men and its almost gone!  The port wine sauce was amazing and a perfect accent to this roast.  Loved it!

Made this without the port sauce (because we had no pan drippings), and it was still delicious!  Loved the combination of sweet and savory flavors.  I used apple butter instead of apple jelly because I had it on hand, and it was a very rich flavor.

This loin was the best I have ever made, and I've made a lot over the years.  Just followed the recipe exactly except for cooking time and it turned out wonderful.  Took it out of the oven at 140 then put it under the broiler to brown.  PERFECT after resting for 15 minutes.

I made this for Easter dinner and it turned out pretty well.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it looked stunning on the table.  A few of my dinner guests actually gasped when I brought it out.  Score!  While I and my guests enjoyed this, I felt like it was lacking slightly.  I used a 6.25 pork loin (almost 2 pounds smaller than the recipe called for) and even so, the stuffing was really wimpy.  You could barely tell it was stuffed, which was part of the appeal.  I think the stuffing needs to be maybe even tripled or quadrupaled to be adequate, but that might be too much fruit.  I want to try the pocket stuffing method again (EASY AND BRILLIANT!!!) but maybe with something like a wildrice, mushroom, and sausage stuffing.  The port gravy was also good, but unlike any gravy I've ever tried.  It was a bit sweet and salty for my taste.  I appreciate this recipe for getting me to think/ cook outside the box though, and I will follow it again, except use a different, more substantial stuffing.

Made the full 8 lb. recipe & quad-druppled the sauce.  After letting it rest, I cut it in half & froze half the sauce & half the pork roast.  This was incredible!

I thought this recipe was OK. It seemed like more trouble than it was worth. It tasted almost identical to the Garlic and Rosemary Pork Roast I usually make but without the added chore of stuffing with cranberries, etc. I probably will not bother with this recipe again. Could probably get the effect of all this work with a simple apricot glaze.

The pork came out tender and the sauce was a great compliment. I had to triple the cornstarch though, the pork was organic and produced a ton a drippings.

Wonderful.  Servered for a special celebration dinner with mashed potatoes & sauted green beans.  I was nervous about the cooking time...afraid it was not long enough--even though my meat thermometer told me different.  The cooking time & temp. was spot on.  The meat came out so moist & flavorful.  I made no changes other then to double the sauce amount and was glad I did.

I halved the recipe and used a 4 lb loin roast and it certainly made plenty for my BF and I, with lots of leftovers.  And considering the roast was les than 8 bucks the recipe definitely a keeper. I can totally see myself serving this to company.  Next time I would probably mince and then saute the garlic as jrbaker suggested as the BF wasn't too crazy about the whole cloves.  I also coarsely chopped the apricots.  Although my roast was  at room temp, it did take quite awhile longer than the recipe stated (and the time was for an 8 lb roast too) so just give yourself some extra time.  The sauce was quite good though very sweet.  I think next time I'd like to try it with a more traditonal pork gravy (maybe drippings, chicken stock, white wine and some herbs).

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and it was so delicious.  Everyone loved it, especially the port wine sauce.  It seems a little daunting at first but once you start, it is really easy.  I highly recommend it in lieu of boring turkey.

This recipe was good. I substituted apricots for dried pears and used all the other original ingredients. It was a bit too sweet for my taste. I probably would not make this again. It was a good recipe, but I was the only one of my bunch that liked the sweet with the pork.

I used this recipe for Christmas dinner and it was a hit.  The pork loin was ultra tender and the apricots and cranberries infused the meat with a hint of sweet flavor that was not overwhelming.  Don't let the long name scare you because the recipe is overall very simple.

This was delicious.  I did double the sauce recipe as suggested and I did not strain out the bits when I made the sauce also suggested.  This recipe did not come in under $25 as someone said because I did buy hormone-free pork and that is a bit costly.  Nonetheless, it was not dry and the stuffing is delicious and not heavy like traditional stuffing with bread - will definitely make again.

I made this recipe on Sat for a dinner party for 8 people. It turned out wonderful. Moist and tender. I had a 5 pound roast and I roasted it for 35 minutes on 250 degrees and I was so worried it wasn't cooking I turned it up to 350 and it reached 150 degrees in another 35 minutes. I took it out and tented it and let it stay in a warming oven while we had our salad .I should have stuck to the plan , I'm sure it would have worked perfectly ...I'll try again when its just family. Anyway it was wonderful and the flavours were perfect!! Even though it had to wait for 30 min on warm it was fine!

This was good--I swapped the apricots for apricot jam and apple jelly for real diced apples.  I also used a pork shoulder instead but it was very good, nice flavors.  The only suggestion is to not put the jelly glaze on until the last 1/2 hour because it burns on the pan pretty badly (because of the sugar).

This was wonderful.  Followed the directions to the letter, for a change and it came out beautiful.  I will definetly make this again as I only had a 3.5 pound roast and I've got lots of cranberries and apricots left over.

I did this for friends for our Christmas day dinner and it was a huge hit.  I changed a couple of things only because of the ingredients I had on hand- I substituted one chopped fresh gannie smith apple for the apricots.  I placed slices of hickory bacon at an angle across the stuffed loin before I cooked it (I've found that the bacon keeps the pork moist and helps to make a great presentation before sliced).  My friends were telling others about how good it was at new years so I think it was a hit.

I made this for Christmas.   I also added prunes to the stuffing as well as the cranberries and appricots.  I overcooked it a little because my thermometer was off.  It was still very good and the sauce delicious.  I tripled the sauce recipe.

My mom and I made this for our family's Christmas dinner. We made it the day before and stored it in the fridge. I used a 4 pound pork loin, but kept everything else the same. The port sauce was way too much, but we didn't like it very much. I  misread the recipe and added the same amounts dried rosemary instead of using fresh, but that was my fault. Overall, too fancy to have very often. Nice though, for special occasions.

This was awesome.  I used a small pork tenderloin and just cooked it to the recommended internal temperature.  The flavor was great and meat very moist.  If you do a small tenderloin, reduce the rest time for the meat to 5-10 minutes or it will get cold.  This is a keeper.

This was delicious. I bought 2 1.5lb pork loins and used the exact amounts for the sauce and stuffing. I cooked them at 250 for about 90 mins and then turned up the heat to 425 for about 25 minutes. I removed them when they registered 150 degrees and they were fantastic!!!!

Mmmm-mmmm! I joined AllRecipes just to review this scrumptious dish. It was easy to put together ahead of time and the results were fantastic--moist, tender pork, a perfectly-balanced blend of sweet and savory flavors, and a port wine sauce that's amazing! I'll definitely be making this again and again.

I made this tonight with the following changes.  I used apple butter because that's what I had on hand.  I stuffed the roast with 3 chopped cloves of garlic and 1/8 cup of finely chopped fresh rosemary, 1/4 cup of dried cranberries and 1/4 cup of dried Montmorency cherries.  I added cup up potatoes and onions to the pan and roasted everything in a 350 degree oven for 1 1/2 hours.

I made this roast for dinner last night and it was fabulous.  The only thing I would change is not line the pan with foil, because I did not have any crusty bits in the pan. I would give it 5 stars. Ann

My husband and son made this for our large family Christmas gathering. It was done exactly as written (although I wouldn't call it no-fuss--it took a good 2 hours to prepare) but, boy, was it incredibly good. I'm usually not a fan of boneless pork loin because, for me, it's always turned out dry. But with this recipe the meat was incredibly moist and tender and was perfectly complemented by the filling. The whole family loved it.

This was amazing!  I cheated and didn't do the whole garlic cloves, just added minced garlic to the cavity.  Be sure and chop the rosemary up some before adding it.  I didn't have cranberries on hand, so I didn't add them - having just apricots was still fabulous!  I used cherry preserves instead of apple jelly (not a big apple jelly fan).  I served this with broccoli-cheese-rice casserole and steamed spinach.  Wow!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a good recipe.  I did take advice and stuffed it with apples.  I also did not brown on stove I glazed it with apricot preserve and roasted it at 350 for about two hours and let it rest for 30 min.  Will make again. Thank you.

Made this for dinner tonight. I only used a 3lb roast but still used all of the garlic. I chopped the roasted garlic up along with the apricots to make it easier to stuff and to insure everyone got some of each ingredient in the stuffing. I did not have Port so used regular red wine but it still came out great. I will totally make this again when company comes to dinner.

Fantastic flavors - I omitted the dried apricots and cranberries.  I used apricot jelly in place of apple jelly.  My family loved this meal.  I believe in the low & slow method for cooking meats. The meat just turns out more tender.

Tried this recipe on my family last night.  I had bought a bag of dried fruit at Wal-mart, one of those snack bags that have trail mix, etc. but this one had just dried pineapples, apples, raisins, apricots, mango, etc.  Turned out really yummy.  Thanks for sharing.

Not only was this a beautiful presentation, but it tasted fantastic!  The sauce is just out of this world.  I doubled up on the sauce, and even the apple jelly called for when brushing the loin, and had no problems with the sauce it creates burning while cooking.  I added a bit more olive oil as well, maybe that helped.  I did think the 16 cloves of garlic called for would be too much for my 5 pound loin, so I put 10 and regret it.  I wish I used all 16 because there was hardly any garlic flavor there (maybe because I prepared the loin the night before and the garlic lost it's flavor?).  But over all it was a fancy meal, my guests were very impressed and they all asked for the recipe.  Everyone "ooohhh'd and aaaahh'd all night long over this! I served the loin with rice, homemade mashed potatoes, broccoli with garlic, olive oil and raisins, and a spinach-strawberry salad from this site.

Fantastic. A little time-consuming, but worth it. Following another reviewer's semi-recommendation, and considering I had a lot of other fires to tend, I stuffed my loin the night before and just let it soak up the flavors. Also, as I don't care for apples (I know), I replaced the apple jelly with mango jelly, which I wholeheartedly endorse. I had to cook at 325 because of other issues, but I felt OK with that given what others said, and I even got to finish it at 400, but for closer to 10 minutes than 20. I'm convinced: what makes this amazing is the stuffing and the sauce. So any method that cooks the meat thoroughly but not too much will work.

Great recipe.  I followed the recipe as instructed except that I also mixed the port wine in with the stuffing.  I served it with carrots and potatoes that I baked with the tenderloin after about an hour of it baking by itself.  Excellent dish!

My husband made this for our Sunday dinner and I have to say that this was not only beautiful, it was absolutely delicious--our picky kids even ate it!  The pan sauce was divine and was a perfect compliment to the roast and the white rice we had on the side.  Will DEFINITELY make again, thank you.

I tried this, but used beef loin instead of pork. I used red wine in the dripping sauce. It turned out really great.

My family is not big on other meats other than venison but they loved this loin roast. I didn't have the port wine but just used white cooking wine might make a difference but none the less it was a hit!!!

Get up and Dance!  My 5 year old nephew, who can be a picky eater, exclaimed.."This meat is good!  It makes me want to get up and dance!"  Have made it several times and it's the most requested from friends for special occasions.

The timing on this recipe works out perfectly. I know it doesn't seem possile, but it does work. When you let it rest, it does continue cooking. I know by accident. My  pork loin had a built in thermometer. (I had to cut around it to stuff it) The middle had not popped out when I took it out of the oven. After letting it rest for the allotted time, the thermometer had popped!

My husband loved it. The sauce was excellent--double it. I didn't care much for the apricots, but I'm not an apricot fan.I'd be interested in trying  apples and cranberries.

This dish was fantastic.  I changed it quite a bit to fit what i had, but it came out perfectly.  The dried fruit in the middle adds so much.  The gravy is also superb.  I roasted sweet potatoes with it and garlic green beans.  Just a wonderful dish.

This recipe was better as leftovers when the flavors were able to meld. I used 15 cloves of garlic, chopped apricots/apples/cranberries, and hardly any rosemary (it's just too overpowering).  This recipe has great potential.  I will make it again - but I highly recommend skipping the apricots, and shredding the apple and double the roasted garlic.

I could not find apple jelly at my supermarket so I substituted with plum jam. Quite good. To save time, I also chopped together the apricots and cranberries and mixed in the seasonings and herbs before stuffing it in the pork. Delicious and attractive.

Cook this for yourself first before trying for company. I followed the directions to a T and the majority of the pork was so dried out my company could barely chew it, while the very center was a red-raw core. I'd stick the meat thermometer into the center and it wouldn't rise high enough. But anywhere outside of the center, and it would shoot up way too high. What a disaster. I chalk it up to the 250-degree oven. Who has ever heard of that? Why did I trust that? I'm giving it two stars because the flavor was ok. I thought the gravy was a little too sweet. Oh well, at least I had an abundance of side dishes for everyone to fill up on! Next time, I'll stick with simple and simply delicious. (Oh yeah, this recipe was a lot of work, too.)

I made this recipe for Christmas dinner and my family LOVED it!  Not only does it taste great, but it looks good as well.  I did have to turn up the oven to 300 degrees after a while though...it just wasn't cooking fast enough.  Also, next time I'll chop up the dried apricots.  Otherwise it was wonderful!!!

I made this recipe at the last minute one weekend and it was great. I didn't have any apple jelly, so I substituted whiskey marmalade that I'd been saving. The flavor was incredible. I do think that next time I will substitute another spice for the rosemary or use less rosemary as it was a little overwhelming.

sooo yummy....since I was only serving my husband and myself I used a much smaller roast but the same amount of sauce as other reviewers suggested. It turned out perfect although the extra apple jelly glaze on top of the roast carmelized nastily in the pan and meant there were no brown bits for the gravy...otherwise no problems though and shouldn't be a problem with a larger roast.

I loved this but found the temperature confusing - we followed others' advice and did 350 instead.  Took about 1 1/2 hours for a 6 lb. roast - probably could have cooked it a little else. Anybody else have problems with temp & time? I'd love to try it again!

Not at all what I thought it was going to be. I think I might have used too much rosemary. It was not the "big hit" I thought it would be with my family, and I followed the recipe to the "T". I Won't be making this again.

I made this for a bridal shower and it has been raved about ever since.  Because I had so much else to prepare, I served it without the sauce.  I imagine it would be even tastier with that addition!

This recipe is great. Leaving a comment not only because it was awesome, but also it was impossible to find Apple jelly for the glaze that goes on the pork just before it heads into the oven. I used peach preserves.  Any preserve that goes with rosemary would work. Think that through before you get too creative. ;-)

Great flavourful pork recipe! Be sure to monitor the temperature closely because overdone lean pork will be very dry. The port sauce is a real winner!

I used two pork tenderloins for a dinner party of four. I was able to do all ahead that morning except for sauce at the end. It was, without doubt, the best pork I’ve ever eaten... gourmet, totally gourmet. All three guests raved

This recipe was amazing! I served a 5 lb pork loin for New Years Day dinner for 12.  I roasted the garlic before using it in this recipe, substituted peach pepper jelly for the apple jelly, and left out the cranberries. I fileted the roast, spread the filling over it, then rolled it like a pinwheel. For the sauce, I used a full cup of port but let it simmer and reduce while the roast was cooking.  Everyone loved it!

Made using 2 pounds pork tenderloin and scaling back ingredients.  Having temps to check was do helpful in decreasing cooking time.  Made double sauce recipe. LOVED it.

This was absolutely stunning. I made it as a special meal for my husband on father's day. Instead of one huge pork loin I used 2 small ones, totaling 4 pounds. I used the same amount of stuffing and based on the reviews doubled the sauce. I was not disappointed! The sauce was a hit, and the pork was cooked perfectly. As long as you use an actual meat thermometer and cook to the right temperatures this will turn out properly, juicy, and perfectly cooked.

This recipe is just awesome! I used a 2 lb. roast but did not adjust the other ingredients. Let it cook t 250 for about 2 hours when the internal meat temp was 170. It was fantastic but I think I will only roast it to 150 next time which will keep the ends of the smaller roast less well done!

No Port or Apricots.  Used White Wine,  pineapple juice and mixed fresh fruit.  Only time the pork.
Hold off on fruit for 30 minutes.  Licked the plates.

When you want to show off for your dinner guest this is definitely the recipe to follow. I could not find kitchen twine so I wrapped the loin in bacon. Best substitution ever!!!

This was KILLER GOOD. Though my family eats Paleo. I used a large Pyrex baking dish and surrounded the meat with baby carrots and peeled/chopped purple sweet potatoes.  I tossed the vegetables in a bowl with 1/4 cup olive oil and a light sprinkling of cayenne , 1 tsp. garlic powder and 1 tsp. salt. I substituted "Sugar Free" Apple Butter for the apple jelly. Tapioca flour for the cornstarch. 
    As a side dish I sautéed peeled and chunked apples (I sprinkled with "Apple Pie Spices" and and 1 TBL. honey, then toss to mix. Saute in very hot coconut oil until golden on two sides. Turn off heat and stir apples, let stand while preparing the gravy. The apples need to cool a bit before serving.

FABULOUS! Would be a show-stopper for company! I reduced the recipe for a 2 lb pork tenderloin, and next time, would cut the apricots in half because they were sticking out a bit with such a smaller "roll" of meat. I may try to cook this in a crock pot next time as well too...anyone have a guess as to how long that would take?

Delicious and absolutely beautiful.  The first time I made it was for Christmas dinner and it was as good as I thought it would be, just as written!  Next time I may thicken the sauce a bit more so you can slurp up every drop. Thanks for sharing this recipe.  All my guests raved and took pictures!

We made this for Christmas Eve and it was loved by all- even the kids! Not a lot of leftovers with this dish. We will definitely make this again!

This recipe came our GREAT!  We ate it for Christmas dinner and my family raved about it.  I chopped my apricots into fourths, chopped my garlic after I browned, and used a hard apple cider in place of the chicken broth (because we had it on hand) it but other than that I pretty much followed the recipe to a T.  The port sauce was great with the pork as well.  I did use a 4 1/2 pound roast so I adjusted the cooking time and ratios accordingly and had no issues.  Definitely pour broth or cider in the bottom of the pan when cooking because the pork will not give off a ton of drippings and you need the liquid for the sauce.

Awesome recipe with the ingredients listed. Cut the size down unless you are cooking for a big dinner party. I used a 4 pound loin roast and served 4 with plenty of leftovers. Don't skimp on the garlic, as the jelly & apricots add a nice bit of sweetness.

We could not find apple jelly and substituted apple/cranberry butter.  Worked out great.  The pork was a bit dry, but the gravy helped.  We served it with scalloped potatoes.

Excellent dish will make this again.  I doubled the sauce as advised in previous posts, had a lot left over and did not want to throw it out, so used it as a base for a grd beef pot pie it was so good I had no left overs should have fed 6 but DH and son ate 3/4 of it.   Back to the Roast this is a keeper and will make it again next time will tent it with foil in a smaller baking pan so that I have a bit more juice otherwise no changes where made.

This was a very impressive dish that I made for Xmas.  I am not a good cook by any means, yet this recipe was easy enough to follow and turned out great!!  I added apples and prunes to the stuffing mix.

Great tasting roast. Easy to prep. Make sure roast is at room temp before putting in oven. Cooking times were perfect.

Not really a rosemary fan, but this recipe just sounded too good to pass up. I think it's normal for pork, but my roast was kind of dry. I substituted red cooking wine for the port so I cannot testify to what the sauce might have tasted like (our's was tasty), and I only had cinnamon apple jelly on hand, though really, no one could taste the cinnamon (the giveaway was the coloring-the jelly was red and that made the whole roast pink! lol) Overall, I definitely plan to play around with it and give it another shot!

This pork loin roast was served at my Christmas Dinner party and turned out beautifully. The meat was moist and the apricots and cranberries gave it a refreshing citrus kick! Not only was this reciepe easy but it looked very gourmet!

I used wooden skewers to keep it tied up since I didn't have any appropriate string to use. It worked well.

I will definitely add this one to my recipe box.  This turned out very delicious and moist.  The sauce compliments the pork and what is stuffed in, yummmm...  I plan on making this one for dinner guests and holidays.  I thought it was fairly easy considering how impressive it tastes!  Thank you for the wonderful recipe...
