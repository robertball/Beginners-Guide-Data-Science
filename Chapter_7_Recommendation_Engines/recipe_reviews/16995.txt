Incredible. I'm from San Diego, so must, must, MUST have lots of flavor and spice in my meat, 'cause I'm used to it! Can't throw a rock without running into authentic Mexican food here. The flavor of this is just like that juicy, spiced shredded beef you dream of. Not-blow-your-head-off hot to my palette. Just right.

Cooking time: using a 3 pounder, we cooked 8 hours on low overnight. At 8 hours, the meat was falling apart; removed it, shredded with two forks, spooned off the fat in the Crock pot, removed a majority of the onions/peppers via a slotted spoon, returned mixture to Crock Pot juice and cooked on low for 1 1/2 hours. This is important; it allows the spiced juice that has formed overnight to really get in that meat.

Spices: used a 5 oz. bottle of Tapatio hot sauce. Increased chili powder to 1 TBS and added 1 1/2 tsp. of cumin, because what's Mex without cumin? Green peppers: used de-seeded chopped fresh jalapenos. Added a beef boullion cube like other posters recommended.

When you replace the beef, now shredded, into the pot to simmer, add 1/2 tsp. of additional cumin and 1 tsp. of paprika. Trust me, this is key.

Best part: your first meal of the morning can be Machaca; combine a handful of shredded beef, 4 eggs (beaten), 1/2 cup of veggies of your choice (we used onion/yellow pepper), stir in pan till done, spoon into ripped up flour tortillas and eat.

This was so simple, and with a few changes became the ultimate shredded meat recipe!

Following other reviewers suggestions, I didn't brown the meat, just put it in the crock pot and cooked it on high for 5 hours, then shredded the meat and put it back in the crock pot for another 2.  

I then put all of it (including liquid) in a large saute pan over medium heat (I added no oil) and fried it until all the liquid had evaporated and the meat was slightly browned.

This turned into the most intense, flavorful shredded beef I have ever tasted -- everyone LOVED it!

I have been using this recipe for 2 years now.  It is excellent when chicken is substituted & paired with the Red Enchilada Sauce (also on this site) for a outstanding chicken enchilada dish.  

Also, whenever chuck roast goes on sale, I buy one & cook it with this recipe & then use it for the beef filling in the Beef Tamales on this site as well.  It makes a lot, so I freeze half of them in gallon size freezer bags - then when I want to eat one, I just steam it for about 15 minutes - so good! They hold in the freezer for 6 months. 

This really is a wonderful base recipe that you can use with all meats to make fillings for all sorts of dishes. And, its easy!

I have to VERY much agree with the reviewer who called this 'atomic beef'.  My husband and I both enjoy spicy foods, and were especially looking forward to a spicy meal since we were both having bad allergy days and could use a little spice to clear out our sinuses.  Well, once I shredded up this roast, we tasted it and threw it out.  If you got a piece from the middle, it had NO taste whatsoever, and if you happened to get a piece from the outside, it was SO hot it burned your head off...and is still burning the inside of my stomach.  This recipe is the same idea as all those stupid BBQ sauces that try to be hot just for the sake of being hot.  There needs to be layers of FLAVOR in spicy food, not just 'burn your tongue' hot sensations.
Definitely will NEVER make again, and would not recommend...and for those who are wondering, I had about a 3 pound roast, and I used about 3 oz. of tabasco sauce, 1/2 of the chili powder, 1/2 of the cayenne, added some cumin (just cause I love cumin), and threw a couple of veggie boullion cubes in with the water.

Added cumin and beef broth based on other reviews, but felt it still lacked "something".  Upon taking the first bite all you can taste is "hot" as in spicy with not much complexity in flavors.  The flavor never seemed to truly develop which left for a disappointing finish.  Based on all the great reviews, I expected more....  It's good, but doesn't knock my socks off.

What wonderful aromas as this cooks!  I was burning some lavender candles the day this was cooking and I couldn't smell the lavender... but I didn't care!

I like spicy, but had to adapt it for the children (they like spicy too - but their mouths are still more delicate than ours).  I reduced the amount of hot peppers because I used jalapenos and they were severe, and omitted the cayenne.  For chili powder, I made my own using paprika, oregano and cumin.  It was just right for everyone!  We had half the meat in tacos the first day, and tonight I'm making the remaining meat and sauce into a savoury stew with potatoes, zucchini, green beans, pinto beans, and corn rounds.  A bit of arroz blanco, and we're set!

Here's one tip which adds immeasurably to the sauce (and I'm surprised the recipe author didn't say this):  after browning the meat, dump a cup of water or stock into the pan to deglaze it, scraping up any browned bits.  Add this liquid to the crockpot along with everything else.

I made this for a different Easter dinner. It is quite delicious. I did make some modifications based on what I had on hand. I used a red onion, 1 small can of diced green chiles, 1/2 tsp cumin and because of previous comments about the spiciness, I used a 3oz. bottle of Louisiana Hot Sauce and substituted beef broth for the water. Finally, I cooked the meat about 5 1/2 hours on high and 3 1/2 hours on low. It has a nice little bite but was not spicy enough for me.  Next time I'll use 5 oz of hot sauce. I may also add a can of Mexican spiced tomatoes.  

A SLOW COOKER TIP: Spray the inside of your crock pot insert with non-stick spray before adding ingredients. It makes clean up a breeze, especially with dish which really got to bubbling.

My husband is addicted to this meat.  I make it almost weekly and we use it in everything ... nachos, burritoes, salad, soup, etc.  It freezes very well for a quick meal.

Great! Serving it on a Mexican buffet for a Super Bowl party.  I used a small can of green chilis with the juice, and a 2 oz. bottle of hot sauce.  I also used 6 pounds of meat and added 1 teas of cumin, and it was plenty spicy. Enough that it lingers in your mouth, but not too hot!

Que rico!  I made this for a huge fight party (DeLaHoya vs Vargas) and it was a great hit. Easy to prepare, I made up two roasts (doubled the recipe). Served it buffet style with bolillos (french style rolls), finely shredded lettuce, thin sliced tomatoes and the usual condiments.  Boy, did they eat them up, and it was the easiset party food ever!  The remaining beef was great at midnight when everyone was hungry again..we tossed the leftover meat in a skillet with a bunch of scrambled eggs.  Big hit.  Thanks for sharing!

I took the recipe statement "please season to taste" to heart (especially after reading all the reviews) and got a wonderful outcome.  I used a 5lb roast (trimmed).  Put in a whole bottle of Chalulla's Chile & Garlic hot sauce.  The sauce plays SUCH an important role in this dish so go with something special like chipotle flavors or this garlic blend.  Who wants to taste vinegar?  Of course I dosed it up with a few tbsp of Emerils Southwestern blend and some cumin.  Also used beef broth instead of water.  Of course the seasoning is not going to hit the center of the roast folks, that's why you shred and return to the pot to simmer - then it absorbs the juices!  This made a lot of meat so when I stored it I added a cup or more of the juice (strained) into the container.  Just made some Machaca this morning and it was PERFECT!  This is a GREAT recipe if you follow the few extra tweaks needed.  This goes in my "keeper" file.

This makes wonderful burritos.  I only used 8oz. of green chilies, and added a can of Rotel.  I used beef stew meat in place of the roast.  It was too watery in the crock pot, so after about 5 hours of cooking, I transfered it to a large stock pot and boiled down some of the liquid on the stove.  I shredded my meat with 2 forks and used this as a burrito filling along with refried beans and cheese.  YUMMY!!

Great recipe!!  Used this to make chimichangas.  Spread a small amount of sour cream on tortilla, piled meat on top, topped with a couple slices of monterey jack cheese and folded all sides over.  Then I put them on a pan brushed them with butter and baked at 375 degrees until golden brown.  Served on a bed of lettuce with nacho cheese, sour cream, and black olives on top.  Best ever!!!!

Holy smokes this was good!!  Definitely tasted like the authentic shredded beef I love from my favorite Mexican taco shops in San Diego that I've been dying for out in the Midwest!! I'm such a happy camper that I found this!  I used another less fatty roast, I think it was a rump roast, the chuck roast just looked way too fatty to me... I followed the recipe and wasn't sure what to do for the green peppers so I used a bananna pepper and an ancho pepper.  I cooked on high 4 hrs, flipping it once.  Then I cut the meat up into large chunks and cooked another 5 hrs on low... It was a long time to wait but so worth the wait...served on warmed corn tortillas with shredded lettuce, a squeeze of fresh lime, avocado and a little cilantro... To die for!!  Thank thank you for this recipe!

I couldn't think of any reason NOT to give this recipe 5 stars. It turned out great!!  I made it REALLY SIMPLE for myself since I'm a marginal cook at best and my husband is a VERY PICKY eater.  

This is what I did: I used a 2 lb. roast, I did NOT brown it 1st on the stove. I just put it in the crockpot (after cutting off the fat) with:

1 tsp Salt, 1 tsp Pepper, 1 cup diced green chiles, 1 tsp chili powder, 1 tsp cayenne, 1 tsp garlic powder, I didn't use the full 5oz jar of Tapatio, but I used about 3 oz (cuz my bottle wasn't full.) I used 1 TBSP Cumin, instead of water I used about 1/2 can beef broth, and 1/2 bottle beer, and I threw in 1 beef bouillion cube just for fun.

I cooked it on high for about 5 hrs until it was shreddable, then I just shredded it right in the crockpot (why get more dishes dirty, taking it out & putting it back?) after it was shredded I let it cook on low for about another hour so all of the juices would soak in the meat and that's it!  

It was soooooo ez, just throw all of the ingredients in at once & GO! My husband loved it and we had left overs the next day.

We really enjoyed this, though with all of the seasoning called for, it would have been much too hot for us.  I seared my roast in a cast-iron pan to get it good and hot so it would brown really well.  Changes to accommodate our palates:  used a 7oz can chopped green chiles, a 4oz can chopped jalapenos, 1/4tsp cayenne, and about 6-10 good dashes of hot pepper sauce.  That was hot enough for us without masking the flavor of the beef.  Served on white corn tortillas as soft tacos with chopped tomatoes, onion, lettuce, salsa, & shredded cheddar.  Delish.  Thanks, Charley.

Oh yeah, baby! The roast is great in any Mexican dish you can think of - tacos, burritos, huevos revueltos, whatever. It also freezes well in little freezer baggies for future meals. Just defrost in the fridge for at least 24 hours prior to assembly of your meals.

Oh my, this is SOOO Good!  I cooled it down a bit (no cayenne or hot pepper sauce, increased chili powder and used 1/2 jar of pepperocini's with juice instead of green chilis) and didn't lose a bit of the flavor.  I'm glad I made the whole recipe, 'cause now I have left-overs!  Thanks Charley for sharing.

I made this and loved it.  I used a deer roast.  When it was done, I took a bite and thought it was too hot, but then continued shredding the meat to use for tacos.  I added the shredded meat back into the juice it was cooked in, and let it soak it up.  It was wonderful, not hot at all like the first bite was.  It blended well into the juice, and it was just right, actually when I reheated it the following night I added more red pepper sauce.
My husband talked about it for a week, and told my other family members that came over for a party about it.  I will make it again and have everyone over for it next time.

Five stars since picky 11-yr old son couldn't get enough.  I reduced the amount of ground cayenne pepper and hot pepper sauce by half.

Oh my gosh! I made this recipe using a 4lb pork roast and it was amazing! I didn't brown it, I just threw it right into the crockpot. I combined all the other ingredients in a bowl, then poured it over the pork. I left it on low for 10hrs. It took me literally one minute to shred all of it- I just pressed on it with my fork and it fell apart. I then dumped all the shredded pork and all the liquid into a large pot and cooked it on medium/high until all the liquid was evaporated...about 20min, making sure to stir occasionally. We made pork soft tacos with freshly made pico de gallo and guacamole. My whole family gave it rave reviews and I keep getting into the leftover pork to eat it straight from the bowl! Yum!

Very tasty! Using many of the recommendations here, I added sliced onions and peppers to bottom of crock pot then put roast on top. Seasoned it with Adobo seasoning, cumin, garlic powder, chili powder, cayenne pepper. Added 1 cup of beef broth, can of tomatoes with green chiles, and 1 can of green chiles. Finally, added 1/4 cup of Frank's Red Hot. I was worried about the heat but it was fine. I used a 5lb chuck roast and cooked on high for 7 hours, then shredded and returned to liquid-filled crock for another 90 minutes. That was key.

This recipe didn't have a lot of taste. Without the cumin that some suggested, this would just be "hot" roast. Even as a Texan used to heat, I was glad I cut back on the hot sauce. I'll look for a Carne Guisada recipe next time.

This was restaurant quality!  So easy for so much flavor. I did cut down the hot sauce to 1/4 cup and I am glad I did because it was spicy enough for me.

This is a great way to prepare a tender roast, and a different flavor from the usual pot roast.  My 3 pound chuck roast shredded easily after 8 hours.  I chickened out on the full bottle of hot sauce, using only about 10 shakes.  I subbed 2 7 oz. cans of chopped green chilies (mild) for the fresh(?), and added 1 bouillon cube and 1 c. water to the slow cooker before I put the lid on.  Next time, I will use only 1/2 c. water.  I used the other seasonings as directed.  After shredding the meat, I allowed the liquid to cool and de-fatted it, then reduced it by half and added 1/2 tsp. cumin and 1/2 tsp. smoked paprika, then put it and the meat back in the slow cooker until ready to serve.  I served it on flour tortillas with lettuce, shredded cheese, salsa and/or sour cream.  The heat was about 2 out of 10, for us.

This meat is excellent and it freezes very well.  Followed recipe except for a couple of changes.  Reduced tabasco to 1/3rd cup and canned jalapenos to 4 oz.  Did not brown.  Cjooked for 5 hrs. on 


high, then shredded and 


put back in the sauce for 1 hr. on low to soak up 
more flavor.  It came out perfect.  The first night we make tortas with beans and the meat.  The secone night we made tacos with cilantro, onion, tomatoes and lettuce.  Everyone raved about them.

As written, this recipe is just "okay". I went by the recipe exactly, with the exception of substituting beef broth for water. After 6 hours in the crockpot on high, the beef was extremely tender and very easy to shred. However, I tasted the sauce and it seems to be a lot of heat with minimal flavor. (I used my favorite hot sauce- Tapatio). My boyfriend and I LOVE spicy food, but the flavor just wasn't what I expected. To make this dish a 5 star recipe, after I shredded and set aside the beef, I removed about 1/3 cup of the cooking liquid and replaced it with more beef broth. Then, I added about 2 teaspoons of chopped fresh garlic, 2 teaspoons of cumin, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 1 1/2 teaspoons of onion powder, 1/2-1 teaspoon of chili powder, 3 bay leaves, 1/2 teaspoon of dried oregano, and 1/4-1/2 teaspoon dried mustard. (Please note that I didn't really "measure" these spices, I eyeballed them, but these are estimates.) I know this sounds like a lot, but at this point I was determined to get the flavor I was looking for, and I had these handy spices in my cabinet. After adding these spices to the liquid, I added the shredded beef and cooked on high for one hour and low for another hour. After these changes, this beef was EXCELLENT! My hispanic boyfriend said these were the best tacos he's ever had (that's a HUGE compliment from him). So, this recipe is a decent base but I needed to add more layers of flavor and depth to it to make it perfect.

Well I didn't make the recipe as listed, I made adjustments according to the most popular review and it was AMAZING. Everyone that ate it raved about it and asked for the recipe. If you are going to stick with the recipe on the site, it is essential that once the meat is tender enough to be shredded, you shred it and then leave it in the crock pot for 1 1/2-2 hours more.

I only have this recipe two stars AS IS with no changes, after extreme changes I would maybe push to 3, possibly four. I only prepared a 2lb. piece of meat, so all ingredients were divided in half (except for c. pepper which I only used a tiny dash). I used Tabasco as my option for the pepper sauce. After just 3 hours on Low, this meat was overdone, time for a 4lb. roast as listed would be between 8-10 hours total at High for the first 6...so my reduction in roast size should have been a total of 4-5 hours with 3 of them being on High...I can't imagine how tough the roast would have been then! Once cooking was through, the meat was very tough and dry, and there was no way it was going to "shred." There was so much liquid in the pot (and I even used less water than stated) that I would have had to drain off at least 3/4 of it if I were to proceed with the recipe as stated. After tasting the meat and discovering that not only was it dry, it was also Hot! Not spicy, I mean ATOMIC HOT. Hot enough to make you cough, yet strangely lacking any flavor besides HOT. Not wanting to waste food, I did a quick "rescue" which included adding about 3 cups of sour cream to the "sauce" and then thickening it, cutting the meat into tiny strips and soaking them in the sour cream'd sauce and then serving over rice in burritos with plenty of salsa to further soothe and cool the burn. I salute those of you who were able to make this as is and then actually consume it in it's original form!

SO ONO!  We love it!!  I use my pressure cooker & turns out GREAT, approx. 7 mins per lb of meat.  I start timing when reg. rocks.  First I season my roast, sear in pan & throw everything else in.  That's it.  We fine tuned it too our taste buds...no cayenne, hot sauce gave enough heat, & doubled ALL of spices, & used canned chopped green chiles.  If roast is too large, just cut in half. Ate w/ corn tortillas & the next day (tastes even better)used the meat on nacho chips.  When I finally bought a slow cooker, followed recipe exactly & I prefer the pressure cooker method, you can tell the difference in flavors.

This recipe is a great starter, but you do have to tweek it to make it "perfect".  I didn't brown the meat - no need to since you're going to shred it anyways.  Added 1 1/2 tsp of cumin as suggested by others.  After 6 hours on high, shredded the meat and added back into the slow cooker.  Added addn'l 1 1/2 tsp of cumin, 3 cubes of beel boulion and cooked for another hour or so.  This was really good...and we have enough meat for anohter meal tonight!  It's a beautiful thing.

Amazing!  I followed the directions exactly, and was afraid that it would be too spicy - especially with all of the hot pepper sauce.  The heat was perfect.  I threw this on a plate with shredded cheese, lettuce, salsa, and a little sour cream.  Ate with flour tortillas.  My husband made tacos with this, and it was just as good. I'm with the other reviewers - next time I'll make two, so I'll have some left over to freeze.

I have made this tons of times now for home, potluck, showers etc.  I have used beef, chicken and pork.  The only changes that I have made is I don't sear the meat unless I'm in a hurry and want to cook off some of the grease.  Put in crock pot, let cook for about two hours on high about four hours on low, drain the grease, add the rest of ingredients. And of course use hot sauce to your preference. Sooo Sooo Good.

While this recipe was certainly edible and good, it tasted simply like spicy pot roast to me.  I was expecting a dish with its own personality.  So from that standpoint, I was disappointed.  I probably won't make this again, not because it was unappetizing, but mostly because it didn't knock my socks off.

Great recipe!  Used the onion, and spices, but only a little of the hot sauce, and substituted Rotel for the green chilies.  I skipped the skillet, and cooked it on High for 4 hours, shredded the meat and cooked 2 more at low.  It was wonderful.  My picky wife and (2) eight year olds loved it too!

Charley said venison could be used and so venison it was. I followed the recipe exactly and had wonderful results. Garnish with jalapeno, onions, cilantro, sour cream, and a squirt of lime and you have yourself a party. The only thing I might do differently next time is add some cumin in the last 2 hours of cooking but only because I love the flavor in my tacos.

Quite simply this recipe is PERFECT!  I followed the recipe ingredients exactly (using Tapatio for the pepper sauce.)  The only change I made was cooking time - I placed in the crocker for 8 hours on low, removed the onions to a bowl, removed and shredded the beef, and then placed the meat back in the crocker on low for one more hour.  When it was done I remixed it with the onions and served on soft flour tortillas with avocado, lettuce, and tomato.  I have already transcribed this to my recipe book - it absolutely a keeper!

WOW!!  This was so good.  I wasn't quite sure how it would turn out, thinking the meat would be tough.  I even had a backup dinner ready in case it wasn't good but it was outstanding.  I did add a little cumin but that was the only thing I did different.  This will become a regular dish!

This recipe rocks!!! All the people who gave it negative reviews must have done something wrong because this came out perfectly for me.  I followed the recipe almost exactly - the only differences were that I used a 3lb chuck roast, and only about 3/4 cup of diced green chiles. Oh and I also added cumin like others suggested I used Cholula hot sauce as well. After 5 hours on high in my slow cooker, the meat was falling apart, INCREDIBLY tender. I did like others suggested and took the roast out, pulled the meat apart and then put it back into the slow cooker for an hour on Low.  Afterwards the meat was incredibly juicy and flavorful. I made tacos with it with guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream and cheese. my boyfriend loved it! he ate 7 tacos. I used some of the leftover meat today in quesadillas and once again it was phenomenal.  It reminded me of the shredded meat they use at Chipotle.  
I will say that the juice/sauce that is left in the pot is VERY spicy. If you try to use that as a salsa, then yes it will be very hot.  I just used a slotted spoon to remove the meat and veggies and then got rid of the sauce.
Do not let the negative reviews sway you.  This recipe will be in my cookbook FOREVER.

I am sorry to say that this didn't work very well for me.  I used chicken breasts, and ended up with a sort of very spicy yet oddly bland soup.  There was so much liquid that even after transferring it to a pot and boiling, I ended up pouring most of it down the drain.  I shredded the chicken, and poured some of the liquid on top...it's sitting in the fridge now, and I must say I don't know quite what to do with it.  I feel like I could have gotten almost the same result by boiling some chicken and then pouring some hot sauce on it.  :/  I love spicy food, but this is lacking some depth of flavor, in my opinion.  I won't try this again.

Very good.  I omitted the chili powder and cayenne pepper to ensure that everyone in the family was able to eat it.  I will use fresh garlic next time I prepare (and plenty of it!), more onion, and try a chipotle hot sauce.  It was very tender, and we used in tacos, burritos, etc.  I'm looking forward to experiementing with the flavors.
UPDATE:  used fresh garlic and a bottle of chipotle hot sauce for another try.  YUM!

I love authentic mexican food and this one hits the spot. My husband is Mexican and said "Oh my God, this is so good!" then had another helping and finished my seconds. He also claimed "This is true mexican home cooking" and "My mom and Dad would eat this." So, it's a keeper.

My changes; I used 2 lbs stew meat, because I had it in the freezer. Browned it in the oil, then slow cooker for 6 hours on low. I was afraid the cayenne would be too hot for me, so I halved it. I did not have green chilies, so I used a can of ro-tel.

I kept everything else the same, although I was afraid of that much hot pepper sauce, it was perfect! It was great - just enough spice to make my mouth water but not so much that I couldn't eat it.

This is a keeper.

I was hesitant about this recipe because it sounded SO spicy. But, it was EXCELLENT! Instead of water I used one beer then enough water to cover the roast. I served with tortillas and salsa, chopped onion, guacamole and sour cream for condiments. Everyone at the party loved it!

This is the 2nd time I made this recipe. The 1st time I followed the original recipe and it was too spicy.  The 2nd time I used half the bottle of hot pepper sauce and used 1 can of diced tomatoes with green chilies instead of water for more flavor and then two of the small cans of diced green chilies and it came out great.  Friends raved about it.

Unbelievable!!!! I was initally afraid of the heat in this recipe, but am so glad I didn't change it. The sauce was hot, but the meat was a bit more mild. I used the meat in enchiladas and poured the sauce from it over the top of them. Huge raves from my friends. I did take some others advice and used beef stock instead of water. A GREAT recipe!

Fantastic!  Note that the "3/4 cut hot sauce" is VERY vague!!  This dish can be as mild or hot as you want.  Get the flavor without the heat by using a milder sauce and peppers rather than cutting down on the quantity.

I followed the directions Impish gave in the Oct. 1, 2006 review, adding the cumin and paprika after the roast was shredded and returned to the slow cooker. I omitted the bottle of hot sauce for fear I wouldn't be able to eat it. Glad I did. My husband added more at the table. We ate this in tortillas with lettuce, cheese, and tomatoes.

I made this for tacos last night and my boyfriend said they might just be the best tacos he's ever had! Here's what I did: omitted the hot sauce (not a fan), added 1 tsp. cumin, and used 1 (14 ounce) can of beef broth instead of water. I also combined the chiles, broth and seasonings in my food processor before adding to the crock pot just to make sure everything was well blended and that there weren't any big chunks of chiles (it's a texture thing). I cooked on high for about 5 1/2 hours then shredded the meat in my crock pot and continued to cook on high for another 30 minutes. I then moved the contents to a large pan and simmered on the stove (pouring about a cup of the liquid down the drain just to help the process) for about 20 minutes. And voila! It does make a lot of meat, so I froze half in a ziploc baggie for another day. Can't wait to try this recipe with chicken!

This is amazing! I used pork stew meat, as it was 1/2 the price of the chuck roast. As suggested by other reviewers, I added 1 tsp ground cumin and 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic, rather than the garlic powder. I used 2 large poblano peppers and 2 jalepenos. I also added 1/2 a small can of chipoltle peppers in adobo sauce, wich I minced into a paste, and 1/2 of a 15 oz can of diced tomatoes just because they were in the fridge and needed to be used. I didn't add any water as the juice that came off of the pork when I browned it seemed like enough liquid. After 3 hrs on high, I removed the meat and shredded it. It was so tender, all I had to really do was mash it with the back of a fork and it pretty much shredded. I returned the meat to the pot after skimming off the fat, and as suggested by another reviewer, added an additional 1/2 tsp of cumin and 1 tsp of parika. Simmered on low for aprox 1 1/2 hrs, then turned back up to high and simmered without the lid for aprox 45 minutes  to reduce some of the liquid. Served in warm corn tortillas with sour cream, shredded cheese, shredded lettuce, guacomole and pico de gallo. YUM!! Thanks charley!

He wasn't kidding whe he said it was HOT!!! I am not a really hot fan, so I took the meat, after cooking and sliced it. I then seared the slices just a little bit to make it more like steak. I shredded some of it as well. When just out of the slow cooker, it was very spicy. After it sat for a while, it cooled down a bit. The flavor was amazing. I also added about 3 cloves of chopped garlic in with the chiles and onions. I also added a couple teaspoons of cumin with the rest of the spices.

If you'd like to try this, don't get intimidated by some of the other reviews... The sauce is in fact VERY spicy (it made my husband gag when he tasted it), but the meat itself is tolerable (with *just* a hint of spice)! I strained the meat from the juices, shredded it and used it to make mulas (griddled sandwiches made with corn tortillas), adding cheese and chopped cilantro. On an additional note, although the sauce was very packed with flavor and spice, I agree that the inside of the meat was a little bland... If I used more of a mild sauce (I used tobasco), once I shredded the meat, I would have placed it back into the slow cooker for about 30 minutes to cook in and absorb the juices. But as I had made it, it was still somewhat tasty and we enjoyed our meal. I'll probably try this again with the modification.

This is really good.  I cooked the meat with beef broth instead of water and then I poured some of the juice in with the shredded meat - we ate it like tacos.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I used frozen chicken breasts with this. Forgot they would create a lot of liquid so had too much liquid and had to scoop some out - my fault. Used a full bottle of habenero sauce and it wasn't too hot - even my parents agreed it wasn't too hot. Excellent recipe and I will make it again.

This is so very good! I was scared off at first by the amount of hot sauce called for in the recipe. But, the long cooking time must neutralize the hotness of it. I do though, cut down on the amount of the hot sauce to about 1/2 cup. Because the brand I use tastes vinegary, I add a little extra water. I add some dried oregano leaves too. I use this for fajitas, and serve with sauteed onions and green peppers.

YUMMY!  I love this!  I have made it a few times already.  The leftovers are just as good if not better than the first time.  I have tried it with more spices added and it was even better!  I used Texas Pete Hot Sauce because we don't like the other brands as much.  I think that might make a difference because it is milder and has a totally different flavor than the luisianna style.  It is also good cooked with peppercinis or jalapenos, but be prepared for the heat.  If it is too spicy just eat it with sour cream.  Totally yummy!

My husband doesn't like "spicy" food so I was nervous to make this recipe. But when the author of the recipe stated that you can adjust the "heat" to your liking, I took the chance.  It was a big hit! I did everything as directed except for the hot stuff.  I cut it down by about 2/3rds of what it should be. It had plenty of flavor and wasn't hot at all.  I may try to "heat it up" a bit next time because I do enjoy my food a little spicy.  Thanks for this amazing recipe!!  I will definitely make it again :)

Tasty!  I used Franks Red Hot Sauce, next time I may try Chipolte Tabasco.  Now that my meat is gone and I have plenty of of extra "Jus" I'll freeze it for beef and noodles or a beefy vegetable soup.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I made a few changes based on reviews. I only used a few tablespoons of hotsauce and no cayenne because of my kids. I also added about a bottle of beer to the liquid to add more flavor. Put these in tortillas and it was enjoyed by everyone! Going to make beef enchiladas with the leftovers!

I followed the recipe. Maybe I used the wrong hot sauce, I don't know, but I will not make this again. I also think I should have followed reviewers' advice and put the shredded beef back in the cooker.

This was not at all spicy as it says - it does have a kick to it though.  We loved this meal!  I cooked mine on high for 6 hours in the slow cooker, shredded the meat and returned it to the slow cooker for another 2 hours on low.  We ate it with flour tortillas and I made a side of spanish rice. Very, very good meal.

This recipe is great!!! I didn't brown the meat- just threw everything into the good old crock pot, and let it rip!!! I think I added too much water, but it didn't hamper the flavor at all! Next time, I will try it with chicken!

Comment: Those who claim it was atomic hot are probably using tabasco sauce while others are using a much milder sauce such as Franks hot sauce.    

I am making it today and will be back with review.

Sorry, but this disspointed me. I used chuck roast as suggested but the meat was very tough and hard to shred. The flavor was just okay, and it was kind of dry. It needed more... something. My husband liked it but I won't make it again.

Very good - shredded it per other reviews.  Next time will use the full amount of chili peppers called for - I was a little timid this time.  I think I used a larger roast, too.  Made burritos and chimichangas, and plan to make quesadillas with it tomorrow.

This was really good.  I did make some changes though.  I didn't brown the roast, just threw it in the crop-pot frozen.  I cooked it on high for 4 hours and then shredded the meat and cooked it on low for a few hours.  As for spices I needed to add a bit more chili powder and salt.  (I didn't add as much hot sauce as in the recipe)  I will make this again!

I made this recipe with pork butt and cooked it for 10 hours on low.  I also didn't brown the meat before putting it in the slow cooker (didn't have time for that before work).  My husband raved about it!  Thanks for posting the recipe and giving the suggestion that you can make it with more than just beef.

This is SO good!  I skipped step one and just added all of the ingredients to the crockpot.  The only extra thing I included was one beef bouillon cube.  I shredded the roast about 2 hours before we were planning to eat and let it soak up the flavors.  I must say, with all the ingredients, I was expecting a firey hot dish, but it really wasn't.  Yes, it is spicy, but don't let the list of ingredients intimidate you, it's fantastic!

Very delish!  I would omit the extra cayenne as it was a little to spicy and I like spice.  Also, I ended up needing to cook it longer aobut 10 hours because i was at work.  I wouldn't recommend that due to it being pretty mushy as a leftover.  WOuld make this again in a heart beat.  Used it as soft taco meat...great over minute rice mixed with fresh cilnatro and half of a squeezed lime  :)

this was sooo good.  I made it into enchiladas buy adding a can of tomatoes and tom paste to the sauce after removing and shredding the beef.  This made the best enchilada sauce I ever had.  My husband even gave the finished dish five stars and he is tough to impress.  I have tons of leftover meat and cant wait to pull it out of the freezer for a quick meal when I am short on time.  Thanks!  Oh I cut the amount of hot sauce and used half a small can jdiced jalopenos because that was all I had in the house.

This recipe is fabulous--with just a few minor tweaks.  I used beef broth instead of water, used only 3 oz. of Tapatio hot sauce and added about 2 tablespoons of cumin.  I really think that the cumin rounded out the flavor--this may be what is missing when previous responders complained of "heat with no flavor".  Now I've got my mom's family hooked on it too--great with corn tortillas and cheese!  Will make on a regular basis now.

This is a family favorite! The only change I made was to thicken the juice, don't want to loose all that yummy spicey-ness!
Would give it 6 stars if I could.

This was really good! Great flavors. I didn't have a chuck roast so used sirloin steaks I had on hand and cut them into large pieces. I also used canned green chilies and added the liquid. This wasn't nearly as hot as I had expected with all the hot sauce and hot spices  - it was very spicy and very good!! Broth makes a great gravy. I think I'll try making it with chicken next.
P.S - While it's not hot, it is very spicy so probably not one to feed to young kids - I didn't even try - I made something else for my 5 yr. old.

TRY THIS WITH VENISON! Touch DOWN.I made this with a venison roast, the meat was so tender. I did not have green chiles, so I chopped up a fresh red pepper, and 6 fresh jalapenos. I shredded the meat when I was done and used an immersion blender to puree the cooked veggies and broth. I had a lot of sauce, and plan on freezing it in small batches to add some kick to tomato based soups and sauces.

I give this 5 stars minus the hot sauce.  I knew my kids pallets couldn't handle it, so I left it out.  This allowed the other flavors in the meat to stand out.  I cooked 5 lbs of meat for just 4 hours on high and it was easily done - over 200 degrees in the center.

Delicious!  Full of flavor and YES it is SPICY! With a cup and a half of chilies, I hope to kiss a Wild Goose it IS!! PEOPLE, that's the Point!  You wouldn't blindly jump off a cliff w/o Knowing what's down there, don't do it with food!  THINK BEFORE you make it and ask yourself, do you Want REALLY hot food! THEN jump or stay on solid, boring ground;)) You can always add more chilies or hot sauce later but once its too HOT, hard to unwind that clock. BTW, my family n I love jumping into a pot of this meat! Sour cream/ guacamole is a good way to bring that heat under control.

We love this!  It is on my regular rotation.  I follow the recipe exactly and it is quite spicy.  If you don't like the heat dial back on the red pepper and the hot sauce.  Be sure to finish in the fry pan as it makes all the difference!

This is a delicious recipe that yields tender, flavorful meat.  I didn't use the whole bottle of hot sauce since hubby doesn't like things too vinegary and probably used 10 dashes of Louisiana hot sauce.  I also added cumin because I love the flavor of cumin.  We used the meat to make quesadillas.

I hate when people do this, because its hard to "rate" a recipe that I didn't make exactly. But I used this as a base. Im a teacher, and if I have time to put food on, I don't have time to mess with it. That said, I've made this multiple times and its great (my way). 
I have never browned the meat--turns out fine. I use a 8-12 oz jar of medium salsa instead of hot sauce, and a can of diced green chiles instead of what it calls for. Sometimes I add the seasoning, sometimes not. If I don't have pre-chopped garlic that I add, I at least add salt, pepper and garlic powder. Tastes great either way. I actually add a bell pepper into the mix, and chop it with the onion and put half of each under the roast, and the remaining half on top. Dump the chiles over that on top, and then the salsa all on top of the meat. Add a little water or stock if you're like me and this is gonna have to cook for 10-12 hours. Shred and serve, it is amazing.

Here is the thing with this beef.  If you can take a teaspoon of your pepper sauce and eat it straight without freaking out, then add 1/2 up to the full amount called for.  If you can't do this, then add between 1/2 and 1/4 and make up the difference with beef stock.  I have to laugh when people claim to like spicy food then give bad ratings for being too hot.  You should know how hot the dish will be by the ingredients you put in.  Always taste first.

I would rate this recipe 10 stars if I could. I made it twice in three days. I used this inside tamales, they were great. The first time, I cut the roast into big chunks and cooked it that way. Turned out juicier. After the meat was shredded, I put it back in the slow cooker with all of the juices. You can extra paprika and cumin then. This is an easy and excellent recipe. Great with pico de gallo and tortillas.

This was really good!  I 'm from SanDiego too so I followed Impish's advice.  I used a 2 lb. london broil because the chuck at my grocery store looked extremely fatty.  I scaled down the onions but not the other ingredients.  I have a 2 year old so I used a small can of green chiles instead of jalapenos but I did use a whole 5 ounce bottle of cholula's chile garlic sauce. I made tacos on corn tortillas with jack cheese, lettuce, cilatro, salsa and sour cream.  Tasted so good that I felt like I was eating at a restaurant.  My kid loved it.  Can't wait till he gets older so I can try the jalapenos!

I found this to be a fantastic and delicious recipe.  This was the first time I tried it and I used pork.

First off, I did not brown my pork (way too much splattering oil and my day help hates when I do this).  Salt and pepper on the roast and into the crock pot it went.

I added 1 can chicken broth, chili powder, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder, and cumin.  I cooked the meat until it was tender and would pull apart easily.  (I tasted the meat and yes, the outside part was nicely spiced and the inside meat did not have as much flavor.)

This was when I knew that I needed to re-cook the meat.  The recipe does not state this, but as a cook you need to follow instinctual thought processes.  Following a recipe is easy.  Anyone can do that.  But what to do after that is something I have learned over many years.  I have learned to read between the lines.  My intuition has never failed me.

I refrigerated the roast overnight, and the next morning I shredded the meat and I placed it back into the crock pot along with the juice that it had been cooked in previously (there wasn't a lot).

This is when I added the hot sauce, finely diced onion, 2 cans jalapeno peppers, more chili powder, cumin, salt and pepper.  I cooked it again for about 4 hours.

I plan on using this meat for tamales this year, something I make for Thanksgiving and then again for Christmas.  I am going to try it with chicken and also beef.  This is going to be a very fun kitchen experience.

This was pretty good.  I didn't think it was overly hot.  It made a ton so I froze some into smaller batches and plan to use on nachos.

Great meat filling! I used it for tamales, which sadly was the only part of the tamale that was good and I have also made tacos with it a few times. I do add a can of mexican tomato sauce. Ty Charley!

Excellent and easy recipe.  The meat was very tender.  My only warning is it is VERY spicy, so if you have a tender tummy, or are cooking for kiddos, tone the spice amounts down to taste.  Otherwise-- killer stuff!

I have to be honest; I cannot make taco meat any other way after discovering this recipe. I use Old El Paso Mild Taco Sauce for the 'hot pepper sauce' and it turns out great. I have noticed a significant difference in whether I use beef or chicken, and usually if I am making this with chicken I add some bouillon to it because it can get a little bland. Also, if you are making this for the first time I would recommend cutting the spice in half to start and adding more to determine your ability to handle the heat!

This is an excellent recipe.  My 14 yr old son wanted Roast Beef Burritos (from this site) and it called for precooked roast beef, so I went searching for a good Mexican style roast beef and I found this recipe and I am really glad that I did. UPDATE: I have made this recipe a couple of times now and it is perfect as written.  We made these as burritos without adding a thing (except for toppings).

This was really good! I was a little nervous that it would be too hot, but it wasn't bad at all! I used all 5 ounces of the mexican hot sauce and real garlic. I also didn't bother browning the roast. Just threw it on low overnight in the crockpot and shredded it when I woke up. Then I turned off the crock pot and returned the shredded beef into the juices for a few hours. Everyone loved it! Thanks!

We're generally not big meat-eaters, but I'm a sucker for spicy shredded beef.  This was delicious.  I used chipotle-pepper hot sauce (about half as much as the recipe called for) and added a little cumin, did not brown the roast first.  After I shredded it, I cooked it for another hour.

I'm giving this a 5 star review primarily (no offense Charley!) due to Impishs' 2006 comments - she's absolutely correct in that you simply must return the shredded meat to the pot and let the meat soak in all those wonderful flavors.  Absolutely outstanding.  We used a brisket, crockpot method, and the flavor was simple superbemundo.  Thx so much.

I first tried this recipe last year.  I used suggested changes from others, substituting crushed fresh garlic for garlic powder and adding a can of Rotel tomatoes & chili peppers.  My husband cannot get enough of this and I make a batch every other month!  Since it is just for the two of us, I divide it into freezer containers for future meals throughout the month (it freezes and reheats wonderfully).  I have also prepared it using pork roast or boneless, skinless chicken breasts and it is great with those meats also.  This is a favorite and there is always a container or two in the freezer at our house now.

Excellent! This is as close to authentic shredded Mexican beef as you are going to get. I made a few alterations: after browing it on all sides, I deglazed the pan with a can of beef broth, added the onions and 3 smashed cloves of garlic along with all the spices, chiles and the Tapatio hot sauce. I let it simmer for a few minutes and then poured it over the meat in the crock pot. And instead of adding water, I used a can of beer. I cooked it on high for 5 hours, dropped to low for about 2.5 hours. When it was done I let it sit in the crock-pot for about a half an hour. It was so tender and easily fell apart. We made tacos and will use the leftovers for salad tonight. This is perfect for tamales, too. The broth and beer added a lot of flavor and we didnt think it was too spicy at all.  A total keeper!

I would have given this 5 stars, but I didn't follow the recipe word for word; instead, followed some of the reviewers' suggestions. Alterations made: Used a thick cut of higher quality meat, replaced water with beef broth, added 1 teaspoon of cumin, added a diced serrano & cooked for 8 hours on low. After 8 hours, I shredded the beef, added 1/2 teaspoons of cumin and cayenne & cooked on low for another 1.5 hours. The end result was flavorful, tender, spicy & AMAZING taco meat that worked wonderfully with asadero cheese, lime & fresh pico de gallo.

I used all the ingredients and added a chopped fresh jalapeno.  I then cooked it on high for 6 hours and then low for 6-8 hours.   I learned with the longer cooking the ground chile and cayenne don't have the same punch, hence the fresh jalapeno.  Turns out perfect (but we do like heat).  I followed another reviewer and before serving, I cooked in a skillet to let the excess juices cook off and the meat carmelize a little.  I froze extra in a ziplock bag and it is even better reheated.

Absolutely incredible! I did not trim the meat; I was able to discard the fat when I shredded it. I added cumin before cooking. I only cooked it for 4 1/2 hrs before shredding it, I returned it to the crockpot and added more cumin and some paprika, and cooked for another 1 1/2 hours.
We put it in the Old El Paso Stand & Stuff Taco shells, and topped with shredded cheese, Pico de Gallo, and sour cream. Absolutely delicious! 
I later coated some tortilla chips with refried beans, and shredded cheese, microwaved them and topped them with a little meat...again...yummy!!!

I don't know if I did something wrong, but I followed the instructions exactly and this was not to our tastes at all. I did use a smaller cut of meat than the recipe states and cooked it a little less to compensate, maybe that was it...  The meat never absorbed any flavor from the spices, and it was very tough.  I often make a similar recipe from another cookbook but wanted to try something new...I guess I'm back to my old standard recipe!

Very good - don't wimp out on the spice - it's fine - as suggested after shredding I added some of the juice and some Taco mix to a frying pan and simmered for 10 - 15 mins. Served as burritos with Guacamole (from this site)and sour cream  with refried beans with chilies.
Thanks - great recipe.

I don't think this is as good as everyone makes it out to be. I am not saying its horrible or anything like that but it definitly doens't deservere 5 stars. Its quite spicy so unless you like heat beware (i love heat). I probably won't make it again because there just wasn't anything special about it.

Ok, I took a major detour from this recipe, but I'm rating it anyway because it was my inspiration and is just such a great slow-cooker meal idea!!! 
Instead of basically all the ingredients, I just added a packet of taco seasoning mix and a sliced up large onion to the roast, and then added about 3 cups of water. Our roast was 2.6 lbs and I cooked it on high for 2.5 hrs, then on low for another 6-7. Soooo tender! After I took the meat out and shredded it, I added another half a packet of Taco Seasoning because it was a little bland. Then it was perfect, and even more delicious the next day as leftovers!
I look foward to making the 'real' version of this recipe; I just didn't have the time or the chile peppers, but I'll bet it's even way better than my shortcut!

Yummy yummy yummy!!  I didn't have any chile peppers, so proceeded without.  I had a 2.5 pound roast, so cut the rest of ingredients down by 1/3.  Oh MY, what wonderful stuff - perfect level of heat and seasonings.  I made soft tortillas, and served myself soft tacos with sour cream, lettuce, tomatoes, and cheese, and they were scrumptious!  This made a ton, even with reducing the recipe, so I froze a huge bowlful.  After cooking for 10 hours in the crockpot, there was only about 1/2 cup of juices left, which was perfect.  Too bad my husband missed this by being out of town!  I can hardly wait to treat him when he comes home!!

This was delicious.  I was worried that it seemed a little too simple to be that good, but the flavor was intense and the meat was tender.  I served it with taco shells and my husband raved about it.  I used a round roast instead of a chuck roast becaust it's a little less fatty.  I will definitely make this again.

I'm on a mission to find great tasting Mexican food recipes for a friend of mine who recently moved to Boston.  After coming from Southern Arizona where you eat Mexican food AT LEAST once a week, she's getting pretty desperate.  I was looking for a good red chili burro meat filling and used this recipe as a base.  I used canned green chilies, and upped the chili powder a whole lot (wouldn't be surprised if I used about 1/8 cup) and added some cumin.  Did not use the entire bottle of hot pepper sauce, but rather just enough to give it spice (try Tapatio hot sauce if you're not a fan of the Tobasco flavor like me...and it's super spicy!!).  I also added a can of hot mexican style tomato sauce, 1/2 can beef broth, and about 8 oz chili paste. It may sound like a lot of "stuff" but WOW was it ever tasty!!  Even my picky boyfriend enjoyed it!!  I will definitley make this over and over and over again, and I can't wait to pass along the recipe to the ex-roomie!!

cream, and just a bit of the sauce from the slow
cooker, it was heavenly, we really enjoyed it.

My mistake must have been either using the wrong hot sauce or shredding up the meat and putting it back into the sauce.  We love spicy food, but this was just way too hot and despite our efforts to tone it down, we just couldn't.  My husband still tells the story about the "Atomic Beef"!

Your stew is very similar to Carne Guisada...I
did try it but without half of the chiles, peppers
and other very hot spices. However, I did add a
little bit of oregano and ground cumin. Even though I was born in Mexico I feel that you do not
have to sacrifice your taste buds to obtain great
flavor. Thanks so much Charley for sharing this
great recipe with us. Ay Caramba, como pica!!!!

I made this when we had some friends for dinner and we made burritos out of it.  Everyone loved it & I had requests for the recipe.  I did make some small adjustments: a little less hot sauce and a little more garlic, but nothing drastic.  I didn't want it to be too hot for the kids to enjoy--which they did.

This recipe is great!  I admit that I was a little nervous adding an entire 6 oz. bottle of hot pepper sauce, but the meat doesn't come out too spicy at all!  In fact, next time I will thicken the sauce left in the crock pot to pour over the meat.  I served this the first night in burritos, then the next day I reheated the leftover meat and served it over rice.  If anything, the flavor was even better the second day!  This is definitely a "keeper."

I really, really wanted tacos for Cinco De Mayo but I didn't have all the ingredients for this recipe :( I decided to improvise and I'm sure glad I did because it was AMAZING. I used a 2.5lb London Broil (didn't sear on the stove just trimmed some fat & threw it in the bottom of the slow cooker) and covered it with a packet of taco seasoning, a generous dash of cumin, 2-3 cloves minced garlic and enough water to submerge about 1/3 of the roast. I then cooked it on low for 12 hours, took it out to shred the meat & skim some fat off the water, then put the shrewd meat back in the water on low for another 2hours. The meat we got was so moist and flavorful that's family is now obsessed & wants me to cook it every time we have "taco night"! If you have the chance to cook for a long time, please do, it's soooo worth it!

I thought the flavor was a little flat. I didn't have bouillon cubes to add depth, and I had to do a lot of flavor doctoring after 2 hrs on Low post-shredding (cumin, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper, chili powder, smoky seasoning blend, taco seasoning -- I couldn't find the right flavor until finally I did, so it's not really the same recipe anymore). I'd make this again, because ultimately it was yummy, but I'd amp up the seasonings before browning as well as use beef broth instead of water, plus use greater quantities of seasonings at the start in the cooker.

This is so flippin' good!  I used a 2 lb roast and adjusted according to our taste and preference.  Next time, I will double the recipe.  It was so good.  We made tacos and I think I could've eaten about 10 of them.  I took other's advice.  I didn't cook the meat ahead of time (time saver) then about an hour before serving, I shredded it and placed it back in the juice.  I added cumin and reduced the hot sauce as I was scared of the heat factor.  Next time, I'll add more hot sauce.  Love, love, love it.  I can't wait to make again. yummo!!

I cut way back on the peppers and hot sauce(used Frank's red hot) and cut a little back on the spice. I added cumin and forgot the onion. Turned out perfectly.

Oh good gravy this stuff is FABULOUS! I made it for the first time for Christmas Eve dinner.  I was worried being that I've never made it before.  Talk about a huge hit! Even the neighbors loved it! I read the reviews and here is what I did...and it was NOT too hot!!!!!  If you use tobasco or real jalapenos, then yes...it will be hot.  However, I used Louisiana hot sauce and two cans of diced green chili's.  I cooked it for 8 hours...took it out...shredded it...added the cumin and paprika like the "Most Helpful Positive Review" said to do.  Personally...I want more heat but had to start off mild for the family.  This thing cooked all night and woke us up with the WONDERFUL smell!  Had it for breakfast for Christmas morning with scrambled eggs and such.  Life is good...

Easy to make and flavorful. I added cumin, a beef bouillon cube, and diced green chilies to the mix. Found the spiciness to be tasty. I used Cholula hot sauce and liked it, but I kind of selected it on a whim and may experiment with some other brands in the future.

I have to agree with the other reviewers that say it's missing something.  I only had a 2.5 pound roast, but I left the ingredient amounts the same, with the exception of the hot sauce.  I only used about 2 ounces of that, but then added a diced jalapeno and cayenne pepper from my garden.  I threw in some minced garlic on top of the garlic powder and added cumin. In the end, there's just a complexity of flavor that's missing.  But, if you use the onions from the crock pot in with the meat while making burritos, it's pretty good.  I just wish I could put my finger on what that other flavor component needs to be

I tried this recipe last week-end when family came from out of town.  They all LOVED it.  It was flavorful and delicious.  I did make the add a pkg. of mushroom gravy mix to the liquid and then put all the meat back into the slow cooker.  It was all eaten up and the wanted more.

Total waste of almost $16 worth of meat.  Extremely tasteless.  Now I need to figure out how to use all of the shredded beef I have left over.

Fantastic.  I did cut the hot sauce down to 3oz but I didn't find it to hot. I probably could have got away with a little more. I did throw in 1 1/2 chipotle pepper, just because I love it.  I used the leftover broth to make rice and black beans.  Now there I felt a little heat. Next time I may score the meat a bot to get the spices more evenly through the meat.   I also had a lot of broth and room in my crock pot, so I also threw in 3 boneless breast that made some excellent enchiladas :). I took the chicken out a lot sooner. Thanks for a great recipe.   Sept.2016. Definately add tsp or 2 of cumin after shredding.

I just didn't like this recipe. I tried to incorporate some of the changes, but even then it was not to my liking. I don't like it when viewers change the recipe so much and then give it a 5 star rating. This recipe in my opinion is a two star recipe.

I made this according to the recipe..except I wanted it a lil' milder so omitted the hot pepper sauce, used the juice from the diced chilis, more water, and cumin..it was just spicy enough for us. I made tacos out of it tonite...maybe we will have burritos with the leftovers. Thanx for sharing this recipe..it has great flavor and is so tender and juicy.

I made this for a pot luck at my work.   I followed the other review that was listed as helpful and added additional paprika and cumin.  It has outstanding complex flavor. My tastes for spice are varied and I didn't think it was too spicy, the feedback I got was "too hot".  

I decided since I wasn't too familiar with working with chilies that I would follow instructions and use jalapenos.  What I discovered was a cup and a fourth of jalapenos is a lot.  =) I think next time I will probably substitute poblanos or even green bell peppers in lieu of the jalapenos.  While the other two don't pack nearly the punch of heat, both are  nightshades so you'd get a similar flavor profile without the 4 alarm fire.  Whoever it is calling this "atomic beef" clearly doesn't eat chilies very often and has no business working with them at this level. This stuff isn't nearly as hot as the thai spicy foods I get here in town, but it ain't for sissies either.

I will also try a more mild hot sauce than Tapatio, maybe Tabasco or find another mild but still tomato based hot sauce.  Rotel or even just some diced stewed tomatoes might be good.  I wouldn't worry about it becoming too acidic, as sometimes Tabasco can do.  The richness of the chuck roast will cut the acidity easily.

I would recommend serving this with some sides of sour cream and guacamole, plus maybe some cheese, tomato (or pico), lettuce, cilantro, perhaps some rice.

I've made this with beef and pork; both are great. I cook it in shifts; after the first 6 hours I remove & shred the meat. I strain the broth and place it in a separate container. I refrigerate both overnight, allowing the fat to separate. A small portion of meat is set-aside for grandchildren that can't handle the spiciness. The remaining meat & broth is returned to the slow cooker for a few hours or cooked in the oven until hot and the desired consistency. Great for burritos, salads, super nachos . . . wonderful flavor.

When I first tested this right out of the crock pot it just tasted like a roast.  Good, but not really something I would want to eat on a taco or nachos.  However, I made it for tacos, so I was going to try it in a taco.  Oh My Gosh!!!  I will never use hamburger meat for tacos again.  This was so incredibly yummy.  I can't wait to make it again correctly.  I was missing a lot of ingredients, but it was still so yummy.

My whole family loved this beef! I followed suggestions from Impish, except for the hot sauce. I cut back the amount of hot sauce for my young grandchildren who only like a little "hot". I did dry out the beef in a 350 degree oven for tacos, since it still had a lot of liquid with it after the second cooking. The children liked it straight from the crockpot however. A total hit for my famly!

I made this with a pork tenderloin, and it was fabulous.  It was so easy to prepare and had so much flavor.  Will be making again with a beef roast.

I halved this recipe to use up a couple of beef shanks I bought on sale without knowing how I was going to cook them.  This worked out quite well.  I didn't use the whole bottle of hot sauce, although I would have liked to.  DH has developed a slight allergy to hot foods, so I had to cut back.  I did add some cumin and a can of Rotel.  The meat came out extremely tender and after shredding it, I put it back in the sauce.  Served it with soft corn tortillas and it was wonderful.  Thanks, Charley.

My husband and I love this stuff!  We use Franks hot sauce and it comes out great each time.  I'm lazy and don't brown the meat, so I don't use the oil.  I just throw the rest of the ingredients into the crockpot and let it go.  My mom loves to take the leftover juice and turn it into a soup base.

This was great for shredded beef soft tacos. I played it safe and used 2 cans diced chiles (1 cup) and 4 oz. LA hot sauce.  I will use the full amount next time.

This recipe was very good.  I used an eye of round roast that I cut into 2 inch cubes.  I blended the onion, garlic and peppers with the spices and hot sauce.  An hour before serving, I shredded the beef and added it back to the crock pot to absorb more of the sauce flavours.  I served this with diced tomato, jalapeno, onion, and lettuce on whole wheat wraps, burrito style, which we grilled on the panini press.  I found that the meat could have been spicier, so next time I will add more hot sauce.

Mmmmm ... good recipe!  I must say, though, I didn't stick exactly to it, because an entire 5 oz. bottle of hot sauce sounded INSANE.  I sprinkled the meat with just a little bit of the hot sauce, and with all the other ingredients, the meat still turned out spicy (however, not too spicy, especially in tacos with cheese and sour cream and so on).  With that change, the meat turned out perfect.  I cooked it for 8 hours on low, pulled it out and browned it on the stovetop for tacos.  Can I say DELICIOUS??!  Thanks so much!!!

I have used this with chicken twice, love it. I use just one Tablespoon of the hot sauce and it is still kid friendly. I look forward to trying it with beef and pork.

My family loves  this.  I have made it with beef and chicken, and it goes fast.  I use a little less hot sauce because I have little girls, but they ask for the "spicy meat".

This was delicious! I was afraid after reading some reviews that it would be too hot/spicy which i am not a fan of but it was great and i did make some adjustments. I did not add cayenne because i didn't have it on hand and i forgot to put in garlic. I added a can of beef broth for fear of it drying out and to prevent it from being too hot. This is a keeper, next time i will add the cayenne and garlic.

This was great and so easy! I put a frozen chuck roast in the crockpot in the morning on low and turned it on high for the last hour of cooking. I didn't have chile peppers so I used jalepena peppers. I also added corn and black beans. Next time I'll make yellow rice with it. I added cumin and not as much hot sauce.

Better than expected! I accidentally added a whole 7 oz. bottle of mild taco sauce. When I checked on it a few hours into it, the broth was sooo spicy. I lost all hope and just let it be for 3 more hours. I shredded the meat and cooked in a skillet with a bit of broth on low heat 30-40 min and the darn thing was off the hook! Both my boys and hubby were all over it. It turned out it was not spicy at all. Made tacos with ciltantro, onions, taco sauce, and cheese.

We're really, really enjoying this recipe! I make the following changes to suit our tastes: omit the teaspoon of salt and sub 1 tsp salt-free adobo seasoning; use a 3 lb rump roast instead of 4 lb chuck roast (less fat, and easily trimmed). I layer it veg on bottom, meat on top, no additional water (the veggies produce more than enough of that combined with 5 oz hot sauce). I serve it with all the trimmings for tacos, and it's great! Thanks!

The BEST SHREDDED MEAT RECIPE EVER!!!! I followed the instructions pretty much to the letter. I did sub jalapenos for the green chilis, this may be a little too spicy for some. And a bottle of Tapatio, and I added cumin.   Just mouthwatering perfection is all you'll get. Great for tacos, burritos, enchiladas. It was sooo good! Hooray for this recipe!!

This dish is out of this world!  My BF and I couldn't get enough!  The spice was just right, I didn't have to add any taco sauce or hot sauce.  I was able to just put the meat in the taco shell, added shredded cheese and ate 4!!!!  :)  Definitely will be adding this to our menu rotation.  Thank you so much for sharing!

I love this recipe. Once You try it you will never go back to ground meat taco meat.  The flavor is great & it's so easy.  Just dump everything into a crock pot & walk away.  I made it with fresh chilis the first time & canned the next.  I recommend the canned chilis. Even though the water doesn't look like enough, don't add more. It will be plenty. This is great for nachos! Also the left overs can be freezed & saved for another day.

Was disappointed.  Hoped for a shortcut.  Hot sauce covered up the taste of everything.  And I LOVE spicy, spicy food.  Wouldn't make again.  I am mexican and we would never make carne like this.  Just chuck, salt, pepper, onions, and a bay leaf.  The spice comes from fresh made pico de gallo or salsa.

So the choice of marinade items for this slow cooker meat was amazing.  I followed almost exactly as explained, with a couple tweaks in quantity of spices.  The actual reason I was making this was to provide me with shredded beef for tamales, but the meat comes out perfect nonetheless.

this was exceptionally good. i used a 2.5 lb roast. added fresh chopped jalapeno, cumin, minced garlic, fresh lime juice and fresh cilantro. this smelled as good as it tastes. i couldn't stop myself from taste testing! i also shredded my meat after the first 3 hours on high and then put back for 3 hours on low. it soaked up all the juices nicely and the meat was super tender. oh and i also added diced potatoes. this was a wonderful and authentic mexican recipe!!

Wonderful! I used poblano peppers and jalapenos for the chilis and it wasn't too spicy. I also forgot to brown the meat and it turned out just fine. This is great with beans, in soups, with eggs, on salads, etc....Very versatile and delicious. My husband says that it tastes even better than what we get at our favorite restaurant. Thanks!

As the recipe is written, I thought it was overly hot.  I didn't add all the chiles and cayenne, and still found it really quite spicy, and that is coming from a person who likes heat.  I also thought it needed some cumin and oregano to round out the flavors. That helped to balance the heat out and it turned out very well. So with a few tweaks, I thought this was very good, and it made excellent tacos.

Excellent, but due to previous posts I made a few changes.  I did not add as much liquid as suggested, used canned green chilis (Mild) and added a tsp. of cumin.  Also shredded it after 5 hours & returned to pot.
One last thing-instead of water I used a can of beef broth.  Really delicious.

This recipe is GREAT!.. I've made it several times and everyone in the family LOVES it! I've even made it with a pork roast and it was just as good! I even take the left overs and have wrapped them in tortillas and fried them to make chimichangas... they freeze well and you can pop them in an oven to warm them up later for a quick fix dinner. 
  I think this is my favorite recipe I have found on this site!
   ~THANK YOU~!

good recipe for an inexpensive cut of meat. There was way too much liquid so next time I'll only use a little bit. Made shredded beef burritos with rice and black beans. Will definitely make this again.

Excellent - I make this almost every month.  My husband is from Mexico and he adores this recipe.  Definitely follow the other recommendations and use Tapatio, beef bouillon and 1/2 fresh serrano chiles for authentic taste and heat.

I like spicy food but this recipe is way too spicy as written!  I reduced the green chile pepper to 1/4 cup, only 1/2 tsp of chili powder, only 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper and used only 2 TBSP of hot pepper sauce.  Even after the adjustments the meat didn't sit well with me and others at the dinner table.

I was a little worried this would be too spicy because of the reviews I read so I decreased the amount of spices... What a mistake!  The meat was not as flavorful as we like it - next time I will stick to the recipe (maybe even increase the spices.)  I will re-rate this after we tried it again.

This is a really great recipe for those with a busy schedule. I'd be a bit careful with the chilis and cayenne for those who can not handle the heat. I used chilis from Albuquerque and the end result was HOT! We loved it, but it was too much for  our guest. The meat reminds of the Barbocoa beefs at Chiptole.

This was a quick and easy to prepare meal. I didn't even bother measuring the seasonings, I just coated both sides of the meat with them. I also added a little ancho chili powder and a whole can of beef broth. I cooked it the day before I needed it so it could sit in the fridge overnight. There was a hardened layer of fat on top and I was also able to pull the meat apart and take out the chunks of fat that didn't melt down. It wasn't greasy at all after that. Thanks for the great recipe, I will definitely use this one again!

I've made this recipe TWICE.  The 1st time I followed it pretty much by the recipe & served it over rice.  I thought it was "OK", but got a thumbs-up from hubby, so kept it on file.  Today I made it AGAIN, but tweaked it a lil.  I coated my round steak with Southwest Seasoning (Emeril's) and did NOT brown.  Put it in slow cooker (on high w/a lil bit of olive oil in the bottom) onions on top and then poured about 1/2 jar of Salsa I really needed to use (didn't really like the Salsa much by itself) on top along with some homemade Chic Broth (I actually rinsed out the salsa jar with it, so about 1/2 cup).  Added garlic and let it go!  It was a thin piece of meat so it didn't take very long (about 5-6 hrs) and it was absolutely DELISH! I broke the meat up as I went along ~ by the end I had a FABULOUS Mexican style roast, almost SOUP....I couldn't stop eating it right out of the cooker! The longer it cooked, the better it became!  I made myself a lil "burrito" (CORN tortillas go so well with BEEF) and the rest what I didn't eat (ha ha) I made a casserole.  Layered corn torts (meat mixture first), then torts, cheese...repeat 3 times.  Topped it with more SW Season at 350 til bubbly.  YUMMY!! ~ This is a very versatile recipe and has just great flavor!  Thanks so much for the IDEA.  I was looking (both times) for something to use the Round Steak I found on SALE & this is the best recipe I've found so far! Thanks again! ~ It's a KEEPER :))  Enjoy!

This was a very good very spicy the meat, it fell apart while it was cooking.  The only thing I changed was I shreded the meat for the last hour of cooking and let in soak in the juice.  We used it for soft tacos it was yummy!  Try it with frozen margarits!

It is obvious from the past reviews that this recipe is very flexible, and awesome the way it is! My roast was only 3 pounds, but I used all other ingredients in the full amounts. I used mostly fresh jalepenos with a little bell pepper thrown in. I love super spicy food, but DH only likes "normal spicy". This was perfect for both of us - I just added fresh jalepenos to my "Mexican Green Salad" for extra heat.
Served the meat in enchiladas with cheddar and ripe olives, using the Anna Marie's Enchilada Sauce from this site. Because the sauce is brown, it wasn't the most appealing dish in looks, but WOW, what flavor! Made Mexican Rice II from this site as the 2nd side. What a great meal!

If I could give this more than 5 stars I would! This is the best recipe ever for meat! I have used both beef and chicken and have had awesome results with both. I sometimes vary the recipe and it still turns out awesome. I have used a can of Rotelle in it several times instead of the green chilis and the results are just as good! I love that I get alot of juices off of this. I drain them off and use them for a soup the next day. I add a can of black beans and some chopped cooked chicken and a bit more water and tada! Awesome soup! The recipe itself makes really great sandwiches and unbelievable good enchiladas! My family absolutely loves this and so do I!

I will never make tacos with ground beef again!!! This is wonderful!! I carmelized some onions and layered them with the meat and some cheese on a hard taco shell. AMAZING!! Don't let the hot sauce scare you, it's a must!!

I have made this several times and I do like it very much. This last time I did change somethings though. I did not brown it, and I did not use any water. I used a big can of green enchilada sauce and a can of the rotel diced tomatoes. It turned out very good. The sauce blended right in wit the meat, and it was not runny at all. YUMMY!

This is the 2nd time making this & it is just really, really good. I like how versatile it is, from beef, pork or chicken to tacos, burritos and fajitas.

We love the flavour;-)

Made this yesterday and it was so delicious! We used it for burritos and it was better than our fav mexican place. Family already asked when I'm making it again. You definitely need to adjust the amount of hot sauce. I put a quarter bottle and it was spicy enough. Thanks for such a great recipe.

WHOA!  Cool the spices a bit, dude!  I'd say maybe 1/4 bottle tobasco, not the whole thing, if you want this to be palatable without a pitcher of water on the side!  Flavor's good, but the spiciness is out-of-control!

Love this!!  I tone down the spices a bit (I don't add the fresh chile peppers anymore and I only put in about an ounce of hot pepper sauce), but it still comes out VERY spicy!  We love it and our guests always love it.  Once I did the recipe from memory and I forgot to sear the meat - that was a bad mistake that you shouldn't make.  This is a great & super easy recipe that I will always use!!

From reading the other reviews and the recipe itself, I imagined a nice beefy dish with complementary kick.  I followed the recipe exactly but did not get the results I expected.  The spices/sauce in this recipe masked the flavor of the beef.  I will not make this again.  

If you are interested in trying this recipe, check out the other review’s suggestions.  Perhaps their ideas will render a better dish.

i made this for Dinner last night- my husband raved- i just put the roast directly into the crock, skipped the searing step with the olive oil.  i used mazzetas habenero sauce, this gave it an excellent spicey taste, we shredded it and made tacos and burritos. excellent recipe will definately make this again-and again-and again

Awesome.  I cut back on the Hot sauce, but the gravy turned out just super.  Made sandwiches the next day with some horseradish and Dijon and was that something else or what!!  Definitely a keeper.

This recipe is great! I thought about not using all the hot stuff because we have 6 children who would want to eat dinner(darn).Then I remembered how they never appreciate good food and I used all the hot sauce. My husband and I couldn't stop eating it. We had it with homemade(Not my home)tortillas, avacados and cilantro. It was the best!The kids said it was too hot for them-oh well, looks like they'll be eating cereal next time I make it.

Let me add my applause to the rest. I substituted chicken for beef, and chicken broth for the water. I also used 1/2 of the hot sauce called for. Even with all of that, this was great. The chicken breast fell apart when I served them up. The spice was just right, and the taste was great. My wife informed me that I could not tuch the left overs, as she was going to take them to work so that her friends could drool over her great lunch!! Once again, best recipe I have pulled off of this site to date.

Absolutely fabulous! This is, perhaps, the spiciest shredded beef ever. I used one cup fresh-roasted New Mexico green chilis and only one-half cup hot sauce. Even so, the beef was hot, hot, hot! While tender tastebuds may shy away from this dish, it's perfect for anyone who likes a lot of heat.

I have been trying Mexican style recipes for the past year.  This is the very best I've found!
The buritos that I made were awsome!  I used Scotch Bonnet and Seranno peppers for the heat.
I got 6 meals for one (that's bachelor to some of you...) 
Freezes real well.

VERY GOOD!  I rated this high on quickness because of the prep time.  Very easy and delicious.  The amount of spice was good for me and my husband, but next time I will cut back a bit so that my toddler can eat it also.

This is very good with just enough spice.  A must try for someone who is sick of just having ground beef in their Mexican dishes.

I just made this recipe with a boneless pork rib loin and I really liked it.  The inside wasn't very spicy so I ended up putting it back in the sauce to sit for about half an hour after I shredded it.  It had a great flavor!

This was quick and easy.  I used less hot sauce because I was afraid it would be to hot using the amount suggested in the recipe. It turned out just right.  The whole family loved it.  My teenage sons say "It's a keeper!!".

This recipe is off the chart good! I did make a few changes. I browned my chuck roast in a cast iron skillet. After removing the roast I tossed in  1 Tbsp butter and sautéed a very thinly sliced onion for approximately 3 minutes until translucent and fairly caramelized before removing from the pan. I then deglazed the pan with 1 1/2 cups water allowing it to simmer 3 to 5 to slightly reduce before adding it to the slow cooker. I did include 1 1/2 tsp cumin, substituted the green chili with a entire 28 ounce can of mild green enchilada sauce, tossed in 2 tsp. beef bouillon, and decreased the red hot sauce to 3 ounces. I'm tough, but I'm not that tough. I can't get enough of this stuff. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

I was really skeptical making this because of the mixed reviews I read. Made this the before I went to bed and woke up and it was all done! Did everything on the recipe except I cut back on the peppers and used Tabasco chipotle hot sauce. It was soo good! And I also used the beef to make pizza too! This is definitely a keeper for sure!

I've made this several times and tonight was the best (and my hubby thinks the same!) I threw everything into the crockpot instead of browning the beef first, so I did not use the oil.  Then I added the beef w all the spices, except the cayenne pepper (we have little kids) and instead of the hot sauce used about 1/3 cup Pace medium salsa and water to cover 1/4 of the roast.  Cooked in the crockpot for 8 hrs on low, then shredded it and trimmed the fat and bones off. Placed the shredded beef in a pan with the strained juices and about 1 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp paprika, a dash of red pepper flakes and cayenne pepper. Let it simmer until the meat soaked up the juices and voila! Delicious! I can't  wait to eat it tomorrow!??

big hit with the family! I only had a 2 lb roast, so I halved the seasoning. I also had to use a can of chili's, but it still turned out great. I used the meat for tacos, so I followed the footnote and cooked off the liquid in a skillet. will definitely make this again! thanks for the recipe!

I used a 2 pound Chuck Roast ($10). I kept ingredients to the same measure as for a 4 pound Roast. Cooked the 2 pounds for 4 hrs on high, shredded and then 1 hr on low. Put some sour cream and shredded cheddar on a flour tortilla and I was in heaven.  I would not change a thing. I won't lie, it's a tad spicy alone, but put it on a tortilla with cheddar and sour cream and it's the perfect amount of heat.

We love this recipe and make it often! I always tone it down because we don't like it really spicy. It has great flavor. I have even used this concept, toned down, for ground beef tacos and they are great too!

Great tasting beef. Used 5 oz bottle of Tabasco Garlic Hot Sauce and skipped the ground cayenne. For us it was just the right amount of heat.

I've wanted to try this recipe for a long time and kept passing it over in my recipe box. I finally decided to try it and got the ingredients, and before I made it I read some of the reviews.   Some of the "atomic bomb" comments were a little scary!  But I made it anyway as written, except I added a little cumin per the reviews,  and WOW, this turned out great for us!  I suspect there is some confusion about the interpretation of the ingredients... I used a can of chopped green chili peppers and not jalapenos or any other hot pepper  This was not too hot for us and the combo of hot sauce and green chilis was spot on.  I wished I had bought a larger roast... this was gone in no time!  And no atomic bombs!

Great for tacos, burritos, flautas, or taquitos. Firstly, way too much hot sauce. Recommend 1-2 Tbsp only.  (If you want hotter, add to individual serving).  All other spices should remain as stated. But I added 1/2 Tsp cumin and I Tsp beef boullion granules. After shredding, return to liquid.  Awesome results.

Recipe is a good foundation for shredded pork. Adding the whole bottle of hot sauce made the meat to tangy for me. I would add half instead of all of it and you really do have to adjust the chile added to recipe. I added cumin because I like that flavor. Meat did come out tender. I also would only use 2 pounds instead of 4 pounds for a family of three. Not sure how spicy you want this add a little bit at a time. Half then adjust half way through cooking time.

After cutting the cayenne and bottled hot sauce in half, it was still on fire.  I used 3 jalapenos, de-seeded and Tapatio hot sauce.  Thank goodness I made this a day ahead.  Trying to salvage this meat, I removed it from the original crock pot liquid and made up a fresh batch of water and beef broth.  Poured over it and let set overnight.  Took away most of the heat so that we were able to use it in the tacos I'd intended it for.  It's a shame because I think it had potential but will need to find other spices.

Awesome Recipe! I followed the recipe with the exception of switching out canned chillies for fresh jalopenos (minced).  I also traded out the 5 .oz hot sauce for 2 .oz Tabasco Sauce due to salt restrictions. Considering Tabasco is much hotter than your average hot sauces this recipe turned out wonderfully.  I served it with rice, black beans and cheese.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and found the spices to be way over the top. We couldn't taste the meat...only the spices. My wife wouldn't eat it. I'll try again adjusting all of the spices downward.

I wanted a good "go to" recipe for Mexican style shredded beef to try to break up the monotony of ground beef tacos. This was just want I was looking for. I love slow cooker meals because I plug them in when I leave for work and it's ready when I get home. I used about 2 cups of the left over gravy from the crock pot to make Mexican Rice. We made burritos with the rice and beef, very good!

I made this recipe 3x now. We are chili heads so I made sure that everything was hot in the spice area like hot green chili.  Since it is just the two of us, I freeze a good portion of this and it freezes beautifully.  I make homemade tortillas from this site and we eat a lot of this with avocado cheese and chopped up jalapeños.I did find that putting the meat back into the crockpot after shredding and cook it for another hour as some suggested adds to the flavor.   If you like hotter food,Try it you'll like it.

I made this one snowy day. It was wonderful. I followed advice from a couple of different people. I cut the roast into smaller hunks of meat. Lightly browned those. Then crock pot all day. Shredded meat and "browned" again on stove in skillet, didn't need extra liquid as it was already juicy enough. This made enough for 2 plus meals for our family of four. I froze leftovers and was able to use the meat to make enchiladas last night. VERY good and will definitely make again.

Fantastic!!!  So easy and the flavor is outstanding. Always looking for slow cooker recipes that don't cook the flavor out of the dish and this one does not!  Will be a keeper for sure!

It was awesome!  My husband is the meat cooker in the family, but he raved about this recipe.  I will use this again and again.

This is the best shredded beef I think I've ever had! I did what others had suggested - I used beef stock, used jalapeño peppers and reduced it to 1/2 cup, removed and shredded the meat after 5 hours, then returned to pot with 2 cups of liquid mixture. I had to remove fat from liquid since I used a fattier cut of meat, but it worked fine. I added the cumin & paprika when i shredded meat. I used a hot sauce I had in the cupboard in place of the hot pepper sauce. Then I put it in a fry pan and cooked on medium heat till liquid was gone. The flavor is incredible. I heated corn tortillas, filled with meat and put salsa and sour cream on it - I was tempted to eat 10 of them!

Love this easy recipe!  I have made this several times now, each a little different.  I use beef broth for the liquid as others suggested and have used both fresh jalepenos and canned diced green chilies depending on what I have on hand- both work great.  The spice factor is just right for the grown-ups in the house, but may want to dial it down for the kiddos.  Once the meat is done, I do remove some of the liquid and boil it down on the stove then add it back in.  I also add about 1/2 cup of favorite BBQ sauce for a little sweetness at the end.  Makes great burritos and tacos, and we love the leftovers! Yummy!

This was so simple yet amazing!  My husband and I are addicted to this.  I made some changes after reading some of the reviews.  I didn't have chili powder on hand, so I just omitted it completely.  I added 1 tsp each of cumin and smoked paprika in addition to what the recipe calls for.  I only minced up two serrano peppers and 1 jalapeno, which I'm pretty sure did not come out to 1 1/2 cups that the recipe calls for.  I used about 2oz of Tapatio instead of 5oz because I was afraid my meat would have a vinegary taste.  I did not brown the meat prior to putting it in the crock pot.  I rubbed the spice mixture all over the meat, topped with the minced peppers and Tapatio and used a beef bouillon cube like other users have suggested.  I cooked the roast on high for 4 hours, shredded it with two forks then continued cooking for an additional 2 hours on low.  The insides of the meat absorbed the broth and spices and the end result was some very flavorful (and spicy!) shredded beef.  It reminded me of Chipotle's barbacoa, only 100 times better.  And I don't even like their barbacoa!  I'll be making this again and again, that's for sure!

I used a trimmed beef brisket. Skipped the browning step. Just put the meat directly into the crockpot and followed the rest of the directions. Added some cumin and a beef boullion cube, and used half the hot pepper sauce the recipe called for. Cooked on high for 6 hours, removed, shredded with two forks, and placed back in for another 2 hours. Delicious!

Thought it might be too spicy (I used Tabasco for the hot pepper sauce), but when we used it to make tacos it was delicious with Queso Fresco and Crema Mexicana.

It's a keeper!

Perfect to use to make Tamales.  Tamales are an all day process but worth the effort.  I make the "dough" very thin on the corn shucks and add a generous amt of meat. Very good for that purpose.

Just add a marinade or brine period with the same stuff in the recipe and most of the negatives are addressed.

I tried this recipe for a second time recently, and I'm very pleased with how it came out. It is necessary to adjust the heat to your taste, like the author says. I used one small can of mild diced green chilies and most of a small can of chipotle chilies in adobo sauce to give the dish a smoky flavor, plus a beef bullion cube and a dash of cumin as a few other reviewers suggested. I used a few splashes of chipotle hot sauce and left out the chili powder and cayenne completely. I would say mine was "medium" spicy...it had a kick but was not too hot. I cooked the meat for about 5 hours, and it was very easy to pull apart and very tender. The only thing I don't like about the dish is the excess liquid, but that's kind of a requirement to get a tender meat....I just need a better slotted spoon! It makes an amazing taco meat with corn tortillas, lots of cilantro, lime, and lettuce. I expect it to become part of my regular rotation!

Nothing more than a really spicy pot roast. It had plenty of heat but no flavor. I made this for a party and was able to salvage it after draining and re-cooking the meat with different spices. This is not a Mexican style meat.

This was delicious and so easy.  I served it as one of three fillings available on a Taco Bar for a Graduation party.  I had some left of the other fillings at the end of the evening but this one was completely gone!  I agree that choice of hot sauce is key - I used Cholula Original, which added flavor but not an overwhelming heat.  Additionally I used 2 small cans of chopped green chilies in place of the diced green chili pepper. Yum!!

I used this recipe to make beef enchiladas along with Bill Echols Enchilada Sauce 1, Kraft Mexican cheese blend and flour tortillas...it was delicious! My daughter's eyes got big and she said they tasted like the local Mexican restaurant. Initially I thought this meat was too spicy, but after it rested and cooled, it was a winner!  Especially after combining it with the enchilada sauce, cheese, sour cream, etc., etc., this makes seriously good shredded meat that can be used in multiple ways. I did not brown the meat like other reviewers suggested. Skipping that extra step was a happy thing. I agree with another reviewer that the hot sauce you use is key. I used Franks because I had an extra large Sam's Club bottle of it. Next time I will use Cholula Hot Sauce, Original. I got turned on to that brand a few months ago at a local seafood restaurant. I doubled the recipe and was able to freeze two 1.5 lb packages for future use. Thank you for this recipe Charley!

This is the recipe I use faithfully for my tamale filling and it makes a great enchilada filling too. It's easy. Let it cook overnight and the next morning you have meat ready to place in your masa. We use boneless chicken breast. We like to have extra sauce to pour over the tamales when we eat them so for 4 lbs of meat we double the rest of the ingredients before slow cooking. This gives us enough filling for at least 24 large tamales and left over sauce for pouring or dipping later. We make at least 4 dozen when we make them because our family and friends can't seem to get enough. Even my husband's Mexican family loves them. I do advise trying different kinds of hot pepper sauces the first few times you make it because it really affects the flavor and you may find one you enjoy more. I give this 5 stars because the flavor is deliciously spicy but doesn't create that uncomfortable lingering burn some fear.

Made this for Super Bowl Sunday as part of a taco bar, everyone loved it.  Great flavor, only change I accidentally made was not putting water in the crockpot, but ultimately I think that ended up being a good mistake.  Shredded very easily and was fantastic.

I need to preface this review by saying I grew up on "Ameri-Mex":  ground beef w/the yellow packet seasoning was tacos in our world.  I've never seen a reason to stray from this familiar favorite.  I was perusing recipes to find something to do w/a chuck roast, when this highly rated "not a roast" caught my eye.  I decided to give it a whirl and I'm slow glad I did!  This is excellent!  We ate it on soft shell tacos w/sour cream, cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes.  While Mr. LTH found it a bit spicy, he still enjoyed it and I didn't find it very spicy at all (nice hint of a heat after taste, no runny nose or burn).  I'm super lazy and when I find a crock pot meal, I don't want to do any additional work, so i elected NOT to brown the meat.  I simply tossed everything in the crock pot (minus black pepper because I hate it) and cooked on low for 12 hours.   The meat was fall apart tender.  I did up the chili powder to 1 T and I just now realized I'd forgotten the garlic powder.   I also added a 1/4 tsp cumin and a dash of paprika.  This will def replace ground beef tacos in the LTH household; thanks CHARLEY!

Made 4 dozen tamales last night using this recipe; used total 5 lbs chuck. Followed reviewer's suggestion (Impish from San Diego; October 1, 2006) to add more spices and bottle of hot sauce. Meat was fork tender and, surprisingly, not too spicy-hot--in fact it wasn't hot at all, just a hint of Latin. I will use this recipe again.

Very good!  I left out the cayenne pepper and just poured some hot pepper sauce on top since I have two little ones who don't like spicy foods.  I didn't brown it in a pan beforehand, just cooked it on low for 8 hours.  So tender and flavorful.  We made soft tacos with the meat....homemade guacamole, lettuce, cheese, and sour cream.

I have to agree with those who said this dish is about heat rather than flavor.  Following the cooking instructions resulted in a well cooked roast...it pulled apart really well, etc.  but there was really no depth of flavor.  I had to put the meat into a skillet with some of the liquid and add a bunch of taco seasoning.

I just made this a couple days ago and it was great! Had to adjust the spice because we don't like it too spicy, but still like some kick. Be careful not to add too much water, I think I did it came out a little soupy. So I took a reviewers suggestion and saute'ed it in a pan before making my enchilada's worked out perfectly. Thank you!!

I made this with a boston butt and it shredded it for burritos with guacamole from another recipe and they were awesome!  Btw, I'm not too sure why some people ended up with "atomic" beef...if you follow the recipe as listed, cook times included, there is no reason why the spiciness shouldn't cook off and blend well with the meat...

This is awesome! We call it Vodoo meat, and it serves up well with fajitas, tacos or our favorite: Nachos.  Cooked as directed, wouldn't change a thing!

Yummy!! I used chicken for this, after it was cooked I shredded it, and we ate it in tacos.  It was very tender and tasted great. I will have to try it with beef next time.

I made this just as directed and then reduced down by heating in the a skillet on the stove to intensify the flavors and evaporate some of the extra liquid.  I also added some smokey paprika.

So very good.  Added some cumin, but otherwise stuck to the recipe (even using the full 5 ounces of hot sauce).  Wonderful flavor and not too spicy at all -- just right for us.

Extremely good!  I put in a can of beef broth and some green pepper per others suggestions. I put it in the crockpot on low for about 7 hours while I was gone.  Then I shredded the meat and put it on high for about 1/2 hour.  We made tacos and burritos with it and we all loved it.

Mixed reviews from the family. My 7yr old took about four bites and told me to make sure I give this all the stars...lol - I didn't even realize he knew I rated the recipes! But my hubby was not a fan - just not his 'thing' he said.  Me and my 9yr old liked it too.  The flavor of the meat is perfect, not too hot for the kids either.  We had a lot of liquid, but we chose to use a slotted spoon for the meat and it worked great.

This was excellent! Reminds me of Chipotle's Barbacoa beef.  I didn't have time to brown the meat first but I don't think it made a difference.  Threw in some sliced onions and bell peppers which I had, along with one large can of mild green chillis.  Was worried about the spice, so only used 2 ounces of Tapitio, which was just enough heat for my tastes (pretty weak).  I only used a 2 pound chuck, so I halved all the spices and added a half teaspoon of cumin as well.  Cooked on high for four hours, shredded and then back on low for 2.5 more.  Delicious.  Only thing I would have done different is trim the fat prior to cooking.

Oh so good!!  My meat was so tender and flavorful - it shreadded by just picking it up.  To those who complain about the spicyness, I suggest you skip the hot sauce or try a different recipe!

Made this tonight for a friend and it was great!  I added cumin as other reviewers did and by mistake left out the chili powder because even though I thought I had some, I didn't... I did have cocoa with chili powder so I added about a teaspoon of that and it turned out lovely.  Thanks for this!

I changed this recipe a bit, I didn't use a whole bottle of hot sauce, instead I supplemented the meat with more cayenne, chili powder, and jalapenos. I also added a can of spicy tomatoes to the mix. It turned out really good, I used the meat to make tacos and they were very tasty.

So good! I also used the review by Impish to assist in this recipe.  I used a 3 pound chuck roast, followed the recipe almost exactly.  Only changes I made was to add 1TBS chili powder and 1 1/2 tsp cumin and only 1/2 tsp cayenne since my daughter was eating this too.  I used Tapatia hot sauce, yum.  Cooked for 8 hours on low, then removed and shredded beef, then returned to crockpot for another 1 1/2 hours.  Served on flour tortillas with shredded cheese, cilantro, and avocado.  Oh, I also added about a cup of water with some beef bouillon.  A cup was too much.  Next time will only do 1/4-1/2 cup.

This was a really good alternative to ground beef for tacos. I used Franks Red Hot and chipotle seasoning instead of cayenne because its what I had on hand, and cooked it for less time (?4 hrs) just until done and shredded it with a fork and spooned the broth over that and refrigerated it for the next day. We used the 10 min salsa recipe from this site and added guacamole, sour cream and cheddar to soft tortillas for a fast, yummy weeknight meal!

Pretty good taco filling.  I was skeptical that it would be too spicy as I used almost a whole bottle of Frank's hot sauce.  But it was really not too spicy at all.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Wow absolutely incredible!  Yes it is spicy but Mexican food is suppose to be spicy but its not too hot.  To be honest, this is better than what we get at Taco Shops here is So. Cal.  I read a lot of the reviews & here is my version:  Had a Beef Loin TriTip so I used that.  2. Seasoned the flour w/Paula Deens house seasoning and browned the beef.  3.  6 Green chiles, 4 garlic, (1cup of H2O w/4T Bisto), Tapatio (for hot sauce), and added 1tsp onion powder, 1tsp cumin and 1 cup fire roasted tomatoes (at Trader Joes or Henry's) plus the spices Charley recommended.  4.  Blended all of that in the food processor and poured over the meat.  5.  Cooked on H6 hours and on L2 hours.  6.  Shredded the meat and cooked on Low for 1 more hour.  Heavenly!  I won't change a thing next time I make it!  PS:  Put Cotija cheese (Food 4 Less) on top of your taco!  YUMMY

This was perfect!! I added 4 cloves of minced garlic, threw in a beef bouillon cube, added 1 cup of diced tomatoes and it was perfect. My husband was so impressed :) Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! Will make it again and again. Nothing better than minimal work and the whole house smelling wonderful all day!

Really, really excellent! I didn't have quite enough diced chiles so I added a can of green enchilada sauce. Also added a healthy amount of cumin and some oregano. Absolutely fantastic flavor. I will make this again and again. Thanks :)

very good and great heat.  I used a 3lb roast.  Also added 1 can of beef broth instead of water.  Only 3 oz of hotsauce (I used Trappey's)  Added the cumin like Impish recommended.  Cooked in the crockpot on high for 8 hrs.  Definitley will be making this again!

My family loves this.  With two-year-olds, we can't use the hot sauce, so I substitute a can of roasted tomatoes.  I don't bother to brown it, just cook on low in the slow cooker for 8 hours.  To even out the flavor, I cut the roast into 4 pieces.  We eat this all week without getting sick of it

Very good.  I did not think it was overly spicy.  I made this twice two different ways and I highly recommend added about five or six minced garlic cloves to the batch.  Excellent.

Thought this was great!  My pork was tender enough to shred after the first 6 hours on high, probably due to cooking it in a broth.  In addition to the ingredients listed here, I added 6 finely chopped garlic cloves, dried oregano, ground cumin, and 2 cups of chicken broth.

This was the best!!! I wish I could give it 10 stars. I don't 10 star nothing! But this... oh, it was so good, my friend is calling me wondering how to make it. I think from now on, I'll make 2 of them side by side in crocks and freeze the meat for later use. I read the reviews here and made changes accordingly:  CHANGES: 1. Replaced green chili peppers with a small amt. of fresh jalepeno peppers  2. Cook on low for 8 hours overnight, remove to shred, return for 1.5 hours on low adding 1 tsp. Paprika and 1/2 tsp. Cumin  3. I used mild hot sauce, not super hot because I think it takes away from the other flavors, but still used 5 oz.  4. 1 tsp. Beef flavored bullion... use it from Byler's down the road.  5. Increased chili powder to 2 tsp.  6. Next time, I think I'll use fresh garlic and garlic powder.

This was very good BUT I did make a number of changes based on the feedback.  I did not brown the roast.  Instead I put it in the crockpot.  I added 5 med. green chili peppers diced and only about 2-3 oz of hot pepper sauce (figured I could add more if needed).  I also added 1 1/2 t cumin with the other spices and instead of onion and salt, I added 1 package of Lipton beefy onion soup mix.  After it cooked all day, I put it in the fridge over night and removed the extra fat in the morning.  When it was time to fix this for dinner, I shreaded the meat and cooked it and the juice in a sauce pan until all the liquid was gone.  Then I served it in soft tacos and froze the left over meat for another day.

i made this last night for dinner and served it with spanish rice and was told we can no longer have regular tacos..we have to have these from now on.!!! my husband kept saying over and over how great they were.  thanks for sharing i took in all the great compliments.  it is sooo easy as well.  the only thing i did differantly was added 7 oz green chilies, 1 t. cumin, 6-7 squirts of chipotle tabasco, and about 3 cups of beef broth to the crock pot.  it turned out great not to hot but just the right amount of spice.  served it kinda as a taco bar with alvacado, chopped cilatro, onions, cheese, tomatoes, sour cream & hard shells  ohhhhhh my goodness yummmmmmmy. thanks for the keeper.

Oh my, served on slightly browned flour tortilla's with sour cream. It was incredible. After reading through the reviews and finding Impish's review Oct 1, 2006 very helpful I made some additions as suggested. I added 1 beef boulion cube, added 1 1/2 t cumin and 1 tsp of paprika. Simmered in the crock pot overnight, shredded the meat, refrigerated in the broth and microwaved after work for supper. It was fantastic. Will definitely make again and again.

I've been making this for a few years now, and it's a staple in our meal rotation.  It's fantastic, versatile, and SO easy to make.  I've made it with beef as written, but to save calories I usually use a mix of light and dark chicken.    I use the Tabasco Chipotle flavored sauce - it's milder than the original and has a great smoky flavor to it. Even when I'm making it 'mild' for company, I still use at least half the bottle.  I wonder if the reviewers who find this way too hot for their tastes are not completely shredding the meat as is intended?  I can't count how many of my friends have asked for this recipe - it's a definite winner!

I make this quite often.  After it cooks in the crock pot, I shred it and pan sear it in a bit of heated olive oil for about five minutes.  It evens out the flavor throughout the meat and seals in the juice so it isnt watery.  The kids and husband love it!

I took it to work for Cinco de Mayo and it was a hit!  I followed the lady's advice from San Diego about the extra spices and sifting out some onion and pepper.  I live in AZ about an hour from Mexico and it was AUTHENTIC!  Thanks!

Making this meat in my Crock Pot is what finally turned me 100% vegetarian.  It was a terrible experience from one end to the other.  First of all, if you live in an apartment or small house, I DO NOT recommend cooking it overnight.  I woke up at 3:30am and couldn't go back to sleep because of the smell.  It is the same smell that I can not get out of my apartment even a couple months later.  After all the work and putting up with the smell the meat didn't even taste all that great, although it was nice and tender and spicy.  I ended up giving it to my boyfriend to eat because I couldn't.  That may have been related to my total aversion to the smell.  I haven't cooked meat since.  It's the best diet I've ever been on!

5 stars with a few changes.  I used 1/2 of a 5 ounce bottle of Tapatio sauce 1 can diced green chiles, 1 1/2 tsp of cumin, beef broth instead of water, and 1/2 tsp paprika.  It was absolutely delicious as burrito filling, with rice and beans, and as a topping for nachos!

EXCELLENT! I shredded it and mixed it with rice, corn and black beans, then rolled into a tortilla with shredded cheddar. Yummy! Leftovers of the rice mixture were great just heated in a bowl. Will make again and again!

This was really good! Hubby LOVED it. I was in a hurry and didn't trim the meat or brown it before I tossed everything into the crock pot- I wish I had trimmed it!! But the flavor was good- it had a kick to it. I would like to try some different hot sauces to get different flavors. It made a lot of meat so I was able to freeze a bunch of it for later meals.

This meat was awesome on some tortillas w/ chopped cilantro and onion. The only thing I will change next time is not adding so much water.  I really don't think it needed it.  But I did like the other reviewers suggested, cooked the meat on high first, then shredded it and cooked it on low for about another hour.  Will make this over and over again !

I cut about 1 lb off a roast to give this a demo, reducing everything else as well, except the onion. It's pot roast with a spicy twist. Used a little Hooters and Taco Bell hot sauce.  Wish I had made  double the whole recipe to freeze some!!! It was pretty good once shredded.  It became FANTASTIC when I took the lid off the crockpot and turned it back on high to reduce the broth into a thick sauce, which stuck to the meat.  Served it in combination burritos using homemade chipolte refried beans,  served chips and guac on the side.  I will also be using this, with the addition of diced jalapenos, to make tamales and use  the same recipe with pork for tamales as well.

Yum yum yum... this absolutely melts in your mouth and tastes so authentic.  We had it in tacos along with Chicken Enchiladas II from this site for a mexican-themed dinner party.  I used a 2lb beef roast instead of 4 and forgot to halve all the other ingredients... it was still perfect.  Not too spicy, and I do NOT like spicy food.  I do think you don't need all that water in the crock pot though, I shredded the beef and put it back in the crock pot to simmer in the spicy juices but it was way too watery so I ended up taking out the meat and throwing it in a pan on the stove on high for about 10 minutes to burn off a lot of the liquid.  This meat is delicious as leftovers, too!  Thanks for this delicious recipe!!!

VERY TASTY!! I gave this a five star rating when substituting a pork roast for the chuck roast (otherwise a four star recipe (personal preferance of pork)). I have used this recipe a handful of times for family gatherings and potlucks and let me tell you, this was devoured by all.

Excellent!! Very spicy, love it! I used this meat to make toquitos. Put Corn tortillas's around the meat, secured them with a tooth pick, fried them in a pan, to get the tortilla crunchy. Added guac on top!

This was good, but I think it would have been perfect with the addition of some cilantro, some fresh lime juice and a dab of sour cream. We shredded the meat and ate it in tortillas. I didn't add the additional cayenne (thought the chili powder and hot sauce would be enough) and I used anaheim peppers.

This is awesome meat! I've made it several times already, both times for enchiladas. I used beef broth instead of water. I shredded up the meat several hours before I took it out of the crock pot, so it could absorb all the flavor, then took it out and mixed it with a couple tablespoons of sour cream and a little cheese to make a mixture, then filled tortillas and made incredible enchiladas. Thank you!

Sorry to say this wasn't as good as I thought it would be.  I think if I make it again I will shred the beef a few hours before its done.  Atomic hot on the outside and not that great on the inside.  It was an alright recipe for the most part.

Awesome! Will make this all the time! You can do soooo much with it. Others rated it too spicy but I totally disagree. I would only rate it modestly spicy with tons of flavor. I may kick it up a bit and add more cayenne or a different hot sauce. I used Texas Pete like other members, but will probably use something a little hotter next time. Thanks soooo much for the recipe!

This is awesome!  My husband and my kids loved this recipe, even our picky neighbor girl who ate with us had seconds.  I used 3 to 4 oz. of Texas Pete brand hot sauce and it was spicy, but wonderful in tortillas with seasoned black beans, sour cream, cheese, lettuce and D's famous salsa from this site.  Thanks for sharing!

After reading other reviews, I decided to minimize the heat initially and add some for the final few hours if needed.  I used one small can green chilis and two large fresh jalepenos, fresh garlic, and 2 ounces of hot sauce.  When I shredded the beef and returned it to the slow cooker, I decided to leave well enough alone.  It was perfect for our family, and we like spicy!  I served it in taco shells with shredded cheese and guacamole.  Quinoa and Black Beans (from this site) made an awesome side dish.

I made this for a birthday party and it was a total success.  We made the recipe with both beef and chicken, although some felt that the beef had much more flavor than the chicken.  We had lots of little ones eating with us, so I only used half of the hot sauce called for.  We only had one complaint - Although the the taste is totally worth it (and we'll definitely make it again), we really hated how this dish smelled while cooking.

Bit spicy, but quite good. I followed some of the suggestions on the site and pulled the meat out and put it in a skillet and simmered off the juices. When doing this I added some crushed tomato to the mix and that gave it a nice rounded out flavor...

This is great!!  We had to adjust the pepper and tabasco for my husband because it was a bit too spicy.  This was a hit for both tacos and taco salad.  We love to serve it with black beans!

This is yummy.  Makes fantastic tex-mex style meat for burritos, tacos, or any sort of wrap.  It tastes like the shreaded meat served in the better mexican restaurants.  I didn't change a thing.  Used Texas Pete hot sauce.

Loved this. I added cumin and used minced garlic. This was VERY hot. I used about 3 oz Tapatio sauce. Part way through cooking I tasted and the heat almost killed me. I took half the liquid out and added water to lessen the heat and it was still pretty hot when it was finished. I shredded, added season salt and about half a cup of juice over top. To the remaining sauce in crock, I took another posters suggestion and added tomato paste, tomatoes anda can of tomato sauce to make enchilada sauce for a future meal. I will add a little splenda to sweeten and freeze, so I have it ready for a busy day. This meat was so good, I was full from "testing" before it ever made it to a tortilla!

I was looking for a recipe that Hispanic friends of ours made for us when my husband and I lived in Germany and this was the closest thing that we have had to it!  It was just wonderful!  It smelled so good cooking and had just the right amount of heat!  My family actually wouldn't have minded it a little hotter and I may add more heat the next time I make it.  I served this with tortillas and fajita makings and the family raved!  Certainly a keeper and great for busy people!

This is awesome.  Had friends over and there wasn't a drop left.  The only change I made was I took the meat out and shredded it and then let it cook another hour in the juices. Excellent recipe!

I followed others' advice and cut down on the hot peppper sauce and only used a 2 lbs. roast.  However, if you like spicy food (somewhat), I suggest using atleast 3 oz. of hot pepper sauce and maybe evening adding more chili powder and cayenne pepper.  I also added garlic.  Otherwise, the roast was tender and delicious in tacos.

I just made this yesterday; I used the meat to make enchiladas (using Sara's recipe for Red Enchilada Sauce, also in Beef site).  This turned out absolutely delicious!  After shredding the beef (I halved the recipe), I added a can of red beans, shredded chedder cheese, sauteed onion with sweet yellow pepper, and mixed in enough of the enchilada sauce to make everything moist.  I couldn't stop eating this while I was putting the enchiladas together!  Thanks, Charley, for a great recipe I'll be using again and again.

This one is hot, and great with rice.  I added lots of different veggies, and it still tastes good if you use a little less hot sauce than the recipe calls for.

This made a fantastic burrito filling, though I have to admit I did tone down the spices for my children.    I only put in about 1/4 tsp of cayenne and not nearly the entire 5 oz. of hot pepper sauce.  The type you use may make a difference.  I use Tapatio because that's on the tables at our favorite taquerias but I only used maybe an ounce of it.  The recipe just says to use "chilies" but didn't specify the variety so I used three medium pasillas, using the full 1 1/4 cups called for.  We all thought the spiciness was just right for us with the adjustments above, but of course, YMMV.  Sabroso!

One of my favorite recipes on this site.  Made it for a friend with D's famous salsa and guacamole recipe on this site and serve with shredded cheese and tortillas.  She couldn't stop eating it!  Great as is also.

I wish I would have read the reviews before making this so I could have modifed it.  It's not the best nor the worst recipe.  I tried it with chicken and I agree with the others that it was just spicy chicken and it lacked any other type of flavor.  I doubt I'll make this again.

Delicious and sooo easy.  Cut back the hot pepper sauce to 1/4 cup.  Very tender, flavorful and not too spicy so the kids loved it.  I kept nibbling out of the crockpot when I would check it.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was really good.  I didn't have enough green chili's so I used some chipotle which added some spiciness that we loved.  I did it in the oven rather than the crockpot and it was fork tender.Will make this again.

Yummy.  The secret is to not use too hot of a hot sauce.  Louisiana style hot sauce is great.  I was lucky enough to just have been south and while there picked up some "Crystal" hot sauce which worked perfect.

This roast was great when used in burritos and tacos.  I can highly recommend it.  Give it a try, you won't be sorry.

This is wonderful! We have used it shredded in burritos, enchiladas, nachos, omelets (with cheese) and several casseroles that call for mexican seasoned ground beef. It really makes a roast go a long way if you like mexican food. My daughter even asked me for the recipe and she hates to cook.

A great base recipe for Mexican style meat. I only made a few modifications for preference. I used a 2 pound top round steak (so I halved the recipe) and didn't bother searing it. I seasoned the steak with a generous amount of (Kosher) salt and pepper and let it sit for 10 minutes. I coated the crock pot with olive oil and put the chopped onions on bottom and put the steak on top. I then used a medium mixing bowl and stirred together the green chili peppers, chili powder, Cayenne, garlic powder, and hot sauce (I used Cholula). I also added 1/4 teaspoon of cumin and poured the mixture directly over the meat, coating it completely. I used a single can of beef broth instead of water and cooked on low for 6 hours. It came out perfect and tasted authentic!

I have made this a couple of times and everyone just raves...and it is so easy!  I used the meat for soft tacos but with cold slaw and a little blue cheese dressing. For the recipe, chili peppers were not available, so I used poblanos.  Also I did not have regular hot sauce, so I used sriracha (4 oz) and omitted the cayenne.

Just made this!  OMG Yummy I was trying to replicate the shredded beef tacos at one of my favorite places to eat.  Things I learned - about five hours in to cooking I tasted the juice (because of all the reviews claiming that there wasn't a lot of taste) and it tasted a bit...…...bland?  Then I remembered the greatest tip someone gave me when I cook my chili - you have to do several pours of spices - ESPECIALLY cumin and chili powder.  So right six hours when I turned my crock pot down to low,  I put another table spoon of chili powder and a bit more cumin.  I also cooked this in beef broth (and added a bit more of that too at six hours).  During that time when my crock pot was on low I stirred and the beef just kind of fell apart.  What I got was the tenderest, tastiest meet that's better then what I was trying to replicate.  VERY rich, though.  Works WELL in a tortilla.  I also used Cholula hot sauce (because, for me, cayenne or Tabasco is Cajun, doesn't taste Mexican).  Holy Moly this stuff is GOOOOOODDDDDD.

I made this as written, using a beef roast. However,  when I tasted it, it was VERY spicy.  I held my breath and served it to a group of 20-somethings and it was a hit. When I make it again (and I will), I'll cut back the hot sauce a bit.  It's about personal taste. Great recipe!

Very good, very easy.  As others have mentioned, I will add a little cumin next time.  In addition, I will decrease the hot pepper sauce to just a couple tablespoons.  I don't really care for the flavor that much and it kind of overwhelms the (otherwise) delicious sauce.  You can definitely customize this to make it suit your tastes.  If you don't like spicy food, cut back on the hot pepper sauce and omit the cayenne pepper.  If you like a stronger chili taste, increase to one tablespoon.  If you like cumin in your Mexican food, add a teaspoon or two of cumin.  Add fresh garlic instead of powdered...  It's a very forgiving recipe and there's definitely room to customize.  Thank you for sharing it!

I will make this again. There were changes that I did make. I only use 3 pounds chuck roast. I changed hot pepper sauce to Tapitio hot sauce and I only used 4 ounces. Other than that there were no changes. The garnishments are used were lettuce, tomatoes, cilantro and lemon. And I put it on a corn tortilla. It was awesome!

followed the recipe pretty close...adjusting the cayenne to 1/2 a teaspoon and used tabasco chipoltle sauce (about 1/2 a jar and some pico pica)...then added beef broth instead of water.  super flavorful, but possibly too spicy for little ones, so i added another can of beef broth to dilute it some.  I added some smoked green chilies i purchased at the pumpkin patch this fall, and i look forward to trying the whole thing when its done.  right now the marinade alone is tasty :)
oh, i also put straight in the crock pot and didnt brown.  making tamales  at a tamalada party tomorrow and looking forward to the fun!
Edit:   The extra cup of beef broth did the trick, and it had just the right amount of zing!  Super yummy, I couldnt stop eating it!  :)  I am happy to report that some of it made it into the tamales though!  This makes kick  taco meat too!

I only made some minor changes to the recipe. Used sirloin steak and didn't brown it, used beef broth instead of water and less than a cup of jalapeño peppers since mine were exceptionally hot this year and used less ht sauce than called for.  Cooked it on high for several hours until the meat 
was fall apart tender, shredded it with forks and cooked it on low until liquid was absorbed. Wow was it good...but spicy. Served it over spaghetti squash with diced fresh tomatoes and green peppers on top. This cut down on the heat and was very good. Will be making it again to keep in the freezer. This is the first time I have reviewed a recipe, but this one is so good, easy and versatile that I want to recommend it.

This recipe was amazing. The Green Chiles really give it the Mexican flavor you seek. As other reviewers indicated, I added other spices such as paprika and Cumin for mine. I made tacos and the family devoured the meal. A+++++

I have made this several times now. Most of the time I use antelope. I follow the directions, except for browning the meat. I just toss it in the crock pot. :)  I also use the chipotle tabasco, we like the flavor. I add the rest of the ingredients as directed, except we didn't think it was spicy enough. I also toss in a good handful of frozen jalepeno left from the garden! So far, the mix hasn't lasted long enough to use it for anything but enchiladas. We snarf them down! Im going to try to set some aside and hide it, for tacos! Im making it again tonight, using venison. Ill have to try the beef and chicken sometime.

When I made this recipe I left out the chili's and I added a cup of white wine and a splash of red wine to add some taste. It had a touch of Mexican flavor, but not hot (my wife does not like real spicy food). I added a little lime juice to the tacos and they were great. I also added a tablespoon of corn starch to the left over juice to thicken it up after shredding the meat. I used pork. It made for good left overrs

This was not only the best thing I've ever made in a slow cooker, it is the best meat I've ever made too.  I used an organic chuck roast (expensive, but worth it) that was a little over 4 lbs.  I followed others' suggestions and did not bother with browning the meat.  I just put it in the slow cooker and seasoned it there.  I used 1 Anaheim chile, 1 Serrano, and 3 or 4 jalepenos.  It was a bit on the spicy side, but I served it with rice and avocado, which cooled it down a bit.  Next time I may use fewer chiles.  I ended up cooking it for 9 1/2 hours on high because I was out in the evening and couldn't turn it down.  When I got home, it shredded like a dream--virtually falling apart.  I shredded the meat right in the slow cooker and then let it simmer for about an hour in the liquid with the lid off so it reduced a bit.  This let all the meat absorb the flavors from the liquid.  It was absolutely amazing!  Thank you Charley!

I am originally from San Diego, and truly miss the beach side taco shops! I agree with adding cumin.  Try a bay leaf and a sprig of oregano!  Also, all peppers work, I like pablano. Same texture as a green pepper, less spice than a jalepeno but a nice flavor!  YUM!!

Didn't follow the recipe exactly -- used eye of round roast -- but had great success. I wasn't sure about using an entire 5oz bottle of hot sauce, but it meant that every bite was infused with flavor. My family loves spicy foods, and this was a big hit with them.

I used half venison, and half beef..it was fantastic, and had an authentic Mexican taste. I bypassed the frying pan which I always do when using a slow cooker but still used the oil. I feel the meat is more tender and all of the juices from the meat make everything taste and cook better.  Other than that i followed the recipe. It will be hard to make regular taco seasoning again for Mexican night at our house!

Great easy recipe!  I used Dave's Insanity Sauce for the hot sauce it turned out a little too hot for me! Next time I will just use tabasco.  I used Venison and Moose and it turned out good.

Omg, this turned out soooo good. I used the suggestions of Impish 
(thank you!) minus the jalapeno cause it might have been too spicy for my children and only half a bottle of Chalula's hot sauce.

The meat came out completely flavourless despite adding a ton of spice and hot sauce! And I did shred in between and leave in the cooker for an additional 2 hrs. I do think the big mistake I made was that I forgot to trim the excess fat off my roast, so it was kind of swimming in a lot of oil by the time it was done, maybe that's what stopped the flavours from absorbing? The meat was also really tough (I used a pot roast since it was on sale) I really wanted to like this recipe, because it actually smelled amazing.  Maybe I'll try it again sometime.

FABULOUS,FABULOUS!!  I'm Mexican and this recipe is incredible.  The only thing I added was Cumin.  We tend to use that spice a lot.  EVERYONE who tries this loves it and ALWAYS want me to make it.  The longer it cooks the better.  I make breakfast burritos  the next day using this meat with scrambled eggs, potato's, and cheese.  The juice along with the burrito is amazing!!  Thank you CHARLEY357

This is definitely a recipe that I will be permanently adding to my cook book! I followed the recipe as is except did not add onion (sadly my boyfriend hates onion) and added Serrano chiles on top of all the spice! We are Hispanic and this recipe needed more spice for us! Great recipe! I put it on corn tortillas with a side of rice! Yum!

I love spicy food, but I knew the ingredients would be overkill for my family.  I left out the peppers and cayenne pepper.  I added a little more water, and, after cooking everything as directed with the ingredients I left out, I took the meat out, shredded it, and gradually added some of the liquid until it was the way I wanted it.  The way I made it was enough heat for us.  I didn't think it was over the top, but I think my issue may be with the meat cut.  My husband and I both had this desire to put BBQ sauce on it and have no idea why.  Maybe I'll try it since we were both considering it.

I have tried this recipe 3 times.  I absolutely love it!!  I love spicy/hot food.  This recipe is perfect and easy for me to prepare.  I put together meat & cheese burritos and then I freeze them.  Small frozen burritos take 2 1/2 min in microwave and large frozen burritos take 3 minutes.  I too, am very addicted to the meat.  Oh by the way, meat is really moist.  Not dry like a lot of restaurants.

My EASY Hot Spicy Salsa:  First: Put all ingredients in a blender.  Second: Add 1 (13/14 oz) can of diced tomatoes, 4 medium/large Jalapeños, 2 cloves of garlic, slightly squeeze 1 lemon, add chicken broth to thin out (not too much), and finally add sea salt.  I like a lot of salt, so I probably add  at least 2 teaspoons.  

Enjoy

Way too spicy hot.  Is there a mistake in the recipe? It calls for a 5 oz bottle of hot sauce. I only used half the bottle and I couldn't believe how hot it was. I had to add brown sugar and catsup just to calm it down.  Wouldn't make again.

I feel as though all the flavor stays with the onion, pepper, juice mixture.  So if you remove the meat prior to fork shredding it, the flavor just won't get into the meat.  Therefore, I recommend you shredd the meat a half an hour or so prior to removing it from the cooker.  That way, the flavor gets well distributed in the meat. I was also concerned it would be too spicy with 5oz. of Hot Sauce.  I used a combo of both red & green Tobasco and it turned out pretty good. This recipe is one you can tinker with to find what you enjoy.  But the fundamental ingredients & cooking process is spot on!!  I ain't done experimenting with it... Thanks!!

Super Easy to make and the house smelled amazing! Cooked it overnight like others have done and literally woke my hubby up with hunger pains at midnight!  lol It made the best breakfast~scrambled in eggs, peppers and onions, we then topped it off with fresh tomatoes and shredded lettuce! It makes a ton of meat, so plan a party and share!!

Easy.  Actually cooked for roughly 12 hours in crock pot.  Came out extremely tender and pulled apart.  Was a bit spicy for the kids, but adults loved it.  Just right amount of heat.  Put on top of Lime Cilantro Rice.  Very good meal.

Great recipe, very simple yet different than your regular roast.
We loved it in tacos with lettuce, avacado and sour cream.

I used 1/2 the hot sauce it called for and it was the best taco meat EVER! We used it for tacos, nachos, burrittos and even while camping, I took some that I had froze and used it in pudgy pie makers over the fire for a cheese and taco meat pudgy pie sandwhich. Everyone whom I have made it for has loved it. Anyone who gives this a low score for too much "heat," use your noggin and notice that if it uses that much HOT sauce then of course it is going to be very HOT. Just cut it back to your liking.

Everyone had seconds!  I made this exactly as the recipe says.  I was a little concerned that it would be too spicy, especially for my youngest son, but he loved it.  So don't be too intimidated by the ingredients.  I know they look really spicy, but it really was perfect and had a great flavor.  The hot sauce I used was Cholula because that is our favorite.

This was delicious!!! My husband loved it! I used one whole can of the adobo peppers and it about burned my tongue off! Next time I will only use a couple of peppers. We made tacos that night from the roast, adding diced tomatoes, guac, cheese and sour cream. The next day, I cooked a couple quesadillas with it to send with my husband for lunch. I shredded fresh quesadilla cheese (found in the mexican section at the grocery) and then sprayed each side of the tortilla lightly with pam and browned it. We loved it!!! Thank you so much for this recipe!

just put a 4.5 lb bone in pork shoulder in the crock pot.   ususally skip the browning process but decided I would follow the recipe as close as I could.  The only change I made was due to no green chiles.  I substitued a can of adobo chile, chopped.  It already smells wonderful.  Planning on serving over polenta.  Yum

So easy to make and incredibly versatile! Toned it down for the kiddos (3 oz or so of hot sauce, half the cayanne/chile pepper). Added mexican oregano and cumin along with paprika. Served on french rolls broiled with garlic butter, provolone and/or gouda cheese, tomatoes, avacado, lettuce and mayo. YUMMM...had a sandwich yesterday and today and loved them! But that's my limit...I don't do alot of red meat and I can feel it...
UPDATE: made this again with full hot sauce (Tapatio brand-  it's not that hot)  and full spices but increasing chili powder to 1 Tbs and added 1/2 tsp cumin (a must). For peppers I used jalapeños. Following Impush's suggestion, I removed the onion/peppers with a slotted spoon after it was done (for the kids), shredded the beef and added back to the juices with 1/2 tsp cumin and 1 tsp paprika. Cooked it for another 30-60 min to soak up the juices. 
It was far from being too hot even with added spices/jalapeños but I'm used to spicy food. Made a lot of machaca, taquito's, wraps and more with this meat. Great to have on hand!

The meat was very tender and easy to shred, but we found that it lacked flavor and kick.  DH said it did not have much of a Mexican taste.  Thanks for sharing but unfortunately I probably won't make this again.

i was a little scared about adding all the hot sauce, but I'm so glad I did. The recipe was great. I also stir fried the meat to get all the sauce out and it was perfect.

I used pork and as I don't have a crockpot, I just cooked it on the stovetop. Great for burritos and very easy to put together. Thank you for a simple and tasty recipe!

I love this recipe!  I had a 'pot roast' sitting in my freezer and this was an unexpected wonderful alternative.  I didn't brown it, just threw it in the Crock pot with my favorite hot sauce, seasonings, onion, tomato sauce (didn't have diced tomatoes), some Adobe peppers - I shredded it after 4 hours and then cooked for about 2 hours.  For me, it was a spicy Chipotle Barbacoa - I loved it! So happy for the Pot Roast alternative!

This is a nice, spicy filling for home-made tacos,  enchiladas, burritos, quesadillas, Mexican casseroles, or whatever Mexican dish you need shredded beef for.  Like many others, I tweak it to suit my personal taste--I add cumin, go heavy on the chili powder, and throw in a beef bouillon cube. I also don't bother with browning the meat first, it seems uneccesary. The secret to thoroughly saturated flavor is, after the meat is shredded, strain out the green chiles and onions and put the shredded meat back into the sauce to simmer on low for another couple of hours. My husband loves this and will even make sandwiches with it.

I was looking for a way to use up some things I had on hand when I found this, and used it more as a template than a recipe.  I used a chuck roast (I did brown it but will try it without browning next time), a can of Rotel tomatoes, a can of chopped chilis, one large diced onion, and some of the Taco Seasoning from this site (Bill Echols I think.....I keep it on hand always!)  Cooked it on high 6 hours, shredded it in the crock pot and let it sit a while.  Then reheated it on low when we were ready to eat.  Fantastic!!!!   Hubby really liked it.  Would make awesome burritos as well.  You can tweak this one a lot.  I will be using this often.  I also think you could do the same thing and change up the ingredients, like tomato sauce, canned mushrooms, peppers and onions for a sphaghetti sauce.

alright base recipe so i made some changes! after 5 hours in the crockpot w seasonings just the way the recipes says except much less hot sauce. figured we could always add more if it wasnt hot enough. i tasted it whoa hot stuff and i like spicey. so i added another half a can of beef broth to dilute. flavor wasnt amazing so i added a lot of garlic powder more paprika, cumin, some mccormicks montreal steak seasoning, two bay leaves. i also shredded the beef. after another hour tried it again yummy! cooled down the heat factor just a touch and added so much flavor cant wait to try it in a taco. i actually think this recipe on its own is 3.5 stars.

i use a high quality chuck roast, other roasts or meats work fine to. sear your meat if you wish, place in crock pot then add all your seasonings, also add a few pepper corns,1 bay leaf, and 1 1/2 tsp. smoked paprika (more or less) 1 or 2 bottles of modello, or corona.. (but first heres the trick if you have access to a mexican market, go there and pick yourself up 2 or 3 varieties of fresh mexican peppers any colors, then find the cascabel, its in the mexican spice section) then add chopped or whole peppers and whole cascabell 2 is fine (there is no need to chop up your fresh peppers seeing is your just using them for flavor,cutting them up exposes the seeds and makes it hotter especially if you plan on returning the meat to the liquid) add your hot pepper sauce if you wish, but it probably wont do much as far as meat flavor, cook 6 to 8 hrs. low. i then strain off the liquid, and pour some over the shredded meat in a shallow dish, ... enjoy, and Happy Cooking.

My husband made this with a (locally-raised) Black Angus chuck roast, low sodium beef broth, 2 cans diced green chilies, roasted garlic, several 'splashes' of hot sauce, smoked paprika and put a smoked habanero on top. It smelled amazing and he, his friends and co-workers LOVED it (I don't eat meat). It'll be a game-day staple right next to my meatless stout chili :)

This was pretty good.  I used 3 jalepenos (not seeded) in place of the green chile pepper and it still wasn't that spicey.  Not sure I'll make it again but it wasn't bad.

When I made this I used a pork loin roast since there is less fat.  I was scared to use all the spices because I do not like things really spicy so I only used half of what measurements the recipe called for. The meat was very good and actually next time I will follow the recipe exactly because it wasn't very spicy. I used chipotle hot pepper sauce as this is all I could find in the store.

Exellent recipe!  The whole house smells like Manwich Sloppy Joes when it is cooking.  I use the meat in enchillada's and burritos, and my husband loves it....and that's saying something.

This was really good. I was making fajitas with a different recipe that my bf really likes. I had too much meat & have been wanting to try this recipe for about 6 years now so I threw the rest of the meat in the crock pot. Then I never tried this & put it in the freezer for about 2 weeks. Pulled it out on a night I didn't want to cook, it was so good! My bf said it was better than the fajita meat he loves. Will definately make again!

This was great. I prepared as written except I used a green chile sauce ONLY because the red sauces at my store all said extra hot. I made a small roast since there are only 2 of us, but I look forward to making a larger one and using the leftovers for enchilada filling!

This recipe is spicy and delicious. My husband LOVES it. We call it "atomic beef" too. I do not make any changes to the original recipe. I try and shred the meat with a few hours left to cook so it soaks in the juice. I'm going to try and freeze the leftovers next time. It's a lot of food for two people to eat!

Very spicy! We use 1/2 the amount of hot sauce and it is perfect! Versatile. Love it with chicken, beef, and pork.

I used around 3 oz of hot sauce and that was perfect as far as I'm concerned, that way people can add more heat if they want but it didn't overwhelm those who don't like things quite as hot.  I left my onion and jalapeno in big chunks so I could fish them out before shredding the beef and then letting it sit on low for another hour.  I'd definitely make this again.

This was good, easy to follow, I just felt it was lacking something, not quite sure of what though. Cooked on high for 6 hours, tuned to low until we were ready to eat. It fell apart ! Loved that part ! Will be making it again, looking for the 'missing' ingredient ! Thanks for sharing !!!

This was fabulous.  I made a few alterations.  First, due to timing issues, I cooked it on low for 9-10 hours then shredded it and kept it on warm for another hour (allowing me to leave it cooking while I was at work all day).  I also used beer and some chicken stock for the liquid, though I added too much so had to boil some of it down while I was shredding the meat.  Either way it was a huge hit at my cinco de mayo fiesta.

Excellent!  I substituted one bottle of Corona for the water and that was sufficient.  Otherwise, I followed recipe exactly and let it cook on high for 6 hours and on low for only about 1 hour.  Shredded the meat and served it on tortillas with lettuce, tomato, cheese, and guacamole.  Super spicy and not for the faint of heart, but I did use fresh chiles, really hot sauce, chipotle chili powder, and cayenne.

I loved this recipe! I added a corona instead of water. I think it helped it tenderize faster and add a little more flavor. I also pureed the diced onion. I used it for nachos, tacos, my dad ate it by itself.

This recipe is fantastic! We had a Mexican-themed party and served this meat as the main filler for tacos. We cut the meat into smaller pieces to cook and took it out when it reached the desired temp. We shredded it by hand into a tin foil pan, basted it with the juices, covered it, and stored it in a barely warm oven. It is spicy, but this method kept it on the mild side for guests who don't like spice.

I used a 2lb piece of meat and thought that even with the unaltered spice directions, it needed MUCH more. I know this is a matter of taste, but I found I ended up adding 4x as much as directed.

I made this with chicken as the description says it can be used with all kinds of meat, but It just wasn't that special to me. It wasn't bad or anything just not  yummy enough that I would really care to make it again. Sorry Charley...maybe I'll give it a shot with the beef and see if it can redeem itself for me.

I made this with only two adjustments. I added one teaspoon of cumin & one beef bouillon cube. I did use the whole bottle of hot sauce. We LOVED this on tacos with cilantro lime rice. Can't wait to try this with Pork!

Very tasty foundation beef for Mexican dishes. However, next time I would really cut back on any liquid as chuck roasts are great moisture makers on their own. The family really enjoyed this meal which I just served on toasted tortillas with pico de gallo, but I could also see using it in tamales. Thanks for sharing Charley:)

Wow! I used my own Smokey Habanero Hot Sauce recipe instead of bottled, and I followed Rachel's idea of reducing the resultant juices down with the meat in a skillet.  AMAZING!   Adding to my review... Started a second batch because we ate the whole first batch for dinner. This stuff is absolutely OUTSTANDING!!!!!

This was VERY spicy, and I didn't add nearly as much hot sauce as it called for, and I left out the diced green chile pepper.  We used wild pork for this recipe.  I think next time I'll cut way down on the hot sauce and still leave out the pepper.

I have now made this two times and plan on making it on a regular basis!! It is sooo good and makes so much. Can be used to make shredded beef tacos and burros. Plus enchaladas. I even  use up the juice with some of the meat making a Indian Stew. Out of this world.

I have to agree with many who said that this dish is more about being hot than it is about flavor.  I followed the directions fairly closely, although I did scale back on the hot pepper sauce a bit.  It was indeed extremely hot.  I used beef broth as the liquid base instead of water.  If it weren't for that, this wouldn't have had much flavor at all.  I rescued the dish by adding some home made taco seasoning to the crock pot toward the end.  The meat was very tender, though. I'm giving this 3 stars because I think it has great potential if you adjust it to your own taste.  As is, it was just ok.

I can't believe I waited so long to fix this.  It was delicious - I didn't change a thing.  (I used Frank's hot sauce.)  This made the best tacos I have ever had.  I served it with small flour tortillas, cheese, shredded cabbage, red onion, diced avocado and sour cream.  I felt like I was at Pure Taqueria.

This is a great recipe.  I made it 1 1/2 ago and I loved it.  I have tried many other recipes since, but none compared to this one.  I will only be making this recipe from now on.   The only things I did different were....I poured a can of beef broth over the roast instead of water, added a tsp of cumin, and used fresh garlic.  Turns out great.

I have made this recipe exactly as called for and I have made it following the recommendations of Impish (the first review) - and although its got quite a kick, I now make it like that all the time.  I thought it was a flavorful spicy...not burn your lips off spicy.   If you can take the heat, its delicious!

This was really good, especially the day after.  I cut down the chili powder, cayenne pepper, and hot sauce by half-it still had a good kick to it.  Like suggested I added a beef bullion cube and after shredding beef added it back to the crock pot for 1.5 hours.

I used a marked down chuck roast and only used one can of diced green chilis. I have small children so I didn't add the whole amount of hot pepper sauce, chili pepper or cayenne pepper because I'm feeding small kids. (I could see how that would be good, for a grown-up dinner.) This was great meat to use in the Fabulous Wet Burritos which is also from this site. Next time, I might rub some cumin and coriander into the meat as well.

This was a good way to prepare chuck roast.  I used 8 oz of chopped green chiles, cut way back on the hot sauce and added 1/2 teaspoon of cumin and a can of beeth broth.  We liked this served in tortillas topped with cheese.

I only had a 1.41 pounder so I decided to cut everything in half, except the chiles which I used 1 small can, and the hot sauce which I used only 2 ounces. I also added 1/4 teaspoon cumin as recommended by many. I cooked it on high for 5 hours, shredding it after 4 hours and it was super tender and very flavorful. It was spicy... in the verge of being too spicy for me (but I'm a wimp, it was fine).

This must be fool proof.  My friend and I decided to have some Margaritas while we were waiting for this to finish cooking and I turned it to low after 6 hours and went to check on it after 2 more hours.  It was so perfectly done, falling apart and flavorful.  The thing is, when I turned it to low, I accidently turned it off but it sat with the lid on for 2 hours and it was perfect.  PERFECT!  Not too hot, I followed the recipe except for fresh garlic and a teaspoon of cumin.  My friend raved about it and took a dish home to her husband.  We didn't even bother with side dishes (we were drinking Cadillac Margaritas after all) but ate it with corn tortillas, pico de gallo from this site and more Margaritas.  I am definitely making this again.

Fantastic!!  I used Cholula hot sauce (chili garlic blend) and the flavor was phenomenal.  As others suggested, I put some beef broth in with the meat as well.  This is the most tender and flavorful slow cooker recipe for shredded beef I have found!

This was great in burritos, but needs a lot more green chilis to stew with.  It makes a lot of meat, so will make burritos to freeze next time.

I made this and used it to fill enchiladas. Yummy! I had to be careful when baking the enchiladas, because if baked too long, the sauce from the meat will burn to the bottom of the casserole dish. This has some kick to it, but not so much that you are reaching for the water glass to stop the burning in your mouth.

Always a hit!  People will think this recipe was passed down to you by a Mexican Grandma.  People who have said it is too spicy-- the type of hot sauce you use and the kind of chilis you use can drastically impact the heat level of this dish- I come from a family that likes it spicy but not hot just for the sake of being hot, and they all love this. My 82 year old Grandma eats it with no problem (but again, we like spicy food). 

For the hot sauce,I use Cholula hot sauce ('Original' flavor), and for the diced green chilis, I use three of the little cans of diced green chilis they sell alongside canned refried beans-- the green chilis that come in those little 6oz (approx) cans aren't even hot, but they add a nice aroma and flavor.  When I am making this for people other than my husband and I, I reduce or omit the cayenne unless I know the people I'm serving it to can handle it.  

I don't know how someone could say this was so hot they couldn't taste it- they need to reevaluate their ingredients- IF I used habanero hot sauce and fresh jalapenos for the diced chilis, I wouldn't be able to eat it either, but I don't think it's fair to give a recipe one star and say that the people who like it just want to prove how tough they are- maybe we all just used common sense and our own discretion.

Very good recipe! We served this inside corn tortillas with all of the fixings. The leftovers look kind of unappealing though, as the fat reconstitutes. But just eat it all when it's ready and you won't have that problem!

This is the best recipe for shredded meat I have found.  I buy a large chuck roast and use the meat for fajitas one night and then enchiladas the next... if there's any leftovers.

This recipe provides endless possibilities (tacos, taco salad, quesadillas, burritos, omlettes. etc).  I'll cut back a little on the hot sauce next time (so I can sneak pieces to the dog :-)  This is a good staple to keep on hand in the freezer.

This was okay. I followed the top reviewers advice to use Tapatio sauce, add cumin, etc. The spice factor was high, which I like, but after cooking overnight, I wanted more flavor. I added a few squirts of ketchup to taste (not enough to sweeten, but to counter the spice a bit) and then a can each of diced tomatoes and diced green chiles. Garlic also helped. To make the meat moist, it definitely has to be shredded, so unfortunately, no chunky meat for me. I'll try this again though, as a base. Thanks for the recipe.

UPDATE: SAVE YOURSELF SOME TIME AND READ ONLY ONE REVIEW. MAMASPICE'S TIPS ARE GENIUS! THE LAST TIME I MADE THIS, MY MEAT HAD A VERY VINEGARY TASTE. I USED TOBASCO BRAND CHIPOTLE SEASONED SAUCE THIS TIME AROUND AND IT WAS GREAT (NOT VINEGARY AT ALL!). THANKS! Not bad. My bf said he could barely taste the meat and thought it had a strong vinegar taste (I guess, from the Tobasco hot sauce...), but otherwise we both really liked this. I pretty much followed Charley's directions to the letter except for halving everything and incorporating a few of Impish's changes. Here's what I did: a) generously s&p'd a 2 lb. chuck roast (as opposed to using the suggested amounts), b) subbed a 4 oz. can of partially drained diced jalapenos for fresh chiles, c) subbed a 14.5 oz. can of beef broth for the water called for, d) seasoned my roast with 1 1 1/2 t chili powder and 3/4 t cumin, e) cooked on high for six hours, shredded, strained (including the onions / peppers), returned to the slow cooker, seasoned again (this time with 1/2 t paprika / 1/4 t cumin) and cooked on low for ANOTHER 1 1/2 hours. I appreciate the versatility of this recipe and am planning to save leftovers for making beef enchiladas. While I am not completely sold on the combo of flavors (the meat was too hot for my liking), I think this is slightly better than Mijo's shredded beef. I'm still on the lookout for the perfect recipe, but until I find it, this will do! Thanks for sharing your recipe, Charley :)

We live in San Diego and LOVE this recipe. I used Cholula hot sauce the first time and Tapatio the second time. Both were good, but I liked it better with the Cholula since it smelled less like vinegar in my house and I love this hot sauce better anyways. GREAT for potlucks!

Sooo Good! Definetly shred the beef and then put it back in the crockpot for at least an hour so that the liquid absorbs into the meat. I defatted my liquid in between shredding the beef.

I made this for a party last night and it was a big hit. warmed up flour and corn tortillas and served with chopped cilantro, chopped onion, chopped habenaro peppers and sliced avocadoes. I just added cumin. Put in crockpot for 6 hours,took meat out and shredded, then put back in crockpot.  Everybody raved on how good it was.

This was excellent. My husband and I both enjoy spicy cuisine so this was great for us. The flavor was fabulous and the meat was so tender. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

You can change the heat easily by using mild or hot green chilis.

This recipe was easy, delicious, and it makes a ton!  I halved the recipe for a 2 pound roast and my husband and I ate three large dinners plus one lunch from the meat.  So versatile - make burritos or baked chimichangas with refried beans - delish!

Yum-azing!!!  My husband took this to a work potluck and I got 6 phone calls for the recipe!  It was a little spicy for our family, so when I make it for home, I use less hot sauce.

I stumbled upon this recipe while looking for something a bit different than the "traditional" pot roast for this cut of meat and was pleasantly surprised. Mine turned out a bit watery but it was good... instead of using red pepper/hot sauce I used a bottle of tabasco's green pepper sauce... it had a little bit of heat but not molten like some have complained about.

I have made this recipe SEVERAL times and always received many compliments as well as asking how I make it :) I make it as is and use about 5-8oz of Tapatio hot sauce. After it is finished cooking I shred the meat and let it soak everything up and get some more flavor for at least 20min before serving. I have to beat my husband off with a fork to keep him from eating it right outta the pot, his nose & eyes watering all the while because it is SPICY but oh so yummy!!! :) I usually put the meat w/ beans and cheese to make homemade chimis and the beans even out the spicy-ness really well. DELICIOUS!!

Added less cayenne and hot sauce then stated so it wouldn't be too spicy for the kids. When I tasted tested the meat it seemed a bit too spicy, so i shredded it and made taquitos out of it. Thought the meat tasted great, would make again for sure. Oh, I also did not brown the meat first. I did not have time in the am to do so, I did everything the night prior and then just popped it all into the container in the morning. So easy. Next time I will plan it when I can brown it to see if it makes any kind of difference.

This recipe is amazing! It's so easy and doesn't have many ingredients.  I have never made anything so authentic tasting in my life! I've eaten it at least once a day until it was gone! I used this meat to make tacos like they do at las taquerias.... with fried corn tortillas and topped with chopped cilantro and chopped onion and salsa verde. AMAZING! Will definately make this recipe again and again. Thank you!

Finally got around to making this (I printed it out in 2004) & wonder why I waited so long. This has a nice kick to it & we've used in wraps, & eggs so far. Will try also with other types of meat. I did use less cayenne, chili powder & hot sauce & added 1 tsp cumin (while cooking & 1/2 tsp after shredding) per others suggestions.

I'm giving this five stars for many reasons.  Ease of preperation, amount that it makes (I'll get at least 3+ meals out of a 4lb roast) and taste.  I followed the directions exactly except for adding the 5oz bottle of hot sauce.  I was seriously worried about getting "heat" from it and no taste.  I probably used 1/2 of the bottle and it was fine.  I'm already thinking of busy days or parties where this would be the perfect thing to serve to a large group and have it be economical.  Thanks for sharing this recipe this one is a keeper.

i have now used this recipe at least ten times and this is the best mexican meat ever! my dad, who never says anything complimentary about anyones cooking, said it was better than the best mexican food restaurant in town! i almost fell out of my chair when he said that! i only leave out the bottle of hot sauce cause i have 2 little ones and i cant set them on fire ;) anyway this recipe is wonderful, i make it and we eat and the left overs we separate and freeze. you can actually use a larger roast than even called for there is enough chiles and onion to balance it out, and i dont really measure my spices so im sure i dump in more dry spices than called for but it is soooo good!

Wonderful recipe and concept!  I was a bit skeptical when I first read this, because I've tried many ways (in vain I might add) to get my Salsarita's Shredded Beef burrito fix, living about 3 hours from the nearest one, every time I tried a recipe, which promised this type of meat I was craving, I was left disappointed, with soupy meat, that seemed more like stew than shredded beef, and an overall raw taste from the tomatoes the recipe called for.  I can't thank Charley enough for submitting this!  I made minor alterations, added just a touch of cumin, and a whole head of fresh minced garlic (what can I say, I love the stuff) along with extra cayenne, thinking nothing would be hot enough for my tastes.  The first few hours, the smell from the crockpot was a little questionable, but I cooked on high for 6 hours, dropped it to low for 2, then shredded the beef.  I scooped out most of the onions and peppers that were left, then folded the beef back into the liquid, which remained.  This was simply heavenly!  I'm ashamed to say I couldn't stop eating while I was packing it away. (I made it for the following day.)  I will definitely make this recipe again! I think it'd even be fantastic with pork! Can't wait to make this again! Thanks so much Charley!

This was delicious... I used in chimichangas, which were great!  The meat can also be frozen and used in a variety of dishes.  I did add cumin as well.

I was really excited to try this, but disappointed in the results.  I made it according to the recipe the first time and all you could taste was the hot sauce (used tabasco, maybe that was the problem).  Made it again and cut back on the hot sauce added cumin and some other spices and it is pretty bland.  It's pretty easy, but looking for more flavor.

I used pork and made carnitas. It was very good, but a bit spicy for our taste. I will cut down the spice next time and I think it will be perfect!

This was good - not as great as I expected.  The flavor was good, but I think I'll try it again with a different cut of meat because it was still a little tough.  Tasty in tortillas.

This was very good.  I reduced the heat in it since we aren't into really spicy food.  I cut the hot sauce in half and left out the peppers.  It was still a bit hot, so next time I think I'll cut back on the cayenne pepper too.  I cooked it on high for 6 hours, then pulled the meat, added cumin and paprika as another reviewer recommended and then cooked it on low for another 3 hours.  We served it in soft shell tacos with Mexican Rice II and Sweet Corn Cake!

My GOODNESS, this is good!  I just finished shredding the meat, and it's now bubbling away in my Crock Pot, waiting for my husband to get home.  If I manage to wait for him, it'll be a miracle.

I used a very cheap pork roast ($6.00 for a 6-lb roast), and I think the fresh pepper I used was a poblano (the kind they use to make chili rellenos.  I also added half a small can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, but other than that I stuck to the recipe.  I had a few nibbles when I was shredding the meat, and almost swooned!

Not sure what we did wrong but the meat was very bland.  Very tender though.  We added jalopeno juice to make it edible.  Would not make again.

We went to San Diego and Mexico this summer and had alot of excellent, authentic Mexican dishes.  This is an awesome recipe for burritos/tacos.  We will probably never use ground beef again!

HOLY MOLY is all I can say.  This meat is soo good!!!!  My only suggestion is trim as much fat as possible before you start cooking.  I did a add 1 beef bouillon cube and 1/2 tsp of cumin.  I don't think this could be any better!!!!  THANK YOU for the recipe!!!

Very good!  I followed the advice of some of the others and shreadded the meat half way through and cooking it in the juices for the remainder of the time.  I left out the peppers on accident and it still came out very flavorful!

Yummy!  I used stew beef instead of a roast and browned all sides in a skillet B4 threw I threw it in the crock pot.  I cooked it on high for about 4 hours- much easier and quicker than the roast for 8 hours!  I also added some fresh cilantro and ground cumin. This "Mexi-meat" is great  for burritos or over Spanish yellow rice and bleack beans or with some salsa verde.  Yummy!

Very good! I ate a lot of tacos and burritos after making this! I used Tapatio and added a dash of Dave's Insanity Spice to boost the heat. Awesome Mexican shredded beef!

This was delicious! I made this for large gathering, and I used a 2.5 lb bottom round roast and cooked it on low for 10hrs, and it came out juicy and tender.  I pulled the meat apart about 1.5 before it was done so that it could soak up the spices.  I think next time I'll use 1/2 the hot sauce because it was so spicy...we're punks! A definite make again!

This was excellent. I made it with chicken. It was perfect for the enchiladas I was making. I changed three things though. I halved the amount of hot sauce(I'm a wuss), I added to teaspoons of cumin, and I added an additional 2 tablespoons of garlic.

The meat was flavorful without being too spicy. I had several friends over for dinner and was worried I had made too much food but, I ran out in a hurry.

Very flavorful, but very watery.    It was wonderful with hard tacos and as leftovers for a taco salad!  I will drain next time.  I will also change the hot sauce from Frank's RedHot to Tabasco-Chipoltle.

Really tasty, ate burritos for days using the meat, didn't have to do much but put it in the slow cooker and let it be. Have made it twice already.

The flavor was good, but next time, I will use a different cut of meat. This meat was still tough  for me. It's amazing how simple ingredients can make something taste so good.

WOW.  All I can say:  Wow.

Get ready for melt-in-your-mouth goodness.  I added a 2T of minced garlic, and 1T of dried, crushed Ancho Chiles.  Booming with flavor!!!  Great for use with the recipe for "Beef Tamales" (also found on this site) but would be great wrapped up in a soft tortilla!!

I made this yesterday for today, to have something easy for football.  I will have to say that this was very easy to prepare, and has great flavor!  I will definitely make this again.

I read the reviews and modified the recipe to my taste and it was Fabulous. I added some fresh minced garlic, and after cooking it 6 hours, I shredded it (it fell apart) and fried it in a pan with some of the juice and a half packet of Hot taco mix. I scooped out some of the onion and pepper from the crock pot and then threw the meat back in there on "warm" until we were ready to eat (tacos). Going to use the leftovers (not very much) for a nacho dip on Sunday. Can't go wrong with this recipe, do it according to your own taste.

This was great but didn't end up as spicy as I would've liked, which was surprising.  I used a whole bottle of hot sauce and several jalapenos and I guess next time I'll just add more.

It does have a kick to it, but it is not to bad if you are used to spicy foods.  Served it with cilantro, onion, and lime juice on top.  Yummy!

Very good.  I did add a couple of boullion cubes and worchestershire sauce.  Suggest cutting your meat into chunks so the flavor is in all of the meat instead of just on the outside.  Will make again and again!!

My husband and girls LOVED this meat.   I felt it was good, but missing something although I couldn't tell you what.  We ate it as tacos (hard and soft), but I almost think I'd have liked it better on a bun as a sandwich.

This turned out really well. after about 4 hours i started shredding the meat. So it really soaked up all the flavors. I froze leftovers and made my husband a burrito last night. He just told me how good the meat was. Thanks

OH MY!! This was some good stuff. I took the advice of another reviewer and after shredding the meat, threw it into a skillet along with the juice and simmered until it evaporated. We ate it in burritos last night and going to make enchiladas tonight. This so good. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was good. I used a whole bottle of Tapitio hot sauce and it was too hot for my youngster. Next time I'll use way less or none at all (if people like the hot, they can add it to their taco or whatever.) This freezes really well.

Like with any recipe that calls for a prepared sauce as an ingredient, you need to like the sauce. And in this case I used Pico Pica. I love the spice of the sauce with out the burn of the vinager based sauces. Other then that I just tend to cook it on low till it falls apart, shred in the crock pot and let it soak up all the rest of the juices. Super yummy.

To me this did not taste so much like taco meat as it did pot roast.  Even still, it wasn't that bad, it just needed some extra zip.  Maybe some taco seasoning.  I also probably would not cook it as long.

I made this with chicken.  I cooked it on high for 4 hours and low for 3 hours.  Next time I will cook it for a little less time.

Wow, other reviewers were not kidding when they said this was spicy!  I made this exactly as described, but shredded the meat after it had finished cooking on high then let it simmer for another 2 hours to absord more of the flavor of the sauce.  Afterward, I sqeezed off excess juices with a slotted spoon.  This yielded very flavorful meat with a nice kick.  I love spicy, but can't imagine eating this with the sauce!

It was pretty good.  I used Tapatio and the beef went really well with lettus, tomatoes, and cheddar cheese on sourdough bread.

Nice flavor, but it was kind of bland in a way.  I'll make again and try to add some things.  It had a good spice so that makes it worth trying again.

This is definately a 5 star recipe.  Incredibly easy to prepare, and great flavor.  The meat just fell apart after 8hrs in the crockpot.  Can't wait to make this again. Oh, I did cook it in beef stock instead of water, but that's the only change I made.

I made some most delicious enchiladas with this meat recipe. Just be sure you know how much hot pepper sauce you like. I don't even own as much as this recipe calls for and so toned it down to our taste, as the author suggested. Excellent base for many Mexican meals!!

I halved this recipe because it was so plentiful!  I thought it was great, but had a slight "vinegar-like" taste to it.  Perhaps it was the pepper sauce that I used.  Next time I will salt and pepper the meat better, and I may also add some fajita seasoning to the crock pot.  I was very surprised that my 10 year old loved it!  It was pretty spicy, but he ate 4 tacos!  A definite repeat at my house.

I thought this was delicious.  I made it with chicken.  I toned down the spice a bit since I have tolerance for that sort of thing.  I will definitely use this int eh future.

This is awesome! Changes I made: I used fresh crushed garlic instead of garlic powder, used beer as the liquid, canned chilis instead of fresh and green Tobasco. I shredded the beef when done and poured enough of the liquid over it to moisten it up. Nice and spicy but doesn't burn your mouth. We made wet burritos with ours - filled flour tortillas with the meat, poured enchilada sauce on, topped with shredded cheddar. Tonight Im using the leftovers in enchiladas.

This recipes is REALLY yummy.  The meat was so tender and tasty.  I followed the directions exactly and was a little worried because I'm kind of a whimp with spicy foods, though my husband cannot get enough spice.  I kept tasting through out cooking and was worried it was going to be too spicy for me.  When the meat was done I took in out of all the gravy it was in and shredded it and though there was some spice it wasn't too bad at all.  I put some aside for myself and then added some of the gravy to my husbands which spiced it up for him.  We ate it flour tortillas with the fixings.  Definitly a new staple in my house!

This was awesome.  I made it with chicken, only used a 1/4 bottle of tabasco as I didn't know how hot it would turn out.  This was perfect.  I cooked it for 4 hours on high and 2 hours on low and it was too much.  The chicken started to get chewy.  So next time I'd probably try 4 hours on low and see if that works.  I'll make this again for sure!  Yummy!

This was just great!! I actually think this is a recipe for Barbacoa, but Charley didn't know it!! I served it as a taco with diced cabbage and onions and homemade salsa. My husband, who is from Mexico, loved it!! Thank you.

This recipe is a 10 star!!!  It had lots of flavor.  My boyfriend put it in the crockpot the night before.  The wonderful aroma was lingering through the house the entire night.  I could barely sleep.  We made burritos one day.  A couple days later I used the meat in a salad.  I was going to freeze it and warm up another day, but it was too good and we ate it up quickly.  Thanks for this great recipe!

Very easy and very good ! Used a 3# chuck roast and a little more hot sauce, ( I used Tapatio ) and minced garlic. Cooked for 7 hours. 3 on high and 4 on low then shredded the meat and simmered in the juice for another hour or 2. Tender and very flavorful tacos.

I have to rate a 3 because the meat was way too spicy for our taste.  Also, didn't seem to have a lot of flavor on the inside.  I'll have to cut back on spices and try again.

I served this last night for an informal get together with friends.  It was excellent.  Great flavor, but not too spicy.  I served it with flour tortillas, shredded lettuce, diced tomato, cheese, salsa, sour cream and red beans and rice.  It was so easy to make that my 11 year old son did most of the preparation (I insisted on flipping the roast in the pan when he was browning it).  Everyone had seconds, and raved about it.  The leftovers were great for lunch today, too.  Great recipe, Charley!

I cut the recipe in half and used chicken instead of beef. Cooked for two hours on high.  Tasted just like the chicken you get in a burrito or chimichanga at a Mexican restaurant.  Good stuff.

Holy Cow!!! This recipe is good! My husband and his friend scarfed this up with corn tortillas. Big hit with the family and EASY. I used 4 chili peppers and followed the rest of the recipe as written. This recipe tastes like you're eating at a mexican restaurant! Thanks for the excellent recipe!

This stuff is amazing! This was actually my first attempt at any kind of slow-cooker recipe, my wife and I just got our first slow-cooker as a wedding gift. This beats any mexican shredded beef I've ever had at a restaurant!

I love spicy stuff, so maybe this is why, but I certainly didn't find this recipe overwhelmingly spicy... I'd give it a mild to medium on the spice scale :)

And that's with a combination of Frank's and Tabasco Habanero sauce..

So easy and delicious!  I omitted the browning step as it makes the meat harder to shred, and left out the water as it's not necessary in my crock pot.  I also added cumin and adjusted the spices to taste.  This is great in any dish that calls for shredded beef, but we also enjoy it simply served with warmed tortillas and salsa.

Great!  I have made this twice now and both times it was great!  My friends love it in burritos.  Adjusted the hotsauce to my liking was all that I changed.

We love this recipe! I have used on hand stew meat and pork roast in place of roast - both are excellent.  I have tried jalepenos instead of hot sauce - but only use 1/4 - 1/2 cup unless you like it really hot.  I have started adding 1-2 Tbsp Cumin, sometimes chili powder, and have experimented with Cajan seasoning in place of cayenne.  Thanks Charley!

This smelled fantastic while it was cooking, but was so hot I couldn't even eat it.  My husband, who is a huge fan of spicy food, ate a little, but then couldn't take it.  We ended up going out for burgers.  Sorry.

This was a mixed review totally. Several people loved it and the others thought it was too spicy. Ones who said it was too spicy said they had major heartburn after eating this.

Great recipe!!!  I made a mistake and did the first 6 hours on low instead of high heat.  When I realized, I switched it to high for three more hours and it was perfectly tender!!  I used regular bell pepper and added some ancho chile powder.  overall, I cut down on the spice quite a bit, and I might try adding a little tomato paste next time for flavor.  Served it for friends and my husband and everyone loved it!  My three year old wouldn't eat it, but then there's not much she will eat.  Very glad there are some leftovers!!

My husband is from AZ and loves Mexican food. I tried this recipe. The first time I didn't have hot sauce. It was great. The next time I put 1/3 the amount of hot sauce and it tasted just right. I served it to my adult brothers, sisters and parents. It was an instant favorite. It taste even better than restaurant beef. I used inexpensive beef steaks and cubed them before cooking. I served it with flour tortillas, lettuce, tomatoes, and sour cream. With the leftover meat, I wrapped it in flour tortillas and froze it.

I thought I would try this out based on all the other glowing reviews.  It was simple to prepare by just placing in my crock pot ans forgetting it.  It cooked in the time listed on the recipe and my kids loved it as well.  I was scared away by the claims of how hot it was so I cut it in half and after eating it I wished I hadn't.  I like it spicy and think the recipe as is wold have been perfect.  But when cooking for both child and adult tastes, the half/heat would probably work best.  I intend to serve this for a dinner club I belong to and am sure it will get rave reviews, too.

This was an easy and delicious recipe! I made as directed and used the pork in burittos- they were super! It made a lot of meat, so I froze some of the burittos for a quick,easy snack for my husband and kids. They really ate them up! Thanks!

I was a bit hesitant about trying this but am sooo
glad that I did.  I tried it with chicken breasts and we used the meat for everything from chicken tacos to casserole dishes.  This recipe is absolutely out of this world.  My husband even put it on toasted hard rolls.  We just love it.  I am going to try it with beef next.

The amount of hot spices had me a little scared with this recipe so we used a little less hot sauce and peppers. It turned out very good, not too hot. The spices do add up the more you eat. My kids thought it was too hot though. Great for a tex mex kind of crowd.

I actually pressure cooked it for 75 minutes on high.  Too spicy for kids, but mellows out quite a bit if you chill it and skim off the fat then reheat.  It is the best taco and burrito meat you will ever have.

We absolutely love this recipe!  I first made it for a large dinner party we host every year - it received rave reviews from our guests.  It is spicy, but you can adjust those with the water added & spices added.  We eat this as fajitas w/ marinated peppers & onions and of course the other toppings!

This has become part of our permanent recipes!  In fact, it was our Christmas dinner last year & I believe that is a new tradition we will have!

btw - I have laughed at some of the other reviews about it being too spicy or not spicy enough!  

Definitely make this recipe - if you're skeptical, cut it down - but try it!!!  The shredded meat freezes well, and is great to pull out for quick meals!

This is the best shredded beef I've tasted! I've been trying similar recipes for years, trying to find the perfect one, and this is it. I substituted with 28 oz can of Rotel, and served on corn tortillas.

Yikes, I used fresh green chilis and I diced them.  I also used 1/2 tabasco and 1/2 franks hot sauce.  I like it hot, but not that hot!  However, the meat was super tender and really good - with a lot of water!  =)  I would make this again for sure.  Give this one a try.

I loved it. It was too spicy for everyone else, so I got a lot of burritos and tacos to eat. Good thing we have a freezer.

Very delicious...total hit in our house...however, I used only half the bottle of hot sauce and I’m glad I did. Spicy! I love really spicy food, but the kids do not.

I used about half the amount of hot pepper sauce (what I had on hand) and after the meat finished cooking, I seared it and the juices in a skillet like some recommended. We would definitely make this again!

I have made this with chuck roast and chicken more times than I can count.  My modifications: I use stock instead of water for flavor and I use half of the cayenne so it's not so spicy.  You can adjust the seasoning to control the heat, because if you make as written, it is very spicy! i have made this for potlucks and parties and I always get asked for the recipe.  My teenage daughter made it with chicken for her class potluck and it was the most popular dish!

This is super yummy!  I bought a 5lb chuck roast from Costco and cut it into 4 pieces, then seasoned and seared before adding to the crock pot- which I lined with a crock pot liner for easier clean up..  I only quartered the onions, so I could remove them later on, I also used minced garlic instead of garlic powder and I used beef broth instead of water.  I cooked it on low for about 8-10 hours (overnight).  Once the meat was tender enough to shred, I removed the pieces of meat and put onto a large plate and I also removed the bag of cooking liquid and put it aside.  I put a new crockpot liner inside the pot and I shredded the meat (removing the fat) and added it back to the crockpot, then ladled several spoonful's of the cooking liquid back to the meat (straining it while doing so), to keep the meat moist and remove the large pieces of onions.  I used it to make street tacos and it was delicious.  Not too spicy at all!  Next time, I think I'll try the suggestion another reviewed game, adding some cumin and paprika to the meat after shredding it, to give it some more flavor.

I have been making this for a while and have loved it every time.  We end up with lots of left over meat. Which we use to make either taco soup or enchiladas.

I’ve tried this with beef and pork. It has a great taste, shreds easy and lasts for a few days in the fridge. I looked at several other recipes, liked this one, and then modified it for taste and time.  Unless you like really spicy, forget the habanero sauce.  It’s probably more spice than most norteños would like.  Instead I used half a can of Hatch diced jalapeños and a whole can of Hatch mild green chilies. Adjust the jalapeños to suit your taste.  I also skipped the sear of the roast. Instead, just cover the bottom of the slow cooker with olive oil, place the roast in the middle, sprinkle the mixed herbs over the roast, and then cover it with the the chilies.  Let it cook for 4 to 6 hours on low.  Add a little water (1/2 cup or so) after a couple of hours to keep it from drying out.  This is perfect for tacos (the traditional tortillas from Sprouts are the best!).  Add a little sour cream to cut the heat, a little lettuce or cabbage, and your favorite salsa.  You’ll swear they just came off your favorite street taco truck.

Didn't end up adding the hot sauce (because I forgot) but very good without it. Added cumin in same proportion to other spices. Doubled the rub recipe for 2 roasts, browned, then deglazed  cooker bowl with water and beef flavor base. Cooked on "stew", rapid pressure release, then opened and flipped the roasts to make sure all were cooked in the broth. Cooked another 15 minutes. 
Removed the meat, shredded, used gravy separator on the broth and added some back to the meat to keep moist. It was a hit at a football party.

I did not sear before putting in slow cooker. I took advice from others about too much heat so I used one of the larger cans of green chilies and only a few dashes of hot sauce. Had just enough spice for our taste! Making it again this weekend.

This is definitely a keeper. I made it in a pressure cooker instead of a slow cooker but kept it on low for a couple of hours (added some citrus juices to keep it moist). After reading the description, I added chicken. Regarding the hot sauce, I had a half bottle of Cholula chili garlic sauce that I used. I dumped in a half bottle of -what I thought was - habanero hot sauce. It turned out to be ghost chili sauce. Needless to say, it was super hot but super delicious. Even the wimpy eaters in my house loved it, ignoring their burning mouths. So, thumbs up over here! Thanks for the recipe.

Wow was this boring...after letting it cook on low for 10 hours with all the ingredients plus cumin and chopped garlic we expected a flavor explosion but it was bland ...basically just a pot roast. Had to add some green chilli sauce just to give it some interest...waste of time and ingredients will not make again

I changed mine a lot.  I seasoned with smoked sea salt and creole seasoning then browned it.  Then I re-seasoned the meat with the salt, pepper, creole, lots of fresh ground cumin, some rosemary, and extra smoked paprika.  I deglazed the pan with beef stock.  

I trussed the trimmed meat tightly using cooking twine, placed in a 14" covered deep skillet.  I covered the meat with the fresh chopped onions, a shallot, some garlic salt and  2/3'rds special beef stock that was pre-cooked with some cumin, onions, shallots, shredded carrots, and other various stew spices.  

Cooked in a 250F convection oven for 55 minutes (temp tested beef rare).  Cut in half and cooled for an hour.  Then placed in 2 food storage containers with the stock (1/2 in each) and refrigerated overnight.  Mine did not shred like a slow cooker, but it sliced easily.  Heated in the juice and served in flour tacos w/ lettuce, cilantro, avocado, sour cream, lime juice, and lime salsa.

The key to this recipe is to spice to your taste.  I don't like hot, but I loaded up on the creole because the meat needs to flavor through.  That is why I seasoned and browned it after cutting out the fat and then seasoned it again before trussing.  That is also why you only cook it rare and let it sit overnight.  It needs to absorb the flavor.  That way you don't overcook it during the reheat in the microwave.

This was a hit- followed one reviewers suggestion and did not brown the meat first, shredded the meat after 5 hours, then returned it to the crock pot for another 2 hours, then put everything in a large pan and cooked it until it was browned. I also covered with beef broth instead of water and added red bell peppers at the end.

Delicious and very flavorful.  I read a review on another recipe recommending this as a filling for beef tamales and decided to try it myself- worked perfectly!

Wow!  This made an excellent taco!  I did cut the cayenne  and the hot pepper sauce (Tabasco jalapeno) in half because I'm a wimp.  This was REALLY good.

I used my electric pressure cooker to make this and it turned out amazing! I browned the sides using the "sauté" setting, then I switched the setting to "meat/stew" to finished the slow cooker process. I was feeding several children that night, so I didn't put in as much of the Mexican hot sauce. I also didn't have any diced green chilis around the house, so I used a large can of green enchilada sauce instead. I thought the flavor and texture was amazing! I got amazing reviews from my sister and her family as well as all of mine. I will definitely recommend this!

The only thing I did differently was accidently tossed more spices in since I didn't read the directions carefully. Ohhh and I didn't have a full bottle of hot sauce so I dumped in what I had and then added water to the bottle then dumped that in too. ;) This is one of those "it doesn't matter what you do to it" kind of recipes as it will likely turn out amazing! Thank you so very much for sharing. I'm in love. And now I have enough to freeze for a few more meals!!

OMG, this was FANTASTIC!  There's just two of us so I used 1lb tri-tip so I had to cut the ingredients by ~1/4.  I used Salsa Brava since it's not that vinegary, and 1 can hot green chiles, then pretty much followed the preparation advice from Impish, except for the cooking time which was 4 hours on high, then another 2 hours on low after the meat was shredded. Since tri-tip can be pretty fatty (but the meat is oh so moist!) I strained the juices with one of those fat separator measuring cups with the strainer on top.  So basically, skimming off all of the fat and removing most of the onions/chiles. I then shredded the meat and re-added the strained liquid. While very flavorful, it wasn't very spicy, so next time I'll use a can of jalapenos instead of the green chiles. Can't wait to make this again! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Family absolutely loved this!  I followed the recipe, the only alterations were that I toned down the spicier seasonings to suit our tastes, and added cumin and a couple beef bouillon cubes and a goodly squeeze of lime - Excellent!

I have been making this recipe for years and I make it a few times each year.  Yes, the meat can be spicy - I usually cut down on the hot sauce and the cayenne.  I have also cooked it following instructions and other times, I just throw everything in the crockpot and set it on low and it turns out just fine that way too.  Delicious tacos, enchilada filling, leftovers are great with eggs too...

It was pretty good! I would've added some tomatoes, lettuce, sour cream, and shredded cheese. It had a kick, but not enough to cripple my mouth. All in all, it was a great dish!

I took a few suggestions from others and used this:
Increase chili powder to 1 Tablespoon and add 1 1/2 tsp. of cumin. Add a beef bouillon cube. I did omit the Tabasco sauce for my two young children. I figured I could add it back into mine.

After you shred the beef, use a hand blender or pour liquid into a blender. Blend until smooth. Return beef and liquid to the pot, add 1/2 tsp. of additional cumin and 1 tsp. of paprika. Cook on low for 2 hours. Then, put all of it (including liquid) in a large saute pan over medium heat (no oil) and fry it until all the liquid had evaporated and the meat was slightly browned. 

Meat was perfect. Not too spicy just right. All age levels in my house liked it. 49,19,17,11 and 9.

Made this for a Mexican night with friends and it was a big hit! We have some who don't handle spice well and I thought the heat was just about perfect. I followed the directions exactly and I really think the key is cooking it on low another couple hours after you shred the beef. Will definitely make again!

While I like this recipe, I wish there was a little more flavor to go along with the spiciness.  I did add 1 tsp. of cumin, and, as other reviewers suggested, shredded the meat and then put it back in the sauce for another hour.  Next time I make it (and there will be a next time), I will add 2 tsp. cumin, a lot of fresh garlick, and maybe a touch of ground oregano.  I'm from New Mexico, where green chile is the major crop raised.  Nothing says autumn like the smell of roasting green chile!  It is our state veggie, state fruit, state bird, state song...you get the picture! LOL  What I froze last fall was fairly hot, so I only used 3/4 C.   I used Cholula Hot Sauce.  Can't wait to try it on tacos tomorrow!  Thanks for sharing!

This came out really spicy for us (and we normally like spicy).  It was tasty, though.  Maybe it depends on what hot sauce you use as to how spicy it ends up.

I made this with a 6.5lb pork butt. It was really delicious. Not too spicy for the folks ages 15 to 65 that had dinner with us, but I did not have any chile peppers. I used banana peppers instead. We had it on portuges rolls and flour tortillas. Thanks for sharing.

I would need to make again and follow the recipe exactly before I would be able to say if I liked it or not. I did not have 1 1/4 c. of green chilies, just one small can. Also I did not have the hot pepper sauce so added 1/2 cup Herdez hot sauce and 3 home grown jalapeno peppers. I did only 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper. I also added beef bouillon and more salt. It turned out tasty, but as I said I did not follow the recipe exactly.

Delicious!!  this was served on Super bowl Sunday, in tacos and burritos...made this recipe as written, but, followed the changes suggested by "Impish" (most helpfuI positive review).. made this the day before, so the flavors and spices had time to 'marry'...everyone loved this, even my picky 9 year old grandson..Husband said this is better than any Mexican shredded beef at a restaurant, and all have agreed that this recipe is a keeper!

I used a pork loin instead of chuck roast, it was excellent!!! The only thing I did not do was sear it before putting it into the crock pot because I didn't' have time. We made soft tacos out of them then I used the leftovers to make pork and cheese quesadillas for a Super Bowl party. Everyone loved them!

We liked it but didn't love it.  4lb chuck roast is very expensive at $25 and I used about 3oz. of Tabasco which was plenty hot without a lot of depth of flavor.  Maybe a more Mexican hot sauce is the way to go.  I freezed the leftovers and will try cooking it down in the sauce next time we do beef tacos.  Cooking for 4 hours before shredding and 2 additional hours thereafter seemed like good advice from others and worked well.

It didn't come out as tasty as I expected so I added some hot salsa and let it simmer for 20 minutes after it cooked in the slow cooker.  My family devoured it so that's all that matters!

I made this twice, the first time per the recipe, I give it 3 stars that way. I personally liked it but I was the only one.  The second time I made it in the pressure cooker with beef stew chunks. I added tomatoes, tomatillos, bell pepper,jalapeños,onion and the seasoning with the beef and a bouillon cube to the pressure cooker. Once done and after cooking, I threw everything in food processor. I made enchiladas and they were such a hit. EVERYONE went back for seconds and thirds!   I think you could just add whatever vegetables you prefer. I did have to drain the juice off before making enchiladas but I put the juice in the freezer to make again very soon! 
I TRULLY apologize for changing it so much but I think this is an easy recipe to personalize and it's a very good recipe,

This is a good recipe. It has just enough kick and flavor without the heat being overbearing. 
 I always tweak most of the recipes I come across.. I added 1/2 tsp. Cumin and 1/2 tsp. Coriander and instead of using water I used a beer I had in the fridge for liquid...and for my hot sauce I used Tabasco's smoked chipotle sauce. 
I turned the pork at least once an hour and towards the end I ladled off about two cups of excess liquid.
I'm very glad I tried this recipe out!

Tweaked a few things but it turned out well! I used a frozen 3 lb chuck roast. I added a tsp or two of cumin and extra Mexican  hot chili powder in place of regular chili powder. I omitted the salt due to the salt in hot sauce. Also, I did not use the beef bouillon as suggested due to the added salt. I cooked on high for 5 hours, then shredded the meat and cooked on low for an hour or so more. It wasn't amazing but I would definitely make it again!

Me and my family loved it they were talking about it the next day and I've made it twice now. Very authentic taste i changed two  things I didn't add pepper sauce , flavor was already great and spicy and i doubled the recipe the second time I made it. Definitely a keeper. Thanks Charley.

Recipe was easy and it was very good. I love spicy food and depending on the hot sauce you use, you can make it as mild or as hot as you want.  Once the meat was tender, I shredded it and still kept cooking it on low for another two hours so the meat can absorb all that juice.  Meat was tasty and tender after. I've made machaca and tacos so far with it.

I've made this several times. Always with pork and it's been a hit. What I like to do is throw the pork in a pan after it cooks to brown it...  Then toast a corn tortilla over the grill or my stove top and build the taco with that. Tastes just like the tacos from our local fine Mexican taqueria.

Love this stuff!! My husband cant get barbacoa in South Dakota and being from Texas, he craves it often! He says it tastes similar although its not cow cheek! We wrap this stuff up in tortillas ( we prefer corn) and top them off with pico de gallo and queso fresco !  When the family knows I'm making a batch of this, they're knocking on the door!  We also add cumin and beef bouillon.

I made this the first time as its listed here, and my rating is based on that. This is a great base to start with, but for me it came out a bit spicy (which I like) and not as flavorful as I had hoped. I've found the key to this recipe is the hot sauce you use. First time was made with a La Victoria mild red sauce and it wound up with a mild taste as well. I've read others using Tapatio, personally I think that would come out way too spicy. Whats worked best for me is to use a bottle of Cholula Chili Garlic, and to leave out the garlic powder. And you can use the green chile peppers to adjust the heat as desired, use mild ones for mild, hot for hot, etc. I also add a cube of beef broth, I'm pretty happy with the way it comes out making it with these tweaks.

I followed close to Impish's changes, but also added cilantro, oregano, and lime juice alongside the final addition of cumin & paprika. But, I didn't add any hotsauces, since I'm pretty sensitive to super spicy stuff.

It came out absolutely perfect! If the regular recipe is too hot, omit the hotsauce.

Used 2oz Texas pete instead of 5 and adjusted other hot spices accordingly.  Served as taco meat with Lettuce, Tomato, onion sour cream and grated cheddar. Messy but good. If i knew how to fold burritos it would have been perfect.

After 4 tries I have been able to create both the young and restless (close to exact recipe) and the Old Geezer version reducing the quantity of spices and forgetting  the cayenne. Now trying  vacuum seal smaller portions and freeze them and grab them for a night we are busy using the sous vide method. We'll see if it works.

Was good- I used half the cut of beef and halved all of rest (except for the chili powder by accident). Had good flavor however  we did not think it was super hot by any means. Next time I will use just enough water to cover the bottom as mine was very soupy and had to use a slotted spoon to get the meat out. Thanks for sharing recipe, I will be using this again!  My husband even said the meat would make a good hoagie. (:

Wow, hubby and I loved this!  It was so flavorful and not too hot for us. I did reduce the hot sauce some (I used Frank's) because I was afraid it would be too hot, but it wasn't. I'll use more next time.   Didn't brown the meat but otherwise followed the recipe as stated.  So good, thanks for sharing!

Delish!!! I like spices but not heat so did not do the 5 oz of hot sauce and it was a little warm with lots of flavor since I did everything else exactly same.A coworker of my husband's gave us wild pig meat and it just fell to pieces. I will make this again.

This has become an instant favorite. I've read a few reviews that said the heat was just too much and ruined the meal, to that I can only say, have common sense and adjust the receipt to your own taste and tolerance. This made perhaps the best shredded beef burrito I've had, no exaggeration.

Very tasty. I noticed a lot of reviews talked about how hot this recipe is and I agree I don't like heat for heats sake. It has to add flavor. However when you are picking ingredients for this you have to consider what you are buying. I think the chilis can be hot if you are not careful to get mild. Also the hot sauce you pick will make a huge difference. I love Red Hot sauce and so that is what I used, but I cannot imagine using the same amount of tobasco or some other really hot sauce. I did change the amount of cayenne pepper too because I don't like so much heat so I halved the cayenne pepper.

Loved this recipe. I've followed the recipe exactly and it turned out very well. I used cholula for the hot pepper sauce. As written, the recipe was  definitely on the spicy side for me and  and our  6 year old. Hubby who is Mexican and likes it very spice thought it was perfect. I've used half the amount of cayenne pepper and it was definitely as tasty without being as spicy hot. I've also used chicken instead of beef which was excellent. Our new go to recipe for burritos and tacos.

I made this exactly how "impish" said to do on his review and omg what a success! We had this for leftovers too for a few days and each day was amazing! It smells amazing in the house while it cooks and tempts you to keep poking at it to grab a few bites. This will be become a staple in our home. Thanks!

Fantastic recipe. My husband and I have only truly begun appreciating spicy food so we used 2 Tbs of Sriracha sauce, 1 tsp of cayenne, half a Scotch bonnet - deseeded, 1 long red chilli, 1 short red bullet chilli, 3 medium capsicums (bell pepper) deseeded, 2 medium carrots - diced and cooked for the suggested length, we removed the meat from the broth, removed the capsicum, chilli, onion mix from the broth and returned the meat and left to cook for another 1.5 hours on low with the lid off.

After the mixture had thickened to a sauce like consistency we returned the capsicum, chilli and onion mix to the shredded meat and stirred.

Enjoy on fresh buttered bread. Yum.

Great recipe! I did follow suggestions from other reviewers and added  cumin and a bit more chili powder. I wasn't exactly sure what kind of pepper to use for "green chile pepper" but I went with poblano peppers.  After cooking on high for 6 hours I took the beef out and shredded it and cooked it on low for 2 or 3 more hours. The flavor was great and it was just the right level of spiciness for me (too hot for my son).  I followed Charley's note and simmered the meat in some of the liquid to make beef burritos.  The recipe made 8 large burritos so filling that only 1 out of the 4 of us could eat a 2nd one.  (I added avocado,  shredded mexican cheese and chopped jalapenos to half of them for the 2 people who like VERY spicy.)  I will definitely make this again. Thanks for a great recipe Charley!!

I have made this both with beef and with pork. With the beef I used beef broth, and the pork I used chicken broth instead of water. I used one small can of green chiles, 2 oz of hot sauce, 1 tsp of cayenne pepper, 1 tsp chili, 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp garlic, and salt and pepper. I don't cook the meat beforehand on the stove. I just put it straight in the slow cooker. Season it, put the onions on top, and then the broth. Cook it high for 5 hours, and then low for 2-3 hours. If I have more time I let it cook on low a bit longer. It is so good with either meat. Will definitely be making often.

This was very tasty, but you definitely want to fry it in a pan with sauce or let it simmer in the crock pot after it's been shredded before eating to get the sauce and seasoning distributed to all the meat.

We made this and used it in chimichangas from the advice of another reviewer and they were incredible!  Put a little meat, a little cheese, and a little refried beans in a tortilla shell and deep fry.  Thanks!

I loved this recipe! I followed the directions with the exception of using siracha instead of hot sauce because that's what I had on hand. Before putting it in the tortilla I crisped it up in a  skillet. It was great having those crispy bits. I will make again and have actually passed this recipe on to other family members. Enjoy!

I have made this recipe MANY times and it is excellent as written.  I've made it with both chicken and beef and it's perfect as described for soft or crisp tacos, especially using fresh sliced avocado, sour cream and homemade corn tortillas (ask a mexican food restaurant if they make their own.)  I strongly agree with another reviewer that shredding the meat then returning to the pot to soak up the juices helps make it wonderfully flavorful.

Too much spice, not enough flavor. Meat came out tender but I had to end up adding seasoning.

I love the flavor of this meat. I did make it just as the recipe said though I cut everything in half since I had a 2 lb roast. It is a little too spicy for me and I will probably cut back on the hot sauce and cayenne next time, however it is not SO hot that I cannot eat it and my boyfriend thinks it is just right.

I make this all the time. And I make it exactly like the recipe except I cut back on the cayenne pepper. You just have to adjust the cayenne and hot sauce to your individual tastes and the flavored all together are awesome. My family always asks me to make it. It's delicious.

I gave 4 starts b/c the recipe needed some tweaking because it was far too spicy.  I used this recipe, but altered it for my taste as I don't like it so spicy. Also instead of using a roast, I used beef short ribs (3-4 lbs). If you use the roast, cut it into large chunks to give the meat a chance to absorb the first flavor completely. After shredding, add the meat back to the slow cooker with fluid to allow the meat to absorb flavor.  It turned out perfectly.

Ingredients I used: chili powder, garlic powder, tomatillo-lime skillet sauce (or salsa), onion, used beef broth instead of water.

I've made this a few times and my husband loves it! I do not put in the hot spices cause my husband doesn't like spicy food, so I use  mild chunky salsa instead. I also put in beef broth and the diced green chillies.  It makes enough to have for a couple of meals.

This roast turned out amazing, it was extremely tender and had a little spice to it. I cooked mine on low for about 10 hrs because I wasn't home to cook on high and then switch to low and it turned out perfectly!

Great recipe! I added fresh garlic. I used beef broth versus water. I used kosher salt instead of table salt, and I added a bay leaf to the pot. I also reduced the amount of hot sauce to around 3 oz. and I only gave it a dash of cayenne. Yummy with a tolerable heat!

This is yummy!  I made a few changes and made 8 lbs for a potluck, there was not speck left!  I cut the green chilis to 2 cans, only added 1 teaspoon of hot sauce and added a teaspoon of cumin to the other spices.  Stays nice and moist in the juices.

Excellent! I didn't have hot pepper sauce or cayenne pepper, so it was omitted, but the result was still really good. I only needed to keep it in my slow cooker 5-6 hours total on high for it to be soft and falling apart. I also did not brown it first before putting it in the slow cooker.

Amazing! Just delicious was perfect and i hardly had to do anything. I followed all the ingredients except i waited until the meat was fully cooked then I shredded it put everything back in the cooker. Thats when i added my onions also added some fresh cilantro and 1 lime. It was perfect. I will be making the often.

This is a great recipe...my husband is on a gluten free diet, but can eat tacos with a corn shell...he needed a change of the usual ground beef taco meat. I found this and it was definately a winner in our house.

Very good. However I have to say if you are planning on making this and don't handle spice well, delifinately cut back on the hot sauce & cayenne pepper. My husband & I both love spice food. We found it to be spicy and I used less hot sauce than the recipe called for.

Delicious.  The g/f says this comes out pretty spicy, so watch that if your audience is mild in pallet, other than that it's good to go as written.

Excellent recipe! This has been added to my favorites file. I add lots of cumin and some liquid smoke for extra flavoring. We fry up corn tortillas and serve the beef on them.

Used whole, dried poblano peppers for the diced peppers, a Vietnamese chili sauce for the hot sauce, and did not brown the meat nor trim the fat at the beginning.  Just cut out the lumps of fat before shredding.  Heaven!

So easy, flavorful, and delicious. I used Tapatio Mexican hot sauce, used a can of tomatoes w/ chiles in place of just the water, and beef brisket.  First time making a big cut of meat in the slow cooker. It turned out great. Since i used tomatoes, the flavor was even better the next day. Made tacos and beef enchiladas but I could see how making a spicy beef sandwich on crusty bread would be a great idea. Highly recommend.

I made a few mistakes with mine the first time around. I didn't plan well enough for the cooking time so when the coocking was done around 9:00pm - I let it sit overnight and because I had to work the next day I had to leave it in the fridge all day. When I cam homw, we shredded it because I also had to devide it up because it is too much for 2 people (I froze a bunch) so I think I made more work for myself. That being said, the meat was tender, and the flavors were really good. I will try again (after using what I froze) and see if I can save myself a little work.

This was absolutely awesome!  I put in only 1/2 bottle of hot sauce instead of whole bottle.  The first night it was sooooo good in warm tortilla with  black beans and cheese.  It wasn't as good warmed up the next day- it lost some of it's heat.  It was so easy to make too.  You could put it in crock pot before you go to work and it is ready when you get home.

I cooked on high for 5 hours, then removed meat and added flour mixed with juice until consistency of gravy. I shredded meat and added back to pot and cooked for an additional 2 hours. YUM!!! Divine. Definitely a keeper

Really easy.  I added half a beef bouillon cube & 1 c. water to cover the meat.  4 lb. of beef made 3 meals for our family of 3.  Highly recommend.

I put a chuck roast in the crock pot and cooked it on low all night.  I didn't have chili peppers so I used green salsa and added 1 tsp cumin.  I put it in the refrigerator the next day.  We fixed beef nachos the first night - awesome.  Just the right amount of spice.  The second night I made a vegetable beef soup in the crock pot.  Definitely a keeper!

I've made this several times and always love it.  Made this with venison tonight.  Tasted great.  Had to add extra broth to the slow cooker because of the lean cut of meat.  I'll be using this recipe for venison more often.

This was wonderful! I really, really do not like chuck roast normally, and we have several left in the freezer from a side of beef we bought.  The chuck roasts are always the last thing I use.  Not anymore!  I followed the recipe except added a little less hot sauce, probably closer to 3 oz., and it was just right for us.  Not super spicy so the full 5 oz. probably would have been okay too.  We had it in tortillas the first night, put some in the freezer, and tonight we'll be having wet burritos made with this and the Refried Beans without the Refry (also good and easy) from this site.  This will be a definite keeper for me, and I finally have something to do with all of those chuck roasts!

I love spice...this actually needed a bit more for my taste. I made it spec per the recipe but next time will likely double the spices required. I didnt want to overdue it the first time. I added 2 japenos - one seeded - as well. Also added 2 tbsp chopped garlic in addition to the garlic powder because I love garlic flavor! I followed the advice of some posters - coated the chuck roast  in seasoned flour and browned in peanut oil before adding to the slow cooker. Additional on 1 tbsp of paprika and 1 tbsp of ground cumin. Im thinking I will add some tomato paste next time as well, the sauce was too thin. Otherwise..excellent. The beef was super soft and tender, moist and able to be cut with a spoon. I have used it in chimichangas and hard tacos so far and just froze alot to be used as needed.

This was pretty good. It was definitely not as hot and spicy as I was expecting. I used about a 3 pound roast and did not brown the meat because I ran out of time. I used all of the spice amounts given by the recipe even with the slightly smaller piece of meat. The meat had a good flavor to it but it just did now pack the punch I was expecting. We served it with small fresh flour tortillas with a bit of cheese, sour cream, and avocado with black beans and rice on the side.

This is my husband's absolute favorite food of all time.  I followed the recipe and only made two changes; I upped the cayenne pepper to 1 teaspoon (we like HOT)and added 1 8oz can of tomato sauce. I used Tabasco's Chipotle sauce and used stew meat in the crock pot on low all day.  What a treat! Thanks, Charley!

I liked this dish.  I would do it differently next time.  I didn't add quite as much hot sauce as the recipe suggested, but added too much for my taste.  I came home at lunch and tested it and it was burning my mouth.  I still wanted it to work, so I drained all the water that was in the crock pot and added new with some lighter seasoning.  It worked.  When I came home, I shredded up the beef and added it back to the liquid without the vegetables.  It turned out very tender and juicy.  So, I recommend it, but if you're worried about the spiciness, just put less of the hot sauce!  I will say that I think the flavors could be a bit more layered - it's a one-dimensional spice rather than a complex spice.  But overall - quite good!

Awesome, mouth-watering, meat. I didn't use as much hot sauce but we didn't need it. It was quite good as a filler for tamales and we froze some of it for tacos later-- just as good, if not better. Thanks for posting!

I have made this several times now! Everyone loves it. For the hot sauce, I use Tapatio. I learned that the sooner you shred the meat and let it slow cook for several hours, the hotter the meat will be. I have also used this recipe on chicken for taquitos and it works perfect! Thanks for the great recipe!

To shorten the time cut the meat into 3 or 4 chunks and brown. This  cuts the cooking time by 3-4 hours

Followed directions exactly scaled for a 2.5lb roast. The liquid mixture was spicy but unfortunately the flavor didnt make it to the meat itself. I tried to add "the juice" to our soft tacos to flavor the meat but it just made the shell soggy and the meal very messy. Wish it was better!

I couldn't have enjoyed this meat more. I am a big fan of spicy food and I have to say that this dish was great. The meat was so good that my extremely picky sitter and brother-in-law said so (that rarely happens).

This was delicious! I used a moose roast and what is normally gamey, wasn't at all. I'm convinved you could cook an old shoe with this recipe and it would be wonderful.

followed advice and added cumin (i mean, really, "mexican style meat" without cumin?) and beef bullion. i didn't have 1 and 1/4 of chilies, but it was fine with the 1/2 c i did have, and i didn't add the whole bottle of hot sauce. i added some jalepeno, though. there was plenty of flavor and heat without the heat being overpowering. i also removed the onions and peppers at the end, shredded the meat, and let it cook in the juice for a bit longer. my mexican husband adored this dish.

This recipe is so good. I do make a few changes though. I don't put the cayenne pepper or hot sauce in because it would be too hot for my family. Also, I prefer to roast fresh Anaheim chiles on the stove first and then dice and add to the recipe. We also prepare extra batches and freeze them (uncooked). When we're ready to cook, we just put in the crock pot on low (even frozen) until the meat falls apart. I usually buy cross-rib steaks for this recipe.

Excellent and so easy.  I omitted the cayenne, used 3 pressed cloves of garlic, 1/2 tsp. cumin, and only 6 T. of Louisiana hot sauce.  It comes out spicy but not overly so.  I actually think this tastes better the second day, and it freezes beautifully.  Oh, I also used the McCormick Montreal Steak Seasoning instead of the salt and pepper since that is basically coarsely ground salt, pepper, and garlic.

I used this recipe for enchiladas and WOW! They were the best I ever had. The perfect balance of spices. It's as if it came straight out of an authentic mexican restaurant. This will be made in my home for now on. Looking forward to using the rest on burritos. Great recipe! Thanks.

This is the BEST mexican meat i've ever made!! The only thing I do different is leave out the cayenne since hubby and I don't like things too too hot. It's perfect! I make this meat at least 3 times a month.

Great base recipe Charley!!!  My boys ask for this recipe often, and can be adapted to what you have on hand.. I also put it all in my pressure cooker, it speeds things along.  Great for burritos, soft tacos or salads.

Yummy! This was real good. I used the meat for taquitos for a party and everyone was raving. I also made burritos with the meat another time and added black beans in my burritos with the cheese/sour cream/guacomole. IT WAS AWESOME!

FANTASTIC!  We are big fans of Mexican food and this was great. My husband was very impressed - I was almost embarrassed to tell him how simple it was to make.
Don't worry about it being too spicy- from the list of ingredients it appearts it would have quite a kick ... but much of it cooked out and it was a mild spice that pleased all!
Thanks Charley!

I'm back to get this recipe for the 2nd time. Previously, I used extra cumin, 1 can diced green chilis, beef broth and 1/2 a boullion cube, and a can of chipotle peppers in ancho sauce. The peppers were whole, so when I pulled the beef out to shred it I threw out the peppers (I'm a wimp and was afraid it would be too spicey). I did not brown the meat first. It turned out amazing!! Right out of the pot it tasted great, but I was afraid it was too hot for myself and I'd have to give it all to my boyfriend (who thinks I never make food spicey enough). After adding salsa, sour cream, guacamole, lettuce and cheese in a burrito shell, it was perfect. Spicey enough for him, yet evened out enough for me.

Like many others I modified the recipe for what I had on hand and WOW was this fabulous.  My husband and I eat mexican regularly and I know he is going to looooooove it.  I enjoyed it with rice and used some of the excess liquid on top... mmmm mmmm good.  Everyone should try this at least once, I imagine this will be a standard at my house.

This recipe was fantastic! I used less hot sauce to bring the spice down slightly. Overall this is an awesome recipe! Will definitely make again! Thanks!

We love this recipe and have used it again and again.  I have made a few variations of it, mostly with the tabasco sauce (it can be a bit strong...) Otherwise a GREAT recipe!

This was very good.  I expected it to be very spicy and it was but not so hot that my kids and reflux ridden husband could not enjoy it.  We loved it.

Sooooo GOOD!I made killer burritos with this recipe. I made them with black beans and yellow rice inside. I halved all the spices in the recipe because my meat was only 2 lbs...next time I won't. I wanted it spicier.

I think my mouth is still on fire from a couple nights ago. Whoo, hot!! I used a can of chili's instead of fresh, 3 oz of Quaker steak hot sauce instead of 5 oz, and added 2 tsps of cumin. I cooked on high for 4 hours, removed the chili's and onion, and shredded the meat before returning it to the pot to cook on low for another 2hours. I left some out for the kids at the 4 hour mark and it was fine for the, not too spicy at that point. I will make this again but might use mild instead of hot. Thanks!!

Great flavor!  I used this meat to make enchiladas that were out of this world!  I added no water, and it was still extremely watery.  As with other reviewers, I put it on the stove to reduce the liquid.  Very spicy!

Big hit for my husband and his friends on game day.  Used shaved thin steak instead and cooked on high one hour, low one hour.  They put it iona sandwhich with cheese and alos made burritos.  Easy and delicious.  Thanks!

Very good. I used 3 cans of diced green chiles and 1 5 oz. bottle of Chipotle Tabasco, other than that I followed the recipe. The meat had a nice spice to it, but not at all as spicy as I expected. In the future I would probably add less water and try different flavors of hot sauce. My husband loved it; I think he had four helpings, so I will definitely make it again.

I thought this was very good, although we cut back on the hot sauce and it was still plenty spicy, and better reheated than when it first came out of the slow cooker. My wife didn't like it at all, though.

This turned out pretty well.  I tried to follow the recipe, but had to make a few changes: didn't add the water because in my experience, it makes pot roast dry.  Also, used canned green chiles just to be quick so this created a fair amount of liquid on it's own.  Lastly, I couldn't cook it on high for the time suggested so cooked it on high for two hours and on low for seven hours.  Meat turned out tender and the flavor was good.  Definitely will make it again!

This recipe is great for pork as well.  My family likes spicy food, so after I removed it from the slow cooker and shred it, I add some chili powder, cayenne pepper, salt and pepper then mix it all together. It will keep well in the refrigerator for the next two or three days. I might make burritos one night, and tacos the next.

Very good flavor. I did not add the chayenne pepper and it still turned out a bit too spicy for my husband, I thought they were perfect, my 10 year old loved them and did not say they were spicy. We made them into taco's.

This was yummy and easy. I used 3 peppers and held back on the hot sauce. I think I will use more hot sauce next time as it wasn't as spicy as we like it. I will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe with venison roast and used the same amount of spices the recipe called for. My husband really liked this recipe! My husband loves spicy foods and will usually go to about medium spice on most  meals and said this was a bit too spicy. I think next time we'll only use about 2oz of hot sauce in the recipe to make it less spicy.

I made this last weekend in the crockpot.  I modified it a little to fit our tastes.  I left out the chili peppers and hot sauce and added some ground cumin.  I then mixed all the spices with margarine and coated the chuck roast with it.  Placed it in the crock pot with beef stock and cooked on low for about 8 hours.  Shredded and served with noodles.  FANTASTIC !!!

Extremely spicy as written.  Would definitely cut back on the heat when I try this again.

Loved it!!!!  The flavor in this dish is great.  I cut back on the pepper sauce due to my little girl, and it was still really spicey...good spicey.  The next day and the day after leftovers were awesome.  I will definetly make and remake.

The first time I made this it was way too spicy, but the meat had a good flavor so I tried it again but cut the amount of green chile pepper to 1/2 of a small pepper (about 2 teaspoons) and then doubled the other spices. The meat is good for burritos, tacos, and especially in enchiladas. Thanks for the recipe.

I had high hopes for this dish but was a little disappointed.  It may have been that I did not use a chuck roast.  I made a few changes because I thought it might be too hot. I used a can of chopped tomatoes with green chiles, beef broth and chopped garlic to add some flavor.  I omitted the hot sauce but used extra chili powder and a little bit more cayenne powder than called for in the original.  I mixed all of this together and poured over the meat in the crockpot.  I was in a rush so I did not brown the meat but I do not think this is necessary, as other reviews have stated.  After four and a half hours on high, I turned it down to low and cooked it for another 3 and one half hours.  I than cut up the meat (it wouldn't shred for some reason), put it back in the crock pot and cooked for another two hours, hoping the meat would soak up more of the flavor from the juices in the crockpot.  The meat was good, but not great.  Everyone but the youngest liked it (pretty typical - she thought it was a little too spicy) and asked to have it again.  While I will make it again, I thought the meat could have been a bit more flavorful.  We used it to make soft tacos with shredded cheese, lettuce, tomato, salsa and sour cream and served it with a black bean salad.  I will try it with a chuck roast next time and perhaps that will make a difference.  Good recipe, though.  Thanks.

I used venison for this recipe and it was delicious.  I served them with chopped onion, grated cheddar cheese, sliced black olives and sour cream and ate them as burittos.

Very good, moist and delicious. Also used Texas Pets's hot sauce as others did. Will make again and again. Served with Spanish Rice and Black beans.

This was delish!  I added 2 pablano peppers finely chopped and cumin.  My teenage son had his friends for a taco/sports night and they all said it was the best taco meat they ever tasted.  I used leftovers for burritos.

Nice and spicy and tender.  I did not have time to sear the meat, and I used fresh garlic instead of powdered because that's what I had.  Tossed everything in the slow cooker (mine only has two settings: on and off) and 9 hours later it was perfect.  I would definitely make this again.

Neither my husband or myself enjoyed this much.  To be fair, neither of us like pot roast and the texture of the meat is similar.  The sauce has great flavor, but once the meat is shredded and out of the crock pot, it is rather bland.  We used it for tacos and just were not impressed.  Thank you anyway!

I made enchiladas with chicken I cooked with this recipe and they were great.  Although, I didn't cook the chicken as long as directed.  The flavoring was perfect.

Definitely need to cut the hot sauce.  Way too hot and a little bit on the salty side.  Next time I will use less hot sauce and see how it turns out.  Overall it is worth to try this recipe.

This is one of my favorite recipies I have found.  I have made this twice so far, used it for tacos and enchiladas.  The first time I made it, my husband hid the leftovers in the fridge so no one else would eat it on him.  I found it before he got home from work, so sad for him!  Promised to make it again today and I did, he'll be so happy. Thanks for the great recipe!

Great Recipe! I made this last night and pretty much followed the recipe exactly except I did not use the whole bottle of pepper sauce, I used about 3/4.  I used other suggestions and shredded the roast after about 5 hours, when I did the meat was already so tender it fell apart so we waited another hour 1/2 and served it with home made flour tortillas, pico de gallo and shredded cheese and it was delicious!  My husband ate 4 tacos.  
I am going to use the left over meat today for a burrito pie recipe from this site.

This is a great recipe.  Roast falls apart and the flavor is excellent.  I use it leftover for lots of different things.  This is just about the only way I cook roast now.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I was going to rate this and say it was way too hot, but then my two year old son loved it (although he said his mouth was hot)!  The sauce really doesn't get to the inside of the roast at all when cooking, you must drench the shredded beef with the sauce or there is no spicy flavor on the inside.  We made burritos with lots of sour cream.  Pretty good, I will probably make it again.

I made this mostly for my husband, cuz he loves this kind of stuff.  I asked him to rate it from 1-5.  He gave it a 5!  Very spicey, but very good!....we of course used a slotted spoon.  Looking forward to the leftovers which there is plenty of.  I used half water and half beef broth.

Don't be intimidated by amount of hot sauce or chilis, it turns out to be just right if not a little mild hotness wise. I found that there was a lot of juice when it was done so I used a slotted spoon to scoop meat out into a serving dish. Great recipe for shredded beef for tacos!

UPDATE: Reduced rating to 2 stars. leftovers were not good. Won't make again. 

Decent, not great. May or may not make again. I added some diced tomatoes to add a little flavor. I also used beef broth in place of water. I used a little less chili powder and hot sauce to tone down the burn. The leftovers were decent, but not great. I think I may keep looking for a great mexican shredded beef recipe.

This made great pulled beef that was good in burritos and just to eat it on it's own!  The onions were wonderful after soaking up the flavors all day.  I used a hot sauce that had some lime in it, so maybe that was a flavor that some other reviewers were missing.  Or perhaps some cilantro.  I had nothing to change though!  Great recipe!

This was good, not outstanding.  After reading other reviews, I cut back on the pepper sauce, and it was still spicy, just not much other flavor.  I added several beef boullion cubes in the water and a little wine vinegar.  The meat was tender and easy to shred, ust seemed to be needing  a little something.

I didn't find the flavor to be as terrific as I expected.  I will try again with some modification.

This recipe was very easy to make.  I had to tame it down a little for my boys, but it was still very good. We used it in burritos and it was a nice change from hanmbuger meat.

I really liked the spiciness.  Just right for me.  I put too much water in but it still came out great!
