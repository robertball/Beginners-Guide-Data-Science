Well, I give it five stars only after making some revisions.  I read the other reviews about it being too dry, and made some changes first--so I can't comment on what the actual recipe tastes like.  I sauteed 8 oz. fresh sliced mushrooms and one chopped onion in 4 tablespoons of butter.  I seasoned this mixture with garlic salt, salt, and pepper.  I added two cans of cream of mushroom soup, and two cups of sour cream to give it a creamier consistency.  I also seasoned the turkey with seasoning salt, garlic salt, and pepper.  I combined all of the ingredients, and added about one cup of cheddar cheese.  I also reduced the temperature because it seemed a little high.  I baked it at 350 for 30 minutes and it came out very good.

This was surprisingly good, much better than I expected.  I don't generally like casseroles, tetrazzinis, or especially anything with canned soup as an ingredient.  However, I had to use up a ton of dryed out leftover turkey from Thanksgiving and my boyfriend likes hamburger helper style meals so I figured I would try this out.  Yum!  And it was so easy.  I did saute half a large onion and a couple cloves of garlic before adding the mushroom, and I added a splash of milk to the sauce because it looked pretty thick, but other than that I did everything by the recipe.  I will definitely make this again and for anyone who can't decide whether or not to make this, give it a try!  You may be surprised like I was.  I think next time I will add some steamed broccoli and fresh mushrooms to this.  You can customize it any way you want to.

I thought this would be a fine way to use some leftover turkey and it actually turned out much better than I anticipated!  I really liked it!  I did use the cream of celery soup and I'm glad because it added a great flavor.  I only used 1/2 tsp of salt and it was still plenty salty.  This is a keeper!

After following alot of the suggestions, I made this and it was so good!  I browned onions and garlic in the butter before adding the mushrooms and I also doubled the soup and sour cream.  My hubby loved it and so did I.  I can't imagine making it without doubling the soup and sour cream.  It wasn't over-moist as it was.

Good basic recipe, however, for our tastes, it needed more seasonings. I also added a can of evaporated skim milk to make it creamier. Definite comfort food!

Thanks Holly for a tasty way to get leftovers out of the house.  Based on the previous reviews, I revised the recipe ever so slightly. :)

In a nutshell, I used regular pasta since I was out of egg noodles.  It worked fine.  Secondly, I added some leftover whipping cream instead of water to counteract the dryness that some reviewers mentioned.  Last, I added leftover peas (a three pea dish with pearl onions) instead of using the mushrooms.  Next time, I think I would mix part of the cheese with the turkey mixture instead of putting it all on top, but all in all, this recipe was a hit (even with my ever finicky 4 year old).  One last thing worth mentioning:  if you like a lot of spice in your food, add some garlic, and a couple of tsps of all purpose seasoning/cuming/spice of your choice to complement the veggie used.

I did many of the easy changes recommended previously.  Sauteed some onions, added some garlic powder and 1/2 can milk, mixed the noodles in with the sauce and lowered the temp to 350.  I sprinkled some french fried onions on top and I think that was really what clinched it for my family!

Delicious!  The addition of sliced fresh mushrooms and half a chopped onion sauted, with crushed garlic at the end of sauteing was excellent.  I also added 2 tablespoons of sherry into the sauce mixture.  We loved it!

This recipe is good and easy, plus I am always a fan of casseroles.  I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of celery.  Also, I didn't have enough sour cream so I used about 1/4 cup of heavy cream.  It was good, but somewhat bland.  Next time I am going to saute an onion with the mushrooms.

I made this recipe after reading the other reviews, and added a can of water to the sauce mix. My teenage son and husband LOVED it. It is perfect for left over Turkey.

I give this 5 stars after my slight changes. As recommended by others, I sauted some  mushrooms (i only had a jar on hand) and onions in 4Tbs butter seasoned with garlic salt & pepper. . I used 1 can condensed cream of chicken soup & 1 can condensed cream of celery soup.Then mixed in a 16oz container of sour cream. 2 C diced turkey. I also used cellentani (corkscrew) pasta.  Mixed sauce & pasta put in baking dish & sprinkled bread crumbs & parmesan cheese. Baked 30min on 350. Turned out great! Next time will add frozen peas  (just because I like them!)

Nice alternative to pot pie or shepherds pie, though all cream casseroles begin to taste the same.  Increased to 9 servings to accommodate the 3C turkey I had.  Used 1 can each cream of celery and cream of mushroom soup, plus 1/2 can of pasta water and 2C sour cream.  Sauteed small onion, then added 8 oz sliced fresh mushrooms, 2 cloves garlic and 1 shallot with salt, pepper, a little garlic salt and some celery seed, which really made the flavors pop.  Mixed with 12 oz whole grain thin egg noodles and ~1C french fried onions, then baked for 30 min total at 350, adding ~1.5 C of french fried onions to the top the last 5 minutes - these took the recipe from good to yummy!  Will consider baking covered the first 20 minutes next time as the cheese dried out some, but my husband liked the top crunchy.  This made 2 8X8 casserole dishes, so I can give one to a friend with a new baby!

Incredible!!! Just finished eating this, my boyfriend says it was "one of the best things" he has ever eaten. Used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup instead of celery, cup and a half of sour cream, a little milk, and added a little mozzarella cheese in the mix. Also used FRESH mushrooms and half of a large onion. The result was creamy, cheesy, and delicious! Perfect way to use leftover turkey!

I really enjoyed this recipe. It was easy to make and pretty good. I gave it 4 stars because I made a few changes. I didn't include the mushrooms, but used cream of mushroom soup instead. I used macaroni noodles (all I had on hand). Then I heated the turkey and seasoned with garlic and onion powder, and a sprinle of paprika before mixing everything in. I added some breadcrumbs for topping and baked. My kids had second and third helpings! A keeper, for sure.

Yum. I added fresh garlic while sauteing the mushrooms, threw in a cup of frozen peas, and used cream of mushroom soup. Filling and creamy comfort food. Thanks :)

This was really Good!  Here's what I did differently:  I browned I 1lb of ground turkey with diced onion, green bell pepper, celery and fresh garlic.  I then added ground pepper and celery seed.  I then added 2 cans of soup, cream of celery and cream of chicken with 1 cup of sour cream.  I would have normally added the mushrooms with the other diced veggies but didn't have any.  I then added frozen green peas to mixture.  I placed the cooked whole wheat spaghetti in a 13x9 then poured the soup mixture over it.  Cooked for about 30 min then topped with french fried onions and cooked for about 10 more min, until lightly browned.  Hubby and I both loved this!!

I thought this dish was excellent!  After reading suggestions by others I made the following adjustments:  I sauteed half an onion and 8 oz. of fresh mushrooms along with 1 clove of garlic in 4 T. of butter.  I also mixed in 1 C. of cheddar cheese into the soup mixture (which I doubled, both the soup and the sour cream) before spooning it over the noodles (I used 12 oz).  Then topped the whole thing with a sprikling of cheddar cheese, parmesan cheese and bread crumbs.  It really turned out yummy.  Reminiscent of a favorite dish of mine at a local restaurant.  Now I won't have to go out!

I used cream of mushroom (healthy request) soup and omitted the mushrooms to please the kids.  I also added almost a cup of frozen baby peas, half a chopped onion, a clove of garlic, and a half can of low sodium chicken broth. We thought it was great made this way.  I gave it a four because I think it would have been dry and salty without the changes.

This did come out dry.  The egg noodles soak up a lot of liquid.  I think if I try it again I will add a half can of water to the soup mix.

This was a great recipe for leftover holiday turkey.  I did a cup of diced mushrooms, half a cup or so of diced onion.  For the sauce I used one can cream of mushroom, one can cream of celery and one cup sour cream.  After it was all heated and mixed with the pasta I cooked it at 350 for 30 minutes covered with foil. Then I uncovered, turned off the oven and topped with cheese.  I then put it back in the oven while I got the rest of dinner done.  It was a great meal, very simple and easy.  I'll try it again with peas or broccoli added.  Maybe top with bread crumbs or crushed crutons.

Nice easy recipe that tastes good. I changed things around a bit. I used 1 can of cream of celery soup, 1 can of cream of chicken, and 1 cup of sour cream. Along with the mushrooms, I sauteed a small onion and half a bag of frozen diced green pepper, and put it all on a bed of angel hair pasta. I covered the top with french fried onions and it came out delicious! I think adding the green pepper and the fried onions added a LOT of flavor.

I really like this recipe. Based on reviews, I decided to use 6 oz. of noodles instead of 8 oz. so it would be a better sauce to noodle ratio and I used Hodgson Mill whole wheat fettuccine instead of egg noodles, I definitely think this was a great change. I did use canned mushrooms like the recipe said to use but next time I will sautee fresh murhrooms with onions instead. I also only used one TB. of butter while I sauteed the green onions (fresh from the garden!!) with the canned portabello mushrooms and minced garlic. The only other change I made was cream of chicken (all I had in pantry!) and added steamed broccoli just because it needed to be used and a little fat free half and half (milk would work the same but I had it in the fridge) because of the reviews that it was a little dry. I cooked this at 350 instead of 375 for 30 minutes and it was perfect. I will definitely make this again. FYI: The leftovers were suprisingly yummy the next day heated in the microwave!!

Thought this was a great recipe for turkey leftovers.  I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup after reading the reviews.  I also sauteed some chopped onion and garlic with the mushrooms.  I added about 1/2 cup of a mixture of shredded monterey jack and mozzarella cheese when I mixed with the noodles.  I then sprinkled 1/2 cup additional cheese over the top before it baked.  My family enjoyed it, and the leftovers were great for lunch.

This was very good for leftover turkey breast!  I used white wine while cooking turkey with mushrooms to prevent dryness and to add taste.  It worked very well.  I also added frozen peas and used healthy request low fat cream of mushroom soup and low fat sour cream.  I topped it with low fat cheddar cheese and parm.  It was really good!

This turned out well for me.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and added half a cup of milk.  Next time I will add an entire cup.  I also used fresh mushrooms and sauteed those with half an onion.  I also used Nature's Seasons and some extra pepper.  Good comfort food.

This is a super easy recipe. 
I added a can of chicken broth to make it more juicy and I didn't have any mushrooms at hand so I used a celery stalk and a half onion instead and it turned very good.

I did have to modify a few things to suit what I had on hand.  I used spaghetti (broken up into 3" pieces), fresh mushrooms (canned mushrooms are gross!), mushroom soup.  I also added a cup of water (otherwise it would have been too dry).  It was a huge success!

This turned out great.  I used spaghetti, since that's what I had on hand.  I substituted cream of chicken for the cream of celery soup.  Based on other reviews, I added about 1/3-1/2 can of water to the soup mixture.  I sauteed some onions, celery and bell pepper and added to the mix. I also added some dried minced garlic and parsley.  I stirred in the Parmesan cheese, rather than sprinkling it on top. I baked it covered with foil, until it started to get good and bubbly.  I then removed the foil and topped with a three-cheddar mixture.  I returned it to the oven, and baked until bubbly in the center. Will definitely make again.

I agree, this recipe was so easy and delicious! I used one can of cream of celery and one can of cream of chicken as well mixed in some sauteed onions and then topped with shredded cheese and  crumbled Cheez-It crackers for some extra crunchiness.

Very good recipe that I will use again if I have leftover Thanksgiving turkey.  I think chicken would taste just as good too.  I added half a can (from the cream of celery) of milk based on other recommendations and didn't have any problems with dryness.  Next time I think I'll cut down on the sour cream b/c I think it would taste just as good if not better with half the amount.

So good.  But as others made modifications. I sauted garlic, leeks, fresh mushrooms, and thinley carrots in the butter. I used 1 can of cream  of celery and 1 can of FF cream of mushroom. Mixed everything together with some left over green beans and stuffing. I also added 1 Tbls. of worshire sauce. Then layered noodles,turkey,noodle,turkey,parm cheese. Next time I think I will add crispy onions like we all use on our green bean casserole. A keeper !!

Great basic recipe, but needs some seasoning.  I sauted 1 tablespoon garlic in the butter then added the soup, turkey, 2 tablespoons onion powder, salt and pepper.  After the mixture had heated I added 3/4 cup parmesan.  Next I mixed in the noodles then the peas last so they dont get mashed.  After putting it in a dish I topped with another 3/4 parmesan and then panko bread crumbs.  After the dish started bubbling (25 min on 350) I broiled for just 3 min or so to brown the top.  Suprisingly, my hubs who hates peas even ate it.  Don't be afraid of the salt on this one.  I used more than I normally do.  Pretty good recipe for leftovers and easy

This was a fast and easy way to use leftover turkey.  Had everything on hand, and even added some leftover broccoli too.  Also used whole wheat rigatoni...really think any pasta would work.  Everyone in the family loved it and wanted seconds.

This was very good, especially the next day. I did make the following substitutions. On a few people saying it was dry, I used two cans of 98% fat free cream of soups (one celery, one chicken). I also added some peas to get more veggies in. And I replaced the sour cream with 4 laughing cow wedges diced. This made the recipe a bit more diet friendly.

As Is this is a "good starting point" but it did not get 5 stars as (like most of the other posters) I had to do some doctoring. I only give 5 if I love it As Is. This is too heavy and too bland As Is. With a few changes however it is very "improveable".  Without changes it is too thick (not creamy..."gloppy") with undiluted condensed soup and sour cream: I added 1/4 of milk to thin it down to "creamy". I used cream of mushroom soup since my kids don't like 'shrooms and I can hide them in tiny bits that way...but this does not change the flavor. I think any canned cream soup is going to work about the same (celery, chicken, 'shroom etc) as a base. My big issue (thickness aside) is that it is too bland. Since I had my shrooms in the cream base I sauted onions and celery in the butter. Increased the salt and pepper from 1/8 t0 1/4 tsp. Tasted, still a little bland...added 1/8 tsp of onion powder and gralic powder. NOW it is something that will pour instead of PLOP over the noodles and has some flavor.(I also added baby peas just because my kids love peas and it makes it healther with the added veggies.......but that is personal preferance/does not affect the flavor).

This casserole was pretty good and mainly used what I had in the house. I had a 4 oz package of fresh mushrooms and sautéed those. I also added a cup and a half of cooked mixed vegetables. I used chicken, cooked in a little broth, instead of turkey and an Amish style egg noodle. It doesn't make a ton, as it will all fit in a 9x9 pan. I don't have a crowd to feed anyway. ty

Yummy!!!  I made some of the changes others had mentioned...sautéed a little onion and garlic before adding the mushrooms.  Used the leftover gravy from the turkey dinner as part of the liquid and basically doubled the liquid...added some frozen peas and will try broccoli next time...added a little bread crumbs to the parm on top for a little extra crunch.  Oh and used rotini pasta because I like the way it holds up. Now my husband wants me to cook another turkey just so we can have leftovers to make this again!

My family loved this recipe and my hubby is not a casserole person. I am giving this 5 stars because it is a great base to start with and be creative. I read the other reviews and instead of doubling the soup and sour cream, I just added two cups of milk. I sauted 1 cup of fresh mushroom (I didn't have canned), 1 cup of diced celery and mushroom soup since I didn't have celery soup, 1 small white onion, and one clove of garlic. I used the grated parmesan and also the french fried onion on top. It was great.

This was the best dish I've ever fixed with left over Turkey. Did as first review added extra can of cream of mushroom soup, seasoned the creme mixture with onion powder and garlic powder. Baked at 350 for 30 minutes. Oh yeah added sharp cheddar as opposed to the parmesan cheese.

I loved this recipe for so many reasons!  It is very versatile and easily customized to your tastes.  It is very quick, easy and flavorful.  I added some crushed diced garlic clove, used Cream of Mushroom soup as I was out of Cream of Celery soup, added frozen peas and some crushed celery seed.  You could add a little white wine to the sauce as well.  Great family meal!

I'm looking for a tetrazzini recipe that includes sweet red pepper, and I'm not finding it!
My mother made a casserole she called turkey tetrazzini with spaghetti and, I think, red pepper, as well as turkey and mushrooms.  What I like about this recipe is that it includes cream of celery soup!

This was a good start to the recipe. Like other reviewers though I used 2 cans of soup, cream of celery and cream of mushroom to add more moisture. I sauteed onion, mushroom and garlic in 3 TBS. butter then added the turkey, soup and sour cream and heated through, before mixing it with the noodles and baking.

I loved this but I tweaked it a bit. I added fresh celery and mushrooms, and used cream of mushroom soup since I had that on hand. Also added a little bit more sour cream and Monterey Jack and Parmesan. But my fiance and I ate the whole thing! We couldn't stop eating it, over the course of a few hours. So don't bother putting in a Tupperware, you will keep dishing up every hour until it's gone.

I've made this recipe after Thanksgiving for the past two years and it is delicious.  I always make sure to buy a turkey big enough to have ample leftovers for this recipe.  I did switch out the sour cream with french onion chip dip as another reviewer suggested.  This is great dish!

Great dish that whole family liked!! I added White wine to cream mixture and sauteed scallions with the mushrooms to add an extra burst of flavor!

I give this 5 stars after some adjustments! As with several other reviewers I sauted onions with the mushrooms and when I made the sauce and looked at the noodles I knew it would be a dry casserole.  So I doubled the sauce - 2 cans of soup and 2 cups sour cream.  The result was a deliciously moist turkey dish everyone enjoyed.  Next time I will double the mushrooms as well.

I needed to use up some leftover cooked chicken, so  I chose this recipe even though I made a few changes.  I subbed vermicelli for the egg noodles, plain yogurt for the sour cream, and a Weight Watcher blend cheese for the Parmesan.  I also omitted all salt and added chopped, red bell pepper when I sauteed the mushrooms.  I found this dish to be very tasty for a quick, easy night's dinner.  I'm pretty sure I will use it again the day after Thanksgiving.

This was pretty good - I liked it, picky kids fussed.  It was a little dry though so I would increase the sauce next time.  I substituted french fried onions on top instead of parmeasan cheese and used homemade yougurt from this site instead of sour cream. That gave it a nice tang which, combined with the onions was a good flavor.

This was fantastic, I omited the mushrooms and used 2 cans of mushroom soup.  1/2 of 1 canned milk and 1/2 water.  I added onion powder, poultry seasoning and paprika, just sprinkled in and mixed, maybe about 1/2 tsp.  I used mild cheddar cheese, grated and mixed with the noodles and turkey, then mixed in the sauce and more cheese on top.  It was super easy, true to it's name and even the picky eaters loved it.

This recipe is great – even though I made quite a few changes.  I sautéed a ½ cup onion with fresh sliced mushrooms then seasoned with garlic salt. I then added 2 cans cream of mushroom and ½ cup of heavy cream to mixture.  Last change I made was adding the cheese into the mixture and sprinkled a little extra on top.  My husband and I loved this.

My husband and I thought this was pretty good. I used whole wheat egg noodles, 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and 1 small container of light sour cream.  I also added some season salt and garlic salt and topped it with french onions. As other reviewers suggested, I sauteed onions and mushrooms together.  It added even more flave.  Will make this again.  I think it would be good with other meats as well.

A little bland.  Not enough sauce for the amount of noodles.  Next time I will add onion and maybe some spice.

I had to use spirals since my son is allergic to eggs.  I used low salt cream of chicken instead of celery.  Kids LOVED it (all three), I loved it.  I added 1 1/2 cups of frozen peas during the cooking and garlic powder.  My husband thought it was okay.  But he doesn't like casseroles.  Have made it 2 times now, once with turkey and once with chicken.  A hit with the kids.  Would be great in the crockpot for a potluck!

Warning:  You need to double this recipe, because everyone will want more.  This recipe is so insanely easy and delicious.  I didn't have mushrooms or cream of celery.  I used cream of mushroom instead and 2/3 cups of parm instead of 1/2.  It was a huge hit.  My only complaint is that there were no leftovers.

Good way to use leftover turkey.  I used no yolk noodles, yogert instead of sour cream and reduced fat celery soup.  Added just a little hot sause.  I also stired my noodles and sauce together.

I used leftover chicken breasts and it turned out just fine. I also used breadcrumbs and then sprinkled the parmesan on top of the breadcrumbs. My husband loves Stouffers Turkey Tetrazzini and he thought this one tasted better!!! Our 21 month old ate 3 servings and thats a rarety since she picks at food these days!!! Thanks so much Holly!

This is a great and easy recipe.  I used fresh mushrooms, but otherwise I wouldn't change a thing.  It's the PERFECT thing to do with the leftover turkey after the holidays.  This year  during one of the holidays we had a smoked turkey and I used the leftover smoked turkey in this recipe.  It REALLY made a delicious tasting tetrazzini.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!  I have shared it with everyone I know!

A nice way to use up the last of the holiday turkey after everyone is tired of soup and hot sandwiches. It would be easy to modify using different soups and leftovers as well. I think that I'll try mushroom soup and pork roast next time.

Fantastic recipe. After reading the other reviews, I did improvise a bit. No mushrooms by choice. Sauteed the turkey with shallots and green onions. Added a bit of heavy cream to the sauce to thin it a little, then added a sprinkle of swiss cheese to it. Crushed Ritz crackers on the top! Delicious! Thanks for a great recipe.

Okay, made this again, sort of.. I didn't have all the right ingredients on hand, but it was still delicious. Used Cr of Mushroom soup, and mini bowtie pasta. Had some roasted red pepper crackers of some sort, and it all still worked!  Added a bit of heavy cream to thin the dressing a bit.  This is definitely a keeper recipe that works well with whatever you happen to have on hand!

OMG!! So good!! I read most of the reviews, there were so many great suggestions! Because of my husbands dietary restrictions( he has kidney disease among some other things), our protein choices are very limited. I am just sick of plain turkey cutlets, the thought of having them tonight..., ugh, just couldn't do it. I found this recipe by accident and so glad I did. This recipe i think, is my new favorite. I didn't even use leftover turkey, I panfried (in butter) the 4 cutlets I had & just cut them up. 
Using  alot of the suggestions, I sautéed a chopped onion with a bunch of sliced fresh mushrooms till caramelized, then tossed in the cut up turkey.   I used 2 cans  of soup ( 1 cr of mushroom & 1 cr of chicken), 1 1/2 cup sour cream, and splashed in chicken broth till I had a nice consistency. Threw in some peas for color, mixed that all up & added that to the turkey mixture. I used small shell macaroni (as with so many others, it's what I had in the cabinet). Stirred it all together, 350 degree oven for 30 minutes, added the French fried onions ( best suggestion ever, thanks!!) for the last 10 minutes. My husband cleaned his plate! Unusual for him. The best thing about this recipe is that you can use just whatever you have on hand, if you have the turkey, you're all set! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a great way to use leftover turkey.  My daughter would not let me put all of the sour cream in, so I added about a soup can of milk and extra cheese (mozzarella).

After reading the comments on dryness I decieded to added 1/2c half and half to the soup. I also added sliced black olives, italian seasoning, cumin, seasoned salt,1 large sauteed onion, canned green beans, fresh chopped garlic cooked baby carrots. I mixed everything together in a pan and heated it up. Then I put in some shredded cheddar about 1/2c. I dumped the whole thing with the noodles already mixed in into a large pam sprayed pan. I topped it off with a 6 oz bag of italian blend shredded cheese. Then I cover it with foil and baked at 350 for 30 min. Yum!

I liked this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, except used on the advice of other reviewers, two cans of soup. After it was cooked, I served this in an au gratin dish, over the top of lightly
steamed broccoli.

Good comfort food, and a good way to use up leftovers.  Doesn't save well, and sauce becomes really rich and thick - to thick.  Not something I'd make for company, but good enough.

Very Delicious,  I added 1 cup of peas while the sauce was simmering and it added some color.  I will definitely make this again.  One change I would make is to cut the amount of salt to 1/2 tsp. Thanks for a quick yummy recipe.

I found this dish delicious with 2 cans of cream of mushroom and 2 cups of sour cream. Also I sprinkled parmesan, shredded cheddar and mozzarella on top and we all really loved it. :)

This was quite good, and very easy to make.  I liked that the sauce wasn't too wet (like most casserole recipes).  I did mix the ingredients first before putting it in the dish to bake and substituted fresh onions instead and used more salt and pepper.  I also baked then when the sauce bubbled, i broiled it putting it in the top shelf so the parmesan can brown a little.  Really lovely.  Will definitely make this again.

This was easy to make and used ingredients most people have on hand.  I added diced onion and celery and left out the mushrooms.  Tasted even better eaten as leftovers the next day.

My BF told me, "Throw it out and never make it again."  My BF has changed his tastes since he has been living with me.  He grew up with whitebread American food-- and I grew up eating Japanese food.  There's nothing I hate more than bland food--or the "meat and 2 veg" cuisine.  So I I used this because last year I tried making turkey pot pie with the Tday leftovers.  I had never had pot pie before and I really enjoyed it; so I thought I would give this American casserole a try.  When I first saw the recipe, it reminded me of something I've never actually seen or eaten, but had heard about--"Tuna noodle casserole."  When I plated it, Wonder BF said, "This looks like the typical American food you hate so much."  I told him I had to try new things.  Well, it was as bland and tasteless as I imagine tuna noodle casserole to be.  He ate a little and then made himself a ham sandwich.  I had even tried to kick the flavors up a little, but to no avail.  I added garlic, sauteed onions, fresh mushrooms, milk, and white wine.  Don't make this.  Eat turkey sandwiches instead.

I thought this recipe was awesome! I did make a couple changes. I used cream of mushroom soup instead of celery, I took out the canned mushrooms, put a can of mixed veggies, added about 1/4 cup milk.... It was delicious and I'm definitily making it again.

I changed the recipe a little and added fresh onion and minced garlic to the mushrooms and used smart balance instead of butter.  I also added a cup of sharp white cheddar cheese to the mixture.  I also used one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of celery.

I thought this was great and my son liked it also.  I didn't add mushroom (he doesn't like those, and would spend half the time picking them out) but I did saute some onions, celery and garlic and add a little bit of red pepper flakes.  And I should have pammed the dish a little or mixed it up better.  But I would definately make it again.  Super easy!!!

As per other reviewers, I added more liquid.  I added another can of soup.  Since I did not have cream of celery soup and since there were mushrooms, I used a total of 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, 1/2 chopped onion saute'd with the mushrooms, 1 tablespoon of minced garlic and 1/2 cup of half and half.  The kids and I loved it!  Hubby does not like turkey, so next time, I will try this with leftover chicken.  Definitely a stick to your ribs kinda meal.  Will make this again!

This was DELICIOUS!! I followed other reviews and added sauteed onions, minced garlic, garlic powder, and shredded cheese.  I also added milk for a creamier consistency.  This was my first time eating and making any kind of tetrazzini and was very impressed! I will definitely be making this again- if not with turkey then with chicken!!!!

This is an awesome dish!!  I had a lot of turkey left over from Thanksgiving and it was perfect for this recipe.  I did make a couple of changes.  I used 3 tablespoons of butter and added a small onion and a clove of garlic which I sauted with the mushrooms.  I think it would taste really good with chicken as well.  Loved it!!

I too made some revisions, but it was a HIT with the family.  I change things up in recipes to accomidate what I have on hand.  I sauted diced onions, red and yellow bell peppers with 3 small cans of mushrooms.  I then used an Italian blend of shredded cheese with the sour cream and used cream of chicken soup.  Taking into consideration other reviews that this was 'dry' I threw in a splash of milk. (maybe 3/4 of a soup can).  I didn't have egg noodles, so I used mostaccioli noodles instead.  I made a double batch and froze individual servings for later use.  Will keep this one handy!

This is good for ease and flavor.  Kiddos liked it, too.  I doubled the sauce based on others reviews. (used 1 can cream of celery, 1 can cream of asparagus)  I also sauteed an onion in with the mushrooms.  Before sprinkling the top with the parmesan  Isprikled some Panko breadcrumbs and it added a nice little crispy crunch.  I used tri color rotini because that's the pasta I had.

this was yummy! I used creamy onion soup and added fresh parsley and a 1/4 cup of white wine. my only regret is that I didn't double the soup and sour cream...it could have used a bit more sauce. oh well, Ill do that next time. altogether delicious though!

Didn't have mushrooms, so used cream of mushroom soup.  Sauteed one diced stalk of celery in butter, then added turkey.  Mixed in a broccoli/cauli/carrot blend, then soup and sour cream.  Added enough milk to thin it to a more "saucy" consistency.  Mixed in the noodles and parmesan, then poured into cassarole and topped with french fried onions.  Comfort food at its best.  Don't know why in the world you'd want to add more salt when the canned soup is already PLENTY salty.  Forgot the pepper and it was still delicious.  I think putting the noodles down first may contribute to dryness.  Ours was fine with everything mixed together (and the added milk).

This must be what they call "comfort food", as it appeals to a wide variety of palates and is hard to stop eating! Our friends and all our kids loved it! I did NOT add the salt. I used a package of FRESH mushrooms and added a shallot and sauteed together until soft. I liked it with sherry in the sauce as well as plain. I did feel adding chicken BROTH was important as I wanted the noodles to be creamy. I mixed the sauce and noodles together. Finally, for a bit of zip the next day I added a small splash of Italian dressing to the leftovers before reheating with milk, and this addition, while changing the flavor, made it SPECTACULAR. Highly recommended if you find this too bland.

Very tasty use of leftover turkey. I substituted fresh mushrooms, and used cream of mushroom soup with some celery salt because that is what I had on hand. I also added some sauted onions, and some extra parmesan cheese. Thank you for the recipe.

We found this very bland.  I added some garlic like reviewers suggested and some extra liquid but that wasn't enough to save it.  I'd try adding more vegetables and some Worcestershire sauce, maybe some almonds for crunch... but that would make it a different recipe...

I made this because it sounded easy and like a great way to use up leftover turkey from Thanksgiving!  I followed some of the suggestions such as sauteing onions with the mushrooms and adding white wine during the saute process.  This turned out quite tasty and was very well-received by the family.  Would most assuredly make this one again.

This was absolutely terrible, but I won't blame the person who posted this. I never really liked reheated turkey, to me it always tasted funny. I just thought I'd give this a try & maybe I wouldn't mind the reheated turkey. I guess if you don't like reheated turkey, don't try this recipe, it won't help.   :(

This is good. I sauteed some garlic, frozen green beans and half an onion until tender, added mushrooms and frozen peas at the end before following the rest of the sauce instructions.  I also used two cans of cream of celery soup and it came out at the right consistency. Sprinkled a mixed white-cheese blend on top and in the last 5 minutes added a small can of french fried onions.  It was a good mid-week dinner.

Good and very easy to make. I used cream of chicken soup but mushroom would be good too I think.  I mixed noodles with sauce before baking. Great use for leftover turkey.

Just finished lunching on this - what a tasty way to get rid of the leftovers!  I followed the recipe almost exactly, but did add a little onion.  Next time I might try using the mushroom with roasted garlic soup and put some cheese on top.  I didn't think it was too dry, but I will add a little milk next time to make it "saucier."

I started right off with some changes and it turned out great!  Here is how I did it: I used an 8 oz package of spaghetti broken into approx. 3 inch pieces. I used an 8 oz package of fresh sliced mushrooms and adjusted the sauteing time for those to be done.  I added 1 tsp minced garlic and used reduced fat cream of mushroom soup instead of celery. I used 1 & 1/2 cup of fat free sour cream to lower fat content. And used 1/2 mozzarella instead of parmesean on top. Cooked at 350 for 25 minutes.  It was delicious and I really cut out a whole bunch of the calories and fat!

Took a chance and hit a bullseye!!  Everybody loved it.  Next time I will
try egg noodles as listed instead of the spaghetti I used.  When people were scraping the bottom all they got was overcooked spaghetti! UGH!
I think mixing the noodles with the sauce before putting it in the casserole might be a good idea. This is extremely easy and absolutely delish!!

Really good use for leftover turkey.  After reading reviews, we used garlic and it really brightened it up!

This is a great, easy recipe. My kids loved it so much that I had to make it a regular menu item. They won't wait until there is "left-over" turkey after Thanksgiving!

I was skeptical about this because of jr. high lunch memories, but it was good. My picky 13 yr old even liked it. I had fat free sour cream on hand and it worked great.  Also did not have any mushrooms so put in some chopped asparagus instead. That worked great too. Thanks

I am making this again for the 2nd time. I wasn't sure how it would turn out the first time but it is a keeper. The first time I made it was with turkey after Thanksgiving. It was so good. We haven't made a turkey, so I bought some turkey breast and am currently roasting it to make this dish. I will be doubling the ingredients this time, using cream of celery soup and cream of chicken soup. I also use about 3/4 to 1 can of milk to help with creaminess. I read other reviews and did that the first time. I make roasted green beans with bacon and onion as a side dish. There were no leftovers last time. Making double to (hopefully) have leftovers this time. With two growing teenage boys, nothing much goes to waste:)

I made this after Thanksgiving with my leftover turkey. After reading the reviews, I added a few things like extra sour cream and mushroom soup. I am planning to cook it with leftover Christmas turkey. I may add more things like broccoli this time. Quick and easy the way I like when cooking. Yum Yum!!

Excellent and easy recipe!   Instead of sour cream, I used 0% fat Greek yogurt because that is what I had at home and I wanted to lighten it up a bit.. I also added a cup of green peas, I didn’t add the salt, and I used Healthy Requesr Cambells cream of celery soup.    This is a keeper!

Easy to make. Omitted celery and added more mushrooms and cream of mushroom soup instead. I reserved a cup of pasta water to use if it got too dry. Turned out great!

WOW!  this came out super great....with a few adjustments....
First, no soup.  It's easier for me to make a rue (and certainly less expensive than canned soup).
I increased the butter to 4 Tbs; 
Saute 1/2 chopped onion and 3 garlic gloves in the butter.  When translucent, I mixed in 2 Tbs flour and cooked for about a minute.  Then added milk and chicken broth to make the sauce.
I also used spaghetti instead of egg noodles.
Other than those changes, most other ingredients are the same.
It was amazing and will serve again and again.

Good basic recipe.  Next time would not use salt in saute of the mushrooms    Too salty.  Would maybe add a veg like peas or green beans next time too.

My family loved this! I made a few healthy changes - first, I used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream to make it healthier.  Then I added fresh broccoli that I steamed with the mushrooms to give more veggies to the meal. I also added garlic to make it extra yummy and finally I added Colby Jack cheese on top to lure my kiddos into eating it. They LOVED it and even ate the veggies!!

Just made this recipe and the family loved it!! Followed the recipe above, but added additional can of cream of mushroom soup.  Also cooked a box of frozen broccoli and added to the recipe. Everyone agreed the broccoli gave it a lot of extra taste.  Also, sprinkled with some panko bread crumbs and only based for 20 minutes.  Will definitely make again!

Very tasty. The family liked it. I only added a little more flavor by adding French's Cheddar flavored onions around the edge for a crispy touch.  The added cheddar flavor gave it a nice taste.

I added an onion finely chopped and saute and a quarter of cup of white wine and this was a great meal and a couple of lunches for next day. I considered adding garlic and saw other suggestions and sorry I didn't. Great for left over turkey!!

I had some extra mushrooms and onions so I sauteed them with the other mushrooms.  I also did add an extra can of Cream of Celery and a half can of milk due to some of the other comments and a dash of garlic powder also.   If not for the above additions it would have been bland and not as creamy and I would have given a 3.  I will say you could really do a lot with this recipe if using as a base and adding your own additions.  ******When reheating the leftovers, we added more pepper, garlic salt and some cheese. It really kicked it up a notch!

After reading other reviews, I doubled the butter, mushrooms, cream of celery soup, and sour cream.  I used a deep 9 X 13 dish, topped with french fried onions and the result is pure creamy goodness.   I gave some to a lady friend and was shocked when she told me not to bring it again.   When I asked why she said it was so good that she couldn't walk by without taking a bite.  Didn't even matter if it was cold.

My husband was introduced to stouffer's when he was a child. I had never heard of tetrazzini until one day he was so excited and brought some home. I always wanted to make it homemade so that he would avoid all of the sodium and bad things in those pre cooked meals. Needless to say with the guidance of this recipe this will now be a family staple. I did use fresh chicken breast that was prepared in the oven with sea salt pepper and a little water to prevent browning. I chopped fresh celery, 2 cloves of fresh garlic, and fresh mushrooms. I did use the cream of celery the way it was recommended with a little milk and butter. This was just divine. I also made fresh wheat bread crumbs to mix with the shredded parmesean and added parsley for a little color. The topping is great nice and gooey. I will be making this for years to come!

I really enjoyed this recipe - it was easy and reminded me of a tuna noodle casserole but turkey! I used frozen peas in my version, and angel hair wheat pasta. I also used about a quarter cup more of sour cream than the original, but making it again, I believe a second can of cream of celery soup would make it much better. Great use of turkey leftovers!!!

I added evaporated milk to the celery soup. I also used fresh mushrooms instead of can mushrooms. Along with the celery soup, I added fresh diced celery. After placing shredded Parmesan cheese on top of casserole , I sprinkled crumbed butter and garlic crotons to add crunch and additional flavor. Bon appetite !

We enjoyed this one. It was so simple, quick and a great way to use up some of the leftover turkey. The only changes I made were to omit the mushrooms, (allergies) added a bit of milk to make it a little creamier, frozen peas and bacon (our turkey was blanketed in bacon). It was a little salty for me, but everyone else thought it was just fine. Next time, I may play around with onions and other flavors, but for a quick family dinner, it hit the spot.

I should have read the reviews before I made it and added the extra can of creamy soup. I didn't have the mushrooms and I substituted cream of mushroom soup for the cream of celery. I added a little onion powder and garlic powder. I didn't have the egg noodles so I used penne noodles. Overall it was pretty good. Next time I will saute some onions to add to the recipe also. My nonturkey eaters even ate it.

We liked it. I modified the doubled recipe. I added cream of mushroom soup, 1 med sautéed onion, 2 cloves of garlic, and crushed ritz crackers with butter over the parm cheese. It was very good. I will make it again but will add a touch more salt and black pepper.

Definitely double the sour cream and soup. I used one can cream of celery and one can cream of mushroom. I may even use a little less than the one tsp salt next time. I just combined everything (except parm) and didn't layer as directed. Easy and foolproof recipe.

Good quick recipe! Made it with Thanksgiving leftovers (of course). I increased the recipe by 50% because we had more turkey and people to feed. Used fresh mushrooms and added onions and garlic as others suggested. Also added a half cup of white wine, which helped make it less dry.

This was super simple to make and pretty good but in order for it to be a five star in my book I would add some seasoning to it.

Great comfort food.  I used spaghetti instead of 'egg noodles' and took everyone's advice and added onions, garlic, an extra can of soup (cream of chicken) and an extra cup of sour cream.  Would give it 5 stars except it's very high in fat.  Might try it again with 'no fat' sour cream.

Not my favorite dish, would be much better with a few additions. My husband said it was OK, a little dry.
I would add more sauce for sure and maybe a few sauteed onions. I am sure we will try again with more changes.

This was a great recipe to use up our T-giving turkey. I sauteed 8 oz fresh mushrooms along with 1/2 of a chopped onion. Kept w/ the 1 cup sour cream & used cream of mushroom soup.  Added a little coconut milk & chicken broth, as well. Along w/ the parmesan on top, I put shredded Jack cheese to give it a little zip.  Next time I may add some Tabasco to spice it up a little more.

Easy, yummy comfort food as well as a great way to use up those leftovers.  I used spiral noodles instead of egg, one can mushroom soup, one can cream of chicken soup, twice the sour cream, 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, quite a bit of black pepper, and as there was no Parmesan around, topped it with Mozzerella!  It was awesome.  Fed six kids and one picky hubby.. and all went back for some more!  Cheap and yummy.  Thanks!

I had to adapt this recipe to what I had on hand. Five starts for being able to make a great sauce based on this recipe.  I didn't have canned soup (never do) so I used milk with cornstarch and added celery and onions instead of mushrooms. Turned out very tasty.

i've always vowed i would never bother with a recipe that included a can of soup, but this was good AND easy. A tad salty, probably from the canned goods; next time i won't add the salt and will use unsalted butter for the saute. Might throw some frozen peas in the mix, too. Top baked up nice and crunchy. try it, you'll like it.

I agree with most reviewers, this recipe is a great start, but I followed other's advice and added a soup can of milk and more sour cream.  I also eliminated the mushrooms, added sauteed onions and then peas and italian seasoning.  It was good, not super flavorful, so next time I'll be adding some garlic, too.  Thanks for the recipe!

I sauted fresh onion, celery and green pepper with the mushrooms. I used 6 oz of whole wheat noodles. Turned out very yummy. Even my picky 4 year old son and husband who claims he doesn't like "soupy" dishes loved it.

This is quick, easy, delicious and so lo-cal!  (Just kidding about that last part...)  We love most things with sour cream in them, anyway.  Have made this with chicken and with leftover turkey and it was great both ways.  When feeling especially lazy, a store-bought delicatessan roaster is perfect!  I added frozen peas and fresh mushrooms, too, just for variation.  Also freezes and reheats well.

This is a good base recipe.  I can't imagine doubling the sauce either.  I followed the recipe as mostly written, except I added a medium diced onion and a little garlic salt.  I used whole wheat linguini as the pasta.  I was a little nervous about the cream of celery soup since I'm not a huge fan of celery, but it was good.  I always taste things as I go along, and though I'm not really a tetrazzini authority, it still didn't taste quite right.  I mixed in more parmesan cheese (maybe another 1/2 cup) and a couple of teaspoons of sherry.  That did it.  In the last 5 mins I topped the whole thing with a little more parmesan and dry stuffing mix.  Tasted great.  I'll make it again!

Very good basic recipe.  My family won't eat mushrooms so I subbed peas instead and sauteed them with some onions and garlic.  I am always trying to watch salt content so I tasted the sauce and found that it didn't need any - just a bit of pepper.  For the topping, I crumbled some Ritz crackers along with the parmesean cheese.  Husband loved it, I thought it was good and 6 year old wouldn't touch it.  Still I think this recipe has potential!

I used the equivalent of the can of soup of turkey broth (getting ready for the turkey soup!) as a result of the reviews already posted.  This is a really simple and tasty recipe.  I recommend it.

Added1 can creamof mushroom soup and 1/2 cup chedder cheeses but it didn't spred thoughout the mix so I think I will use shredded cheese next time. I cooked at 350. I added frozen peas but next time I will partially cook them first. I used 4 tablespoons of butter and 1/2 tsp salt, also 2 cups sour cream 1 can mushroom soup.baked 30 min.

It was very good. Will make it again. I used both cream of mushroom and cream of celery soup, and added a half cup of frozen peas. Next time I'll deglaze the pan with white wine after sauteing the mushrooms.

This was a good base recipe- but I had to doctor it a lot so I looked at the reviews and combined them and it came out great- Nice and easy!
Thanks!

This was a great recipe, but I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of celery and added about a half cup each of chopped celery and onion along with the mushrooms, then added about 1/2 cup frozen peas before putting the mixture in the baking dish. I'll make this one again!

I made this with cream of mushroom soup and added some frozen peas & carrots.  I also used spaghetti noodles (these were ingredients I had on hand). I added a 1/2 can of milk and baked at 350 as per other reviews. This meal was very tasty!

This was an excellent recipe my whole family enjoyed.  The only changes I made were to add additional sour cream and some half and half so the sauce wasn't so thick.  I also topped with fried durkee onions. Will definitely make again.

This was easy and pretty good.  I used fresh mushrooms sauteed in the butter with some onions and doubled the sauce (as recommended in other reviews).  I also used cheddar on top.  Next time I plan on adding some mixed veggies.

I am the worst cook in the world and this came out great!  Following other's advice I increased soup to 2 cans and used 1 small container of sour cream.  This way when I forget to take it out of the oven for 1 hour it still tastes delicious!

Good for quick and basic. If you have people who don't like the same things, this is mild enough to suit just about anyone. But that's also the problem, it's not unique. It is still a good quick way to use up leftovers. I threw my half cup of leftover gravy in also to perk up the turkey flavor in it. Also added more pepper to give it kick. Still just "pretty good".

My husband is not a spicy food kind of guy.  His stomach can't handle it, so I was looking for a great tasting alternative and I found it!  This was a HUGE HIT!  We ate the whol pan in 2 days with just the two of us!  I did substitute a can of mixed veggies for the mushrooms and cream of chicken soup instead of celery, but that is for allergy reasons.  It was still fabulous!

Very good, not quite enough sauce, but I used a little extra turkey so that may explain it.  4 of our 5 loved it, will definitely make again!  I used whole wheat pasta, fat-free sour cream and cream of mushroom soup and still delicious!

very very good.  I used the leftover turkey gravy in place of cream of celery and it was delicious.  My kids, husband and parents loved it.  There was no leftovers.  Perfect dinner to make the day after thanksgiving.

my family absolutely loved this creamy tasty dish the flavors blended well and it doubled easliy.  For a smoother taste you could fold the noodles right into the sauce instead of placing it on top.  Yummy!

Hello, all. This is Holly. I lost my old account when I changed my email; the old email address no longer exists.

I did know about the dryness but I wasn't sure how to remedy it. I am glad to see that it has been improved by all of you. It was a recipe handed down to me by my grandmother.

My whole family enjoyed this dinner, my daughter (who is 3) and my son (16months) ate it up.  My daughter finnished with her plate and went to  eat mine.  The only thing I did different from the recipe was I used cream of mushroom and used half cream of chicken then followed the recipe.  All in all great!

Great with the changes others made.  I sauteed mushrooms and onions in 2 tsp butter and some canola oil, adding garlic at the end.  I used 2 cans of cream soup, 3/4 can of water, and 8 oz of plain Greek yogurt (in place of sour cream to be healthier).

Turkey tetrazzini is a great way to use up Thanksgiving leftovers. I took off a star because this recipe took quite a few changes though. A recipe should work on its own without needing changes. Some of these were necessary, some not, and I didn't want to go to the store to get anything. I swapped cream of celery for cream of mushroom soup, because I used up my mushrooms in Thanksgiving's green bean casserole. It would have been better with the mushrooms though. I also sautéed half an onion, a couple os stalks of celery, and some minced garlic to add more flavor. I knew the recipe as is would turn out dry, so I added an can size amount of  broth that I had made from the turkey. Whenever I make noodle casseroles, I don't like mushy bland noodles, so I only cooked them to a bit firmer than al-dente and let them soak up juices in the oven. I had bowtie pasta on hand, but just about any noodle or pasta will work. To use up leftover veggies, I added about a cup each of peas and shredded carrots. We like cheese, so I added all of the parmesan directly into the casserole. After the initial 30 minutes of baking, I topped with shredded mozzarella and bread crumbs and baked another 10 minutes. Great way to use leftovers and clean out the fridge!

In the spirit of using up leftover turkey from thanksgiving I also added leftover carrots thinly sliced, celery, 2 small onions, and an assortment of peppers. I thought I was doubling the sauce but when I went to make it noticed it was only 8 oz of egg noodles, well I had a full pack that’s 16 oz and proceeded. This wasn’t dry at all. Had to use cheddar instead of Parmesan due to what I had but it was so good. It will likely be a year before I make it again but a great way to use leftovers. Thank you.

My family loved it. I started by sautéing celery, onion and garlic...then the mushrooms. Used 2 cans mushroom soup and about 1/4 cup half and half. Topped Parmesan cheese with Panko breadcrumbs prior to baking. The teenager in the house is going to take it in her lunch in a thermos - that’s a HUGE WIN!

This was delicious with a few substitutions both out of necessity and to add flavor. I did not have cream of celery.  I used cream of chicken and substituted celery salt for regular salt. I sauteed about a cup of a  frozen mix of sauteed onion, celery and green pepper (did not need the green pepper). I put 1/2 of the parmesan into the mix along with some mozzarella and put the remaining on top with a mix of 1/2 a sleeve of Ritz crackers.  I dotted the top with butter and baked it in a deeper dish. It took approximately 30 minutes to be perfect and soooo yummy.  No green pepper next time. Many have commented that this recipe is dry. It could have used a little more moisture. I imagine a cream of mushroom soup added would be perfect.

Excellent foundation to personalize. Thanks to many excellent suggestions to take it to the next level.
I prepared my sauce first and let it simmer to build the flavours while I did the pasta. Sauteed the mushrooms, onions and then the garlic. Added one can of cream of chicken and one cream of celery and some globs of sour cream. A bit of milk to thin it out just a bit and 2 TBSP sherry. Salt and pepper and 1 heaping teaspoon of poultry seasoning.  Added in my 2 cups of chopped turkey and let it simmer while I did the pasta.
After dumping the sauce on the pasta I sprinkled panko on top, finely shredded Parmesan and bit of Asiago.  
Baked at 350º for 30 minutes.  Mmmmmm!!!

I do saute an onion and garlic before adding other sauce ingredients.  I have made it with noodles or fettucini.
Very good.

Delicious use for turkey leftovers!!  The only change I made was adding 4 cloves of chopped garlic to the mushrooms prior to sautéing. Huge hit for the whole family!!

I have made this as written but the family found it a little dry. I felt it would benefit from more sauce, while at the same time, I did not want to significantly increase the condensed soup.  We also prefer a crunchier topping.  So, we add the chopped and sauteed onion, garlic,  celery too, a healthy splash of milk (or cream, yum!), some peas, a little extra salt, plenty more pepper, and finally, add Panko tossed with melted butter to the topping.  These small changes make the perfect Tetrazzini for us. :) Thank you very much for a great start at an excellent and easy Turkey Tetrazzini!!

Added onion and garlic to mushrooms while sauteing. Added 1/2 can milk to sauce. Would have used fewer noodles.

I made this but made my own cream of onion soup. Also I made a double batch to save for leftovers. It's pretty good I added peas to mine as it made it a complete meal. Will put this in the box for future use. Thanks.

It was good.  A little too salty.  I think next time I'll use panko bread crumbs on top instead of Parmesan cheese.

Really good, the family loved it!  Will make again.  Was a little dry, but not bad.  I used smoked turkey from Thanksgiving and I think this helped it from being too bland.  Thanks for sharing!!

This was really good to use up the leftover turkey from thanksgiving. I added/changed two things. First I used fresh mushrooms rather than canned but sautéed them just as the recipe called for and I added about a cup of frozen peas and carrots mix. Otherwise I followed the recipe. Family loved it! I will definitely make this again when I have some leftover turkey or chicken.

This was so easy and so good.  I'll make it again and again, and perhaps using chicken in place of turkey.  I can only wonder what it might taste like with leftover ham.

Quick and easy. I added garlic and chopped onions it turned out great. I also used fresh mushrooms and French fried onion rings. 
Next time I make I’ll add a 1/2 cup of water, I thought it was a little dry but everyone thought it was great!

Used homemade noodles and used plain yogurt instead of  sour cream. Added a little milk to moisten it a little.  The turkey was a smoked turkey breast.  It was delicious.

Pretty tasty dish however I thought it was lacking a little something.  I took other suggestions and used garlic, onion and fresh mushrooms.  I also used the soup on hand which was Cream of Mushroom.

This was a good jump start. I didn't have some of the ingredients so had to improvise...sautéed celery, onion and garlic in butter, (sadly no shrooms)browned a bit of flour in the butter mixture  then added warm milk to make a cream sauce with poultry seasoning, mustard powdr, smoked paprika and a bit of chicken bouillon...followed by a tad bit of nutmeg. Simmered for about twenty minutes while I was boiling the pasta and chopping the turkey. I added leftover turkey gravy for the sour cream and forgot the parm but added a splash of sherry per suggestions.  Baked at 350 for 25 min then added the last of the FF onions for another 5 minutes. BF loved it!

Very good after reading reviews I adapted to make creamier. Dryness was a common complaint. I added 1 can English peas, can of cream of mushroom on top of the can of celery, added garlic salt and added an extra cup of sour cream with a 1/2 cup sharp cheddar mixed in

I'm constantly looking for ground turkey recipes and found this works well substituting cooked ground turkey for the leftover roasted turkey.  I added finely chopped onion, celery, and garlic when I browned the ground turkey.  It added a little more bulk.  Oh, and adding a splash of Sherry takes it to a higher level. Family favorite.

So easy and delicious. Being a bit concerned with starchy carbs, I substituted spiraled squash for the pasta. I let the squash steam for a few minutes, then did the rest of the recipe as written. Big hit and glad I have more for another night this week!

It is a great comfort food and a quick meal to make. I added an extra can of condensed soup and I added an onion. I used cream of celery and cream of mushroom soup. I did not actually use fresh mushrooms for this dish. I had a few extra seasonings that I like to add most of the time (basil, oregano, and parsley). I chopped up turkey deli meat and it turned out well. I would make this dish again :)

I made it without mushrooms for the kiddos. I think the only thing I will change next time is more cheese, and different kinds of cheese.

Made it, and we both loved it, with the following changes.   Used brown rice fusili pasta, and Amy's organic mushroom bisque with porcini mushrooms.     Sauteed 1 medium onion, and 3 cloves of garlic, added fresh crimini mushrooms, then chicken and soup and sour cream, along with about 3 tbsp. of Marsala wine for flavor.   Cooked it a little less than the max. time, as the mixture was already bubbling.   Very nice, somewhat complex flavors.

YUK....and I'm easy to please. I roasted a turkey and used fresh mushrooms. Made several large baking trays for a party. Boring, pretty tasteless, and such a huge waste of money

Bland - I’m used to a spicier version so I added red peppers and a little cayenne.  That helped.

I don't usually make recipes with soup, but I needed something simple for hubby to make. We added fresh mushrooms rather than canned, which added more flavor.  Make sure that the noodles are well-covered with sauce or they get dry.

Seems to be very flexible. I think the sour cream is what makes it. I mixed everything together, including the cheese, and baked it with crumbs  (bread crumbs, Italian seasoning, parmesan, and olive oil, from my freezer) on top, and it tasted good, in spite of my having no mushrooms and no celery soup (used mushroom). I did thin it out with half-and-half (because I was out of milk). Probably be good with peas in it, too.

This was delicious! I used fettuccini noodles because I didn’t have egg noodles on hand.
As another person suggested, I added some chopped garlic and cooked it in the butter before adding the mushrooms (I used fresh baby Bella as opposed to canned), then added the rest of the ingredients. I also added some heavy whipping cream to the skillet- about 1/2 to 3/4 of a cup (I eyeballed it). 
I also mixed about 1/2 cup of the Parmesan into the mix and added about 1/2 cup of sharp cheddar too. After I covered the noodles with the mix I added both types of cheese to the top, along with some sliced olives.

Very easy and really good.  I added the onion they mention in the video.  Next time I will saute some fresh mushrooms in butter instead of the canned ones.

Great use for leftover turkey! I doubled the recipe and used one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of celery. I also added 1cup of sharp cheddar and fresh mushrooms in with the soup. I would like to add onions, broccoli or peas....it could use another veggie. But very easy and good if you add some cheese.

I just made this recipe for dinner. It seemed a little dry so I added a can of cream of mushroom with the cream of celery. It turned out to be a nice combo. Added some celery, onion, and garlic which seasoned it up, as it was quite bland before the additions,. Overall, I liked it but my husband didn’t so I won’t make it again but was glad I made it once. Thank you for the recipe though.

This was really good!  I'm not usually a fan of turkey in casseroles, but I needed to use up some leftovers and this was a perfect way to do it.   I followed the recipe exactly.  It had a great flavor despite being just a speck dry.  The next time I make it I'll add a half soup can of milk.  I'm so glad I found this recipe!

I made some simple changes: used fresh mushrooms, 2 cloves minced garlic, 1/2 tsp smoked paprika and added about 1/2 - 3/4 cup Chardonnay to doubled recipe. This was very good and great use of leftover turkey!

For what it is - what to do with turkey leftovers - this dish is fabulous. Cheap, easy, and delicious. I classed it up with 1/2 cup of dry sherry. The family crushed on it.

We liked it alot!  Easy the way the title says.  I did add about a can of milk more and a little extra cheese on top.  But otherwise as the recipe says exactly .  I made it in one pot noodles to oven also to make it even easier.

It turned out great!! My hubby and all the visiting kids still with us from Thanksgiving(lol) loved it!! It was super easy... I did alter and here is what i did...
I topped with ritz crackers 
used a different noddle 
added (leftover) french onion dip instead of sour cream. Huge hit!! I will make this again with ground turkey  for a week night meal ( like i said they all really loved it)

After making so many changes that this was almost a totally new recipe this was still bland, dry. Made a side of cheese sauce after it was baked which helped. I have made better versions, but his was easy  in comparison.

Great comfort dinner after Thanksgiving.  I used a large can of Mushroom soup and one small can of celery. I used a bit of Sherry when I sautéed the celery, onion, and fresh mushrooms. I also made a coating on top of butter, fresh shredded Parmesan cheese, french's dried onions ranch style, and bread crumbs. It was awesome and everyone loved it! Fresh biscuits and a salad made the meal complete.

We made it after Thanksgiving with the left over turkey. Now we substitute turkey with chicken. Still great and easy. Leftovers are even better.

This recipe needed a little tweaking. I made mine a little creamier buy doing half cream cheese and half sour cream, and adding half a can of water to the soup (I also swapped out cream of celery for cream of chicken when using this for a chicken tetrazzini dish)

I was dying for something meaty and creamy with carbs. This hit the spot. I plan on making it for a dinner party

This recipe was very good - even my picky eater in the family ate it without giving me a hard time. I did  sprinkle a bit of cheddar cheese on the top - other than that, I followed the recipe to the letter.

I am not a fan of reviewing things when they've been changed, so I'm apologizing in advance for doing exactly this. I'm actually doing it though so I can add notes to what I added. There used to be a spot for notes, but I can't find it now??? I added 1/2 an onion to saute with the mushrooms. I did 1/2 the amount just salt and the other 1/2 garlic salt. I added 1/2 c. shredded cheddar, 1/2 can (or a little more) of peas to the sauce at the end and a few splashes of heavy whipping cream to make the sauce not too thick. My kids, hubby and I all enjoyed it. I think the things I added just added a lot more flavor, but it was fine without them, just better with them.

This was a good recipe I gave it four stars because I had to modify it a bit. 
 I used a rotisserie chicken from the store and cut it up into cubes 
I added a half a cup of sour cream one can of chicken broth low-sodium, cream of celery soup low-sodium a pinch of tarragon a pinch of thyme,  minced garlic and a half cup of dry cooking wine. 
 I also added a splash of milk when  heating all the liquid ingredients together to keep the consistency in not too thick.
 I will definitely make this again.

I did this the easy way, but basically followed the recipe.  I used rotisserie chicken from the grocery. I didn't sauté the mushrooms and omitted the butter.  I followed the advice of some others and used 2 cans of soup - one cream of celery and one cream of mushroom - as well as the sour cream.  I also toasted 1/2 cup of sliced almonds and added them to the mix.  It was very good, and I'll add it to my regular rotation.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Made as written but with fresh mushrooms and garlic....not enough flavor after tasting  so did a lot of adding.  After baking it was way too dry so made another sauce and added but did not bake again.  Very good.

Here is what I did differently: sautéed diced onion, garlic and mushrooms; added 1 can each cream of mushroom and cream of celery soups, 1 can of milk and 1/2 can white wine; used thin spaghetti (because that is what I  had on hand) sprinkled with panko crumbs mixed with grated Parmesan.     Was very good.

A very simple to make recipe and very tasty.  

The only thing differently that I would suggest, is once the noodles and the toppings are done, combine everything but the parmesan cheese in a bowl and mix thoroughly to get every noodles sopping wet with gooey goodness.  Pour the mix into the baking pan and top with the parmesan cheese.  

Otherwise, the pouring method, you're libel to miss some noodles and they get hard and died out in the oven. 

I love this recipe, one of my all time favorites.

As is not enough flavour.  I took other reviewers suggestions and sautéed onion and celery and mushrooms. Since I didn't have cream of celery soup, I used 2 cans of mushroom soup and 1/2 cup of cream.  I agree there would not be enough sauce with just 1 can of soup.  Not a favorite but ok.

I make this dish  but I added a half of soup can of milk and I added bacon it was a hit with my family. My husband said he liked how the bacon give it more flavor able taste. I also added about 1/2 of onions when I sauteed my mushrooms. It was great for a Sunday night dinner with salad.

This recipe was very good. I made some modifications. I used left over Christmas turkey added fresh garlic with the mushrooms. Added chicken broth since the sauce was thick. Used  spaghetti instead and made two layers with sprinkled cheese on the bottom and top layers...yummy.

Very good!  I included the following: Fresh mushrooms instead of canned. Then, added shredded cheddar cheese to sauce along with green onions and white wine. Did have to add some milk to sauce before baking as the sauce was a little too thick. I used linguine (cut in thirds) because I had them on hand. All in all, husband really liked it, so this is a "keeper."

I haven't had turkey tetrazzini in decades and was craving it. Now I regret all those missed meals after tasting this recipe. So good and satisfying. I will definitely use this recipe after every turkey dinner in the future. I didn't add extra salt as the soup is already salty enough for my taste.  I did add extra fresh parsley and any chives as I always have them around.

I made this recipe and added a little more than an eighth of a cup of sherry to a double recipe. Layered turkey/soup mixture over spaghetti.  It was so close to a restaurant dish I had gotten years ago on a date with my husband and it brought back fond memories. Everyone enjoyed it even my 13 yo son who is very picky. I will definitely make this again, probably with chicken next time. It's a wonderful comfort dish.

This recipe is the one I used the first time I had a bunch of leftover turkey, and now I make this yearly! I give it five stars, because of the ease of the recipe, and also because it has lots of wiggle room to tweak it to  individual preferences. I do not like casseroles dry! I add another can of soup. It can be cream of onion, chicken, or mushroom. I add sautéed onions, because it adds so much flavor. I also add just over a can of milk. I make it pretty wet, knowing in the next day, it will obsorb more liquid. When I re-heat later, I put a little butter on top and cheese, and it's like it's right out of the oven again. You cannot lose, with this recipe! I salt, and pepper and add a few other spices, and it's perfect every time.

This is a very easy recipe.  I bought my turkey precooked at the deli counter.  Add some red bell pepper and green peas or celery and onion.  Doubled the recipe and froze half.  I felt that it needed some herbs, so added some parsley and marjoram.  Adding a dash of hot sauce on at the table.   As others have stated, this recipe can be dry as written.  I suggest using two cans or soup OR two cups of sour cream, OR adding a bit of milk.

With the high cost of ground beef, I wanted to try a recipe I could use ground turkey. I browned a pound with the butter, salt and pepper, half an onion and a Clove of garlic. I also added about 1/3 can of milk and a small amount of peas for color. It was good!!

I used the macaroni noodles from a box of mac not cheese and a handful of spaghetti noodles I was needing to get used( and too lazy to go to the store). I omitted the mushrooms since I don't care for them, used 1 can of cream of celery, about a 1/2 cup of whole milk and 2 table spoons of cream cheese. Sautéed half an onion in butter with the chopped turkey and some cheese...great guide recipe. Good thing about casseroles, you can easily make them your own.

I followed directions but I added my own touch. I put in roasted diced tomatoes, added milk for less consistency, cream of mushroom & cream celery, added mild shredded cheese, onions, garlic powder, cumin. Baked at 350° for 30 minutes, mmm kiss kiss delicious.

I made changes before I tried this recipe and my family really liked this dish. I sauteed fresh mushrooms (canned are over cooked), used cream of asparagus soup instead of cream of mushroom and I added a can of drained whole black olives which I sliced in half.  I also added a cup of water as the mixture was too dry.   This recipe is filling and easy for a quick Sunday evening dinner.

I followed the directions for ingredients, but due to our busy schedule, instead of baking for 40 minutes, I added some cream and milk to a rich, creamy consistency and let it simmer on the stove for a few minutes.  Everything was cooked thru, warm and the family loved it. Usually they hate leftover turkey or chicken.  This was great, it was all gone and they were fine if I made it again. And I wll.

This was a great base recipe. I sauteed garlic and onion in the butter before adding the mushrooms. I then added whatever veggies I had (yellow bell pepper and broccoli). It seemed thick as others mentioned with one can of soup and the sou cream - so I added about half a cup of milk.

This wasn't the most exciting meal in the world. I found it a bit bland. Most of the flavor comes from the parmesean cheese. If I were to make it again, I would definitely add more seasoning. It's also not the healthiest thing in the world, obviously.
On the plus side, it's mild flavor makes it a very toddler-friendly dish (assuming your toddler is willing to eat mushrooms; mine is, for now). It was also mostly hands-off prep and didn't dirty many dishes, which I always appreciate.

Followed recipe to exact instructions. Dish came out too dry but was still pretty tasty. I added chopped red pepper just to make it look more festive. Next time I make it I will use RLiNDA revisions so dish will be creamier.

I rated it a five but I added 3 pieces of crumbled crispy bacon and I also sauted 1/2 onion and the mushrooms in 4 TBSp of butter, and I added 1 can of evaporated milk and also some milk (about 1/2 can)just to make creamier since the noodles will soak it up. I also added garlic powder, seasoned salt, cumin, and salt and pepper. I didn't use parm. cheese but I topped mine with shredded sharp cheddar.I turned out delicious!!!! This will be my regular turkey leftover recipe from now on!!

A delicious way to get rid of turkey!  I didn't have cream of celery, so I substituted cream of mushroom.  My family of picky eaters cleaned their plates!

Awesome recipe. You can add or subtract to this to fit your tastes without going wrong. I omitted the mushrooms(picky eaters),added garlic and mozzarella to the soup/sour cream mix. Yummo. Next time I am going to try French onion dip instead of plain sour cream.

This was a good recipe.  I made a couple of adjustments based on what I had on hand.  I used angel hair instead of egg noodles and cream of chicken soup instead of cream of celery.  Based on one of the reviews, I may get some cream of celery and use that next time.  I think I will also use onion and may moisten it up a bit, as I also found it a little dry (but my hubby didn't, so maybe not!).  All in all, a good recipe and since the hubby liked it - a keeper!

This recipe was delicious, but a little too salty for my taste.  I used 1/2 the salt recommended. Perhaps, the smoked turkey leg made the recipe too salty.

Delicious!  I used cream of mushroom instead and added some minced onion due to my hatred for cutting onions.  This really has a flavor compared to stroganoff.  We will definitely be having this again.

This was a good recipe.  I jazzed it up a bit.  I sauteed red, yellow & green bell peppers, 2 cloves of garlic and some sundried tomatoes in olive oil.  For the sauce, I added about 1/4 cup of white wine and 1/4 cup milk to make it saucier, and also some dried Italian seasonings.  Topped it off w/ provolone cheese and Parmesean.  My hubby and son loved it.  This recipe is a keeper!

We love this and everywhere I've taken it I have been ask for the recipe. I tell them "It is an old family favorite Internet recipe". LOL! I have been making it for some time and forgot to rate it. I make it more often with Chicken. Thanks for a real keeper. The nice thing is I have an extra pan to share with family or friends.

I improvised on this recipe...used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of celery, added minced garlic when sauting the onion and substituted frozen broccoli for the sliced mushrooms.  Also, I threw in some chopped up bacon with the turkey and used Colby cheese in place of the grated Parmesan cheese.  It still turned out well!

My family and I loved this recipe! A great way to use left over turkey. I did change a few things. I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, and a can of carrots. I did not use a can of mushrooms. I had the carrots on hand, and wanted to use them instead. This recipe will be making a comback at our home after thanksgiving next year!

I thought it was ok. My husband hated it.  (Didn't even finish it) Though it could be just turkey overload.

Very good! However, I did modify per other reviews. I doubled the recipe and used 1 can cream of mushroom, 1 can cream of celery, 1 cup chicken broth, 1 cup turkey gravy, along with the 1 cup sour cream. I didn't use mushroomes cuz I didn't have any, but I did add 1 cup of cooked peas to the sauce. Kids loved it!!

OOOOOOO! This was delicious. New neighbors moving in next door went gaga over it. Yes they were tired and hungry, but they made a point of both stopping later and saying they couldn't stop eating till it was all gone. I added giblet gravy, roasted garlic and cooked sausage.Thanks, elbo

Very good.  I added veggies (cooked with the noodles) and garlic powder and italian seasoning.  Next time I'll just mix it all together instead of layering the sauce on top of the noodle because I had to mix it after to get any sauce on the noodles.  I also had some milk to the sauce before it cooked.

Excellent, it could use just a little more moisture next time so I think I will add about 1/4 cup of milk. I used 4oz mushroom's as I really don't care for them. I also added 2 tbs pimentos because my husband wont eat Tetrazzini without it and it does make a nice addition. My family loved this and my children asked for seconds and thirds which is no small feat.

An easy recipe and a great meal.  If you would like to increase the sauce, try using a can of chedder cheese soup. It really gives the meal a kick.

This was good.  I wanted a little more depth in flavor so I used fresh mushrooms sauteed with a diced onion and crushed garlic and it was excellent.  Thanks for the new recipe!

It was ok. The cream of celery soup kind of overpowered the dish taste wise. But, the fiancee enjoyed it, so that it a big plus.

This turned out better then I thought it would.  I have another recipe I like a little better. Use 7oz. fettuccine noodles, 2 cups chicken broth, 2 cups milk, 1/2 cup flour, 1/4 butter, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp. pepper, 2 cups turkey or chicken, 1 cup sliced olives, 1 cup cheddar cheese. bake 350 degrees for about 25 min.

I made this recipe with a few variations. I din't have cream of celery soup so I used cream of mushroom soup, and I didn't have mushrooms so I used peas and corn. The taste was still very good. I made a full recipe for just myself and my eight year old, and we ate it all in two days over the course of several meals. Next time, I will not add any salt, or use half the salt.

Made according to directions except only used 1 tablespoon of butter, chicken instead of turkey, and spaghetti noodles instead of egg noodles.  I thought the sauce was good and thick but not too much so.  If anything I cooked it 5 minutes too long and some noodles got crispy which was actually okay but next time I will cook it for 20 minutes instead of 25.  A good meal when I was in a hurry.  Will make again.  Thanks.

My family LOVED this recipe!!  My one son who never has a second helping of anything, actually had a second helping of this!!  My family doesn't like mushrooms, so didn't use them and used either strips of chicken I cubed or cubed chicken - prepackaged.  I didn't have or couldn't find cubed turkey.  I melted the butter in the bottom of the skillet and added the sour cream, chicken and soup to that and that helped to make it more moist.

This was acutally good and a great way to use up left over turkey.  I used fresh sauteed mushrooms with some onions. I topped it off with ceddar cheese but I think next time I will use less egg noodles because it seemed a little dry once it was baked. I think this would also be good with chicken for a quick week night meal.

I really liked this recipe, although I used Cream of Mushroom Soup and lots of extra parmesan and added the italian blend of grated cheese that includes monzerella, parmesan, romano, and several others.  My husband loved it, and there were no leftovers!

This was simple and good.I have a large family so I doubled it. I did change it a little. I used spaghetti noodles instead of egg noodles and 1 each of cream of chicken and cream of celery. I also added a bit of milk to the sauce and stired it into the noodles instead of over. It was a bit thick, I think next time I will double the amount of soups.

Very easy to make. I added some additional spices and it still was a bit bland but nevertheless my daughter ate it so that makes it get a "4."

We enjoyed this dish. I would have liked to have a little more sauce as I had extra egg noodles, but that was my own fault. The dish itself was very good. Will make this one again.

I liked this recipe but found it a little bland. Next time I would add onions and use Mushroom/Garlic soup and a red pepper to liven it up a little.

This was excellent - and super easy.  Kids loved it, husband loved it.  It holds well too - I made it in the morning and kept refridgerated until dinner time.  And I substituted fresh mushrooms for canned - yum!  Thank you!

My wife liked it pretty good, I didn't like it much at all.  Didn't seem to have much flavor.  Perhaps if you add different veggies to it, it would be better

Very easy. I substituted linguine noodles for egg noodles and I added a can of mixed veg because I had it.  Did not alter the recipe consistancy at all.  Will definately make this quick and easy meal again.  Served it with refrigerator biscuits and honey.  Delicious combo.  And oh, the next day when I re-heated the leftovers, it was just as good - if not better...... YUM!  I guess I know what I'll be doing with the left over turkey from thanksgiving this year!!

I really enjoyed this one.  I used cream of mushroom soup w/ the roasted garlic instead of celery soup.  Also added a can of mushrooms into the turkey mixture and then mixed everything into the noodles as some suggested. Really very tasty and super easy.  Thank you for a great turkey leftover recipe!

I substituted cream of chicken soup, added a "splash" of milk and some green onions.  I used mozzerella cheese and 1/4 cup turkey gravy.  It was WONDERFUL.

With some minor variations we really liked this.  It was very flavorful and has great combination power (different veggies could be added, ect..)  My oven is very powerful and I wanted to make sure it didn't dry out so I only baked it for 15-20 minutes and it was perfect!  Also I added a few dashes of tabasco sauce to the mixture and about a cup of semi thawed green peas before baking and it gave it a nice flavor.  Also I used 3/4 can cream of celery and 3/4 can cream of chicken.  I also used a combination of mild cheddar cheese and the parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. It's a keeper and I recommend it!

Perfect meal for leftover turkey!  The whole family enjoyed it!  I had to substitute mozzarella for parmesan, and it came out great!

My entire family loves this recipe.  We just made it 2 nights in a row.  I left out the mushrooms and salt but otherwise followed it exactly.  Great comfort food on a cold night!
