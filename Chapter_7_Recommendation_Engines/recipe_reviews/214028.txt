I don't usually like to rate/review my own recipes, but this would get five stars from me even if it was someone else's recipe.  If you use real vanilla extract, you'll want to use a little less.  Also, this cheesecake freezes very well, so you can make a full recipe and just freeze the extra pies for eating at a later date.  One BIG tip - if you're wanting a cheesecake with a flavor and texture like those made with cream cheese, please keep looking, because this recipe isn't for you.  If you're open to a new twist on cheesecake, then I encourage you to enjoy this delicious recipe!

This Cheesecake is so very delicious. I did cut the recipe down to 2 pies since we are just 5 and I didn't want any to go to waste. I love the citrus with the anise flavor and then the chocolate! Whats not to love?

I also love this dessert! In the hubster's fam, though they call it "Ricotta Pie" but the classic flavors are the same. It isn't a classic "cheesecake", but it is an Italian classic! I haven't tried freezing it yet, but we have several things coming up and I just might try that!

This was a huge hit at Thanksgiving! My brother-in-law is Italian, and his parents' eyes lit up when they realized I had brought a ricotta cheesecake - no, it's not like what most of us expect a "cheesecake" to be like, but as far as a ricotta pie-type dessert, this was the best one ever.  Scaled down to one pie, and I had no lemon to zest so added a drop of lemon extract and a bit of orange zest along with the lime zest.  Less rich, less sweet than the typical cheesecake, but delicious!  This will be a definite repeat in our house!

Scaled this back to make one cake.  We liked this one.  It was different than a typical cheesecake.  I wasn't sure my kids would like the anise but they didn't say a thing.  Used regular vanilla extract and used the same amount called for.  It was good!
