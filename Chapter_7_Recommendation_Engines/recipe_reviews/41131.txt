I really thought these would be good. They really werent. Noone liked these. They just weren't for us. I think if you added an egg, vanilla and some spices they might be okay. I was really bummed.

These muffins are vastly improved by the addition of 1 egg and 1/2 a banana. They become moist and fluffy, though not completely fat free. My toddler loves them now!

Great, especially considering they're nonfat and very easy to make. We'd gotten a huge box of fresh prunes on sale, so I made one batch following the recipe exactly and another with the addition of ground flax seed (and water to compensate) as another reviewer recommended. Both turned out well.

Dense, moist, and chewy! I added a couple more prunes because I used 50/50 whole wheat:all-purpose flour. I think I'd use less of the whole wheat next time though. I also added some vanilla and made 6 regular muffins instead of mini-muffins. I'm sure the mini-muffins would be nice because they're so dense. I really like that they're fat-free and good for you!! =o)

For a fat free muffin I thought they were pretty good.  I doubled the recipe and by doing this I found the dough a bit too stiff so I added another tablespoon of water....this made them better to spoon out into the tins....it is a rather stiff dough though but bakes up real nice.  If using paper liners after cooling them put them in a large zip lock bag....the moisture will loosen up the papers a bit.  Will make these again.

Simply gooeylicious! I've even devised my own variation: substituting spelt flour, and adding 1/4 cup of flaxseeds to the mixture (add another 1/2 cup of water to compensate for flaxseed expansion).

Delish!!!

I made these today, my first attempt at muffins; they were really easy, and came out very light with a nice texture.  I had to make one change as we dont usually have prunes, so I used dried apricots instead.  I might stick with the apricots and increase the honey next time as I'd like it a little sweeter.  Thank you for what is obviously a foolproof recipe!

I added a few extra prunes, since I was trying this recipe just so I could use up all the prunes I had.  I added an extra 1/2 cup honey since I wanted to cancel out the prune taste, and I made 6 full size muffins.  As expected, these didn't rise much (due to the changes I made), but they sure were good anyway.  All these prunes will get used thanks to Deepti.  :)

I didn't like these at all. The kids ate it but only after buttering them. I normally go for fat free food but these muffins just didn't taste very good.

These were far from muffin texture. I even tried adding an egg and vanilla as one of the reviews suggested. I won't make these again. However, Banana Prune Muffins...excellent!

I am not sure what I did wrong. They stuck to the muffin papers and were chewy. Not the texture I expected but the flavor was awesome.

I'm not a big fan of prunes but I had a can leftover and didn't know what to do with them. I made this expecting to be disappointed since there is no sugar in them, but they were actually pretty good considering how low fat these are.

The batter smelled good, but... after coming out of the oven, it was one hard clump and not so good tasting.

Ick. I'd MUCH rather eat plain prunes. These were just spongey, high carb balls of dough that tasted kind of like prunes, but mostly like flour.

i was really excited about these because i love most fat free baked goods and i'm also a big fan of prunes, but they turned out just way too pruney for my taste.  maybe adding more flour to make them fluffier and more honey to mask the prunes would help?

So easy to make!  I needed a recipe to get some prunes into my 4 year old's diet quick and this did the trick.  The syrup was a must since she could still taste the prunes, but she had seconds.  Thanks for sharing this recipe Deepti!
