I adjusted this for my family and I believe it made for a better dish, please let me share what I did. 
#1 I added less than the called-for amount of onion soup mix,
#2 I added Kikkoman soy sauce
 #3 fresh garlic
#4 brown sugar, I mixed the above with pineapple and juice then poured it over chicken. It baked golden, carmely brown. I served w/white rice. this was wonderful will make again, thank you for a great recipe base.

Following the advice of others, I changed the following:  Cut 3 breasts into thin cutlets (6 total), used 1 pkg of onion soup mix, pineapple juice and enough water to make 1 1/2 cups (instead of the 2 cups of water), 1 T brown sugar, 1 T soy sauce, and 2 cloves minced garlic.  I brought the liquid mix to a boil once in the skillet, then simmered on medium for 30 minutes.  I also didn't add the pineapple until the final 15 minutes.  Sauce thickened nicely and the whole family loved it.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was so easy and tasty! As I was only making this for my husband and me, I just used 2 boneless/skinless chicken breasts, but I used a whole packet of onion soup mix and a whole can of crushed pineapple with the juice. I added about 1 cup of water. Also, about 5 minutes before the chicken was done simmering, I removed the chicken, sliced it, and returned it to the mixture to simmer for a few more minutes. Then I served it all over rice. We loved it!

My husband and I literally licked our plates, this was so good!  I only used two chicken breasts, sliced into long 1/4" thick pieces. I also changed the recipe according to previous notes in the following way: Dust chicken in black pepper and garlic before browning. Use no water, but use 1 1/4 cup pineapple juice. Add 1/2-3/4 tbsp soy sauce, 1 heaping tbsp brown sugar with one full packet of onion soup. Add pineapple chunks/rings, 2 heaping tbsp flour, 1 1/2 tbsp garlic in last 5 minutes to thicken and flavor.  I only let this simmer for approximately 15-20 minutes. Served over white rice with a small amount of butter, with green salad with ranch on the side.

Very Very Good!!I followed the other reviewers suggestions and this is what I came up with. I used 1 can of pinapple juice, 2 heaping tablespoons of brown sugar, and a few dashes of 50% sodium soy sauce, I brought that to a boil in a sauce pan, then simmered untill it thickend. I seasoned my chicken with grillmates monterey chicken, lightly browned it in a skillet. then transfered to baking dish, added the pineapple chunks and basted it with the sauce.

This recipe got full marks from both myself and my husband. (He ate 4 pieces!)  I used skinless, boneless thighs and added the full amount of water called for, PLUS all the pineapple juice, and TWO full packets of onion soup mix, rather than 1 1/2, because we like a stronger flavor.  It was great.  As my husband pointed out, it tasted vaguely oriental - kind of dark and sweet, but not very sweet.  This one is an instant family favorite!

This is great and so easy.  i don't know what the other folks were talking about!
I don't use the oranges, and sometimes I throw rice in while it simmers.
Fast, easy, cheap, and good!

Almost tasteless chicken!  Recipe needs dijon mustard or something to help it.  The only good part was the pineapple.

My family just finished this meal with rave reviews. I was worried about it being bland after reading reviews so I did some slight modifications. First I used 3 half breasts and marinated them in 1/4 cup of Teriyaki sauce for a couple of hours. I browned them in my electric skillet. Then added to the skillet 1 1/2 tbs brown sugar, 2 cloves of garlic chopped, 1 20 ounce can of crushed pineapple, 1 package of onion soup mix. I used the juice from the pineapple and water to make 1 1/2 cups of liquid. I then simmered the chicken for about 25 min. The sauce was plenty thick. It was amazing and I will be making it ALOT! Didn't use any oranges. I served it over chicken rice pilaf. I will try white rice next time just for something different.

I only had three breasts so I adjusted the recipe.  I had a 20 oz can of pineapple so I used 3/4 of that can and substituted 1 cup pineapple juice for the 2 cups water--and used only 2 tbsp of the onion soup mixture.  In reading about the blandness, I sprinkled the chicken with garlic powder and black pepper as well.  I also chunked up my chicken to speed up the cooking time.  At the end I added a flour/water mixture to thicken it up and glaze everything.  The result was two very full children and a very happy husband!  Thanks for a great quick weeknight meal!  Next time I will use a little more water and serve the sauce over rice.

Sorry, we simply did not like this.  Onion soup mix and pineapples just don't mix IMO.

I liked the idea of this recipe, I followed the instructions and honestly thought it fell kind of flat.  I like the sauce but didn't think it did anything for the chicken.  I prob won't make it again.

Following the advice from some of the other comments, I added 1 Tbs of soy sauce, 1 Tbs brown sugar and a clove of garlic. I didn't have an orange, so I put in 1 Tbs orange juice. I only used a couple Tbs of water, and added the juice from the pineapple. I also added about a tsp of cornstarch to thicken the sauce and some freshly chopped ginger. My husband who doesn't usually like pineapple loved it!

I had to add some soy sauce to add some color and was tempted to add brown sugar but decided not to. I also used the pineapple juice and water to get to the 2 cups. I think that helped with the flavor. It was nice to try but not sure I'll be doing in again unless I revamp it a little bit more.

This was really easy and pretty good. Following other peoples' advice, I used 3 chicken breasts (cut into cutlets), 1 package of low-sodium onion soup mix, combined water and pineapple juice to total 1 1/2 cups, 1 tbs brown sugar, and 2 cloves minced garlic. I brought the liquid mix to a boil once in the skillet, then simmered on low for 30 minutes. I probably should've kept the heat higher to let it thicken better.

On a recent weekday night we were in a hurry, but we wanted to have a real sit down dinner as a family.  So as I left the office I grabbed my IPhone and used the AllRecipes.com application to find a recipe that sounded like it fit the criteria and this is what I decided on for that night.  I stopped by the grocery and picked up two items and was cooking within minutes of walking in the door. Dinner was a snap and it was tasted great.  I adjusted the recipe in the following ways:  We only have three of us so we  only used three chicken breast halves.  I therefor used only 1 full package of the dry onion soup mix and decreased the liquid by 1/2 cup.  In addition I drained my pineapple juice into a measuring cup and added water to the 1.5 cup mark and used that as my liquid.

Easy and fast to put together with easy on hand ingredients. Was a bit disappointed the citrus "zing" I hoped would jump out at me didn't--so be ready for that, should you follow per directions. Other reviewers offer up some really ingenious tasty zip up ideas.

Recipe doesn't make a lot of sense (brown boneless breasts meat side down?). The pineapple would've tasted better raw, and the chicken was pretty bland. Edible, but I won't make it again.

It was really, really good.  The only problem was that my husband said it smelled like dirty socks.  So I will only be able to make it every once in a while.  But it was declicious.

Nice flavor, golden brown chicken. I didn't use oranges and they were not missed.

I tweeked this recipe by adding some worcestershire sauce,red bell pepper and a little salt and pepper. Instead of browning the chicken in the skillet I just slid it all in the oven, simple. You can do a lot with recipe it is very easy and tasty.

I found this recipe to be okay. I did have to change it up a bit though. First, I cut up the chicken into bites. Second, I found out at the last minute that I didnt have dry onion soup mix.. im sure it would have tasted better that way. I seasoned my chicken with salt, pepper, onion & garlic powder. I also cut up a green pepper and added it to the simmering mix. Per reviews, I saved the pineapple juice from the can which equaled almost one cup. I added half a cup of water to that and put it in the skillet. Also, I mixed in some low sodium soy sauce. Lastly, I used manadarin oranges. I served this over brown rice. The sauce wasn't thick and I didnt have corn starch to thicken. I basically created an entire new recipe but still used this as my base and cooking times. This was an easy recipe, but the chicken was bland, even with the spices that i added.

Awesome recipe:) I cut up the chicken and browned it in a skillet but then transferred it to a crock pot with the pineapple undrained and both pckts of soup mix.I put it on low till my husband and daughter were ready to eat, which was probably 4 -6 hours. He works days and I work second shift so that's why I did it this way.

I made this last night and wasn't impressed at all.  Maybe if I'd made all the changes suggested by others it would've been better, but as it was, the liquid was way too strong with the taste of onion soup.  It wasn't appealing at all.

Entire family loved this recipe.  I used fresh pineapple and replaced the water with pineapple juice.  I also removed the chicken at the end and thickened the sauce a bit with a flour/water mixture.  Served it over rice.  It was a hit.

This is a good recipe for a quick weeknight meal. I served this with Jasmine Rice and tweaked the recipe a bit. I added 2 tbs Brown sugar used the pineapple Juice from the Can, and added 1/2 C of Chicken Broth and 1/2C of Orange Juice. 2 tsp of Corn starch to thicken the liquid. oh I cut up the chicken and added seasoning and garlic to the pan while I sautéed the meat.   Still was good, not great! I would make this again for a quick weeknight chicken meal uses few ingredients and I dont have to dirty up alot of pans

I do not really cook as much as my boyfriend does, but I made this and we both enjoyed it. Instead of 2 cups of water I used 1 cup water 1 cup pineapple juice. I also used one package of soup mix, but next time i think ill use half or i will use thicker pieces of chicken. I served it with white rice and some veggies. I was quite satisfied!

This was an instant hit with my picky husband. I made just a few changes to it as I went. I used one package of onion soup mix, instead of water i used the pineapple juice, I left out the orange, and I used 2 tbs  olive oil. I added some shredded coconut, 1 tbs sugar,  and sprinkled in a little Minute Rice. The coconut and the rice soaked in the flavor and was surprisingly delicious. Will make this one over and over again!

This turned out great! I'd never used the dry soup mix but what a great secret! I know I'll use it alot in the future.  I too added brown sugar, ginger, flour to thicken, and soy sauce.  I browned the chicken in one pan and meanwhile simmered the rest of the ingredients (except for the pineabpple) in another to help the flavors meld together.  Once the liquid came to a boil I poured it over the chicken.  I used 1 cup water, 1 cup pineapple juice.  When I got to simmering I simmered for 15 mins then added the pineapple and squeezed 1 whole orange over the mix and simmered for another 15mins.  For those that complained of bland chicken, I marinated mine in a homemade honey-mustard-garlic mix for a couple of hours.  No blandness here.  Delicious recipe!! - thank you!

I think the recipe panned out very well. I just added more things that I personally like. I don't measure much but this is what I did. I added some scallions, minced garlic, minced ginger, soy sauce, brown sugar and crushed red pepper. Jasmine rice is my favorite so it worked well with that. Thanks!

I used this recipe with my own flare and it was DELICIOUS.  If you put this on your head your tongue would beat your brains out trying to get to it.  This is an excellent dish that requires next to no prep time and cooks very quickly.

By itself this was somewhat bland. I ended up cooking the orange slices in it instead of just using them as garnish in order to give it more flavor. Wasn’t gross it wasn’t impressive either. Probably won’t make it again.

Not bad, but even after a few changes, it was a bit bland.  Changes I made were to use one onion packet, 2 minced garlic cloves, all the pineapple juice from the can of pineapple tidbits and added some orange juice to it to make one cup, half cup water, 1 T brown sugar, 1 T soy sauce. After browning chicken, I added all but the pineapple.  I added the pineapple for the last 15 mins and then added 1T of cornstarch to 2 T water to thicken.  I served with Jasmine rice.  If I made it again, I would want to my sauce to have a stronger flavor.

Pretty good!  We made the mistake of adding some orange slices to the mixture when we added the pineapple.  It wasn't the best idea because it made the dish have a slight bitter after taste.  Despite that I anxiously awaited the leftovers the next day!

Horrible! By frying the chicken in the pan until its done, then bringing it to a boil after you add the pineapple, you are cooking it TWICE. Any cook/chef knows that will produce a tough meat.  The chicken is like chewing leather!! Marinate it in the pineapple first---but DON'T boil your chicken after you add the rest of the ingredients.

Great starter recipe.  I had only 2 whole breasts and 4 thighs.  I followed some of the other suggestions, cut down on the water and used the juice from the can of pineapple.  I eliminated the dry onion soup because that would be too salty for such a small amount of chicken.  I used 1/4 c. chopped onion instead.

Excellent!  I didn't have onion soup mix so I used what I had miso soup mix and it work very well.  I used reviewers suggestions and added T soy sauce and T of brown sugar.  I also add a T of four to my chicken and stir fried it with Seasame oil with garlic and onion for about 5 mins (its just my preference -I like browning my "meats").  The poured the liquid (I used the juice from the pineapple which was about 1/2 C -that was enough because I use 3 skinless boneless thighs (again just a preference; i prefer dark meat) and simmer for 20 mins.  Came out perfect!

I really enjoyed this meal, but my husband was just so-so about it. I would make it again and I think it is a great dish to make. I had frozen pineapple, so I added frozen pineapple at the end, but used orange juice in the mix. It was very tasty.

I thought this was really good.  You definitely definitely need to add the brown sugar, it sortof bridges the pineapple and onion soup mix.  It is a weird combination without the sugar, I added quite a bit to taste.

Overall, not bad.  This was an ok meal to make with ingredients that you would normally already have.  I used this as a quick last minute idea.  The sauce could use a bit more flavor.  I used chicken tenderloins and even though they were smaller cuts of meat, they still didn't pick up much flavor from being cooked in the sauce (next time I'd marinate them beforehand).  They did come out nice and tender however.  I'd make this again with a few adjustments.

Absolutely fantastic! I recommend adding the brown sugar and soy sauce as others have suggested. I also marinate the chicken in some soy sauce along with several different seasonings.

This recipe turned out very poorly.  It was watery and the pineapple could not be tasted.  I agree that it would probably be better spruced up by adding the pineapple juice, less water, a little brown sugar, and something to thicken the broth.

This was quite good, but I did find it a bit runny.  Next time I will add some corn starch or four to the sauce to let it thicken before I top the rice, then it will be great!

Not bad, but not really the flavors I like together.  I only sought out this recipe to use up some fresh pineapple I had in the refrigerator.  The kids didn't like it very much.  I added a bit of cornstarch at the end to thicken up the sauce.

I tweaked the recipe and added garlic, soy sauce and brown sugar per previous member's review and it turned out great!  I only used 1.37lbs of chix breasts and probably should've cut back on the water to 1 cup as the sauce was not thick but the taste was awesome!!  We all loved it!

Thought it was great.  We changed it up a bit as many have.  We only prepared 2 chicken breast and used about 1 package of onion mix.  We wrapped each chicken breast with 2 pieces of bacon and then browned them. Only used 1 cup of water but used the entire can of pineapple and substituted veg oil with olive oil.  Turned out great.  Thinking about using orange zest next time.

Followed recipe exactly, but there was too much liquid. Also, my chicken came out VERY dry. Would recommend placing in the oven and covering with foil, perhaps that would help.

The onion soup was really overpowering. I will try this again, but I will use half a packet of onion soup, plus mix in some of the juice from the canned pineapple.  I also used mandarin oranges instead of a fresh orange.

Update- I used half a pack of onion soup and the juice from the pineapple.  It turned out much better!

This was a hit at our place!  I didn't have onion soup mix on hand, so I just used a tablespoon or so of onion gravy granules.  I mixed the sauce in a separate bowl and let it simmer to thicken before I added it to my chicken.  Then I poured it over and let it cook just a bit to mix the flavors.
I also added a clove of chopped garlic.

Will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing!

Odd combination, but it is quite good. Next time I would use less onion soup mix because it seemed to overpower the pineapple. If I make it again, I will be making the suggested adjustments.

I thought this recipe was delicious.  Never would have thought of the flavor combo.   I added some chopped tomatoes and served it over some healthy brown rice.  Will do again.

I didn't follow this one to the t. Instead of onion soup i added herbed chicken rice of roni, and all the pineapple juice and some water which i shouldn't have cause with the juice it took longer to boil off.
