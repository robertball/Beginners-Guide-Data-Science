This is great, I was skeptical about the pineapple-apricot preserves but ooooooooooo it was good. That must be the secret ingredient, thanks for sharing Jen my family loves it!

My family and I really liked this.  The kids picked the bones CLEAN.  I didn't know whether to take the skin off the chicken or not, so I did my best to sear the thighs first on an electric griddle.  The skin got "fleshy" again after cooking in the oven so next time I think I will skin the chicken first.  (or maybe even deep frying the chicken with a batter on it.  I bet that would glaze deliciously!)  I used ketchup and mayonaisse (not miracle whip!) instead of dressing, peach preserves only, and kinda made up my own "onion soup/seasoning" mix.  I will definitely make this again, thank you!  Very good.

I think this could be a misprint! I've made this many times, but NEVER with Thousand Island Dressing! Use the old fashioned orange French Dressing, and you will really like it!

Wow! What a change of pace for flavor! Weather too hot to use the oven, so made it in the crockpot. Chicken breasts turned out wonderfully moist and tender...made a very nice gravy while cooking. I skillet-browned potatoes before adding to crockpot later. Will definitely make again!

This is good for a nice change.  Next time I will take off the skin.  I used chicken breasts with the bone in.

This recipe was frustrating and then wasnt worth it in the end. I read such great reviews, so I made it tonight. I used chicken breasts (boneless) and drumsticks instead of a whole chicken. The potatoes and sauce I kept exactly the same. After baking for the recipe's 40 and 15 minutes, I had to bake another 35 minutes until the chicken was done. Then the potatoes were still not done, and I even cut them in quarters instead of halves, so they should have cooked even faster. THe sauce in itself has a great flavor. I love the combination. But it didnt really get into the chicken much (maybe it shoudl be marinated first?) and the chicken was SO moist - it was TOO moist. I think these should be browned first b/c the chicken is almost soggy. I think this sauce is a keeper, but it just cant be baked the way it says in the recipe in my opinion. If I choose to use the sauce again, I'll use it with a pork tenderloin, or marinate the chicken in it, and then brown the chicken first before baking it. I'll also bake at 325 first, instead of 300 before upping it to 375. And the potatoes will be separate next time - or cut in even smaller pieces. Too bad! Looked good.

Quick, easy, delicious! My kids loved it and mom and dad, too. I used boneless breasts cut into small pieces and my potatoes were also cut into smaller chunks. Everything cooked through and the chicken was especially moist.

This is definitely not a dish me or my family enojoyed. The chicken was juicy, but the flavor was not something we were used to so it wasn't a big hit.  My picky eaters did not like it. Thanks for the recipe but we will not make this again.

Grating an onion was a blinding experience. I thought this recipe was good but my chicken loving daughter said it was too sweet. My husband said if I liked it I could make it again but he would not look foreward to it.

Sorry about the low rating, but I had a few problems with this recipe.  The potatoes didn't cook enough even though I added and extra 20 mins to the baking time.  Also, the Thousand Island dressing added a funny flavor to the sauce.  I did brown the chicken on the stove first and that helped keep the skin crisp.  But, unfortunately the only thing was liked about the recipe was that the chicken was very very moist.

After reading all the comments about this recipe being so sweet, I built a menu around it to offset the sweetness. However, we didn't  find it all that sweet. It was definitely a different experience; interesting, but whether we love it or not will have to take a couple more times of eating it. Also, my grocer did not have pineapple-apricot preserves, so I mixed a small tin of crushed pineapple with a jar of apricot preserves. We will definitely have it again!

unfortunately my family didn't like this very much. Maybe it's becuase we never use 1000 island and are not used to the taste. Sorry to bring the rating down.

This was a very nice and easy recipe. The dressing gave it a unique and yummy flavor. I didn't add the cinnamon, just a personal preference. It turned out great. Thanks.

My sister-in-law made something similar years ago.  I thought the ingredients were pretty odd.  This recipe is quite good.  A little sweet.  Everyone seemed to like it.
