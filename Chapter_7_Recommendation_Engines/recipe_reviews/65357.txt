I also had the too much flower taste that I couldn't seem to get rid of.  The texture was good, but I think I will stick with my own recipe.  Thanks anyway.

These turned out really soft and had a nice texture.  I used all butter rather than shortening and added a touch of lemon extract to the icing.  I would have preferred a little less of a "flour" taste but overall this was a good cookie recipe.
