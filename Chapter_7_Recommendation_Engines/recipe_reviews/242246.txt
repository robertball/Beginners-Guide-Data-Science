DH wondered what I had put in front of him with this dish.  He found it funny that I had cubed his toast and put it in the bottom of his bowl.  He also wondered why there were cucumbers in his eggs.  Aside from his humor and curiosity - he finished his entire bowl and said "it was pretty good".  A different way to serve breakfast, but it worked.

Very good! I went to the fridge to get the tomatoes and cucumber, and I had no cucumber, so I had to go without, but I will try it next time. Also sprinkled on some fresh cracked pepper along w/ the salt. Very easy and filling breakfast. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I was a little hesitant about cucumber with eggs. As my husband was eating it he says "eggs and cucumber, who knew!" I will definitely be making this again.
