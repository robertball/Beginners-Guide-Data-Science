This is a very yummy cake and frosting.  It was moist and delicious.  The frosting is something I will use on other cakes too.  For this recipe I added 1 tsp of cinnamon to the frosting.  It turned out wonderful.  I WOULD SUGGEST YOU BAKE THE CAKE FOR 20-25 MIN INSTEAD OF 25-30.

Snickerdoodlicious! After forgetting one egg and having a hard time getting the icing to what I considered a good consistency, this cake is fantastic even with those few accidents. Mind you this is the first time I have made homemade icing and decided to give it a go. I think perhaps it calls for a bit too much butter in the icing and not quite enough powdered sugar. So you may want to work a bit with that ratio. I also made my cake in a 9 x 13 glass baking dish and it worked perfect. Otherwise I did this to the letter (except the extra egg of course LOL), and loved it. It does indeed taste like a snickerdoodle. Added to the recipe box.

Good cake, easy to make and it does taste like a snickerdoodle.  I didn't want to wait for butter to soften so I used coconut oil instead.  The cake came out a little dry, but I'm not sure if that is due to my recipe change or 25 min may have been too long for my oven, so I'm not deducting any points for that.  Anyway, it is still quite enjoyable!  I doubled the frosting recipe, which I reccommend for the 2 layer cake because I had just enough frosting left over to do a little piping around the edges and I don't think it would have been enough to cover the cake otherwise.  It was perfect spreading consistency and I didn't even need to add any milk.  But, I think next time I will add more honey and decrease the butter a bit and add some milk or cream to get that good consistency, but that's just a personal preference, most buttercream recipes are too buttery for me.

Very good. Hit of cinnomon and not over whelming. I make them into cup cakes cooking for 20 mins at 350 degrees in a dark pan. Made just under 2 dozens.  Could not get the icing thick enough to stay on the cupcake so make my own whipped cream frosting.

I knew this cake was going to be amazing when the batter was complete - it was a smooth, velvety batter full of flavor. I LOVED this recipe, and that's coming from someone who is pathologically picky about recipes.  I used a 9x13 pan because I was feeling entirely too lazy to layer, and I added pumpkin pie spice (1/2 t.), nutmeg (1/4t.) and doubled the cinnamon (I do this with ANY cinnamon recipe because I LOVE the flavor!). 

Hands down one of my new favorite cakes. Great recipe - thank you for sharing!!!

Nobody cared for this at al. Did not taste like a snickerdoodle, not enough cinnamon and it was very dry even after adding more milk to the batter. Will not be making this one again.

Very good cake, I didn’t use the frosting as my husband doesn’t care for any type of frosting. I think I baked mine too long though because it was pretty dark but still moist and tasty. I used a 9x13” cake pan

I had left over vanilla frosting, so I didn't use this glaze. But otherwise followed the recipe, was easy to make and deliciously cinnamon-y!

I liked the cake, but did not find it as spectacular as others. The rest of the family did not care for it. If I make it again I think I will try substituting half or all of the butter for oil. The texture was a little off for cake and it was a bit too crumbly. A cream cheese frosting would go wonderfully with the flavor of the cake, as it reminded me of cinnamon rolls.

Very tasty and easy to make. HOWEVER, it is very runny as it bakes and goes more out than up.

Snickerdoodle in a cake is an awesome idea!  Cake is delicious.  My icing didn't turn out so great, but that could be my fault!

It was very simple and easy to make. I loved it, as did my family. It didn't last very long!
