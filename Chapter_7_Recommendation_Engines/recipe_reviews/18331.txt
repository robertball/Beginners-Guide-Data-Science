Delicious.  Only change was I added cheddar cheese and used this as filling in pierogies.  My best pierogies yet.  Pierogi dough: beat 1 egg in 1/3 cup water, add 2 cups flour and 1/2 tsp salt.  Rest 10 minutes.  Roll and cut into 3-inch squares.  Flatten and fill a square with the mixture and then fold onto a triangle pressing edges firmly.  Cook in boiling water 3 mins. then toss in pan of heated butter until slightly brown and crisp.  My 7 yr-olds love it and I got spinach and corn in them.  Yes!!!  We had no leftovers for a family of 4 and I even had to make 2 doughs.  Try it.  Yumm. Thank you for the recipe.

We absolutely loved this Michele! As strange as it is, I didn't have any corn in the house, so I had to leave it out. I used frozen chopped spinach, added more seasonings to the potato mixture, (garlic and onion powders and a little cayenne) and added parm cheese. I also sprinkled the top with more parm and some paprika. Once in my casserole dish, I placed it under the broiler for a couple of minutes to brown the top a little. Thanks again for a different way of serving mashed potatos!

Delicious!!!! My family all "icked" at the thought of spinich in the potatoes.....I served this for Easter dinner and increased it to 20 servings - I had 18 people for dinner and we had no leftovers!! The kids and the adults all loved it and wanted the recipe.  I found that after mixing everything together it could remain in the oven in a covered dish before serving and it still tasted fresh.

We loved this!  I used B size Yukon Gold potatoes, which gave this dish a natural butter flavor and subbed in 1/2 and 1/2 and frozen chopped spinach.  I will definitely make this one again.

This recipe is fantastic! I used russet potatoes, and added extra garlic and butter.These only lasted one day! It's a delicious change of pace, and you're serving three vegetables at once.

Yummy potatoes!  This was my first ever attempt at mashed potatoes and I impressed both my husband and myself!  I omitted the corn and used soy milk instead of cream and they were great.

I didn't have fresh spinach on hand, so I tried the recipe with frozen spinach.  The results were not as good as expected.

These were delicious!  I made them for Mr. LTH's & my Thanksgiving potato side and we were not disappointed.  I followed the recipe fairly closely, though I did use white potatoes and skim milk, rather than heavy cream.  I also reduced the butter to about 1/8 C (though, can you imagine how amazing these would be WITH the heavy cream and 1/2C butter?!).  I also used about 1/2 bag of spinach because it seemed like a lot.  And it was.  I'm already looking forward to the leftovers for breakfast....THANKS, Michele!

So good!  My husband was skeptical of the spinach but ended up eating two servings and it took me a while to get my daughter to try them and when she did she loved them too!  Even my 17 month old ate a huge helping!  Thanks for this great recipe and idea!

Loved this variation on mashed potatoes. I did use skim milk instead of heavy cream to cut back on the fat along with fresh corn on the cob.....yummy! Thanks for sharing.

My hubby and I loved these! Prepared with no changes and they turned out perfect. Could not convince the kiddos to try them..they said they smelled great but they couldn't get over the spinach part. Give them a few more years though and I'm sure they will love them as much as we do!

I used flaked potatoes and frozen spinach. My husband loved it, but I thought it had a touch too much spinach. Still a success and rather easy.

These are the best mashed potatoes I have ever made!  This is not only an excellent recipe with the spinach and corn, the plain mashed potatoes are wonderful.  I used 2 ears of corn on the cob, 2% milk, and I used about 7oz of spinach.  I wish I had used all 10oz.  I will definately use this recipe again and again!

Pretty good.  I did not follow the directions on the mashed potatoes, and instead made them the way I make all my mashed potatoes-with 2 tbsp butter, 1/4 cup 2% milk, salt, pepper, and rosemary.  The spinach and corn were definitely a nice change from the ordinary.  Very easy to make and tasty.

It was good, the spinach did nothing for it, good or bad.  i guess its a way of eating spinach, even though my kids wouldn't even touch it after one bite.  We won't be making it again at this house.

This dish is SOOOOO good!  It sounds like a strange combo., but it works!  We had it with pork chops, but it would be fabulous with a grilled steak!  (Actually, it would be fabulous with anything)  If you're looking for something different to try, here's what you're looking for!

YUM! I decided to try this out for Thanksgiving this year and it was a hit. I enjoy the flavor from the spinach that comes out in this classic potato dish! Also... garlic of course made it even better. The corn added a nice texture that sets this dish aside from your average mash. Photo is garnished with some parsley leaves.

Thank you for this one!!!  Always trying to find new ways to sneak spinach and other vegies into things my kids might eat.  I didn't have potatoes so made it with instant. They loved it. Thanks again.

Don't laugh.  I had this in my recipe box for 3 years before I even tried it!  We happened to have a bag of spinach (in fact, two, since we overbought for a recipe), and I used the yukon Golds (which needed about 3 large), and this turned out soooo good!  easy enough for a weeknight dinner, boil the potatoes while you make the main dish!  Thanks for a great recipe!  Glad I finally used it!

So good!! I double the garlic and forgo the heavy cream for whatever milk I have on hand. And yes, the leftovers heat up very well!

Amazing recipe. Very smart way to eat ur spinach and a different twist to mashed potatoes. Everyone loved it :D.  I did not change much, just added some paprika, and used frozen spinach, margarine and 1/3 cup of silk plain soymilk. The result was amazing, will definitely make again, thank you.

We all thought the corn in it was a little weird.  I will make this again, but the family decided minus the corn and add a little more seasonings and/or garlic.  Overall it was pretty tasty!  Even the non-spinach eaters liked it and took seconds.  After it was done, I put a little cheese on top and browned it in the oven.

My husband who doesn't like his mashed potatoes "messed with" actually ate his serving. No seconds for him but that was ok because my toddler licked the bowl clean. 
I didn't have heavy cream on hand so I used regular milk and it was still very good.

Loved it. Husband ate it! I will definitely be making this again. I used Yukon gold potatoes and a bag of baby spinach. YUMMY! I will cut the spinach in medium pieces next time I make it. (The bigger pieces were just too big in my mouth)

Pretty good as written.   I cut the butter down to 1/4 of a cup.   I felt it could have used a little more flavor.   Maybe a little cheddar cheese.

Perfectly delicious as is!  Everyone including the picky 13 year old devoured this dish!  I changed nothing.  Texture was great, taste was lively and filling.  This side fits holiday meals and everyday.  Secret is cutting up the spinach :)

My husband, who is not a big fan of spinach, really enjoyed these potatoes.  That is huge in my book!  I try to add spinach to many recipes, and he usually picks it out.  My DS always mixes his mashed potatoes and corn together, so this recipe was a hit with him, since I had already taken care of the mixing before putting the serving dish on the table!    I made the recipe as written and it was wonderful.  Next time to save a few calories I will use skim milk in place of the heavy cream and cut the butter back to ¼ cup.  Don’t get me wrong……..these are WONDERFUL as written, but I will ‘lighten’ them a bit the next time.  This potato dish was even good warmed up the next day.  I served these with ‘Mini Ham Loaves’ from AR and a simple salad.  We had a very enjoyable meal – thank you Michele O’Sullivan for sharing.

I've made this recipe many times and it's turned out fantastic always. I usually use frozen chopped spinach and frozen corns, reduce the amount of butter and add a little more of olive oil. Sometimes I put this in a oven safe dish, top with mozzarella cheese and bake in the oven. Delicious!

This was a great alternative to plain mashed potatoes! I used it as a topping for ground beef a la shepherd pie. My family liked it so much I tried it with broccoli instead of spinach the following week. It was another winner. Thank you for a very good recipe, Michele!

This is a great recipe! I omitted the cream and added sun dried tomatoes! The next day when I still had some left over, I made them into small croquet - just dipped them in beaten egg, coated it with bread crumbs and fried them in pan.Good Stuff!!! Thanks for this recipe!

At first I was afraid the amount of potatoes was too little, but it turned out to be just right. Next time I will chop the spinach beforehand to make for smaller pieces in the mixture. Overall very tasty!

Very good! I was pleasantly surprised. I made several adjustments though: I used half the butter, and substituted fat free half and half for the heavy cream. I also used baby spinach and only 5 ounces or less. I hate the taste of cooked spinach, but I couldn't even taste it in this recipe! Wonderful! My husband didn't like it--said he could taste the spinach, but I think it was all in his head. I'd make this again, but in two batches--one with spinach, one without.

My husband, who wouldn't even eat spinach before we met, loves this recipe, and my two-year-old can't get enough!  I use a little less butter, milk instead of cream, and slice the spinach up really thin.  We're having them again tonight, and I can't wait!

Good recipe....just add some fresh grated parmesean cheese on tope just before service...We prefer the white shoepeg corn, and we tend to leave the potatoes a little lumpy..May not sound great, but it is...My family loves the textures.

Interesting recipe!  I kind of made this a "leftovers" recipe, using up red and gold potatoes, sauteing onion and a bit of shallot I had left with the corn, and using up buttermilk instead of cream and throwing in some blue cheese that was leftover in the fridge.  Yum!  This would be great with bacon in it or as a topping too.

Nice change from "regular old" mashed potatoes. They taste very good even without gravy. A little too buttery for my taste, maybe next time I'll use a little less butter.

If someone had said this tastes a lot like when your corn ends up in your mashed potatoes because your plate is too full, I’d have probably not made it.  It’s a higher form of that flavor.  If it is the only way you can get spinach into your diet, than it’s an excellent recipe and worth a try.  I also cut up the spinach into smaller pieces as suggested by another reviewer.

This was very tasty. Didn't need to change a thing. The spinach adds a very subtle flavor and some nice color. The corn provides a hint of sweetness and texture. Overall, a very enjoyable side dish.
