I whipped these brownies up this morning after seeing LovestoHost's picture. I used a dark chocolate brownie mix and I subtracted a teaspoon of water and added teaspoon of vanilla to the brownie mixture. I also ran the mini Reese's cup through the food processor before adding them to the brownie mixture. I baked these brownies in my Perfect Brownie Pan--baked at 350* they were done in just over 30 minutes. After letting them cool, we dug into these brownies. HEAVENLY. One of the best brownies we've ever had. It's already over halfway gone.

You really can't go wrong w/Peanut Butter and gooey chocolate, can you?  I have brownie issues (overdone, underdone, crumbly, battery-y, etc), so I decided to try this in mini muffin tins.  They worked ok, but I never nailed the bake time, so some were still gooey and some were overdone. (This will work if you're good w/brownie bake times/doneness.  I, obviously, am not.)  I jumped ship and finished the way the submitter intended, but in an 8X8 pan since I'd used 1/2 the batter.  These worked much better and were delicious.  I used a Duncan Hines box mix since it needed to be a 9X13 sized mix.  THANK YOU for the recipe, Erica!

Made these brownies exactly as the recipe stated with a package of Ghirardelli Chocolate Supreme brownie mix and they were a HUGE hit. Even my health-nut husband ate more of them than I did and requested that I make them again at Thanksgiving for his family. Once again, they were gobbled up before the evening was over. Will make this my default brownie recipe from now on!

If you love chocolate and you love peanut butter cups you will love these brownies. I used Duncan Hines Milk Chocolate brownie mix. Took them to a Christening party and they were all gone in just a 1/2 hour. Will definitely be making these again.

I had such high hopes for this recipe, but it just didn't work out.  The peanut butter part was dry and crumbly, and I thought too much for the amount of brownies.  I didn't really 'swirl' it in too much, so maybe that makes a difference?  Also, I didn't have any mini pb cups so I added some chocolate chips.  I only baked for 35 minutes- at 25 they were still gooey on the edge.  I suppose I should always obey my cardinal rule of brownie making: always underbake them.  If I try it again I would leave out the flour in the pb mix and maybe increase the sugar.  Even the batter tasted odd after I added the flour.  Not sure what went wrong.

This was perfect.   I did what another reviewer said, I eliminated a teaspoon of water and replaced it with a teaspoon vanilla.  probably didn't need to do that.   350 for 32 minutes.   Definitely swirl the peanut butter.  I made sure I really swirled it so there were no clumps of peanut butter.  This is a keeper.

I made these exactly as the recipe stated and they came out perfect. I baked them for 33 minutes. I made them for my son-in-law when his family was visiting for the 4th of July. They got eaten so fast he barely got one! So I made another pan the next day so he could enjoy. If you are a chocolate peanut butter lover this is the recipe for you!

These are pretty good but I don't really taste the chocolate and peanut butter combo.

I tried to make it according to the instructions listed here. It was starting to get dry while I was mixing. I found that I had to add more oil then what was called for. These are amazing and I will definitely be making these again!

I had a bag of generic mini PB cups and found this recipe. I had all of the other ingredients on hand as well. They turned out awesome. Moist and very flavorful. Could easily become my favorite brownie recipe.

Q.  The edges were on the burned side and the middle never got done.  The peanut butter mix was chalky and crumbled.  I never have commented on a recipe before but I am so disappointed after the effort and expense of preparation.

I was craving a rich, melt-in-your-mouth dessert not loaded with oil and sugar so I knew I would have to make it myself. I made the brownies from scratch and then followed this recipe reducing all the sugars, and it was perfect. Actually, cutting some sugar out made it taste richer and more satisfying. I froze half which I will pull out when this craving comes back.

Very rich and a solid recipe - just nothing special.  We were really excited to try this dish and ended up being let down.

Made it today for Easter. Everyone love it. Made it exactly as directed.
