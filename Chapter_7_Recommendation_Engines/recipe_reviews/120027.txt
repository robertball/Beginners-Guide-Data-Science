This is a great stirfry recipe, flavors are excellent!  After you remove the beef from the pan, add the remaining 2 tsp of oil and asparagus and stirfry for 5 minutes, then add water chestnuts and onions, and follow the rest of the instructions.  Quick and easy and sooo good!

This has a good flavor to it but I only rated it a 4 cuz I made some changes. (1) In a small bowl mix 2tsp oil,1 tsp sugar,1 tsp ground ginger,1 tsp ground black pepper, 4 tbsp lower sodium soy sauce, 1 tbsp white vinegar, 1/8 cup chopped green onions . Mix in beef and let stand at least 30 min or overnight in refrigerator.(2) In a large Skillet , brown beef in 2 tsp oil. Add 1 cup beef broth , cook through til beef is tender, then add asparagus , water chestnut and 1/8 cup chopped green onion, simmer 10 min or until asparagus is barely tender .Stir 1 tsp cornstarch in 2 tsp of water. Add to the skillet , stirring constantly until sauce thickened (approximately 5 min). Serve with rice.

This is my friends' favorite recipe. I've done it so many times now! Plus you can really change things up with either the vegetables used or the type of meat, so it never gets old!

Very good flavor. I followed the recipe except added extra vegetable (peppers, celery, carrots) - very quick as are most stir-frys, the most time consuming is cuting the veggies. The sauce had a good consistency to it - many stir-frys I have made are too dry. My 3 year old also liked it but she is a very good eater. This is a great general recipe to use with any beef/veggie combo. Definately will make it again.

Very good!  I simmered the mixture all together for about 15 extra minutes because I like my asparagus tender and soft.  Even my 7 year old liked it!  Will definetly make again.

This was very good however I did not use the water chestnuts and I prepared it with some leftover sliced beef steak.  My only complaint was that the recipe directions were not complete in that they did not state when to add the asparagus but I used my own judgement (considering I did not have to actually cook my meat) and it was fine.

yummy- the vinegar definitely comes through at the end and gives the dish a sour note.  I found it to be a delicious surprise!

This recipe is very good for 3 reasons, no odd ingredients, easy and tastes good. I did leave out the water chessnuts and I also added more ginger. This has extra sauce for your rice which is good as well.

A little too saucy, and yet bland, for my taste.

This recipe was really good and exactly what I had been looking for. The taste of the sauce was perfect. The only changes I made were to the veggies; I'm not a fan of water chestnuts so I ommitted those and used a white onion vs green.

This was a great recipe as is, but also with some changes.  I like to add a small yellow squash and zucchini with the asparagus, and 1/4 - 1/2 tsp. minced garlic in the meat marinade.  This will be a fun one to play around with and will taste like new every time.  Very good recipe.  Thanks!

I put more vegetables in it for leftovers for college lunches!  Easy to make and has a nice light sauce.  Yummy.

This has some good flavors, but overall is a little too salty and the sauce was too thick for my taste.
