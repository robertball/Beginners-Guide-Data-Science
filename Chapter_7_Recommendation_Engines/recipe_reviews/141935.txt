Finally a Waldorf Salad that my mom used to make when I was a little girl, all I remember is that it taste so good and I loved it. Wanted to make it for my kids but could never find the recipe, and mom passed away. Thank you so very much for sharing this long awaited recipe.

I made this salad with honeycrisp apples and cut the sugar to 2 tsp to make up for using sweet apples, then let it sit in the fridge for 24 hours before serving. The dressing didn't taste sweet when I put it in the fridge, but it picked up the sweetness from the apples as it sat overnight. It was wonderful! I'll be making this again & again.

Made exactly as is but used stevia instead of sugar. Loved the crunch and the slight sweetness. I used my homemade mayo (whole egg Mayo here on AR)and to me it tastes so fresh doing that. I would def. consider using raisins, or cranberries if I didn't have dates. Even a touch of pineapple would be super.

Fabulous!  Used a sweet apple because that's what I had; didn't peel.  Added one chopped peach from a can that I needed to use and about a dozen halved grapes I also needed to use.  Didn't have any whipping cream so used 3/4 c. vanilla yogurt and upped the marshmallows to 1/2 c.  Wonderful recipe.  A keeper.
