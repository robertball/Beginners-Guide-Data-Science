Delicious! This definitely satisfies a chocolate craving. I cut the tortillas with a pizza cutter and instead of melted butter, I sprayed them with butter flavored Pam. I baked them at 350 for 8 minutes, turned them and baked for another 7 minutes. They turned out nice and crispy. I melted the chocolate in the microwave vs. a saucepan on the stove. The tortillas would have been great on their own but were even better drizzled with the melted chocolate! Great snack!

The best part of this recipe is how quick and easy it is.  I didn't have any chocolate chips, but drizzled warm chocolate ice cream topping on the "nachos" instead.  My kids loved having a fun, yummy treat for a summer afternoon snack.

Insanely simple, and for what you do and get--delicious.  Making something sweet doesn't hardly get any easier than this...

I love the flavor!  All the yummy goodness of chocolate, but with a surprising though subtle twist with the cinnamon.  Next time I make these I think I will just warm up the tortillas instead of crisping them.  I might increase the cinnamon too. If you are making these for one person note that two tortillas=one serving.  I hope these taste as good tomorrow.

Try with some whipped cream and chocolate or caramel (or both!) drizzle and fresh fruit.  Our favorite is strawberries, pineapple chunks and Bosc pears.

Absolutely amazing! I made this for my family one night, and they loved it! The one one thing I would suggest is don't add the chocolate.
