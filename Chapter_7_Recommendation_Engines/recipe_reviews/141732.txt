I liked this recipe.  It was nice and thick and had a good flavor.  Don't be afraid of the habanero.  It does not make the sauce too hot.  We made bonsai burgers with this sauce. Yum!  I might cut back just a pinch on the ginger next time. But, there will definitely be a next time! Thanks for the recipe!

This is really good. I use it whenever I run out of teriyaki sauce for my stir-fry veggies. The best part is that it's made of all ingredients I always have on hand!

The level of saltiness in this recipe is totally dependent upon the saltiness of the soy sauce you use. If the soy sauce is too salty for your taste, your teriyaki sauce will be too salty too. Some brands of soy sauce have way more salt than others. I find that Kikkoman is very salty, as is Yamasa. I love the flavour and colour of Yamasa, but find it too salty, so I control the saltiness by using different ratios of the dark soy sauce with low sodium soy sauce.

We liked the flavor of this a lot. I added corn starch and more grapefruit juice at the end to thicken (and to sooth the saltiness a bit). Thanks!

I used this in a pinch when I was out of bottled Teriyaki (randomly, I did have all the stuff for this recipe...) and it worked out great.

This is good stuff.  But it is awfully salty.  I will use lite soy next time.  Also did not have rice wine vinegar or a habenero.  I used rice vinegar on hand.  I like it better than bottled teriyaki.
