I enjoyed this. was easy to make. For my taste there was not enough spice to balance the sweet in the chicken and slaw. I am going to add a few shakes of red pepper flakes to leftovers

The title of this recipe is misleading to me.  These are not burgers, in my opinion. I really enjoyed this recipe, however I only used half of the chicken called for, but used the full amount of the sauce.  I also took a cue from a previous reviewer and added a few shakes of red pepper flakes to add a bit more spiciness.  With these changes, I would definitely make this recipe again and I'm certainly glad I didn't overlook it based on the title!!  :)  Thanks for sharing your recipe, CINDYJAKE!

We made this and used 3 cans of Sam's  chunk chicken (drained)  in place of the fresh chicken and it was great! Looked the same and as great!
