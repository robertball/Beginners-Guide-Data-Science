This dish was a hit at my office potluck!  As the other cooks suggested, I added onions.  I also doubled the garlic amount and added a small pinch of seasoned salt to bring out the flavors.  I highly recommend this recipe!

Exceedingly nice recipe. You eat it and feel like you're glowing, it's so healthy and delicious. Changes I have made include: more garlic, using dried basil and oregano at the start, and then adding the fresh herbs (basil and cilantro) at the very, very end, so they retain their flavor. Served with wild rice with butter, lemon, and cilantro, it's absolutely devine.

We felt very heathy eating this yummy veggie meal.  I served it over angel hair pasta with a little bit of feta sprinkled on top.  Tasted great, but the veggies were a little softer than I like.  Steak and potatoes dad liked it alot.

PERFECT!!! I didn't have fresh herbs, used dry and everything was fine. I threw in a yellow squash and some halved black olives ... I don't cook with salt, and thought that this dish had so many great flavors it didn't need it. Fresh cracked pepper on top finished it off. I eat it in a bowl as a main dish.

I have no idea how this turned out so well.  It was incredible.  I added some cayenne pepper, it was so great.  I have never had a veg dish this good!  I always use mushrooms AND onions.  This is not only a fav of mine, but everyone who has tried it has loved it.  I am not a "veg" person, but this dish is incredible.  YOU MUST TRY THIS!!

This dish tasted fantastic, once I tweaked it to my liking :)  I added 3/4 cup of onion, and sauted it with 3 garlic cloves in just 1 tbsp of olive oil.  Once that browned up a bit, I added fresh grated ginger :), then I cooked the recipe accordingly.  After everything cooked up nice and hot, I added a pinch of salt and pepper.  ALSO, your nutritional info is WAY off.   Cal - 206;  Total Fat - 6g;  Carb - 32g; Fibre - 9g;  Sugars - 2g;  Protein - 9g

This was not very good.  I served it wrapped in tortilla wraps with some sour cream and that seemed to help but I don't think that I will make this again.  Sorry.

Delicious! Tailor ingredients to your preferences. I omitted oregano & cilantro, increased garlic to 4 cloves, and served with instant brown rice & Romano cheese. Very healthy, since rice and legumes like garbanzo beans make a complete protein. My teenager liked it in a soft tortilla with mozzarella cheese. If you steam the zucchini in a large frying pan with a cover til crunchy, you don't need to use a lot of olive oil. Took a sample to work and everyone wanted the recipe.

Not spectacular, but reasonably good. I didn't like how the garbanzos retained their canned-bean taste. I think it would have been better made with dried garbanzos. Mine was somewhat bland also, and could have used some salt. I'd probably make this again.

This was great! I used dried spices (half the amount)instead of fresh because thats what I had on hand. Even though I over cooked my Garbanzos (I used dried instead of canned) and undercooked the zucchini, it was very tasty. I bet it is amazing when everything is cooked right!  Its also great in a pita!  My boyfriend and I fought over the leftovers for lunch. Next time i will have to make more!

So easy yet so yummy! I tend to quadruple or quintuple garlic in most recipes I try, and did the same with this one (and loved it!). I didn't have cilantro, so I skipped it, and didn't have fresh tomato, but used canned instead. As I was letting the tomato warm at the end, I sprinkled the whole thing with some cheddar and mozzarella. Definitely will be making this again!

A wonderfully recipe - it can be fearlessly adapted, and it is filling, healthy and tasty. With extra vegetables (chopped carrots, sugar snap peas, and baby corn) and slightly more garbanzo beans this was a perfect one dish meal. I used dried garbanzo beans and cooked them until still slightly crunchy, and like other users added soy sauce and squeezed lemon juice to finish.

This was very bland as written. I added fat free chicken broth and 1/2 tsp sea salt. Not sure if I'll be making this again.

Added onions and cayenne pepper.  Also used dry instead of fresh herbs Subed the fresh tomato for about a half of a can of diced tomatoes.  This was okay...  Not the best - but also not the greatest.  I generally like something with a sauce base more.

I doubled the spices and added a little chili garlic Rooster Sauce and liked this enough to make it again. The zucchini should go in later though, otherwise it gets too soft.

I was looking for a healthy, easy meal for lunch. Boy, did I hit the jackpot! My 14 month old daughter and I ate the whole thing, and may have eaten more if we could.
The only thing I did different was add a small amount of table salt at the end. Delicious! We will have this a lot in the future. Thank you, JDS, for sharing a wonderful recipe.

I decided to make this dish because it sounded good to me but I thought out of my family of 6 I would be the only one and would have lots of leftovers.  We ended up eating everybit and could have used some more.  Very tasty!

This turned out great even without some of the ingredients. I used dried herbs and had no cilantro but added a spicy stir fry sauce. Then found we had no mushrooms but found a bag of frozen peas. Served it over white rice and the children all loved it.

Very delicious and easy. You can really make this with any vegetables but keep the spices the same. I didn't have zucchini so I used a bag of frozen stir fry vegetables. Still tasted great!

I can't believe how simple and delicious this is!  I used all dried seasonings, added onions instead of mushrooms and used it as a filling in some homemade tortillas.  It was really good and easy.  I'll be making this often.

It wasn't outstanding, but it get's the added 4th star for being quick and easy. I sauteed red onion and garlic to start and then added zuchini, squash, sliced portobellas - used dried italian seasoning and fresh cilantro. I also added a little chicken broth and let it steam for a bit. The veggies stayed crunchier - while the shrooms cooked. I served it over quinoa.

Awesome recipe and both the boyfriend and I loved it! The only changes I made were to add onions when cooking, and to squeeze fresh lemon juice over top of the stirfry once served. Definitely making again, especially since it is so versatile in terms of the kinds of veggies you can add to it.

The fresh herbs in this recipe make all the difference-so yummy and flavorful. I ended up making a few modifications to suit my taste: added a bit of red pepper, added a potato to the rest of the veggies, and I ended up throwing in some red wine and pasta sauce to liven it up a little more. I will make this again and again!

I was a little hesitant about this recipe but it was great.  I didn't use fresh herbs and it was still really tasty.  I also substituted green onions in place of the cilantro. I'll definitely be making this again!

Really tasty, even using dried herbs.Careful not to overcook--perhaps add canned garbanzo beans after zucchini , with the mushrooms, as they only really need to be heated.

This was really, really good!  However, I altered the recipe a bit by adding onions, more mushrooms, Italian seasoning, chopped cabbage, and halved cherry tomatoes instead of a chopped tomato.  I also added some leftover wine I had (about 1/2 cup). We had this in warmed pita bread with some finely shredded pizza cheese (mozzarell & cheddar blend).  Will definitely have it again!

Yummmmm!  This was great.  I didn't have any zucchini, so i just omitted it and used two tomatoes instead.  Also, replaced most of the fresh herbs with dry.  It was really a nice dish, very light and great with brown rice.

This was good tasting, but nothing spectacular.  Of course, I ommited the basil since I forgot to pick it up at the store, so I'm sure that made some difference!  Very quick and easy, though, and healthy too, of course.

Though my husband loved this dish, I thought the oregano and basil overpowered it. He also said there was a little something missing, so when re-heating it we added pepperoni and salt.

I added beef strips and rice vermicelli to the recipe.  I noted through cooking it that it was drying out due to the noodles and I added some hot sauce, light soy sauce, and a little oyster sauce to provide some moisture.  Not bad, but will try again following the regular recipe and using it as a side veggie dish.

This recipe has a unique taste to it and is was enjoyable as a side to main dish.  I think the cook time is a little too long as the chick peas became rather mushy, but this merely a visual criticism.

Wow! It has been a while since I made something this good. It was very easy to prepare and tasted great. I used italian seasoning instead of fresh herbs and instead of measuring just added a generous amount. I am not a vegetarian but this is a meal in itself. My toddler son loves the garbanzo beans and since I am pregnant they are a great source of protein for me.The zucchini and tomato came from my garden and the whole dish tasted fresh and delicious.  I am not bragging about my skills as a cook because that's not why this tasted so good. It's because of the fresh ingredients prepared in a natural way. Someone could be a beginner cook and make this well.

This recipe was great.  It turned what could be a bland, though healthy meal, into an interesting and delicious one.  I fed it to my entire book club one night and it was unanimous that everyone loved it.  I cut the oil in half and added soy sauce in its place.  Very very good.

I'm not a huge fan of garbanzo beans, but this was really good. I added onion and corn and left out the mushrooms. I plan on eating this throughout the week for lunch with some rice, so I used a can of diced tomatoes that I drained. With some rooster sauce this is fantastic.

I don't use mushrooms, add onion and omit spices depending on what I have on time and it is a consistently great meal.  I usually heat up some corn tortillas with a slice of pepperjack and use this as a taco filling.  So good.

this turned out pretty bad. This recipe has potential but definately not "as is". I felt like  spent a lot more money than was necessary on fresh herbs for something to taste this bad.

Did not use fresh Basil (none in store), or fresh cilantro (girlfriend doesn't like) so I used dried basil. Found the dish to be lacking in flavour. Next time, I'll add the suggested raisins and maybe curry or something else to beef up the flavour. GREAT on the calories and cost, ($11.00).

I added a little onion, used fresh basil but dried oregano because that is all I had, just about 1/4 cup mushrooms and doubled the garlic(minced garlic not fresh). I served it over brown rice and added a little feta and crushed red pepper like some other reviewers said. Served it for lunch to husband, 4 year old and 2 year old and myself. My 2 year old didn't like it but the rest of us did

I added onions and used broccoli instead of mushrooms. I also skipped the tomato and cilantro. Came out delicious! Will definitely make this again. I even served it with mashed potatoes, and it worked. Very versatile.

The only recipe change I made was doubling the garlic.  The dish was O.K.  It's best attribute is that it's healthy.  Even with the garlic doubled I didn't taste it.  Do not understand where the 30 minutes of cook time comes from.  The recipe directly accounts for 10 minutes with the rest of the cooking time not directly stated.  I cooked it a total of about 17 minutes and the zucchini was a bit mushy.  The suggestion made by other reviewers of adding onion will undoubtedly improve this dish but I try to base my review on the original recipe.  Will try again with some changes.

Really good after some alterations. I wish I would have added the fresh herbs and garlic near the end because their flavor was not very pronounced. I added some mung bean sprouts for some crunch and ate it over brown rice. At first I found the dish a little bland so I added some soy sauce and Siracha hot sauce. I think I'll try it again with onions.

Yum!  Used dried basil and oregano, still came out wonderful.  Added cayenne pepper and a splash of lemon juice at the end.  Veggies were a little overcooked-next time I might reduce cooking time a bit.  Overall, great recipe!

Very tasty. Nothing beats the good taste of fresh herbs. I will make it again. I have the herbs right in my backyard! How convenient!

Tried it as originally written and far too bland for our tastes. I do agree with other reviewers that it provides a good "jumping off" point. To save the meal I served with sour cream and a bit of curry sauce over brown rice and it was delicious. Next time I would double the garlic and add onions, as many have suggested.

This turned out great! My son and I loved it. The oregano was a little too much flavor for my husband, but he tends to be a plain meat and potato man! I added onion and increased the garlic by a clove or so. I also tried melting cheese on it as previous reviews mentioned and it was great both with and without it!

I was a bit disappointed with this one. Came out very bland. Definitely needs salt or some shredded cheddar or mozzarella sprinkled on top. Seems like it was missing something. However, was easy and quick to throw together and quite healthy.

It felt bland to me, but I also forgot the mushrooms, so that could have attributed. It was quite good when eaten in a tortilla with some medium-hot salsa and white rice, however.

4 stars because it wasn't flavorful enough for me. However I added homemade tomato sauce to the finished stir fry and it was amazing. I've made this dish at least three times in a month.

What an amazing dish! I added carrots to the zucchini and sauteed them in olive oil before adding the beans. I used the same herbs and spices, but not the exact measurements. Spice to your own taste and it won't disappoint!

This really was a great recipe after adding some sirloin strips and a little ground beef for flavor.  Not being big on zucchini, I decided to take the opportunity to add a little bit of ground spicy sausage.  The flavors of the meat melted together with the tomatoes and mushrooms.  I also reduced the amount of each herb used so as to not overwhelm the flavor of the meat.  bon appetite!!

great recipe! If you are in the mood of meat, add some steak stripes, but cook them separately, so they wont absorb all the herbs flavor. A little bit of lemon juice add then end gives it an interesting touch!

Very easy to make, light and refreshing. I added onions, and halved cherry tomatoes instead of a regular tomato. Finished it off with lemon juice. Loved it!

This is a simple dish that I liked a lot...it was very tasty.  The most time-consuming part was chopping up all the herbs (I learned a trick - cut the leaves off the stalks, put them into a small cup then, using scissors, snip away   at them until evenly chopped.)  Other than that it was quick and easy.  I didn't have any mushrooms, so didn't add those.  (I love mushrooms, so I can imagine that this dish will be even better next time I make it -- I'll make SURE that I have some on hand.)  I may also add more tomatoes.  Thanks for the recipe!

The flavors in the stir-fry were very mild.  Although we weren't blown away, we would make it again.  It's a good side-dish, especially for a more Mediterranean dish.

This was pretty good.  I added a bit of salt and scallions but you can't even taste it.  The tomato gives most of the flavor.  It's a really healthy and delicious meal.  I served it with parmesan risotto but I think something like tomato basil risotto would be a better match.

This recipe sounded really delicious. I followed the directions precisely but it seemed very dry and bland. I would recommend not cooking the beans and zucchini together (maybe my skillet wasn't big enough?) and adding more garlic. Probably won't make it again.

This recipe was ok, nothing earth shattering or anything, but I happened to have the ingredients on hand and they needed to be used, so I made it.  The best compliment I can give is that it's paletable. There are better uses for these ingredients, IMHO.

I used portabello mushrooms and this tasted incredible.  I concur with another reviewer -- i'm not sure why it tasted so good but it did!  Maybe it's all the spices.  This is also great for the calorie conscious!

This is one of the best zuchini dishes I have ever had.  I used onions instead of mushrooms, and canned tomatoes instead of fresh.  We sprinkled grated parmesan on it at the table, but it was just as good without.  I also added a little salt.  Great recipe!!!

when i made this recipe for a pot luck dinner, it turned out a bit bland, and was not the hit of the event. adding some salt made it better, and i did enjoy the leftovers.

What a winner!Slightly sceptical about chickpeas at first, the end result was a delicious combination of flavours that was enjoyed by the whole household - even sworn meatlovers! Lots of room for additions to tasta, as well.

A great recipe. I used onion (as recommended in another review) instead of mushrooms and parsley instead of cilantro (we didn't have any), and it still tasted great (no leftovers).

I, too, was a bit skeptical about how it would taste, but it turned out fantastic. I used italian seasoning instead of basil and used a few dashes of parsley instead of cilantro. I also added a few teaspoons of soy sauce. Yummy.

I was a bit skeptical about how tasty this would be, but it was easy to make and totally delicious!Next time, I'll probably add more mushrooms and onions, but it's excellent as is.

I Loved this!  Very quick and easy to make.  The thought of a garbanzo stir-fry
did not particularly sound delicous to me, but once I started smelling the aroma
while cooking this, I knew it was going to be great!  
I did omit the mushrooms, because I am not a fan...I added half a chopped white 
onion and a couple pinches of sea salt.  Mmmm!

Great recipe! Added onions- fried them up first- then mushrooms with the herbs . Served in pita pockets topped with feta crumbles. This recipe served my husband, me and our 18 year old son only. We polished it off in one sitting.

A good side dish when you're tired of the same old vegetables. As it cooked, I added white wine rather than more oil; it added more flavor without more fat.

Read other reviews and added: 15 oz can Italian bean mix, 1/2 small cubed eggplant, 
1 red onion diced, 1/2 red pepper cubed, used dried oregano and basil 1 teaspoon of each, small pack of fresh cilantro and served with Beyond Meat sausages.
Very good and healthy! Will definitely be making this recipe again and trying other veggies and beans.

I made this recipe exactly as stated but added 2 cans of chickpeas (for a family of 4). Everyone loved it and had seconds. This is such a quick and easy meal to make. I made white rice with it. Thanks for a great recipe.

I love this as it was easy to make. I did change it up a bit as I omitted the mushrooms and black pepper, both because of personal preference. I did add onion though and an orange bell pepper for taste and color. I definitely will make this again.

I added sliced/chopped onion and it worked well! I also left out the Cilantro as my brother dislikes it and the recipe still worked very well. I love this recipe and dish as it is easy, pretty quick to prepare and cook, easy on my stomach, healthy, and tastes amazing!

I had to leave out the garlic due to an allergy but I substituted an onion, as I almost always do.  I also had to add quite a bit of salt, but it turned out well.

I stuck to the recipe-the only thing I did was add onions, more garlic and cooked accordingly to recipe.  I noticed it was getting dry and the beans weren't getting tender so I added some white  wine vinegar which gave it a nice flavor and I also added jalapeno cheese at the end for a bit of spice. love it!

I enjoyed this dish. I used dried basil and oregano Instead of fresh. I was looking for a recipe including  chick peas.  I added onions,  red pepper,  carrots, a handful of golden raisins, and doubled the garlic. I coupled it with whole grain pasta. I will be making this again!

I didn't include the herbs in the beginning; I added black pepper and dried parsley along with cucumber (instead of zucchini), red belle peppers, chickpeas, mushrooms, and tomatoes. It turned out alright though it wasn't amazing. I did decrease most of the cooking times because I thought it would make everything too soft for my taste. I also added a teaspoon of red chilli powder for a little more taste. I don't know if I'll be making this again but if I do, I would add onions and maybe I won't skip the herbs.

I added onions which are a must and it was cooked properly, it wasn't soggy or otherwise unappealing. It just wasn't that tasty. I thought it was ok but my kids were definitely not fans. For that much chopping and prep, I want something delicious. I'm not sure what to add or change to give it that...

My version came out a little dry so I added some avocado and hot salsa to the final dish and it was pretty darn amazing and I never say "darn". I'm not a big mushroom guy but it was pretty tasty. I would definitely recommend.

Very good. I did not have fresh oregano or basil so I used dry. Added a little more olive oil halfway through.

This was a delightful recipe. I used onion instead of mushrooms because it's what I had on hand. It was simple and made good use of the veggies I needed to use up.

Kind of bland.  The chickpea mix before adding the other things was nice.

Loved this.  I changed it a little.  Added an onion and a little chicken broth at the end to give it some juice. Then I served it over rice.  Yummy and healthy.
