Best stew recipe I've tried so far. Omitted the peas and doubled the potatoes and it was just right!

Great recipe for a cold day...I added a couple cloves of garlic and browned the meat in oil before putting it in the casserole.  I also added a half an onion, which becomes sweet in the oven.  I mixed the water with the soup before pouring it over the whole thing.  *one other thing* as a person with celiac sprue, I substituted 2 Tbs. of tapioca for the flour, as a thickener.  I will use this recipe again!

I like the addition of the onion soup mix. I substituted corn & green beans instead of peas. I also added more water. Thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe - thanks Jo!  I used this as a starting point but I browned the beef ahead of time.  Also substitued beef boulion instead of french onion soup (I'm an American in the UK and it's difficult to find certain ingrediants).  I added a dash of red wine, parseley, 2 bay leaves and garlic powder, then stuck it all in the oven for 2 1/2 hours.  Turned out amazing and was extremely easy to make!

This is the best stew I've ever had!  It definately didn't have enough liquid for me though so I doubled the amount of water.  I also used all frozen veggies except the potatoes.  I also used cut up marinating steak instead of the stewing beef to cut out some of the fat.  I also didn't have stewed tomatos so I used canned diced and it worked well.

i made this yesterday, I was very happy with the results! so quick, easy and tasty!! i used frozen peas and carrots about a cup and a half and this worked out great, although i still used about 3 fresh cutup carrots as well!  my 18 year old vegetarian sun loved the flavour the carrots had (he picked them out of the left over stew) there was very little left over though!  anyway i probably only cooked the stew at 375 for bout 45 minutes and it started to lose a lot of liquid by then everything was nicely cooked and ready to eat.  so i didn't bother adding more liquid, delicious on a wet and cold night! the little bit of left over was great (even with out the carrots!)   thanks!

So good and so easy! Why didn't someone tell me 20 years ago that you can make great stew in the oven? I made no changes except for adding peas late because I wasn't sure I was going to use them.

I added turnip to this recipe instead of the peas, it was the best stew I have ever made. My husband and I had 2 servings each, it's great.

This stew had a lot of flavor. I didn't have a roasting pan with a lid so I just made it in a 13x9 inch backing pan and covered it with foil. Next time I make it I will add more liquid.

I made this with grass-fed beef which cooks quicker, so reduced the temp. by 50 deg. Otherwise, followed the directions exactly. It turned out perfectly!!! Whole family loved it, including my 3 and 5 year olds!! We will make this a lot!!!

It's yummy and easy to make. I would try it with a can of corn added in the last 15 minutes or so as well.

This is very similar to the stew my mom has always made.  It is a good, classic recipe.  I use diced tomatoes (just a personal preference) and I also wait and add frozen peas for the last 30 minutes. Keeps them from getting mushy.

Excellent meal for a cold winter day.  I'm new to cooking but I could easily follow this recipe.  My roommate actually begged for me to feed him when he smelt this!

This stew is amazing and so easy and fast to put together. I used tapioca to make it gluten free and used canned diced tomatoes and canned mushrooms. This will be my go-to recipe for stew from now on!

We added, as others recommended, a can of corn and additional water.  We also added about 1/2 cup of celery for flavor.  Excellent dish.  We will make it again.

Lacks flavor because there are no spices in it.  However it is VERY easy to make

I made this do exactly as described and it was fabulous. My family gobbled it up and no leftovers. It makes a nice light gravy while cooking too. Highly recommend.

Just took it out of the oven and boy does this house smell wonderful!  I pretty much followed the recipe but followed some other reviewers' advice about a couple of things.  I mixed the onion soup with the water before pouring it in the pan and I increased the water by 1/4 cup.  I added salt and pepper to the flour. I omitted the green peas and added a couple of extra potatos.  Totally delicious!  Thank you for posting.

Although browning the meat on the stove top still develops the best flavor, this high-heat oven "browning" was a great compromise, and much less messy.  Thanks for sharing this technique.  The instructions didn't call for it, but I covered my pan during the first 30 minutes to prevent splatters in my oven.  Next time, I will probably add the salt to the flour so that the fond (browned bits) have more flavor. The recipe can easily be adjusted for whatever vegetables you have on hand/in the freezer.
