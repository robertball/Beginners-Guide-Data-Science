I made this for thanksgiving desert and it is quite simply the best apple pie I have ever made. The recipe is simple and easy to make and the results are just WOW!! The only thing I changed was to the topping I used a cup of crushed walnuts. This pie is a real pleaser to the pallet!!

my son woke up in the morning and wanted to spontaneously make apple pie for the whole family. we had the smallest amount of sugar left in the house so i searched and found this recipe using sweetened condensed milk, and we gave it a try. reading the reviews i was pleased to hear that it was too sweet and we could give it a go with only half the amount of sugar. so we made the pie only using the 1/3 cup sugar that is added to the top crumble, followed all the rest of the directions precisely - cooked for 30 minutes without the crumble and 40 minutes with the crumble added- and lo and behold, what a perfect pie. my older son has dubbed it Mom's Famous Apple Pie. it wasn't too runny, it wasn't too sweet. it was absolutely delicious and perfect. my husband whipped up some cream to put on top and gave everyone a slice and tried to run away with the rest of the pie in the pie dish. 
we decided that we are going to add it to our christmas menu this year and they are all wondering why we didn't know about this walnut apple pie all along. so so good, thanks for the recipe.

I followed the recipe--and some of the suggestions from previous reviewers--which I think made this fantastic.  I added 1 tsp of cornstarch to the apples when mixed in with the brown sugar and cinnamon.  Also, like the reviewers suggested, I used less brown sugar both when mixed in with the apples and cinnamon (and cornstarch) and less brown sugar with the flour and walnuts mixture.  Finally, we used Matsu apples--from a local orchard--and they were just perfect!

Absolutely Delicious! So easy to make and melts in your mouth.
I've made several times and I do add a teaspoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of cornstarch in the apple mixture for added flavor and to prevent the pie from being runny.  This receipe is my favorite go to anytime!

Definitely will make it again. "Delicious"!!
Added nutmeg, allspice,  and vanilla extract. 

Will likely increase the walnuts next time, or consider pecans.

I have just used this recipe. I don't know if i did something wrong, but the filling was seeping juice possibly from the fruit. Should i use this again, i will add a tbsp of cornstarch.

This was amazing. I did add 1 tbsp of cornstarch to the apples when mixing them, I also sprinkled in some pumpkin pie spice to the apples and in the topping. The best pie Iâ€™ve ever had. Will be making it for thanksgiving. I used Mcintosh apples though and they worked perfect.

Tasted yummy once I baked it for another 40 minutes.  Maybe it was the kind of apples I used and the fact that I forgot to add the cornstarch many recommended.

This has become my favorite recipe for apple pie.  I use Granny Smith apples and add a tablespoon of cornstarch, as suggested by another reviewer.  For the record, it also makes a delightful  Caramel Apple PECAN pie!

This was a great recipe! There was a couple things I did differently though. For starters, I used Granny Smith Apples instead of any red apple. Then I made more of the crumb topping! Brought it for family dinner and there was none left at the end!!

Really good taste, but too sweet (and I even cut the sugar in half).  I also made it with a wheat pie crust. Will make again, but will use even less sugar!

The taste of the pie is delicious; however, the filling never thickened and is very runny. Not a very good pie to serve to guests. Maybe I did something wrong, not sure. It's even been refrigerated to thicken, but will not. I followed recipe exactly.
