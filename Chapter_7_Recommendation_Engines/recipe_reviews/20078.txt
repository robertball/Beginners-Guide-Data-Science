Just a hint about zucchini: if you sprinkle salt on the grated zucchini and let it sit for about 30 minutes in a strainer it will release a LOT of excess water.  Pat it with some paper towels then make the pancakes.

In response to the criticism that the "pancakes" do not hold together:  the challenge is not with the recipe it's with expectations set up by the name pancakes.  This is a recipe for a "latke", a yiddish word that is loosely translated as pancake.  A latke is not a flour pancake, it is a vegetable pancake-like thing.  Latkes don't hold together like a smooth pancake, even when made with potatoes - instead they have bits of vegetable that stick out, turn crispy, fall apart.  So, you have to imagine you're living in Eastern Europe to enjoy this simple vegetable recipe or, if you really want a pancake, add flour and egg.  Good luck!

I gave this a 3 as is but made it again today with some additions/changes and give it a 5 now!  I added 2 beaten eggs to the zucchini and onion mixture and held off using the salt until one side was browned.  When I drained the zucchini and then added the sale as per directions I had a soupy mess.  I also browned in extra virgin olive oil with a little butter and it intensified the flavor-great!

Here's the trick to perfect zucchini pancakes much like potato pancakes.  To 3 cups grated zucchini, add 1/4 cup Bisquick and 1 egg.  I also saute some onions.  Add salt and pepper to taste as well as Italian seasonings, and 1/4 cup of grated parmesan cheese.

These are great!  Although I must admit that I did throw in a few extra ingredients, cause I was afraid it might be a little bland.  So I threw in some crushed red pepper, garlic salt and parmesan cheese.  They were so good and I even burnt the 2nd batch a little bit and they were really good burnt!!  A good tip for draining all the water from the zucchini is to wrap it in a tea towel and wring the towel.

We really enjoyed the flavor of this. I didn't expect to get true "pancakes," so I just sauteed everything together in a big bunch and got it nice and browned. I used grapeseed oil instead of butter, and fresh oregano. Add some grated potatoes and this would make a delicious hash.

I think this is a delicious way to prepare zucchini...not bland at all.  In addition to the oregano, I did add a sprinkle of seasoned salt to the mixture and topped the "pancake" with Colby Jack cheese before serving.  I used one reviewer's method of allowing the grated zucchini and onion to sit in a colander for 30 minutes to drain and that seemed to work very well for me.

Made this recipe two nights ago for the hubby.  I did drain the zucchini and onion in a collander as well as damped it with paper towels.  We thought that this was a good base recipe to start out with; however, I would not make it the same way again.  I would add a bit to it:  a little egg and a little flour (but not enough to qualify as a full-blown pancake), parmesan cheese, and some sort of tomato-based relish for the top.  Again, while we enjoyed it well enough the other night, I would use this to branch off for something more tailored to my family's liking.  Consider this a good foundation.

I'm really glad I tried this recipe. Hubby and I loved them. Sonny, not so much. He got one that had quite a bit of oregano. The oregano flavor really comes out in this dish. We had this with the Cheesy French Toast (submitted by tassiedevil) Delicious.

This was a soggy gross mess. It didn't stick together at all so I had to add egg. After the egg, it did stick together, but it was still a soggy gross mess. And I squeezed a ton of water out as best I could, salted it to leech out more water, etc. How did anyone get this to work? Horrible- I threw the whole batch out. What a waste of ingredients!

It is seldom I just can't finish eating something I make, but this was just not something I could handle. The only way I could think of that this might be valuable is layered with tomatoes as a quiche filling, otherwise I wouldn't recommend.

This recipe didn't work for me - it fell apart when I tried to flip it, even though it was cooked on that side. There was nothing holding it together.

i haven't tried this recipe yet - i'm planning on it - but i've made something like it and i think it would help to add a beaten egg and a tablespoon or two of flour. also make sure to squeeze as much liquid out of the shredded veggies as possible before mixing everything together.

I was sure that I am going to try these without any addition cause I thought thhese wouldn taste great. But unfortunately, these need to be sprinkled with some flour. Good taste though. I don't think I would make these often.

Family loved them.  I tweaked a bit - I used a bit less flour and added panko breadcrumbs instead.  I also added some shredded baby carrots to the mix. My son topped his with 1000 Island dressing - sounds weird but added a nice choice.  Will be making again very soon.

I liked this a lot.  I modified significantly.  In addition to the 2 eggs, I added basil, marjoram, sea salt, pepper, paprika, four cloves of garlic in the processor with the onions and half a cup of corn meal.  Draining in a colander for thirty minutes was very helpful, thanks to the reviewer who suggested it.

Loved the simplicity of the recipe and how delicious it turned out!  It works great for the Whole 30 diet with just substituting Ghee for butter.  Yum!
