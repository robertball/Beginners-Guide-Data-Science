I misjudged this one, big time.  I so wish I could give this an "average" three star rating but I REALLY didn't care for this at all.  This recipe proved to me that turkey cutlets warrant a lighter sauce than this tomato-based sauce with sooooo much, too much, going on.  A few simple ingredients, as is often the case, are best.  I didn't even add the lemon juice and brown sugar, which seemed very incompatible - had I made those additions I know I would have disliked this even more.  The turkey was all but lost in this one.

This was very good and used items I had on hand.  I used a cup of diced canned tomatos instead, increased the mushrooms and omitted the lemon juice.  After browning the cutlets I added them to the sauce, covered and continued cooking until turkey was cooked through.  I pre-seasoned the turkey with salt, pepper and garlic powder before cooking and the sauce reduced down a bit during cooking to intensify the flavors. I would definately make this again.

I used turkey medallions. The sauce was good but don't think I would make this again as no one raved about it.

Pretty good. The brown sugar could have been left out, to be honest. With a couple sides like corn and potato salad, this makes for a good meal.

OK...I hate it when people take a recipe and totally change it.  HOWEVER, I had to this time.  I used what I had.  Recently, my husband went hunting and came home with 3 HUGE bucks.  Needless to say, I have deer meat out the rear.  I chose deer meat cutlets for this.  Cooked it just like it said.  I did use a bit of olive oil with a bit of butter to help with my health!  I made the sauce without rosemary, since my husband failed to tell me he used it all already, and I had no mushrooms.  Everything else was the same.  Being that I had to omit some of the ingredients, and it still turned out AWESOME, I had to give it 5 stars!  My husband just stood there eating and eating before even sitting down at the table.  Will do again and again!!!
