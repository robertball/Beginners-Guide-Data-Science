I altered the recipe somewhat, we are not big fans of celery, so I left it out. I did not have the lemon juice or corn flakes so that got left out too. I did however top with a pound of cooked bacon. My family wants it again!!!

Had leftover lemon chicken and added the sauce to the “soup” which was a GF white sauce with chicken broth, poultry seasoning and lemon pepper. Did not add the additional lemon juice. Tasty! This is a mild dish. Maybe next time with peas as another suggested.

Followed directions but it lacked flavor.  My husband grabbed the pepper and I did not feel it was worth the effort.

Great Recipe.  Easy to modify to suit you tastes and still works out. I halved the mayo and used part sour cream. I exchanged Panko for the corn flakes and carrots for the celery.  The carrots didn't cook all the way which gave a nice crunch in each bite.  I also recommend adding some seasoning.  Garlic and Herb worked good for me.  Leftover are good too.  I'll use this again!
