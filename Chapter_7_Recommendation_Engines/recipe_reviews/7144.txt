When making this recipe, you need to know what to expect from a spelt bread.  The result is a very typical European bread that is heavy, dense, can be sliced SUPER thin and served much like soft crackers. It is also, however dense with nutrients and I thought this was a very good recipe for bread! After reading the other reviews, I added an extra teaspoon of xanthan gum to hold it together and keep it moist. This worked out wonderfully.

Spelt does contain gluten and is not suitable for those who are coeliac, however its gluten can be eaten by most who are intolerent to wheat. I use Spelt for all my baking, bread, cakes, cookies etc using any wheat recipe I find! the key is adjusting quanties of liquid added and kneading/mixing times. Keep any kneading to a minimum, after 3-4 mins the gluten will collapse. Add more liquid than the recipe calls for, you want your mixture to be marginally "sloppier" than when using wheat, this will make your end product  light and airy. If you treat spelt like wheat in recipes you will end up with a very dense result. (as I found out when I first started)

Good Bread Recipe!! I have a lot of experience baking with splet and would like to give a little advise. When making spelt bread it is a good idea to add some Zanthan Gum (about 1 tsp. per cup of spelt) This will help it to rise better. Also keep in mind that spelt doesn't have gluten in it (the reason many people use it) so it will be a more dense bread. Don't be expecting a light fluffy loaf. If you are, find a different grain!! Great Recipe!!

This bread has the potential to be great. You just have to have the right method. If you are using dry active yeast (as the recipe calls for) you need to add the yeast to the water (which I always heat to 100 degrees) and let it sit 10 minutes before you add the other ingredients. If you don't, most of your yeast will not become active and you will end up with a dense loaf. Also, lecithin is very important when making spelt as it acts similar to gluten and allows the bread to rise.  Lastly, I always just use milk and skip the powder. I also usually double the lecithin for a lighter loaf. The bread is great, especially when toasted! Toasting really brings out the wonderful natural flavor of the spelt.

This recipe was great, however I changed it up a bit. I added 1Tbsp. butter(no oil or lecithi; I added 1Tbsp. honey total; I used 2 cups spelt flour, 1/2 C soy flour & 1/2 C bread flour. It turned out with great texture and highth, also very tastey. Good Luck!

I haven' tried this recipe (yet) however adding a tablespoon of Vital Wheat Gluten to any recipe that doesn't have a large amount of actual "Bread Flour" will make the dough rise.

I followed all the instructions, used new ingredients, right cycle, etc. The bread only rose to about 3 inches tall when it was done, and it tasted horrible! Don't waste your time or ingredients.

My bread rose up golden and lovely.  I did use 1/2 sprouted spelt flour (I use either sprouted or soaked grains for nutritional value) and 1/2 white flour.  I added 3 tsp. vital wheat gluten and changed the honey to 1 T.  I also watched to make sure it had enough water since spelt can absorb extra water.  It smelled wonderful while baking, and I'm so glad to have a recipe for the bread machine that I was able to utilize a sprouted flour.  Thanks for sharing!

I unfortunately read the reviews about this bread after I attempted to bake it. I had exactly the same experience as silverstar61. Very poor volume, very dense. The spelt flour from Doves Farm warned about this, but I thought I'd try anyhow. Bad idea.

Came out very yummy and fluffy!  I doubled the lecithin, subbed whole spelt for white spelt, and subbed dried coconut milk for dry milk powder.  I also took someone's advice and activated the yeast in the water and honey before adding to the bread maker.

I followed the instructions properly ect, and these came out horrible!
However, we had a splet eater come to my house and i needed somthing to make using it. Once again i tryed this recipe and it worked pretty good, and thankfully she liked it. It didnt rise that much though, but i think i will use this is a  sweet bread recipe next time.

my machine bakes 2 1-1 1/2 lb loaves.  The bread was beautiful until 40 minutes prior to being done.  It overflowed the pans and started to burn on to the elements. I turned it off immediately, thus losing my breads.    Any suggestions?  I use spelt due to food allergies and was so happy to find this recipe.

I make this nearly every week.  Couple things I did differently for a better rise:  2 tsp xanthum gum, 1/4 tsp ginger powder, 1/2 tsp salt,  and 2 1/4 tsp bread machine yeast.  I get a really high rising spelt bread.  Just like a regular wheat bread. Sometimes, I omit the honey and just use sugar and put a tablespoon or so of water if it looks dry. Also, I dont use milk powder.  :-)  Hope this helps someone.

SUPER light and fluffy.  I added 3 teaspoons Vital Wheat Gluten and increased Lecithin to 1 teaspoon.  Additionally, I allowed the yeast to soak in 1 cup of 100 degree water for 10 minutes before beginning the machine...

I will be making this recipe again!  (It came out perfectly on "Basic" setting for 1 1/2 pound loaf).

When I followed the recipe exactly, it came out a bit dry but much better than other recipes I've tried. Next time I added 1/4 C more water, 2 T butter, and for taste and health benefits I changed the veggie oil to walnut oil. Came out perfect - so tasty and moist!

I've tried this recipe twice. Once with the regular recipe and one with everyone's suggestions. Both loaves came out hard and unedible.

This recipe worked great in my bread machine.  I used Bob's Red Mill Spelt Flour.  The bread was light and smelled wonderful.  It had a nice sweet crust.  I loved it.  I used sunflower oil and brown sugar and it was great.  I may try to use applesauce instead of oil the next time.

The bread tasted very good.  I substituted 1/2 an egg yolk for the lecithin.  the loaf didn't rise very much.  Is that from the spelt or did i do something wrong?  I'm going to try using some vital wheat gluten next time i make it.

Great bread made with some small tweaks--2 cups spelt flour and 1 cup of bread flour, butter instead of oil, and a teaspoon of gluten.  Yum!
