So I think I may have screwed up somewhere along the line. Like db, I don't eat canned anything, so I used 5 fresh pears (25 oz before peeling/coring), 3 large apples (29 oz before peeling/coring) and about 13 oz of fresh pineapple (I subbed apples for peaches). The 2 cups of sweet potatoes were totally lost in the fruit. I more than doubled the sweet potato, and it was still lost in all the fruit, but I couldn't add anymore because the pan was full. As the other reviewers' recommended, I baked covered until the sweet potatoes were soft, then took the cover off and baked another 15 min more. It was super juicy. The curry flavor was totally diluted by all the juice. Now I realize probably one large apple and 1 - 2 pears + the pineapple would have been plenty of fruit. Also, a shake of salt really brings out the flavor.

This is delicious, and even better the second day.  I used fresh apples, pears and canned pineapple, not peaches.   I used honey to replace some of the sugar.  I cooked it longer because we were having company, and the meat took longer than expected and  I think it benefited from the extra time. I did  cook it  covered until the sweet potatoes were soft, then uncovered to allow some juice to cook off.  It goes great with pork.  It was a big hit. i recommend it!!!

I am eating some of the 3rd time using this recipe loosely.
I don't use canned anything, and substituted apples instead of peaches, honey and/or maple syrup for b.sugar, sesame oil instead of butter, so added a pinch of sea salt.  If you aren't big on curry, add less but do not omit, you can add more later but it takes baking time for the flavor to develop. 
450 burned the top if left uncovered, so I baked the others at 375 until the sweet potatoes were tender (cut smaller to cook faster).  The flavor is amazing, I can't stop eating it.  I like it with a dollop of vanilla yogurt. I will be making this for potluck.

This was great. I used fresh pears, pineapple and canned peaches. I nuked the sweet potato a couple of minutes before cubing. I didn't use the curry as I don't have any but may try it next time. I'll make this again!
