I made this for 20 guys at our Spring Turkey hunt and they loved it. I did take the onions and the peacans out because some of the girley man wont eat onions. I already passed it along to two of the guys EXCELLENT

I made this today for a Thanksgiving side dish. The only thing I did differently was use canned asparagus. My niece turned her cheek at the suggestion of trying some, but after she heard all the compliments, my niece decided to try, and then she went back for MORE! I have never incorporated the cheese into the cracker crumbs, and I love the texture and taste. The portobello mushrooms were a wonderful addition! And the pecans sprinkled on top made the dish just that more fantastic! This recipe is a keeper!

I made this for Easter dinner - it was enjoyed by all.  I didn't make any changes  this first go around, although I did have to bake it longer (40 min) before the cheese would melt on top.

4.25 A nice change for an asparagus side dish, not too cheesy, just the right amount of mushrooms and onions and not runny.  Pecans on the top give it a unique taste experience.  Would make a suitable accompaniment to beef, chicken, ham, pork or fish or just by itself with another side dish.

I thought that this recipe called for too many crackers.  I will make it again and used just half the crackers.
