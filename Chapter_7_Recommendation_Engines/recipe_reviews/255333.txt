AWESOME!!!! I loved the idea of chucking some pie in the blender and making a milkshake out of it, lol. I made some w/ the bourbon and some without (for the kiddos). Both versions were great! The whole family LOVED this... a definite keeper~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

I like my shakes thick; this was a thinner consistency than I prefer; I'm glad I started with only 1/2 the milk called for. Of course the quality of the pumpkin pie makes a difference; I chose a very inexpensive pie from the grocery that I realize wouldn't have enjoyed on its own. Maybe for next time:  better pie, more ice cream, and less milk.

I LOVED THE TASTE, GREAT MILKSHAKE, BUT USING I/4 OF A PIE MADE IT TOO FILLING AND RICH.  DID I READ IT RIGHT WITH 1/4 PIE?
