"Interesting."  I can see why other reviewers were disappointed, however, this recipe has potential!  I think the problem is the amount of paprika.  It overpowers both the honey and the mustard.  Try reducing it by half, at least.

I used dijon mustard by the way.  The chicken was tender (I let it bake the full 45 minutes, gas oven.)  This recipe is quick to prepare and tastes upscale for a mid-week meal.  I am definitely going to make it again.

If you are looking for a delicious,quick and easy chicken recipe this one is it!!!  The only suggestion I have is use a small baking dish and cover with foil until you turn and baste, then return to oven uncovered.  I found this helped keep the chicken moist and flavorful!!!  This is a new family FAVORITE!!!  We have even used the sause recipe on Pork - awsome.

Wonderful recipe.  We absolutlely loved it.  I would just cook it in a smaller pan so that the juices stay on the chicken, since it has a tendency to spread in the pain.

Yummy, Yummy, Yummy!!  If you love Honey Mustard, this recipe is for you!  I marinated my chicken for 3 hours and added more sauce than recommended, which proved to be fruitful for the flavor of the chicken.  (Marinating overnight is even better!)  I also, like others before me, used 1/2 dijon mustard and 1/2 regular mustard.  I also used soft flavor/tasting honey to make sure the mix wouldn't be too sweet.  It would be nice to have the chicken taste a bit more tangy and maybe lemon juice would be helpful.  My husband and dinner guests gobbled this up!  :)

What a quick and easy way to prepare chicken! My husband is VERY fussy and really liked this recipe.  I am going to try the recipe with Dijon, but I found the prepared mustard was just fine.  We also tried this chicken in an alternate way - 
After letting the chicken cool, slice into thin strips and serve in a salad with lettuce, grated chedder cheese, mushrooms, pineapple chunks and honey-dijon salad dressing - a great Honey Mustard Chicken salad!!

I've been making Baked Honey Mustard for years and suggest 2 changes to this recipe.  First off..use dijon mustard instead of yellow.  You can also buy prepared Honey Dijon dressing or mustard if you are in a rush. The next tip is to marinate your chicken breasts in the Honey mustard. Its best to marinate overnight but in the morning is fine too.

My husband and I really like this dish.  It makes a very good honey mustard sauce.  I definitely recommend using dijon mustard.  Also, pierce the chicken on both sides and marinade in the sauce for at least 30 minutes before cooking.  I poured just a little of the sauce over the stuffing I served with it.  This dish would be very good on the grill, too.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I agree Dijon mustard was better than regular mustard, also I  found it to be really sweet, next time I will cut down on the honey, but this is really delicious! and I am will be making this again and again.
Thanks

This is surprisingly tasty.  I didn't think the lemon flavor would come through but it did.  I added some dill to the sauce for color and next time I think I'll add grill marks to the chicken and then bake.  If you're a sauce lover, I'd double the sauce ingredients as there was just enough sauce for hubby and me.

This was fantastic.  The chicken came out so juicey and almost melts in your mouth.  I love the sauce it was tangy and sweet, just perfect.  I did change a few things.  I used dijon mustard and organic honey, I didn't use basil.  This was what I did.  I sprinkled salt, pepper and garlic powder on both sides of the chicken, then poured half sauce over chicken and baked for 20 minutes.  I then turned the chicken over and poured the remaining sauce over the chicken.  I baked it for another 15 minutes.  Fabulous, this is going to be a staple in my house.  My husband loved it too.  I served it with sauted spinach and garlic and conscious and lentils. This is a must try recipe.

Very easy to prepare and good results.  I used fresh herbs to boost the flavor and marinated in the sauce overnight as well.

I had two chicken breasts thawed (seasoned with salt/pepper and garlic powder) - and wanted to try a new recipe.  I came across this recipe and decided to give it a try.  I changed this recipe for serving size for 2 - and made a couple of changes.  Per others comments, i only added a dash or two of basil (perfect).  I also used Dijon mustard (i dont think i would have liked it with yellow mustard).  I added about a tsp of brown sugar - and a tsp of worcestershire!  baked 20 min on one side - 10 on the other!  perfect!!  I served on top of rice with broccoli and a side salad!  It seemed it almost had a hint of an asian flavor to it.  Next time i may serve with some pineapple!  mmm..my boyfriend LOVED it...i think he could have had another serving!

Loved this recipe!
I'm always glad that I read reviews before I try out recipes for myself. 

As others had suggested, I used half regular mustard and I used half grainy dijon. If it were up to me I would have used all dijon but I wasn't sure if my boyfriend would appreciate that or not. I also used half the amount (1/4 cup) of honey and 1/4 cup of maple syrup! Mmmm the maple and the dijon was deeelicious! I pierced my chicken on both sides and let it marinate for 2 hours. Longer would have been great too!

1 teaspoon of paprika is, as others have said, way too much. I just put a few dashes. 

And on top of everything, I used a smaller baking dish so that the chicken was fully surrounded by the sauce. This meant that my chicken was SUPER moist! With every single bite that I took I kept saying how amazed I was at how moist it was!

Lastly, Once it was done I decided to crank on the broiler and let it quickly get golden brown while I basted it. All I had was a really small baking dish so my chicken was crammed in and pracitcally boiled in the honey mustard sauce so it didn't have a chance to brown at all. But the broiler did the quick trick of making it look (and taste) delicious!

My boyfriend LOVED it! If I didn't already have something taken out for dinner tonight I would make it again already!

Half way through devouring our meal I realized I should have taken a picture for the website but..oh well!

All in all, delicious! loved it!

We LOVED this! My boyfriend picked it out because he loves mustard sauces and I thought it would just be okay since I'm not crazy about mustard. But we were both very impressed. The spices really balance the mustard & honey flavors. The only change I made was to reduce the honey a little bit because I didn't want it to be too sweet, and to use dijon mustard. Thanks for the great recipe!

Addition: the next day, I sliced up the leftover chicken and tossed it with spinach, tomato, avocado, and yellow bell pepper. the sauce was a great salad dressing!

This is a very easy and delicious recipe made with staple ingredients found in most kitchens. I took the advice from some of the other reviews and marinated the chicken a couple hours before baking. I also covered the dish for the first 30 min.I also only used a 1/4 tsp of basil, it was plenty. Some reviewers hated this recipe and I was at first wary of making it. I think a lot depends on the kind of mustard you use. I used a dark mustard,(Deep South) b/c that's what I had. I'm not sure I would like the taste of a yellow mustard in this recipe.I'd have to try it. This recipe went great with mashed potatoes and green beans. You can use the sauce for the mashed potatoes.

This was really good! I read other reviews before I made it and cut back on the honey just a teeny bit, and it turned out nicely. I love the tangy flavor of honey-mustard!

Excellent! I made the recipe exactly as written. I used honey mustard for the prepared mustard. I also scaled down the recipe for two people. I really like the flavor... much like a Chinese sweet and sour meal.  I will definately make again... BE SURE to grease the dish before baking!

o.k., this is one of my all time favorite chicken dishes. Instead of the parsley, basil, and paprika, (I was out of 2 of those), I only added Italian seasoning to the honey/mustard mixture, (just sprinkled a fair amount in, didn't measure), and it was fantastic! I cooked the chicken in 2 glass baking dishes (large family), and kept covered with foil the whole time, even after turning, until done. The chicken came out nice and tender and very tasty. I also just salt and peppered the chicken after putting them in the baking dish, instead of before hand, and just peppered the other sides after turning to avoid over salting. I will deffinately want to make this again. Yum!

This is very reminiscent of the (fried) Lemony Chicken with Artichoke Hearts elsewhere on this site.  BOTH are keeper recipes! Taking a cue from other reviews, I would suggest that: (a) before pouring it onto the chicken, place the honey-mustard mixture in the fridge for 15 min to make it stiffer so that it does not flow off the chicken breast before or during baking; (b) for anyone with an instant-read thermometer, the fact that chicken breast is done when its internal temp reaches 155°F is perhaps a more helpful indicator of doneness than awkwardly checking that "the chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear". Thanks, Mary, for this outstanding recipe!

Absolutely the best honey mustard chicken recipe I have ever prepared myself.  I also added a pinch of garlic powder to enhance it further!!!

Note: It is now June of 2011 and this was the very first all recipes recipe I saved to my inbox in March of 2000, over 11 years ago! I like to try new recipes so I haven't revisited this one until recently and, I can see why I rated it high. The flavor of Honey and mustard is unmatchable - whether its on a soft pretzel or on chicken. As before, I used dijon mustard (far superior for that kick) and did go easy on the paprika. I think the secret for me was a stoneware baking sheet. I used bone in and skinless chicken breasts and they stayed moist flavorful. Use a meat thermometer and don't go a degree over done!

I didn't use the original recipe but my recipe deserves 5 stars. I used DIJON MUSTARD and cut down HONEY to 1/3 CUP. I did the rest exactly as stated in the original recipe. DELICIOUS!

This was an awesome recipe & I agree with another reviewer that this is restaurant quality.  I made it exactly as stated.  This made my Rosh Hashana celebrting hubby very happy!  I did add quartered and slightly peeled red potatoes into the baking pan with the chicken & honey mustard sauce.  I will be making this many times again & I think the sauce could be poured over brisket, fish, pork, etc.  MmmmMmmmm!

Easy, Tasty, A Winner!  I love recipes where you have all the ingredients in your fridge or pantry.  Line the pan with foil for easier clean-up.  And I only baked it for 20 minutes, applied more sauce, then baked for an additional 15.  One hour would be too much, I think.

This chicken turned out so very good! It requires few ingredients, and is very low in fat too! I only used 2 fairly large chicken breasts, but I kept the sauce amount the same because we like having extra sauce. I used a small 8x8 inch baking dish. These were perfectly done at exactly 45 minutes. I also just eyeballed the paprika, I used a little less than a teaspoon, and I also chopped up some fresh parsley. The sauce really is a wonderful glaze with great flavor. Next time, I'm going to try using a spicy brown mustard such as Gulden's. I bet even a dijon would be great with this also. Thanks for sharing, I will make this again for sure :)

We've been making this for 4 yrs and it's just like you say, "Quick and easy to prepare, and the kids love it too!" Everyone ate it all! I used 3 kinds of mustard, spicy, brown, and yellow (1/2 C. total for all) and added a little more honey so the mustard wasn't over powering. I also used chicken tenderloins and baked for 30 minutes.

This recipe is awesome!  I used leg quarters and they came out so tender and delicious.  I thought the sweetness was just right.  I, too, used Dijon mustard for this recipe.  My children loved this too!  My husband cleared his plate!  I will definitely make this again!

This is an awesome recipe. I've made it as is, and with modifications that other reviewers have suggested. 

As is, this recipe is a 4 star recipe. What I do to make it 5 star, is use dijon mustard instead of prepared and use fresh herbs over dried. It makes an amazing amount of difference. 
I noticed some people find the paprika overpowering, but I think it's fine as is, when used in combination with fresh herbs. Happy cooking!

This is an excellent recipe.  I did however add 1/4 cup of  mayo and a tablespoon of fresh thyme to the mix.  The chicken turned out extremely moist and my hubby and I both agreed it was the best chicken we had had in a very long time!

Simply fantastic!!! So easy to prepare, and the taste is heavenly! I added a little curry powder, the same amount as the paprika...I don't know if it enhanced the taste, but it was delicious! I substituted 1/3 of the mustard with Dijon. Also put 2 tbls. melted butter into the baking dish to create a little more juice. I baked for 25 minutes covered with tin foil, then removed...basted with the remaining mustard sauce...mixing some of it into the butter, for another 20 minutes. When finished baking I poured the butter and mustard drippings into a fry pan, added a dash of garlic salt...threw in some peeled raw shrimp and scallops and sauteed for 4 minutes, and served on a bed of rice. Drizzle remaining glaze over the rice. OMG!!! Your guests will be begging for this recipe!!! Highly recommend this dish. Serve with steamed broccoli, and a lettuce of your choice with an Asian Sesame dressing.

This was absolutely delicious and easy!!!  I baked it in a 2 qt glass dish, used dijon mustard, and only used 4 chicken breasts, but the same amount of sauce the recipe calls for.  I also served it with rice and the used some of the sauce to mix in with the rice.  Definitely a keeper!

This was delicious and so easy.  It is the perfect chicken dish when you want flavor with no fuss.  I marinated the chicken in the sauce instead of brushing it on while cooking.  I also covered the baking dish for the first 30 minutes.  The only change I may make next time is reduce the basil to 1/2 teaspoon.  It was a little strong for my taste but still wonderful.  This will be a regular in the dinner rotation!

The sauce is very good.  I suggest marinating the chicken for several hours for improved flavor, and serving extra sauce on the side.

This was great!  I was afraid to use 1/2 cup mustard but do use it all.  I used half dijon, half regular. Also I used half the basil as other reviews suggested and half the paprika.  Definately added garlic with it.  If you let it cool for 10 minutes the sauce will thicken.  One of the kids found it too tangy, the rest of us loved it.  This is a keeper.

this was very moist and tasty. I used a smaller baking dish and when the chicken was done I took a bit of the sauce in a tablespoon of flour mixed it into a paste and wisked it into the sauce. Thickened it up nicely.

I was very impressed by this great chicken.  All I have to say is this is the pantry crisis dinner.  It took no time to assemble, and I enjoyed it.  My brothers and parents loved it, and it is going to be on the table again soon!!!

Very good, very easy.  I doubled the 'sauce' and that really wasn't necessary.  But I was asked for the recipe from our guest when I made this dish. I will definitely be making this again.  A good dish for company, because I prepped everything, chicken and sauce separately, in the morning, then just put sauce on and popped it in the oven to bake at dinnertime.  I served it with plain white rice with cooked broccoli mixed into the rice.  Thanks for this recipe.

It was alright.  I made them with cut up chicken.  The family ate it all, but didn't suggest that I ever make it again.  I really like the recipe for the honey mustard...but when you cook it with chicken it looses it's flavor.  I would still keep it as a dip and try to thicken it up.

I used chicken thighs instead of breasts. This chicken was very tasty! I baked it in a pan lined with foil and covered it with foil for the first 30 mins. I also used half dijon mustard and yellow mustard. Its a great quick weeknight just got off work dinner. I served the chicken with rice and salad.

This recipe is simple and good ... I punched it up a bit with 2 tbsp. of sour cream, a dash of Seasoned Salt and 1 tsp. of onion powder. Also before puting the chicken in the oven I dredged it in flour and browned it up, the skin didnt stay crisp but it was a nice texture!

I made this the other night and it was wonderful! Everyone in the family agreed and that doesn't happen too often. I made only one change and that was simply because I did not have the spices called for so I substituted Italian seasoning. It made delicious sandwiches the next day too!
Thanks Mary for a fast, easy recipe that is also good.

I love honey mustard and chicken...and I like them together, but I'm still in limbo with this one.  The chicken didn't have a whole lot of flavor.  I think there was more of a sweet flavor than a tangy flavor.  I did like the ease of preparation which is always a plus in my kitchen.  Maybe letting the chicken marinate in the sauce or poking holes in the chicken might give it more flavor while baking. I haven't decided if I'll make it again or not, but I'm glad I at least tried it.

Wonderful, simple and easy chicken recipe!
I have tried it a couple of times before, but this
last time my daughter suggested to make it with
chicken tenders. It was a lot easier and faster to
cook. With the tenders that were left I made submarine sandwiches and they were just wonderful
even when the Honey Mustard Chicken tenders were
cold. Next time I plan to serve them with a salad,
something like a Caesar Salad. Wow, can't wait to
try it again. Thanks to Ms.Bane for her wonderful
contribution to our cookbook!

We really enjoyed this recipe and it was very easy.  I will likely either remove or cut down on the paprika because it got a bit on the spicy side for my 9-yr old.  Flavors were good and chicken was nice and tender.

This was a VERY SIMPLE recipe to make, unfortunetly the taste wasn't enough to cover the chicken. Next time I might try using chicken tenders or cube the chicken. I ended up having to doctor it up and used some of it in salad; by itself, it wasn't enough to be the main dish.

This was weird. The paprika did seem to take over the flavor and it was just...kinda bitter? I did use a no salt added dijon mustard, but even salt didn't make this more palatable. I forced myself to eat it because I was dumb and made a big batch of this. I ended up wiping off the sauce and making the chicken into chicken salad. I won't try again- I don't feel like wasting more honey & mustard! I shouldn't have used that pricey dijon ;)

This is a great chicken recipe.  It has complex flavors created with simple ingredients- my 2 year old even liked it (and that's saying a lot!)

I made this by making foil packages for each chicken breast and pouring sauce onto the chicken. It was really fast this way which is why I went that route. The sauce was very good but I used good honey and spicy brown mustard which is what my family likes, so I'm not surprised we liked it. The basil and parsley were nice but I did halve the paprika after reading some reviews and overall I found a good tasty balance. Lots of sauce for 4 small chicken servings, next time I'll use bigger chicken breasts and marinate them.

This was just ok for us.  As it was a beautiful spring day, we grilled rather than baking, but other than that I followed the recipe (and decided to rate anyway because, if anything, I figured the grilling would add even MORE flavor).  I let the chicken marinade for about 45 min before grilling and doubled the sauce (for 2 breasts) and kept 1/2 back for dipping. It was nice, but not a *do over*, hence the "4".  It's def worth a try, though!  TY for submitting!

This recipe is quite good.  I made it tonight with a few changes...as per the advice of some other reviewers, I omitted the basil.  The mustard I used was quite strong, so I cut the amount in half, but I think I will use the full amount next time.  I allowed the chicken to marinate for about an hour, and it came out tender and juicey.  Also, I added an egg and some mayo to the  mustard/honey mix to help combat the runny-ness problem that others complained about.  It helped.  I would definately make this again.

To make the chicken stretch, I cut it up after baking and made a salad with it.  It was SOOO good -- moist and flavorful!  I used really good quality stone ground dijon mustard.  For the salad, I used mixed baby greens with herbs, feta, toasted almonds, roasted sunflower seeds, and fresh ground pepper, and tossed with all natural honey mustard vinagrette (the kind with real honey instead of HFCS).  I just had some leftovers for lunch, and I'm already scheming to make it again for next week!

This is the first negative review I've written for a recipe on Allrecipes.  My husband who loves honey mustard did not care for this at all, neither did I.  I have to agree with some other reviewers that the basil added a weird taste.  Just wasn't appealing at all.  I know tons of people like this chicken...definately not for our tastes!  On the plus side, it was very easy to prepare so at least I didn't slave in the kitchen for hours.  Will not make this again...woundn't even know how to improve on it as aside from the basil the glaze seems to be off in porportions and just altogether not what we're looking for.  Sorry....

Not bad...not bad at all...I used dijon mustard instead of regular and let the chicken marinate all day. Next time I will puncture holes in the chicken so the flavors really sink in. The chicken seemed more tender when we had the left overs 3 days later! Easy recipe, prepare early and cook later.

This had all the makings of a great recipe but fell a little short.  My girlfriend and I love honey-mustard and chicken but this recipe tasted a little strange.  We added a little less honey than it called for and a little less mustard.  After the first few bites we adapted to its flavor but we probably won't make it again.  It came out very tender and juicy we overall we weren't too happy with the results.

Made this almost right by the recipe except that I forgot to add paprika, and I used half French's spicy mustard and half French's honey mustard. It was delicious, and the chicken was so tender.  My husband loves honey mustard, and he was dipping whole grain bread in the mustard sauce after the chicken was gone!  This one is a keeper!!

That was good! I used half yellow half spicy brown mustard, a little less honey and added some red pepper flakes and lemon juice to the sauce. I baked the chicken covered for 30 min and after pouring the second half of the sauce on the chicken I baked it uncovered. The chicken turned out very moist and flavorful. Will make this again! YUM!

Good recipe, I added a splash of a sweeter white wine that paired well and used the poltury herb in my spice rack (sage, basil, parsley, oregano) instead of just basil and parsley.  Turned out great, I let made the marinade early in the day, thawed the chicken and let it marinade throughout the day.  Definitely recommend marinading!

I used less paprika and covered for 1/2 of cooking time as suggested. Also only used 3 halves w/ same amount of sauce. The chicken flavor (?) was really overpowering and the sauce didn't add much flavor. Next time I'll try marinating the chicken before cooking.

Man this was AWESOME!
Like others I used 1/2 t of paprika and about a 1/4 cup of honey. I baked for 30 min covered, then I made another batch of sauce (I didnt follow directions and covered the chicken with all of the sauce initially) then baked for 15 min uncovered. YUM YUM YUM

This was delicious! Definitely go with the Dijon mustard. I can't imagine this with regular yellow mustard. I added some chunks of fresh zucchini to the baking dish, roasted it along side the chicken and served it over couscous for a very easy weeknight meal!

Great recipe and very easy and clock-friendly... I served it together with mashed potatoes, and the sauce of the chicken with the mashed potatoes was beyond!!

My boyfriend was cautious about this at first because he doesn't like mustard, but he gobbled it up and took the rest to work! I will absolutely make this again! (I used part spicy brown mustard and part French's yellow.... gave just enough kick without being overpowering)

This was a nice easy dish to make. I added a little garlic to the honey mustard sauce just because I am a big fan of garlic. =) I found the sauce to be a great way to dress up the chicken without being over bearing. As always with the recipes I use I scale it down to 3 servings as there are only two of us and it was not hard to do. I sevred it with brown rice and steamed veggies. Just yummy!

This was unexpectedly easy and, as another reviewer commented, very classy! The paprika adds an interesting flavor to the mix...I would add a bit less of it next time. I used this amount of sauce for two large chicken breasts, and there was a nice amount of sauce for our mashed potatoes. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this last night and it was great. Was a bit hesitant about how these flavors might mingle but it turned out very yummy. I did use the regular yellow mustard but added an extra 2 tbls of seeded french dijon ( called whole grain or "old style" dijon) and it gave it an extra pop. Will make this again. So easy!! Thanks.

Love this one! I also used less of the spices and I add just a tablespoon of brown sugar to take the bitter out of the mustard. Kids had seconds. I poured the sauce over frozen chicken breasts and covered with foil for an hour and took the foil off and cooked for about twenty more minutes. Quick, easy and yummy.

This is a great recipe!  My husband declared that we can "add it to the rotation".  It had a perfect balance of honey and mustard.  Very easy to make!  The only things I will do differently next time will be to marinade the chicken in the sauce for awhile to intensify the flavor, and make extra sauce.  We put the sauce on baked red potatoes and it was wonderful!

After reading the reviews, I made a few changes & was very pleased. I used 1/4 t. basil & 1/2 t. paprika. Kept everything else the same. I did cover it for the first 30 min. My whole family enjoyed it. Thanks!

Such a simple recipe yet so delicious, and the chicken was very moist and tender. I set aside some of the sauce before marinading the chicken and had it on the side with dinner for dipping. I used a garlic and herb flavored mustard I had and and it worked out great. I also marintated the chicken for a few hours and removed the foil for the last 15 minutes of baking.  It's a versatile recipe which you could add many different spices and it would still come out great.

This was really easy and very tasty - I'm a student so this is perfect as it's not too expensive either. I used rosemary instead of the other herbs and put a slice of bacon on top five minutes before the end of cooking though - the salt of the bacon is marvellous with the sweet honey taste.

Very delicious and full of flavor!  I will try marinading the chicken the next time in the sauce so that it can permiate in to the chicken more.  I also found that the time was too long and the chicken was a bit dry.  I will reduce total cooking time to 30 minutes.  Great recipe!

Great recipe. I saw it 2 weeks ago and already made it twice. We didn't like the basil too much, so the second time I left it out, but I added a little bit of fresh garlic...delicious.

Quick & easy, but was still lacking something in the taste dept. 

I made it with whole grain Temeraire dijon (the 'funny taste' people must've used hot dog mustard; that sounds vile), good Hungarian paprika, tarragon in place of basil & parsley (I prolly wouldn't use herbs again; it just doesn't seem a good match as it was overpowered- rosemary might've worked), minced shallots (tip: buy shallots in bulk at your International market, they are about 1.50 a lb.), & raw Syrian honey. 

I thickened the sauce at the end (after adding the cornstarch slurry some of y'all have recommended); also 1 c. chicken stock to extend the sauce.

As I mentioned, it seemed as though it needed something, so I replaced the breasts in the sauce after thickening a bit, & hybridized this recipe with the 'Alice' chicken above- strips of crisp (but not too crisp) bacon, & melted mozzarella cheese on top of the breasts, quickly broiled.

NOW it was good! The salty, crisp bacon & creamy cheese were a perfect foil for the piquancy of the mustard & the sweetness of honey  (Served with rice, as some have said). It was a hit with husband & teen daughter, & baby ate chicken with all the 'stuff' scraped off ;).

I'd make it again (modified, as I have done.)

Wow!  I made this for dinner tonight, and boy, was it good!  There are no left-overs!  Very easy to prepare, and I had all the ingredients in my kitchen.  I did use a pinch of garlic, like someone else had suggested, and I used fresh parsley instead of dried.  Very, very tasty meal!!!

This was a great quick meal! The honey mustard recipe is awesome! I think it's comparable to "Boars Head Honey Mustard". I used just under 1/2 cup of Dijon, then topped rest off with yellow mustard, and I followed the recipe from there. 

I cooked 2 large chicken breasts that I had cut in half long ways to have total of 4 chicken breasts. (I used the same cooking instructions listed for 6 chicken breasts). I made the full amount of Honey Mustard so I could have leftovers :) The chicken turned out great it did not dry out. An over all hit with my husband. 

**The next day I shredded the leftover chicken breast drizzled a little extra honey mustard on top then put it in a tortilla wrap with lettuce. YUM!

This is wonderful and so easy! I used whole chicken breast fillets and I only had whole grain mustard in.But it was so tasty.As I was only cooking for 2 I thought I would reduce the amount of sauce but the hand slipped with the honey! so I made it as the recipe stated and I'm glad I did !! On that note...I dont think there would be enough sauce for 6 people as the recipe states.I would certainly treble the amount -but its all down to personal preference I suppose. But once again it is a wonderful easy dish to make.A winner in my household for sure!!

Tried this tonight and was very well pleased with the result.  The sauce was easy to put together.  I used mostly prepared mustard but at suggestion of other reviewers, added some Dijon mustard as well. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs which I marinated for a couple of hours in the sauce.  When I turned the chicken over after baking about 20-25 minutes (adjusted time down because of using smaller pieces), I found that there was a lot of juice, with the chicken bubbling happily away in it.  I turned the chicken over and poured off most of that sauce.  I did think about whether to do that but the end result was perfect so I think I made the right decision. I then spread the other half of the honey mustard sauce over the chicken and put it back in the oven for about 15-20 minutes.  It was perfect when I took it out - coated nicely with thickened sauce and browned. The chicken was moist and flavorful.  I had made extra sauce because of marinating it so I boiled what I used for the marinade, a rolling boil, to make it safe to use on the chicken while baking and to eat with the chicken. The dish tasted as though I really fussed, but it was very simple to make - and with ingredients that I had on hand.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I will make it again.

Too mustard-y.  I ended up slicing the chicken up and using it in a salad.  Maybe Ill try it again and use Dijon instead of regular mustard, as other reviewers suggested.

This was so yummy! I didn't have parsley so I used thyme, I will definitely make again. Oh, I also used chicken thighs because I like them better than the breast!

I give this four stars only because I chose to use Hickory Farms Sweet Hot Mustard rather than regular prepared mustard.  I also used bone-in chicken quarters because it's what I had on hand.  I think it turned out amazing!  I removed the skin and cooked it right side up the entire cooking time.  Towards the end, I used the broiler to give the top a little bit of a crust because mine was super saucy.  I loved it, but I love mustards.  My husband wasn't a huge fan, but he hates any type of mustard.  His opinion doesn't count.

Hubby said this was one of his favorites. Used tenders and baked for 15 min., flipped, 15 min. With just a touch less paprika they turned out perfect!

All I can say is WOW! This chicken is amazing.  I followed the directions exactly except I covered the 13x9 pan with foil for the first 30 mins and then took it off. Such a tasty way to eat chicken.  I made this to put on salad however I don't know if it will last that long.

Made this with bone-in chicken thighs and added curry powder.  Simple recipe to make on nights when you're out of ideas.  Served with oven roasted veges and brown/white rice.

I made these without any basil, since I didn't have any, and it still turned out amazing. My boyfriend, who swore he hated honey mustard, really liked this too. I cut the honey in half to lessen the calories, and they still rocked =) Very yummy

This chicken dish was amazingly simple, easy to prepare and EXTREMELY delicious. I have two very picky kids and they both cleaned their plates and asked for more. As a family who tried to eat healthy, this is also a very flavorful low-cal dinner. I shared it on facebook as soon as we were done eating so all my friends could give it a try.

This recipe tastes great, takes very little effort, and lends itself well to different cooking methods and ingredient tweaks. I generally halve the paprika, use dijon mustard, and cut back a bit on the honey (I use equal amounts dijon and honey by weight rather than volume, and honey weighs more); a splash of lemon juice can help if it tastes a bit bitter, but isn't necessary. I use four chicken breasts, pounded slightly, so I also cut down on the cooking time a bit. They get nicely caramelized on the grill (good for sandwiches), but are saucier when baked (good over rice). Either way I definitely recommend marinating for a few hours because it makes everything much more flavorful.

Very good, everyone liked them and we will have them again. I marinated them for about 6 hours. I baked them in a smaller pan, covered for half the time then let them brown a bit. Came out nice and moist and very flavorful.

Such a quick and easy dinner especially in a household of just two!  I did make a little more of the honey mustard mixture and did half of it before putting the chicken in the oven, and then the rest about halfway through the cooking time.  I will definitely be making this again!

everyone liked this dish. i made a few changes though because when i made the sauce it was just too mustardy for me.  i doubled the amount of sauce didnt use quite as much honey but added some brown sugar. and even after that it wasnt my favorite chicken dish, it was still pretty good. i also used chicken breasts but cut them up into smaller pieces and used 2 small baking dishes. the sauce was very runny.

My son who is 13 loves this recipe. He even asked if he could cook it. The only thing I do different is instead of putting the chicken in the oven we put it on the grill and heat up the sauce on the side so we can pour it over the chicken.

The sauce is great. Very flavorful. But the chicken was really dry and the sauce stayed really runny and didn't caramelize. Next time we are going to use bone in chicken breasts, marinate them for a few hours in the sauce, grill them instead of bake them. Will be back to say how that turned out. The sauce is so good it can be used for many things, dipping, salad dressing, or on other meats for marinade.

I made this for myself and my kids.  I used regular mustard and dijon combined, but we just didn't like it.  It was edible, but I definitely won't make it again.  I like restaurant-style honey mustard and unfortunately  this didn't taste anything like it.

I really liked the way this came out.  Next time I'll add a bit more honey to balance the mustard flavor out.  My daughter wouldnt try it specifically for that reason.  Other than that it was great!  I will be making this again in the near future

Soooo easy to make and ohhhh Soooo Flavorful!!! Made this for my boyfriend for dinner tonight and he loves it! I only use 1/2 a teaspoon of paprika as suggested by other viewers and added 1 tablespoon garlic powder to the mixture and sprinkle some on the chicken.  Make sure you use a smaller size pan to just enough fit all the chicken in.  Next time I will double the sauce and use for dipping. I will definitely make this again!

While my friend enjoyed this dish (home-cooked meals are few & far between for him), I did not.  The chicken breasts were moist & tender but something was needed to balance out the tanginess of the sauce.  I might play with the recipe to find the right combination of flavors for my taste buds, but I will not make again as is.

Easy, quick and tasty! I didn't have basil or parsley, so I used 2 teaspoons of Mrs. Dash instead. I also covered my pan with foil. Came out great!

i had a craving for honey mustard ( which is weird since i dont ever eat it ) and i decided to make this. the only changes i made were to add an all purpose seasoning, a tsp of minced garlic and i used leg/thigh quarters. i thought the honey mustard made a good glaze. i will def make this again maybe for the grill. the leg/thigh quarters are so cheap and this is just another way to get my family to eat them. thanks.

This was good, and easy! I used a little less paprika, and used dijon mustard like some of the other reviewers. Totally forgot the salt and pepper, but I didn't miss it. I had only three chicken breasts, and reduced the sauce by a third, not half, and it was just about enough, so I think if I'd made 6 breasts, I would have wanted more sauce.

This was tasty!  I used Dijon mustard and scaled the recipe to 2 servings.  Only baked in oven for 15 minutes on each side (give or take a minute or two) and it came out juicy and tasty.  Used the leftover pan drippings to dip the chicken in.  The sauce does not stay on the chicken too well but the chicken still has a nice flavor.  Will make again.

Very good.  I don't add the basil because my son doesn't like it.  Here's a hint if your chicken turns out dry....Mix a dollop on mayo in with your honey and mustard.  You can't taste it but it adds a little fat to keep boneless skinless from getting to dry.

This was a hit for my whole family.  I used thighs and legs - since that's what I had - and put 1/2 the sauce on a few hours before cooking.  Made the sauce as directed, except only used 1/2 t paprika.  Will make again!

This recipe was amazing!  I thought the ingredients didn't sound that good but it was!  The chicken was so juicy and tender.  My family said it was the best chicken recipe they had ever had:)  Will definitely make this one again.

This was a hit with us. I covered the chicken with foil for the first thirty minutes of baking to ensure it did not dry out. I also chopped up a small sweet onion and scattered it all over the top and added a little garlic. I think without this addition I would have only given the recipe a 4 out of 5.  The next day, I used the leftover chicken and onions to make chicken wraps, yummy.  I absolutely love mustard and was looking for a way to cook with paprika since I have never used this spice in the past. This is sweet, tangy, and just what I was looking for -- thanks!

This was okay.  My husband LOVES honey mustard anything, but he said this one "wasn't too bad".  I thought it was way too sweet.  Perhaps marinating the chicken in the honey mustard sauce overnight might make it more flavorful, after reducing the honey or adding more mustard.

I loved this sauce! It was sweet without being overly so, and really was perfect over chicken. I marinated it for five hours and followed the recipe as is. Paired this with Baked Asparagus with Balsamic Butter Sauce, from this website. My new favourite!

Good honey mustard chicken!  I used dijon instead of the prepared mustard & it had a good kick.  We found the other flavors to be well rounded & subtle - which we liked.  The mustard does stand out, so unless you like mustard, this may be a little strong.  I followed the instructions exactly & they baked up beautifully!  Thanks for the recipe!  :)

This was a very tasty dish.  The sauce is a little different than the honey mustard sauces I've made before, but very good.  I put a little too much basil in for my husband's taste, but he also liked the overall dish.  I went by some of the other reviews and only put 1/2 teaspoon of paprika.  Will definitely make this again.

Wow- this was fabulous!  This resulted in super tender juicy chicken and was SO EASY!  I used only 4 chicken breasts with the original sauce yield, and baked it in an 8x8 glass dish.  I left it covered for the first 20-25 minutes, then uncovered for about 40.  The only other changes I made was to 1) use about 3/4 cup DIJON mustard, 2) used the same amount of fresh local honey and decreased the paprika to about 1/2 teaspoon.  I reserved about 1/2 the sauce prior to baking for a dipping sauce when serving it- but the chicken simply did not need to be dipped in anything!  It was fantastic!  This sauce would be great over rice or used to marinate other things! Yum!

I had a clue this wasn't going to be to our tastes when I took it out to turn over and I thought it smelled like dirty gym socks!!!  My husband is the only one who even ate it.  There is no way to describe the strange flavor and frankly I'm trying to forget it.

I was bored of my own recipe box and I thought I'd give this one a try. I am so glad I did because it worked out so well! I used boneless chicken thighs and the meat turned out so tender and moist. And plus the sauce is to die for! Probably next time I shall make up two batches of sauce. One for marinading and the other for basting. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This recipe is wonderful. It is very delicious, quick and easy. I doubled the sauce and used a silicone baking liner so I didn’t have to grease the pan. I will defiantly be passing this recipe on to family and friends.

I loved this recipe. I breaded the chicken after dipping it in the sauce and then poured the excess sauce on and around the chicken before baking it. The chicken was moist and delicious!

The first time I mad this recipe I used yellow mustard and did not like it at all. So I went and bought some Dijon mustard spcial for this recipe. It turned out so much better and I really like it. Very tender and tasty. I did cover with foil the second time.

This was really good. I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and added about 1/4 cup mayo. I grilled the chicken instead of baking it and it was wonderful. This ones a keeper.

Yummy, yummy, yummy... I wanted to lick the pan clean... it was that good.  I hate to cook and won't bother if it is too long or cumbersome and this wasn't either.  Definitely use the good mustard, Grey Poupon.

I love this recipe but have one bit of advice. I have tried this with good mustard (my favorite is Grey Poupon Dijon Mustard) and regular cheap yellow mustard and I would highly suggest using the better stuff. It made a huge difference to me and my husband. Mary, thank you for this recipe, it's so easy, we love it.

This recipe was excellent. I took the advice of a previous post and used 1/2 the prepared mutard and used a little brown sugar. It was so yummy. Even my non-meat eating children loved it. My only recommendation is to cut like 10 minutes off the cooking time if using boneless chicken. I used huge boneless breasts and the 45 mins made it a bit too dry. Otherwise, this recipe is a keeper. (P.S. Hi Brenda!!!)

Substituted dried basil with dried oregano and I use dijon mustard instead. Paired leftovers with cheddar for sandwiches the next day. Delicious!!

A very easy, interesting, and unusual baste for chicken.  I think the breasts would do equally well on the grill.  I also think this recipe would be better with a little heat, perhaps some chili powder added to the baste.  I used leftovers on buttered and grilled onion rolls with a slice of tomato and swiss cheese the next night and the sandwiches were better than the dish by itself the night before.

Just wonderful! I doubled the sauce to have extra for dipping and it was great. The chicken was so juicy and fork tender. Such a nice change from plain honey mustard. We will definatly be having this over and over again. My husband who doesn't really care for chicken had seconds and thirds and asked to have it again! He never asks to have anything! Thanks for a great new recipe!

This was WONDERFUL!  The BEST chicken I've ever fixed!  I used Dijon mustard and like other reviewers suggested...I cut the paprika and basil back to 1/4 tsp. I also cooked it covered for the first 30 minutes in a 9x9 casserole dish....I just used 3 breasts but the same amount of sauce...giving me plenty for my rice/veggies.   This was delicious with rice and mixed veggies.  I will Definitely be cooking this again.  Thank you very much for this recipe!

This was so easy and tasty.  My husband really liked it - he often says about meat dishes, "It's good but kind of low on flavor."  BUT he thought this was really good.  I used dijon mustard instead of regular.  Although I only cooked 2 chicken breast, I scaled the recipe for 4 and had more than enough sauce.  One other note - I always cut my chicken breast in half (so I had four smaller pieces of chicken).  I followed the cooking times and temperatures and the chicken came out perfectly juicy and tender.

Wonderful and it smelt so good while it was cooking. I used every thing as directed, but I used sweet and spicy mustard and just a tad less that what was called for. Oh yeah, had to cook it a little longer than directed.

I make this often, and my husband says it's his favourite dish!  I make a little more sauce (3/4 cup of honey and mustard) and serve it over rice.  You can spoon the sauce all over the rice and it soaks it up - yummy!  Sometimes I use Dijon mustard to kick it up a notch.

This recipe was very good, but the chicken breasts i used gave off alot of water. So, before basting halfway through, i drained the liquid.  I'm glad i did because it kept the sauce thick and rich. It was a nice variation from the usual.

Just wanted to add this family of 5's thumbs up for this recipe!!!  I doubled the marinade; marinated 6 CB and 4 BL, SL thighs for 6 hours; dumped all in 13x9 pan and baked 45 minutes, turning every 15 minutes.  Served with garlic mashed potatoes from this site, squash and salad.  Have already added this to our menu rotation.  It's a keeper!!  Thanks Mary Bane.

I would of liked this MUCH better with the exemption of the basil.  I even used less than called for and it was still overpowering (I just used your basic McCormick basil).  I used honey mustard that we all LOVE (bought from a taste testing party.. Tastefully Simple) and although it was very easy, I was disappointed that my kids forced themselves to eat it because the basil just did not mesh (my husband is traveling on business, again, this week).  I'm sure it would be good without the basil, but my children are scarred.  We like basil in some dishes, just not this one.  Sorry Mary, just our tastes ;)

This wasn't nearly as good as I had thought it would be. I used Honey Dijon in the recipe and used chicken breasts. I didn't feel the flavored melded well. My husband thought it was good but I think if made again, I would follow the recipe exactly as printed.

I did what some reviewers suggested and marinated this overnight. I used dijon mustard with the honey and seasonings, but next time I might just cut down a bit on the honey....it was a bit too sweet for us.

Very good, above average but not the best I've made either.  The qualities I found were the chicken was nice and tender and the sauce was yummy.  It just lacked something for my taste.  I'll make it again and add a touch of something.  Maybe a few tablespoons of orange juice.

We really liked this recipe.  I made it with wild rice and the flavors went well together.  The only change I made was to use whole grain mustard.  I think it added the to the texture of the sauce.

Really interesting flavors... molasses can be used in place of honey, but adjust the spices.  For another interesting twist, sprinkle chicken with creole seasoning instead of salt/pepper.

I served this over pasta and my picky toddler finished his portion in his bowl! I took the suggestion from other members and used dijon mustard. I think it is tasty except my husband thinks it is a little too sweet. Thus, I will cut back honey and increase a little salt the next time.  This dish is so easy to make, I'll definitely make it again.

Niice flavour, chicken was very moist too. I would probably add a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce next time so that it sticks to the chicken a bit more.

My family LOVES this recipe, and we have some friends that request it when they are coming over for dinner and cards! I use fresh basil and smoked paprika to give it a bit of a smoky flavor. I also add about 2 tbsp of honey dijon mustard. I cook it in a disposable 1/2 size aluminum chafing pan, and the chicken is moist and delicious!

This recepe is one that has flavor that satisfies yet doesn't overwhelm you. It is simple to make and not very time consuming. I plan on making this chicken again soon.

Quick but good recipe, I marinated the chicken in the sauce overnight and it definitely added flavor. Also I kept it covered while baking until the last 15 minutes which kept the chicken moist.

My husband hates chicken.  He said the other day that he would give it a try because it's good for you.  I figured this recipe might be good and it would mask some of the chicken flavors.  Well, what a hit this was.  He loved it.  Said I should keep making chicken like this and he would eat it.  I marinated it for about an hour, used 1/4 cup Dijon and 1/4 cup Spicy Brown mustard's and it came out wonderful.  I added just a tad of water to the marinade but not much.  Came out so good yummm..  thanks Mary!

This was a wonderful recipe.  I ended up using half the paprika as another reviewer suggested, and I used honey dijon mustard.  I let the chicken marinate in half the sauce in the refrigerator for several hours. I cooked it covered in foil for the first 40 minutes in my stone baking dish. I then removed the foil and let it cook an extra 10 minutes.  It came out moist and flavorful. I will be making this one again!

I don't cook in the oven very often, it is for me a very expensive way to cook.  Also I have to find someone who will go and buy and carry a gas bottle up two flights.  The first time I used the micro wave, but must have left it too long.  I just rescued the sauce from completely burning.  The next, I cooked it on top of the stove (very low flame).  OK, but I found it too sweet and couldn't finish it.  It's strange, because before cooking, the mustard is predominant, but not after cooking.  I am disappointed, because I like this combination.  Don't know whether I will make it again, even using less honey.

I am a single guy always looking for an easy weeknight recipe that tastes great and this is one of those.  Total prep and cook time under 1 hour which is also great!

Added garlic powder to salt and pepper on breasts, used Dijon and baked covered for first 30 minutes before I turned and basted - then uncovered for 15 minutes.  Flavor explosion - love it!

Great recipe! I used bone-in thighs and legs instead of boneless chicken breasts, since we eat chicken breasts most of the time. I increased the cooking time to 55 minutes to account for the different type of chicken. This was the most tender chicken ever! I put tinfoil in the botton of the baking dish so that the honey-mustard wouldn't bake to the bottom and scooped up the remaining mixture so that we could dip the chicken into the honey mustard. The honey-mustard itself was the perfect blend of sweet and tangy. I will definitely be making this again.

This was absolutely delicious...I used Dijon mustard but other than that I didn't change a thing.  Even my picky eater who doesn't like sauces on his meat put extra on it when he dished it up and went back for seconds.  I also followed another reviewers comment to cover with tin foil for the initial 30 minutes and the chicken stayed so nice and moist.  This is a keeper and already has been requested again.

I was hesitant to try this recipe due to a lot of mixed reviews but I went for it and I'm so happy I did. My husband and I both liked it very much. The only changes I made was I omitted the basil and parsley and I halved the paprika. I really don't understand all of the bad reviews because a recipe with that much honey and mustard is obviously going to be sweet and tangy. I can't understand why so many people were surprised by the flavor. It tasted sweet and tangy, exactly as I expected. This is not a "knock your socks off" kind of recipe but it was yummy, affordable, quick and easy so it gets an A in my book. I will definitely make it again!

This wasn't bad, but I think it lacks some depth of flavor.  I preferred Honey Mustard Chicken by Carol Alter, which includes curry and apricot jam.  Nonetheless, this wasn't a bad base for a honey mustard chicken -- just not my favorite.

I loveeeee this, I love the sweetness, can't get enough of the sauce, so for sure double the sauce. I browned the chicken first on grill pan so it got a nice grill mark on it, then baked it in foil, then uncovered after flip (reduce total bake time).Definitely a keeper!

Great recipe but I would reduce the basil next time as others have said.

This isn't bad by any means, it's just not our favorite.  We tried it for the first time tonight and thought it was to "herby".  I usually like honey mustard flavored things and if I try baking this again, I will cut down on the amount of basil and parsley that I used today.  =)  Like I said, it's not bad, MY family just didn't care for it.

This recipe was pretty good, I liked that the recipe made for a generous amount of sauce and the recipe itself was easy to remember (thumbs up).

I thought this was very tasty and so did my family. I made as written but baked covered. We had enough "sauce" that we could have put it over rice, so I will probably serve it with white or brown rice the next time I make it.

Absolutely delicious!  The whole family enjoyed this chicken!  I usually dry out chicken breasts, but followed other reviewers advice and placed it in a smaller pan, covered it for the first 30 minutes, and it was very moist!  I will be making this again...and again...and again!  Thanks for the recipe!

I liked this recipe. It was easy and tangy, but nothing out of this world. My husband enjoyed it more than I did. I will likely try Dijon mustard if I try this again.

I was excited for this recipe because I love honey mustard, but it didn't meet my expectations.  This chicken was okay - followed the recipe and I found that it came out sticky on the outside and drier than I would have hoped for. It wasn't bad tasting, but I wouldn't make this again.

I didn't have the parsley to put in so that was the only thing I didn't do. With that said, I wasn't so impressed on this recipe. Also had to cook it longer. 
Covering it for the first half hour or so does help keep in the moisture. Though, I don't think I'll be using this again.

I added a quarter cup of dry white wine and a few drops of lemon juice, while reducing the amount of honey a slight amount, then let marinade overnight after salting and peppering thin breast filets.
Grill marks for taste, then bake for the allotted time, and all will be fine. I served with par-boiled carrots chunks, wide chopped potatoes and medium chopped parsnips, also in the marinade. My husband was pleased that he had a roast meal in the middle of the week that had zing and character- so much so that when I turned around, he had cleared my plate too!

I took the advice of the other reviewers, cutting the honey and the paprika in half and using dion mustard instead of yellow.  Also, I made twice as much sauce and marinated the chicken for about 6 hours before baking.  It turned out nice and juicy with a mild flavor.  This recipe didn't knock my socks off, but it definitely has potential.

I'm giving this 5 stars because I am pregnant and can barely stand the kitchen right now.  This was exactly the kind of recipe I needed.  Quick and effortless.  I used part brown mustard, part yellow and probably more honey than mustard.  Didn't have parsley, but didn't miss it.  I'll do this one again.

SO SO ..as another reviewer said it does have potential. I used the Dijon and cut the paprika...the problem is no flavor. It was moist...I even put it in the oven  at 450 to sear it and left it there for 10 minutes at 450. ..then turned it to 350. Next time I'll remove the skin and marinate it for a couple days...there just was no flavor other than on the skin.

this was very tasty, and very easy - I would make it a little less sweet, maybe a 3/4 to 1/4 mustard-to-honey ratio would be better.  and i do have to admit, i didn't have dried basil or parsley, so I used thyme instead, and it was fantastic, but I don't think I changed the "essence" of the recipe with my small change - would definitely make again!

Made this for the boyfriend, and we both deemed it just "okay."  It wasn't bad, it just didn't wow us.  The chicken was nice and tender (I covered it for the first half of the cook time as others have suggested), but the flavour was just so-so.  This one isn't getting added to the "keeper" file.

This was really good. I used dijon mustard instead, but this came out really nice. I marinated it overnight in a casserole dish and just put in the oven as is for an hour, covering with aluminum foil for 45 minutes (I used larger organic breasts). It was really simple to prepare.

This is a easy, quick meal for school nights! I followed other's recommendations and cut the amount of paprika. I also used Italian seasoning instead of parsley and basil since that is what I had on hand. My daughter and I aren't huge fans of mustard but we both liked this recipe. As someone else mentioned, this chicken is great the next day cut up on top of a salad!

I made this as a mid-week meal with chicken that was in the freezer.  It turned out great! Easy to make and tasted delicious.  I did decrease the amount of paprika by about half, and I think that helped everything stay together.  Using dijon mustard was a fantastic idea.  Will definitely make again!

I have made this several times.  It is an easy weeknight dinner, and works perfect when I haven't planned anything else in advance.  Pulls together quick and uses all ingredients that I have on hand.

I thought this was wonderful!  So flavorful!!!  My husband/kids thought the mustard flavor was a little intense but it was perfect for me...I even used the leftover chicken for a cold salad the next day at work and it was just as good the second time around. thanks!

We loved this recipe.  The only changes we made were to used fresh basil (we had to use it up before it went bad!), we used dijon mustard and we cut the paprika to 1/2 tsp.  It was awesome.  My daughter and husband loved it.  I served it with the Orzo with basil and parmesan from this site.  YUMMY.

Made this last night....I was out of honey, so I used a honey dijon bottled mustard.  Didn't turn the chicken, just spponed the mixture on and baked for 45 min.  Wonderful flavor, and the chicken was soft and moist.  Definitely will make again!

Waaaaay too sweet. I should have listened to the review section and cut back on the honey. Also, I used a dijion mustard, next time i'll try yellow.

This recipe was such a big hit with my husband.  I used l/2 prepared mustard and 1/2 dijon mustard. The only other thing that I added was, when I turned the chicken, I had put some french fried onion rings (French's...the ones in the can) in my food processor and I sprinkled them on top.  It was awesome!!  We couldn't have gotten a better chicken entree at a restaurant!!!  Thanks Mary for a real keeper!!

Very good.  Just an FYI a lot of people reviewing this recipe seem confused.  Prepared mustard is not yellow mustard.  It is dijion or other mustard that has had seasoning added to it.  This recipe is not supposed to be made with plain yellow mustard.  If you use prepared mustard there is plenty of mustard flavor to the dish.

I did follow what some other people suggested in the comments such as baking in a smaller dish, covering with foil, and a little less of the paprika... it turn out great! Easy to prepare, great honey mustard sauce for whatever you want to make, and definitely moist chicken!

I made ours in the crock pot with a little home-made chicken broth added and tapioca to thicken it, and a little less paprika as a review suggested. My hubby and our dinner guest raved about it over and over all through the meal, and I couldn't believe the heaping seconds they both took! Served with mixed brown rice and quinoa, the sauce was wonderful on it.

I made this dish last night for dinner, and blew my family away! I used half of the paprika as  listed, and I also doubled the recipe for additional seasoning. I marinated the chicken for about 2 hours-next time I will do it over night.  I served oven garlic roasted potatoes and steam veggies with the chicken, and it was a wonderful meal. I used Dijon mustard and halved chicken breast and wings with the skin on. Next time I will try it on boneless, skinless chicken. I also plan to try it as suggested, on meaty fish like tilapia. Thanks for the recipe. I will definitely make it again and again.

Mmmm. So easy and yet so good. I cut the chicken into long, thick strips. I don't like having a huge chunk of meat to eat. That way, the strips had more gooey sauce! I also covered the pan with foil and removed it with about 15mins or so left for baking.

This was really good and easy to make.  I made a family size package of thighs and brushed it on and 1/2 way through, I turned the pieces and brushed the other side.  I had some left.  Very good and I will make it again.

Will make again...hubby really liked it and it was easy to make. I used 4 breasts, seasoned with S, P, GP, used Dijon mustard, and 1/2 teaspoon of all the seasonings. I also used a smaller baking dish and covered for the first 30 mins.  Served with couscous and a salad. Thanks for the recipe.

My husband was crazy about this chicken, but I was only so-so.  Something about the flavors didn't quite come together for me -- maybe the paprika?  But everyone else loved it, so I'll blame it on me and not the recipe.

I didn't have much regular honey, so I used Cherry honey and it was really good.  Next time I will cover the baking dish and possibly not bake quite as long, as it was a bit too dry.  Will definitely make again!

Amazing and very easy to make.  simple. I cut paprika in half, otherwise followed recipe.  Used chicken tenders, marinated in sauce overnight. Then baked with plenty of sauce - so they ended up moist and tender. Served with coucous with extra sauce in pitcher on the side. Lots of compiments. Great for company.

I didn't have luck with this one. I prepared the mixture and let the chicken sit in it ahead of time (about two-3 hours) like some other reviewers did. The smell was incredibly strong, and I was afraid it would just taste like mustard and nothing else. After baking it I tasted it - no mustard taste, and a dull honey flavor that barely held onto the chicken. It was a waste.

This was definitely a tasty way to make healthy chicken breasts. The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because it didn't have the wow factor. I used dijon, and only had to bake for 25 min (small chicken breasts). I didn't turn them over. If I make this again, I will brush the sauce on the chicken instead of pouring. It's pretty thin and most of it just baked onto the pan. I would brush the chicken a few times during baking to really get that flavor in there.

Fabulous taste and unbelievably simple to prepare. With my sauce, I didn't bother measuring anything...just added ingredients to taste. Added some onion powder and salt to the sauce to balance out the sweetness of the honey and I used chicken tenderloins because I need smaller portions. Just delish! For busy people and families, this is a wonderful recipe for something quick and simple without any sacrifice on taste. 5 stars. :)

We do like honey mustard in my home, so we were excited to try this. I was really disappointed, I prepared it exactly as stated, and it was unbearably sweet. I definitely will try again with a LOT less honey.

Delicious recipe! I added a tsp of Garlic Powder, and halved the paprika after reading some of these reviews, and Mmmmmmm.... rave reviews from the household, soon to become a favourite, I'm sure! Great simple recipe, and exactly what I was looking for!

This was a very good mid-week change of pace for our family dinners.  The sauce gives the chicken a great flavor and even my picky boys loved it.

I followed someone else's suggestion and covered the dish with foil during the first 30 minutes, then removed it for the last 20 minutes.  
Very moist and flavorful!

Excellent! Very easy to prepare and bake. Wonderful flavor! Followed the prep to a T. The only thing I did different was to cover with foil for the first 25 mins of baking. After turning and covering with remaining sauce, I left uncovered and baked for an additional 15 mins. Thank you so much for the delicious recipe!

This is one of my boyfriend's favorites.  I use half dijon and half yellow mustard and it always comes out delicious.  I have done it by marinating the chicken and not marinating the chicken - it comes out delicious both ways.

Delicious!!! I was unsure if my husband would like this but he loved it! I only had French's classic mustard so I used that but added a few more squirts of honey to balance out the sharp taste. Otherwise I followed the directions exactly and covered it with foil to lock in the moisture. Will definitely be making again!!

This recipe is really easy and tasty!  The one thing is, the honey mustard sauce is spicy - even at half the paprika.  If you like spicy sauce, this is perfect - otherwise, use 1/2 or 1/4 teaspoon of paprika instead of the full teaspoon.

Considering Im not a huge mustard fan this was pretty good. I used dijon mustard instead. I also cut slits in the chicken and treat it like a marinade. Some people said there wasn't enough sauce, I had quite a bit. The flavor was different but great. My man really loved it and couldn't stop eating the chicken. In my book, it's a winner!!

A little bit heavy on the mustard side for me, but I don't like spicy foods.  I thought it was good and felt that the amount of sauce it created was sufficient for me to pour over the rice that I served with it.

Went with other reviewers and halved the paprika. Also used half Dijon mustard and half yellow mustard. Easy to throw together and was gobbled up by all 5 kids and the picky brother-in-law.

I thought this was a great way to spice up boring chicken. I did follow a fe suggestions. First, I used dijon mustard, halved the paprika, and doubled the sauce. I also marinated it for 3 hours before hand. Make sure to cover the chicken with foil for the first 30 mins, it makes it so juicy and tender :)

Enjoyed this and it was easy to make.  I doubled the sauce which worked out well.  I also used 1/2 Dijon and 1/2 yellow mustard, which gave it a little zip.  I also only used 1/2 paprika.  A tasty dish and only 230 or so calories.  We had it over white rice which went good with the sauce.

Ewwww. I have tried tons of recipes frm this website, and this was by far the worst. All the ingredients by themselves sound great, but when you add them together something strange happens...
I made this for my husband and my Mom and Dad, and they actually laughed at how bad the taste of the honey mustard mixture was.

I give this a five because it was so easy to prepare and it cooked really quick.  It looked very tasty which isnt always the case.  I taseted it as soon as it came out of the oven, the taste matched everything else.  It was wonderful.  Will make again.  Here is a few pics.  Thanks.

This was a quick way to whip up a somewhat special dinner.  The marinade was good (I used Dijon mustard) and I too covered the dish with foil during the first 30 minutes of cook time and then took it off.  It was really moist and yummy!  I will make this again for sure.

Great recipe!  My husband AND my kids (2/4) really loved it. It has a very strong mustard taste but still pretty good (I guess thats why it has Mustard in the title). I didn't have any chicken breast so I used thighs and prepared it just like the recipe said and I turned out very moist. I served it with mashed potatoes and let the juices/gravy from the chicken mix in with it on the plate YUMMMY!!

This is easy to prepare and tastes pleasant, but I agree with other reviewers that it needs a little work. I omitted salting and peppering the chicken, and just added a good bit of black pepper to the sauce. I also substituted dijon mustard. Cooked uncovered as the recipe suggests, but it turned out drier and tougher than most of my chicken recipes that way. I'd recommend either covering it as others have mentioned, or adding lemon juice or wine to the sauce to make it more acidic and keep the chicken more tender. Still, it was pretty good served with couscous and steamed vegetables.

This is one of our favorites. I would say I follow the recipe but I never measure anything. When chicken is done I remove it from the baking dish turn up the heat and put the dish back in for a minute to thicken the remaining sauce as it is quite watery from all the juice of the chicken , then spoon it over the chicken for even more flavor. Usually serve with herb roasted veggies because the can go in first then cook together.

I made this for dinner and the family gobbled it up, even my teenage daughter went for seconds...as did I, which is rare. I served it with pasta and carrots. I didn't have enough honey, so I added a bit of ketchup. Also, I didn't know what "prepared mustard" was so I just used some French's Honey Mustard. Anyway, it turned out great!!

Nice blend of sweet and spicy. Used Grey Poupon mustard. Made with brown rice and poured remaining juices over the rice. Also sauteed broccoli.

I make this all the time but I use dijon mustard & a little mayo so it's not so mustard-y. It's so easy & tasty - this is a good one!

This is okay...it's easy, which is a plus, and I will make it again, but since it is way too sweet for my taste as it is, I will probably cut the honey in half and use dijon instead of regular mustard.  I did like the basil/paprika/parsley mixed in.

Mmmm this was SO GOOD. I halved the recipe and the chicken came out so juicy and flavorful. Oh man, these were great. I sliced up the chicken and put them over top of a baby romaine salad and drizzled the leftover sauce over the lettuce in place of dressing. Awesome, and SO easy.

We grilled this instead of baked and used only chicken breasts but made the same amount of sauce and used the leftover sauce for dipping. We didn't use any of the called for spices, instead, we used a 1/2 ts of minced garlic, 1 ts of worchetershire, and a 1/4 ts of ginger. The sauce had too much of a mustard bite to it, so next time I think we will only use 1/3 cup mustard and maybe add some brown sugar. We also brushed the sauce on some fresh pineapple that we grilled and that was even better than the chicken! Overall, fast and very easy and pretty tasty with some adjustments. Will make again.

My family and I enjoyed this chicken recipe.  It was quick and easy to make and it was delicious to eat.  I liked the honey and mustard flavor.  I will probably add more dried parsley the next time I try this recipe.

I thought this was way too sweet. I will try it again with some lemon juice to tone down the sweetness.  The cooking time was also way too long, I checked mine after 20 minutes and it was already a bit over-done.  It was really quick and easy to prepare though.

I marinated the chicken breasts overnight in the casserole dish, so all I had to do was put it in the oven when I was ready. I put foil over the dish until it was time to flip the chicken, then left it uncovered (like one reviewer suggested).  I also used a smaller baking dish. They turned out nice and juicy.  My husband hates sweet sauces, and he had 2 helpings!

This was fantastic!  It was so easy to prepare, and it was eaten up very quickly.  I wasn't sure if my children would care for it, since they think pepper makes things spicy, but they gobbled it up and told me that I should make it often!  Thanks for the recipe!

WOW! Quick, easy and the family loved it!  We used skinless thighs, and the honey-mustard permeated the meat.  Even my teenagers who are hard to please raved about it!  (I think I might use a little less mustard next time, and I did drizzle honey over the chicken in the pan...) Regardless of those changes it ROCKS!!!!

I thought the flavor of this would be right up our alley, but it turned out "only okay"... not remarkable.  However, I gave it 4 stars instead of 3 because it was so dang easy!  (Thought that was worth a star..)  Perhaps marinating chicken overnight in the honey mustard mixture would add more flavor.  I made the recipe as per instructions given.

Loved it! It smells delicious when it comes out of the oven and it tastes great. I ran out of normal mustard so I substituted dijon for the rest. I've also tried this recipe with chicken legs, these work well, but it takes longer for them to be cooked through.

Everybody loved this.  Cooked it covered with foil for the first 30 minutes, uncovered for the last 15.  So tender it hardly need a knife! I added 1 tsp of garlic powder to the sauce and marinated the chicken in it all day.  I'll definitely make this again! Thanks for an easy dish sutable for company!

Quick and easy. Reduce basil and paprika in half and use dijon mustard. Cover with foil and reduce cooking time to 30 minutes. It was too sweet for my taste.

Easy to make and my kids loved it. (So did my husband)  My four year old even helped me make it.  I also used chicken tenders instead of chicken breasts!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was only the second dish I have prepared from allrecipes.com.  My children enjoyed this dish.  That's an accomplishment.  I used chicken tenders instead of chicken breasts, and it worked great.  I am sure I'll be making this again.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe, Mary.

This recipe was very good. It was sweet but not TOO sweet. I didn't have any basil, so I made it without it, but it still tasted good. My husband liked it and he said he would like me to make it again.

I made this for the first time last week when we had friends over for dinner. It was a huge hit! I  didn't change the recipe at all, and the best part was the quick no fuss method of cooking especially since I didn't have alot of time to prepare a gourmet meal!! I'll be making this again for sure.

It was much better than going to a restaurant and getting some chicken strips and dipping in honey mustard sauce. Not a big fan of honey mustard. Will cook again, but not a favorite.

my roomate and I thought this recipe was different when we couldn't smell it when it was cooking.  After tasting it-ONCE-we decided that was all we needed.  We think it was way too bland and needed something but we couldn't figure out what.

Pretty tasty, although it's not a miracle dinner.  Flavor was a 3 or 4 out of 5, but the prep time was great.  Since it was so easy, I'll make it again when I'm in a rush.

Really wonderful recipe, so quick and easy! I would recommend using Dijon mustard instead of prepared. Adding a little mayo to the sauce mellows out the flavor a bit.

I made this for my fiance and I. This is a great, low fat dish. I would recommend playing around with spices as the parsley got to be a bit much, but it was very good and tender! I'm making this again TONIGHT!

Delicious.  Chicken is moist and the tangy sauce tastes great with white rice.  I added garlic and used a honey spice mustard.  A quick and easy way to impress your dinner guests.

I sliced large mushrooms and added them with the second round of the mixture....excellent!

I used dijon mustard instead of prepared mustard and threw in a teaspoon of horseradish (I don't have kids though!).  Great dish and amazing moistness for a chicken recipe without a marinade.

The whole family loved this recipe.  It went together quickly with all the ingreadients readily available.  No shopping for special ingreadients.  I did think the basil was a little too strong.  Next time I will try 3/4 tsp.  Will be making this one again.  Thanks!

I wish I were as good a cook as some people here are.  This was easy to prepare, soothed the palate better than a fine wine, and reminded me why I tend not to cook Good Stuff anymore:  my wife snaps it up faster than a starved dog.

I recommend this highly to anyone who wants a pure taste sensation without having to spend a lot of money or time at the supermarket.

Contrary to previous reports, I did not find the basil overwhelming, but everyone's different.  I did not use dijon mustard, just Plockman's.  Worked for me.

I've recently tried several recipes from this site, and this is the best one yet!  I cut my chicken breasts into smaller pieces, used only honey and dijon mustard, salt, pepper and paprika.  It was fabulous.  Must keep your eyes on the oven for cooking time.  Also, I'll be trying this with some pineapple added and some other things.  Very easy, also an easy cleanup.  I'm thrilled to have found this recipe!  Thanks!

This is an excellent dish - especially good served
over rice with the leftover sauce poured over all and
a little bit of soy sauce. It's not very often that
my husband requests the same dish every week!

use a lot more honey and less mustard unless you prefer your honey mustard to be on the very tangy side.  Very easy dish.

One of the easiest chicken recipes and tastes good too. Would add some crushed red pepper for more spice though...

My husband and family love love love this recipe. It's pretty quick for a weeknight dinner. I serve it with rice and fresh green beans. I also mix in dijon mustard (half) and dollop of horseradish mustard (hubby loves it) for a kick. It  is even great as lunch the next day if you let it marinate in some leftover sauce overnight.

A new favorite!! I recommend marinating it for a few hours, covering with tin foil for the first half then baking it uncovered, using half the paprika recommended, and using dijon mustard instead of yellow to get more flavor. I used clover honey. It would be great in salads but I just serve it with some rice. Excellent recipe, satisfied even my picky eaters :)

Ok I admit I read others reviews of this first.  I marinated the chicken for about 30 minutes  because of what others said.  I cooked it in an 8 inch by 8 inch square pan since I made it for 2 people instead of 6 but I didn't cut anything else out except for less chicken and only 1/2 teaspoon of paprika.  I added 1 teaspoon of garlic powder, 1 teaspoon of onion powder and 2 tablespoons of soy sauce in with the other spices.  Dumped everything in the cooking pan after marinating, cover it for 30 minutes with foil, then uncovered it for the final 15 minutes.  It was delicious!  I also had it over fried rice with biscuits and green beans on the side.  Great, easy recipe!

Spectacular recipe, but it needed a few fixes. I followed another reviewers suggestions and reduced the paprika to a scant 1/2 teaspoon and used Dijon mustard. I also omitted the dried parsley, as I didn't have any, and used sweet basil instead of regular. I cut the chicken into smaller, more bite-sized, pieces and kept an eye on it in the oven. My family raved about it! I served it with Chef John's Asparagus Souffle. Great combo!

It was very good. I used spicy brown mustard instead of plain yellow. I will be making this again. I will probably add a little extra honey to it next time also.

Very easy but flavourful.  Used half Dijon and half regular Mustard.  For spices used some basil and coriander instead of parsley.  Marinated for about 1 hr and baked with tinfoil cover the entire time

Husband said its his favorite chicken dish! Making it again tonight. One thing i would also suggest is covering the dish with foil for the first 30 minutes, then removing it for the last 15 minutes. Good stuff!

Absolutely delicious! My wife seldom tries any new dishes, but after smelling the chicken before it even came out of the oven she was eager to dig in. This recipe has turned out to be one of our favorites.

This recipe was great. I did add a little lime to the sauce and I cut the paprika in half. I cooked each side for 20 minutes covered with foil it was very juicy.  I would cook this again

I don't think it matters that much what kind of mustard (I used spicy brown mustard) you use as the honey cuts down the mustard-y taste. I also cut down the paprika amount as suggested by another reviewer but again I don't think it made that much difference. I also took the suggestion to cover the dish with foil for the first 30 min which I think was a mistake. I felt that it prevented the honey mustard mixture from "baking" onto the chicken. Don't know if the mixture was suppose to end up that runny. Not sure if I'll make this again but if I do I'm just going to follow the exact recipe but maybe marinate the chicken in the mixture for a bit.

I like this a lot. It's simple to whip up after working all day. I don't mix honey and mustard, instead I just use honey mustard and double up on it. So if the recipe calls for 1 tablespoon of honey and 1 table spoon of mustard I just go ahead and use 2 table spoons of honey mustard.

Easy to make, I did an additional "turn" and applied the sauce in thirds.  Chicken was moist.  Didnt have any paprika so used 1/2 a teaspoon of cayenne instead.

I used no salt and seasoned pepper, which is spicier than regular pepper. I baked it for only 30 minutes keeping the chicken moist but fully cooked. Excellent and quick meal.

I made this recipe exactly as stated, and it was just okay. However, my nephew really liked it and specifically requested it the next time he was coming for the weekend, so this time I marinated the chicken in the glaze overnight before baking, and covered the glass dish with tin foil for most of the cooking time in a smaller pan to help hold in the juices. I also upped the amount of spices a bit and used Dijon mustard. My nephew, who is 11 by the way haha, suggested that I try this chicken in the crock pot and shred it and serve over rice or mashed potatoes. Maybe I will! Smart kid, takes after his aunt.

I have made this recipe many times as written. It is my 8 year old son's favorite meal. Everyone I have made this for has loved it! I also love how easy and quick it is to make. We serve it with mashed potatoes. I double the sauce and put it on my potatoes. Yum!

Cooked it on the stove top because it was just too hot to use the oven. Marinated it a few hours too. Set aside some of the sauce to serve with the chicken.

The chicken was tender and moist. The chicken itself was perfect. The sauce was just Ok. It was not sweet enough or tangy enough.  Either would have been better than this strange, bland taste. I will not make it again.

I followed the recipe exactly using Soy chicken (we are vegetarians) and Henry's Humdingers for the honey.  The humdingers added a great deal of layered flavor.  This is a must for any family

This was great! Easy. Had all ingredients in the cupboard. Chicken came out moist and flavorful. Definitely a keeper.

Very good. I may have used a little too much basil for us, but next time I'll adjust.  A keeper for sure. Easy and delicious.

Fabulous! Not a single piece leftover in our home. I've already got requests for this meal again. Used half Dijon and covered with foil for the first half of baking. I'll do it again like that.

I am a vegetarian but still cook meat for my husband, and I am cooking blindly since I can't taste!  I followed this recipe nearly exactly as written, and based on his reaction (he ate it all in one night!) I give it five stars.  He is a sauce-guy, so I took someone's advice and made extra sauce, and we like spicey so I added a tsp of crushed pepper flakes.  I know if he eats it all it's a hit, especially if all at once.  So thank you for a great recipe, it's a keeper and will live in my recipe box forever!

Made it following a lot of suggestions from other users. Baked with foil in an aluminum pan and flipped after 20 min and recoated. Super easy to make and was great for leftovers!

The honey mustard is out of this world.  While it was cooking, my husband went into the kitchen for something.  When he came back, the first words out of his mouth was how amazing it smelled in the kitchen.  The honey mustard tasted just as great.  This time I used regular yellow mustard.  I think I'll try using dijon or spicy mustard next time just to see if one is better than the other.

After getting sick of making the same recipes regularly I found this fast and easy chicken recipe to be exactly what we were looking for!  The BEST past of this recipe is how easy it is to prepare!  I used 1 1/2 lbs chicken tenderloins and marinated them in the sauce after adding garlic to the recipe. Baked them for 30 minutes at 350 after 1 hour of marinating, and I threw the sauce and the chicken into the 11x7 pan.  It tasted beautiful.  Next time we are going to pair this with some wild rice because the sauce makes a ton if you're using tenderloins and we could have easily made a casserole.  Perfect for weeknights!  Perfect for weight friendly main dishes!

Very good recipe simple. I did marinate the chicken thighs and legs I used for about 30 minutes. My husband was skeptical but loved it after he tried it.
Kids liked it too.

this chicken was so good! juicy and delicious! taking a little advice from reviewers, I used ½ Dijon mustard and ½ yellow mustard, cut down on the paprika to just over ½ teaspoon and used a smaller baking dish to help keep the chicken surrounded in the marinade. I would NOT cut down on the basil as some have suggested – it really gave this dish an awesome flavor! I served this with the “Spinach and Sweet Corn Mashed Potatoes” recipe from this site. yummy! when I make this again, I will try marinating the chicken for a little while before cooking – it can only get better! thanks, Mary, for the great recipe.

Just made it for dinner and it was delicious.  I didn't have chicken so I used turkey tenderloins which worked well.  I thought the seasonings were great, so did my hubby.  I made pan roasted fresh asparagus steamed in white wine for myself and he had steak fries and baked beans.  We were both happy with the delicious turkey which we will finish off tomorrow on salads.  Thanks for submitting it.

This was so easy and used things I already had available.  The only thing I did wrong was that I didn't use enough chicken!!  Had 4 breasts thawed for another recipe that I did not have all of the ingredients for and found this recipe to save the day.  So I went with the 4 breasts I had and they were NOT enough.  I wanted leftovers!

I love this recipe! I gave it a try a few nights ago and even my picky husband loved it. He doesn't generally like anything sweet, but this was the perfect combination of sweet and savory. I didn't change a thing in this recipe, I made it as is and it is a keeper! Thanks for sharing!!

Need to be a mustard lover for this one, I found the mustard flavor to be overwhelming. I followed the recipe except using half regular and half Dijon mustard and less paprika. Won't be making it again as neither my husband or I liked it. One of my few disappointments on Allrecipes, but probably due to personal taste.

I LOVE honey mustard so I thought that with the high ratings I would love this recipe. This recipe has potential. I used Dijon mustard like many of the reviewers suggested. When it was done the honey overpowered the mustard and it was basically honey chicken (which doesn't taste as good as it sounds). I would suggest cutting down the honey maybe to 1/4 cup.

Served this to company and it was a hit! Mashed potatos and a veggie on the side all are good with the sauce.

I thought this recipe was great as is. I used it on bone in chicken thigh with the skins removed. It was very moist & juicy with just the right amount of honey mustard taste. I'm looking forward to trying it again with chicken breast. Thank you.

Made this for dinner tonight and it was DELISH!!! Following the reviews of other, I used honey Dijon mustard (though a full cup instead of half) and cut down on the honey just a tad. Marinated for two hours and paired with a broken spaghetti risotto that I also found on this site. Yum! This is a must make, will be repeating it!

This is awesome!!!  Instead of all the different herbs I used a tsp of herbs de provence and a tsp of italian seasoning (I only used a pound of chicken).  This one is good.

This recipe was amazing! I doubled the sauce, as others have done, and the chicken came out so amazingly juicy and tender - it was as if I had marinated it overnight! My husband loved it so much he asked if he could just drink the sauce lol. This will definitely be a repeat for us :-)

For a recipe that is very fast and simple to prepare, its very tasty. I used dijon mustard and covered in foil for first 30 minutes, uncovered for last fifteen minutes and it was very moist and flavourful. Served it over rice and spooned some of the sauce from the pan over it, it was really good! Thanks for the recipe...

Cut paprika in 1/2. Double the sauce.  Use 1/2 regular mustard and 1/2 Dijon mustard. Marinade for as long as possible.   Make sure you scoop the sauce on the chicken before serving.  very good.

It was a very easy dish to make. Enjoyed it very much except for the basil. I'll leave that out the next time. Using the foil in the ist hour really kept it tender. My wife loved it, first time she's cleaned her plate in along time. The leftovers were still moist the next day.

This was quick and easy, and the chicken comes out verrrry tender when cooked this way, so I really liked it for the amount of effort required. It could stand some dressing up if you have the time; however, this works on its own if you want something fast that requires just a few ingredients.

Holy wow, was this good!  I marinated the meat overnight (I had a 2-person sized pork roast so used that instead of chicken) and it was AMAZING. I made it as the recipe specified, no alterations.

Really easy and really delicious!!! I used some Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb seasoning instead of basil, paprika and parsley. Then I added some brown sugar to the mixture and less honey.

I made this tonight for supper and it is simply delicious!  The only thing I changed was that I used Dijon mustard instead of regular yellow mustard.  As per other reviewers suggestions, I covered the chicken with foil for the first 30 minutes.  This is a quick and easy recipe but most important, it is really tasty!  Thanks Mary for posting!

Wow! That was delicious! I subbed dijon mustard for yellow and omitted the paprika (allergies) and it was amazing.  I had 6 rather large pieces of chicken so it filled a 9x13 pan and the chicken was pretty well covered with the marinade even though I reserved half of it.  I covered it with foil for the first half and left it uncovered for the 2nd half of the cooking.  Because the pieces were so big it took closer to an hour to bake.  Yum! I will be making this for my family again as well as taking it when I deliver meals for life events.

This was very easy to make and had great flavor.  My only issue was that it was a bit sweet, so I would up the mustard and lower the honey next time.

I made this for supper today and was very pleased with the results. I scaled the recipe back to 4 servings for 2 chicken breast halves, I then used the remaining sauce for dipping at the table. Will very likely make again but I will cut the baking time back to 30 minutes as the meat was quite dry despite following the recommendations of other reviewers and covering with foil for the first half-hour.

This recipe is great! So easy and fast, and not terribly fattening. My family loved it! I added a tiny bit of curry to it.

My husband and I loved this recipe. It was delicious and super easy to make. I did a few things differently, as people suggested in the comments. I marinated it first for 30 minutes (poked holes in the chicken with a fork). To marinate it I doubled the sauce/spice recipe (but only had 3 large pieces of chicken). Except the paprika I kept at 1 teaspoon since some people said it was overpowering in its original ratio. Then I still cooked it for 30 minutes one side and 10 on the other. The only problem with marinating is that it wastes a lot of honey and mustard. You need a lot to fully cover the chicken, but then it ends up just getting tossed out after cooking.

This was great! I had chicken and didn't know how I wanted to cook it, found this recipe and it is amazing! I had all the ingredients home so I didn't even have to worry about not having an ingredient. I used spicy brown mustard instead of regular mustard and it was GREAT!

I prepared this tonight for dinner. And I had a bottle of pre-mixed honey mustard so I just added basil and used garlic salt with parsley to season the chicken. After 20-30 minutes, I sliced the meat open to check done-ness and tried it too for flavor. And boy it was overpowering both smell and flavor. So I am taking this off my recipes.

I hate honey and my sister doesn't like mustard but we decided to try it anyway. We both really liked it so did my husband, and I've made it twice already. The chicken is a little tender so I'd say just cook it a little longer.

This chicken was great!!  Even my mom (who is the fussiest in the house) liked it!  We like things a little sweeter so I only used 1/3 cup of musturd and used a combo of chicken thighs and chicken breasts.  Will make this again and soon!

This recipe was not what I expected.  It was very tender and moist, especially when you bake it covered with foil for the first 30 minutes.  But it wasn't the strong honey mustard flavor I was looking for, which is odd seeing at it has both honey and mustard for the sauce.  If you go into this recipe expecting a honey mustard flavor you may be disappointed.  But if you go into this recipe wanting a flavorful, tender chicken experience it wasn't bad at all.

Very good! My boyfriend and roommate loved it! I used about half the paprika, only basted the chicken and lowered the cooking time and it was still great. I'm marinate for sure next time!

The sauce was an appealing mixture of sweet and tangy. It didn't, however, have a whole lot of flavor. It just kind of briefly said hello and then that was it. I'd recommend using left-over sauce in the pan for dipping.

I used our fancy chipotle mustard, added onions to the bottom of the (foiled) baking pan, garlic powder to the marinade, chopped potatoes, a chipotle pepper and halved the paprika amount.  This recipe will work with many different types of mustards, but yellow might be too bland. I marinated for around an hour.

We served over brown rice and I made the sauce for 4 servings but only used 3 chix breast halves.  I didn't mess with the honey amount and b/c of the chipotle pepper, the sauce wasn't too sweet.

We will definitely repeat.  I baked the chix and potatoes covered in foil for 30 mins, flipped the chicken pieces, covered again and cooked for another 15. Then took the chix out of the pan and covered in foil to let set. Raised temp to 425* and covered/baked the potatoes for around 10 mins.

This was really easy and tasted great!!  I too used dejon mustard and reduced the amount of paprika. I made this on a hot day and din't want to turn on the oven so I grilled it on the BBQ, brushing on more of the marinade as it cooked. Very tasty

Excellent!  I didn't have time to cook it in the oven so I used a little oil and cooked in the frying pan.  They were great.  I marinaded in the pan and used about half the marinade in the frying pan to cook it.  This one's a keeper!

I'm always looking for new ways to make chicken and since my hubs is a honey mustard fanatic, I thought this one would be great.


I didn't have enough honey to make 1/2 cup. I only had about 1/4 cup, and I also added 1/2 tsp garlic powder and the sauce tasted perfect and had just the right amount of sweetness. I had three bone in breast's so I upped the oven temp to 375 and layered the chicken on a bed of onions as well. It smelled so yummy while cooking and tasted great too. Hubby gave it a double thumbs up!

This wasn't a bad recipe, but I think I expected a different taste than what was the end result. Again, it wasn't bad, but I think there could be a lot of ways to improve it. This chicken would be great on a salad though!

This is a pretty simple and basic sauce but I really liked it. I was only making two breasts, actually one huge breast that I sliced into two so I just squirted equal parts of yellow mustard and honey until it looked like there would be enough. I didn't have basil so just used paprika and parsley. This was really good with my leftover pasta and bechamel sauce.

Better than I expected! I followed the recipe exactly and really liked it as is. I poured the sauce over the chicken and marinated for about three hours before baking. Used a smaller pan, so as to keep the chicken covered in the sauce. Will definitely make again.

Very tasty!  I like it a bit less sweet, so I add slightly more mustard and use slightly less honey.  I also added some garlic, made it with garlic powder and another time with minced garlic.  Baked covered then uncovered for the last 5 minutes.  Have made it several times now, and need to go buy more mustard so I can make it again!

Ok, not great.  Definitely not a hit with my kids who thought it too "mustardy". I made this recipe without the paprika or dried basil since I didn't have any on hand.  I don't know if the spices made that big of a difference.

Very tasty and easy to make . I didn't know if I would like the taste of honey mustard baked on my chicken, but surpriseingly it was mild, yet nicely herbed flavored and moist. jWill definitely make again.

Wonderful, i used chicken tender stripes instead because I couldnt find thin chicken breast like i typically like to use. I used regular mustard not dijon even though like many have suggested it. But i also marinated the chicken for atleast 6 hours before baking. It was so moist and flavorful!

Was good, would be really good served over a fresh spinach salad with the honey mustard. Marinated the chicken for a few hours and used honey mustard rather then regular mustard.

My girls and I thought it was great... though when I told them what I was making for dinner, my response was a couple of wrinkled noses. I knew the youngest (and pickiest) approved when she declared that she wanted to take the leftovers as her lunch at school tomorrow! PS: I didn't change a thing - just served with rice and zucchini sauteed with basil. Fabulously Easy.

Was simple to make and my daughter loved the mustard sauce. The chicken was moist. Skipped the paprika since I was out but threw in a T of itailian soice to add a bit. We all loved it and my daughter even used the mustard sauce on her spinach.

This is very tasty my husband commented 3 times during dinner. After I turned the chicken over to continue cooking I minced up some fresh garlic on the chicken, very very nice!  I served it with Basmati rice which I put in orange and lemon zest while I cooked it. Really nice! Next time I will make extra sauce.

This recipe was "okay", good combination of flavors, and my little one and husband loved it.. me not so much... i liked it and that was about it. Served over rice to catch all the "sauce", and fresh veggies. Thanks for the recipe.   Will make again, with a few variations. :)

Very moist and good flavor, did cook covered for 20 minutes, then uncover for addt'l 15.  Will play with seasonings next time; definitely use 1/2 the paprika. Easy to prepare.

This is a great recipe - Cut paprika in half as previously suggested.  I  prepare this by cutting the chicken breast into chunks, baking covered in foil for 20 minutes, then uncover.  It is a tangy tasty chicken dish!

This was divine!  Very simple and quick to prepare, I stuck pretty close to the recipe as written, the only changes being I used 5 chicken drumsticks with bone and skin, added a few cloves of chopped garlic to the sauce, used red pepper instead of paprika (all I had) and used fresh herbs rather than dried.  I used the grey poupon country dijon style mustard and it turned out great - sweet and spicy and sticky and wonderful.  I will DEFINITELY be making this again.  Thank you!

This was so easy and so moist! My family loved it! The only thing I did different was.. I only had a small amount of plain yellow mustard.. I has some honey mustard.. I used them both.. and I added garlic powder to the mixture.. I also used kosher salt.. it has a great flavor! I will be fixing it again!

Absolutely love this recipe!! I put all the sauce in at the beginning making sure the chicken ( which I butterfly first) is coated on both sides. This way I don't have to turn and baste during the baking. It's delish and perfect for family and/or company. I didn't need to change the spices at all.

Followed recipe exactly and it was very good ... may reduce the paprika next time, but it definitely has good flavor, though a bit strong, as is, too. Great over rice and served with vegetables as a side.

Wonderful! I used prepared honey mustard, a little extra honey and thinned it w/olive oil. Didn't bother to marinade, just grilled the breasts and spread on at the end of grilling. Son and hubby both loved it. I will make this again.

It was very flavorful.  I used dijon instead of yellow, which may have been why it was a really strong flavor.  Very good, very distinctive.  A sophisticated flavor for not much work at all.

I would give this an average rating. The chicken was very moist, but the sauce was very strong. If we try it again, I will definitely do different ratios of the ingredients :)

My chicken turned out a bit dry. Next time I'll cover it with foil to bake for 15 minutes and then bake the remaining time uncovered. Overall a good taste and it's something different.

Chicken was very moist. I made it with chicken tenders instead of breasts because it was what I had in my freezer.  The butter/water mixture drowned the chicken tenders so the bread crumb topping was soaking wet...I was looking forward to the crispy--my own fault!

The sauce turned out great but once cooked, the flavor didn't come through the chicken as well as I wanted. I think it definitely needs to be marinated, overnight if possible, in order for the chicken to really soak up the flavor. I spooned a little of the excess sauce over white rice and veggies and it was yummy.

This recipe was super good, but I'm grading it one star lower because the perfection had to be achieved using the rated suggestions of increasing the mustard and decreasing the honey. I will definitely try this again!

Great but I used less mustard so my kids would find it more mild.

I made this recipe with plain ol' regular mustard. I like this recipe - it turned out well. Next time I think I will use less honey...I like a little more "zing" than sweet in my honey mustard. But overall, good. Wish it had a little extra "pep" to it though.

My family and I enjoyed the recipe. It is a quick and simple way to change chicken. I will also do as one subscriber did and grill it next time.

I omit the salt and use stone ground mustard. This is always a hit and the extra sauce that has been cooked gets used over mashed potatoes. If I need it to cook a little faster, I flatten the meat out until it's about a 1/2" thick.

Fantastic. I followed other reviewers suggestions and placed in a smaller baking dish. I also doubled the sauce (not the spices though). I covered the chicken for 1/2 hour, then turned over, and continued cooking uncovered. Total cook time was nearly an hour with the additional sauce.

I took the advice of others and put half of the recommended amount of paprika.   I finished off the dish with feta cheese.  The cheese served as a nice contrast to the sweetness of the honey.  This will be made again!

This recipe is delicious! My eight year old son, who HATES mustard ate two pieces of chicken! I ended up cutting the mustard down a bit and not adding the paprika, and it was delicious. I love the fact I had every ingredient on hand.

This was very good.  I used a spicy mustard b/c hubby likes food with a little kick.  Also, as others suggested, I covered with foil for the first 30 minutes.  I like this recipe because you can alter it to suit your tastes.

I had a bottle of Ken's Honey Mustard (dressing?) on hand, so I used that instead of honey and mustard.  It was phenomenal.  My husband is picky when it comes to chicken, but both he and I gobbled it up!  Next time I will try it with actual honey and mustard.

I'd say this recipe is just ok; although my bf really enjoyed it.  While I had had enough before finishing the 1st helping, he had 2 helpings.  The chicken was very moist and flavorful (it was good, definitely not disgusting), it just wasn't a flavor that I wanted too much of.  The only changes that I made were: cutting the paprika in half and using only 1/3c. of Dijon mustard.  I agree with other reviewers that the basil and parsley were too much.  I may try this one again as a base with some tweaking, but in the meantime, I think I will continue to look for another recipe.

Loved this recipe!!! It had the perfect amount of sweetness and tangyness from the mustard that made this into a wonderful dish! I added some freshly crushed garlic and fresh basil to the marinade. I put skewers through the chicken cutlets, let it marinate for about 4 hours and the grilled them! It was a big hit in our family (usually anything that is on a skewer gets eatten!) A personal preference - I like this recipe better than the onles that call for honey and soy sauce - because this recipe (honey and mustard keeps the chicken cutlets as a light color after grilled. I don't like how the sot sauce "stains" the cutlets to a deeper/darker brown color, looking like dark meat.) This recipe is a sure keeper!

I am giving this 4 stars because my husband and kids gave it 4 stars. I did not care for it though. It is super easy. Even though I didn't care for it, I would recommend you give it a try since you may like it. Afterall, I was the only one in my family who didn't care for it.

I made a couple of changes to the recipe and it still turned out fabulous!  I used dijon mustard instead of prepared and the sauce was still amazing.  I also added cubed seasoned red potatoes around the chicken so our side cooked with the main dish. My boyfriend was most impressed.  This recipe is very simple to follow and the sauce is wonderfu.  I can't wait to make it again!!

This recipe was very good.  I followed some of the reviews that others did by using spicy brown mustard and adding some pineapple chunks.  It was very moist and flavorful.

very good recipe, husband loved it. i'm going to try and make this again with different mustards, although yellow mustard worked very well this time.  also, the reviewer who said to make it in a smaller pan might have had a smart idea.  also trying that next time just to keep more of the juice on more of the chicken.

It was good. Living in France I used Dijon mustard which I believe is much stronger. I think this recipe is better once cold, in a sandwich for exemple.

Spectacular flavor.  Sweet and just spicy enough.  Isn't a really strong flavor though, which is why it only gets the four stars.  If you like really strong flavors, this one probably isn't for you.

Quick and easy to prepare.  I was running low on honey, so I cut the glaze part of the recipe in half, and it was still enough to adequately cover 6 chicken breasts.  I also covered the dish with foil for the first half of the cooking time.  The chicken came out very moist and just the right amount of flavor.

This recipe was great- I covered the chicken as well, but I would omit the parsley, it had too strong of an after taste.

Excellent easy recipe I'm sure I will use again & again!  I followed others' advice and used dijon mustard as well as all of the other spices in the recipe.  It was perfect - not bland or overpowering.  I also covered with foil for 40 mins (thick chicken breasts) then flipped & removed for the last 10 minutes.  I sliced the chicken and spooned sauce on top then served with stuffing and green peas.  My husband loved as did my two young children!!

I used Dijon mustard and left out the basil, but did the rest the same. It was so good, we had it two nights in a row:) Thanks for the yummy recipe!

Awesome! I baked it in a small pan and covered it for the first 15 minutes (as another suggested). I also doubled the sauce and smothered mashed potatoes with it. Wow. So yummy. Everyone loved it. It's so simple you can't go wrong!

I followed the advice of others and covered my chicken when cooking, and it turned out pretty moist and tender; however, the sauce just didn't wow me.  Personally, the basil flavor was a little strong, and the sauce was very thin even though I baked it in a small dish.  I may make this again, but I'll probably leave out the basil.

This was good.  I made as written except no salt.  I used chicken tenders because that's what I had thawed and they took about 45 minutes to cook.  I covered with foil for the first 20 minutes, turned the chicken, removed the foil and baked for another 25 minutes.  It was very moist.  My husband thought there was too much basil, so I may cut that to 1/2 tsp next time.

Very delicious!  I don't have basil or parsley in the cupboard so I left those out, but I add some dijon mustard when I have it.  This is very easy and quick if you cook it on a George Foreman grill instead of in the oven.  If you try it this way make sure you cover your grill with aluminum foil and nonstick spray or you will spend more time cleaning up than you did cooking.  Great with mashed potatoes!

Excellent, the only thing I did differently was to reduce the mustard very slightly, as the dijon mustard I use is very strong. This was quick and easy enough to make on a work night. My husband didn't stop raving about it for about an hour after. Thankyou so much.

This was very tasty but I suggest having an extra batch of sauce at the table.  The sauce is pretty thin and drizzled off the chicken while cooking.

After reading the reviews, I decided to make 8 chicken breasts (it was for company) and I used 1/2 cup of honey with 1/2 cup of Dijon mustard and I omitted the basil altogether as it does not belong with the rest of these ingredients.  I poured half of the sauce on the chicken and turned the breasts over after about 22 minutes of baking and added the other half of the sauce.  My total bake time was 45 minutes at 350 degrees and the chicken was moist and flavorful-my company really enjoyed it.

I thought this was excellent. I am a vegetarian, so I make all of the chicken breast recipes with a product called "Naked Cutlets" by Quorn. They look just like chicken breasts, and they have an awesome flavor. I haven't eaten meat in 10 years, so I couldn't really compare the taste to real chicken, but they tasted wonderful in this recipe. I will definately be making this again!

My family LOVES this recipe.  I have even had to make it twice in the same week because my husband loves it so much and my 6yr old chef is always wanting to help me make the sauce.  This recipe is the reason why honey is always on my grocery list.

This was delicious!  I did change a few things though.  I didn't have any chicken, so I used pork chops, and I added minced garlic and left out the paprika.  The ccoking time was only about half an hour, only because the pork chops were so much thinner than chicken would have been.  But the taste-WOW!  It was great.  Easy to prepare, too.

This was so good!!  I left out the basil like others suggested.  My six year old daughter even said this was wonderful and she's picky! I did chicken strips instead of breast because it's easier for the kids and I also covered it for the first 30 minutes and then uncovered for the last amount of time.  You could use the sauce over alot of different kinds of meats.  Thanks for our new favorite sauce!

This was easy and delicious.  I did find the basil to be an awkward flavor combination - will leave that out next time.  (I tasted the sauce before I added it, and wish I had stopped before)  I used spicy brown mustard and fresh parsley.  The chicken was moist, a beautiful golden brown color and with additional fresh parsley sprinkled just before serving, it was tasty and pretty enough for company.

This was such a great recipe! Next time I am going to cut my chicken into strips so that more sauce is on it.

I rarely like eating chicken, so when my husband was making this i was preparing to cook something else for me instead. BUT OMG this chicken recipe is fabulous. It was that good that I even ate another helping of chicken!!! Only thing i suggest doing different is doubling the sauce!!

This was different.  Great taste and easy to make!  I did make some changes, however.  I used whole grain dijon mustard and I cut up a whole chicken and doubled the sauce.  I didn't add the parsley flakes since I didn't have any on me but what I did do was marinate the chicken in 3/4 of the sauce for 2 1/2 hours.  I then poured the rest of the sauce in and covered the chicken while baking.  I baked it for 30min, turned over the pieces, and baked again for 45min.  I let it stand for 10min and voila!  Served over hot rice.  Thanks!

Good and easy!  I baked at 360 for a few minutes less because I was in a hurry.  Only made 2 chicken breasts and used 1/4 cup of both dijon mustard and honey.  Served with brown rice and steamed broccoli.  Nice and healthy!

I was looking for a tasty lower-fat honey mustard chicken recipe (my mom's calls for a fair amount of butter) and this one is great.  I used spicy brown mustard to kick it up another notch!  Also, because some reviewers thought it was too dry, I covered the dish with foil for the first 30 min.  Then left it uncovered after I added the rest of the sauce.  This kept the chicken moist.

This turned out pretty well.  I thickened the sauce a bit and added a little more paprika than I probably should have, but it turned out for the best.  It was a big hit for dinner that night, and the leftovers were just as good.

Great for non-Martha's. I was a little skeptical at first but this was delicious! I am trying to cook meals for the week at once to help with time.  This freezes well and is great after reheating. 

I took the advice of others and used slightly less mustard.

Thanks for the great recipe, Mary. My family really liked this dish. I took the advice of other reviewers and left out the basil, and put in just the tiniest smidgen of dill. I also added just a tiny shake of Frank's RedHot sauce to the mustard,honey and spice mixture, which gave it a really nice accent, and a little zing. My picky 6 year old when asked his opinion about the chicken said "It's great...I love it!" I didn't expect that. But, it's unanimous, I will be making this again!

This was very easy, and the sauce was creamy and delicious. I increased the basil and parsley a lot (about 3 tablespoons total) and used some dijon mustard, too. Top the chicken with toasted almond slivers before baking.

I give it 4 3/4!!!  This is awesome.  The only problem I had with it is that the basil is a little overpowering.  Next time, I'll cut back on that a little bit.  Other than that, great easy recipe!

Tried this last night and it was really good and easy easy easy.  I did marinate the chicken for about 3 hours.  I thought the flavor was good (may try it with a stronger mustard next time). Oh and I baked it covered with foil for the first 30 minutes.  Also, took others advise about omitting the Basil.  This will definately become a regular dinner in our home.

My boyfriend and I LOVED this- it was very quick and easy!  I love it when I have the ingredients already!  Followed others' advice and cut down the Basil; used honey mustard to add sweetness.  Very good, kinda with a kick!  Will make extra sauce next time- yummy!

I made this one night when all I had in the freezer were chicken breasts and I wanted something other than just baked chicken.
I made this honey mustard chicken up and Wow! did it taste like something you'd get in a restaurant.  I couldn't believe how the flavor seeped through the whole chicken breast. Quite yummy.

This sauce is fine before baking, but after loses it's punch.  I followed the other reviewers suggestions - less honey, both mustards, half the spices.  It's just okay to less than okay.  It's no big deal.

This chicken was so delicious!!!! it's really simple and kind of quick to make. I made mine with homemade mashed potatoes and string beans. I made sure that i made extra sauce as a gravy for the mashed potatoes. THIS IS DELICIOUS!!!!!

This is not a recipe I enjoyed. My husband said it was strange, but not bad strange. My son liked it and said he thought it would be a nice company dish. There you have it, very mixed reviews. However, I won't be making this one again. By the way, it is 5 points for Weight Watchers.

This was an excellent dish(the first recipe I used from this website).  My husband loved it and my four year old son.  I will definitely use it again in the future.  I couldn't get enough of the sauce.  I rarely cook sweet dishes.  However, it was just the right touch of sweet, not overpowering.

I actually made this recipe for not only my children but my entire family.  I really didn't care for the taste.  It was too tangy.  Very "mustardy".  I probably won't make this again.

I made this recipe because I love Honey Mustard but it seemed to lose its flavor while baking in the oven. My only suggestion is to thickin up the Honey mustard sauce and keep basting while in oven. Other than that it was good.

FANTABULOUS!!! (hehe)
It's so easy, there's no way to screw it up!
The only spice I had on hand was Paprika, and it was still fabulous.  Very tender and juicy.
My fiance raved about it!  I think I could honestly eat this everyday.
BTW, this was the first time I'd ever made chicken of any sort..I'm absolutely thrilled with the results.
Thanks so much!!

This has become a quick and easy standard in our house.  We definitely use dijon and I just use salt & pepper.  Very kid friendly, a good basic dinner recipe to have on hand.

I'm not a huge fan of chicken and anything that masks the flavor is usually ok with me. My husband, however does like chicken and he didn't care for it. He said it was a little too sweet. I could probably play with it alittle to find the right combination but instead I'll probably just keep looking for the "perfect" chicken recipe.

You have to like mustard, since my husband found it a little too "pungent." I'll try it with dijon mustard, instead of brown deli mustard, next time.

We made the sauce and instead of baking the chicken, grilled it outside. What a delicious sauce to baste the grilled chicken with. Our family highly recommends this recipe! One thing my hubby added was a tad bit of jalapeno juice (from pickled jalapeno's) to spice it up a little. I didn't really notice it.

Boy, I never really was a big fan of honey mustard, but after trying this recipe, I loved it.  It's not too simple, yet not too complex, and it is delicious.  The sweetness and the chicken combined make it a great meal for Lunch or for dinner.

This was a simple and delicious recipe.  I thought the paprika overpowered the rest too much and would probably half the amount the next time I make it.  But there WILL be a next time.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Great recipe! Thanks so much for sharing it. My partner loved it.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs, though. We prefer dark meat. The sauce was so tasty! A real winner, thanks again!

Now I know why so many people have tried this chicken. It is really good!  Instead of dried mustard, I used Grey Poupon.

This was delicious and it went over extremely well with my family. I used Dijon mustard instead with extra honey which gave it a nice different taste. Not too sweet and not too tangy.

This recipe is fantastic. I don't usually like honey mustard dishes. This one is great. I used Grey Poupon dijon mustard. It added a great flavor.

I liked this recipe you need to make a little more sauce so that the chicken is not so dry.
I will cook it again.

I made this exactly according to the recipe and it was wonderful - everyone loved it.  It was so tasty and tender.  I did serve rice with it but a little of the sauce goes a long, long way over the rice - apply sparingly.

The mustard make a big difference in this dish.  Use something with character and flavor.  My first try was with a basic French styled prepared mustard and a honey mustard.  Not a big success, try number two 2/3 Watkins prepared mustard with roasted garlic, the rest was the french stuff above.  This was fantastic!

I made this for myself and my boyfriend.  I thought it was pretty good, but not nearly as exceptional as the ratings made it out to be.  We may make it again, but go a little lighter on the basil...that was a bit too much.

Yum! This was really good. Although it took about 1 hour to prepare and cook, it was easy to make and definitely worth it. The sauce had more flavor and body than the fast food restaurant sauces, and it's so much healthier! Overall, a delicious dinner.

Great!  We eat a lot of honey mustard dishes and this had a wonderful new flavor twist for us. Must be the spices. I used Grey Poupon and 4 breasts which made the perfect amount of sauce for me. The chicken was very moist too.  I like a thicker sauce, so I poured all the juice from the baking dish into a saucepan and added a little Wondra flour to thicken and poured it over the breasts to serve.  Wonderful!  This will be part of my regular recipes from now on.

Excellent.  Used dijon mustard and exact measurments called for four servings.  Ate half and refrigerated half in the baking dish with leftover sauce.  Reheated next night, adding several tablespoons water to baking dish, turning chicken and stirring sauce.  Served with brown rice and second night was even better than the first.

This recipe was ok, but not the greatest.  
I also used Dijon mustard, but for us the mustard taste was a little 
overpowering.  My kids did not care for it, but my husband liked it.  
I tasted the sauce before pouring it over the chicken and it was good,
 but I think it became much stronger during the cooking process.
Maybe the taste would be better using 1/2 dijon mustard 1/2 regular mustard.  Also maybe a little water or chicken broth could be added to lighten the taste.
If I make this again, I will reduce the amount of sauce.

It was good, but not as 'tangy' as I thought it would be. So, I made it again the next week and made a 'slight' change to the recipe...I substituted 'Sweet & Spicy Garlic Mustard' instead of mixing the mustard & honey...OH MY was the chicken deeeelicious!...eazy-peazy just opening a bottle of the spicy garlic mustard and brushing it on the chicken! Thanks for the idea, but try it with this jar of spicy garlic mustard!

Chicken turned out moist and yummy. We paired it with smashed potatoes and asparagus. Great alternative for our everyday grilled chicken.

My preference would be to use less mustard than what's called for. I'd also increase (maybe double) the dried seasonings.

Found this recipe last minute, craving some honey mustard chicken and it did not disappoint! I'll definitely be making this again in the near future. I did however tweak the recipe a little, I opted for dijon mustard instead of the yellow, went with half the amount of paprika, (I was going for sweet without that overpowering kick), and also poured in a little extra honey. The chicken was delicious, it came out so juicy and tender! I'd say this is a must try for a quick easy dish.

Delicious, quick and easy to make!

I didn't have honey on hand, so I used pure maple syrup. I also used dijon mustard instead of regular mustard. As others suggested, I marinated the chicken in half of the marinade for about 8 hours. I cooked the chicken for 30 minutes, flipped the breasts and brushed them with the leftover marinade, and cooked for another 10 minutes per instructions. This made for  flavorful, juicy chicken breasts without a lot of fat and calories.

I'm not a big fan of baked chicken dishes that end up in an inch of fluid.  30 minutes in I pulled it and sucked out all the water and that helped.  I finished it under the broiler for a few minutes to give it some color.   I also found it a little bland.   On a side note I would do this on the grill.  The honey mustard sauce would make a good sauce to baste with.

This was sooo good! I'll definitely be making it again! I followed the recipe exactly. For the honey, I used raw, unfiltered. For the mustard, I used Emeril's smooth honey mustard. So. yum.

Tasty and easy! You can mix up the sauce and keep it in the fridge until you are ready to use it. You can make as many chicken breasts at one time as you want; the sauce will keep for several weeks.

Sauce was good, but chicken didn't absorb much flavor. Will try marinating longer next time.

I used half Dijon and half yellow mustard, as others had, and this made a great honey mustard. Instead of breasts, I used chicken tenders. I brushed with the HM as directed; cooked for ~7 minutes @ 425F then flipped,  brushed with HM and cooked for another ~7 minutes.
There was plenty of the dressing left. As I had not separated the batch before dipping my raw-chicken-juice brush in it, I put the remaining dressing on the stove over medium low heat and brought to a simmer, adding the pan juices once the chicken cooked. Made for a delicious dipping sauce/dressing!

Needs some changes. Too sweet and it had a flowery taste and smell. Maybe it was the basil. I read some said it was to much paprika. It was one of them. It has potential. I will try it again with some tweaks. It was very tender

I thought it was delicious but I would marinate it next time so that the flavor gets throughout the chicken instead of just the outside. I made some extra of the sauce to use for dipping the chicken. My fiance didn't care for it to much since he does not like mustard with chicken. Overall, was a great dish but the paprika was a little strong so I would recommend using about half the amount it calls for.

I made this for dinner guests and served it with some rice to soak up the wonderful juices!  Everyone raved about it!  I did add some minced garlic to the honey mustard mixture, but that  is the only change I made to the recipe.  I also highly recommend that you 'crowd' the chicken in your baking dish so it can really absorb the flavors of the sauce.  Will definitely make again.  Thank you AllRecipes for making cooking every night an adventure.

This recipe is great as a base recipe, but definitely needs some loving attention to perfect. Here are the changes I made:

I doubled both the honey and mustard, ditched the paprika for a teaspoon of red pepper flakes, kept the parsley, but added a teaspoon of garlic powder as well, then heated the sauce in a saucepan on low for better blending. I lined my pan with foil, laid down the chicken breasts and sprinkled them generously with sea salt and black pepper before pouring the sauce over the chicken, and sealing with more foil. Bake at 350 for 45 minutes, basting every 15 minutes and turning halfway through. Delish!

Used Dijon mustard (thanks everyone), doubled the sauce and used our own dark honey. It was delicious. Kiddos loved it as well. Will make it again.

We thought this was so good. I used tenders, baked it and then broiled it at the end to caramelize it some. My 4 year old who rarely eats dinner ate it up and loved it!!

So moist.  I used large boneless chicken breast halves.  So delicious and moist.  Was quite surprised that the chicken was done considering the breasts were quite large.  Perfect timing.  I didn't use as much paprika, Added 1/2 dijon and 1/2 yellow mustard.  I didn't have any parsley so I used cliantro. Line pan with parchment. Easier cleanup.

It was easy and the chicken was juicy, but I was disappointed with the overall flavor. Not sure which spice overpowered the honey mustard, paprika maybe? It's a great start, glad I tried it though.

I used Dijon mustard, cut large chicken breasts in half; I think the paprika gave it a little kick. I thought the sweet and spicy balanced perfectly. Will make again.

I liked this recipe - it was definietly simple enough and pretty good. Next time I'll marinate the chicken for longer (a few hours or overnight) but it was pretty good without having it soak. I did substitute regular mustard for Djion mustard.

I haven't made honey mustard chicken before, so I browsed the recipes and liked this one due mostly to it's simplicity.  I was only making for two of us, so used 2 breasts which I cut in half to make uniform-sized pieces.  I only reduced the sauce a little bit.  I did follow suggestions from other reviewers and added garlic, chili powder, 2 fat tablespoons of soy sauce, a mix of regular and brown mustard,  and then marinated the chicken for about an hour.  I followed the baking instructions - covered the casserole dish with foil and baked 30 min.  While that was going on, I cooked a sweet onion in butter until very soft, and deglazed the pan with about 1/4 cup chicken broth.  When it was time to take out the baked chicken and turn it, I gently spread the cooked onions over the breasts, drizzled the onion broth/butter into the casserole pan, then spooned the reserved sauce over all this.  Baked, uncovered, for another 15 min.  Served with brown rice and salad.  I wanted a thinner sauce to pour over the rice, and this method was perfect for that.  Turned out so very yummy, I know I will be making it again soon.  Thanks for teaching me how to make honey mustard chicken!

Really good. The only change i made was that i used half regular mustard and half dijon. I think the half and half mixture of mustard made a big difference. Would be amazing if marinated overnight but even if not, it was still very, very, good. Definitely fits the bill for a simple, tasty, and easy chicken dish. I served with boiled cauliflower and brown rice. Have made it a 2nd time and just as good.

THIS WAS A GOOD RECIPE. I HAVE TRIED IT WITH REGULAR AND DIJON MUSTARD AND I LIKE IT THE MOST WITH THE CLASSIC MUSTARD. THE ONLY THING I WOULD CHANGE IS THE PAPRIKA. THE CHICKEN TASTED GOOD BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING JUST A LITTLE OFF AND I REALIZED THAT I WASNT LIKING THE PAPRIKA. THE SECCOND TIME I ONLY PUT HALF BUT NEXT TIME I WILL EXCLUDE IT COMPLETELY

Great recipe. Instead of regular mustard though, I would recommend Dijon mustard. Otherwise though, amazing. My family loved it, and I plan on making it again soon.

I did this recipe with chicken tenders and it came out perfect.  I didn't use the seasonings called for in the recipe.  I used one teaspoon of Italian seasoning.  And for the mustard, I used half Dijon and half regular.  You don't have to turn the tenders.  Bake for 30 minutes.  Perfect!  Yum yum yum!

I have made this chicken a bajillion times now, and I still love it.  One of my faves...anyone else I've made it for loves it too.   Only substitution I make is to use coarse dijon mustard, which gives it a little more kick.

This was so delicious and so easy to make! I love finding recipes where I would normally have all the items on hand. The only thing I changed was using Dijon mustard instead of regular mustard. In fact, I'm making it again this weekend for my boyfriend. Such a great recipe!

Absolutely love this!  I used chicken tenders instead of chicken breasts.  My intention was to make chicken tenders but realized that I did not have any Parmesan cheese so I looked for a recipe that called for chicken tenders and found this.  My kids love it too!

I really enjoyed this recipe; however, I am giving it 4 instead of 5 stars because I increased the amount of honey by about half. Without the increase in honey, I felt the recipe was overpowered, and not sweet enough, from the amount of spice/herbs added.

My whole family loved this, even my very picky 4 year old. Made with regular mustard and raw honey. I marinated it for about 7 hours.  Was delicious. Chicken cooked perfectly. So very tender. Definite keeper.

This recipe was easy to follow and I was happy to see I had all the ingredients alreasy at home, nothing too extreme in the list. The breasts came out moist and cooked thoroughly. My only complaint was that most of the sauce spread on top had melted to the bottom of the dish and left little on the chicken itself. Easy fix with the use of a spoon! Just drizzled it back on top.

This recipe is amazing! My family loves it. I used a bit less paprika. Also a suggesting for cooking it: instead of baking the chicken, I baked it in a pan with a little olive oil on medium heat. It takes a bit longer to cook on low-medium heat, but it will prevent the sauce from burning so quickly because of the honey. Absolutely delicious!

We liked it. Used covered 2 quart casserole dish lined with foil.  This way the sauce completely covered chicken that I sliced.  Made 3 cups of sauce. Used a bottle and a half of Dijon, half a bottle o.f frences honey mustard and 3 big scoops of honey.  Expensive!  Next time I want to try regular honey mustard from Frenches and maybe a bit of Dijon or a bottle of honey mustard dressing and doctor with Dijon. The chicken was slightly tough, sliced and cooked for 30 mins. Next time try 20  to 25 in the oven or simply simmer together on stove.

This was amazing! Loved how yummy the honey mustard sauce turned out. Instead of regular mustard I used the Sierra Nevada Stout & Ground mustard and instead of basil I used Italian seasoning. The kids ended up wanting the remaining sauce on their potatoes and broccoli. Dish was a hit! Definitely something I will be making again!

I made this tonight and followed the recipe to a "T".  It's ok, not a 4 or 5 star by any stretch of the imagination.  I used dijon mustard and clover honey and all the recommended herbs.  The results were bland but the chicken was moist.

I don't usually write reviews, but wanted to add that this is a quick, easy and tasty recipe for chicken breast. I added a table spoon of basil instead of the teaspoon and the sweetness of the honey makes the basil flavor pop! So if you like the flavor of basil, add a tablespoon.

Made this recipe exactly as stated and it came out perfectly. The six chicken breasts I bought from the butcher totaled to six pounds so each breast was approx 1lb each which is rather large. So- it look just a little longer to cook but was very juicy and delicious! Made with baked potato and steamed mixed veggies. Will make again.

The Paprika seems to have overpowered the other flavors. If I make it again I will probably use less Paprika. The mustard taste/smell was also a little overwhelming for me but that is a personal preference from someone who doesn't especially like mustard. My husband deemed the dish "interesting" and as "something you check out and think 'I get it' but then don't make it again."

I don't understand why it has so many stars.
The sauce wasn't thick but really watery and it wasn't good at all. No one liked it and we LOVE honey mustard. Better off buying honey mustard already made.

I should have tasted the sauce before pouring it over the chicken... As it was cooking it smelled weird... and tasted that way as well. :( Wish I had read some of the negative reviews warning of a weird taste before hand (it's from the basil and maybe parsley as well).

I made this thinking it would be like a honey glazed kind of thing, but it didn't turn out like I expected. I wasn't very fond of the flavor. I might try it again and tweak the recipe a bit. Thanks for the idea :)

Honestly, I was surprised that I liked this as much as I did.  I have never been a BIG fan of honey/mustard combinations, but I tried this because dh and I are dieting, and we needed something different to keep us motivated.  I used dijon mustard because it was all I had on hand. Everyone in the house raved about how good this was.  I liked the way the sauce looked when I mixed it up.  I only used half of the sauce.  (Saving the other half for another night.)  I did allow the chicken to sit with the sauce on it for about an hour in the fridge before I baked it.  It was tender, flavorful, and something I'm sure I'll make again.  Also, my newlywed son is always asking for good, easy recipes.  I'll pass this along to him and his new bride.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

I ate it and did not throw it away... But i probably won't make it often if ever. 

I used Dijon mustard. I also poked the chicken and marinated overnight. I cooked only 1 chicken breast at a time (cooking for one) and placed it in a "tinfoil boat" to keep the sauce close to the chicken (also easy cleanup) and put that in a baking dish. So, I feel like I've made all the adjustments reviewers have suggested. The taste just didn't suit my palate I guess. It was ok, but after the first one I was dreading the other 3 in the fridge.

I did shred some of the chicken and I liked that a bit better. It could soak up more of the sauce I suppose and I guess I like that texture better than keeping it whole.

Wonderful for a change of pace, a bit too sweet for my husband but not for me as I tend to like the sweet side. Next time I will use less honey. I did use Dijon mustard as recommended by others. I also grilled this chicken rather than bake it. Super moist!

Just made this for dinner and it was so good!  I did not have paprika, but it was still yummy and smelled wonderful while cooking!  I did let it marinate for 30 minutes before cooking based on someone else's recommendation.

This recipe is delicious....I suggest that marinading for 3 hours enhances the flavors on the chicken.  This is an excellent, easy recipe!  I also recommend using a smaller pan...keep the chicken close together for a moist flavor....Bern

With the tweaks others have recorded, very yummy.  I also marinated the chicken in the sauce.  I added 2 cloves of crushed garlic to the sauce.  I sprinkled in the amount of paprika that "looked right", rather than a full teaspoon.  Used Dijon mustard.  Smelled amazing while cooking - could barely wait for it to be done!  Served with a brown rice/cashew pilaf, and fresh spinach sauteed in garlic.  A wonderful, tasty, 'homey' tasting meal.  Will increase the amount of sauce when I make it again!

This recipe is great! Super easy to make and it tasted wonderful. Like the other reviews said, I used Dijon Mustard instead of regular mustard. I was a little worried at first because I tasted the sauce before I baked it and was not pleased. However once it baked, it was great! Will make again!

My husband liked this, but I did not.  I followed the recipe, except I substituted the dijon for regular mustard like other reviews said.  I personally think the basil clashed with the honey mustard flavor.

awesome! I used half the mustard and a smaller pan, this turned out amazing! I paired it with rice and fresh green beans and it is just excellent and easy! Great fast and easy dinner idea!

I am not sure what I did wrong, but this was horrible.  thin when it came out of the oven.  Chicken had a little, more like a hint, of flavor on the outside, but inside it was totally bland.  It also had a weird aftertaste which I don't understand.  I also substituted the dijon mustard as many others suggested. I also followed suggestion of pricking chicken with fork to take in more flavor during marinating.  

Most every recipe I make on here with 4-5 star ratings turns out great, not sure what the issue was this time.

The chicken was very moist and flavorful. I am rating low because honey is an expensive ingredient to use on a meal my family didn't enjoy. Though I do like it for an easy meal to put together if time is tight.

Very good recipe! I followed exactly with measurements, but I used spicy mustard instead, since that's all I had. My entire family, including a 1 year old & very picky 4 year old, cleaned their plates! I'm impressed. The thing I'd do different next time is cook the chicken covered with foil & about 25 minutes then flip & cook 10 minutes longer. But it's super easy & delicious, I served with a salad on the side.

This is a new favorite.  Used dijon mustard and covered a the baking dish with foil.  Chicken turned out moist and flavorful.  I actually cut the ingredients in half and used 3 chicken breasts in a small 9x9 pan and it turned out great.

This was a great recipe.  I made it exactly like it is written and I don't think I would change a thing.  I had some left-over honey mustard mixture and we topped the chicken with it on our plates.  Thanks for sharing.  I will definitely make again.

This was delicious! One of the few times I've attempted cooking and I had people tell me seriously that it was the best chicken they had ever had.  One change I made was to use Dijon mustard (as many others suggested).  Honestly, the honey mustard that you make for this can be used for other things, too.  I'm about to have it on a salad.

This was super good. We let it marinate over night. We searched it with white rice and a spinach salad.

This is a quick and tasty chicken recipe. I like to add curry powder to the mix. I add about 2 teaspoons to give it a little zing.

Didn't have great flavor. Got a double thumbs down from the kids. They tried it, but didn't like it at all. Chicken was moist and juicy, the flavor just wasn't great. Not going to add to our repertoire.

This was just OK for me, seasoning was way too strong and I may use less mustard next time to give it more of a sweet honey flavor oppose to the zesty mustard taste. It has potential, it just needs to be tweaked to your preference.

I have tried this several ways and it's always good!  I did reduce the paprika the first time but otherwise stuck with the recipe and it was good.  I now generally use dijon instead of yellow mustard, it's more mild which my family prefers.  I've used breasts, tenderloins, boneless thighs, in the oven or in the crock pot - all very tasty and great on sandwiches and salads as leftovers too.

I liked this the first time, except for a weird taste to it (I see other reviewers noticed it too.)  I made a couple of changes to the recipe and I no longer get the weird taste.  I eliminated the paprika and parsley from the recipe and added in 1 tsp rosemary and 1/4 tsp garlic.  I also used Dijon mustard, and I let the chicken sit in the mustard mixture overnight.  The recipe turned out tasting a little less sweet, a little more savory, and again, lacked that weird aftertaste.

I didn't measure out any of the ingredients so my rating isn't for that.  I also used dijon mustard instead of prepared.  My 5 star is because I never would have thought to put paprika, parsley and basil in my honey mustard and I'm so glad I did.  This is now my go-to honey mustard sauce.

Easy and scrumptious. I used Dijon mustard, about half the paprika as recommended, and baked in a small baking dish for 40-45 min uncovered.  The sauce was very good drizzled over the brown rice served with the chicken.   This is a definite keeper.

I do not understand how people thought this recipe was bland.  I always fall victim to tasteless, tough chicken when I try baked chicken recipes.  This was moist and very flavorful.  The only thing I altered was adding some onion powder to the mix.  Just simply delicous.

I love this chicken and so does my eleven year old son!!  I make it regularly.  However, I use chicken breast tenders, which don't take as long to cook--about 12-13 minutes per side.  Very yummy!!

I wouldn't make it again. Chicken was nice and moist but flavors all wrong (and I love honey mustard). The sauce tasted great before baking (I used dijon mustard and half the paprika) but took on a strange flavor in the end. I'm thinking the sauce would taste great just heated and poured over the already cooked chicken. Maybe I'll give that a try before I completely abandon this recipe.

although the chicken looked very tempting after it cooked, the taste was very strong probably from the basil or the fresh parsley i used. It was very easy to make but doubt I will try this again.

This recipe was kind of ehh. I did less than 15 minutes on the second side and the chicken was a little chewy. Every recipe I've grabbed from Allrecipes has been a hit with my boyfriend and I and neither of us really cared for this one. I used dijon mustard instead of regular and I thought the sauce was far too sweet.

I usually make grilled honey mustard chicken, which calls for mayo, and far less mustard and honey. Followed directions, but it just was not that good. We ate it but I will not make it again.

I used honey, mustard and paprika just the way the recipe calls for and it came out delicious!  I didn’t have the other seasonings called for so I substituted a few dashes of crushed thyme (I did season the chicken with kosher salt and pepper).  Even my husband, who doesn’t typically like sweeter dishes like this one, thoroughly enjoyed it.

delicious and very quick and easy.  i made it with (skin-on) drumsticks that'd been frozen that i defrosted that am

i used 1/2 c regular honey with 1/4c french's (yellow) and 1/4c grainy dijon mustard.  following other suggestions, used just a dash of parika - smoked paprika as that's what i had on hand.  tented with foil to bake for first 30 mins, removed foil when i turned the drumsticks over, then removed foil cover to bake for final 15 mins.  

also, marinated the drummies in the honey/mustard in a ziploc bag (refrigerated) for about 2 hours before baking.  it's an easy dish,  the house smalls great when it bakes up

served with rice and fresh salad, yummy, simple, and healthy

MAJOR hit in my home, the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I advise anyone attempting this recipe to taste test your sauce and tweak it to your specific tastes (and I doubled the amount of sauce, I love sauces). Also I seasoned and lightly floured my chicken breasts, shallow fried each side just to crust the outsides, then I finished them in the oven. Just watch and make sure they don't over cook and become dry.

Absolutely delicious. I use fillets and just dump all the sauce in with them (make sure you get it under them) in a smaller dish, It almost completely covers them so I can just set the timer and let them cook. I use a little less mustard and try to use stone ground dijon. I've tried it with less paprika but I really don't notice a difference. Either way, this is a family favorite. Absolutely one of the best recipes I've found here.

My daughter & 2 kids came to visit, my 11 year old granddaughter requested we have this for dinner so they took over my kitchen & whipped this up! I only had a small package of chicken breasts so they used half thighs, both were very very good. I do think they doubled the sauce & there was plenty. We all loved this & wouldn't change anything with the exception of trying different mustards just to change it up a bit. Someone mentioned adding small new red potatoes to the pan & that sounds like a great idea too. A new recipe for my rotation!

I wanted to work with thinner pieces of chicken, so before cutting each chicken breast in half, I sliced it lengthwise.  I reduced the baking time by about 5-10 minutes, to prevent the pieces from drying out.  The recipe turned out beautifully!  I used spicy brown mustard instead of "hot dog" mustard, and the flavor blended nicely with the honey and seasoning.  I served the chicken with mashed red potatoes, and my company loved it!  I sliced up the leftover chicken breasts to serve over salad the following day.  Delicious!

This tastes a lot like Chili's Honey Chipotle Chicken Crispers, but as a baked dish.  Very nice!  I cut back on the paprika but did everything else as written, and it was perfect.

Great recipe, but I don't recommend making just one chicken breast as I did the first time.  If the baking dish is too big the sauce will burn when it runs off the chicken.  Best to make as many as will fill your dish.  If you can't eat it all, it's great in a chicken salad with honey dijon salad dressing the next day!

This is very good for a simple chicken recipe.  I used Dijon mustard.  Prep time more like 5 to 10 minutes.  Husband liked it so well that he asked for it the next week.  Don't expect complex flavors;  nontheless quite tasty.

Wow this recipe is amazing. It was so easy and the ingredients were standard things that I did not have to go out and buy! I followed the review that advised putting half of the suggested paprika in and the review that advised covering for the first 30 minutes and then uncovering after the second half of the sauce is poured on.
Next time I try this recipe I will cut the chicken breasts into strips.

This was so easy to make and so good! I made it for my boyfriend who hates mustard, the smell, the taste, everything.  I didn't tell him what was in it, just made him try it and then when I told him, he got this stunned look on his face, but he said it was one of the best things I had ever made.

Finally my husband said this chicken is delicious. He hates chicken so I have to just cook and when he asks what's for dinner I tell him he will know when it's done. The only thing I did different was I soaked my chicken in Coke for about 3 hours before making it. Awesome.

Easy and yummy!  I used regular mustard because hubby doesn't like Dijon, but I bet that would have been very tasty also. I marinated in fridge as chicken thawed- poured sauce and chicken in a dish to bake- wound up grilling to finish cooking because chicken had that unspeaking look initially and it gave it a vey finished look also.

This is so easy but so good! Did cover with foil & then took it off for the last 10 minutes and it was so most and good. Hubby doesn't like mustard - He is on his 2nd breast!

Great sauce! Upon tasting it I quickly realized this is the sauce they serve in McDonald's with McNuggets! I agree fresh herbs make a difference, also covering the baking tray with foil during the baking of the first side helps the chicken retain its juices. I personally sprinkle gratinated mozzarella cheese on top when the dish is almost done and it turns out delicious!

This was so easy to make and the kids loved it!  I didn't have honey on hand so I made it with Agave Nectar and it turned out wonderfully!  I will definitely make this one again!

This was the best honey chicken I have ever had. My husband is not a fan of honey mustard and did not think he would like it. We also made it for our neighbors kids. One said she would not like it because of the honey and mustard... Once it was done she ate the whole thing and said it was fantastic!  I highly recommend this recipe!!!

I sniffed through the comments before making this recipe and made some adjustments but in the end the sauce was still way too sweet. I used dijon mustard instead of regular mustard and used a half teaspoon of paprika (a comment said the paprika was too strong) and used a little less than half a cup of honey. I suppose next time I'll use maybe a fourth a cup of honey but overall, I'll make this recipe again (with adjustments of course)

Tweaked it a little bit, used orange marmalade instead of honey. It was perfect. It was delicious on everything. Sweet and tangy. And very easy to make quickly.

I followed the instructions exactly because I always like to try it the original way first.  I was disappointed with how this dish turned out.  It looked good going into the oven, but once I pulled it out I was immediately turned off.  The chicken looked terrible and the sauce had separated .  Next time I will try the other suggestions.

Just made this tonight with brown rice. It was very delicious. Instead of salt and pepper I used adobo seasoning. Either way you can't go wrong.

Truly easy to make and a definitely a dish to make when you don't feel like doing a lot of cooking. Just mix the sauce, splash it on the chicken, stuff them in the oven and walk away... 
I halved the sauce for 6 pieces of boneless chicken thighs and there is plenty of sauce left in the tray for pouring over the chicken. Would definitely make it again! Thanks for the recipe!

If you really like honey mustard you will probably like this chicken.  I thought it was okay but I won't make it again.  It didn't have enough flavor for me.

I have already made this recipe twice. My husband loves mustard so he really appreciated this recipe. I am not a fan of mustard but I enjoyed it. I skipped the salt and used grey poupon mustard. I use bagged chicken breasts from Sam's Club, so total baking time was 22 minutes...the chicken was so moist!

I made this exactly the way the recipe said to (baking 30 minutes, then flipping and baking an additional 10 minutes), and it was amazing. Probably the most tender, juicy, delicious chicken I've had in ages!

Tastes nice.  Not fabulous, but easy and nice.  I cut the chicken into strips and baked them that way.  I used a 1/2 c each of mustard and honey, 1 tsp basil, and 1/2 tsp of of paprika and parsley.  Good over rice and easy in a pinch.

Th sauce was AMAZING!  I absolutely loved it.  Next time I will use it as a marinade overnight and then grill the chicken.  My chicken was a little dry even with the foil tent. But i will certainly make this again.

Cut this in half and only after I mixed the other ingredients realised I had no paprika made it anyway and was still very tasty will try again with the paprika to see the difference in taste.

I mixed up the sauce and used it as a marinade for ICF chicken breasts.  Baked at 350 for 45 minutes (covered with foil for 30 minutes)

Loved loved loved it, the only thing I would do different is use thin breasts or just adjust cooking time (mine turned out dry due to the thickness of the breasts). I had to cook far too long

Delish!  I used half prepared mustard, half Dijon mustard, reduced the paprika by at least half, and doubled the basil since I had no parsley.  Very good!

This was great! I took other reviewers' suggestions and toned down the paprika, but otherwise followed it pretty closely. I sliced 2 my chicken breasts pretty thin and got 3 pieces out of each. Will definitely make again!

I thought this was delicious, but the bf just thought it was 'good.' I cut down the paprika, as suggested by others and used Italian seasoning instead of basil.  I would absolutely make this again!

Wow! This was excellent! My family really enjoyed the flavor of the moist chicken. I pierced the chicken with a fork before pouring the honey mustard over it. I added all the honey mustard mixture to the chicken at once over  before baking it.  Then I covered the chicken with foil. The chicken was moist, tender and flavorful.

great if your looking for somthing different for a mid week meal! I covered with foil and things came out nice and moist. Not somthing that i would eat on a regular basis, but it did the trick to get me out of my borning chicken blues. Next time i would marinate over night and then grill.. yummy!

The recipe called for a lot of mustard- I halved it and it was still really mustardy.  I thought the chicken was dry.  Wouldn't make again.

I also used spicy brown mustard.  The picture inspired me to serve this with a salad of baby spinach, feta cheese, dried cranberries, and diced tomatoes, and cucumbers.

We loved this recipe.  I did take someones suggestion by using dijon mustard and only 1/2 tsp paprika.  My family asks me to make this all the time.  I do make this every other week.  And a plus is that its healthy.  Who doesn't love that!

I'm not a huge fan of honey, but this dish wasn't too bad.  Next time I think I will opt to add more mustard than honey.  The dish was easy to make and tasty.  I'll definitely make it again!

I Loved this recipe - my son however did not. I rate only 4 stars because I think it is great for grown ups but not a kid pleaser (at least not my kid). But just thought he might have liked them in strips with some of the sauce for dipping...

This was so easy to make.  It's definitely going to become a regular meal for me.  The only change I'd make would be using dijon mustard next time (I used regularly yellow), or chipotle, and less honey.  Thanks for this recipe!

The sauce has the perfect sweetness without overwelming the chicken. It really makes the chicken delicious. I served this with sauteed mushrooms and sugar snap peas. Makes a great, healthy dinner.

Other than being quite easy to prepare and shop for there are no other positives with this recipe.  I didn't change any ingredient, but followed it to a "T"...it was terrible.  Probably the worst "new recipe" I have ever tried.  The mustard honey combo was not appetizing, and even though I layed it on a bed of rice to help make it look more appealing, it just didn't work.  I am a very forgiving critic when it comes to food.  I like almost anything and LOVE the presentation of dinner as well, but this meal will never be repeated.  It didn't look appetizing and oddly enough was not tasty either...sorry.

I cut the recipe down for 2 breasts. It came out juicy and moist and oh so good! My boyfriend loved it! I usually just pan-fry chicken breasts but now this is my go to chicken breast recipe! And I'm making it again tonight!!

Pretty good! I scaled the receipe down for 2 breasts and used half Grey Pupon Djion Mustard and half plain yellow mustard. Easy weeknight meal!

I followed another reviewers suggestion and covered with chicken with foil for the first 30 minutes. The chicken turned out tender and moist! However, the flavor is a bit lacking (hence 4 stars instead of 5) and needs improvements. Overall, good and easy.

This was pretty delicious for a quick and easy mid-week meal. I used much less parsley and paprika, as other reviewers suggested, and the flavors of the sauce came out perfect. My family tends to get bored with chicken very easily, but this meal was a hit. Will definitely make it again.

Tried the recipe last night! It was great. I didn't use the teaspoon of paprika and doubled the sauce as suggested in previous reviews. Great if you're trying to doing a low carb diet.

This chicken was really easy. I was a little skeptical at 1st because the sauce smelt a little overpowering but it smelt good once it was cooked and my husband loved it. I'll be making it again.

This was ok.  I pounded my chicken breasts thin and baked them covered so it didn't take quite so long.  Hubby said they were just ok.  A bit too sweet for his taste.

This tasted really good. The only thing I will do differently is use a glass pan next time. My non-stick metal pan is stained yellow even after several washes.

very good and easy. i took the advice of a few people... double marinade, reduce paprika, cover for 30 minutes. i'd even try a variation of this as a chicken salad sandwich... great over rice. if you wanted a better presentation, give it a quick browning in a pan first.

I followed some suggestions on here and only dashed the basil and parsley on. I will definitely used honey mustard next time though. I mixed in the 1/2 teaspoon of paprika in with the honey mustard, but didn't use all of the marinade. The flavor wasn't that strong, so next time I will probably use all of it.

As others I dropped the amount of paprika to 1/4 tsp.  Otherwise did as directed. I'm back and forth on if I should try making this again.  I think the sauce was better than the chicken.  If I use this again I'm going to try it on grilled chicken or maybe fish or even as a salad dressing-pretty versatile actually.  I think I'll try dijon mustards as some others did.

This was very good and very easy!I had to cut off my 3 year old because he was going to eat the chicken I was saving for DH.  Made it twice in one week, great with rice!  As suggested, I only used half of the paparika as suggested by others.  It worked just as good on bone-in chicken thighs.  One suggestion though-after the chicken is cooked through, stick it under the broiler for about 5 minutes or so.  It crisps up the chicken and makes it delicious!

There just wasn't enough of the honey mustard to cover the chicken well, and the coating was very thin.  The flavor didn't pack the punch I was hoping for.  Will not make again.

I made this tonight and it was a huge hit!  My kids said it was the best ever.  I followed the reviewers and cut the paprika in half.  I also covered the pan (used a smaller one) with foil for half of the baking time.  Served it with a side of cinnamon mashed-yams and almond rice.  Def. a keeper!

I used only Dijon mustard, so the flavor was a little too strong.  I will mix yellow mustard in next time I make it to soften the flavor.  Otherwise, it was a quick, easy recipe that my family enjoyed.  I will marinate the chicken as other reviews have suggested.

I thought this recipe was great. I gave it a four star because the amount of spices were a bit to much I would cut down the basil and paparika by half. Overall, yummy.

Very flavorful.  A bit sweet for my families taste so I cut down on the honey a bit.  Also following other reviews I cut the paprika a bit.  Will use this recipe as a marinade for the grill in the future.

VERY YUMMIE!  Based on some people's suggestions that the paprika was too much I seasoned each chicken breast with a little salt, paprika, and garlic powder.  I only mixed the mustard and Honey together (with a little bit of Hot sauce because we like things spicy) and cooked the chicken as the recipe states.  It came out moist and delicious.

This was okay. I must have done something wrong because it was not very flavorful. Will try again with some adjustments, maybe marinade as others have suggested.

Yum! So good. I did use boneless, skinless thighs since that is what I had on hand and I didn't bother with the salt and pepper. It was still wonderful!!!!

I took the advice of others and did half regular mustard and half dijon i also cut the paprika in half.  This was not a big hit at our household as my husband said 'it's edible but doesn't taste all that great'.  The spices left a funny aftertaste.  I think it should call for a dash of basil and paprika and parsley.  I cooked the chicken in a shallow baking dish and it was very moist.  I don't think I'll be making this again.

Oh goodness!  This was seriously awful.  I used dijon mustard, which I really like on everything else, but this just didn't turn out.  It was so bad that we couldn't even finish it.  The one good point was that the chicken stayed extremely moist while it cooked.

Thought it was pretty good but would definitely marinate it in the mustard next time as it didn't seem to soak into the chicken at all during cooking.

This recipe was absolutely delicious. My 3 year old made sure she left no meat on the bone! LOL (I used wings). I didn't have any paprika so I used Mrs. Dash since it has lots of herbs, I also used chinese 5 spice seasoning to give it a little kick, I will definitely continue to make this!

This recipe was so easy and delicious.  It was ready in no time.  The only thing I did different was add some water in the baking dish so the chicken would retain the moisture and I covered it with aluminum foil.  Delish!

I was looking forward to making this, but was disappointed. I really didn't like this recipe AT ALL. Perhaps they would be better on the grill.  My husband said it was just ok, but suggested the flavours would be good on pork. I will not make this recipe again.

Sauce was delicious. My chicken turned out slightly dry, but I used chicken tenderloins instead of breasts, because that is what I had. I think I should have cut cooking time a little. Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe.

Yummy & easy! I agree with previous comments to put it in a smaller pan and cover it.  I looked at other recipes that suggested chili powder as well...added a bit more zip to the sweetness of the honey.

An okay basic recipe. Prepard as directed, it turned out very dry. I'll try it again, maybe with a higher temp and shorter cooking time.

it was good, next time I'll try pork chops and see how that turns out. The chicken was moist, i did cover it with foil for the first part of baking time, and it turned out great. thanks for sharing

Awesome recipe! I didnt want to add the mayo as I wanted to keep it low fat but I found the Dijon mustard I used a little to spicy for my kids. Next time I will play with the mustard so I can eliminate the mayo. I also added 1 tsp paprika which gave it a nice color and had my husband grill them instead of bake it. Great flavor, I'll keep this recipes as an easy on hand week night meal.

I loved that I already had all the ingredients at home and that it was easy to make. It came out great, very tasty! Both the hubby and the kids loved it which everyone knows isn't always easy!

I really liked this chicken.  I made it for a salad and kind of wished I was eating it alone!  I used Dijon mustard and covered the chicken for the first 30 min and cooked it uncovered for the remaining 15.  I don't really think that honey is very difficult to work with like some other reviewers, and once you mix it in with everything else the resulting sauce is smooth and not sticky.  Try it!

This is close to my version, but i prefer my recipe (given by a friend years ago).  Equal amounts of butter, margarine and honey and a good squirt of dijion mustard (a heaping tbsp) and rosemary.  Fabulous.  I serve with roasted veggies.  Life is good!

Excellent recipe! I used a smaller baking dish to keep the juices near the chicken but despite cutting the cooking time (my oven is old and weird) it still came out just a little overdone but still great tasting. Next time I will use the aluminum foil until the basting and re-examine the baking time.

Thank you for your recipe.  I've had it printed since 9-25-2001 and it's very good.  I wasn't a member then, so I couldn't give you any amount of stars for it.  It tastes great and everyone I've made it for just loves it.  Thanks for this recipe.
The only things I've changed is more honey and less mustard.  Use a little garlic powder and fix it with rice (on the side).

Oh no, a disaster!  The chicken smelled awful in the first place, then there was too much mustard.  The inside(if you could get over the smell or outside) was quite juicy.  I suggest using less mustard, and more spices.

This was a pretty good recipe.  My kids thought it was ok.  I did take the advice of others and used a small enough pan for the chicken.  I also covered this for the first 30 min. and then uncovered for the last 10-15 min.  It made the chicken moister.

Simple and tasty. I added a few spices and garlic to the honey mustard mixture and some onions, green pepper and mushrooms to the dish and it all came out well. Be sure to cook for at least 45 minutes if your chicken breasts are a bit thick as mine were. The sauce in the baking dish was good, too.

This was so good -- and EASY! My husband took one bite and said, "you've got to make this again".  I changed the sauce slightly by adding a couple tablespoons of peach preserves to it. Then, while the chicken was resting, I reduced the sauce on the stovetop for a few minutes. It was delicious!

I liked the taste of the honey mustard, but for some reason it was gritty feeling in my mouth. I'm not sure if it was from the basil, or maybe my honey was old. Either way, I don't think I'll be making this again, it was good, but it didn't wow me like I was expecting it to.

Thought the flavors of this chicken dish were a little odd. We weren't crazy about this one. I think it would have been much better to leave out the seasonings and just do the honey and mustard.

I will consider this the foundation of the marinade/sauce I used last night.  Initially I stayed to the one to one ration of the honey and dijion mustard and found it to be too sweet.  2:1 was a lot better.  Adding Parsley, Paprika, salt & pepper helped added and enhanced the spice in the dijion.  Basil.. I smelled the basil and considered what was going on in the bowl.  I'm glad I kept the basil out.  Grilled and a slice of sharp cheddar. We will be using this again.

It was a little on the runny side, but not more than any other marinade.  I brushed on extra while it was on the grill.

I thought it was pretty good and very easy!  I didn't have enough regular mustard, so I used dijon.  Followed everything else as written.  At first bite, I thought the flavor in the chicken was a little weak, but then we poured some of the yummy sauce on top - WOW - what a difference!  FANTASTIC!  Served with wild rice and sliced cucumbers.  Oh, and I made it with 4 breasts in an 8x8 glass dish, but didn't alter anything else.

Hmmmmm.....I keep re-reading the ingrediants/directions for this recipe to see if I made it correctly. I did, and it was horribly bland. My husband ended up creating a dipping sauce for his chicken, while I just sucked it up and ate it as is. I do not know how this got so many great reviews.

I was not too impressed with this recipe, but my picky husband loved it - so it deserves 5 stars. Next time I make it, I will use less mustard, NO BASIL, and more honey. I served this with roasted potatoes and steamed brocoli. This recipe is worth a try and I will be making it again with a few changes.

This is a great recipe!  My husband and daughter loved it!  I would probably put it in a smaller pan next time.  I used italian seasoning instead of basil and didn't include the parsley.  I'll definately make it again.

This was easy and tasty - hubby and the kids really liked it. I personally discovered that I prefer honey mustard with curry rather than herbs, but it was a good dish.

Absolutely fantastic dish!  I found this recipe on allrecipes.com three years ago and use it as a regular dish now.  I have even passed it on to friends who make it part of their regular dish as well.  I only changed one thing: I use thighs instead of breast.  I know it's a bit fattier but I personally think breasts are way too dry.  My only regret is not posting the review earlier!

I tried this twice, and both times this was a hit!  The first time I made it as instructed.  The second time I ran out of mustard, so I used 1/4 cup mustard and 1/4 cup steak sauce as a substitute.  Everyone agreed that the steak sauce made a great recipe even better.

My whole family really enjoyed this one.  I thought the sauce was particularly tasty.  I used 3/4 c Dijon mustard and 1/4 cup mayonnaise but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I will make this again though I may serve it with mashed potatoes so I can use the sauce on those as well as the chicken.

I followed these directions but I think I may have cooked it too long. The sauce is great (I may have used less honey than called for though)! I love the basil w/ the honey mustard...interesting combo! The chicken came out kind of tough though...but I think that was my fault. Next time I may pound the chicken breasts, but I would like to try this again. Thanks!

This was very easy to prepare and my family loved it.  My 14 yr old said "5 stars"!  I was out of regular mustard so I mixed honey mustard, dijon mustard,and honey with the herbs/spices.  It turned out good.  Served with brussel sprouts and stuffing. I also made a sandwich for lunch the next day adding watercress.  It was even better the next day!

I wasn't a huge fan of this by itself. I thought it might make good chicken to be used on a sandwich the following day, but not so much as the main entree by itself.

Very good recipe. I added a litle bit more honey than mustard and cut back on the parsley a hair. Will make this again, no doubt.

I've tried a recipe similar to this with chicken wings on the grill with the addition of brown sugar, soy sauce and mayo which is awesome but it didn't have basil and paprika like this dish does, which doesn't work for me.  It gave it a funny aftertaste type flavor.  I think finely diced green onion and crushed dried red pepper would work better as the spices.

3.5 stars - This was weird a taste - almost like a Thai dish? I used chicken breat tenders, half the mustard, and fresh herbs over rice. My BF loved it so next time I will try to either add spices to make it an easy Thai like meal - or delete the herbs all together. It's just a different taste but good!  Thaks!

Easy and interesting chicken recipe! I used thyme instead of parsley and baked the breasts (2 servings) a little less than 1/2 hour. Next time I might cover the pan to increase juiciness.

What a delicious and easy recipe? My husband and I use this as a quick fix entree when we do not want to spend a lot of time preparing a meal after work. I did customize the recipe slightly by putting tinfoil over the baking dish when cooking until the last 15 minutes and then taking it off. Also I create some extra sauce to put on the chicken at the dinner table. It's a great, health y meal.

This recipe turned out really well.  (Especially coming from an inexperience cook who is in the process of learning.)  I used Dijon mustard, and added brown sugar.  I also left out the basil and parsley and I really enjoyed it.  I made some extra sauce to dip my chicken in.  Tangy, sweet, and very tasty! :)

SO GOOD. This one, I just eyeballed all the measurements and it was still divine. I had a lot of leftover sauce so I used it to dunk my chicken in as I ate it. Neanderthalish? Probably... But I'm allowed to when I'm at home :P

Okay, I don't know what I did to this but I will try again. The honey mustard sauce was to thick so I had to put it in the microwave to heat it up a little.  Do you use yellow mustard or Mustard in spice form, maybe thats what I did wrong.  The sauce wouldn't stay on the chicken. I will try it again.

We thought this was good but not great, although one dipped his bites in BBQ sauce and loved it.  At least it was something a little different.  Didn't add brown sugar like some suggested so maybe that was it... Thanks though

Is espescially good if you add some fresh minced garlic to it :) One of my favorites, can also use frozen chicken to add for more sauce for rice, veggies, overall, one of the easiest, fastest chicken recipes i have ever found.

Very easy to make, but it was not very good.  It had a funny taste (maybe too many spices?).  If I made it again, I would probably just put the honey and mustard mix on the chicken and leave out the spices.  Sorry!

This was a very easy recipe but I really didn't like it.  It definitely didn't have any Honey Mustard taste to me.  All I could taste was the herbs.  My husband and kids liked it though and it isn't often that the kids eat a new recipe without complaint!  Maybe I will try it again but cut way down on the herbs.

This recipe was so easy to put together and my family loved it.  I think next time I will decrease the amount of basil used because the flavor was a overpowering for us.  I will definitely make this one again!

very good! chicken was moist and flavorful. cooking times were perfect. i used 5 chicken breasts instead of six and had plenty of sauce, but would probably make more next time for drizzling on rice and vegetables.

This recipe was okay, maybe needed exrta sauce built into the recipe. I even used grey poupon to kick it up a notch. Although it was very edible, it won't be added to my list of favorites

This is a great recipe, but the chicken came out a bit dry... it needs more sauce I think, personal preference to be juicy, even though I doubled the quantity, so I'll be tripling that next time! Leave some sauce to lightly cover after baking before serving! A Keeper

Very tangy and easy to prepare.  The sauce was not as thick as I thought it would be, so I poured what was left over in the bottom of the pan on top of the chicken.

Excellent.. I doubled the sauce as well and everyone in family is begging for me to make it again.  I also tried it with bone-in cut up chicken pieces, making sure I speared the chicken with a fork several times before cooking, the flavor was fantastic! A keeper!

Yummy and easy! The first time I made this I marinated my chicken tenders in the sauce overnight and then baked them without turning them and brushing them. The next time I just mixed the sauce and chicken together and dumped it all in the pan and cooked it the same way. Was great both times!

I'm always creating and looking for new recipes.  This was excellent.  It was very easy to prepare.  Everything that was already in my kitchen.  I did use only 1/2 tsp of the basil, because I feel it is a little too strong for my family. (just enough for the flavor)  However, it is an excellent recipe my family wants to know when we are having it again.  Even my very picky 10 yr old who likes nothing.  I served it with sweet potatoes and green beans.  The next time I make it, I plan to make it with a little extra seasoning mixture and mixing it with white rice and placing the chicken over a bed of rice.  Thanks for sharing.  It is wonderful.

The honey flavour was far too dominant and intense, quite unpleasant.  I like a more subtle flavour with a better blending of the ingredients.

I have to give this 4 stars because my 4 year old ate 1 1/2 breasts!  And my husband loved it too.  It was a last minute meal- everything was on hand.  I served it with buttered egg noodles and sauted green beans.  This is a great change up for people who eat a lot of chicken.

We thought this had a bitter aftertaste to it. I used a premium quality honey from a local bee keeper. Maybe it was too much mustard ??  Prep was easy but will keep looking for a better Honey Mustard recipe.

MMMMM. I used this as a marinade for chicken. I marinaded it for 30 mins and the put it on the grill.  The only complaint was, "YOU DIDN'T MAKE MORE?" It was absolutely delicous and I will definately be using this again and again!

I really liked this recipie, although followed some other suggestions.... scaled back to 3 servings so used 1/2C honey and almost 1/2C mustard, ommited the basil and parsley and instead added dill.  It was yummy!  And the smell was was mouth watering!

This was not as good as I had hoped it would be. We all love chicken with honey mustard sauce but this one just wasn't it. As my daughter said, "I can eat it if I have to but...". I think it was the basil that threw it for me. Maybe if that was subbed out for something else it would work. Anyway, it is always fun to try something new and sometimes you get a great one and sometimes you don't. This would be a "don't" to us.

This was okay.  There wasn't anything bad about it but nothing particularly memorable about it either.

This chicken was missing something. I'm not sure what. I've seen other honey mustard chicken recipes on this site that call for stuff like mayo and Dijon mustard instead of regular mustard. I'm considering trying them instead. The chicken smelled really good while baking but the flavor of the basil was a bit overpowering and left something to be desired.

I found this recipe last week and have already made it twice. It is so incredibly easy! It has the perfect taste! Both times we scaled it down to 4 servings. After reading reviews, I think next time I will make extra sauce to put on rice or potatoes. Also excellent with steamed broccoli. My fiance is not much for cooking different recipes but he was even able to make this. (It actually turned out a little better when he made over when I made it--and I'm the cook in the family!--his sauce was a little thinner from some water left in the pan and it turned out perfect!) The chicken was so tender that we didn't even need knives! He also added fresh mushrooms the second time when he turned the chicken over. We can't wait to have it again. I have already memorized the ingredients and that's my way of knowing that it's a keeper!! Thank you so much for this recipe. It is definately one that we will be making over and over again!

Made it exactly as written and it was out of this world. I agree with the other reader. It is great to have all the ingredients right in my cabinet. No need to  marinate it.  Was still as tender as butter. Great company dish too!!!

what an easy and simple chicken... i was in a rush so i didn't marinate the chicken long.  For about only 20 minutes.  The meal was delicious and i would 100% reccomend serving this with a nice vegatable of your choice and a bed of white rice.

Very good! I was a little apprehensive at first. I had tasted the marinade before putting it on the chicken and it was extremely strong. I didnt think I would like it. However, after cooking, the flavor lost the extreme sharpness of the mustard and was delicious.

This was a pretty good recipe but I think it would be better with some changes.  If I use it again, I'll marinate the chicken in the sauce instead of just brushing it on and baking.  I will probably play around with the spices too.

With all of the great ratings and reviews this recipe got I was very surprised at how it turned out.  My hasband and I were both disappointed. It was just ok and VERY MUSTARD-Y.  I scaled the recipe back to four servings and it was a good thing or we would have had way too many leftovers. I did however take the 2 breasts that were left over and cubed them with some of the 'sauce' and some mayo.  We will try that out as a chicken salad sandwich.  I don't know maybe I did soemthing wrong but we didn't care for it too much.

This was very good, but almost too strong on flavor.  Next time I might cut down on the mustard or the spices to mellow it out a little; but then I was using a really good (robust) honey. With a weaker honey, the spices might be right.  I needed a little longer cook time also.

This recipe was a hit in my home.  My family is very picky so it is hard sometimes to find things they like.  I was out of basil but it was still great without it.  This will be a regular in my house now.

This recipe was very tasty.  After I baked the chiken I chopped it up in little pieces and serced over a fresh romaine salad.  The honey mustard sauce provided a great dressing.  This will definetly be made again in my home.

I'm surprised by some of the reviews saying this recipe wasn't sweet enough!  If anything, I would use LESS honey!  I've made this twice now, once with breasts and once with thighs.  My husband loved it and wants me to make it when his dad comes to visit.  It's now a family favorite.  I liked it best with the thighs, as breasts always seem to dry out for me.

I marinated the chicken for about 45 minutes and the outcome was that it was ok.  I would have liked the sauce to be thicker, but it was very thin.  I put the thin sauce in a dipping bowl for added dipping.  It was a pretty average dish for me, but my fiance really liked the taste.  I think there's a better sauce/marinade out there -i'll keep looking :)

Great flavour! I toss put rice in the bottom of the casserole dish, chicken over the top, and extra water for a more complete meal.

I am not a honey mustard fan, but some of my family are so I made this, and WOW! I thought it was great, most of my family loved it. I mixed a combo of prepared mustards, yellow, deli and spicy. It made a lot of sauce, but that was ok. I also used tenders, and a small baking dish. I only gave it 4 stars because my 11 year old thought it was gross, so unless your kid likes honey mustard, they probably won't like this. Easy and yummy!

I will probably won't make again; even though my husband thought it was okay.  It was a simple recipe to put together, but felt it could have used less mustard---and I really didn't see the point of the spices.

We all thought this recipe was "OK".  The honey mustard added a nice taste as a coating for the chicken but was too sweet to be used as a sauce.

I used mostly regular prepared mustard and made up the difference with dijon. The chicken was INCREDIBLE! Nothing short of perfect. It was outstanding as leftovers too! Depending on your taste, you can play with the balance of mustard to honey and it will turn out no matter what!

Make the Baked Honey Mustard chicken today. It was delicious.
 The chicken was so tender, you could cut it with a fork. My husband really enjoyed 
it. If he like it, it must be good. Thank you Mary Bane for the recipe.

This recipe was VERY easy to make and had good flavour, but the sace was a little to watery for my tastes.  Maybe if made with some sour cream or even bleded with cream cheese and then poured over chicken and baked.

I decided to make this chicken in the slow cooker instead of baking it.  It was very simple to put together, and didn't take much time at all.  However, even though I used only half the honey called for, my husband and I both found it WAY too sweet for our tastes.  I will make it again (in the slow cooker), but I will definitely only add honey to taste.

This is about the easiest chicken diah I've made. You certainly get "bang for your buck"! The husband and 3 year old really liked it. I'll make it again when I'm limited for time and want something that I know I can't mess up!

I thought this was recipe was great (I just finished eating it!!). I used grey poupon mustard, and italian seasoning instead of basil and parsley. It has such a wonderful taste and was so very simple to make. I served the sauce over rice along with it. This is definitely a keeper in my recipe box!

We thought this was quite good.  The chicken was very moist! My husband thought it needed more sauce, so on his second helping he poured some of the extra sauce from the pan over his chicken & he said it was even better!  I will keep this one.

This is a fine way to cook boneless/skinless chicken breasts.  The meat was very tender and juicy.  My 30 month-old ate almost half a breast, which is a ton for him. The sauce was great over rice.  I will definitely make it again, but I was wondering if the sauce is supposed to be really runny?  I only used 2 heaping tablespoons of Dijon rather than the 1/2 cup. Perhaps that had something to do with it.  Next time I will do as someone suggested and thicken the juices into a sauce with some cornstarch. Thanks for a great recipe.

Didn't realize we'd tried this back in 2001 & rated it 4 stars, but now we think it is worth 5 stars.  Have no idea why we got rid of this recipe before as we sure will be having this more often now.  This is quick & easy which I always like.  Chicken was moist, but depending on thickness of the breast will determine the cooking time more than what the directions say.

my husband just started a LOW FAT diet.  I needed to prepare healthy food that my children will eat, and would not take up too much time.  This recipe did the trick.  I too used dijon mustard as suggested by some of the other people.  This will become a staple dish in my house.

Delicious recipe. I really enjoyed it and it was easy to make. We love chicken in my household, but the same flavors get boring. This recipe created a change!

Pretty good except I would add half of the paprika next time. It's a bit too strong. Also adding all of the mix makes it too liquidy.

I read the reviews and took everyone's suggestions. I marinated the chicken. I added 1/4 cup of mayonnaise and a splash of lemon juice.
I covered pan with foil and baked at 350 for 30 min.,removed foil,turned chicken and baked for an additional 30 min.
Chicken was very tender and tasted fantastic.
A new family favorite!

This a great recipe. So simple to throw together. I love that I usually have all the ingredients on hand. I make extra sauce,. and serve over rice. This is a hit for quick company supper. This is a keeper.

I doubled the sauce & used 1/2 Dijon & 1/2 yellow mustard. I also cut down the paprika to half. I used three huge breasts & covered with tin foil for the first half of the cooking time.

Cut paprika in half per suggestions and sadly didn't have any parsley. Used half brown mustard, half honey mustard, and it was fine. Chicken was maybe a little dry, but covering it with the sauce after plating fixed that.

I normally hate chicken but WOW! I love this flavor and the thinner cut of chicken. I only did 2 pieces of chicken and cut the sauce in half (for 3 servings cause I love saucy food). I also added Ground Cayenne (1/2 - 1 tsp) cause I love sweet and spicy.

I used Epicure honey mustard and cut the amount of paprika in half based on other reviews. Served with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli, my boyfriend raved about it. It was super easy and very tasty! Next time I will marinate overnight and grill it on the BBQ.

Loved this recipe .  So simple and quick to make with ingredients you always have on hand.  I cut the recipe in half for only two chicken breasts and there was still lots of sauce.  I will definitely make it again as it was a real hit with my husband.

The best baked chicken we've had.  Goes well with a slightly sweet coconut rice.  Made 20 pounds of chicken and 2 gallons of coconut rice and took it to a huge Birthday Party.  It was a Big Hit!  Didn't get to bring any home.  So, going to make it again today for my son's birthday.

Made it for a second time and boy was it better this time around. Marinated it overnight instead of the day of with a little less honey than advised and much more mustard. The big difference was I butterflied the breast instead of leaving it whole with the same cook time and it came out juicy and tender. Definitely making again.

I will make it again. As a vegetarian I did not actually taste it but my husband rated it better than any of my standard chicken recipes. Easy to prep with standard pantry ingredients. Put in the oven and made sides.

Made it once and my boyfriend and I both loved it. Made it a second time, using leg quarters with skins left on. Also came out wonderful.

I will be using the non-chicken honey mustard ingredients to make a separate honey mustard sauce for other things, like French fries and snack foods!

This was very tasty. I didn't have basil so I substituted Italian seasoning and doubled all ingredients except the paprika, which I reduced the amount based on others reviews. I marinated the chicken breasts for approximately 4 hours . Served the dish with brown rice and my family loved it.

One tip. Pan seer the chicken prior to baking. It helps it hold the moisture better. Also, if adding veggies to cook with the chicken, consider doubling the sauce.

I made this following the given directions, but cut it in half as it would take my son and I days to eat 6 chicken breasts.  The recipe was horrible, and that's a compliment!  I used Great Value Clover Honey (in the little bear bottle) and all the honey melted off of the chicken.  There was hardly anything left on the chicken when i took it out of the oven to turn the chicken and coat it again.  All of the honey mustard sauce was in the bottom of the pan turning brown.  I turned the chicken and coated it as instructed and when i took it from the oven about 12 minutes later, there was once again, nothing on the chicken.  all the mustard sauce had melted off again. 
Not sure what i did wrong but i ended up with plain flavorless baked chicken.  I ended up putting that in the food processor and turning it into shredded chicken and added it to a salad to save dinner.
will never try this recipe again, what a waste of time and disappointment that was.  Unless someone can msg me where i screwed up maybe?

I absolutely loved these.  They are addictive, and the only thing I would do differently is to add, maybe, peanut butter extract or a little more peanut butter to give it a stronger peanut butter flavor.

I cooked the chicken with a diced (half-inch) apple and onion to add interest to the sauce and popped it under the broiler after it was done. Good flavor and much more appetizing in appearance, served the sauce over rice. My husband loved it. I think it would be better with chicken thighs. The paprika was not at all overwhelming  (and I used smoke paprika!).

I made this for dinner last night - absolutely delicious! 
Easy  ---  breezy!
My husband liked it too. 
In fact, after one bite, he actually said "Mmmm, that's good", which is unusual for him. 
(He just expects my cooking to be terrific all the time. LOL".)
Changes I made - I used Dijon mustard and 1/2 the paprika as suggested by another

It can be really good, just tone down the paprika to about 1/4 a teaspoon, it was a little bit too much for me and my boyfriend! But definitely give it a shot!

After reading the reviews, I followed a few suggestions:  cut the paprika in half, used Dijon mustard, and used a smaller dish so that the chicken was immersed thoroughly in the sauce. Delish!  The sauce had an amazing flavor, and I drizzled some over a side of rice.  I’ll definitely be making this again.

fast, tasty, and juicy. I made this and it was a hit! I cheated and used bottled honey mustard because its what was on hand.  still turned out well though.  I've got to imagine it tastes much better if you follow the recipe exactly.

I highly recommend this recipe! It was a crowd pleaser at my house and very simple to make! I used regular yellow mustard and loved the flavor, however I did use half the paprika, as I have a family of wimps when it comes to heat!

I won't make this again. I overcooked it, which was my fault--and obviously I could prevent that problem if I were to try again. But it's the sauce that makes me say "no thanks." Nobody in the family liked the smell of the sauce.

Made this tonight for dinner.  For 3 chicken breasts (pounded for evenness) I used 1/2 cup honey and a scant 1/2 cup of Dijon mustard.  I used exact amounts of basil, parsley, and paprika.  I thought the basil overpowered the dish and would decrease or leave it out entirely the next time.  My family enjoyed this dish and are open to trying it again with the changes.  We served it with egg noodles and green beans.  Chicken was very moist and tender; seasoned both sides with salt and pepper and poured all the sauce on top.  Flipped it over halfway through cooking.  I baked it in a glass casserole dish for 35 minutes.

Wasn’t sure I was going to like mustard chicken regardless on how good the recipe was. Yum! It was very good. Used half a darker mustard that said it was spicy and half just regular mustard. Used Costco boneless breast chicken so it took more time to bake.

This was a good recipe. I did not follow it exactly (I halved the paprika and used dijon mustard) but the times and amounts seemed very good to me. Would recommend.

I have one word for this recipe:  FANTASTIC!  Made it with prepared yellow mustard the first time and we're having a ton of fun subbing 1/2 with other mustard varieties including dijon and an amazing Vadalia onion mustard we got at the Olive Pit in Nor Cal. Also works great on the grill for those summer nights that it's too hot to turn on the oven. Just watch your cook time.  Definitely a new staple for us.  Thank you for an amazing recipe!

My family of 5 raved about this chicken, and it’s a very rare occasion that we all love something! The honey mustard sauce was perfect with just the right amount of spice, and the honey to mustard ratio was spot on. I was afraid with the long cooking time that the chicken would be dry so I baked at 350 for only 30 minutes, but basted the chicken every ten minutes, and it turned out perfect. I liked the sauce so much that the next night I made just the honey mustard sauce to dip French fries in — delicious! We will definitely make this recipe again soon.

Overall, I’d say it’s okay. There’s definitely too much mustard, which overpowered the rest of the chicken and flavors... I’d say doctor it to your preference and know that heating up the sauce will make it stronger in taste.

Loved it! I omitted the parsley because I didn’t have any on hand and grilled the chicken instead of baking. Great recipe. Thanks for sharing.

We don't use yellow mustard so I mixed dejon and spicy brown together. The chicken was very tender and the mustard and honey made a very good gravy.

I always try to stick to the recipe the first time I make it. I used half Dijon mustard and half spicy/grainy yellow mustard because I did not have enough Dijon.  This is an excellent recipe because the results are gréât and it's simple to prépare. Easy to make when you get home from work or when you're to tired to cook.  Just throw it in the oven and relax.  I would definitely serve this for company.  The seasonings are very good but next time I make it, I might add a quarter teaspoon of red pepper flakes just to give it a little kick.  This also makes a lot of pan juices. To serve, I would slice the chicken and then drizzle the pan juices over.  I would serve this with a side of mashed potatoes and some green beans. Enjoyed this meal a lot.

My kids & hubby really liked this.  I found it to be ok. The only change I made was adding dry mustard instead of regular to taste (a tip from hubby's chef friend who was here). It didn't overpower but I found it a bit off. Everybody else loved it so it's a keeper. Thanks!

After reading other reviews prior to making, I took some advice - I added 1 tsp brown sugar, 1 tsp worcestershire sauce, and a little lemon juice, with HALF the paprika called for. Also, dijon mustard or honey mustard works amazing! Turned out perfect! Next time I will make the sauce in the morning and let it marinate all day - so the whole chicken breast (inside and out) tastes like the sauce, not just the skin.

I followed the recipe and it came out very good. My grandson loved it and that who I made it for. I thought it was good but didn't have enough of the honey flavor I was hoping for. I think next time I may add a little more honey.

Very good recipe! I used chicken tenders instead of breast halves and adjusted the cooking time to 10 minutes on each side. Also, followed what other reviews said and halved the paprika. The sauce was tangy and the chicken came moist and not dried out. Did I mention how easy it was? Took me about 15 minutes to put together, plus baking time which wasn’t long. My family loved it! Would definitely recommend!

Great flavor and easy!  I used honey Dijon mustard for a little extra sweetness since that's what my family prefers, but otherwise made it as listed.

Unfortunately, I didn't have time to marinate the chicken, which would have helped a lot.  Even so, the chicken still came out delicious.  Left out the parsley, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  I used the full teaspoon of paprika and didn't feel it was too much.   Served with brown rice and a salad for a good weeknight dinner.

This recipe didn’t appeal to me at first- seemed too simple. But it’s delicious. My husband loved it. (Oh yeah, I added a touch of cayenne in.)  Highly recommend.

My family barely came up for air when eating this one! Using chicken thighs, I just seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and the paprika, then placed them skin down in a casserole dish. I omitted the other seasonings. The rest was as directed. At the end, I popped it under the broiler just long enough to crisp the skin and caramelize the sauce. We’ve put this one in our weekly rotation!

Made it as written with the exception of using Dijon mustard (it was a suggestion, and what I had on hand...so hey! That worked out). My picky, usually doesn't even like mustard, husband really loved this. He even went back for a second helping of rice smothered in the leftover sauce. This will be a new weeknight favorite at our house!!

Pleasantly surprised. Omitted basil and parsley, I didn’t have any on hand. Seasoned chicken tenderloins with salt, pepper and garlic powder then marinated using 1/2 of mixture of 1/2C spicy brown mustard, 1/2C honey and 1/2 tsp paprika for two hours before baking. Reserved other half mixture. While marinating chicken, I sautéd small yellow onion, chopped and 4 cloves fresh garlic pan in a teaspoon of olive oil. Placed the chicken on top of onion and garlic mixture in 9X13 baking dish. Baked covered for 30 minutes. Flipped chicken, drained most of the juice/sauce and added the remaining honey mustard mixture. Baked uncovered 20 minutes.  Then broiled for 10 minutes, flipping the chicken halfway through. Absolutely delicious.

Really good! After marinating for 4-5 hours, I grilled these - halfway through brushing excess marinade on the cooked side after flipping. With 18 boneless,skinless chicken thighs, I used 1/4 c mustard and 1/2 c Dijon, and 1/2 c of honey with 1 & 1/2x the spices called for. Went really well with roasted asparagus with lemon pepper and "oven roasted sweet potatoes" (recipe from this website). YUM. Not too sweet, not too mustard.

I put this on pork chops and it was delicious. I will marinade it next time. I used dijon mustard with white wine. I think this would taste amazing on chicken wings.

Love it. Changes as suggested:

less than halfcup of honey

similar proportions for a mix of dijon and honey

abt tbs of lemon juice

only salted and peppered one side of chicken

used various cuts
Put chicken on a bed of onions, carrots and small potatoes
cooked for 25mins with foil on
12 mins without  foil
and 3 mins on the broil 

result:  just the right amount of tang and sweetness. lovely darken bits also aesthetic

I decided to use up a little of a honey mustard I had on hand. Worked well. I marinaded the chicken in half the sauce for a few hours, I didn't want to bake with that so I  put the chicken in a foil lined dish and poured over the remaining sauce, turned half way through cooking time. I was afraid the  taste was going to be either  overpowering on the mustard or too sweet from the honey but it passed the taste test and will be made again.

This was an easy recipe to put together for dinner tonight. I cut the paprika to 1/2 tsp. and next time I make this I will cut the basil to 1/2 tsp. as well. As suggested I covered my baking dish with foil the first half and remove the foil for final baking. The chicken was moist and tasty.

I made this recipe a 2nd time which turned out better with these minor changes: 
I doubled the sauce ingredients and marinated the chicken breasts (which I cut lengthwise in half) for a couple of hours. Then I placed the chicken and all of the sauce in a 9x11 glass baking dish, and baked it for 45 minutes, no need for turning, but I did cover it with tin foil for the first 30 minutes. No fuss, no muss . . . turned out lovely with lots of sauce for the mashed potatoes. We served it with green beans. Will be making this again!

This recipe is perfect when you don't have much time to cook. I prepared it for my boyfriend's roommates and we all loved it. For the sauce, I substituted a mixture of dijon mustard and sweet mustard for yellow mustard to create a more zesty flavor. I also baked the chicken in aluminum foil to keep it extra juicy! The leftover sauce mixed with a little bit of olive oil also makes a very nice salad dressing. I will definitely make this again.

Loved it.  Next time I will use less dried parsley.  It was a little overwhelming for me.  Other than that, it's a winner!

Made it with chicken thighs instead and the family loved it. The only problem is the thighs created more liquid.

Delicious way to make chicken and so easy!  I made the sauce as stated and let the chicken marinate in it over night.  My husband thinks the sauce would be good on pork, too.

I modified this receipe and it turned out great. First I reduced the amount of mustard to 1 Tablespoon and added 2 Tablespoons of lemon juice. I also added 1/2 cup of olive oil and omitted the paprika.  I let it sit overnight so that the chicken would absorb the flavour. Barbecues nicely without drying out the meat.

follow recipe exactly, however I should not have gone the second 15 minutes. That is probably why the chicken was a tad tough. Will definitely cut that second baking time in half. BUT, the flavor was awesome. I did take another persons advice and used half regular mustard and half dejon mustard. Will make this dish again.

It was very good.  Not as "mustard-y" as I expected. I also didnt have any paprika like I thought I did, so I substituted cumin which was fine. It did get a little bit more dry than I prefer so I'll probably cook it with foil on top next time

I prepared very large chicken breasts and was still able to make this dish with the amount of sauce created by the recipe. The chicken came out juicy and delicious. My friends loved it. We skipped the salt and pepper to taste step at the beginning.

This was simple and delicious.  I did marinate it in the sauce a few hours before cooking because it made it much easier to pop in the oven right before company came over.

My son and I liked it, but it does need some tweaking.  My husband did not like it because it was too sweet.  I will try it next time with less honey and use Dijon rather than yellow mustard.

We really enjoyed this. There's a Mexican restaurant in Omaha called Julio's which has served a chicken dijon recipe for years. If I added a little white wine to the sauce and thickened it up a bit possibly with corn starch, that may closely approximate the sauce in that recipe. As called for, the recipe doesn't make a lot of sauce, so if you prefer a lot of sauce, considering doubling the sauce volume. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and adjusted the bake time accordingly (checked after 15 to 20 minutes, flipped and applied the sauce on the other side), then baked for another  7 to 10 minutes.

It was really good, juicy, the hubby loved it.  I left out the paprika(cause I didn't have any) I also used 1/4 cup honey and 1/4 cup mustard (I just cut it all in half) because I only had one chicken breast (was huge so we split it)

This is really good. Paired it with baked scalloped potatoes with a touch of mustard in them.

Lots of flavors.  I did as one suggested and poked holes and marinated for 1/2 hour.  I changed a couple of things:  I cut back on the paprika, added a tsp. of dark molasses.  I didn't have any dried basil so added dried cilantro.  I will definitely make this again.

I love this one it turned out great and my guest even asked for the recipe. I didn't have basil so substituted other spice and chives. I will get the ingredients I need next time and will certainly have it again. I used the Dijon mustard and a small amount of yellow mustard. Great!

I used amber honey (best for cooking) and the old style Dijon prepared mustard I had on hand... I will make this again, thank you for sharing!

After making a couple of changes this was a definite growd pleaser. I used three pieces of chicken breast instead of six and still doubling the sauce. Baked it in a nine by nine baking dish after marinating for six hours. Remember to roomatize the chicken before baking. Served over rice with a side of salad.  Will be making this again :) Thanks  a million, I love this website.

This was really good, but the flavor was slightly off. I used Dijon mustard and half of the paprika like some suggested. I think it had a little too much basil.  I also put all the sauce in a pan and made a gravy. It was pretty good. I will definitely make this again.

It was okay but not to my taste.  Might need more of something.  My family said it was okay but not a keeper.  Maybe it should be made with Dijon mustard rather than regular mustard.  It needs more zing.  Just can't put my finger on it.

Used a very large breast so I cooked for an hour, left covered for 40 minutes and basted every 20 minutes, other than that I followed the recipe, very good taste.

I integrated all the suggestions made in the reviews.  I used part dijon, part grainy dijon, and part plain ol' mustard. I used about two thirds of honey and 1/3 of maple syrup. I went light on the paprika and basil.  Added a splash of lemon. 
Overall, the flavour was on point. It was far better than I was expecting it to be. It probably would have been better had I marinated it too. It was super juicy - I would recommend a small dish to ensure the chicken is immersed in the sauce.  

My only complaint is that the sauce had a low viscosity and as a result, I lost some of the yummy sauce on my chicken.

I used boneless skinless thighs instead of breasts and the recipe worked very well.  The sauce is yummy!  I did leave out the paprika since we don't like it.  But the directions are clear and easy to follow; the cooking time is perfect.  I used regular yellow mustard and liked the flavor but I can see where dijon will give it another dimension.  This recipe is a keeper!  Thank you!

Needs a little more seasoning, other than salt and pepper, but otherwise the chicken is really good other than that.

It's just chicken but it's a good recipe, the marinade is nice. I think it does need to sit in it for overnight, but havent tried the faster version yet. I would probably make this recipe again.

Made exactly as the recipe stated, very easy prep. Just cut the recipe down for one chicken breast. I thought the flavor was light and not over powering. Served with roasted carrots, peppers and potatoes. Hubby loved it.

This recipe is really yummy! It seemed like a lot of honey so I underplayed it at first; but when I tasted the mixture before pouring it on the chicken it wasn't sweet enough for me. For the first 30minutes in the oven I covered the dish in foil. Then for the last 15 minutes I baked it uncovered and this came out juicy and perfect. I do agree with the other posts and will try Dijon mustard next time. There is room for improvement here but a great recipe!

This was an excellent, very easy, recipe. I followed the advice of many others and used Dijon mustard. Everyone enjoyed this chicken!

Estimated the sauce ingredients, used Dijon and whole grain mustards. My 2 year old ate it, so I'll make it again.

So followed this exactly. As far as the taste, I felt there was very little of a honey taste as there was mustard, basil and paprika. And knowing that chicken breast take very little time to cook, I still left it in for the 30 minutes on one side and 10 on the other, as suggested and it was way to dry. I would try this again, using the same ingredients. I would just alter the measurements and definitely cut down the cooking time.

Great taste and easy to make!  The only thing I did different was accidentally put in 1 TBSP of Parsley instead of the 1 Tsp.   Served with wild rice blend and green beans.  Everyone cleaned their plate!

I used Dijon mustard and halved the paprika. The wife didn't like the paprika in it  (she ate only half of hers) and my son threw his away after two bites. I didn't really have a problem with it. It was light in flavor which is what I wanted and the dijon made it taste sort of creamy. I will try it again with no paprika. Thanks.

I made exactly as written except I had a package of chicken thighs instead of chicken breast.  It was easy and very tasty, first day it was very tangy, and 2 days later the leftovers were very sweet, the flavor of the honey stood out more.  I will make it again.  Thanks!

I followed the suggestions and used Dijon mustard. It was pretty good. I think the Dijon was a little strong, but I added the honey and the Dijon to the same measuring cup, so I don't think I got the proportions correct. I'll definitely try it again!

I made the recipe as-is. 
In the words of my kids, "It wasn't great but it was bad. It was ok, I guess." 
Would they eat it again? Yes.
Are there other recipes that they like more? Yes.
Will I make it again? Not anytime soon, but possibly.

Very Tasty! I will admit I didn't do the exact recipe. I took the advice of some of the reviews and used Dijon mustard in place of regular.  I also marinated the chicken in the honey mustard sauce all day in the fridge. Then I baked in my toaster oven so I didn't have to heat an entire oven. It was very delicious and I definitely will make again soon!

Simple...Fast...Yum!  Definitely don't consider myself a cook and I'm not a fan of spending a lot of time in the kitchen since my job doesn't leave me much down time.  This was a great dish that my crew and I really enjoyed and met my needs for being really easy to prepare.

This recipe is very good, especially considering it is so simple and easy to prepare!!  I didn't give it 5 stars because I found it somewhat bland, so next time I make it I will probably add some more spice.  Otherwise it was very good.

This was delicious.  I did use a Dijon mustard because this is what we prefer, and I also used an orange cinnamon honey which was spectacular in the sauce. This was a very nice recipe. Thank you for sharing!

I've made this a few times and love it as it is, but my hubby doesn't like his food spicy, so I have to do it in separate dishes and only put one teaspoon of curry in his and he loves it. Thanks to the recipe provider.

Did not fall in love with this recipe at all. The chicken was tender. (Although I always tenderize chicken breasts slightly with a mallet before grilling.) Perhaps my choice of dijon brand was its undoing. I used Grey Poupon (sp?).

This is definitely one of my favorite recipes by far. The ingredients blend together perfectly, however, I do add some minced garlic (refrigerated), just a pinch of it. My boyfriend loved it so much that he can't get enough of of my cooking now.

I was a bit  nervous about this recipe because when I made the honey mustard sauce and it was super spicy. I put it on the chicken and put it in the oven. I did not flip it I just let it cook for the 45 minutes then I took it out and it was not spicy at all. I served it over rice and mixed veggies and it was delicious. I will definitely be making this meal again.

One of my favourite meals to cook. I substitute the paprika for cumin and chili powder however and it makes quite the difference, adding a nice smokey and spicy element to it.

This recipe was a hit.  It's easy and doesn't require a lot of fuss.  You can put it in the oven and forget about it  until it's time for the one sauce application.
     I used Dijon mustard, reduced the honey slightly and covered with aluminum foil for the first half-hour.  It's good for company as well as for everyday.

I've been making this recipe for years and would not change a thing. I even make just the honey mustard recipe for the family to use as a dipping sauce for nuggets and such!

I thought it was delicious! The honey taste came through the strongest, which was awesome! My only hesitation is that I don't know how many calories are in it.

I actually made this with some pork chops that I needed to get rid of and it was awesome. I used spicy brown mustard when I made it and the sweet and spicy was a pleasant mix. The pork turned better that I expected.

This recipe turned out AMAZING! The only thing I changed was adding a little lemon juice to add some more acidity. I also only baked it for an extra 5 minutes instead of 10 or 15 because it would have been overcooked if I had baked it longer. It may have just been my oven though because we have had problems with it in the past. I served this over jasmine rice with lemon and broccoli and my family LOVED it! Thanks for the awesome recipe!

For a weeknight meal it was just, OK.   I cut back on the paprika as a reviewer suggested.  This recipe needs more adjustments to have rich flavor.  I would suggest using aluminum foil and cooking spray for an easy clean up.

I would make this again, I absolutely love only thing I did differently was I took all the season and made a rub for the chicken. I let it sit for a few hours,and then put it on the grill. I based the chicken with the honey  and dijon mustard( as a previous reviewer suggested to use). It came out perfect . It was full of flavor.  will make again.

Was wonderful! I put less paprika in my mixture then added Gallic and Onion powder to taste. I also halved the breasts as well as salt and peppered both sides while cooking covered with foil for each duration. It came out flavorful and moist. Will certainly save for another time.

My husband and I enjoyed this dish very much.  I halved the spices and used honey mustard along with the regular honey but I halved that as well.  The end result was a very moist chicken with a light sauce that allowed the chicken to be the star.  I served with a salad with bleu cheese dressing and sourdough bread and it was a hit.  And it was super easy to prepare.

I liked it and my family did too.  Nice change in how I typically make chicken breasts.   I omitted the paprika and used dijon.  It is a sweet flavor but my husband and kids liked it.  I'll make it again.

It was a very good choice - quick marinade to make and it made the chicken very moist and delicious. I wouldn't give it 5 stars solely because i feel like it was missing something, but still a good go to!

Made according to original recipe and used yellow mustard.  Had too much of a mustard taste.  May have been OK using dijon mustard but definitely didn't like the taste using yellow.  May try again by marinading and using dijon.

We really enjoyed this recipe! I used Dijon mustard since I was out of yellow mustard. Perhaps the Dijon gives the sauce an extra tang...not sure if it really makes a difference. For paprika, I used Hungarian  paprika (sweet). Also, marinated the chicken in the sauce for an hour. I made extra sauce because I thought the chicken might need more during baking, but that was not the case at all. I ended up drizzling some of the extra sauce over steamed broccoli--delish! I think this dish would go well with honey roasted potatoes.

Measurements of all ingredients were spot on as well as cooking time, in my opinion. Easy recipe to make and will make again!

Made it as written, withr the exception of the parsley flakes.  I never use those!  It was good!  The addition of paprika really added something.  Four stars, because next  time, I will use a bit more mustard, and less honey.  I also think that letting it marinate for a few hours would make it even better.

For the prepared mustard, I used a quarter cup of dijon mustard and a quarter cup of regular yellow mustard. This chicken was delicious! The sauce is so easy to make that I've been making it to try on all sorts of other things. Highly recommended!

I didn't see the posts about the dijon mustard until after I had already gotten my ingredients but I was really happy with it with the yellow mustard. If using yellow mustard I might have added a touch more honey just because the mustard sharpness really shines through. I have the problem that when I make chicken it's always bland and this recipe seemed to break that curse for me. It was very flavorful and a healthy meal and tasty with some mashed potatoes and asparagus.

I didn't have paprika and all I had was pre-portioned thin chicken breasts. I used half the honey and stone ground mustard, and only sprinkled a little of the basil in. I baked it at 350 for 30 min and turned halfway (closer to 20 min because I forgot). It was quick and tasty...but I guess was only part of the recipe.

Give it a nice kick with chili garlic sauce. After cooking is complete, add a couple teaspoons to the broth and mix in. I also used Kens Steak House Honey Mustard instead of yellow mustard.

Such an easy meal to make! I did reduce the paprika to 1/2 teaspoon since I was feeding a 4 yr old and 3 yr old, but it came out great! Will definitely be making this again.

Simple, quick and tasty. Definitely a fan. A bit sweet, less honey for us next time. Otherwise, lovely recipe.

Good and simple dinner for the family.  Like others suggested, I used Dijon mustard.  Was a nice change to dress up chicken dinner.

This was wonderful! I used dijon mustard and it balanced the sweetness of the honey perfectly. My significant other usually doesn't like chicken thighs but he tore these up!

I loved this recipe! I didn't have dried basil because I don't think dried basil really tastes like anything. Added oregano and a sprinkle of garlic powder.  Also sprinkled the smoked paprika and oregano on the breasts themselves. I was only making 2 breasts so I just eyeballed the honey mustard amounts, leaning to generous. Turned out awesome! Will be making again soon!

I'm not a huge fan of the honey/mustard flavor combination, so this was a pleasant surprise. I made the recipe exactly as written (the chicken breast halves were a tad smaller than average, as they were labeled "hand-trimmed" compared to the usual ones). Despite what seemed to me to be a good amount of honey and mustard, somehow the flavor came out fairly mild. And the breasts were cooked well enough, but still came out juicy and not dry. I ate it with wild rice on the side, which soaked up a bit of the sauce. Worth making again!

Husband and toddler approved! I made a little extra sauce so there would be some to dip the chicken in after cutting. Nice flavor. I didn't change anything but the proportions.

Delicious!  I am not a fan of mustard, so I adjusted the ratio a bit; less mustard, more honey.  I also added fresh chopped cilantro, which I highly recommend!!  Tasty, tender, and so quick and easy to make.

I loved the taste of this recipe. It's easy to dry out chicken. Mine came out almost too dry but was still great. Next time,  I plan to marinate it first and then cover as suggested in some of the other reviews for more flavor and moisture.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious! I don't like honey mustard! My wife does though so I decided to try this. I followed the advice of others here and used half yellow mustard and half dijon mustard. I also covered my pan in aluminum foil during baking and nixed the paprika altogether! Regardless it was a hit. I plated it with some steamed rice for a healthy but tasty meal! I don't like honey mustard but somehow this won me over! I drizzled some of the extra sauce over the rice and chicken before I served it. My wife said she would pay $14.99 for what I fed her if she were at a restaurant! Can't beat that! =)

We really enjoyed this quick and easy recipe.  I liked the idea to use dijon instead of yellow mustard, but we were out so I used sweet hot mustard that we had on hand and it was fantastic.  I will definitely do that again, but feel confident that any mustard we like would work.  I thought the flavor was great, but I'd also like to try marinating beforehand, as others have suggested, to see if makes a difference.

I also agree with the other reviewer that pointed out that a smaller dish keeps the sauce on and around the chicken instead of running off and cooking away.  We will make this again.

Great recipe. Based on some other reviews i did some minor changes. I marinated my chicken, rubbed it in.  i also added a splash of lemon juice and used dijon mustard, other than that, what a fantastic meal.  Served it with puree sweet potato and steamed broccoli. What a hit indeed!

Not bad at all. Even our picky eater ate this. Needs a little something though.  Maybe some cheddar cheese sprinkled on top during the last few minutes of cooking?

 I'll probably use Dijon next time. And perhaps a bit more honey.

I tried this last night for my significant other. I wasn't sure how he would like it, but he really liked it! I bought chicken tenderloin on accident but it worked really well. He liked that. I also added more honey then Dijon for the honey taste. Which also worked out better. Over all we loved it.

I used 1/4 cup prepared yellow mustard and 1/4 cup dijon mustard. With that small change the flavor was kicked up several notches and was still kid friendly.

I love this recipe, I use less paprika,  added rosemary, little lemon, fresh basil,and garlic. Always use honey mustard, last time it was so strong with reg. mustard. Always yummy! I like to cover the chicken for part of the cooking, leaves the chicken so moist.

Very tasty! I had all ingredients on hand, so this was my choice for dinner. However, I saw many reviews stating to use Dijon mustard instead. I did not have that so stuck with the yellow.  I thought it tasted great with just yellow mustard.  
I also saw other reviews that said it came out dry. I did have 7 chicken breasts instead of the six called for, so this worried me. I ended up doubling the sauce recipe. It seemed on the sweet side, so I added 1 tsp. Worchester sauce to cut the sweetness a bit. It worked! 
After salting and peppering, I pierced the chicken with a fork a few times to allow the sauce to seep in as it was cooking.  Came out fabulous! Very tasty and not dry at all. Thank you!
4 stars only because I didn't make as the recipe stated and made a few changes.

I have made this recipe a lot over the past years. I did not change anything until this time. My mother-in-law can not eat honey so I used pan cake syrup instead and it turned out just as good. Thanks.

This was possibly the worst meal I ever made and I will not ever make it again.  I read a lot of the other reviews before I made this and it sounded so good, however the end result didn't match the other reviews I read.

Oh this was so delicious!  After reading other reviews, I opted to use dijon mustard.  My family really enjoyed it.  I used a family pack of chicken breasts.  I wasn't sure what to make for sides and decided on rice and fresh asparagus. What a hit! There wasn't a bite left.

It was really good.  I would take the advice others have given and let it marinate for a while before baking.  I didn't do that and think it would have tasted a lot better.  

I used spicy brown mustard and it was excellent!

Definitely need to double the sauce and will try a different mustard next time. I suggest using foul to cover draining the juice from the pan after 30 minutes and then flip baste with remaining and cook uncovered for the full additional 15 minutes.  I did 4 large breasts and was barely enough but the kids ate it that's what matters most. You know kids are picky.

This was disappointing. I used Dijon and kept all ingredients as written.  This just wasn't great. It was ok. But not close to good enough to make again.

I used boneless skinless chicken breasts cut in 6-7oz pieces.  Made 9 pieces.  I didn't have any basil or parsley so I used dried rosemary and carrot greens. Also used prepared Honey-Dijon mustard. I think for those that said the paprika overpowered the dish they probably used smoked and regular paprika was perfect amount of spice.  Baked 20 minutes one side and 15 minutes on other and turned out beautifully moist.

It was amazing! No complaints whatsoever, I didn't even put any salt or pepper on it, it tasted amazing the way it was. I would give some advice for any new people making it:
have some rice ready with the dish and make extra sauce, it would have been even better had I done that, I will definitely be doing that next time as well!

A quick, easy recipe that my whole family loved and said they wanted again. I didn't change anything - except for leaving out the parsley because I was out. Good to have for evenings that I didn't have a chance to plan ahead...or ones that I did!

I made this exactly as stated. The taste is OK, very light and aromatic. The problem I have with this method is that the flavour does not seep into the chicken therefore when you bite in to it, it's just dry on the inside. I would probably let the chicken marinade in the ingredients overnight before baking. Otherwise though this is a nice pairing with some basmati rice.

One of my favorite recipes, and the one that got me into cooking. 

Unlike others, I'm fine with adjusting a recipe, so I did make some changes others suggested (that I'm too lazy to repeat here) and with them the chicken turned out great.

Great recipe, only use 1/4 cup mustard instead of 1/2 cup (taste more like mustard and less like chicken. Instead of rotating the chicken I put a layer of the sauce on the bottom of the pan, laid out the chicken and poured the remainder over the chicken and it came out great.

There is one word for this recipe--delicious! Okay--and moist--probably partly due to the fact that I used drumsticks instead of chicken breasts. I highly recommend using Dijon mustard over yellow mustard! With these two changes, I give 5 stars! My husband wasn't super crazy over the dish but he is not a fan of mustard either. Poor guy! Next time, I think I will cut back on the mustard and maybe he'll enjoy it more.

Loved it! I read previous reviews and followed these changes: used Dijon mustard, cut the paprika in half and covered the chicken with aluminum foil the first 30 minutes of baking. My boyfriend and I both enjoyed it and I'll be making this again!

I only had four chicken breasts, so I made alterations to the amount of ingredients needed for the honey mustard. 1/4 cup honey, 1/4 cup mustard, and I reduced the spices all from 1 tsp to 1/2 tsp. The chicken turned out beautifully! I'm keeping this recipe!

It was interesting. Sweet, and surprisingly not too cloying or too sweet in flavor. I turned up the heat for the oven to 415 for the last ten minutes to get the skin really crispy.

This was very flavorful and easy.  I spooned out some of the watery juices before the 2nd round of brushing the sauce, which seemed to make more adhere.

I really did like this recipe. Followed it to a T. My husband was not a fan, the flavor was a little intense for him.

Yummy!  I used half prepared mustard and half Dijon and it was so good. Also, use a smaller baking dish, helps keeps the sauce on the chicken.

I really wanted to love this because I love honey mustard, but I wasn't wild about this recipe because the flavor wasn't that great to me. I may try a different mustard if I decide to try it again.

Debating between a 3 and a 4. The chicken was moist and cooked well but the sauce wasn't very good or flavorful.

This dish was wonderful.  Chicken was nice and moist.  The honey mustard glaze and all the spices added to the chicken being nice and moist.  Little spicy.  Has a nice kick at the end.  Spices blend nicely.  I covered it for the first 30 minutes as it cooked.  Then I flipped the chicken coat the chicken and cooked uncovered.  Delish!!!

Well, it was easy to make, but I didn't care for it after it was done.  However, it did taste better the second day, and I used it to make a chicken salad, which gave the salad an interesting (good interesting) taste.

Made this tonight for dinner. It was liked by all in the family...even the picky one. I used dijon mustard only and think I would like to add a little yellow mustard just for a little bite. I also took the advice and only added half of the paprika. Will be making it again!

I made this with Dijon mustard, and I made sure to pound the breasts first.  It was quite good!  I must admit that the addition of basil was very interesting, but it really made the dish.  I've added this recipe to my collection!

Loved it.  Easy.  Nice change to find a chicken recipe without BBQ sauce or canned soup in the sauce.  I used really plump chicken breasts and I followed the advice of others and marinated them 4 hours.  Perfect!  I also followed the cooking advice and put tin foil over pan for first 30 minutes of cooking.  Use a smaller pan to save the sauce and juices.  Use Dijon mustard for sure, plain mustard doesn't cut it.  I cut the paparika in half, and will do that again.

Yum Yum Yum! So quick and easy and flavourful! Made these and they were so moist! I am trying to use up my whole-grain mustard, so used that instead yellow mustard, but it worked out just the same! The only annoyance was that the honey left my pan with burned on sauce! It may have been that my pan was just too big for the 2 portions I did, because in the video for this recipe it looks like they have a lot of liquid in their pan after cooking. I did not, however. If I were to do this again, I would line with foil just so it was easier to clean up afterwards.

We didn't love the honey mustard taste, but maybe that's just our preference. It was easy to cook, and per another review, I put foil over it for the first 30 minutes and it was the juiciest baked chicken I've ever made!

Me and my wife wanted to start eating a little more healthy, so I started going through some recipes on here. Now I'm not one to waste food and so I am really hesitant on some things. But I thought oh why not just try it. The directions seemed simple enough. WOW, this was so good, it instantly went into our favorites section of our recipe box. The only change I made was I used spicy brown mustard, cause that's all I had at the time. Really enjoyed the flavor. Served with a side of orzo and rice also found on this site.

Way to much mustard for me, even cutting it with 1/2 regular 1/2 Dijon.

I am always looking for recipes that make chicken breasts more palatable to me as for some reason I am the one in a million who does not care for them. But they are healthy so I do what I must! Having said that, I made this last night and found it to be quite good. I only had honey mustard so I cut down on the honey and made everything else as written except I used a smaller pan to completely cover the chicken. My husband loved it. Quick, easy and healthy. Who can ask for more. Thanks!

SO MOIST! I made up the sauce and marinated overnight (could do it right in the baking dish), and I kept it covered during the whole bake time, basting once or twice including turning once. It needed to cook about ten minutes longer than stated per my thermometer (for a 165 temp). I spooned lots of sauce on top for serving and it was DELICIOUS!!

Good, not great. I used yellow mustard since it didn't specify what kind. Maybe a different mustard would have made for a better taste. Cooked everything else as suggested but used a smaller baking dish as suggested by others.

I have tried few recipes from this site but I feel compelled to write about this one. I have never made honey mustard chicken before. I had a friend visiting from Australia. I wanted something simple and different. I also wanted something I could do quickly after work. We really enjoyed the the chicken. It was tasty and flavorful which was surprising as I would normally would have probably seasoned the chicken for similar recipes for at least 2 hours. 
I decided to double the ingredients and I also used the other half to do pork leg (hock) in a slow cooker with about a teaspoon of cider vinegar and 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar on high for 2 1/2 hours and 2 hours on low with mushrooms added in the second half. That proved to be another hit. The chicken was served with salad and saffron rice. The pork with sweet potatoes.

Made this one exactly as stated. Everyone liked it. My personal taste however prefers skin and bone! Nice flavour, easy to make, fast and the ingredients are usually in my kitchen.

This is a wonderful dish and quick + easy to prepare.

I did as a few others suggested- 
Used Dijon mustard
The only honey to trust anymore is if it has pollin in it, otherwise you just don't know.
I am a fan of white pepper. I used a full teaspoon on this and used a pinch of salt only.
only half of the paprika
Rosemary to taste
I used the skin and coated it with 1/2 of the mustard (coated with a little flour) 
then brushed it with a mixture of honey/ remaining mustard to the top reserving part for the other side.
Put the pan into the oven and finished as directed deducting the time for browning.

Best chicken ever for a quick dinner and it would work for a whole chicken if you used a meat thermometer. Great company food!

I made this for dinner tonight. After reading some other tweaks I used Dijon. I didn't have dried basil, so I used dried savory 2 TBS rubbed to powder. I also added a splash of Worcestershire. I scored the chicken breasts used a baking dish so the chicken just barely fit. I put the marinade in the baking dish then rubbed the salt and pepper into the chicken then coated the breasts both sides then covered with plastic wrap and marinade overnight. The sweet savory mustard flavor was wonderful. I served with yams and vinaigrette salad. Thank you for the great recipe

not crazy about it, I followed the recipe to the t.  Overly sweet, mostly a honey taste.  It's lacking something but I can't quite put my finger on it.  It was okay, but nothing to rave about.

didn't change a thing in the  sauce. Did change way I cooked it. I did it the same way I do the Key West Chicken on this site. I pound the breast out till they are even across in thickness. About 1/2 in.
Marinate over night. Grill 6 mins. a side. Sauce seals the juices in.
I toss the marinade and make  fresh sauce for basting and dressing for noodles or rice.

This is good and simple. Made exactly as directed though I did cover with foil for the first 30 minutes of cooking just to keep moisture in. Hubby really liked it!

The fam really liked the flavor of this recipe. I covered it with foil for 30 minutes and after turning the chicken it only took about 5 more minutes to reach good temps, not the 10-15 suggested so beware of over-cooking! When I make this again ( and I will)  I believe I'll pound the chicken to tenderize a bit first.

I used what mustard we had on hand, which happened to be Honey Mustard.  As a result, the chicken was a little sweet, but my kiddos liked it (esp Brianna).  We'll see if the leftovers reheat well.  Will definitely try again, but with Dijon Mustard next time.  Also used less paprika, as suggested by others.

Tasted great, easy to make.  The only thing is we used the basil we had dried ourselves and it was a little overwhelming.  If using home dried basil, I would cut it in half.

I used Dijon mustard instead of regular mustard.  It was tasty but not what I was expecting. Also, we downsized the recipe for 2 people, and it just didn't make enough sauce for the chicken, so it was a bit dry.  Next time I think I will double the recipe.

This turned out great for me, with Dijon mustard and otherwise as written.  I didn't even marinate (I just found the recipe 40 minutes before dinner) and it came out perfectly. My chicken was finished a good 20 minutes before the above suggestion, but of course the thickness makes a huge difference.

This was very good! I was cooking for only my husband and myself, so I cut the recipe to 1/3.  The chicken was very moist and the flavor was good.  However, it was still a bit sweet for my taste (husband loved it). I used spicy brown/course ground mustard instead of yellow, and would add a bit more next time, less honey (or maybe a lighter flavored honey?). Also went a little lighter on the basil  for personal preference.

I love this recipe. I have made it twice. Very surprised by the negative reviews. However, if it is not sweet enough for your taste, try using honey mustard or dijon instead of regular yellow mustard. Add half the paprika if you think it is too strong. As for the herbs, they work perfectly for me. Great recipe :)

I made this tonight and it was a perfect recipe.  I did cut both the honey and mustard in half as I used only 2 large chx breasts with two smaller pieces and next time I would even reduce the honey even more.  I also used deli style (spicy) mustard.  But, easy, really good, and healthy recipe.  Loved it.

The chicken came out great! As suggested, I halved the amount of paprika, and also used a smaller baking dish so that the chicken could continuously marinate in the honey mustard mix whilst in the oven. Overall, the recipe was great tasting, and I would definitely recommend!

I agree with DMM104, cut Paprika in half (I'm not big on basil so i cut that in have too) but i added about a1/4 or 1/2 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar just enough to complement the sweet and it was fantastic

It's ok but not really worth the honey it takes to make it.  It is easier and cheaper to just use honey mustard to coat the chicken and bake it and it tastes practically the same.

Tangy and delicious. I used breasts that had been marinated in honey mustard marinade to amp up the flavor, and I used stone ground dijon mustard. It was a touch on the sweet side for me personally, so I might cut down on the honey next time I make it. Definitely keeping this recipe!

Just made this recipe and it turned out great! Only thing I changed was I didn't have enough mustard or Dijon mustard so I added both and added 2 splashes of apple cider vinegar for more of a tang taste. It turned put beautifully! My husband really enjoyed it. Made white rice for the sauce that was in the pan and some dill potatoes. Great Sunday dinner

I went as many have advised and used part regular and part dijon mustard.  The chicken had flavor, and yet at the same time it was kind of ho-hum.  Perhaps I was expecting something bursting with more flavor and that subdued my response.  In the end, I'll probably make it again, but I really need to find the right side dishes to help bring some life to the meal

This was awesome. Best chicken I have had in a while. We grilled it instead of baking and basted it with the honey mustard while it was cooking.

I really liked this recipe, I used boneless skinless chicken breast instead of thighs, so it didn't turn out quite as tender as it could have.  I can see why it recommends the thighs instead, but the taste and flavor was amazing!  Will definitely make this recipe again. I did however add 2 tablespoons of already made honey mustard to the original recipe as well.

Judging by the positive reviews on this recipe, I think I did something wrong.  If I was really rich and didn't care about throwing food away, I would throw this away and go to Jack in the Box.  The chicken is edible and I can taste the honey and mustard, but that's where it stops.

I made mine with Dijon mustard and it was great! It was a little surprising when I took the first bite because I wasn't expecting it to have that much of a mustard flavor but after that I really enjoyed it! It was also super easy to make. I'm college student cooking in a small (but adorable) apartment kitchen, so it's always great to find good recipes that don't require a lot of different kitchen appliances or utensils. I definitely recommend it.

I followed the recipe, but used a smaller pan size as suggested by other reviewers in order to retain moisture. My husband thought the sauce was pretty good, but the kids and I did not really care for it a great deal. I think maybe we were thinking it would be sweeter. Nevertheless, thank you for sharing your recipe!

I used local 1/4c raw honey and 1/4c Amy's organic Dijon mustard. My family thought it was the best chicken they have ever had! Delish with a side of organic brown rice and quinoa pilaf and big heads of broccoli!

This is a very easy and yummy recipe. I made a few changes though: less honey than mustard (too sweet for my taste), used some coarse ground German mustard along with the regular mustard, added garlic powder to the sauce, dumped a bag of green beans into the pan with the chicken, and covered it for the first half of baking. Turned out dee-lish!

This was a hit at my house! I used bone-in chicken thighs and removed the skin. I used all the seasonings but I omitted the paprika because I didn't have any. I don't think it needed it anyway. I also added about 1 teaspoon of lemon juice. I took others' advice and baked the chicken in a small dish to keep the meat in the juices. I covered it with foil for the first 30 minutes then removed and continued basting every 10 minutes until done. It came out super juicy and everyone loved it! I will definitely make this again!

This was just OK. It didn't really prove to be very flavoursome. I probably won't make it again but it was passable.

This turned out great! Very tasty and flavorful. I follow the other reviewers advice and changed it up a little bit but I pretty much stuck to the basics of the recipe. I will definitely cook this again!

I made this for company last night. Only used 4 chicken breasts but the same amount of sauce. (It would have been enough sauce for 6 after all.) Used spicy brown mustard. Marinated the chicken in the sauce overnight and poured the whole thing into a 2-qt casserole to bake. I was honestly expecting more flavor. I neglected the salt and pepper to taste, so maybe it needed salt. My guests loved it though, so it's worth trying again with some tweaks.

Ok, I made this tonight for my family. And I thought that it was ok, my husband also thought it  was ok, and my son wouldn't eat it at all my mother on the other hand loved it, and said that she could eat it every day. I used honey Dijon mustard instead of just normal mustard, and I think that made the difference. The flavor was good, the reason that I thought it was just ok was because the sauce just dripped off onto the plate. I don't mind a thin sauce, but it did not stick at all. So as long as I scooped up the sauce with every bite it was good. The other thing is, the chicken was cooked perfectly, it wasn't to dry but not to juicy.  I don't know if I will make it again, but it was not bad at all. I would give a 5 but the sauce just wouldn't stick.

I can't put my finger on it, but something was off here.  I think it was the basil, although I used about half of what the recipe called for.  My husband said mustard and chicken don't go together.  Don't think this will be making a repeat appearance on my dinner table.

I did most of the work in my electric pressure cooker to get all the flavors in. Took about 15 min at high pressure. Afterwards I slapped on the remaining half of the mixture on the cooked chicken and tossed them in the oven for 10 minutes. Tasted absolutely delicious.

Wish I could give this a higher rating, but it really fell flat.  The cooking time is too long and should be reduced to a total of not more than 35 minutes.  45 minutes dried it out.  Maybe had it marinated in the sauce it would have turned out better, but wasn't impressed at all.  No flavor.  Tossing out leftovers.  Sorry.  :(

The mustard to honey ratio was not right. The mustard over powers the honey and is spicy. I cut the honey back to 1/4 of a cup and it was much better.

This was an amazing recipe! We decided that yellow mustard alone would not be enough so we added some dry mustard seasoning and we also marinated it and cooked it in a small 9 x 9 dish.  IT WAS SO YUMMY! My whole family ate seconds and I cooked it with rice and asparagus. The extra sauce tasted AMAZING over the rice! So excited to add this easy prep recipe to our regulars!

Overall, not a bad recipe.  I used the full amount of paprika, and I didn't find it overpowering.  If anything, I would probably cut down on the amount of honey, as I found it a bit too sweet.  Then I'd anticipate needing to reduce the paprika.  Something I might make again, but I'd have to make at least those changes.

I marinated the chicken for 3 hours, cooked accordingly but the chicken was not as juicy as I had hoped.  My boyfriend liked it so I may be making it again.

this is a very Awesome recipe, Thank you to the one whom came up with this idea. Very Delicious. The way that I baked it, I covered it with foil and rotated after 30 minutes and then covered it back up and when i took it out it was so juicy and the meat just fell off of the bone and one other thing i used chicken legs (drumsticks) and my 10yr old loved it.!!! He said this one is a keeper. Thank you and God Bless!!

I tried the recipe as is but when I tasted it near the end of the cooking time, I found it incredibly sweet. I added the juice of one lemon to the sauce and it was perfect! My guests loved it. So I would definitely recommend adding lemon.

Definitely marinate in the sauce during the day if possible. Baking time is closer to one hour. Very yummy.

I loved this recipe! My family did as well. They all commented favorably, but the absolute evidence of success was when my younger teenage son put his plate on the counter as I was cleaning up, he smiled and said, "You can make this again Mom."  :D

super easy, cooked as written but used chicken tenderloins and reduced the cook time a few minutes.  last five min I reglazed and used broiler to thicken the coating.  With these ingredients there is no need to marinade.

I used a mixture of French's regular mustard and dijon - a little heavier on the dijon. It's hard to judge the mixture by taste before it's baked but I found it too be a little bit too tangy so I added honey.

The sauce was tasty but the chicken was very dry if cooked as described. If I try it again I will shorten the cooking time and consider thighs instead of breasts.

Made it as suggested. Turned out fantastic. Family loved it. Will be making it again.  I did use Dijon mustard, not yellow mustard, after reading some of the comments. It is a fast, and an easy recipe for cooks of all levels of experience.

I have to give four stars because my kids love it.  I marinated the chicken overnight in a little bit of the honey mustard mix and we were out of dijon mustard so we only use regular classic yellow mustard.  Overall, I think it is OK.  Would not mind making it again for them.

Was very good. I cut paprika in half and used a little less than 1/2 c of regular mustard. Pounded chicken breasts thin and cooked covered for the first 20 min. Then I flipped, basted and cooked uncovered for another 15 min. Tender and flavorful. My picky husband and 5 year old daughter gobbled it up! Definitely a keeper.

This recipe was a hit in our household! I followed the recommendations of other posters on here and reduced the amount of paprika. Another note, which I believe kept the chicken so tender was to line the baking dish with foil, then cover the chicken with foil to hold in the steam. Delicious over rice. :)

Baked covered for half an hour to keep the chicken moist. Made a mental note to decrease the paprika by at least half but forgot to add it completely - still turned out great. For the flavors to penetrate through the chicken, I sliced up the chicken and covered it in the sauce after it was done cooking. It absorbed up the sauce and was much more flavorful.

Followed recipe ... except cut back on the paprika.  Did not taste the basil (maybe will add a bit more next time).  My family LOVED it ...husband & kids kept asking for more! Will make again.  Served with Roasted red potatoes & steamed green beans.  It was a hit!  Easy to make as well!

My husband's comment was that it is "interesting".   The chicken was tender, but the sauce was a little overpowering.   Perhaps if I had used dijon mustard it would have been less so.

Overall, pretty good. It wasn't the same honey mustard flavor I was anticipating, but that may have been due to the specific types of honey and mustard that I had on hand. Made for great leftovers as well.

This recipe recieved mixed reviews in our home.  My husband didn't like much, but I thought it was fine, but I won't be making it again.  I used 1/2 dijon and 1/2 regular yellow mustard.  Other than that, I kept to the recipe.

Tried this recipe last night, it was wonderful.  However , I did use Spicy Mustard instead and flattened the breasts to be the same thickness so as not to overcook the thinner pieces.

For a very simple recipe, it tastes much more complex. The flavor is good, although I did use 1/2 tsp. of paprika instead of the tsp. that the recipe calls for due to a comment made by another reviewer. For a quick and easy dinner that calls for few ingredients, add this recipe to your box.

I marinated the chicken for 4 hours but unfortunately it wasn't flavorful enough.  My boyfriend ended up chopping it up though and making a pasta salad with it which he loved.

This was a very good weeknight recipe!  I used chicken tenders, perhaps too many... I had to double the sauce to have enough to brush on both sides of the chicken.  But, it was quick, easy, & delicious.

Overall this is a pretty good recipe.  It tastes good as is, directions were clear and it's pretty much fool proof.   This is perfect for any beginner.  I followed one suggestion and marinated this for about an hour and worked perfectly. The reason why I didn't give it five is because it did not have any wow factor for me.  I think I know the culprit...and that is using regular mustard because it was a bit overpowering. I think next time I will try Dijon mustard like others suggested and see if it bumps this recipe up to five stars.

This was very good - had a bit of a kick. I used spicy brown mustard and fresh parsley. I liked the overall flavors and texture, but I would prefer to have breaded baked chicken with this as a nice sauce (I'd thicken and reduce it) on the side next time. I seasoned my chicken with garam masala and it added a nice touch.

This recipe is REALLY good, I will absolutely make this dish again.  I served it with long grain and wild rice and sauteed broccoli.  The only changes that I made in the recipe was I used dijon mustard and added a jar of whole mushrooms.  I also seared the outside of the chicken before I actually baked it just to add some color.  A must try recipe!!!  Even the kids loved it.

I thought it was really quite good.  Not amazing, but definitely good.  I used spicy brown mustard and added the squeezed juice of half a lemon.  Also, left out the paprika, frankly because I didn't have it, but it still was sweet and tangy and delicious over brown rice.

This was great--really tasty!  The honey mustard sauce was very good-a little spicy to be used as a dipping sauce, but it formed a really nice gravy consistency after baking.  I will definitely make this again!

This recipe was great. Excellent flavors. My kids loved it, which says alot, especially with a picky 15 year old who said to make it again. The only change I would make it using less honey and mustard. It made excess sauce. I would probably reduce it by half.

I used a couple of tsp. of dry mustard powder (because we didn't have prepared mustard) and it turned out pretty well. I scaled it down for two and baked it in a small round stoneware pan, so the chicken was really juicy. My husband said that he would eat it again and that's saying something.

This recipe was only so-so. I made it for my mother and she was less of a fan of it than I was. First of all, cooking w/ honey isn't great, 'cause everything gets super sticky and gross. Second, it did not specify what kind of mustard and I think the mustard I had at home just did not fit the bill. We decided that the next time we make this recipe we are going to skip the honey and skip the mustard and just use the other herbs and ingredients!!  =)

This was a lot better than I thought it would be. It had such a wonderful flavor. My 15-month-old ate a whole chicken breast he liked it so much, he did not want anything else just the honey mustard chicken. I will be adding this to the monthly rotation.

I thought this recipe was great, not to mention very easy! Pretty much made as written, except I used a smaller dish, covered with foil until the flip, and saved a little of the sauce for dipping. I only had 4 breast, so this may be why I had enough sauce left over. I would make a bit more of the sauce for next time to have plenty for dipping. Served with mashed potatoes and vegies. Can't wait to try it over a salad!

I found this to be a fairly simple and easy recipe to follow. The results are very tasty and i get complimented on my cooking when i make it. Makes a good alternative to a Sunday roast if you want to cook something a bit different.

Absolutely fantastic!  Super easy.. and best served as a salad w/ blue cheese, toasted almonds, sunflower seeds, and tomatoes, as suggested by a previous reviewer.  Really excellent and super easy!!  Can't wait to make again.. and neither can my husband! ;-)

I have made this recipe as directed and made it a second time with some modifications which my family raved about. I cut up chicken into small nuggets, dredged thru a flour and cajun seasoning mix. Cooked in pan with a little oil. Removed, placed in foil packet with sauce (used dijon 2nd time) and cooked about 20 minutes. Yummy.

This is very tasty quick and easy recipe as written. However, I took the advice of a few reviews and omitted the basil and used 1 teaspoon curry and it was even better!

very yummy, although buying honey mustard prepared and adding the spices would be just as flavorful, they taste the same, but delicious nonetheless!!

I was really looking forward to this recipe, but didn't think it was very good. I used only honey and ballpark mustard (less calories than Dijon mustard). I used a small square glass baking dish, and the sauce stayed on the chicken, but it didn't really bake into the chicken. The sauce was very runny, and I usually like a thick sauce- almost more like a gravy. I thought this was very plain.

This is turned out well, however, I prefer the honey mustard on the side aas a dipping sauce. But it was quick and easy to pull together and had great flavor.

It was okay.  Nothing special.  My only changes were chicken tenders and fresh parsley.  Also, it looked nothing like the picture...mine was almost bbq sauce colored, come to think of it, it tasted close to bbq too.

I tossed all together with a little oil minus the  honey and the mustard and made a marinade.  After allowing it to sit in the fridge for two hours I mixed up  the honey mustard and and poured it over the chicken.  Mine was completely cooked after 30 minutes.  I served with roasted potato wedges.  Very easy and tasty!

This recipe was VERY easy and pretty yummy.  For my personal taste I would probably have less mustard and more honey.  I served it with egg noodles which had the extra sauce over them.  Yum!

My family really liked this, but it was not my favorite.  I need chicken to be really jazzed up for me to enjoy it and this was just ok for me.

It was a nice main coarse, but didn't stand alone too well. The meat wasn't as flavorful as I would've liked it to be usually. Maybe if it was marinated. Still, it tasted great, and the seasonings mixed perfectly together.

Added a little bit of red pepper for zing and this was a hit with husband and teenager.  Leftovers were good over salad, using the sauce as dressing.

This dish was not my favorite.  I thought the taste was odd and the basil tasted strong and out of place in this dish.  Or perhaps it was the type of mustard I used, which was Dijon.  Whatever it was, the taste was just unpleasant.  My husband said it was okay, but we both agreed this one wouldn't make it in our recipe book.

So delicious and so easy! I used slightly more honey than mustard because I prefer a little sweeter rather than tangier. I also used a smaller dish, and the chicken turned out so moist and delicious! The flavor is fantastic. A+!!

Was tasty and chicken was moist, I used Dijon mustard and found it too 'hot' - really caught the back of my throat! I'd use the recipe again, but with less mustard :)

My young family enjoyed this chicken dish and we will be making it again.  I did not use bacon, as I didn't have any.  It was moist, tasty and kid-friendly.  I used grainy mustard instead of the 'regular' type.

Made this last night.  We thought it would have tasted even better as a sandwich on a roll.  Will definitely make again. It seemed like there was too much sauce, may halve the honey and mustard next time.

This is such a quick & delicious dish.  I use 1/4 cup yellow and 1/4 cup dijon mustard.  Our daughter especially loved it.

I used a little less mustard than the recipe called for so it was a little sweeter... Very easy to make...Yummers!

It was really good but I omittd the spices and just had the honey, mustard and 2 tbsp brown sugar.  I used bone in chicken so I let it bake for about 30 min before adding sauce.  Really good!!  Even my husband liked it.

I normally love honey mustard so I thought this would be a no-brainer.  We did not really care for this.  The sauce was too spicy and the basil didn't seem to go with the tastes.  I used dijon mustard because we were out of spicy brown but maybe that was the problem?  I don't think we'll be trying again, though.

This is a great main dish. I use a spicey mustard instead of regular. I also like the idea another reviewer had of cutting the chicken into strips, I'll try that next time. As written this is good, add some steamed vegetables and some garlic bread, you've got a nice meal in a short time. Thank you for sharing.

Yum! This was very tasty and juicy.  I used a nice dijon and seasoned the breasts with garlic powder before basting. So so good.

I made this with one large chicken breast.  Used 2 tbl each mustard and honey.  Sprinkled in the other spices.  Baked for 15 min. before turning and basting baked for another 10 minutes.  VERY juicy and tender.

I thought this recipe was ok but it didn't wow me.  Maybe a little more mustard or some dijon to give it a little more kick.

Not bad...just not super for me.

I really hoped that this would be as good as reviewed, but I found the sauce to have an odd flavor.  My husband liked it and my two sons did not.  I followed the recipe exactly....to each his own, right?

Really yummy, the chicken was cooked to perfection, so succulent.  However i found the sauce to be a bit too sweet, so i added extra mustard and also sour cream to tone down the honey a little.  I also doubled the sauce amount to leave extra sauce as i served with rice.

I don't eat meat, but I made this for my husband and he raved about it.  He loves anything with honey mustard in the title and this was a big hit.  Did have to cook it longer than the recipe calls for though, it as still a little pink after 45 minutes.  Stayed very moist and it was SO easy to fix!  Will make again for sure!

Very simple and easy to make. I did cover it with foil for the 1st 30 minutes, then left uncovered for the last 15. My husband loved it and I will definately fix again soon.

I liked this recipe and have made it a couple times.  I usually butterfly the chicken breasts.  Last time I cooked it, the chicken came out very dry, so next time, I might try to cook it covered and see if that makes a difference.

I enjoyed how easy this was to make, but it was a little bit too sweet for my taste.  Perhaps I'm just not a honey mustard chicken person.

Delicious.  Chicken was very juicy and flavorful.  It passed the test with my husband who only likes meals with lots of flavor.  The sauce is what makes it...I made recipe with 4 chicken breasts so that there was plenty of sauce.

This is a good idea, but I wasn't fond of the honey mustard mixture.  I will try again using the honey mustard from the Aussie Chicken recipe on this site.  It has become the honey mustard of choice of our household.

My husband and kids really like this I thought it was okay.  I would have liked it more if the sauce was thicker.  Next time I will try to thicken the sauce.

I've used this a couple times as a marinade.  My girlfriend loved it from the oven, but I was a little less impressed.  On the grill though it works wonderfully.

This was average at best. Reduced to two servings. While it was easy, it just didn't appeal to me flavorwise. Won't be making again.

I made this recipe with Dijon mustard the first time and regular prepared mustard the second. It was delicious either way, although it seemed a bit sweeter when made with regular mustard. My 2 year old even liked it!

I thought this recipe was fantastic.  I made it for my husband and I, and he loved it!  And he isn't a big chicken eater.  My only suggestion is to make a little extra sauce for dipping.  I will definatly make this one again!

The flavor didn't sink into the chicken at all, leaving the chicken only barely tasting like the sauce.  Might try it as a marinade.  I halved the recipe and cooked for 45 minutes.

I agree with others and give this a 4 star rating.  It was super easy and I had everything on hand.  This is something easy for a weeknight dinner, but nothing really impressive.  I will make it again when I am needing something that needs very little preparation!!

My boyfriend really liked it. It wasn't flavorable enough for me. but, it was good! I think next time I'll make a bit more suace. But, overall, it was real good and I will definatly make it again! -- I also used others advice not to use so much basil. That helped, I think.

I really enjoyed this dish, I think my husband gets tired of me making it so much.  It has just the right amount of sweetness and tang to it.  I have used spicy brown mustard instead of classic mustard before and it was just as good.

Not bad.  Personally, basil doesn't go well with the other flavors.  I butterflied my breasts and cooked for 30 minutes total, basting after 15 minutes.  I will make again with tweaking.

Not a bad concept, but something with the spices I didn't like.  I loved the Aussie Chicken's honey mustard sauce so I may substitute.

This is a fabulous recipe!  It's easy, quick, and the paprika really adds a nice zing to the taste.  A pastry brush is definitely recommended, you can use a spoon, but the coverage the brush gives is unbeatable.

I made this tonight and it's excellent. My son really liked it. He loves mustard on anything, but liked the combo of the honey with it. It was very juicy and tender. I used frozen chicken breasts for this, too. And since I can't have much sodium, I used Mrs. Dash's table blend. He didn't notice that there was no added salt. Thanks for this recipe.

The overall flavor was good, but not very strong.  Next time, I would probably marinate it in the honey mustard mixture overnight.

Picky boyfriend made this one, and it was soo tasty.  We served it up with mashed potatoes, which was a perfect side dish for this.  We used regular yellow mustard, and next time we'll us dijon.  Overall, tasty dish!

Exceptional meal. When I read it I wasn't sure that the mustard wouldn't be overpowering, but it was a perfect match. I made it as it was displayed and will include it in our monthly menus. Thanks.

I made the chicken and used it for chicken sandwiches on kaiser rolls with lettuce, onion, and tomato.  I made extra sauce and poured it over the chicken before serving.  Mmmmmmmm....it was great and it got lots of compliments.

I wasn't sure I would like this since I don't like mustard, but it was delicious. I love recipes that are quick, easy, and use ingredients that I have on hand. I served with rice and green beans almondine. Yum.

I liked this and will make it again.  The honey and mustard made a sauce after cooking, and the chicken tasted better the second day after it had marinated in the sauce awhile.

This recipe was alright but not great.  I found there wasn't much flavour to it and it was too sweet.  I probably won't make this again.

This recipe was easy and quick.  I did use a spicy mustard for more flavor.  I also cut my chicken into strips to cut down on cooking time. I served it with green beans and cheddar mashed potatos. Overall a good super busy night recipe

This was a very good dish. The whole family enjoyed it, but everyone agreed that the basil should be left out because it overpowered the rest of the flavors in the chicken.

Good stuff.  I used a mix of Dijon and sweet onion mustard.  It was a little *too* spicy with all the dijon but still excellent, and couldn't have been easier.  Will make it again and play with the mustards.  I also doubled the sauce mix, there was plenty.

This was good I liked it. Especially the sauce.  I marinated it for at least 3 hours.  I used white wine grey poupon mustard and more of normal yellow mustard with the honey.  Very good combo! My parents thought the recipe was okay, not delicous but not bad.  I love honey mustard so I enjoyed it.
