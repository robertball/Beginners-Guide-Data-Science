I substituted chicken tenders in a coconut shrimp recipe and used this dipping sauce. This is a perfect blend of only 4 ingredients with NO cooking. t doesn t get much easier than this. Total nirvana! About 5 shakes of Tabasco gave it the perfect zing.

I didn't have dijon or hot sauce so I used spicy brown mustard with the honey and marmalade. It was delicious!!!

Very good sauce. Quick and easy with few ingredients. Didn't have hot sauce Dijon or honey on hand so I substituted Cajun seasoning yellow mustard and agave. Came out great.

My SO really enjoyed this sauce as did I. However I later realized that I apparently do not own a 1/2 cup measuring cup (HOW!?) and so apparently only used 1/3 of a cup of marmalade. It made the sauce much more dijon-y and we enjoyed it. Will try again with proper measurements!!:)

I used sugar free orange marmalade. It was delicious. Served it with oven fried coconut shrimp. Excellent combination. Will definitely make this again.

It seemed a bit to thick so I added not quite a 1/4 c. of garlic rice vinegar. It was amazing!

Flavor was a tad sweet and I had to up the mustard ratio. Instead of tabasco I used a mustard based hot sauce (backdraft) and it was amazing. I served it with coconut crusted tilapia with farro and roasted asparagus.

Loved it with the coconut shrimp. The 2nd and 3rd time I made it I added a bit more of the hot sauce. I would also use as a dipping sauce for chicken wings.

The flavor of this sauce was fantastic. Next time I plan to add more honey mustard and eliminate the honey.

Only put a squeeze of dijon mustard in, otherwise is overpowering. I've also substituted red pepper flakes instead of chilli sauce when I don't have any.

I made this for my Roasted Chicken Breast Strips and Roasted Veggies. I drizzled it over my meat and veggies on my plate. It was good! It has a hint of orange with a touch of sweet and a bit of spicy kick from the Dijon. I didn't add hot sauce due to the fact that the Dijon gave it just enough kick for me. It has a unique flavor. I will be making it again in the future.

Tasty! I was worried it would be too sweet with the marmalade and honey but the dijon does a really nice job of cutting the sweetness. You really only need a couple drops of hot sauce I went a little overboard.

My family loved it! Even my husband who doesn't like coconut ate the shrimp with this lovely sauce accompanying it and asked me to save the recipe.

I loved the simplicity and the bold flavor of this sauce! I used it as an impromptu dip for fish sticks and could almost taste the coconut that wasn't actually there LOL! The sauce was super simple and the mustard balanced the marmalade very nicely. I used sriracha since the sauce to me goes in an Asian/Caribbean direction. I would definitely make it again!
