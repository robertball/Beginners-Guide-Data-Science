I made this exactly according to recipe EXCEPT I made a chocolate-cookie crust instead of a graham crust. Holy moley--this is off the charts amazing. So much for dieting.......what the kids didn't eat, my husband and I finished. INSANE pie recipe.

This was the headline desert at a fine dinind restaurant where I worked.
The only differance was, I used fresh made whipped cream, instead off cool whip.
I also would add heath chips, mini chocolate chips, peanutbutter chips, the possibilities are endless.
You can also serve it frozen, which is what we did.  Delicious!  :-)

I've made this more than once and modified it slightly each time. First, instead of graham cracker crust, I used the chocolate Oreo cookie crust. Next, I omitted the botton layer of Nutella and instead scattered chocolate chips for a little crunch now and then. Then, to reduce calories, you can use light Cool Whip and low fat cream cheese. Make sure you soften the cream cheese first. After you remove the cream cheese from its wrapper, place it in a bowl in the microwave for 30 seconds,which makes the perfect consistency for blending. Mix with the Nutella till the cream cheese is thoroughly blended. Add Cool Whip and chocolate chips.  I love that no baking is necessary. Use less Nutella for less chocolaty taste and density. It's all good. It's quick and easy and super for taking to dinner parties, potlucks, preparing for Thanksgiving or having guests. Prepare the night before and forget it till you need it. Use the cover that comes over the pie crust as the pie cover and it'll stay moist and be easy to transport. Enjoy!

This is 5 star just as it is and so versatile. Some options:

1) Use different crusts, as others have said.

2) When dividing the Nutella, I doubled the amount you spread on the crust and used less for the filling.

3) Instead of Cool Whip, I used real whipping cream, whipped to stiff peaks and folded 1 cup into the chocolate/cream cheese mixture.  Gives the pie a more dense texture and quite delicious.

 4) Top with slivered almonds.

5) Haven't tried this yet, but I'm thinking some mint extract in the filling?

So many pie options, so little time.

I made this for my son's birthday dessert. I used Oreo cookies for the crust and made individual servings in clear Solo cups. Topped with chopped peanuts and chocolate curls. Everyone loved them. Stored in freezer until we ate them for a nice cool summer treat. Sorry for not getting a very good picture but I had ten hungry people waiting...Thanks Christina for an easy yummy dessert recipe.

I loved this pie!! Microwaving the cream cheese for 30 seconds as another reviewer suggested was an excellent idea, it really made the filling easier to mix and lump free. I used an Oreo crust instead of graham or chocolate.  The first helping we ate after having cooled it in the fridge for 4+ hours. The rest, we popped into the freezer and had the next day. I highly recommend only eating it frozen.  It didn't turn into a hard rock like an ice cream pie, remained smooth and creamy.

We loved this pie. It disappeared fast. Super easy to make. I used a chocolate graham crust and topped each serving with a dollop of fresh whipped cream. Will be making this again for a Summertime treat. Thanks Christina

This is such an easy, delicious pie recipe.  My family loves it.  I've done it with both pastry and graham cracker crusts and either way it turned out great.  I highly suggest to anyone who hasn't made this before to try it :-)

I made this in a 9x13 baking pan, and made my own Oreo crust for it.  I also didn't spread the layer of Nutella on the bottom, just mixed all the nutella, cool whip and cream cheese up together, spread it in the pan, and froze it overnight.  Cut it up into bite-size pieces when it was ready to serve, and transferred it to a serving dish.  The second time I made it, I added some chocolate chips I had to get rid of- good addition, but didn't make it leaps and bounds better or anything.  Both times it was gobbled up and people I didn't even know where seeking me out to tell me how good it was.  Very rich, so I think it worked better in bite-size bars than as big pie slices.  But for how easy it is to make and how delicious it is, definitely a 5-star recipe.

When I tried to spread the Nutella over the base of the crust the crust disintegrated, so I whizzed it all up together in a food processor to create a chocolate nutty cheesecake crust. It worked well. Will be making this again and again I suspect!

I had a jar of Nutella that was nearing its best before date and needed to use it up. This recipe fit the bill. it is easy to make and incredibly delicious! It would be perfect for a summer's day when it is too hot to bake.

Quite yummy.  Made my own chocolate cookie crust from a no-bake one on this site and made fresh whipped cream to replace the cool whip.  Awesomely decadent - special occasion only, as it is quite calorie and fat laden, especially with the changes!

Loved it! The first time I did it I followed the exact instructions. The second time I substituted the cream cheese with greek yogurt and it was perfect! The taste and flavor did not change at all, except for making it a little less sweet, which for me was better!

We all liked this one quite a bit, and it was pretty easy to make.  I made my own crust, but otherwise followed the directions as written.

This is the first pie I've made, and it turned out well, despite not having an electric mixer or whisk. I purchased the ingredients from the store, and I brought them home to thaw out for about an hour. As other reviewers suggested, I microwaved the room temperature cream cheese for 30 seconds. I also microwaved the Nutella for about 20 seconds. I eyeballed what appeared to be 1/4th of the container of semi-melted Nutella to spread on top of the bottom of the pie crust (I poured it from the container, and I can see how trying to spread room temperature nutella would deteriorate the pie crust.) I stirred the cream cheese, and then added the semi-melted Nutella, and stirred the combination vigorously with a fork for about 3 minutes. I then added half of the thawed cool whip with a spoon and folded the cool whip by making vertical circular motions in the cream cheese/nutella mixture to combine it all together, slowly adding the rest of the  cool whip. I placed the silky, fluffy mixture into the pie. I let it refrigerate for four hours before sampling, and it turned out wonderful. As other reviewers stated, this is a great base recipe that I can see adding other candies, etc. to make a variety of custom desserts.

I made this for a coworkers birthday in individual graham cracker crust pie cups it was so super easy. I decorated each and varied between chocolate chips  and crushed nuts with whipped cream topping. It was so super delicious and disappeared quickly. This is a recipe that will stay in heavy rotation. A big hit all the way around everyone loved it. I now have several other birthday requests.

Followed the recipe exactly and my family loved it. Very simple yet delicious. I made another but instead of a graham cracker/Nutella I used an Oreo crust/Hershey chocolate spread and it was amazing as well. Love this recipe!

OMG.  This pie is fantastic.  I made it AS IS and myself and my entire family devoured it.  This is why I have no picture to post....it was gone too fast!  I have an almost unhealthy appreciation for Nutella, and I'm always looking for new ways to use it.  So easy, but tastes like it was a lot of work.....thanks to Christina for submitting.

My family really enjoyed this recipe! It tasted so much like the french silk pie, and my kid-sister loved it - despite her hatred of nutella. I did not have any cool whip, so I substituted some heavy whipping cream, as another viewer did, and it was super creamy. We also topped the pie with whipped cream, and garnished it with leftover pie-crumbs (I had to make the pie crust, as I didn't have one on hand).
My husband also wanted peanut butter, so we spread a layer on the base along with the plain nutella.
HINTS: to make the nutella more spreadable (for the base layer), you can pop it into the microwave for 30 seconds (same with PB).

Fantastic! Easy to make and it was a hit. I didn't give away the Nutella secret. They thought I made the ganache on the bottom and I didn' tell them any different. Makes me look like a genius!Didn't make any changes. It is wonderful as is. Thanks for sharing this one. I will make it again.

Pie was easy to make (getting the Nutella out of the jar was the hardest part).  Our grandchildren LOVED the pie.  They really liked the Nutella layer on the bottom.

I followed what most reviewers suggested  (using a chocolate pie crust) and it was a great idea! I also opted out with putting a layer of chocolate sauce on the bottom, and it was still delicous. This desert is very rich, so be careful with the size of your 1st slice. Also make sure you chill it for at least 4 hours, if you try and sneak a piece too early it does not taste the same as if you waited.

I can’t have graham cracker crust so I put pecans and dates in a food processor to make my own. Also used heavy whipping cream(whipped up) in place of cool whip. Perfect sweetness.  Instead of a pie, I made small dessert cups. The recipe made 15.

This pie was just as easy as they say and just as delicious as professed.  I will be making again.  I also used low fat cream cheese and sugar free Cool Whip.  There weren’t any leftovers!

This is Awesome. I wanted to use a chocolate crust as others suggested but the store I went to was out, so I just used a regular graham cracker crust. I had no issues (gently) spreading the Nutella on the bottom of the crust, and I also added some crushed toasted hazelnuts to the bottom. I also added some to the top of the finished pie and it looked really pretty, but next time I would only put them on the bottom. It distracted a bit from the to-die-for flavor of the filling. I did make my own whipped cream, as I do not care for the chemical make up of cool whip. When I whipped the cream I kept in mind that some people thought this was too sweet, so I added only a bit of sugar to the cream, not as much as I usually add when making home made whipped cream, and the end result was not overly sweet. I will be making this again for sure!

This recipe was a hit at my family thanksgiving and Friendsmas! It's super easy to make! I made a few modifications the 2nd time I made it.  I bought 2 craham cracker crusts because there is so much filling made with these ingredients. I also used 1.5 tubs of whipped topping to make it a little lighter. I then used the remainder of the cool whip to top both pies. I also omitted the bottom layer of Nutella, it just broke up the crust when being spread on. 

I bought generic ingredients so it cost me about $10 or less to make 2 pies!

This is very delicious, very easy to put together, and VERY rich! A little piece goes a very long way. I used a chocolate crust instead of the graham crust, and what a treat.

Made this as is.  Excellent!  Put the Nutella and cream cheese in the KitchenAide for about 10 minutes on speed 4 and then added the whipped cream.  Amazing silky texture.  My family all had seconds.  This is a keeper.

I’ve made this several times. It’s rich and yummy and super easy. I use the chocolate crust and store it in the freezer. And I sprinkle mini chocolate chips on it if I have them. I’ve tried putting in extra Nutella but it made the pie too dense and harder to cut. Spreading Nutella onto the crust tends to tear it up a little. You could skip that step but it tastes great. So I just stick to the recipe and it tastes great!

Used an Oreo crust. Spread the 1/4 cup Nutella on the bottom and then sprinkled with mini chocolate chips. Served with whip cream on top. Guests loved it. Had about 1/4 left and put that portion in freezer. Hard to decide which I like the best. Will definitely make again.

Perfect as is but very modifiable.  I’m a fan of the Oreo crust - and often I just stir the entire Nutella amount into the pie whole- I have even gone gluten free by putting it in bowls to chill and even using loose crushed nuts.  This freezes AMAZINGLY and can be eaten in the frozen state, to be fair that is actually how we prefer it.

As a bonus I mixed in protein powder for my grandfather with a dab more Nutella and he loved it.

Tried it because I knew hubby wouldn't make a cake for my birthday - he declared it the best dessert I've ever made (20 years of cooking for that man!)  Easy to make, used a chocolate pre-made graham crust, a fool-proof and delicious recipe.  Might drizzle with caramel sauce for his birthday in 4 months....

This was a huge hit at our Thanksgiving dinner.  I made two changes by using an Oreo chocolate crust in place of the graham cracker and I spread peanut butter on the crust before adding the filling.  Will make again and again!

Quick, easy and so yummy! This has been my go to recipe for a couple years when we have guests over. I followed the recipe as exactly as written and it turned out perfect. Instead of making a pie shape desert I made individual cups. I bought clear plastic cups, filled them, placed in the fridge and dispersed when it was time for desert. Everyone enjoyed them. So simple too!

OK this was amazing! I made it with whipping cream instead of cool whip (a small carton worth) and boy was this delicious! The unsweetened whipping cream probably tampered down the sweetness some.  There were no Oreo crusts at our supermarket so I stuck with the prepared graham cracker crust. I am sure a homemade crust would have been even better but I did not want to heat up the oven on a hot day! I also wanted to keep this recipe easy. This was sinful and delicious. We ate it after freezing it 3 hours and refrigerating it 1 hour and then letting it sit at room temperature for at least a half hour. It was so good and very delicious the next two days. Its taste rewards you a lot for little effort! That's my kind of summer dessert! Although I might crave it in the cooler seasons too....

A delicious and easy recipe! I made this the other day for a Christmas potluck and everyone loved it. I did make one slight change and that was for the whipped cream. I used a half a pint of heavy whipping cream instead of the thawed whipped topping. I whipped it up until soft peaks had formed and folded it into the cream cheese mixture. I love how it's a no-bake recipe.

I was a little short on cream cheese, but it still turned out great.  Adding a layer of nutella to the bottom of the crust is a great touch.  I did make a homemade graham cracker crust which is definitely a plus..  You really do need to refrigerate for as long as possible before serving.  This pie is waaaay better a day (or even 2) later after it has had time to chill properly.  Couldn't be easier.

Very good and easy to make.  I will skip spreading the 1/4 c. Nutella first broke the crust apart.

Wow, this is delicious. Easy to make and taste great. Had my girlfriend over and 4 of my son's friends and gave rave reviews. Only had one piece left and my girl claimed it for later.

I've made this multiple times, the kids love it and it's fast.  I use an oreo pie crust.  Also use one whole extra 8 Oz container of Cool Whip on top of the pie to make it even lighter and a little less sweet, it helps offset all the chocolate.

I have made this pie twice now exactly to the recipe and I LOVE it. It's super easy and is a huge hit with everyone who has tried it, including my aunt who doesn't like Nutella. The filling is a mousse texture and not too sweet. You Also don't get an overwhelming hazelnut flavor, the cream cheese tones it down to a yummy chocolate with a hint of hazelnut. All in all, my new go-to recipe for church functions, holidays, pot lucks, etc.

So delicious!  Didn't change a thing.  Had some difficulty spreading the nutella on the crust without the crust coming apart...next time I will microwave the nutella for a few seconds before attempting to spread.

This was so easy to make and absolutely delicious! I used a graham cracker crust  and added chocolate chips over the crust - just to cut the sweetness a little!
I used Hersey's chocolate syrup to write "You Rock" on top of the pie. It was a really bad week and it made me smile when I saw it in the fridge. I'm still smiling even though my pie now just says "Yo".  

I added raspberries and served it on my fancy china (except for that one time I ate it over the sink)!

Perfect recipe name!! I'm on a charity committee that runs the Toronto Gutsy Walk for Crohn's and Colitis Canada and made this for our post walk wrap up meeting/BBQ and it was called "a hit" with requests for the recipe. It was so easy to make and because it's been so hot lately I was VERY happy that I didn't have to turn the oven on. I'll be making this again for sure!!

I've made this many times for family gatherings.  It disappears fast!  You never have to transport it home.  The only thing I do differently is that I don't bother putting a layer of Nutella on the crust.  Its so thick it breaks the crust.  I just put it all in the filling.

Made this for Thanksgiving. Was super easy. Hubby said it's one of his new favorites. I drizzled chocolate syrup on top just to make it pretty and used a chocolate graham cracker crust. Next time I'm using a Oreos crust!

I found this recipe on this site over a year ago.  I make it for many special occasions, to rave reviews.  I usually don't use the graham cracker crust.  I use Oreo or shortbread crust.  DEEELICIOUS!  So easy and honestly tastes like something you'd pay 6 bucks for in a fine food dining place.

Made this to recipe and it was wonderful. My Mother was the first to taste the pie and took a big piece. Due to how rich it was, she had trouble finishing.  

Will make this recipe in the future. The Oreo crust sounds good!

I made this for my mother's 80th birthday dinner, it was a huge hit!! I followed others suggestions & used chocolate graham cracker pie crust. I mixed the cream cheese, nutella & cool whip well & circled the top with small dots of canned whipped cream. Will definitely make this again, only negative was there were no left overs! ;)

I didn't spread the 1/4 cup hazelnut spread over the bottom, I just mixed all of it with the cream cheese/whipped topping mixture. I also used a chocolate cookie crust. This is always a big hit. People think I slaved over it, it's just that good! Squirt some whipped cream on it and top with mini chocolate chips.

Fabulous!  I used about 1/2 cup cream, that I whipped up.  Only added a little sugar to it so that I could control better how sweet the dessert was.  OMG- decadent and perfect! Like several others I used a chocolate crust.  Thank You Christina!  Perfect pie!

The pie was great! The only problem is spreading nutella on a graham cracker crust- it's impossible without tearing the crust up! But the taste was great.

It's really good. But I didn't let my cream cheese sit ling enough so when I mixed I had lumps. It tastes just like truffles. You could also make a peanut butter one and use peanut butter instead of Nutella it is great thanks for sharing

Love it!!! Made it for Valentine's Day and it was a hit. Super easy although a bit messy. Next time I would not spread Nutella on the crust, it is way too rich and it breaks the crust easily if not overly careful (maybe softening the Nutella might do the trick). Will be making this one again, and again, and again. Thanks!

First, I will have to say, I only used this as a guide, but it was a very nice start!  I used chocolate soynut butter and added some chocolate skim milk to thin it.  I put it over a brownie crust with some bananas layered into it.  Everyone enjoyed it so very much!  I will definitely try it with nutella as well, but I had the soynut butter to use up and my son absolutely loves soynut anything.  :)

I tried this and it was amazing. My strengths in life are not found in the kitchen but this is something that I could do with ease. It is super rich in flavor but it is a Nutella Cheescake.... So I didn't expect anything less.  It was fun to be able to truly make something for a lunch and have others rave about.. Yay!

I added peanut butter and used low fat cream cheese. It was great and easy to make.

I make this for holiday meals. It is a big hit with my kids. I will try adding the mini chips next time or mini m&m's.

This pie is fantastic! I too used a chocolate-cookie crust instead of graham cracker crust.  Next time, I will top it with additional whipped topping.
