This is an edit to my previous review - this recipe has been very well received by everyone who has eaten it. I have made it with peach jam which was too sweet and finally found the plum jam  - which was worth looking for - it really made the recipe. I have made it according to the directs, and I have made it as a layered casserole when I felt that stuffing the chicken would be to time intensive. It adapts well to a cardiac diet by using low fat/salt plain cornbread and turkey bacon. I stand by my recommendation that you use a savory cornbread - not a sweet cornbread for the stuffing. Overall a great dish!

Wow!  This dish was AMAZING!  I made it for my parents' Anniversary party a few weeks back and it was such a hit!  I put salt and pepper on the breasts before browning them, and added the garlic to the stuffing as suggested below. I think the plum jam really makes it, so I highly recommend it if you can find it. I just got it in the regular grocery store by the regular jam, but you might also try the Asian food isle. But here is a yummy update!  For Thanksgiving, try using turkey breasts instead of chicken, and cranberry preserves instead of plum jam – I did this last night and it was very very good – if you are just having a small Thanksgiving dinner for 2 or 4, why cook a whole bird?  Enjoy!

Easy, Delicious, & Quick! A nice twist on chicken!  Substituted the butter for olive oil...to the stuffing added half a minced clove of garlic and a tablespoon of minced fresh Italian parsley.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

This was super easy to make and very yummy. I did substitute apricot preserves for plum jam since we didn't have any in the house and I think it tasted great. I'll have to pick up some plum jam for the next time to see how that turns out.

Yum! I liked the idea of having a cornbread stuffed chicken and the stuffing is delicious. But the addition of the glaze overtop made this extra tasty. I did subsitute apricot jam for the plum and it was a great combo with the cornbread. My hubby said "definitely make this one again!". One comment, the glaze took about 10 mintues to cook down so plan ahead to have it ready for the chicken.

I made this for a friend who is allergic to corn, so instead of cornmeal, I used plain cooked couscous. It was fabulous. Next time I think I will try rice stuffing for a different take on this recipe.

This was incredibly delicious and very easy! My family was very impressed with the meal. Looking forward to changing things up with different jams/sauces. For this, I used a Plum Sauce I found in the Asian food aisle, as Plum Jam is out of season, and I'm sure it was just fine, because the final dish was absolutely amazing.

Simple and so very delicious.  I added 1/4 tsp. of dried thyme to the stuffing and stuffed the chicken prior to browning, then finished in the oven.  This is a keeper.  Thank you.

Okay so the only reason why the recipe got 4 out of 5 stars is b/c 1. I could not find plum jelly in my grocery store so I used tart cherry jelly mixed with orange marmalade...and 2. I don't like celery so I used celery seed. My boyfriend loved loved loved the stuffed chicken but he didn't have any of the sauce. I thought that it was okay... next time I will purchase boxed cornbread stuffing. I purchased already made cornbread and it was too sweet which clashed w/ the sweet sauce.

This recipe is amazing. plan and simple. I did not have any cellery, so I chopped up a little green bell pepper and it turned out wonderfully. I added a clove of fresh garlic, and one thing that I did do is i doubled the glaze. It made a wonderful sauce to have the chicken in and it made the chicken so moist. I will make this recipe again.

This is just so totally delicious. Thankfully I found the plum jam at Superwalmart. I baked Jiffy-brand cornbread in a medium sized muffin tin and used 2 of them which was plenty. Only change I made was that instead of cutting a hole in the chicken and stuffing...I just pounded out the chicken to 1/4 inch or so and put the stuffing in the middle and tucked the chicken around it. It is a technique that I am more comfortable with, and it worked out great with none of the stuffing cooking out. Next time I will just spoon the plum jam on top once the chicken is done instead of pouring it in the baking dish.  That resulted in an unpleasant pinkish color to the chicken, which made it hard to tell if it was done or not. I will make this dish over and over, it is truely excellent!!

Instead of stuffing the chicken breasts, I cut them into bite-size pieces and dipped them in celery seed and minced onion. Then I put them in a baking dish with chicken stock & let sit in refrigerator. Then I discarded the chicken stock and added a little butter to the baking dish and cooked, adding the plum/stock mixture for the last 10 minutes. It smelled, looked, and tasted great!!

I thought this was a delicious and different twist on chicken. After making this with skinless chicken - I think I would try it next time with skin-on chicken breast to add more flavor and texture with the plum glaze.  The stuffing turned out well, I sauteed the onion and celery with the bacon to bring softness to the vegetables.  I placed the finished chicken breast on top of a bed of sauteed spinach.  The spinach, dressing and chicken combined to make one tasty meal!

Very good.  Bought a lot of plums one week & mostly everyone went away for a few days.  Plums were going to go bad, so I cut them in half, took out the pits, put them in the oven with a little brown sugar.  Baked at 350 for 20 min.  Cooled & then froze them.  Took out 6 halves, defrosted them, mashed them with a little honey & used this for the jam.  I do this with any fruit and use all of them in a lot of recipies.

My teenage boys said this was the best meal I have ever made!  Served it with white rice which was great with the glaze.  The breasts seemed too thin to slit and stuff, so I wrapped the breasts around the stuffing and tied them up with twine.

Our family all really liked this recipe. The only problem I had was that I couldn't find plum jam!  So, I used apricot like someone else had suggested, and it was still good.  I would like to try it with plum jam if I can find it.  Does anybody know where to get it?

This was fabulous!!  I loved it, and it was worth the time it took to make it.  Although it took me about 2 hours from start to finish because I had to cook the cornbread, and bacon in addition to this recipe because I wasn't fully prepared.  If your fully prepared then enjoy, it's an amazing fall meal.

This was a fantastic dish.  My entire family loved it.  I think the plum glaze and cornbread work perfectly.  Wouldn't change a thing.  I did have to do some guess work with the cornbread amount and chicken stock.  But, I made the recipe for 6 and it came out great.  Will definitely be making again!

I made this for my husband for the first time, and it was a huge hit, definitely company worthy. I did use the plum and glad I did, because everything else would have been too sweet. The plum gave it such an excellent balance. The stuffing was delicious and the bacon give a wonderful touch. I found it not only easy to prepare, but quickl.  DELICOUS!!!!!!!!

Made this for my 88 year old aunt and 87 year old Mom for Christmas Dinner.  Cut the recipe in half and still had lots extra for next day dinner at work.  Simple, good and quick.  Had lots of dressing left.  Great presentation and mild flavor.

This was quite good.  My husband really enjoyed the sweet and savory aspect.  I added a little diced serrano pepper and the tiny bit of spice was nice with the bacon.  Also, my cornbread had gone moldy already so I had to make breadcrumbs out of some stale rosemary and olive oil bread.  I might try the cornbread, but this was awfully good, so i don't know.  the only thing i would do differently next time is make the pocket in the chicken bigger so that there would be fewer bites of just baked chicken.  will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe with a couple of modifications.  I used pork loin chops and a box of pork stuffing mix.  The use of the stuffing mix cut the preparation time.  The dish was very tasty and my husband requested that I definitely keep the recipe to make this again.  Quick, easy and tasty!

This dish was fantastic.  It looks gourmet and tastes that way, but really does not take too much time to prepare.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I used an apricot/peach preserve for the glaze.  Everyone at my little dinner party really loved it and I would definitely make this again!

This recipe is fantastic! I recommend using a plum sauce without tomato paste listed in the ingredients. It comes out beautifully and oh-so-tasty. I will make this again and again!

This recipe was awesome.Since cornbread stuffing is a seasonal thing I used a boxed chicken stuffing and added three cornbread squares, that I made, to the mixture. You can use more or less to your taste(my husband says more). I could not find the plum jelly so I substitued apricot jam (about 1/4 of the jar) and added 5 prunes chopped up to the mixture while it reduced on the stove. This is a keeper.

I stumbled upon this recipe as I was about to try another recipe as I was reading the reviews to see how others made their version of it more interesting. I really liked the idea of using the jam, good idea and delicious too. Thanks for sharing the tip. One viewer wanted to know where to find plum jam...go to and Indo-Pakistani or mideastern market, they have a variety of jams and chutneys, thats where I go for odd-food finds.

This was excellent.  I made this tonight for my father's birthday party for 6 people.  I used the large boneless chicken breasts with the rib meat to cut a better "pocket."  I made 4 times the stuffing and put the extra around the chicken once it was stuffed.  I did all the prep work yesterday and since I had to fry 8 pieces of bacon, I saved the grease and use that to brown the chicken.  I found the plum jam in the international aisle at the grocery store, it was actually in the Polish section.

This was very good! A nice change to baked chicken. I never made stuffing before, can you believe that! And I did for the first time with this recipe and it was great! The plum glaze kind of taste like bbq sauce to me. It was really good. Got it from Walmart right where the other jellies were. All the way on the bottom shelf. I added more seasoning than salt and pepper. Other than that doubled the recipe and it turned out good. Used 1 box of Jiffy for 4 big chicken breast and about 6 slices of bacon. Oh yeah and I used the whole jar of jam and added chicken stock accordingly. We like extra sauce around here. Husband approved of this meal. Thank you

My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe.  I had more stuffing than would fit inside the chicken breast so I baked the stuffed breast on a bed of stuffing and it made a lovely presentation on the plate with steamed broccoli florets.  I am looking forward to making this again.

LOVED it. But, I am not so great at presentation so my chicken breasts weren't really stuffed. Instead the corn bread stuffing (which was fantastic!) was on top of, underneath and around the chicken breasts. The family was delighted, so this is a keeper for sure.

This recipe was delicious...Easy for making if you have company over.  I have four kids so I always look for things that can be done earlier.  I always cook up a few packs of bacon and then freeze..i can use them for anything.  I made corn bread muffins and used three for this and zip locked them in a freezer bag for the next time.  Could not find plum jam but did find something in another language which I could not read but it had pictures of plums on it and was in the jam section. Just translated it now..its plum butter..worked great and tasted good.  Also added red pepper and thyme from my garden.  yummy

This was awesome!  I doubled this so we could have leftovers and I took the extra stuffing and topped the chicken with it before drizzling the plun glaze. YUM!

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner, which is one I *always* try to show off for, and it was a HUGE hit.  My father in law called it the best white meat chicken he'd ever had.  I made the glaze from Prosciutto Wrapped Chicken instead, since cranberries just seemed a little more Christmasy, and it worked beautifully.  I loved this stuffing so much I wound up making it (slightly modified) instead of my mom's traditional recipe on Christmas day!  I will definitely be making this again.

This was very easy and pretty good.  I used blackberry jam since I couldn't find plum.  I will definately spice up the breasts prior to sauteing.

I decided to make this recipe because I had two leftover corn muffins I didn't want to go to waste. I can't wait to make it again, this is  the best chicken recipe ever. As someone else suggested I used apricot preserves because that's what I had on hand.

Oh my gosh.  This was so good and my boyfriend thought so too!  Excellent.  I didn't change anything except for I put minced garlic instead of onions because I hate onions.  Also I seasoned the breasts with Season All before sauteing.  Thanks!  This one was better than a lot of those recipes who have 300 five star ratings!

Excellent dish. Make the stuffing ahead of time, and get the sauce going as it takes more time than you think.  I pounded down the chicken, put the stuffing on top after browning both sides of the chicken, then folded the chicken over, used tooth pics, then baked it.  Came out perfect.    I used 2 jiffy boxed muffins and  bought the Smuckers red plum jam on Walmart.com and picked it up at the store.  It was the only place to get it.  I also doubled the sauce!!!
      I would like to make this ahead of time to take to a party. But it would cool off.  Any ideas how to make this in a layered or casserole form?

Could not find plum jam so had to improvise. by using a apricot, peach and passion fruit jam.  My dinner guest didn't think she would care for the mixture but she keep going back for more sauce.  I still would like to try it with the plum jam but this was wonderful.

I've made this a few times now.  Can't find the plum jam in my store so I've made it with apricot and strawberry.  Very tasty...this recipe is a keeper.

Ohmygosh, sooooo good and sooooo easy.  I skipped sauteing and just stuffed & baked the chicken breasts 30 minutes covered then 10 minutes uncovered, then glazed and continued as written.  Next time I might chop up a bit of jalapeno pepper to give the stuffing a little kick.

I made this recipe for my family for my very first dinner party. It was a huge hit! Everyone loved it, it was easy to make for a beginner cook. I did follow some other reviewers recommendations for the stuffing. I am definitely making this again. My mother even asked to swap recipes!!!

This was so good! I did use stove top instead of the suggested stuffing mixture becuase i had it on hand. I also added a little white wine to the plum sauce. I seasoned the chicken with dried garlic and onion flakes to give it a little seasoning while baking. My boyfriend loved it!
