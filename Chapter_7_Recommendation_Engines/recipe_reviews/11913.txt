You can make this REALLY fast and easy by using jarred sauce and putting the frozen ravioli right into the oven.  I used 2 jars of sauce, 1 1/2 packages of ravioli, covered it in foil and increased the baking time (I think close to 50 minutes) I uncovered for the last 10 minutes and topped with the cheese.  Thanks so much for a great idea!

I used jarred sauce to save time and made 2 layers of sauce ravioli and cheese. Very quick and tasty.

My family liked this, although other reviews are right, it tastes a lot like lasagna.  I used a 9 oz package of fresh ravioli and made 1/4 of the sauce.  This was perfect for the three of us and even had enough left over for my daughter and I to have for lunch today.  I would like to try this with meat ravioli next time.  I think it would make an interesting combination.  Also, if anyone is wondering I don't see why you can't use jarred sauce to save time.  I made the sauce as directed.  It was good, but nothing spectacular.

I had a huge bag of ravioli I wanted to use up-and this was such a nice change of pace.  The sauce itself-I used 2 cans diced tomatoes and two huge cans of crushed tomatoes-that's all I had on hand.  I sauteed the onion and garlic in 3 tbs olive oil on low heat for 10 minutes and added in fresh basil and parsley from my garden.  I then poured in all the sauce and added salt, pepper and a handful of parmesan cheese.  After that simmered for 2 hours-I cooked the ravioli and gently mixed in some sauce.  I spread sauce on bottom of pan and did ravioli, parmesan cheese, mozz cheese, more ravioli, sauce, parmesan cheese and mozz cheese as my layers.  I baked covered for 30 minutes and removed cover for last 10 minutes to get a nice top.  My husband thought it was a cool idea to make a ravioli lasagna!

For just us two people, I used an 8 x 8 pan, put jarred sauce in bottom of pan, frozen ravioli on top, fresh mushrooms sliced on top, sprinkled w/italian cheeses, repeated the ravioli and rest of jarred sauce mixed w/1 8-oz can of tomato sauce and then finished it with the shredded cheeses on top.  Covered tightly in tin foil and let sit out for 1 hour to give the uncooked frozen ravioli a ""thawing start. Cooked in a preheated 400 degree oven for 35-40 minutes, uncovered, and then turned oven off as it "cooked" another 5-10 minutes - so awesome - served with garlic bread.  There were some leftovers for hubby's lunch next day!:)  He said it was "even better" after re-heating in microwave at work!

Excellent recipe! I've made this a few times now, sometimes I use italian tomatoes, sometimes regular. I prefer the petite-cut type. My husband has requested I make this marinara sauce for all future pasta dishes, so I jarred up a big batch. He prefers the sauce with meat in it. My 7-year-old stepdaughter got to help make the sauce after asking me if chopping onions really makes people cry! A very easy recipe that makes the house smell heavenly. I use little or no water but my leftovers are a little dry; next time I'll go ahead and add all the water.

I thought this was very good.  I followed the recipe except I cooked the onions and garlic in butter for a few minutes until soft then added the other ingrediants. I also took about 1 cup of cottage cheese, mixed one very small egg and then used this for a layer in the casserole.  Then completed as stated.  I thought it added a nice touch.  Next time I may try some Ricotta cheese instead of the cottage.  Just happened to have the cottage on hand.

This is a great meal for when you're in a bit of a hurry, and it would be even quicker - and I'm sure nearly as good - to make it with jarred spagetti sauce. The only thing I did differently was to sautee the onions before continuing with the recipe. We enjoyed it. Thanks, Pati!

Great, easy recipe although I cheated quite a bit!  For the amount of ravioli listed in the recipe I used nearly two 28 ounce jars of organic store bought pasta sauce instead of making the sauce in the recipe.  I also used 3 cups of a four cheese blend (including asiago, provolone, mozzarella and parmesan).  I mixed the cooked ravioli with the sauce in a large bowl first before placing everything into the baking pan (I wanted the ravioli thoroughly coated with sauce).  I poured half of the ravioli mixture into the baking pan and sprinkled on about 1 cup of cheese then topped with remaining ravioli and cheese.  This recipe makes alot - I used a 15x10 inch pyrex baking pan.  Great dish to serve on a cold winter day!

I thought this was wonderful. I made a slightly different homemade marinara, and cooked this entree in a smaller dish so the ravioli was layered about 4 times. Delicious!

What a dissapointment! Not "zesty" enough! Tasted like tomatoes and a lot of cheese -- the baked cheese on top was excellent, but still didn't save it! IF I do this again I'll use my own spaghetti sauce (if not I'd at least add a pound of Italian sausage!) I also used fresh four-cheese ravioli instead of frozen.

This was not that good for how long it took.  It is like lasagna, but a nice change with raviolis.  It would've been better with mushrooms, spinach, and bell peppers (I was out of them all).  It just really needs something else.  Sorry, but I don't think I'll be making this again.

All three of my kids liked this.  My husband who usually doesn't like this "kind" of dinner, and was a little unimpressed by the recipe, loved it!  Thanks for a tasty meal.

I was disappointed.  I didn't change anything with the recipe, but found it to be lacking.  The family said it was "okay."   Doubt I will make this recipe again, but rather try another variation of it.

Very tasty! Wonderful red sauce recipe that I will definitely use for other things. I put the red sauce in the blender to puree it smooth. Wonderful 'zing' and very kid friendly recipe.

I cut this recipe in half. I did not use the sauce recipe, I instead used the recipe from Enhance That Jar of Spaghetti Sauce, which is also from this site. I layered this like I would lasagna. One whole Walmart brand ravioli was just enough for a 8x8 pan. I started with the sauce, did a layer of ravioli, then a layer of faux ricotta (cottage cheese, parmesan cheese, egg, dried parsley) and I just repeated the layers and ended with the parmesan cheese. Everyone enjoyed it. Great way to make dinner with pantry/freezer items and lighten the food budget.

I just realized I never reviewed this, even though I make often when needing to make a simple, QUICK and DELICIOUS dinner. I like to serve with a green salad with a creamy dressing, and garlic toast.

I was looking for something different to take to our church Christmas party, which had an Italian theme.  I made this the night before and reheated it before the party.  It was a hit!  Very good!  I wasn't going to follow the recipe for the sauce but I'm so glad I did.  It was fun to make but even more fun to eat!  The only thing I did differently was that I tossed the Ravioli in some butter before putting in into the pan and adding the sauce and cheese.  Butter makes everything better!!!

I made this last night with a few additions- I cooked up some mushrooms, zucchini, peppers and onions as well as some italian style chicken sausage (2 pieces cut up). I then used a jar of pasta sauce I had on hand as well as some fresh garlic.  I tossed it with the ravioli and topped with the two cheeses. It smelled amazing and tasted great!

OMG--How easy this is. I made this for Christmas Dinner. I read the recipe just once and assembled it from memory. I made my own version for the spaghetti sauce. I have to be honest and say i DID make one mistake I forgot to cook the ravioli's I just thawed them and assembled. I was somewhat doughie but a BIG hit.  I will never again spend an hour making lasagne the old way, this way is a cinch and you have the same results. Next time i will remember to par boil the ravioli's though.

This recipe could not be better!  I made it the first time for a special dinner for my husband and I and we both took one bite and just melted.  It is honestly the best pasta dish I have ever had, whether in a 5 star restaurant or at home.  I also made this for my husband's family and they devoured it, talked about how good it was all night, then sent me thank notes later in the week!  The best part of this is it's SO easy!  I serve it with garlic focaccia bread and I've never been disappointed!  I give this recipe to everyone who will take it!

I've made this recipe twice.  The first time, I added one small can of tomato paste and also ground beef to the sauce.  It was okay, but reminded me more of lasagna than ravioli.  The second time I made this, I didn't change anything about the recipe.  It was terrible!  Neither my husband nor I could eat it and we had to go pick up some fast food instead!

Excellent, served for guests and everyone loved it, even the picky children.  Takes time to simmer but the sauce thickens perfectly and tastes great.  Thank you!

Yum!  My whole family enjoyed this!  Big hit with the kids and my hubby and super easy.  Sauce was delicious but like the fact that in a hurry, I can just use jarred sauce.  The mozz cheese burnt by the time it was done, so I will add that at the end next time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

2 stars is very generous for this recipe.  It was very bland and I'm sure the garbage disposal was just as disappointed as we were.  I will never make this again or even bother trying to change it.

I use my own meat sauce, but I'm sure it would be delicious with jarred sauce, too.  Very good - like lasagna without the work!

5 star rating based on what I did:  First, I halved the recipe since it's just me and my 3 year-old.  I sauteed the onions in olive oil to soften then proceeded with the rest of the sauce.  I did not add the water and only simmered for 30 minutes but let it sit on the stove for 2 hours.  Why add water just to simmer it out?  I added 1 T of brown sugar to the sauce to cut down on the acidity.  I chose to use beef filled ravioli rather then the cheese since it has so much cheese on top.  Over all I think this is a great recipe and I loved the chunkiness of the sauce.

This was a great recipe that i tried tonight!  I have made stuffed jumbo shells before quite a bit and this is similar, but a great mix-up on italian food.  I halved the recipe because it's just the two of us and it stilled filled up an 8-1/2 by 11 pan!  I omitted the onions and added crushed red peppers which gave it a little more kick!

Very good! The family ate it all up:) I didn't realize that I was supposed to let it simmer for 2 hrs. till right before I made it and it was already 5:30pm so I ended up letting it simmer for 30 min and it turned out fine. We will make this again for sure!

This was really good.  I made it for a meatless dinner without much hope that I could make three picky kids and a picky husband enjoy it.  Amazingly everyone liked it!  It was very cheesey and filling.  Will definitely make again.

I made my sauce the way I usually do and added olives, other than that I followed the recipe.  It was really good, exactly what I expected (and not like the lasagna I make, that's packed with veggies).  Definitely worth it if don't feel like doing much cooking.

Can't comment on the sauce because as written, it didn't appeal to me, so I made my own. However, the concept was great not to mention, quick and very easy. Family enjoyed this very much and thank you!

This turned out very good.  Hubby is at the Sox game  so I thought it would be a nice change up for the kids (teens) and they really liked it.  I used artichoke cheese ravioli and added some extra spices as well as brown sugar to the sauce to take away the "acidity" from the tomatoes.  Other than that....well it being like lasagna....hello isn't ravioli like little lasagna's to begin with?  This was much easier than lasagna, and it satisified the picky daughter that I have.Good easy recipe and thanks Pati!

Very filling meal.  One problem I had was the sauce was a little bit too much.  It spilled all over my oven =(  Next time I'll cut back on sauce.  Otherwise, very good.

This was a great recipe!  Although I made changes I don’t think it distracts from the fact that it’s a great idea and how versatile it can be!  I used a jar of Alfredo sauce I had instead and spinach.  My family loved it. I will be making this again!

I made this exactly how the recipe asks to only thing I changed was the Italian mix. I didn't have any so I used a menudo mix which turned out so good. This recipe is so good! My children love to eat the sauce by itself with crackers. I will be adding this recipe to my go tos thank you so much.

It did not fit in my 13x9 pan as directed which resulted in a huge mess all over my oven. Tasted bland despite my additional garlic, herbs and spices. If I try this again I might brown some Italian Sausage to add a little protein/additional flavor.

I've had this recipe in my box for over 10 years now so glad to have finally tried it. Very good. I recommend making the sauce because it was the perfect consistency and kept the pasta from drying out.

Yum. Added thawed spinach in middle layer, used a jarred marinara sauce. Liked the idea that it can be prepped early and baked later. Halved the recipe for our family of 4.

There was nothing particularly wrong with this recipe, just that it was nothing exciting. My boyfriend threw out half his plate and I've pretty much never seen him do that before. Then again, we aren't huge ravioli fans. I don't think I'll make this again.

This recipe was Ok but after making it by the directions it was dry so i ended up putting in a jar of Spaghetti sauce to make it moist then it was alot better i don't think i'll be making it this way again

Sauce did not turn out so I ended up using jarred sauce (I don’t know what I did wrong). End result, very good, very cheesy. I will be making it again. Maybe I will give the sauce another try. Thanks for the recipe!!

The redeeming part of this dish was the cheese (I added a lot more than called for). Otherwise this was mediocre. Threw a bunch away. Won't be making again.

I would definitely add more spices to the sauce next time, maybe some premade pesto or something - it just didn't impress me that much.  I might make it again...

Easy recipe.  It came out a little salty, not sure if that was because I salted the ravioli water.  I also thought that there was a little too much sauce for the amount of ravioli.

I was not impressed with the sauce.  I will continue to make the sauce my own way with lots of different spices and a little brown sugar.

Worth the long prep time of simmering the sauce...I did add alot of extra spices however due to personal preference. this was simple and yet a good change to either regular ravioli or lasanga, I might try adding some ground beef or italian sausage to the mix next time or just buying meat ravoli...over all a good recipie

My family liked this a lot.  The sauce seemed a little runny--maybe don't add the water.
