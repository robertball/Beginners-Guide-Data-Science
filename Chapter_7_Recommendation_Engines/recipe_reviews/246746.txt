I made the curry exactly as written, and while it is a very close approximation to real Japanese curry it fell short in two areas. 

First, the final product was substantially thicker than it should have been and ladled over the rice,  the result was something closer to risotto in consistency than curry over rice.

Second, the flavor was familiar to the curry I was used to in Japan, but it was blander.

The best part of this recipe is how easy it was to fix at the table. All it it took was a tablespoon of salt and a can of chicken broth the next day and the flavor and consistency were fixed. It was at least as good if not better than SB box curry.

I am definitely making this again!

We just move back to the states from Japan and we missed our Japanese Curry, this recipe is pretty much spot on for Japanese Curry. I left out the Chicken and added mushrooms because Japanese Curry only uses vegetables, other than that I followed the recipe to the letter and it was fantastic.

Iâ€™m insanely lazy, so I cheated and used pre made curry powder with additional spices I had in my pantry to own it. I also used parsnips and turnips instead of potatoes and Granny Smith Apple instead of gala. It definitely is better than the roux blocks.
