It was too cold out for grilling, so I baked this in a covered casserole dish @ 400 for about 40 min. Yum!

The first time I made this I used the white sugar as it suggests.  The second time I made it I used brown sugar and it was MUCH better.  This is now one of my favorites!!!  It's super yummy!

Got rave reviews on this.  I started with two large Granny Smith apples, peeled and thinly sliced.  In a large bowl I sprinkled them with juice of one lemon to keep them fresh.  I then peeled and thinly sliced three yams and mixed with the apples.  I added a healthy sprinkle of salt and ground pepper along with about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, two tbls of brown sugar, 1 tsp of white sugar and about a 1/4 cup of melted margarine.  I tossed all together and put into casserole dish and tightly covered. Baked at 350 for about an hour.  Very, very good and really easy.

I lightened this up a bit... I used half the butter and only a couple tablespoons of sugar. It might be a 5 star if I used all the butter but I wanted to keep it as healthy as possible. Next time I will add another apple or maybe use half apples half sweet potatoes because the apples were the yummiest part!

I paired these with the Chinese Pork Chops on the barbeque.  Turned out great and the kids liked them.  I substituted brown sugar for white.

1 Gala Apple & 1 large sweet potato. Convection 375 degrees 30 minutes in foil line and foil covered pan. Made enough for 2 very hungry adults(2 servings each)  had about 1/2c leftover. Delicious!

DIVINE! Throw in some dried cranberries and I just found a new Christmas/Thanksgiving tradition with this recipe! My husband was raving about the dish and he doesn't even like sweet potatoes! I made this as a side with some tasty grilled salmon, yumm! Excellent dish that is sure to become a favorite in our home.

Great recipe, however I suggest adding another apple. I only put a pat of butter in each foil packet, probably used only 2 T total, 1/2 C. is excessive. Will try with brown sugar next time. Make sure to keep turning these as they will burn if left on one side for too long. Cooking time is also too long, I would only grill for 30 mins. Thanks for the recipe.

Nice side dish for a spicy entree.  I used a Granny Smith apple and brown sugar.  Instead of grilling, I put everything in an 8x8 baking dish and baked it at 400* for 40 minutes (30 min. covered, 10 min. uncovered).  Served with Grilled 'Fusion' Pork Chops.

Good simple recipe.  I used only one potatoe and was certainly enough for wife and I.  Jazzed it up a bit by tossing apples and potatoes in about a shot of Grand Marnier (1.5 to 2oz) and loved it. Went great with the grilled pork tenderloin and spinach salad with fresh strawberries and a vinegrette dressing.  Next time I think I'll try Amaretto.

I read the reviews and used brown sugar, drastically cut back butter and used olive oil. I have to admit I was going to omit the apples, sooo glad I did not. Great flavor, fast and easy, to make, to eat and clean up. This one goes in the purple notebook. Thanks

I have made these on the grill and baked in the oven, everyone loves them. Because we have a diabetic in the family, we leave out the sugar and used organic coconut oil instead of butter sooo good and still so sweet :)

These were pretty good.  I loved the apples. I used brown sugar and replaced the butter with a few tablespoons of olive oil; tossed it all together in a big bowl. I felt like it was missing something... probably salt, maybe it needed more spice. My kids weren't too happy with this recipe, they wanted more of a pumpkin pie flavor.

This was YUMMY! I didn't have any apples so I tossed in some applesauce and also used brown instead of white sugar.  I also microwaved the potato slices until they were slightly tender to cut down on the grilling time.

Excellent flavor, however, cooking time was way off. Cooked for 25 min and some pieces were burnt. Turned every 5 min. Next time will turn every 3.

This was good but I would cut the butter/oil in 1/2 next time. Sweet potatoes have so much flavor they don't need the grease. I baked it in the oven for 30 min covered and 15 min uncovered and it came out perfectly.

Cooked it in the oven. I used coconut oil instead of butter to make it dairy-free. It tasted like pie without the crust!

I 'followed' the recipe using 2 sweet potatoes and 1 apple but I only spilt my mixture into 2 foil packs instead 4. We grilled them for about 20 minutes (same time it took to grill our chicken) and they were perfect! I took the suggestion from another reviewer and added dried cranberries - yum! I will definately make these again - especially for my vegetarian mother in law and vegan sister in law.

This was really easy to make and delicious.  I used both brown and white sugar.  I also added more butter, nutmeg, vanilla and a little pineapple juice leftover from another recipe.  I like my potatoes really sweet, so the additions helped kick it up a notch.

Very tasty recipe. The directions for the cinnamon and sugar are a little vague (it's hard to know how much to use as you can't really taste it at that stage.) I think brown sugar would actually add more depth of flavor to this dish, but it was delicious as stated.

I did not enjoy this at all. Maybe I did something wrong since I am a beginner to the cooking world. When adding the butter I couldn't believe how much it called for. I will not be making this again.

Holy Cow were these great!  Ended up cooking them partially on the grill and then partially in the oven after I accidentally punctured the foil wrapping and they started leaking and ... oh never mind.  I have spent 40 years saying I don't like sweet potatoes until now.  My hubby and the 6 & 8 year olds in the house gobbled them up.  Finished them off with a dollup or two of fluff and there wasn't a leftover to be had. Did use brown sugar though instead of regular. A keeper for sure that will now be made over and over! THANKS!

Very tasty and easy!  My husband and I gobbled them right up! I also used brown sugar instead of regular sugar just because that's usually what you put with sweet potatoes!

I love sweet potatoes and I love apples but... I don't know if I love them together. These tasted wonderful if you dont mind combining the two flavors. Takes the apples longer to cook than the SP's so one will either be a bit crisp or a bit mushy.

YUM! I love to camp and always looking for good additions to meals or to have as a dessert. I mixed in a ziplock bag, vs needing to bring along another bowl while we camp. Limited space in a tent. I will make these at home as well as camping OFTEN!

Fiance said these were the best sweet potatoes he ever had. I'm not a fan of sweet potatoes but they tasted pretty good. The apples were excellent too! I used a mixture of cinnamon sugar that you can find in the spice section at grocery store--but you can make your own mix at home. 1 part cinnamon 1 part sugar. Excellent recipe!

I made this today with my grilled steaks for lunch. The recipe is kind of open ended, so it's hard to rate on the seasonings. After reading a couple reviews, I went with 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and I eyeballed the brown sugar.  I used 2 tablespoons of butter in each pack and split the potatoes into 3 packets. I use 1 large Macintosh Apple and wished I had used 2. I started the packets in the oven because the grill was pretty full and only had the packets on the grill for about 10 minutes as the steaks came off. Overall a very nice change from the usual grill vegetables and very tasty. Thanks for the idea!  Next time I want to grill longer to caramelize the sugar a bit more.

I was in a bit of a rush, so I hurried the sweet potatoes along by microwaving them for four minutes on high before adding the rest of the ingredients.   I made one large packet and tossed the contents occasionally with my tongs.  This isn’t the prettiest side dish but it was easy and tasty.

My review is for the recipe itself and not for the taste.  The taste of cinnamon apples is delicious and so is the taste of sweet potatoes with brown sugar.  Hence the combination of both. Yum!  Thank you to the person who provided the idea to even try this in a grill.  That being said, there's no specification of measurements nor what type of apple to us and so this is more of an idea for your interpretation.  I personally used a gala apple which is what I had on hand but I feel it would have been better with a tart apple such as granny smith.  I used brown sugar instead and mind the sugar due to the sweetness of the potato and apple.  For other comments using salt i snot necessary as the butter is already salty.  It was also missing a bit of something like maybe nuts on top before serving.

These were delicious! I only used about half the butter (couldn't bring myself to use that much for a side dish) and I used about 1.5 tablespoons of sugar and almost a teaspoon of cinnamon (the directions were quite vague on this part). I'll be making these again for sure.

Love this! I nuked my sweet potatoes for 4 mins then sliced them with the skin on 1/2 thick. I cored and quartered the apple, tossed it in lemon juice then tossed it with the Sweet P. and aprox 4 packets of Truvio sweetner and cinnamon mixed together. Last, I topped the dish with about 2 tbs of melted butter, placed it in a baking dish with foil cover and baked at 350 for 35 mins. Excellent dish!

Very yummy, but quite sweet (needs to be paired with something savoury).  I replaced the white sugar with raw cane sugar or brown sugar, and used a peach as well that needed to be used.

Very good!  Even my picky 4 yr old liked this.  My only problem is that the recipe does not specify amounts for cinnamon & sugar.  The amount you add could really make a difference how this turns out. 

Just made this again - this time used brown sugar & thought it was even better.   I made it with the Chipolte Crusted Pork Tenderloin from this site.  YUM!

Easy. We used raw brown sugar & it was great. This can be used as a side dish or a dessert. If using as a dessert maybe put a scoop of cinnamon or french vanilla ice cream.

It was ok, but I am partial to sweeter sweet potatoes, so this was a bit different for me!

These sweet potatoes were a great side dish for steak.  I left the apples out, but I am sure it would be good with those as well.  Just be careful that the foil has no tears in it and won't leak once the butter and sugar heat up, I had a flaming packet on the grill!  I will make this recipe again!

Wonderful change from whipped sweet potatoes and marshmellows!  I made this for my in-laws; I got so many compliments on them.  I added a little brown sugar to the mix as well.

Yum! I used one small sweet potato and one medium apple, 1/2 tbsp of margarine and a generous sprinkling of cinnamon. No sugar. I put it in a covered saucepan on medium/medium low heat until the sweet potato was tender, stirring occasionally. I ate it all for breakfast.

I cooked this recipe in the oven covered with Alu foil for 1hr... the apple became so soft that I had to take them out to serve.. also I found that there was no real ‘plus’ from the apple .. better simply cook the potatoes with butter and brown sugar like I used to ..

Really tasty!  Did it in a couple of casserole dishes in the oven using the directions from previous reviewers.  Cooked it a little longer (probably around 50 minutes).  Used brown sugar and also added cranberries. Everyone seemed to like it for Xmas eve dinner.

Delicious side dish and easy to put together. I had some sweet potatoes and apples I wanted to use up without having to heat up the house. Made exactly as written and the potatoes and apples were cooked perfectly. The only change I'd make is to use brown sugar instead of white next time. Served with a smoked pork tenderloin. This recipe will be a repeat at home and on cabin/camping trips! Thanks for the recipe!

AWESOMENESS!!!!  Kids that typically don't eat sweet potatoes-loved this...and so did I.  I typically don't do reviews, but this one deserves a review.  Followed recipe (except brown sugar)here are my portions-used 2 small Granny Smith apples and 2T.brown sugar and about 1T of the cinnamon.  Loved this..will definitely be making again to change up this previously only white potato family.  Thanks for sharing!!!!!

My husband raved about this recipe. I did not change anything; tasted great.  It will certainly be a regular on our grill list.  If I'm feeling adventurous, I might try brown sugar as other reviewers have. I would rather try and review a recipe as written before I make changes.

Pretty good base recipe, I turned the foils into "pockets"- using two equal sized pieces of foil, and rolling together all sides of each pocket, could also be used over a fire for camping food. Next time I will not use white sugar, but throw in a hefty portion of brown sugar, and cinnamon. Add a few marshmallows and you have a campfire/ grillout sweet potato casserole.

It was awesome, everyone loved it (except for my picky brother who wouldn't try it because he doesn't like sweet potatoes for some odd reason), and we don't have a grill. Also, it's winter so even if we did, it would be too cold out. We set the sweet potatoes and apples in a frying pan on top of the stove, covered them up with foil (so they would hopefully cook faster), and everything else we did the same! This turned out delicious, thank you for the recipe! :D!

Not bad.  I baked in the oven.  Didn't expect so much juice.  Next time I will toss ingredients with addition of corn starch to thicken juice a little, much in the way apple pie is made.  Seems a bit of clove and mace/nutmeg would help as well.

These were very good even though I forgot to add the butter. I can only imagine how good they'll taste the next time when I remember to add it. Like another reviewer said, watch them carefully! They burn easily.

This was very good, would make again, just a little sweet. Would add some marshmellows and nuts for a more traditional flavor next year.
