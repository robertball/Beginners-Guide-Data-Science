This dessert has a nice flavor and is  light and fluffy, however, we were not impressed enough to make it again. Thank you, Beth, for submitting the recipe.

The recipe turned out great as written, and I made sure to use heavy cream because it is WAY healthier than cool whip.

This recipe was so easy and tasted AMAZING! I used an 8oz carton of cool whip in place of the heavy cream, which I think made it fluffier, lighter, and healthier. Thank you Beth I will definitly make this again!

Very easy to make and very tasty. However, my kids didn't like it and the hubby refused to even try it because it's "not cherry pie".
I thought it was pretty good.
