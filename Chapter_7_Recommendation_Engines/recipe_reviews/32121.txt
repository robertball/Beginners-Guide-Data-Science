This recipe was great. As the recipe indicates it is spicy. Not for the faint of heart, but then again if you are a spice wimp, you probably aren't going to attempt a recipe called spicy rice to begin with :) 
Someone commented on the lack of flavor, I thought it had excellent flavor. I did add some minced garlic to the step where the onion and vegetables are sauteed, and also seasoned this step with salt and pepper. As for the seasoning of the meat, we used the recommended season salt for the chicken and added some pepper, but used garlic salt and pepper for the beef. The meat had excellent flavor and was very tender.
My only "beef" with the recipe is that it seemed to take much longer to prepare than it states. It is a very easy recipe, not strenuous, but the step where the rice is supposed to brown alone in the pan seems to take longer than anticipated. The rice is/was slightly mushy as well. Not sure why that was. It still had excelled flavor, and that would not stop us from making the recipe again.

This recipe was okay. The entire family ate it but no one was enthused about it. It is a good meal to feed around 7-12 people.

This was great! I substituted by adding five jalapeno and some garlic and deleting the meat.

I loved it!  But everyone else said that it needed more salt.

I liked  this a lot- although I found it a bit spicy- my husband thought  it was great.  I couldn't find a habanero pepper so I substituted a jalapeno instead.  I use my pampered chef food chopper so it didn't take long to prep for this recipe!  I thought it was quick and easy.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

My husband and I really liked this rice.  We love spicy food and most things I have made off this website have not been spicy enough for us.  I didn't add sirloin only chicken and halved the recipe, but I can't wait to make this as a side for Christmas Dinner.  Thanks Heather

This was not so great.  Too hot for  me. Not a lot of flavor either.  Be sure to wear gloves when you handle the habaneros.  My fingers burned for three days.
