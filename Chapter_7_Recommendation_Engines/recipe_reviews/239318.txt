A very unique flavor to this dish!  Who would have thought to have parmesan, nutmeg, balsamic vinegar in a pumpkin sauce? I left out the sage and onions because I didn't have them on hand, but I don't think that detracted in any way.  The au gratin potatoes as the pasta layer made the texture a little softer than a standard lasagna.

I didn't use the au gratin potato mix - I opted for whole grain lasagna noodles. I also made a tofu ricotta blend instead of the regular ricotta. I liked the pumpkin sauce, but it could have used more spice. Overall, good recipe with some room for improvement.
