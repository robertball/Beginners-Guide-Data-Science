Easy when you just need something easy to do and want a dessert. The strawberries make the whole dessert when you use fresh. I cut up the pound cake into 1" pieces and used canned whip cream because we like the real whipped cream taste over the frozen type.

Pound Cake is a a little calorie dense. I prefer store bought Angle Food cake for a lighter dessert. Whichever one you use toasting it boosts the flavor BIG time.

Some people may think this is not a real recipe but I say we are so blessed to be able to buy ready-made products at our USA grocery stores. There are many versions of this dessert. For the cake...pound cake angle food cake bakery biscuits (my favorite)...the strawberries can be bought frozen and sweetened which I think are better than the apple-hard strawberries in the produce department. Lite frozen topping is great. Of course you can make a healthier version at home but it will take a little more work.

I've done this a few times. I've also used Tweekies in place of the pound cake and found that pretty good too.

I make whipped cream topping. Plus some mashed black berries in with the strawberries. I prefer the berries on the slightly tart side they merge very well with the topping. I lost count as to how many short cakes I've made.:- )

Easy and delicious! I had some vanilla custard in the frig so for each serving I used one slice of pound cake spread on some vanilla custard added fresh sliced strawberries and topped with fresh whipped cream! Delicious!! Lots of compliments too!

I prefer to leave out the sugar all together as the fresh strawberries are sweet enough and I use real whipped cream versus that frozen "creme" from the freezer.

I make this all the time! SometimesI use lady fingers but the density of the pound cake soaks up more of the delicious strawberry juice!

I always use angel food cake. Light airy. I also use real whip cream (some canned products are whipped cream) and stevia For sweetening strawberries. Just as quick better for you.

This is good but better with real whipped cream. I have also used angel food cake with less sugar added to the strawberries.
