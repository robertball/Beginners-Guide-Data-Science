I didn't add the cinnamon, because I tasted the beans prior to baking and thought they were perfect without it.  This recipe, sans cinnamon, is my new favorite beans recipe!  I usually find baked beans to be too sweet, but this recipe is easy on the sugar, and the chipotle peppers add a complex smoky kick to the mix.  I can't wait to take these to my family reunion...

Fabulous recipe! Huge hit with everyone alongside a smoked brisket. Did not use the cinnamon - sounded totally weird and then I read the reviews... my gut is usually right on... whenever I get a can of chipotles in adobo, I wiz it up in the processor and then freeze in ice cube trays. We like to use them in so much, but I refuse to waste the can...

Sorry, but I didn't like this recipe at all. I just finished preparing this and I am afraid they would go to waste. I was hesitant about the cinnamon and I should have go with my gut feelings and omitted it. I like cinammon just not on beans. Ugh Yikes!! As this was cooking I knew I was going to hate it. It smell gross!!. To try to masquerade the cinammon taste I added onion powder, garlic, cilantro, liquid smoke, bell pepper and some ham flavored seasoning I had. Still the cinammon taste lingered a bit and it just taste terrible!!! Sorry :(. It sounded really good. Maybe next time, if I ever make this again, I will omit the cinammon

I cut the amount of chipotle peppers in half and it was still too spicy for us.
