THIS IS A GREAT RECIPE! EVERYONE LOVED IT AT OUR LAST FAMILY GATHERING, ALTHOUGH I DID CUT THE MAYO AND BROWN SUGAR BY HALF AND ADDED SLICED GOLDEN DELICIOUS APPLES. THANKS FOR A GREAT NEW WAY TO GET MY KIDS TO EAT SWEET POTATOES!

I prepared this recipe just as directed.  After tasting it I added a tablespoon of lemon juice.  It really brought out the flavors.  This salad is even better the next day and goes great with a cold turkey sandwich.

You'll be a fan of this fall salad if you like Waldorf salad.  I served it with a nice pot roast, and my guests raved.

This is definitely a different twist on sweet potatoes.  I used canned instead of fresh, and it turned out somewhat mushy.  However, I am taking that into consideration in my rating, and I give it a four.

We liked this salad.  It is savory and hearty.  I would definitely make it again.  I also used half the mayo and sugar and substituted it for the lemon juice and apples.

I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe. The flavor was nice. I did substitute the walnuts with pecans for those that were allergic. It still received compliments.

Delicious! 
Cut back on brown sugar by 2/3. Added celery, craisins, green onions, salt, lemon juice, and a dash of cinnamon. Omitted the raisins. Substituted pecans for the walnuts. Yummy!

I made it just like the recipe and it came out great. After reading the comments, I think I'll try adding a TBSP of lemon juice for a little punch. Yum!

This was very good. I did substitute craisins and also used pecans because that was all I had on hand.  I think next time I will reduce the amount of sugar it was just a tad too sweet for out tastes.

A keeper! Compliments galore with this quick and easy receipe.Refrigerate overnight so the mayo and brown sugar absorb well. If you double I would suggest 1 3/4 mayo and 3/4 brown sugar. I had to drain some of the dressing because as written it's too much. This will be a hit.
