Leave out the herbs and I have no doubt that this is probably the easiest biscuit you could ever make. Sadly, either you can make good biscuits or you can't, it's like pie crust...
Anyway, I fall in the "can't" catagory. A few times a year I go in the kitchen and try to make some from scratch and they usually come out looking like chunks of plaster, and tasting about the same. I made these yesterday and well, they were more like flat short breads than big fluffy biscuits. But I don't blame the recipe. They still tasted pretty darned good with my homemade blackberry jam. I will try this recipe again for sure.
If you have a great recipe for biscuits already - use that one. If you don't - try this one.

Fairly tasty.  I substituted butter (cut in) for the canola oil for taste and health purposes, and the biscuits came out nice and flaky.  They smelled heavenly when baking.  A little bit dry, but not too bad.  I'll try these again.

These look great but the taste is terrible too much salt and they taste like baking powder! Never again

the biscuits turned out great, very fluffy, but the spices were not a good idea. did not go over well. I would make them again, just without spices added.

I fed these to my Chinese students to culture their tastebuds and they enjoyed them.

I've made these many times. I usually cut in cold butter (instead of using the oil) to make them nice and flaky, and it always works really well.

The herbs lent just the right touch to these nice, light, crisp biscuits.

If you like red Lobsters Cheddar Bay biscuits, try these modifications....  I nixed the canola oil instead I used 1/2 butter (cold and cut in), 1/2 olive oil, and added one clove of garlic, I also added 1/4 cup of cheddar cheese. dab a little butter and parsley on top when they come out of the oven.

These turned out very good- fluffy and moist. I liked the Italian spices very much. I knocked off one star however because I think the recipe calls for way too much salt- next time I will use half a teaspoon, or less.  Otherwise very good!  Very quick to make which is major bonus, and goes with almost any meal.

Hard to give this a four; a 3.5 would have been more like it. A tad dry. I went along with the Italian herb theme here and added chopped pepperoni and some parm cheese. For me, there are better biscuit recipes on this site.

Love it! So easy. I left out the herb seasoning and added half a cup of grated cheese. Especially good topped with creamed chicken!

Mmm, very fluffy and delicious. I substitutes olive oil for canola oil and fat free milk for low fat. Very good biscuits!
