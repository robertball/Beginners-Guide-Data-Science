This was fabulous!  I cut the recipe in half, and I shouldn't have, because there are no leftovers.  The recipe doesn't say to precook fresh yams or sweet potatoes, but it's necessary.  I baked mine instead of stovetop, at 350 degrees for about 1 hour.  Came out perfect.

This was a super-easy recipe and was a big hit at Thanksgiving.  I would definitely recommend it.  Comments I received were that this recipe had the exact sweetness required for a sweet potato recipe, and that most recipes for sweet potatoes are too sugary.  This recipe just enhanced the flavor of the sweet potato and did not overpower it.  I think they were cooked in less than 35 minutes.

I was worried cause so many people thought this recipe had too much booze taste.  I am not a big drinker, but I didnt taste the brandy at all.  Purely delicious potatoes!  Easy too! Beat the pants off whipped sweet potatoes for Thanksgiving. I cooked themin advance and put them in a casserole to reheat.  For traditions sake, I melted a few miniature marmallows on top. Everybody raved!

This recipe was wonderful. I did add alittle more brandy (1 cup for those in my family who needed the little extra holiday cheer ),it was one of the best ways to make sweet potatoes I have found.
Also, I soaked the sweet potatoes in this mixture for 24 hours.It really highlighed the brandy.
Thanks for sharing

This recipe was awesome!! I only had 1/3 cup of brandy and it still turned out great! Nice change from the marshmallow topped casserole. Even if you don't like sweet potatoes, you'll like this! I served with a thick cut center ham slice and brussel sprouts...it was really good.  Thanks!   Erin

This was so good!! I tried it last year and it was a big hit. I experimented a little with the recipe and turned it into a pie :)  I have requests from people wanting me to make the pie for their families to enjoy this holiday season.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

These had a different flavor and everyone loved it. Even my cousin who DOES NOT like sweet potatoes. Only thing i did different was to boil them until cooked before mixing them with the boiing brandy/brown sugar, etc. They turned out great!

This is the fastest, easiest dish.  And perfectly elegant.  Our bottle of brandy sat around doing nothing forever, as we don't really drink that much.  After trying it in this recipe, my hubby refuses to have sweet potatoes any other way!  Served with green beans and baked ham and biscuits, this has to be one of his all time favorites meals.  Thanks for the idea!

I ended up adding about 1/4 cup more brown sugar and a handful of walnuts; baked at 350 degrees for 30 minutes and added mini marshmallows, returned to oven to 'tan' the mallows.  Very good and we did not think the brandy was over whelming.

This recipe is sooo good, my whole family loved it.  It was very easy to make, and also easy to adjust.  I hear other people comment on the brandy but no one in my family could taste it, in fact I had to tell my mother brandy was an ingredient.  I could smell the brandy but I could not taste it. I made the recipe exactly as it was listed and I will definitely make it again.

eh.  Just okay.  Not bad by any means but not as special as I thought they would be.  Nobody at the Thanksgiving table seemed to even notice the brandy.

This is very good, however each year we cook the sweet potatoes less and less and it gets better and better.

This was great.  I usually make a mashed sweet potato with lots of brown sugar and marshmellows, but this year I decided to change it up.  There were all adults at dinner so this was perfect! I will make it again.  By the way- I had to add a few marshmellows on top, couldn't resist! YUmm

I made these along with my traditional candied yams, they were DELISH. I actually made them wednesday night and put them in an 8x8 pan and baked them about 20 prior to turkey time and they caramelized a bit more.

My husband couldn't stop raving about these sweet potatoes.  I thought the alcohol taste was a little overwhelming & I would suggest reducing the sauce down to be more like a glaze before adding the potatoes.  Very easy.  Will continue to make it for husband but will try cutting back on the brandy next time.

Hubby really, really liked these.  I simmered the butter and brandy for about 8 minutes on low before adding brown sugar to give it a smooth/non-alcohol flavor!... Very good!  Also topped with pecans and a few miniature marshmallows.  Picture was before I browned them at Moms on Thanksgiving!  I use yams instead of sweet potatoes because of the bright pretty color... The taste and texture is the same!

This is a quick & easy side to put together.   My substitutions were 2 tbsp butter & 2 tbsp coconut oil (for 1/2 cup butter) and 1/2 cup coconut sugar (for 1/2 cup brown sugar)...and I chose to steam my peeled, cubed sweet potatoes instead of boil them.  Tender, flavorful...delicious!!

My husband doesn't like yams, but loved them in this dish! He said I have to make them this way again. ( I thought the brandy was too strong so I might cut it down to 1/3 cup next time).

I thought this recipe was really good. I followed it exaclty as instructed. I did not taste the brandy at all, and I was a bit worried about that.  My wife LOVED them. She said its a keeper. I sort of felt they could have had a bit more flavor, but I can't quite pinpoint what it needed.

Utterly delicious.  Do not make this too far ahead, it needs to be ready at exactly the same time as dinner or it will be mushy.  If you're not sure what time dinner will be, cut the potatoes to twice bite-size so they don't turn completely to mush by the time you eat them.

Absoulutely delicious!! I used brandy and sherry and it was perfect. My dish DID incorporate the sauce, I cooked it as suggested but turned it or flipped it and let it cook another few minutes so it was well done and tender and had a nice crust at the edges. Will make it again and again especially for company.

Best sweet potato recipe I've ever had.  I'm not a hard liquor kind of gal but the brandy wasn't overbearing.  I scaled this recipe down to serve 4, bought an airline size bottle of brandy and didn't use it all.  You can serve your plate with sauce which goes great with ham, or leave the guilt off your plate and these are still the best sweet potatoes ever!  Thanks, it's a keeper and a new Christmas tradition.

These Sweet Potatoes are different, but I prefer a mashed version.

These are YAMS, not Sweet Potatoes.  Sweet Potatoes are off-white and do not have the flavor of YAMS. I add pecans and some cranberries for flavor and color.

I made this for Thanksgiving for my fiance's family and it was a major hit!  I used cherry brandy and it was delicious.  There was nothing left after about 15 minutes and my only regret was I didn't make more!

This has a nice flavor, but you could cut back on the butter and brandy.  I do think that it holds the brandy flavor and this might not suit some people.

This was not a hit with my family and I.  There was way too much brandy and the dish was very unattractive.  Maybe roasting the potatoes and using less brandy would help.  I'm not sure that I would bother trying to make this better though.

I made the recipe exactly as written.  Everyone at Thanksgiving dinner liked it.  My adult son said that it was just the right amount of sweetness...not overly sweet like so many sweet potato recipes are.  I'm not a big fan of sweet potatoes myself but I must admit this recipe was the best I've had.

I messed this up.  I decided to take the ingredients, place them in a baking dish and then bake them (covered) and put mini marshmallows on top at the end.  Bad idea!  Tons of liquid and the brandy was WAY to strong to feed to anyone that's not an alcoholic.  I would have scored it lower except I'm quite sure it would have been great if I followed the instructions.

I used ginger brandy for this recipe, its all i had on hand.  They came out pretty good but a bit strong.  I think if I try these again I will use less brandy.

This recipe definitely goes in the family book!  Ingredients are easy to purchase, prep & cook time is reasonable, passes the "turrible veggie" taste test so what more can you ask for?  Seriously, the flavor is excellent.
