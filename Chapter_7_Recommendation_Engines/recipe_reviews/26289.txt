I loved the simplicity of this vegetarian entree.  Season to taste for me meant olive oil, Italian seasonings, salt & pepper, and grated Parmesan cheese.  Yummy!  

Next time, I'll try it with pesto as the seasoning!

Don’t discount this recipe because of its simplicity. It is what makes it so good. Also, don’t be discouraged by the negative reviews. If you like simple dishes that have rustic flavor, try this. I really, really liked this recipe. As written, it works exactly as stated. Keep your eye on the water. Don’t be tempted to add too much. If you keep it at a stew level, keep stirring, it will produce a lovely sauce to keep the pasta moist. Seasoning just with salt is very tasty. I added a bit of creole seasoning and thought that was nice, too. Thank you for the recipe.
