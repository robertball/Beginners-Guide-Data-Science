This is my recipe...and I usually use light mayo for the sauce. The recipe makes more sauce than you will need...so I think the calorie and fat content may be off. The mustard blend in the beginning is just to help the pretzels stick, so you don't need to drench the chicken, just lightly coat both sides. Enjoy :)

I didn't love this. Despite following the recipe exactly and baking in a convection oven, the crust was not crunchy. You will need to double the marinade--there is not nearly enough for 4 chicken breast halves. I also think you could cut the mayo to 1 or 2 tablespoons for the dipping sauce.

This was very good!  I used 4 whole chicken breasts instead of the halves, and pounded them thin.  Then, I cut them into tenders.  Using this much, I had to use 4 times the mustard mixture.  For the pretzels, I crushed a pound bag of the big, sourdough hard pretzels.  I didn't crush them to "flour," but left small pieces.  The crust stayed crunchy and was so good!  I didn't use the recipe for the honey mustard to drizzle on the top because we had some Ken's Light Honey Mustard dressing already.  We used that as a dip and it was perfect!

If you are worried about salt content, use no salt pretzles to coat your chicken.  The salt in the dipping sauce you can control or use Mrs. Dash if you want it salt free.

My family loved this.  The flavor combination can't be beat.  I made this after looking for a quick recipe that I had all the ingredients already in my pantry and fridge.  I especially loved that the chicken is first dipped into a tangy mustard to coat before the pretzels.  That step gives it a little extra pop of flavor.  This one is definitely 5 stars for my family!

tasted good, but not worth the effort.  You couldn't taste the individual mustards, and barely get a hint of pretzel flavor.  You can do this with one type of mustard, and breadcrumbs.  It did taste good though, and we had no leftovers..

Followed the recipe but added a little thyme to the breading. It was great! My husband loved the sauce. Thanks Kathleen. Will make again and share with others. When I described our dinner to my "foody" BIL he got very excited.

I agree with another review - my crust was not crunchy.  I will make it again though!  I loved the mustard/honey marinade.  The sauce is a keeper too!  Great recipe Kathleen.

Delish! Anyone who 'knows' me here on AR knows that my brother is one of the pickiest eaters in existence. He ate two chicken breasts and wouldn't stop talking about how good it was, makes it an automatic 10 star recipe in my house! I made it just as stated, except I made a bit less sauce and used 1 tbsp of the spicy mustard in the sauce because I didn't have quite enough of the plain yellow mustard. The first part of the recipe, for dunking the chicken made the perfect amount for me, it was just enough for the four breasts. If you have particularly large breasts (giggle), you might want to make a little more of it, since it was JUST enough. Thanks for the excellent recipe, Kathleen!

So good! I thought this would be best just for a casual weeknight dinner, but imagine my surprise when I discovered that this is a dish fit to serve to company! The only possible downside to note is that the pretzel breading is best when served fresh out of the oven. If allowed to sit, it tends to soften and lose its crunch. If you know you'll have leftovers, reserve the honey mustard sauce from the last step and don't put it on the chicken until you're reheating. I would recommend reheating in the oven at about 325 for 10 minutes, which should help restore some crispiness to the breading after being stored in a humid refrigerator.

We enjoyed this very unique chicken recipe.  Because some other reviewers mentioned that the mustards and pretzel flavors weren't real strong, I decided to use Honey Mustard Pretzel bits for half the pretzels, and regular pretzels for the other half.  It was nice and crispy and very good.  As it sat, the pretzels did get a little soggy, so be sure to eat this as soon as it is ready.

Enjoyed this.  The sauce made it very good, but changed it to my preference after tasting it.  Added 1T spicy mustard for a little more flavor in the sauce.

This was excellent chicken, Kathleen!! The only thing I left out was the grainy mustard, didn't have that. Baked 25 minutes and it was just right. The hubby requests that I deep fry it next time, lol (if it ain't broke, don't fix it, I say)....he decided he likes pretzels and just didn't know it!

Excellent recipe!  I did cut back on the honey a bit and used light mayo for the sauce.  The chicken turned out really well.  I will be making this one again.

the chicken itself I made as written/no changes. I did make minor changes to the dipping sauce. In the past I have always made my dijoniase type sauces with half mayo and half mustard...so I did the same here....1/2c mayo and 1/2c mustard instead of 3 TB mustard...and I left the salt out of the sauce. Not sure why you need it/plenty of flavor in the mustard sauce and there is more than enough sodium in this recipe just in the pretzle rods used to make the chicken coating. Overall family really liked the flavor, but like some other posters mine did not come out crispy....need to work on that aspect but would make it again.

Turned out very good.  I made a very large batch (x8)  and I only put 1T of Honey in the wet part of the batter (wasn't thinking)...  anyway it still turned out fine.  Perhaps I will simplify things a little bit next time by using just spicy and stoneground mustards for the outside, and yellow in the sauce.

This recipes is great, remember it's not under healthy bites.  I double coated my chicken first with the fine crumbs then a little coarser. If you are worried about sodium this is not for you .

Surprisingly bland.  I followed the recipe to a tee except that I used prepared honey mustard to put on the chicken after it was cooked instead of making my own.  That didn't matter though, the chicken was very boring.  If I were to make this again, before pounding the chicken I would add seasoning salt, garlic salt, or something to give it some more flavor.

I thought this was pretty darn good. I just patted my chicken dry and dipped it in egg, then in crushed pretzels because I was lazy and didn't have all that mustard and baked for half an hour. It was yummy!

Delicious!!! I used chicken thigh, and marinaded them for about 1 hour in the mustard sauce. Husband is NOT a mustard fan, I drizzled bottled hot wing sauce on his instead of the honey mustard/mayo sauce, he loved it. Said, add it to the rotation. I liked that the pretzels browned up perfectly. Little fat in this recipe and it looks like it has been sauteed

I make this with Gluten Free pretzels and it is wonderful. My husband likes this more than any other crunchy coating I make.

We were looking forward to this recipe so much.  My kids are pretzel and honey mustard freaks and love any kind of chicken so I was sure this would be a great hit since the flavor combos were spot on for us.  However, even after following the recipe to a 'T', this was found to be a tad on the dry side and just didn't have the "crunch" we were expecting.  I will be trying it again, maybe with some tweaking we can get it to be a better fit for us.    LOVE the concept!

I basically just used the concept of this recipe. To save time I coated the chicken in bottled honey mustard mixed with a little mayo.  Then I rolled in a mixture of ritz crackers, french's french fried onions, and mini pretzels seasoned with garlic powder, lawry's seasoned salt and pepper (pulsed in a food processor until fairly fine).  I pounded the chicken thin and baked on a cooling rack on top of a cookie sheet lined with foil.  Baked at 375 for about 1/2 hour.  Chicken was moist, the breading was crunchy and flavorful and very addictive when dipped in ketchup.  I know I really modified the recipe here but it was such a good and quick weeknight dinner I had to rate it.

This is really good as a base, I used thighs not breast and used plain non-fat yogurt instead of mayo.  I didn't crush the pretzels so much so they would retain their crunch and it was great.

I think this was good. My only thing was it didn't have a very strong pretzel taste, it was probably because of the mustards, but regardless it is very good! I will try this again but I will need to get a rack because some of the breading fell off.

It didn't come out crunchy, and the meat was dry.  Too much effort for a lackluster result.  If you try it, use a food processor for the pretzels.

Yum. We really enjoyed this. I butterflied rather than pounded the chicken. That was the only change I made. Hubby says it's a keeper. I really liked the sauce and will probably also use it on other chicken recipes. Thanks for sharing Kathleen.

too much mustard for me, but I tweaked it a little for my own taste. The crushed pretzels made a wonderful crust. I also did not flattened my chicken, so needed to increase the cooking time. Still a great dish with a nice twist.

This came out very well and was easy to put together.  The only complaint I have is that before we could finish eating the pretzel crumbs began getting soft instead of staying crispy.  But I loved the flavor and the honey mustard sauce.

This is one of my favorite recipes.  It is delicious and I ate 2 servings of it within 5 minutes (shame on me), I omitted the red wine vinegar because I didn't have any, and added 1 tbsp of mayonnaise.  I also dipped the chicken in the pretzel mixture first, then the mustard mixture, then again in the pretzel mixture to make it extra crispy!  Make sure to make extra honey mustard sauce as it will go fast!

This is wonderful ..instead of using the 3 various mustards I used 3 tbs of honey mustard and still added the honey. The salty crust from the pretzels creates a great taste your whole family will love!

DH, who is not the biggest chicken fan, said, "This is some good chicken."  And it is good chicken.  Rather than pounding the chicken out, I just butterflied it.  I didn't make the dipping sauce, as I had prepared honey mustard on hand.  Next time I'm going to place the chicken on a metal rack inside the baking sheet.  Thanks for sharing.

Mmm mmm good! I liked that a lot :) and will be making it again! Really love the crunchy coating (I used the big, hard sourdough pretzels). The only thing I changed was substituting mayo with quark as I did not have any mayo on hand. It tasted great, and I saved a bunch on calories and fat (now I can look for dessert hehe). Thanks for a great recipe!

This came out really nicely.  It wasn't hard to make, and my husband and MIL really liked it.  My husband was the only one who said he would have liked to have used no-salt pretzels.  I used about 1/2 the amount of pretzels.  I didn't have yellow mustard, so I used spicy mustard as a stand in.  Also, I halved the amount of honey for the sauce, otherwise it would have been too sweet for us.

Made this last night and it was delicious.  Simple to prep and the baking time is long enough to make some sides and still have time to clean up a little before it comes out of the oven.  The honey mustard sauce was great, but I would like to try using dijon or spicy mustard next time, instead of yellow to see how it works with a little kick to the sweetness of it.  I served it with green beans and mashed potatoes and there wasn't even a smear left for the dog.

I think this dish is easy, different and delish!  I probably didn't grind my pretzels fine enough, but I kinda liked the crunch the bigger pieces provided.  The sauce is great and would be a great dipping sauce for other things (ie. french fries).  Will definitely make again!

This is a keeper. My changes:
1.   Use premium honey, mustard flavored pieces AND regular pretzel pieces in a 3 to 1 ratio.

2.   Blitz the pretzel pieces finer in a food processor.  Courser is not better here. (This isn't Panko).

3.  Pan-fry in a 1/4 inch of veg. oil to golden brown, then transfer in an oven to finish.

I cut the chicken into nugget-sized pieces before coating them. I didn't have course mustard on hand so ended up only using yellow and dijon mustard. For the crust, I used 1 cup pretzels, 1 cup Wheat Thins, and 1 cup Ancient Grains crackers because that's what i had on hand. I ended up really liking the Wheat Thins, so next time I'll try half Wheat Thins and half pretzels. I used the sauce just for dipping and not for coating. For dipping, I only needed about half the recommended sauce. Overall, great recipe, but my husband just isn't a huge fan of honey mustard sauce.
For my family, 4 svgs = 2-3 individuals meals

Good but not my favorite. Sauce was delicious but the ground up pretzels got a bit mushy. I barely had enough sauce for coating the chicken and had tons of sauce for dribbling on top.

followed recipe exactly!  Great recipe but I didn't really taste the mustard coating- I may have had too much pretzel!  Next time will chop the pretzel in a food processor to get finer.  Didn't have the problem of pretzel getting soggy like others.  The drizzle was incredible- can use it as a salad dressing as well.  Chicken stayed moist also.

The sauce was terrible, would have been better off just dipping in mustard. The pretzels were half mushy/half crispy. Flavor of the chicken was gross as well.

Thought this was awesome!  I only used spicy brown mustard, I did not put in any vinegar only b/c I didnt have any and used Snyders Honey Mustard and onion pretzels on the top. My son finished all the left overs! Will definitely make this again!

I liked this recipe but had to use gluten-free pretzels and those got soft instead of crispy in the oven.

I followed the recipe ingredients and measurements loosely, mainly using it as an idea but did follow the prep/cooking instructions and it was AWESOME! I used honey mustard and onion pretzels which I think was a tasty touch. I also used much more marinade partially because I had some rather large chicken breasts. Kudos for this one!

this is amazing! I was looking for a different and new way to make chicken and I found a winner! I made this a couple night ago for dinner. It was sooo easy and delicious! I didnt use the red wine vinegar because I didnt have any. Also, I just used mayonnaise, yellow mustard, dijon mustard and honey for the sauce. This is definitely a keeper! Thank you for the great and easy recipe! Will make this again for sure!

This was okay....I just wasn't so crazy about the pretzel crust.  If you do use regular pretzels the salt is absolutely crazy high.  I did like the mustard flavors however so may try it again with panko crumbs.

I made this tonight for dinner and was VERY disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly and found the chicken lacking any mustard flavor, the crust was soggy and the dish was too much work for the outcome. I will not be making this again.

Nice chicken recipe.  I don't keep all those types of mustard on-hand so I just used 2 tbsp of yellow and 2 tbsp of dijon.  Worked fine.  I also increased the red wine vinegar, honey, and veg oil to 2 tbsp each.  It was just enough to really cover the chicken.  The honey mustard sauce finished it out nicely.

I thought this recipe was very good and will make it again.  The one thing is that I will use my food processor for the pretzels.  I didn't care for big pieces of pretzels as they were too soft for me.  Love the sauce and will use it again for other recipes.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this as written except for marinating the chicken overnight in the mustard mixture and using Ken's Lite Honey Mustard Dressing for the dipping sauce. My whole family loved it, (with the exception of my very picky 3 yr old who liked the chicken but did not like the pretzel coating).    I used thin stick pretzels which I pulsed in the food processor until in rabbit-food-pellet sized chunks. Most of this got soft upon baking, but just enough remained crisp to give a nice, not too crunch, texture.    Will definitely make again, with one piece left unbreaded for the littlest one.  Thank you!

This is a very delicious dish. I did as some had suggested and did not crush the pretzels fully to try to get a little extra crunch to it. We did not like the chunks of pretzel. Next time I will put them in the processor and finely chop them up. The flavor of the honey mustard is wonderful. This is a keeper! Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent!!!  VERY well received by my kids (2, 5) and hubby!  I took each chicken breast half and cut them them in half.   I used 5 cups of pretzels instead of 4 to ensure there was enough coating for the chicken, and then doubled the sauce recipe---you will find the sauce is delicious and kids will love to use it as a dip!!  Tip: Use light mayo--it cuts down on the fat content but you won't lose the taste!

This is good however it did not get crispy (at least not my definition of it). I omitted the spicy mustard and increased the other two kinds, also substituted balsamic vinegar for the red wine variety simply because that's what I had. Reduced the mayonnaise to a 1/4 cup. Perhaps if the breasts were pounded very thin then breaded, frying on the stove-top would achieve the crispy crust that we like.

I thought this was DELICIOUS!!!! I did not have the red wine vinegar or all the different types of mustard, I just had a regular mustard and used extra of that to sub. In the end I was VERY pleased!!!!!!! My Husband and his friends all loved it! Thank you for the recipe :)

Absolutely delicious and really easy!  Kathleen, your honey mustard sauce is just fantastic!  I followed the recipe except I used half crushed pretzels and half panko because I didn't have enough pretzels.  It was nice and crispy outside and tender and juicy inside.  Thanks for a great recipe!

We loved this recipe!  Although I made mine a little differently.  I made the honey mustard sauce with the other spices and honey and basted my chicken with it, rolled it in the pretzel crumbs and then baked them with melted butter over them to crisp them up.  I also used chicken tenders instead of breasts to bake quicker.  My family loved them, even my picky eater!  I will make these again.

I surprised my wife with this last week.  She said it was the best chicken she's ever had.  I followed the recipe as closely as possible, but I was missing two ingredients:  The first was spicy mustard, which I substituted for a sriracha spicy mustard.  The second was honey, for which I used maple syrup (the real stuff, not the fake stuff).  It was OUTRAGEOUS.  We're looking forward to trying it with all of the right ingredients.

I eat a lot of pretzel crisps so I was looking for a recipe to use up all the pretzel crumbs. My family gives this recipe 6 thumbs up! I was too lazy to pound the chicken breasts; I simply cut each breast in 4 pieces.  I needed to make more mustard "marinade" to coat 2 chicken breast halves thoroughly.  I followed the recipe exactly  but did not feel the need to flip the chicken.  I checked on it at the halfway point and it was looking happy so why mess with it? I also did not make the sauce to pour over it. We used French's honey mustard for anyone who wanted to dip. This recipe will be added to the rotation.

I've probably made this recipe 20 times since I found it here on this site. *It's a keeper!* Crunchy, salty, a little sweet...and the chicken meat stays so moist and tender under all that crunch - perfect!  To streamline prep,here are some tips: Tip #1: Prepare the crunched-up pretzels in quantity: Buy a large bag of house-brand pretzel sticks, crunch up the whole bag in the food processor (a little at a time until they're all crunched) and store the result in a screw-top jar - I use one that originally held toasted almonds from Costco.  (The crunching process can be sort of  messy, so I prefer to do it infrequently and produce in quantity. One bag of pretzels makes enough crumbs for about five batches prepared per the  recipe.  Tip #2:: The honey/ mayo/mustard sauce is really delicious and good on many other items besides this chicken (although it is *divine* on this chicken!)  At my house, we've put it on baked potatoes (in place of sour cream and butter) and sparingly on veggies, to name just two alternative uses. After the first couple of times I made this recipe, I began stirring up a double batch of the sauce and keeping the excess in the fridge in a mason jar.  Tip #3: Don't forget to spray the coated chicken with nonstick spray (such as Pam) just before you pop it in the oven - per the recipe. The nonstick spray will ensure your chicken comes out of the oven with nice, slightly crispy darker brown areas that provide  a nice color contrast to otherwise the mostly beige

Yum! This was soooo good! I used 2 giant breasts which probably equaled 4 regular ones. I barely had enough of the sauce to dredge the chicken in so I will double it next time. Also, I doubled the dipping sauce as others recommended, but that ended up being way too much. I baked them on a cookie sheet with a rack so the pretzel crust was nice and crispy. We had the leftovers the next night. When I pulled them out of the fridge, the pretzels were kind of mushy, but I put them back on the cookie sheet with the rack at 350 for 10 min each side and they turned out perfect!

I made this as a sandwich. I changed out the vegetable oil for olive oil. In the sauce i used jalapeno mustard and addedd 1Tbsp of sriracha. Put it on  a pretzle bun with pepperjack cheese, lettuse & tomato. It was a big hit!

This is an easy and decadent entree.  Looks amazing and taste to boot!  I omitted the coarse ground mustard, because I didn't have any, but It was perfect as is.  Will definitely be making this again.

Was really tasty and moist.  Had left  over Prestel sticks and put them in the processer.  This is the key to not making it to soggy.  Coated the chicken with left over mustard and let sit in frig all day.  The sauce really good with it.  My husband has me making it daily right now for his salad as well.  We used plain yogurt vs mayo to help cut back on calories. Had green beans and salad with it.   No need for rice or potatoes with that crust on the chicken.  Will make again.   (great way to use up those items almost gone to clean out your frig.)

Really good I will make it again, but I would go a little farther with it next time.  Probably make a spicier sauce, perhaps a couple different mustard based sauced to use for dipping. 

I had a raspberry vinaigrette instead of the red wine in the coating but I then paired the dish with a salad topped with pretzels and the raspberry dressing.

We liked the flavor of the chicken, but not the mushy pretzels. I had extra marinade and lots of left over "dipping" sauce. I also used less than a cup of pretzels for each breast. Not sure how to make this one work. I may try the marinade and sauce with panko bread crumbs and see if that gives it a bit more crunch. It would certainly be less sodium!

We really enjoyed the dish so much! I marinated the chicken for several hours beforehand.  Would probably crush pretzel sticks next time to get the  coating to stick to the chicken better.  Thank you ever so much for sharing the recipe!!

This was excellent!  My oldest son came home and thought that I bought this chicken pre-battered!  He LOVED it and so didn't my husband and I.  The only thing I did different was I didn't pound out the chicken.  I cut the chicken pieces into 2-3" chunks.  Everything came out perfect.

We made this and LOVED it. The sauces are fantastic. One thing to keep in mind is to really crush down the pretzels. We used small pieces and when we flipped the chicken the pieces kinda fell off. Beginners mistake! We will definitely make this again.

This had fantastic flavor! I subbed white wine vinegar for the red, and my pretzels were Trader Joe's honey wheat...great combo! Not as crispy as I had hoped but think it could have been the pretzels. I convect baked at 400 for 12 minutes, flipped, and went another 8 minutes or so. Perfect juicy chicken, thanks for the recipe Kathleen!

It was great! I used thin cut chicken breasts and 6 came in the package, I could have made a little more of the first sauce and you need to really saturate the chicken in the sauce to get the pretzels to stick. I also added a little extra honey to the honey mustard sauce, it came out perfect! Great and easy dinner!

This was an ok recipe! It wasnt great and wasnt horrible. I was a bit disappointed. for me it just tasted like a mustard breaded chicken. The pretzel flavor just didnt come through like I thought it would have.

So delicious! I was a little skeptical of making this because I assumed it would be another bland chicken recipe. I was so wrong! The honey mustard sauce is so good. I have made this twice in two weeks. Yum!

I made a few changes.  I used a tablespoon and a half of regular mustard, and a tablespoon and a half of spicy brown mustard.  I did not use the honey or the coarse grained mustard.  I also cooked it in my oven at 350 degrees for one hour.  It was delicious.  Definitely will make this again.

The mustard sauce was good but the chicken was not crispy at all. It was mushy and over crusted.

I made this for dinner last night. I'm giving it five stars because with the sauce that goes on top, it's five stars. The sauce is delicious. I tried a bite without the sauce and it was bland. I couldn't taste the mustard mixture that it was dipped in at all, and there was no "pretzel" taste whatsoever. It tasted like basic, breaded chicken. It's crispy when it comes out of the oven, but after it sits, it loses its crunch. I will definitely make this again, but I might not bother with the pretzel coating. I will probably use the mustard mixture to dip in in before breading it again (even though we couldn't taste it) because it did a good job securing the coating.

Sooooo good! The chicken, pretzel, sauce combo is amazing!  I am definitely this making again! I used light mayo as some others have done. Still fantastic!

Great flavor and great method! I loved this.  I watch my sodium (not that I try to eat low sodium, but I track all my calories and assorted micronutrients including salt) and pretzels are OUTRAGEOUSLY high sodium, so I used Snyder's unsalted, and it was perfect! Didn't miss the salt at all, nor did I miss the canola oil (which I also skipped, including the spray) - the crumbs adhered to the chicken beautifully, and they were perfectly crunchy and crispy when I pulled the chicken from the oven. So I made a few minor tweaks to make it a little healthier, but overall I thought this was a fantastic recipe and will definitely make it again (and maybe try it with tofu for my vegetarian husband!). Thank you for the recipe!

This is a delicious way to prepare chicken and the honey mustard sauce is equally delicious.  I halved the recipe using 2 chicken breast and used light mayonnaise for the sauce.    This recipe is great as written and I know I will be making this one again.  I served this with a salad and ‘Parmesan Crusted Baby Carrots’ another AR recipe.  Thanks Kathleen for sharing, it is a keeper.

My husband was astonished at how good this was. Whoever thought it up is a genius, he said. We used Quorn brand fake Chicken, since we're vegetarian...and it was great!

This was good - we had almost all of the ingredients already, so made for a short grocery store trip.  We didn't have spicy or brown mustard, but I thought the sauce was the best part - turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe!
