This is my recipe so I just wanted to offer a few more helpful tips! Tip #1: Feel free to add more herbs and spices to taste-- I often up the rosemary and add in dried thyme or oregano, Tip #2: To get an extra crispy skin switch the oven to broil on high heat for the last 5-10 minutes of cooking, and Tip #3: This chicken also tastes great the next day so feel free to make extra for sandwiches, soups, tacos, or chicken pot pie.

We have a meal like this basically once every ten days using Trader Joe's kosher chicken.  The difference with this one was the garlic and the herbs since I usually just use salt and pepper along with my lemon olive oil.  This was very nice, and I'll change to this more savory style now.  Very good!  We loved it!  Thanks!

Tried this and loved it.  Easy to prepare.  I didn't have rosemary but added a Mrs. Dash alternative.  I did broil it during the last 15 minutes and it came out crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  Great tasting and it seems healthy.  Will definitely make it again.

This was  a very good receipe. The person that broiled the chicken must not be able to follow directions. The recipe states to bake the chicken not broil it.

I drizzle on the olive oil, add herbs (basil, oregano, thyme) plus onion powder, salt and pepper, top with minced garlic and a sprig of fresh rosemary on each piece.  I don't refrigerate them for 45 as the recipe suggests; I just put them straight in the oven, and it always turns out delicious!  We love this recipe!

There is nothing wrong with this recipe at all with the exception of how to account for the wide variation of breast thickness/weight a consumer may receive from their grocery. The broiler is a radiant heat source so the amount of time it takes to penetrate a material is very dependent on thickness. The thawed split breasts I used were obviously thicker than the author's and after the ~20 minutes in the broiler the internal temp was only 124 degrees. A continuation of broiling would leave the exterior burnt. It would seem that broiler recipes have an built in requirement for some consideration for thickness and weight. As a suggestion it might be handy for the original recipe to indicate what the thickness and weight was so those reading it could try to adjust.

This is a 5 star recipe.  I don't know why (us271934) felt she had to instruct us on the thickness/size and the various lengths of time it takes to bake a thicker cut of meat or chicken breast, in this case.  Everyone who bakes/cooks knows the bigger/thicker the piece of meat, the longer you have to bake it.  My family found this delicious and refreshing.  Kind of like cooking out...know your grill or oven!

The aroma that filled the kitchen as these were baking was a mouth-watering prelude of what was to come.  These were incredibly flavorful and so juicy and tender you'd think they  had been brined.  Rather than individual seasonings I used my favorite Tuscan seasoning blend, but I don't think you could go wrong seasoning these any way you like.  As I've found (unfortunately) so often is the case, chickens are bred to be much  bigger than they used to be, and that means larger breast portions too.  That said, even tho' the breasts I used were huge,  I found 40-45 minutes in the oven was just right, so watch cooking time carefully!  We sliced these up and drizzled the pan juices over them upon serving.  I served this with Golden Potato and Herb Bake, also from this site, and fresh steamed broccoli.  It was a beautiful, light, and satisfying dinner.

I also made cuts into the chicken and stuffed them with garlic cloves and fresh basil leaves but you could stuff it with garlic alone and/or any fresh spices that you like.  This gave flavour throughout the chicken, not just the top section, especially if you are using thicker cuts of chicken.

Tried this recipe exactly as written this evening and we absolutely loved it! This is a SUPER simple recipe that looks like you spent much more time on it than you actually did. The chicken turned out so tender and flavorful. We will definitely make this again...soon! And the chicken breasts with bone and skin are SO much cheaper than standard chicken breasts!

Used 2 boneless, skinless chicken breast.  Convection roasted uncovered at 450 for 22 minutes.  Turned out great.

Perfect chicken! I smoothed a combo of lemon olive oil and a really nice fruity olive oil over the skin, then sprinkled on garlic and onion powders along with Mrs. Dash Salt Alternative. Took the suggestion of others and used a bit of chicken broth in the bottom of the pan. Baked at 475 for 1 hour. The pan I used could not be put under a broiler, but the skin still turned out nice and crispy with the meat fully cooked, juicy and tender! My guys loved it and complimented me on it, which is unusual because they will eat pretty much whatever I put in front of them, so when I get a compliment, I know it was truly great! And so easy it's almost funny. Thank you, thank you, thank you for this wonderful recipe!!!

I made the recipe exactly as written, and it exceeded my expectations. The meat was moist and flavorful, and tasted great. This will be my go-to recipe for bone-in chicken breasts from now on.

Very good. I slice fresh garlic and put the sliced clove under the skin. Not a fan of rosemary so I use thyme, basil, kosher salt & pepper after I brush the skin with olive oil. Lastly, I thinly slice half a lemon and put in the dish and then squeeze the juice from the other side over the chicken. The lemon from the thyme along with the fresh lemon makes this even tastier. Definitely put under the broiler the last bit of cooking time to get that crispy skin. I don't eat it but my husband and kids love it.

Extremely delicious. Full of flavor and very juicy. I cooked three large whole breasts with no bones and no skin and it still came out wonderfully good. I covered the baking dish with aluminum foil. My husband who is very picky, was very impressed and ended eating two full pieces. Easy to make and absolutely FANTASTIC! Thank you for sharing.

I googled a Baked split Chicken Breast recipe and this one popped up.  I ran with it and it turned out fabulous.  I did take the suggestion of turning the oven from bake to broil for the last 10 minutes.  The chicken was nice and crispy.  The flavors of garlic and rosemary came through beautifully.  I did not have any basil, so I tried thyme.  It added a great dimension to the flavors.  Thanks for the recipe and suggestion.  It's a keeper on this end.

I love this recipe.  The only thing I do different is add olive oil and spices to a bowl and make a paste with it that I rub into the chicken which I have poked with holes. I also add 3/4 tsp Bell's seasoning to the other spices and up the garlic. Make sure to rub under and over the skin of chicken. Letting the chicken rest for 45 minutes with the spices on it is a must as it marinates the thicker breasts. Another tip is to place lemon slices underneath the chicken to help it maintain its moisture.

My family loved it, including our picky 5 and 7 yr old kids!  I followed the recipe omitting the 45 min. in the frig step. I also put some of the seasoning mix under the chicken skin. 3 large split breast (1 was very thick) were cooked w/in 60 minutes. They came out moist and crispy.  My husband (also very picky) said it was the best chicken I've ever made. Thanks so much! It's a keeper!!  Update: I used boneless skinless chicken breast and baked covered  in oven for 20 minutes and 10 uncovered. Husband said it was perfectly done and my 7 yr old asked for seconds!

This is a great recipe!  If you have time, brine the breasts earlier in the day, by soaking them in 1/4 cup Kosher salt and 1/4 cup sugar dissolved in 2 quarts cold water.  Leave the to brine for 45 min, then rinse, pat dry, and put them back in the fridge on a paper towel-lined plate.  Here's the trick for crispy skin: leave the chicken uncovered in the fridge after brining. This dries the skin out slightly, leading to a crispier skin after roasting.  Other than the brining step, I followed the recipe for ingredients & measurements exactly. (Skipped the marinate in the fridge step because I didn't end up having time.) I roasted the breasts for 45 minutes, basting once with the pan juices.  Let rest under foil for 10 minutes, then we ate.  Perfectly tender, juicy, delicious!

Baked Split Chicken Breast Haiku: "All flavor in skin. But chicken texture was moist. Doubt I'd make again." Followed the recipe exactly as written, and while the chicken was moist, it was far from flavorful - all of the seasoning was in that crispy, oh-so-healthy skin. Maybe if I'd cut slits in the chicken and jammed in garlic and herbs the flavor would've permeated the meat, but for how wonderful it smelled while baking, I was disappointed that ultimately it was a far from tasty piece of chicken.

Bland as bland gets. Also, you should go to 60 minutes, not 45, as the meat near the bone was a bit gamey and needed more time.  Sorry,

Great simple recipe, easy to customize to your own tastes.  I added a little Dijon mustard and paprika.  I rubbed some of the marinade mixture under the skin as well.  The chicken was so cold already that I let it sit out, covered for the 45 minutes, then used convection bake on my toaster oven.  I also cooked it skin side down for the first 20 minutes, which I think helps keep the meat from drying out.  Perfect crispy skin and moist, tender white meat; served with steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes, it was wonderful comfort food on a Monday!

I used this recipe and loved it. The only thing I did different was broil it for the last 10 minutes and it turned out perfect with a crispy outside and juicy inside. I made baby red potatoes and green beans to complement the wonderful flavor of the chicken.

I didn't use fresh garlic but garlic powder instead. I also didn't rub in each ingredient individually onto the chicken, instead I made a marinate with all the ingredients and rubbed it all in at once on both sides (top and bottom) of the chicken breast. It came out tasting AMAZING. I would recommend you individually wrap the chicken breast in aluminum foil and let bake for 45 minutes. I personally flip the chicken at every 15 minutes increments but this isn't a necessity. After the 45 minutes is up, I open up the foil make sure the chicken skin is facing upward. I leave the foil open and place chicken back in the over for another 10 minutes to get a gold brown color to the skin.

Up front, I should say that I use this recipe with boneless/skinless breasts, but... this is my favorite way to do breasts, period.  I double the marinade (usually do at least 4 or 5 fairly large breasts) and try to let it sit at least 3 hours.  My wife and kids are not big rosemary fans, so I cut that down quite a bit.  (I add a little cayenne, too, depending on who is eating.  1/8 tsp.  More if it's just me!)  The biggest addition for us is paprika.  I add at least 1 tsp.  I would rate this recipe 5 stars regardless of additions, so thank you to Prospective PhD for posting.  My tweaks are just for those who might have similar tastes as our family, but this recipe is a can't miss on it's own.  So easy, so fast and so juicy if you make sure it doesn't get over-cooked.  I bake at 325 for 30 minutes just to be safe (gas oven), until chicken hits 165.  Sometimes it's done after 30... sometimes I have to put back in for a few more minutes, usually depends on chicken breast size.  Hope this helps.

I make a similar chicken dish.  The herbs/spices can burn when placed on the outside of the skin.  Pull the skin back and put the herbs/spices directly on the meat, then pull the skin back.  Rub some olive oil over the skin and then drizzle the breast with some fresh lemon juice.  Cook as directed.  So, so good!

It was very tasty!  I cooked butternut squash, onions, and potatoes with it like a roast. I did adjust the seasonings to our family's taste as suggested by the author.

I like to put the dry herbs under the skin and olive oil on top. Gives the chicken great flavor and crispy skin.

A very good base recipe! I used 2 big bone-in breasts for 3 of us.I did the garlic-rosemary-thyme-olive oil-pepper-Mrs Dash- a dash of paprika-onion powder in oven at 350* for an hour. I also did Rosemary-garlic-olive oil-onion potatoes sliced like a fr. fry in a pie plate at the same time. Salad and gr. beans. I like to bake chicken often changing up the herbs,always good!

Very tasty and easy to make.  I made some changes (don't scold me).  I used chicken breasts with no bone because I did not have the bone in chicken.  I cooked three breasts with all the ingredients in this recipe, plus I put some chicken broth, lemon slices and white cooking wine in the bottom of the pan.  I set the timer for 60 minutes, but then I took them out at about 53 minutes.  They were a little dry, next time I will cook for a shorter amount of time.  I am new to cooking so I am still learning the tricks of the trade.  I will definitely cook this recipe again!

We added about 2T honey to the oil mixture and used seasoned salt instead of the sea salt.  Did not need to broil, skin came out nice and crispy.  WONDERFUL!

Also easy, always moist, delicious, crispy on top: Pour Wishbone Italian Dressing atop split breasts, gently to minimize runoff. Bake 60 minutes at 375, or, better, 45 minutes at 400.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I am not a huge fan of rosemary so I substituted that with sage and I thought the chicken came out fantastic. Nice and crispy too!

Really good and super easy! Took the advice of others and added a few more more herbs and broiled for the last 5 minutes.  Juicy and flavorful.  Will be making again and again.

was happy to try this since it's very simple (right up my alley) -  and soon discovered, very effective! I've done it several times now, each time experimenting with different seasonings. I also found giving it the time in the fridge before baking is pretty pivotal to the flavor outcome. In fact, so flavorful, I use the leftover skin and bones to start my own chicken stock. Very glad I tried it, no more tough white meat chicken!!

I've baked chicken this way for years, it's delicious!  I use salt, black pepper, garlic powder, parsley, sage, rosemary, & thyme. Just sprinkle all on top of the skin, place bone side down on a broiler pan sprayed with cooling spray. I put water in the bottom of the pan, this keeps the inside moist and juicy and lets the skin crisp up beautifully.  Try this chicken, you'll love it!

Great recipe and easy to prepare.  I put the chicken on a low rack in the baking dish to "crisp" all sides rather than under the broiler which tends to dry the meat.  Also, I often cube in large cuts a potato or two with the same ingredients as the chicken (just increase the measurements).  Throw them alongside the chicken in the same dish.  Makes everything simple, and you have a complete meal, adding a salad or steamed veggies.  A tasty recipe with ingredients every good cook should already have in his/her pantry.

Always a winner when I bake this. I marinate the chicken the night before and the outcome is succulent juicy and tasty. I would recommend this as the ingredients are so simple items which is found in most food pantries.

The chicken was delicious! The only problem I had was that the oil started splattering in the oven and the whole house got smoky. Anyone have a tip for avoiding this? Thanks because I want to make this again! I used fresh minced garlic, not powder.

This recipe was awesome! It smelled so good while baking I couldn't wait to try it. The only thing different than recipe was how long it took to bake, but that all depends on size of chicken, so I think that's to be expected. I will definitely make this again and again!

Very tasty chicken indeed!  Easy to prepare as well.  When I took it out of the fridge to put in the oven, it smelled so good.  Smelled even better while baking.  I did put it under the broiler for the last 5 minutes of baking.  My family raved about it.  Will definitely make this again.

This could be one of the tastiest chicken recipes I have ever tried! Made exactly to the recipe, but used less salt. I crushed the dried herbs in a mortar then sprinkled all over the chicken - delicious!!

First, with any meat, if thawed to room temperature or near, the chicken will be considerably more tender. With less cooking time, it is less likely to dry out. Given that, I adjusted the seasonings to preference, cooked two large breast halves for 30 minutes at 375 degrees, then reduced heat to 350 for 15 more minutes. After 45 minutes of bake time, I turned the oven to BROIL and monitored to ensure the skins became brown and crisp without burning (7-10 minutes is typical). There is nothing better than crispy, tasty chicken skins, eaten with the meat or along the side (my preferred method--save the best for last!). Anyway, as with most recipes on this site, this one is good for a beginner. But, don't be afraid to experiment with flavorings and cooking times/temperatures if yours doesn't come out as suggested. Remember, all stoves are not created equal. If your thermostat (or the recipe submitter's) is not accurate, it could be a recipe for disaster. Until you become a "seasoned" cook, pay careful attention and make notes on anything that could have gone wrong...then try, try again!

8.29.16  There are times when simple is best, and that's true here.  Not sure why the chicken had to sit in the fridge for an hour with the garlic-oil mixture on it, but I followed the instructions.  Nice combination of spices resulting in a savory flavor.  I won't eat poultry skin unless it's crisp, and the chicken breast hadn't quite reached that point.  I pulled the skin off (hubs didn't), and those herbs were infused into the meat.  In the future, I'll just plan on putting under the broiler at the end to crisp up the skin.  I used HUGE bone-in chicken breasts, and when I checked the internal temperature at 45 minutes, it was already 185°F.  Next time, I'll start checking at about 25-30 minutes and will try some lemon olive oil I have on hand.   This doesn't take much effort to prepare, and you're rewarded with  moist, juicy, roasted herb-flavored chicken.  Very nice!

I used two giant chicken breasts, so baking took over an hour with several extra minutes under the broiler for a crispy surface. I did moisten the breasts with its drippings a couple of times during baking. Also, I only had minced garlic from a jar and Italian herbs on hand, so used them instead of fresh garlic and the seasoning listed. So easy, so delish.

This chicken is simply amazing!  I've made it multiple times now and it is good as written, but you can also kick it up a notch by slicing half a lemon and placing the breasts on top of the lemon slices and using the other half of the lemon to squeeze over the top.  The skin always comes out deliciously crispy and the meat is extra juicy.  Great recipe!  Enjoy!

I give this a 5 because the simplicity is deceiving to how delicious this turned out. I thought this would be just like any other marinade I've used, but it has its own depth and the chicken was very tender.  I will double the sauce next time, and maybe try different oil like grape oil.  Oh, and I only had chicken breasts (no bone/skin).

I doubled the spices and oil and used a family pack of 10 bone in chicken thighs. I marinated in the fridge for several hours before baking. I cooked for 50 minutes, and then turned the oven to broil for 10 minutes. Came out delicious!

Great recipe! I followed to a T but decided to cut away the skin and put some butter underneath it. Made the chicken very moist. I used about a Tbsp for each breast of can't believe it's not butter. Basted the chicken with a garlic and virgin oil blend... Added seasonings and a little old bay!! Crispy, juicy and a touch of sass!!

Absolutely delicious. It was moist and had a lot of flavor. I did marinate it for several hours which I think helped to pick up the flavors of the herbs.

I always marinate the chicken in terriaki sauce and olive oil w/crushed garlic for about an hour.  Then add whatever spices I feel like having.

Very good recipe.  I prefer the skin on/bone-in chicken.  More flavorful.

Easy and delicious.  The chicken was moist and tasty--perfect!  Based on other reviews I cooked it for an hour at 375 (these breasts were fairly large) and it was not overcooked at all.

Made this tonight, and, unfortunately it didn't turn out right. My chicken came out rubbery, and the meat itself was very bland. All the flavor on the skin (which is generally not eaten).

Followed the recipe exactly with just one large chicken breast because making it for one today.  I added chicken (very small amounts at base of pan) as one member suggested and I basted the breast as I would a whole chicken or turkey.  I let it rest 5 mins. with foil tent to seal in the juices.  Excellent and moist and fragrant from the herbs.  Very nice.

This recipe was amazing!  The chicken came out super moist.  I baked in the oven for 45 mins and broiled it for the last 5 mins.  I also added some onion powder.  Very delicious!!

I make split chicken breasts all the time in the slow cooker, but I've wanted an oven recipe. Chicken was extremely moist, and I baked it for 45 minutes and broiled it for the last 10 minutes. I used fresh rosemary and added more minced garlic. Good base recipe for me, but I think it lacks depth of flavor. Thanks for the start, Prospective PhD!

This is an excellent and easy way to cook with elegant results.

I can't understand how someone (us271934) can rate a recipe   because of their own ignorance.  It's pretty obvious that you, the individual cook need to gauge  the time needed for thickness or weight of the chicken you are going to cook! 

I had 4 very large chicken breasts, bone in, skin on, just looking at them I knew I would have to adjust the cooking time and the amounts of ingredients used.  I do this for everything I cook, it's what experienced cooks do......experiment, it's fun and it's how all cooks learn!   Thank you "Prospective PhD"  for this quick, easy and packed with flavor recipe.

Excellent!  Season according to your meal's  flavor profile.  I cooked 8 large pieces.  BAKED 45 min and then BROILED 15 min to crisp skin.  Rearrange pieces during the broiling process to prevent burning.

This was so easy and SOOO good!! The chicken came out so juicy, it was hard to believe - usually baked chicken breast can be so DRY!  I don't think I'll ever make it a different way.  Thanks for this great recipe!  My chicken breasts were not too small, not too big , so I temped them at 35 min and they were just about done.  Shut the oven off for the last 10 min and they came out perfect!

For God's sake, don't make this for company! I followed the recipe exactly, used fresh, never frozen, chicken, bone-in, with skin, and fresh herbs from my garden. It was moist, but completely tasteless. What a disappointment.

I added a few extra seasonings just for kicks.  I did cook it for 30 minutes covered with foil, 15 without.  I should have just gone without the foil to get a nicely browned and crisp skin.  Will adjust in the future.

Pretty basic Baked Chicken. The person that said that they needed portion numbers and weight, use a thermometer. Add maybe 10 minutes per extra breast starting at 45. Should be fine. Also, if you want to make this not quite as healthy, use a pat of butter on each breast, flip them over about 10 minutes before they are done and it tastes great. But again, its butter so you wont be getting the healthy version.

I cut the skin off cause we're cutting calories . The flavor was delicious . My husband  is fussy but loves it . Cooked them 60 minutes  and let rest 5-8 minutes.  Cooked in Pyrex pan and sprayed with Pam so it wouldn't  stick . I followed  the recipe and baked them at 375 . Some of the breasts were thick but sti cooked to perfection

This is my go-to for split chicken breasts.  I occasionally will put the breasts on a hot grill for a minute or two per side before transferring to the oven.  It crisps up the skin and also gives a nice presentation with the grill marks.

Going into my recipe box, this was super moist and tasty. I normally have bought chicken as boneless skinless but its more affordable to buy bone/skin on, and I'm seeing now where it TASTES better too. I think I will switch to ground rosemary though, I don't like eating the needles.

I shouldn't even rate this because I only used the EVOO, S&P and garlic powder. I was looking for something quick and basic to bake the chicken for chicken salad. After 35 minutes I was at 165 with boneless. Thanks.

I used everything but the basil and substituted rosemary and thyme. I also added a teaspoon of honey to the olive oil and it browned wonderfully! I also used the zest of two lemons on top and sliced the lemons and placed under the chicken breasts. I convection baked at 375 degrees F for 55 minutes and they were juicy and so flavorful! Great starting recipe!

I had four large chicken breasts and struggling for yet another way to cook them. I stumbled on this simple recipe and the breasts were FABULOUS. I will use this recipe going forward. I am sure that the rosemary made the difference, but it was something that I have forgotten to use in a while. BONUS: the house smelled delightful while they were baking and boosted everyone's appetite. Thanks for sharing this great, easy recipe.

Loved this - have cooked it twice in past 2 weeks.  Do you put spices on the bottom of the chicken breasts too or just the top as pictured? I doubled the portion and added to top and bottom of the breasts..  Great recipe that I will use regularly!

The chicken was tender, the smell was fabulous, and the taste was wonderful. I followed the recipe but used fresh rosemary (because it was what I had) and no basil (because I was out).

This was such an easy recipe and looked like I'd spent hours fussing over it.  I recently got a convection oven and decided to use the convection component to experiment.  The results were outstanding!  The chicken was cooked in about 40 minutes - I checked the internal temp - and the skin was lovely and crisp.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

The entire family agreed, This was wonderful!  I followed the directions but broiled it the last 15 minutes and it was fantastic.  Next time I will make twice as much so I have left overs to use in another meal, it was THAT good! Very easy to make and I won't have to buy rotisserie chicken anymore!

So you say you can't cook?No worries with this it's simple delicious and an easy entree.Served with fresh broccoli and stuffing,with a side of cranberry.I had no cracked pepper so I used steak seasoning and since it listed salt as an ingredient cut down on it.

Made it exactly according to the recipe and broiled for the last 10 minutes.  So easy and delicious.  My picky ten year old ate her entire portion.  The chicken was moist and very tasty.  I will be adding this recipe to my regular rotation.

I made this recipe and it was delicious. The chicken was tender and juicy inside with a nice, crisp skin on the outside. Broiled it for about 10 minutes at the end and it came out perfect. This was great for me as I have a tendency to overcook chicken, but this time it came out great!

I baked 3 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts at 375 for 45 minutes and they turned out perfect. Also, covered the baking dish in foil. Great combo of olive oil, garlic and seasonings! Thank you ... This one is a classic.

Making this again...rated five stars a while back. This time, I pulled the skin back and seasoned, then replaced the skin.  (Planning to shred the chicken for another dish,  not including skin.)

I liked this very much. The second time we made it we put all the garlic and seasonings under the skin and then let it marinate in the fridge. The meat had more flavor this time. (As much as we'd love to eat the skin we can't, so putting it under the skin is just better for us).

Absolutely one of my favorites chicken breast recipes!  I am a big fan of chicken thighs because of the tenderness and juiciness but this recipe may convert me!!  I made it exactly as written but I rubbed the oil mixture under the skin as well as all over.  The breasts I had were very big but 60 minutes in the oven and they were baked to perfection.  The skin still crisped even without the broiler.

I had 3 split chicken breasts so I decided to try this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and it took 60 minutes to cook (I used a meat thermometer). As I ate mine, I thought it was really rubbery so I asked my husband how his piece was and he said, “this is terrible!” Not sure why it was so rubbery, but I won’t make this again.

This turned out amazing!  My chicken breasts, even split, were too big for one serving, so I sliced across the grain for a nicer presentation.  I love using bone in chicken recipes.  Leaving the skin on for cooking, and tucking some of that good rub underneath, makes for moister and more flavorful meal, especially if you don't bypass the brief sitting time before cooking.  It's so much tastier than bonless breasts, and as a bonus, makings for homemade chicken broth.  Thank you, Prospective PhD (I hope you've got it by now!)

Absolutely delicious! This will be in our dinner rotation from now on.  It's a flexible recipe - I used the seasonings called for but did not measure.  Roasted in the oven as directed for 50 minutes and the skin was a lovely brown, no need to broil.  I only refrigerated the seasoned breasts in the pan for 20 minutes, short on time.  That didn't seem to affect the outcome!

No changes other then I doubled the garlic. Flavor was mild  with very subtle hints of rosemary or basil. It was rather large breast halves that required 3-4 minutes in oven. Meat was moist  while the skin was crispy. My daughter and I enjoyed.

Added a little dried thyme and made a slit in the breasts which I stuffed with chopped garlic. Though not normally a fan of chicken breast I found this to be very good and juicey. I would make it again.

I made this tonight. I used pretty much all the ingredients listed. This was a huge bone -in chicken breast 1 lb & 4oz so I expected it to take more than an hour. But fortunately I checked it at 45 minutes and it was almost done. I put it under the broiler after about another 10 minutes and almost forgot about it. It was pretty crispy and was delicious. Very juicy inside. Will definitely be making this often.

It’s so good, I’ve been telling my friends about this recipe!  My tips, since I’ve made it several times already:
1. Get big ole chicken breasts and bake for the full hour. 
2. Add thick sliced carrots and potatoes to the leftover marinade and tuck between or under the breasts. 
3. Serve it boneless with crispy skin by slicing off the top half of the (big) chicken breast, leaving the bottom bony half to cool and shred later for leftovers. 
4. Your house will smell like garlic, but the chicken won’t taste garlicky.  Omit the garlic if you object to the scent. Your house will smell awesome either way.

Really nice recipe that can be adjusted to taste by switching up the spices.  Great basic, tho, and I appreciate the cooking times given.  I cut slits in the chicken under the skin and put some of the marinade in those as well as on top of the skin.  Marinaded for about an hour in the fridge, then sprinkled with lemon juice.  Used Italian seasoning instead of rosemary; Greek seasoning would work just as well.  Roasted 48 minutes until internal temp reached 165, then broiled for 3 minutes.  So flavorful and juicy!  Thanks for the recipe!  A keeper for sure!

Definitely go heavy on the spices. For good measure, I did an additional crop-dusting of "Italian spices" blend, which I think is sage, thyme, rosemary, and oregano. The juice in the pan ended up being so nice. 

Might also benefit with just a touch of citrus, maybe orange or lemon zest to brighten it up a little.

This has become my go-to chicken roast. I've done it with different seasonings, even smothered in bbq sauce during the last 15-20 minutes.  The rosemary version is top notch. but I also have used a generous shake of McCormick's grill mates Montreal Chicken Seasoning.. I'm going to try also their Rotisserie seasoning.   My tip would be, if the breast are frozen It can take about an hour to reach 165 f. I just keep checking and always let it rest 10 minutes before serving. Keeps it juicy and tender.

I have made your recipe many times and it's always great.  Sometimes I fiddle around with the spicing.  And I would add that, for browning, a quite shallow baking vessel works best.  Cheers!

I didn't have bone in chicken breast on hand so I substituted boneless. As another stated cover 45 minutes and uncover broil for 10 more minutes. I also let the chicken sit for 5 minutes before serving. This was PERFECT chicken! I recieved compliments from my picky family on this being the best chicken ever. Thanks for the submission.

Just had this last night and it was delicious! Will definitely be making again. I doubled the marinade (added a bit of cayenne and paprika) and rubbed it under the skin and on top of the skin. I made three breasts with back attached in a cast iron skillet -- after adding the marinade, I let it marinate for a few hours. Added a bit of chicken broth and baked for an hour. Delicious! Crispy skin and moist, tender meat.

Turned out pretty good. Used very large chicken breasts so they took a little longer to cook but was able to take it out at a good time since I monitored the inside temperature. I freehanded the measurements and used avocado oil and it was a nice combination. I added oregano and used regular salt instead. I heeded some advice and broiled the last 10 minutes to get a nice crispy chicken. Would make it again with smaller chicken next time and less salt.

This was pretty amazing!!! Leftovers next day were even more flavorful and juicy. I used lots of fresh garlic and fresh herbs.  Fresh herbs make a huge difference. Adding this to a regular rotation. Great recipe. Did I mention easy? Easy and yummy. Total win for our family. Thanks for sharing!

Very good!  I doubled the recipe, cooking 4 split breasts.  Prepared it the day before, placed in baking dish, and covered with foil.  Husband placed it in oven while I was at work.  Also put a few [baked] red potatoes in the oven.  I got home from work, removed the potatoes, removed the foil, baste the breast with pan juices, turned the oven to broil and cooked for an additional 13 minutes.  It was absolutely delicious (and pretty). Will definitely make this again.

I used double the herbs and spices, on both sides of the breasts.  The flavor was very good and I'd make these again.  I did broil the skin side the last ten minutes,  for a crispy side.

This was a really great baked chicken. Just the right flavors and so moist. I wasn’t able to cook it the evening I planned so it stayed in the refrigerator marinating for more than 24 hours and turned out great. 
I’ll make it again.

This was delicious! For the reviewer who mentioned broiling, there’s no mention of broiling the chicken. This is a baking recipe. Bake your chicken. I skipped putting mine in the fridge and it still tasted amazing. Didn’t use split chicken breasts  just the breast and drumstick that came in the fryer pack. Yum!! I added purple, rose and golden baby potatoes, carrots, diced sweet potato varieties to include the purple stokes sweet potato. So satisfying and sweet that it’s helping to curb the sweet tooth I crave after

I basically followed recipe as written but used seasonings on hand and sprayed olive oil on.  Super juicy and tasty!  My 8 year olds didn't "like" it and only ate half (lunch for me!) but what do they know about tasty?

Tender, moist and tasty. Very easy way to do a chicken dinner. Will use this again; maybe changing some of the seasonings. If you don't want to work hard to get dinner on the table then this dish is for you.

Very easy recipe & chicken comes out delicious.  I also added lemon juice.  As one person suggest, putting broiler on last few minutes made chicken more crispy. Having a meat thermometer comes in handy to cook to perfection.

I followed the instructions to the letter, with the exception of removing the skin, and the result was wonderful! Hubby usually does split breasts on the grill, but it was chilly and rainy, so this recipe was a perfect excuse to fire up the oven!  We both really enjoyed this flavorful moist chicken! Thank  You!!

Easy and surprisingly delicious.   First time cooking with split chicken breasts, definitely a new go to recipe.

I used skinless split chicken breasts, but everything else was the same.  Came out absolutely delicious and very moist.  It was nice and easy as well.  Will definitely make again.

I think this is a great basic recipe. I did a few tweaks. We don't like rosemary in this house so I omitted. I used garlic powder, Himalayan pink salt, cracked pepper, onion powder and paprika and rubbed it all over the bone in chicken thighs I had. Husband does not usually like dark meat but he loved these he said the skin was so crispy and the meat was very tender and juicy.

I found it was taking to long, so after 30 min, I turned oven to 400. Still took 1hr 15 min for the meat to reach 165 degrees. For the last 5 min I turned on the broiler.
Yum!

I triple this recipe and bake in Pyrex baking dishes for my large family. The chicken cooks perfectly every time. Cook to proper temps, checking with a meat thermometer, to prevent dryness. It is easy to modify for different needs by adjusting the seasoning. Absolutely tastes just as good as leftovers. We usually eat as a main course the first day and then use on salad, casserole, or skillet meals the next day.

Easy and delish baked chicken. I cooked till 170 temperature and still juicy. Would like the skin crispy next time, maybe broil the last 5minutes or so.

Maybe I did something wrong but, I made this last night and we did not enjoy. Followed the recipe exactly but the chicken was tough and, aside from the skin, the chicken had zero flavor. Would not make again.

I used rosemary, basil, thyme and oregano and two olive oils (a light one and a stronger one I brought back from Tuscany, Italy), used two large chicken breasts I sliced into one inch slices, and baked for 30 mins covered and another 10 uncovered to get brown on top.  Very yummy and tangy taste and will do again!!  served with pasta (tossed in olive oil) and steamed broccoli.  Easily served 4 people.

Absolutely a winner! Easy,  fast  and delicious. from prep to plate in under an hour. It's summer and I don't use my oven.  I have a propane grill,  I preheat to the temperature I need,  place the chicken on the top rack in a 9x13 glass casserole.  At 375° it was done in 50 minutes. Chicken was juicy. skin was crisp...

Smells wonderful while baking in the air fryer!  1/4 cup is way too much olive oil.  Just pour a SMALL amount and brush on meat.

This is a great and easy recipe! Used my own concoction of spices, rosemary, thyme,  lemon pepper, parsley. Halved a few  gold yukon potatoes  and seasoned them the same. Every time I make it I change it up a bit. It's always good!

This recipe was nice and moist.  I was worried as my bone in breasts were huge.  I did cook it 10 minutes longer.  I wanted this to be a one pan meal so I  cut up bite size pieces of broccoli.  Put the 2 chicken pieces in middle and placed the broccoli, sliced onions and cubed russet potatoes on either side.  Poured a little olive oil over veggies and chicken.    We rate recipes at home and save them.  We rated this recipe excellent.

Soaked two chicken breasts with mixture and third cup of white wine over night .  I then browned it and pored all the left over marinade into Instapot along with chicken. Cooked for 14 min. with natural release. It turned out so tasty and moist.  I made a sauce with left over juice with a butter flour rue to serve with it. We loved it and I love my Instapot. Thanks !!

A perfect blend of ingredients making the chicken so moist and tasty!  I first made with thin sliced chicken breasts and cooked for 45 minutes and was so impressed with how moist it was.  I also love how quick and easy the prep time is.  Thank you for this great recipe!

So easy that I almost felt guilty when my husband raved it was the best chicken he has had in a longtime.  I normally cook a large variety of more complex recipes from this site to keep from getting bored.  Maybe I need to go back to basics for awhile.

I made it exactly as directed besides letting it sit for 45 minutes, and I don't know if that would have made it any better it was  sooo delicious. I made it for my husband and my brother, they both loved it and went in for seconds!! Highly recommended.Chicken breasts were pretty large so I cook them on 380 for about an hour and 15 minutes.

My first time baking a split chicken breast and this recipe did not disappoint. Quick, easy and tasty. I used dried basil and some Italian spices mix, the rest of the recipe kept as is.  Baked for about 55 minutes, maybe an hour. My family loved it!

Excellent. The chicken was moist and the skin was crispy. Plus it was so easy to make. Will make again. We had friends over and they loved it. I have shared the recipe as they asked for my secret. 
Great recipe, simple, easy, Delicious

I made this with the Healthier oven roasted potatoes. Very easy to make and was delicious. I don't know why people complained that it had no flavor...mine tasted like chicken.  What was it supposed to taste like? Banquet? Go buy Banquet. I like the taste of chicken so why would I cover that up with a bunch of herbs and seasonings? I just like to enhance the flavor a little. A very good recipe. Will continue using this recipe.

I am sure I followed this recipe. There isn't enough taste to the chicken.  The next day I cut up one breast and cooked some more, and it came out quite juicy.  Yet it still tasted like paper.

So easy, and flavorful, tender, juicy... 
I used fresh rosemary sprigs that I stuffed into slits in the breast. I only had one breast; baking took 45 mn, inside was 185 degrees.

Added some thyme. It was delicious, not dry at all.  Broiled for the last 10 minutes. Everything was eaten, no leftovers. Will make again.

This was easy and delicious! The whole family enjoyed it. We made 6 breasts and as mentioned, it was a cinch to up the recipe to cover all the chicken. I will definitely make this again...and soon!

Only way to get the chicken to look like the picture is to bake it covered until the last 10 - 20 minutes.  Then take-off the lid or foil covering if using a foil pan (which is what I use), then crank-up the heat to 450-degrees.  Once the top is browned, flip the chicken onto each  side for further browning.  Don't use the broiler or you may burn the skin.  If you feel you must use the broiler, DO NOT leave the chicken unattended.  Watch it, particularly if your broiler has too many variables; like mine.  The skin can burn pretty rapidly.

I make this all the time and I love it! I also like to add the Roasted Parmesan Rosemary Potatoes to the same pan and cook them together. Both turn out great! Super easy meal that your family will think you slaved over.

Have been making chicken this way for years and it always comes out moist with crispy skin. Leaving the skin on allows it to self baste and using bone in breasts helps keep moisture in. Such a versatile recipe as you can vary your spices (try squeezing lemon juice over the top before serving) and I rarely make just what we need, cooking several on a big sheet pan lined with foil. Chicken cooked this way is great for chicken salad or any recipe that calls for cooked chicken. Let the chicken cool a bit and it pulls easily away from the bone and the skin peels right off.

This is a delicious dish.  It is fairly easy to make too.  I marinated it overnight in a Ziplock bag.  I massaged it to get the flavor in. Also, after baking for 60 min at 350 degrees, I increased the temperature to 400 degrees for another 15 minutes. I will be making it again for sure!

This recipe was fantastic! The only change I had was that I added chicken broth to the dish that I cooked the chicken in, and covered it with tin foil. It came out so juicy!

This recipe is so easy and so delicious.  I tried it on a whim as I am by far no Chef.  Anyway, have been using this recipe and cooking this yummy, moist chicken every other week for almost 6 mths. now.  It's a winner and the skin is oh' so good.  Highly recommended for all.

This is a fabulous recipe - so simple and super quick to prepare. Makes absolutely delicious tender, juicy and very flavorful chicken breasts with very crispy skin.  I always forget to start dinner in time, so I have not refrigerated first and it's still excellent.  Nice to adjust seasonings to your taste.  I make extra and bring to lunch during the week sliced in my salad or in a sandwich.

Instead of chicken breast I made a whole chicken and boy was it delicious! I rubbed it with the olive oil, seasonings and the herbs and placed in my refrigerator uncovered for about four hours. The chicken was flavored all the way through the skin to the meat and we absolutely loved it. Great recipe!

This was the perfect recipe for simple baked chicken breasts that resulted in a crispy skin and well-seasoned chicken all the way through the meat.   I also added some lemon pepper to the seasoning.

This was delicious and so easy to make. The only thing I will change is baking at 425 for 30 minutes instead. I think the meat would turn out much more moist. The rest was spot on. We loved this!

The ONLY thing I changed was that I added a teaspoon of lemon pepper instead of regular pepper. It was perfect! I doubled the recipe and it took about 50 minutes (they were very big chicken breasts). I took them out and let them rest for 10 minutes, then served them. My son-in-law had thirds!

Hello love this recipe. I did add a few different spices because I didn't have all the ingredients I just used fresh garlic minced in the small jar  and sea salt black pepper and BADIA Complete seasonings and cajun seasoning and chicken bouillon with a little water in the baking pan and it came out great seasoning to your liking of course.

This chicken had very nice flavor but I did add salt to the dry ingredients.  I also cooked the chicken for 90 minutes.  Easy, tasty recipe.

This was THE most moist chicken ever! I did things a bit different, as I had a time crunch. I read that baking it in chicken broth makes it moist, so I poured 1 cup in the bottom of the pan. I then stabbed the chicken all over with a knife. I mixed all the ingredients in a bowl and just poured it over the chicken. I didn't have time to marinate it in the frig at all. I cooked it uncovered to the correct internal temp recommended (basting with the broth every 15 min.) and OMG!!! It's the BEST chicken that I can remember for a loooong time! So Yummy and boy is it Moist!!

I made this just as written.  I did exactly as the instructions read.  I tested the meat with my instant read thermometer for a minimum of 165 degrees.  The chicken was fairly juicy but not very flavorful.  Maybe my taste buds are dead!  My chicken looked just like the picture above.  Probably won't make again.

I wanted something simple for the split breasts I had on hand and this was perfect. The split breasts I had were quite thick so I did need to add some time to the baking (it was aprox 10 min). Love the flavor went great with the rice and broccoli I made to go with it.

If you like your chicken breast to taste like shoe leather, cook it to 165 as this ridiculous recipe suggests.. No chicken breast should ever get close to that temp, bone in or no bone.  Keep searching for another approach.

So good! I made this when I was sick and it made me feel so much better! Make it with some colorful vegetables and you will have a gourmet meal! It is perfect for a night in or a simple meal with the family. I substituted some herbs and mixed in my own combinations with what I like and it turned out perfect! Everyone in my family loved it and especially it's wonderful smells! It was so easy! Good luck!

I made this last weekend for my family., they loved it!! So much so, my daughter asked me to make it again this weekend! I didn't have all the seasonings needed, so I improvised and used garlic powder, salt, pepper, basil and Rachel Rays Poultry seasoning, but otherwise followed directions, putting breasts in fridge for 45 minutes. Btw, we are having it again this weekend! Thanks for sharing, this was easy and tasty!

I made this with chicken thighs, with bone in and skin on . I don't have sea salt so I used regular table salt. I baked them on my gas grill over indirect heat. I kept the temp at 350 degrees for 50 minutes, they turned out very good.

Mostly followed the recipe. Used fresh rosemary, threw in a little lemon thyme, can't remember but maybe some fresh parsley. Very very good. The whole family loved it.

Loved it! I ended up mixing all the herbs and garlic into the oil and brushing it onto boneless chicken breasts. They only took about 1/2 hr to cook and were very juicy without marinating first.

Made this tonight and was delightly surprised at how good it came out. Simplicity is pretty much the way I try to go and this was just that. Followed the recipe and it is moist and delicious.  There was about a 1/4 cup of drippings and olive oil left over, so I sprinkled some Wondra in, microwaved it for about 45 seconds and ended up with a little gravy for whatever. The chicken was fine without it but can add to veggies if I so desire. Definitely a keeper. Thank you for a good and simple chicken recipe.

I added celery salt, paprika and banana peppers, sliced lengthwise. I also added carrots, zuchinni, yellow squash & celery  and lightly seasoned with celery salt. I also added a bit more garlic and diced oninions. It was delicious!

I made this per the instructions, but the flavor just wasn't there.  I'll make it again using the recipe as a starting point,  but will definitely add to or change the seasonings.  Still, it's my kind of recipe - one that's open to minor changes.

Made this a while back and it was very tasty even though I didn't  have all the ingredients I needed.

Will definitely make this again in the near future.

I gave this 5 stars because I couldn't ask my question without rating it.   The picture shows a boneless skinless breast and the recipe calls for a bone in breast with skin.  Is the picture wrong?

We left out the garlic (long story) and it was still delicious.  Hubby and I and 2 teenage daughters said it was the best chicken we've had in a long time.  Perfectly juicy and flavorful.

I made it as it was didn't have time to let it sit for an hour, but it tasted fine. I made pasta in another pot steamed some broccoli  and put the broccoli in the chicken juice and rolled it in that. I also heated some canned tomatoes in garlic and olive oil.  Plated it with Chicken on side and pasta mixed with broccoli and tomatoes.  I would make it again. I also had boned skinless chicken so I covered with foil so it wouldn't dry out.

Delicious!  I followed the instructions as given & was very happy with the results!  I made 10 Chicken breasts with the skin on for a family gathering and it still only took 45 minutes to cook. I did broil them for the last 10 minutes to crisp up the skin.

This is by far one of the best dishes I have ever made, and my husband agrees. I added some fresh rosemary, tucking it under the skin, and this enhanced the flavor.  I also broiled the breasts for a few minutes to crisp them up and deglazed the pan with white wine. Oh, and I used my faithful iron skillet, a must.

This was delicious everyone raved about it the only thing I did different was to soak the breasts in a brine solution  for about an hour previous to doing anything. The breasts came out moist and delicious. They were cooked without covering them. Also I sprayed the breasts with an olive oil spray instead of rubbing them.

Love this yummy yet easy recipe! Followed the recipe as written then decided to add olive and seasoning under the skin too - tender, juicy and flavorful. Use any seasoning you desire, it always comes out good.  Served with steamed broccoli and homemade mac and cheese; now a family favorite.  PS  I leave the chicken in the oven for a full hour and sometimes even remove it and cover with foil (to rest) if still cooking veggies.

I've been making my chicken similar to this, with the exception of pan frying it in less olive oil before baking it for the "chrispiness". I switched it up to this way and it came out the same, just helped me skip the frying step! Thanks! I always fear the broiler... Maybe I should embrace it! Cheers!

Very good for a basic roast chicken recipe. Easy to follow. Turned out great! Moist and tender!Will be using leftovers to include in white chicken chili form tomorrow.  I even used some chicken legs as well for this recipe to satisfy hubby who loves legs:) Thank You!

I  took the general idea and used what was in the house. I actually had fresh rosemary and thyme and mixed it  with the garlic, kosher salt and olive oil making a paste and rubbed the paste  mostly under the skin. I spread a little more olive oil, some paprika for color on top of the skin, and then popped it in the oven. These breast were really big and after 40 minutes at 375 they had not reached 165 degrees so I upped the temp to 400 for another 15 minutes. Beautiful! My kitchen smelled glorious!

Great. The tip on broiling it at the end for a few minutes is also great. Threw in 1/4 teaspoon of thyme.

The aroma that filled the house, when these were in the oven was mouth watering. The chicken came out juicy and delicious. 
I cooked 4 bone in chicken breasts and eyeballed the rest of the ingredients. 45 minutes was plenty of time to cook medium size breasts.  I served with roasted Brussel sprouts and black rice.
Looking forward to recycling the leftovers in a quesedilla or a sandwich, for my lunch tomorrow. .

Most flavorful chicken I've made in quite a while.  DD requested we have it again tomorrow...next time I'll plan for leftovers!  I don't understand why US271934 had complaints - I don't see "broil" mentioned anywhere in the recipe - unless I'm not seeing it correctly.

This is a winner. I didn't think such a simple recipe could be so tasty. The key to making it successful was marinating the chicken long enough and perhaps poking a few holes in the chicken so that maybe it'll bake more evenly? (The breasts came out of the oven puffy but once it was cut into it was not, but that doesn't matter!) My 13 month old baby was very eager to eat it since it was infused with flavor yet tender. I will definitely make it again and maybe in multiples, as I can store some shredded in the freezer for future meals.

This recipe is really easy to make.  You combine the ingredients with the chicken, refrigerate it for a while and then bake it.  The result is flavorful, moist chicken.

It was alright, very easy and the meat was tender. However, I followed the recipe to a t and found it to be very bland.

Great recipe. Very flavourful. I found the 45 min in the oven to be slightly too long. Next time I will check temperature of the chicken after 30-35 min.

Excellent recipe!  I went ahead and added in lemon juice...great flavors.  It took my chicken a bit longer to cook as they were huge pieces of meat.  My Mom couldn't stop raving about this and actually ate a whole piece by herself and even chewed on the bones!  I will be using this recipe often!

Better than I thought it would turn out, and the ingredients are better for you than most recipes I find. It was moist and flavorful, and my boyfriend said my house smelled like something good was cooking when he came over for dinner. I'm keeping this one. I followed the recipe closely, but I used 3 organic boneless/skinless chicken breasts. I also cooked it for the full 1 hour. It's good with a side of mashed potatoes and some mixed vegetables.

5-20-15 Used this recipe tonight and everyone loved it. I did use bone in skin on thigh/drumstick. Didn't refrigerate, just went straight into preheated oven. Big pieces of chicken, and left in oven for 60 minutes. The flavor was outstanding. Crispy skin and moist meat. My Mr. made the comment that he really doesn't care for chicken, but really liked this chicken I prepared. Great recipe, It's going into my keeper folder, and I will be using this recipe again. Thank you for sharing. *Up Date* 5-21-15 We had the left over chicken tonight, and my Mr. again said "This is the best chicken you have made". I just had to let the submitter know this. Thanks again Prospective PhD

It was awesome very moist and easy to make.  I turned the broiler for the last 5 minutes but skin did not crisp up. I may not have had it close enough to the broiler.

Making this again! My family loves it! New twist tonight! Lemon, butter , dill, s&p. I also pull back the skin & make little cuts in the breast meat. Making sure my spices make it all up in there! Pull the skin back over adding a lil spices to the skin then bake. Adds more flavor into the chicken & the breast is still nice & moist!

it was very easy and very good.  I held back on the olive oil because it seemed excessive.  After baking it for a while and realizing I needed the full amount to baste it, I will not hold back next time.
It was very flavorful and easy.  My husband loved it!

I make this recipe every other week.  It is so easy and the chicken always comes out tender and flavorful.  I never made bone-in chicken breasts before, and it makes a huge difference!  I follow the recipe exactly and it's wonderful.

I followed the instructions, plus the extra tip of 10-15 minutes before being done to put oven on broil for a crispy skin. Beautiful presentation and so juicy. It was so good Friday, I am making it again today, which is Sunday.

ehhh...nothing exciting about this recipe without making changes to it. I added more herbs, garlic and onion powder. The flavor was ok but the chicken was a bit dry.

I make something very similar to this, but I put the rosemary under the skin and I put lemon slices in the bottom of the baking dish and put the chicken on top of the lemon. I also add a pat of butter on top of each breast. So good!!
