Tried it this year for the first time; I try a different recipe "rotate" every year, to go along with our "regular"fare over the Thanksgiving / Christmas holidays.  I do believe this will become one of the "regulars"! It was definitely a hit! Thank you for sharing!

Made a few changes to the recipe even though it was the first time I tried it.  I cut one egg and replaced with applesauce and only cut in a tablespoon of butter.  It was fabulous!  Love the flavor!

This dish is amazing!  Oh the memories.....when I was a child my mom use to make this every sunday. her kids running in and out of the kitchen door slamming the screen door waiting for it to get done. My mom yelling don't slam that screen door. the aroma would engulf the entire house and outdoor as well. i used to love it. This is very close to her recipe. This is very good, i did not change a thing to the recipe. Very well done. Can't wait to make this for my brothers.  Thanks for the memories

This is one of those interesting recipes that you’re not quite sure how to rate it.  I thought the flavor was good, but I didn’t care for the texture.  My husband, who never eats sweet potato, ate it.  Who knew?  I added the coconut and chopped pecans.   For me, I’ll stick with the cooked mashed sweet potato in casseroles; however I’m glad I tried this.  It was interesting.

Not like a pudding at all.  Sweet, but the texture was unappealing.
