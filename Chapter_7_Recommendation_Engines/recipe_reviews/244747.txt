One thing that I didn’t care for in this recipe was that the oil never incorporates itself into the sauce as butter does.  I ended up spooning off the oil that was layered/separated on the top.  After I took the photo, I put the sauce into my mini blender (more dirty dishes) because we didn’t care for the minced garlic (maybe just our personal preference for a "smooth" sauce).  Finally, the cornstarch-water addition at the end just didn’t make sense to me because the sauce already was plenty thick...I didn’t add it.  The spiciness level was spot on, and the taste was OK, but I doubt I’ll be using this again for chicken wings.
