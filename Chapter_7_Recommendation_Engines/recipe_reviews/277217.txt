This has a nice spiciness that gingerbread should have---not overwhelming at all. It boggles my mind that another reviewer would make gingerbread cheesecake--with strong flavors such as molasses and warm spices--and complain about a lack of cream cheese flavor. This has a perfect combo of tang from the cream cheese, dark sweetness of molasses, and a good hit of spices. If you want solid cream cheese flavor, then eat a brick of cream cheese. If you want a cheesecake that tastes like a good gingerbread, then make this cheesecake. (Also, you can make the crust crisper by pre-baking it before adding the filling. Really quite easy to do. Otherwise, you will have a rather nice soft, chewy, gingery cookie crust  when made as written.)

It tasted great, but the cinnamon cream definitely needs more cinnamon than the recipe calls for.  I layered the cream atop the cake as I don’t have fancy decorating tools.  You’ll need about six hours to complete this cake.

Yum!  This was really good!  Because of the previous review, I went easy on the spices, and  I didn't have any allspice. I thought it was just right!  Will make again.

Recipe worked well enough, base layer didnt come out as crunchy as you would expect a typical Graham layer. Also the spice was overwhelming and you lost a lot of cream cheese flavour. If I were to make it again I'd half the spices (other than cinnamon) and maybe do a 50/50 gingerbread Graham crust.
