It was good, but I made some changes. Replaced the onion powder with a small red onion chopped. Replaced the garlic powder with three cloves of garlic smashed and minced. Cut up chicken when raw and then cooked with the onion and added the garlic during the last minute. Subbed a triple cheddar blend for the cheddar and an Italian 6 cheese blend for the mozzarella.
