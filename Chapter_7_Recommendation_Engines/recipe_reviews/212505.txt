This was awesome. I used red curry paste and doubled the milk, cream cheese and white pepper.

Made recipe  exactly as written, and it was great!!! I have never used green curry paste (always used red) so I was interested as to the flavor of the dish.  It is much milder than red, I thought it was wonderful...more family friendly...little ones could eat this curry.  This dish is creamy, colorful, easy, nutritious.  I served it with Asian Coconut Rice from this site.  OUTSTANDING

Yummy! I followed recommendations and tried this with double the milk, cream cheese, and white pepper (very creamy) and the curry turned out deliciously! The only problem I had was finding green curry paste, I ended up using Kikkoman's Thai Yellow Curry Sauce which I'm 90% sure is more mild than green curry paste. I would love to try this recipe again with all ingredients as is just so I know what the original tastes like. Thanks for the recipe!

We tried this recipe a few days ago with shrimp, and it was fantastic! We also substituted yogurt for cream cheese, and it still had a great flavor. I added garlic and extra curry -- but it didn't need it. Tonight we're trying it with chicken because its so easy and quick!

This recipe worked up wonderfully!  I didn't have green or any other kind of curry paste but i had some wonderful powder form a local company and used that instead.  My husband went back for thirds

I felt that the sauce was way too thick and I even cut back an ounce of the cream cheese. I would have preferred a thinner, tastier sauce to accompany the rice. I also made a mistake and put it on top of coconut rice and with the thick sauce it was way too heavy.

Wonderful dish! We are wimps when it comes to spice at my house, "Minnesota Mild" if you will. So I made a few adjustments to the recipe based off other reviewers.  To make it more mild and edible for us, I used 1tsp of curry powder (added to the chicken after it was done cooking and just before adding the veggies, mushrooms and peas in our case). I also doubled the cream cheese, milk and pepper.  We will DEFINITELY be making this again!

Being allergic to coconut, I was excited to find a curry chicken recipe that doesn't use coconut milk. We followed the recipe exactly except we used red curry paste. My husband thought it tasted nothing like the real curry chicken that he always eats at Thai restaurants. I thought it was pretty good but very spicy (I am kinda wimpy with hot food). We will definitely make this again. We will probably experiment with doubling the milk to make it soupier. Thanks for a good recipe!

My husband thought this dish was delicious, but it was WAY TOO SPICY for us!  He was sweating and I couldn't really finish the meal.  Good flavors, but we'll use half the amount of curry next time.  We did use the green curry.  It was easy to make and most of the ingredients were things we already had around, so that was nice.

Wow that was spicy! A bit too spicy for my husband, but I loved it. It would have been nice with more sauce, and seemed like there were too many bell peppers, so I think next time I will double the cream cheese and milk, and cut the bell peppers in half.

OMG!  I have never cooked anything Thai before but have enjoyed it in restaurants.  My husband has always stayed away from it.  I found some green curry paste in the store and thought I would give this recipe a try.  I had all the ingredients on-hand except for the green pepper so I substituted mushrooms.  We are on a low-carb lifestyle so we passed on the rice and just ate the chicken/sauce.  My husband could NOT stop raving about how good it was!!  This will be my new go-to recipe for company, as well for us.

This was reasonably tasty and easy to do, but not authentic at all, which I didn't really expect it to taste authentic anyway. I recommend doubling all the sauce ingredients (including the green curry paste). I used Thai Kitchen green curry and it was not hot to us. Thanks for sharing!

This was pretty good and fairly easy. The only thing I added was more curry. The cream cheese drowned out a lot of the initial spice.

This recipe was good but not great.  I will make this again but I will use less cream cheese and more curry.  I added frozen peas too and it was good.

This was very good, but hotter than I thought it would be though. I rarely follow a recipe to the letter and this time was no exception. The changes I made this time: I used peanut oil, yellow pepper in place of the green pepper, and I found that the only cream cheese I had in the house had strawberries in it. I look forward to making this again.

I made this tonight, trying to make my foray into a different area of cooking, and LOVED it!  Even my husband, who has scoffed at my previous efforts into this cuisine, liked it.  I did make a couple of changes, based on what was on sale at the grocery store (which I think is a huge strong point for this recipe.)  I used a red and yellow pepper and used coconut milk instead of regular milk (only because I saw it in the aisle while I was looking for green curry paste and thought, "Hmmm...why not?)  I also added some mushrooms that I had that were about to go bad.  I have a feeling that the leftovers, however few, will be even better tomorrow.  This is a great recipe to use up leftover veggies in your fridge, and it's fairly quick.  Definitely will make again.  Thanks for making my husband forget about my failed attempt at peanut noodles!

I made this but I used what I had in my fridge rather going to the store. So I had red curry sauce, chicken thighs and asparagus (instead of green pepper). It turned out to be really good. Next time, I will add a bit more spice and try it with chicken breasts and quartered mushrooms as well. This can be a very versatile dish and allow additions without impacting the basic flavors.  A keeper!

For those that used powder, use paste next time, it has a better flavor. Make sure to fry the paste in the pan before mixing it with anything, it brings out the flavor..

I didn't have any other veggies except onion and asparagus. I used that instead of bell and red pepper and this turned out yummy!! I also added about half teaspoon of shrimp paste to sauce. It made it taste more Thai! I loved the thick sauce served over jasmine rice.

this tastes not at all thai, and is extremely bland. the sauce is thick and tastes primarily of cream cheese. while not inedible, i felt like i was eating end-of-semester-surprise at the dining hall back in college. it's a disjointed creation that doesn't deliver on flavor.

The cream cheese frowns out every other flavor. This doesn’t taste like curry at all. It’s just an overwhelming hit of dairy with each bite. Thai food doesn’t typically use dairy, so that should have been my first warning. This would probably be good if you don’t like Thai food or curry, but you like cream cheese.

Tasted amazing and creamy! I used 8 oz of cream cheese and it tasted great (I love cream cheese!) I also added a tsp of salt to bring out the taste.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious! I made this with the Asain Coconut rice recipe. Next time I might try red curry paste instead, just to add  a little spice :)

I love this recipe!! I didn't have large bell peppers on hand so I used the small baby bell peppers.  They gave the dish lots of color (red, yellow, orange). I also used shrimp instead of chicken for a nice Friday meal.  It turned out just as good.  Maybe next time I'll try with red curry paste for a different flavor.  It's an easy go to recipes for my family.  Even passes the leftover test....when there are leftovers, which is almost never.

I would definitely make it again, but would probably spice it up a bit. I was cooking for a group of 10, 6 of them children, so it suited the situation. It was very easy and the kids enjoyed it, even though the parents said that they didn't usually eat onions.

The first time I made this I  followed the recipe except for cutting the amount of green curry paste in half. My partner doesn't like things too highly seasoned, so I thought that would be a safe place to start. We both agreed that it could use more seasoning than that, so last night when I made a similar dish with substituting shrimp for chicken, I used close to the original amount of curry paste, about 5 teaspoons instead of the 2 tablespoons called for in the recipe. That was an acceptable compromise for us. My partner would have preferred a little less, and I'd have been happy with more.  Last night I also decided to increase the sauce a bit by adding an additional 1/4 cup of milk. To thicken the sauce, I then added one teaspoon of cornstarch. The result was an acceptable sauce for our tastes. Thanks for a terrific recipe. I can see that I'll be able to use it as a basic and make many interesting variations from it.

This was an easy dish when I didn't have coconut  milk but wanted curry.  The cream cheese made it very decadent; probably more so that I would have liked.  I'll probably stick to coconut milk in the future, but this worked in a pinch.

Pretty good.  This was my first foray into cooking with green curry paste- or any curry paste for that matter.  I made it exactly as directed.  I ended up adding a little curry powder to it after I tasted it.  I also made the coconut rice to go with it as suggested by another.

This is excellent! I don't normally give reviews but this one has me actually sitting and enjoying it with my 2yr. old and 3 yr. old granddaughters and my daughter. Just a pinch of salt or it would have been a 5!

Delicious. Made with red curry paste and doubled the chicken for higher protein/meal. ALL 5 KIDS ATE IT....WITHOUT COMPLAINING! Aged 15mo to 12 yr. Success in my book!

Followed recipe exactly as stated - for 12. Came out beautifully - orginally wanted a standard curry (yellow?) dish but this was GOOD. The green curry paste lent a unique but not over-powering flavour to the dish. Served up on white rice - got lots of compliments.
