Well it's my recipe and I love it, obviously :) If you don't like cilantro, omit the coriander. It's the same plant. It'll leave a soapy aftertaste if you are part of the population bearing a gene that makes cilantro/coriander taste bad. Cheers!

Slow Cooker Turkey Chili with Kidney Beans Haiku: "Not sure bout this one. Daughter loved it, I was 'meh', had odd aftertaste." I can't put my finger on what was peculiar about the aftertaste in this chili, and re-reading the ingredients, I'm still scratching my head, unless it had something to do w/ the coriander, cocoa powder, beef base and/or sugar, which are ingredients I haven't typically used in my chilis. I followed the recipe as written, except, per cook's notes, subbing ground beef for the turkey and bell pepper for the anaheim. I'd hover around 3.5 stars on this one if only I could detect what about all of those ingredients (of which several were probably unnecessary) gave this a strange (but not unpleasant) flavor.
