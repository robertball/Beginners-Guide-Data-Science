I used red pepper instead of black olives, and ditched the heavy cream doubling the milk. Delicious.

I substituted red onions, sliced in rings for extra color.  Instead of olives, I used about a tablespoon of capers and sauted those with the onions. I'd definitely make this again for a special brunch.

I didn't have an oven safe skillet, but I just transferred the frittata to a round pan, and it came out great! The cream cheese and eggs get so fluffy, and the cooked smoked salmon is delicious. It was like eating at a restaurant!

This got rave reviews at brunch today. I did make a change, and used fresh salmon (Copper River Salmon, to be exact), that had been grilled the night before. I followed the advice of another reviewer and melted the cream cheese w/ the  sauteed onions, and  I don't think that this is the way to go (unless you are VERY careful). The heat from the pan scorched the cream cheese, which wasn't a problem, really, but I anticipated not being able to flip it out of the pan w/ some cream cheese baked on the pan bottom. (I removed cream cheese, onion & salmon from pan, cleaned the pan, reapplied olive oil, put the mixture back into the frying pan, and then added the egg.) It was beautiful, and everyone seemed to love it! I will definately make this again.

kc* 
6 lg. eggs
2 Tbsp. milk
1 Tbsp chopped fresh dill
1 tsp. kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
2 Tbsp. chopped chives
2 oz. cream cheese, softened
2 oz. smoked salmon, chopped
2 tsp. olive oil

Preheat oven to 375.
Whisk the eggs, milk, dill salt, pepper and chives together in a bowl.  Using two spoons or your fingers, separate the cream cheese into small clumps.  Fold cream cheese and salmon into the egg mixture.
Heat the oil in a medium non-stick skillet over medium-low heat.  Pour the egg mixture into the skillet, and stir lightly to make sure the fillings are evenly arranged in the pan.  Cook until the bottom is et, butnow brown, about 2 minutes.  
 Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake until the top is set, about 8 minutes.  Remove from the oven, cover and set aside for 5 minutes.

Invert the frittata onto a large plat.  Cut into wedges and serve warm or at room temperature.

This was really good! I don't have a oven proof skillet, so I just put all the ingredients in a casserole and baked it for 30 minutes. Came out great. I also used capers instead of olives.

This was incredibly awesome!  Not light!  I added a tsp each of fresh chopped rosemary and thyme and a half of a fresh jalapeno finely chopped.  I also put the cream cheese inside by putting it in with the onion before adding the eggs.

This was great! I served this for our Easter brunch and everyone raved about it. (Even some who weren't too keen on the idea of fish and eggs together.) I would add some green onions next time.

I really enjoyed this. My husband didn't try it as he couldn't stand the smell of the salmon.  He's not a fish eater for the most part. 

I loved the blobs of melted cream cheese.  This made the dish very decadent and I expect, providing people like salmon and cream cheese, it will be a crowd pleaser.

I didn't use olives and used 3 tbsp of oil instead of 4.  The frittata stuck to my seasoned cast iron frying pan but didn't burn.  

Next time I think I'll use 2 tbsp oil, cook the onion/salmon, then place the mixture in with the eggs.  Then I'll add 1 tsp of oil to the pan and pour everything in, not mixing it. Hopefully this will provide the bottom of the pan with more lubrication.

a little too much onion taste for my liking, I'll probably take that out next time.  Otherwise really yummy!

Watch the time on this - I think I over baked. Cream cheese remained in blobs on top; next time I will melt this in with onions. Very good flavors! Perfect recipe to use up that 'little dab' of smoked salmon.

This was a great starter recipe for me!  I tend to always tweak recipes... and this one I didn't do all that much to.  I just added a clove of garlic in with the onions and instead of regular black olives I used kalamata olives.  Also added some rosemary and fresh dill as well as a pinch of sharp cheddar on top.  Turned out to be a fantastic dinner for my dad and I!

This turned out great, and looked good served with green salad and bread. Made with what I had on hand. Used Imitation crab, 1/2 each of red, green bell pepper and yellow and green zucchnin, sauted with onion. instead of cream,milk I used fat-free evaporated milk. added some parm in the egg mixture and omitted olives.

Delicious!!! I made a few changes- I omitted the olives and used a mixture of mozza and cheddar chunks instead of cream cheese. I also used regular frozen salmon and skipped on the cream, using more milk instead. mmmm Will definitely make again and again!

I made this for a family brunch and we loved it.  I did omit the olives as I wasn't sure about the egg/salmon/olive combo.  Our family (my brothers, sisters, parents, and kids) loves to have crab omelet, and I was waiting for the comments about the Smoked Salmon Frittata not being as good as that.  However, I heard nothing but complements about the flavor.  It is definitely the type of dish that would be served by upper-scale restaurants here in the Seattle area and is restaurant-quality.

I love this recipe because it is easy to make, delicious and most importantly a low-carb breakfast.  Being on a low carb diet, I was truly glad to discover this recipe with only 2.8 g of net carb and 17.3 g of protein per serving.   Thanks very much.

I made this almost two years ago and it still haunts me. Really wonderful. The cream cheese was like little pockets of melty goodness that just exploded/oozed in your mouth and it was so delicious.

Really good.  I omitted the olives, becasue I just don't like them.  I also reduced the oil to 2 tbsp., which was plenty and added the cream cheese to the onions, as others suggested.

I made this last night, it was wonderful. I only had frozen salmon but cooked it with the onions and it flaked apart perfectly. I didn't use olives because my daughter just didn't want them. I seasoned with the salt and pepper and a little dill. I also used a cast iron skillet. This is a keeper. Thank you very much for this recipe! This is perfect for anyone on atkins during Lent....

I did the same as another reviewer and omitted the olives but added red pepper. I also doubled the smoked salmon because I was using up what I had on hand. This was a really excellent recipe - thanks!

I have never made a Frittata before, and now I'll make them all the time it was so simple. I used a 10 inch skillet because my 8 inch just didn't look big enough and I used low fat cream cheese. Also my market didn't have peppered smoked salmon so I used the regular smoked salmon. We loved it very tasty!! 
Thank you for sharing.

Good basic recipe but the smoked salmon was too strong tasting.  Would be really good with bacon or other cured meat.  Really, you could add anything you like into this! Liked the cream cheese a lot but would cut the amount in half.

Didn't change a thing with this recipe and I loved it. Be sure to use the pepper smoked salmon since that has a lot to do with the wonderful flavor. One teen said it was very good and another tolerated it without complaint. Husband seemed to really like it. Will absolutely make again.

Very tasty.  I followed the recipe and it came out very nice.  20 minutes was perfect, but I did check frequently to prevent over-cooking. The cream cheese does stay in "blobs," but this is how cream cheese always comes out in these types of recipes - cooking it in with the onions is a great idea. I'll try that next time.  I used plain salmon instead of peppered, and that keeps it a little plain.  Next time I would use peppered.  Anyhow, it was easy to make and yummy!  I'd make this again.

I, too, used capers instead of olives. Although the flavor was quite good, it was a little too salty for me.  Maybe it was the capers; maybe it was that I used a bit more smoked salmon than it called for.  Next time I’ll try olives and less salmon and only add pepper, no salt.

We really liked this. I didn't have any olives, so I used a couple tablespoons of capers. Those worked well, but could probably have doubled that. I just used 1/4 cup of fat free half and half instead of milk and cream and it went just fine. The biggest advice I have is to cut the cream cheese fairly small. I think I cut the block into approximately 16 pieces, but would probably cut them into 32 pieces next time. Great recipe!!

I made this but used all milk instead of cream. I added some capers and sprinkled a little bit of cheddar cheese on top. It was excellent! I will be making this again!

Delicious and quick. If you have all the ingredients ready before you start you’ll breeze right through, especially mixing the eggs.  I also add chopped peppers if I have them.

Most Excellent!   Watch the oven time!  Top with sour cream and avocado!   People who are having an egg hating day are not going to like it.  More for me!

I wanted to love this more. Agree with whomever suggested that capers would probably work better than the black olives. I did love the blobs of cream cheese (used 1/3 fat and didn't notice the missing fat). Might be my fault though - made it last night and then refrigerated to bring it to work for breakfasts - might be better right out of the oven (though I'm realizing now it's not really work friendly with the fishy microwave smell). Also not a fan of frittatas - might try to make this into a quiche next time. Impressive looking!

I often have leftover lox (smoked salmon) and this recipe is the perfect combination of ingredients for breakfast or brunch.  I omitted the olives (hubby does not like them) and used capers, which actually goes better with the lox and cream cheese.  A delicious recipe which I will make often.  Thanks Debbist.

Love this. Only used 1 tbsp of oil and used Greek cream cheese and half&half, and left out the olives. So good.

This is probably my favorite frittata recipe to date. I've made a few substitutions based on what I have as well as to cut down on fat: Egg Beaters instead of eggs, soy milk for regular milk, fat free half & half for heavy cream, and light cream cheese for regular. I also used half an onion rather than a quarter, just because you can't have enough caramelized onion! I haven't had the original, but I don't notice any loss of flavor using these substitutions.

This was a huge hit with my wife for Mother's Day brunch, and for my 7 year-olds too.  I combined several of the suggested modifications.  Went with onions, red bell pepper, olives and capers.  Added a bit of goat cheese in addition to the cream cheese.  Also went with a little Italian seasoning and a few red pepper flakes when softening the onions.  Spices added a slight hint of flavor in the background.  Cooked 15 minutes vs 20 - plenty of time. Finally, 1/4 cup of milk instead of the milk/cream mix - eggs were still very fluffy.

This was very good, but I may have overcooked it in the oven. Used capers instead of black olives. Might try adding some dill to the egg mixture next time.

Really tasty, listened to some of the other reviews and melted the cream cheese in the pan before adding the egg mixture.  We used a cast iron pan so we could easily just transfer into the oven.  It came out really good and has inspired us to make more frittatas...

I've gotten compliments, but the flavor w/ the smoked salmon is a bit intense
