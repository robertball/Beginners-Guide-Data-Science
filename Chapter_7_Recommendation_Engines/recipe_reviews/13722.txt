This is a refreshing change from the same old veggie salad and the dressing isn't as overpowering as in some other recipes.Both my familly and I enjoyed this salad.

I wouldn't have thought of Italian dressing in a cabbage salad but it was very good. It was great the day I made it but as a "leftover" the fried onions and the bacon turned mushy.

Brought this cabbage salad to a potluck and everyone loved it.  The red cabbage really made it stick out compared to the other green salads.  If you like Ramen salads, you'll really enjoy this one.

This was good! My friend who doesn't like cabbage liked this salad! The only change I made was I used a jar of pickled cauliflower and other veggies and drained half the juice off. Also, I used cheddar french fried onions instead of plain. I will definately make again! Thanks!

I usually make cabbage salad with red and green cabbage, carrots and sweet onions, but, all I had was red cabbage and I decided to try this recipe. The bacon and fried onions became soggy within 1/2 an hour (it was a block party, so, the food was out for hours) and the cauliflower seemed unnecessary.  I definitely prefer my version.

This makes quite a lot! I warmed pre-cooked bacon, blotted the grease and chopped it. We won't eat it in one sitting, so I added everything except the onions, divided into containers and I'm adding the onions just before serving each container, so they don't get limp. I think the key is using an Italian dressing you really like, as this provides most of the flavor. Great change-of-pace recipe!

I was very leery of this recipe but decided to give it a try and I'm glad I did. This was very nice. There is just the two of us so I kept the bacon and onions separate and just added them to each serving when we had it. The cabbage stains the cauliflower purple after awhile but not to the point that you don't know what the cauliflower is. We enjoyed this and I will definitely make this again.

Was a little sweet. Perfect when combined with something spicy.
