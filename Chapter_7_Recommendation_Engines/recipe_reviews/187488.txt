I followed the recipe exactly and thought it turned out great! Has a light sweetness with the apricots and honey glaze.  I'll definitely be making this one again!  Easy to fix and turned out great in my machine.

Outstanding!  I use different dried fruits and wallnuts also.  Be ready for a HUGE loaf.  I use 2lb setting.

I used half whole wheat and half white flour, and used only honey as the sweetener.  This was made by hand and baked at 360 for 45 minutes.  Great taste!  The family wants me to make it again!

I definitely like this bread a lot.  It has a nice flavor and I love the apricots spotted throughout.  I used the dough cycle on my bread machine and baked in the oven for 45 min at 375.  I let the dough rise in the fridge bc I had made the dough late the night before, so 45 min wasn't quite enough--I think it would have been if I had let it rise at room temp.  I love that the top of the bread turns out dark and rustic looking.  Very pretty bread!  I didn't add the honey on top bc I want to use this as a sandwich bread, but I'm sure it would be wonderful with it.  I'll make again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely delicious!    As it's written, the loaf was a little too big for my breadmaker, even set to a 2 lb loaf.  It poofed up and smooshed against the top, so it was still a little gooey on the top.   Next time I will cut the recipe down to 10 servings and it should be fine.  The bread itself is wonderful.  I added a little ground ginger in addition to the cinnamon and  doubled the fruit using raisins and cranberries instead of apricots.  I will definitely make this again, and am looking forward to different fruit combinations.

I substituted apple juice instead of orange juice and didn't put the honey on the top because I, too, want to use the loaf for sandwiches. Pretty good, although the apricots give the bread a tartness I'm still trying to decide if I like or not. All in all, not a bad recipe. Will make again... but maybe with raisins & nuts instead of the apricots.

Yummy. Made exactly as written, except I did not add the honey on top. I selected the 2# loaf, light crust, "quick fruit & nut" bread setting and it took 2 hrs and 40 minutes to mix, rise, and bake. The apricots give it such a pleasant tartness. I might try adding just a little more cinnamon next time.

I used raisins instead of apricots and apple juice instead of orange juice. I did feel that this needed more flavor, perhaps more sugar. Thank you though.

Really nice bread, I used tropical juice instead of orange as that was all I had and it came out lovely. Made a massive loaf, it hit the window of my bread machine.

This bread is delicious!  I don't have a bread machine, and I made the bread the same way I would make any other bread.  Great texture, and not too sweet.  The only thing I would do to change it would be to add more chopped apricots.

I did adapt this to ingredients on hand, I used oat milk, which is quite rich but any milk would work. Added a heaping 1/2 cup of raisins in addition to apricots. Used the dough setting on the bread maker, made two loaves and baked in the oven at 350F.  Skipped the honey.  Very yummy for toast, this recipe is a keeper, will try with some whole-wheat next time.
