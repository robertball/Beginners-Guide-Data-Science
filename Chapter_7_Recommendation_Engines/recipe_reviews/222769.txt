I have made these twice - the first time I made the mistake of using Malibu Rum - sounded like a good idea - WRONG!  So I made them again using the correct rum and they were much better.  The family was not wowed with the mint flavor though.  I would cut back the mint if I were to make them again.

Very yummy and simple. It is exceedingly good chilled, as leftovers as well. You will need two limes for the zest and juice.

I now keep this pre-made marinade in my freezer for a quick fix.  I've used white, coconut and spiced rum all with successful flavors, but spiced is my favorite.  I usually just peel the shrimp and saute in butter in a hot skillet.   I used fresh sweet mint. One of mine and hubby's favorite quick summer dishes.

I made a major change to this, so take my review with a grain of salt. Instead of making the marinade as stated, I tossed the zest of 1 lime (not sure how much it yielded), mint, shallot, salt and sugar together in a bowl and let it marinade a few minutes. I pan fried the shrimp on the stove, then when it was done added in the lime juice and rum. It was phenomenal! Served it over white rice and the sauce was delicious. A new family favorite!

I followed the recipe exactly as written.  It was tasty, but too sugary.  Next time I fix this recipe I will add less sugar.

Followed the recipe exactly. Served over white rice with a green salad and mojitos, of course! Delicious, wouldn't change a thing. Love the recipe name :)

The only the I changed was the name and called these Mojito Shrimp, because that's what the ingredients remind me of.   Great marinade and leaves just enough sweetness to taste.
