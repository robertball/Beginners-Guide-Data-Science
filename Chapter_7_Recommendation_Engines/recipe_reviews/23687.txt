This was really, really good.  It was like a squash nacho or something.  Definitely something I will make again.

Think of this as a cornmeal crusted yellow squash quiche with and a crispy topping. 5 stars for ease, and the idea, but it needs help! I sauted the thinly sliced yellow squash with a chopped large onion and garlic till softened, I added cumin, cilantro, smoked paprika. I used a 7 oz can of green chilies, used only 1/2 of the cheese. I added a sliced garden tomato on top of the filling, before the extra chip topping. I served this with a fresh garden salsa, green beans and cucumber-tomato salad (most of our dinner came from our garden!) I made two 9" pies, and baked them for 30 minutes. I LOVE that I can use the broken tortilla chips in the bottom of the bag instead of making a bottom crust! Wish I'D thought of that, and will use the idea for other savory pies!

This is easy and absolutely fantastic!  Yellow squash was out of season, so I used zucchini and it worked great.  My 7 year old stepdaughter wasn't crazy about the squash, but said if I made it with broccoli it would be "perfect!"  I'm going to give it a try - seems like lots of different veggies would work!  Thank you!

I thought this recipe was just so-so.  When I took this out of the oven, I was kind of expecting something with a little more TASTE.  This recipe was kind of bland.  I even added more cheese because we are cheese freaks around here.  The eggs also give it a really weird texture when baked.  I don't think it is really worth your time to try it.  I would not make it again.

I didn't have green chiles on hand, so I added a can of Rotelle with tomato, pepper, and cilantro along with 1 tsp of red pepper flakes and chili powder.  It was fantastic.  My husband who hates squash, but loves salsa even liked it.

I love this recipe.  Goes great with a mexican food or give a great vegetable change for a side dish with beef or chicken.  Don't change a thing!

Out of eggs so subbed 3 C cottage cheese for milk and eggs. Added diced jalapenos in place of green chiles. Terrific casserole that seems to keep well in the fridge a day or two for lunches. Will definitely make again!

HUGE disappointment!  I guess I should have read the reviews first... as I really couldn't agree more with the majority of them... very tasteless.  Not sure how this got 4 stars with so many poor reviews. Save your time and effort... instead fry up the yellow squash with some garlic and mexican style spices instead and enjoy!

I found this recipe because I wanted to try a new way to prepare squash. I give this 4 stars because of the changes I made. I halved the eggs, milk, salt, flour, chilies and baking powder. Sliced three medium sized squash. I also added some sauteed diced onion.  Seasoned with a generous helping os freshly ground black pepper. It turned out great!

We thought this was a real nice change for squash.  I used Fritos for the chips and Monterey Jack with jalepenos for the cheese.  It was very tasty!

This was a pretty disappointing recipe. I even used jalepenos to spice it up, but to no avail. I give it a B+ for ease, but a D+ for taste. I wouldn't bother again.

The texture was fine, but we thought this recipe was very bland. We had to eat it with salsa and guacamole to give it some life. I probably won't make it again, but if I do I'll add a lot of garlic and onions.

This was OK but very bland and kind of "eggy".  Could be spiced up but probably won't make again because there are lots of other recipes that we like better.  Sorry.

I had to use Cheddar cheese instead of Monterey Jack, but it was still good.  It wasn't bad the second day, but the quality definitely deteriorated after that, so eat it quickly!

I read a number of comments about it being slightly bland, so I added some more green chiles  plus a little garlic powder and also added some French Fried Onions to the crushed tortilla chips and it made it pretty tasty. Even my oldest daughter who hates the texture of cooked squash liked it.

After reading the reviews, I used a can of rotel and a few diced jalapanos instead of the chillis. I did not have corn chips so I used tortilla chips. It had a good flavor and was easy to make. The only other change was I used 1/2 the cheese to save on the calories and so the other flavors would come out. All four of us liked it, even the ones that don't like squash. Will make this again for sure.

This was delicious, even with the differences I had to make because I didn't have the full amount of some ingredients!  I only had 1/2 pound of cheese, but it was still good. I can't wait to try it will full cheese! I also wasn't sure how heavy my squash was as I only used one very large squash from my garden? No corn chips? No problem!  I used crushed tortilla chips and pita chips!

My husband, who has two favorite squash dishes, LOVED this! I didn't have chips, substituted Ritz crackers. So good.
