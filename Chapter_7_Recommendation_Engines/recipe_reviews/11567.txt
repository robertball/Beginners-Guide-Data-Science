It turned out way better than i thought it would. A really good shorcut, though, is instead of making the dough, just buy the pre-made pie crust dough (Pillsbury). It shaves off at least 2 hours and cuts out some of the sugar! A big hit at school!

My family was really amazed at this recipe. 5 stars for the taste. But don`t put too much filling on the dough (do as the recipe says - 1/2 teaspoon). I put much and the filling flew out from some pasteles and they didn`t look beautiful.

I doubled this recipe and ended up having a lot of caramel left over. The pasteles were  very good. They tended to overflow a little      bit. My class loved them, many people asked for seconds and others asked for the recipe!

This is a great idea...but I found that even if you only use 1 tsp of filling, it still leaks out!  So what you end up eating is basically just pastry.    I think I would bake solid pastry wedges and serve it with the warm caramel sauce as a dip...that way you can taste the caramel!

The dough for these cookies was a little like pastry/pie dough and was delicious; not overly sweet and very easy to work with, though I did have to use my kitchenaid to blend it.  I am an experienced baker and I just couldn't get this to come together by hand with a pastry blender and didn't want to add more moisture.  So after working it by hand for a while and still having a lot of crumb, I threw it in the mixer bowl on medium speed for less than 30 seconds and it came together.

I was a total idiot and forgot the coconut for the filling as I was making these (that's what you get for baking Christmas cookies for 14 hours straight) and I think I would have appreciated the viscosity it would have added to the filling.  I sealed my edges TIGHTLY and still I had some leakage with some of the cookies.  However, they are very tasty, and they're lovely to boot.  A very nice addition to my cookie trays and I will make them again next year WITH the coconut!

This recipe was awesome!  You may need more caramel pieces, and the recipe takes a little time, but it is definitely worth it.  They are a great addition to a spanish styled theme feast.

Surprisingly not too difficult ... they have a light flavor, not overly sweet ... I ended up with too much caramel as well, and when I overstuffed them the caramel leaked a bit and made crispy edges, but they tasted excellent and still looked cute and dainty.

I wanted to like these more than I did. I'm sure these take practice, but mine were a mess. There was too much caramel filling which was kinda hard to work with, my dough-to-filling ratio wasn't any good, my filling ran out of the cookies, and the baked dough seemed really dry. I think I overworked it. I think this would be a good recipe to practice, but I didn't enjoy them much myself.

super good, but definitely not an Argentinean food. Caramel? Dulce de Leche is where it's at!
