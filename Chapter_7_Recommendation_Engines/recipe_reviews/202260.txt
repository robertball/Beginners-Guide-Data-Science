This recipe has been our family's much-loved, always EXPECTED dish for special gatherings for nearly 40 years! We've affectionately dubbed it "Pink Stuff" and use strawberry gelatin.  One comment was it was "gritty". Do NOT prepare gelatin with water as a remedy. Use DRY gelatin (powder).  It probably turned out gritty because it wasn't refrigerated long enough...allow 1-2 hours for the gelatin to dissolve and for the salad to firm up without grit. (I wonder if it's possible that using a "past its date" gelatin or a non-Jello brand may cause grittiness? We always use Jello brand and have NEVER had a problem with "grit.") Add fresh sliced strawberries and blueberries to the recipe for a REAL yummy treat. Note: I have tried this with "you-whip-it" type toppings--both liquid and dry--and they wouldn't set up.  We, too, have had people say they don't like cottage cheese but like this salad.  It is debatable whether its a salad or a refreshing light dessert--more like an ambrosia.  We have served it both ways. :-) Enjoy!

My mom also has made this for years - we called it "pink salad" - until she started using orange jello.  She uses mandarin oranges and pineapple chunks along with pecans and miniature marshmallows. Really easy to adapt to your taste.

Thank you for posting this recipe!  My mom made this all the time when I was little and I loved it.  She no longer cooks and couldn't remember how to make it, so thanks for allowing me to share it with my children!!

Pretty, tasty and easy to do.  I may add oranges and other fruit to this as it would be good too.  Thanks for a good picnic recipe!

I had to do this "low cal" for our WW diet but it is still wonderful.  Used sugar free Cool Whip and Jell-o, 1% cottage cheese.  Didn't have any pineapple in my pantry so I used mixed fruit and a small can of oranges.  This used to be my mother's favorite so my daughter calls it "grandma's fluffy stuff".

The recipe as indicated yields 12 servings, so I cut everything in half to suit my family of four.  I used orange gelatin, and it was very tasty.  This may seem obvious, I think, but it wasn't for me at first ... The recipe doesn't specify whether or not the gelatin is supposed to be "Prepared" or "Unprepared" ... I just dumped the powder into the whipped topping and stirred it in with the rest of the ingredients.  I let everything sit in the fridge for about a hour before eating it, so it solidified a bit, but not to gelatin consistency.  It was tasty, but a tad gritty, which is why I deducted a star from my rating.  Just for grins, I may try preparing the gelatin as indicated on the box, allowing it to somewhat cool, (as you usually have to use boiling water), and then mixing it in with the rest of the ingredients.  It may solve the grit issue.  Even so, I will definitely make this again as is, as it was a super quick dessert, tasty enough to satisfy my families sweet-teeth.

I love cottage cheese and needed an excuse to use up a tub of it so I made this recipe and loved it! Used sugar free strawberry jello, 1% cottage cheese, fat free whipped, and a can of no sugar added canned fruit to keep the calories low. I ate the whole thing in 3 days! In hindsight I probably would put the cottage cheese in a blender to get all of the chunks out for those who don't like it. Will make again!

My mom has made this since I was a little kid. She uses whatever gelatin she happens to have, and it's always yummy! We call it "ice cream salad" in our family. Thanks for sharing!

This is also excellent using one package of pistachio pudding to replace the raspberry jello. Add some mini marshmallows and chopped pecans.

I grew up eating this, but with cherry Jell-o and a few chopped walnuts. I LOVE it.  I was thinking of trying it with cranberry Jell-o for Thanksgiving.  Fingers crossed!

We have made something similar for years.  We use Black Cherry Jello and Canned Dark Sweet Cherries (not pie filling, but located in the pie filling section).  This was my Grandpa's favorite fruit salad recipe!

This is a delicious and EASY fruit salad to make. Plus it is so versatile. I used 10oz pineapple and 10 oz mandarin oranges and it was excellent. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Very good stuff people!!! Family loved it. Made it the way it was written. I suppose you could put in some coconut, drained fruit cocktail and the mandarin oranges to jazz it up a notch. Maybe add another box of jello too. Great the way it is. Thanks for the submission.

Wonderful summertime salad.  I put  2 packages of the raspberry gelatin in for added flavor.  I suggest refrigerating overnight instead of just 2 hours to allow full absorption of flavor.
