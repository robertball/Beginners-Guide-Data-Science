I haven't used the chunks for a long time.. I prefer the crushed or Tidbits.... but that is just me.  Easy & great, simple recipe.  And drain the pineapple really well and the ham needs to be blotted if from the package, or pizza will be too wet.  Also, do NOT use a big square cut slice of ham.. slice in in thin strips or again, won't blend as well.  Just my tried and all that experience.  But very quick and very easy to make and oh so delish.

i used this as a base for making our bacon, pineapple, jalapeno pizza.. we used regular bacon instead of turkey and felt the pizza could have used more.. maybe another 3 slices? one cup of sauce just looked like it was going to make the pizza crust soggy so i only used about 1/2.. i was being lazy and used ragu meat flavored pasta sauce but homemade would have made this much better.. this recipe was kind of skimpy on the cheese (we used colby).. i'd bump it up to 2 cups next time.. i started out using about 1/4 of the can of pineapple but 1/2 would have been perfect.. i ended up cutting the chunks in half and agree with Sheryll & Critters that using crushed or tidbits would be better.. i subbed 2 jalapenos that i deseeded/deveined for the bell pepper.. i wasn't in the mood for onions but i should have put some on bf's half since he loves them.. we did use the cilantro but put it on after the pizza came out of the oven.. bf topped his with some pepperoncinis.. ty for the start of our dinner
