This was easy and so good.  I was looking for an avocado ranch dressing and this was the closest I came to one.  Great as a dip, but add a little milk or heavy cream and it makes a good dressing, too. Works well poured over salted cherry tomatoes with blue cheese crumbles or with a salad. Since my food processor is not very big, I used a blender and flash blended to the consistency I was looking for. It's even better the next day. I'm sure most of you know but Neufchatel cheese is simply 1/3 less fat cream cheese.

Would it be wrong to eat this stuff with a spoon? That's how good it was! I added a clove of minced garlic and liberal amounts of fresh ground pepper. Definitely needs to sit a few hours to let flavors meld. Not a scrap was left... and MEN were asking for the recipe!! A keeper for sure

Made this for a graduation party and everyone loved it.  I added a little minced garlic (about 1/2 tsp.) and more hot sauce (a little over a teaspoon).  Leave time for the flavors to come together in the refrigerator - it tasted even better after sitting for a while.

This dip is fantastic! Especially if you love ranch! I use up to 6 avocados to give it some extra flavoring. Its best served chilled. Slice up a loaf of french bread and drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with garlic powder. Toast in the oven till lightly browned. great to use to dip or spread the dip on.

This was very good, but I really like avocado and added more than it asked for.  I only made a 1/4 batch and it was a lot for 2 adults and 2 small kids.  Be aware of how much you need b/c the dip does start to brown (b/c of the avocado) so it starts looking unattractive if you are wanting to keep it.  You could maybe put lemon juice in it to stop the browning, but not sure what that would do to the taste. But, this was very good.

Holy delicious! This is amazing! The reviewer who asked if they could eat it with a spoon wasn't kidding! I've made this twice in the past 3 days. The first time I made it exactly as written, and it was really, really good. The second time I made it, I made the following modifications: used 3 avocados, celery and garlic powders as opposed to salt (I think the Ranch dressing mix has more than enough salt, and I put salt on everything), 1 full TBS of hot sauce, and instead of using the food processor, left everything kind of chunky. I just used a spatula to mix up the (softened) cream cheese (cubed) and sour cream mixture, and left the avocados rather chunky, too. 

Next time I make it (and there will be many next times), I'm going to double the hot sauce to 2 TBS, and leave everything chunky. Maybe add a little garlic, but really, this recipe doesn't need much tweaking. Outstanding! I'm spooning it over my pulled pork sandwich and may have found food nirvana :)

Note: There was some slight separation on the third day, but it did not affect the flavor, and was easy to mix up again. I did not find any discoloration due to the avocado, either, like others have said.

I'm not a huge fan of spicy, so I left out the hot sauce.  But otherwise I thought this recipe was awesome!

This was good, I served it as a dip for the Southwest-Style Egg Rolls from this site. I did not use the celery salt because I was not able to find it at my grecery store.  I also added a some milk and ranch dressing from a bottle to thin it a little and for extra kick I added a few more dashes of hot sauce (I used Frank's Red Hot Sauce) and cayenne pepper.  Next time I am going to add an extra avocado.

I tried this recipie because I had some avacados and cream cheese that needed to be used before they spoiled and I needed an appetizer for a neighborhood get together.  It was an absolute smash!!!  A bowl of this dip and some Fritos Scoops an you can "ruin your dinner".  I am sure I will be using this recipe often in the future.

Very easy and very yummy - a great party dip.  I had a similar dip at a bridal shower and decided I had to find a recipe for it - and this was perfect.  The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars was because I had to add quite a bit more hot sauce to spice it up a little (but we just like spicier foods).  It definetly tastes even better after it sits in the fridge overnight!

Thanks, this is a super recipe as presented.  It's also great because it is so easy to adjust the ingredients to personal taste.     I'll first note that just using half of the cream cheese (1/3 less fat substituted great), 1/2 of the light sour cream and 1/2 of the ranch dip made a good amount for the first batch for two people for two evenings.    I'm glad I did it that way because by the end of the 2nd day the avocado had started to turn the mixture a less appetizing brown.....and I still have the ingredients in the fridge to experiment with another 1/2 batch.    I wanted more avocado and less cream and cheese so did two avocados with about 6 oz of light sour cream, 3 oz of 1/3 less fat cream cheese, about 1/3 of the 1 oz ranch dip powder.  Kept the garlic powder (not salted due to salt in the ranch powder) and hot sauce the same and I liked it even more for us.   All of the great flavor mixture was still there from the original recipe, it was much more green of course, and more than a little less of the more unhealthy fat.     Again, thanks!    This is an absolute keeper and will be fun to experiment with in the future.

I was looking for an alternative for a creamy avocado dip I make because I didn't want to smell up my kitchen (it involves boiling fresh tomatoes and jalapenos). This dip was very similar in flavor without as much work. I did add an extra avocado because I didn't feel 2 was enough. I didn't have celery salt so I added a little onion powder and an extra dash of salt. I also added extra hot sauce for more kick. The ranch flavor was a little overpowering. I plan on making it again. Next time I will prob start off with half the ranch packet and add as needed.

This dip is very tasty and easy to make. It makes a lot of dip, but thankfully it seems to refrigerate well. I thought the flavor from the packaged ranch mix was a bit too strong, so I might cut back a little bit next time. I served this with the Southwestern Egg Rolls on this site.

I used Philadelphia Cream Cheese instead of Neufchatel cheese and didnt use celery salt as I didnt have any in house. I felt that this dip didnt have a whole lot of flavor. The consistancy was a little runny, more like a salad dressing than a dip. If I were to make it again I would only use half the sour cream and add a third avocado. All in all I liked about three bites and then it was just kind of just tasted bland. Maybe it needs more hot sauce

This is a pretty great dip!  With just 2 avocados called for, you are only able to taste the ranch.
The second time I added 1 more avocado and it was definitely a yummy combination!  Thanks for sharing.

Just made this for a July 4th party and it was such a hit!  I did adjust the recipe a bit to personalize it.  I used regular cream cheese, doubled the hot sauce (and still might add a bit more next time), and I added a minced fresh clove of garlic to the cream cheese mixture .  Also used three good sized avocados and added juice of half a small lime, which preserved the color nicely.  It was delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a wonderful suprise.  Awesome.  Made as directed just added a bit more hot sauce and added a few finely chopped pickled hot peppers, not much.  A great way to use up very ripe avacados.  Thank you so much.

I made this for the Super Bowl and we all enjoyed it.  I served it with lime tortilla chips and some garlic pita chips.  Both really added something to the dip.  Of course, I also ate it with regular tortilla chips & it was just as good.  I also spread some of the leftovers on my turkey sandwich - it was delicious!

I upped to 3 avocados and added minced garlic and a lot more hot sauce [and I don't even like spicy stuff but it made the flavor burst]. I will definitely make this again, and maybe even add to some burritos:)

OMG - this is the best dip I have ever made or eaten.  I did use full fat cream cheese and sour cream, but the next time I will try it with the lower fat versions, I can't imagine that the taste would be any differebt.  I had two big avocados that were just perfectly ripe.  I had to hold myself back from eating this with a spoon!  So I used vegetable dippers so I could feel a little better about it.  Maybe when I make it with the low fat ingredients I can eat it with a spoon!
12/26/08 - update.  I used low fat cream cheese and low fat sour cream.  Although still 5-star worthy it was saltier than when I used the full fat ingredients.  That being said (grin) - maybe I should try it with the low fat cream cheese and the full fat sour cream (just like the recipe calls for!!) and see how that is.
"good eats" as AB would say!

What I like the most about this recipe is how easy it is and has relatively common ingredients. Adding milk can change the consistency for whatever purpose you want to use it for. I put a few more dashes of hot sauce in to give it a little extra kick!

I loved this dip!  I don't care much for traditional guacamole, so this was perfect for me.  It's so creamy.  I didn't add the hot sauce, but did put in some red pepper flakes.  I made it for a party and it was a total hit!

Love this! Have made it several times. I use garlic powder because I rarely buy garlic salt.  I wonder if it would be too salty with crumbled bacon? Think I’ll try a small batch with chives or green onion! Mmm! Thanks for the possibilities!

Yummy.  Used fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  Used dried dill weed, dried parsley, celery seed and dried thyme leaves instead of ranch dressing mix.  Added a minced scallion.  Added a bit of fresh lime juice.   Used as a topping for   zucchini and cauliflower fritters.  This would also be great with crackers, naan, tortilla chips, fresh veggies.

Wow! This is delicious! I want to eat it by the spoonful!

I couldn't find any celery salt, so I used some Manuka honey smoked salt instead. Definitely use all of the ranch powder! I used 3 avocados because I have a lot of them. I also used plain, fat free Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream. Can't wait to bring this to Easter for the veggie tray tomorrow!

I substituted a half stock of celery finely diced and garlic powder instead of the 2 salts then added 1/4 TSP of kosher salt. The diced celery added a nice texture contrast and replacing the hot sauce with Greek pepper juice added good heat and nice acidity. Will try the recipe as is next time and compare the 2. As a dip it’s amazing but when added to a bowl of  chili it’s perfection.

I love a smooth dip. The recipe made about three cups.  I will cut it back for we two.  I am going to try adding tomato a some chopped onion,  just to see how that taste. Lovely green color.

The first time I made this I made it as listed and found it a little to firm for my taste. The second time I made it I left out the cream cheese and couldn't get enough! The flavor is great and my preference for consistency is to leave out the cream cheese. My family and I love avocado ranch dip and this is the recipe I use, Always! Thanks for sharing!

This does make a lot! I put chopped up avocado in after blending the sour cream / cream cheese / spices with a hand mixer.  I think used the hand mixer to blend in and mash the avocados for me.  I was concerned about it turning brown, but only larger chunks turned a little bit brown.   Next time I would probably add more avocado and probably more spices.

I love avocados in any form.  Add sour cream and cream cheese and I'm in heaven.  I think I probably added too much avocado--I used Wholly Guacamole because it was easier--but it was really creamy and good.  I think it could even use some feta or maybe tomatoes.  Great with baked Scoops.

My daughter thought this was the best thing we served on the snack bar at her birthday party. It was nice and light and great with the veggies. I did make my own ranch spice mix, however, and used about a tablespoon. Could go with or without the hot sauce.

Far too "ranchy" for my husband and me. Friends and relatives liked it but I think they were just being kind. Next time I'm cutting the dried ranch mix in at least 1/2 perhaps 1/4.  It just totally overpowered the four large avocados.

I served this as an appetizer for a family evening, and although some people liked it, I thought the taste could be much improved. Two avocados almost dilute the taste of the ranch flavor, so I would suggest only one avocado. I would also suggest adding more garlic salt, as well as the hot sauce if you like a little zip. The sour cream could also probably be reduced by a third. The serving size is more than plentiful for a medium sized group, and that much sour cream (on top of the cream cheese) is simply not needed.

I made this for my 4 yr olds birthday last year November and have made it numerous times since then and it is a HIT every time!  I absolutely love this dip, it doesn't get any better than this:)

This is delicious!  I used the Ranch dip and dressing recipe mix on this website, and it was perfect!  I also added the sliced avocado directly to the food processor without mashing it first.  It worked just fine.

Very good!  I halved everything except the ranch packet and it was excellent!  I took it to a party and received a lot of compliments.

I have to agree with a previous reviewer - this tasted good, but not really much better than a similar store-bought dip. I wouldn't make it again. Thanks anyway.
