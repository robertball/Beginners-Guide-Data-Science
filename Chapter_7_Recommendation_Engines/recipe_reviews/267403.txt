This was yummy and easy, except I take out the meat and make it a veggie Frittata! 
I love my air fryer!  It made making food so much easier, it's like having the "easy bake oven" that I never had as a child.
I make a good healthy banana cake in it too!

Breakfast just got easier. No fuss. No mess. No flipping the darn skillet and getting egg on the floor. I followed the description about the ingredients and used some leftover cooked steak instead of sausage and added a jalapeno. It was nicely browned and fluffy at 18 minutes exactly. Excellent recipe, thank you for sharing it.

Absolutely loved this!  Added mushrooms, green onions
and added an extra egg.  Seasoned the egg mixture before cooking frittata.  It was amazing!

...Yo!!!!.... Just for you mad scientist 'EggHead' breakfast cookers with a Air Fryer!!!! The sky is the limit with your choices of ingredients besides the eggs!!!! My 1st one came out as 'Fluffy' as a Sponge Cake using this recipe as shown!!!! I had no 'Gastric Issues' other than aggravating the wife. SFGS (There is really something about cooking with an 'Air Fryer'!!! SFGS ... AND ... I think (2) kitchens in a home are more important than a bath and a half or (2) baths!!! SFGS

This is a definite keeper. I don’t use my air fryer enough so this was a good test of my air dryer skills [still need some to develop]. Didn’t have any sausage; used bacon [had to pan fry it first]. Didn’t have red pepper; used yellow. Added some spinach and arugula. It didn’t look like very much before cooking. Was plenty for 2 with leftovers. Thanks for posting this recipe!

Thanks so much for sharing this basic recipe.  I used crumbled bacon, Mexican Blend shredded Cheese, 1/4 red onion finely diced, 1 rib finely diced celery and 3 cleaned and sliced mushrooms - because that is what I had in my pantry.  OMG - it was so good and so quick and easy to make.  And it was also completely done cooking in 18 minutes also.

It browned a little too fast on the outside, so I covered it in foil the last 4? minutes (of the 18 min cook time)... I also used ham & thawed frozen spinach in lieu of sausage & peppers ... next time I will cover with foil at 12 minutes & continue to experiment with the ingredients!

Good but a bit dry. I used 7 eggs for more servings, so the extra cooking time to cook eggs in center of frit may have dried mine out a bit.  I used sausage, spinach, and 2 broken up hash browns - tasty!

I used leftover vegetables. Normally I would sauté my vegetables and add about 2-3 table spoonfuls of Chinese cooking wine (Shao Xing wine) and a drizzle of sesame oil (you can find these at any Asian food store) when I'm cooking the vegetables. The wine and sesame oil will give it a fragrance but don't overdo the wine. If you use leftovers, you can stir-fry it again in a tablespoon of olive oil on a pan, add a bit of mushrooms or fresh vegetables to give it a fresher taste. I just added the egg mixture in the baking tin and topped it off with a combination of mozzarella and cheddar pizza topping cheese and baked it for 18 minutes in the airfryer.  Et voila! Delicious.

The Air Fryer Breakfast Frittata was delicious! But I had to make a modification.  I did not have a metal pan so I used a glass mixing bowl that fit in the air fryer.  I found I had to stir it two times because it was not cooking on the bottom. I don't know if that is because of the shape of the bowl.  I also added mushrooms and used turkey sausage instead of  regular sausage.  Turkey sausage tasted great as a substitute.

It tasted good, and I'll probably make it again.  My air fryer must be way off on time or the recipe is because there was an area inside about the size of an egg that was still liquid.  We hadn't eaten all day, so I finished it in the microwave.

I used purple onions instead of the green onions, I also use cilantro an added bacon bits. For my spices I added cumin chili powder, and Chipotle chili. I also cooked it in an 8in cake pan which required me to use two more eggs for it to rise.

Is it possible to bake it in the oven? Would the result be the same?
