YUM! This was very good, but I did alter the recipe a little...I sauteed my mushrooms (I only used 8oz. sliced because I misread the recipe,lol), in a little extra virgin olive oil with salt, pepper, garlic powder and parsley to soften them up a bit because I was afraid that they wouldn't cook in the time alotted. I let them cool completely and proceeded with the recipe. I also didn't have quite enough shredded mozzarella, so I mixed mozzarella, shredded cheddar and some shredded swiss. I sliced my bread and toasted the one side, flipped them over, put the mixture on and broiled them until all melted and bubbly. This went very well with our pasta dinner and I know I will be using this recipe often! I think next time I will chop the mushrooms for more even distrubtion. Thanks for sharing. :)

Omigosh, this is good.  I planned to saute the mushrooms ahead of time (like so many raters suggested), but I ran out of time so they went into the mixing bowl fresh.  I worried they would become watery and make the bread mushy during cooking, but that did not happen.  This recipe is perfect just the way it's written.  My family loved it, and so did I.

Made a lot of mix and we got more than 17 servings. It tasted good with some extra oil and herbs on it.

Excellent! I followed another reviewers suggestion and sauteed the mushrooms and onions in some butter and olive oil. Mixed the softened butter and cheese together and spread on bread. Added the mushroom and onion mixture and topped with more cheese.

WOW! INCREDIBLE bread-really like a meal itself! It actually reminded me of a veggie grinder I get from a local pizza & sub shop but this is even better! Throw on some olives & peppers, maybe tomatoes-yum!!

SO GOOD! I cut the bread into slices before I read the directions. Oops! :) I just squished the bread in the middle to make a little bowls (instead of pulling it out). They came out just fine. I followed the filling recipe to a T and it was fantastic! We made it to accompany a pasta dish with a mushroom cream sauce. This could definitely could be a great afternoon snack as well. They are FULL and you will be too.

OMG...was this ever good and really easy to make. I only used an 8 oz. pack of baby portabella mushrooms and it was plenty enough, kept the rest of the ingredient the same. I chopped the mushrooms up pretty good so they would cook in the oven. I added some fresh chopped parsley that needed to be used to the mixture. I didn't pull out the bread, I just pulled it apart and made a cavity for the mushroom mixture. I had a pretty long French bread roll and it filled it very nicely. We served it with broccoli cheese soup. Best meal I've had in a long time...Thanks JMSS

Awesome.  I tried making the bread myself, but apparently I didn't make enough because there was way too much of the mushroom mixture.  I put the rest of it on three pitas.

Can I say OMG?  This recipe deserves 10+ stars! My hubby and I DEVOURED it!!  The only thing different I did was saute everything before putting it in the loaf to bake.  We're going to make this again in place of a pizza night, it's a meal in itself. Thanks Mike for one fantastic recipe!!

Very Yummy!  Lots of mushrooms and onions, but all for the good!  There is no need to saute the mushrooms beforehand as others have done.  The onions and mushrooms cook well in the butter cheese mixture.  The crust turns out nice and crusty, too!  Good recipe!

this was great. I mixed it all together and brought it to a football party at my sisters, then I just had to put it in the bread and put it in the over.  Everyone loved it, even some people who don't like mushrooms.

Fantastic recipe!! We were traveling, so I mixed the garlic and butter before departing. Right before baking, I spread the garlic butter on the halved bread and topped with the sliced onions, mushrooms, and cheese. Very quick and tasty appetizer or side w/ a meal!!

I have made this twice now for my family. They told me it was the best appetizer they had ever eaten. I will be making the mushroom bread for future dinners and get-togethers. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe! I love it!

I don't even like mushrooms, and I liked this bread.  My husband, who loves mushrooms, LOVED this bread.  This was our favorite part of dinner tonight.

Delicious! I've made this several times now and it just tastes better each time.  The only thing that I do differently is to saute the mushrooms and garlic a bit before mixing them with everything.  This makes less of a bite with the garlic.  This is a great compliment to pasta, soup or as an appetizer.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I didn't really follow the instructions, but this recipe deserves 5 stars anyway, because it is an awesome idea and inspiration - and it is very simple.  I used Raclette cheese and dehydrated minced onions, and also dehydrated diced garlic, because I didn't have very much at home.  I sliced the bread into thick diagonal slices instead of cutting it in half, and piled the mixture upon every slice. It was absolutely wonderful, and my roommate and I loved it so much, we made it again the next day.  Oh, I also added salt and pepper, and some oregano. YUM!

This was so good paired up with Lobster Ravolli and shrimp Bisque! I only needed enough for 4 servings.  I didn't have fresh mushrooms though so I used a 4oz can drained. YUM!!!

Delicious! I kept the mushrooms fresh and thought it turned out awesome.  Tasted like perfect garlic bread, with mushrooms. YUM! The store was out of Italian bread so I bought sub buns.  I thought they worked out great! They cut into nice pieces/wedges so easily. I cut the bottom thin and left it flat then scooped out the top of the bun.

This was really good.  However, I think it needs more garlic and onion, as well as butter and cheese.  I think swiss cheese would be really good as well.  No need to dig out the bread, as I just pressed the bread and that worked just fine (as others have mentioned).  No need to sautee mushrooms first, as it isn't needed.

This is CRAZY good!  I am not much of a mushroom person, so I was trying to be brave for my fiance.  Let me tell you, this bread is fantastic.  I did make a couple of small changes.  

Since I am learning to like mushrooms, I diced them instead of slicing and I used a round sourdough bread because that's what the store recommended.

Next time I will use 1/4 cup butter since the cheese seemed a little on the oily side.  

Overall, definitely a keeper!!

REALLY good!  I assembled everything as stated (which was super easy), only adding in some cracked black pepper and grated parmesan cheese on top.  Made this for a deck party with my friends & everyone really, really liked it.  It got ALOT of compliments, which is always nice. ;)

FANTASTIC! Served as a side, along with burger patties and Mouse's Mac & Cheese. Made as written, and the crust came out buttery and crunchy. It's a keeper! Thanks, Mike!

YUM! YUM!! YUM!!!  This is absolutely amazing.  Can definitely sub as a meal on it's own/replace pizza night/ grilled cheese etc...  I've made it twice - second time with some chopped red onion because I didn't have any green - we actually liked that taste even better but the original recipe is great just as is!! (no need to saute the mushrooms - they cook just fine as the recipe states).  I like to make a garlic butter first and spread this over the hollowed bread and then mix together the mushrooms, onions and cheese and fill the cavity.

This was so easy and so delicious.  I used up some left over white cheese curds instead of the mozzarella and can tell you that makes it even better because I tried the mozzarella a little while later and the cheese curds are definitely better.

This was- and I don't think I'm exaggerating here- the greatest thing I have ever tasted in my life. Instead of pulling the bread out, I just kind of smooshed it down and it worked great. Thanks Mike- This will be in VERY frequent rotation at my house!

I followed the tweak that Christina suggested by sauteeing the mushrooms first and also added a little white wine.  This was incredible.  I barely got it sliced and on to my Easter table today.  This is a definite keeper.

Cheese, Mushrooms and garlic together on fresh bread with just the right amount of decadent butter, heated perfectly crispy...this was a huge hit at our house.  If you love cheesy garlic bread and mushrooms this is a winner...We enjoyed it for the first time today with leftover beef stew.  I knew my crowd would be happy with a strong garlic flavour  so I added a bit extra.

We had crab legs and lobster for new years eve and I made this as a side dish... It was very tasty, but also very very rich. We could each only eat a small slice. might try again with a lighter meal or tomato sauce pasta

My husband, who doesn't care for mushrooms BTW, loved this bread.  Who knew?  I was expecting complaints and all he could say was how tasty it is.  I’m still in shock.  We both thought it was a five star recipe.

I don't review a lot of recipes on this site - I make a lot of them, but I'm rarely actually write a review. That being said, this recipe is amazing, and it's so amazing that I'm actually interrupting my kitchen-cleaning-up to post this.
I subbed out green onions (didn't have any) for regular onions. For a half-batch: I chopped up the mushroom stems (used 8oz baby portabella), with 1/2 white onion chopped fine, about 2 cloves minced garlic, about 1/2 - 1 t. olive oil, 1/2 t. italian seasoning, 1/4 t. salt, and 1/2 t. hot-n-spicy Mrs Dash. Microwaved that for 2 minutes, then added the rest of the mushrooms caps, quartered and sliced thin. Microwaved that for 2 minutes, stirring after 1 min, then drained off the accumulated liquid. Stirred in 1/2 stick (4T, 1/4 cup) softened butter and 1c shredded mozzarella cheese. My only mistake: I didn't let the microwaved veggies cool enough before adding the cheese and butter, so the butter started to melt. I have celiac disease, so to make this Gluten Free, I used 4 premade frozen 6" GF pizza crusts (Glutino-brand). I partially prebaked them under the broiler (2 min each side), then evenly divided the mushroom/cheese mixture on them, and sprinkled a bit more cheese on top (about 1-2 T. on each). Broiled for 4 minutes total, until cheese was bubbling and starting to brown.
Oh my goodness, it was so good! And it was fast - start-to-finish, everything took less than 20 minutes. I will definitely make this again and again and again...

I made about 1/4 of this recipe for the two of us.  I used Swiss cheese rather than mozzarella, and as other reviewers suggested I briefly sautéed the mushrooms (I diced instead of sliced) and allowed them to cool completely before combining them with the other ingredients.    I sliced my bread and toasted one side under the broiler, then topped the other side with the mushroom mixture and broiled again.  This was good, but I wasn’t as wowed by it as some of the other reviewers.  And, although this was tasty, it wasn’t appealing to the eye.

Made this as an Appetizer and it was a HUGE HIT. Before anyone even saw what it was, several asked what it was due to the incredible aroma. Everyone wants the recipe! Will make this a lot! Thank you for sharing.

I did not have green onions, so used pesto and it was very good. I also used whole wheat french bread and made one small serving on flat bread for my daughter.

Loved it! Used I can't believe it's not butter Light instead of regular butter. Didn't have Italian bread so I used thin french bread. Love this! wonderful garlic taste. I chopped up the mushrooms fine because my husband isn't a big fan of mushrooms and it spread better because they were smaller.

I wish I could give this a 10*!  I made this to go along with our steak instead of the normal potato. I could eat this all on it's own...I think I will make some more today for lunch..YUMMY!!  I will be making this often as my hubby and I really loved it!

I made this last night for supper and it was fabulous. We both love mushrooms, so this was a big hit with my husband. Followed the recipe as written.  I served it with a salad from this web site. Thanks for sharing.

Excellent! I made the recipe almost exactly as written. I only substituted thinly sliced onion for the green onion since I had no green onion. This is a keeper! My husband and I had this for dinner with a salad. We have leftovers for another meal.

WOW!  If you like mushrooms, even just a little bit, you must try this!  It is soooooooo gooooooood!  I followed the recipe exactly, only I halved it since there were only three of us eating.  Luckily I have enough stuff to make another one tomorrow!  No need to saute the mushrooms- they cooked up perfectly.  Incredibly tasty.  Thank you JMSS- this will be a usual suspect in my house :)

Mike you ROCK! This is the best bread ever! Forget using it as a side dish... main course complimented with a salad or bowl of soup and nothing else to it! Store didn't have un-sliced loaf so I just made the mixture as it called, spooned it open faced & baked. WONDERFUL!

I don't like mushrooms, but I participate in a local gardening co-op and we had a pound of mushrooms in our last basket.  When I saw the mushrooms, I thought I'd just have my husband eat them because he likes them raw.  

With a little time, I thought I'd seek out a recipe here, and found this recipe.  I made the bread to go with a steak dinner and I'll say that I loved the flavor!!  I did not expect to like it at all, and was shocked that I loved it!  I have added this recipe to our box of recipes and shared it with everyone! We love it!! Thank you for sharing!!

We had this for dinner last night and I made a couple minor changes.  I sauteed the shrooms, garlic, and green onions before adding to the bread.  I will saute a little longer next time because the mushrooms were still a little raw.  Next time I will add a little more garlic and some other spices.  Was a little bland, but will make again for sure!

As some of the other cooks, I to sautéed the mushrooms with a little bit of butter and I used minced onion and garlic powder from my cupboard.  I had thin slices of provolone cheese and shredded Parmesan and both of those worked great. This was a last minute recipe to make along with lasagna and it was great.  I will be making the original recipe one day but I think you can compromise if you don't have all the ingredients.  The family really liked it this way also and I don't think you can mess it up. Give it a try, you won't regret it.

Yum...so good. Perfect for a mushroom lover. I was kinda weary about tearing out all the soft part of the bread (which I froze for bread crumbs for another time), but it turned out perfectly! Quick easy appetizer.

Made this just like the recipe stated except I sauteed the mushrooms in a little butter first.  The flavor of the cheese mixture was delicious but the bread was very dry.  I only served half the loaf with dinner last night and wrapped the 2nd half in foil and popped it in the fridge to use tonight.  I will broil the 2nd half tonight and let you know how it turns out.  I'm hoping that the bread will stay soft, the edges lightly toasted and the cheese bubbly and gooey.
