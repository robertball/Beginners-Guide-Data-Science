I'm giving this 5 stars based off my husbands reaction after he took his first bite. "That is THE best cheese stick I have ever eaten".  These are time consuming  and a bit of a hassle but worth it in the end. They are soft in the middle instead of the snap you get from the traditional mozz sticks. The only problem I had is that even with moving fast while slicing and breading they still get super soft. You really need to stick them back in the freezer for 30 minutes or so after they are all breaded. I also recommend letting them cool on a wire baking sheet instead of paper towels.
