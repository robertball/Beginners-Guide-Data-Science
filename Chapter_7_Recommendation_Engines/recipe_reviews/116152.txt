No need to peel back husks - soak for 15, then cook for 15 on high, flip it, cook for another 15...remove from the grill and let sit for 15.  PERFECT every time.  So easy and so good.  The tassles just fall away when you remove the husks, easier than peeling them off when it is raw.  And don't worry if it looks burned, it will steam perfectly inside the husks.  Enjoy.

Awesome!!  I soaked my corn for approximately 30 minutes prior to pulling back the husks and buttering it.  I added some salt, pepper, and garlic powder to the butter mixture and got rave reviews from the family!  I might even add alittle paprika next time for color.  Corn was beautiful with the added color.  I doubt I will ever boil corn on the cob again!!

I didn't put the butter on before grilling, but after - what a mess that would be!  I soaked it in water as usual, grilled it then used a mixture of butter, parsley, salt, pepper, and parmesan cheese.

Excellent! I did soak my corn for several hours, then peeled back the husks and covered with the butter mixture. The corn was cooked perfectly and the butter/parsley flavor was mild, but very good. I'll be using this recipe often. Thanks!

This was good but I did not think it tasted any different than the way we normally prepare it(husked and wrapped in tinfoil).  It did make for a pretty presentation though.  My family liked the parsley and parmesan cheese added.  I just don't think I would make this again mostly because of the work involved and it is very messy when done.  The charred husks get all over everything.  For all the trouble, the taste is no different in our opinion.

yummm...this turned out great.  i didn't have parmesan so i added paprika and a little bit of cayenne pepper with the butter.  i also didn't peel back the husk before soaking...i soaked the corn, then peeled it afterwards to clean before covering it again.  i will definitely be making this more often :)

Hmmm, I guess I am different from everyone else, but I didn't think there was anything special about this. I followed the recipe exactly and I sure didn't have any nice charred corn kernels like the picture. If you wrap it back in the husk, how does that happen?? I thought it was messier and more time consuming to prepare and the corn basically just steamed in the husk. Which was fine... but not better than just boiling it. Worse actually, because the corn took on some of the smoke flavor from the grill, and I don't mean a yummy grill flavor, just smoke because it was on there for 20 minutes +. Sorry, this just wasn't for me. I think I will go back to boiling.

This is a nice way to serve sweet corn for guests because it looks very nice, but for all the trouble it was, it tasted just like boiled corn to me.  Maybe over a charcoal fire it would be more tasty, but on a gas grill it didn't have any kind of 'smokey grilled' flavor once the husks were taken off.

Love grilled corn! It has a subtle, but distinctly different "smoky" flavor grilled in their husks. This will be a well used recipe for this family! Thanks for the great recipe.

Good but a little overly complicated. Didn't soak the corn; never do.  Didn't wrap with string.  Waited until serving to add the butter, parsley and Parmesan which just seemed to make more sense to me.  We liked this, but both agree we could have easily done without the parsley and Parmesan.

This is how I always grill my corn and friends always love it when I make it for them. When I make it for my husband and I - I make his a little different by using barely any butter and adding chili powder to the parsley and parmesan. I think its the Parm that makes this so perfect. Making it again this week for sure!!!

Best corn ever!  It was perfect. Mine caught on fire and I even soaked them for 2 hrs.  Still turned out great.  I just grilled it with butter.  Im not sure why everyone thinks this is work.  These were not hard at all.  Just peel clean and butter it.  Wrap back up and cook. Great!  I think next time I will try to just throw them on the grill with out peeling them like one reviewer suggested.  We will see how those turn out.

so much flavor for so little prepping. This recipe kicks the old "boiled corn on the cob" butt.  Also like the way you can change the flavor of the corn to compliment what kind of meat your having. LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!

5 for taste, 3 for the time it takes to prepare them.  These do taste really good but it takes a long time to prepare them and they are also pretty messy once they come off the BBQ and you are trying to peel the husks off when they are still hot.  The charred husks get everywhere.  Cooked for 15 minutes on the BBQ and looked great didn't worry about closing the husks up too tight when cooking that gave the char marks on some of the corn.  Looks good and tastes good just lots of work and messy.  I put garlic butter on them (roasted garlic, butter, and some garlic salt) and they were a huge hit.

This is great tasting. I'd go 5 stars, but I've tried it twice and cannot seem to peal the husks and rewrap them. Tried soaking 20 min first time. 30 minutes second time. Just seem to tear the husks.

This corn was delicious.  I just realized that we forgot to add the Parmesan cheese before eating.  It was still delicious without it.  Served it with 'Hamburgers - It's in the Bun' from AR and cottage cheese.

I just cut the tassels and soak corn before grilling. The corn cleans easier I think.

Eh..not that impressed. Just as easy to do it in foil. The butter and parsley and cheese was nice..but wrapping and soaking didn't do anything special for this recipe.

Used the "15 minute Rule" as Debster suggested and it came out wonderfully. In the summer I won't boil corn on the cob again!

Wonderful!  Just used butter and with garden fresh corn from friends, nothing more was needed.  Had a fabulous roasted corn aroma and taste.  Will definitely make again.

This was pretty good. I soaked before hand and then slathered on the butter/parsley/cheese. I guess I was expecting it to be more flavorful-- it seemed like the butter mixture kind of seered off while on the grill. We needed to add a dash of salt and more butter after grilling.

The fresh parsley really enhanced the flavor of the sweet corn, I also added some minced garlic and the parmesan cheese added a nice salty flavor!

I obviously did something wrong.  Had no flavor at all.  Slathered in butter, parsley and parm and there was no flavor.  I will try again and re-rate if it works next time.

Great recipe. Needs a little bit of salt and pepper along with the parm cheese at the end.

I love corn on the cob slathered with butter and parmesan cheese. I had my first taste of this from a street vendor in the hispanic market in my city. After that I was hooked. These corn on the cobs are served up with almost every bbq I have during the summer.

Very good, butter mixture made the corn extra sweet.
