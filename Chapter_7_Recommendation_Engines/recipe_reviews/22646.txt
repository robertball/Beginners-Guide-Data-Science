I roll the marinated waterchestnuts in brown sugar before wrapping them in the bacon.  It's delicious!

I love this chestnut appetizer.  I have made it for my son's b-day parties and they are always well received.  I mix 1/2 cup brown sugar with 4 Tbsp soy sauce for 2 cans water chestnuts.  I like the addition of the brown sugar.  I also make sure to marinate them.  I will definitely make this recipe again!

I LOVE these.  I used 1/2 cup soy sauce and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  mixed it all together and then let them marinate.  I cooked mine at 375 for 25 minutes because I wanted them very crisp.  I made up a nice sauce of equal parts honey and mustard.  It was a perfect dip for these gems!  Thanks for posting!

My mother has been making this appetizer for decades but hers are not marinated, they are topped with barbeque sauce before baking. They are AWESOME. My mouth is watering just thinking about them!

I found I had to bake in oven much longer than anticipated (about 5 times as long as recipe stated).  The taste was pretty good.

These are SO good...they were all gobbled up at my birthday barbeque. I didn't bother marinating the water chestnuts, however, I did whisk together some soy sauce, fresh chopped ginger, garlic powder and dried onions. I also par-cooked my bacon just until soft before baking. Then, brushed the rolls with the mixture just before baking. Also, turn them once during the cooking time. Delicious!

These are gorgeous, definitely use the brown sugar it caramelises to counteract the saltiness of the bacon!

I have been making these for about 20 years.  Everyone loves these that I make them for.  I bake them for about 25 minutes on 350 and then broil them a few minutes to get the top a little crispier.

We make these for parties all the time but we add a few things. We put a little lettuce leaf and a halved cherry or grape tomato and make a ranch dip. It's a mini BLT, these are always gone at every party.

MY MOM HAS MADE THESE SINCE I WAS A KID. THE ONLY THING IS, WE ALWAYS USE BBQ SAUCE, NOT SOY SAUCE.  THEY GO FASTER THAN YOU CAN GET THEM ON A PLATE.

I make these on no occasion whatsoever they are that good. They are usually gone in an hour. I did have to bake them for about 25-30 mins though, which is fine, I want that bacon to be as done as possible so we can get them out of the oven and EAT! 2 THUMBS UP

I don't eat meat so I didn't get to try these, but I took them to a party and they were the first things to go. I marinated the chestnuts (2 cans, larger ones cut in half) in just soy for 6 hours per the recipe. I then rolled lightly in brown sugar per other suggestions. Used turkey bacon, cutting each slice in half and rolling loosely to allow room for the bacon to shrink. 2 cans chestnuts to 1 package bacon was almost perfect, with just enough bacon left over for breakfast. :) Cooked at 350 for 35 minutes. At that point they were pretty crispy, but I was still able to pop them in the oven for 10 to reheat when I got to the party. I soaked the toothpicks for 30 minutes and they didn't burn at all. The beauty of the turkey bacon is that there's very little fat so you don't have to switch pans partway through, it also cooks much more quickly...and of course is better for you. I thought this would be a time consuming thing to make, but it was really pretty easy. My Dad said they were just perfect with that bit of sugar added but that they'd be just as good without it. He gave them a 5.  This recipe is a keeper!

I definitely should have read some of the reviews before making these. They weren't anywhere near done in the time stated at the temp stated and they were extremely salty. On the other hand.. I should have anticipated that they would be quite salty. They were nothing like I expected or remembered them to be. Very highly disappointed. I'm glad I only did one can. I'll try it again adding brown sugar and won't marinade them so long either. Maybe a couple hours.

The cooking time was MUCH longer than 12 minutes (closer to 30-40 minute), and I didn't like them when they first came out of the oven.  I thought they were too salty.  I even used reduced salt bacon! However, that being said, I served them the following day after a quick reheat in the microwave, and my guests were quite happy.  These taste just the way they are supposed to! Next time I make them, I will add a little sugar just to cut the salt flavour a bit. This was exactly the recipe I was looking for, thanks for posting!

These took waaaaaay longer to cook than the recipe says.   I've had these things before and really liked them. If you follow this recipe, as virtually none of the reviewers did, you'll end up with slightly bacon flavored salt. I guess I learned my lesson too, don't just glance at the rating, actually read the reviews.

I use a variant of this recipe.  Instead of all soy sauce to marinate, I use 3/4 of the recommended amount of soy and the other 1/4 is a Honey Teriyaki.  After I marinate the water chestnuts, I roll them in brown sugar, then wrap in bacon.

There are never any left over and I can never make enough!!

My family really liked these. One of my daughters loved them so much she requested them for her birthday! They are a little time consuming, but we think it's worth it. They are great little crunchy snacks with wonderful flavor. I followed the recipe exactly, but after reading the comments I think I might try using some brown sugar like suggested, that sounds even yummier!

I've been eating these since I was little...we always make them in the microwave (between pieces of paper towel)...it takes less than 10 minutes.  Instead of marinating in soy, we dip the finished chestnuts in Catalina dressing!

Modified the recipe using Maple Bacon glazed with a SanJ brand orange sauce.  Superb!  I followed other tips and half cooked the bacon first (and while still cooling), wrapped it around the water chestnuts that had marinated for hours in a teryaki sauce.  (If you wrap the bacon after it's cooled or cook it too long, it will crumble when wrapping it).  This recipe change allowed be to wrap, toothpick and glaze...then drive 15 miles and bake it at 350 in under 10 mins at my mom's house. Crowd pleaser.  So many options for personalization.  Also...soak your toothpicks first or they'll burn up in the oven!

These are very good, my stepmother has been making them for years, my tip is to use bbq sauce, not soy sauce. These go very fast at all family functions.

We love these but we also add a slice of jalepeno  before we wrap with the bacon.  It's hot but soooo good.

Great 350° is too low. I had to cook more than 2x longer than recipe states. Should have cooked at higher temperature for shorter time. I prefer the water chestnuts to remain juicy and crunchy in contrast to bacon, but after cooking for so long chestnuts became soft and seemed greasier this way.
Also make sure to leave enough space on you baking tray as grease collects quickly! 
Overall, still great and you can never go wrong with these babies!! Everyone loves em!

I got a little creative and prepared them as directed but added a jalapeno slice to them before wrapping them.  I also did some rolled in brown sugar then wrapped in bacon. No one could decide which they liked better.

This is such a quick appetizer to make. The unexpected crunch of the water chestnut and the all american favorite bacon  . . . a perfect combo.

Love these! Also great to marinate in a mixture of half soy sauce and half worchestershire sauce for a little change. Simple to prepare, big bang for your buck and big crowd pleasers! Kids love to help prepare these little rollups too

Anything with bacon deserves at least 2 stars but these were very salty!

This recipe is delicious as is, but after trying it, now I always roll my water chestnuts in brown sugar before wrapping in bacon.  Ta da!  Even better.  Also, I felt they were a bit too salty, so I have switched to low-sodium soy sauce for this recipe.  Quick and easy crowd-pleaser for a house party.

Very good recipe, but if you marinate as long as the recipe states the chestnuts will be much, much too salty. I will make this again BUT marinate no longer than probably 4 hours. Thanks very much for sharing :)

I rolled the chestnuts in brown sugar before cooking, as mentioned by many others. The finished appetizer was pretty good, nothing really special, but definitely delicious. I will add some different spices next time to add flavor. Lovely recipe.

I also cut back on the soy sauce and add teriyaki marinate, cooked for 40 minutes.  They turned out pretty good.  Thanks for the recipe.  Will make again.
