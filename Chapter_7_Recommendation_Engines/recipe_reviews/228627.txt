These work well with applesauce (organic/unsweetened) instead of pumpkin also. I use coconut oil or another Paleo fat,.

The one common factor I don't like about paleo pancakes is the length of time they take to cook.  Out of all the recipes I have tried this one is the best!   5 minutes per side is acceptable timewise for me but still takes a while and is obviously just the nature of a paleo pancake.  I followed the recipe with these changes: I used about triple the amount of almond milk and scooped a 1/4 measuring cup about half filled into a non-stick skillet oiled with coconut oil.  I gently smooshed them flatter with the bottom of the measuring cup.  I was able to get three 3 inch pancakes per batch for a total of 9.  I added 1/2 cup of pumpkin along with the listed spices plus a bit of pumpkin pie spice and nutmeg plus a tiny smidge of cloves.  I used baking powder instead of soda in the same amount listed.  Topped with maple syrup and had sausage links to round out my paleo lunch.  Taste and texture were wonderful! I would definitely make these yummy cakes again!

Loved this!  The pumpkin and spice flavors were delicious. They were not too dense either.  Just perfect!

We really liked these pancakes.  It took a little longer to make than what Im used to but I also have only made them out of a mix.  I didnt have cloves so I used nutmeg and it was good.  I also used coconut milk instead of almond milk.  I agree that it really needs alot more liquid they were way too thick.  I also use coconut oil to cook them in and coconut oil on top of them instead of butter.  If you dont really expect them to taste like normal pancakes you will like them as a yummy breakfast treat.

These were suprisingly wonderful. My batter seemed a little thick so I added a bit more almond milk. But everyone in the family loved them!

I have had to add more almond milk than the recipe calls for.  Not a big deal.  I usually double or triple this batch so that we have grab and go options.  Just made 10 muffins with a double batch. Added crumbled pecans in half and raisins in the other half.  So much easier than standing at the stove flipping cakes.

These were pretty tasty.  Reminded me of pumpkin bread.  The batter was way too thick and I added additional water till it was spoonable into the skillet.  When you can't eat wheat anymore........you look for things to replace it.

These are great Paleo pancakes. I did double the recipe and used Tbsp of grass fed butter and poured in a little extra almond milk to get a thinner pancake. As far as Paleo goes these are fantastic.

Not a fan of these. I agree with other reviews, way to thick. Flavor might have been better with nutmeg instead of cloves.

These were pretty good but I wasn't a huge fan of the texture, it was mealy. I prefer a gluten free pancake that uses coconut flour and a little quinoa flour.

Worth the effort. The keys to making this recipe work are to make sure the batter is the right consistency and to keep the pancakes small in size.  Add almond milk or water in small quantities until the batter is thin enough to mostly fall off a whisk, maybe even using 3 times the quantity of liquid called for in the recipe. In the pan I gently tamp down the top of each pancake as I set batter down with a large spoon or small ladle, keeping pancakes to no larger than 2 1/2" diameter. Because this recipe takes longer to make then regular pancakes, and the pancakes take longer to cook, I make a double batch and freeze the extras. Covered and refrigerated, the batter will also keep for several days. These are savory pancakes. Don't expect them to taste like regular pancakes, but they taste great.

So far this is the best Paleo pancake recipe that I have tried. I used coconut oil versus vegetable oil, but everything else was exactly as listed in the recipe. I really liked the pumpkin and spice flavor. The texture is not like a traditional pancake, but it is still OK. I will make these again.

My 3 year old liked it, but not my 5 year old. I like them too just have to cut the recipe in half. Do just a spoonful size  when cooking it in the pan, they hold much better.

The flavor was pretty tasty, but would have liked more of a pumpkin flavor. They seemed a little eggy. Also used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and felt the pancakes soaked up the oil. Next time I think I'll try maybe lightly coating the pan just so they don't stick, and experiment with more pumpkin, but these were well worth it for a healthy, paleo breakfast.

I substituted almond coconut blend milk, and added a bit extra because the batter was thick.  Think I would add extra spice, but plan on making it again.  Thanks for the recipe.  Thumbs up ... Fall is here.

Used coconut oil, not veg. Used all egg whites. First one sort of raw & fell apart. Lower the heat, cook longer gives best results. Used the pure maple syrup and omitted all the dry flavorings. Used full 1 tsp B powder & tad more nut milk. Excellent nutty texture with almond meal.

Very, very yummy pancakes. I used coconut oil, coconut milk (instead of almond milk, watch out for carrageenan) and pumpkin pie spice! I too found the recipe a little too thick, but added more liquid and it was fine. Enjoy!

These were OK. I quadrupled the recipe and maybe that was part of the problem, but they were really thick and really dry. I added milk twice to even be able to scoop them onto the skillet. We had to put lots of syrup and applesauce on them. I added walnuts and chocolate chips to the batter, which gave them good flavor. My family ate them and didn't complain much, but for me it was a lot of work for little benefit.

Wouldn't make this again. Too much effort for such a small batch and too nutty and mushy. I've came across better pancake recipes that I would use next time

We made these last night.  Didn't use coconut flour/used flour with coconut fine flakes and almond meal I used flour and sliced almond blended together. Everything else was the same. Pancakes were light and fluffy and very good.

The last couple of paleo pancake recipes I tried out fell apart and caused much frustration.  These did not.  i followed the recipe exactly and they turned out pretty good!

I'm new to the paleo lifestyle and I'm still looking for good recipes. I absolutely loved these! I used coconut oil and nutmeg like other people suggested, and while these were really thick, they had a great texture and taste. Loved them!

My first batch wasn't that great, couldn't taste the pumpkin.  I doubled the amount of pumpkin in my next batch and it was great!  The taste and texture were perfect.

Yum! The whole family is lovin this!  I recommend coconut or grapeseed oil instead of vegetable.  For a family of four, with small kids, I recommend tripling it. Thank you thischris, these are fantastic!

Very tasty pancakes! I switched the vanilla and maple syrup amounts on accident, but it made more sense to do that anyways. 2 Tbsp vanilla didnt sound right. Also I didn't have almond milk so I used whole fat coconut milk. They seemed a little thick so I added more milk to thin it just a hair. They were delicious. Thank you for this recipe :)

Edible but I've been paleo for over 2 years and this was probably my least favorite of all the pancake recipes I've tried. Very dry.

Very good!  However, I use coconut or olive oil as vegetable oil is not paleo.  Most have been genetically modified for human consption.
