Don't let the amount of chives scare you off.  Chives are great in egg salad and when scaled back to 2 servings it is only 2 whole eggs + 1 egg white and 1 Tablespoon of chives.  I did use 3 whole eggs as I didn't know what I would use just one yolk for.

Very good! I put it on a bed of lettuce that I had tossed with oil, salt and pepper.

AMAZING RECIPE!  I  used a dozen eggs, yoke & all and the only change I might make is to cut the salt & celery salt to a quarter TSP instead of a half.

This was good, although I think there is way too much salt. I think next time I make it I will either half the celery salt and kosher salt or just eliminate one of them.

I was looking for a simple recipe for egg salad to use up the Easter eggs my daughter had made.  This is a good, basic egg salad and perfect for what I was looking for.

After I added the kosher salt, didnâ€™t need any more salt. So I left out the celery salt. Loved the flavor and ease of the recipe.

I love this recipe but I did make some substitutions: a pinch of red pepper flakes instead of paprika and green olives. My nana always added olives to hers so it was a nod to her. I will definitely use this as a go-to when I want a quick dinner.

I added red onion and real celery pieces topped it with romain leaves.
