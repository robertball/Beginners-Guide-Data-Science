I had 2 lbs of stew meat so I doubled the recipe.  I omitted the French onion soup and used 1 pkg of dry onion soup mix, along with 1 can of beef broth like the other reviewers suggested.  I also only used 1 cup of water.  It turned out better than I expected.  The meat was tender, and I liked the fact that I didn't have to brown it first.  The only thing I would say is that it does need some extra seasoning, maybe next time I will tweak it and add some extra spices to it.  Overall good recipe, nice and quick prep, took the whole 5 hours to cook.  Update:  I make this all the time.  I have a large family so I still double the recipe.  I don't use the french onion soup at all.  I use 2 cans mushroom soup, 1 pkg onion soup mix, and 1 cup low sodium beef broth, no additional water - I think that is what makes it bland.  Extra seasonings I add are pepper, Maggi, and Worcestershire sauce.  I also add an onion (but we really like onions!).  Turns out tasty for me every time.  I sometimes cook this on 300 for 4 hours to save time, although it is better to cook it as the original recipe states.

I've tried many beef stew recipes, all of which have disappointed my husband, except for this one which we both loved.  I followed the suggestions of some other reviewers and added 1 10.75 oz can beef broth, 1 cup water, 1 package dry onion soup mix, instead of the water and french onion soup that is called for.  I also put this in a crock pot on high for 4 hours.  I doubled all of the vegetables, and added almost a full 10.75 oz can of corn (did I mention that we really love our veggies!).  At the end, it was still soupy, so I thickened it up with 2 Tablespoons of corn starch which made it perfect.  With the changes that were made, I give this a full 4 stars for taste and ease of preparation -it is the simplest dish you could make.  I will be making this again soon!

This recipe was delicious! I did however take a suggestion and use onion soup mix, and 1 cup of water. I also added celery and worcestershire sauce. It turned out yummy. It is a definite make again!

The best beef stew that I ever made.  I should have cut my potatoes a little larger because they seemed to dissolve in the sauce.  Even though, this dish tasted wonderful!!  Thanks.

Our family isn't big fans of stew, but we thought this was great.  Actually i used the ideas from the others, as far as the lipton onion soup mix and water, however i thought it was a little too salty. next time i'll use minced onions and my own seasonings.  i also added a nice scoop of minced garlic.

This was so tasty and easy.  I used one can of beef consomme and 1/2 package of onion soup mix, about two cups water and two bay leaves.  I put in a COVERED dutch oven as I let it cook for about 6 hours while I was gone and was afraid of drying out since I couldn't stir it.

I put this in the slow cooker/crockpot for 4 hours and it was tasty. It's sufficent for a family dinner, but not quite impressive tasting to serve guests. I'd make it again for our family meal. Added 1 Cup water and 1 pkg onion soup mix. The gravy/sauce is thick and creamy.

Amazing, delicious, simple! I've been making this stew in the fall since I found the recipe in "Tried and True Favorites" about 7 years ago and it always hits the spot!  Great recipe, exactly as written, thanks for sharing!

I just made this tonight and it was very good using another reviewers suggestion of 2 cans of cream of mush. 1 cup of beef broth and the onion soup mix. I also add onion and garlic powder and pepper because we like that. I had double the meat, for our large family. What i liked best about this was not having to brown the meat. I ALWAYS brown the meat but this time I just didnt have the time and it was just great without this step. I was a little short on time so I started it , covered, for an hour @350 then  reduced and cooked uncovered for awhile to thicken. Thanks for the all around good recipe that did not involve browning!!

I made this stew for Sunday dinner and it was a major disappointment.  Very bland and it didn't look very appetizing either.

I gave this four stars because of the ease of preparation!  Pretty darn easy for a decent meal.  I did find the taste a little bland however; I'll have to alter SOMETHING next time to improve the taste.

Yum! With a little tweaking, this was simply FANTASTIC!!! As is, this seemed pretty basic. A stew with absolutely NO seasoning seemed odd (not to mention boring) to me, so I made it my mission to doctor this up a bit. :) I appreciate trying a recipe as written initially, but I knew that my hubs and I would not care for this without making a few necessary adjustments to suit our tastes. To start, I subbed beef broth for the water called for (I was afraid the water would dilute everything else). I then added 1/2 t each of French thyme and marjoram, a bay leaf, several shakes of Worcestershire sauce and a GENEROUS dose of s&p. To use up some produce I already had, I added 3 small stalks of coarsely chopped celery (including the leaves), 2 small (chopped) yellow onions, a few cloves of minced garlic and a tad bit more carrots than called for. I also added ~ a cup of frozen pearl onions and subbed Campbell's cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup for plain 'ol mushroom soup. My final change was to NOT peel my quartered (baby Idaho) potatoes. With these changes, this was a phenomenal stew! Served over egg noodles with a sprinkling of fresh parsley and biscuits on the side. Thanks for sharing such a great, basic recipe KARPITS! I will be making this often! :-)

I used the suggestions of B_32's review and this stew came out very well. Don't cut up the beef too small though because the pieces will be a little overdone and tough.  I would make this again.

I give this recipe 4 stars for flavor, but 2 for presentation. It doesn't look that appetizing but I swear it tastes good. I added about a half package of fresh mushrooms and cooked it in the slow cooker on high for 4 hours. This will be in the rotation at our house now for sure.

This is a family favorite.  We've did make a change though.  We use a can of tomato soup in place of the french onion soup and I add onion powder to equal an onion.  My kids won't eat anyhing that they can find even the tiniest piece of onion.

This beef stew turned out to be the BEST tonight! Pure comfort food! I did, however, toss this all in the crockpot on high for 4 hours. The meat was sooooo tender! I added a can of stewed tomatoes and a packet of dry brown gravy mix. I also added an extra cup of water. I will be making this again, for certain!

This stew was delicious.  I used an onion soup packet instead of canned soup, and only used a cup of water. I used canned white potatoes instead, so I added them in after 2 hours. I added some canned mushrooms as well.  It smelled so good baking, and tasted just as great.  Perfect recipe! Thank you!

All in all it was pretty good!  I took a couple of the suggestions and added an envelope of onion soup mix and decreased the water to 1 cup.  I also added a bit more of the potatoes and carrots, but not much.  It did seem soupy at first when it came out of the oven, but it thickened up afer it sat a few minutes.  Not a bad beef stew!  Worth giving a shot! :)

Great recipe. I made a few changes, used two packets onion soup mix with 4 cups of water, 1 family sized can of condensrd cream of mushroom soup, 5 lbs red potatoes cubed, about 1 1/2lbs stew beef cut to bite size, two cans of sweet peas, two cans of sliced carrots, pepper to taste.  I mixed soup with 4cups water, added beef and potaoes and then more water to cover potatoes, added pepper.  Simmered it on the stove when potatoes are soft added peas and carrots bring to boil and serve. So this recipe was more of an inspiration.  Definitely going to make it again.

My family LOVED LOVED LOVED this recipe! My husband was so pleased and proud that I made homemade beef stew.  When I told him we were having beef stew for dinner he thought we were having a 'canned dinner' night.  He was pleasantly surprised!  Recipe was simple and easy to prepare a must for a working mom with kids.

I also subbed one packet onion dip and 1 cup water and a can of beef broth instead of french onion and water listed. The flavor was great but my meat and potatoes were still not tender enough.

Yummy!!! You must try this. I left out the peas. (we hate frozen peas) I substituted a little red wine for some of the water and added 2 cloves of minced garlic. You won't believe how good this is-especially for being so simple. The meat is so tender and the whole dish is so flavorful.

This was a good stew but a little bland and a few procedural changes were needed:  1. I doubled all the ingredients EXCEPT for the soups and water. After about 4 hours it was still extremely soupy, so I added a slurry of 3 TBSP flour and cold water to thicken it up.  2. After the slurry was added, I turned up the heat to 400 F degrees.  
 
I will make the stew again but will add salt, black and white pepper, roasted garlic, several quartered onions and instead of peas, toss in an entire bag of frozen sugar snap peas towards the end!  Yum.

I don't  have a crock pot so this was a very easy way to make beef stew. It was delicious. I don't like peas though so I didn't add them.

I cooked on the stove top and was ready in about 45 min.  Browned stew meat first.  Added dry onion soup mix, water, and beef broth.  Added vegetables and cooked until tender.  Served with noodles.

This is a great stew recipe.  I too added onion soup mix (powder) instead of the canned and increased the water to 2 cups.   I also added some corn (leftover in the fridge) which gave it some color. Thanks for the easy and tasty recipe!

I must have done something wrong. It did not cook in 4-5 hours. The potatoes were still hard? Alittle bland so I added parsley and other seasonings. If the potatoes had turned out better it would have been decent.SORRY

I made some changes...I use 2 Cups Water and Onion Soup Mix (Did Not Have Canned On Hand)
I also added chopped celery and 2 cans of mixed
vegetables in addtion to the recipe! But I am sure
without all of these addtions it would still be great!

This is a fantastic,easy,yummy,hearty,I'll make it for my mother-in-law kind of casserole. It takes a little time in the oven, but it is worth the wait. Thanks Karen for this recipie.
P.S I'm from Australia and we don't have condenced french onion soup here. Instead I used dry packet mix and it was [as you'll know by now]just perfect.

Everything about this recipe was great. So easy and very tasty. My boyfriend (age 39) absolutely loves it. So do I (age 41). I left out the peas though because it was getting late at night and I had to put the stew in the refrigerator.

This stew was pretty good, and tasty.  I would recommend checking it while it is cooking, to make sure it doesn't get dried out.  It would be good to have egg noodles as a side.

The recipe as is needs some zipping up.  Next time I'll add some thyme and as was suggested a package of onion soup mix.  I'll also throw in some mushrooms.  Also will reduce water to one cup as it was very soupy and I had to thicken with flour and water.  I also had to turn up the heat after four hours.  I was wondering if covering the dish would have made a difference?  At any rate, this "starter" recipe shows great potential -- it just needs to be worked with.

I doubled the meat and vegies in this recipe  and added some dry onion soup mix and some beef stock ....my youngest son came home from school and asked "What smells so good?" The stew was WONDERFUL.....so easy to put together and fills the house with mouth-watering aroma! The whole family loved it and rated it 5 stars!! Thank you Karen!

I have never had anything like this.  This is the best stew I haave ever had!! I thought cooking it for 4-5 hours was a long time, but i thought it was well worth it. I cooked it for 5.  This is going to be a regular dinner around here.
