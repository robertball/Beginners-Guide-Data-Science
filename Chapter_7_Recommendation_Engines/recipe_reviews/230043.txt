Delicious and so simple!  I put everything in the slow cooker on "low" and let it go all day for the evening meal.  Everyone loved them and I did, too.  Thanks!

The glaze was very sweet but it was nice added touch that complimented the carrots. The cooking time was off... the carrots were undercooked.  Next time I make this I will just cook the carrots on the stove top until they are completely tender and then just add the glaze to it.

Not too bad. I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was really too sweet for my taste, almost like candy. Perhaps it should be called "Candied Carrots" instead?  I did use fresh squeezed orange juice so the only added sugar was natural. If I did make it again I would cut the sugar back a bit.
Additionally I found that the carrots really need to cook a bit longer on the stove top as they only soften a touch in the oven for stated 20 minute bake. In fact I cooked them an additional 10 minutes in the oven [30 minutes total, covered with foil to create a steam like bath] and they were barely softer as when I removed them from the stove top.
Overall a nice "starter" recipe and with a little tweaking you can make it your own - unless you like super sweet, extra firm glazed carrots then this is definitely your recipe. Thanks Katie H.

I've made this recipe twice now and we really enjoy it. A nice twist on a simple vegetable. Left overs are even better the next day. They seem to soak up the flavors. I used a bag of mini carrots and this couldn't have been easier. Will make it many more times. And I always have those ingredients on hand. Thanks Katie.

This was very good but I think I would cut back on the cinnamon a bit so there is just a hint of cinnamon, it did overpower a bit. But still very good!

I read the other reviews first and made a couple adjustments.  We put these on the BBQ and slow cooked them for 4 hours.  We doubled the amount of orange juice and did not add any sugar.  They were very good.  Lots of compliments from the guests.  Thanks for the idea.

I put everything in the slow cooker - had three bags of petit carrots I had to use up - so tripled the sugar (used brown sugar only) and the juice and butter.  Also didn't use the cinnamon - added fresh tarragon and fresh ground nutmeg.  Great!!  Thanks for the idea!

I know Iâ€™m going off the recipe but I did these without the sugar, just cinnamon and OJ and they were still very delicious! Save yourself the extra sugar and cals and enjoy them maybe even more without the guilt (:

Amazing! I had to lower the portion sizes because I wasn't making it for a crowd, but no matter what I would like to try this again. It's simple and easy, and the result was delicious.

Cut back the sugars to 1/4 cup each like so many people suggested.  I used mini carrots and cooked them for 7 minutes.  They were done.  I liked everything but the fact that there was no glaze.  All of the liquid was in the bottom of the pan and the carrots looked kinda dry.  Disappointed about no glaze but they were tasty.

This got rave reviews from my friends and family!  I used baby carrots and I steamed them 10 minutes until tender first. I only used 1/4 C brown sugar, no other sugar, and I added 1/4 teas each of salt and black pepper and 1/8 teas each of ground cloves and nutmeg. Definitely a recipe I'll repeat!

Wonderful for Christmas.  I used the crinkle-cut carrots from the store, cut the sugar and brown sugar in half as some suggested, and the dish turned out perfect!!

I was looking for an oven glazed carrot side dish recipe for my pot roast. I did make the conversion to 3 servings, there were only two of us and wanted some leftovers....there were none! I used organic cinnamon so cut back on that measurement. Thank you Katie this dish was excellent.

super simple and easy - we just used a bag of baby carrots instead of chopping/cleaning the reg carrot stalks - great way to make a carrot for a nice meal - takes it up a notch w/o having to try too hard.  thanks!
