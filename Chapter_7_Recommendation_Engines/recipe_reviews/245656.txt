Followed the directions.  Easy to make. First time I've used amaranth flour. Distinctive flavor but we're enjoying them.

Depending  on where you live, you may need to add a little water.  
If you are, like me - impatient, then use yeast instead of baking soda.
I could've let these rise another couple of hours, because after all - it's sourdough.
