This was pretty good. I sliced some baby portobello mushrooms and added them to the sauce for about 5 minutes of cooking time.  After tasting the cheese sauce, I did not detect much ranch flavor, so I doubled the amount of  ranch seasoning. This is a nice variation to a basic cheese sauce. I will make it again, and probably add a little sriracha sauce  to kick up the flavor  a notch.

I enjoyed it but kids didn’t approve. They’re just picky
