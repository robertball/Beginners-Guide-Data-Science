Delicious.  I used a glass 9x13, parchment paper on bottom and sprayed with pam.  Baked about 25 minutes until top looked dry and toothpick was dry (although knife came out wet, it was perfect.  You don't want to cook these all the way through).  I reccomend 1 cup white, 1 cup packed brown sugar.  I used butter.  Use 1 1/4 c peanut butter, 1 1/2 tsp baking pwdr, 1 3/4 c chocolate chips.

Yum!  This recipe didn't quite satisfy my craving for a peanut-buttery chocolate delight, but it came pretty close.  Instead of a 10x15, I used a 9x13 and sprayed it with Pam and it ended up taking about 25 minutes- but worth the wait.  It was light in texture but heavy in the stomach-so be careful about taking seconds!  I used smooth peanut butter and forgot the vanilla- but I still rate it ****.  This is better served not right-from the oven.

This recipe was tasty, but not exactly what I had in mind. Rather than a chewy blondie, this one was more flaky. I too made this in a 9x13 pan and cookied it for about 20 minutes. I'd probably try a different recipe next time I was in the mood for blondies.

I'm giving these a 5 star because my friends though they were so good!! I told my friend about AR and she said she'd give them a 5 star, so there ya go:)  I thought these were really nice too, but I did use: Butter instead of Marg, 1/2 less flour, & a lil less sugar (used 1/2 brown sugar instead of white).  These were really really greasy (i guess from the PB??) that's one thing i didn't really like.  And it seemed like they needed more of a peanut butter flavor to them.  I will probably make these again though since they went over so well with my friends!!

Excellent and easy recipe but very sweet. I used 3/4 cup of creamy peanut butter and added 1 tablespoon of cocoa powder. Thanks to other reviews I baked 25 minutes and they turned out perfectly. I might cut the sugar a bit next time but will definitely make again.

This recipe is yummy and simple to make, but a little rich for my husband and me.  As previous poster mentioned, I made mine in a glass 9x13 and baked for about 30 minutes, and also you really want to let this cool completely before trying to cut it.

Very good blonde brownie recipe! The PB is a nice alternative to plain Blondies. I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar, butter instead of margarine, and which chocolate chips instead of chocolate chips

Cut recipe and pan size in half.....the time took 26 minutes though, but the results were delicious.  This is definitely a keeper.

Incredible! So good! I used butter instead of margarine, and milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet ones. I cooked it for 35 min, and when I tried to eat just a little bit of it, it very quickly turned into a lot more than that, because it is irresistible. I'll do it again for guests, or in the worst of winter for comfort food. My boyfriend loved it and had it with milk, and our friends loved it too. Thank you for this!

Made these with "dilemmalyn's" adjustments and they were absolutely fantastic!  The husband loved them, the boss loved them, I loved them : )  Very moist and "peanutbuttery."  Dense, sweet, and decadent.  In a word, DELICIOUS!

These are fantastic!!!! Easy to throw together with ingredients you probably already have in the pantry.  I did all measurements as stated in the recipe, but the only thing I changed was put the batter in a 9x13. It took about 25-30 minutes. I just checked to make sure the batter was no longer jiggly to know that it was done baking.  Very rich, but a great change of pace from cookies and chocolate brownies! Thank you for a great 5 star recipe!!!!

The first time I made this I followed the suggestions and used ½ white sugar and ½ brown sugar, they were tremendous.  Had to make them again but this time I used  M&M’S, just as great - if not better! Cooking time is much longer for me then the recipe states.

No parchment paper or jellyroll pan? I just used my 9x13 cake pan and then sprayed it with cooking spray and floured the bottom and sides really well. They were so easy to remove once they cooled. And yummy! I used 1 cup all purpose and 1 cup whole wheat flour too. They were great and a delicious alternative to chocolate brownies.

Overall. this is good, but it does need some tweaking.  I made it in a larger (11x17) jelly roll pan, yet I had to bake it longer than recommended (I added about 5 minutes).  I removed the entire blondie using the parchment paper, and easily cut it using a pizza slicer.  After tasting it, I think I know why the peanut taste does not come through enough.  I believe this recipe needs added salt - maybe 1/4-1/2 t.?

I had no margarine, so I used butter. This is the most amazingly delicious recipe in the world! Okay, maybe second ; )   . I would probably fight over them honestly . I did bake about 7 minutes more so they were a little crispier on the edges. Sigh....  I am on the way to the kitchen to make the second batch in a week! I'm hiding half a batch straight away! Thank you!

Following other reviewers, I used butter, half white and half brown sugar and increased the peanut butter to 11/4 cup. I also added a pinch of salt, but next time I will add more to bring out the peanut butter flavor. Baked in a 13x9 pan for about 35 minutes. Great base recipe to tweak to your tastes!

I used half butter, half margerine and half white, half brown. I also used Kissables baking candies. This needed another egg, the batter was a little dry until I added the third egg. Easy to put together, smells wonderful while baking. These were good, but not as good as the  Chewy Peanut Butter Brownies from this site. EDITED: My husband thought these were dry, as did I. I think if I make these again, I'd cut back on the flour by a half cup or so.

These were very simple to make with ingredients that I always have on hand.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1 cut brown sugar.  I baked them in a 9X13 pan for exactly 30 minutes.  They were still very soft but I let them completely cool before slicing them.  Delicious.

I did sub in one cup of brown sugar for one cup of white, and if you’re like me and don’t have a jelly roll pan, cooking in a 9 x  13 takes 20-25 min, but these were fantastic! Will be making more ASAP!  Thanks for posting!

I loved these.  I followed the others' suggestions to put it in a 9x13 inch pan.  I baked it for 35 minutes.  I added only 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips and I thought that was plenty.  The 1 cup of peanut butter really makes a difference--other peanut butter recipes only call for  1/2 cup. (That's why I picked this recipe to try)

I made these in a 9x13. They were really quick to mix up and a really tasty end result. I added a bit of salt to the mixture, which I do to most of my baked goods. Great recipe!

They were good, but not great.  I didn't think they were peanut butter-y enough.

Think of it along the line of a peanut butter chocolate chip shortbread cookie, not a brownie. I made it for a day of meetings at work and the really went over well. Also, I did use a 10 x 15 pan as suggested and was able to cut it into 44 pieces.

Excellent! These came out so good! These were much better than the Chewy Peanut Butter Brownies recipe from this site. That one had a weird texture and not enough peanut butter taste for me, this one was a perfect texture, nice and chewy, yet still soft and really peanut buttery. They were super easy to make with ingredients I always have, and I like how it doesn't use brown sugar, because I usually run low on that. I used Jif whipped chocolate peanut butter(on clearance at Big Lots for less than a dollar!), so because it was whipped I used a heaping cup of it, since I wasn't sure how to measure it. It gave it a light chocolate flavor, not heavy like regular brownies. The only other change I made was an addition of some salt, everything else I kept the same. Came out perfect! I served them warm out of the oven with black raspberry ice cream, tasted like a PB&J sandwich! YUM! The leftovers, will be packed with lunches this week, there will be happy kids this week! Thanks so much for the recipe, it's definitely a keeper! :)

These were great when I was craving peanut butter and chocolate. They were nice and moist too even the next day.

I'm not a peanut butter fan, but my family is.  So I gave these a try. They were AWESOME!  I made some minor modifications, like I cooked it for 25 minutes longer, but it could have been because of the type of pan.

These are great tasting blondies. Made only half of recipe for 10 servings. My husband and son loved these. Used self rising flour so I omitted the baking powder. Added peanut butter chips instead of chocolate. Very good. Thankyou for sharing!

This was very good. Instead of putting the chocolate chips in the blondies, we melted them and poured it on top when it was done baking and let it harden. It uses WAY too much margarine which makes it very wet so I suggest cutting the amount in half or by a third. We also chopped up some peanuts and threw them in the batter. Cook time takes way longer than 15 minutes. Other than that, these are delicious!

Delicious treat, couldnt resist eating a whole bunch. Wouldnt hurt to add an extra kick with toffee pieces. Cooked for twice as long (30 min.) as called for and they were perfect.

Really, really good, and really easy! I'll definitely make these again. I like that the recipe didn't call for brown sugar, because I don't always have that on hand. These aren't "too sweet" and have just the right amount of chocolate & peanut butter taste. They turned out great using a 10x15 pan.

Good recipe. Nice that there is no brown sugar cuz I never have any on hand!!  I followed another review and added a bit more baking soda and peanut butter and used real butter since I had it.  If you use the 9x13 pan, definately cut the choc. chips to 1 1/2 cups otherwise it's too chocolatey.  A pinch of salt is needed to define the sweetness, but overall, this is a very easy recipe and worth the little bit of effort to get a really nice treat!
