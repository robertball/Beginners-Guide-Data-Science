Made as written and this turned out perfect. I anticipated a huge mess in the basket of my air fryer when it was done but there was hardly any mess at all. This is a great recipe!

I love this recipe for just 2 people. Tastes like fall and so good. I bought over-sized Fuji Apples and added a bit more pecans with the same amount of brown sugar and flour and butter.

This was not bad, I liked it, but one of my kids did not and she eats everything. I think the nuts (even though they were frozen when I put them in the air fryer) got too toasty for her. I'm not sure I loved the flour on them - not sure it contributed anything really - but the cinnamon butter flavor was nice, especially with ice cream. Like a bit of crustless low-sugar apple pie. We will make this again.
