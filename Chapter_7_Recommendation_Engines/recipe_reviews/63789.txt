I am a chocoholic. This is too die for. I didn't have any raspberry jam so I used orange marmalade instead. I just heated it in the microwave until warm and drizzled it over the pie. HEAVEN!!

Very Good! I forgot to add the milk to most of the chocolate mixture, and cooked it too long so it was a bit stiff. I found that there was too much filling to fit in the pre-made crust. But this pie (or should I say "cake") pleased everyone who tried it. The warm raspberry jam really made it! I wouldnt let anyone have it without the topping! Fabulous!

It tastes even better when it has chilled overnight

I made this cheesecake so many times and we love it. I agree it is too much chocolate if you want to make just swirls in your cheesecake. However I use the whole cup of chips. I pour to the crust less than half of the vanilla cheesecake mixture and mix the rest with melted chocolate chips and make a top layer. I think this is very good basic recipe which you can work with. I served it several times with strawberry sauce and used Oreo crust, or omited chocolate chips and put strawberries as a middle layer, or mixed rasberries to the cheesecake mixture and so on. I tried several cheesecake recipes but this one is my favorite.

I made this for Thanksgiving for my step-father, and drizzled the top with melted raspberry jelly and dallops of whipped cream. Everyone had a piece, and my step-father requested 2 be made for Christmas so that he could keep one for himself!

We didn't find this recipe too exciting.  I'd just as soon make a regular cheesecake.

Good dessert!  I would definitely make this again.  It seemed that there was a bit too much chocolate left over, so next time, I will probably cut back to 1/2 cup.  Overall, received rave reviews from my "taste testers!"
