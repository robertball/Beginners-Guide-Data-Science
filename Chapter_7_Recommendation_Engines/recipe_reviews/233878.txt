Loved this recipe!  Panzanella salad is such a great way to showcase  summertime vegetables and the fresh basil took it over the top! We had never tried buffalo before and we were pleasantly surprised how much we liked it!  Flank steak can be tough and chewy and I was hesitant to make this without a marinade to tenderize it, but, I am glad I didn't.  It was tender and had wonderful flavor.  I used lemon pepper instead of regular pepper, but, prepared everything else according to the recipe. If you haven't tried buffalo - give it a try!

This was excellent!   The bison was perfect...just perfect.  I loved this salad and will be making it again.

Well liked despite my changes.  My grocery store does not have bison so I used beef.  I like to save my  bread ends in the freezer for such recipes.  I was a little skimpy with the tomatoes. (ran out).  And I didn't have cucumbers, I added chopped carrot instead.
