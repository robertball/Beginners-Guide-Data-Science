THIS SALAD IS AWESOME!!  I like the noodles crunchy, so I add them about 1-2 hours before serving.  Using the prepared (already shredded tri color) cabbage bags from the grocer makes this a breeze!!  I substituted garlic flavored Rice Wine Vinegar and left out the chicken.  Doubled the recipe and there were NO LEFTOVERS!!  Thank you!!

This was very good.  I used about half the amount of vinegar called for, and we thought that was enough.  I used sesame oil and added some diced celery.  I'll make this one again!

This is such a great salad, amazing how just a few simple ingredients can be so flavorful. For those on a tight budget like myself, its just as good without the chicken. Also, if you have rice wine vinegar, I'd recommend using that instead of regular white vinegar.

5 + stars. This salad is wonderful,used cole slaw mix instead of cabbage, and cut the recipe way down becouse it is just my husband and me. Also mixed all the seasoning together first then poured over the salad. This is a dish I will be sharing at get togethers and pot luck dinners. Can't wait for others to try it. Thanks so much Susan for the recipe.  Elaine

If you like coleslaw, you'll LOVE this salad.  I you don't like coleslaw (like me, because of the soupy mayonaisse), you'll LOVE this salad.  Definitely a great dish to prepare in advance to cut down on pre-party work.  And the taste is addictive.  Finally a new use for Ramen noodles.  They're not just for college students anymore.

Very good salad.  I made the oil in the recipe 1/2 sesame and 1/2 vegetable oil.  I also added 2 shredded carrots. When I was making the dressing I added one minced garlic clove to the dressing ingredients and then let it boil over medium heat.  Once dressing chilled, I tossed it with the salad and chilled again  Everyone loved it!

This was a tasty, and easy-to-make recipe.  I wish I had added a little red cabbage though for color's sake.  I like that it is oil, and not mayonaise, based.  Tastes good and has good texture, but needs a little more exciting flavor, though.  I added a soy sauce/sesame oil mix to it and gave it a better flavor.

Great recipe. Make sure to season the chicken well (I cook in sesame oil)it has an influence on the overall taste. I also substitute rice vinegar and sesame oil for original ingredients in the recipe and use prepackaged cabbage mix for ease. Thanks!

Such a wonderful salad!  We couldn't wait overnight, so just ate it right away.  I used splenda instead of regular sugar, and as others suggested, rice wine vinegar, and a splash of sesame oil.  Thanks, will make often!

I have been making this for some time and its very good. I don't always add the chicken (if its a side dish I leave it out) and its still good.  Its a no fail recipe.

We really enjoyed this salad.  For convenience, I use a 16oz bag of Fresh Express 3-color slaw.  I also substitute about 1/3 of the vegetable oil with sesame oil for more flavor.  It doesn't even need to stand overnight, just a few hours works well also.

I love this salad and make it regularily, but I make some changes to mine.  First, I grill my chicken with Montreal steak spice for added flavour; I also toast the slivered almonds.  The dressing I make uses 2 Tbsp of oil, 2 Tbsp of sugar and 2 Tbsp of vinegar.  This salad is also very good without the chicken - the chicken just makes it more of a main course.  The only other comment I'd like to make is that this salad in absolutely no way feeds 10 people (with or without chicken), so keep that in mind if you plan to make this for a crowd.

Used this to use up a bunch of cabbage from my csa. Took it to a potluck...I wasn't that crazy about it, but it got eaten, so someone liked it. I added a couple of carrots to the cabbage.

This is so great. I bring it to BBQ's and I will admit not too many try it, even when I say it's amazing. I usually bring a ton home which is great for me. I personally use less oil and think I used at least some sesame oil in place of some veg and it made an awesome difference. I added dried cranberries which made a great flavor addition.

Delicious! Have made as written and with changes. This is a nice switch from mayo based salads. I  have subbed about 2 TB sesame for part of the oil and used rice vinegar as other reviews suggested - this is my preference. Have also used raw sunflower seeds instead of almonds and added shredded carrot and orange/red sweet peppers for a nice splash of color.  Thanks threecats for a good recipe!

I like this recipe a lot and my girlfriends really enjoyed it but I did make a few djustments to it.  I added a coarsely chopped green pepper and about a 1/4 cup of chopped red onion.  I also added about 2-3 T. of soy sauce.  Oh, and I always toast almonds and most other nuts.

I made this as a side to the baked teriyaki chicken from this site. Didn't go over well. The only change I made was that I omited the chicken.

This is a great salad to bring to any get together people just love it! I mixed this recipe with my mom's old staple recipe. Mostly everything is the same, but used 3 tablespoons Apple cider vinegar instead of white. Added extra tablespoons of sesame seeds and almonds and toasted them in the oven at 350 degrees until brown. No green onions for me, but used carrots instead. I agree to leave out the ramen noodles until right before serving since they soften up if left in the refrigerator for too long. I also like to store the dressing separately and put on the salad before serving. Yummy!

I normally don't care for cabbage but I really like this salad. It is good right after it's made and better after it marinates.

changed out the head cabbage for a more colorful tasty cole slaw mix. Then to zing it up a little bit more took 2-3 tablespoons of the Kraft Roasted Red Pepper vinaigrette dressing then sauteed the almond slivers and sesame seeds lightly brown (cool down before adding). Of course I like it spicy so I added some sliced pickled jalapenos to my personal dish.... Awesome recipe though and everyone ate it up at last party so fast will have to make a triple batch for this up coming party!

Awesome salad!  I followed several other user's advice and tried the garlic flavored rice vinegar instead of white vinegar - it was good, but a little too garlicky for me. Also, next time I will put the ramen noodles in a couple hours before because i prefer them crunchy.  It was still really good!  Thanks!!!

I thought this was really good! Hubby didn't care for it, but I knew he wouldn't because it's not his type of thing, lol. I wanted this as a side dish, so I omitted the chicken. I used 1/2 of a bag of slaw mix and eyeballed the almonds (I used sliced). It also didn't specify which flavor of ramen to use, so I went with the obvious and used the oriental flavor. This ended up being the perfect amount of dressing, so IMO, I think if you were to use more cabbage or slaw mix and add the chicken, you would need more dressing. All in all this had great flavor, and I would totally make it for myself again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Very much like chinese chicken salad from the deli counter.  I used little more than half the dressing.  Will definately make again with addition of soy sauce and a touch of sesame oil.

I grew up eating a salad just like this but without the chicken!  Great addition!!!  I still like my  moms dressing though! Try using 4 Tbl. Seasoned rice vinegar and 4 Tbl. sugar!!  It really gives it that extra zing!! I always have to make a double batch because 1 batch wont make it till the next day!!

This is an easy and very tasty salad to throw together.  The chicken is not necessary for the salad.  I made this once for a potluck and another person brought their version of it and mine was gone in an instant, while the other person took home her leftovers.  Thanks for the keeper!

I make this salad all the time.  I like to have leftovers so I use 1 1/2 packages of bagged coleslaw. To the original recipe I add a little red onion and celery, toasted sesame oil, an extra packet of noodles and dressing mix but I don't double the oil or sugar, etc.  Instead..I shake on some bottled teryaki dressing (usually Soy-Vay) which adds another layer of flavor.  My 12 year-old suggested this and thinks it makes it even better.  A great light meal for a hot summer day.

I have had this recipe in my recipe box for two years. I didn't realize that I never reviewed it. It is great! I do the sesame oil instead of sesame seeds. I also marinate the chicken in some kind of asian dressing. I use the bag cole slaw instead of cutting up the cabbage myself. Always a winner at parties and get togethers.

Very good.  My husband and I both liked it.  A nice refreshing salad on a hot day, economical too.  Used chopped peanuts and doubled the noodles and dressing.  My husband needs to drown his salad. Thanks for a great recipe!

I cut the recipe in half & I too used cole slaw mix; I did opt to use cashews instaed of almonds, the ramen soup flavor I used was creamy chicken, I subbed rice vinegar for the distilled (it doesn't have as harsh a vinegar flavor)& I used both the sesame seeds & 1 tbp. of sesame oil...this salad had some great flavors going on!  The chicken I used were  leftovers (Rasberry Vinegar Chicken). I served this w/ sesame crackers, granny smith apple slices & a glass of white zin....very fresh tasting lunch...thanks!

Yummy.  I loved this salad.  I used the preshredded cole slaw mix as recommended, but didn't change anything else.  It was a big hit at our church supper.

Great recipe! The first time I made this, it was gone in no time, and I had to make a second batch.  I use more almonds than this recipe calls for. This is a regular at my house.

Here is what I added. Just needed a little more presentation and flavor: and THIS made the difference! :)
Add to recipe: another 2/3 cup sliced almonds, 3/4 cup raw sunflower seeds, 3/4 cup raisins (or craisins), another 3 to 4 scallions, also add some of the green tops chopped to add color, and 3/4 to 1 apple, (peel on) chopped... 

All can be assembled ahead except apple
I doubled dressing bc it needed it with the additions
I also follow other readers advice and did sesame oil and rice vingar

Lastly I used rotisserie chicken...

love, Love, LOVE this salad!!!  

I use the same ingredients but modified the portions a bit -I use a pkg/bag of the following:  frozen diced chicken, coleslaw mix, broccoli slaw mix, 1 cup of slivered almonds, 2 pkgs of ramen noodles, one bunch of green onions  and then double the sugar, s & p, sesame seeds, oil and vinegar -mix in a big bowl and then put into a gallon freezer bag, put in the fridge overnight and the next day it is wonderful -makes a bunch but is a great hit with everyone!!!  I even put it on a flour tortilla shell and heat it up like a big giant egg roll -LOVE this recipe!!!

This salad was a hit with the entire extended family this weekend. I made it as a side to grilled salmon, with a  few adjustments: omitted chicken, added shredded carrots and a 2nd pkg of ramen, used cashews and toasted sesame oil as suggested, and one extra scallion. Everyone's still talking about it today!

Really healthy and tasty salad. We had to add a lot of lite mayo, though, b/c we had so much cabbage (1/2 head is a lot!). Still great and we will make again!

This is one of my favorite salads - I, too, like to use the tricolor preshredded slaw to make it - for an extra special salad for special occasions (or just whenever!) I like to add some chopped apple and red and green seedles grapes, cut in half - so good! This was very popular at military functions.

I agreed to "help" with a 40th anniversary party for 130. I ended up doing everything but the meat courses. I wanted an easy salad that didn't get mushy and didn't contain mayo since the party was outdoors. I used rice vingegar and added fresh cilantro and red cabbage for color. Like other reviewers I added the noodles about an hour before serving instead of the night before. It was a huge hit.

Yummy!   Loved this!   The changes I made were as following:  Used seseme oil instead of actual seseme seeds (didn't have them).   Toasted almonds and broke up ramen noodles which I added when I  served (don't like them mushy).   Did not use chicken because I used it as a side dish instead of main entree.  Very very good!

I really liked this salad; not too salty or oily like some versions.  I used Napa cabbage and added a dash of sesame oil.  Would also be good with peas.  Keeps well for several days.  I will definitely make this one again!

Love this salad!  A few hints:
Try toasting the almonds for a better flavor.  
Instead of using salt, use the seasoning packet that comes with the Ramen.  
Add chopped cilantro and green onion.
Use a splash of sesame oil for an added "asian" taste.

This salad was amazing! I ommited the chicken but added bean sprouts. Still very tasty. I ate it plain for lunch but it would also be good as a side with terriyaki glazed chicken or something similar. 
I saved some Ramen noodles on the side to add right before we ate, to add some crunch.

This was great! I did make it without the chicken, but only because we were having a steak dinner. It would be perfect with the chicken too though. I also added sesame oil since I did not have the sesame seeds and it did not hurt a think. So good. Thank you.

After reading such great reviews for this recipe I decided to make it for a squadron party. I left out the chicken because I knew several people that would be attending did not eat it. I also used preshredded coleslaw mix and sesame oil. There was no leftovers and I got so many request for the recipe.

Very good! This is a great recipe to "tweak". I added broccoli, green onions, shredded carrot and used a little extra rice wine vinegar because I like lots of vinegar.  Sunflower seeds work well, too.  Lots of crunch is a good thing!

This is not your typical salad.  I tryed something simular at a family event and liked it.  Made this recipe and it was even better.  I did do away with the chicken and used the pre-chopped coleslaw mix instead of the cabbage.  I have to give this 5 stars because it is so different than what you normally have & it tastes great.

This was a side dish, so I left out the chicken.  As instructed I made it the day before, it was  mushier  than expected.  Thus next time I make it, and I will make it again,  but make it the morning of serving. Because I've had this before and the ramen was crunchy, make sure the ramen gets a chance to absorb dressing.

Made as directed, no changes. Very easy and tasted good. I love salads, so I'm keeping this recipe since it can be adjusted to what I have on hand, or spin for a different taste.

I hesitated on making this but did and am so glad I did.  It was a big hit at the dinner table.  And it does make a LOT of salad but we had no problem in eating it all over the course of 3 days.  I will absolutely be making this - and often!

This is easy to throw together, as others have said.  I followed others' suggestions and used the bagged cole slaw mix for ease and also added a bit of sesame oil in with the vegetable oil - a good choice as we like that flavor.  I have to agree with those who complained of a certain 'blah' factor.  After the first serving I added in more vinegar for some tang, but it still needs something else for our tastes.  Because of the simplicity factor it is certainly worth playing around with and tweaking in order to get something with a bigger flavor palate.  As such - it's a good base recipe.

This was very good.  I used the sesame oil (2 TBS) and rice vinegar in place of regular, and a bag of slaw mix with carrots and red cabbage as others recommended.  It was a tangy tasting salad, which was a nice change.  Felt it still needed a little "something" which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  Will experiment to see what could kick it up one more notch!

I make this salad a couple of times a month because it is so well liked!!  I like it best right when it's made instead of waiting overnight.  The different flavors meld together for a very unique taste.  I usually grill the chicken that I'm going to use to give it a little added taste.  It's really great!

Didn't try it personally, but have several positive comments. It was easy and cheap to make with ingredients i had on hand. Will make it for another gathering.

This recipe is fantastic!   My family loves it and it gets rave reviews at every gathering I take it to.

Changes I've made to it:  I toast the almonds and instead of sugar I use Splenda.  I also use Rice Vinegar instead of regular.  It's good with any flavor of Ramen seasoning (I use whichever I have on hand).  

My kids love helping me make this as well.  They love crushing the noodles and mixing it all up.

I added sesame oil and cashews and the packet of spice from the ramen to give it more taste, but it was still too blah for me.

We thought this was a very bland.  I loved the crunch of the almonds and noodles, but it needs to be doctored up a bit.  It does make a lot though.
