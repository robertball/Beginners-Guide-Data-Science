I have a few modifications that makes this a strong lemony frozen yogurt. I use the entire amount of yogurt in the large carton. mine was 4 cups so I increased the agave syrup to taste. I increased the lemon to an entire lemon. I then zested the entire lemon as well for the extra flavor you get from the natural lemon oils. I love mint so I added about 3-4 more leaves and finely chopped them. I didn't want to drag out my ice cream maker so I poured it back into the original yogurt container and tossed it into the freezer. I'll probably stir it every hour or so until it's firm.

Delightful!  The only thing I did differently was use fat free Greek yogurt and it is so rich it still satisfies.  This will be a frequent dessert this summer.  Thanks for posting.

This was delicious. I used fresh pineapple mint and added fresh raspberries upon serving and my whole family loved it asked me to make this again the next night.

OMG what a hit.  I had to make two batches so I froze the first batch then added a layer of lemon curd then the second batch on top.  After a heavy meal this desert was just perfect.  I used my homemade whole milk yogurt.

I also love Greek yogurt but did not enjoy this recipe. The flavours did not blend well and the texture of the yogurt, when frozen, was very icy. I served this to guests who also gave less than favourable reviews. Not a repeat recipe for me.

These flavours are great together. I may consider making it wil regular plain yogurt next time, as the greek yogurt flavour might not be for me. I melted the honey, lemon and mint leaves together before adding to the yogurt. I also added quite a bit of lemon zest. I stuck all this in the ice cream maker, and the result was pretty good!

Very refreshing.  I love Greek yogurt and this was a nice alternate way for serving.  I always use honey but I like the addition of the lemon.  However, I would omit the mint leaves the next time I make it.  The mint leaves just didnâ€™t work for me.     Other than the mint leaves, it was very good.

While quick and easy to make, this was not sweet enough for our tastes.  The bites that contained the honey/mint mixture were good, but they were few and far between.  Most of the bites were plain Greek yogurt- the lemon flavor was hardly noticeable.

The taste was slightly bland but I'm willing to try a few variations next time to make it my own.

made it following the instructions to the letter. overpowering yogurt flavor, with strong mint flavor at random. it may sound tasty, but let me tell you: it was not.

This Is almost the same as my recipe! This makes a nice alternative instead of ice cream! It is Delicious! What I do is before eating it I put it in my blender with some frozen fruit pulse it a few times and it makes it super creamy! I also add a packet of splenda because I love sweets!!! This recipe Is Great!!
