After a trip to Hawaii, I was yearning for more Macadamia nuts, so made this for a Christmas get together. My husband thought it was too chocolate-y, but I thought it was delicious and had two requests for the recipe.

I made this for Thanksgiving.  Upon advice of other reviewers I only used 1 cup chocolate chips and that was more than enough.  Also, the sugar could be reduced to 3/4 of a cup or less.  Similar texture to pecan pie and everyone really liked it.  One person said it tastes like a candy bar.
