This turned out great!! The only changes I made was 1 clove of fresh garlic and some fresh cilantro. This was a hit.

5-22-2016  ~ Difficult to get as chunky as we would have preferred, but tasty nonetheless.  Measurements of ingredients reliably spot on.  Fun to try as an experiment but the old-fashioned "by hand" method will prevail for me so that I have more control.  (Note:  I seeded the tomatoes first to ensure the guacamole would not be runny and I added fresh minced garlic)

I liked the bite to it that the jalapeno pepper gave it.

This recipe is fantastic!  I love it just as is, but if you like to get creative with your guac (add corn, etc.), I think this would be a great guac recipe to use as a base for additions.  It's so easy, very little prep needed, and Vitamix does the rest--perfect!  :)
