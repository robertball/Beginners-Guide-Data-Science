This has always been one of my favorites.  Sometimes I cut the sugar to 3 cups for a slightly tarter flavor.  Also works with brandy if you're out of bourbon.

Bourbon & cranberry converted my mother.  

My mother swears by and only eats canned cranberry.  I used a variation of this recipe and now she makes my version every year.  Actually the whole family has stolen it...

I used 1 package of fresh cranberry, 1-1/4C of sugar and 1/4C (or more) of bourbon.  Since it is usually Thanksgiving, I sprinkle some nutmeg and cinnamon in too.  Super easy to make, the house smells great and even the kids loved it.

Love this recipe. It is SO easy and delish! Like the author suggests, it definitely tastes better if it "ages" for a week or two, but don't expect to have much left at that point. I used 2 cups white sugar and 1 cup dark brown (adds a little richness to the color). It is great on toast, turkey sandwiches, etc. Warning - your whole house will smell like bourbon while this cooks!

Oh my goodness! This is wonderful! I cut the sugar down by a smidgen - maybe by a tablespoon. It is very thick, don't overcook. I'm a big fan of Jack Daniels and used it. It was a huge hit at our Thanksgiving and then on Saturday night for a big Leftovers pot luck! I think the baking in the oven keeps the berries whole. I made it several days before Thanksgiving. We've got a bit left and I'm saving it for Christmas. 
WARNING: If you are not a whiskey fan steer clear.

It's almost Thanksgiving and I am so tired of the canned cranberry sauces, so I thought I'd give it a try a few days ahead of time. I used only one cup of white sugar, maybe a third of a cup brown sugar, a quarter cup bourbon plus a splash more. I cooked it in the oven in a cast iron pot.  Stirred every 15 minutes and at about an hour took it out to check. I love it! It's a definite keeper!

Good flavor, but too runny for me.

I used JB Tennessee Honey for the bourbon and kept everything the same. The flavor is fantastic, but there is a LOT of liquid. I left it in the oven for an extra 10-15 minutes, since the directions say 'until thickened' - but it really did not thicken until it had chilled. 
Like I said, the flavor is great, but there's too much liquid and it is now like a very thick, sticky syrup. It's far too sweet to use as a dinner accompaniment, but I think it would be amazing as a dessert topping!

My family loves it. However I add orange zest and a little orange juice to taste. This has been a hit for 10 years at least. Also easy to make ahead of time.

My son is a distiller and I wanted to use his whiskey in a recipe for Thanksgiving.  This was very easy and so tasty.  I think it will become a regular at our Thanksgiving table.

It was way too sweet for us (family).  But, I loved the flavor, and the ease!  So, I am going to try it with less white sugar and some of suggestions from the other reviews.   Will let you know the changes I make and the results.

I can't help but wonder if I did something wrong because I followed the recipe exactly and I baked it, but it did not come out well at all.  It came out with the texture of almost still being semi raw as opposed to a little chunky and soft.  Are you supposed to pre-cook the cranberries on the stove and THEN bake the cranberry sauce ?   I did manage to salvage it by cooking some regular cranberry sauce on the stove and then mixing it with the other and then it was pretty good.  Can anybody advise me if they had any problems as well ?

I used a bit less sugar, and a touch of cinnamon.... but it was a HIT!!! I have made the basic Ocean Spray recipe in the past, and though good... always had a lot left over.This year,  folks "gobbled"this up and there was barely enough left for the leftovers.  I am making it again for Christmas dinner, by request. Thank you for sharing your mother's recipe!

Tried this recipe last year for a nicer version of cranberries versus opening a can..  Everyone loved it.   I am back again to make sure I had the recipe correct.  This is the new go-to for cranberries !!
