These are delicious and originally found this recipe from Hidden Valley Ranch website years ago.  Everyone ALWAYS ask me to make these for family gatherings!  It might not sound good but you wont be able to stop eating these things! 
I add 1 (2.25oz) can of olives and chop those up and add them to the mix, even olive haters don't notice that olives are in the recipe, but it gives the recipe a little salty punch that it really needs.  
I add a variety of bell peppers (green, red, orange, yellow) to the mix to liven up the color of the appetizer.
I also use almost 1 cup of the ranch dressing so they don't dry out when cooking.
ENJOY!

I made this for a party.  Since everyone in our group likes things spicy, I added some diced jalapeños and some cayenne pepper.  Everyone went crazy over them!  I had a request to make it again for game day the very next day.  I have a friend that is completely dairy-free so I made some using dairy-free ranch dressing and homemade almond cheese.  Even the people that can have dairy loved the dairy-free version.  I had a request to make it again for our next gathering.  One of my friends suggested just combining everything into a small casserole dish and serving it as a dip with tortilla chips. I will try it that way next.  Great recipie!

We made this for the wife’s wine party. Exactly as shown. It was a big hit all the women loved them. Simple and tasty appetizers are hard to find. This one is very good.

Always a big hit at our Christmas party. A couple of different things I do. First, I use Filo shells instead. Secondly, instead of the green onions, I put a small can of chopped black olives. Yum!!

These were great. I hadn't made them in awhile, and looked up the recipe. This one added sauteed peppers and it made them even better than my old version! They are the first to disappear at a party!
