Oh my goodness!! We had this for dinner last night, whith a roaster chicken instead of hens.  This was unbelievable!  I put some minced garlic in the cavity along with the lemons and rosemary.  I put a mixture of 1/4c, butter, 1/2 tsp. minced garlic, juice from 1 quarter of the lemon and some dried crushed rosemary(I mashed this all together) and put in under the breast skin.  It mad the breast meat super flavorful and tender.  I used minced garlic instead of cloves, and it burnt during the roasting part(425) so if you ar doing the minced garlic, you might want to add part of the wine and broth mixture so that it wont burn.  The gravy was delicious, I did however add a little cornstarch to thicken it up.  Served this with Gourmet Sweet Potato Cassarole(on this site), Basic Yankee Bread Stuffing(on this site), Mashed Potatoes, Green beans, Mushrooms and Cranberries.  I also did as someone suggested to put mushrooms into the juices the last 20 minutes of cooking. What a meal!

We loved the hens! I halved the recipe and roasted just 2. I used a roaster pan without the lid and found the time specified in the recipe was just right. Like others suggested, I added chicken broth to the garlic in the pan so the garlic wouldn't burn and that worked well. I also doubled the gravy as others suggested and that was a good idea. Great recipe - it's a keeper!

This is the best cornish game hen recipe I have ever found.  It is absolutley wonderful.  Since there are only two in my house, I made two games hens, but left the wine and broth the same (basically the sauce I kept the same) and it turned out perfectly.  If I used four hens, I would double the sauce because when I boiled the sauce down it was perfect for two hens.  ABSOLUTLEY WONDERFUL.  Thank you for a new favorite, and very moist, game hen recipe...Shannon

Was actually very easy, and tasted great, BUT....I think you need to cook them a bit longer. (It could be my oven) Break the thigh open and check for doneness. Even though my thermometer read 181, it was still very pink down in the thigh area.  Instead of a roasting rack, I cubed sweet potato and put the hens on top of them to roast. Mmmmmmmm! All of the juices from the hens, oil and lemons drizzled down on them and it was Scrumtious!

I searched for a long time for a Cornish Hen recipes since I had never made them before, and did I find a winner! It was so easy, flavorful, and juicy! I did make a few modifications, I used 2 hens since it's just my husband and I, In the cavity of each bird I put a quarter lemon, 2 cloves of garlic and 2 sprigs of fresh rosemary. I read the recipe wrong and actually rubbed 1 tbsp of olive oil on each hen, but still came out good. I then put 1 tbsp butter under the skin on each breast, along with 2 sprigs of the fresh rosemary. I sprinkled some poultry seasoning on each hen along with a lemon slice on the breast and then placed them in my roasting pan on top of cubed yukon gold potatoes. After roasting I took 2/3 c. of cheap pinot grigio, 2/3 c. chicken broth, and about 5 cloves of minced garlic and used that to pour over the hens and baste with. Holy cats was this great! My whole house smelt amazing, and the potatoes were the best I'd ever had! I loved how everything cooked all at once and all I had to do was throw together a salad. My husband raved about this recipe, and picked his hen clean. We loved it so much I'm going to be adapting this recipe to a roasting chicken tonight for dinner. Hope it comes out just as good. Thanks you for sharing a great recipe!

we loved this recipe.  I used a whole 4 lb chicken instead of the cornish hens and it turned out great.  I did not use the lemons as suggested (did't have them) so I stuffed the bird with a whole yellow onion quartered and dried rosemary *again did not have fresh). I also doubled the white wine/chicken stock mixture. my only suggestion would be to put a little chicken stock in the pan with the cloves of galic at the start so the garlic will not burn.

These were tasty!  Very simple too- except I was short on time so I cut down on the garlic and didn't reduce the sauce.  I also used dried rosemary and omitted the wine, just using extra broth and a little bit of apple juice.  These were great for Christmas dinner.

This recipe was pretty good.  I halved the garlic called for and it was more than enough.  I added one clove in the cavity as well.  I used more lemon than called for, it had a wonderful lemon flavor.  The only problem I had was cooking time.  It took  1 1/2 hours to cook before it browned at all.  It was not overcooked though, it was very moist and tender.  This is a good basic recipe, I will probably vary it in the future, and prepare my sides later now that I know to lengthen the cooking time.  Great recipe for someone who has never tried cornish hens before!

Excellent recipe that I have made at least 6 times and always comes out perfect.  Only two additional recommendations to the recipe is place a little softened butter with minced garlic on top of hen between skin and brest and add a little broth to pan before placing in oven to keep garlic from burning.  Add what ever flavors your family prefers to cavity (onion slices, lemon wedges, garlic, etc.).

Great!  I love garlic, so I added more garlic than the recipe calls for.  When making the gravy at the end, I added all the cooked garlic and mashed it in with the sauce.  It gave it a much more garlicky taste.  I didn't cut it in half like suggested, but served it whole, pouring the sauce over the hens as my husband and I ate.  Our only problem was the mess, but otherwise, good recipe.

This was my first time making any kind of whole poultry (I know!) and the recipe couldn't have been easier. I definitely added some stock to the pan right away like other suggested and I'm glad I did - the garlic definitely would have burned. I almost tripled the sauce for two hens and had a little bit of sauce left over. Next time I'll definitely season the inside of the bird before stuffing it with lemon and rosemary.

This was A-mazing! I used more salt & pepper than asked and the skin came out very crisp and tasty. I also added red potatoes and carrots to the pan and put more rosemary in the pan to add flavor to the veggies and drippings. I almost trippled the liquid because I didn't want the garlic and veggies to burn and it was necessary in order to make the sauce. The sauce was just delectable! You don't have to add flour to the sauce if you follow the directions. I used a potato smasher to mash the garlic and continuously stirred the boiling sauce until it thickened. I can't wait to use this on a whole chicken or turkey like others have done.

I had never made cornish hens, but decided to venture out & make them for Valentines Dinner earlier this week. WOW! My husband & I LOVED this recipe! I only made 2 hens, but followed all measurements of the original recipe. I made a few additional tweaks as follows:

1. I brined the hens for 2 hours prior to baking. I soaked them in chicken broth, water, red wine vinegar, white rice vinegar, spoonful of brown sugar, little honey [I just eye-balled all of these ... can't really go wrong!]
2. Sprayed bottom of pan with cooking spray so garlic cloves wouldn't burn
3. Put 4-5 garlic cloves inside of hen cavities [as well as around outside]
4. Brushed melted butter on skin
5. Sprinkled garlic & onion powder on skin
5. Baked 30 minutes at 450 [instead of 25 min] & baked 35 minutes at 350 [instead of 25 min]

These turned out GREAT! I will definitely make again! Highly recommend giving it a try! :)

Have made this for years.  Try cutting slits into the birds and inserting slices of garlic into them.  Slice the lemons thinly and slide under the skin of the breast along with a few of the rosemary leaves.  Will try the sauce next time...

Yet another hit with the family!  This was very flavorful and moist.  It is a bit "lemony and garlicky" as my kids said so those who can't handle the taste, adjust as necessary.  I did like others who rated and put a mix of 1/4 cup butter, fresh rosemary, mashed garlic and a bit of lemon juice under the breast skin.  I came out excellent!!

My husband and I made these flavorful, tender Cornish games hens and they were fabulous!  We only prepared two hens because 1/2 hen is more than enough per person, especially when paired with hearty side dishes, such as green bean casserole and mashed potatoes.  I used minced garlic to enhance the flavor and added butter and herbs under the skin to make the roasted hens extra tasty and attractive. I used the drippings to make a delicious gravy, similar to a country gravy.  To make the gravy, I transferred all of the drippings to a pan on the stove top and simmered them until they were reduced.  I then added 1 tablespoon of flour, mixing constantly to create a roux.  I slowly added 1/3 cup milk & heavy cream and 1/3 cup chicken stock.  The result was a rich, nicely colored gravy, in fact, the best I have ever tasted.  You may need to experiment with the amounts of flour and dairy to create your preferred consistency, just remember to stir quickly and continuously in order to avoid lumps.  This gourmet meal was exceptionally delicious, and much easier to prepare than expected.  The hens pair well with white wine, in particular the sweetness of a Riesling offsets the savory flavors of the food.

These turned out fabulous!  I created a natural truss for the legs by cutting slits in the skin and inserting the legs into them in a criss-crossed fashion.  I covered the pan with foil for the 50 minutes' cooking time, then turned the heat back up to 450 and uncovered the pan to crisp up the skin.  As a result, the birds were moist and juicy.  We served them with roasted garlic baby red mashed potatoes and green beans.  We used the sauce as gravy over the potatoes.  I think next time I will roast whole heads of garlic rather than individual cloves.  I think that way it will get softer and it will be easier to incorporate it into the sauce.  Overall a great recipe!

Tasty, tasty! I would add more lemons however to stuff inside the bird, and would also rub the bird with the lemons if you're looking for more tang.

How delicious! I roasted these hens breast down which allowed the lemon juice and rosemary to be asborbed in the breast. I will definitely use this for chicken.

One of my wife's absolute favorites, and my go-to romantic meal. I will say that I agree with the other reviews that mentioned doubling the sauce, adding a little juice to the pan, and a little seasoning under the skin of the birds. Oh ... and one warning from a disaster I had a few years back ... when adding white wine to a hot glass baking dish, make sure the wine is room temp!  Cold liquid on hot glass = very messy kitchen disaster.

Absolutely delicious!  I have made this dish several times now and each time it comes out great and tastes very good.  Every time I have made this, I have omitted the white wine because I never seem to have any, but it still comes out perfect!  Other than that, I follow the rest of the directions and ingredients exactly as stated.  I usually serve this with some garlic mashed potatoes (sometimes I thicken the gravy from the hen to go with the potatoes) and steamed veggies.

This was a wonderful way to prepare Cornish Hens. I only used two hens, but kept the other ingredients the same. I used minced garlic instead of cloves and just distributed them generously around the hens. Each hen got two lemon wedges and they were yummy. I lightly squeezed them into the cavities first. As others had suggested, I first poured the remainder of the soup broth into the pan to prevent the garlic from burning. Since I added extra broth, I mixed the 1/3 cup of broth with 2/3 cup of wine. More would have been fine, too, since I could not taste the wine flavor. It was still very tasty, though. My daughter and I both loved this recipe. Thank you for submitting it!

I was proud of my hens. Two hens were used and I used the same amount of liquid for the sauce. I stuffed the hens with dried rosemary and fresh garlic. I rubbed the hens with olive oil then sprinkled them with salt, pepper, and Emeril's Essence. I took Ashley_D's advice on cooking the hens: Bake breast side up for 30 minutes at 350, bake breast side down for 30 minutes, and then breast side up for 10 minutes at 400. Thanks Ashley_D!

I HAVE TO SAY BY AND FAR AN ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC RECIPE!!!  THE TASTE IS SENSATIONAL  AND THE POSSIBILITIES FOR A DRESS-UP OR DRESS-DOWN PRESENTATION ARE ENDLESS!  I HAVE MADE THIS FOR ALL OF MY FRIENDS, ASSISTED A FIANCEE'(MALE) IN A VERY ROMANTIC CANDLELITE DINNER AND SHARED THE RECIPE WITH ALMOST MY ENTIRE WORKFORCE! KuDOS! MY SUGGESTION: USE WHATEVER/AS MANY FRESH HERBS AS YOUR BIRD WILL HOLD AND TOP OFF WITH THE LEMON AND SOME GARLIC INSIDE...I ALSO INJECTED THE BIRDS WITH A BUTTER AND CAJUN SPICE MARINADE!

These were fabulous.  In addition to putting lemon and rosemary in the cavity, I added some garlic cloves.  I also added some thinly sliced lemon and butter under the skin of each hen.   Had to cook them longer and at a lower temperature so the hens would cook through first and not burn on the outside.  I started at 350 degrees for 30-40 minutes and then increased the temp to 450 to get the skin crispy.

Excellent - I take chef's pride in the oven stuffers I normally make because they are great.  But this is by far the best tasting ovenstuffer I have ever made.  The medley of flavors was perfect.  I followed the directions per the original recipe with the following modifications:  I lined the bottom of a roasting pan with sliced sweet potatoes (filled across the entire bottom); I used two 6lb oven stuffers; 1/3 cup white cooking wine and 1/3 cup sherry cooking wine; 1 Can chicken broth (1/3 cup poured in at the beginning and 2/3 cup after 30 minutes of cooking).  In each chicken underneath the skin over the breast, I placed 2 tbs margarine mashed up with 1 tsp minced garlic, 1tsp dried rosemary and fresh lemon juice from two of the wedges. Inside the cavity I placed 2 tbs minced garlic and 1/4 of a yellow onion along with 2 lemon wedges and a fresh sprig of rosemary.  I only had about 16 cloves of garlic and that worked fine.    Total Cooking Time was 2 hours (30 Minutes at 450 and 90 minutes at 350)  SIMPLY DELICIOUS.  Will definetly make this again.

I used the seasonings and mixed it with olive oil, then stuffed it under the skin of the birds, as well as inside the cavity.  Used the lemons to squeeze over the top and inside before stuffing them inside.  The sauce wasn't bad at all.  This is an easy dinner and I will probably make it again!

If I was buying a home and my real estate agent took me to a home that had the aroma of this dish, I would buy the home!  The garlic was to die for.

We really enjoyed the melding of the flavors of the recipe; they were just perfect. The only thing I have to fix is that because it is summer, I decided to use our toaster/broiler/rotisserie oven to keep it cooler in the house. I did use a roasting pan. The outside of the hens browned very quickly, so I tented them with foil.  Even after cooking for the required time, the hens were not done on the inside.  This could have been because of my oven, but after reading other reviews, I'm not so sure.  Next time, (yes, yes definitely a next time) I will cook on a lower heat for a longer time after the initial roasting.  5 stars for flavor and 4 stars for having to adjust the times.  :)

So tasty!!  I added fresh sprigs of thyme, too.  This dish came out flavorful and savory.  I had to add a solution of corn starch and water to the sauce in order for it to thicken on the stovetop.

I can't believe that this was sooo good.  I followed the instruction to the "T". I did double up on the gravy, though.  I also think that the burned garlic was the best part, as did my wife & pit bull.  I had steamed broccoli and baked potatoes.  It was superb.  Please try this recipe, you wont regret it!

I didn't follow this recipe to the letter, but borrowed some of the basic ideas.  I seasoned the inside of the hens with kosher salt and fresh cracked pepper and then stuffed them with the lemon and rosemary and added two cloves of garlic as well.  For the outside, I melted a cube of salted butter (I made eight hens, you could probably use less,) and added fresh chopped rosemary, sage and thyme with one clove of crushed garlic.  I brushed this mixture under the skin making sure to get a lot of the herbs there to flavor the meat, and then outside of the skin as well.  I baked them for approx 90 minutes and VOILA!  My guests raved!  I served the hens with wild rice with oyster mushrooms and pine nuts, and pan roasted asparagus and homemade peasant bread.  It was a lovely meal, and my guests are still talking about it :)

I just served this Sunday to my family and guests and it was a hit. My mother and friend are great natural cooks and I am not but can read and follow directions. They both said it was great, best Cornish hen they ever had and coming from them, I felt proud. I took advice from several other reviewers and rubbed minced garlic under skin plus cooked it 30 mins longer than recipe stated. Will definitely be making this again and again. Thanks for sharing..

Man! Was this good!!! Loved it!!! I only baked two but used the same amount of liquid! I also threw in a clove of garlic inside the cavity of the hen. I added some chicken stock to the bottom of the pan so the garlic didn't burn! I might have cooked it an extra 10 minutes because it didn't reach 180 at the suggested time!! The result was delicious, worthwhile hen that I would make again!

After 40 years, I finally found a cornish hen recipe I'll keep! I followed suggestions and made a paste of EVOO, butter, garlic, lemon and rosemary in the am, then put under the skin just before baking. I put garlic with lemon and rosemary in the cavity and poured broth and wine in the pan to keep the garlic from burning and also to have the broth pick up the garlic flavor. I crushed the garlic in the sauce to put over the hens and also to spread on a baguette. My only regret is that I made only 2 and have no leftovers.15 other allrecipe.com entries are now trashed!

Superb, Sublime. And Easy. Its the right amount of garlic: the whole and plentiful cloves roast up, then infuse the start of the sauce, which then becomes the gravy. I followed another user's advice by using a little corn starch to thicken. It made a light garlicky flavored gravy (still blending nicely with the other ingredients) that covered, for me, plain mash potatoes, so no need for garlic mash. Used 2 lemon wedges and rosemary sprigs, and squeezed a bit of lemon on the inside, wasn't too much. Love this recipe. I don't think its "basic" at all. It's simple but sophisticated. Cooking time perfect, moist, perfect doneness, no problem browning: that one reviewer needs his thermostat fixed. Thanks! My partner and I loved it.

Hen was tender but didn't have a lot of flavor even with all that garlic. I think I prefer seasoning under the skin and that's what I'll do next time.

I found in the past that a whole game hen was to much to eat so cut hens in half (only using 2 hens for 4 people). I layed them on a bed of rosemary and lemons, adding all 24 garlic cloves,broth, wine and olive oil. When making the gravy I took the rosemary & lemons out of juices, cooked down and served. Wonderful !!! Finger licking good.

Made this tonight for christmas eve, first time making dinner for the family. I honestly don't think I've ever had cornish hens before, but it was a HIT with my family. My brother-in-law who said he had always hated them in the past really enjoyed this. 

I did make some changes. Since there were 6 adults and a toddler I made 9 hens, exactly what would fit in my king size roasting pan. First I melted some butter and minced some of the garlic, mixing it together. Each hen got a spoonful of that inside, then I squeezed a lemon slice (I quartered my lemons)inside the cavity and put that in, then my rosemary, I used several sprigs in each one, then another lemon wedge. Then I put some garlic and butter under the skin along with a couple thin slices of lemon. I added broth to the pan as well, I'm not sure how much since I eyeballed it but probably about 1/4-1/2 an inch deep in the pan (a lot haha). 

Since I had SO much garlic and the pan was crammed full I just threw a handful of cloves underneath each chicken and the garlic just floated around. I also doubled the wine and broth sauce I added at 350 degress.

I read some people complain about it taking a lot longer and since I figured I had so much more I did 30 minutes at 450 degrees and then when it was down to 350 I was checking the temp every 10 minutes as I basted it. Honestly it was done within another 20 minutes, and I could of followed the recommended time and they would of been perfect. 

I am high altitude BTW.

KEEPER!  I have always struggled with a way to make Cornish hens both flavorful and tender.  But since I like the idea of serving them for special occasions, I have kept at it.  Finally, I can stop the search!  Simply wonderful recipe, easy to do with fabulous results.  As so many others, I did my own adaption: I like mild garlic flavor, so for two hens, I only used one head of garlic, about 8 cloves.  That was perfect for us.  I also omitted the rosemary and added a quarter of an orange to the cavity, with one big slice of lemon.  It ended up giving a lovely orange/citrus flavor to the sauce.  Next time, I might add a bit of orange juice to the sauce as well.  Baking time was spot on (I agree with others recommending an oven thermometer) and the birds were a lovely brown-golden color.  Moist and tasty.  Thank you for such a great recipe!

I searched for a long time for a Cornish Hen recipes since I had never made them before, and did I find a winner! It was so easy, flavorful, and juicy! I did make a few modifications, I used 2 hens since it's just my husband and I, In the cavity of each bird I put a quarter lemon, 2 cloves of garlic and 2 sprigs of fresh rosemary. I read the recipe wrong and actually rubbed 1 tbsp of olive oil on each hen, but still came out good. I then put 1 tbsp butter under the skin on each breast, along with 2 sprigs of the fresh rosemary. I sprinkled some poultry seasoning on each hen along with a lemon slice on the breast and then placed them in my roasting pan on top of cubed yukon gold potatoes. After roasting I took 2/3 c. of cheap pinot grigio, 2/3 c. chicken broth, and about 5 cloves of minced garlic and used that to pour over the hens and baste with. Holy cats was this great! My whole house smelt amazing, and the potatoes were the best I'd ever had!

Have made this several times, the only thing I do different is I sprinkle crushed garlic around the birds. I buy crushed garlic in a large bottle because I use it so much. It goes well with a wild rice.

This was a pretty easy recipe and was soooo delicious.  Everyone loved it.  Next time I make it, I'll double the sauce because it had awesome flavor.  It did take quite a bit longer than the recipe states to get the juices to run clear though.  It was over an hour vs the 25 minutes listed.
I took an idea from another rater and placed the hens on top of peeled, sliced potatoes while roasting and threw in some sliced mushrooms for the last 30 minutes.  That became our vegetables for the meal.
Thanks for the great recipe!

This was fantastic! I made it for my parents on Christmas Day and they loved it. I doubled up on the sauce, but it didn't thicken quite as much as I would have liked even after I added cornstarch. Next time I will boil it for longer. I served this with Suzy's Mashed Red Potatoes and reduced fat (Giant Eagle brand) crescent rolls. Will definitely make again!

Was really moist and the skin was flavored nicely however I'll take everyone's advice (which I didn't see until now) and put garlic, lemon, and rosemary under the skin. I think then it will be perfect! I aslo cooked for much longer.. almost 40 minutes longer.

I tried making this twice, and both times the PARTS THAT WERE COOKED were fine... but neither time was it cooked all the way through, and I had to put half of the hens back in the oven for another half hour (after already adding an extra 10 minutes to the second cooking time).  Presentation was great, but having raw bits of hen definitely put a damper on my Thanksgiving.

These are SO moist and delicious.  I rubbed minced garlic, rosemary under the skin of the hen and then every time I basted the birds, I pushed the broth mixture under the skin.  Before serving I removed all the skin to save calories and it was delicious. The only downside to this dish is the difficulty in cutting the hens after they are cooked (and very hot), which I found to be cumbersome and did not produce the prettiest presentation. Luckily the flavor made up for it! I made this with the Roasted Vegetable recipe from this site...a yummy dinner!

I made it for a sweet Texan man who has made me a couple of delicious steak meals.  I was dying to show off my chops.  Apparently I did well because he was picking chicken off the bone, and then he moved on to my plate.  I pretty much followed the recipe, except I dry brined the hens for 20-24 hours before roasting.  I always dry brine chicken and steak if I'm grilling or roasting and have time.  I firmly believe this is why my chicken is always juicy and moist.  After his first bite, he instantly commented that the chicken was so moist.   All dry brining involves is salting the meat and placing in the refrigerator for 24 hours.  This helps give it a crispy skin and juicy meat.  I also deglazed the pan with creme and white wine, then reduced for a sauce over my cauliflower-mash.  The chicken didn't need any sauce.  So yummy!

I made this as a 'pre-Thanksgiving' meal when I learned our Thanksgiving hosts would not be serving the traditional turkey dinner. I listened to the other reviews and added chicken broth to the roasting pan to ensure that the garlic didn't burn.  I served the hens with purple fingerling potatoes, asparagus, and a spinach/bacon salad.  The meal was a hit and everyone enjoyed the hens.  For purchasing reference- the males each ate a whole hen, and the females ate a 1/2 hen a piece.

These were good, however next time I will add lemon juice to the broth mixture that gets poured over the top. The meat that absorbed the lemon flavor from the lemon INSIDE the bird ended up being the best, the other meat could have used a more tart punch. Thats my two cents. :)

I've made this twice and my husband loves it. I marinated the hens with olive oil, salt and pepper as the recipe says, but I added dry herbs and then put the hens in the fridge for a few hours before sending them into the oven.

I enjoyed this recipe. The cook time was a bit longer than the recipe stated, which wasn't a bother really because I always leave time for projects like this anyway. This was the first time I'd prepared Cornish Game Hens. The scent during cooking was very nice! I loved the garlic cloves that turned out afterward, those were an extra treat. My husband gave me a big thumbs up. We'll have this again.

Instead of roasting, I cooked this in the crock pot, which made it sooo moist.  Flavor is mild but good.

This recipe was mediocre at best, and just wasn't terribly impressive. It had a strong flavor of something rather bitter, and I followed the recipe exactly, so I have no idea what that taste was.

WOW, great recipe!!!! Subtract 100 degrees and add 30 mins cooking time. Add another quarter lemon, basil, small ginger root, and stuff as many garlic as you can. Inject with cajun marinade. AWESOME! I used 2 hens.

This recipe was easy and delicious. I read a lot of reviews before making it and made the following changes: I added 1 cup of wine, 1 cup of chicken broth and 4 tablespoons of olive oil at the beginning of cooking so the garlic would not burn and there would be enough juice for gravy. I cooked this uncovered and it seemed to work well. The outer skin was crisp but not too crisp. I followed all other directions and strongly suggest making this recipe. My dinner guests loved this dish!

The hen turned out yummy, though a bit dry. I recommend using 350 degree heat for the full hour instead of baking at 450 for the first 25 minutes. Also, try using an orange wedge in place of lemon.

My husband and I loved this!  I didn't have a lemon so used a lime instead and it worked wonderfully. I followed other suggestions and put a little chicken stock in the bottom of the pan at the beginning with the garlic and doubled the ingredients for making the sauce.  I will definitely make this again.

The hens came out very good. I followed the recipe. The only thing I did as addition was, I added butter and minced garlic under the skin and added chicken broth to the roaster to prevent the garlic from burning.

This recipe is incredible.  I ate my hen with my hands, hot from the oven, juices running down my fingers like I was in Game of Thrones.  I substituted sage for rosemary (I don't really care for rosemary) and threw in some chopped onions and chopped mushrooms.  Skipped the white wine 'cause I didn't have any, and basted with some bone broth I'd made previously.  Delicious.  A meal fit for a Lannister.  Or a Manderly.

I used thyme instead of rosemary - personal preference. Also used minced garlic instead of whole cloves. Only did two hens but the only thing I cut down on was the oil - otherwise it worked out fine. I had to cook the hens about 75 minutes, and they were still just barely done (thermometer read 165). I boiled the sauce 10 minutes before I just added cornstarch to speed things up. Flavor was magnificent, though - would absolutely serve for company next time!

This was a hit with my family...moist and delicious.  I modified the recipe slightly.  I put the broth and vinegar in the roasting pan from the beginning.  The birds actually sat in it like a marinade, in the fridge, for a few hours before cooking. I also added a clove of garlic in the cavity along with the lemon and rosemary.  I cooked it for an hour and a half based on other reviews.  It was excellent!

Made for Christmas dinner...found the Hens juicy, but a little bland like Chicken.  Pureed the garlic and pan juices in a food processer for a great side sauce...

Hmmm - we were not too impressed.  Disappointed considering the high ratings! I found the meat just ok - not super flavorful and I did add the garlic/lemon/rosemary butter under the skin.  Otherwise followed the instructions exactly and even added 15 minutes extra cooking time and I was still worried the meat was a little underdone.

Love this recipe.  I don't use the rosemary though, not my favorite.  I use garlic instead.  I also mix butter, garlic, salt, pepper, and a little lemon juice and stuff under the skin on both the upper and under sides of the hen.  Delicious, thanks for sharing!

Great recipe!  I had never made cornish hens before and wanted to give them a try.  This was the perfect recipe to start with.  Very simple to put together and bake.  I did use all chicken broth instead of wine because I didn't have any.  Loved the flavors and the chicken turned out so moist!

Yummy! I did 2 hens but used the 4 hen sauce recipe. At the end of the cooking time I poured off the liquid into a sauce pan and returned the hens to the 350° oven (to brown a little more) while I reduced the sauce. Did I mention "yummy"?

I only cooked 2 hens verses the 4 and I still have left overs. I kept the liquids the same as I am a sauce lover plus I wanted enough to coat the hens while they were cooking. I had left over celery. Maui onion (sweet onion) and carrots from the holidays so I added in half a stalk of celery chopped very fine along with roughly 1/4 cup fine chopped maui onion to each hen inside along with the lemon and the rosemary. I also crushed up 3 galric cloves to each hen and placed inside as well then closed them up with a tooth pick. I placed carrots around the hens along with the galric cloves that was suggested. I did have to cook a little do to my addings but only another 10 minutes at the 350 temperature. After I took out from oven I squeezed all the lemon juice fromt eh lemons over the hens. Nice touch of flavor. I cooked herb rice to go along with dish and I have to say it was very yummy, delicous to the mouth and the smell is still wafting in my house today. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

This was OK.  The chicken was a bit bland and could certainly use more flavor on the skin (and a rub under.  Certainly moist.  The best part (and it was GOOD) was the sauce rendered from the basting juices- garlicly deliciousness.  I would make again

The whole family liked this recipe.   I did not read the reviews first and I burned half of the garlic cloves during the first 25 minutes of roasting.  Next time I will add some broth to the bottom of the pan with the cloves so they do not burn.  I also found that it took about 20 minutes longer to cook than the recipe called for.   When I made the gravy I added some corn starch to cold chicken broth and mixed it into the leftover pan juices.  I also added some mushrooms to the gravy.  Despite my burned garlic this recipe is a keeper.  It is super easy, yummy and the kids ate it up!

This is fabulous!  I made it again last weekend.  For whatever reason, I don't get a lot of drippings and so I've been a little bit short on sauce; I doubled up the chicken stock and the wine and then poured that over cooked wild rice that I prepared with chicken stock.  Yum.

Phenomenal!  Used a small roaster chicken, instead of the game hens.  This was as good as the Butter Roast Chicken on this site, with less guilt!  I used laura.bora's suggestion of making the butter / lemon juice / rosemary / garlic mix and putting it under the skin.    Stuffed the cavity with a quartered onion, sprinkled with dried rosemary.  (Didn't have a real lemon).  Doubled the broth and wine, and added a touch of cayenne and a splash of lemon juice.  Skipped step four and just carved the chicken, dipping the pieces into the pan juices.  The five year olds devoured this in record time, forgetting all about their "kid wine" that usually cites precedence over anything!

We were very impressed with how this turned out! Delicious, flavorful, and juicy meat. The sauce was AMAZING! I halved the recipe, using only 2 hens. I kept the sauce amounts the same though, but I did only use 7 cloves of garlic. That was just the right amount for us and I will do the same next time I make this. Mine took longer to cook that stated, but that could have been the size of my hens or my oven. They took about an hour and fifteen minutes to cook through. Absolutely delicious; my fiance could not stop raving. Thank you!

I make cornish game hens and usually follow the cooking directions on the wraper and they cook great!  The cooking time was off for me (it was not fully cooked) so I had to cook them 20 minutes longer.  This was reported by several people who reviewed it.  The lemon give it a weird taste, the sauce tasted funny and the meat as well and it took me a minute to realize it's the lemon when cooked with the rinds it dose not really taste like lemon.  I sugest finding a different recipe.

I have made this several times and it was fantastic.  I made some minor adjustments: I used 1 hen since I only cook for 2 people, but kept the liquid measurements the same. I used fresh thyme in place of the rosemary, and substituted 1 Tbsp of minced garlic for the whole cloves. I put 1/4 of a lemon into the bird, along with 4 sprigs of thyme and garlic. I added some more thyme (stems removed) to the pan liquids.  I also roasted some red potatoes and carrots in the same pan. I cooked for 60 minutes, then drained the drippings into a saucepan, whisked in a roux, and simmered for a few minutes. This made an AMAZING gravy for both the hen and potatoes/carrots.  I'm adding this to my regular rotation, it was THAT good!

I just made this recipe this evening, and after reading the reviews I decided to make the following small modifications. I'm a big flavor person, so I seasoned the outside of the hens with kosher salt and fresh black pepper, as well as a dash of cayenne, dried rosemary and basil. I also spooned a couple of teaspoons of pre-crushed garlic on the breast of the chicken. When stuffing the birds, I put 3 cloves of garlic in with the lemon wedges and rosemary. I cooked according to the same time and heat as the recipe described, and when making the sauce I doubled the liquid so as to make sure I had enough for gravy and to spoon over the birds during the second cooking process. I'm extremely pleased with the result, it was lemony (without being overpowering) and the rosemary and pepper flavors were bright and aromatic. Utter smash hit. I used Wondra flour when whipping up the gravy over VERY high heat, thickened in no time and is quite possibly the best brown gravy I've ever made. Served with steamed asparagus (which really went with the gravy) and home-made crusty macaroni and cheese. Delightful!

This is the best recipe for Cornish Hen's I have tried.  I only made a few changes. When putting the rosemary and lemon in the cavity I added minced garlic.  Also when I rubbed the chicken with olive oil I mixed in softened butter.  I added a small amount of chicken broth like others suggested and my garlic didn't burn.  Me and my boyfriend loved it!!!

I tried this after my boyfriend came home with two Cornish game hens and expected me to do something with them. I did a search and came up with this recipe.  We both ended up loving this dish.  I did make some modifications after reading the other reviews:  I'm a flavor junkie, so I mixed up 1 tps. each of Emeril's Chicken Rub, dried Rosemary, and Italian garlic seasoning with the 3 tbs. of oil called for.  I made inicisions under the skin of the hens and spooned a couple teaspoons of this mixture under the skin and a couple over the skin.  I then seasoned the outside of the birds and the cavities with Kosher salt and plenty of black pepper.  I only used two hens, but used one whole lemon, squeezing the juice of the lemon all over the birds and over the garlic cloves in the pan, and then stuffing the birds as directed (the birds will only fit a quarter of one lemon in the cavity).  I also didn't have enough fresh garlic on hand, so I used a jar of pearl onions to supplement the garlic and dumped the onion juice from the jar into the roasting pan.  This kept everything juicy until phase two.  I didn't have white wine, so I used a red Zinfandel, some water, and I added baby Bella mushrooms cut into quarters to the pan for the second half of roasting.  I added extra garlic seasoning and Emeril's Chicken rub to the mushrooms.  It was awesome.  The other adjustment I made was the cooking time - if you have a "cool" oven like I do, just crank up the temp 10 degrees and cook 5 to 10

These were pretty good.  It definitely needed to cook 15-20 more minutes.  The lemon came through somewhat strong so next time I think I'll either add more rosemary or an orange slice.

This is the first time in my life that I've made Cornish hens, and they were awesome!  I thought the lemon and rosemary flavors were divine together.  I didn't taste the garlic very much though.  Maybe next time I'll throw a few cloves in each hen?  Don't know, but it was delicious either way!

I roasted the hens for extra 10-15 minutes because of the other reviews, but it probably would've been ok without the extra time. Meat was tender, and full of flavor, both me and my wife loved it! I doubled the lemon per hen, and I added salt and pepper on the inside, too... I followed the rest of it exactly.

Very simple, tastes wonderful.  I rubbed the inside of the hens with chopped garlic so that the flavor would absorb better into the meat, then stuffed with the lemon and rosemary.  The garlic on the outside of the hens needs to be whole cloves so that it does not burn. Also, I increased the amounts of white wine and broth to 1 cup each, so that I could be liberal with using it on the sides that accompany the meal. I added some chopped parsley to the sauce at the end to finish, and served with Parmesan mashed potatoes (with the reduced sauce on top)...delicious!

This was great. I stuffed the cavities with bits of lemon, onion and garlic in addition to the rosemary.  The sauce was fantastic.  I did cook them for an additional 30 minutes and broiled them on high for about 5 minutes to get the skin extra crispy.  Very good.

Really nice recipe!  Great flavor...put a bunch of minced garlic in the cavity along with lemons, onion, and rosemary.  Perfect timing, 425 for 25 min. then another 25 at 350.  I let sit for 10 min out of the oven- delicious!  Served with sweet potatoes and rice.

Pretty easy and very good! I bought cornish game hens because they were on sale, I never made them before. Thanks to this recipe they turned out great! I followed it almost exactly. I only made 2 birds, but I kept the amounts the same for the suace ingredients, as other reviewers had suggested to double the sauce - they were right! The birds came out moist and succulent and tasty, and although it took a long time to cook it was quite easy. The addition of roasted potatoes and garlic bread made a very satisfying meal. This one is going in the recipe box!

The recipe was very easy to follow, and the end result was delicous! We chunked up some red skinned potatoes and tossed them in olive oil, some of the fresh rosemary, and the juice from the other half of the lemon. Then we we fried them in a pan and added some chicken broth. It was an excellent side dish for the hens.

This was great even though I boo-booed and put the birds on the rack upside down (they should be breast side up). Before cooking, I mixed up a paste of butter, garlic and rosemary and inserted it under the skin, this really gets the flavor in. I also used dried rosemary b/c I couldn't find any fresh, which was OK but I'll wait for fresh next time. My husband loved it. one other thing though, some reviewers added all the sauce at the beginning, so I did, but it evaporated and burnt way too quickly, i had to keep deglazing it with wine, which was annoying, but it still tasted great.

My wife and I loved the recipe.  As a side we had chedder and broccolli rice (lipton)...was very good.  We only made 2 hens and made the following amendments to the recipe.  We didnt have flour though, so we dont know how much to add...but it definitely would have made the sauce even better (probably 5 stars)!
Recipe amendment: Double ALL ingredients for 4 hens. Additional 1/3 cup wine and 1/3 cup chicken broth
Step 2 Amendments: Add 1/3 cup chicken broth and 1/3 cup wine to pan.  Cook at 350 degrees (when making 2 hens).

Step 3 AmendmentsBaste every 10 minutes.  When/if sauce gets low - add another 1/3 cup whine and 1/3 cup chicken broth.

Step 4: Add flour/corn starch to thicken sauce.

This recipe is OK.  I didn't like the way only the meat near the cavity tasted like lemon and rosemary.  The cooking time is off too.  By the time the hens were cooked through the breast meat was dry. You may want to cook these longer at a lower temperature to get a more tender result.

I adapted this recipe for an oven roaster with great success. Have substituted sherry for white wine and different combinations of herbs such as apple with sage or the lemon with parsley. Everyone loves the gravy that this makes!

This recipe is wonderful!  I prepared two hens but kept all the other ingredients the same.  I also stuffed a few garlic cloves underneath the skin.  I mashed the garlic cloves to make the sauce, but I thickened it with cold water/flour to make a gravy.  I will make this again very soon!

Excellent, this was really easy to make and very tasty.  My husband and I had this for our Christmas dinner and ended up having leftovers for lunch which tasted just as great (we just made 2 chickens).  I however used the same amount of wine and chicken stock for 4 chickens. and to make the gravy, I added more stock after I had removed the chickens, there wasn't enough liquid to boil down.  Excellent, wil make it again.

GEEEEEEZZZZZZZZZZZ, this was ridiculously good! Only things I did differently were add a little more season to the outside of the chicken before cooking it, quartered a small onion and put the pieces in the cavity of each chicken. The sauce is so flavorful but if you do prefer your sauces a little thicker, whisk in some flour when you're transferring the juices. I usually do this in a big measuring cup/glass before putting it into a saucepan. Makes it easier to mix it all together so you don't end up with little flour chunks floating around. Look forward to making this again.

All I can say is WOW! 5 stars for sure...I omitted the Rosemary because I don't really like, seasoned with Cajun blackened seasoning, put in lemon,  used two hens and left the amount of sauce the same. I don't have a roasting pan so I used a roasting bag and put in baking dish. I used minced garlic and it didn't burn because of the bag. I served over stuffing and had roasted potatoes, corn, and green beans. 3lbs of chicken and it was all gone, my friends ate every bit of it! The sauce makes this dish, I will make this over and over again!

I did have to bake this for about 10 minutes longer than the recipe called for. I also substituted tarragon for the rosemary and added lemon and mushrooms to the gravy at the end. Overall, a really good recipe.

I made these for the first time last week for my wife and I. Since I had used a similar recipie for my whole chickens, I felt very at home with this recipie. I adapted what I know, and what I used do with chicken, and it came out WONDERFUL. 

Basically the only thing I changed was I added 1/4 table spoon to the basting sauce, and 1/4 table spoon Butter to the cavity. Then I added a little red onion to the sauce as I cooked it at the end. 
6 Stars!

We cooked these on our Primo grill, in a foil pan,rather than in the oven.  And the combination of flavors...blew me away!!  Sauce was excellent.  I did add a little butter to it at the end to finish it.  Served over couscous, and had sauted zucchini with peppers and onions.  Delish!!  The only thing I changed from the recipe was I used fresh thyme, as I didn't have Rosemary on hand.  And I just did 3 hens, as that was all I had.  Husband was very impressed too!!  Can't wait to serve it to company next time!!

I only made two hens, but kept the spices, broth, and wine the same.  I would definitely do that again and have double the liquid than called for.  I used minced garlic instead of cloves and put some of it inside the hens and rubbed the rest on the outside of the hens.  The cooking time and temperature were perfect.

Wow.  Just wow.  This was amazing.  I had picked up Cornish game hens on sale and had no idea what to do with them.  I can't imagine a better way to cook them.  They were crispy skinned and very juicy and tender.  The pan drippings made one amazing gravy and the roasted garlic was so good both on its own and mashed into the gravy.  I used a semi-dry Riesling and roasted garlic chicken broth.  I used only two hens but kept everything else the same (more gravy this way) except for using dry rosemary instead of fresh since that is what I had on hand.  Served with garlic mashed potatoes and salad.  This was an easy and very tasty dinner.

These were yummy and pretty easy! This was my first time cooking Cornish hens. I didn't have a roasting pan, so I used my cast iron dutch oven. Had to cook them for quite a bit longer than stated, but followed other instructions. My husband and I both enjoyed this for Christmas dinner.

Delicious and well written instructions! Like others mention here definitely double the amount of sauce (at least). At step 4, making the sauce, I added 1-2 TBS flour to make a gravy and chopped up the garlic into it - delicious gravy!! My husband and I enjoyed these hens with some stuffing on the side for Christmas dinner and were extremely glad we did!

Read instructions on cook time on bird package.  Very tasty!  White wine is a must.  Add a little flour to sauce to thicken.  Put cloves in cavities.  Squeeze lemons under skin and add butter.

This is amazing, and quite simple..The only change I made was to use roasted garlic infused olive oil.  Every time I serve it, wonderful comments.  It goes great with roasted root veggies with rosemary and thyme.

I gave this a 5/5 because it was so amazing and juicy and delicious. I've never made game hen and I will definitely continue to do so.I only made one,because I only have myself to cook for. I suggest pureeing the leftover juice and garlic cloves with a little more chicken broth then bringing it to a simmer for a nice gravy for mashed potatoes! I didn't want to leave my kitchen it was so good! Thanks for a cheap college student friendly healthy meal!

This recipe looked so good that I had to try it.  Being Easter Sunday, and the stores closed, I improvised.  Dried rosemary, dried granulated garlic (can't believe I ran out of fresh), brushed the hens with butter instead of olive oil. Made gravy thickened with cornstarch -- no additional chicken broth, I used water, and drank the wine!! Delicious and oh, soooooo easy.

This recipe is fantastic!  I served it with an herbed rice and asparagus, and nearly every taste bud in my mouth was satisfied.  I finished the meal with a molten chocolate cake and decided I'd just eaten the perfect meal.  My husband agreed wholeheartedly.

Excellent...the only change I made was I used one sprig of fresh thyme instead of rosemary, mainly because I only had thyme..would make this again. My husband who likes garlic, but only a few cloves enjoyed this as the garlic seemed light and not strong.  Definitely would make this again....

This is a very flavorful recipe and very moist as well. I put everything under the skin and in the cavity as well. Very very good. Loved it. Also made a gravy with the drippings that was fantastic as well.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it turned out wonderfully. I am not a good cook by any means, and this was easy enough for me to master. I followed the other reviews and put a clove of garlic in the cavities and also put some chicken broth in the bottom of the pan to keep the garlic from burning. I used only 2 hens instead of 4 but kept the rest of the recipe the same and didn't reduce ingredients.

I made this for Thanksgivings..Came out really good.  But!!!  1.The timing to roast a hen is longer. 2.I had to make some sauce on the side....but the hen was moist. 3. I didn't use all 24 Garlic Cloves 4. I seasoned the hen really well so It had allot of flavor.  My 2 yr old named it after him...lol we loved it

Very simple and very delicious.  I stuffed each hen with the Awesome Cranberry Sausage Stuffing recipe and cooked two 22oz hens for 35 minutes.

This was fantastic. I used another reviewer's idea to rub the butter/garlic/lemon juice/crushed rosemary mixture under the skin, and added minced garlic to the cavity. And then instead of wine, I used sparkling grape juice. And also thickened the sauce with Wondra flour. The hens were moist and juicy, and so flavorful. I served with green bean casserole and a piece of garlic bread.

I ended up using whole chickens instead of Cornish game hens because I had so many people coming over, but I adjusted the recipe to the pounds of chicken. EVERYONE loved this chicken. It came out incredibly moist because I used a meat thermometer, but it also had incredible flavor. Thank you so much for this delicious recipe! Its a keeper!

I was anxious to try this recipe b/c of all the good reviews.  I tried the altered version where one uses 2/3 cup of both broth and wine.  It didn't turn out as I hoped.  I don't know if it was b/c my Cornish game hens were still partially frozen (after a few days thawing in the fridge) which created extra liquid or the extra broth I used at the beginning of cooking time so the garlic didn't burn.  The Cornish hen just tasted like a normal plain chicken...the sauce you could taste nothing of unfortunately:(  Plus the hen took much longer to cook b/c the inner thighs were still red even though the top and sides of it were all browned and looked nice.  Next time I'll try not to get a frozen one and not use as much liquid for the sauce.  Overall...so so.  Maybe next time I'll use minced garlic or more of the cloves or something.

My Oh My, this recipe was delish!  I have to say these cornish hens were so flavorful!  And the sauce....YUMMM!  I only made two cornish hens but made the full amount of sauce.  I didnt have fresh rosemary so I just used dried and sprinkled it all over the hens plus inside.  Stuffed it as it says but also put the garlic cloves inside also instead of around the hens.  I seared them a little before putting in the oven.  After pulling them out to rest, I started to simmer the sauce/drippings.  When it reduced down into a sauce, I wanted more since I was going to be serving over mashed potatoes, so I added in some sour cream to make a gravy.  WOWEE that was the best gravy I ever tasted!  It was sooo full of flavor!  Absolutely excellent.  Next time I will remember to double the sauce, so that I can have extra gravy to smother the chicken and some mashed potatoes with.  Thanks for the recipe, its a keeper!

This was very good and easy to make - I have to say though - the garlic was there in aroma but not in flavor - I would add some garlic salt or crushed garlic to the outside of the birds next time. Same with rosemary - maybe rub a couple springs on the bird.

These were better than expected.  Sprinked dried rosemary (about 1 tsp) inside each hen along with 1 elephant garlic clove and the leafy tops off of stocks of celery.  The lemon gave the most flavor but the combined flavors made it really good.  Was expecting the breast meat to be a little dry with it baked like this but it wasn't.

It was indeed very moist.  Next time though I'll put more lemon in the cavity. Since I doubled the liquids, there was more than enough for gravy.  I was surprised that the garlic didn't render it too garlicky (I've used like 30 cloves). I reduced the liquid and added 8 ounces of whole mushrooms.  Salt & pepper to taste and thicken it a bit with cornstarch at the end of cooking.  It's great over mashed potatoes!

I made this recipe tonight, and followed other reviewers' suggestions of adding a little chicken broth during the first roasting time.  Very good idea - as the garlic cloves would have burned otherwise!  I also added 20 minutes to the second half of cooking time.  The game hens were delicious.  The sauce had a really good flavor, but was very greasy and oily.  Sadly, the sauce went into the trash, as we could not eat it.  Perhaps the game hens I purchased were overly fatty?    I will try a modified version of this recipe again, with a regular roasting chicken - as we did enjoy the flavors.

OMG! The aroma while these were cooking was divine! I almost couldn't wait until they were done, they smelled that good. It was a warm day when I made these and had my windows open. Even the neighbors were asking what I was making that smelled so yummy! I added a bit of lemon juice to my olive oil and sprinkled garlic salt on the hens before placing them in the oven. Also used a pinot grigio wine. I served them with stuffing I made with celery, pecans and cranberries. YUM-MEE! My husband was quite pleased and said this is a keeper. Thanks!

Loved this!  No stuffing and trussing to fool around with!  I didn't have a lemon, but I did have a lime so I used that--worked beautifully.  I didn't bother with any of the reducing pan juices, etc.  I just served the game hens when they were done (with a nice rice pilaf alongside) and they were fabulous.  Another time, I will go the extra mile, but for a Tuesday night after work....this was just fine!

This is a good basic recipe.  Next time I will add more spices maybe between the skin and the meat and probably leave out the lemon.  I thought that the lemon was a little over-powering. The cook time was perfect and the first 25 minutes at the higher temp browned the skin nicely and the meat was very moist when done.

Excellent, filling meal. Made only two hens, but quadrupled the sauce. Placed half the sauce in the roasting pan with minced garlic (also place a .5 tbsp inside). Cooked according to package directions, which was an hour fiften plus. Added flour to the "gravy."

this came out soooo good! But I cant fairly rate the recipe because I made a few revisions of my own. First, I didn't use wine or lemons because I didn't have any. I stuffed each hen with half of a small red onion and a clove of garlic each. Instead of wine i used double chicken broth (bouillon) and poured about 1/4 cup of simply apple apple juice into it. Came out soooo good. I served them with twice baked potatoes. Yum!

I think more seasoning needs to be applied to the exterior of the bird.

And double the sauce.

First time making Cornish hens, and this recipe suited my tastes perfectly! I like my chicken more well done, and crispy so I would cook longer next time to brown it more, and get the soft texture I like. Easy and really good! Made with Garlic Mashed red skins, and it tasted like we were eating out at a fine restaurant!

Because I failed to read the recipe thoroughly before shopping, I ended up making this without all the proper ingredients.  However, it still turned out great, and I'll definitely make it again.

I didn't have fresh garlic or fresh rosemary.  Instead, I combined minced garlic (from a jar) and dried rosemary and placed about a tablespoon of the mixture in the cavity of each hen.  Then I added the lemon as specified in the recipe.  I used butter in place of olive oil, and seasoned the birds with salt and pepper as the recipe stated.  I used apple juice in place of the wine.  I was worried that the juice would be a problem, but it added nice flavor without making the meat taste like apples.

Because I didn't follow the recipe properly for the birds, I didn't try the sauce.  But even with all the changes I made, the hens came out great.  I had company for Christmas dinner and they loved it.

The carcasses are now simmering down for stock and smell great.

This is a wonderful cornish hen recipe. Mine turned out delicious and perfectly cooked. I did add a few things...instead of wine I added cranberry juice, lemon juice and cut up a tart apple into the roaster to give the hens a slightly stronger citrus flavor. The apple became a mini-side dish in addition to the rice I served which was great with the extra sauce. This is one recipe I look forward to making again.

This was pretty good. We enjoyed it, but not as juicy as some of the other cornish hen recipes we've tried.

I made these hens today and they are GREAT!  So flavorful and tender!  I made side dishes of fettucini, mushroom gravy and scalloped potatoes.  YUMMMM!  :-)

Oh my!  Absolutely delicious!  And, as another reviewer stated, "pretty as a picture".  I use this recipe for all my poultry now...roast chicken and turkey.  Rave reviews! Thank you!

This was really good, and pretty as a picture, but it needed to cook longer than the recipe said.  We were famished by the time it was done and ready to eat, so that was good!  I served it with wild mushroom couscous, and asparagus!  Would make again

I followed the directions exactly, except for one change-I added some chicken broth to the pan in the beginning so the cloves wouldn't burn as suggested by another poster.  The hens were delicious!  The skin was a little crispy and the meat so juicy-my husband devoured it!  The only thing is I didn't have enough juices at the end to thicken into a sauce. I am not sure how to fix it or if anyone else had the same problem-maybe just double the juice ingredients?  But it was great anyway!

Fantastic recipe!  I'm so glad I found this one.  I made two hens for Thanksgiving for my fiancee and myself and it was perfect.  I did not reduce the measurements for the liquids, so I would definitely double the amounts if making 4 hens.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.

With a mild aversion to rosemary, I made this recipe substituting basil and added garlic inside the hens as well for additional flavor. It was outstanding!

very delicious.  I was very happy with this dish.  I only needed to make 2  but i doubled the wine, only becasue I love the taste of it.  Also, like someone had recommended, I put the chicken broth in at the beginning with the hens and garlic, so the garlic wouldn't burn.  Everything was wonderful.  Very flavorful and juicy.

This is a delicious game hen recipe!  I'll definitely be making this again...  Word to the wise, the cooking time is dramatically increased when you have more hens (it took me over an hour and a half to cook 8 hens).  Worth the wait though!

This was very easy to make and came out very good.  I couldn't find cornish hens, so I used a 4lb chicken and cooked it for 40 minutes instead of 25 minutes at 350 degrees.

This was my first attempt ever at cooking any sort of whole chicken, and it turned out excellent!  I followed the recipe almost exactly, and the hens came out juicy and delicious.  I have two more hens to cook, so I will use the recipe again.

This was a really good dish.  The flavors all meld together wonderfully and can be tasted all the way through the entire chicken.  I will definitely be making it again soon.  You might want to add more rosemary in the cavity and I believe you can hardly ever have too much garlic.

I am pretty frustrated with this recipe.  As of this writing, the hens have been in the oven for one hour and 45 minutes, and they are still not done.  The timing is way off in my opinion.  The recipe only calls for one hour cook time!

Good and easy.  BUT - I read the previous reviews and made some changes that others had recommended.  I don't think the changes were good and wont do them again.  :(   We love garlic, but it was too much garlic, so next time I will not put minced garlic in the bird cavity, as others recommended.  The sauce was WAY TOO GREASY, so I will not put the 2T olive oil with the wine and broth mixture AND I will not put any butter mixture under the skin, as recommended by another reviewer.    Yes, it was good to add broth/wine to bottom of roaster to prevent the garlic from burning.  I followed the cooking time suggested by a reviewer and it was perfect: cook at 450 for 30 minutes, then lower temp to 350 and cook additional 35 minutes.  I will make again, but I will follow the recipe more closely and not add the extra garlic and butter.  Thanks!

I made this for my family's Christmas dinner, and it was wonderful. A few days before, I brined the chicken and also stuffed a whole garlic clove along with the lemon and rosemary into the chicken. I also sprinkled lemon pepper onto the chicken and added chicken stock when I roasted them. Great recipe!

I have a very picky child and she saw Cornish game hens at the grocery store and wanted "mini chickens" for dinner.  I found this recipe and decided to try it out.  I didn't have fresh rosemary so I used dried. I sprinkled it on the skin and in the cavity. I also put a few garlic cloves in the cavity with a lemon wedge. It was so good she asked to have them again at the end of the week.  I did put broth in the pan like others so the garlic wouldn't burn. Great recipe, will definitely be making this again!

Amazing flavor, especially if you get a quality hen. Almost 5 star, but needed more sauce than the recipe calls for to get any "gravy" out of it. But it doesn't need it honestly.  Very tasty!

I loved making these cornish game hens from start to finish.  This recipe was not only easy, but it required very few ingredients, all of which I happened to have.  I prepared my roasting pan by spraying some olive oil spray, put the hens in for about 20 minutes, then added the garlic cloves which I cut in half.  The lemon inside not only added an incredible flavor but it made my whole house smell sooo good!! Combined with the rosemary, the lemon was perfect for game hens.  Total time they were left them in the oven was about an hour & 10 minutes.  I basted the hens every now and then, and once they were brown on the outside, took them out and added a touch more rosemary. These were absolutely delicious, and I can't wait to make them again!!

We made this for the main dish for Thanksgiving this year and it turned out amazing. You absolutely must buy a roasting pan to cook these, however, as a trial run in a baking pan did not turn out well.

These were fantastic! While I did need to increase the cooking time by and additional 15 or so minutes, I didn't need to make any other changes. Based on similar Cornish hen recipes, it seems many other people have had to do the same. So don't make this if you're in a rush as it seems the time may vary...but even if I had wait a little extra, totally worth it! Nice flavor!

This was fantastic! I followed this recipe as close as I could for what I had in the house. I made 2 hens but left the sauce the same. I didn't have fresh lemon so I poured a little juice in the cavity. I only had dried rosemary. I put 1 garlic clove in each cavity. The hen was moist and flavorful. When I made the gravy I pressed the cloves and added corn starch to thicken it. The gravy was delicious! We poured it over the hens and over mashed potatoes. Will definitely make this again

Difficult not to dry out a bird, but this recipe left my family and I with a juicy dinner. We all loved it! Made this for Christmas Eve 2013. I'd add a little bit more lemon and rosemary next time as well. Other than that, enjoy!

I had a small roasting chicken, and much to my dismay not nearly as much garlic as the recipe called for.  Still came out really tasty.  I brined the chicken first, then stuffed it with rosemary, sage, onion and lemon. I put some stock in the bottom of the pan so what little garlic I had wouldn't burn.

This was fantastic.  Would be just as good with a Chicken. I too put some chicken broth in the pan so the garlic didn't burn and used three hens as there are only three of us. Other than that, made exactly as directly.

I did not have a Cornish Game Hen so used a small whole roasting chicken instead. No fresh lemons so used a little lemon juice instead. Added an onion as we'll to the cavity. I also added broth to prevent the garlic from burning initially. It was delicious! The sauce was so awesome! I mashed the garlic in and the flavour was awesome! Highly recommended. Will definitely do this again.

Quite delicious especially with those whole garlic cloves. I made mashed potatoes to serve with the hens as well, and with the sauce and garlic cloves everything was delicious!

I did not care for this recipe. I thought it was very bland. The gravy was ok, but the meat didn't have much flavor. The skin also didn't get that crispy.

I used this for 3 hens and then for a single hen.  Easy and versatile.  I replaced the wine with sherry, the rosemary with basil.  It works for whatever herbs are available and whatever wine you have.  I used flour to thinken the sauce and strained it.

I loved this! I only made one hen, halved the original recipe and added butter, lemon, and rosemary under the skin like other comments have suggested. It was amazing. The gravy was terrific and the hen was soft and easy to eat. I HIGHLY recommend this recipe.

Some might not believe me, but this was the first meal I have ever made in all my 26 years (discluding boxed mac n cheese).  It was fantastic! I made it for Christmas Eve dinner and everyone raved about it. I did make a few changes though. First I put garlic butter under the skin (stick butter bought at the supermarket) and the other main thing I did different was put the garlic cloves, wine, broth and broccoli in the pan all at the same time before putting in the oven. It was a mistake but it made everything so tender and juicy. It was a welcomed mistake on my part.  I read most of these reviews before I made this so I hope this enhances someone else's experience as well :)

My husband thought this was delicious!  This was my first time cooking cornish hen and I thought this was pretty easy!  I took the advice from other reviews and put broth in the pan so the garlic wouldn't burn.  I also cut up some red potatoes and sweet potatoes and also roasted those in the pan.  Thanks for the excellent recipe!

Made this for company - a lovely presentation and so delicious!  I stuffed our game hens with a small amount of dressing in the body cavity; I used an 1/8 of a piece of lemon, a clove of garlic and a bit of rosemary under the skin of the breast meat.  I only used 1 head of garlic with this recipe; I seasoned as suggested, used the broth and wine combo, but added 2 tbsp of balsamic vinegar.  Our guests loved this!  Served with baby red oven roasted potatoes and asparagus.

I have used this recipe a handful of times.  The hens cook perfectly and are always moist.  Very easy to prepare but sure to impress your family and/or guests! Thank you for posting this - I have passed this on to my aunt as well.

Excellent recipe!  I made 2 hens that I placed on a rack in my roasting pan.  I used garlic flavored grapeseed oil (higher burn point then olive oil) and stuffed a few pieces of chopped garlic under the skin of each hen.  I did not use rosemary because I don't like it...I stuff the cavities with lemon, minced garlic and onion.  I doubled the broth and wine (Pinot Grigio) and added broth to bottom of pan.  The only error is I did not use low sodium broth so the gravy was a little salty to me but still a great dish!

Tried this tonight.  Did not have lemons or fresh rosemary, so ... I sprinkled lots of lemon pepper in the chest cavity, and then I made a paste of softened butter, lemon pepper, and ground rosemary and spread that under the skin over the breast.  I listened to the other reviewers and poured a little of the wine mixture in the pan from the start.  Oh, and I used butter instead of olive oil.  We loved it - in fact my partner wants to have it again later this week, using a regular chicken so he can eat more!

Wonderful - doubled the liquids for the sauce as suggested by others, used a little lemon butter under the breast skin, cooked just two of them in a cast iron skillet.  A note - the garlic cloves should be peeled, and they cook down into a sweet mild flavor.  If you really like garlic, use garlic infused olive oil!

This recipe was very good and made for an amazing holiday dish. The Hen was very moist and cooked perfectly to the time given. I did add more garlic and lemon wedges to the inside when cooking. I also put some on the outside between the wings. Really pleased with this recipe altogether. Would recommend to friends and family.

My first attempt at making Cornish hens... really easy to follow recipe and I followed very closely to the recipe except I don't have fresh rosemary, so I used dried crused rosemary, mixed them in the white wine/broth sauce and poured over the hens after 25 mins. Also didn't have a baste... but it turned out just fine. This might inspire me to make more cornish hens recipes! Thank you for the inspiration!

Agree with others that this is a delightful, tasty recipe but the game hens I cooked definitely required more time than the recipe specified. I'd say about 20 minutes more. I also doubled the liquid that the recipe called for and threw a quarter cup of flour into it afterward to make a delightful gravy.

They were veery simlpe yet really fancy. I took others suggestions and doubled the sauce. We served with mashed taters and peas. Even my daughter loved them. Only thing is next time I would only do two. i'm not sure if we just don't eat alot or what but it was way to much for any of us to eat. Have two whole left to make pot pie with.

Very good! I would also suggest to double the sauce to have enough gravy. Otherwise very delicious for a first time hen maker.

WOW!!!  Fabulous flavor...juicy with the perfect balance of of lemon, rosemary, olive oil and garlic!  I followed the cooking/timing exactly as the recipe said.  Perfectly done!  I also followed the previous recommendations to double the sauce (I cooked 2 hens and kept the sauce amounts as for 4 hens).  The only thing I did new was to coat the garlic cloves (with the thin coat of skin still on) with olive oil right before this went into the oven at 450 degrees.  After the 25 minutes, I put the sauce ingredients over the hens.  Who doesn't love roasted garlic?  Soft, creamy and sweet!  The garlic was like candy!  Next time I make this, the garlic will be "smashed" with little hot cooked red new potatoes!  Great recipe!!! My husband and I have very happy bellies!  Thank you for sharing!

I actually used one large roasting chicken instead of game hens because that's what I had. One of the best chicken's I've ever made. I didn't baste mine every ten minutes because I just don't have time for that, just every 20-25 minutes or so was fine for me. We really enjoyed this AND there's just enough for chicken salad tomorrow.

Excellent! Only change is I'd make more sauce/basting liquid next time. There wasn't much left in the pan to make sauce from afterward. Otherwise, completely excellent and delicious!

We had never made Cornish game hens before and made these for Christmas dinner. (Always a great time to try out something new, right? No pressure?) Anyway, they came out wonderfully. They only get four stars instead of five because while they were good, I wasn't blown away.

EZ & tasty. Next time, I'll turn the bird over to brown the other side. I added quartered potatoes, they were the best part of the dish. Next time w/ chicken. Game hens are just okay in my book.

This was a really nice meal.  The hens were beautiful brown and juicy, and the sauce thickened nicely and was a great addition.  I definitely recommend doubling it, because it's good mixed in with some wild rice too.  The garlic cloves spread nicely on the chicken once it's on your plate.  My only problem is with hens in general - they're so hard to pick apart and eat!

I've made this recipe 4 times now and each time it has turned out wonderful.  I follow the recipe exactly and when I do to take the hens out of the oven they just fall apart and the meat is tender and juicey.  I do brine the hens over night in a pot of salted water, and I cook them in an enameled dutch oven.  This is  one of my prize recipes..

this was my first time cooking cornish hens and they turned out great. boyfriend did not miss a beat while eating. The only thing i did different was brine my cornish hens for two hours before i cooked them. moist and delicious! also cooked mushrooms as other reviews suggested and cooked white truffle risotto as a side! thanks for a great recipe.

This came out good. The timing for cooking was exact, which was great! I basted it toward the end like recommended and it was very juicy.   I used half as much wine as was asked only because I don't prefer using wine to cook with and it seemed like a bit much. I replaced the "missing" wine with chicken broth and it still came out great.   The lemon definitely added zing to it and gave the normally bland birds some good flavor that seemed to hold. My boyfriend loved this.   I would highly recommend using real rosemary (which only cost me around $3) and definitely made it worth it. Overall good recipe and would recommend this to others.   Oh by the way, for those of you that dont know the hens cost around $4 - $5 a piece, where as each hen serves 2 people (split in half)

This recipe is excellent! Although I have roasted turkeys in the past, I've never really roasted a whole chicken and was delighted with how successful this recipe was. Instead of Cornish hens, I used two roasting chickens. Like some other members suggested, I also added sliced mushrooms during the last 30 minutes of cooking and they were delicious! Next time I will be sure to double the amount of mushrooms. I also added a minced onion to the pan along with 2 cups of chicken broth to make sure the garlic cloves didn't burn. Because the chickens are a bit bigger, make sure to add about 20-30 minutes to the roasting time. The meat was succulent and moist and I will definitely make this again!

This is a very good recipe but to spend the money on Cornish Hens was a waist because i still think Cornish Hen taste just like chicken so i could of easily just bought a whole chicken and done the same thing.

Made this as a whole chicken FANTASTIC. Doubled the gravy per PP and glad we did..yum! I put some butter, garlic salt, lemon juice and rosemary sprig under the skin as well as stuffing the cavity with a whole (halved) lemon, more rosemary. Might try an onion in there next time. This was divine. Took about 90 min to cook because of bigger chicken :) Oh, pool some chicken broth in bottom of roasting pan so cloves dont burn.

YUMMY!  That's the only word that adequately describes this dish.  I followed someone else's review and added a little chicken broth to the pan when I first put it in the oven.  I also only cooked 2 hens but made all the sauce.  Made twice baked potatoes and some yummy green beans on the side.  Will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe as my debut to Christmas dinner... for a bunch of picky eaters... I prepared the hens a day earlier, and then stuck them in the fridge. They were fantastic, and everyone LOVED them... absolutely recommend this for anyone who needs something that is easy but fancy!

Good but not enough sauce!  I ended up pouring a 1/2 can of chicken broth over the hens during baking and then once the sauce was transferred to the sauce pan to boil I added the rest of the can and 1tbsp flour to thicken it.  Once I did that it tasted great.  Will use again.

Perfect Christmas Eve dinner!  I added a bit of chicken broth to the garlic when baking to prevent it from burning as others suggested.  We served them with asparagus and sweet potato fries.  Very yummy!

We loved these, they were moist and tender. It did take longer to bake, but my game hens were nice and plump in size so that could account for having to bake them longer.

I made this for my mom who has to have a low sodium diet.  It was just o.k.  Maybe salt would have made it awesome, but the description of it made me think it would be the perfect low sodium option.  It wasn't a rave hit, but it was just o.k.

This is excellent...I don't like garlic too much so I just put a clove in the inside of each hen along with the lemon and the rosemary and that's it. It was pretty flavorful and moist.  I doubled the mixture of broth and wine as someone else suggested and that worked well. I will be cooking this again....over and over again...delicious!

Made this today. Very delicious.I only had two hens. I halved the olive oil and kept the rest of the ingredients the same. I used dried rosemary and dried thyme, rubbed it together with the salt and pepper on those birds. Stuffed the cavity with dried rosemary, a chunk of lemon and a clove of garlic. Used extra broth and a lil bit of lemon juice instead of wine as suggested by a reviewer. Yummy!Would like to try this recipe and method with chicken next time!

This turned out delicious! I put a tab of butter under the skin in the intial baking and added a little bit of flour to the sauce on the stove to thicken it up a bit. Otherwise followed the recipe with 2 hens. I will definitely make again!

Incredibly juicy and it smells so good when its cooking. The flavor might be a tad bland, so I would make sure you bast the chicken VERY often and don't be shy with the garlic.

I am  just now teaching myself to cook and I tell you what this was so much easier than I at first thought it to be. The end result was the juiciest and most falvorful meat I have eaten in a long time and it was cooked by ME! This recipe was awesome!

This was just yummy!  Flavorful!  My sons (18 and 20)never had cornish hen before so this was their initiation.  They loved it! I forgot to buy lemon so I just squirted some bottled lemon juice in each hen.  I also used dry rosemary and sprinkled some inside.  I coarsely chopped the garlic instead of leaving whole.  I also doubled the wine and broth as we LOVE sauces. I'll use this over and over again!  This is a picky family.

Are you for real/  This was such a great main course!  I Used a whole bottle of wine instead of the both and johnny's instead of salt.  The sauce was sooo good, I was actully slopping it up with the hen and fingerling potatoes.  I will totally keep this recipe and pass it on.

I have gotten so many compliments after serving this recipe. The only real change I made is to rub the hens with olive oil, butter, refridgerated minced garlic, salt, pepper, dried thyme, and poultry seasoning (making sure to also put rub and oil inbetween the skin and meat). I stuff it with the lemon and herds as directed and then let it marinate over night in the fridge and cook it the next day. I have noticed, as others have stated, that it doesn't have a lot of basting liquid, so I add more chicken stock and wine and that does the trick. Truly a great dish! Thanks:)

Hens were very moist,but didn't seem to take on much of the rosemary or lemon flavor.  Like others, I had to cook them a few minutes longer and added a little chicken broth to pan while roasting.  BUT....when I boiled down the sauce from the drippings, I pureed the garlic in the sauce.  THIS WAS SOOOOOOO GOOD!!! I think the "gravy" was the hit of the meal.  Will definately make this again.

Unfortunately this just didn't turn out well for me.  I added some chicken broth to the bottom of my roasting pan like other reviews but otherwise followed it exactly.  The meat didn't really take on any of the flavor from the lemon or rosemary.  It was very moist but I was expecting more flavor.  I'm not sure if I'm willing to try again.

This recipe is fabulous and I am going to attempt it on a whole chicken later.  I cooked two hens that were 22 oz each. After slicing the lemon into quarters, I inserted one piece into each hen and added the remiaining lemon juice to the wine mixture for basting.  I also reduced my temperature about 15 degrees.  The result was a tender, delicious dinner.  The sauce was perfect and added the cooked garlic to some red mashed potatos. Terrrrrrific!

I used two small chickens and boy were they good and so moist and tender.  Great combo with the lemon and rosemary.  I basted them 3 or 4 times during cooking.

This is an excellent dish.  I did not have fresh rosemary and used dried.  The aroma in my kitchen was wonderful, and the gravy, which I thickened with a bit of flour, was delicious.  I am not a fan of cornish hen, but I am now due to this recipe.

We loved this recipe. I couldn't get the fresh rosemary at the store so I used dried rosemary and I am not a big fan of white wine I had some red wine on hand so I used that. My husband and I loved it.

This was delicious.  I stuffed the birds with garlic and onions, and used dried rosemary on the inside.  Then followed the other directions exactly, except for using the lemons as I didn't have any.  The sauce really brought it all together.  Using the wine really added flavor (and I don't even drink wine).

I did this on a full scale chicken and it turned out wonderful! Smelled so good in the oven too! Even my vegetarian friend asked what smelled so good! I also cut small slits into the breast of the chicken and throughout and added little slices of garlic in the slits, very delicious!
For Valentines day I tried this again on Cornish Game Hens this time. Easily one of the most fantastic meals I've ever prepared. Had to change my rating from 4 stars to 5!

Very easy to make; very tasty; would increase cooking time a bit; did have to add a bit of corn starch to the drippings to thicken up, but had fabulous flavor; will certainly make again.

Absurdly delicious!  I ended up using one hen for two people, but kept the liquid amounts the same.  I stuffed two sprigs of rosemary inside along with only two cloves of garlic instead of the large number of cloves outside of the hen.  I roasted some potatoes in a separate pan as a side dish.  What a wonderful dish!

This recipe was pretty good. It was simple to make but the flavor was kind of bland. I would recommend brining them or marinading them before cooking. The hens stayed very moist though. Next time I will put garlic in it with the rosemary and lemon. It also didn't create hardly any drippings. It was an easy recipe to follow and I will make it again with some modifications.

pretty good flavors, just use a meat thermometer to measure doneness (my hens took about an hour at 350.  This recipie was good, but made me realize I just dont like Cornish Game Hens, they are too greasy.  Would try on a chicken or with pork loin.

Fantastic!  Easy to make. I decreased the garlic to 2 cloves per hen because 24 cloves would be way to much for my husband's and my taste. I also only cooked two hens with the same amount of broth and wine.  There was plenty of sauce to drizzle over wild rice and apple dressing. Suggestion: Use a tsp + flour to thicken the pan juices.

You really need to add some of the liquid before putting it in the oven or the garlic will burn and ruin the sauce.  Also, it needed more flavor.  Next time I will add some Adobo seasoning which has never failed my favorite chicken recipes. Overall, it's okay.  Thanks!

A solid recipe. I didn't thicken the sauce at the end, but the chicken was flavorful and moist. Next time, I would cut the garlic cloves into smaller pieces and stick them onto the chicken more; the garlic pieces I placed in the pan tasted raw and uncooked even after an hour in the oven!

I enjoyed this recipe. It made very moist game hens. For me, it was a little on the oily side. I might use more white wine & broth and less oil in the sauce next time.

We were not very impressed at all with how this tasted. A lot of garlic. Quick tip-get the garlic ready the night before you make it, it'll make a big difference.
The hens were good, but, the sauce was nothing special like I thought it was going to be.

Absolutely wonderful...made only 2 hens but kept the sauce measurements the same as called for in the original recipe. Rubbed hens liberally with kosher salt. Took others' advice and added a bit of chicken stock to the pan during the 1st round of roasting so garlic wouldn't burn. Had it w/ potato latkes and applesauce for a Hanukkah-style dinner, and boyfriend and I both loved it!

For my first time making Cornish game hens, I thought it would be difficult but this recipe was not only easy but fantastic! I added more wine, more chicken broth and  more olive oil(to rub the hen) and it was so flavorful!!!I'll definitely make this recipe again, maybe next time with a chicken though (for more meat)

I made this for my "slightly" picky fiancé and he LOVED it! Served up with some garlic smashed redskin potatoes, it's an easy meal that looks very elegant. (As a side note, you can find game hens at a certain major "mart" store VERY inexpensively)

I used it to make a chicken instead of game hens and it turned out great.  This was my first time cooking a whole chicken and my husband loved it.    It stayed so juicy.  I took the advice of others and stuffed the garlic inside the bird.  I also reduced the lemon because my husband isn't a huge fan.  In addition, I ended up doubling the liquid because I found that the amount stated wasn't enough. So much had evaporated halfway through that I couldn't baste the bird and had to add more.  In the end it worked great.  My husband says that I need to always make chicken this way.  Thanks.

I really enjoyed this recipe. It was the first time I made cornish game hens and  they turned out great. As with other reviewers I had to cook it longer than called for, but it turned out tender and flavorful. I did not have lemons so I used a few squirts of lemon juice (inside and out) for each hen. I added the twigs of rosemary inside the cavity, as directed, but I also added some to the salt and pepper mixture and rubbed it all over the outside.  I happen to be a flavor junky so all the additions were not too much. The only problem was that there was a lot of extra garlic not eaten by my guest... so I ate it. Big mistake! I had the tummy gurgles really bad (if you know what I mean)! Next time I will add a lot less cloves and a touch of garlic powder. :)

This was wonderful! I used the ingredients on a small chicken instead of a cornish hen, and omitted the rosemary (I don't care for it). I will definitely use this recipe again. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

I thought this was really good.  I used dried rosemary leaves since I didn't have any fresh and I cut the garlic in 1/2 since I was only making 2 chickens, but I left everything else the same since a lot of posters said that extra juice was helpful.  I'll make it again.

I prepared this for my husband and me on Sunday.  I used only 2 hens but kept the same amount of sauce for the original recipe.  It was wonderful!  It's the best recipe I have tried from this site.  I had 1/2 of the hen for lunch the next day and it was still delicious.  Thanks Behr!

I will be in the minority here. We didn't care for this at all. Took much longer to prepare, much longer to cook and it DOES NOT go well with a Chianti. Luckily, I had a bunch of other things that I made so we didn't starve but I cannot tell you how disappointed this recipe was. The gravy had a decent flavor but that was about it.

Delicious!  Served this for Christmas dinner with garlic mashed potatoes.  Increased the sauce ingredients as several other reviewers suggested, which gave us enough to use as gravy.  Will definitely fix again.

this was a new way for me to prepare cornish hens. we thought they came out pretty good! hint: if fresh rosemary's scarce around the holidays, wrap the fresh herb in a damp paper towel then seal it in a zipper-type plastic bag. the rosemary will keep well in your fridge for a couple weeks. thanks behr!

great recipe. would follow another members suggestion about leaving it out in the fridge for a crustier skin. I, like the canadian, had lackluster skin. And DEFINATELY make more sauce. It was great, but not near enough sauce. Next time I will triple the sauce ingredients.

Excellent!  I baked at about 350 until they were done and also put some garlic cloves in the cavity.  These turned out perfectly roasted and juicy!!  Oh, also I put everything in the pan from the start instead of adding after a time.

This was delicious!  I used two hens but kept the other ingredients the same; it made just enough sauce after reducing.  I chose to roast a whole head of garlic without peeling for about 35-40 minutes, then removed, cooled, and squeezed out the pulp to add to the sauce.  I had small hens and they took a little over one hour to cook (until the leg joint moved freely).  The birds were a bit messy to eat, but my husband and I loved it.  I will try this again with a whole chicken or bone-in turkey breast and carve it before serving next time.

My family loved this recipe.  I cooked it longer than the recipe calls for (about 30-45" additional).  I also pureed the roasted garlic and added that to the sauce.  Excellent.  We'll use this recipe again!

Wonderful recipe!  I used a whole roasting chicken and it was so moist and flavorful!  I made a few changes:  I didn't use broth or garlic, but I added butter.  Next time I will add garlic though, I'm sure it would be even better!  I also cooked it in a Reynolds oven bag. I would highly recommend this recipe!

This was okay, not great.  Took a lot longer to cook and wasn't as tender as I had hoped.  I'd rather roast chickens in my rotisserie (alot less work and better end result).

I had gone out to dinner and had the MOST DELICIOUS cornsih hens.  That's when I decided they would make a wonderful Christmas dinner.  I decided to do a dry run, and thank goodness I did.  They are easy to fix, they have good flavor ... but I think they need to be cooked A LOT longer.  The meat should fall off the bone.  These were VERY hard to eat and VERY messy.  The one I had at the restaurant was delicious, fell off the bone and was easy to eat.  I will NOT use this recipe again.

I cooked this for thanksgiving. It was the first time I've ever cooked a whole bird. It was easy but tastes great. I kept the everything the same although I only used two cornish hens. I added some cajun spices, it was wonderful!

I've never made Cornish Hen before so I was nervous about how they were going to come out but the recipe was simple and was a hit with my husband (I made this dinner for his birthday).

I have made this recipe so many times, I think I may turn into a game hen!  Everyone who has tried this has raved!  It looks wonderful and tastes even better.  I have even had out of town guests insist on taking pictures of the presentation to show friends back home!  I agree with one previous review that double the sauce is the way to go.  Two drum's up!

This is extreamly good. Easy to make and very tasty. However there is no directions as what to do with the 1/4 cup of rosemary, we just rubbed the birds inside and out with the 1/4 cup. When making the sauce, we mashed the garlic cloves into a paste and returned to the juices for reduction. Every one loved it, including our 6 year old.

I have never made a full chicken, let alone a Game Hen. It came out so good! I had the butcher half the hens while they were still frozen (for added easiness) and I cooked them like that with a lemon wedge and rosemary stuffed up in there. They were fab! Served with wild rice pilaf and european blend salad. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good, I followed the directions exactly and it turned out beautifully.  It's not quick because of all the steps, but it is fairly simple. We had this for a formal dinner and it looked and tasted marvelous.

The flavors really shine through on this recipe. I had to cook mine about 20 minutes longer in order to get the juices to run clear, but it was worth the wait. I'll definately be making this again.

I haven't made Cornish Hens before so I made this recipe exactly as stated.  This was so easy and got rave reviews all around.  It was amazingly tasty and the sauce thickened nicely with a quick heating.  This was our Thanksgiving dinner and I couldn't be happier with how it turned out!  Highly recommend.

This is so good! I made some changes to the recipe:
Hard apple cider instead of white wine; 
Water instead of chicken broth; 
Rosemary herbs instead of fresh sprigs. 

The flavors were super good and the chicken was juicy and perfectly browned. 

I baked the chicken for 25 minutes, added the cider concoction, then baked it for for 50 more minutes where I basted it every 10 minutes. 

I paired it with roasted rosemary red potatoes. It was so good!!

Delicious! I did not have wine so I just added more chicken stock and I was out of rosemary so I added a bit of thyme on the inside of the hen. I brushed the hen with a bit of butter towards the end.  The sauce was amazing after it was cooked down. I served it with rice and poured the sauce over the whole thing.  It was absolutely delicious!!!

I've never cooked any bird. This was my first because I was showing off to my wife. We both loved it. I'm glad I took advice from the reviews and prepared the full ingredients for only 2 birds. It was just enough. If you do 4 birds I would double the ingredients.

This had a great flavor!  I made no changes, except only cooked two birds. I also put the other half of the lemon in with the garlic cloves. My only problem was the skin of the birds didn't crisp. I will have to find how to fix that, because I will definitely make this again!

Very moist and delicious.  The bottom didn't crisp up so I put it under the boiler at 350 degrees for 10 minutes or so.  The lemon stuffed into the cavity definitely needed.  I made 2 hens for the 2 of us, we ate 1 1/2 between us.

Fantastic recipe.  Made this last night and turned out awesome.  Didn't reduce the sauce either, since was serving it with Saffron rice and wanted to have some juice to pour over the rice.  Absolutely yummy!

Thank you for sharing your recipe with us all.

This is the best recipe ever!  The hen was so flavorful and tender.  I didn't have lemons so I used dried lemon rind seasoning instead; everything else was the same.   It was soooo good!

Loved this recipe. My husband requested for me to try cooking Cornish game hen and I am so glad I found this. I only cooked 2 but kept all the other ingredients the same. I even followed the some advice of adding chicken stock in the roast pan so as not to burn the garlic and it turned out great!

I was looking for a new way to cook cornish game hens and this fit the bill perfectly! I won't use any other way from here on out. My husband loved them! I did stuff butter, garlic, and rosemary under the skin and added chicken broth to the pan so the garlic wouldn't burn. Great recipe!

This was a delicious meal. I upped it to make six Cornish hens for a crowd. 
Instead of whole garlic cloves I finely diced the garlic and used as directed. I read other reviews about the garlic burning during the initial high heat roasting so I did add in the chicken broth & wine for the entire cooking time and my garlic did not burn at all. Otherwise I made this just as directed, adding in about a tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken the sauce. This is a great recipe and I'll be making it again.

The sauce burnt at the bottom of the pan so I could not make the gravy and they took a lot longer to cook even though All  Recipes said they adjusted it. The meat was moist and flavorful.

Roasting time of 50 minutes total was nowhere near long enough - and I was only doing half the recipe (two hens). Skin was getting black by the end, but meat was raw in the middle, and garlic cloves were still crunchy. I would try an hour and a half, and cover for some of it to prevent burning. After cooking for extra time, though, it was very tasty. I added more broth, seasoning, and flour to the drippings to make gravy.

This meal was incredibly delicious! I did however do extra things to make it this way. I brined in the "Citrus Turkey Brine" found on all recipes, of course changing it to fit the amount of hen I was using. In this case I was cooking 4 hens. I only brined for 2 hours. Then I boiled carrots, celery, potatoes, onion and garlic in a water/vegetable/chicken broth mixture until they were close to tender. I placed all the veggies in the bottom of the pan and then placed the hens on top (breast side down). I followed all the directions of this recipe, but placed orange with the lemon and rosemary inside the hens. I poured a little wine and chicken broth with the veggies before the basting when lowering the temp. I also flipped the birds over when I lowered the temp. When they were done it was super moist and they were perfectly golden brown! Yum!! After it was all done I took the drippings and made gravy... soooo good!!!

Wow...I was surprised at how good this was given that it was so easy! I forgot to buy lemons at the grocery store so I used a red onion instead. My husband loved it as did I! Served with wild rice and broccoli. Will definitely make again!

This recipes was okay. I made two of these hens for my dad and I in lieu of making a big turkey for Thanksgiving, and maybe it was just because I really wanted turkey, but this recipe was nothing special. You couldn't even taste the rosemary or lemon. Next time I make this, I'll be sure to use more rosemary.

I have made these before and am always looking for a good variation.  This recipe was spot on.  I took other's advice by adding broth to the pan, layering potatos, basting, and cooking time.  Everything came out delicious! Also, my house smells soooo good and the taste is even better.  Thanks for the recipe and all of the thoughtful suggestions.

This is a great recipe.  I used 6 gloves of garlic, your preference.  I didn't have an open bottle of white wine, so used an inexpensive sherry, and the sauce had a very nice taste.  The hens were golden brown, a very nice presentation!

This recipe was just amazing. I felt like a chef when my family was eating it.  They couldnt stop ooing and awing! I used fresh lemons and rosemary from my yard which made it even better. Just a hint : be sure to use just 1/4 lemon in each hen. If not it will be a little too tangy...

This is my new signature dish!  This was a fabulous recipe with great flavour.  The sauce/gravy is absolutely amazing.  I doubled the wine and chicken broth to 2/3 cup each to make more sauce as recommended but otherwise followed the recipe as is but added 10 minutes to each of the 25 minute times.  I also added gravy/water to the sauce to thicken a little.  This is really an easy recipe with high end results that will impress your guests!

What a delish recipe! Cooked two hens for two adults and one child but kept the gravy measurements the same. I added cornstarch to thicken the gravy because we are bread dippers. YUMMY!!

I haven't had much experience with game hens.  This was a super easy, flavorful recipe.  Make sure you season the hens with salt and pepper generously as that's what helps with the overall season of the sauce, which was DELISH, by the way.  If you're a novice game-henner - then I say, give this recipe a try

A word to the wise -when making several together in a pan, consider it taking 1/2 hour or more to be ready than the recipe calls for. I had to even up the temp back to the original setting. Everyone loved it!

This chicken will make you think you are a world class chef. Made as is and the mother in law loved it. If you squeeze some of the lemon onto the hens the flavor will enhace.

Tasted fine, but not browned at all, and I followed listed directions exactly. Disappointed.

I used two hens.  Added onions (cut into 1/8th quarters) and added Rosemary seasoning with the salt and pepper.  I went much lighter on the olive oil to save calories and WW Points +.  It was so simple to make plus I kept it even easier by not adding the wine (saved calories) too and saved steps and pans by not reducing the broth.  Saved left over broth in frig.  After I cut the hens in half I returned them to the oven to finish browning up all over. I estimate WW points plus at 9.

It was really very good and the sauce was amazing, but I think Ill make it in the slow cooker next time. Its probably just me but it took forever to roast. I think the slow cooker cooks chicken more thoroughly.

SO fun! My other half and I did these as a small Thanksgiving together when we had to be apart from the family and it was absolutely perfect. They were so fun and really quite easy. Couldn't improve upon them in the least.

perfect, really, but i only did 2 hens and kept the same amount of sauce (maybe even a tad more) roasted some new potatoes along side them and whole carrots with the hens. should have added celery as i planned to (but forgot) also added a touch of sage and thyme in the broth. nice that something so simple could turn out so well

This was amazing. The gravy turned out excellent, the birds were delicious and infused with that great fresh rosemary flavor. My boyfriend loved it. 

I  made this with steamed asparagus in a white wine Parmesan cheese sauce and roasted red potatoes drizzled with a combination of melted butter and extra light olive oil mixed with crushed rosemary and sweet basil. 

My god. It was so good.

By far one of the most delicious recipes I've ever tried on this site. The game hens came out tender and juicy. I added a bit of cornstarch mixed w/ water for the gravy, so it was thicker. I also added the giblets in the pan, and then to the gravy. And my hens were a bit bigger, so they had to cook just a while longer. But otherwise this recipe is right on the money. YUM!

I made this for me and my boyfriend, he couldn't get enough of it. One of the main things I did was make a rub out of my favorite herbs and minced fresh garlic and rubbed under the top layer of skin (by peelng it back for a sec) and also on the top, then drizzles them with olive oil. Inside the body I stuffed a wedge of lemon and a clove of garlic. And also squeezed fresh lemon and lime juice down over the top of both small birds. I poured a small amount of olive oil in the bottom of the pan, a good amount of chicken broth and a little bit of white cooking wine. I kept basting the birds in the juices every so often to keep them moist. Yummy. I will definitely be making this one again!

I (and my family) loved this recipe!  I used 2 whole young chickens instead of cornish hens, but amazingly, the cook time wasnt too much more!  I used more wine than the recipe called for...but I love saucy things so thats what I went for...more sauce :)  I also added some orange wedges inside and on top of the chicken to add some sweetness to help offset the lemon flavor in case it was too powerful.  Everything worked out great and the next night, I was able to use the leftover chicken to make chicken alfredo :)  Thanks for the recipe!!!

This recipe was absolutely delicious and it turned out to be so moist. My only regret is I cooked only one cornish game hen instead of of multiple ones!

I would highly recommend this- the other reviews were fabulous! I can't wait to make this one again.

This recipe was great.  Never made cornish hens before, and I'm glad I tried with this recipe.  As other reviews, I cooked them about 20 minutes longer, but threw some small yukon gold potatoes in too because I had them.  Yummy.  I also only made 2 hens, but didn't cut the sauce back, and they were moist & delicious.  I can't wait to make them again!

My husband and I love this recipe!  We usually add some garlic powder to the salt/pepper rub.  Some of the garlic we leave in the bulbs around the hens and sprinkle a little olive oil on them...they go great with the hens and are a lovely addition to mashed potatoes!  Great recipe!

Followed recipe... didnt love it.  Probably wouldnt make it again.  I have a awesome recipe for roasted rosemary chicken, so I may be a little bias.  Wasnt a fan of the lemon flavor... but I did like the flavor of the cornish hen, lemon and garlic aside.

Great recipe! I made only to hens and followed the recipe as if I as making four. I also added garlic powder, onion powder and old bay seasoning to the recipe. I also stuffed the hens with one clove of garlic and roasted the hens breast side down as others suggested. came out very tender and delicious. The only downside was that I did not have enough juice after baking to make the sauce.

These were really good. The only thing different that I did was that I stuffed the cornish hens with stuffing & then I wrapped the entire bird in raw bacon before cooking. So good & the flavor was unbelievable. This is the only way I can get all my kids to gobble them up & they did. The bacon becomes so crisp and flavorful. It also makes for a great base for gravy. Wonderful recipe.

I really enjoyed this recipe the first and second nights.  By the third night, I was a little bored and had a guest coming for dinner.  So I took the the two remaining hens and removed the skin and bones.  Added the meat to the leftover sauce with a little extra wine, chicken broth, and lemon juice.  Served it over pasta and it was FANTASTIC!

This recipe was amazing.  It was my first time making cornish hens and was really nervous.  It turn out FABULOUS.  I only made two so the sauce was the perfect amount. I would double it if were doing two.  Thanks for sharing.

I used this recipe for quail at Christmas dinner (obviously with different cooking time), and we really liked the lemon and garlic inside. I also added several dried cranberries to each cavity and it was wonderful. I did not end up having time to do the sauce but would like to try it some time.

Exceptional! I only made 2 hens and did not have fresh rosemary or garlic cloves on hand, so I used rosemary spice (just sprinkled some in the cavity) and minced garlic (a couple tablespoons in the bottom of the pan with a little chicken stock. Sense I'm from Minnesota, I paired it wild rice and green beans! Turned out fabulous!!!!

This was absolutely delicious!  I cut the recipe in half, but it still turned out great.  I love the rosemary/garlic/lemon combination...the chicken came out full of flavor and SOO juicy!  This would also work great if you substituted a whole chicken!  All in all, a great dish that was a huge hit with my family!  And the leftover meat made a great chicken salad the next day!

I also injected the lemon juice under the skin, the taste was mild but very good. It takes 2 -21/2 hours for these to cook, no way they cook as quick as the recipe states. the sauce never did thicken, would have to have added corn starch and perhaps a bit of cream since it was a mild amost flavorless taste. too timid for the main dish.

I feel funny rating this 4 stars when I actually made these so differently from the recipe - we rotisseried them on the BBQ, so no gravy but lovely crispy skin and delicious.  I used only 2 hens (enough for 4 people), and rubbed lemon on and inside the hens, put the seasonings on and inside, substituting garlic powder for garlic cloves (they would have fallen out the cavities the way we positioned them).  I put some of the olive oil inside the skin of the breasts as well as all over the outside,so they would self-baste. I didn't use the white wine/chicken broth but this was so good, next time I will try cooking this the way it was written. Thanks!

SAUCE WAS A DISASTER. DO not use equal parts wine and broth as recipes calls for. HUGE mistake! It needs seasoning, too. ick. The chicken was okay- medium moist, but could use more flavor.

Made these for New Years Day dinner.  Tender and succulent.  The drippings made a wonderful gravy.  I have always looked at Cornish Game Hens as a "fancy" meal (once every couple of years), but these were soooo good, I may just make "hens" a once a month occassion!

This was so delicious!   I made for a family gathering and it was a hit.  The hens were so tender and juicy with a lot of flavor.  I served with sauteed butternut squash and wild rice.  The meal was so festive and lovely!  Each person had their own hen, and for those that actually had leftovers, I sent them home with their doggie bag.  I will definitely make this one again.

The hens came out very, very moist, but the cooking time on this recipe is completely off! It took an additional 35 min of cooking. Also you really do need to add more condiments (salt, peper, etc to make this really tasty otherwise you will have your guests asking for the salt shaker.

Can anyone tell me if they covered the hens or just left them in the oven without a lid over them.

This was really delicious.  I left the skins on the garlic cloves while they were roasting in the oven and slide them out of the skin before adding them to the sauce.

The hens were moist and cooked up well, yet did not have as much flavor as I expected. I will probably try this again, but with more seasoning on the hen.

The hens were very moist and smelled wonderful.  I would say these were good, but not delicious.  Probaby would only make again if they were on sale.  Not a go to item.

Outstanding. I recommend absolutely no changes. The only variation I made to this recipe was I did not have fresh rosemary sprigs so I just rubbed about a teaspoon inside the hen. It turned out to be really moist and delicious.

Great taste, but after baking them for an extra 30 minutes they still were too moist.  I promise that's possible.

I'm not a huge fan of lemon, but I had never tried cooking with it. I halved number of birds and doubled the chicken broth (adding it with the garlic as suggested by others), and used two heads of garlic instead of counting out the number of cloves.   This recipe was so good I couldn't believe that I had made it. The cooked lemon and the way the flavors came together was nothing less than gourmet. I used Carl Sittman Riesling (about $10 a bottle) for the wine, which I accompanied with dinner and was a perfect touch.   The gravy was fantastic, I added just a bit of cornstarch to thicken it up and reduced it for around 10 minutes. I threw together some instant garlic mashed potatoes for a side, which was a fantastic (and cheap!) side for this dish.   Wow! I will definitely be making this one again.

These had more flavor than I thought they would. The entire family really enjoyed eating these, and I enjoyed serving them (they look so fancy on a platter)!  The recipe was very easy.  Served with steamed veggies & boiled potato. Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe!  I simply added the wine and broth, a little more broth than called for, to the pan along with more rosemary and strained it into a gravy separator.  I then made a roux in the pan with 1 tbs butter and 1 1/2 tbs flour and darkened it.  I picked out the garlic cloves and put them back into the pan along with the liquid, less the fat.  This made a very savory sauce with a rich roasted garlic flavor.

Really good, but if I were to make 4 hens I would double the sauce ingredients.  I Followed the recipe exactly but made only 2 hens and found the sauce was just enough for 2, I don't think it would be enough for 4.

NICE! I cooked just one. Perfect amount of garlic, the lemon and spices are wonderful. I prepared mine in one of my Le Creuset pots - right in the oven. When it was done baking I just took the hen out of the pot and made the gravy on the stove top. There was NO mess. Next time I make this I will add more stock to make more gravy as suggested by others. KEEPER!

This recipe was nothing special taste wise. It was rather bland. Though the meat was tender & the skin nice and crispy, it was nothing out of the ordinary -- just an average meal. I added water, additional rosemary, and salt & pepper to the sauce, then thickened it with cornstarch to make a gravy that got better reviews than the meat! I served the hens with wild & long grain rice and colorful stir fried asian vegs.

We enjoyed this for Easter dinner and it was so tasty! If you use kitchen shears, it makes short work of cutting the hens in half, and they look beautiful presented on a nice platter. I only made one change--I squeezed the juice of half a lemon in with the olive oil/white wine to add some extra flavor. I also had to bake the hens about 15 extra minutes. Such a nice change from ham and turkey. It paired well with the White and Wild Rice Pilaf from this site.

Simple, easy and delicious.  The aroma of the roasted garlic was almost too much to stand!  My husband and I normally share one cornish hen, but this time we each at our own.  I added fresh mushrooms to the sauce and used my meat thermometer for doneness, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

so so good.  pretty much made as is with noted points: 1) spray hens with cooking oil, 2) add some minced garlic underneath skin, 3) add extra clove of garlic to each cavity, 4) added a bit of broth to bottom of pan to prevent garlic from burning, 5) basted hens every 5-7 minutes.  so friggin good.

I just made this recipe and it was aweasome. I made it for my family for valentines day and they were very impressed. The only thing I added was I put a garlic clove inside the cavity of the hens along with the lemon and rosemary. Highly recommend it!! Happy Cooking!!

Excellent recipe. Simple and delicious. I cooked about 15 minutes longer than the recipe stated and the meat was falling off the bone. I'll definitely make this again.

I assumed that the hens needed to be baked,covered, with the roasting lid on. The recipe did not specify covered or uncovered. After 30 minutes the hens remained pretty pale looking and there was way too much gravy...i then realized that the recipe likely inferred to be baked uncovered...off came the lid,  after another 30 minutes of baking they started to colour up....they were fanatastic and enjoyed by all....whew!!! Yet another Christmas meal to remember!

Wow! Just wow! I melted two tablespoons of butter and added minced garlic, rosemary, pepper and about a table spoon of lemon juice, than I spread the mixture under the skin of the hens. The rest of the recipe I followed exactly as written and it turned out great. The sauce was wonderful and I didn’t find I needed any sort of thickening agent. This is definitely a recipe to serve for company as it makes a great presentation.

Very yummy, esp. the gravy! Followed the recipe except used dried rosemary instead of the fresh and added about 1/2 cup chopped portabella mushrooms about 20 minutes before completion. Also, I added cornstarch to the gravy to thicken it a bit more.  All in all, the meat and gravy had a very delectable flavor.

This was great and really easy!!  Next time, I am going to use a little less lemon and more rosemary in each hen.  The lemon taste was a little too strong. To make the sauce, I worked in the garlic cloves with a hand-held potato masher and thickened it a bit more with corn starch.  Additionally, as others' suggested, I added broth to the garlic while roasting so it did not burn.

This was one of the best recipes I have used for Cornish Hens...I reduced the amount of garlic, just a personal preference, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful.  I got rave revues from family and dinner guests. The hens were very moist and very flavourful.  Thank you for a great and simple recipe

Following tips from various websites I also soaked the hens in salt water brine for 1 hour+.  Rubbed butter, herbed and orange zest under skin. Put juice of 1/2 orange and orange slice in cavity. I made a rub of cinnamin, b sugar, nutmeg, allspice to dust them with. Result was sweet and rosamary herby.

I had never prepared cornish game hens before and wanted to create a dish that had the "wow factor". I did double the sauce recipe as others suggested. This was a huge hit and has instantly become a family favorite. Simple, yet fantastic!

Another 5 star!  Very, very simple and fast to throw together.  I've made it twice now, once with lemons and once with lemon juice.  It was  better using the lemons.

This turned out great! Even my 4-year-old who is nearly impossible to feed ate everything! Like one of the other reviewers, I didn't have garlic cloves, only minced garlic, so I put some of this in the cavity of each hen with the rosemary sprigs and lemon wedge. I also added another spoon or so of it to the sauce for basting. I cooked the hens breast side down and they were so tender and juicy! This recipe is a keeper!

This recipes was easy and fabulous. I followed the directions for the most part but only used two birds. I also doubled the sauce as i like alot of sauce. The time listed for cooking was right on the money and the sauce turned out excellent. I will definitely be making this again in the future.

I followed the recipe almost exactly (I cooked the hens breast side down until there was only 15 min left and I also only used two hens) and it turned out great! My husband has been raving about them and I'm sure I'll be making them again soon. Once I reduced the sauce, it was just enough for the two hens, so if you make 4 be sure to double the wine and broth.

This is one of my husbsnds favorite meals to cook, and I only had to show him once. He's becoming a quite the sous chef. I think the sauce is more suited for 2 game hens instead of 4.

What an absolutely wonderful sauce this made! And so simple and easy with just a handful of ingredients. Did not add anything (did use dried Rosemary in place of fresh) and it was absolutely wonderful. However, haven't made Cornish game hens in quite some time, and while they make an elegant presentation, I very much prefer the flavor of chicken. Will definitely try this recipe again with either a whole roast chicken or pieces, and will increase sauce ingredient quantities. Did not use any thickening agent; reducing down yielded a wonderfully tangy, rich garlicky sauce. The cloves of roasted garlic would be an additional treat spread on toasted bread; we just ate them along with everything else. If anyone has any suggestions for using this recipe with whole or cut-up chicken, please share! Wonderful side dish for this are the Twice Baked Sweet Potatoes, also found on this site.

This recipe turned out ok.  It was my first time making Cornish hens so maybe that was the problem. I followed the steps exactly but the garlic burned and my whole apartment was smoky.  The birds came out very tender but didn't have a lot of flavor. They were a bit messy and difficult to eat. I'm thinking next time I'll just go with chicken breast

I loved this recipe, it was so delicious!!  Like others, I had to cook the hens about 1/2 hour longer, and I only cooked two hens.  I added garlic powder and onion powder to the skin of the hens in addition to the salt (I used sea salt) and pepper. I am a garlic lover, so I can never have enough.  Next time that I will double the sauce.

This was a delicious treatment for an old favorite. One recommendation though: Add at LEAST a half hour more at 350 - I pulled ours when the recipe said to and checked them and they were still pink. I did like a lot of the reviewers and kept the sauce the same but only made 2 hens. It kept everything nice and moist. Now that I know to adjust the cooking time, I'll make sure to keep this one on hand.

I agree with others comments about not having a lot of flavor. The hens were moist, but I will try another way to flavor next time I want to make these.

I was very dissapointed,This recipe needs a lot more herbs then called for. It was really lacking in flavor.  and the cook time should increase about 20 mins so that the skin is crispy.I'll stick to my own herbed Chicken recipe.

I used a regular 5lb chicken instead of a game hen and this turned out perfect!  I cooked it at 425 on Convection Roast for about 1.5 hours.  This was honestly the best chicken I have ever eaten, and it was pretty when it was done too!

Delicious!!!  We've made this twice since we found the recipe and will definately make it again and again.  The sauce is very flavorful.  The cooking time was also perfect.

This was excellent and VERY juicy.  I think next time I may make a rub with rosemary, lemon pepper, tarragon, basil and thyme and rub that on the outside of the bird - it definately got more flavorful towards the center.

Tasty recipe.  The pan sauce evaporated so I had to add more.  And I used beer instead of wine - still good.

these were great!
i personally will 1/2 the wine and up the broth in the sauce, maybe just in the simmering stage for the sauce, because it was a bit too 'winey' for my taste. everything else was great. thanks!

Very yummy recipe.  On the advice of other comments I doubled the liquids to make more gravy.  The only major change I would make is to perhaps reduce the number of garlic cloves to 18 (it was a bit garlicky to me).

Succulent.  The flavor of the rosemary and lemon came through the meat which was excellent.  I tied the legs up in butchers twine which is important to cooking the bird evenly.  I also added more wine to sauce and added a little flour and water and one chicken bouillon cube.

Excellent recipe!  I took someone's advice and added the broth and wine from the beginning.  I also sprinkled some dried rosemary on top.  Will definitely try with chicken since there wasn't enough meat on the hens.  Also, I agree that the sauce is just enough for 2 hens (I only made 2 hens and we had just enough).

I tried this recipe out on friends today it got rave reviews for being so flavorful and tendor. I didn't have a lemon so we used an orange and we didn't have white wine so we used vermouth. The juice we used as gravy on our mashed potatoes. It was awesome.

Thank you for this recipe! This was my first time cooking cornish hen, and I followed the recipe almost exactly (except I may have cooked the birds for a bit longer) and it was absolutely delicious. I will add more garlic and wine the next time.

This was a great cornish hen recipe.  I did make a couple changes to it though.  First I juiced 4 lemons and added rosemary and basted under the skin with it before putting in the oven.  I also added some butter under the skin.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious!  I will definitely make this again for a special occasion.

This recipe was a lot of work for something that was a bit average. I tried to follow other people's advice and add as much rosemary as I could.  I also added red potatos to the dish (those turned out wonderful).  But the hen came out average.  I'd either use a TON more lemon and rosemary to get more flavor, or just save myself the work and make chicken breasts.  The amount of work didn't get enough payoff for me.

EXCELLENT!! I used a whole chicken breast in place of hens. This was extremely flavorful
and went nicely with honey ginger carrots and my homemade sundried tomato
stuffing. I usually alter recipes to my taste but had to do nothing different with
 this recipe. Thank you Behr.......YUM!

I used the extra rosemary in the sauce and poured it over the chicken and it was delicious.

For a main course that really looks like you spent alot of time on it, this recipe took no time at all and was a breeze.  I made them for Thanksgiving and actually forgot to baste them during the final cooking time.  They were so moist and tender with a wonderful flavor;and we popped the garlic cloves right in our mouths.  I have since passed this on to several people, alot of them being non-cookers and they have impressed their guests.

My family and I have prepared this meal several times and we all love it!  I find that, in my oven, it takes about fifteen minutes longer to get the nice golden brown coloring.  A homemade apple-spiced stuffing goes wonderfully as an accompaniment.

Nice recipe, but I don't think adding Rosemary as a garnish does anything to the plate as a non editable and is a waste of money on an herb that should be used elsewhere. Food critics have often stated that on the Food Network.

I did not follow the recipe exactly. I didn't use the vinegar. I made a butter and herb mixture that included adobo, minced garlic, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, dried thyme, dried basil and dried rosemary. I put that under the skin of the hens and on the outside of them. They came out great. Few other minor adjustments I made but all in all this recipe helped me make a great meal. Thanks!

This recipe makes a fantastic presentation if you're looking for an elegant meal! I do as others and double the gravy recipe. I like to serve it with red-skinned mashed potatoes, steamed broccoli, crusty rolls, and a green salad. One of our family faves!!

Used half a lemon inside each hen.  Added sliced onions to four cloves garlic.   1 cup chicken broth instead of broth & wine.

I made it with two hens, but used the full amount of liquid per suggestion in another review. My husband loved it, although I will admit I didn't use any garlic, since he doesn't like it at all! (But I did put some chopped garlic in the sauce.) Easy to put together and was enough for two meals.

I've never had cornish when before. It seemed a little tougher than ordinary chicken which surprised me. I thought the smaller bird would be more tender. Maybe I didn't cook it right, but I tried to follow the recipe as closely as possible. I also thought it would be more flavorful. I'll try again and update my review another time.

This is a great recipe!  Similar taste to Cornish Hen we at Dolly’s Dixie Stampede!  4 was too much for our 2 adults and 3 kids under7 yrs old.  I didn’t use wine, just added more chicken stock to make the difference in liquid. I also added sliced purple onion in the cavity.  Also used a tablespoon or 2 of corn starch to thicken the sauce.  Next time I’m going to use limes instead of lemons for a stronger citrus note.  Or I might just do it the same way again. Again, great recipe and easy to make!

Made this last night and everyone LOVED it!  I made it exactly as written --  no changes.  It came out perfectly.  When I said we were having "Cornish Game Hens" everyone was very impressed because it sounds hard but it's super easy.  I will definitely make this again.

I have made this several times.  If you are on the fence about this one, do not be. Try it- this is a very nice savory chicken dish that is not packed full of unnecessary ingredients. Everything added to this one is a meaningful ingredient.

First time cooking cornish game hens, and they turned out great! I actually smoked them for about 40 minutes using hickory wood chips (temp around 250F), and then finished them off in the oven. Family and I loved them and will do again!

Roasted only one game hen for the two of us.
Used 1 lemon half and 1 rosemary sprig in the cavity.
Used 3 garlic cloves cut into strips.
Used 1/4 cup white wine and 1/4 cup broth to baste.
Otherwise, followed directions exactly.

This recipe was really good and we really enjoyed it a lot. Delicious!  I made this recipe as written with a few small changes.  I added thin slices of lemon and garlic underneath the skin before roasting. To the rotating pan I added multicolored small potatoes, carrots, parsnips, and mushrooms.

I added a little bit more wine and chicken stock to the drippings to make a bit more gravy. It needed some corn starch to thicken properly.

We ended up eating later than I wanted because the game hens were not done.  Definitely needed more cooking time.  Hens were juicy though, not dried out.

12/27/18 This was delicious and so very easy.  I added garlic cloves inside the hens and used oranges as I have an over abundance of oranges right now.  I put the hens on a low rack so they would not sit in the bottom of the pan and get soggy.  As one reviewer suggested, I poured about a cup of chicken broth in the bottom of the pan before baking.  The garlic smelled strong but was mild in taste. I did double the sauce and it was needed, especially for leftovers.  I will try it again with lemon as I'm sure that's delicious, too.

Cooked three hens. Used a red wine instead of the white because that is what I had on hand. 
The sauce is  very tasty. Overall a success.
Yes I will make it again.

Made this for a festive family dinner and followed the recipe exactly.  The roasting pan I used was too deep so the birds did not brown enough—easily fixed with a short turn under the broiler.    I served it with a morel mushroom risotto, which balanced well with the bright flavors of the sauce.   A very elegant meal that was pretty easy to prepare.

It was excellent, the market was out of fresh rosemary so I put dried rosemary in the chicken broth and let it cook down before  basting, served with Brussels sprouts and new potatoes with the same broth?? Very good, I will make again. Thankyou!

Im sorry to say I was disappointed with  the seasoning. A little bland. The birds didn't crisp up  like i wanted.  If  I make it again I'll  kick up  on the seasonings. Brinding  too.

We made these little birds for Thanksgiving this year and they were succulent!!  This may become our tradition.  Adapted this recipe after brining the little birds overnight using another recipe.  Instead of lemon, I used Clementine oranges.  I also added bay leaf to the mix when stuffing the birds.  Cut oranges in half and placed them directly below the birds in our shallow roasting pan so they didn't dry out.  The juices fell onto the oranges and recycled themselves!

I made this hen for thanksgiving and everybody loved it. I didn’t add any rosemary. Since my family and I stopped cooking turkey on thanksgiving, we used the hen to cook some of the stuffing. Therefore, the ingredients that were supposed to go in the cavity were placed around the hen. The stuffing went in the cavity of the hen. The hen tasted ????????

I made this for Thanksgiving today instead of turkey and I'll never go back. The cook time was spot on for a perfectly cooked bird without a single dry spot. I took the advice of other users and doubled the wine sauce and it was probably the best part. I did not baste the birds so the skin would have time to cris

This is a helpful recipe.  Very simple and get juicy and tasty hen.  I made some of my own tweaks.   I melted some butter and put some garlic, onion and some spices in a pot. I coded the hens with this mixture.  I stuffed the hens with rosemary, sage and thyme, onions, garlic and shallots.  I put the same in the roasting pan along with some carrots and sliced celery.  I also followed other people's advice and put the chicken broth in the roasting pan at the start.  I did 30 minutes at 450 and another 30 minutes at 350.   Reducing the juices to a sauce took longer than 6 minutes. It took nearly 20 minutes.  And it's probably because I had more liquid from my two hens.  In the end, the hand that I ate was succulents and juicy with great buttery and garlic taste

My third time to make this Delicious recipe ,I don’t think I will add the extra oil to sauce st the end next time as the chicken produces enough fat on its own.

Followed the Cornish hen recipe,  cooked it  an extra 10 minutes because I always do - looked fine, went to cut it into quarters and found red liquid blood all down the back bone and red at the leg joints.  Horrifying!

Beautiful citrus flavor comes through beautifully. If you don't want to burn your wing tips and keep your hen moist, tuck the wings behind the back cut hole in the skin and cross the legs.

I halved the recipe, and followed it to a "T", and wouldn't change a thing! They were tender and juicy, and the sauce gave such a nice flavor . . . you could even taste a hint of the lemon in the sauce. My husband and son enjoyed this as well.  Will make again. Thanks for the recipe!

Loved this recipe! Made it for valentine's day dinner for me and my boyfriend (I made two hens).  After reading the reviews, I decided to double the wine and broth for the sauce.  As a result, I added a little more garlic clove to the dutch oven as well.  I stuffed the cavity with the lemon, rosemary but also a clove of garlic.  I decided to use the remaining two quarters of lemon and remaining rosemary springs and tossed them in the dutch oven as well.  The sauce was very flavorful and the hens were cooked perfectly!! I highly recommend this recipe.

Tasted great if you're into these flavors.  Seasoned with onion powder salt and pepper in addition. Method was great for cornish hens.  Cooked on 450 for 25 min then on 350 2 times at 10 minutes each time. Moist juicy tender. No lid on the roaster. I did add some broth to bottom with garlic at beginning as someone suggested and for the white wine i used dried cooking sherry. Sauce was delish. I used regular chicken broth instead of the low sodium.

I made two cornish hens for Thanksgiving using this recipe.  The only alteration I made was following recommendations to add chicken broth to the pan to prevent the garlic from burning.  This made for a very easy and delicious Thanksgiving meal for two.

This was very simple to make and very tasty. Had everything needed on hand needed to make it. Will use this recipe again. One suggestion I learned recently if you love crispy skin is to let the Game hens sit in covered in refrigerator drying our some before baking. Works well.

This was my first time making cornish game hens.  It was a messy, but juicy dish.  The hens didn't brown and there wasn't anything left of pan juices to reduce.

This was my first attempt at cooking Cornish hens.  I cooked two instead of four and it was plenty for my husband, daughter and me, with one half left over. I used only 6 cloves of garlic and tried to make up the difference by rubbing the hens with garlic-infused olive oil.  Next time I'll  use more cloves.  Also, next time I will turn the chickens over halfway of the first cooking , to make sure the skin is crispy all over.  The breast was nice and crispy, but the rubbery skin on the back was unappetizing.  I will make this again.  It was easy (I have a rosemary shrub in my garden and always keep the other ingredients on hand) and tasty.

I made this last night and it was absolutely delicious. I agree with other comments regarding doubling the sauce. After simmering the sauce to reduce, I mashed the garlic with a fork. The sauce was thick and creamy...perfect for dipping crusty bread into. 5 Stars!

This was SO easy and very tasty.  I put some extra lemon and garlic inside the bird and put some cloves under the skin. Like others, I put a bit of chicken broth in the pan to keep the garlic from charing and it worked great. Afterwords, I put all the broth and garlic into a sauce pan and made it into a gravy with a little flour and butter.   I've also made this where I put carrots and potatoes in the pan with the garlic and broth and mashed them up after. Super tasty.

There was only 2 of us ...so I used only one hen and cut the ingredients down somewhat!  I used lots of Russian garlic and had some leftover turkey broth to use up!  Fast, easy and delicious!!!  This is company worthy!!!

Very good! I used everything but the lemon(didn't have one) I just sprinkled a little bit of lemon pepper seasoning inside the cavity. Also only used 1 tsp of garlic powder instead of the cloves. Served with rice and chicken gravy, corn, deviled eggs and school lunch rolls from this site.

Outstanding game gens to be sure, but I've used it roasting chickens and my guests are knocked out.  The only thing I can tell you is to double the ingredients for the sauce every time.  Awesome meal!

The cooking time is way off. Followed the instructions exactly and the hens were bloody inside. Put them back in for 30 minutes more at 375 and that was adequate, but they were not browned as I would have hoped.

I made this recipe for Christmas dinner and we all loved it.  I did make one change from the recipe - I marinated the hens in a mixture of olive oil, lemon juice, salt, chopped garlic (lots) and chopped rosemary (lots) overnight.  As there was already a lot of garlic on the hens after marinating, I didn't put more garlic in the roasting pan.  I also cooked them longer than the time given in the recipe.  They were absolutely delicious.  I will definitely make this again!

Delicious and extremely easy to  make. You probably have all of the ingredients on hand except for the Cornish Hens. I made it exact like the recipe said but I took 1/2 a lemon and squeezed it over the hens in addition to putting the wedge in them. Try it, you won't be sorry!

This was my first time cooking cornish game hens and I found this recipe easy to use.  I used additional broth instead of wine and it turned out great.  I also noted the cooking time was nearly twice as long as stated.  Will use again.

The only change I made was to halve the recipe, using only 2 hens. I used a Finger Lakes French Oaked Chardonnay for the wine. I didn't add any liquid to the roasting pan to start, birds tend to add their own juice. The birds were juicy and flavorful. The sauce was delicious! Incredibly easy and will definitely make it again.

I tried this recipe due to the ingredients: rosemary, lemon and lots of garlic.  The flavor was good, sauce flavorful, but the cooking time was way off. I left in the oven longer than the recipe called for, and I could have left it in even longer.  It was hard to break the legs and wings off. If you're looking for a fall off the bone chicken, the cooking time must be increased greatly.  May try again, though,  with that change.

I made it as posted. We very much enjoyed this. To help when cleaning a large amount of garlic, separate cloves, put in a metal bowl, place another metal bowl on top, like a ball. Then shake. Most peels come off.

I made NO changes. I tossed out all other Cornish Hen recipes. This is the ultimate for me.  It is so good I am going to make it with a whole chicken. As this recpoes calls for 4 hens, 1 whole chicknen should work fine with no changes.

Excellent recipe, but I did improvise a bit because I didn't have  reduced sodium chicken stock.    In lieu of the chicken stock, I used Progresso's Traditional chicken soup w/pasta and carrots.  The pasta and carrots became my side dish which I heated up in the sauce!  Yummy.

I was even kind of lax with this easy recipe. I decided to drape bacon all over the hens during the first 25 minutes, which I felt was a mistake because the hens didn't brown. So I removed the bacon to its own pan, left the hens cooking for another 15 or so minutes at 450 until they browned, then I turned the heat down to 325 and let them go for another 25. They actually turned out juicy and flavorful. Hard to mess up this one!

Pretty good.  I'd say wait until the outside of the poultry has browned *before* you lower the heat, regardless of how long it's been in there.

The garlic/white wine reduction was insane good.  This recipe would probably do very well with full-sized chicken.

My husband made this for me which was a risk (pregnant and all meat grosses me out at the moment!) This recipe blew my mind, it was so flavorful and delicious. The skin on the chicken was my favorite part. We had sauteed zucchini, squash and red onions with rice to compliment and pull it all together. I asked him to make it for me a second time a week later!

I made this last night, my boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I did, however, make a few changes.  I only made 2 hens and cooked them in a cast iron pan in the oven, I also added more garlic.  Once the hens were done, I removed them as directed and put the pan on the stove top.   I then added half of a bag of haricort verts, a bit more chicken broth and smashed the garlic cloves, covered and cooked for about 8 mins. Removed the haricort verts, cooked down the sauce and served with a loaf of crusty italian bread!  Delicious

These turned out great, served them with some mushroom risotto (Gourmet Mushroom Risotto from Allrecipes). My one critique is portion size - I would put a 1/2 hen on each plate. We struggled to eat one hen each, especially with a side.

5 stars for quick, easy and great tasting!  I did not use the juices for a sauce at the end.

Loved the "gravy" it made.  I used oil on the hens when cooking but for "gravy " I subbed melted butter in place of oil.  Loved the wine, broth & butter mixture.  Next time I'll serve the gravy over egg noodles along with the hens!

I'm not a cook So I just followed the recipe and for me it was not that great. It was bland and it took a lot longer to cook than specified. This may be a good foundation for people who are good cooks.

This turned out great.  I may have cooked it a few minutes longer and I definitely agreed with adding a garlic clove inside with the Lemmon and rosemary (I doubled this, too) with salt and pepper inside.  Served with steamed broccoli and wild rice with dried cranberries, sunflower seeds ands slivered almonds.
I would make this again for sure.

The recipe was amazing! I followed it completely - except, instead of using "white wine" I replaced the ingredient with "white grape juice" and added 1 tsp of lemon juice. Perfecto!

I really thought it would be dried out cooking it for so long but it was so moist and very flavorful! I did 2 hens and used my cast iron frying pan so they didn't brown as much as they could have because they were so close together. I did add some chicken stock in the beginning  as others had suggested. I would made this again!

We loved it! 
As several other users suggested, I doubled the wine/oil/broth mixture and poured an additional 2/3 cups of chicken broth in the bottom of my roasting pan at the beginning, so as to prevent the garlic from burning. I have quite a large copper pan, so yes the majority of the juices still cooked off. BUT when it was done cooking, I deglazed the pan with more wine. Voila, a little more liquid for the broth. And as the gravy was cooking at a fast boil, I held the hens above the pan to let more of their juices drain out into the sauce. Ended up with a ridiculously good  gravy to drizzle over our chicken and mushrooms.

I also took the advice of other users and threw sliced mushrooms into the pan 40 minutes into the cooking process. They soaked up that flavor beautifully and made a nice side dish.

You can also take one of the roasted garlic cloves from the gravy, mince it into a pan with a little butter and saute some spinach to go with your meal. That, plus some buttermilk biscuits to soak up leftover gravy, is an awesome combination.  Definitely making this again!

This recipe is really good! I'm so excited that i finally found a good roasted chicken recipe! But there's not enough sauce. I would definitely make it quite often in the future with more sauce adding to it. And would probably try on different spice for different taste.

I made this recipe for Easter dinner.  It was easy to put together and it smelled fantastic while it roasted.  I couldn't wait to try it.  Let me tell you, it was the most TASTELESS poultry I have ever eaten.  The garlic belonged in the cavaties at the very least.  If I were to make this again I would have to treat each one like a mini turkey and put butter, herbs, and garlic under the skin.  This was a VERY disappointing dish.

Excellent recipe.  I did brine the hens first.  And I forgot to add the wine.  The birds took about two hours (not one) to cook, following the recipe here.  But the flavor was excellent.  I also used the gizzards to make a gravy, combining the gizzard liquid (gizzards, onion, carrot, broth cooked for 1-1/2 hours the night before, chopped the gizzards and added them to the cooked broth) with the pan drippings and a little flour.  Fantastic.

Try this next time: I put some minced garlic in the cavity along with the lemons and rosemary. I put a mixture of 1/4c, butter, 1/2 tsp. minced garlic, juice from 1 quarter of the lemon and some dried crushed rosemary(I mashed this all together) and put in under the breast skin.

Very tasty and very easy.  Hubby doesn't like rosemary (yeah, I know, right!) but I used tarragon and it came out very nice.  Next time I will used a bigger pan so the skin get crispy on the sides as well as the top.  Can't wait to make this again.

Deeeelicious!!  My family loved these hens.   I didn't have fresh Rosemary on hand so I used dried herbs de Provence.  Stuffed the hens with the lemon and fresh minced garlic as directed and added some broth in the pan as suggested so that the garlic cloves didn't burn.  I forgot to add the wine and more broth to the pan so I added wine to the renderings when making the sauce. Thickened a bit with some cornstarch.. yummmy!!

Never made Cornish hens before. First time and my boyfriend loved it!followed users comments about making a butter, lemon, garlic, and herb paste and rubbing it under the skin. Also put some on the skin as well. Filled cavity with an extra lemon wedge, the Rosemary sprig, and a sprig of thyme. made sure to tie the legs together. It was so moist, juicy, and not  overpowering in flavor. Browned nicely, and the sauce was wonderful! Did not need to add flour if you boil it par directions. Only made one hen, but will make another soon.

This was very good. The hens came out tender and very flavorful. Next time, I'm going to double the sauce ingredients (wine, broth, etc.), as there didn't seem to be enough of it for our liking.

This was an amazing recipe.  I tried it out on our good friends and they are from Scotland.  They said it was "BRILLIANT".  You know what??? I believe it was.  I did make a few adjustments in the sauce to have more.  I made this with rice pilaf and asparagus.  Without a doubt I will be making this again.  My hubby still talks about it.  Thanks for the recipe!!!!!!

The meat was very juicy but i didnt care for picking around all those bones. The lemon in the sauce had a bite to it and was greasy. Probably will not make again but the presentation was beautiful.

Very flavorful, made exactly as states plus took reviewer tips and added lemon and garlic to cavity.  I'm not sure what happened though, there was no juice from the drippings to reduce.  It was more of a crustaceous film at the bottom of the roasting pan.  So no sauce, but that's ok, the rosemary infused beautifully and it was still quite tasty.

Delicious, so juicy, so worth the effort.  I just made one for myself.  I used a 1/2 lime instead of a 1/4 lemon for my hen, and it worked fine.

I never tried roasting cornish hens. They were on sale for 99cents a lb. so i bought a couple, used this recipe and voila, delicious chicken! Great basic recipe. Thanks.

I use this on regular ole' Costco chicken thighs and just stuff the rosemary, lemon, etc. under the skin and it is THE BEST!  We often eat this during the holidays and I can't say enough good things about it.  I mix a little cold chicken broth and cornstarch and mix it in to the "sauce" to make a thicker gravy that we put over mashed potatoes.  SO YUM!

I made cornish hens for the first time last night and it was perrrfect.  It was soooo easy and delicious.  My entire family loved it. I only used 6 garlic cloves instead and lessening it did not take away from the flavor.

Very moist and absolutely delicious.  The only change I made was to turn up the oven to 400 and cook a little longer until the hens had browned.  I'd also recommend throwing a little more garlic on the pan... my kids went through the roasted garlic like it was candy.

The hens were juicy and so yummy. Be sure to INCREASE THE COOKING TIME a bit, two out of four hens were mostly done, one was perfect, and the other was quite bloody. I substitued fresh parsley for a certain family member who dislikes rosemary, and she loved it. After only being able to eat half of my hen, I put it in the fridge and when I ate it cold the next day, the rosemary really stood out. I reccommend using cornish hens for this recipe, it's so much more fun!

Good. I usually make a fryer chicken with spices in the slow cooker. No water, broths needed as the chicken will make it's own juices. I liked this recipe, but I will continue to make it my usual way.

For this recipe I took other suggestions and stuff the inside I use sliced elephant garlic cloves, lemon, rosemary and a slice of onion.   I stuffed under the skin with minced garlic, fresh ground rosemary and cracked black pepper. I cut down on the garlic cloves around the bird because of the changes I did also put the remained of the onion total was only a quarter. I basted and doubled as others suggested I gave this a 4 because the herb crusted recipe from another site was much better. It was good but I was disappointed after the other reviews.

Wow! Great recipe. Of course, I made some changes - added some red potatoes and way more garlic (a bulb and 1/2), but the basic flavors of this recipe are what make roasted poultry so wonderful.

This was very good, but the only thing is the cooking time.  I had 2 small hens a little more then 1 lb.  The cook time was like 1 1/2 hours from start to finish.  I put garlic in the cavity along with the rosemary and lemon.  I also turned the oven back up the last 15 minutes of cooking too 400 to crisp the top of the hens.  It worked out great

The sauce was amazing in this dish.  I might suggest using bone in chicken pieces (breast for example) to anyone who is unfamiliar with game fowl.  You get the same taste without the hassle of carving an entire bird.

Delicious and great presentation. Mine had to cook much longer than suggested and I wasn't able to get that wonderful crispy skin that others got. I would also cut smaller lemon wedges next time.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I followed the advice of another reviewer, and chopped the rosemary and added that and lemon juice to softened butter, and rubbed that under the skin of the game hens. I'll make this again. it was very easy and pretty to look at on the plate.

I think this recipe sounded good, but it lacked flavor.  Crisping the skin more would have helped, it just seemed very bland.

I've made this recipe 4 times now, and it is excellent every time!  Love it.  It's also beautiful and makes for great presentation with guests.

I've also tried it with a whole roaster chicken, which turned out delicious but not quite as moist on the first day.  Leftovers were spectacular.

Great flavor! Tender and juicy. Stuffed the hens w/large slices of onion, garlic cloves and lots of spices. Basted every 10 minutes for last 30 minutes of cooking time. Used more wine & more chicken broth. Didn't use a lot of rosemary as I don't "love" it's flavor instead used a mixture of bread dipping spices. Served w/roasted vegetables and Grandma Ople's Apple Pie from this site. A great combination.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner, following the recipe exactly.  The chickens needed extra time to cook.  It tasted really good, but not spectacular.  I think next time I'd put some garlic inside the hens.

I was put in charge of Christmas dinner this year and since we had turkey on Thanksgiving I wanted something a little different. 

I'm not a huge garlic person, and neither are my parents, so I only used four cloves in the sauce and put one clove in each bird cavity. I also sprinkled a little thyme onto the skin of the birds before cooking. I also doubled the sauce to serve five.

Our hens required more cooking than suggested on the recipe but they still tasted absolutely fantastic! So moist! Yum! Definitely a favorite and will make again.

This was a big hit for our Thanksgiving.  I wanted to do something different, as I knew we would be having Turkey with our larger family get together.

Each person received their own hen and it came out wonderful.  Due to the lack of time, I didn't cook up the sauce with the pan drippings, but the flavor was excellent.  I used a chicken rub instead of the salt and pepper, but everything else was delicious.

I had to cook it about 20 more minutes (not even sure if that was long enough)...but might have just been my oven, as I was doing two different roasting pans.

We used this with a 20-25LB turkey over the last few years. The results were amazing, we added some paprika and adjusted the wine accordingly and cooked it in a oven bag. The turkey was moist for days afterwards no dry turkey!!! The homemade gravy was delicous from the results of the drippings! Kudos!!!!

This was incredible! I double the seasoning and it made an amazing sauce. I also added a fresh squeezed lemon to the sauce, which gave it a slightly stronger flavor. I am going to make this for Christmas Eve this year and I am sure it will be a huge it!

This recipe was excellent,  I wondered why so many garlic cloves, but when you taste the flavor you will know!

Sauce was a bit thin, though, so reduce a bit longer or thicken.

this recipe came out wonderful. as another reviewer said, the sauce came out a little thin and i wish i had used corn starch to make it a little thicker. It went wonderful with some garlic mashed potatos and sweet corn. my girlfriend had never tried Cornish game hen before and loved how flavorful this recipe came out.

I didn't love this recipe.  I'm not a huge cornish hen fan but I do like to make them a few times a year, and I have yet to find a good recipe for them.  With this recipe the chicken smelled great while it was in the oven but there wasn't a lot of flavor.  Most of what was in the bottom of the pan burnt so I was not able to make the sauce.

what a great recipe!  i also did butter under the skin; about 2 tbsp. with grated garlic, dried rosemary and a little bit of lemon juice.  i also did not reduce the basting sauce after the birds were done; they were still very moist!

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!!!!! I use a whole chicken instead of cornish game hens and it works great.  This is one of my favorite recipes.  I make this meal with garlic mashed potatoes and it is wonderful.  I have used this recipe with and without the rosemary and I think it tastes great either way.

My husband says this is the best poultry he's ever had!  I didn't have a lemon or white wine so I just used lemon juice and beer.  I also cooked it for and hour and a half and ended up with a very nice crisp skin.  Very moist and delicious.

This was a really easy and delicious recipe!  I used the same amount of sauce for 2 hens and it was a good amount.  I guess it depends on how much liquid you boil off- I made it quite thick, but it was fabulous!  I'll definitely make it again!

The aroma when baking was delicious!  The hens were moist, tender and had a light flavor.  Maybe I could have done more to flavor throught the skin next time.  Very good though.

This was awesome!  I did make a few changes because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand.  I substituted lime for lemon, cilantro for rosemary, and cesaer salad dressing for the chicken broth.  The gravy was delicious!

First time I ever had cornish hens--most excellent recipe to try for the first time. I loved the way you could taste the rosemary. Didn't taste the lemon so much. But mmmm mmmm! So good. Serve with freshly brewed iced tea!

i thought these were just OK. not nearly as good as i expected. there really wasnt all that much flavor to the actual meat. on the plus side though the gravy was really good.

These were OK. I followed the recipe as listed and the end product was very moist. However there wasn't enough flavor for my flavor hungry family. It could have been the herbs and lemon that I used, not really sure. Will make again with adjustments. I gave it a four because the meat was tender and moist.

This recipe is terrific... I've never been a huge fan of rosemary but I crave this one!  I've tried the recipe with both the cornish hens and a larger roasting chicken and it just wasn't the same with the roasting chicken.  Cornish hens are the way to to go.

I modified this recipe a little to use with one organic farm fresh chicken. I didn't have any wine to put in the bottom so I just used water and chicken bouillon. But the rest of the recipe I followed and I love it! I am definately putting lemon wedges inside the chicken from now on.

This was an excellent dish! The chicken was moist and the skin tasted great. My fresh garlic had, unfortunately, gone bad, so I sprinkled garlic powder on the hens and in the sauce, and it turned out fine. My only suggestion is to perhaps add a little flour to the sauce to thicken it up a bit (if you like thicker sauce like me).

Good, but not my favorite recipe.Was kind of boring. I added extra lemon for more zest. Definetly use fresh rosemary.

This was my first time making Cornish Game Hens, and it was incredibly easy! My husband absolutely loved this recipe! Great taste, and the meat was so juicy! I didn't really care for the sauce though, there was somethign about it that just tasted weird to me. Great recipe! I'm adding this to my recipe box!

Never having prepared Corn.Hens before, I was a little nervous how they would turn out. But this recipe was wonderful. I did double the sauce but other than that I fixed according to the recipe. The fresh rosemary is a must. They smelled the kitchen with such a wonderful aroma. I fixed UncleBen's Tomato/basil rice as a side dish along with a nice bottle of wine and it was a perfect Sat. night date (with my husband)night. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was a yummy recipe!  The hens were very moist and delicious.  I fixed it for my husband and a friend of his.  The friend called the next day to let me know how delicious the cornish hen tasted.  I was not sure if I should have covered the hens in the roasting pan or not.  I covered them until the last 15 minutes of cooking time and they still turned out great!  Will cook this many more times in the future.

Well, after reading all the reviews for this recipe I was a little nervous about over cooking the birds and drying them out. So I cut the time by just a little bit and sure enough they were not all the way done when we cut into them. Other than that (my fault, really) they looked beautiful and could really taste the garlic, lemon and rosemary. It was a little too much work for how little meat they provide. Next year I will cook a turkey this way!

Will definitely use again!!  The only thing I did differently was add whole mushrooms around the hens for the last 20 minutes of cooking.  The hens had a great flavor and they were nice and tender.

These were pretty good and made for a very nice presentation.  I made a mixture of butter, garlic, and lemon juice and spread it under the skin before baking.  I had a little trouble getting my sauce to thicken and had to add some flour...it was still a little runny in the end.  Overall this was tasty.  I had forgotten, however, just how terribly greasy and messy cornish hens are.  Because of this, I would likely not make this recipe again.  But I might try the sauce with some chicken breasts or theighs, because I thought it was quite good.

This is SO GOOD.  It's fairly simple, and it makes a wonderful special occasion dinner.

I did not enjoy this recipe and neither did my guests.  Since the reviews have been so good, I can only assume that I messed it up or that we are just not Cornish Game Hen fans.  I did love the Rosemary and Garlic flavor though.

I improvised with dried rosemary, lemon juice, much less garlic, and marsala wine because that was all I had on hand.  The flavor was very, very good!  Definitely recommend this!

I made this recipe with a roasting chicken instead of cornish game hens, and we cooked it on the grill.  It was fantastic.  My boyfriend, who rarely compliments out loud, told me how good it was. By the end of the evening, between actual dinner and picking, the whole chicken was gone. I'm going to try it with a turkey next.
