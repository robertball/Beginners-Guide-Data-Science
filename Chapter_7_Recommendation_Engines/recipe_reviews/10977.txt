These were good and an extremely fast and easy cookie to make.  Just a tip...when adding the flour mixture, just mix until combined.  I ended up mixing it until it was all smooth and it turned out way to sticky that I had to scoop it out with a spoon.  OOPS!  I added both white and dark chocolate chips to these.  And to give it an added flavor add about a teaspoon of either vanilla or almond extract to it, they both are great!

Ive made these 3 times now. 1/2 cup powederd sugar seemed kind of low, even for shortbread cookies, so I did somewhere in between 1/2 cup and 3/4 cup. Also, I found that its best not to soften the butter, but to whip it up cold. These are very good though. I made them the other night for my parents party.  We had also ordered some cookies from a bakery, but all of my cookies got eaten long before the bakery ones. All the guests kept asking my mom for the recipe.

For a richer flavor, I add 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the creamed sugar.  I also flatten the cookies slightly before cooking.  Great recipe.

I prefer a sweeter cookie but these are good for shortbreads.  I added vanilla extract as suggested and it didn't seem to add much flavor.  It was a little starchy tasting and it made me very thirsty!  These would be good with coffee.  I probably won't make these again.

These cookies are sooooo yummy! A favorite in our house, and my neighbours house, and all my inlaws houses, and my moms house. I even make these at christmas time and give them away to everyone as gifts.

I found that adding 1t of almond extract can give this recipe a nice variation.  I also substitute 1/2c Crisco for half of the butter - personal preference - but it's a great recipe just as it is!

They were okay, but they tasted too flour-y. Too much cornstarch. I think it's because of the powdered sugar, which already has cornstarch in it. Maybe it would've been better with regular sugar. Thanks anyway.

These were very good i doubled the recipie [that way i could use the whole bag of chocolate chips..the open bag is too tempting...] and they were just fine. i was a little sketical as the dough didn't taste very good so i added a little bit more powdered suger, but the finished product tastes just fine, a little "floury" but i don't think that distracts from the taste. i think they will be good with jam...i might try that next time...

I have made these cookies for several years now. They're wonderful. I put Andes Peppermint Crunch baking chips in them at Christmas time. I get asked to make them year after year! I'm sold on this recipe. Miniature chocolate chips are good too.
