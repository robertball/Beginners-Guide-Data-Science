Oh My God! So let me state up front that I am a single father with 4 kiddos (YES we do exist!) and a 12.00 an hour slug ( No child support thank you Texas.). At any rate the day before shopping day (read-payday) I was going through the fridge trying to come up with dinner. I found a roast and a few other sundries so I get on the pooter and I find this. My changes were not enough mustard so I added enough teriyaki marinade and cheap-o-depot bbq sauce about a half a cup combined between the two) to come up with the required liquids add a few potatoes and onions to it before I wrapped up the foil and headed out to a mesquite tree fired grill.Hey I live in Texas. You can't swing a dead cat without hitting a dead mesquite tree. So anyway I wish I could tell you about the leftover sandwiches but there was nothing left over. the kids ate it ALL!. I will definitely make this again.... and again and again!

I added 2 tablespoons of brown sugar and one tablespoon of water to the mixture. I used 3 different mustards instead on just one. I only used 3/4cup of mustard and I also seared my roast on a hot BBQ prior to coating and wrapping. We thought it was really good the sauce turned out the perfect consistency. I will make this again. I have frozen the leftovers with the sauce and they were excellent later on too.

I liked the basic idea but I added to it and it turned out absolutely delicious. I added a tablespoon of horseradish sugar and water and I used grainy mustard. I also chopped up a whole head of garlic and added it to the marinade. You could smell it cooking down the block! Time was less than 2 hours though.

The roast was okay. It was just too much mustard. And you're right - it's not much on presentation! My family didn't say anything about it - not a good sign in our house.

Easy to make and tastes great. It was the first time I attempted a roast on the BBQ and it won't be the last time I make it this way again. And as staded the left overs are great for sandwiches I personally use Dijon mustard.

I prepared this as written and am so upset with the results. Wasted a 12 roast. It's meat cooked in mustard and that's exactly what it tasted like. Hubby ate it slathered in ketchup but the kids wouldn't touch it. Had to make them something else.

I made this tonight - on Father's day and we loved it! Thanks to your DAD for sharing the recipe with you and to YOU for sharing it with us! I used half grainy mustard and half yellow mustard and added some garlic. Easy Peasy on the BBQ...and really moist. I will definately make this again and again.

This is a great recipe - but it depends on the mustard you use. I used about a 2.5 - 3lb roast so cut the recipe in half and cooked in a crock pot on low for about 8 hours (added about 1/4 cup of water to the slow cooker before turning on as well). We used El Diablo Steakhouse flavored Mustard and it was really tasty and came out great - everyone really enjoyed it!

Seems like any good rub will do. Made mine with garlic powder fresh ground pepper Cajun seasoning. I also increased the garlic to 4 cloves. Came out moist and pink inside and beautifully brown outside.
