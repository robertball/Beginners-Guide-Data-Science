Very good Sherry. I needed to add more water and I replaced the shortening with a bit of sesame oil. I also threw some toasted sesame seeds into the batter. We used teriyaki sauce with a dash of sesame oil for our dipping sauce. Family was thrilled!!

Excellent batter, I didn't marinate them though and they were fabulous. I did some research online and found these tips: pat the shrimp dry and lightly dust them with flour to help the batter adhere.

Very light and crispy.  Make sure to dry your shrimp well and that your oil is very hot, otherwise they come out greasy and gummy.  I added a little sesame seed oil to the marinade than added some sesame seeds to the batter.

Great recipe.  Husband loved it.  Didn't have any rice wine on hand, so I used 1/4 cup rice wine vinegar & 1/4 cup sherry.  Shrimp tasted just like the ones at our favorite Japanese restaurant.  Excellent for chicken, too.  It can be a bit messy when cooking (skimming the oil between batches helps), but I think it's worth the mess.

Amazingly authentic tempura.  I substituted sesame oil for shortening and added some toasted sesame seeds like another reviewer... Fantastic.  For those of you having trouble with the batter sticking... pat dry the shrimp and dredge in white flour before dipping in batter, the standard procedure for frying, and you will be good to go.  Bravo.

We did not use this batter recipe for shrimp, and omitted the marinate, but i used the basic tempura batter on onion rings and chicken and it was lovely. It worked the best on the chicken, it stuck perfectly and was SO tasty. The onion rings were good too, but for that particular veggie the batter was a tiny bit too thin. It was SO good though. And perfect since we always have everything on hand anyways. I have already passed this recipe on to my mom! Its wonderful!

We enjoyed this batter a lot!  I used it on vegetables and it was great.  Some of the veggies soaked up too much of the vinegar though!

Yum! I made the tempura batter for a fondue dinner and it was a huge hit.  Very easy to prepare, clung well to the dippers, and fried up beautifully.  Thanks!

Simply awesome!!! We have made this twice; once with jumbo shrimp and once with the smaller cheaper shrimp. My fiance is half Japanese and hated the smaller shrimp because he said"it gets too crispy and tempura is not supposed to be that crispy, but welove the batter espially on jumbo shrimp! When I make the shrimp I also use this batter for Zucchini. My fiance wants me to do broccoli next!!

Good recipe, the key is not to marinate the shrimp though! or at least that's the way I liked it! when marinated it tasted way too soury, not they way they serve it in a Japanese restaurant!

Very good basic batter for frying.  Not just for Shrimp although the shrimp was really good.  I also used this batter for onion rings too.  I didn't see any need to soak in rice wine and salt.  I added a little extra salt to the batter and omitted the sugar.

For the batter to stick well you really need to pat the shrimp dry with a paper towel.  After dipping in the batter I rolled in Panko bread crumbs for an even crispier coating.  Very good but I am not sure I won't just keep using the box tempura mix.

I was really surprised with how much I like this. Given the ingredients I didn't expect much flavor, and it isn't "flavorful", but it definitely has a good flavor. I substituted rice vinegar for the wine and used gluten free all purpose flour.

Great tempura batter. Cooked up very nice and stayed on the shrimp! Light and not greasy tasting at all. Dry shrimp well and make sure everything is cold. I chilled water in the freezer for a bit and kept it in fridge between batches. I also used oil in place of shortening - I was out. I did not marinate the shrimp first since I wanted them as dry as possible. Can use pre-cooked shrimp if you are desperate since they only take a minute to cook. Used Asian Orange Chicken recipe from this site for the sauce - very good!

I didn't have shortening on hand and just used a tsp or so of sesame oil.  Also I just used "cold" water, forget the ice.  Hard to imagine how this could be improved.  Very good.

Living in Japan, I have tried a variety of tempura and this ranks up with some of the better dishes I've had.  This is my first attempt at making it, rather than just ordering it.  I also used one sweet potato sliced lengthwise and steamed beforehand.  My husband didn't speak the entire time because he was too busy eating.  I also made the tempura dipping sauce from this site which was just ok.  But, I'll use this recipe again in the future.  Maybe I'll upgrade to tiger prawns.

This was the first time I've ever made tempura and this recipe was easy and delicious.  I doubled the recipe so I could also add some vegetables and they turned out good as well.  Very yummy

Excellent! We made chicken nuggets instead of shrimp. Served it over rice with soy sauce, butter, green onions. Super scrummy. The chicken takes a bit longer than the shrimp recipe called for . I didn't know exactly how long to fry the chicken bits, so I kept taking one out and cutting it in half until it was cooked. Seemed like a long process, but totally worth it, will make it again and again. Thanks!

This is my go-to recipe for breading from now on.  I've looked for years for a batter that would match a tempura I had years ago at a renaissance faire, and this is it.  Even my local chinese restaurant can't tempura like I can at home now.  So far I have used this recipe on:  Veggies, thin pork cutlets, and shrimp.  It even goes into the freezer and reheats well in the oven for all of the above.  I never knew corn starch was the secret!

Wow, wow, and wow.  Did I say wow.  This recipe I tried for mothers day and my father actually ate up most of the shrimp.  This tasted like the tempura at any restaurant.  It was an excellent batter.  I soaked the shrimp as directed.  I also made two bowls of the batter so I used one to dip sweet potatoes and onions in.  Wow again.  It was fantastic.  This one is a keeper.

I love this batter! My wife has tryed tempura before and wasn't a fan, but she couldn't get enough of this. The only drawback to this recipie is that it makes very little batter. So make sure you use the serving conversion feature when looking at the recipie.

I made this the other night using the marinade for the shrimp along with the tempura batter and then did some veggies (mushrooms, onions, zucchini, red pepper, broccoli and greens beans) with just the batter alone (also thinned it out a bit).  I got rave reviews and the batter stayed crispy too.  Good recipe.

This is an excellent recipe for everything from shrimp to green tomatoes or dill pickle chips. I don't use the rice wine but do use the other ingredients and instructions as written no matter what I am frying. The combination of all-purpose flour and corn starch enable the batter to adhere to the item better than store bought tempura and the results are wonderful.

OMG!! This is such a great tempura recipe!!! i didnt have corn starch or shortening, i substituded for corn meal and butter and it STILL turned out amazing! I made onion rings with the recipe and dusted garlic salt when I took them out of the oil.  I made about 2-3 onions and in about...15-20 minutes, the plate was licked clean, my family ate them all, I think I only had a couple to taste.  Im making more as I type but I had to review it first!  Definitely a keeper!!!

This was a great recipe!  I did have to add about 1/4 cup additional water to the batter, but it's easy, and it's delicious!  My whole family loved this, including my 3 year old and 1 year old!

I used apple-grape juice instead of the rice-wine, and the flavor was good.  I give it two stars however, because the batter was messy even though I followed the recipe exactly for the batter-- thin, drippy, causing a mess in the hot oil.  A really annoying mess.

Delicious! So good that I created an allrecipes account so I could rate it. I didn't use shrimp, I used asparagus, carrot, frozen green beans, bell pepper, and even used the leftover batter to fry a mars bar and a banana! All were excellent, crispy, golden, perfect. And I've never been very good at frying. My fiance is already dreaming of having a "tempura party" and inviting our friends to bring things to fry.

I think this is a great batter.  I tried it on fresh perch fillets. They were like eating popcorn.  I recommend using more ice water to thin down the batter; otherwise everything was superb.

Don't forget to purchase sustainably caught seafood as ocean stocks are predicted to deplete by 2050 if everyone does nothing. Your children will thank you :). 

This recipe is delicious!  I paired it with homemade tempura sauce and it was soooo good. :D

I used the batter part of this recipe for vegetable tempura. The only thing I did differently was to use sesame oil in the place of shortening, because I didn't have any. I also used less oil. This was my first time making tempura, and it was absolutely delicious!

OK, I would have given this 5 stars, because my whole family loved the taste and flavor of the shrimp, and it was actually a great tasting recipie;  however, the only complaint I have is that the batter was not thick enough and I follwed the recipie exactly, but I doubled it.  In fact, the shrimp barely had any batter on them. If the batter was thicker, it would have been AWESOME!  Maybe next time when I make this, I wont add as much water.  Other than that, it did taste pretty darn good!

This recipe also works really well on vegetables (squash, broccoli, mushrooms). Gin is a good alternative to the rice wine, as well as replacing the shortening with butter.

The flavor seemed spot on to me and was super yummy. But the texture seemed a little off, and it went on particularly thick for the tempura that I'm used to. Not only that, but I'm also used to the batter cooking up much flakier. Granted it was my first try.

Aside from that, it was exceptionally delicious. I skipped the marinade but otherwise followed it to a T with the addition of lots of veggies, too. It was amazing on sweet potatoes and sugar snap peas!

Wonderful! The rice wine marinade really gave it an authentic flavor. I'll have to try this batter on veggies too; it was wonderfully light and crisp. A keeper for sure!

Great recipe!  I used this on fish w/o the marinade and it was fantastic.  Thick batter really colder water (I add ice cubes), and I may substitute olive oil for shortening next time.  I've been looking for a homemade tempura batter and this is it!

This is an excellent tempura recipe!  Like any batter recipes you have to adjust to each use (humidity etc. each day can vary how a batter turns out) This recipe is VERY close to what anyone needs to work from (often find needing to add just a touch more ice water) DO NOT OVER MIX.(using chopsticks are wonderful for preventing over-mixing)  Crisp, Light, Easy.  Thank you Sherry!

Based on reviews I doubled the recipe (made both shrimp and sweet potatoes) but didn't need to. I used a little less water than called for, and used sesame oil instead of shortening because I didn't have any. Made the mix a couple of hours ahead and refrigerated until I needed it, which kept everything cold. I dried my shrimp and veggies completely (no need for flour as some have said if you dry your food well) and the batter clung very well. There is not a lot of flavor to this batter, which is ok because the idea is to taste the veggies and the sauce. My only complaint is that the shrimp/veggies get cold very quickly, and as they did, the batter got soft. You literally have to eat this within a couple of minutes. I used some of it in sushi rolls and it was soggy by the time it made it to the plate. Not a bad recipe, but will try others before coming back to this one.

Okay, read the other reviews and it's not just me.  The recipe is really good but the batter didn't stick and was very messy.  I enjoyed it but will also use less water next time and see if that helps.

The batter was delicious, even my husband said so. And my dog really enjoyed licking the bowl. Apparently, peeling the shrimp is an important step, otherwise your dish will be very crunchy and hard to chew. Next time I won't "forget".

Used beer instead of rice wine and instead of ice water, I used the beer I marinated the shrimp in.

i do not add the shortening. I did try it with shortening one time and it was actually better without it.

Really excellent, basic recipe. I didn't marinatae at all - had no rice wine on hand and it came out perfect! Used size 15 to a pound shrimp and dried all water off before frying.

I used the batter from this recipe to make vegetable and shrimp tempura.  I substituted sesame oil for the shortening, and used whole eggs instead of the yolks only.  I had to double the recipe to get enough depth to cover my vegetables.  The dish was flavorful, although the batter was a little heavy and did not puff out around the shrimp like I was hoping.  Tasty, definitely, but I'm still looking for a batter recipe that will make the kind of tempura I had when I lived in Japan.

Great recipe. Didn't change a thing. Tried it with shrimp. Came out great. The family loved it. Crispy and delicious. Also tried with boneless chicken breast cut into small shrimp size strips. It came out great. Make sure the water is very cold. This is key to perfect tempura batter.

I added 50% extra water from the original recipe for great meats. 
I added 100% extra water from the original recipe for a very delicate and crispy coating for vegetables. 
Excellent recipe - versatile if you change amount of water.

This was very good...I doubled it because I had a lot of shrimp.  My daughter who usually has to be pushed to finish her dinner had seconds.

OK, round two.  It came out very different.  I don't think the difference was the flour.  I think it was the fact that I didn't add the ice water until right before I dipped/fried the shrimp.  However, I think the batter was too thick.  I'd like something in between the two.  Geez, do I need to take the temprature of the batter. 

Round One:  I made this last night and it seemed to be too light, not much crisp.  However, I'm going to try it again tonight and this time I will follow exactly as written (previously subbed in brown rice flour) and I'll dry the shrimp.

This is fine but use soda water instead of plain water.  You get more crispy batter.  Don't mix too much, you don't want to lose the bubbles in the soda.  Cornstarch is also the secret to making fried foods the crispiest.  Yams or sweet potatoes, mushrooms, onions, and eggplant are great fried this way.  This is one of my favorite kinds of Japanese food  along with beef or veggie curry and yakisoba.

I used refrigerated shortening, which stayed kind of lumpy when I whisked it. Next time, I think I'll warm the shortening so it blends better. Still made a tasty coating for our shrimp, which were delicious! Good recipe.

Awesome airy batter.....did not soak up any oil. Was a hit with my family. I also did not marinate it. Dried the shrimp with paper towels, sprinkle of garlic salt, coated with flour and then dipped in batter. Got better results from using my fingers to apply the batter on the shrimp rather than dipping it. Dipped shrimp was too heavy. Will make again!

Very good batter - crunchy ..  I did add a bit more water to reduce the thickness  ..  And a tiny bit more salt.. I used olive oil instead of shortening and I fried tilapia fillets - didn't marinate.

I made this recipe, but I didn't have some ingredients.  I didn't have eggs, so I substituted 1 TBSP white vinegar and 1 TSP baking soda.  I also didn't have rice wine, so I substituted chardonnay.  After dipping the shrimp in the batter, I dipped them in panko bread crumbs.  I served with sweet and sour sauce.  They were fantastic!  The panko bread crumbs made them so crunchy!

Way too heavy to be called a tempura batter.  My oil was very hot, shrimp were dried and they still turned out tough and doughy with a weird sweet taste.  I thought I had made a mistake with my measurements, but I double checked and it was correct.  I will try another recipe next time.
