Absolutely the MOST FANTASTIC chili!  I serve it every other Friday night when my husband and I entertain 8 very hungry, very chili-loving guys.  I have never cooked a better chili recipe - not even when experimenting with chocolate or beer.  Spicy and very flavorful.  Adding beans lends good texture and good nutrition without changing the flavor.

PS - The best way to make it is to marinate the meat overnight for at least 12 hours, then saute the meat in the morning.  Word to the wise - use 2 saute pans simultaneously to cut down on the time you are standing over the stove.  Put all the ingredients into a crock pot and simmer all day in on low.

Fantastic recipe! I actually won a chili cook-off using this one. Be sure to only use the amount of peppers you're comfortable with.

FANTASTIC!!  Never made anything but a ground chuck chili before and now i'll never use ground chuck again.  This was outstanding.  Not too spicy...just a little kick.  The key is letting the meat marinade overnight in all those spices.  The only change I made was to cook it in my crockpot.  Cooked for 6 hours and the meat was so tender it just fell apart so it was almost shredded.  Made alot so I gave some away to family and friends who are raving about it!  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was made for my Murder Mystery.  Everyone absolutely loved it.  I bought ground beef sirloin and ground pork instead of the chunks and it came out perfect!  I also substituted bottled chopped jalapeno pepper instead of fresh to save time and it came out just as good.  Keep adding more if you like it really spicy.  We didn't try it with ice cream.  Next time I make it (and it will become my chili dish to make from now on) I will add some shredded cheese to each serving and a dollop of sour cream for the finishing touch.

This was a good chili.  I was expecting something more with all the rave reviews but wasn't blown off my feet (perhaps my expectations are the problem? ; ) ).  Still, we'll eat it again and enjoy it.  We did reduce the spicy spices so the kids could eat it too - 1 tsp of chili powder and 1/2 tsp of cayenne in the marinade rub and then just the jalapeno in the chili itself.  Still had heat but didn't burn.

Awesome is all I can say about this chili! I made it for a pot luck and work and left with an empty bowl. I added two large cans of pinto beans since I didn't have time to cook my own, which worked out well. I was also in a pinch on jalapenos, so I used the canned tomato/jalapeno combination. It was good for everyone. Next time I will make the time to use fresh chiles, but hey, in a pinch the canned stuff works too.

Yes! Thank you! I was looking for a chili without ground beef.  This is excellent.  I let the prepared rubbed meat sit for a day in refrigerator.  I reduced the spice because the "Red Death" title scared me for a family meal but would not do that again.  I cooked in a slow cooker for 9 hours (followed recipe up until the point of simmering). Melt-in-mouth tender.   I added black and pinto beans at very end.  Note: it was soupy and one of my sons likes a thick chili - so I will work on that  next time.  I did not drain the tomatoes and maybe that is why.

My husband makes this chili...he always says "real chili doesn't have beans or ground beef in it!" I personally like the beans and beef. But this is a nice change from my normal chili (could be a little spicier though). Definitely like the rub for the meat...will use that elsewhere. Thanks for sharing!

This made a HUGE pot of chili (I also added 4 cans of pinto beans and 1 can of black beans 40 min. before end of cooking time) that I took to my family potluck. I was worried about having lots of leftovers since we also had turkey, chicken, steaks, and numerous side dishes... to my delight, by the end of the potluck everyone was raving about the chili, and there was less than one small bowl left in the bottom of the pot! Thanks so much for this unbelieveably tasty recipie. From now on, this is definitely my chili of choice :)

A Great Chili Recipie! 
My family LOVED it the first night but they really enjoyed themselves when we finished the left overs later in the week. The seasonings get a chance to really bring out the best in the chili. I would recommend fixing this dish but actually serving it later in the week. Now that its Fall my family is looking forward to Red Death Chili :n)

This is good chili, but it's not hot.  I used 3 jalapenos and 1 habanero.  After making exactly as the recipe calls for, I added six cans of kidney beans because chili to me is with beans! Then more jalapenos and 2 more haberanos along with more chili powder and now there's some spice!

This is THE best chili I have ever made or eaten!  This is going to be a family standard in the winter.  It is pretty spicy and we liked that.

Thanks for sharing!

I finished preparing this chili yesterday. It was difficult with a house full of little children. I hoped that all that prep was worth it. Since this dish would be served to little ones, I had to eliminate some of the spiciness. Could that have such an effect on the taste? The chili was good but not fabulous after simmering on low in a crockpot. However, now that it has spent it's night in the fridge, the family is going crazy! Even my 1 year old is eating it! Yes, it passed the kid test and earned five stars. We are eating it with our Fritos, cheddar cheese and a football game. It was defintately worth the prep time and I'm sure to make it again.

A great chili recipe. I omitted the bacon grease and Salsa, used some canned tomatoes with extra peppers as I did not have these ingredients on hand. Lefotvers froze nicely in ziploc bags and were eaten within a month. The rub is great and I use that spice combo for anything that calls for southwest seasonings as well as for a fajita rub I then top with garlic, lime juice, cilantro and shallots. It is my favorite fajita marinade. Very nice recipe and general rub. It is very spicy (in a good way).

This chili is excellent! The only change I made was using a small can of jalopenos chopped up and I also added a can of kidney beans and a can of black beans as well. I made it a few months ago for a Grey Cup Party and the whole pot was devoured with many compliments(and here I was hoping for leftovers for lunch the next day) I'm actually going to make it again today to take on a ski trip.

I'm not really into super hot stuff so I didn't add the jalapenos. That could be why I didn't think it was as good as everyone else. I was looking for a beanless chili and thought I'd try this one; it definitely was not worth the time and effort it took to put together-thanks anyway.

This is definately better the next day.  The heat in this varies on what type of salsa that you use, and how many peppers that you put in (I used serrano's and jalapeno's and it still wasn't hot).  My husband didn't care for it as much as I thought that he would (said it looked like dog food), but again, he didn't try it the next day.  I added quite a bit more chili powder and cumin to get the taste that we are used to, but didn't need the ice cream.  Thanks jibefan!

Excellent, but definately a make ahead meal. So much better the next day.  I would add beans as well, either kidney or black beans.  Maybe some corn too.

Great Chili, I added 2 cans of black beans and 2 cans of red beans, because it's not chili without beans (according to my husband).  Also, I cut back on the jalapenos a bit, since I'm wimpy.

The best!  First batch was made with venison and was to die for good. Used 12 large fresh jalepenos and for this second batch replaced some of my spices which had faded flavor from too long on the shelf. Great as first batch was the fresher spices are an improving factor. Use a HOT salsa and all of the cayenne and chili powder called for. It will be spicy but not overly so. I also "chopped" the onions in a food processor almost to the point of juicing ... I think that helps distribute flavor especially after a couple days of storage. Bag it in 2 serving portions, freeze and heat in the microwave. Great way for a one person household to eat well without a lot of fussing in the kitchen.

I followed the recipe almost exactly (I added kidney beans) and this was a very good chili but something kept nagging at me that there was something missing.  The boy gave it a 5, I give it a 4 because I think it needs more spices in the chili itself, not just on the meat.  Will make again for sure!

I scaled this in half and added beans but other than that made the recipe as is. This isn't extremely hot on contact but it has a way of catching up to you. The meat really holds on to its dry marinade and I'm guessing that is where the heat comes in. The one complaint I have is that it is entirely too salty. Leave out the salt altogether. The pork seemed to dominate the beef so next time I will cut back on it and use more beef. All in all great recipe and one I will make again with minor tweaks.

My whole family loves this!  Great combination of flavors.  I do halve the cayenne because my daughter can't handle tons of heat.  I added beans to it one time (I know...real chili doesn't have beans) and that was really good too.  And of course, we always have ice cream for dessert!  It IS part of the recipe.

My husband won 1st Place in our local Chili cookoff this past weekend with this recipe! We think the key is to use all country-style rib meat (pork & beef). We also added 2 cans of pinto beans. Yummy!

This was VERY good!  I toned down the spiciness, because I was giving my 82 year old Dad some,too.  I used canned jalopeno sauce (tomato based) instead of fresh ones, and cut the chili seasoning in half.  It was still spicy, but really, really good.  A little grated cheese on top, and a lime juice bar afterwards was perfect to cool off my mouth!!
