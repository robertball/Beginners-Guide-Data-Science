Very, very good. I also used the whole box of spinach. For those of you who tried onion soup & didn't like it, try leek. It's milder. Knorr's makes it, and it's usually in the same place where you find onion soup, ramen, etc.

this is an easy and wonderful recipe and I hae been using it for years.  It is often ruined by newcomers as they use whipped dressing (Miracle Whip type) instead of MAYONNAISE (Hellman's type).  Makes a big difference -- use mayo!

I printed this recipe ages ago, but never had the need for the dip until recently.  BOY am I glad I made it!  I have now taken it to two parties and have been asked for the recipe by so many people.  They are surprised at how easy it is.  The leek soup mix is the key ingredient, and tastes so much better than the vegetable (IMHO). I used a full 10 oz. package of spinach (it needs it for texture), and I doubled the recipe.  It works best if you squeeze as much liquid out of the spinach as you can.  If not it could turn out too runny. Overall, it's quick, easy, delicious, and will become a staple in my entertaining!

I made this recipe for a job that I was catering and multiplied the recipe times three. But doing it just for one it just as good. This got rave reviews. I used only 3/4 cup mayonnaise and the whole package of spinach. I usually let the spinach thaw completely and then wring it out in a kitchen towel. The leek soup mix is the key to it. It taste so much better then the Knorr Vegetable soup mix. I would definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing.

This dip is excellent! I got many compliments that it was indeed the best spinach dip they ever had. I did make some substitutions though. Instead of the leek soup mix,I used:
1 large (or 2 small) garlic cloves, minced
1/4 onion, chopped fine
approx. 1 1/4 Tablespoons Janes Original Mixed-Up Salt (or to taste)
Also, I used an entire 10 ounce package of frozen spinach. I think it needs the extra spinach to have some in every bite. 

It turned out fantastic. Several people even asked me for the recipe. This will definitely be filed in my 'Quick Party Dips' section.

This is a winner every time.  I use light versions of everything I can and it always turns out awesome.  I find that veggie soup and leek soup are interchangeable and both are always a hit with the "grazers".  I also serve triscuits (or you might try any other sturdy large-ish crackers you like) to use when the bread is gone.  I've also added chunky chopped artichokes to the recipe instead of the water chestnuts with good success.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is so easy - and the taste is amazing!!  I used a whole package of spinach instead of the half a package and divided the dip between a loaf of sourdough and a loaf of pumpernickel.

Great base recipe, but neeeeds these changes to be 5-star (for my taste buds anyway)  I prefer a thick, spinachy (if you will) dip as opposed to a mayo taste.  I used 2 1/4 cup sour cream, 3/4 cup mayo, a 250g tub of herb & garlic cream cheese (softened), 3 packages (900g) spinach (be sure to fully defrost and squeeze ALL the water out), added about 6 cloves raw garlic (I love garlic.. it gives it all the flavor), a small diced red pepper, a small diced onion (sauteed them both a little first) and used a pack of Knoors cream of leek dry soup.  I also almost doubled the water chestnuts.  It was so creamy and full of health with all the extra veggies!  Also used low-fat everything.... it was delicious and easy!!  Served with sourdough and baked garlic pita slices, it didn't last long.

This was a very good spinach dip but you really need the whole box of spinach.  I have always made the spinach dip on the back of the Knorr Vegatable soup mix box and it is very good also.  I really can't decide which is better.  They are very similar and both very good.  My 5 year old ate this one right up and it was devoured at a party last night.

Absolutely wonderful! And I'm not a big fan of sour cream or mayonnaise, but this is great! I just couldn't find leek soup mix, so I used a packet of Knorr's veg. mix & added about 1/3 of an onion soup mix packet. Used the whole box of spinach & served with pumpernickel.

Yep, best ever! This was my moms go to spinach dip recipe for years, though she used Knorr's Spring vegetable soup mix. I had to try the leek and am glad I did! Sooo good. I did double the recipe, planning on using the entire box of spinach of course, so I used two to double the recipe. I did notice that the full two cups of mayo and two containers of sour cream looked like it was gonna be way too much amd possibly make it runny, so before mixing I removed about a half cup mayo and a cup of sour cream. I just finished mixing it all up and it's getting happy in the fridge. I will update if it turns out too dry and I have to add back the mayo and sour cream. But boy did it taste GOOD! 
Thanks Shawna's Dad! ***Update! next morning, all is well. And tasty! Thankfully the amounts were perfect. So for those of you doubling the recipe like I did, cut down a little on the mayo and sour cream. 1 3/4 cup mayo and 1 1/2 containers of sour cream should do the trick. Everything else remains, 2 packs of Knorrs leek soup mix, 2 cans waterchestnuts and 2 10 oz. boxes of chopped spinach. I only serve this dip with Kings Hawaiian Bread. OMG! They were meant to go together, try it, you won't be sorry!

Delicious. Have made the recipe many times. To squeeze the spinach dry, I let it defrost pretty much completely and then I put it in a SALAD SPINNER. It works wonders and isn't as messy!!!

Five start recipe with one addition - must add freshly chopped green onions! I would recommend using at least 3 - I use 6 or 7.  Also - must use Knorr Leek Soup for best taste!  I use whole box of spinach and be sure to squeeze all moisture from spinach.  After I squeeze dry, I do rough chop, then use hands to separate and "loosen" the spinach so that it incorporates into the dip better.  I serve with round loaf of pumpernickel bread - also good with vegies and triscuit thins.

I followed the directions to the letter and used the Knorr Leek Soup Mix.  The water chestnuts gave it a nice crunch however all I tasted was onion dip.  Served in a nice bread bowl too ($4.00 for a bowl).  I don't remember this tasting this much like a traditional onion dip.  Nobody ate it at my party.

Amazing! Couldn't find leak soup mix even in specialty stores (other than cream of leak) so I used onion soup mix. I used 2 pumpernickel breads (1 to hollow out for the dip & the other for extra cubes. Next time, I'll add some cut-up sour dough baguettes for a colour contrast. Leave 1.5" of bread attached to the lid & cut up with crust attached. Make dip day before or dried onions will be too crunchy & ingredients won't marry. Use full 10 oz. box of frozen spinach. Remove spinach from box & if in a hurry, defrost in a bowl of cool water, strain, then squeeeeeeze dry. Hollow out bread bowl the day before but don't put dip inside until just before serving, to prevent sogginess. Served this at my 1st. grandchild's baby shower & there was none left. This is my families permanent recipe! Thanks Shawna.

This spinach dip is very good - I will add it to my favorite recipes, and use it for gatherings/parties that I have.  I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the spinach.  I used frozen spinach, let it thaw (which took forever), and then squeezed all the excess water out.  I followed the rest of the directions as written.  I cut the center of a sourdough round out and put the dip in that, I also cut up a extra round w/ the second round - the amount of bread seemed to be perfect for the amount of dip. I don't think just one would have been enough.

Update - I actually prefer the vegetable packet over the Leek or onion; when I make this with the vegetable I just add a 16 oz. container of sourcream, 1 C. of mayo, 1 package of spinach (thawed, and drained in salad spinner), and the vegetable packet - everyone loves it and I always get requests for the recipe.

Just save yourself and the other party goers the disappointment and make two of these. I took it to a meeting with 7 woman and they didn't even pay attention to the other food. I should also mention that it was a meeting on a nurses unit and it was 10:30 am. I wouldnt have thought it would go so early, but it sure did!

I probably really shouldn't be rating this recipe because I only took bits and pieces from it, but oh well.  I use 1 cup of mayo, 16 oz. sour cream, a package of Knorr's vegetable soup mix, omit the water chestnuts, use a 10 oz. package of frozen chopped spinach, and then I use a round loaf of Hawaiian bread.  Everyone loves the recipe and I get asked to bring it to occasions frequently.  It's a staple at all of my parties, and it's usually always devoured by the end of the night.  It's the best spinach dip ever, and it's great because it can be made days ahead of time and stored in a Tupperware container.  Then the day of, hollow out the bread, add the dip to the middle, and cut up the leftover middle part of the bread into cubes and stick them on top of the dip.

I personally add all the spinach, plus chopped green onions and red bell pepper.  The water chesnuts add a nice crunch.  Plus 2 hours of refrigerator time is plenty if you are in a crunch.

This really is the "best spinach dip ever!"  I've used this recipe for years.  I use Knorr Leek Soup mix, a tall container of sour cream and I also chop the water chestnuts so that everyone gets them in their scoop.  I also put it into a hollowed out Hawaiian bread bowl, and I buy an extra thing of Hawaiian bread to cut up.  The sweetness of the Hawaiian bread pairs perfectly with this dip!!

This dip was truly heavenly! I made it for my mom on Mother's Day. She loves spinach dip and has always purchased the store made ones. Well, after having eaten this dip, she'll never buy store made again. I am glad that I found this recipe because all of the other ones that I looked up called for either vegetable or onion soup mix. I personally wouldn't want to add either of those. I think it would just add the wrong flavor. The leek soup was perfect. Like most of the reviewers before me, I also used the entire 10 ounce package of spinach. Instead of serving it with pieces of bread, I served it with roasted vegetable and sociable crackers. This dip was yummy and so fresh tasting. I will "definitely" be making this again and again!

I've taken this to 3 baby showers at work and have gained a fan base with this recipe. Everyone wants copies of the recipe when I bring this so I take printed out recipes to pass around. It's a hit!  The only thing that I do differently is I use fresh spinach. It makes a huge difference. Since it's gonna be gone after every party, I don't have to worry about saving it. Everyone says it's "the best spinach dip" they've ever had. Thanks for sharing.

I personally always add the full 10-12 oz package of spinach and the whole 8 oz can of water chestnuts. I also add a can of chopped artichoke hearts, some minced garlic, and some grated parmesan cheese. The mayo does add good flavor, but I usually leave it out and just use 16 oz of fat free sour cream. That way I don't feel as guilty eating it all because it's delicious! If you want a hot dip, it's also very good baked.

This was D-LISH

Served it with a smaller Rye Round and it was a BIG hit.....

I bought the diced Water Chestnuts thinking they would be the perfect size....They weren't.   I recommend buying the whole and dicing them from that point.  **I also used a WHOLE package of spinach, 1/2 just wasn't enough.  When you hollow out the bread, get as close as you can to make it a shell 1/2 inch or so, and I find slicing the bread up into smaller pieces makes it last a little longer. 
(one inch cubes)  The dip should fill the bowl perfectly....Also refrigerates well when stored in a Ziploc, bowl and all.

Merry Christmas!!!

I rated this recipe last year with only 4 stars. At that time I was turned off by the idea of the water chestnuts so I left them out. I made this again last week for a party and this time I included the chopped water chestnuts. I also added a little extra mayo and chopped onion. Even thought the water chestnuts really add nothing to the flavor, the extra crunch really does make a difference. This dip was the hit of the party so I'm back to up my rating to 5 stars.

Best and easiest Spinach Dip!  I used the whole box of spinach, (the spinach has to be squeezed dry.)  The leek soup mix is a nice change from onion soup mix - milder flavor and not as salty.  Great recipe Shawna!

I have tried this but I used the recipe on the back of the Knorr package. It is found in the soup section in the store. I bought a round Hawaiian bread, carved out the center to make a bowl and then spooned the dip inside of it. Everyone loves it. So good!!

EXCELLENT!  THE BEST SPINACH DIP YOU CAN MAKE!  I normally make this without the water chestnuts.  Definitely must use the Leek Soup Mix.  I've tried it with the Vegetable Mix and there is a noticable difference in flavor.  I actually made this again last night for a party and everyone who had it raved about it being the greatest..  I even wrote the recipe for a friend... that is how easy it is to make!  Love it!

The only thing i do different to mine is I add one green onion chopped.  If you cant find the Knorr Leek soup use the Knorr Vegetable soup.

Absolutely out of this world.  I was hesitant about the dry leek soup mix but it adds a different flavor then the usual spinach dip that makes it stand out.  To add a little color, suggest adding a little chopped red bell pepper or pimento.

My mom made a similar recipe when I was a kid & served it in the middle of a loaf of King's Hawaiian bread (after you cut out a hole).  I made this recipe the other week for a fimaily function and everyone loved it!  My husband who claimed that he never really like spinach dip ended up eating half of it!  I think it really must be the "best spinach dip ever!"

Very Good! I followed the recipe exacly and took it to a New Year's party and it was the crowd favorite. I thought it had too much mayo/sour cream- even with the full package of spinach it was soupy. Next time I will use 3/4 c. mayo and 3/4 pkg. sour cream. I also added some spices to put a little more flavor in it, garlic powder, pepper, etc. I will make this again!

As the recipe is written, you might as well just eat mayo and sourcream out of the jar.  The modifications I made to it would bring it to 4 1/2 or 5 stars.  Up the spinach to 2 packages of frozen chopped spinach, up the water chestnuts to a full 8 oz can, and decrease the sour cream to 1 8 oz container. I kepts all other ingrediants the same. I also added 1 bunch of green onions.  Like others said, the Leek soup is the key to this recipe vs others. AWESOME!!

Delicious! Like many reviewers suggested, I doubled the amount of spianch which seemed to be the perfect amount. I think that the dry leek soup mix is what "makes" this recipe. I would really advise against substituting it!

great recipe...have tried lightening it up with light mayo and sour cream. light mayo and light sour cream maintain a good consistency, but fat free sour cream makes it a bit runny. yum!

Excellent recipe!!!  This dip practically disappeared in a flash at my party.  This is by far the best spinach dip i have ever tasted.  I used low fat mayo, and it was just as delicious.

It was good and easy to make which is why I gave it 4 stars, but to be honest, I've had better.  I felt that it lacked flavor. Will probably look for a different recipe.

This is the best spinach dip ever! I was in the middle of making it and realized I didn't have the soup mix so I had no choice but to improvise.  All I did in place of the soup mix was add a bit of garlic powder and onion powder (I think).  It still turned out amazing! My mother in law who has hated me forever even loved it and complimented me on the dip!

I make this for every gathering we have. I double everything of course to make a large batch and it gets eaten enthusiastically every time. There is only one market in town I can find LEEK soup at but it's worth the trip. The only change I make is doubling the spinach (so I use 20oz in my doubled batch) but that is suited to taste. If i'm unsure of my recipients i'll leave it at the half package because it's just creamy goodness and wont offend anyone with excessive greenery :)

This was a big hit at a gathering I had to attend.  I used the entire package of spinach to add more substance.  I had to substitute the leek soup mix for Knorr Vegetable Recipe Mix and added a tsp of garlic powder.  It was awesome!

Delicious!  Everyone loved it.  Had to make another batch a week later and had to use the spring veggie soup instead and it was ok, but not amazing as with the leek soup mix.  USE LEEK SOUP MIX!  Used a whole package of spinach and glad I did.  Added a wee bit of chopped garlic and this is a divine recipe!  Thanks so much for the original recipe and thanks to all those that review  and post helpful hints!  I appreciate you all and your help!

Totally easy to make and tastes wonderful! Not sure if I've ever made spinach dip before. I sure will now though! I did, however, use the whole 10 oz box of spinach instead of just half. Will be doing this one again!

Good if you use the whole box of spinach like others suggested.  No complaints.

But I wanted it great and I love spinach, so I added a second box of spinach, 1/2 packet Knorr Vegetable Soup Mix, some Aleppo Pepper, a small jar of diced pimentos, and a few more water chestnuts.  I had to add a little more sour cream and mayo to get the right consistency.  It was great!  DH hates chestnuts, though, so next time I will chop up carrots for the texture. Oh, I used light sour cream but regular mayo (hate light mayo).

Thanks for the recipe!

A big hit at a recent neighborhood party! Definitely add all the spinach. I also mixed in 1 cup plain, low-fat yogurt to tone down the mayo taste. Served it with crisp pita chips instead of the sourdough bread bowl.

I needed to make a spinach dip for our monthly teacher appreciation party; not one for dips--or anything laden with sour cream or mayo--I turned to allrecipes for some help.    Unfortunately, this is not the "Best Spinach Dip Ever".  The recipe, when followed to the letter, yields a dip that tastes more of sour cream and mayo with a little spinach garnish.  Luckily, I had more spinach on hand, but even the extra spinach could not cut down on the overpowering sour cream and mayo flavors.  Perhaps that is the intention, but I have tasted store bought spinach dip that greatly trumps this one.    If you are looking for a spinach dip that is heavy on the sour cream and mayo flavors and lacking in any others, this is the dip for you.  Otherwise, I would try one of the modified versions or another recipe altogether.

I've brought this exact recipe to every holiday get together for years.... "don't come without it" basically.  DO NOT use vegetable soup mix OR lipton onion soup mix...the leek soup IS the difference.  Walmart does not carry it...try Scolaris, Raley's or Savemart.  Try to make it the night before so that the dehydrated leeks are reconstituted, not crunchy..and the powdered soup will incorporate to be nice & creamy.  Guests will hover & your offering will be gone first.  :o)

This is a great recipe! I used knorrs vegetable dip mix instead of spinach and it turned out fantastic. I also used the whole package plus extra spinach, because we like a lot of spinach.
I used 8 oz of water chestnuts also. Everyone raved about it!

No. It isn't the "best ever." It's good, but very mayonaise-y. Very, very mayonaise-y. If you dig that flavor, you'll dig this recipe. It's not my cup of tea, though.

This dip is my family's favorite!  I usually double the recipe and use light mayo and light sour cream (helps cut back the fat) and eliminate the water chestnuts.  At every family get together, everyone is eager to start dipping!  THANK YOU FOR A GREAT RECIPE!

Delish!  I almost omitted the water chestnuts, and I'm so glad that I didn't--they added a wonderful crunch.  The recipe makes a lot, next time I'll make a half batch.

This is our go to recipe. It's requested all the time, all occasions . We use the Knorr Dry Vegetable Soup Mix. The vegetables make it pop and so fresh. We use chopped fresh spinach for  a fresher slightly crunch.

I recently made this spinach dip because we had company in town and I wanted a nice happy hour snack for everyone (my first attempt at ever making spinach dip) and it was wonderful.  I followed the recipe as is - but maybe added a bit more spinach - and everyone loved it.  I'm not a big spinach fan myself but have to admit that I really enjoyed this dip.  I will definitely make it again and would not alter the recipe - it is great the way it is!

This was hit at my daughter's birthday party for the adults!  I used Knorr Vegetable Soup mix because I couldn't find leek soup mix and it turned out perfectly!  You can't use onion soup mix with this recipe, the flavor is just too overpowering as I learned the first time I made this.  It's worth getting all the ingredients ahead of time.

Lower-fat variations:  Olive oil mayo & tofu sour cream.  Still delicious.  I also use Knorr's vegetable soup mix instead of onion.  I garnish with chives. I also use whole spinach package.

Don't make the mistake I made once and used Miracle Whip as I had no mayo.  Does NOT work!

Love this dip!  I clicked over to see if there was a better spinach dip than my favorite - and it was the same recipe!

I have been making this spinach dip for years...except we use the Knorr Vegetable Soup mix, not Leek soup mix.  Make sure you use Best Foods' mayo, and chop your water chestnuts up (drained of course) and let it sit for a  couple hours!!! It has to have time for the dry mix to rehydrate & flavors to meld.  It is always a hit

I couldn't find any dry leek soup so I used dry vegetable and a little onion soup mix (about a teaspoon)instead. I used an entire 10 ounce package of spinach and tossed in some fresh finely diced tomato - just a little for color. I have never made a spinach dip in my life and everyone loved it! The water chestnuts gave it just the crunch it needed. I served it with tortilla chips but people liked it so much they were putting little piles of it on their plate and eating it like a side dish instead of a dip! I will be using this recipe again - hopefully I'll get my hands on some dry leek soup so I can compare the difference, they just don't seem to carry it in my area.

I made this take to a birthday/St. Patty’s Day party in a homemade sourdough bowl with a second loaf cut up for dippers. After the dip and dippers were gone, people hovered around like vultures waiting to grab the remains of the bowl while I cut down the sides into strips with a knife. Mind you, there were numerous other appetizers still left on the counter. I've had a few spinach dips in my day, and would say this is among the nicest. I must admit that I always use plain yogurt in place of the sour cream, so I apologize that I'm rating it not exactly as written, but I think I'm really commenting on the subtle change from the usual onion or veggie soup mix to the leek soup. It is mild, but very nice. Oh, near forgot...yes, full 10 oz. of spinach. I really feel the poster meant to say 1/2 of a 20 oz. bag., which is 10 oz.

Hi, my family has been making this recipe for many years. Only difference - we use dry vegetable soup rather than leek.  And of course let is sit overnight, always better the next day!

very similar to the one I make all the time, but I use cream cheese instead of sour cream and Knorr vegetable soup instead of the leek.  I grind the soup mix up so it dissolves better.  I use a whole package of spinach.  Super yummy and I have people requesting the dip over and over.

Quick & Easy! I had added the entire package of spinach instead of 1/2 and it turned out great. Everyone loved it. Prefect for company parties, family events. Just make the night before and it's great! Very good Recipe! It was gone within minutes.

this spinach dip was amazing! the only thing I did different was followed other reviewers' suggestions and used the whole package of spinach. I also made sure to squeeze out all the liquid first.

8/8/2011 - I was debating between making this and my old standy from the vegetable soup package. I am so glad I tried this one. This is my new favorite! I love the mild flavor of the the leek soup in this! I used light mayo, an 8 oz. can of water chestnuts and the whole 10 oz. pkg. of spinach. It was awesome!! I think I may try using light sour cream next time - I am sure it would be just as awesome and I won't feel as guilty eating it. Thanks so much for a delicious dip recipe I will be sure to use again and again (as long as the soup mix is available in my area)!

This was very good!  I actually added 16oz of well drained (pressed water out with a paper towel) spinach.  It came in a 16oz bag and I didn't want to waste 6oz of it.

What a fantastic dip! I've enjoyed a few recipes of spinach dip over the years, but this is the best I have ever tasted.  Although I was a little hesitant to use leek soup mix over the standard vegetable soup mix called for in most recipes, I plowed through and just went for it.  And so glad I did - the end result is a creamy, non-bitey flavour that went over far better than I ever expected.  I don't think I'll use any other spinach dip recipe again!  Also, definitely use mayonnaise (Hellman's) and not the miracle whips of the world, as it really does make a huge difference.  Such a tasty dip - you've got to try it . . . !!

friend 1 - "Who made the spinach dip?"   friend 2 - "Who made the spinach dip?"  friend 3++ - "Who made the spinach dip?"  me - "I made it, got the recipe online."    So YOUR Spinach Dip was a total hit at our Super Bowl party!!!  Everyone loved the dip.  I was suprised.    I used LITE Sour Cream & Best Foods LITE Mayonnaise & bought an Extra sourdough bread loaf for more dipping bread.   ---THANK YOU SHAWNA for sharing this recipe.

Got rave reviews from guests at a New Year's Eve party.  Didn't change a thing, other than to buy an extra loaf of bread to be sure we had plenty!

This is a staple at family get-togethers!  I like to use a 16oz pkg of chopped spinach and definately the leek soup.  I also sprinkle in a couple dashes of seasoned salt.  This is best when made up the night before.  We serve with cubed hawaiian bread and never have any leftovers.

This is the only one I make for my family... But the thing this recipe is missing is the 3 green onions... it needs it.
I made it once with the spinach soup mix and every one asked what happened to the dip... and they wouldnt eat it! haha
Make sure you only use the Knorr's leek soup to make it have that 'specific' taste. Also, make sure you squeeze that spinach out really good... some folks complain about the fact it gets watery... that will help it.
And be sure it has time, at least 3 hours, to make the leeks soften and all ingredients to marry... YUM!

I used an entire package of spinach when I made this.  I also left out the water chestnuts based on personal preference and to save a few calories I used light sour cream and mayo.  No one seemed to notice the difference - the bowl was empty.   This was a hit at the family Labor Day get-together.

I used a whole box of spinach and the key is to make sure that it is well drained otherwise it makes the dip too runny.  I prefer the Knorr's Leek Dip but my sister doesn't like the oniony flavor so she uses vegetable dip.  I have used Miracle Whip and it was terrible--the taste was off.  I have used low or reduced fat mayo and that's the key to success.  The water chestnuts give the dip a nice crunch.  I have made this dip several times and love it.  A definite keeper!!!!!!!!!

Delicious!  Leek soup mix gave it a different, but good taste!  Used light sour cream & light mayo to cut down on fat a bit.  Didn't make w/ bread bowl - used multi-grain crackers & chunks of pumpernickel to dip in it.

Really is the BEST!!  I've made it 3 times at 3 different parties and I always come home with an empty platter! Did try to make it once using French Onion Soup Mix - DON'T - Use only Leek Soup Mix, really makes the dip!! My name says it all and I will make this again!!

Well, I had to use the veggie seasoning instead of leek, because my grocery store didn't have leek, but the recipe was still a success. I doubled this recipe for a work event and everyone loved it. (Although doubling the recipe is not necessary! I fed everyone for 2 days instead of 1 by making double.)

I forgot to add that I added the entire box of spinach, rather than half. In my opinion, there wasn't enough spinach with just half of the box.

This dip was so simple to make, and sooo good. I used light mayonaise and light sour cream, but it was still very tasty.  I also used the full 10 oz package of spinach, and it ended up being the perfect amount!

Wonderful recipe!!!  I've made this 4 or 5 times now, and EVERYONE loves it, even my friend who hates mayonnaise.  If I have some left over (which is rare), it makes a nice sandwich spread on sourdough or rye bread.  I usually put in a bit extra spinach and sometimes extra water chestnuts for a chunkier dip.  LOVE IT!

The best. Absolutly beats the one where you use the veggie dip mix. Make sure you squeeze as much water from spinach as possible.

This recipe was FANTASTIC.  We bought a round sourdough loaf from Panera bread and hollowed out a bit of the middle.  We also bought another loaf to cut up for dipping.  It was PERFECT.  Thanks very much for a great recipe.

This is a good basic recipe but if you really want some slamming flavor, use vegetable soup and be sure to squeeze all the water out of the thawed spinach. Add a bunch of chopped green onions. Then you'd better double your recipe, because you're going to need it!

I love this recipe. Use it all the time except I use Knorr's brand Veggie dip mix envelope instead of the leak soup mix.  I'm sure any/all types of additives would be great too.  I add water chestnuts to taste as too much some people don't like, but the added crunch really makes it !

This was amazing! The only changes I made were using ~11-12 oz of thawed chopped spinach, an 8 oz can of water chestnuts, and dry onion soup mix (store didn't have leek). Everyone who has tried it has raved about it. The most common question being "where is this dip from?", and being amazed when I told them it was homemade. Definitely a keeper, thanks for the great recipe!

I have made this often but I use the Knorr Vegetable Soup mix.  It is much better & you can also add artichokes to change it up.  But it is a very good dip & I make it often.

Very good! I love spinach dip and have always made it with Knorr vegetable mix but using the leek soup mix was equally delicious! Other than using the whole package of spinach, I made no significant changes. My only regret is not serving this the traditional way, in a Hawaiian bread bowl. Although the sourdough was tasty, I really missed the Hawaiian bread. :( My Thanksgiving guests didn't seem to mind, so I guess it's really a matter of personal preference. If you're crunched for time, give this quick appetizer a try. I promise, no one will be disappointed! :-)

This is exactly how I have been making my spinach dip for years!  The leek soup mix is the key.  I also chop the chopped spinach up more while it's still frozen before I add to the mixture (so you don't get big pieces of spinach in your dip).  Chop up the water chestnuts into very small pieces before you add.  This is a very simple recipe, easy to make and it's ready to eat as soon as you mix it all up (although, it does taste a little better when it's had time to sit).  All of my friends LOVE it, say it's the best dip they've ever had and are constantly asking for the recipe.  Highly recommended!

Our family and friends can't agree more- this recipe does indeed provide the foundation for the Best Spinach Dip Ever!  We used to frequent a very well known specialty cheese shop in our area that had been in business for over 50 years that made an outstanding and almost addictive spinach dip.  When the store closed, I searched in vain for an acceptable substitute.  When I came across this recipe, I thought I'd give it a whirl and see how close it came to replicating the one from our beloved cheese shop.  To our thrill, with extremely minor adjustment, this is it!!  The key to this recipe is to be sure to dry the spinach as much as possible- I use paper towels.  Moreover, using the entire box of spinach is imperative.  Beyond that, the recipe yields an OUTSTANDING spinach dip.  I serve it with  sliced baguettes and bread from the hollowed out round pumpernickel loaf in which I present it.   Thanks so much for helping us re-create the spinach dip we thought was gone forever and a recipe that is requested over and over again!

This a great recipe!  I used the onion soup mix from Knorr.  I pound the onion mix while still in the soup package because I found the onion chunks a little too big.

I agree that the entire package of spinach should be used. Also, let chill for 24 hrs (if you can wait, yum, yum) the flavour just keeps getting better. I also recommend cooking the spinach first if the package does not say precooked. The spinach is safer and less stringy/tough. We really liked it in mini petas, buy fresh mini petas cut them in half and stuff the dip right in the pocket, soooo good, I could eat the whole thing myself (probably wouldn't feel so good if I did though).

Delicious!  Love the crunch of the water chestnuts, and the mild flavor of the leek soup.  Using the whole box of spinach just adds more flavor.  It's a great dip served in a dish with crackers, too.

YUM.  I make this a little lower in fat/calories by using reduced fat mayo and sour cream...nobody knows the difference! Also, I double the water chestnuts for extra crunch.  Can't find the Leek soup mix around here, so I use the Knorr SPRING Vegetable mix.  Closer to the Leek and much better than the plain ol' Vegetable everyone else uses. Always gets rave reviews and is the first thing to be gone!

I've been making this for years with Knorrs veg and only 1 cup sour cream/1 cup mayo and adding scallions or onion and the whole box of spinach.  The water chestnuts give it a nice crunch.  So for those who like a little color from the veg mix, try adding the scallions or onion

We have a VERY similar recipe in our family...

The only difference is we use the knorr's or lipton Vegetable soup mix instead of the leek one, no mayo just the 16 oz container of sour cream, and the whole container of frozen spinach.

It comes out AMAZING! I go through fazes where this is the only thing I eat because it is just sooooo good!

I first made this dip for a party I was having, and now make it quite a lot of having people over, and it goes over very well. The only thing about the recipe, is that it needs a lot more spinach than it calls for. At least the whole 10oz bag. I have once made with a 16oz bag, and even that didnt seem to much.

I am an "experimental cook" and resisted the temptation to add something to this recipe but it is indeed good enough in itself and doesn't need any adjustments. I served with Pita chips and didn't put in the w. chestnuts as others have suggested.
It's a great change from the onion dip "stuff" which I've always enjoyed.  Great flavor !

This turned out delicious!!!  Vegetable mix was used as my grocer does not carry the leek.  Very important to let your spinach thaw and pat dry.  I could easily see how this would make the mixture watery.  Will make many, many, many more times, I'm sure!  Thanks for sharing!

Deelish!  I added the whole box of spinach and was really impressed with how easy this was. I used light mayo and light sour cream to cut down on a few calories. Great presentation in the bread round.  A new addition to the entertaining menu!

I make this all time! This is so good! and when I serve it in a bread bowl, everyone loves it! The presentation is so nice. This is great with veggies!!!!! and chips! So Yummy!
Sometimes I cannot find leek soup, so I use Vegetable or Spring Vegetable KNORR the large 1 pack (not the Lipton packages that come in a box)..these are too predictable...
This Recipe does not taste like that and that's what makes it so good!

This is my mother's recipe and her mother before that (and now mine). I guess your dad and my grandmother have great taste! 

Everyone goes nuts for this dip. People literally demand that I make it whenever there is any special occasional. It becomes an addiction!

At the request of my boyfriend, I added 1 cup of artichoke hearts (boiled, leaves eaten, and the hearts chopped, hehe) and it turned out fabulous. Stay away from canned hearts though. Fresh is always best!

I also ALWAYS use the full package of spinach. Not doing so really robs the recipe.

I have been making this recipe for ever. I suggest using Knorr cream of leek soup mix. My daughter loves taking this in her lunch for school usually with crackers to dip with. I usually make it every 3 weeks (she would have it everyday if I let her) make a batch and it lasts all school week even with me diving into it.  This is a staple for get togethers, I receive praise all the time, and I only use low cal, low fat, mayo and sour cream, but it is so good and creamy, you would never know! I also like to use it as a veggie dip for something a little different and healthy.

Couldn't find the leek soup so I mixed onion and vegetable together and used half of that.  Delicious still!

We love this! We usually serve it in a pumpernickel loaf, which I think is more visually appealing, and tastier.

This was gone in no time, simple and amazing.  I did change a few things just to have to more tailored to my taste.  I did not use water chestnut mostly because I"m not a fan.  Also, I did not use the bread bowl, again because I'm not a fan of dips with bread.  Instead I used thin organic corn chips.  They must be thin....it was perfect. As suggested I used the whole box of spinach.  Also because I love cheese I added parmesan  and sharp cheddar.  Everyone loved it and can't wait for me to make it again.  Remember, these changes were done for my taste, do what u like.

This is the same recipe that I have always grown up with and gotten so many compliments on!  I love the crunchiness that the water chestnuts add, and the leek soup as opposed to the vegetable mix just adds a wonderful flavor.  The only difference is that I do use the entire package of frozen spinach.

I will use the vegetable soup mix sometimes to mix this up. I have never added the water chestnuts, because I never have it on hand. And I add the whole 12 oz package of spinach, I just make sure that the water is squeezed out very, very, very well. I'm a bread person and this one is for me!!!!!!!

Oh yea, the title says it all. We all agreed this was better than usual spinach dip. I didn't have water chestnuts. This was more flavorful than the type made with the veggie soup. Thanks for sharing, this is the best spinach dip I have ever eaten.

AMAZING! Love it! The bowl was licked clean in no time! I buy extra, large fresh dinner rolls and cut them up to go with the sourdough, there just isn't enough bread, maybe also add veggies or crackers. I cut back the mayo to 3/4 cup and added a little extra sourcream, I also used the whole package of spinach. A trick for drying the spinach out: I line the inside of a salad spinner with a layer of paper towel and spin the spinach, works great! Dries it out just right. Thanks for the yummy recipe!

Same recipe as the one on the back of the spinach package. Much better than the hot, thick, too-rich version! I freeze this in small portions so I can unthaw and enjoy when the craving strikes. My mom loves it.

This dip is so good! Everyone is right, the leek mix is so much better than the vegetable at least in my opinion. This dip is pretty much a must have at all our parties and get togethers.

I have been making this dip for many years, except I use the whole package of spinach, 1 1/2 cups sour cream, and I always use Knorr vegetable dry soup mix. Everyone loves it, and I get asked to bring it to parties all the time.

this recipe lives up to its name, its amazing. My bff made it a few yrs ago for my sons graduation and everyone has been hooked since. I also use the whole package of spinach. Make sure you thoroughly squeeze the liquid out of it, otherwise you will have a watery mess. 
Would give it 10 stars if I could

So tasty!  I tweaked by using double the water chestnuts (whole 8oz can) and the rest of my bag of spinach (an extra 6oz because I am going out of town, didn't want them to sit and go bad in the fridge) and also used some plain yogurt (6 oz) with the sourcream (10 oz), and it turned out to be really so delicious with some homemade pita chips.

I made this spinach dip for Easter.  Even though I had said I was brining the dip, two others also made a spinach dip!!  This one got eaten, and people started stealing the bread from the other dips to use with my recipe!

I omitted the water chestnuts (I felt that was a bit too 'different' for the crowd I was making it for) but made sure to add the leek soup as other reviewers had suggested.  I made it the night before and let it sit in the fridge overnight so that the flavours could mingle.  I will certainly make this again!

This is the 1st time I've made spinach dip and this recipe is awesome! I read the other reviews and used 3/4 cup Hellmans May and the whole 10 oz box of
spinach. I also left out the water chestnuts since my husband doesn't like the crunch. I know this will be a holiday
hit!

This was OK, but a little mayonaise-y for my taste.  I doubled the spinach, but it was still not enough.  I will try another recipe next time.

Eh.  I thought it fell flat.  It had potential, but it was too creamy, it was just like eating a tub of mayo.  Oh wait, it was.

If you do make it, definitely keep it overnight, it tastes like sour cream and onion dip at first.  It also took me 5 different stores to find any leek soup mix in a store.

This dip really was a hit - I made it about 4 hours in advance and chilled it, threw it in a breadbowl with bread pieces and triscuts for dipping and everyone LOVED it! There wasn't a morsel left. And it was so easy. LOVE IT!

This is a pretty good spinach dip. I wasn't able to find dry leek soup mix so substituted it with dry onion soup mix and also used reduced fat mayo.

It's great and super-easy to make.  I once used onion soup mix instead of leek...stick to the leeks.

My husband is allergic to dairy, so I used soy sour cream and cream cheese (Tofutti - highly recommended!) to make this recipe. He'd never had a spinach dip, and I gave him some as soon as it was mixed together. He said that I should make this any time we entertain, give it for holiday gifts, and that we probably should've made more. That sounds like it's a keeper. Oh, and I loved it too! I may be able to get my toddler to eat spinach... Can't wait to try!

This was excellent-- and made enough to feed a bunch of hungry women. I actually didn't read carefully about refrigerating it for 6 hours, and only had time to let it sit for about 2. It still came out great. It just needs to stand long enough for the leek soup to soften, because otherwise you bite into hard pieces of dried leek. I also more than doubled the amount of spinach it called for. I'll definitely make this again!

I made this dip over 2 years ago, and loved it then. I didn't think about it again until we had a small gathering at my place last night. I served this dip in two different ways - on a tray with carrots, celery, broccoli, cauliflower and jicama; also in a hollowed out breadbowl. I used the recipe for Portuguese Sweet Bread I, Submitted by Jennifer Houde on this site for my breadbowl. I mixed all ingredients in my bread mixer (using the dough cycle) then placed the large ball of dough on a greased stoneware pan (like a pizza stone). I let that rise for an hour, on top of my preheating oven. Then I baked it for 10 minutes at 350, rotated it 180 degrees and baked the remaining 10 minutes. When it was cool, I traced the lip of a small glass bowl with a knife in the top of the bread, then cut the hole out with the knife. I was able to set the bowl with the spinach dip in the center of the breadbowl, without making the bread soggy throughout the night. It also made clean-up and storage much easier. The spinach dip was definitely a hit!

This is delicious.  I have a recipe I have always used, but this was better.  My son loves spinach dip and says this is his all time favorite.  I used the entire 10 oz. pkg of spinach and it was perfect.

So good!  I have made it before with vegetable soup dip, but the leek soup is very good.  This is my new favorite way to make spinach dip.  I hope there is some left for the baby shower I am supposed to take it to!

This is great and I have been making it for years.  Use a full pkg of spinach...I usually double the recipe and refill the bread bowl, b/c it goes fast.  I use round PUMPERNICKEL BREAD for the bowl, and cubes of rye and pump, or can use party rye slices and party pump slices.  I also use light ingredients.

This recipe has become a huge hit with my family.  Even the kids, who rarely eat spinach loves it.  The water chestnuts really make this recipe great.  Though great with any bread, it is especially good with pumpernickel.

This makes a LOT of awesome dip. The dry onion soup went bad, so I improvised by adding 3T. of dried onions, 1/4 tsp. white pepper, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp sugar, 1 tsp salt. I also added an entire 8oz. can of water chestnuts. I served it with buttery crackers rather than the bread. Yum!

This is a great recipe! I changed the recipe just a little. I used the entire 10 ounces of spinach in the recipe. I also added 3 cloves of finely chopped garlic, 1/4 of a sweet onion finely chopped, and used 8 ounces of chopped water chestnuts instead of 4 ounces. It was a big hit and I'll definitely be keeping this recipe for future gatherings and potlucks!

I was given this recipe as a newlywed in 1980.  Ever since I am asked to make it over and over again.  It is so simple and the taste is great.  I was told to use it with small triangles of pumpernickel bread.  Over the years we have used Fritos, Hawaiian bread, Italian bread, and any available kind of bread that is fresh from the bakery.  My family has taken the Hawaiian bread dinner rolls and put dip in the middle and eaten it that way.  It is best if made a day ahead and let it chill in the refrigerator 12 to 24 hours.  I have to hide it when chilling or it will get eaten ahead of time!  The Knorr's leek soup mix is what makes it so much better than other recipes.  It is getting harder to find it the soup mix, so when I see it I stock up.  In a pinch the Veggie soup mix can be used, but is not as good.  Enjoy!

I love this spinach dip, but prefer it with the Vegetable Soup mix.  I also add ½ to 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper for a little kick.  I leave the water chestnuts out and use  Wheat Thins to dip it. Yum.

We love this recipe. Definitly a party favourite. I use Knorr's Cream of Leek soup. Make sure to use real mayonnaise NOT Miracle Whip. After making the recipe as is I've reduced the mayonnaise to 3/4 of a cup. Awesome!

I was going to make this as written but first I went to the Knorr website and they said to use the Vegetable soup mix and so I did. It was fantastic and had more colour and other flavour components that the Potato/Leek doesn't have. I would suggest that instead, otherwise everything else was the same. The water chestnuts really do make all the difference.

I have had this and it is without a doubt the BEST spinach dip ever! I believe it is the Knorr Leek soup that takes it over the top. Once you make this one, you will never go back to your old recipe.

This recipe is fantastic - but requires 1 big change to be good. I used half of the soup mix amount it mentioned and it was fine. It would have been WAY too oniony otherwise. I also used an entire package of frozen spinach, since after I squeezed out the water it weighed much less. So that measurement seems off, as well. Also, a tip for those using metric (I'm in Australia) - the 16 oz of sour cream mentioned in the recipe is fluid ounces. It doesn't translate directly to a weight measure, like how sour cream is packaged in other countries. I figured it out though - 16 fl oz of sour cream weighs 454g.

Excellent.  Made this as the appetizer for our weekly family dinner night.  Nothing left of the dip on the serving platter.   Will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Everybody gobbles this down and I can never find the leek soup at our grocery store, so I use the Knorr vegetable soup mix and it is still wonderful.  It's also gluten free and goes well with rice crackers for those who need that...

I have made this dip a few times and love it, the only change was I left out the water chestnuts my family doesnt like them, and I couldn't find leek soup so I used cream of leek soup and it still tasts great. Over all the best spinage dip I have ever tasted.

If you don't care for the onion flavoring, try a packet of Ranch dip seasoning (Hidden Valley is prob the best). I have had it both ways, and I am more of a Ranch girl. I have made this for many many years w/the ranch, and it is ALWAYS a hit! Make sure not to skimp on the sourdough bread. Also, cut up some veggies to have on the side, we love to dip 'em too!

This was an easy recipe to follow. I made it for Thanksgiving and it was a hit! I did change it up and added onion soup mix instead of leek and used less water chestnuts (my taste preference)and added more spinach about a cup extra and it came out yummy! Somehow I've now been bestowed as the "Spinach dip" maker!

My whole family loved this dip!  I strayed from the directions a bit and used a whole bag of fresh spinach.  I boiled it for a couple minutes, drained it and squeezed out all the water really well.  I didn't use as many water chestnuts as the recipe called for solely because I'd never had them and the smell made me skeptical, but after eating the finished product I'm sure adding the correct amount would have been fine.  I also used cream of leek soup mix because I couldn't seem to find just plain leek soup mix.  

The most important thing to point out is that this dip does NOT taste good right after it has been made!  Leaving it for several hours or overnight is essential.

This was easy to make, delicious and a hit at the party.  I used a full box of spinach, not half as suggested.  I also squeezed as much water as possible out of the spinach before combining with other ingredients.

Couldn't find the leek soup mix locally so used the vegetable and it still turned out good. I skimped on the water chestnuts because I was unsure of them, but next time I won't because they were very good in the dip. Gave it 4 starts because there was just a certain "oomph" missing that makes spinach dip so addicting to me - but maybe it was the lack of leek? Still ate it up.

Brought this to a work potluck & everyone enjoyed it. I made both the leek & veggie versions. Some thought there was meat in it & it must've been the water chestnuts that gave it great consistency & crunch. Like most of you have already mentioned, I can't reiterate more about making sure to wring out the spinach as best as you can. I bought baby spinach, BTW, no having to cut or shred. Easiest potluck dish ever!

I left out the water chestnuts because of personal preference and served in a regular bowl instead of the sourdough. As others suggested, I doubled the spinach to use the whole box...big mistake. It gave it a very stringy texture and the spinach flavor was a little overpowering. The leek soup was a different take on it. Not bad, but my husband and I thought it needed something else to be really good. I'm used to getting lots of compliments when I take a dish to work, but this barely got a mention and for being one of two dips there for the luncheon, I brought a lot home. If I make this again, I'll probably half the mayo, use the recommended amount of spinach and try some other spices (maybe some cayenne pepper and garlic) or add in some parmesean or romano cheese.

This is a very good recipe.  I'm not a huge spinach dip fan, but tried a free handout at Costco that was so good, but I was convinced it could be improved.  So I checked here -- and this recipe got rave reviews.  Like many others, I swapped some items out.  I finely chopped 2 fresh leeks (whites and some green) and sauteed them until about half were browned (about 8 - 10 minutes on medium heat), then I added 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic and let that cook for a minute or so.  Then I mixed the garlic/leeks in a bowl with an equal amount of frozen spinach -- which I seasoned with salt and peper, and added tablespoons of mayonaise then sour cream until the consistency I liked.  I used full fat, but like others, I will try the low fat.  The kids ate every last drop -- consuming more spinach and leeks then they knew what they were eating.

This is close to the best... but not the best!
I repace the Leek soup with Knorr Vegetable soup, cop up one red onion & add a teaspoon of lemon juice... Trust me, this makes a huge difference.  I make it all the time & everyone always asks for the recipe.  Friends, family and co-works all love it & I get requests to make it for every party/pot-luck I go to.  YUM!

This dip is easy and delicious just like I remember. I used veggie dip seasoning instead of leek because I like the flecks of orange the carrots provide. Thanks!

yum!  made up some of this, measuring by eye, for a quick, snack-like supper, and it was well received....  USED FRESH SPINACH and a bit of chopped red pepper, CHOPPED THE SPINACH WITH TWO KNIVES AFTER SPINACH WAS COOKED AND IN THE SAUCE, SORT OF LIKE 'CUTTING SHORTENING' INTO PIE CRUST..., no trouble at all........

Thanks so much Shawna!  Your dad rocks!  Fantastic Spinach Dip, with, and without, the chestnuts, and as much as my family loves spinach I did use the entire package.   I may try Jicama as a sub for the water chestnuts.  This disappeared quickly - everyone LOVED it.  Beautiful presentation in the bread bowl.  This recipe is in my special collection.  Thank you!

I took this to a baby shower.  The mother to be would have eaten the entire bowl if we would have let her.  I served it with pita chips and everyone loved it.  I did double the spinach, personal preference.  Giving the recipe as a favor would have been a great idea, as everyone now wants it.

Yum..always a crowd pleaser. I actually double the amount of spinach and add more water chestnuts. Reduced fat sour cream works!

Awesome recipe, very simple and quick, I usually double up the recipe since one sourdough bowl gets eaten quickly, also I buy sourdough baguettes and cut to make a beautiful presentation alongside the bowl.  :)

I don't lilke posting negative reviews but I took this to a potluck yesterday and people barely touched it. There's way too much sour cream and mayo in here. You definitely need to use the entire box of spinach.

This recipe was awesome. I will definitely make this again. I made this for a party and everyone loved it. The only changes I made is that I added half a red bell pepper diced, diced red onion and eliminated the water chestnuts. My only regret is that I didn't make more because it went so fast. Everyone was asking for more.

Gets Rave Reviews at Get-Togethers!
I make the recipe just as written. The Knorr Leek Soup and the refrigeration time are key to its wonderful flavor. I get requests for it!

Very simple, very tasty, very reliable recipe that always goes over well at a party. I can never find the leek soup mix, so I always end up using the vegetable mix. I love it with the veg mix, but am dying to try it with the leek one to see how that changes the flavor.

I made this because of the rave reviews, and followed the recipe exactly (except for using low fat or fat free versions of everything.) I don't know if that's why it didn't taste good, but it just tasted more like mayo than anything else. Not great :(

Delish...only the knorr leek mix will do.  Use the whole 10 oz spinach.  We left out the water chestnuts the 2nd time around as they added nothing in our mind.

I just got done making this. It tastes great right away. I can't wait to taste it after 6 hours! I'm serving it with garlic artisian bread, cheese flavored triscuits, and tomato basil wheat thins! Delicious. I would prefer more spinach but with the way the package frozen chopped spinach now a days it the amount called for in the recipe was good enough. If I had an extra 2 oz. of spinach I would throw it in.  So yummy!

I thought this was super easy and super yummy! I used the whole bag of spinach and I substituted onion soup mix for leek soup mix since it wasn't at the grocery store.  I really liked it with the onion.

This truely is the best spinach dip ever. Using the leek soup mix really adds alot of additional flavour v.s. using vegetable soup mix. This receipe is one I'll be using time and time again.

I couldn't find the leek soup in any of the 3 different grocery stores that I checked at so I ended up using the dried vegetable one. I was still tasty though. I will be on the look out for the leek soup and hopefully get to make it that way in the future!

I had a friend who used to make this dip for all parties.  I knew basically what was in the recipe, but didn't know quantities, etc.  I'm so glad to have this.  The only thing I did differently was that I put in the whole box of spinach.  Delicious.

This recipe was amazing! Everyone loved it at my husband's birthday party. The only changes I made were I used a whole package of spinach and I used vegetable soup mix instead of leek.

Got great reviews & compliments on this dip (only thing I did differently was use canola mayo & light sour cream, & used 1/2 a 20 oz. bag chopped frozen spinach), other than that I followed it as is, why try a recipe, alter it and then tell someone what's wrong with it?  I had people asking me for the recipe!  I like this one much better than the "onion soup mix" recipe out there, especially the color!  Thanks so much!  (Am thinking of trying roasted, or diced red pepper in it next time just for something different).

It absolutely is the best ever!!  I followed the recipe exactly except as others suggested, I used the whole 10 ounce box of spinach for more texture.  It was PERFECT!!!

Ok, definitely not the best spinach dip ever. I used onion soup mix because my store didn't have leek. Maybe that makes all the difference. And, I used all the spinach since it would have been barely anything otherwise. The thing is, this dip tastes like onion dip, with spinach in it. It tasted nothing like the store-bought creamy spinach dip you buy in the deli. And the onion soup made the base brown, not white, and it just looked unappetizing. No one ate this. I still liked it, but I love onion dip! I just wanted spinach dip that tasted like the kind you buy!

This spinach dip was amazing. I made it for a going away party and it was the most popular dish there. There was no sourdough bread at the store, so I used french bread and just cut it into chunks. One loave was not enough, after the bread was gone people at the pary were dipping crackers and chips into it. The bowl was licked clean after.  I will never try another recipe for spinach dip, this is the winner. I am going to go make it again right now.

This is a great recipe! Whenever we have a family party I am always asked to bring this dip. I use a nice fresh pumpernickel-rye bread.  The hardest part is getting the water out of the spinach and best way is to use your hands and squeeze it out.  I usually put all ingredients in my KitchenAid so it's all mixed uniformly.  The water chestnuts make the extra crunch and are a must!  I have used both regular sour cream and reduced fat.  I find that Breakstone's brand reduced fat sour cream is the best--you cannot even tell that it's not full fat sour cream. We don't have Knorr soup mix at our local stores anymore so I always use the Lipton Onion Soup mix.  It still turns out great I promise!  Great easy recipe.  It's always the bomb at parties.  Thank you for sharing this one-I give it five stars!

WOW! I have never had a complaint. I take it to every gathering because its always requested. I dice up cucumbers in it. Makes a great addition. Sometimes I use leek soup and sometimes I use vegetable. They are both very tasty and I don't have a favorite. So far no has even noticed the difference when I use the different soups.

absolutely delicious.  This dip has become a staple at family barbeques.  My supermarket doesn't carry the leek soup mix so I use vegetable soup mix and it turns out great! Also I use the entire package of spinach.  Make sure to squeeze dry that spinach well!

While this is very good, and went over big at a potluck, I am not convinced its much different than any other homemade spinach dip I've tried.  I doubled the spinach in mine - it just didn't seem like enough to me.  I also would suggest to others adding some extra mayo and/or cutting back on the sour cream because if it sits out long (any more than an hour), it gets soupy.

My cousin gave me this recipe and I love it! She doesn't remember where she got it from, but it's this recipe almost to the T. The only thing different is her recipe only uses 1 cup of sour cream. That's the only difference. It's always the first thing to go at a party. I love it! Yum!

This was good, but tasted a bit packaged. It wasn't to die for or anything and there were left overs. Usually when I make a dip with fresh ingredients it's gobbled up in no time.

This really is THE BEST SPINACH DIP EVER!!!  I made it the night before my party and they ate it all. It was so easy and good.  I too used the whole package of spinach.  I found the Knor Dry Leek Soup mix in the ethnic foods asile.  I actually found it on accident which worked out great 'cause when I went to look for it where I thought it would be (in the soup aisle) it wasn't there.  Again great!!!  Thanks!!!

I made this for a superbowl party (all men) and it was a HUGE hit - every single person that ate it gave me a compliment, of course we quickly ran out so I will double the recipe next time.  I was hesitant at first about the dry leek soup mix but it 100% made a difference (vs. vegetable)

No changes ever needed when making this dip! The leek soup is what makes everyone go 'hmmmmmmm, tasty!'. I get asked for this recipe constantly. I have found that most good sourdough and rye breads work just fine with this and I usually bring a packet of club crackers with it as well since everyone just inhales the bread!

Great recipe! For those who have runny dip- make sure to really drain the spinach well. I even squeezed it out with paper towels, and my dip was almost too thick. You must double the spinach, though.

This recipe was great!  My husband loves spinach dip, and he thought this one was great!  I did make a few adjustments: I put in a little less mayo and used Knorr's veggie soup mix instead of the leek mix.  I doubled the spinach and left out the water chestnuts.  I suggest making this at least a day ahead because it definitely tastes better the next day.

I LOVE this stuff!  I've only made it with Knorr's Veggie mix, never have found the Leek - but I think it's just awesome stuff.  Sometimes I add a little minced garlic, leftover veggies such as green onion, red pepper, celery, etc. - whatever I need to use up. I've probably have made this at least 6 times in the last year.

This recipe is great!   It tasted exactly like I hoped it would.

I was in a hurry so I mixed the mayo/sour cream/soup mix together and put that in the fridge while the spinach thawed.   I don't think it hurt the flavor at all.  I also left out the water chestnuts.

really good. i made with fat free sour cream & lite mayo - was great.  used 10oz spinach bag - even better. chilling is important - cause the soup mix is crunchy and needs to soften.

I made this dip for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it! I used 3/4 cup mayonaise instead of a full cup and omitted the waterchestnuts and it was so yummy! I put the dip into pumpernickle bread and it was such a hit! I will be making it again for Christmas! Thanks for posting it!

I think the best part of this recipe is the bread bowl idea- the sour dough bread with the dip was a terrific combination. Also, I did not half the spinach as the recipe suggests. I used a whole package of frozen spinach and it was exactly enough. I will make this again. Thanks!

Tasty! I used Knorr Vegitable soup mix. I like it a lot with just half the spinach. A definate keeper! The bowl was empty in about 5 minutes at the party!

Just a quick note, I did add about 2 tablespoons of finely minced onion (the Knorr box said to add three green onions but I didnt have any on hand). I made it again with the green onions and I liked it better with the regular onion. Yum!

Truly is the "Best Spinach Dip Ever". Ever time I go to a party people ALWAYS tell me to bring it.

(PS-I cut out the water chestnuts).

Awesome recipe.  I changed it a bit and used pumpernickel bread and instead of dry leek mix used onion soup mix but result was awesome and a hit at the party.

This dip is great and so simple to make.  I get requests to bring this to every party I go to.  I make it lower fat by using light mayo and sour cream.

Only changes I made were to use the entire box of spinach and adding chopped green onion. I recommend refrigerating for at least 36 hours before serving; it was even better the second day. A favorite in our book; it will be added to my personal recipe collection!

Awesome!  I didn't make any alterations to the recipe and the whole thing was eaten quickly.  Best spinach dip I've ever had.  I used sourdough loaf and used the sourdough bread pieces and pumpernickel bread pieces for dipping.

This was absolutely wonderful. I don't usually like to make a lot of substitutions or additions to a new recipe, but I did use the whole package of spinach and also added a small bag of cooked and crumbled bacon just to stretch my dip a little. I also added a small jar of pimientos to add a little color (especially for Christmas).  I brought it to a party, and got lots of great compliments. I served in a sour bread bowl with slices of sour dough bread on the side!  Thanks very much for this great recipe!

I loved this recipe despite the fact that I am not a huge water chestnut fan. This recipe creates a huge amount of dip... more than one bread bowl worth of dipping can provide, so I usually buy two bread bowls (one sourdough, one pumpernickel) and use one as the bowl (and tear up the leftovers) and cut up the other one into bite sized pieces for dipping. I also suggest making sure the spinach is chopped because if not, it's hard to eat. This dip is also great with crackers, veggies, and apples. YUM.

Yummy!!  At first I wasn't going to put the water chestnuts in but I'm so glad I did.  Don't leave them out because they add a wonderful freshness to the dip.  Everyone at the party devoured it!  Great recipe...thanks so much!

Wow!!  What a great recipe....!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I left out the water chestnuts.  I drained the spinach out well as suggested by the other reviews.  I used a glass bowl in the bread to prevent the bread from becoming soggy.  I will make this for New Years Eve, but am going to serve them with tortilla chips, I found the bread to be very filling.  Thanks for sharing Shawna!!

Yum, yum.  This is so good!  I left out the water chesnuts and used a whole 10 oz. box of spinach.  From prior experience, I knew to drain the spinach very well.  It turned out great.  I also took the advice of an earlier review and cut out a hole in my bread to fit a glass bowl so that the bread does not get soggy!

This recipe is a classic.  Add more frozen, chopped spinach, though.  (Thawed, obviously.)  And use Knorr's Vegetable/Leek soup mix.  I have used pumpernickel bread before and that is tasty, too.  People will eat the bread bowl, I guarantee it...I've seen it happen!

I have been searching for a good spinach dip recipe. I didn't want anything too fancy or obscure, this is perfect because it's a traditional spinach dip, but with an added flare with the water chestnuts.

Awesome dip!  I played around a bit and added shredded carrots & green onions. I also used hawaiin bread instead of sourdough. It was a big hit at the office christmas potluck.

This dip was wonderful!  I added some grated parmesan and used less mayo than the recipe said.  I couldn't find the leek soup either, but did find cream of spinach soup (made by Knoll).  It was amazing and I will be making this often!

Very tasty...It really makes a difference to let it sit and let the flavours blend (I left it overnight)  Next time I will add some chopped red bell pepper mostly for appearance.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was the best Spinach dip and the first time we ever made it ourselves. We went to a friend's and brought three other dips and forgot to make this one. My husband made it the next day and we just hung out watching tv and eating as much of it as we could. We absolutely love this and always look for a reason to make it again.

D-licious!!!!!  I added a half of a small white onion and a clove of garlic (which was really too much, a half a clove will do)to mine because I'm a huge garlic and onion fan.  It tasted like the dips sold at the good quality grocery stores.  If you let it sit overnight before you eat it, the flavors really get a chance to distribute themselves.

This is the best recipe!!! I couldn't stand to wait 6 hours, so I ate some right away and it was still wonderful. I will certainly be making this for my next party. I used plain french bread and it was great. I highly recommend this recipe. Very easy, too.

This recipe was so easy to make and very tasty! I used the whole package of spinach and extra water chestnuts. I ended up having to make a few copies of the recipe to give guests!

Quick and Tasty!  Even my veggie-phobic fiance loved it.  Served it as an appetizer during Christmas and was asked for scoop some up in doggie bags before the night was through!  Definitely recommend using entire box of frozen spinach!

i origionally wanted to do the knorr's spinich recipe, but the store was out of the veggie dip.  i remembered this recipe, and got the leak mix instead.  i was not dissappointed in the least, and neither were my guests!!!  i will keep using this wonderful alternative.

This was good, but not THE best I have made.  I, along with all my guests, think the recipe on the back of the Knorr's Vegetable soup box is better.  Very simialr but uses vegetable soup mix instead of leek soup mix and adds onions.

I made this dip for a potluck and it was a huge hit!  I couldn't find the leek soup mix, so I used Knorr vegetable soup mix, some fresh chopped parsley,a little fresh lemon juice and a little finely chopped red onion (I only used 2 green onions).  I also served it with corn chips instead of the pumpernickle bread bowl. This dip is now a staple in my recipe repertoire!

I could not find the leek soup, so I had to substitute onion, and I wasn't very impressed.  Maybe that is because I am not a huge fan of onion soup, but I was hoping for better from a recipe with such high reviews.

Very nice dip.  I used vegetable soup mix (couldn't find leek), low fat mayo and sour cream and rye bread instead of sourdough.  It went quickly at the party, thanks.

I've made twice. 1st to the exact directions- it was pretty good- but not 5 stars. The second time I made these changes for Easter and my family devoured the entire thing in about an hour!  - Use the entire bag of spinach. - Did not add water chestnuts. - Add 1 small tub of herb and garlic cream cheese (another reviewer's suggestion). -Add 1 cup of shredded parmesan. Did not put in sourdough bread. I am keeping this recipe forever. It actually made it to my physical recipe box!

I made this in lieu of buying a spinach dip for an anniversary party we put on.  I quadrupled this recipe and was able to not only fill a 12" bread bowl, but we refilled it two more times and I have a little left over.  This was really easy to make and I followed the recipe exactly.  I don't eat it so I don't know how it tasted, but like I said earlier, we filled the bread bowl a total of three times throughout the party.

To get the flavor you want you MUST let the dip sit in the refrigerator, overnight is best.  It will taste like onions if you mix and eat!!! It must marinate to get the best flavors.  Also,  squeeze all the water out of the spinach so it will not be so soupie.  Adding a little extra spinach may help as well. 
This recipe is almost exact to knorr recipe, except it’s veggie mix instead of leek mix and knorr suggest green opinions.  The taste is very similar, some prefer one over the other. However, you can not go wrong with either soup mix. 
I pretty much followed the recipe as written. 
I did add the green onion and pimentos. 
I also  used an entire box of spinach. 
next time I will use a red bell pepper, a little garlic, more water chestnuts, and a box and a half of spinach for  a little more texture.   This was my first time making spinach dip and it was a hit. I served it with pita and tortilla chips..

Made as directions indicated except used whole box of spinach and used Miracle Whip. Turned out perfectly. I did drain and squeeze out the spinach as dry as I could get it. This is like the recipe Mom made back in the day.

I've made this recipe at least a dozen times over the years. Everyone loves it. I double the spinach and add extra water chestnuts. It's also great served with pita chips.

Delicious! I used the Knorr's Vegetable Recipe Mix and it was sooo good. I love the crunch of the water chestnuts so I doubled the amount. Really good.

This is basically the same recipe that is printed on the back side of the Knorr Vegetable Soup package except that one also adds three scallions chopped to the mixture. It is great and always a hit anytime I take it to parties, tailgate gatherings, etc. One other minor change I've made is to use a 16-oz bag frozen  spinach instead of the 10-oz package.  I do especially like the leek soup recipe (for the soup) but will try using the dry leek mix to see what difference in taste there is if any.

This recipe is one of my all time favorite appetizers. I substituted 1 c. of unflavored yogurt for the sour cream, used everything else but add 1 c. shredded cheddar cheese, 2 cloves of garlic crushed and 2 T. minced sun-dried tomatoes.  I brushed the inside of the bread with olive oil, placed a sheet of foil on the outside of the crusty bread and broilded the bread until the interior portion was crispy.  This kept the bread bowl from getting soggy after I added the dip. This presents so well!

Excellent!  I made a few minor changes:  I used Knorr Vegetables (dried) and instead of water chestnuts I added a can of artichoke hearts.  Really, really good and friends and family were so impressed!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this spinach dip today and it exceeded my expectations! My frequent complaint about the dip in the deli in they do not put enough spinach in it. I followed an earlier suggestion and put in the whole container of spinach. It is terrific! I worried I wouldn't find the leek soup, but it was right by the other dried soups. I will never try another version after this. Can't wait to serve at a birthday party tomorrow.

Awesome and easy - first try at spinach dip and this is the only recipe I'll use in the future.  I left out the water chestnuts, added artichoke hearts and green onions. Could not find the leek soup mix so went with the veggie mix, and added a little seasoned salt.  I also used 1 1/2 pkg of spinach - one pkg just looked like so little.  Made for a party and it was a hit!

I have been making spinach dip for 35 yrs. I use knorrs vegetable soup mix. Sometimes I add a little cream cheese. and a little garlic.  But I always add a small onion, chopped fine. I have also used fresh cooked spinach, instead of frozen. I have not tried the above recipe, but can not imagine it without the onion. I made up the rating, haven not tried this recipe. Anything is better than store brought.

delicious! altering just slightly this was a fantastic veggie dip for my new year's eve party!!  every single guest enjoyed this dip so much that they cleaned the bowl out with their fingers. I omitted the chestnuts mainly because of my personal dislike for them.  I added an entire bag(16oz) of frozen spinach and prepared the day before my party.  Instead of presenting in a bread bowl I put it in a bowl, surrounded wih veggies and pretzel sticks.  I am asked to bring this to every function I am invited to.

The name doesn't lie!  I am obsessed!  The leek soup is perfect and you do need a decent amount of spinach (which I had to Google how to drain frozen spinach, I must admit :)  squeeze in a paper towel if you're wondering!)  and the water chestnuts are better as small as you can get them.
Yummy!

Did this with all the same ingredients except used the Knorr's dry vegetable soup mix. and it was not to much onion flavor, (even though I like onion dip), this is a Spinach dip. The flavors came through real well and fresh tasting. Thanks for the start.

Really good and much better than whenever used the dry veg. package.  I would recommend adding the full can of water chestnuts.  I would also suggest making it the day before you want it because the flavors have more time to blend!

The name is certainly appropriate!  I've made this numerous times, which says a lot for me since I crave variety.  It's great with sourdough bread, beer bread, crackers or just on the end of your finger.  This is a great recipe that everyone loves.

Killer!  Needed a Christmas Eve appetizer at the last minute.  Saw this, checked for simplicity, it fit the bill.  Didn't have time to do my usual obsessive scouring of all the reviews, just printed off the recipe, ran to the store for the ingredients and made this according to the recipe.  It was fantastic and everyone loved it!!

It was a huge hit!  I'm not a great cook but I've made this twice and everyone loved it. I made it exactly as written, refrigerated it over night.  I served it the 1st time with bread, the second time in a bowl with crackers and thought both ways were great. Thank you Shawna!

I add the whole box of spinach, 6 to 8 chopped Green Onions and 6 strips of crisp, crumbled bacon, reserving some of the bacon and onions for garnish. Now it is the best ever!

Used 16 oz of fresh spinach in-lieu of frozen. Cooked it, cooled it, squeezed out the water. Added about a teaspoon of lemon juice. Delicious.

I have been making this for many years now and it is always a hit.  I can no longer find the leek soup mix so I have had to substitute the vegetable soup mix lately which is (almost) just as good.  I always use two boxes of spinach when I make this recipe but other than that I make it as is and it is delicious!

Use the entire pkg of spinach (thawed with the water squeezed out).  Definitely give it time to chill in the fridge before serving, so the flavours have time to blend.

I mix in a half a package of cream cheese, use FULL package of chopped spinach!  This is a hit every time I make it, and friends/family request I bring this to parties every year!  Though using pumpernickel or sourdough bread "bowls" is great for presentation, I often use Ritz Crackers (regular or Garlic Butter flavor) to serve with dip.  Dip is gone within minutes of my arrival.

Delicious dip!  I did use the entire 10 oz of spinach in the dip.  Served it with veggie chips.  My 8 yr old grandson has asked to take the leftovers home both times I've made it because he likes it so much.  I'll definitely make this again.

This is the best recipe ever! Ive been using it for years now. Every family function or event im expected to bring my spinach dip! Ive also made a VEGAN version, using Tofutti (tofu sour cream) and veganaise. Turns out so rich and creamy and tastes incredible! Don't be surprised when your friends hound you for this recipe ;)

Absolutely love this recipe!! I took the advice of other reviews and used the whole package of spinach and it was perfect! I used pita bread and drizzled some oil on them and baked them! Also i shredded some cheese on top and turned the oven to broil until the cheese melted! So good! Tasted just like at a restaurant! I threw the water chestnuts into a food processor and made them really small - they still have a great crunch with a big chunk. Will be turning to this recipe often!

I really like this recipe alot and even added a little bit to it, like adding a whole package of spinach to it and less chestnuts and use sliced and then i chop them into pretty good sized pieces.  It is always a fast going item when i make it.  It's fast and easy and always good a must have item during summertime especially.

This recipe was absolutely fabulous.  I'm visiting family back home and my brother wanted spinach dip. We filed the recipe so we'd have it for two occasions.  The only changes we made were one package of leek soup and one package of the vegetable mix for a double batch. It was delish! What made this recipe ended better was melting some mozzarella cheese on top in the microwave for about40 seconds.  Unbelievably good!!

I love this recipe.  My family loves it too.  The only changes I make are leaving out the water chestnuts and using the whole package of frozen spinach. It is my go-to dip recipe!

Believe it or not, this dip is one of my weight loss secrets too (when made with light sour cream and light mayo).  If I limit night time snacks to tangerines, veggies with a little dip, and raw almonds, the weight comes off and I don't feel deprived!

I've been making this dip since 1982 and it is indeed very, very good.  However, try my twist on this recipe by using a full box of drained frozen chopped spinach and Knorr's Leek Soup Mix, no other brand will do.  Now for the kicker: add 1 (8 oz) package of soften cream cheese.  Mix it all together with the rest of the ingredients and you will be utterly amazed at how fabulous this dip becomes, better than the original recipe!

1) I don't use as much sour cream as this recipe call for, a cup is fine. *Hellmans mayo always seems to taste best*

2) Like everyone else I use the whole pack of spinach

3) Chopped green onion (1 bunch) instead of the packaged soup

4) MOST IMPORTANTLY- Fresh squeezed LEMON!! About a 1/4 cup depending on you....

5) Salt, pepper, and a dash of Granulated garlic...

THIS IS MY 5 STAR VERSION!!

This was pretty good. I didn't love it, but I'm not usually the type to love packaged soup flavorings. I took it to a bridal shower with a veggie tray and it wasn't a huge hit. I did leave out the water chestnuts since I don't care for them, so maybe that was where I went wrong. I did use all the spinach package and would highly recommend it!

Nice recipe. Add 4 or 5 chopped green onions & 1/4 cup parmesan cheese and it is amazing! Make sure you chop the water chestnuts into small chunks, so you get some in every bite!

I made this for a family party and everyone really liked it.  I used a 9 oz package of frozen spinach (drained), the leek soup mix and a added a half jar of marinated artichoke hearts.  Ir is really easy to make, and I know I will be making this again and again.

OMG, easy and sooo good! Had to use veg. Seasoning (couldn't find leek). Still awesome! Note you MUST let it chill! At first I tasted it and thought "gross mayo taste!!" But 6 hours later the flavors married and it was delicious! I used sliced sourdough and my family is in love!!  Made it twice, second time added minced onion. Yum! Thank you!!!

Thank you!  This recipe was just what I was looking for and was a huge hit.  I followed some comments of others and doubled the spinach, making the whole pack.  It was so easy and came out great.

I am surprised by all of the amazing reviews - like some reviewers indicated, it was like eating mouthfuls of mayonnaise. Made this for some guests (guys who will usually eat anything), and they didn't like it either.

Not a fan.  I guess I like  "cheesier" version of spinach dip rather than the sour cream/mayo version.  Probably won't make this again.

This very good, however, I hate using dry soup mixes in my dips, never care for the taste, so I left that out and added 1/2 tsp each onion powder and seasoning salt and 1 clove crushed garlic.  Very good!

I made this and OMG!!! It was soooo good...did exactly what the recipe said except I used all the spinach! I am getting ready to make a double batch for a Christmas Eve Party, and I can't wait for everyone to taste it! Thank You so much. And my Husband, who hates creamy anything couldn't stop eating it!

Tried this version, as I was out of the ingredients I usually use. I was okay, a little to bland. More like onion dip. Once I altered it by adding 2 packs of thawed chopped spinach and about 1-2 teaspoons of lemon juice, much better. 
Or instead of the dry leek soup mix try with the Knorrs spring vegtable mix and a few greens onions. The flavor is more balanced.

I used the entire box of spinach.  Also added artichokes to dip.  Since this dip was going to be sitting outside at a tailgate party I only used sour cream (didn't want anyone getting food poisioning) and the dip was fine. I bought 2 rounds of rosemary artisan bread at Kroger's for dipping which tasted great when dipped into the spinach dip.

I used this as a base = made some changes and we love it.  I use 16 ounces of 2% Greek Yogurt, 1/2 cup low fat mayo and 1/2 cup low fat sour cream, a little more than 4 ounces of chestnuts and a 16 ounce padkage of Trader Joes chopped spinach.  Serve on anything you like, I prefer WASA crisp bread.

I have made this twice recently.  The first time was very bland even though I followed the recipe exactly. The second time it was so much better and I used Miracle Whip because I was out of mayo and prefer Miracle Whip (it has more flavor). The people who happened to have it both times, all asked what I did different because the second time it had more flavor.  So I suggest you use Miracle Whip.

Got rave reviews with this at the bridal shower I took it to.  Followed suggestions of others and used full 10 oz of spinach.  Omitted soup mix and instead added: 3 green onions, finely chopped; 1 large clove garlic, minced; 3 tsp. Bragg's liquid aminos (you could use soy sauce); 2 tsp. Mrs. Dash garlic & herb.  Everybody was asking for the recipe!

Great recipe! Was able to easily adapt to fit our dairy-free, soy-free, gluten-free needs and serve to "regular" people without a problem.  Used canola mayo & plain almond yogurt instead of sour cream & decreased both to 3/4 cup based on other reviews, thanks!  In place of soup mix Used 2 garlic cloves, 1/4 minced onion and 1T seasoned salt.  Served with Udi's bread and carrot sticks.  Yum!

Really is the "Best Spinach Dip Ever". I used the full 10oz of spinach, other than that, I stayed to the recipe and turns out great every time!

I did make some changes though... I didn't have water chestnuts so used pecans, and I used a full 16 oz package of spinach.  Most people commented that they really liked the high spinach to cream ratio, compared to other dips.

I don't like water chestnuts so I used finely diced celery instead and it was an excellent substitution.  I also used others' advice as to how to not use leek soup mix b/c I didn't have any, and this dip turned out so awesome everyone loved it.
Brought it to our superbowl party and it was a touch down!!!

I've made this twice and it is my favorite dip ever. The picture doesn't do it justice. I highly recommend this recipe! I've served it with crackers, bread chunks, and chips. It is still great the next day, too! I've made it with and without the water chestnuts. They don't seem to matter much to me, especially if I am serving the dip with a crunchy side of chips/crackers.

Pretty darned good! I took the advice of some other reviewers and used the whole 10 oz package of spinach.  It was just the right amount.  I couldn't find leek or onion soup mix at the store, so I substituted with 2 tsp. each of granulated onion and garlic, 2 finely chopped stalks of green onion, and 2 tbsp. finely chopped parsley.  I might try substituting the mayo for low fat yogurt next time.  The mayo flavor doesn't come through that much, and I think the yogurt would give it a nice zip.

Seriously!! Best spinach dip ever! I actually put in the spinach when some of it was still partially frozen, but that didn't seem to affect the taste at all. I only put in 1/2 the package as stated, but I might stick in the whole thing next time! Thanks for the great recipe!

I have used a ranch recipe for years with great success. However, I am always up for something new. I rate this 3 stars as is. However, I found a similar recipe that uses 1/2 c. mayo (I used Kraft), 1/2 c. sour cream (Deans) and 8 oz. softened cream cheese. It also added 4 chopped green onions. We put both this modified version and the ranch version side by side at our football party last night and everyone liked both!

After reading past reviews...used Knorr's Leek Soup Mix, entire 10 oz pkg of spinach, 3/4 c. light mayo, 1½ c. sour cream and the entire 8oz can of water chestnuts - because I did not want to take a chance at throwing half the can away later ;) This will be the only spinach dip I will make from now on!

This really is the best spinach dip I have ever had!  I left out the water chestnuts and used pumpernickel bread instead.  The leek soup mix really sets the taste apart from other recipes!  Easy and delicious!

Nice, easy recipe. I use one whole box of spinach and I leave the water chestnuts out because I don't really like their texture or flavor. Making the dip the night before really does enhance the flavors. A definite crowd pleaser!

For years I have been looking for a recipe like one my mother's coworker used to make at parties. This is as close as I have come, and I was very happy with it. The leek soup mix gave it the flavor I was looking for. Served it in a bread bowl and it was cleaned out. Thanks!

This is a fabulous dip and I have brought it to several parties.  ENDLESS RAVES!!! My roommate isn't a huge fan of water chestnuts so I left them out.  I replaced them with marinated artichokes and green onions.  I also add a few cheeses (1 cup shredded parm).  I was worried on Thanksgiving because the store was completely out of dry leek soup mix (really does make it) so I used onion instead.  Mixed with the green onions I had put in, it was somewhat overwhelming.  However, I chilled it overnight and by the morning that was no longer the case.  It was spot on.

This recipe is a great "base" recipe, but I found that adding green onions, herb cream cheese (I used chive cream cheese), half the mayo, leek soup mix and fresh garlic really amped this one up super. I could have eaten the whole bread bowl. At the end of the night, guests were tearing apart the bowl wanting more!

Super good spinach dip!  Made it for Thanksgiving at a friend's house last year and it was all gone by the end of the day.  Am making it for a bridal shower soon as it is such a nice presentation in the bread bowl. Did use light mayonnaise and sour cream and it was just fine.  Also recommend sticking to the Leek soup mix; regular onion soup or anything else just isn't quite the same.  Good stuff!!!!!

I made this without the artechoke, and I loved it! I am in Japan and they do not have the frozen artechoke but, i followed everything else. The only thing I added was garlic powder. I let it sit over night and then I bake the bread and the peices until they were golden. Then I stuffed the bread with the dip. It was a hit at the party. Thanks!

This was good, but I think I'll keep looking for the perfect dip.  To suit my tastes, this dip would need to be thicker (less "runny") and heartier (more spinach, more water chestnuts, more ?? - as is, I believe there's too much mayo and sour cream).

This was out of this world. Even the picky eaters raved about it at the party I brought it to. The only changes I made were to use pumpernickle bread and the whole package of spinach. The leek soup and water chestnuts is what takes it to the next level of delicious. Also next time I will serve with crackers as well as the bread. Can't wait to make again. Thank YOU

Used olive oil mayo, light sour cream, pumpernickel bread, entire 10 oz package spinach, entire 8 oz can water chestnuts. This made it more of a vegetable side dish, and much healthier.  Sooo yummy, great reviews from the party I took it to!

i used fresh spinach as i never buy frozen veggies... i wilted it by saute-ing 2 cloves of garlic then adding the entire box (10 oz) of spinach a little at a time.. it will all eventually fit into a small pan as it reduces by more than half.. then roll it in a kitchen towel and wring it out. also, rather than using the soup mix i minced onion as per another reader's comment and used the garlic, therefore the mix wasnt needed.  i dont like water chesnuts, so i eliminated this part.  awesome and easy dip, and my house still smells like garlic... yumm

I've made this recipe many times and it is always a big hit. This time I tried using fresh spinach instead of frozen. I had 1/2 of a large bag leftover from something else so I removed the stems and chopped it as fine as I could. It worked great! I also added about 1 cup of sharp grated cheddar.

Loved this!  Couldn't find leek soup but I feel the lipton vegetable soup mix worked great.  I used 2 pkgs because I felt one wasnt flavorful enough.  I used about 3/4 of the spinach and I thought it was the best stuff I had ever eaten.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.  I am sure I will be making again soon.

Amazing! Made this for a New Year's party we wer going to. Everyone loved it, huge hit! Even my husband who is a picky eater and cannot stand spinach loved it. Like other reviewers I left out the water chestnuts to keep it simple for the party and added a bit more spinach (probably about 3/4 of the pkg) and it turned out fantastic!! Will definitely make again!!

Totally fantastic! I love this recipe, and so does everyone I've ever made it for! I always, always have to double the recipe because it goes so fast at parties. I go heavy on the spinach, but that's just personal preference. The leek soup mix is really key. It gives the dip that pefect spinach dip flavor that everyone loves! Thanks for sharing!

Fabulous!  As did others who rated this recipe, I used the whole pkg of spinach.  How happy was I that this 4.5-star rated recipe was truly a 5-star, and helped to make my Christmas party a success!

I used to be able to get the leek and potato soup mix, haven't been able to find it for a while so substitute with another dry soup mix, works well - adds more flavour.

I made this dish as an appetizer for a large Chrismtas party so I doubled the recipe. I, too, was unable to find dry leek soup so I substituted one package of onion soup mix and one of the vegetable mix which seemed to work perfectly.  I loved the crunchiness of the water chestnuts and the sourdough bowl is the perfect serving dish.  I will definitely make this again (hopefully with more time to find the right soup mix!).

I am making this recipe as part of our thanksgiving get together and it is so good, I can't stop eating it! I mad a few changes, I hate water chestnuts so I left that out, I used the whole box of spinach. make sure to get out as much water as possible! I also only used 1/2 cup of light mayo. I started out using less to see if it would taste alright and then was gone add more if it needed it but it didn't, a half cup mayo was just the right amount. The leek soup mix really made the flavors come together! Can't wait for everyone to try this!

I always make my spinach dip in a Hawaiin Sweet Bread bowl instead. It makes it best without the water chestnuts, and the whole box of frozen spinach as well!

Oh, this was definitely the best spinach dip I have ever eaten. I made it with a few changes, only because it was what I had on hand: half of a 16 oz bag of frozen cut spinach, 3/4 cup of real mayo, 12 oz container of sour cream, 1/4 cup of chopped green onions, with everything else staying the same. Since my husband and I don't care too much for sourdough bread, I picked up a multigrain bread from my local bakery. I could truly eat this everyday as a meal in itself... Absolutely divine!

Ok, this dip was easy to make and it turned out very tasty. I used dry leek soup and it turned out perfect. I didnt use bread casing but used regular saltine crackers for dipping.

This is my favorite spinach dip recipe!  I have been making it for years, got the same recipe from my aunt who got it off KNORRS VEGETABLE DIP SOUP MIX PKG, only you use th enitre package of frozen spinach (I generally let thaw and squeeze excess water off in package).  What makes it really a HIT?!  Shredded Chicken Breast eliminating the Water Chestnuts!!  DELICIOUS!!! I always get requests and raves on this one...

I have served this three times and received many compliments each time.  I do add the whole package of spinach-very well drained and cut back the mayo to 3/4 cup.  This is very yummy!

This recipe is similar to the one that I make which is served warm - though my recipe has a few different ingredients. I always use a combo of sourdough and pumpernickle breads for variety when serving spinach dip.

This turned out pretty good. However, when making again I wouldn't use sourdough. I would suggest King's Hawaiian bread (sweet bread). My local grocer didn't carry King's Hawaiian :( I would also suggest following the recipe and using dry leek soup mix. I experimented and used the Knorr's dry vegetable soup mix and didn't have much flavor.

Wonderful. I also cut back on the mayo to 3/4 cup. And I served it with bread and tortilla chips ( I preferred the chips) for the salty taste. Otherwise I made as directed and I loved it and so did my guest. It is very addictive/

I think that this is probably my favorite "cold" spinach dip recipe.  My only recommendation would be that some guests founf the leek flavor too strong, so I may cut down on how much of the soup mix I add next time.

YUMM-O! This was a HUGE fit at my cousins wedding shower. There was not a lick of even the bread left. I made this again at home, and my husband who doesnt even like spinach ate this up. Definitly go with the leek soup mix though, i just think this is that top it off ingredient!!

I used the leek soup and 16 oz of chopped spinach.  I dried it between two kitchen towels.  I used 3/4 cup Helman's Mayo and 16 oz sour cream and 4 oz water chestnuts.  Next time I will use 8 oz.  Added some parmesan (sprinkled mix well) and some garlic salt.  I let it  sit overnight in fridge and it was a huge hit!  Filled the round sourdough breadbowl twice and used the bread and trisquits.  A must dry!

Absolutely amazing recipe!!!! I made this as an appetizer last week and my company barely touched dinner after they filled up on this amazing spinach dip.
I ommitted the water chestnuts, as my husband doesn't care for them, and added some chopped green onion to spice it up a bit. Definetly a keeper. I think I will make it again this weekend for my friends. I've already shared this recipe with my mother in Germany and my sister in England, where spinach dip is not very common, and their company has already asked for the recipe.
I will make this over and over again!!!!

Absolutely fantastic! No one could stop eating this, and I have been 'told' that I must make it again for Christmas eve.
The only thing I added was some diced artichoke hearts and water chestnuts. Highly suggested!

Sooo good and easy to make. It's even better a few days later. I used reduced fat sour cream which was fine. I served it in the bread bowl but it's delicious with tortilla chips.

I used onion soup mix instead (because I couldn't find leek) and it was a total hit!  The bread bowl presentation really makes an impact and is totally easy to do.  I served it with multigrain tortilla chips for that extra crunch.  People thought I put some time into it but I really only prepped it while I got dressed for the party!

I made this with reduced fat sour cream and Smart Balance light mayo and it turned out beautifully. I, like many others, used the whole pack of spinach and I really think it could have more in there and still work. I don't think it'd work with just half a pack, though. I will make it many times over- great recipe!

This recipe is great!  I actually used vegetable soup mix as I could not find leek soup mix at any of my local grocery stores and it turned out excellent!  I added a little garlic salt, green onions and dried chopped onions and my coworkers are begging me to make it again.  Thanks so much for the awesome dip!

I made this recipe a few days before I intended to serve it.  At first it didn't look or taste appetizing and I was a little nervous about serving it.  However after sitting in the refrigerator a few days, it became really delicious.  now I can't get enough.  I added some roasted peppers and a spoonful or two of parmesan cheese.

made this for a class potluck. i couldn't find dry leek soup mix at the store i went to so i went with knorr's onion chive soup mix. i also omitted the water chestnuts and added the entire 10oz bag of spinach. i threw in some green onions to go with the flavor of the soup mix and it tasted SO GOOD. i can't imagine how much better the leek soup mix would make the dip but i'll definitely be on the lookout for it. thank you!

My friends raved about this recipe and said that it was the best spinach dip they ever had!  As other suggested, I used a whole package of spinach and it was perfect!

Had to leave out the water chestnuts, but this is great!  The leek soup really makes the dip. I used a 10 oz. pkg. of spinach and it's just right.  Definitely needs to chill overnight to blend the flavors.

This was good.....but not great.  Seems like it was missing something.  Garlic, maybe?  Anyhow, the family wasn't crazy over it.

This was really good! I ate it with tortilla chips instead of the loaf of sourdough. Next time I will make it with low fat mayo because it felt so sinful with the full fat mayo.

My husband made this recipe because we had spinach dip at our favorite restaurant, but this isn't it. The mayo was too much and gave it a strange taste. The mayo is a little different here in Australia so it just didn't work this recipe. We want the recipe with the cream cheese and parmasan cheese. This was a huge waste of money because two bites and we let it sit until it had to be thrown out. This might taste good with Hellmans mayo, but it just didn't work with what we have. Sorry.

So rich and delicious! We like to eat it with pita chips. Before, I was using a recipe with plain, nonfat yogurt. Mayo is WAY better, and I'm never going back!

This dip is way too sour. Also, the water chesnuts have a very strange crunch to them. I much prefer spinach dip with a cream cheese base. Try the Hot Artichoke and Spinach Dip II, also on this website. Far more gratifying!

Took this to a Super Bowl party and received rave reviews and it was consumed at amzing speed!  We used a sunflower bread (baked it for 15 minutes at 375 after hollowing out to make it firmer) and served it with crackers (not a fan of the bread bits).  The leek soup mix is what elevates this recipe waaay above the ordinary spinach dip. Thanks!

This spinach dip is the best that I have ever tried! I believe that the secret ingredient is the dry leek soup rather than the vegetable soup. I added diced red and yellow bell peppers for color and it presented beautifully in a fresh bread bowl.

This is a good old stand-by from the early 80's!  Can't find leek soup, make with Knorr's dry vegetable soup mix.  Always a hit at a party!

I made it for New Years Eve and everyone loved it. I only used it as a dip. I bought tortillas and cut them into triangles and fried them into tortilla chips and used it for scooping the dip.

This IS the best spinach dip ever! My guests on Christmas couldn't get enough. I used an Italian round bread, I didn't have any sourdough. I also used about 3/4 of the spinach package. It just needed a little extra. Also, I served with a few types of crackers. I will definately double the recipe next time. But probably skip the bread bowl even though it made a nice presentation.

Made this recipe because of the addition of the leek soup and the good reviews of other tasters.  HUGE hit at an office party, the leek soup really made a big difference.  This recipe is really good just the way it is, however I may try less mayo & sourcream next time or more spinach just to make it thicker.  Thanks for the recipe.

We had some friends over for cocktails and appetizers last night and everyone loved this dip.  They said it was the best spinach dip they had ever had.  I also made Mississippi Six in a bread bowl (can be found on allrecipes) and they went crazy over it, too.  You may want to try them together.  Thanks, Shawna, for the recipe!

Very Good. Added some crumbled bacon that I crisped in the microwave and some chopped red pepper to make it more festive to the top only.  Also surrounded with some red and green swirled Italian bread cubes that our store has during the Christmas season. Beautiful presentation.

Great recipe...I added more spinach and also used lowfat sour cream and mixed reg & lowfat mayo, no one can tell the difference. I still think it tastes better if you use the knorr leek soup mix, instead of the veg. soup mix.

This is a great spinach dip. I have to say, it is the exact recipe on the back of the Knorr vegetable soup mix box, only with a different soup mix. Personally, I think it's better with the veg soup mix.  The green onion the veg soup calls for puts in the taste of the leek soup. I'm sorry, but I already have this recipe and Knorr veg soup makes it better.

An excellent spinach dip!  I added an entire 8oz can of water chestnuts and the entire 10oz of frozen spinach.  Next time I think I will add another half package of spinach (total of 15oz).  We like more spinach in our dip.  My husband said it was a little too creamy for him.  I will make this again!

No lie - the best spinach dip I've ever had.  Super quick, dirt cheap, and with a couple loaves of French bread on the side it will feed a small army of snackers.  I forgot the water and the water chestnuts and it still got rave reviews from everyone who got a bite!

I often make this recipe and just throw in a bowl. The water chestnuts give it an extra nice crunch, but the flavor isn't adversely affected if you don't have any on hand. Easy and tasty, my favorite kind of recipe!

This was awesome! First time I've ever made spinach dip and everyone at the party raved about it and some wanted the recipe.  I used a whole box of spinach, the Knorr veg soup mix,and omitted the water chestnuts. I also used the recipe for the Portuguese Sweet Bread like another reviewer on this site suggested.  Superb!

Always turns out great!  This is what I always bring to parties, and it goes fast!  Be sure to use the leek soup because I tried it with the onion soup and it just was not right.  If you cant find dry leek soup, instead of using dry onion soup, go with dry vegetable soup.

this recipe was very good but the spinach i think should be chopped as well.  I left out the water chestnuts and it was still tasty.

This came out very good, everyone likes it a lot.  I agree on more spinach.  Next time I might try some chopped yellow or red bell pepper for crunch and color.

Wow!  This was so easy and delicious!  I doubled the water chestnuts for more crunch.  The hard part was finding the leek soup mix.  I finally found it at Safeway (Knorr's).  I sprinkled a little salt over the spinach to draw out the liquid and then squeezed it (after waiting about 1/2 hour) and that worked really well.

It was easy and well- received, but I tripled the amount of spinach ( for color mostly.) Next time I will try light mayo ( whipped dressing is too tangy) and add more water chestnuts. Very good though!

i made this dip thinking that it would be great. it wasn't. i agree with another reviewer that it has way too much mayo, however it could be that i used whipped dressing not mayo. i may try it again.

Awesome!!!  My mom and I are usually the only ones in our family that love spinach--but EVERYONE was lapping this dish up!  I added a 4 oz. can of pimento to this--and it was great.  My poor friend, she came over with store bought dip, and NO ONE touched it!  This is a great recipe!

I used vegetable soup instead of leek and I think that was the problem.. maybe?  My boyfriend and I found this very bland. I will try to liven it up at a later date.

Way to much sour cream for me.  Next time I'll reduce it & see how it goes.  I also prefer a thicker dip & I did add another pkg of spinach but it was just to "watery"  I think this recipe has great potential with some revising for my own satisfaction.

This is the Best!  The only thing I changed was to add one full package (10oz) of spinach (vs. the 1/2 of package like the recipe suggested).  I just felt it wasn't enough spinach for my likings.  I too served it with sourdough bread.

This spinach dip was fantastic.  I made it for a meeting I went to and everyone asked for the recipe.  I did use the entire package of spinach instead of half.  I will definately add this one to my recipe book and make it again.

This is the best spinach dip ever!  I served it at Thanksgiving and it was gone before all the guests even arrived and now I'm making it again for Christmas Eve at everyone's request.  Easy to make, too!

Best ever says it all!!  I loved it (as did all my party guests), and I don't eat anything with mayonnaise.  Luckily, I didn't put all of the dip out at the party.  So, I enjoyed the "leftovers" for breakfast and lunch the next day.  I will be making this recipe for years to come!!

A great recipe.  I used all the spinach as was suggested and that's the way to go!  I also used Triscuits (Vegetable) instead of bread.  It was a great combination too!

This stuff is great! Very addicting. We make it almost every month now and STILL it's excellent. I was hesitant about the water chestnuts, but they add a great crunch. It's perfect the way it is.

This recipes was exactly what I was looking for. I served it our annual Formula 1 BBQ (in Montreal) and it was a real hit. My guests loved it. The only thing was it was hard not to pick at it through the night. I used the whole box of spinach. Thanks!!

I loved this dip. I thought it was easy and delicious. I changed it a little by adding double the spinach (the whole box). I have already made it for a couple of parties and everyone loves it.

Great Recipe!!!  I doubled the recipe for a superbowl party, and it was gone before the game was over!  I did have trouble finding Leek soup mix?  I used one packet of onion and also one of vegetable soup mix.  Still excellent.  Highly recommend for any type of gathering.

A really big with the family at Christmas.  Squeezing the excess liquid from the spinach is key.  Will definately make this again.

This is just perfection.  Made it for years and then for some reason kind of forgot about it. Started making it again recently and people just go nuts. I give the recipe to everyone.  The Leek dry soup mix is a must. Don't expect the Onion or Vegetable mix to give you the same result. And yes, as others have said, use the whole box of spinach. Just make sure to drain it well.

Excellent flavor! I used sautéed fresh spinach and omitted the water chestnuts, as I forgot to buy them.  I really liked using the leek soup mix as opposed to the vegetable or onion soup mix.  This was fantastic as a veggie dip! The end result was like a thin dressing- I probably should have squeezed more liquid out of the spinach- so I blended in some cream cheese and that helped thicken it up some more.  Really liked this - will make it again!

I've made spinach dip with the vegetable soup and leek soup mixes. I really prefer the veggie soup. The leek soup mix made it taste far too much like onion dip. I also prefer my dip with more spinach.

Great! I’ve had this at other people’s homes and finally wanted to make it myself. I used the whole package of spinach and it was fine. Warning: Makes a LOT of dip. It filled a whole large mayo jar as well as a cereal bowl that I used to serve the first visitors on day one of Christmas entertaining. Yum!

I wasn't happy with this. I followed it every step exactly except for the bread bowl. 
Hardly anyone ate it. All you tasted was spinach and sour cream. It had no body of flavor. Very disappointed. I even kicked it up a notch with the left over I brought home. I dumped a ton of onion powder in it. That made it a little more flavorful.

Absolutely the best spinach dip recipe I have ever tasted. Don’t substitute the leek soup mix. Water chestnuts in the dip are wonderful.

I LOVE this recipe, restaurant style quality and my go-to for potlucks, bbqs and friend gatherings. I add a few diced canned artichokes for some amazing flavour and added creamy-ness. It's good as a cold dip or shred some cheese on top and bake it for a warm appetizer with toaster pita bread slices.

Except I use water chestnuts and NO leeks, I use green onion instead...didn't care for the leeky taste lol. I also add an 8oz pkg of softened cream cheese and bring EXTRA BREAD. This recipe w/the Liption (brand/generic) Onion Soup Mix  is ALWAYS A WINNER. Several times SOMEONE asks to take the whole bread bowl w/left overs in it. TOP COMPLIMENT TO ME!!

Wish I had read the reviews first. I love the taste but the texture not so much. Next time I will def add more spinach and water chestnuts or less mayo and sour cream to make it thicker.

This is really good.  If you want to kick it up another notch, squeeze a bit of lemon juice in it, it brightens it up in a very good way.  You may also substitute the leek soup with Norrs vegtable soup mix, that's just as good.

I always make this when I  get chips on sale.  Mine is basically like the original but with a little twist that I'm going to share with you.  When it comes to sour cream and mayo keep the same and add some Greek plain yogurt to the mix and if you can find it.. dried spinach.  And of course let it set will not be watered down.  The yogurt gives more health and a zip to it.  Your welcome.

I added red onions, and swapped the sour cream for Greek yogurt. I also lessened the amount of  it, so there's a bigger ratio of spinach.

This recipe is very good. I added extra water chestnuts and the whole 10 ounce bag of spinach. Are used olive oil mayonnaise and about half of the package of leak soup mix. That still gave it plenty of flavor and it wasn’t overpowering. This is the second time I’ve made it. The first time I followed the recipe exactly. I prefer it with a little less of the leak soup mix.

Really easy.  Not much left when 5 people dug into it which is a sign it is really that good.  I let it sit in the fridge for about 6 hours which seemed have blended the flavors just right.  The toasted bread pieces from the sour dough round were disappointing but some crisp crackers saved the day.

Yep, this is the EXACT recipe we've all had at every church function growing up! I made it for a little gathering of friends along with another dip and this one was completely gone by the end (the other one not so much). Definitely a keeper! I used the entire box of spinach and Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.

love it! Instead of sour cream, i use nonfat cream cheese. It gives a richer flavor, but you don't have to wring out the water from the spinach, so its quicker. Definitely let sit overnight for better flavor.

I love this recipe.  I've used it for years and always requested.  I defrost the frozen spinach and wrap it with paper towels and wring the liquid out.  I chop the chestnuts and throw it all together.  There's never enough sour dough bread so I get 2 sour dough bagels and cut them down the middle into quarters.  Then I cut each long piece with scissors.  Much faster and every piece has some crust on it.  Sour dough bread is the only bread to use.  Just like the mayo, never salad dressing.

Hard not to enjoy something that's all cheese and sour cream. I did not see the leek soup mix at the store so I used garlic and it was still delicious. Will use leek next time if I ever find it.

This is a great recipe but I do make some changes to make it my own. I cook then cool the spinach to bring out the taste and I substitute peeled chopped APPLES for the water chestnuts.

I cannot use the leek soup mix or Knorr vegetable soup mix which I love as I they contain gluten. So I made a revision to this recipe. I chopped a small carrot into minced pieces and sauted in olive oil until soft. This equaled 1 Tbsp. As it cooled I added 1/2 tsp Mrs. Dash Tomato Basil Garlic, 1/4 tsp onion powder and 1/8 tsp salt. Next time I will add a tsp of minced sun dried tomato.

The leek soup mix adds depth of flavor compared to the other soup mix traditionally used in spinach dip.  This is my go-to appetizer now. Instead of mayo I substitute cream cheese and get really good feedback on the taste.

The tip to use a potato ricer to squeeze water from frozen spinach works like a charm!

I will definitely make it again.  The hostess of the party that I made this for couldn't quit complimenting me on it - best spinach dip she ever had.  There were about 6 teens there that devoured it.  Easy and delicious.  Made it just as described.

Mmmmmm...My store didn't have the Leek soup so I used the Vegetable Knorr Soup. It's only sat for about three hours, so I tried and it's delicious. It makes a bunch and is so yummy. Thanks!  Oh, I added three green onions since I couldn't use the Leek Soup.

Add one FINELY chopped clove of Garlic, 1/4 c. fine diced red pepper, Half of a teaspoon of fresh cracked black pepperscorns, and finally, swap out 3 tablespoons of mayonnaise with 3 tablespoons Miracle Whip (this is the knock out punch).
That is all. Its a secret. Tell people its a secret. you'll be spinach dip gods!

Added some shredded mozzarella cheese.  It was good but pretty mild in the flavor profile.  Would add more onion and minced garlic to taste, depending on the strength of the soup mix used.  Cayenne pepper and a bit of Cumin add some nice depth.  A good template, all in all.

Will make again, adjusting as the mood strikes.

Used about a cup each of mayo and sour cream along with 8 oz cream cheese. Full package of spinach and only half of the Knorr leek soup. 4 oz can of water chestnuts.  Also added a bit of grated Romano and Parmesan, and some fresh ground pepper. Very good, will make again.

Love this version. Sometime it's hard to find leek soup mix, but Knorr makes a great one. We cut the mayo by 1/2 and (believe it or not) use two boxes of spinach. We found that when all the water is removed thoroughly, it doesn't yield a very large amount. Tip: keep the empty sour cream container and split the recipe between your serving dish/bread and the empty container. Easier clean up and great to pull out cold for an anticipated round two!

This dip was delicious! I made it exactly as written except I used vegetable mix instead of leek mix because my store was out of the leek soup. I am excited to try it with the leek soup but it was so fantastic even with the veggie mix I know I can’t go wrong either way. I served it with triscuits and everyone couldn’t get enough of it!!!

This was very good! It makes a lot more than I expected. I bought one round pumpernickel. It definitely needed at least twice that. I was not able to find the dry leek soup mix, only cream of leek, and as I was unsure whether that substitute would work, I did what other reviewers had recommended and substituted Knorr dry vegetable soup mix. It tasted delicious anyway. Next time, I will try the cream of leek mix - maybe the texture will be smoother. I used a non name brand light mayo and light sour cream. No problem there. I did not include the water chestnuts, as I don't keep them on hand. As other reviewers suggested, I used the whole 10 oz package of frozen spinach.

I added 2 packages of frozen spinach and 1/2 a package of dry vegetable soup mix to all the other ingredients. It was awesome.

Eating frozen spinach without cooking it can lead to food poisoning. It's not intended to be eaten before cooking. Please remove from the recipe the "wonderful" idea that it takes less time to make if you use frozen spinach. DON'T USE FROZEN SPINACH or you may end up in the hospital with serious food poisoning.

This was SO good, everyone loved it! (made for a party) 
I also used the whole box of frozen spinach and a can of diced water chestnuts. I couldn't find the Leek soup mix (after trying at 2 different stores) so I used Knorr's Vegetable soup mix and it worked very well. Served this inside a bread bowl. This will be my go to recipe for spinach dip from here on out. Thanks for sharing!

It’s the dip recipe from my youth! I ran out of mayo, so I substituted about 1/3 cup of cream cheese to finish up for what I didn’t have...worked out just fine!

Delicious! The only change was using a full package of spinach (300 grams), and it wasn’t too much.  Will definitely be making this again.

Baked it by accident (habit I guess) and still great! Modified recipe by using full 10oz package of spinach and leek soup in place of onion. Well balanced and lots of flavor. Will make again.

This is a great and easy recipe.  I couldn't find leek soup mix so I used Knorr vegetable mix and about a 1/4 C dried minced onions. I drained most the water from the spinach. It was a favorite.

I have used this recipe for years. A friend gave it to me about 20 yrs ago. It's the best Spinach Dip I have ever had. But, I also use the entire 10 box of  chopped spinach.
If you can't find Leek Soup Mix, go online to soups .com and you can get it there. I buy Knorr's brand. Have never seen any other brand but they may be out there.

This recipe goes way back and is 5 stars if you add 1/4 cup chopped green onions, 1 tea. dry Italian salad dressing and 1/2 tea. dill and an entire package of chopped spinach. Make sure the spinach is cooked a bit and very, very well drained.

I quite enjoyed this, although I did make a change. I put in about 3/4's of the package of spinach and it still needs more, next time I'll just use the entire package.

This was easy, quick and good.  However, I didn't add the water chestnuts because I wasn't sure everyone would like them.  I also added the whole whole box of spinach.  Otherwise, if you don't it looks and tastes like a garnish.

This is the best spinach dip!!  Based on some other reviews I added the entire package of spinach.  I served it in a bread bowl after refrigerating overnight and it was a HUGE hit.  My 20 year old son couldn't get enough of it and asked when we were making more.   This will definitely be a dip we will go back to again and again!

The leek soup mix in this works great.  The dip is wonderful and always devoured with glee. I doubled the amount of spinach, which I recommend.

I was never a fan of spinach dip but someone asked me to make some for a party and I came across this recipe. I add chopped carrots and the full box of spinach and  lessen the sour cream to 1 cup(so it's thicker) and serve with everthing bagels. Always a hit there is never any left!!

I've made this for years Except - I'm not crazy about strong onion flavor.  So instead of Leek or Onion, I have always used a full pkg of spinach, 1pkg of Knorrs Spring dressing mix, and a dash of lemon pepper.  I serve it in a bread bowl, and there is never any left.

I did use onion soup mix & a 16 oz. bag of frozen spinach (very well-drained) and the dip was excellent.  Tastiest served with crackers or the recommended bread(s), rather than with veggies.

Passable. 

(+) easy to make
(+) definitely good, but not great

(-) the packet takes over the dish.  this reminds me of the old onion soup packet and sour cream chip dip
(-) makes too much - this is more of  a party portion
(-) not enough spinach to dairy ratio.  Next time I will cut the dairy in half and leave out the soup mix.

Loved it! Totally plan on using this as a base and customising it the next round!! Super tasty and way better than store bought!! I definitely recommend using the whole box of spinach though as half would not have been enough.

The BEST spinach dip EVER, Amazing and it will be the one I will be making from now on!! SO thick, creamy, crunchy and fresh, and the taste is a wow sooo good!!!  Why look for another one!!! Really just TOP Recipe!! I made few changes because I don't like a lot of mayo. I used 1/2 cup mayo, and a whole can of 8oz water chestnuts.  Also make sure you drain the spinach really really good or it will make your recipe runny!! I made it the night before Easter and I LOVE IT!!!!!!! It is AMAZING, and everyone loved it too, I had to ask them to stop eating it to save room for dinner...lol..Very good Easter day!!!

I love this dip. It's one of my go-tos for parties and it's always a hit and so easy to make. Definitely recommend using the whole package of spinach. I also use low fat sour cream and sometimes low fat mayo and still turns out great. I can never find dry leek soup mix at my grocery store so I use vegetable soup mix and it works great.

Great dip! I used 1/2 the mayo listed and I couldn't find leek soup in my area, so had to substitute for vegetable soup. I also doubled the spinach. It turned out delicious.

I used extra sour cream, toasted almonds and added Dijon, Tony Tchatcheties and Tapatio hot sauce. I also used onion soup, couldn't find leek, only use about ½ pack. Out skittle in Tate and adjust. Definitely make ahead and let it sit so the flavored blend.

Everyone loves this dip! I do omit the water chestnuts because I am not partial to the crunch. I also use about 20oz of spinach. I never have any left over when I bring to parties and everyone wants the recipe.  Love it with sourdough, have also found it is a great dip for pretzel crisps ( the thin, flat pretzels). I will never stop making this delicious dip!

Made this more times than I can tell, just taking the time to post this. Many recipes out there but the LEEK soup mix is a MUST to make it taste like this. People will ask why yours tastes better than others....this is why! Rye bread is good too. Make the night before for best flavor.

Used the whole box of spinach and leek soup mix, was a little tricky to find but I did. Also used a 8oz can of water chestnuts (all I could find). Chopped them up small. Was a hit. Definitely let it  meld together overnight.

I didn't make this recipe but gave 3 stars out of respect to the submitter.    This is the recipe found on the back of Knorrs Vegetable Recipe mix pack.  It is the bomb when made with Vegetable dip mix.  As written in this recipe, Leek mix aka Onion, appears to be the problem stemming from a lot of negative reviews.   The best choice for this dip is the Vegetable Mix  which is probably why Knorrs chose to put it on the back of the Vegetable package instead of the Leek SOUP package.   Good recipe, wrong mix for a spinach dip.

Will definitely make again.  I used Knorr's dried vegetable soup mix instead of the leek soup....and I also used the whole box of spinach drained very dry....I have made it for years  and everybody loves it!

Delicious!  I made a few changes based on what I had on hand.  I am not a huge fan of water chestnuts so left those babies out.  I did not have Leek soup but had vegetable soup and that was just as delicious.  I am certainly going to make this again! It is a must try.

For more kick use Knorr Leek Soup mix and 1/2 cup each of mayonnaise and horseradish mayonaise. A dream come true!

Absolutely love this!! I made as is and I haven't had anyone not like it. After making it i personally like it with less spinch but thats a preference. I get requests to bring this to every party I am invited to. The water chestnuts give it a nice little crunch. I find the flavor goes great with thin pita crisps. KEEPER!

People just gobble this up, very good! I'm giving four stars because  I use an 8 oz can of water chestnuts- and the whole box of spinach, so it's probably thicker than intended, but can't imagine it would be as flavorful any other way. We used sourdough bread, which was great - also great with a more hearty loaf of bread - like rye. The bread runs out fast, so we served with whole grain crackers on the side, but you could also cut up some extra bread.  Really tasty, try it!

Excellent recipe, thank you! The leek soup mix is perfect. I've tried vegetable dip, onion soup but none of these really bring this recipe better flavor. I refuse, in fact, to ever make this unless I have leek soup mix. It makes that much of a difference! And allowing it to sit, helps also.

Have made this several times and just brought it to a cookout for the 4th of July. Everyone always loves it. This makes a lot of dip. Today I used the leftovers as a base for tuna salad. It was great!

I like the original recipe, but have changed it over time. My variation includes the whole package of spinach, and substitute 1 8oz pkg cream cheese for the mayonnaise. I use 1/2 cup finely chopped celery in place of the water chestnuts, and a couple dashes of tabasco. Thin the mixture with a couple tablespoons of milk if needed.
If there's any left I always have volunteers to take the remainder home.

I followed the suggestions of other reviewers by using a whole package of frozen spinach (well drained) and I only used 3/4 cup of Hellmann's mayonnaise and 1/2 of the sour cream called for in the recipe. The leek soup mix is definitely a key ingredient. I didn't have water chestnuts but I happened to have jicama and that worked very well. I left in the fridge for only 4 hours and it was still awesome. I served it with fresh baked bagel chips.... gone in less than 15 minutes.

I made this quite a few times and we love it.  I made it with and without the water chestnuts.  Either way is delish!  Yum!!

It can also be made with Vegetable Soup Mix instead of Leek.  Very good!

I tried this recipe for the first time today and it is fantastic!!! However, I did leave out the water chestnuts and also used less of the leek soup mix than called for.  I think a full package is way too much for a single recipe.  I doubled the recipe and used a full package of leek soup plus a couple of table spoons of the second package.  Also it's important to use good mayonnaise of which I use the kind with Olive oil.  I will be taking this to the Fourth of July party tomorrow.  Thank you for this great recipe.

Flavor was great. I used fresh spinach and found that I needed about double what the recipe called for to make the consistency we like.

Only spinach dip I'll ever make.  Even my extremely picky 2-year old liked it! I used Onion Soup mix instead of Leek, left out the water chestnuts, and served it with multigrain tortilla chips.

Yep-this is the best ever...Leek soup mix is the trick. So tired of the Knorr dip-I omitted water chestnuts only because my family doesn't like them-added green onions to taste - but the dip is wonderful without any changes !

I made this last night for a home party I was having and I could not have more pleased with it!  SO many raves and 4 people even asked for the recipe!  The only thing I did extra was add a TBSP of fresh minced garlic.  I'll definitely be making this for the upcoming holiday season!  THANKS for a great recipe!

I've been making this dip for years and everyone loves it.  It is indeed the Best Spinach Dip Ever.

DELICIOUS!! All my guests asked if it was store bought and then immediately asked for the recipe.  It was super easy to prepare and so so good.  I ended up using a Knorr's vegetable dip mix because the store we went to didn't have the leeks mix.  

My husband is not a big fan of mayo, so i might try it with hummus next time, we'll see how much it'll change the taste.  

But definitely 5 stars all the way!!

I love spinach dip and have always made it with the vegetable soup mix. This is an even better variation. I used 10 oz of spinach, I think 5 would have been far too little. It got devoured at my son's birthday party and everyone was talking about it. Great recipe!

This was a hit at the Superbowl party! I sauteed fresh spinach and instead of using chopped frozen spinach.  It turned out great! I think the dry leek soup mix made all the difference.

very good. I added a few things just to expirement. I could not find the leek soup mix. So I used the Knorr vegatable soup mix. I also used 2 packages of spinach. It makes it thicker which I like. I added 4 green onions and a pound o cooked bacon. Also a tablespoon of fresh garlic and salt and pepper. I served it with pita chips rather thatn the sourdough bread.

I love this recipe! I have never found dry leek soup mix so I've used cream of leek or vegetable instead.  Both delicious! My mom has asked me a few times now to make it and bring it for family dinners.  Thanks for sharing :-)

very good spinach dip.  The leak soup is definitely key to this recipe and the water chestnuts gave it a nice little crunch.  I would make again.

My family has made this for years.  The only difference in our recipe is that we use Knorr's Vegetable Soup mix instead of the Leek Soup mix, and we use a round loaf of Hawaiian bread instead of sourdough.

I use this recipe and always get rave reviews from those that I make it for.  I make a few variations, I use more spinach then the recipe calls for. I use 15 ozs (about 1 and 1/2 packages of frozen spinach).  I make sure to squeeze out the excess water.  I don't use the water chestnuts or the Leek Soup.  I use dry vegetable soup mix and I add about 3 green onions chopped up well.  As for the bread bowl, I use Kings Hawaiian bread bowl.  It has a sweet taste and is a GREAT with the spinach dip. This is a sure fire hit for any occasion and won't last long once you serve it.

Really good... but of course I must modify.  Used dry onion (couldn't find leek) soup.  One of the pkgs in the box.  Used whole bag (12 oz) of spinach, and whole can (8 oz) of chestnuts.  Added extra cup of MAYO.  Tasted mighty good!  One tip/hint:  though the spinach was already chopped, I should have chopped further.  Will do it on next batch, which I'm sure will happen tomorrow...

I made this as an appetizer on Thanksgiving and the entire family LOVED it.  I have been asked several times since then to make it again.  It was so easy to make and tastes delicious.  It is definately a keeper for the family and will be made again and again!

I read all the great reviews so tried it. It was ok. Husband didn't really like it. Maybe it was the chestnuts...not sure he liked the crunch. I liked it but felt it needed a little more flavor. If I make again i might add some garlic or more powder mix. It was good not superb in my book.

Love, love, love this dip!   Usually I stick to the recipe, but last time on a whim I doubled the spinach (a whole bag instead of a half) and it still turned out great. So don't be afraid to add more spinach!

I've been making this for several years now, and it is still a big hit.  My husband loves to eat the bread bowl after a day or two in the fridge, when the leftovers have really sunken into the bread. I'm asked for the recipe almost every time I make it.

without a doubt, it lives up to its name.  I made this for Thanksgiving and it was immediately requested it be served again at Christmas!  The Leek Soup is the key!!

We love this reciepe too I use a whole box+ of spinach and but my husband hates water chestnuts so I chop around 5-6 green onions and add those makes it yummy- leek soup mix is definetly better than the vegtable soup.

I have made this dip a couple of times and it is GREAT!  I don't like onions so  the leek soup mix is a great alternative to onion soup.  Everyone who ate it loved it.   I will definitely be making it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I  have been making this recipe for over 10 years!! They actually used to print this recipe on the back of the Knorr Leek Soup mix box...it's been a hit every time I make it and is expected at every family party, BBQ, etc. I don't like mayo too much, so i only put a 2-3 tablespoons in the mix and it works just fine. If I want to be healthy I'll sub sour cream for Greek Yogurt..a few of my friends have tried that and said it tastes the same. Try this recipe! You won't regret it!

i love how easy this is to prepare! compliments every time i've brought this to a pot luck are a bonus. at work, if i don't have written down that i'll be bringing this in, it's requested! i do use a full package of spinach. and instead of sourdough bread, i serve with yellow corn tortilla chips.

This is the first dip I've ever made and although I made a few changes, I really enjoyed it!  I added minced garlic and cream cheese for extra flavour, as well as adding extra spinach and a little less sour cream & mayo, as other people had suggested.  I left everything in the fridge overnight and found the flavours had come together quite nicely - I'll definitely make this dip again.

I've been making this dip for almost every get-together the past year, and it's always the first thing to run out. I use a Hawaiian bread loaf, and usually some ritz crackers, too. Today I'm trying it using a bag of fresh spinach, chopped... looks great so far!

Love this dip.  Crave it and makes me feel like it is healthy with the spinach in the dip.  I use fresh spinach and add as much as looks colorful.  I also add plenty of water chestnuts... love the extra crunch.  Makes a TON!  Definately something you bring to a big party.

I made it for my book club and it was a hit.  Really good!  I use the Rye Beer Bread recipe in this site to make a bread bowl and it was perfect.  I also used the whole package of spinach as many others recommended.

This recipe is fantastic!  The only thing I would add is extra Water Chestnuts. I bought an 8oz. can and added half which the recipe called for. I should have added entire can.  I also chopped them up a little to spread it around. I would definitely recommed making this recipe!

This was good and easy to make. I let sit overnight and still didnt have too much taste though. I used a whole box of frozen spinach- that was the only change.

Made for my Bunco Club and it was a hit!! I used a whole box of spinach as previous reviews stated (can't imagine it with less).  Other than that didn't change a thing.  Will definitely go in my favorite recipe file!

I made it last night to take to a Super Bowl party today and right after I made it I didn't really like it because the leek soup taste was so strong but I let it sit overnight and today I couldn't get enough of it! The only change I made was to use the whole 10 oz. of spinach. It was awesome!

My sister-in-law requested I bring one of these spinach dip-stuffed-bread-bowls to Christmas Eve dinner and I had never done one before. Usually I spruce up recipes, but I was too short on time for that this time around. So, I followed the recipe almost to a "T" and it was outstanding. I used just slightly more water chestnuts because I had a 6 oz can and didn't see why I should throw away the extra 2 oz and also I squeezed ALL the liquid from the spinach and used the whole 10 oz box, and I was glad I did. In the past when I've tried these dips, I usually wasn't too impressed, so I didn't have very high hopes for this. But, this really was outstanding. It got lots of compliments...and i was nibbling the leftovers as I stuffed stocking all night! Thanks!

I was a little nervous about making this dip because of the mayo but it was pretty good. I used light mayo and light sour cream. I added shredded romano cheese and used Lipton's onion soup mix because I couldn't find leek soup mix. I'll make this again!

This recipe is super easy to make.  My aunt and cousin came down from California and gave us this recipe. We all fell in love with it.  I made it again for my other side of the family who i didn't think would be too fond of spinach dip - they ate all of it. Really Good.

The title lives up to its name... the  Best Spinach Dip Ever! 

I didn't have any water chestnuts on hand. I used the entire package of spinach. The dip was very tasty and creamy.  I used 1 1/2 cups of fat free sour cream (which is all I had. ha!) and I only use Miracle Whip.  Great recipe!

I just joined AllRecipes.com mainly so I could write a review for this awesome dip! So THAT should tell you something! I tried finding the Leek soup in 3 different stores and no one had it, so I had to sub it with the veggie mix and it turned out amazinggg! Tripled the spinach and dried it with paper towels. My people LOVED it and they've already asked for the recipe! Thanksss! :)

I have been making this recipe for several years (found recipe at a demonstration at the Albertson's Food Chain) after trying recipe after recipe for spinach dip that was not sucessful. The leek soup is a must and I also add just a bit of finely chopped or even grated onion. Always get rave reviews.

I made this as a Christmas dinner appetizer.  I put it in a round loaf of pumpernickel bread.  The mayo taste was a bit overwhelming for me so next time I might add more sour cream and less mayo.  Also, some parm cheese might be a nice added kick.

Excellent!  I had a small gathering, so I halved the recipe but doubled the spinach.  Used lite sour cream and lite mayonnaise.  It was perfect.

This was really good, I bought fresh spinach and used about half the bundle.  I also added a clove of garlic for extra zing.  It was definitely runny but it worked alright with crackers and we'll make it again.  Next time we'll just use less liquids and see if we can make it a little more solid.  But it was super easy to make and quick.

A hit at the office potluck!  I used the whole 10 oz box of spinach and added a bit of Cavenders Greek Seasoning (because I add it to everything}.  DELICIOUS!

I had never made this with water chestnuts before. They do add a crunch to it, but I liked it. I put it in a Hawaiian Sweet Bread bowl. It is by far may favorite way to serve it. I also used the whole package of spinach and onion soup because I could not find leek. It does need to be made at least a day before so the flavors will have a chance to blend together.

The old, basic standby. Great at parties; everyone loves it. I use a tad more mayo, Knorr's veggie soup mix, and the WHOLE box of spinach. Yum!

Followed the recipe for the most part- used light sour cream instead.  My boyfriend wanted me to make some.  Can't say I was really impressed by it and neither was he.   It tasted like dip and I have so much left over I'll probably end up throwing away.

Everyone loves this dip, you have to use the Leek Soup(not vegetable). Make it early so the flavors can blend, so yummy...thanks.

This recipe is so easy and simply delicious.  I took this to a USC tailgate and it was literally gone in 2 minutes.  The only thing I changed about the recipe was I used the whole 10 oz bag of frozen spinach.

Eh.  It was ok, don't know about Best Ever.  Couldn't find the dry leek soup mix so I had to use dry onion.  Guess its pretty good as far as spinach dip goes, maybe a little too sour for my tastes.

Excellent.  Marinated in fridge for 24 hours.  I also doubled the recipe but only used 24oz sour cream.  Served with Sweet bread and scoops. (Yum)

I agree with the title.  I love a good spinach dip, and this is surely one of the best.  Took it to a going-away party and it was gone in record time.  Thanks for the recipe, Shawna.

Yum!  Made this for a retirement party (doubled the batch) and it was so good!  Made a few adjustments - I wasn't able to find the leek soup so I used Knorr Vegetable Soup mix and I omitted the water chestnuts just because they're not my favorite...it was still very good.  The only thing I was disappointed with was the fact that there was none left over to bring home!!

I made this for Superbowl Sunday in a Rye bread bowl (flavor combination was excellent).  I used a whole 10 oz. package of frozen spinach instead of a half because it seemed to mayonaisey with just a half a package and spinach is good for you anyway.  This was the BEST spinach dip.  There was not even a crumb left on the plate, in fact, I think one of our guests LICKED the plate but never admitted to it.

Absolutely awesome.  I could not find the dry leek soup, so I had to substitute for a different soup... but it was absolutely wonderful.  I took this dip to my family's Super Bowl party and it was gone.  I also used a loaf of rye bread instead of sourdough.  I love rye bread, so this substitution was a no-brainer.  Great dip that I will make again!!

I loved this recipe! I served it at a get-together and it was gone in 5 minutes! I did not add as much mayo as called for (just a little bit less). Also, the grocery store here did not carry leek soup mix, so I used veggie, but it still turned out wonderful. I served with tortilla chips (restaraunt-style, thin) and it was the perfect complement.

The taste was good, but the amount of mayo and sour cream made it kind of watery.  Next time I will definitly use less!  Otherwise, it was a good tasting dip.

Very good dip. I used a whole 8oz can of water chestnuts and a full 10oz box of spinach. The leek flavor is great with the crunch of the water chestnuts. I did serve in a large pumpernickle bowl and it filled it perfectly I also added some dry little bread crisps. Very yummy!!

delicious! I made this with nayonnaise (which doesn't have egg) and I couldn't find dry leek soup so I used Lipton Vegetable Soup instead. It probably would have been heartier with Hellman's mayo but I loved it anyway. SO tasty with a good bread.

D E L I C I O U S!!!  I used KRAFT real mayo, it tastes better than Hellman's IMO. 
I added chopped green onion and I did NOT leave out the chestnuts since it really does make the difference.  I also had to double the recipe so I use dry leek AND vegetable soup mix (both Knorr's) very good!! I tried one with just leek, very good too!  Great Job Shawna!

My husband is not a fan of spinach dip, but he liked this one (probably because it doesn't have a lot of spinach in it). I used Knorr herb soup mix instead of leek, and aioli instead of plain mayo.

This was so easy and so good. Definitely add more spinach to the original recipe -- I used a 15 oz. bag of frozen spinach and it was great. Next time I want to try with  lowfat sour cream and mayo.

Very, very tasty.  Per other reviews, I also added 4oz. of softened cream cheese to the mixture.  Chilling is very crucial for taste development, so don't skip it!  Highly recommended.

Thanks for this recipe!  I used it on Roasted Garlic Triscuits (I highly recommend these crackers for this dip) and it was amazing.  I gave some to the SO and she took it to work.  Her co-workers couldn't stop eating it and she got a lot of praise for it.  Thanks again!

This spinach dip is awesome! My boyfriend uses this recipe when it's his day to bring a snack at work...and everyone raves about it. I also recommend throwing in the whole thing of spinach.

For a cold spinach dip, this is quite tasty.  Like many others, I too added doubled the amount of spinach.  Tastes great, thanks for sharing.

Very good.  Broil for the last couple of minutes of cooking to brown the top.  It's also plenty cheesey with less mozz on top.

This was fabulous!  I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone LOVED it!!  I couldn't find the dry leek soup, so I used Lipton Golden Onion and it was just fine.  I screwed it up at Christmas by using regular Lipton Onion soup and it was HORRIBLE.  The golden onion was great, though.

my family ate it,  But told me they have had better.  Not a good.  It is good though.  Easy, to make and all.  But because my family likes a more cheesey taste,  I won't make again.  But for families, that like other words. It could be good.

Very easy to make. Liked the texture the water chestnuts gave the recipe. 
I used vegetable soup mix(that worked well too) & cut up an extra loaf of bread for dipping.

I added a 1/2 pkg of onion soup mix to it which popped the flavor even more. Either way it goes over extremely well!

Excellent recipe. I made it with low-fat mayo and potato and leek soup (that's all I could find) and it was perfect. We had a birthday party for our 6yo twin girls and all the parents raved about the recipe and want a copy! I'm making it again for a monthly meeting of crafters in two weeks! I feel confident they will also love it. I did cut an extra baguette in half then in slices (to make semi-circle pieces) as it did need more bread for dipping, than just the inside of the round loaf.

What was I thinking?  For some unknown reason I thought using leek soup would make it "different"  - but even with extra spinach it still tasted like boxed onion soup.  Not bad - but not good.

I used reduced fat sour cream and mayo to cut some calories.  It tasted great.  Next time I make this dip I will add more spinach.

Tasty! I used an 8oz can water chestnuts and the whole 10oz pkg of spinach.  It turned out perfect.  I left it in a bowl and cut up a whole round loaf of sourdough...we ran out of bread (I should have bought more).

The leek soup mix makes this dip stand out above others.  Sometimes I add a little parmesean or green onions for a little more flavor.  but delicious on its own a well!  A great snck food for casual get togethers or parties.  YUM!

This is fast, easy and fantastic.  Be sure to drain all excess water from the thawed spinach.  I prefer using Knorr's Dill and skipping the watercress.  You can also sub light mayo and light sour cream and its still creamy enough.  Be sure to make the night before.  Serving in a hollowed rye bread-bowl with the inside of the bowl torn into bite size pieces and arranged around the bowl makes a great presentation.  You *will* be asked for the recipe, and it *will* vanish.

Awesome! I made this for my daughters baby shower and it was a huge hit. There was nothing left not even the bread. I will absolutely make this again. I used the entire 10 oz. of spinach which gave it alot of texture...yum.

I always hated spinach on its own, or in anything, until I tried this recipe.  I know what I'll be making for the next company smorgasboard!

Muy delicioso!!! I couldn't find the leek soup mix so I substituted veggie dip mix. It was wonderful! This was the first to go at a recent event! My mom's friend, a self proclaimed "Connoisseur of Spinach Dip" said it was the best she had tasted. Still getting requests for the recipie.

I've made this dip for a few functions, and each time, it's always the first to disappear!  The water chestnuts give a perfect bite, and the leek soup mix (I used cream of leek) was a nice alternative to onion soup mix. I usually double the recipe because it's that yummy!

This is consistently good!  Easy to make and carry to gatherings.  It's a regular for us.  Served it in a King Hawaiin bread bowl this year along with additional crackers and vegetables, and it was great!

Very good, but not the best I've had. I like the version with yogurt better - and it's not so fattening!! Great recipe when you don't have yogurt though!

The name says it all!  I get nothing but compliments when I make it.  The leek soup is a great alternative to the traditional vegetable soup mix.  Try it, you won't regret it!

I LOVE SPINACH DIP! This recipe is taste bud friendly. I doubled it for a wedding reception and people were filling PLATES with it...anything to take some home! I had to use one pack of onion soup mix and one cream of spinach since leek soup was NO WHERE to be found out here. For the regular recipe I DON'T recommed substituting just onion soup, though...the flavor would be too strong and ruin the perfect mix.

Amazing!  I love spinach dips but they all seem to contain onions, which I am allergic to.  Since I love water chestnuts as well, this is the perfect dip for me!  Hubby thought it was great as well.  I didn't change a thing, it was superb!

Great recipe.  I make it when we go to parties and it is always a hit.  Sometimes the leek soup mix is hard to find, but well worth it.

YUMMM!!  My old recipe is now in the trash.  This recipe makes a ton of delicious dip which was gone after about 20 mins at my last party.  I also used veggies and breadsticks for dipping.  I knew I would be getting a ton of requests for it, so I had pre-printed some cards with the recipe and they were all taken!
