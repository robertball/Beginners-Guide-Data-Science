I love love love this recipe! It uses ingredients I have on hand all the time except the cilantro. In a pinch I leave the cilantro out. If you are using frozen chicken just throw it into a pot and boil the breasts until done - you can even over-cook them at this process to tender them up. Once cooked drain the water and remove chicken. Shred or dice chicken then return to the same pot with onions and continue recipe from there (no need to add olive oil if you do it this way). By the way I was bummed I wasted the chipotles so many times so I discovered you can used dried chipotle powder instead and it is just as good!

I love this recipe! This is a great crockpot recipe. Add all of the ingredients to the crock pot and cook on low if you will be out for at least 7 hours. I usually add frozen corn and chicken breasts and add whole garlic cloves and rough chop my onion. I add a whole can of chipotle in adobe sauce but remove the chilies garlic clove and onion chucks at the end of cooking time. I place the chipotle garlic and onion in the blender and blend it into a sause. I love the soup as is but my husband loves to add my chipotle sauce in order to increase the heat. When serving this meal I always have bowls of extras at the table - home made chipotle sauce tortillas strips (for hearty tortilla soup) sour cream (for those like it creamier) and limes. A winner for busy moms and warms your body and soul on a cold day.

Four stars but only after major tweaks to keep it from being bland. I lightly seasoned the uncooked chicken pieces with poultry seasoning before sauteeing in a pan. Added the chopped onion plenty of minced garlic and also half of a chopped red bell pepper. I used two adobo chili peppers and about 2 tablespoons of sauce (from a can). Used a can of Rotel for more flavor; also added 1/4 crushed red pepper flakes 1/4 tsp. dried basil 1/2 tsp. ground cumin 1 tsp salt and one 4 oz. can chopped green chilies. Added a sprinkling of cornstarch to thicken it up a little. It was only after all of these additions did it seem like it would be enjoyable; before the changes it was bland and flavorless.

Chipotle Chicken Soup Haiku: "Wow was this tasty! Don't skimp on the cilantro. This one's a keeper!" To elaborate this recipe's good on its own but brings the "shazam!" with my 2 small additions of a heaping TB of "Taco Seasoning I" recipe from here as well as a diced bell pepper. Garnished with a scoop of sour cream a sprinkle of grated cheddar and a handful of crushed tortilla chips and this soup'll slay your tastebuds with its sensual spice.

I tried this recipe this past weekend. My son and husband were very skeptical but I assured them it would be good. I topped it with a sprinkle of cheese and served it with tortilla chips. They were astounded! Fabulous!!!!:) Definitely a keeper.

Really Good. I only put one can of diced tomatos & also put a can of green chilis. Served with avocado on the top & warmed up flour tortillias on the side.

Just a few minor tweaks to this recipe to make it a little more "user friendly" and healthy. 1) Cook or poach your chicken in the water to make your own sodium free broth. 2) Use frozen corn (no sodium) 3) make chipotle paste - puree a can of chipotles with adobo & keep in jar in frig and 4) use frozen cilantro cubes. I buy these cubes at my local "natural organic market". They are imported from Israel and come in a little tray that looks like a mini ice cube tray. It's kept in the freezer & easy to pop out a cube which is equal to one tsp of cilantro. Just add it to the broth. Yummy recipe and I serve it with refried bean & cheese quesadilla's.

This soup is very yummy but I changed a few things. I used chicken stock instead of water and half of the tomatoes. And added some powdered chipotle seasoning for more kick.

Wow this was the best soup that I have ever made! My family raved about it and now wants me to make it once a week. I found it so easy and quick to make as well. Then only change I made was to use coriander as I didn't have any cilantro.

I added dry adobo seasoning and simmered it with 2 dry chipotle peppers. The flavor turned out great!

This was very tasty. I boiled frozen chicken breasts in water seasoned with cumin and dried cilantro and then shredded the chicken. I also used all the juices in the chipotle pepper can and lightened the flavor with lime juice.

Very tasty. I used diced tomatoes with chiles 3 cloves of garlic and added a little bit of cumin for extra flavor. I also used chicken broth instead of water just under 2 cups because I prefer soup that is not very watery. I served with sour cream fresh grated cheddar and tortilla chips. My son won't eat spicy food but I love Mexican flavors so I made it anyway. I had plenty of leftovers which were easy to freeze. I like having meals ready to go in the freezer!

Adobo sauce gives this a great flavor and it's spicy. I added lime juice to match similar soups I've eaten in Mexico. Soup is ready in minutes! I used 2 boneless chick. breasts. My modification: used chicken broth lots of garlic skipped corn and beans (didn't have) and sugar; added zucchini bit of salt and juice of 1-2 limes. Ready in minutes. Will serve with Mexican white cheese (queso fresco) and tortilla strips (soup is similar to some tortilla soups I had in Mexico) Note: it calls for the sauce from the can of the adobo with chili not the chili and that alone is spicy. You can add chile but cautiously!

I chopped up two chilies in addition to the adobo sauce. I also threw in some bacon. My husband liked it a lot when I made it and LOVED it the next day.

Although tasty this just didn't wow me. In all fairness I did make quite a few changes (hence my 4 star rating). As lateacher did I also made this in my slow cooker. Where I went terribly wrong was following her advice to add the ENTIRE can of chipotle peppers to my soup. My husband commented that the soup itself was spicier than the sauce I made with the onion garlic and reserved peppers! There was certainly NO need to add any of it to our soup! Thankfully the cilantro and a hefty squirt of lime tamed most of the heat. Without them we would have had to order pizza for dinner.:( I usually follow a new recipe to the letter (or only make slight changes to it) and am regretting I didn't this time. All in all this was good but I'd bet it would be even better as written. Thanks for sharing your recipe Rhayc!:-)

I love this soup and appreciate that it is so easily customizable. I have used leftover turkey breast in place of chicken and a can of chicken broth instead of the bouillon and water. I also find this is a great soup to cook in the crock pot. Just toss everything in and come back in a few hours. My husband likes it a bit more stew like so the last few times I have used cornstarch tempered in the broth to thicken it up a bit. But great either way.

This was a yummy soup. I make a chicken tortilla soup often and wanted to give this a try for the chipotle twist. No problems with making the recipe but why would you add sauce without the canned chipotle pepper it comes with? I used some of the sauce along with a big pepper chopped up. Thanks for sharing.

I put in three of the chipotle chiles in minced and let is simmer on low flame for a few minutes to let the flavours meld together and it came out incredibly flavourful! It was a perfect meal to make if you have some staples in your pantry that have just been sitting there. Most of the ingredients I had on hand so there was little shopping involved and it was very inexpensive to make. One of those things you can just put together on a tuesday night after work it's easy to do you can feed a lot of people with a salad on the side. One of the best I've used from this site for ease and comfort!

This was great! I loved the chipotle flavoring. The only thing I added was some sour cream on top and an extra can of black beans. Next time I won't use as much onion. It was a little too much for my taste. I'll be making this again and again. Thanks!

Awesome soup. I boiled 2 frozen chicken breasts used the broth from that used a large can of pureed tomatoes because I didn't have two canned of diced and used about half a can of chipotles with sauce I had leftover in the fridge simply running them thru a small food processor. Had the cilantro on the side (son is allergic) Very good nice and spicy!

I did make it but added chopped celery chopped carrots and spinach noodles. I also kept the onion whole since my wife does not eat onions but I like to at least get the flavor.

This recipe wasn't a hit at my house although I can't quite put my finger on why. I think it was too spicy for my toddler (which is fine it was perfectly spiced for the adults). We are normally pretty big chipotle fans but we were just generally underwhelmed by this soup and didn't end up finishing the leftovers.

This is a great soup. Very easy. I even added about a cup of cooked rice.
