I had half a tenderloin which is perfect for the two of us.  I did not put the bread crumbs in a bag and shake it but rather just packed it on.  I believe it could have used more seasoning for that amount of bread crumbs.  The meat should be salted and peppered before adding the crumbs.  Thanks, Jansafire!

I was very pleasantly surprised at how well this turned out and how tasty it was. I would definitely make it again. My husband loved it too.

Added sliced mini Bella’s and Garlic. Took longer than 20 min  to reduce/thicken, and I had added 1T of flour to the liquids which I had doubled. Somewhat surprised there wasn’t more flavor, used fresh herbs. Liked it but next time I will increase  by half the sage, sun dried tomatoes, Onion and prosciutto and probably increase flour in liquids to 4teaspoons. Definitely a make again! Oh, I added al Dente Rotini to pan just before serving. There are only 2 if us, so we have enough leftover for another meal

Easy to make and tastes fabulous especially if you pair it with Quinoa in chicken broth and thyme.

Tweeked a bit...I marinated the tenderloin overnight in a dry mustard rub.  Added a tablespoon of dried shallots to the breading mixture served sliced with crumbled bacon and scallions on top.
