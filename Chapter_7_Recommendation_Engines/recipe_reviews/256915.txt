7.3.18 These were O.K., but certainly no substitute for pizza.  I can see kids loving them, but wouldn’t serve them as an appetizer for adults (although maybe game day snacks, not sure).  Yes, they certainly are easy to make, and that’s definitely a bonus point for them, and it is great way to use up leftover hot dog buns.

Such a simple and fun way to make mini pizzas. Don’t skip the step of toasting the buns before adding the sauce/toppings. It makes all the difference. I used butter and garlic powder before toasting. The sauce wasn’t my favorite. In a dash to get dinner on the table I would just buy my favorite brand. Kids would have a lot of fun making these gems using their favorite toppings. The Ball Park buns are the bomb! They’re so fresh and have great flavor for a packaged bun. A great way to use leftover buns.

These were delicious! I came in from a Boy Scout meeting with my kids around 7:50 and these were on the table by 8:30. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed them, including my two sons. There were no leftovers. I followed the recipe almost exactly - my only change was I used brat buns (they are a little bigger) and I omitted the optional oregano leaves. Everything else was included and made it absolutely delicious. I'd have never thought to use buns this way but my husband asked that I please do it again soon. Definitely! Thanks for the great recipe.

The sauce recipe was eady and really tasty - full of flavor! We changed up the toppings some to fit what I had and what we enjoy (mushrooms, bacon, sliced sausage links) and added some colby jack cheese to the mix. Great for weeknight pizza at home!

I now, know what to do with those leftover hot dog buns! I am always trying to come up with lunch ideas that my homeschooler can help with and he loved this and thought it was funny the base was made out of hot dog buns. We stuck to just mozzarella and turkey pepperoni for our pizzas (because that is what he wanted) but these could be easily customized based on your taste and i'm sure are delicious with sausage. Mr Great gives this recipe a 5!

Really easy and a great way to use up unused buns. I used the Ball Park Tailgater buns, because that is what I had leftover. The sauce was good, but it's not my fave, so I'd probably just stick to my own concoction next time. I also used my own toppings. I chopped up one slice of bacon and sautéed it until crisp. Then I sliced one large mushroom and sautéed it in the bacon grease until pretty soft. Then I sautéed some sliced onion in the same pan. I transferred all of the toppings into small individual containers so my son could make his own! He loved it. He made a captain pirate with a bacon mustache! Lol! I definitely will be making these again to use up buns. Quick, easy and of course yummy too!

We liked these easy to make pizzas. I did add 1/2 tsp. of basil and 1/2 tsp. of honey to the sauce.

My husband and I enjoyed these easy pizzas, but there were a few glitches with the written recipe for me: 1) the sauce was too acidic and needed some sweetener added to it. 2) I had sauce, sausage, and pepperoni left over. No problem...I froze it. 3) the olive oil mixture wasn't enough for the buns. Easy to make more though. 4) I toasted the buns for 8 minutes the first time. Then after they were fully assembled, it took closer to 10 minutes for the cheese to fully melt. Recipe issues aside, these tasted really good, were easy, and were a great way to use up hot dog buns.
