Deliciously easy. I omitted the herbs de Provence because I don t care for highly fragrant herbs on my spaghetti and did change a few measurements because as my husband says for some reason I can never follow a recipe. I am far from a great cook but my daughter said it smelled looked and tasted like something from the Food Network.
