I just made this for Thanksgiving and it got raves reviews all around (and I had several requests for the recipe!).  It was extremely easy (it was so easy, I thought at first I was making it wrong!) and very tasty.  My kids didn't eat it, but my friends' kids just loved it!  I added some chopped celery and chopped green onion.  Very nice - thank you!!!

Awesome!  I made this in a bundt pan so it would be in the shape of a wreath, and then decorated it with roasted red peppers and capers to look like poinsettas and surrounded the platter with basil leaves.  Great presentation and wonderful recipe.  Everyone gobbled this one up.

This was a big hit at my grandmother's 80th birthday party.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  Even the kids that said they don't like tuna gobbled this one up.

I had a recipe similar but I added finely chopped celery, green onion & a good portion of dill.  I think it needs those to have pizzazz.

IT WAS MUCH BETTER WHEN I HAVE HAD IT ON OTHER OCCASIONS.  I THINK I WOULD ADD SOME FINELY CHOPPED CELERY FOR CRUNCH AND USE A LESSER GRADE OF TUNA NEXT TIME.  MAYBE A SQUIRT OF LEMON JUICE.  IT WAS KIND OF BLAND, BUT OK.

I halved this recipe because I only had to serve six. We all liked it on multigrain crunchy crackers. And there wasn't any left!
