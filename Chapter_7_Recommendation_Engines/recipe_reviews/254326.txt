This really bothers me.   I don’t know if this is a copycat attempt of outback Alice springs chicken but if so, this is a terrible attempt as it’s not even close,   Surprised all recipes sent this out and hope they will more carefully vet recipes in the future

I made it with changes.  I added Adobo seasoning to the salt and pepper.  I also sauteed garlic and onions to enhance the flavor.  In between taking out of the oven and adding other ingredients, I put a sear on each side of the chicken breast.  Next time I will also add some mushrooms.  Otherwise , it was really good and my family has said they will eat it again.

As a former employee of Outback this recipe is lacking flavor. You should baste the chicken with honey mustard before putting mushrooms, bacon, and Monterrey Jack cheeses on and then broiled just long enough to melt the cheese .

What people are missing is this was inspired by the original recipe, it is not a copycat. Thank you for putting it out there.

Outback marinades their chicken in honey mustard and serves it with honey mustard so this recipe didn't really taste like it.  Although this was ok,  it was kinda bland.
