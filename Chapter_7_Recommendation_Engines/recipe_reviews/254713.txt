Being on a low carb diet and being a cookie fiend is a tough gig. When I saw this recipe  I was stoked after reading the reviews I changed a few things I added extra stevia 1 /4 cup and swapped the coconut oil for melted butter I cut the salt to a 1/4 teaspoon and sprinkled cinnamon on top. I needed a fix in the worse way and this did the trick! It is also a bonus that my husband hates coconut these babies are all mine!

Based on the other 3 reviews I made the following changes:
1/4 tsp of salt
3 packets of Truvia
They were really tasty!! A little sweet, not too greasy or salty. Yum!!

These are delish. I used the whole egg though. I think that butter would taste great in them too. I also used 1 tbl of monk fruit sweetener.

I made it with 2 tablespoons organic maple syrup instead of stevia, otherwise followed the directions as is.  I mixed the wet ingredients separate from the dry first. I used a small  cookie  scooper to make them uniformed in size and shape. This produced just over two dozen silver dollar sized cookies. 12 minutes left them golden brown at the edges and they held together fairly well after cooling. A bit fragile, but very tasty. I'm thinking of  drizzling them with candy-coat chocolate, I think that would help hold them together.

I made these and the cookies come out tasting like biscuits. It needs more than 1/3tsp sweetener. Maybe 1/3 cup

Made these today, WAAAAAAY too much salt.  Next time I will use between a pinch and 1/4 tsp.  Also used about 1 tsp.  stevia in the raw, could have used more. I think I will reduce the coconut oil to 1/4 cup, good but a little greasy

I know I’m about to commit a major pet peeve to some here by leaving a low rated review after changing a recipe, but here goes. I took the advise of several reviewers and reduced the salt, increased the stevia, added almond extract, and replaced some coconut oil with butter. Still, the cookie was quite bland.  I should have added more Stevia but I’m still learning how to use it and fear its overuse.   The cookie did have a good soft texture. I pressed the dough balls into a small ring mold to reduce  cracked edges and crumbling.  I may use this recipe again as a starting point for a cookie seasoned like a snickerdoodle.  As I made this batch though, I left them at home rather than take them to a family supper.

I made these and was excited to try. They are too salty to eat.

I made these last night and followed the recipe as written and they were way to salty and need a little more sweetness added. I’m going to make them again tonight and adjust the salt and sweetener. I’ll update then.

Too salty,  I don’t think the amounts were correct. Should have been a dash of salt and 3-4 packets of stevia.

These were pretty nasty. Just salty, greasy and bland. I made it exactly by the recipe. I’m kind of coming to terms with the fact that nothing keto will ever resemble an honest-to-god bakes good. I may modify this recipe into a Red Lobster cheesy biscuit knockoff in the future, however. It does have potential there.

These are very bland. I saw others who swapped out the coconut oil with butter, maybe that would help. Other spices should tried to make this better
