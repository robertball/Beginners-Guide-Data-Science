We enjoyed these baked apples, but as usual I tweaked the recipe to suit our tastes. Rarely do I follow a recipe exactly. I cut the apples in half and cored. Put them in a dish. Followed the ingredients of the recipe, though I did carmalize the nuts first and adjusted the ingredient amounts to suit our tastes. Baked them covered for 30 minutes and uncovered for another 15 minutes. At first I thought I wasn't going to like them but after a couple of bites they really appealed to me and I will definitely make this recipe again. Since there are only two of us now I refrigerated the leftovers and reheated them later. They were still delicioius. Love recipes that I can use the leftovers. Cuts down on so much cooking every day.  Linda

I loved this!! Well, I only used the ingredients. I didn't measure. I definitely used more cinnamon and maple syrup than was called for. It's a great dessert or snack!

Very tasty, but they didn't get tender for much longer than the recipe said.

Delicious and great reheated for two or three days. I added about two tablespoons of honey to the mixture just for that typical honey-apple taste. Throwing the ingredients together at single-serving proportions and zapping the apple in the microwave for a couple of minutes makes a great midnight snack!

Delicious and comforting on a cold evening. I used honey instead of maple syrup and I would definately recommend using Granny Smith apples or some other tart apple. Some pecans sprinkled on top are good. My husband loved it!!

Have to agree with another these were really just blah.  It also took longer cook in the oven.  I was hoping these were going to be really good but was very disappointed in the end.  I had even added some cinnamon sugar at the end but that didn't improve.  Will not make this again and will keep searching for another recipe.

These are delicious. I did add 1/2 a table spoon of powdered sugar to the recipe to thicken the sauce a little bit. Delicious feel good recipe .

It had good flavor but it needed to coat the apples completely with a sticky residue.  Perhaps taste was compromised for nutrition.  Dave Thomas said taste is what matters.  Yet nutrition is important too   I would make it again if the recipe was modified to make it more rich(fattening).

It's a great recipe. My family and a few guests loved it but I tweaked it a bit by adding apple cider vinegar and for thanksgiving I think instead of the vinegar I'll try it with Apple cider

The only change I would make is to halve the amount of apples.  Also, for easier eatability:  I left the skins on which tasted really good but I will cut the apple slices into bite-sized pieces before baking next time.  It makes things easier for the kids.  I served over French vanilla ice cream.  Amazing!  By using half the amount of apples there was a little more of the glaze in the bottom of the pan (9x9) which I poured over the ice cream along with the apples.  Yum!
