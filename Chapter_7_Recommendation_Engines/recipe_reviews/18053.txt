I'm not a big fan of waffles but my husband is. I found this recipe and decided to try it. LOVED IT! We both thought it was great. These are the only waffles that I will make anymore!

It tastes like it sounds, just like French Toast! It is a nice departure from the plain old waffle batter that I have grown so used to. I will keep it on the rotation!

I made a big batch of waffles last night and put them in the refrigerator in a ziplock bag so my kids just have to microwave them for a few seconds. I just followed the recipe on the Bisquick package and added cinnamon (I always add vanilla and sugar anyway). The big difference between the two recipes is the eggs. Only use one.

I was intrigued by this recipe and couldn't wait to try it.  My family *loves* waffles and cinnamon French toast.  I ended up disappointed, though.  These waffles turned out soft and a little tough, not tender and crispy as we like them.  I'd rather make French toast, which is quicker and easier anyway.  Or I'd rather spend a few extra minutes making waffles from scratch.  These didn't even taste as good as frozen Eggos, to me.  However, my kids gobbled them up.  If you like soft waffles rather than crispy, you may like these.

Hey guys!
I just went to the store and bought milk so that I could make this recipe.  I really didn't care for it.  I don't think it was worth the calories!  Too much cinnamon as well.  I think I will stick with either waffles or French toast and try not to mix them!  Thanks.

Would not exactly say they taste like French Toast but anything with cinnamon added can not be bad!! I had started making a triple batch of these before I realized I only had two eggs so I subbed 4T ground flax mixed with 12T water for the other four eggs with no ill effects. I also used the Easy Biscuit Mixture from this site which I made with whole wheat pastry flour. Made 16 waffles.

These waffles turned out just right, nothing fantabulous, but very good.  It makes a small batch so I doubled the recipe and changed it just a bit. I made it with Bisquick, adding 2 Tblsp. of oil and I only used 3 eggs.  I also added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg to give just a bit more flavor.  I would definitely make them again.

I thought these were a great change to plain waffles.  I will be making these again. We are having company for the weekend soon and I will add these to our brunch menu. Even my husband enjoyed them and my nine month old ate them too!

Absolutely YUMMY.  I love vanilla flavoring in pancakes or waffles....and this was great.  I would have never thought to add cinnamon, but it truly made this unique.  Can't wait to make this again.  Thanks for the post.

I was a virgin waffle maker...I had never made homemade waffles before, but due to the new waffle iron I received for my b-day I had to give it a try. I chose this recipe for my first run and I must say that these waffles were ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL. They were easy to make (my 3 year old helped) and they were delicious. I followed the advice of another reviewer and doubled the batch, I also added additional vanilla and cinnamon (just a dash). I froze the leftovers successfully. Both my husband and I agreed that they were some of the best waffles we have every had (and both kids gobbled them up, which is rare). Take it from me...someone who never made waffles before, these waffles turned out perfectly. Will definately make again, it is a new favorite. Five stars for preparation and 5 stars for taste.

These waffles were average. I love both French toast and waffles, but I guess not together. They weren't bad, but I probably wouldn't make them again. The batter made two full size waffles with barely any left.

It's more like cinnamon waffles. I love the smell. I agree with some reviwers that it's a bit soft than crispy. I made a batch, put them into a fridge inside a ziplock bag. And pop them in th toaster in the morning. I do think it's more exciting than plain waffles, but not like french toast at all.

OK waffle recipe but it tasted nothing like french toast. It would just call them cinnamon waffles. My wife said she would prefer just plain waffles.

Wow! I just got a 'new' waffle maker and decided to try something other than mom's old family recipe. I tried two different recipes.. this one.. and a more traditional one. After eating this one, my family told me not to even bother with making any other recipes from now on! This was SO good.. and smelled WONDERFUL! The batter is much thinner than I expected for a waffle... but it cooked up great. I will definately be putting this with other favorite recipes! My only complaint would be that it doesn't make that many! I will be doubling my recipe from now on. Awesome!

These are sooooooo good!!  Definitely need milk or juice to drink when eating them.  Also be careful not to put too much batter in your waffle iron because these tend to overflow on me.

This recipe was very dry.  I would probably add more milk next time if I do make them again.  My kids did not eat them.

I am pregnant and couldn't decided between french toast or waffles. I found this recipe and I LOVED it! It was a great mix of both.

Very good tastes just like French Toast! My only complaint is I like Waffles 1 recipe more so I make that and add cinnamon and sugar and it tastes delicious! Only because I am not a big fan of Bis-quick.

I'm a waffles-lover and I have often tried cinnamon waffles. But this recipe is the absolute best and easiest! If you like, you can add a lil more cinnamon or subsitute the milk with buttermilk to make it more fluffy.

I just made these waffles for dinner.  They were ok.  I think this is a great base recipe.  Next time I am going to double the cinnamon, add 1/4t. of nutmeg, and some diced apple.  I think it will be really good with a few changes!  :)

I had to laugh at the description of this recipe "do you love French toast, but don't like the hassle?". I think waffles are WAY more hassle than French toast, LOL. However, I do like waffles so I gave this a try. It just didn't hit home with me though. The ingredient list is unclear as to whether you should use all purpose baking mix like Bisquick or a complete "just add water" pancake mix. I assumed that since eggs and milk are added, that Bisquick was the appropriate choice. It is still way to eggy for me. And now I know also that I don't care for my waffles to be sweet and cinnamony, I like them just plain with a crispy outside and a fluffy interior, neither of which this recipe achieved.

Very quick and easy, but they are kind of dry and lack flavour.  I guess my expectations were too high...  I'll go back to my "from scratch" waffle recipe and try adding cinnamon to that.

Pros: Cinnamon flavor was great and these smelled delicious when in the waffle maker.  Cons: More of a soft waffle, not crispy. Also the recipe says it makes 6, I would say each batch made about 3 waffles in a Belgian style waffle maker.

This is my go-to waffle recipe.  We like to put whip cream and strawberries on them and the texture holds up better than a traditional waffle in my opinion.  Definitely worth a try.

My husband and I didn't care for these waffles too much.  I thought they were too heavy and sort of tough.  The taste was somewhat like french toast.  The recipe only made 2 1/2 waffles but, as it turned out, that was plenty for us.

Well, I don't know that they tasted like French toast, but they were good, nevertheless.  I doubled the recipe for my Belgian waffle maker and got 4 waffles with a bit of batter left over.  I followed the recipe exactly, other than doubling it.  If I made it again, I might add some maple syrup into the batter to see how that turned out.

This recipe blew my mind out my nose. The combination of cinnamon and pancake mix is like long lost friends meeting for the first time in 46 years. Also, it is easy to make. which leaves times for my other activities. like horseback riding, and underwater basket weaving.

This recipe is really good! It is so simple to make too! It was so easy and I can't wait to make more. I cut this recipe in half and got 3 very thick and nicely sized waffles out of it, so my adjustments would need to be doubled in order to satisfy the recipe posted...The things I did differently were: 
used 1/2 teaspoon (instead of 1) of Splenda sugar
added 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
I needed to add a tiny bit of cold water to the mixture so that I could stir it and thin out the batter just a little.
 
Other than that, stick to the recipe. This recipe probably can withstand many modifications too. I think I am going to put in more vanilla extract next time and maybe even some apples another time. This recipe is definitely a keeper! One note, my waffle iron is for Belgian waffles and so mine came out very soft (the way I like it), be sure to cook yours a little longer if you like your waffles crunchy. ENJOY!!! I hope you like these as much as I did. 
PS I used Krusteaz Buttermilk Pancake Mix (the “Just add Water” kind) for my waffles.

i'm a health freak and i was originally drawn to this recipe because it doesn't use oil like other waffle recipes. i used splenda, egg subsitute and skim milk and the waffles still tasted amazing! my search for the perfect waffle recipe is over! thanks for this keeper!!

Very good!! Tasted somewhat like french toast but not really.  Definitely a great alternative to the regular waffle.  The batter looked a little too liquidy when I made it, but when I put the amount I regularly put in my iron it overflowed. When I got it right it was very good. Thank you!

I was originally impressed by the reviews and was excited to make this 'unique' recipe for my family - part of a brunch birthday celebration.  The first batch was awful.  Thinking I must have made a mistake, I remade them with a different waffle mix.  The second batch was just as bad - flavorless and hard.  I'll stick to my 'from scratch' recipe as well.  It's a little more time consuming (but so is having to remake a recipe), but the results are consistent.

These deserve five stars just on simplicity alone. These took about five minutes to prepare and cook! They also tasted great. I will definitely make these again!

This is perfect!  It was almost exactly what I was looking for.  My husband wanted a thicker waffle like the ones we had in Germany, and this is almost exactly like them.  Delicious taste.  The vanilla and cinnamon really give it a great flavor!  Thanks!

i think i will stick to  my normal recipe for waffles that i have found on this site- these turned out a little too thick and tough. the idea was good-and even the taste was great- it might have been that i made my own waffle mix instead of using bisquick or something to the like------i will try these one more time using actual bisquick and trying to make the mixture a little more runny so they don't come out quite so thick. I did add a touch of orange juice to the mixture and that added a special little touch to the taste. I will try again--

We are a waffle family and these were really a hit. I did make a couple changes after the first batch though, I added a little extra vanilla to enhance the flavor. I've also made these using 2 packets of Sweet and Low instead of sugar without any problems. They are very 'tender' just the way a good waffle should be.

I made this with Kodiak cakes pancake mix and would not make again. The eggs made it too tough and the waffles POPPED out of the iron. I added more milk for the second waffle and it was dry to me. Not impressed

These were very easy and very tasty.  I only used one egg as we like our waffles to be on the thick side but, the batter was still a bit runny for us.  Maybe cut the milk a bit more.  But all in all the waffles were very good.  Will definitely make these again.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made it with 2 cups of pancake/waffle mix and I added 1/4 cups of water after I mixed everything up. It was the most delicious breakfast I’ve ever made and eaten myself!!!! I mixed the dry ingredients first then added the milk , vanilla extract, and eggs.

Very easy to make.  I followed the directions and doubled the batch.  The kids and I gave it a 3 star.  The taste was too "eggy" for me however my husband gave it a 5.  He loves eggs so maybe that is why he really enjoyed the waffles.

I thought the smell was awesome, the taste wasn't as rich as I expected. I think in the future I would add butter to the recipe to soften it up or perhaps cook the waffle and then dip it in the french-toast ingredients and cook it traditionally.

Just as I began to make these, I realized I only had complete pancake batter (just add water). So if you're worried about using that kind, don't be. They came out great! I made the recipe as posted and they tasted like cinnamon rolls and reminded us of Christmas. We'll make these often - at least a double batch at a time. Hint: Keep the waffles warm and crispy in a 300 degree oven as you make them, so everyone can eat together.

This recipe is amazing! I have not had waffles in FOREVER because they are so high in fat and unhealthy!  However, these aren't!  It was so easy and I can't wait to make more.  I cut this recipe in half and got 4 perfectly sized waffles out of it, so my adjustments would need to be doubled in order to satisfy the recipe you see...The things I did differently were: 1) used 1/2 teaspoon (instead of 1) of Splenda, 2) added 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, and 3) I needed to add a tiny bit of cold water to the mixture, but only a few drops, so that I could stir it and thin out the batter a little

Other than that,stick to the recipe, it is soooooo SIMPLE!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!
One note, my waffle iron is for Belgian waffles and so mine came out very soft (the way I like it), be sure to cook yours a little longer if you like your waffles crunchy and hard.  ENJOY!!!

This recipe was much easier than my usual waffle recipe because it doesn't require the egg whites to be beaten separately.  I cut the cinnamon, sugar and vanilla in half as I thought the amounts listed in the recipe would be too much and they were delicious!!

These waffles are awesome!  I am a big waffle fan and couldn't wait to try these.  I have them on average once to twice a week.  I use a low carb waffle mix and after they're cooked I brush on melted I can't believe it's not butter and use smucker's sugar free maple syrup.  These are "the best" waffles I've ever had!  thanks Fred!!!

I was very excited to try this recipe, and I'll have to admit it smelled terrific in the waffle iron, but the waffles came out really dry and soft. I think possibly that this had something to do with using "complete" waffle mix (where you just add water), because I followed the directions of the recipe to a "t", even though other reviewers added more waffle mix to make the batter less runny (mine was consistent like waffle mix usually is). I may try this again sometime, since it got so many rave reviews, but for now I'll stick to my french toast and waffles seperately.

Didn't have as much flavor as I would have liked.  Not much different then regular waffles.  I added additional cinnamon and vanilla. Maybe increase key ingredients even more to get additional flavor.

Awesome!  These were so flavorful and moist!  I liked using the ready-made pancake mix for this.  It saved a lot of time.

Delicious recipe!  Definately should not let them cook until they stop steaming, check it after about 2 minutes or so.  These waffles get too hard when you let them go till the waffle maker says they're done.

Pretty good but needed 1 tbs. BUTTER!  I also added a dash cloves which bumped up the flavor. Soft waffles.

I was disappointed in this recipe.  I doubled the recipe because when I make waffles all the mixes I use calls for to cups.  The batter was so thin that it came out of my waffle maker all over my counter.  I added more mix to thicken it up.  I was not happy with how the waffles turned out.  I might try this again and tweak the ingredients some.

These were very good and easy.  In my Beligan waffle maker, they only  made 3 big waffles.  I also made extra and froze them for later.

Very tasty!  I don't always have the time or the energy to cook breakfast so I double the recipe, make the waffles and freeze them.  When ready, I take them out of the freezer, pop them in the toaster and my family gets a quick home-cooked breakfast.

This is a great recipe. While it is cooking, it smells like your making waffle cones. The only thing was that the serving size is a little off... a serving size of 3 on the recipe only yeilded two moderate sized servings. Other than that, it is good.. It has a good aftertaste..

This is a great easy recipe that adds a little punch to ordinary waffles.  To make it just a little easier, I used day old bread instead of waffle mix.  You couldn't even tell the difference.

It's French Toast in a new form! Plus, you don't have to flip the bread!
