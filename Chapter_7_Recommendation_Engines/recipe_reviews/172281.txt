Taste: nothing special. Needs something more. Recipe: didn't hold together. Most meatballs and meatloaves need bread crumbs added or oatmeal etc. So I had to add that to the mixture to get it to adhere properly. The simple breadcrumb coating was bland and tasteless and dried out in the oven. The cook needs to adjust this recipe to make it better.

Great idea to get veggies into meatballs; however I agreed with the other reviewer and went ahead and added the breadcrumbs right to the meatball mixture. They came out a bit watery--I think because of the zucchini. I will use this idea though again for meatballs--adding a little more breadcrumbs. They were very tasty and my son had no idea he was eating zucchini. I used them in a sweet and sour sauce and served with rice.

I've made this two times and it is a hit with my kids!!! They are so good that they are my preferred meatball now. As far as modifications I followed the advice of many other reviewers and added my "breadcrumbs" to the mixture before cooking them. However I used quinoa flakes for some added protein for my growing boys. I also soak the quinoa flakes in milk first (until they are just soaked through but not enough milk to make them sopping wet. Most true Italian meatballs call for breadcrumbs soaked in milk which I think helps bind them better. This recipe is versatile. I've used broccoli and carrots or zucchini and carrots and both were excellent. You definitely need to squeeze the liquid out of the zucchini and onions. Also I recommend letting the whole mixture sit covered in the fridge overnight or all day before baking- the flavors meld and everything just tastes better. I like to make mini-meatballs and these freeze really well for quick kids dinners.

These meatballs are delicious! Great way to get extra veggies in my one year old. Having read the other reviews first I did add a little bread crumb to the mixture before adding the turkey (maybe a tablespoon); just enough to soak up the liquid from the veggies. I served them with pasta and spaghetti sauce but they are so good I could eat them plain.

I think the meatballs would hold together a lot better if you squeezed the moisture out of the veggies (or at least the onions) in a cheesecloth or towel. Probably a good flavor though.

I was shocked at the taste! I loved them as did my 7 yo who knew there were veggies in them and most importantly my very picky 5 yo who I made them for loved them and has no idea what's in them! I did make them with meatball mix meat rather than turkey and I forgot the onion. They did not fall apart by not adding in the breadcrumbs which I was also surprised about. May be my new meatball recipe!!!

I liked these a lot. I let the zucchini drain a bit in a colander to get rid of some of the moisture and it worked fine. I made half of the meatballs by adding the crumbs to the mixture.. and half as the recipe states.. rolling them in the crumbs. I liked the ones rolled in the crumbs a little better

Wonderful meatballs. I made then with 99% lean turkey which helped the meatballs stay together after incorporating the zucchini and carrots. I also mixed in the bread crumbs rather than using the crumbs to coat the meatballs. After baking the meatballs I immersed them in marinara sauce and let them simmer for about 15 minutes before serving with pasta. Yum!

Very tasty! I substituted broccoli for the zucchini. My 15-month old granddaughter loves them!

Huge hit with our two year old anti-veggie toddler. We both liked them too! Didn't change anything. Will definitely make again!

These are so good! I forgot to add Parmesan and used ground beef instead of turkey but they were still great. I did as others suggested and soaked the breadcrumbs before adding them to the meat mixture. I also added a tsp of minced garlic because I love garlic. My picky husband and kids all loved these. They are definitely getting added to our regular rotation!

I made these with ground beef because that's what we had in the house. Otherwise I didn't change anything. My very picky zucchini-phobic boyfriend said these were the best meatballs he's ever had. So there you go.

This is my go-to meatball recipe! It s now my Italian family favorite! I did make one alteration though due to it being too watery then not holding together. I use onion powder equivalent to raw onion. The onion is just too moist. But now my meatballs always hold!
