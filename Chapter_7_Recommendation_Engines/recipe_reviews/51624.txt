I found this recipe years ago and have been making them ever since.  My family raves about these and insists I make them every year for Christmas.  They are so easy to make but look like you put a lot of effort into them.  The only change I have made is to use mini morsels.  I think the mini chips look nicer and are all you need if you have the drizzled chocolate on top.

These cookies were good except that they exploded in your hands.  MAke them small enough so you can eat them in one bite.  Otherwise great cookies.

These look very good. I tried them today and found it very difficult to keep the dough together to make the balls for baking. I ended up putting the dough in a 9x13 pan and baking that way. The cooked cookie fell apart after cooling. Unable to enjoy them at all. I did taste it using a spoon and they are delicious but...

Have made these for several years. We love them! The first time I made them we thought they were too sweet with the chocolate melted on top so the next time and ever since I just put all the chips in the dough. With a tall glass of milk ~ this is heaven! I also use the mini chips as someone else mentioned instead of the regular size chips. My kids ask for these more than any other cookie.

Worked great for me. Just be sure to cut a tiny hole in the ziplock in order to drizzle the chocolate in finer lines.

My Chocolate Chip Holiday Tea Cakes came out fantastic! Made them just like the recipe said and everything! They were a hit at the cookie party and can't wait to make them again! I found that if you use like a melon baller, they come out a bit smaller but they're bite size and don't fall apart as much as they do if you made them regular cookie sized.

Pretty good!  I intended on using the mini chocolate chips like one user suggested, but they were sold out.  So I put the regular chips in the processor and it worked just fine.  My lines of drizzled chocolate weren't as thin, so next time I will try a pin-point hole instead.  After the chocolate lines chilled, they easily fell off the cookies if they were bumped.

The cookies turned out very pretty, but every one that tried them said they were a little dry and crumbly. Not sure I would make these again.

Actually, these are a five star. Just need to make them correctly. My father said they were better than his mother's pin wheel cookies that my cousin still makes him each xmas. My brother-in-law loved them, hid them!

These are so good!  I make them all the time, only without the chocolate on top.  These taste even better right out of the freezer.
