This was actually pretty good... 

I used leftover ham and mashed potatoes so I know I had too much for what the recipe called for. I did do what a few others suggested... I added broccoli, about 1/2 tsp of celery salt, 1/2 tsp of onion powder and I doubled the garlic and it tasted really good. The kids picked at it but they are picky eaters.. all the adults who ate it really enjoyed it w/ a good side salad.This is definatly a keeper for all those leftovers after Easter!! ***UPDATE*** I've made this a few times now and I have since added those fried french onions to the top.. the onions give it a great taste and the crunch is EXACTLY what this recipe needs! This is a favorite at my house now and I've made this even when I didn't have Easter leftovers!

Wonderful use for leftovers!! We loved this and we don't care for casseroles too much.  INstead of making the potatoes from the recipe I just threw in some leftover mashed taters and stopped adding when i liked the consistency.  Based on reviews i chopped up some frozen broccoli and threw it in there.  Also since this is a recipe designed to use up leftovers i threw in some leftover mixed vegetables from the fridge.I also used cream of chicken soup.  Delicous!!  Will definately make everytime we have ham.  My husband even asked me to wrap the leftovers from this dish for lunch the next day!!

This is a great basic recipe - it's so adaptable to everyone's tastebuds. Thanks to other reviewers for broccoli, onion powder, extra garlic, less butter and milk.  I substituted Cheddar-Broccoli soup (low-fat)for Mushroom, added a can of mushrooms, a blob of dijon mustard and a little poultry seasoning. I topped it with a few dry bread crumbs for crunch and a little cheddar cheese during baking and watched my husband go at it. I have a request to do this again.  Easy and good.

I used everyone's advice and cut down on the potatoes. I used 9 and it was still too many.  I would recommend using 7 potatoes.  I also added brocolli which was great and a pinch of celery salt to spice it up!!! Great, easy dish

This is a great casserole for those evenings when you have to drive kids to sporting events, and don't have time to prepare dinner. Just amke this the evening before, put it covered in the fridge, and cook it when you get home. The kids will love it, and it sure beats stopping to get fast food on the way home!

This was a really tasty dinner.  I only used 7 potatoes.  I also added broccoli, onions, and swiss cheese.  I can't wait til next Easter so I can make this again!

I took other reviewers advice and used Swiss cheese, cut down on potatoes and increased the milk. The Swiss made it a tangy dish. It was very tasty! I've recommended it to others who were stuck with leftover Easter ham.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I added garlic powder  and 1/2 teaspoon of celery salt to the mashed potatoes as well as used honey/maple ham which gave it a great flavour. Corn, broccoli and sauteed onions were also a great addition. Sprinkled the top with breadcrumbs and added the cheese. Delicious!

It was really good!! I just made it & my kids ate 2 plates full!!!  I did add an extra clove of garlic & I used Cream of Chicken soup.  Also sprinkled parsley flakes & onion powder on.  Instead of broccoli, I used a can of corn drained.  Super Delicious.  I think next time I will add some shredded cheese into the mixture!!  Will make again.

I made this on a whim as I had some leftover mashed potatoes and ham from Easter dinner. It was delicious! I don't have any garlic powder (and sadly forgot to put real garlic in) but I did chop up about a quarter of an onion and throw that in there. The suggestion to add broccoli was perfect since the broccoli was perfectly cooked. I threw in a handful of frozen corn which also added great flavor. After the cheese melted on the top of the casserole I put the oven on broil until a nice crunchy layer of cheese formed. We had some friends over for a quick meal and everyone loved it. Even the two toddlers we eating it. I will definitely be making this again.

what an excellent use of leftover ham.  I don't know if I would have come up with the same blend.  I used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom and it was great--my family loved it

This is a glorified side dish, not a main course!  If you make it be prepared to eat a dinner of mashed potatoes with ham in it.  We were pretty disappointed, to say the least.

I made this last year with the ham leftovers.  It was soooo good.  Especially on a cold day.  I added broccoli to it and my family loved...come to think of it I probably added extra cheese too.

I made this recipe with leftover Yukon Gold mashed potatoes and some ham and I wasn't sure how good it would be. But I was very pleasantly surprised. I actually burned my mouth a tiny bit eating it before it had cooled down it was so good. Thanks!

This is the first recipe I have printed to use again. I used leftover turkey, leftover mashed potatoes, cream of celery soup and a can of corn. I thought it would not be good, but I feed 10 people and they ALL liked it. Very easy too.

The only reason this is not a 5 star recipe is the writer's oops re: potatoes. If I had 6 kids, I would have used 12, but we have 2, so I used 4 large potatoes. I did not choose to mash them, for texture. I used PEAS. It kind of reminded me of a pot-pie. I also jazzed it up with some red  pepper flakes and ground black peppercorns(Trader Joes sells a great peppercorn/grinder doohickey). Leave the ham chopped chunky for big flavor. YUM! It was easy to make and came out tasty! My husband quoted "good and Hardy".
I cooked it 45 minutes.

I made this "Christmas" Leftover Casserole.  I make garlic ranch mashed potatoes and had those left from Christmas and used them with the ham and other ingredients as listed.  My husband really enjoyed it and the kids said it was "good."

Great recipe!  The kids ate it once they tried a bite; my 5-year old had seconds!  We are watching our weight, so I cut back on the butter and cheese.  2T. butter in the potatoes, and no butter in the mixture, and 1/2c. cheese on top.  I tried Swiss after reading some of the reviews.  Next time I'd also like to try the onions and maybe half the can of mushroom soup, to cut back on calories.  Oh...and we are big garlic eaters so I used 3 cloves.

This is okay, not great. A good way to use up extra ham. WAY too many potatoes... Even with extra garlic and an onion this came out kind of bland.

Very good recipe, with a lot more flavour than we expected.  We were looking for something to do with our left over ham.  Thanks to past reviews we used less potatoes (7 instead of 12), and added onion powder. Since a member of our family does not like broccoli we added frozen kernel corn, and it was delicious.  Also, when I was making it, I accidentally put the grated cheese (we chose marble) into the mixture, so I sprinkled some cheddar cheese on top for the last 10 minutes.  It turned out great!

This was awesome! The only change I made was that Idecided not to mash the potatoes and put them in the casserole cubed. I just liked the texture better than mashed. I will make these again.

I used all the potatoes I had left. (about 8-10)I also used the rest of my ham (3-4 cups). I added a can of corn, 1 cup of cheese to the mix (plus one cup on top, my boyfriend loves cheese)and crushed some saltines on top. All in all a pretty good recipe to get rid of all that leftover ham. I thought it was ok, but my father loved it! He ate 1/2 the pan himself.  Will make again.

Took advice of others and cut down on potatos.  We like a creamy potato so I added more milk and butter.  Wonderful though, everyone at my daycare enjoyed this!

This was a wonderful, easy to make and very versatile comfort food.  I can see throwing in some veggies, and changing the cheese to swiss.  This recipe is a wonderful springboard to lots of great dinners!

This recipe was great, but I did add a few things - onion salt and basil flakes.  Also, next time I would probably not add any additional milk, as it was a little soupy.  Very yummy - my husband loved it!!

This recipe offers a great start and the help of the reviews, both good and poor, have only helped to improve this meal.  Let me start off with the fact that I did not have potatoes, so I substituted instant.   I made them creamy with just milk, some butter and the cream of mushroom soup.  I added a chopped onion, the parsley flakes and doubled the garlic and microwaved till it boiled then added enough instant potatoes until I got the right texture.  I added the chopped leftover ham and a bag of frozen broccoli.  Baked as suggested, added the cheese and some panko bread crumbs, baked again, as instructed.  I them placed it under the broiled for about 2-3 minutes, until the cheese was toasty brown.  All I have to say is, I've been asked to make this again... It was suggested that this might work with left over steak or beef roast, heck even brisket...  So yes, it is a good thing and I will be making this again.  Thanks again for sharing!!!

This recipe was a hit for my family! I had ham, mashed potatoes, stuffing, and green bean casserole left over from Christmas. I cut the ham into 1/2 inch cubes, and the stuffing too, mixed the seasoning with the potatoes and added that to the ham and stuffing. Taking into consideration the suggestion of a green vegetable and fried onions, since I already had the green bean casserole, I added that too. With the stuffing and mashed potatoes, I did not feel like an egg was necessary for binding. I topped it off with shredded cheddar and baked until heated through. My family has requested that I make it again whether I have leftovers or I start from scratch.
