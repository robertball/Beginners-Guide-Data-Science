**********please note that my recipe they published is incorrect. My actual recipe is as follows: Ingredients ground pepper and lemon pepper 2 teaspoons of each rosemary 2 teaspoons ground coffee 2 teaspoons olive oil (olive oil cooking spray is fine) garlic powder 1 teaspoon onion powder 1 teaspoon This is calculated using a 7# rib roast @350 degrees Directions generously oil the prime rib on all sides. grind coffee and rosemary together (you can put in a bag and use a meat pounder's smooth side if you don't have a coffee grinder) until well mixed. Sprinkle on the top and sides of the roast. Then sprinkle with the peppers. Last sprinkle with garlic and onion powder. Use non stick foil and cover for 1st half of baking time (look on the package for time per pound) approx 2.5 hours is the norm. Uncover at halfway point. Check for desired meat temp with thermometer. Take out to rest while meat is still red-pink inside depending on your preference insofar as how well done you like your meat. ENJOY IT IS DELICIOUS!!!

The coffee in this rub was amazing! I'v never tried coffee on meat. It gave the meat a unique smokey taste to it even though it was cooked in the oven. I used it on a roast beef, and should've cooked it in the slow cooker, but that was my mistake. I will now always add some coffee into my meat rubs.

Perfect!  The only thing I add to the rub is 2 tbsp flour.  It gives the coating a really good crunch for added texture

This recipie was excellent!  I made it for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it. Unfortunately, I did not see the update from the recipe publisher so I used both black pepper and lemon pepper but it was delicious and not too spicy at all.  One review comment says  it is alright to use cooking spray in place of the olive oil rub.  If you are going to spend this much on a cut of meat please use the olive oil - it will make a big difference!

I made this and it turned out great but I put all the seasoning on and put in the refrigerator over night the flavor went all the way through yummy
