i made this for a solo dinner and used 1 thawed frozen salmon fillet and halved the recipe for the sauce. i also used apricot preserves instead of orange marmalade b/c that's what i had on hand. the sauce was glazy and sweet. very good and quick&easy to make. i had it with steamed green beans.

This was simple and delicious! I had a jar of marmalade in my fridge that never gets used. This took care of about half of it. I will make this again because it's very quick but it tastes like I slaved away in the kitchen. My husband says that it was great!

This is very easy to make and tastes great.  The sauce works well over steamed spinach as well.

My husband is not a big fan of fish, but even he was absolutely in love with this dish!

This was easy and delicious!  The combination of rosemary, balsamic vinegar, and marmalade is wonderful.

Another recipe that has dropped off the site in my recipe box that I'm just now getting around to making.  The balsamic glaze makes a nice addition to baked salmon.
