We enjoyed this very much.Did make some adjustments, however.  I scaled the recipe to four servings and it made quite a bit; enough for 6 people. A couple of the reviews mentionned dryness so I cooked the noodles first. No problem with moisture.  Instead of whole wheat bread, I used polish rye.  I used the food processor since it is a hard bread and this worked well. I melted 2 tablespoons of butter in a skillet and then added the crumbs until butter was absorbed.  I think the adjustments made a creamier, more flavorful dish.

This recipe is fantastic! I did adjust a bit however, cooking the noodles first and using Rye Bread crumbs, and the results were great! A real crowd pleaser!

This was absolutely delicious! It tasted just like a reuben sandwich. I had extra kielbasa, so I also increased the noodle amount slightly and added about 2 heaping tablespoons of sour cream to the soup/milk mixture. Warm, creamy and very comforting. I'll make it again for sure.

I took this to a family potluck where it went over very well, but I thought it was missing something. The second time I made it I added caraway seed to the soup mixture and used rye bread crumbs instead of whole wheat.

I was recommended this recipe when asking what to do with kielbasa on the recipe exchange. I only used one can of sauerkraut that I rinsed and drained/pressed the water out of VERY well. I used two packages of kielbasa that I sauteed with a whole onion, then drained off the fat. I also made my own breadcrumbs and cooked the egg noodles a bit before layering them in the casserole. This recipe makes A LOT, so if you have a family who eats bigger servings then this would be eight servings. This filled a whole 9x13 glass baking dish. This was good, but I think it could be better, like with a thousand-island type homemade dressing, using chopped pickles instead of cream of mushroom soup with mustard. Perhaps with sour cream and ketchup? As is, it's a tasty casserole, though.

Excellent flavor (if you like sauerkraut!)--just beware, this is very filling! Although the leftovers are quite yummy too. I have made half the recipe and it works well in my square casserole. I made it with turkey kielbasa and 98% fat free mushroom soup and it still tasted great! UPDATE: Made this again with rye bread crumbs and it really is much tastier. I cooked for 45 minutes at 350 then took off the foil and stuck it under the broiler for 5 minutes to toast the crumbs...the best!

Very good! A sprinkle of caraway seeds on top of the sauerkraut adds a nice touch. Next time I make this I will use crushed rye crackers for the topping instead of bread crumbs.

This is a great recipe! I am Housemother of 10 teens and triple the recipe to feed my crew. I have made this many times now, have given the recipe to other Housemothers, staff and friends. An easy recipe that is tasty (even for the non-sauerkraut eaters!)and easy on the budget. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is so unusual but my family really liked it.  After reading that some had a problem with dryness, I added the whole package of sauerkraut, liquid and all into the pan.  It came out nice and moist.  Also, because I had some in the freezer, I made the bread crumbs out of pumpernickel bread and it was really yummy.  Thanks for a different, but good recipe.

This was pretty good and the left overs reheat well. Like many others I cooked the noodles first. I think next time I make this I'll mix the egg noodles, soup mixture, sausage and  together sauerkraut and bake that way. Next time may add a little thousand island. Thanks for the recipe:)

This is a good recipe, being polish I love all the ingredients and flavors. The only reason I did not give this five stars is because I felt it wasn't out of this world, but something I will continue to make. Other reviewers mentioned that it didn't taste like a reuben or added thousand island...I completely disagree. This is POLISH reuben, not a traditional reuben flavor, and it not supposed to taste entirely the same. Thanks for a tasty polish recipe!

I gave this recipe 4 stars, because it is very good, but to say it tastes like a reuben, is in my, and my 40 yr. old daughters opinion, a real stretch. She can be a food critic to reckon with, and believes she's a Reuben sandwich aficianado, however, both she and I did like this casserole. The only change I made was to add a couple of Tblsp of Thousand Island drsng. to the soup mix.

Great recipe. I didn't adjust anything as it was the first time I made it and we all enjoyed it very much. If you like kielbasi and kraut, you'll enjoy this recipe.

This was very yummy! Could definitely use a little more spice... not sure with what though. I used rye bread crumbs and didn't have any onions, but it was very good - definitely a keeper. And it's even better left over!! (Doesn't look quite as nice, but tastes so good!!)

EVERYONE loves this recipe - mom, grandma, all my siblings, their whole families, etc.  You do have to rinse the sauerkraut VERY well and SQUEEZE it out and rinse it again.  I always add double the mustard and onions because we like that kind of stuff.  I usually make half, and use only 1/2 pound of sausage instead of 3/4.  Next time I will try the low fat version - lowfat soup, skim milk, no yolks noodles,etc.

Another recipe my husband loved.  In fact, im sitting here typing this review while he is eating his third helping.  Polish sausage was on sale, and I had a bunch of it.  He loves Reubens, and I love trying new and unusual recipes (read weird...  this struck me as weird, but in a good way!  LOL) So I just had to try it.  My kids liked the top few layers, but avoided the saurkraut.

I followed the directions exactly as they are written.  My husband and I HATED it.  We pulled the meat out and threw the rest away.  Big waste of of money.  I had to give it one star in order to leave my comments for the review, otherwise  I wouldn’t have given it any stars.  ??

I use fresh Kraut, never canned. Dot kraut with butter. I used Fennel seed instead of Caraway. Also deleted the noodles and soups using mashed potatoes instead of noodles. Dot potatoes with butter too.  Sausage then cheese on top. The rest is just like the original recipe. Not much like the original, but we like it.

My husband and I both thought this was very good. I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings and we had plenty of left-overs for the next day. I didn't have egg noodles on hand so I substituted whole-wheat macaroni which I partially cooked and it turned out just fine. Good flavors and very filling. I'll definitely make this again!

We really liked this dish...I only had 1 can of cr. of mush soup...I filled the empty can with low fat 1000 island dressing...didn't use the mustard... didn't have bread crumbs...topped with thin slices of swiss cheese because thats all I had...next time I may try reduced fat polish sausage...

Don't worry about even adding the bread crumbs. I threw some additional swiss on at the last 10 minutes and it gives it a nice browned and bubbly casserole look and taste.  It was very flavorful, my family loved it.

Enjoyable casserole that indeed tastes like a Reuben. Adding caraway seeds was a good suggestion. Next time I'll ease off on the bread crumbs & add a tad more cheese. Good winter fare.

Just not at all what it seems it will be: not very rueben-ish, and the saurkraut is quite overpowering, and we love saurkraut!  My family demanded that I never try this recipe again in any shape or form.

My husband loved this recipe and I really liked it! He had 3 helpings and I had 2! 
I made a few changes
1. I left out the onions and bread crumbs
2. added chopped cabbage and 1/2 the saurkraut amount (wouldn't add cabbage again)
3. used turkey kielbasa
4. used 98% fat free low sodium cream of mushroom soup.
5. after baking for an hour I broiled it for 8 minutes to brown the kielbasa a bit

This was SO EASY to make-  I will definitely keep this recipe!

Absolutely yummy casserole! So easy to fix and makes lots for leftovers! Depends of course how many mouths are being fed - casserole nice and creamy - not dry at all! Tastes like a Reuben Sandwich. Will fix many times again! RECOMMENDED!

I love this recipe!  I halved it, and add sliced tomatoes on top, and, like another reviewer, use rye bread crumbs or pieces in top.

Very good dish. Made several changes though. I added caraway to the bread crumbs. It needed more liquid to cook the noodles. Added 2 cups of chicken stock to the soup mix. sautéed the onions and saurkraut and then added the kielbasa and sautéed for a few minutes. Made it like the recipe, but added the bread crumbs tossed with butter fand cooked for another 20 minutes, uncovered after the initial 1 hour cook time.

I love this recipe!  I use skim or 1% milk, Campbells Healthy Request Cream of Mushroom, turkey keilbasa  and whole wheat egg noodles. I also use less cheese. I have also tried different mustards but our preferred is spicy brown.

I have been making this for years I got the recipe out of a cookbook I bought years ago. I have made some adjustments throughout the years to perfect it. I do not drain the sauerkraut all the way we love the flavor and it keeps it moist, i add extra noodles and I put extra mustard in the soup mixture till it's a nice yellow color. I also take the foil off and broil the top at the end to brown the bread crumbs! We serve it with thousand island dressing on the side. So awesome and have had people begging for the recipe:)

I've been making this for years and it's delicious.  I don't bother with the breadcrumbs anymore and I use sliced (instead of shredded) Swiss on top for a nice even melt every time.  Using a 9x13 it takes a little less than one 7oz. package of cheese, but I always throw the extra on to cover gaps and make it extra gooey.

I have given this 4 stars as opposed to 5 because I tweaked many things thus changing the recipe.  First, I was careful to rinse the sauerkraut quite heavily and squeeze it dry.  I think this got rid of the strong flavor.  Maybe this was an error though, as my husband thought this made it a "little bland".  Next time a quick rinse would be better.  I also added quite a bit of Thousand Island dressing to carry on the Reuben taste.  This added extra flavor and made it creamier after cooking.  I also changed the crumb topping to a rye bread option.  I cubed 6 pieces of rye and tossed in the same amount of butter which made a nice , toasty topping similar to the sandwich.  I, too, added caraway seeds like many other reviews suggest.  Adding a pinch of brown sugar is another option to tame the bite of sauerkraut.  This was a good recipe but with the creamy dressing, creamed soups, cheese, and egg noodles this may not be a good selection for those counting calories!

I loved this recipe but I also love a crock pot , the only things I have changed was I layered it like lasagna , 2 layers and added thousand inlands over the sauerkraut on the second layer,I did not use bread crumbs because I wasnt browning, I also used over 2 lbs of sausage, I cooked the noodles for a few minutes first and that was a 12 oz bag, I put the crock on high till it started cooking and set it on low for 3hrs and it was awsome good, not dry or burned. everyone raved over it,will make this again and again

We enjoyed this, but there is something missing. Can't pu tmy finger on it. And I would mix some of the swiss cheese in with the mushroom-milk mix next time.. I would also use less sauerkraut.
