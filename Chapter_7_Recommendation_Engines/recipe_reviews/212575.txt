pretty good SOUP recipe, I wouldn't really call it a stew.  Instead of chili pepper I used 1/4 c McCormicks taco season mix and 1 t creole season for spice.  Good base, could easily add more veggies or maybe black beans to make it heartier.  More than likely will make again.

I really enjoyed this recipe, it was similar to a family recipe I've been making for years only different seasonings, and this has much better flavor! I left out the water as I prefer a thicker stew. We are going to be making this again!

Easy, fast, tasty and filling. Doesn't get a whole lot better than that. I made a few changes but nothing that affected the overall taste of the dish. Worked for my family!

I plopped a can of biscuits on top to finish it off at the end, before topping with the cheddar cheese. It was delicious, but there wasn't enough spice-so I would add a bit more "south of the border" next time!
