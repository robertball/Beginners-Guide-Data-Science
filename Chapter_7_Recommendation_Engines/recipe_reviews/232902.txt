The brownie part never baked, after leaving in an extra 5 minutes.
Next time I will spray the pan, and line it. The topping seem to run under the parchment paper. I use it as a pudding cake; cut the top into squares and spoon the liquid batter over the top.

This was a gooey mess that didn't even resemble brownies. It tasted decent, but not super fudgy.

Okay so I was a little Leary on trying this based in the reviews, but really wanting something sweet that I could eat with no eggs I gave it a try. My husband and I liked it very much. What I did different was doubled the recipe. And then yes it was soupy until I turned it over onto a cookie sheet then the bottom because a great topping for the brownies. Knowing this now I will make them again. I think that part was left off the original recipe.

There was way too much liquid! I poured on the brown sugar, cocoa and water and it didnt dissolve. Itboiled the brownies! Poured out about1/2 cup of liquid after itbaked!
