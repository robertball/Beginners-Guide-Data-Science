Not bad. I made my own Teriyaki sauce by adding equal parts reduced sodium soya sauce, brown sugar and garlic. Worked out really well! Will make again.

This was really good.  I tossed a few cashews in the pan too, which added a nice little crunch.

Stir fry veggies is a great way to get kids to eat their veggies! I found fresh shitake mushrooms, Really meaty and flavorful ! Empty the fridge, this will give you a great side dish for your meal. Thank You Kierston.  :):)
