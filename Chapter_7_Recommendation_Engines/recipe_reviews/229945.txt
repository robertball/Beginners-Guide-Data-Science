I used this brine in conjunction with the Herb-Glazed Roasted Turkey, also on Allrecipes.com, so it's tough to say if the brine was totally successful in doing what it was supposed to accomplish.  However, my turkey was moist and tasty, so I figure it probably did what it was supposed to do.
A quick warning though.... "Ready in about 1 1/4 hours" is WAY off!  I "set aside to cool completely".... In fact, it sat on my deck in 40 degree weather to cool down and after 4 hrs it was still close to 60 degrees.  Not a temp to start brining a turkey!  Make this WAY ahead of time and allow to cool.  Don't wait until the last minute.

I have never brined a turkey before. This was the best turkey I had ever made! My family was very impressed. Will always use the brining method in the future.

This was a great, simple recipe.  I couldn't find vegetable stock, which is required for most other brines, but I had almost everything for this recipe.  I only had dried herbs, but it still worked great.  This gives the turkey a nice juicy flavor, without a lot of herb and citrus notes that you find in other brines.  I brined the turkey for 24 hours before roasting.

I have used this for four years now. My family was scared it would destroy their traditional roasted turkey. After eating it they would not want me to switch back to no brine!

Was great! Made my turkey very juicy. Just be careful to not keep the turkey in for too long as it does make it very salty.

I followed recipe using everything it called for.  Turkey was 17# and i left it in brine for 24 hours in the garage fridge.  Insanely moist, but a little on the salty side. i may cut down brine time next year.

Great brine!  Used 1.5 gallons of water (1 gallon boiled with salt and 0.5 gallon of cold water after boiling), no allspice berries and added a couple of extra bay leaves.  Soaked turkey for 14 hours.

Wow!  What a difference this brine made.  Unless you really add a lot of allspice berries (which you can if you like that flavor), the difference is subtle but adds just the right flavor and a ton of moisture.  We cooked our nearly 20lb bird on a wood grill (Traeger) for 4 hours and it was hands down the best turkey we've ever had/made.
