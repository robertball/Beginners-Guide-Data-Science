We were not the biggest fans of this pie.  Both my husband and I are chocoholics, but, this pie was unbelievably sweet and too rich.  The texture was heavier than a cheesecake and never fully set up.  The crust was also a little wet, so, it was difficult to get out of the pie pan.  I made an unsweetened whip cream with a little vanilla to cut some of the sweetness.
