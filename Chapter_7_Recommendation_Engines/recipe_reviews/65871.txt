Excellent glaze. I sliced a small pre-cooked ham, "rubbed" the slices with the sugar mixture and heated it in a frying pan with a bit of butter. Everyone loved it. The lime juice helps cut down on the sweetness.

This was excellent and easy - didn't have lime so used orange zest/juice which was excellent. The sauce this made was so good that I couldn't stop 'sampling'. I will definitely make this again.

I omitted the dry mustard and pecans just because I didn't have them on hand, and this was still amazing!  I'm embarrassed to admit I stood over the empty roaster pan and picked the crunchy sugar topping out of the bottom it was so good.  I used a freshly smoked ham from a local farm, and I will never buy another processed ham.

Excellent combination of spices for the rub!  I also added 1/2 cup of pineapple juice to the bottom of the pan which complimented it so well.

i doubled this recipe--except for the cloves--to use on a 16 lb ham.  i put it on with 45 min left and covered the ham with tinfoil, and it came out perfectly.  everyone loved it.

I just made this last night and it turned out delicious!  I could not keep my son's fingers away while I was slicing it for dinner.  Definitely add the glaze.  It makes the ham!

This makes a great Rub.  I also used a pre-cooked ham - sliced it, brushed some of the rub on each piece and heated them in my electric skillet for about 15 minutes.  Delicious!
