I made this recipe much like some of the other reviewers who recommended adding more seasoning. I used a little chopped onion, crushed garlic, and various spices including a couple bay leaves. I think the lemon pepper was a nice touch. I added about 1/8 cup of skim milk over the top once all the soup was spread around. I hoped this would make the sauce less dense. I put my slow cooker on 8 hours and it was done within 7. It was very flavorful and not too thick. The potatoes and carrots were done perfectly and the chicken was moist. My husband loved it. He suggested adding some corn to the mix for more color and veggies. I will make this again. Thanks!

This was a hit with all four of my kids and my hubby.  I used frozen bagged chicken breast and the meal was a hit with everyone.  I give it a 5 because the kids had 3 small helpings (not usual).  The vegi's and potatoes were soft and not mushy and the chicken was not dry, perfect.

I did my own version (using what I had in the house). I used cream of mushroom, chicken, carrots, and potatoes like normal, but instead of cream of chicken soup, I used golden mushroom and garlic soup. I didn't mix the two soups... just smeared them over the top... and then sprinkled garlic salt over the whole deal. Was very nummy.

I used one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of celery because that's what I had in the house. I used 3 frozen chicken breasts. I added the garlic powder, salt, pepper, poultry seasoning, and minced onion to this recipe. I didn't put it in the slow cooker until 1 PM, so I cooked it on high until 4 PM then cut it down to low until 6:30 and it was done. I thought it was good, but still needed a little tweaking. Next time, I will use the potato flakes to make a thicker gravy, and I will season the carrots and potatoes too before putting the chicken on top of them. I felt the veggies could have used some salt and pepper. Overall, very easy and hearty...will make again with slight alterations.

Very delicious and easy to make. I put everything in the crock pot and went to work. When I came home, I had a delicious dinner for myself and my 3 waiting, very hungry, children. The only thing I added was a tiny bit of salt. I will definately make this recipe often.

This was ok.  I used minced garlic instead of garlic salt and I added half an onion.  It smelled great, but was bland.  It was quick and easy and would be great with some more spices, I'm just not the best at experimenting in the kitchen.  I don't know if I'll bother making it again because of my lack of skill in that area.

I have been trying new slow cooker recipes because it's football season and we don't get home until about 9pm to have dinner.  Slow Cooker meals make life much easier.  I thought this recipe was really good!  I did add 1 can of corn, which was a nice addition.  My teen and pre-teen loved it.  My 6 year old didn't want to touch it with a ten foot pole, until he tasted it, then he loved it too.  We used about 3 lbs of chicken breasts, 5-6 regular potatos, 1/2 bag of baby carrots, 1 can corn, 1 can cream of chicken, 1 can cream of mushroom, garlic salt, a little milk, and some spices added by my husband.  This made enough for my family of 5 with some leftovers.  I will definetly make this again.

I followed this recipe exactly, but I have to say that it wasn't enjoyed by the whole family. My nine-year old daughter, mother-in-law, seven-year old daughter, and i enjoyed it. My ten-year old daughter did not like it at all... she said it was weird.

4.5, very good!  No added salt (soups have enough salt) but did add Mrs Dash garlic, ground pepper and minced garlic and onion as per previous reviewers.  Also added a dozen or more small button mushrooms that were at their prime.

the chicken was etremely juicy & tender,  but the veggies were  just  ok in this gravy.  I seasoned my chicken prior to adding the soup mixture (galic, onion pwdr, italian seasoning, seasoning salt, and pepper)  also seasoned potatoes & carrots.  I would malke again but would probably only cook the chicken this way and make different side dishes.

Delicious!  I add fresh sliced mushrooms, chopped onion, minced garlic, and half a packet of onion soup mix for extra texture and flavor.  I omitted the potatoes because I served it over home-made mashed potatoes.  I cut the chicken breasts into cubes which was great because they are smaller bites and they fall apart in the pot.  Yum!  Everyone LOVED this meal.  We all ate if for lunch the next day.  I will definitely make this again!

We enjoyed the veggies, they tasted great in the sauce, but somehow the chicken didn't taste that great, we found it to be bland.  I would almost be tempted to cook this just with the veggies.  Not sure if I will try again, but thanks for the recipe.

A huge hit in my family. The only thing I would change is cooking for 7 hours instead of 8. The chicken was a little dry.

Very good! the thing I love about recipes like this is that they are versitile, I only had yukon gold potatoes but they worked great! Also the creams soups I had were cream of chicken and herbs and a can of cream of chicken and mushroom. It turned out so well and my chicken went in frozen! Makes great left overs the next day!

This was so tasty. I did add basil, thyme, onion and black pepper because my family loves these. I doubled the recipe and luckily it barely fit in my crockpot. I cooked on low for 5 hours and high for 4 hours due to time. The chicken and veggies were tender.

I almost gave this 3 stars because I thought it was a bit bland, but ended up giving it four due to how easy it was to make, and because the chicken came out really tender. I will definitely make this again and just customize it a little. A good start!

I like these versatile recipes, you can add whatever your family enjoys.  This one in particular lacks the "wow" factor but I still appreciate the springboard aspect.  I like throwing something in the crock pot so family & friends can feast at their leisure.  Thanks Jenet.

I decided to put Lawry's seasoning salt on four boneless chicken breasts before layering the soup on top. I also put S&P on the carrots and potatoes, to season them a bit. I only had one can of condensed cream of chicken soup, so I put in about a cup of organic french onion soup that I had leftover in the fridge. I really got busy with the spices: chives, parsley, black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, and a little bit of coriander. I liked the suggestion of putting Italian bread crumbs on top, so I did that during the last hour. I put the crockpot on high for four hours and then turned in down to low for the final fifth hour. Wow, what a tasty meal! It has a stew feel to it and the chicken is so tender, it is easily cut with a fork. The gravy came out amazing, full bodied and earthy. I did not have to thicken it at all. No knife is necessary with this meal. This dinner was excellent and so easy to do. I highly recommend it for busy folks. If you have a fairly new cooker, you can halve the cooking time for speedier results.

Absolutely love this, as does my husband. I've made it a couple different times now, both times tweaking it just a little bit. If you make it as I think it would be a little bland. Plus my husband and I both like lots of veggies and seasoning. I layered some yellow onion, baby red potatoes, celery, carrots and chopped garlic into the slow cooker, added 3 pieces of chicken breast, and sprinkled some salt and pepper on to all of it. Then I mixed a can of cream of chicken with a can of cream of mushroom, added some pepper, basil, crushed red pepper, and oregano. Poured that over the chicken and vegetables, and added some chicken broth. Comes out creamy and delicious with a lot of flavor. :)

Pretty good... Be sure to season - S&P - the chicken before you add and cut into chunks. Added rosemary.
Pretty good...

i'm giving this recipe a 3 because i made so many additions, i can't honestly say this original recipe was the best.   However, by adding 1/2 onion, 4 cloves garlic, 1 cup corn, approximately 1 cup milk, and approximately 1 tsp each of black pepper and thyme, this soup was sooo good i could hardly stop eating it!  Also, I only used 3 chicken breasts, 2 cans cream of mushroom soup (no chicken soup at all), and omitted the garlic salt. - i cooked in my crockpot for 4 hours and served with sourdough rolls.

Made this yesterday for dinner with minor changes. As we prefer dark chicken meat, I used boneless skinless thighs and trimmed off as much excess fat as I could. Used Bunny Love Carrots halved. cooked on high setting for 3-1/2 hours. Came out perfect and the family says it's a keeper

My family loved this dish. My kids ate seconds. But I added an envelope of dry onion soup mix, salt, pepper and garlic powder. Will make this again.

This was really good.  The only thing I would change is adding a little bit of spice, my boyfriend suggests soy sauce for a tad bit more flavor.

This was very good!!  I read reviews and revised as follows:  I added two fresh cloves of garlic, minced, about 1/2 tsp of lemon pepper, fresh pepper, and 1/3 cup red wine to the soup mixture.  Then after pouring over the chicken I placed two bay leaves on top.  This was surprisingly yummy, tender and juicy.  Everyone loved it.

This recipe did not work for me.  It just tasted bad.  I used regular potatoes, added a few spices.  The chicken was cooked well and tasted great.  The potatoes were not good, and we did not care for the sauce.  We pulled the chicken out and ate it separately.

Quick and simple.  In my small slow cooker I used one large chicken breast and only one can of cream of mushroom soup.  I also added a package of Lipton onion soup mix and some frozen peas.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was loved by all. Having 4 kids in the house, I supersized it a bit, adding more chicken, soup, and veggies.I also added more garlic than suggested along with seasoning salt and fresh ground peppercorns. Even my pickiest kid loved it! I expected to have a large bowl of leftovers, but to my astonishment the kids all went back for seconds. (I'm not sure there's even enough for dads dinner when he gets home tonight!)

I made this for dinner last night. Since I could not buy just 4 chicken breast I ended using 6. I also put in more potatos and a small bag of small carrots. I also added an extra can of cr. of chicken soup and a 1/4 cup of water. My husband and daughter (who is very picky) thought is was awesome!!! My husband said "make sure you make this again.

This recipe wasn't anything spectacular, but it was cheap, easy, and hit the spot. Plus it's really easy to modify and add spices to satisfy your individual tastes.  I'll definitely be making it again with some onion next time!

This was not good at all! It was very bland even after I added the spices other reviewers suggested. It was so bad that my fiancee opted for a microwave pot pie over this meal after he tasted it. I had high hopes because it was such an easy meal to prepare.

I thought this was just okay. It was too salty in my opinion and had a 'preservative' kind of taste to it. The boyfriend loved it though. I wouldn't make it again unless he wanted it.

This was SO easy to make. I added a little water just enough to cover the bottom of the crock pot and winged it as far as seasoning went. The chicken was falling apart so I tore it into chunks and made kind of a chicken stew with it. Over all I thought it was a good dish.

I just made this recipe tonight and it was amazing. I changed it a little by adding some italian bread crumbs on top of the chicken in the last hour of cooking and it added a nice crispy shell. I also cooked it 4 hours on high and 2 on low because I didnt have the time. But i will defintly make it again it was amazing and juicy and the potatoes and carrotts had a lot of good flavour.

I'm not sure if I would make this again. Based on the ingredients listed and the reviews, it seemed like it would be way too bland for me.   I added a packet of onion soup, like someone suggested, and a little bit of milk at the end to make it creamier (The soups undiluted were too gelatinous for me). I probably should have only added half a package. It had too strong of an onion flavor. It also didn't look very appetizing. It was ok overall, I guess.

Won't make this again. The chicken was dry, and the entire dish just didn't have much flavor. If I make it again, I'll do my own version with more liquid, more spices, maybe some white wine in the cream sauce.
