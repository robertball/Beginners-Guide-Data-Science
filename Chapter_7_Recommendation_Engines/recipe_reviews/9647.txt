Do NOT use unsweetened chocolate - it makes the recipe taste horrendous.  We had much better success when we switched to semi-sweet - did not get the strange, twisted faces from people tasting the bitter chocolate.

Interesting treat.  I used almond extract instead of vanilla as the submitter suggested and I am glad I did because even with it the base almost tasted like butterscotch.  I can't imagine using sweetened chocolate if you follow the recipe for the base.  I did as instructed and used unsweetened and still found for my taste, I could cut the sugar back.  Thanks, Gayla
