Delicious!!! A big hit.  I used cool whip instead of whipping cream. It was much easier.

This tired out very well and was so simple to make.  I increased the Nutella and used a large pre-made graham cracker crust.  Did not change any other aspect of the recipe. I thought about adding a sweetener for the whipped cream frosting but I am glad I did not as the rest of the pie made the whipped cream topping perfect partner.
