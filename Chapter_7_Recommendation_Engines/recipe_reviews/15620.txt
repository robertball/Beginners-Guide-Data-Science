Great recipe. I served it with a pork roast and it was awesome.  Definitly serve at room temperature.  I tasted it cold and thought it's alright but when I had it later after sitting out it was ALRIGHT!!!

As easy as it gets (just have to remember to factor in the 4-6 hours of marinating time) and tastes fantastic.

This was just the "pickled" beet recipe I was looking for.  So easy and so good.  Only change was to substitute Splenda for sugar.  Excellent!

Nice and refreshing. I put the mustard, sugar, and vinegar w/out boiling it (i forgot to do that part) & it still came out very nice. Very refreshing but not out of this world.

We have eaten this all year!  I was looking for a recipe like the salad my grandmother used to make, and this was so refreshing and wonderful.  The first time I made it my husband licked the bowl clean!

Any substitutions happened after we'd made it "by the book" the first time. I did use fresh beets all summer from our CSA, boiling them in their skins and then peeling and slicing them.

The most major change I made was adding heaps of fresh dill to the recipe, which my aunt commented on specifically at our summer BBQ ("I never would have thought to add dill, but it's amazing).  DISCLAIMER: you have to like dill to add it!  LOL.

We also added lots of onion, and slices of cucumber and radishes.  Sometimes I used jarred mustard and sometimes mustard powder.  I reserved a little bit of the beet water when I boiled it, and added that to the vinegar/sugar marinade.  

Only rule is that you have to refrigerate it for a while to get the full effect.  Delicious!  Thank you!

Easy, great reviews and pretty too. Easy enough for a family dinner and special enough for company. It's a keeper. Sliced canned beets were all I had on hand & worked well chopped.

This is a wonderful recipe.  Reminds me of my mothers home made pickled beets.  I like this salad chilled instead of room temerature as suggested.  I will make this dish for the next outdoor BBQ we attend.

I was surprised at how quickly this salad went.  Everyone loved it.  I used red wine vinegar instead of white, because that's what I had, and it was great.

Mmm.  I needed an easy-to-transport side dish & this did the trick! I cut the beets into strips (think slivered almond shape) which made it easy to spoon.  I followed the recipe to the letter & it tasted great.  Thanks, Myra!

Great recipe!  Instead of the prepared mustard I used powdered and I added a couple dashes of ground cloves (a tip I learned from the owner of one of our favorite restaurants).  So easy, nutritious  and delicious!  Thanks Myra for sharing!

I misread the recipe and used cider vinegar and it was good.  I diced the onions and used white instead of red, as I didn't have red.  Next time I will definitely use the red onion and slice them rather than dice.  It will make a better presentation.  Definitely a great recipe.

Made exactly as written only letting it sit overnight. Was better after sitting out and taking the chill off. And I used sliced canned beets. Will make again. Very good!

Overall I thought this was very good. I used fresh beets because I had them and Vidalia Onion fresh from the farm. The mustard flavor was a little overpowering, so next time I may reduce it slightly. It did get better with time for all the flavors to mingle. Thanks for this recipe.

Yum! I used fresh beets, peeling them, and cooking them for about 40 minutes. I also substituted the sugar with Splenda. Even with the changes, this salad was exceptionally tasty. Thanks!

I'm not much of a beet fan, but I gave this a shot.  It was quite tasty.  We particularly enjoyed it when combined with mixed greens, topped with a little blue cheese dressing.

Made this once and have been asked to repeat several times, but have had to double the recipe every time. Reminds me of grandma's pickled beets, but so much easier!

Sooooo much better than pickled beets in a can.  Absolutely delicious and easy to make, just think ahead a little.  They are better the longer they marinate.

I made this using Splenda instead of sugar....which requires doubling the amount of Splenda to give it proper sweetness.  It was awesome!

Very good/easy.  I made approx 30 hours in advance of my party. Trippled the recipe, Used the canned beets that were already Julian cut.  Received many compliments, didn't have any left-overs.

Very good - better with fresh, roasted beets.  I have used slivered fennel instead of onion and have also topped with crumbled feta.  Quick, easy & delicious!

I love beets and will eat them right out of the can (much to my husband's dismay).  This recipe makes them a million times tastier!  Most certainly best if served at room temperature.

So easy and delicious. Step by step directions are quick and makes for a nice summer salad. Even my nephew who is picky tasted it and said it was ok. So that is a huge compliment. LOL I used yellow onion because that was what I had on hand. The juice was the best part. Mmmm.

These were excellent! They are nice refreshing side at a bbq or to keep around as a colorful compliment with a sandwich. I used 2 cans of beets, a few more onions but kept the sauce the same. I love beets and it's a nice way to have them on hand in the frig! Thanks!

delicious and simple and fast. I ended up sauteeing the onions, as I'm not a super-fan of raw onions. I reduced the amount of sugar, as the onion added a nice sweet caramelized flavor. I served this on top of fresh spinach.

This was straight up fabulous. My only substitute was to roast 4 large beets for approximately 60 minutes until they were tender. I mixed in the sugar, water and vinegar mixture to the sliced beets and onion. After a few hours, I plated the beets and added some chopped English walnuts and some crumbled goat cheese. I have a new favorite dish!

Perfect beet recipe! My wife never liked beets, but is now a fan. Always have some in the fridge. Usually use four cans and double the marinade. We like sliced beets... lots easier. Thanks for the recipe. It's a keeper.

I had already steamed 4 med beets in my iPot when I came here looking for a marinade for them.   The weight came to about 13.5 ounces.    I basically followed the recipe, but omitted the onions and used Apple Cider Vinegar instead of the white wine vinegar.  Very quick, easy and delicious.    Will do this again next time.

I didn't have any WWV, so I used RWV; it was good, but too sweet.  Purchased WWV and cut the sugar to 2T, but it still wasn't right.  Used RWV and 2T sugar, and it's pretty much close to perfection (as compared to a local salad bar's marinated beet salad).

I make this at least once every month. Love beets and this recipe is "the bomb". Used regular onions because that is all I had and it was great. Next time I make it I will go for the red onion. Thank you for a keeper.

I can't say enough about how delicious these marinated beets are. I would love to try them as a salad with blue cheese, cracked pepper, and arugula.

I love this beet salad and have made it quite a few times. The only thing I have changed over time is to make it less sweet. I always make it with a sugar substitute. I have used Sweet n Low and splenda and find it very sweet. It's so easy and I love having it around for a snack.
