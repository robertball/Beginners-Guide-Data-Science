Traditionally Kofta is made with finely chopped onion, minced garlic, chopped fresh parsley, salt, pepper, and paprika to taste.  My husband makes really good Kofta and that is what he normally puts.

I reviewed all the reviews and then made some more changes, this was perfectly yummy! First off, I used 1/2 ground beef (80/20) and 1/2 ground lamb (85/15). You want to use meat with a bit more fat on the grill to keep it juicy. The onion is really better if you mince or run through a food processor; I used a Vidalia, it was sweet and juicy! I added a cup of chopped cilantro and a 1/2 cup of chopped spearmint from the garden. I added 5 minced garlic cloves; we LOVE garlic! One more addition that makes it taste more authentic to me: 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. I also added a teaspoon of kosher salt and a teaspoon of pepper. You can see from my photo that I used kabob baskets...I cannot ever get a ground meat kabob to stick to a skewer so these are just necessary for me! (I think I am skewer-challenged!) I did NOT add an egg yolk. I grilled over high heat for 1-1/2 minutes on each of the 4 sides and they were still juicy and medium. 
Here is the final tip: I did dip my kofta in Sumac! This may be the actual flavor that some are searching for when they want authentic. Ground sumac doesn't taste all that interesting on it's own, but when you dip the meat into the powder, it brings out all different flavors. That's MY two cents on this recipe from Persia and Egypt and I hope you enjoy it as much as we did; take a look at my photos to see a kabob grilling basket!

This gets 4 stars only after I changed it quite a bit.  I didn't even try the recipe as printed because it looks so bland.I added 3 TB dry chili flakes. 2TB each minced ginger & garlic. 1 small diced red onion. 1 whole egg instead of just the yolk, and a bunch of chopped fresh cilantro. I think you would normally do parsley instead of cilantro but I just love cilantro.

My dear, I have never been to the Middle East, but your kofta recipe certainly transported me there! A delicious blend of spices and flavors and a simple method of cooking. I did add some paprika and fresh cilantro, and the flavors were exotic. I served it with homemade hummus, pocket bread and the Eggplant Curry, and couscous from the website, and WOW! A very picky eater with our dinner guests had thirds! And lots of compliments. Thanks for a superb addition to my recipe collection.

These were ok. My Egyptian husband said they were fine but I think next time we will try other spices to make them taste better. We did use metal skewers and that did not work well. Stick with bamboo or other wood.

I was hoping for something unique with this, but was disappointed with the results.  Mine turned out like a dry, hotdog shaped meatloaf.  It didn't have the Mediteranian flavor I was looking for.  I stuck with the original recipe, except to add paprika, as one reviewer suggested.  I also broiled it in the oven rather than cooking it on the grill.

This is the first time I ever made – and ate – kofta. I loved it! It’s easy to make, simple ingredients, quick and easy cooking. I would love a bit more flavor

I used a full egg, not just the yolk. It helped to keep the meat together and in shape. It was difficult to turn each one on the grill; perhaps I didn’t pack them tight enough or perhaps they’re supposed to be that way.

I’ll definitely cook these again!

I agree with Serena 100%. This recipe needs modifying, no oregano.  I used whole onion, 2-3 tbsp fresh chopped parsley, one clove garlic, 1/2 tsp paprika, 1/4tsp salt, pepper.

My Turkish friend adds chilli, mint and cumin to taste and olive oil. But not oregano. The shape varies to the style of cooking: whether it's over wood fire; BBQ; Grill; Bake in the oven or fried. If fried shape into small, flat disks to cook faster (only a small amount of olive oil to fry). Lamb or Beef are the preferred meats but chicken or pork are alternatives.

My family and our guests loved this... Delish! I have to say that for one I didn't fire up the outdoor grill, I used my indoor one. I didn't put them onto skewers either, not necessary with the grill I used... Waste not, want not, right? I did follow the advice of another reviewer (Serena) and changed the recipe a little. I minced garlic and onion. Instead of oregano, I used parsley. I also added paprika. I wish I could tell you how much but I just eyeballed it and put as much as I thought would be good. lol  Served this with the Quinoa Tabbouleh recipe from this site.  Yummy in our tummys! :)

great! I added a ton of spices to make it taste a bit more authentic. I served over cuscus and stewed vegetables.
