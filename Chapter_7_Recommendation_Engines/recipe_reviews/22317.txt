****Increase oven temp to 450**** This will brown them & cook the same time. Cooking at 350 steams them and the bread crumbs fall off. Did add more seasonings to them. Other than that good recipe:)

THIS RECIPE IS GREAT ONLY I CHANGED IT A BIT. MIX POTATOES W/OLIVE OIL, THEN DRIZZLE BUTTER OVER POTATOES-THEN SPRINKLE GARLIC SALT OVER ALL THE POTATOES AND ELIMINATE THE BREAD CRUMBS. DIE AND GO TO HEAVEN AS I SAY. THEY ALMOST TAST LIKE POTATO CHIP. YUMMMMIEEEEEEEEE.

I was looking for a recipe for potatoes to do with dinner tonight and ran across this one.  I used this recipe as a base for Ranch Potato Wedges!  I kept the breadcrumbs, but I added a packet of Ranch dressing seasoning.  I also used olive oil for a healthier substitute.  They were PERFECT!  Awesome recipe!

These were wonderful!  I put olive oil in a zip lock baggie and shook the wedges in there to coat.  I crushed up crutons and put them in a second baggie with some extra salt and pepper.  I then shook up the wedges in the second baggie.  I cooked them on 450 until brown without turning.  Absoulutely wonderful!  I will definitely make these again.  So easy to make and better than french fries because you can actually taste the potato. And as a bonus, my husband loved them!  He dipped them in ranch and said he wouldn't have changed a thing about them!

These were absolutely awsome!!! I changed the recipe a little! I used olive oil instead to be even more healthy and I put some garlic powder, Season salt, a little bit of cayenne pepper, a little Mrs Dash, and Herb Poultry seasoning (kinda like Italian Seasoning) and they were a lot better than I thought they would be! Also they are a really healthy version of the French Fry. I also cooked them a little more than the recipe said! Totally would recommend them to anybody!!!! I even saved the breadcrumb mix so I can make them again.

Everyone loves these!!!!!!! Used on both russet and fiana potatoes. Came out crispier with russet. I added a tablespoon of grated parmesan cheese to the breadcrumbs and wedges came out wonderful! Will make this regularly from now on.

This was good! I made it with dinner, and my boyfriend LOVED it. Some advice, though: cut down the butter, or replace with olive oil.

I made these to go with supper tonight, and my family absolutely loved them.  I admit that I dipped my wedges in olive oil instead of brushing them with butter, but the whole idea of using seasoned bread crumbs is brilliant.  I made my own bread crumbs by grating some of our homemade bread and tossing in a little Italian seasoning and cracked black pepper (we have young kids who aren't really keen on lots of spices).  I can't wait to make these again, and I'm sure my family feels the same way!

These were good.  I sprayed my baking sheet with Pam and I used margarine instead of the butter in order to make it a little healthier.  I did use all of the breadcrumbs and I seasoned my wedges with onion powder, garlic powder, season salt, pepper and paprika. They turned out great.  I baked them for about 45 minutes and I turned them up to 400 at the end so that they would brown/carmalize.  I also added about a handful of parmesan cheese before baking.

I tried this recipe yesterday and everyone loved it! I was scared the potatoes wouldn't turn out soft enough in the middle so i microwaved the cut wedges for 5 minutes on high with a bit of water. It turned out perfect after baking.

I added the 1/3 of a ranch packet to the breadcrumbs as suggested by another reviewer and the family devours them.  I also use red potatoes because that is what I usually get in my veggie co-op box.  I have made this several times now. YUM

You might be my hero. I've been trying to figure out how to make restaurant-style potato wedges without frying them or buying them, and this was it. I used Yukon Golds and seasoned bread crumbs. I added a little salt/pepper/parmesan, and I found that the breadcrumbs that were cooked on the bottom side of the wedge were the best part of the fries, all mashed together into the potato. Cooked at about 410F. I've never been so excited about potatoes!! Thank you!

Actually I have to give this a bad review more because of my error more then anything, but they still weren't good. We followed the recipe including "rolling" them in bread crumbs (which is a mistake). They came out done pretty much right but there was waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too much bread crumbs. I would recommend maybe just sprinkling some on the potatoes with some other seasonings. I guess I would try to make these again but I would never roll them in the bread crumbs again...it was like eating a mouthful of sand.

I did change the recipe. I didn't use bread crumbs at all or butter. I just cut the potatoes into wedges, coated them with olive oil and sprinkled them with garlic salt and seasoned salt and baked them about 40 mins. They were awesome!!

Pretty good.  I ground up buttery round crackers instead of bread crumbs and mixed in 2 TBS parmesan cheese and some ranch mix.  I coated them with olive oil and baked them at 450 for the same amount of time.  Crispy and great flavor.

Use olive oil, and bake at 450.  They get brown and crispy instead of mushy.  I sprinkled them with Montreal Steak Seasoning, and they were de-lish!  The next day I cut up the wedges and fried them and sprinkled grated cheese on top, and had a fast breakfast that everyone RAVED over.  This is a winner!

We liked this alot,  I sliced them into thin wedges and left the skin on. Also I added garlic powder and onion powder and grated romano cheese to the bread crumbs.  They came out crispy and very tasty,  my husband thought the breading a bit too thick, but that was my fault I really rolled them in the breadcrumbs since there were reviews complaining of the breading falling off and making a mess,  I didn't have that problem one bit, a definite keeper, thanks for the recipe !!!!

These were great. Had them last night with fried chicken. I added some of my own spices and didnt overwhelm them with bread crumbs. I poured the leftover oil in the baking sheet. Cooked about an hour. They were crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle. Perfect!! Thank You...

This was just okay for me.  I used plain breadcrumbs (it was what I had on hand) and mixed with shredded parm. cheese.  My kids liked them more then anyone!

Used butter, but used Smart Beat brand & controlled how much.   Will experiment w/ olive oil & various seasonings for the future.

This was awful. I used olive oil and cooked at 450 as the reviews recommended and it just doesn't taste good. The texture of the bread crumbs doesn't go well with the potato. I wouldn't make this again as directed, although I may try frying them.

I took the advice of another reviewer and changed the cooking temp 450.  The potato wedges turned were crispy on the outside and cooked on the insides..  I mixed the breadcrumbs with crushed up ranch flavored croutons.. I also brushed them with olive oil instead of butter.  We absoloutly loved these!  I can't wait to make them again and try different things to coat them with.

This was a good recipe, but I too modified it according to some of the suggestions. I tossed the wedges in a container with melted butter til coated and then sprinkled on about 3/4 c. plain bread crumbs and tossed again to coat well. I transferred them to a greased baking pan, covered it tightly with foil and baked at 400 for 30 minutes. I then removed foil and baked another 30 minutes also at 400 until fork tender. I finished them up by putting them under the broiler for maybe 15 minutes stirring every few minutes until browned. My family really liked them and suggested that they would be a good basis for the cheesy fries we sometimes make with nacho cheese, sour cream, chopped onions, bacon, etc. over hot fries. Or perhaps as a basis for chili fries with chili and cheese over them. They were good, but denfinitely not a quick dish to prepare.

I modified this a bit. I brushed wedges with olive oil then sprinkled cajun seasoning and dry Good Seasonings Garlic Herb dressing mix. I baked longer than 20 min. I put skin side down on foil and baked till they were tender and golden on top. Did not add crumbs. These were very good to go with roasted chicken.Thanks Sue!

WHEN I do make these again, I will also (as others suggested) just use the olive oil and/or butter, season them (cayenne, paprika, garlic & onion powders) and maybe then "sprinkle" them with the bread crumbs.  They were good, but I think loosing the crumbs would be better.  I LOVE the baking aspect, as I am not the best food fryer (waiting for that fry daddy)  Thanks for a good start Sue. ;)

VERY tasty!! I used plain bread crumbs and added all-season salt and italian seasonings...mixed to taste.  Baked well and tasted better.  Only minor complaint is that a slotted spoon should be used to transfer the fries from the baking sheet to your serving dish. Doing otherwise results in excess crumbs that make it hard to find the fries among all the crumbs.  Still, will make these again and again! Thanks Sue!

Listen to everyone who says to increase your oven temp to 450. I baked mine at 350 and it did as another user stated: just steamed the potatoes and the bread crumbs fell off. I used panko breadcrumbs and although they got crispy, they were mostly on the sheet. I also just coated it olive oil and salt and pepper. I can't remember how long I baked them, but it was too long. Just increase the oven time.. all of the other recipes on AR say 400-450 for the oven time.

We all- kids and adults- loved these! 
Easy to do, just takes a bit of time in the oven.
Baked at 425 degrees for a total of 25 minutes, stirring twice.
Elminated all butter, added ranch dressing mix and a tiny sprinkle of cayenne pepper. Yummmmy! Like gourmet fries...but not fried!

Not great.  I myself did not like these, as I felt there were way too many bread crumbs in this recipe.  At least half of the bread crumbs stayed on the baking sheet soaked in butter.  Per others' suggestions, I cooked the potatoes at a higher temperature of 400 degrees for a little longer than directed.  The potatoes themselves were cooked through and tasted fine, but the bread crumbs were just overpowering.  I gave this recipe 3 stars because 2 out of 4 people who ate these potatoes liked them.  However, I myself wish I had opted for another (baked) potato wedge recipe.  I think these potatoes would have been better, had I omitted the seasoned bread crumbs all together and just used a seasoning of garlic powder, onion powder and seasoned salt.  Of course, then it would become a whole new recipe.  I won't be making this recipe again as it is written.

I did them a little differently than the recipe and they came out really good, my family loved them.  I nuked the potatoes for a few minutes, then sliced them, leaving the skins on.  I tossed them in a ziplock with olive oil and seasoned breadcrumbs.  I cooked them until they were soft at 400, and then broiled for a couple of minutes to make the outsides crisp.  Will make this again for sure.

These were really good! I used the 1/2 cup parm cheese and 1/2 cup of unseasoned bread crumbs and then added some italian seasonings to taste. I like my wedges a little crispier and baked them longer! Will def make again.

Made recipe just as suggested and found it to be very bland & had to bake the potatoes at 450 for about 30 min.  I do think the recipe is a good starting point, but, next time I'll take the reviewers suggestions and add quite a bit more seasoning.

Very tasty.  I made sure to slice the wedges thin, threw them in a zipper bag with some olive oil to coat, then dipped in the Italian bread crumbs.  They were cooked through in the given time and even warmed over pretty well.  My only complaint was that the crumbs made a mess because, though the wedges were still pretty well coated, they fell off.  Tolerable flaw.

This dish was fantastic!  I cut the wedges slightly thinner than usual and also broiled on high for the last 5 minutes.  The potatoes turned out perfectly done and my husband was scooping up the breadcrumbs and sprinkling them back over his if a bit rubbed off.

These are excellent potatos, I cut out the butter and just use the olive oil.  For the people who complain about the cooking time being wrong - It says 20 mins, THEN flip guys...  Total cooking time of 45 mins seems to work well.

Whoever says these only take 20 minutes to bake is crazy.  Mine took about 50 minutes, and even then they weren't even close to being overcooked or well-done.  My family thought there were too many bread crumbs.

Mmmm.  What a great change of pace from french fries!  I might suggest adding some salt to the bread crumbs but otherwise this was just a wonderful change of pace from standard mashed potatoes.

I have made these so many times and each time my family devouors them.  They are easy and so tasty ..  I use red potatoes  and to coat the potatoes well, I brush them with the melted butter and put them in a zip lock bag and shake them.  It makes everything stick together better.  Love these potatoes!

They were a good side dish for my sandwiches. I just had to add spices to the bread crumbs. I also used Italian seasoned bread crumbs instead.

Great recipe, but I would add my own spices on top of the seasoned bread crumbs because it was bland without doing so. Easy recipe--my three and five year old helpers were able to help coat the potatoes with bread crumbs after I painted them with butter--they absolutely got a kick out of it! :o)

Very tasty.  I reduced the bake time by boiling the wedges until almost tender.  It goes much faster.

after 25 mins at 350 they were a little soggy i just turned it up to 400 for 5-10 mins and they came out nice and crisp. i also used olive oil but instead of bread crumbs i used finely crushed crackers cornmeal and montreal steak spice for seasoning, adrian loved them and so did i!

This is an all-right basic recipe, but it's a bit ho-hum. I would DEFINITELY cook it at 450 instead of 350 (it took about 45 minutes at 350), and I think I'd tent the cookie sheet with foil for most of the cycle, as mine came out a bit dry.

Overall, the taste was OK, but you should certainly add in other spices to your liking - I added salt, pepper, and blackened seasoning. I'm sure garlic, seasoning salt, maybe even lemon pepper would kick these up a notch.

We were running pretty low on food but I needed a snack to make for a couple of last minute friends who were coming over. I didnt have bread crumbs, but I did have cheese! I spread grated cheese over all the wedges, and let them cook for an extra minute. I also cooked them at 450 degrees, as recommended by another reviewer, so they would be a little more golden. Some people dipped them in ranch, and some used salsa, but these wedges were a hit!!

Just what I was looking for!  I mixed Parmesan in with the herbed bread crumbs and left the skins on.  I had to bake mine twice as long as the directions, though.

I gave this 4 stars as i had to make some adjustments to the recipe.  The wedges turned out nice and soft on the inside and cripsy on the outside.  I left the skin on, added some salt, black pepper, garlic powder and ground thyme.  Also i omitted the breadcrumbs since most mentioned it's too messy. Overall, it was worth trying.

These potato wedges were decent..nothing much different then others except for the bread crumb coating that caused a weird consistency in your mouth.  Not sure if I would make them again and if I did I would make some slight changes.  Kind of messy to eat too...the crumb coating doesn't stick well.

Hmmm..didn't think these were anything out of the ordinary. I followed the recipe almost to a tee plus added a little more seasoning as I thought it would be a little bland.  They still were??  I also had to bake them a lot longer than what it said and I'm pretty sure that the wedges weren't overly big.  My toddlers ate 'em up though :)

I had some trouble with these... half way through, when I was turning the wedges, I noticed that they were already pretty dry. I melted more butter and poured it over the wedges before putting them back in the oven. This saved them, but it also added a lot more fat and grease than I would have liked.

These came out delicious! I left the skins on the potatos (of course after scrubbing well) and used the spray margarine, bread crumbs and some kosher salt before serving. Delicious and easy!
Thanks

These are delicious! Instead of butter, I tossed the potatoes with olive oil.  I also sprinkled seasoning salt and pepper on the wedges before I rolled them in Italian seasoned bread crumbs.

These were very good, but I would have to agree that they need to be pan-fried or deep-fried to get that crispiness that they need.

This is a unique way to make potatoes, which I'm always looking for.  The seasoned bread crumbs have a great flavor - I just add some salt when they first come out of the oven.  Very good.

I felt that seasoned bread crumbs (assuming you  have bought same from the store) wouldn't have enough seasoning for potatoes.  So, I read some of the newer reviews and I borrowed one person's idea of mixing the bread crumbs with Knorr's Vegetable Recipe Mix...hoping for more flavor...baking them for 20 minutes at 400 degrees, then increasing the oven temperature to 450 and baking until done.  I tasted the potatoes before increasing the oven temperature...just OK.  At this point I added some Lawry's seasoned salt (not heavy handed), and this seemed to give everything a boost/burst of  flavor you could taste.  To me, with potatoes, whether they're fried or baked, they just need salt!

These were okay, but not great. The texture was weird with all the breadcrumbs, and it didn’t really have much flavor. If I did try these again I would probably mix some spices in with the breadcrumbs so the flavor is better.

These were great! I rolled them in olive oil, then I mixed bread crumbs and 1 package of Knorrs vegetable soup mix and parmesan cheese.   Rolled them in this mixture and baked them at 400 degrees for 20 minutes, then increased it to 450 until they were done.

I have tried several recipes for baked or roasted potato wedges.  These were among the best.  I did make a few modifications (higher temperature more spices).  My wife loved them so much she went back for seconds.

These were great!! Having terrible acid reflux, often times I have to forgo anything potato because of the amount of grease they are cooked in. These were so nice because they were neither dry nor greasy. The only thing I did do differently is I used only olive oil, no butter. Thank you for sharing a great recipe.

I didn't think it was anything super special. made my own seasoned bread crumbs. from the reviews i thought it was going to become some sort of magic potatoes.

I gave this a try and the whole family loved it. We cook ours to be a bit more on the crispy side. And to make it a bit more healthy, we use a margarine spray to coat the potato wedges before coating with bread crumbs (and other seasonings.)

Great recipe! I used olive oil instead of butter and added parmesean cheese and ranch dressing mix to the bread crumbs. Also, I baked at 450 degrees and left the skins on. It was a hit!

These were yummy, I had to keep them in the oven a little longer then suggested but I think that was because my wedges were cut thick! I reccomend to anyone.

maybe i did something wrong... but these did not come out tasting anything close to normal. the bread crumbs didn't stick very well, and it all ended up very dry.

They were good but a little undercooked. Next time I will cook them a little bit longer. Overall they were good and a hit with my super-picky husband!

Ok. Needed a little bit more melted butter to make the breadcrumbs stick. But other than that it was really good.

I wanted to find a recipe for fries or wedges that actually crisped up a little in the oven (I use the deep fryer too much!), and this was great! I did omit the breadcrumbs, though, because I wanted to try them without. I oiled the baking sheet, oiled the fries a little, and then seasoned and baked them. Flipped them after 20 minutes, and baked until they were tender and a little crispy. Awesome! Next time, I'll try the breadcrumbs!

These are good-they take a while to get tender in the oven, so if I make these again, I may gently boil the potatoes before baking.

I agree with an earlier review to just add some seasoning to the wedges and bake without the bread crumbs.  The outside of the wedges were similar to cheesesticks but not as crunchy.  I think this recipe would be better if the wedges were fried to get a crispy coating or the cook time in the oven needs to be increased.

These were ok, I could not find seasoned bread crumbs, I just used normal ones. I also cooked way longer as to get the potatoes crispier.
