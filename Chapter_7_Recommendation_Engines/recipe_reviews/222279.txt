I am so excited to be the first person to review this recipe! This potato salad is not a 'traditional' recipe, but I think that works in its favor. I loved the tangy flavor of the vinegar, and the little bit of spice the mustard gave the salad. And the blue cheese just put this over the top. I will definitely be making this again because it was so easy to make and tasted wonderful. Thanks for sharing the recipe, Maridele!

I chose this specifically for a company picnic my husband was attending.  I guess a couple of years ago the entire office ate something bad and all came down with food poisoning, so I was hoping to avoid a similar catastrophe - ha!  Anyway, this was super easy and extremely tasty.  I used blue cheese this time but I think feta would work, too.  I made it the night before and let it sit so by the next day, it was totally ready to go!  The basil added a fresh touch that I really liked, also.  Everyone loved it, and as of today, no one's called out sick :)  Calling it a keeper.

This is an extremely delicious recipe.  I really love the mayo type potato salads- but wanted a change-and had a party of people with sophisticated palates, Plus I had an abundance of  fresh basil and chives in my garden.  Here are some tips  for a perfect outcome.  You really have to watch the cooking time. If the potatoes over cook, they will break down to mush, like mashed potatoes, so depending on how large your cubes are, they need to come out as soon as its soft enough to eat.  They need to have plenty of firmness to withstand the mixing. My cubes were approx. an inch in diameter and they were done in 10 minutes.  After they cool down to the point where they aren't profusely steaming, you need to coat them with the wet dressing, this will help stop the sticky characteristics that potatoes get as they cool.  I would also wait to add the blue cheese until serving.  Cheese can start to get runny if mixed in.  There are similar recipes on this site that add celery and pickle, and I think that would ruin this elegant and tasty dish that has such great flavors and sophistication  without being too complicated.

We all liked this. I cooked the potatoes in the microwave, stirring a couple of times, rather than boiling (about 9 min in mine). I used dried chives because I didn't have fresh and used regular reds chopped to approximate quartered new potatoes but otherwise made no changes. Served at room temp as suggested and the only change I would make is to try lessening the oil a tad next time, but that may not work. They weren't too oily, I just tend to reduce the amount we use as much as possible.  We rarely use mayo so it's nice to have another variation on one of our favorites. This is a very bold flavor though so I don't know that it is as versatile as some salads. I think it would be a nice compliment to a simple grilled steak.

This is really good potato salad, and I'm someone who usually likes mayo-based potato salads. I actually made this twice, but the first time I way overcooked my potatoes and they became almost like mashed potatoes and absorbed all the dressing, but the taste was still good. I made it again, properly, and I still liked it! The first time I didn't have any onions, so I added onion powder to dressing. This time I did have onion, so I used it but I think I would prefer it without pieces of onion. I don't know that this would be a good choice to make for a crowd; it's a lot of strong flavours that certainly wouldn't be for everyone. I found my first couple of bites of it very strong, but then it grew on me. I'll definitely make it again myself, I like all the strong flavours! Thanks Maridele for posting your recipe.

No question about whether or not this is a 5-star recipe!  Whether you use regular balsamic vinegar (especially a GOOD one--translates into expensive aged) or a white one, this recipe is PERFECT!  Oh, yum!  I made it earlier in the day and then took it out about an hour before serving so I could add in the blue cheese.  It was just plain delicious!  Thanks, Maridele!

Our neighborhood potluck during the Memorial Day weekend was a perfect opportunity to make  potato salad. I truly dislike potato salads made with mayonnaise, so I decided to try this one. It was unbelievably delicious! I made a few changes. Rather than boil the potatoes, I quartered, oiled (olive oil) and roasted them in a preheated oven for 30 minutes at 400°. I removed them from the oven before they got mushy and let them cool down before proceeding. I substituted a little red wine vinegar for some of the balsamic since I have a VERY thick, syrupy balsamic that tends to be very sweet. I used Trader Joe's Aioli garlic mustard. I wanted a salad with a bit more crunch, so I increased the amounts of the red onion,  and I also added half of a large red bell pepper, chopped. I added 2 tablespoons of chopped parsley to the basil and chives…and I doubled the amount of basil in the recipe. Finally, I substituted Trader Joe's crumbled goat cheese for the blue cheese. Wonderful blend of sweetness from the balsamic,  heat from the black pepper & mustard, crunch from the red onion and bell pepper, and tang from the goat cheese. I'm going to make this for the Fourth of July!

This is a total keeper!
I made this last night. I have recently been told to avoid eggs and needed a "no mayo" potato salad. It was awesome! My husband is picky about his potato salads and he had rave reviews for this.
I fried up a bit of Pancetta and added it as well.

So simple and fresh, we loved this potato salad! I used a white balsamic vinegar in the dressing so as not to discolor the potatoes. Thanks for sharing this, Maridele!

Recipe Group selection 5/26/12.  What a treat this is!  Nothing says summer like homemade potato salad, but I always worry about the mayo in the heat and German potato salad gets boring after a while.  I absolutely love the addition of basil and blue cheese.  This was well received by all my guests.  I used fingerling potatoes and Vidalia onion and a really good balsamic vinegar.  I will probably use white balsamic next time.  Thanks Maridele, this is a keeper!

I made this recipe as is. It very good and tasty, but next  time  i'll be making it with white balsamic, the potatoes were dark brown color ,it did not look very appetizing. So for that I will give it 3stars.

I used this as a base for Memorial Day, and it was a big hit. I doubled the recipe, but I did half balsamic and half white wine vinegar and added a couple chopped apples and cut the Bleu cheese (I knew for a fact a bunch of people weren't fans) then let it blend in the fridge overnight. Three people who claimed they hated potato salad absolutely loved it. Thanks for the recipe, would definitely make again (next time with the cheese and hopefully walnuts).

Gotta give this an A+!!!  And for those of us who must limit the starchy veggies, here are a few possible red tater substitutions that my family loves:  kohlrabi, yams, turnips, and (the kids' favorite) jicama.  :)

We are not fans of mayo in our house, so I was very pleased to find this recipe.
I used tiny fingerling potatoes, white balsamic, halved the amount of Dijon mustard, and completely omitted the blue cheese, as we also don't eat cheese in our house.
I served this at our Memorial Day picnic and everyone really enjoyed it. I will definitely make this again. Love it.

This is my go-to potato salad for some years now, as we are not so keen on mayo based dressings.We love it and it's a hit wherever I have taken it up to now! Thank you for sharing!

This was excellent; it was actually refreshing at a hot humid barbeque! I doubled the recipe; I had to really check the potatoes after about 20 minutes so they didn't overcook. I used white balsamic and shook everything in a jar, then put it together half at a time. Will definitely make again and again.

It was well received by all the ladies at our lunch.  I would like the look of it better with white balsamic but didn't have any on hand.  I added a couple tablespoons of capers and a little of the brine.  Used Feta Cheese and green onions (because that's what I had on hand) and it was terrific. I also microwaved the potatoes the second time I made it and they were much nicer.

This is DELICIOUS! I had Idaho potatoes on hand, so I used those, and they worked out fine. LOVE the basil in this, it really gives this salad a fresh, summery taste, and combined w/ the blue cheese just made this perfect. The amounts for the dressing were spot on. Hubby even asked for the leftovers to take to work tomorrow! This is gonna be a summer staple for sure~YUM! Thanks for sharing, Maridele! :)

This was really good.  I don't like mayo so I thought I'd try one with a vinaigrette.  I left out the basil and instead put in fresh dill.  I also forgot the blue cheese but I threw in some bacon bits.  Very yummy!  Definitely going to make this again.

Great just as described. We had difficulty crumbling the cheese but a fork helped immeasurably.  Might try olives in place of cheese.

I used this recipe for a family reunion, and it was a great selection for a hot day. The only changes I made (I know, I can't stand it when people make changes the first time they make the recipe, but I did it.) I substituted feta cheese in place of the blue cheese just because we prefer the feta, and I added bacon. I followed the directions and folded the cheese into the rest of the ingredients just before serving. However, I should have just added it all prior to taking it. The potato salad was still fine the next day. It held up well, and the feta was not a problem in terms of breaking down.  It's always easier to prepare the entire dish a few hours before serving it.

Great salad. I have been enjoying a variation of same potato salad recipe for many years courtesy of my German Mother-in law and now my wife makes it. We make it frequently. Differences are small and optional. Mother-in law would coarsely chop several dill pickles to add along with a good dose of the dill pickle juice. Lots of coarse ground black pepper. She used cider vinegar, I've used balsamic, love both. We also will eat it hot. Makes great sandwiches using fresh hard rolls. Shredded hard boiled eggs or pickled eggs are a must. Make a day ahead and refrigerate for better flavor. My wife was raised on this, it's great! A little touch of fresh ground horseradish is a great option also.

This was a very good alternative to traditional potato salad.  I love blue cheese so it was a no brainer for me.  I followed the recipe as is and really enjoyed the flavors.

I  have heard about Maridele's potato salad on the Buzz for a few months now and decided to give it a try. So glad I did! I made it exactly as written except for halving it as it's just the two of us. It reminds me a French potao salad, probably more appealing to adults. Next time, I will add some bacon crumbles and for my taste, use less Dijon mustard. Good job, Maridele!

This is a wonderful substitute for traditional potato salad!  I have been searching for a mayo-free and more sophisticated potato salad for my son's graduation party and I have found it!  I made a few changes including increasing the salt & pepper, adding garlic powder, omitting the basil and blue cheese and adding crumbled bacon.  It is wonderful!  Thank you for the recipe!

My basil plants are huge so I was looking for new recipes when I stumbled upon this one.  I just made it tonight and I was not disappointed!  All the flavors blend beautifully and it was incredibly easy to make!  I made the recipe exactly as directed but I'm excited to play with it next time.  Garlic salt instead of regular, flavored balsamics, flavored olive oils......the list of combinations is endless!  Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

It just didn't do it for us.  I tried to salvage it by adding mayo and some of our usual ingredients which made it just barely edible.  I may try it again in a small batch just to give it another chance.

I enjoyed the flavors in this, but it seemed kind of boring.  Feels like it needed more ingredients.  I used feta instead of blue cheese and that was nice.

Delicious!! Added 1/2 lb cooked bacon to about 3 lb red potatoes. Increased dressing by 1/4. Only had dried basil but fresh would be better! Don't over cook potatoes so they hold shape. Only dairy is the tasty feta cheese.

I loved it and so did my family. THey asked for it again, just two days after having it! I didn't add as much Balsamic Vin.- I added 3/4 to 1 Tbsp, and rather than adding Blue Cheese, I left that out and added 1/4 c. Miracle Whip, with 1/2tsp Original(unsalted) Mrs.Dash, and because we like our food with a bit of heat, I added 1/8tsp. powdered Cayenne Pepper! I diced up one Stalk of celery You can use 2 if you want) and I added 2 Hard boiled Eggs, cut up finely, and mixed throughout! So good. THanks for posting this recipe though, it gave me something to work with, as I like to be creative.

Great stuff, enjoyed this very much! I reduced the amount Dijon slightly and used feta instead of blue cheese, just for personal taste. It is a nice alternative from the traditional mayo based potato salads. Thanks, It's a New Day!

Really good. Nice break from mayonnaise. I used Feta cheese as I didn’t have blue cheese. It was perfect, will probably make it again soon.

I would make this again with the following changes.  Use white balsamic vinegar so your salad looks like the one in the picture.  Mine turned out to be a very unappetizing brown color since I used regular balsamic as stated in the recipe.  I would also wait to add the fresh basil along with the chives right before serving.  My basil wilted as I added it to the warm potatoes along with the dressing as stated in the recipe.  You will not be disappointed after making these corrections.

Trying my first attempt at carrot dogs- was looking for a healthier summer side when I found this.  Great! Definite keeper!!  Had to use feta ( on hand) and blue is on the shopping list as I will make again! ( and again and again??)

The basil and bleu cheese tasted terrible in my mind before I made it, so I added bacon and substituted scallions for the chives & basil, and ricotta insalata or goat cheese crumbles for the bleu cheese (I've made it more than once). Simple is better; there were far too many flavors going on as written. I used a very grainy Dijon and it was perfect. I serve it warm. Overall, this recipe idea was FANTASTIC! Kudos to the author.

This is a perfect, light summer potato salad. I didn't have Dijon, so I just used an old fashioned seedy mustard I had already (Dijon would be better), I also used rice vinegar because I didn't have white balsamic and I added a ton of fresh dill.

I LOVE this recipe.  I love the flavours... a bit of tang offset by the sweetness of the new potatoes.

I have made this multiple times and I only use new potatoes (so I only make it May/June) and I skip the blue cheese... and I find myself diving into the fridge with a fork to eat this as a snack (which is not like me!).  

This recipe makes all other potato salads feel like "french fries"... in other words yummy but bad for you.  Instead, when you make this it's yummy and good for you!

So yummy and easy.  As others have said, be careful to not overcook the potatoes.

Flavors were nice, but balsamic vinegar turned the potatoes a very unappetizing color.  Won't make this again.

Definitely will make this one again.  Loved the fact it didn't have mayo in it; my guests loved it and asked for the recipe.

This is delicious! I found a smoked blue cheese at Sam's Club which made this wonderful!

I'm not a fan of potato salad, and my husband hates mayo, but this was amazing and mayo-free.  I made it the night before a party we were bringing it to(boiled potatoes for 9 min), and mixed in everything except the chives, (feta) cheese, and walnuts--which I did when I brought it to the party I made it for.  It was a hit!  Will definitely keep this recipe!!

Big hit at my house.  I made a separate portion without blue cheese for our non-blue cheese lover (I know, crazy right?) and he still loved it as much as we did. We are really starting to love the non-mayo potato salads.  Thanks It's A New Day. This is a keeper.

Delicious potato salad! We normally have mayo-based potato salad but were looking for something different and this potato salad hit the spot!

It was a hit! Used feta instead of blue cheese.
