Really enjoyed it!  I served this at a pot-luck and it was a big hit.  All the bright colors made a very nice presentation.  This tasted fresh and tangy and was easy to fix and healthy too. I did increase the amount of oil and lemon juice for the dressing to make plenty for the marinade as well as coating the added lettuce.  This definitely is a keeper.

Good salad but not as tasty as I thought it would be...maybe needed more mango. I think it needed a lot more dressing; I would double dressing for next time

It was really good but not awesome. It is very healthy and tasty. I would make it again but with some changes. I thought it could use a little more mango (maybe two). It didn't seem like there was enough of the sweet in it, where more mango could have helped. I cut back on the chili pepper because I don't like food too spicy. I didn't have cilantro. I used red onion diced instead of green onions.

AWESOME RECIPE! Very versatile and incredibly simple, I used it on top of a salad, but there was so much left over for just us 2 I also used it in fish tacos, also in sandwiches! Loved it! Also brings a lot of color to whatever you use it with.

Will use lime instead of lemon next time and a little more corn and mango. Plus, I will definitely double the dressing.  Looked very pretty, though.

This is one of my favorites, though I usually use lime instead of lemon juice, leave out the lettuce, and use it as a topping for tortilla chips alongside a Mexican main dish.
