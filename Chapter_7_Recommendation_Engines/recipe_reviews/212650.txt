Very flavorful and easy, so much less complicated than traditional Beoff Bourguignon. I subbed coarsely chopped yellow onion for the pearl onions. The sauce is very thin so I served it over wide egg noodles.

Good, not great.  Needs a bit more seasoning and flavor.  I'd recommend including more flavorful aromatics.

We did not like this at all. We didn't have Burgandy so we subbed Merlot which may have been the reason. I found it didn't have very much flavor at all. We added Greek Seasoning to it which helped but still overall we won't make this again.
