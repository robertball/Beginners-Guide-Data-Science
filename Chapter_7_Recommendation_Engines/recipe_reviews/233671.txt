I made this with just roast beef so was mainly interested in at dip.  It's good and I will make again. The only change I would make would be to cut down on the soya sauce. It gave it to much of a tang.

I'm not finished making this yet but YES it is good!  Had some left over smoked brisket from a local source and had to try this!  I don't have the bacon.  The wonderful smells coming from my kitchen is attracting neighbors!  I did use a bit of water to recipe but this is already tasting and smelling great!
I will post a pick but not sure it will do the smells and tastes justice!

This au jus is the tastiest ever. Made with low sodium beef broth, the rest as written, maybe simmered a bit longer, but I couldn't 't get enough of the au jus.

I made this recipe exactly like the directions but I did not add bacon. It turned out really good and my husband ate seconds. My crock pot is broken and thus was a good stove top alternative.
