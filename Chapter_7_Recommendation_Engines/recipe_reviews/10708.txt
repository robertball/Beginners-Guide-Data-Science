My mom makes these all the time they are delicious, At christmas time we dip the ends of them into milk or white chocolate and then shake colored sprinkles on for an added decoration. Excellent recipe!

oh brother... i don't know what happened with me and this recipe, but i will not be making a mess like this again - while i was taking the cookies up from the pan, the cookies kept crumbling.  hence, i got a lot of well-greased cookie crumbs (i'm going to use them as ice cream toppings).  so i decided to put the rest of the mix in cupcake foils and bake them for 8 minutes.  MAN, i was so upset.  even that result came out disappointing - they didn't have firm forms.  :(.

These cookies are so delicate.  It took me until the end of the batch before I got the hang out of how to roll them without breaking.  I had to add extra baking time and let them cool just a little longer.  I made the rolls and put the cookies over inverted custard cups to make little bowls for ice cream.  They are delicious, but a bugger to make.
