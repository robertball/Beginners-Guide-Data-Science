This was a really easy recipe! I was looking for a warm slaw to go with hot corned beef sandwiches and the balsamic vinegar sold me. The only change I made was using fresh onion (1/4 small, chopped) instead of onion powder and one clove garlic, crushed instead of powdered. (I had them laying around, so...!) It was marvelous on the sandwiches - similar to a sauerkraut, but better!

YES! It WAS like an eggroll without the wrapper! So I nuked a few whole cabbage leaves to soften them, then added some chopped boiled shrimp to the cabbage "slaw" and wrapped the mixture in the leaves. Another nuking to heat the whole thing up and it was FABULOUS! Carb-free eggrolls! Whoda think it!

I wanted to like this, but I didn't :( Here at Casa Moi, it means a possible 2 things when someone tastes their food and reaches for the hot sauce. A: They just like hot sauce or B: Something ain't right!. Tonight it was B; husband tasted it, eyeballed it speculatively, hot sauced it, and proceeded to finish his huge serving (not with gusto--but with the grim determination of a man who knows he must eat his vegetables.) So I tasted it, and lacking grim determination, I could not eat mine. The ratio of salt:vegetables is too salty for me, and I guess I don't much enjoy balsamic vinegar either. So I'm giving it a 3, which in my book means: May be fine for some tastes, and cooking times/measurements are not blatantly wrong. Just not our thing I guess! Thank you for the recipe :)

Found this when looking for recipes that fit the diet requirements for the 21 day cleanse that my husband and daughter were doing! It was one of their favs, and we will likely continue to make it long after the "diet" is over! Quick, easy, and very tasty :)

not what i expected. I agree with the egg roll with out the roll. I was expecting much more of a "WOW" factor. I would not make this again but also knowing that we all have different likes. So, keep on sending recipes.

NOTE FROM THE SUBMITTING COOK: When I'm in a hurry but still want a tasty/something-different/fast side dish, I buy the bag of pre-chopped and washed shredded cabbage, along with a bag of matchstick carrots.  I usually don't trust the pre-washed salads but since this is getting heated on the stove I'm more apt to give it a quick rinse then throw it in the skillet.  Not the same as doing it by hand but it's great in a time pinch!

I added a bit of sugar and more balsamic vinegar to give it more of a sweet and sour taste.  I needed the extra vinegar as I had a very large head of cabbage.

This was a nice change from cold cole slaw and I love balsamic vinegar however the measurements seem a bit off. I used about 3 cups of bagged slaw mix and there was clearly not enough slaw for the amount of vinegar. A full bag of slaw mix or about 1/2 the vinegar for 3 cups would have been perfect. Good taste that would have been better with the right mix.

I made this for myself and served it with chicken marinated in artichokes and garlic. The artichoke balanced the tang very nicely. Without the chicken/artichoke, I thought the vinegar in the slaw was too powerful, so go consider reducing the amount used. Admittedly, I wasn't precise with my measurements (I was hungry and I was tossing everything in the skillet ASAP), so I may have used too much vinegar. I used bagged coleslaw and matchstick carrots. I didn't have red cabbage or onion powder. I did add some red onion, which I would do again. This recipe is a great way to get in veggies and is perfect for Cycle 1 of the 17-Day Diet.

Not very tasty.  I didn't think the balsamic flavor meshed very well with the cabbage.

I really loved this recipe, thank you for adding it to the site. :) 
  I did make a few changes. First, I did not cook anything. Secondly, I omitted the cooking spray and the red cabbage. I doubled the cabbage to make up for the red cabbage I didn't add. (Only reason I didn't add the red cabbage was because I didn't have any on hand) I added about a tablespoon of Bertolli EV olive oil (first cold pressed). I used granulated garlic instead of powder. Mixed well with my hands. 
  I do have to add I usually do not like coleslaw but this was very good. Also, this would be a nice added crunch to any wrap sandwich. As far as weight watchers points this is almost pointless. The only thing that has any points value is the olive oil but if you are making this for dinner times 4 people (with no leftovers) you are eating 1/4 tb olive oil. So maybe 1/2 point for the whole serving?
 Thank you again, loved it!

I did not care for this recipe. The amount of balsamic vinegar overwhelms the dish.

The dish was a bit bland, I used a full cabbage head and four carrot made into ribbons using potato peeler, added minced ginger & soy sauce which punched it up very nicely. This made the dish very satisfying and filling.

I wanted a quick coleslaw for an unplanned pulled pork. Tried this instead of a trip to the store, although I only had carrots and red cabbage on hand, but it still did the trick. Visiting family agreed it went really well on the applesauce bbq pork sandwiches I made. It was great for in a pinch and will probably make again even when I plan ahead better.

i made this recipe twice, one using more carrot than cabbage ( it was tastier this way). both times i used garlic paste, real onion, and rice vinegar.also add vinegar sparingly, because it has a very dominant smell. its a simple recipe, nothing fancy,a bit bland (especialy when the cabbage is dominant over the carrot), but very healthy and filling.
