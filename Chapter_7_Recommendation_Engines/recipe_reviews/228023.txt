I made two small substitutions; I used vegetable oil instead of olive oil and chopped pecans instead of walnuts. I had mini chocolate chips on hand, I used those. I did get 12 huge muffins out of one recipe, mine were done baking at 22 minutes (the recipe says 35-40 minutes--make sure you check yours at 20 minutes, then go from there.) Great banana bread base--I loved how this recipe used whole wheat flour. My family thinks it needs more chocolate chips and nuts, next time I'd double both.

I totally goofed with this recipe which I had halved, but still they turned out OK.  They definitely need some butter with them when heated to help with the lack of moisture.  I was going to make these into mini muffins but after I'd put them in the oven for a few minutes I realized that I'd left out the sugar!  Horrors!  So I took them out, scraped them from the liners, added the sugar, and then decided to just make them into regular sized muffins.  Thank you for the idea of this recipe!

I like the healthy basics for this recipe so I tried it. I used coconut oil instead of olive oil, and replaced oatmeal for 1/3 of the flour. I put unsweetened coconut, chocolate chips, and walnuts in them. They turned out FANTASTIC!

Very heavy dry and bland. Maybe try white flour instead of whole wheat and maybe add some butter or milk

I made them but found having no butter they seemed dry, although having put chocolate chips & walnuts in them there wasn't much flavour at all. They were cooked in 20 minutes so be careful, I think that was even too long, I will attempt again with more banana for moisture
