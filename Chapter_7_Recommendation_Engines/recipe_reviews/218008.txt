I made this with a couple changes. I did not add nutmeg, used butter instead of margarine.I also added more sugar since my berries weren't that sweet. I didn't need to, as the crust is also sweet. It came out tasty, but too runny. I will make this again but I will add cornstarch to the dry ingredients to thicken. Very easy to make, since you don't have to make crust !

I like my cobbler a little thicker and not so sweet, so I used 8 cups berries 1/2 C flour, 1/2 C sugar and 1 tsp. cinnamon. I made the topping as directed but if you want to cut calories it is perfectly fine if you halve the topping. This got rave reviews from the family. I mixed up the rest of my berries with the flour and sugar and packed them to freeze 4 cups in a bag so I can make smaller versions of this all winter for just my husband and I.

The first time I made this, my daughter posted on FB that her mom had made "the best blackberry cobbler ever!"  My family loves this!  And I didn't change a thing.  It's SO easy...that's how I first found it.  I was looking for an easy cobbler recipe for company we were having.  Anyone I've served this to has complimented it over and over.  Make this and enjoy!

I've tried this recipe before and did not care for it at all...  Easier cobbler recipe is the one cup version:  1 cup flour, 1 cup sugar, 1 stick butter....  so much easier and so much better.

The blackberries were really runny so I wish I had added corn starch. Also the topping is too sweet with the sweetness in the blackberry mixture. Not my favorite recipe.

Very good recipe.  I did add cornstarch as I used some frozen rasperries with the blackberries.  I had a box of lemon cake mix and used that with very good results.  Husband ate it up!

Substituted pre-made oatmeal cookie mix in place of the yellow cake. Turned out awesome! Left out the nutmeg on accident, still delish!

This was so easy and turned out amazing. I left the nutmeg out, and am having a hard time waiting until after dinner to eat it. My box of cake mix was only 16.5, so it was less crumbly and probably not as pretty as it should have been. The missing corner was a gift to myself. ??

I had numerous fresh mixed berries. They were sweet, so I sprinkled some sugar in them and added a tablespoon of cornstarch.  Turned out amazing! So easy.

This recipe only works if you turn the blackberries into "pie filling" first.  Combine 2 pints blackberries with 3/4 cup sugar and heat over low until sugar is melted, about 5 min.  Will be runny.  Then combine 3 tbsp cornstarch with 3 tbsp water and add to mixture. Bring it to a boil to activate the starch while stirring.  It should thicken up.  Remove it to a bowl to cool down to warm, then stir in about a tsp of lemon zest.  From there you can transfer it to a pan, sprinkle the yellow cake mix over it, cut up a stick of real butter over the yellow cake mix and bake at 350 or 45 min or until golden.  I've done this for years and it comes out right every time.  Hope this helps you!

I made this recipe using peaches instead of berries. I used canned peaches and did not heat them before baking.  I just put them in a bowl and add cinnamon i little sugar to taste and a teaspoon or so of flour.  mix well. Add the cake mix mixture by the teaspoon. and baked.  Came out fantastic. I love this recipe.

Super easy recipe, yet it looks like you spent more time on it!   I substituted margarine for butter, but kept everything else the same.  I will make again for sure however, I will use less sugar as I thought it was too sweet and I prefer a more tart cobbler

I used less sugar, 1 cup instead of 1-1/2 and it was plenty sweet. We liked it very much and would make it again next time blackberries are on sale.

I made this with blueberries and pineapple instead of blackberries. I also made one with gluten free cake mix and one with regular cake mix.  Only thing I would change is the amount of sugar. It definitely need need as much as the recipe called for. I will make it again, with less sugar!

I've made this with apple pie filling and cherry pie filling.  It's very rich, but that's what makes dessert!

I made it with blackberries, red raspberries and blueberries...it was quite tasty but I reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 cups and for me, it was still too sweet.  My guests loved it.  Next time I will reduce the sugar again to 1 cup and I think it will be perfect.  Served with vanilla ice cream.

The only change was using blueberries instead of blackberries. Easy and loads of taste

The berries are not yet in season, so I used frozen blueberries, raspberries and blackberries carefully thawing them on paper towels.  I did not want them mushy, so I carefully put them in the pan.  I added almost 1/3 cup of sugar and a bit more cinnamon.  I kept the topping the same and my husband loved it!!!!  Delicious!!!!

I don't like blackberries because of the seeds so I just swapped out blueberries instead.  I made it in the morning and took it to work with me for a work group luncheon.  It was the right consistency and the topping was good.  This was a quick and easy way to make a really good dessert for a group.

very good just as presented, but could easily lessen sugar if you need to.  I have actually doubled butter, depending who I am making it for.

Some of the pictures of these cobblers show them to be made with blackberries and some with black raspberries.  There IS a difference in the two.
