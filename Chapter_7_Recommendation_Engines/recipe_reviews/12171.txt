I admit to using shortening. I thought I had butter. I didn't. I forgot the sugar too! But it was a great mistake! This crust was so tender. I filled it with a no bake pumpkin pie from this sight. Got all rave reviews. The secret of any crust is not to handle the dough. I use a spatula to gather it together. I dump dough on a lightly floured pastry cloth and using the corners of the cloth and pull it together. I just roll dough out and aside from turning; I haven't handled the dough. The warmth of your hands make crust tough. Practice makes perfect. I make at least 2-3 pies a month!

I used regular salted butter and it turned out great! Used my food processer to combine all ingredients.

This is a nice and simple crust.  I used it to make French Silk Chocolate Pie (link below) and Creamy Pumpkin Pie.  It was enough for a deep dish 9" pie and a regular 9.5" pyrex pie dish!  Make sure you chill before rolling, and if you bake it beforehand prick the bottom and sides with a fork and cover it in two layers of heavy-duty foil for the first 8 or so minutes of baking (then uncover for another 4-6 min.) to prevent it from puffing up (mine still puffed up a little, but not too bad).  It tasted good too!

This is a good starting recipe, but the amount of ice water is not accurate.  Also, to make flaky crust you must not touch the dough with your hands.  I have found that if you keep from touching it and freeze it when done for a day then defrost the next, it is nice and flaky.  The colder you can keep the ingredients the better.  I always put the flour in the fridge before hand with the bowl so everything is nice and cold

Great pie crust! I did have to use a bit more water than the recipe called for in order to form the dough in a ball.  Otherwise great recipe!! Will use again and again.

This recipe finally enabled me to make the flakiest pie crust ever!  I put the butter in the freezer for an hour before starting, and I also put an ice cube in the water.  I sprinkled a teaspoon of vinegar over the flour/butter mixture before adding the water (this supposedly breaks down the gluten in the flour).   It is better to use a pastry cutter than a food processor or mixer - doing it by hand leaves some unmixed pea-sized clumps of butter, which contributes to the flakiness of the pastry.  It was delicious!

This is a simple pie crust that I've made several times and that has always worked well for me.  I've used it for pumpkin pies, apples pies and apple dumplings.
Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Awesome!!!!!! Finally a pie crust without shortening!!!
Man do I HATE shortening! In my opinion it ruins EVERYTHING!!! NO EXCEPTIONS!!! Since I used this recipe for apple, pumpkin and pecan pie I decided to make some variations. 1) for apple pie add 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract and 1 tsp. of cinnamon. 2) for pumpkin pie do the same as the apple pie and then add 1 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice. 3) for pecan pie crust add the same as the apple pie but also add 1/4 cup of finely chopped pecans in the crust. Hope this helps!!! XD One more thing... please go to my profile to view more helpful recipes and revised versions of originals... thanks! XD

This recipe is fabulous!  I have made it three times now and have had beautiful flaky crust each time.  The only reason I am giving this 4 stars is because 3 tablespoons is too much sugar - I only added 1, maybe 2 and it is plenty sweet.  The directions also don't say to place the flour/butter mixture in the fridge for a while before adding the ice water.  Having the flour/butter cold as well as the ice water helps it all clump like the directions say.  Overall an excellent recipe that I will use countless times! Thank you Debra!

I got compliments on this crust!  I would have liked it a little flakier, but that's probably my error, not the recipe!

This crust tastes sweet, almost like cookie dough.  I have never used a mixer to make pie crust before but it worked out well.  I had refridgerated it over night, so i needed to let it sit out for 15 or more minutes before it was warm enought to roll.  I made a lattice top with it and had no problems with burning.

This is an easy to make crust that I use to make  chicken pot pie. I reduce the sugar for this dish, but would keep it just as it is for a fruit pie. It rolls out nice. I do use salted butter and hasn't been an issue, but you might not want to use salted if you are making a fruit pie, but I haven't had any complaints.

I refuse to make pie crusts with shortening or lard due to their bad health consequences. Sadly, pie crusts need that flakiness. This recipe does a fantastic job with the butter instead. It was flaky, with a great flavor and consistency. Definitely recommend!

I never made my own pie crust until today. I just bought the pre-made ones from the store. Today I was making an apple pie but had no pie crust. I did have everything on hand to make crust, so I decided to try this recipe, and WOW! I will never buy another pie crust, it is so easy and so much better homeade, with this recipe. Everyone loved it - it was flaky, tender, and delicious. I was worried that it wouldn't be, but I followed the recipe directions and had no problems in preparation. Everyone I talked to about it always said pie crust was hard, so I was worried. I never really liked crust before today, but now I am a convert! Thanks so much for sharing this super-easy and great recipe!

I read the reviews and knew this was going to be an easy and tasteful pie crust but.....WOW!! There are no words to describe this crust.. I'm in love with it! This makes your ok pies into top quality restaurant pies! Trust me the crust makes that much of a difference!  The flavor is perfectly balanced so it can be very versatile and be used as dessert pies to chicken pot pies to..whatever requires a pie crust. You will not be disappointed at all with this recipe..I followed it as exactly written..

good taste but not super flaky. i would reccomend rolling this out on parchment paper then flipping it over in to the pan and peeling the paper off. overall, very good.

Very simple and easy recipe. Was in the mood for some pumpkin pie today, and the only frozen pie crusts I had on hand were from last Christmas stuck in the back of my freezer. They also smelled like freezer so I decided to make my own pie crust, how hard could it be... right??!
I decided to cut this recipe in half because I only needed a bottom pie crust and ... didn't have 3 c of flour on hand.. PERFECT!
Everything went together smoothly, as for using a half of 1/3 of water... since there is no 1/6th cup I just filled my 1/3 and used about half of the water. Dough rolled nicely and cooked to perfection. I will definitely be keeping this recipe onhand!! It one of those things you find in the back of your mothers cookbook on an index card!! Truly a KEEPER!

Used regular margarine and it worked out wonderfully. Rolled out easy!  Beautiful, seems to hold up well in recipes that have to be in the oven for awhile.

I'm more into crunchy, crispy crusts and this one's a little soft. But everyone I've served it to absolutely loves it!

I usually use crisco to make my crusts but I was out of it, so I used this recipe.  I thought it was too bland.  I should have omitted the sugar and added a little salt.  On the bright side, it was easy to work with and baked well, but I just thought it had very little taste.

Perfect. Buttery and delicious.  Makes any pie from fruit to cream even better.

It is a good simple basic recipe for pie crust. However, I thought that 1 cup of butter was too much. It made the pie crust very greasy and difficult to form. I had to constantly add flour in order to keep it from breaking apart too easily and sticking to everything. I recommend using 1/2 cup of butter instead.

I used this crust when I made apple pie and it is the best pie crust I've ever eaten!  Have you ever eaten a pie but left the crust behind because it was dry or without flavor?  Not this one!  Every bite was eaten.  Thanks so much!

This recipe was ready in no time and easy to knead and roll out after chilling! I used whole wheat flour for a healthier pie crust. It isn't very sweet tasting, even though sugar was added, so it can go to a sweet or savory pie. This is easy, convienient, and I'm never buying pie crust again!

Recipe came together quite well. Easy to roll out. Had a good taste, I could taste the sugar in a way because I made 2 diff. pie crusts the same day. I don't think I would have noticed if I didn't compare. The crust had that snap when cut into but was tender when eaten.

This is the first time I ever made a pie crust, and it was SO easy, and SO good.  Love the sweetness; and it's so much better than store bought.  I used 1/2 the ball of dough for 2 pies, and froze the rest.  Thanks!

This is a great recipe. I've been having trouble with pie crusts since moving to the high desert of Nevada. I had just about given up when I decided to try one more time. This recipe makes plenty of dough so you don't have to roll it out too thin and I was able to put it in the pie plate without any cracking or crumbling. Thank you!!!

I made the recipe as listed minus some water. I did not use a mixer, but the manual blending and cutting of the flour. It is easy to make.....very flaky and buttery in texture. I put it on some chicken pot pies I had made and they turned out excellent. Will use again.

Perfect pie crust! I've gotton many compliments on it. Make sure the water is very, very cold (I chill it in the freezer till ice crystals form, then pick them off). Also, I don't measure the water but add just enough until I can just start to form it into a ball (usually a little more than 1/3 cup).

I've made this crust six times over the past month for apple pie, pecan pie and turkey pot pie and it's always perfect! I use my stand mixer and it literally takes me less than 10 minutes to put it together. Also, I've never covered it while baking and the edges have turned a beautiful color every time. I love this recipe and everyone I've served has complemented me on the crust! We love it!

I can't believe it took me this long to make a real crust. I substituted some locally grow whole wheat to see how that would work. I liked it, though the crust was a bit tougher to roll out.

Great recipe, very easy to roll out!  The only thing I did differently was to add a little more water so the dough would form a ball.  This made making my own pie from scratch a snap...thanks so much for this great recipe!!

Using this recipe, my first ever pie crust was perfect.  I've always been intimidated by the notion of making my own crust, but this one rolled out perfectly with a little flour on the roller and on the board, ON THE FIRST TRY!  :)  This was so easy to work with.  Thanks so much for posting it.  There's no reason for me to buy a frozen pre-made pie crust again!

This was easier to do than the normal pie crust and turned out nice and buttery and flaky. It was easy to roll out. It was great for my pot pies, but next time I would a T add less sugar if using it for a meal, not a sweet pie.

I love this recipe!  It has a very subtle sweetness and I really like that uses butter instead of shortening. It was perfect for my peach cobbler- my guests raved about it!!!

So easy, and perfect for the savory pie I used it for.  I left out the white sugar bc I was making a savory pie but otherwise left it the same.  Very good.  thanks for the recipe!

It was an okay pie crust.  I thought it was too sweet and it definately could of used a pinch of salt.  I've made much better crusts.

I made this recipe several times now, this time I used it to make a buttermilk pie. I find the recipe easy to work with. I added a little bit of cinnamon to the dough, since I love the flavor of Cinnamon! ;)

I've used this recipe several times and people usually rave about the pie, but ALWAYS comment on how flaky and good the crust is. I follow the advice of keeping all the ingredients cold and not handling the dough with my hands. Turns out great every time. I always make enough to freeze. Have made pot pies and pastry bakes in ramekins with this recipe.

This makes a great and flaky pie crust with a good flavor.  I needed to add just a tad bit more water but other than that it was quick and easy and it rolled out smoothly.

I have never rated anything 5 but this was fabulous.  I have never tasted a flakier crust that was so easy to make.  I was pleased to see I had butter at hand to use instead of Crisco or lard.  I had not made a pie in at least 30 years & a new recipe, too.  The crust was superb.  I used it with the Lemon Meringue Pie on this site, luscious also.  It could be beginner's luck but It still gets a 5 star.

This was the first pie I ever made without my mom. It was definitely a great choice. It turned out great! I did not add so much sugar to the filling. I added 3/4c instead of 1 cup and it was still very flavorful!

I was so happy I could finally find a really BASIC recipe that works. I added more ingrediants and sugar because I saw this as more of a guideline version of a PERFECT dough. Very nice.

I made this with both an apple pie and a chicken pot pie.  Did need to use a bit more water than the recipe calls for.  This was easy to work with and had great flavor.  Wasn't too flaky, but that makes no difference to me.  This recipe is my go to crust recipe.

I tried this today and made it in my food processor.  I think if I make it again I would halve the recipe as I don't have a very big processor.  All in all it came out delicious and flaky.  The only thing i changed was I added a bit of salt.

This is an AWESOME crust...I just thought it was a little too sweet. It was my first time making pie crust or a pie for that matter. I made a pecan pie that turned out horribly but the crust was delicious...I just ate all the crust off the edges. I'm gonna make another pecan pie recipe and use this crust with only half the sugar. Thanks Debra!

It was sooo easy and tasty! I used it for a chicken pot pie and worked sooo well. I will be using it for all my pies and everything else that calls for a crust! It not so sweet but just perfect!

I was out of shortening so I decided to try a butter-based crust. Since I was making crust for a meat pie, I skipped the sugar and used salted butter. I also didn't have a rolling pin so I was using a cup, but this crust rolled very well! Unfortunately, it's not as flaky as most shortening crusts, but the taste is much more fragrant and savory. I would like to try this recipe again sometime with herb butter.

This crust disappointed me.  It was too sweet and tasted like a sugar cookie not a pie crust.

The recipe has worked great for me on many occasions. I don't like to make my crust with shortening and this is the best butter based crust I've come across.

This was a hit! My friends recommended that I enter their local pie contest with this crust (and a berry pie filling). It turned out fantastic. This was my first time making pie dough from scratch and I was so impressed with the results.

This was my very first successful pie crust!  It tastes great too!  When I first started to ball the dough up after it seemed well mixed it was little too dry and crumble-ly in places so I sprinkled it with water using my fingers and patted it together gently.  I wrapped the two halves of dough in plastic wrap and smushed it around into a disk shape.  Then stuck them in the fridge for a while until I was ready to roll them out.  I used two sheets of wax paper so it wouldn't stick to my pin.  Turned out awesome and everyone at work loved it!  (I am going to try it some time with two sticks of vegan butter to see if I can make a vegan pie)

I used this recipe to make pumpkin pie.  the crust was delicious and sweet.  I made apricot and nut horns with the other dough.  I rolled it in sugar and a lit bit of flour.  Then I baked for 15 - 18 minutes.  They were excellent.  this is definitely a good all around dough.  It's a keeper.

This is the best recipe ever.  My husband is sooo picky about everything.  Even HE said that this is the best pie crust ever!  I add just a little lemon juice to the cold water.  Make sure you measure exactly to get the best results.  Love it.  Just like Granny use to make.

Good flavor, very easy to make and roll out. Handled well. I think I over processed the dough in my mixer which made it a little tougher than I hoped, but that was my fault. I will use this recipe again.

This didn't work out very well for me.  It had a nice buttery flavor but was very very tough.  You really had to work to cut it with your fork.  I had a hard time mixing in the water too.  Maybe it's my fault, maybe I overworked it.  I'm not that great at making pie crusts.

It was not as flaky as we hoped. What I want on this recipe is a baking time for baking it ahead and using with a pudding pie. We did this and so we were guesstimating...will try this with a fruit pie and maybe it will be perfect.

This is a great recipe,  I used this crust to make chicken pot pie. I used margarine instead of butter, I also used approximately 1 tbs sugar instead of 3 tbs.  my Pie crust was flaky and tasted great, it was so easy.

I loved it, I always had tough pie crust.  I followed the directions not to use my hands for anything. I love the butter in this as I do not tolerate shortening.  I see an apple pie in the near future.

Yummy flavor, but somewhat crumbly - wouldn't recommend for anything outside of a pie tin unless you don't mind a thick or crumbly crust. Other than that, tasty, and bakes well!

PERFECT PIE CRUST!!! I have made pie crusts several times & it has never came out as flakey & delicious as this recipe! I didn't have a pastry cutter or anything, so I actually just used my hands to crumble the butter into the flour mixture. Also, I scaled the sugar to 1T instead of 3T. This crust was so beautiful & flakey! Definitely my go to crust from now on! Thank you!

Easy recipe.  I omitted the sugar and added 1 teaspoon of salt and two tablespoons of vegetable oil.  I rolled out the dough on a sheet of waxed paper to make it easier to transfer the pie crust to the pan.

I'm not a crust person so it takes a lot to please me but this was the best pie crust recipe I have ever tasted. I made this and used it with my quiche, it was excellent together. I will never use another crust recipe again. Thank you so much for sharing it.

Nice recipe!  I have a recipe that always works for me, but I was trying a new pie recipe, so I decided to try a different crust.  I loved it, and so did my husband who was raised on good old-fashioned lard pie crusts! This crust was crisp and flaky and was great with the fruit pie filling I made.  One thing I would do next time is roll it out a bit between waxed paper before I chill it.

I've made this several times and substituted a gluten free flour blend with coconut oil a couple of times. It's still perfect! My husband prefers it to any crust he's had thus far and he's a HUGE fan of pies. Thank you!

No real change was made just used my ninja blender to start it then put it into a bowl to add water to it. Worked so well. I will continue to use this recipe.

This was not only the first pie crust I've ever made, it was the best I've ever tasted. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly despite my inexperience. I made a lattice crust apple pie; can't wait to try other pies.

This was super easy to make and bake. I only had salted butter but I was making chicken pot pie any way so I also only used 3/4's of the sugar that the recipe called for. I also did an egg wash on the top. I had made it in a glass and metal baking dishes and I found that the glass dish crust was much better by a lot. It had a great flaky crisp to the top while having a perfect consistency inside with the chicken pot pie filling I had made. Now I'm not saying the metal baking dish was bad, it was still very tasty just a bit dry. The inside crust was still very mouth pleasing. My kids are super picky when it comes to crust. In fact when I made this my youngest sighed. But I had reassured her it was good and she did seat her whole plate. And that makes this recipe a super keeper in my house. Thx Debra and thx y'all's comments also it really made this an easy choice. :)

This was the first pie crust recipe that I mastered :) I use it for both savory pies too, omitting the sugar, adding a teaspoon of salt, and depending on the kind of pie I'm making, two teaspoons of spice. It's usually Oregano or Rosemary.

love this recipe.  It's my go-to for all crusts, dessert and chicken pot pie.  For the savory pie I just cut the sugar by half!

Using all-purpose Gluten Free flour, this is now my go to recipe.  My adjustments to this recipe is to halve the sugar and use salted butter when I make it for pot pies .  Make sure that the dough stays as chilled as possible throughout the process of making it.  If using AP GF flour,  roll your crusts out on parchment paper, and then place in the freezer for about 5 minutes for the butter to become solid again, then remove from the freezer and flip over onto the pie pan.  Follow the baking instructions as written for the recipe that you will fill the pie shell with.

My oh my I can't even explain to you how great this crust recipe was! The bottom crust was cooked right to PERFECTION! But the edge was burnt a tad. the thing that really got me pondering for a while was why was the crust burnt and I cooked 10 minutes under what I should have. P.S it said to cook for 50 minutes on a different recipe I cooked for 40 and was BURNT. My folks (including my picky son Daphne)and no this isn't a typo ABSOLUTELY will eat it again. well don't choose a different crust but if you like hair on your chest well this is the pie for you.

This is a perfect pie crust every time i make it! I thought the water would not be enough but as you knead it the butter warms up and forms a wonderfully workable dough!

I thought I would try this recipe as im use to making pie crust with shortening instead of butter and oh boy am I glad I have not been doing it this way. First off the amount of water is not correct. Also putting the crust in the fridge for 30 minutes and out of the fridge it came out like a hard baseball.

I did make a couple changes.  I substituted 1/2c shortening for 1/2 c of the butter and I did add about 1/4 tsp salt.  Very flaky crust.

I tried this recipe and failed miserably! I took the butter straight from the fridge and cut it up as instructed. I didn't have a pastry blender so I used my skinny mixer blades which I thought worked well at breaking up the butter. I put the flour/sugar in the fridge before adding the ice water and even added the tsp of vinegar that someone suggested before adding the water. It was really dry and I couldn't get it to roll out. Any suggestions?

Did not like this pie crust. It needs salt and you can skip the sugar. It was tough.  I will go back to the regular shortening pie crust.

My family is really picky about their pastry.  I have rarely been able to make a pie crust that makes everyone happy.  They usually fail.  I made this the other night for chicken pot pie.  My husband, cousin and my children raved about it.  My husband went on telling me I have to use this recipe for everything I make requiring pastry dough.  I think it was a hit.  It has become my 'go-to' pastry recipe.  So easy, and never fails!

I wanted a crust with butter as I do not use shortening or lard anymore. This was incredibly flaky and tasty. The recipe as written is a generous full pie - it was actually too much for a lattice top, but perhaps I can scale down next time. Recommended!! ***UPDATE: Sorry, I guess I am going back to using shortening or lard, as this has disappointed me twice now. It needed WAY more water than called for and it was really tough. Oh well.

So easy and so good! I had to sub some Jiffy Mix for flour as I ran out and it still came out amazingly good!  I'm more of a cook then a baker so measuring things is not really my forte but even with my little miscalculations this crust came out soo wonderfully delicious for my spinach quiche :)

I depend on this recipe now, but the other day I tried to make it from memory (it had been a while) and I used a tsp of salt instead of 3 tbsp of sugar.  It turned out great, but it was for a savoury pie. A happy accident I guess.  This pie crust has not only made my freezer full of deliciousness and my husband very happy, but it has impressed my parents, and I always thought I couldn't bake. Who knew?

This was only my second time making pie crust and this recipe was way better than the first.. and way tasty! I used a whole recipe for one pie.. half on top half on bottom.. and it turned out amazing :) Didn't have my mixer but it worked out beautifully with a pastry blender. I will be making several more to freeze and have on hand.

I used to always make crusts with shortening, but now this is my go to recipe.  This is so easy and delicious, and as long as everything stays super cold (I like to put everything in the freezer for a few minutes before, and then put the dough in for a few minutes after making before moving to the fridge), it's very easy to clean up after.

Great pie crust. This is my go-to recipe. If making a more savory pie (I am fond of meat pies) I'd suggest omitting the sugar.

Just made an apple pie of facemelting goodness! Changed my (& my DH's) life. Made exactly to the recipe, used my little food processor to cut the butter into the flour piecemeal. Thank you for the recipe!

I love this recipe because it takes butter and not shortening or lard (which I never have). It's very easy and really good!

This was the flakiest pie crust I have ever had!! It was relatively simple to make with basic ingredients I already had on hand. It will be my "go-to" crust for pastries from now on! I don't have a stand mixer yet so I mixed this using a pastry blender and a fork. I rated it only 4 stars because I needed much more than 1/3 cup of ice water to get the dough to come together, otherwise a perfect recipe. With the exception of freezing my butter before use (I generally store it in the freezer anyway) and refrigerating the dough in plastic wrap for about an 3 hours before rolling it out (I accidentally fell asleep and forgot), I otherwise prepared it as written.

Works like a charm.  Great recipe.  I made 5 pies with it, 2 dutch apple and 3 gGerman chocolate.  Baked the 3 G.C. pie crusts first, pricked with a fork and covered in tin foil then baked at 350 for 8 minutes.  All were flakey and great.  By the way these were my very first home made pie crusts.  Definately a keeper.

Great pie crust! First time making pie dough, since I never have any shortening on hand. I love how easy it was! Threw everything in a food processor, and like other reviews mentioned, I had to add an extra tablespoon of water to the mix.  End result was flaky and delicious! I used this crust for the bottom crust of my mini apple pies, and used Pillsbury pie crust for the top- definitely a noticeable difference between the two.  I will never use pre-made pie crusts ever again!

I tried this recipe and it turned out great.  I used a food processor to mix all of the ingredients with ease.  I would suggest you also use one if you have one.  For some reason, I needed to add two more tbs cold ice water for it to get to a point that was necessary to make the ball.

this worked out excellent  I made pasties and originally used shortening which was a disaster. Using butter worked fabulous. I put the butter in the freezer for about 20 minutes before putting in with flour. These were great, firm and tasty.

I am finally able to make a delicious pie crust.  This recipe worked well but I didn't have an shortening so I used salted butter.  I finally know how to create course crumb using another user's posted suggestion, which is to mix the butter dough mixture over and ice bowl...it worked perfectly.  Not sure what the vinegar does, but I added it and this crust was great.  I also use a hand mixture to create the coarse crumb - for some reason it doesn't work for me in an electric mixer - I think it's just me.

So many ingredients! The tip on vinegar and egg yolk makes it worthwhile, though. Since I didn't have cake flour, I found out how to convert regular flour into cake flour, too. Then I used the leftover vinegar/egg yolk/water from Baker's Secret Pie Crust on this website instead of plain water. Both Baker's Secret and Mom's turned out great - both were "my best" crusts yet. There's one in the freezer waiting to impress me all over again. And I can't wait to make more. My friend who was a pastry chef for years told me to not let anyone tell me I'm not a pie maker. Then she had another piece of pumpkin pie. I'm thinking it's the technique from Mom's that helped me accomplish them both. I'll be trying both again soon. I can't blame our 6500 feet altitude any more. Thank you to Carolealana and Debra Shapiro for both of these recipes.

This is a great pie crust. I have always had trouble rolling out dough for a crust - it just never works for me. Well, let me tell you - this dough didn't give me any trouble at all. Both of them rolled out great and came out beautifully too. I used them for a pumpkin pie and a chocolate pie...yum. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

It was good but sweet. Best for a dessert and not a quiche or meat dish. I halved for shell only and still had plenty left over.

This was the first pie crust I've ever had come out right! I used it for a chicken pot pie so I left out the sugar. It came out nice and crispy and browned nicely. The texture was nice and flaky and it didn't taste floury. I'll be using this recipe from now on!

I have NEVER made a pie crust before, but this was ssssoooooooooo easy to make.  After cutting in the butter with the paddle beater for my mixer, I changed the beater to the dough beater and continued mixing until it formed a ball.  Like I said...ssssssssssooooo  easy!

I made this crust to make a homemade chicken pot pie and had just enough crust left over to make two individual apple pies!

The crust was GREAT!!!

This pie crust recipe is wonderful! It will definitely be a dependable recipe for me in the future, thanks so much Debra! The amount of dough it yielded was plenty, especially for the pumpkin pie I used it for, since that kind doesn't need to get covered. I did have to use another couple tablespoons of ice water. I might also use a pinch of salt next time for a bit of a pop of flavor.

I am an inexperienced baker, and this pie crust was simple and easy to make. I had to add a lot more water than it called for. It also shrank a little in the oven.

This was delicious! I made this pie crust because I was out of shortening. I used half the dough for a custard pie and the other half into mini chicken pot pies. I was so surprised how yummy it was and the suttle sweetness paired very well with both recipes. I will definitely make this crust again. fyi...I did have to knead this by hand, it would not mix properly in the kitchen-aide AND it was a tough dough to roll out BUT so worth it! : ) Thanks : )

I only made this recipe because I didn't have any Crisco.  I love the taste of the crust despite the mess that it makes.  If you have a mixer it would be wise to use it.  I used a rubber spatula and it took a while to mix it.  I tried to roll the dough out and I found it easier to flour man hands and press it out on wax paper because it can get sticky.  I also beated a edd lightly and added crystal sugar and brushed it lightly on top of the crust after it was in the oven for about 10 minutes.  My apple pie came out great!Although my filling was a little dry. Messy Messy without a mixer but it was great

I used this recipe because I accidentally bought a no bake crust, so I needed a pie crust fast. it was easy and turned out really good, but there was so much crust that I didn't have room for all the pie filling, the recipe could have made 2 crusts... but it was good none the less

This was easy to work with and tasted great! I did add an extra tablespoon of sugar and added extra water. Someone offered to buy the last piece of my peanut butter pie!!
