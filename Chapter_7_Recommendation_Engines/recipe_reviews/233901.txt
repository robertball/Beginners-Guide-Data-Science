Delicious!  A great, simple recipe for basic tuna salad- just wrapped in a tortilla.  I used albacore tuna and added a little black pepper and mustard.  Great lunch!

Great recipe!!! For fun (and because of a lack of some ingredients), I replaced the celery with chopped apple, added 1 tsp. chopped banana peppers, substituted the mayo with thousand island dressing, threw in a tbsp. of raspberry walnut vinaigrette, added a dash of lemon pepper, a quick drizzle of honey, and I sautéed the onions. The base recipe is excellent, though, perfect for a quick meal! My roommate loved it!

It is an easy and yummy recipe! I've made it two times. The first time without the lettuce and the second time with the lettuce. The second time was definitely better. The lettuce gives it that healthy crunch.

Everyone enjoyed this.  I did a Greek variety and added chopped tomatoes, sliced olives and feta cheese, which was a huge hit!  I also fried my tortillas in a few tablespoons of vegetable oil, which adds a lot of flavor.  Easy, quick and inexpensive.

This is just how I make my tuna salad now.  I never put them in tortillas, but it's a great recipe.

Quick, easy, tasty, old-fashioned tuna sandwich spread. This recipe rivals the tuna spread sold by “Subway” (tm).
