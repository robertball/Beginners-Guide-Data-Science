Very good recipe.   Made with jumbo scallops that took much longer to cook than recipe states.   The paste also makes a great seasoning for stirfry veggies to go along side these scallops.  Easy to make, and a nice use of those herbs from your home garden.

Not my favorite...I was inspired to use my herb garden but the herbs overpowered to delicate scallops. I'm a New Englander, so perhaps I'm just used to a simple broiled or grilled scallop.

Not sure if this qualifies as making the recipe since I made a couple changes:  used dried herbs (cutting the amounts in half), left out the lemon peel, and put the coating on catfish rather than scallops.  Anyway, it tasted really excellent and was incredibly easy!

Tried this recipie as is and loved it. Also made it with Macadamia nuts, and thought it was better. Paired it with Coconut rice with Black beans.
