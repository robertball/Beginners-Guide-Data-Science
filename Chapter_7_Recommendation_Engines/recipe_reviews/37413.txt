I didn't have enough time to marinate the seafood, but I broiled the catfish (seasoned with creole seasoning), then simmered the cooked fish with seasoned shrimp in the lemon juice. My husband loved it, and I must say I did too! I thought we'd have leftovers, but it didn't survive past one night.

Awesome!  The spice can vary depending on how hot the jalapenos are & how much sauce you use.  Had to make creole seasoning first - found recipe on this site.  I made the seafood using shrimp & cod & served it on french bread.  The only thing I couldn't reproduce was the creole mustard.  I don't know what it is & couldn't find a consistent recipe on-line.  I ended up using hot dijon mustard & would have added brown mustard too if I had any.  Also used fresh red pepper instead of roasted & left out green onions since I didn't have any on hand.
