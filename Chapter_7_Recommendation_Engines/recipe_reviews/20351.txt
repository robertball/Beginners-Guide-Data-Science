I would have given this recipe 4 stars as is, but it was 5 stars once we tweaked it a bit.

The ratios were a bit off for our tastes. There is too much peanut butter for the amount of other ingredients, so...either add less PB or more of everything else. We just added more of the other ingredients to taste. Extra vinegar and brown sugar (which we used in place of white sugar) was the perfect touch here, as it helps take the place of hoisin sauce. 

My husband used to cook in a high-end restaurant and was skeptical about a hoisin-free peanut sauce, but was very surprised with how good this turned out with our modifications. A few sesame seeds and some green onion on top and it was perfect. (We had it with chicken satay.)

So fast and easy to make. A bit bland, but perks up in an instant: Skip the Hot Pepper sauce and add Hot Chili Oil (more authentic taste), a teaspoon of Seasame (or Peanut) oil, and add a bit more garlic. I've made this a few times, and prefer crunchy peanut butter over smooth for the base.

I found this a little bland as written, - but VERY easy.  I changed it a little and added 3/4 tsp Tabasco, 1 tsp minced garlic, 2 tsp Sesame Chili Hot Oil, 2 Tbls rice wine vinegar and 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, and I found it absolutely outstanding!  Killer, in fact.  I just put everything in the blender and it became smooth and creamy in an instant!

I am a Chinese and do lots of Chinese cooking at home. This recipe reminds me how my mom makes her peanut sauce. The only difference is she also puts a little vinegar. So I followed the recipe plus a teaspoon of vinegar and poured the sauce over stir fried fish. It tasted like my mom's cooking!

I am in the Philippines and had some of the locally made peanut butter at home, as well as the dregs of a container of chunky store-bought peanut butter.  I used both to come up with my 1/2 cup, and heated up the water to get the rest of the peanut butter out of the container.  Since the peanut butter I have is pretty sweet I skipped the sugar.  I didn't have hot sauce, so I substituted 1/2-1 tsp. of cayanne pepper instead.  I am a fan of garlic, so I used two cloves and added 1 tsp. powdered ginger and 1 1/2 Tbls. lemon juice.  It was all very easy to put together and the previous reviews made it simple to personalize.  The only thing that would have made it any better is if the seal hadn't given out on the food processor attachment to my blender!  My hard-to-please Filipino hosts loved it.

Good stuff! Goes great with pork satay. I used coconut milk instead of water. I also added a little apple cider vinegar, a sprinkle of curry powder and the juice of half a lime.  This makes the taste a little more complex than just PB and soy sauce.

Um, I don't have kids, but my girlfriend likes it!  :)
Remember to mince up that garlic really well if you like a smooth sauce.  
I used natural peanut butter.  No hydrodgenated oil, yummy!
(Hydrodgenated oil is not natural and it is very bad for you!)

This is a great recipe. I also added minced ginger and substituted 3 Tbs Chili Pepper Sauce for the Hot Sauce (Chili Pepper Sauce is full of flavor, but not fiery)

It appears that many others have beat me to rating this recipe, but nevertheless, I have to agree with most, it's the easiest and, simply put, it's just plain good!  I was struggling to find a quick Thai peanut sauce, and Joan came right to the rescue.  Many thanks Joan!!!!

Thanks Joan for this great recipe.  I made this to go with some rice noodles.   I bought a box of pad thai from Costco and the little sauce packet that comes with it tastes horrible!!  I was desperately searching for something to replace it with and came across this recipe.  I did have to add a little more water to get the consistency I wanted and skipped on the hot sauce in case my daughter wanted some.  Next time I may crush some peanuts to sprinkle on top.  Really, really good.  Thanks again.

Delicious. :D It tasted like really good quality dry-roasted peanuts, which are one of my fav snacks anyhow. I added quite a bit more water to get a thinner consistancy, upped the tabasco to taste, and used 'Just Peanuts' all natural peanut butter. I had it on ramen with red bell pepper, chicken, green onion and crushed peanuts. Thanks.

I made this sauce because I ran out of the store brand I usually use. It turned out pretty good. I used brown sugar instead of white and a little bit less peanut better. The sauce tasted better the next day. You need to give it time for the flavours to mix.

Really good.  Tastes nearly authentic.  I used a TSP of brown sugar instead of white sugar, 2 tsp of pre-minced garlic, and added a 1/4 tsp of ground ginger to perk of the flavor.  My husband and three year old both called it yummy.

This is a really good base recipe but I made a few changes that made this much more flavourful. Chicken stock instead of water, 1 and 1/2 times the soy sauce and garlic, and add a tablespoon of white vinegar.

I added 1/4 tsp ginger and halved the water for a thicker sauce. I served it to my kids with sticky rice made into balls which they dipped into the sauce. They loved it! Definitely a kids' favourite.

I have made this a few times. It is wonderful. Sometimes I add teriyaki sauce instead of soy. Or brown sugar instead of white, a dash of sesame seed oil a time or two. I usually double the recipe because my family loves it so much. Today I added a few tablespoons of vanilla full cream yogurt and some pineapple juice. It went great with my stir fried noodles and my pork sate kabobs.This is a keeper

I chose this recipe because I didn't want to make a sauce with both PB and coconut milk. Easy, simple and good but I felt it was missing something. Vinegar, maybe?

I made this as a dipping sauce to go with chicken satays and this tasted great and was so easy to put together! Picky husband even really enjoyed it. I added just a little extra hot sauce to give it a some extra kick. I'll definitely be using this again. Thanks!

Very nice.  Excellent consistency and flavor.  I omitted the hot sauce and used fresh garlic.  Added 5-6 fresh diced basil leaves.  Gourmet without question.  Cooked seasoned chicken on top of stove in olive oil, removed it, stirred in sauce, added bite sized chicken and simmered for about 5 min.

At the very last minute, I was looking for something to jazz up some chicken and broccoli.  This was wonderful, and don't be afraid to modify!  I used less PB, brown sugar instead of white, a smidgen of balsamic vinegar, a little powdered ginger and some crushed red pepper flakes.  Next time I would add more garlic, maybe some lime juice.  Fun to play with.  I would think you could make a batch ahead and stick it in the frig for next time.  We served ours over thin spaghetti.  Really good.

This is hands down the WORST peanut sauce I've ever had. And I've had a TON. Thank goodness I tasted it beforehand or it would have ruined my whole meal.Followed the recipie to the letter and it tasted like a mix of sweet peanut butter and cornstarch. Big waste of ingredients in my opinon

I tweaked the recipe just a little & it was awesome! Peanut butter-soy sauce-brown sugar-vanilla yogurt (made it tangy!)-Thai sweet chili sauce-a little water....yum! Added to noodles-grilled chicken & veggies.

This is a nice base to start with but the peanut butter is really over powering to the other ingredients.  So I would suggest maybe adding more of the other ingredients to suite your personal taste. I did not add the hot pepper sauce because I wasn’t going for a spicy peanut sauce.  It is really personal preference, but this is a simple sauce you can cater to your family’s taste buds.

You could add some additional things to this sauce, but I made exactly per the recipe with only one exception - I used red pepper flakes (1/2 tsp.) instead of pepper sauce and it was fantastic with chicken satay.  The whole family loved it.

I like this recipe because it provides a great jumping off point.  You can add a little of this and a little of that to suit your tastebuds.  Me, I like ginger and coconut milk.  Have fun with it.

This was good and easy.  I added fresh minced ginger and rice vinegar to meet my taste.  I'd make it again.

This sauce is simple to make with full flavor.  I just pour it over a breast of chicken and bake.  Serve with rice and veggies and it is a quick, tasty, easy meal.

I've tried lots of peanut sauce recipes, and this one beats them all!  I took a few suggestions from the other reviews and it turned out great!- I used 1 tbsp. less of soy sauce, added curry powder, garlic powder instead of fresh garlic, and used natural crunchy peanut butter instead of the regular kind (so I can say it's healthier!).  Also added some peanut oil - for a less runny version, use less water or a bit more peanut butter.

Maybe it was my brand of peanut butter, but I didn't
care for this recipe. It was too salty and thick.

I made some Thai inspired chicken and used this for dipping sauce.  It was really good.  I can find all kinds of dishes to use this for, just make sure you blend it really well.  If you don't want it chunky, use creamy peanut butter instead.

I used the basic premise of this recipe and went from there. I actually found a spicy peanut butter which had great spices. My husband loves this stuff.

Quick, easy, and tastes great!  I boiled top romen noodles (did not add the seasoning that comes with), drained the noodles, and then added this sauce.  Yum!

I followed other reviewers' advice and added more ingredients to spice it up (lots more garlic and hot pepper sauce), but unfortunately my entire family still found this way too bland.  Even my younger daughter, who normally doesn't particularly like spicy food, found the need to add a lot of salt.  I might try this again, but will probably add some chopped/minced chile peppers or crushed red pepper or something.

I have only tried this recipe- it has the easiest ingredients!  I have made this twice- both times adding a splash of rice vinegar and this time adding crushed ginger.  It ALWAYS fakes me out- mixed in the bowl it looks horrible and then- Wa-la it turns into a great peanut sauce!  Very filling- I always eat about 1/2 of the portion I served myself! Very yummy

This was my first attempt at peanut sauce, and it was great with the addition (a must imo) of about 1 or so tsp. of finely minced ginger.  Delicious and versatile, easy to tweak to your specs for spicy heat.  I will use this as my basic recipe.  Thanks!

This was not very good at all.  Just tasted like peanut butter.  I tried doctoring it up with more soy and hot sauce but it was no good - I ended up throwing the whole batch out.

Tasty, VERY easy recipe! Husband loved it! I didn't have crunchy pntbtr on hand so I chopped some roasted pnts and threw them in. Added a tiny splash of vinegar like another reviewer. Also added toasted sesame seeds (approx 1t) and sesame oil - about 1/2t. Next time I'll try it with some finely chopped green pepper and carrots sprinkled on top. Served it on noodles w/shrimp... very tasty!

Used for a fondue dipping sauce.  Nice taste, could use to be a bit thicker.  Recommend adding cornstarch.
Second time: made again for Chicken Satay and it complemented it nicely.  Didn't have a problem with the thickness this time, not sure why, maybe because I added the water little by little this time?  Added a few dashes of crushed red pepper flakes, otherwise made as is.  Has a little bit of a funny taste by itself, but complemented the satay nicely.

I followed the recipe except that I used 1/4 cup of water.  I like my sauce on the thick side and if I used 1/2 cup it might have been to watery for me.  What a great quick and simple recipe.  As far as too much soy sauce I added a tiny bit more because I couldn't taste any.  Yummy!!!

This sauce was OK. It was very easy to make and was a nice change from the regular store brought peanut sauce. I did think that the recipe should call for a bit more hot pepper sauce, but other wise...very tasty.

"Quick 'n' dirty" -- without making a mess.
As a student who cooks for myself, my own version of this is one of my staples for flavoring chicken.  If you want an easy peanut sauce, it doesn't get easier than this.
As a note, I prefer not to add water but instead to add the paste to my skillet when cooking strips cut from chicken breasts.

I wish I'd read the reviews first...simple sauce but too much peanut butter with a lack of balance of the other ingredients.  I tweaked it as I went, but didn't read about the vinegar until afterward.  I added vinegar to the remaining sauce and it made a Huge difference.  I'll make again but with modifications.

I would really give this recipe 4-1/2 stars.  An excellent and easy sauce to make.  As per other reviewers opinions, it was a little bland as is, but just by adding a splash of vinegar and a few drops of sesame oil this recipe went from a zero to a hero!

Good. I tweaked it some. Skipped the soy, And hot pepper sauce. added hot chili oil, a tad more garlic and about half a can of coconut milk...smooth and creamy. Good base but need tweaking... Also added some toasted sesame seeds.

This was alright and it fit the bill for what I needed, but it really needed a lot more flavor and some heat. I started with the hot pepper sauce and tripled it, but then added some cayenne as well because it was rather bland without it. Even with all the water added, it still was pretty thick and you need to add more if you want it to drizzle rather than glop when topping foods with it. A decent base to start with, but not the best. Thanks, this worked out for my meal.

This recipe was a good base but kind of bland without additions.  I added about half a teaspoon each of ground ginger, cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes and it turned out great!  The ginger gave it a little extra flavor and the cayenne gave it a hint of spice!

This was great! I used creamy peanut butter, and instead of plain water, used the boiling pasta water to thin the sauce. It could have been a little thinner, but that was my fault not the recipe. I added a few extra dashes of "Rooster sauce" because mama likes it SPICY! Really great flavor, can't wait to use this on grilled chicken this summer!

I had to microwave it for about 30 seconds, and then let it sit for a few minutes so it had time to thicken. Great flavor.

This is so good on stir fry! Particularly good with Tofu Peanut Stir Fry.  I didn't make enough the first time. The quality of the soy sauce matters tremendously: I buy the organic kind and follow the label suggestion to keep it refrigerated and it is so much better tasting than unrefrigerated mass market soy sauce.  Check the asian section of the supermarket, or the health food store.

I have to give this recipe only 3 stars because while it was very tasty and easy to make, it was WAY too salty.  Either cut the amount of soy sauce in half, or use the full amount but buy reduced sodium.  Otherwise, the sauce was very tasty!  I also used coconut milk instead of water to thin it.

I have made this many times according exact instructions!  The last time, we mixed it with a hand mixer.. Turned out the best yet! 
If you like it a bit more spicy add some more hot sauce! 
Great Sauce!!!

This was good, but it seemed to taste a little "too" peanutty, so I added a couple of dashes red pepper flakes and some ground ginger, and that really made the taste incredible.  My only gripe is that the sauce gets really thick as it cools, but the taste is there!  :)

Very good. And simple! I didn't have any hot sauce so I used chilli powder like someone suggested and used powdered garlic instead of a clove. Turned out great. At first I thought 1/2 cup of water wasn't enough because I saw the sauce being kinda of thick so I added some more water but then  regretted it..sauce taste better thick. But I don't mind at all, this sauce was so easy to make, I can make it again in 2 minutes!

This was ok but mostly tasted like straight peanut butter. I added quite a bit of hot sauce and red pepper flakes to give it more flavour.

Joan, thank you very much for this simple and tasteful recipe. I just found out that I have gout and peanuts and peanut products are one of the safest ways for me to get the protein I need. I remember having an African dish once very long ago which was made with peanut butter and then another time where I had an Asian dish made with the same. I thought I was going to be slaving over a stove and lots of pots and pans for hours when I decided that I wanted to make a peanut sauce for some pasta. Not only was this sauce simple to make, only took 5 min and tasted great I also only used one bowl. Thank you again.

This was okay.  It suited the purpose.  I should have used brand name peanut butter.  Next time I think I will put more red pepper flakes.  I served over thin spaghetti.

This is very easy, but tastes too much like peanut butter. I would probably make it again, but add more soy sauce and less of the peanut butter.

I love this peanut sauce.  It's so easy.  I've used it many times as a sauce with fondue.  It's awesome if you fondue a piece of chicken, a piece of onion, and a piece of brocolli, then dip it in this sauce.  I have also made stir fry with chicken and various veggies including broccoli, then stirred this in as the sauce at the end.  My husband and I love it.  Then we eat it with rice and top it with chopped peanuts.  Yum!

This recipe is MUCH better if you substitute teriyaki sauce for the soy sauce, and also add fresh ginger to taste. I also omitted the sugar.  Try it!

This was pretty good.  I replaced the hot pepper sauce with chili oil and used fish sauce in place of the soy. It was nice and fiery and perfect with chicken satay.

Not the best, but not bad, either.  
I added some sesame oil and a couple more drops of hot sauce, and it was much better!

The recipe is a bit bland, but turned out great with added vinegar, sesame oil and extra hot sauce. Also garnished with sesame seeds and some green onions!

This is a great recipe for starting your own unique sauce.
As many reviews have already mentioned, this recipe requires a little fine tuning which is where YOU get to make it YOUR SAUCE!
First I made the recipe as written and then I made several adjustments to get the flavor and consistency I wanted.
It's been a long time since I've been inspired to try something new, feels good!

A big plus for this recipe since it’s incredibly easy, and simple to modify to your own taste. I doubled the  soy sauce, sugar and garlic, then added red pepper flakes.  If I had read the reviews first, I probably would have added vinegar, burn it turned out great with my modifications (even better than my favorite premade peanut sauce). Sautéed soba noodles with broccoli and tofu, topped with crushed peanuts, green onions and cilantro  to make a quick and yummy dinner

I subbed honey and garlic powder because I had them on hand, and I added a shake of ground ginger. It was awesome. Totally made my crockpot rice and chicken edible, and reminded me of my favorite Thai place's satay sauce. It got a thumbs up from three kids and one very picky husband. I will be making this all the time.

Easy and quick recipe! I added some crushed fresh ginger and  sesame oil to the recipe. Made a veggie stir fry with this sauce and added coconut milk. OMG. Tasted like my favourite Thai dish from a local restaurant.

i'm not sure what changes I would make to it at this point. It is a really good sauce but it's the first one that I have made at home. I would make it again, definitely.

This was ok but had no heat. I did like the ease of the recipe though and will make it again. Next time I will use schezwan sauce instead of hot sauce.

It's a really great base.  It does need tweaking to make it great.

   I added minced ginger, sesame seeds and used hot pepper flakes and honey instead of sugar or pepper sauce. I also used a splash of cooking wine. 

   A drop of sesame or peanut  oil wouldn't be amiss , nor would a splash of coconut milk and a squish of lime juice. If I had these in my kitchen I would added those.

Loved it with less soy sauce and the addition of a little vinegar, sesame seeds and green onions.  I used brown sugar instead of white.  Half the amount of PB and water made the perfect consistency.  I'll make it often.  Thank you for the review!!

Wow! This turned out great. I added vinegar and red pepper flakes instead of the hot sauce, and cooked the sauce so that the sugar (brown instead of white) and vinegar could kind of mix with the seasonings before I threw the peanut butter in. Towards the end I also grated some carrot pieces so that they could wilt but not cook - this turned out great! It was 5 stars at the end, but as it's written it wasn't quite there.  Will definitely make again, with my tweaks to the recipe :)

I think this is a great recipe. I tried it with almond butter instead, still really tasty. I just do a lil less soy sauce and garlic cause i think its over powering, but maybe its cause I'm using almond instead of peanut. I love adding this on top of pasta!!

This recipe is pretty good, but just like TraciA, I tweaked it as well. I went ahead and added the hoisin sauce, because it just wasn't the same without it. I added about a 1/4 cup.

Easy peasy-used warm water to blend easier, skipped the sugar, used some soy sauce packets leftover, garlic powder because I'm impatient and lazy, and sriracha. Purrfect!
Thanks for the great EASY recipe!

It was good, but I have a lot of plans for this that I think will make it better. I'd like to double everything except for the peanut butter and water, sub honey for the sugar, sub chili garlic sauce for the hot sauce, and add a tablespoon of rice vinegar and a teaspoon of sesame oil.

I tweaked it in a variety of ways, thanks to several of the comments, and it was _wonderful_. I used a fresh-ground peanut butter, good soy sauce from an Asian grocery (Gold Mountain?), extra garlic, 1 1/2 t. powdered ginseng, unsweetened coconut milk instead of the water, brown sugar instead of white, 2 T. rice wine, and 3 t. sesame chili oil instead of the hot pepper sauce. 

I also increased the recipe to 6 servings, and served it over lo mein noodles (rinsed in cold water til cool), mixed in with 2 medium carrots (bias-sliced pretty thin), 2 big stalks celery (similarly sliced), and 1/4 of a sweet white onion (sliced _very_ thin from root to end). This made 5-6 general servings. Serve cool ... and it's even better the next day, when the flavors have married.

Easy peasy and lots cheaper than buying it by the bottle. I added more heat with a tablespoon of tabasco sauce (I'm someone who enjoys habanero salsa).

Great base (and probably perfect for those with mild tastes)! Like others I added some things, particularly sambal paste which is super spicy. Also skipped the sugar - no need!

First off the good stuff I love that it doesn't have coconut milk and second the ingredients are always on hand and super quick.  However I found it rather bland and a little to runny.  So I adjusted it to a 1/3 cup peanut butter and 1/4 cup water and totally bumped up everything else to our tastes.  I appreciate the base recipe though and to be honest reminds me a lot of what you get in Bali but needs some more spice for Thailand.

It took a lot of tweaking to get it this where I wanted it. This is a good base to start with, but horrible by itself. I ended up adding fish sauce, garlic powder, ground ginger root, rice vinegar, WAY more sugar, green curry paste, and sesame oil. I can't tell you exact measurements because I just dumped it in there a little at a time. Oh! I almost forgot, if you cook it on low in a sauce pan it makes a HUGE difference in flavor. In the end it turned out full of flavor and just awesome. :)

Way too peanut buttery. Easy to make but i didnt like it with my salad rolls.  Sure not like my fav Thai places sauce! I tried to improve it by adding sesame oil and hoisin but it didn't help much. I will be passing on this recipe in the future.

This was quite good and we made it just as written. When I first tasted it I thought the soy sauce was too much but with the noodles it was just right. Would make a good stir fry and next time I will cook the veggies, then add noodles and then the sauce. I think adding some ginger and more garlic would really give it more definition. Thanks.

This sauce wasn't the best I've ever tried. I made another homemade sauce awhile back that was better but don't remember what recipe I used. In a pinch this recipe worked but I probably won't be making it again.

I just could not make this.  The flavor was off, the consistency was thick no matter how much I thinned it, and it just had a funny taste.  I used all quality brands, and even took some other's advice, but it just didn't work for me.

What a great recipe!  Like others, I added a little more brown sugar and some white vinegar.  This is great over pasta or as a dipping sauce. I'm so glad that I've found such an easy, fast recipe with ingredients that I always have around. It's a relief to make a sauce that finally tastes like what I get in restaurants.  No more yucky jarred grocery store sauces!

Tasted great.  I served it with Tofu Peanut Stir Fry from this website and it made a delicious dinner.  Just took advice of previous posts and added extra garlic and hot pepper sauce, as well as red pepper flakes.

I thought this had too much soy sauce! Next time I make it I will use 1T soy sauce, 1T rice vinegar, 1t fresh ground ginger, 1/2 c peanut butter (maybe I'll use smooth and garnish with peanuts), 1t brown sugar, 1 clove garlic, 1t sriracha sauce (instead of hot sauce), and maybe coconut milk instead of the water to thin it out. This was my first time making peanut sauce, so thank you for a starter recipe I can adapt to suit my taste!!  :)

Really good! It was to liquidy at first so i put it on the stove and added a bit of cornstarch to thicken it. Like other people I also added a bit of hot chili oil, pepper flakes, and extra sugar til I got the taste i liked.

Wow! This was awesome! I used it as the peanut sauce in the Thai Pizza! I think it improved the taste when i baked it though, the garlic seems a little strong! Great!

Pretty bland.. i just couldn't season it to my liking. i suggest using hot water though; it makes the concoction easier to mix.

It's okay, but is missing the hoisin sauce, to make it more like the resturants.

Very good. Didn't have Tobasco, so I added chili powder and a little ginger, onion, and garlic powder for more flavor. Put it on whole wheat pasta, which was way to heavy.

Ive never really been exposed to "peanut" sauces. So, I was curious and tried this one on a chicken satay. It was pretty good but I dont think Ill make it often. The other flavors in the sauce are very subtle and it's almost like eating straight pb. Don't get me wrong, it was not bad but I can't say it's something I'll make again.

This sauce was so simple to prepare.  I used reduced-fat creamy peanut butter, since that was all I had.  I served with Chicken Satay from this site.

Great flavor however I found that I needed to make quite a few batches of the sauce before my chicken and pasta had enough mixed in with it.  Luckily it's very easy and quick to make.  I also added a little more tabasco sauce to give it a little more spice.

Like everyone else, I made some major subs 'n adds and it turned out fabulous!  I combined almost all:  cut back a little on the H20 and did one tbsp each of soyvay, fish sauce and sesame oil.  Two cloves of garlic.  1/2 chili pepper.  A little curry and powdered ginger (didn't have fresh handy!) Omitted the sugar.  Added 1/4 cup shredded fresh basil.  Tiny bit of Salt (I like things salty).  It was Fantastic!!  Thin, so I ended up adding extra PB (which I used fresh ground peanuts, not just a jarred PB, makes a huge difference)only because I wanted it as a baster/dipping sauce, not marinade or saucy for noodles.  YUM

Good.  I used it in Oriental Beef Lettuce Wraps (this site) with hoisin sauce.  My husband thought it was lacking flavor but I liked it.  Not a very complex flavor, but good. The nice thing is that I always have the ingredients for this sauce on hand.  Plan on more hot sauce if you like heat.

Wow! This was so easy and tasty! I added a few extra drops of tabasco sauce and omitted the garlic, just used a shake of garlic salt.  I am really impressed at the simplicity of this recipe! It tastes remarkably similar to the neighborhood Thai place ~ yummy!!!!
