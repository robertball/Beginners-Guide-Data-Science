Make sure not to over mix meat mixture. Was a little to sweet for my taste reminds me a little of meatloaf. But ok for something different. Pretty good if you're looking for something a little sweeter. A slice of bacon would be good on it to offset the sweetness.

I don't want to give these burgers a bad rating but my family didn't care much for these. I thought they were very easy to make and were very moist which is great. I was really looking forward to eating these as was my family. However it was decided that they tasted an awful lot like meatloaf (something my husband is not fond of). I won't be making these again because of this reason. If you like meatloaf....you will enjoy these burgers a lot.

Made this for my Dad and my boyfriend. They both loved it! I altered the recipe a bit since I didn't have everything it calls for. I used: 2 lbs ground beef 1/2 Cup Bbq sauce Aprx 1/4 diced onion 1 Envelope Lipton dry onion soup mix Dash of garlic salt. Little bit of bread crumbs to thicken Next time I'll probably use a little less onion and a little bit of brown sugar. Overall great recipe! Thank you for sharing!
