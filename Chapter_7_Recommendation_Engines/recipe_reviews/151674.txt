I just made this tonight, and dinner guests went back for thirds!  I added my own twist to the recipe by making a spice rub for the chops.  Perfect.

This was very flavorful, although I did adapt the recipe a little.  I dredged the chops in flour, seasoned salt, garlic powder, rosemary and thyme before browning.  I didn't have any cream of celery soup in the house so I used cream of chicken and added celery seed to change the chicken flavor.  It turned out great and the gravy was delicious.

I'm not very good with pork, but this was an unexpected success. I did not have cream of celery, so I used low-fat/sodium chicken broth and added celery salt it. I used fresh ground salt, pepper and rosemary on the porck shops. next time I might try to use less soup and thicken it with cornstarch to make it more gravy like and add a few more veggies at the very end so they stay crunchy. maybe aso add some parsely. All in all, this was great, thank you!

I was really excited about this recipe as it was really simple, unfortunately is was also a bit on the bland side.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception that I seasoned the pork, but it was still very bland.

I may try it again and add some garlic and maybe let the port set in a garlic marinade overnight first.

This is very similar to a recipe I've been using for years.  The only difference is instead of water, I add about 1/2 cup of wine (red or white, whatever you have on hand) and some parsley.  I've also cooked it in the slow cooker and then served over rice... the pork just falls apart - Yummy!

This meal was really homey. The only thing is the pork chop could probably marinade in a dry rub for a few hours to make it even better.
