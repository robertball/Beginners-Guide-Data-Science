This dressing is FANTASTIC!! This is exactly what I expect a French dressing to be; smooth, creamy and ORANGE, slightly sweet, slightly tangy, and just a tiny bit spicy. For years I have searched for a recipe for true French dressing that I could make fresh at home, and finding this one makes me so happy.  I have made this recipe both with homemade mayo and with Hellmman’s and find them equally good (Hellmman’s also makes a good bottled French dressing; It is also a creamy orange dressing with no tomatoes or catsup, as are most of the other major brands of French).

This is awful. It tastes like mayonaise and I let it chill  for 24 hours. The smell was horrible. I do not recommend this one.

Taste more like thousand island to me, but still tasty.  I added some garlic pepper, lemon juice, and garlic salt to add a little more flavor to it.  Overall, not a bad recipe at all.  It would depend on individual taste with this one.

This is pretty bland, extremely thick, and tastes a bit too sweet for me.  It does NOT work well to make this with fat free mayo, for sure.  I'm giving it 3 stars as a possible foundation for a dressing recipe, but as is, the recipe just does not make a very good dressing.

This was great.  I did add two tablespoons of ketchup and extra milk so that I could pour it on salad.  It was a hit.  My children were even using it as a dip for carrots and celery.

A superb match for my lunch salad of mixed greens, garlic pepper turkey breast, grape tomatoes, red bell pepper and feta cheese.  Simple and delicious.

Great recipe.  I made a smaller amount and eyeballed the proportions, but I was very happy with the result.  Only changes I made were adding just a bit of ketchup, and using simple syrup instead of granulated sugar.  Also used less milk than called for because the simple syrup thinned it a bit.

I made it as written. Easy, good consistency.  I'd prefer more flavor.

The mayo flavor was too strong that it made it bland.

However, I added one more tablespoon of vinegar, and some lemon juice and it was perfect. I later added grated garlic and parmesan cheese, and it was tasty! I've been eating salad a lot more now.
