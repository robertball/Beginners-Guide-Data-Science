I used the recipe as is first, and it was fine but I wanted more veg into it, so I added the carrots and a few other veg (onion, green pepper, celery) and also some parley. I used fresh, halved button mushrooms tossed around the salmon cakes before covering with the soup. Since I'm doing the Weight Watchers thing, it bulked up each salmon cake so the portions were lower points, which means I could eat more! LOL But it's a great basic recipe and not fried!

I made this because we love salmon, even salmon patties from a can.  I thought this would be a different recipe to try out since I had some left over white rice from the night before.  I followed the recipe exactly (except for already having a cup of cooked rice on hand), with carrots, and wild caught canned salmon.  The end product is pretty bland and tastes just like canned salmon.  If you don't like the taste of canned salmon, you probably won't like the end product as written.  We like fresh wild salmon or even farmed salmon that has been doctored up.  But this needs some serious seasoning to help out the falvor.  If I were to make this again I would add a little more onion and some old bay seasoning to see if that would help.  Our one year old did love it, she ate an entire ball herself.

Based on the previous review, I added some seasoning (Worcestershire sauce, dill, a little cayenne, and some parsley for color) to the recipe and I was pleased with the result.  I did use the optional carrots.  The sauce is very pale looking and I think a few drops of Kitchen Bouquet or the like would give it a better appearance.  It's a comfort kind of food, and I would make it again.

This is an awesome recipe, a definitely refreshing break away from salmon filets and fried ho-hum salmon cakes and rice.  I made this for my wife and kids and it was a definite smash hit!!!  I so loved it that I could no longer let it go without having a picture for all to see.  Try this recipe, if you're tired of those Ho-Hum Salmon cakes. . . This is a Definite Blue Ribbon Winner!!!

Really tasty! I used leftover baked salmon and leftover rice from the night before. It's a GREAT way to use up leftover salmon. Used the carrots. Will add more seasoning next time though, it was a bit bland. Didn't use the "sauce", it didn't appeal to me. I think it would be better with some kind of creamy dill sauce.

Pretty good recipe. I decided to skip the sauce; made smaller balls; rolled them in cornflake crumbs and baked them. Also used brown rice instead and some finely chopped fresh tomato. Good fish recipe.

Like some of the others, I added a bit more seasoning: a dash of dried dill weed, a dash of dried parsley flakes, a dash of Worcestershire sauce and a dash of ground mustard; used seasoned salt (can substitute with some celery salt).  Additionally, I sauteed the onion and some celery in butter to soften before adding to the mix. To make the sauce less "anemic" in appearance, you can substitute with Golden Mushroom Soup or add Kitchen Bouquet to the original - Cream of Celery also works; additionally: can add further seasonings if desired (and even some chicken "granules").  I used the "pre-cooked" single servings of Uncle Ben's brown rice which is microwaveable and simplifies things.  I have to say that with the additions, it turned out great!.....a nice change from the usual salmon croquettes or patties because of the rice rather than breadcrumbs or potato flakes.

After making this the first time, we decided it could use alittle boost. To the salmon mixture, I added Worcester sauce, minced garlic and more onions. To the sauce I added lemon juice. It added a bit of twang. I will certainly make it again.

Made this tonight with leftover baked white spring.+ the rice that went with it.  Added a dash  of worstershershire,  a generous dash of shiracha, generous pinch of parsley plus the suggested ingredients.  Amazed, frankly, how well it held together.  Balls kept their shape.  Texture was pleasant.  Filling but light.  Will definitely make this again.  Thank you for sharing:)
