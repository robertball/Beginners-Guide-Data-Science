This is a pretty good pie but I think one I'll have to play with a little to get it to the point where I say "WOW".   The one mistake I made with this recipe is that I used 8oz of sour cream instead of 16oz--I was a little confused because pint is typically a term used for liquid measure.  I think I'm going to definitely try spreading Cool Whip on top of the cake as one reviewer mentioned.  Also I think I want to try making my own graham cracker crust.

Very easy and very tasty.  Spread CoolWhip on top after pie is chilled.

My husband's mother used to make this when he was young and he was thrilled that I found a recipe and it was delicious. Every time I make the pie, it doesn't last very long.

I followed the instructions exactly as written, and this pie turned out wonderfully. It is so delicious that my family and I had 2 - 3 slices each. It is a great summer pie since it is chilled. VERY easy to make. The recipe title is completely accurate. Excellent recipe, thank you!

Easy, yes; yummy, no. It wasn't too our liking.  Sounds like the other reviewers liked it, though.

After reading the recipe I knew I was going to make this with a few changes. I made my own graham cracker crust, made simply with graham crackers and butter, both doubled as the pan I like to use is bigger than a regular premade crust. I also used 24 oz of sour cream, doubled the sugar and 3 cans of fruit cocktail. I put whip cream on top too. I had to take the pan away from my husband before he ate the entire thing! Thank you so much for the recipe!!!

Really was easy! My family loved it. I topped with cool whip per other reviewersâ€™ recommendations.
