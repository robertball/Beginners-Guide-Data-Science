OK So I forgot to take pictures.. But this was absolutely amazing.  The only thing I did different was try to cut out some of the fat.. ie I used 1% milk and sugar free cool whip, and low fat wafers.. Like I said in my profile I try to cut out as much as I can.  But Let me tell you this were absolutely AMAZING.  and very, very easy to make.  Much better than traditional banana pudding and yummy, yummy For those of you who think it is to creamy one of two things happened. 1)  You did not whip the cream cheese enough. 2) You did not whip the cream cheese enough.  Remedy.... If you find it to creamy try adding a bit more vanilla pudding it will balance out the cream cheese.  Do not give up on this try it again... It is worth it!!

Delicious!  However, next time I will mix the pudding and milk together before adding to the cream cheese so it will mix better and to avoid little cream cheese lumps.

I only used about 6 oz. of Cream Cheese.  And I used frozen mixed berries because that is what I could afford.  This was a wonderful dessert.  The cheesecake pudding gets a very mousse like quality that is very good, I actually liked the frozen berries in it, they were basically thawed while the dessert sat in the fridge waiting to be served.  The cookies held up well amongst the fruit and pudding.  Very easy, and very wonderful.

I agree, way too much cream cheese!  It made the dessert very rich - I used a combo of blueberries, strawberries and pineapple, but the cream cheese overpowered the flavor of the fruit.

Much too cheesy. You might as well eat a stick of cream cheese while stuffing berries in your mouth. I do not recommend this.

This is a really good parfait if you use fresh rasberries, strawberries, and blueberries in it! My daughter loved these at her birthday party- especially when I topped it with granola! A zero hesitaded five stars!

it was pretty good we added ice cream on the top but if you decide to put ice cream on it make sure you dont add milk because it will make the ice cream 2 loose but overall a very good recipe

My husband and I really enjoyed this desert . . . it tastes light and refreshing. I soaked the strawberries and blueberries in a little sugar for a few hours. I also made my own whip cream! It was easy to make and perfect for anyone who loves fruity deserts (my husband! - I prefer chocolate myself)

this was a really easy receipe and perfect for an outdoor dinner.  I marinated the berries in Frangelico and a bit of sugar for a few hours which gave it a richer flavor.  I also used the cheescake flavored jello pudding instead of plain vanilla.  Loved it!

I loved this recipe! I am making it again for Easter dessert. Several guests took copies of the recipe home with them. My husband was mad I didn't double the recipe! Delicious!  Make whatever subs you want, recipe is great as it is.

I really liked it! It was very creamy and refreshing. The wafers made an ok touch. I thought it was a little rich but other than that I really loved it.

I don't have parfait cups so I had to put this in a glass bowl, still tasted very good. I really like it, simple enough for me and my daughter to make together. I thought since she likes cream cheese, pudding, milk, strawberries, and blueberries this was sure to get devoured, but even with helping me make it she wouldn't even take a bite!! Oh well more for me.

I've made this 3 or 4 times now and it is always a hit. I double the recipe using 2 of the larger boxes of vanilla pudding (5 oz each, I think) and a lot more Nilla wafers than called for. I've tried mixing different fruits and I think the blueberry/raspberry combo is the best.

Add toasted almonds on top for extra-special touch!  Followed the recipe,excepting that I added 1/3 c. crushed graham crackers in with the vanilla wafers.  Used fresh raspberries and strawberries, and layered the entire batch in a trifle bowl.

For ease of preparation,  I give this 5 stars.  For flavor, I  give it a solid 4 stars.  I thought the filling tasted more like pudding and less like cheesecake and I was hoping for the opposite.   Overall  though,  it was a good,  easy dessert for a weeknight meal.   Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I di dnot like these at all, nor did most of my guests.  Served them as small parfaits at a brunch.  They look pretty but don't taste that great.  Tastes very much like it all came from a box.  Kids might like this.

I did not make this dessert, but only used the recipe for the creme to put in crepes.  OMG this was fabulous!  The ONLY change I did was used white choc pudding instead of vanilla.  I used my own whipping creme too.  This creme could be used for anything and I used it to fill crepes with strawberries.  AWESOME!

This recipe was a hit for me! After reading a couple of reviews about it being too cheesy, I took the advice of using 6 oz. of cream cheese.  I also took the advice of mixing the pudding and milk together before adding to the cream cheese.  I wasn’t sure about the coarsely chopped Nilla wafers, but breaking them by hand seemed to work okay.  Everyone like it!

These weren't as good as I thought they'd be.  I'd been eyeing them for a couple of months in my Kraft foods magazine.  I thought it would be sweeter.  I made some up for Easter, others said they liked them but I was not a fan.  Just not as sweet as I thought they'd be.

I took this to a potluck and I came home with an empty dish! Everyone loved it. I used the low fat versions of the ingrediants and no one could tell a difference. I also only used 1/3 of the cream cheese packet. It was delicious!

Very Delicious! I felt like it was a bit thick & heavy though, so we added a bit more cool whip & milk to the pudding. It tasted much better than. :) Delicious!
