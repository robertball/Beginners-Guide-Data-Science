This recipe was delicious!  Because I'm a vegetarian I replaced the lamb with a mixture of potatoes, peas, and carrots.  I also used apple juice instead of lemon juice.

This recipe is GREAT. Even though I don't typically choose to eat lamb, I liked this.  I would also recommend trying it with other ground meats.  Perfect blend of spices, and given that it's a somewhat lengthy process the end result is worth the time.  Also - we had to add a lot of extra water to get the dough to be able to be kneading, probably more than twice as much water as is called for in the recipe.  This is kid friendly when it comes to making the samosas - but not the frying parts of course.

Perfect Blend of spices!Great Recipe, but the dough is not right. I had to add a lot more water than called for. Otherwise, finished product is fabolous.

I was hoping to get the taste of the samosas that I had some years ago, but using this recipe didn't do it.  Unless you use an awful lot of garam masala, the cost of this multi-spice isn't worth it.

It does take a bit of work, and my stuffing wasn't quite as good as I hoped. But the dough recipe was perfect! I think I would use larger circles of dough next time I make this.

I was having my doubts about the dough mid way through making it. I ended up using more water to get the dough more "elastic" - I was reaching almost a full cup but then I just stopped and dealt with it as is, for fear up messing up the entire recipe. The meat (beef not lamb) cooked fine. Smelled even better. But when I had to add it to 4" "half circles" I laughed. No way that can be done is such a small tiny bit of space (not without taking an hour to assemble them/using all the dough called for). So I started making bigger circles, but half way through THAT I noticed that the "completed" ones sitting out waiting to be fried were oozing some liquid. They were not by any means full or stuffed. But the oiliness from the beef makings made the seals open. I tried to fix them but I made it worse. Next time someone might take the time to follow their own recipe and make sure the instructions are well written and yield good results.  *I'm now going to try and find a recipe to use for that left over samosa beef*

Good recipe.  I was not sure whether the recipe called for 1/4c water or 1/4 + up to 1/4, but I did the dough in the food processor and used over 1/2 cup.  I only had enough dough for 16 samosas because the circles were too small to cut in half, so I made them in the shape of pierogies.  I threw some finely diced potatoes in th the meat which was a nive touch.

These did not turn out well at all! When I placed them in the oil they fell apart. Also, the filling was too pungent and overpowered by the ginger root. I would suggest ginger powder.

These were wonderful! Make sure to roll the dough realllly thinly otherwise it puffs up to much when you cook it in the oil. Definitely making these again!

This is a delicious recipe! Instead of using ground lamb, I used a small can of peas and carrots as well as one and a half boiled and chopped russet potatoes. I left out the green Chile,s,, used mustard powder instead of turmeric, and cut the salt in half.
My only issue was that the recipe made more filling than dough, so I would double that next time.	But I'll definitely make this again!

You know, this was good, but not great. I did change a couple of things-- ground beef instead of lamb (don't like lamb) and I used pie crusts instead of making my own wrappers. I baked these like empanadas instead of frying them, but I don't think the outer shell was the problem. The filling just seemed like it lacked something. We ate it, but I don't know if I will make it again. Maybe it needs tomatoes.

Very easy to make and straight forward. The dough recipe lends it's self to many types of filling. I made mine with a sausage filling and they went fast.

I gave four stars because for me, the filling is the best part-- I didn't care for the dough.  I used puff pastry dough instead of the recipe dough and baked it. I like to pretend this is healthier than frying it.  I have made these as the recipe calls for, and also vegetarian with cubed potatoes, peas, and carrots. I also needed to half the lemon juice for the vegetarian version.

The only change I made was ground chicken instead of the ground lamb. That aside, these were amazing. I go to a local farmers market and have tried all the samosas for sale and these ones are comparable. In fact they are better than half of the vendor's ones. Fabulous! If you are having trouble with the dough you can use wonton wrappers for mini samosas or egg roll wrappers for larger ones, however they are not very authentic.

Excellent filling! So tasty! This was the first time I've made my own samosas, and they were impressive. However, the water for the dough needs to be adjusted. I used about 1 cup and it was still not enough. Next time I'll use about another 60ml extra.

Loved them!  I also had to add double the water.  The meat filling was AMAZING!  Made according to the recipe.  The shaping of them was pretty bad.  They looked nothing like the picture.  But that is my fault.  Need to work on it.

Really awful dough recipe.  Giving credit for the filling, although I didn't try it, and made my own.  The dough recipe in any samosa is the most important component, as the fillings vary widely.  Before posting recipe, author should test!

My family devoured these as Panini's. I rolled the dough into round circles, filled and pressed the circles together, brushed them with my coconut butter blend, seasoned with a light amount of garlic salt and pressed in the Panini maker for about four minutes

I've had many samosas & sambusas, but the first time making it. I strayed away from the full recipe but it was a great guide!
