This was delicious! The pomegranate molasses added another dimension to an otherwise traditional BBQ sauce! I added more fresh ground black pepper as a preference and used agave nectar instead of honey, and EVOO instead of sunflower oil.

Inspired combination.  It's now a house favourite.  This sauce is 'ace' on pork chops or pork tenderloin, roasted in the oven.  As Axel Steenberg warns, this sauce can burn after 30-45 minutes so watch closely.  I'm a great fan of pomegranate molasses.  I picked it up 'on spec' at the neighbourhood Middle Eastern grocery.

Made this for pulled pork I had left over. This is delicious! The pomegranate molasses gives it a sweet tart kick that is delightful.

I'll cut back on the honey next time but it was delicious!  I used EVOO instead of Sunflower Seed Oil because seriously, who stocks that?  We dipped kettle chips in it and yum......

This is quite delicious and super quick to throw together. Itâ€™s tangy and not too sweet. Thanks for the recipe.

I used regular molasses and canola oil for this, only because that's what was around. LOVE it! We're an incredibly busy family (who isn't?) and it saves time to prep ahead. I've made this in a larger batch and stored it in the kitchen for a week. We've used it on roasts, burgers, & chicken. The roast went in the slow cooker with this. For the burgers, I had made sliders and left a little out as one of the sauce choices. For the chicken, we had breaded cutlets and I drizzled some over them. It's been a versatile sauce. Good stuff, thanks for posting it!
