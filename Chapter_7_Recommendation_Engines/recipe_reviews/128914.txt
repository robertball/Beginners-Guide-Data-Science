Very delicious! I did use tad less mustard and added tad more mayo just because we like creamier i guess.  It is a keeper in my recipe box.   Hint for those struggling on peeling eggs.  Once they are done, put in cold water for about 2 minutes, then crack each egg softly, one crack each side or each end, and let soak in cold water for an hour, when you go to peel, it practically falls off for you.

My husband loves deviled eggs and this recipe was a nice departure from my usual "go to" recipe.  I used a little less dijon and a little more mayo.  I also had some smoked paprika on hand so I used that to dust them with - I never decorate them with olives so I left them off.  My grandmother sometimes used olives, but when she did she always used the green ones stuffed with pimento.

Thought these were great - added just a couple of items:  finely minced green onion - just a bit and a little dried mustard....... a little extra mayo too but that's just a personal preference...

Delish! I actually switched the dijon mustard for regular yellow mustard to really bring that tang. I also used Frank's Red Hot to spice these little guys up (rather than say Tabasco)and the zip was perfect. Thanks.. we all loved them :)

I followed the recipe exactly and had to add more Mayo than called for, about 2x's more.  Especially like the Dijon mustard and hot sauce addition.   Flavor was great.  Will make again.

I surprised my husband by making these tonight. Oh my goodness...they were so good! I halved the recipe and only made 6 eggs worth...my husband and I ate them all within 5 minutes. This is a keeper for sure. The only thing I did different was add just a little more of the mayo, and omitted the olives. Great recipe, will use again and again!

I thought my husband loved deviled eggs until I made these for him. He was astonished! The only problem is, I have to start making them more often now!

Followed ingredients exactly except I did not dust the eggs with paprika.  I boiled my eggs for 3 minutes and then covered them!  After 10 minutes I drained the hot water and covered with cool and then shelled them. I used a small cookie scoop to fill each egg white. For the bodies of the spiders:  I halved the drained olives and then patted them dry with a paper towel.  For the spider legs, I just cut slices.  The red eyes are made out of Betty Crocker Cookie Icing but I DO NOT RECOMMEND doing this because within 30 minutes the icing slides right off :( :(  The taste of the egg is excellent.  Will make again and will continue trying to figure out a way to make eyes.

I really liked this flavor combo. I don't like olives so I put a bite of dill pickle on top. I like my deviled eggs with crunch so next time I'll add some pickle to the mixture. Thanks!

This was fantastic!  I left off the olives and added minced onion for a bit of crunch.  Tried another top-rated deviled eggs recipe on the site that was disappointing, and made this recipe after the other flopped, just in time for our get-together.  It didn't disappoint, lots of flavour!

These were pretty good! Just a nice basic deviled eggs recipe, nothing too exotic, so it appealed to pretty much all the taste buds in our family.  I used some Hot Smoked Paprika, as I found the eggs not to be very spicy at all so I could get away with it! Thanks, karlyz!

Yes, WAY too salty!  I had to add more pepper and Tabasco sauce to try to even it out.  They still weren't that great.

these were very good, and my family gobbled them up in half an hour (there are only four of them, so that was fast).  I did add a little more mayonnaise, used yellow mustard which was on hand, and added a little chopped dill pickles and worcestershire sauce, and it was great. these made my first attempt at devilled eggs a smashing success :)

This is the best recipe I have found for deviled eggs.  People have requested them quite a few times from me and they are a huge hit at my Church. Thanks for a great recipe!

These were great!  I love all kinds of deviled eggs, so I suppose I'm easy to please, but I thought the touch of hot sauce in these added a nice, subtle kick.  I'd make them again for sure.

Great recipe. I stuck with Dijon, because (at least the brand I have) it doesn't have synthetic color or preservatives added. There's also a more horseradish-y taste to it, I think. I also added LOTS more Tobasco sauce, but next time I might just try a couple drops of habanero sauce instead... tasted too acidic to me.

The hot sauce in it to give it an extra kick was good, but the filling was way to dry.  I added and added extra mayo to make it creamier.  Just didn't do it for me.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe. I had to leave out the olives, which I love due to hubby not caring for olives. I usually just add horseradish to mine to give it a kick but I tried it with the Worcestershire sauce and hot sauce and really enjoyed it.

These were amazing.  I had a (pregnancy strength, lol) craving for deviled eggs, but I needed them to be spicy and zippy.  My husband was excited and proud that he could make them himself, and we both loved these pretty much as is (we might have used a little more mustard, a little less mayo).  I would not only make these again, but I would recommend the recipe to others as well.  Well done!

Ok, I am from New Orleans, so I just Had to spice it up a bit and make it my own. I eliminated the black olive, added a little extra mustard, cayenne pepper, and some Garlic Tabasco and topped it off with cooked Hot Jimmy Dean Sausage.  Don't get me wrong, I love olives, I am a food chemist and test olive oil to make sure its the real deal for a living (not adulterated with a lesser quality oil).  But still, the 24 halved eggs didn't last 3 minutes in an office of 4....  It took a little longer to prepare, but it was worth it.   Next time I will know to double the recipe as the JD sausage was the longest part.  Thank you for the start!!!!!

They were a hit. I found the Dijon a little strong for m liking but the guests ate them up.

Omitted Worcestershire sauce and olives.
Replaced hot pepper sauce with a 1-2 scotch bonnet peppers.
Replaced Dijon mustard with ground mustard. Added a little dill seed (grounded before use) and cayenne pepper.

Thanks for sharing! Your recipe led me to a recipe well suited for me.

Great recipe! Was assigned deviled eggs for a party and so I read many recipes before choosing this one. Since hubby does not like olives I topped with some chives from the garden. Used a little less hot sauce and added a dash of curry plus a little more mayo. 

Did not want spicy just a bit more punch than usual and this worked a treat!

These came out great! I added a BIT more Crystal hot sauce than recommended, but we like it hot! Also added on a few, just a little dill for garnish. Great, and thank you for the recipe.

I think this dish has a lot of potential, and I'm sure I'll will be make it again. Before attempting this again, I'll have to figure out what seasonings to use, by reading all of the review, and see that will work for others, and than for me, to make it more flavorful or lot better for me to do! Anyway, excellent to do a SCRATCH on recipes.  I've will added this to my recipe book with my additions.I did not add the salt, the olives are salty enough for this.  THANK YOU!!

The eggs needed to be lowered with a spoon into rapidly boiling water one at a time allowing an extra 4 minutes boiling time for locations having high elevation. This recipe was anemic. It needed a splash of lemon/lime juice/onion juice or white vinegar and/or lemon peel/pepper. It needed onion salt/powder. It can use one half teaspoonful of celery seed!

I made these and they were a big hit! I used Tiger Sauce for the hot sauce which is a little sweet and hot, and added finely chopped bread and butter pickles.  The tart of the Mayo and Dijon mustard (Bookbinders Stone Ground Dijon) and the sweet of the pickles and Tiger Sauce (and the heat) made these a real hit.  Same as others have written I added about twice the mayo as in the original recipe. They came out creamy, sweet, tangy and delicious.  This is definitely a keeper recipe that you can adjust to make it your own.

These were OK, but VERY salty!  I should've went with my gut and used less Dijon, as I think that may have been the culprit.  I may try these again with a few adjustments.

Really good.  Following others advice I bumped up the dijon and mayo in equal quantities until I got the consistency I desired.  Topped with smoked paprika.  A big hit. My wife used a spoon to clean out all the egg topping from my mixing bowl.

Used only 6 eggs, so halved all the ingredients. Ended up using 1 Tbls mustard and 3 Tbls light mayo. The rest of recipe I kept the same. They ended up ok, but not really spicy at all. The 1/4 tsp of hot sauce and Worcestershire were inadequate to add taste. Next time I would go with 1 tsp hot sauce, and half a teaspoon of Worcestershire per 6 eggs.

Okay these were amazing!!!! I did add on one ingredient that I just cannot live without when it comes to deviled eggs, and that is pickle juice! Just pour a little splash of that into your deviled mix and your good to go, also I use Hungarian smoked paprika instead of the regular standby paprika for the finishing touch, but make sure you go easy on it because a little goes a long way! And I also omitted the olives......

Great recipe, just needs more mayo for it to be creamy: keep adding until you get the consistency you want & omit the salt, there's plenty from the worchestshire and hot sauce , I used cholula hot sauce to taste.

To get the extra spice I like I use the same recipe but substitute blackened cajun seasoning for the paprika. Same color and texture but adds heat. And I'm telling you I could not eat a half dozen eggs in any other way. That good...
