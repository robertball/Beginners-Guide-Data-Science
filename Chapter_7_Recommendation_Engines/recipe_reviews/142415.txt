Wow, this is great if you have fresh corn. I did not nuke this recipe, since I hated nuked food. I sauteed the jalapeno and red onion in 3 T. butter until softened. Then added the corn and cooked about 5 minutes til tender. I then seasoned it with fresh ground white pepper and kosher salt to taste. Did not have pimento or red pepper. Did not miss it. Wonderful side with Mexican food.

I loved this recipe. After reading the other reviews I decided to use red bell pepper instead of pimento.  I also sauted the onion, pepper, and jalepeno in a tbsp of butter before adding frozen corn.  Our family loved it.  It was alot like the mexicorn you can buy canned.

So simple, but very tasty.  Did not have the pimento, but used red onion for a little color.

Corn is a favorite at our house (probably because it's so sweet) and my daughters did eat this up, but to me the overwhelming flavor of the finished dish was butter - even with the jalapenos and pimentos.  I normally adjust my expectations based on the ingredient listing, but I really didn't think 2T of butter would have such an impact on the end result!

great summer side dish, simple and great for picnics. i did make it in the microwave but next time I'd make it even better but frying up the onions and making it all on the stovetop.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good!  I didn't have any jalapeno peppers on hand, so I used half of a 4 oz can of diced green chile peppers (drained) and no pimentos.  It was just enough heat for us.  Delicious!!!

Such an easy way to jazz up a side dish of corn! I used canned corn, pickled jalapeno slices, and subbed some diced pepper for the pimentos. Delicious!

Fantastic corn dish - we loved it!  I didn't have corn on the cob, but did have frozen corn.  I just eye-balled the amounts of ingredients that I used. I mixed it all up in a skillet and cooked on the stovetop rather than the microwave.  I used the last of the garden jalapeños in this recipe along with the last orange bell pepper in place of the pimento.  This was packed with flavor and the jalapeños added a wonderful zip.  Most certainly will be gracing our table again.

My friends and family love this!  I made a few changes.  First, I grill the corn prior to cutting it off the cob.  Also, I substitute a red pepper for the pimento.

I also did not use the microwave but sauteed everything instead.  I subbed chopped red bell pepper for the pimento and sauteed that in butter with the onion, then added the jalapenos.  When those were crisp tender I added the corn and continued cooking until just heated through.  Nice way to dress up corn!  Two jalapenos was a bit spicy, so next time I might scale it back to one.  But this was still delicious!

Holy smokes, this was ultra-simple, and yet one of the tastiest side dishes I've ever made. My step-son said it was the best corn he's ever had.

For those who thought 2T of butter was too much, try 1T butter/1T x'v olive oil.  And, a can of black beans thrown in with a finely diced homegrown tomato is even mo better!

I haven't made this recipe but it is so similar to one that I make that I am giving it 5 stars.  With the hot peppers, I also add finely diced sweet red pepper and zucchini.  I also add chopped parsley and chives and saute in a mixture of butter and olive oil.  Yummy!  One of my favourites.

simple and quick!  I really wanted to make this dish just cold, but chose to warm it up to let the ingredients meld together and do this according to the recipe.  Boy am I glad, this was nice and tasty and super quick.  I did use the bell pepper instead of pimentos as I did not have them on hand.

Whoa this was spicy!! My jalapenos must have been super spicy. I sauteed half an onion in butter with some minced garlic, I added a can of drained corn and the fresh jalapenos that I left the seeds in. I didn't have the pimento peppers, don't really care for them. Great side dish, will make often!!

I enjoyed this side dish paired with a simple oven fried fish.  I did not love the pimento flavor, although I did love the color.  The next time I will use finely diced roasted red peppers.

So quick and easy and delicious. I prepared it in a skillet, I used fresh corn that I cut off of the cob.  I sauteed the peppers and onion in butter until tender and then I stirred in the corn and sauteed for another 5-6 minutes.  I reheated in the microwave the next day and it was still perfect. Great texture and flavor.

I used red pepper in place of pimento pepper as that is what I had on hand.  Did saute the jalapeno's, onions and red pepper in cast iron skillet.  Really easy and very tasty!  It's nice to kick up vegetable dishes.  Will def make again.  Thanks for a great combo!!

I made this with all the original ingredients. The only change was that I made it on the stove top instead of the microwave. This dish has alot of potential, it was just lacking something in the flavor department. I thought it would have some kick from the jalapenos but it didn't. I will make it again, but will saute the jalapenos and onions and add cayenne pepper to taste.

This was great! The idea of microwaving it all didn't appeal to me. I did microwave the corn and added it to the onion and jalapeno that I sauteed in butter. Besides salt and pepper, I spiced it up by adding a little garlic and onion powder, cumin and chili powder. I made a scaled down version and will keep this in mind for a nice side-dish. I liked it because it wasn't a creamy or heavy dish. Very light and refreshing. Maybe a little lime juice would be good, too. Nice recipe!

I made it on the stove top too, and it quickly became a family favorite. Highly recommend! I did leave out the pimientos,  but I found that it was fine without it.

Easy recipe but it is much better sautéed than cooked in the microwave. I make this on a regular basis in the summer when the jalapeños in my garden are growing like crazy.

There is nothing like fresh corn in the summertime!  So, so yummy! This recipe was a nice change from regular corn on the cob, but, not as heavy as a creamed corn.  I didn't use quite as much butter as the recipe called for and left out the pimento because my husband doesn't care for it.  Great side dish for my Sunday night supper.

Great recipe and flavor!  I too sauteed red onion, jalapeno, and red bell pepper in butter--then added fresh corn.  It is a wonderfully spicy side dish.  Thanks for sharing!

Just made this and it really jazzed up ordinary frozen corn. I was surprised and will so  make this for Thanksgiving.

This was a spectacular addition to our Thanksgiving dinner - the spicy jalapenos were a great contrast to the heavier traditional favourites.
I used jalapenos in a jar, and probably put in more than 2 peppers' worth - it was delicious!  I love recipes you can easily adjust to your own tastes and this certainly fits into that category.  Thanks so much :)

A great tasting side dish. I prefer spicier food, so I think next time I'll use two jalapenos. Real quick and easy, thanks.
