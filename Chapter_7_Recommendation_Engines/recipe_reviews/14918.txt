Thank you for offering this recipe.  My family sampled the dip as originally described and mixed this evening, and then offered suggestions, in the process leaving most of the dip for me to eat.  The consensus is  that crab meat has a subtle flavor.  Cocktail sauce, hot sauce, and horseradish sauce easily overwhelm the crab.  The result is a spicy, needlessly expensive, cocktail sauce-flavored, cream cheese dip.  Celery could have substituted for the crab.  Personally, I would never think to spread cocktail sauce over crab meat.  I won't again.  I plan to revisit the crab dip concept starting with crab meat and cream cheese and then add subtle flavoring.  If I find a workable result, I'll post it.

I have made this several times and everyone always asks me for the recipe.  I go a little easy on the horseradish and sometimes sprinkle some crab meat on top as well.

This was a, must have, at my sisters baby shower.  Everyone loved it and asked me to bring it to another gathering.  No left overs, you know it is good when that happens.  Only thing I added was LOTS of crab meat to the cream cheese mix and then some on top of the sauce.    Definate Must Have!!

This recipe was a huge hit - my guests were scraping the dish for the last bites.  

I added a bit more horseradish and a less cocktail sauce - but I will make it according to the recipe next time.  It is a recipe that can't be messed up.

I took this to a party and it vanished in a matter of moments!  Everyone was raving about how good it was.  It would be very fast and easy to make using the canned crab meat, but I shelled my own which took quite a while!

Absolutely love it!  I made this for a Christmas party several years ago and lost the recipe.  I was so happy to find it again.  I substituted freshly chopped shrimp and and added extra. I'm a shrimp fanatic.  It was gone in no time.

I reduced hot sauce to 1/2 tsp., used 2 green onions, no horseradish, about 8 oz. of cocktail sauce instead of 12, which was plenty.  Then I read the reviews!  I agree with one reviewer, you don't get much crabmeat taste with this.  It's mostly just cream cheese and cocktail sauce.  I won't make it again.

This turned out sloppier than anticipated and the taste was a little bland. Next time, I would add more hot pepper sauce to kick it up and less cocktail sauce so that it's not quite so runny.

This was very good and people loved it. I used less cocktail sauce because of previous reviews suggestions. It was great cold and not hard which I see from a lot of other dips. Perfect with crackers.

I liked this recipe but will use a little less cocktail sauce in the future. An entire jar is a bit much.

Used 8 oz crab meat, went lite on onion and heavy on horseradish.  Served with various crackers.  Extended family of 30+ loved it at Christmas get-to-gather.

Thanks for a great base recipe. I have made this a couple of times and had no leftovers. Not being a fan of hot pepper sauce I omitted it and the cocktail sauce as it didn't sound that good. For more flavor and body I added celery (finely diced one time but second time used celery salt, either way works), diced egg, garlic, paprika, and dry mustard. First time used cream cheese but was out 2nd time so I used sour cream instead and it still came out great. My better half likes a little kick so I added a little Cajun seasoning. He loved it. Next time I will try adding the cocktail sauce as other reviewers said it was good.

When my husband asked for crab dip I looked at a couple recipies that called for imatation crab meat so I tried it in this recipe and it was great.  (Use 1 cup finely chopped in place of the can) I will definalty make again.  I may only use 1 tbl of horseradish though.  Thanks for a winner.

A friend of mine makes this recipe for every get together and it's always a big hit, so I made it for my boyfriends work xmas party and it was gone in less than an hour. I doubled the recipe and they wanted more! However, I did make one change,I only added 1 1/2tbsp total of the horseradish because I'm not a big fan of it. Awesome recipe! I will make again and again.

I had to bring a cold appetizer to a family function so I mosdified this one a bit. I didn't add the coctail sauce on the top. I did make the dip as recipe stated and added 1/4 teaspoon Old Bay, 2 Tablespoons of ketchup for color (otherwise it's a bit grey) and 1/2 red pepper and 1/2 green pepper finely diced for color. Oh, and I used a vadelia onion which made it even more tastey. Served cold with Triscuits and it was a huge hit at Thanksgiving.

Good base recipe.  I agree with some comments about it lacking something, and I added both the horseradish, and a lot of old bay.  But it gets you going in the right direction.  My wife took the left overs and wrapped them in wonton, fried them in some hot oil for 5 or 10 mins, and served them with a 50/50 mix of hot chili sauce and duck sauce for dipping.....PHENOMINAL.

This dip was absolutely yummy!  I was planning on making it for a shower, so I did a test run to make sure it was good, and my husband and I ate it all up!  The only thing I did a little different, was add a bit of grated cheese on top.  Delicious!

I have made this for years - but I never add the crab to the cream cheese mix .  I layer it - cream cheese mix, cocktail sauce, then crab.  looks prettier & you can taste the crab.

I've been making a similar recipe for years (decades) ever since my future sister in law gave it to me.  I don't bother with the crab since as another reviewer said, it just gets overwhelmed.  Instead I use whole small to medium shrimp, or coarsely chopped imitation crab.  Both have tastes strong enough to merge with the other flavors instead of sinking under.   You can make the cream cheese part a day or two before to let those flavors meld together.   Even spread it out on your platter.  On the day, pour on the cocktail sauce, then sprinkle on the seafood.  Easy-peasy.  If you want Christmasy looks, add a little fresh chopped parsley to contrast against the red and white.

I made this for a party recently, but it didn't taste like I thought, there was something strange about the taste, I'm thinking maybe the onion or W. sauce. It wasn't bad and people were eating it, I just didn't really enjoy it.

This recipe is great I've been making on like this for years, For a creamier and a bit tastier add 1/2 cup mayo to the cream cheese along with a few chopped scallions (mostly the green part) and 1/2 cup finely minced red or green peppers. Let it set overnight for flavor to meld. Also make sure to add the lemon juice it makes all the difference.  People love this recipe, great for office parties a.i. Christmas where I shape like a bell or ball and shake old bay on the top for taste and color.

This was tasty. I didn't use the full amount of sauce. Just enough to top the dip. I also subbed imitation crab for the real stuff.  Dip came out very good.

I kind of combined recipes, using this one as my core recipe.  I used 2 green onions instead of the small onion, used light cream cheese, added about a cup of cheddar cheese, fresh garlic, a couple T. mayo and a small amount of seasoning salt, left off the cocktail sauce and served it with crackers.  I made a recipe and a half but doubled the crab.  I thought the crab ratio was better.  It was a good consistency with the added mayo and light cream cheese.  People liked it and I would make it again.  It had good flavor since some people complained of the lack of flavor.  I think the flavor likely depends on the type of horseradish used.

It has too much onion and too much hot sauce, and not enough crab for my taste.
