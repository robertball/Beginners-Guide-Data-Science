This was a cinnamon toast like take on bacon! It was really good! To reduce wards, I used about 1/4 cup cinnamon and 1/3 cup sugar (I like a slightly higher sugar ratio), and this was plenty to coat the bacon.

I love bacon, and I love cinnamon and sugar together. I was not sure if I would like this with bacon though. I decided to try it and it's good. The only thing I did not like was the burnt residue (from the cinnamon sugar mixture) left on my griddle.

Made this today for a church group. They loved it. Brought home an empty plate! I used 1cup of sugar    and about 1/3cup of cinnamon and it was just right. Took about 40 min to cook and was crispy and not at all dry.

I think this would be 5 stars if the cinnamon and sugar amounts didn't make 3 whole cups for only one pound of bacon!!  WAAAAY too much, then it's a waste and has to be thrown away after putting raw bacon through it.  I would say us about a 1/2 cup of each.  Really yummy though and went great on a BLT as the intro says :) :)
