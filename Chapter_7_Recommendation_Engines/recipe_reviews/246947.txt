I cooked pork shoulder with the onions and garlic (I omitted the carrots) and simmered for 30 minutes. I then added the broth and the tomatoes and simmered for another 30 minutes. I also skipped the flour, didn't think the stew needed it. In the meantime I roasted, peeled and diced 2 lbs (not 2 each) of Hatch Chiles and 1 large potato. adding them and simmering 15-20 minutes until potatoes were cooked. A bit spicy but we loved it.

I’m originally from New Mexico and that’s IN the United States. I reside in Arizona now and the Mexican food is totally different! Here they use Anaheim and Poblano chili’s but back home it’s only Hatch Green Chili. It is grown in southern NM close to a little town called Hatch which if you don’t know the area it’s near Las Cruces and El Paso. I made a few changes. I cut the pork roast into chuncks, breaded both sides and set aside while I did the onion garlic and green chili. I added a lot more green chili. Have a large quantity of chili if you like spicier. Everything else pretty much the same. It turned out AMAZING! I’m making my second batch today for my stepson who’s in the Navy and been away from NM for a very long time. It’s actually my welcome home stew I’ll call it. ??

The recipe was great as is. I used much more green chilies, and added corn. Everyone at home enjoyed this stew. Oh yeah, I'm Italian, so I naturally add three times the amount of fresh garlic and it was delicious!

Was very surprised. I really don't care for pork but my family and I really enjoyed this stew. I added a little extra garlic and used poblano peppers. Next time I will use jalapenos for a little more heat. Will make this again for sure. .

Very nice stew, if you like chili you're going to like this stew. adds great flavor to an otherwise( I find pork to be a) bland meat.
