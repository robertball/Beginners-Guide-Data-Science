Loved this corn - all of us, even my husband (he had 3 helpings).  I did only add 1 tbsp of sugar, and added 1/3 less fat cream cheese, and it is gone.  I also used canned corn, 2 cans, because it is more crisp than frozen.  Thanks DAS!

Yep...  This is a good one.  I used half the butter and half the sugar, which made it a five star dish.  Any more sugar, and it would have been too sweet.

I thought this was really yummy, but maybe just a tad too sweet.   Next time I'll probably not use "sweet" corn and reduce the sugar a bit. My kids loved it!!

This did not work for us at all. This was too heavy, too dry, too sweet and canned corn would not have been as chewy as the frozen. Also, I had to add seasonings that weren't called for. No one finished theirs and I had to throw most of the pan out.

Very, very good---def. a keeper.  I did not have any bread crumbs, so used Ritz cracker crumbs and they tasted great.  I plan to make this for a family supper over the Christmas holidays.  Can't wait!

Made this for dinner and it was good.  I used canned corn because that was all I had on hand.  I also used crackers instead of breadcrumbs...only one suggestion is to reduc the amount of sugar...it was a little too sweet. Thanks for the post. Delicious

This was not my favorite recipe . . . The ingredients sounded wonderful but the corn was way too sweet and I thought a bit dry.  May try again using canned summer crisp corn and 2 tablespoons of sugar instead of 1/4 cup.

This recipe was simple to make but way too rich and sweet!  Next time, I'm going to leave the sugar out (there's enough sweet flavor coming from the corn) and only add 1/2 of the cream cheese.  Overall, it's a simple side dish, and the bread crumbs topping is delicious.

This would have been incredibly thick if I had not added some cream.  Also, I thought it had a little too much cream cheese.  Other people liked it pretty well though.

This was yummy, on the sweet side. The leftovers were great as a base for a corn chowder with leftover mashed potatos and some 1/2 and 1/2

I have mixed feelings about this recipe.  It WAS sweet and not exactly super creamy. I used ritz crackers crushed up on top and can't imagine what dry bland bread crumbs would taste like on this. Corn is generally sweet so you really don't need all that sugar. This is not your gourmet creamed corn recipe, but okay for a regular dinner and something different.

This was great!  I didn't have bread crumbs on hand so I just used some crushed cheddar goldfish...it turned out very tasty.  I'm making it again tonight, for the second time this week.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I had never had creamed corn before and I figured I'd give it a try for a bbq my bf and I were having. It wasn't what I was expecting but I really liked it.  It's a really good recipe. :)

I made this twice and both times it came out wonderful.  I cut down on the sugar and cream cheese for health reasons and did not bake it.  Other than that I stuck close to the recipe.  Good recipe!

I made this FIVE times during the holidays since I had so many dinners to attend. This recipe was a hit at every dinner except one. The one dinner this recipe didn't go over well was the one where I used store bought bread crumbs. The other times I used crushed Ritz crackers with melted butter on top of them, however, I didn't use an entire cup of cracker crumbs. I just covered the top lightly with crumbs. I also made this in the crock pot and it was delicious as well, but I omitted the bread crumbs in the crock pot version. Try it, you'll love it if you like a sweeter tasting corn.

I cut the servings down to 4. After reading the other members reviews, I only used 2 ts of sugar because I was afraid that it would be too sweet. The other reviews were right in the fact that this was very dry. I will probably make this again, because my fiance liked it. Next time, I might try to add in some chicken broth to the mixture while it is on the stove top. That should break down the cream cheese a little more and make everything a little creamier.

Made this for Thanksgiving and did not have any leftovers! I would caution not to overcook...not even by 5 minutes. Your corn will start to get hard and shrink.

I found I didn't need to add the crackers or bake it to be fantastic.  Also used canned corn since I had it on the shelf.  I added a tablespoon or so of heavy cream which I think added a little more creamy, rich texture to the dish.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Based on the recommendations here, I decreased the sugar to 1 tablespoon. This dish was a great success--it was the only non-dessert item that was completely polished off at Thanksgiving dinner!

I just fixed this dish for Christmas dinner.  My family is typically a little scared of my cooking, but this got rave reviews!!  I used fat free cream cheese and cut the butter and sugar to make it a bit healthier.

I thought this was pretty good. I did add slightly less sugar though and did not add the topping. I enjoyed the recipe as written, but then added garlic powder and red pepper flakes due to personal preference; it was still great!

Delicious! Everyone loved this when I took it for Christmas dinner. I did change it a bit. I reduced the sugar, added green onion and salt/pepper, a bit of cayenne and I only had 1/2 a package of cream cheese so I used an equal amount sour cream.  I also used ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs. But this was all personal taste and this was a good recipe to base my changes on. Thank you!

I made this as part of my thanksgiving meal and it was excellent. I used drained canned corn, and I did not do the topping and baking part. It was easy, very tasty and everybody loved it. Thank you!

Delicious.  I took the advice of those recommending less sugar and cream cheese and I added a little heavy cream.  However, there is no binder (flour or corn starch) in the cream sauce.  My sauce seperated from the butter.  Not the prettiest.

This is incredible! I made this as a part of a southern lunch I cooked for my boyfriend, and it was a big hit.  Plus, it was easy. I split it up between 2 8-inch pans and the 2 of us cleared one. He raved over it. This would be a great addition to Thanksgiving, and be sure to have an appetite because you'll want seconds or thirds.  His mom already wanted the recipe, and it went well with chicken fried chicken, homemade coleslaw, cornbread, fruit salad, and of course sweet tea.  Thanks Marian for a recipe that was the talk of the day. P.S it would be great for a crowd because you could make lots at once, cheaply.

I halved this recipe to try as a pre-test for Thanksgiving.  I could never get my kids to eat corn until now.  They loved it. I used a tad less sugar as suggested and it came out perfect.  I can't wait for my guests to enjoy it on Turkey day...Thanks!

I feel bad writing the first negative review on this dish.  I took this to Easter dinner today, and no one really ate more than a polite spoonful.  It was very sweet, and rich.  It wasnt bad, just not my cup of tea I guess.

OMG!  My husband, who is the pickiest eater alive, gave rave reviews on the corn.  I made it for Thanksgiving dinner, rather than the canned stuff he requested, and it was great.  I do believe we now have a new holiday tradition.  Thanks for the recipe!

This corn was a hit today on our Thanksgiving spread.  We usually just have plain corn, but this year I wanted to try something new.  As recommended, I used less sugar.  We ran out of 9x13 pans, so I had to use a smaller one, but it turned out wonderful! We will have it again!!

Yum, yum, yum! I made it as written. The only thing I can say is it took longer for the cream cheese to break down as planned. I wouldn't change anything. Hit broil right at the end.

I left out the sugar and used a fraction of the butter.  I used 1/2 of the required cream cheese (low fat) and I still was overwhelmed by the richness of this dish.  My kids who love corn didn't care for this one. 
I think the concept is good, but we were disappointed with the results.

I used canned corn for this, and half the butter it called for.  I didn't bake it but used it in some other recipes that called for creamed corn.  I thought it was a bit sweet (I did read those reviews but I forgot when I made it) but otherwise fine.  It probably only took  2 or 3 minutes for the cream cheese to melt on the stovetop for me.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated.  I thought it was great.  It was sweet, but I love cream cheese, so it filled my craving perfectly!  I normally pass over left over vegtables, but I'll eat this the whole next day.

This was great!  Since this has been a holiday meal, I make this in the crock pot on low.  I add everything except I omitted the bread crumbs.  I do low heat for 4-6 hours.... great always and doesn't take up oven room!  GREAT RECIPE!

I made this for Thanksgiving and got rave reviews from everyone.  I cooked the recipe as stated and it turned out great.  It's a bit rich but almost everyone had more than one serving.  I ended up bringing an empty baking dish home!

This recipe was simple and delicious! I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. They ate it up and wanted to know what was in it. The cream cheese really added alot. All the woman asked for the recipe. I have never heard people rave over a vegetable dish before but they did over this one. It was great and it will be on my Thanksgiving dinner table every year. Thank you.

I made this for thanksgiving and every one LOVED it.  I decreased the sugar by a tablespoon and added crushed ritz crackers on top and dotted it with butter,  I got a lot of recipe requests and no left overs on this dish, thank you for sharing this recipe :)

This was a really great dish. I made it for a church potluck and everybody loved it.
***Update***
When I make this recipe, I don't use the bread crumbs or bake it. My kids rave over it and ask for it every year at Thanksgiving.

WHOA! Excellent! Made exactly as stated. My husband thought it was a tad too sweet so next time I'll cut the sugar by half and see how that does. Very easy, very good! Thanks for the post!

This is an excellent creamed corn recipe. I used fresh corn off the cob. It was delicious! I will definately make it again. Thanks.

I adore this recipe.  I used fresh sweet corn from the cob from a farmers' market.  I have to admit that I omitted the last two ingredients (the butter and bread crumbs) and used this recipe in place of the canned cream corn for a scalloped corn recipe.  I have made it like that several times now, and am addicted!  I will try this someday as is written in the recipe.

Delicious and a nice change over plain corn.  I made this last night and my family raved over it.  I used Splenda instead of sugar and it still came out good.  I will be making this again soon.

This is a great recipe.  Easy to make too.  I used canned corn and Ritz crackers for a topping instead of bread crumbs. It is a rich tasting creamed corn.  You could probably add a little more corn and it would still be delicious.

My family loved this recipe!  I don't care for creamed corn, but I was looking for a last-minute side dish for a family dinner, and this was the only recipe I could find that I had all the ingredients for.  I used canned corn because I didn't have any frozen.  I used frozen corn the second time I made it.  Delicious either way! Thank you!

This is a very easy and yummy creamed corn recipe. I make it all the time for me and my husband (my two year old is not too fond of it). We never bake it as a casserole, though. I just don't think that step is necessary.
