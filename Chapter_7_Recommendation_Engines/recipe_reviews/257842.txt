Delicious but a little hard to get the heart shape and spread the chocolate on the cracker. They were still super cute and yummy!

I'd rate this 3.5 stars. It didn't quite have enough chocolate if you're a chocolate-lover but it's a great option for a low-calorie sweet treat! I used dark chocolate instead of white chocolate and drizzled more over the top.
