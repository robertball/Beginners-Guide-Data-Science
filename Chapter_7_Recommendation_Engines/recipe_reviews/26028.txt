Good when you make a few changes. I had several fresh grapefruit I needed to use up so I used my juicer and added all grapefruit juice and no milk. I also put in about half a grapefruit finely diced into the batter. It added the perfect tangy kick and really tasted like grapefruit. I also made a glaze of powdered sugar and grapefruit juice to drizzle over it. Made a flavorful cake with the changes!

A beautiful cake, with rave reviews from all who tasted it. I made this cake yesterday, adding all juice instead of milk, rind from one grapefruit and the flesh chopped up into cake mixture, then cooking it in a bundt pan. I then poked holes in the top and glazed it with icing sugar and juice. It was such a success that now I'm going to attempt cupcakes the same way today!!

This is a wonderful recipe, but it needs cream cheese frosting.  I added 3 tbsp of grapefruit juice and 1 tsp of grapefruit zest to frosting. I put crushed grapefruit between layers.

The cake was good, although I agree with the other reviewer, it was kind of bland. It definitely needed to be iced. I made a simple icing from powdered sugar, a little butter, and fresh grapefruit juice -- with the icing, it was pretty yummy.  

It was also very crumbly, perhaps because I had to substitute for cake flour (1 cup cake flour = 2 Tb cornstarch in a cup measure - then fill  to 1 cup level with regular flour).

I made it in a bundt pan & it took about 50-60 minutes.

This is not good. TASTELESS! It doesn't taste like grapefruit at all! It might better be categorized as, "The Egg, Butter & Flour Cake". Perhaps you could eliminate the milk and add more grapefruit juice to it.

A really good way to use up grapefruit. I added some extra juice and rind after reading the other reviews and gave it a cream cheese icing and it was great!

I am so surprised that there isn't a photo with this recipe.  This recipe is great and tastes wonderful.  I made it for my daughter because she loves grapefruit. I added a grapefruit curd and grapefruit butter cream in between the layers topping it with fresh sturdy whipped cream.  Wonderful.

I tried the recipe 12/29/2009. I followed the suggestions that said to add extra grapefuit juice and icing. But I also added a bit of cinnamon sugar and nutmeg. I didn't have cake flour so I used regular flour and it made more than what my bundt pan would hold, so I made a small pan to go with it.   I made it with my niece and nephews, they enjoyed making it with me and it turned out great. My husband even said it was tasty as well.   A great recipe to add to the collection and get rid of grapefruit :o)!

I thought this was a good cake but laked in flavor. So to spice it up I made a glaze to go over it. To make the glaze mix some grapefruit juice and powder sugar.

This is my all time favorite cake recipe.  Everyone who tries it LOVES it.  My mom froze the birthday cake I made for her and sawed off a piece at a time so that she could have it all year long.  When I make it I sub extra grapefruit juice for the milk and I usually add in about 20% more fluid (juice + milk) than the recipe calls for.  I also add more zest than is called for and leave a little bit of pulp in the juice.  And  be sure that you use fresh grapefruits - it makes a HUGE difference.

Used all grapefruit juice instead of milk, added lots of zest and a bit of lemon too. Top this cake with lemon cream cheese frosting and you won't want to share it with anyone else ;)

I thought it was a good basic cake recipe. I when the cake cooled I poured grapefruit and fresh OJ on top of the cake, I think a great consistency and a awesome flavor.

My attempt to make this recipe was a comedy of errors.  We just moved into our home so I am living half out of boxes.  My original plan was to make muffins with cream cheese icing.  I had an old grapefruit, still good but just starting to show its age.  I adjusted all ingredients for high altitude.  I prepped the liquid ingredients first.  I followed the popular recommendation to sub out the milk for more grapefruit juice but I didn't have enough juice so I used apple sauce to make up the difference.  The rind was a little dry so I had very little zest.  Then I prepped the dry ingredients with with cane sugar instead of white, but I didn't have enough gluten free flour.  It was too late to recalculate the other ingredients.  After digging around in boxes, I found some gluten free cookie mix & used that to make up the difference.  I greased & sugared the muffin tins, filled the tins with batter & baked at 325 convection for 30 minutes.  I ended up with weird gross-looking concave cookie muffin hybrids!  They were super-glazed from the sugar oil & hard as rocks on the outside!!!  The second batch I only oiled the muffin tins. The muffins stuck so I destroyed them getting them out.  The third batch I oiled & floured with the last of the gluten free cookie mix & they came out a little easier.  But its not about the looks.  They all were DELICIOUS!!!!! Soft & chewy on the inside like cookies with a hint of grapefruit YUM!!!! No icing needed :)

I made some modifications based on the other reviews and my taste: vegetable oil instead of butter, all grapefruit juice instead of mixing w/milk, doubled the zest, and a bit of almond extract with the vanilla. I also reduced the sugar to a scant cup. I thought it was pretty good, although I would've liked more grapefruit flavor.  I'd make it again, maybe with a flavored glaze or more zest (not a fan of icing/frosting).

I followed others suggestions and replaced milk with grapefruit juice and in my opinion that might have been a mistake, both my husband and I thought the grapefruit juice taste was a little overpowering. Overall my husband thought the cake was pretty good but it tasted kind of off to me (however I am 10 weeks pregnant and everything smells and tastes weird to me these days). I made powdered sugar and grapefruit juice glaze for it and I am sure that contributed to the overpowering grapefruit taste (and just to be clear I love grapefruits).  I will make cream cheese frosting for it tonight and hopefully that will help the taste.  Oh and I also cut sugar down to 1 cup because so many recipes have way to much sugar for my taste but in this case it might have been too much of a reduction, I think I should have cut it down to 1 1/2 cups. And for me it took 40 min to bake.

A good cake. Sweeter than I expected, but not too sweet. When I made this for the first time, I made half the recipe with half a cup of grapefruit juice (squeezed from my grapefruit) and no milk. For the flour, I used  ordinary white flour. After baking for 30 minutes, I made a simple glaze. I squeezed the last of the juice from the grapefruit and added 1/4 cup of white sugar and cooked it in the stove until the sugar dissolved. Nice, light cake. For a full recipe, 2 grapefruits will be better than 1.

The cake did not rise so it turned out very dense. The batter was dry and I had to spread it to get it to go all the way around the pan. The grapefruit flavor was subtle, perhaps adding more grapefruit juice would improve the flavor and reduce the dryness of the batter. If I make again I will try beating the egg whites separately prior to folding into the batter.

Nice cake.  I did as others suggested and used all juice for the juice/milk component.  I wish I had cake flour to use, because I think it would have had better texture.  That said, it was tasty, and I will purchase cake flour and make this cake again with it.  Also, I'm not much for icing, but I think this cake would benefit from maybe a cream cheese frosting.  Nice way to use up some grapefruit.

Came out terrible, didn't rise at all, and very doughy. I am not sure what I did wrong
