This is a keeper! Very, very tasty. Very versitile as well. Instead of adding the spices, I just used a packet of taco seasonings and cooked the beef according to those directions. I also added a can of diced tomatoes to the beef. I used the tomatoes that have chili seasonings in it. I also used medium salsa. Instead of the olives, I added a 4 oz can of green chiles to the sour cream. I'm sure it would have tasted great without these changes. My husband just doesn't like olives, I LOVE diced tomatoes, and I didn't want to work so hard by adding the spices. Very easy meal. Kind of messy when done. Soooo good! My husband has already had seconds.

I mixed the refried beans and spices in the warm pan with the browned ground beef (it mixed easier as it warmed). I also precooked the noodles and omitted the water in the recipe. I layered as followed: a light layer of salsa on the bottom, noodles, meat-bean mixture, pepper-jack/monterey jack/mozza cheese mix layer, salsa. I repeated these layers, ending with a layer of noodles. I then topped it with more cheese. I baked it for 45 minutes, let it cool for 10 minutes (solidifies a bit in the pan and allows for easier cutting), and topped each serving with plain sour cream. Oh, it was so good! And even better the next day! Thanks for sharing, Popcklgal!

Awesome recipe! Here are my variations. I melted the cheese THEN added the sour cream. I used spoonfuls of sour cream all over the top, sprinkled cheddar cheese and chunks of avacado and tomatoes then sprinkled with chopped green onion/olives(mostly for presentation because it looks so nice). Made according to recipe it doesn't look as presentable. I also cheated and used the taco seasoning in the filling. This is a yummy dish that can easily be altered to suit anyones taste. If you use a disposable aluminum pan (drop the heat to 325) it seems like the noodles cook better and are not gummy as in a glass baking dish.

what a great recipe!  the reviews were very helpful.  i didn't have alot of time to wait for the lasagna to bake so i omitted the water and precooked the noodles for 8 minutes and baked the dish for 35 min., then the extra 5.  i also improvised, instead of "salsa" i made my own with 1 can of enchilada sauce, 1 jar of taco sauce, and 1 can of semi-drained diced tomatoes.  i layered the sauce along with extra grated cheese throughout and it came out so good.  it was a hit with my husband and 3 year old too, thanks!

This was surprisingly delicious!!  Of course I made some alterations--I always do, but I think it would've been great without any changes.  First of all, I used a packet of taco seasoning instead of the spices for the taco meat.  It's just easier and a lot more flavorful.  Secondly, I used a large can of red enchilada sauce mixed with the salsa to make a larger amount of red sauce.  I then used this as a layer in addition to the noodles and beef/beans, so that the flavor permeated throughout.  I poured the remaining on top before the cheese.  Lastly, I topped the finished baked product with chopped tomatoes, in addition to the black olives and green onions.  It really was beautiful!

We loved the taste, but the consistency of the pasta left alot to be desired. It was too good to let go of so the next time I cooked the noodles and omited the water altogether....now we're talking 5 star material! I took it to a pot luck and everyone loved it.

This is a very versatile recipe. I sometimes use ground turkey sausage instead of the ground beef with good results.  Also freezes well without the topping and is a wonderful make-ahead recipe just kept in the frig until you are ready to bake it. I have 4 teenaged boys and they all enjoy this recipe.  I add an extra can of refried beans, use a whole box of noodles, a half cup extra of water and prepare it in a 10 X 15 pan if I have a crowd to feed.  Thank you for posting this great recipe!

I loved this recipe.  It was so easy to fix and tasty.  I used taco seasoning mix to season the ground beef.  I also took the advice of others and put a few dollops of sour cream over the lasagna AFTER it came out of the oven instead of adding it along with the cheese.  It made for a very attractive dish.  Yummy.

This is a great recipe. I used a package of taco seasoning in the ground beef instead of the spices the recipe called for. I will make this again.

Somehow I must have goofed this up because the bottom layer of noodles were like leather.  The flavor of the filling was marvelous.  I think next time, I'll use prebaked lasagna and a shorter bake time.  If it works out well it'll be a five star for sure

I have made this twice now and it is always really delicious. The first time I made it exactly as written, but it seemed to be lacking something. The second time I made a few personal changes and it was better, but I still can't put my finger on what it's missing. The changes I made were the following. Instead of using the seasonings I just used a packet of taco seasoning added to the beef and beans. I also added some fresh cilantro, a can of diced tomatoes, minced garlic and chopped red onion. I used shredded sharp cheddar to the top instead of the pepper jack. I think I might try adding some ricotta or fontinella cheese to the beef/bean mixture next time. This also makes A LOT - especially since it is just my husband and I. Next time I will scale it down.

I used flour tortillas instead of lasagna noodles and jalapeno peppers instead of olives.  I also used low fat sour cream and low fat Mexican cheese.  I cooked it for a total of 45 minutes (sour cream and cheese for the last 10 minutes). Very VERY good.  My husband and my friend loved it too.

For us, this recipe is a regular.  Very tasty!  And easy to prepare.  I had some trouble with the noodles cooking all the way in the oven so here are some alterations so that you can make it with cooked noodles:
1. Cook the noodles on the stove before layering in the lasagna.  2. I used only 9 noodles to make it less "noodly".  3. Omit the water if you cook the noodles before hand.  4. Season the beef!!  5. Double the sour cream! Yum.

Fantastic.  Added one can of diced tomatos, taco mix and refried beans to browned meat and heated thru. Baked in two 8x8 inch pans and froze one for later as it makes a lot.

I made this recipe for my husband and three kids (7, 3, 2) and it was a hit! The only change I made was substituting the Pepper Jack cheese for cheddar cheese. We had made it a couple times and it is a definite keeper! I've even passed the recipe to some family members who loved it as well. DELICIOUS!

Easy to make and a different take on Lasagna.  I had to reduce the water the second time I made this because it was way too watery the first time.

This was so good! It's a much cheaper alternative to traditional lasagna. One bite in, my husband smiled and said we'll have to have this again!  I used the sour cream, green onions, and olives as garnish for each piece, and used jalapeño refried beans. Also, I used oven ready noodles & baked it for 1 hour + 10 minutes w/ cheese. Excellent recipe, very creative!

This was a 5 with modifications. I used 2 lbs of ground beef & sauteed with a chopped white onion & taco seasoning. I added one can of diced tomates, one can Rotel, one can corn (drained), 1 can diced green chillis & one can black beans (drained). I used precooked lasagna noodles and did not use the water. I spooned the beef mixture to cover bottom of pan and layered with noodles, dolloped sour cream & refried beans, cheese & cilantro. Then repeated the layers. Cooked for 40 minutes. I will definitely make this again.

One of my favorite new recipes. I would increase the jalapeno next time; we like our mexican food on the "hotter" side. It was even better as a leftover after it had set and the flavors had intensified.

I always make a new recipe as written, I hate it when people rate a recipe after they make a million changes. I liked it pretty good! Good enough to make again, this time inspired to add my own twist. I added corn, black beans, sautéed red and yellow bell peppers with sweet onions. Added all to the beef and bean mixture. When I layered I added a layer of cheese, noodles, meat mixture, and continued to repeat finishing off with cheese. HUGE HIT!!! I even had men asking for the recipe!! Lol!

This recipe is great. I will make it again with one important change though. I suggest to boil the noodles for a few minutes instead of putting them in raw. My top noodle was hard. Other than that this recipe is quick, easy, delicious and asked for again!

I have been using this recipe for years, my mom found it in a magazine.  I am vegetarian so I substitue a can of vege-burger for the hamburger.  Everyone that I have made it for loves it.  I have found that by putting some of the liquid in the bottom of the pan before layering helps to cook the bottom noodles.

I needed a vegan recipe for some friends we had over. I replaced the hamburger with black beans and a huge can of refried beans and left out the sour cream and cheese and just topped it with black olives. Surprisingly it came out well. I'll probably make it again with the bean substititution but with the cheese and sour cream.

Yummy. Will make again. I added a can of rotel and used taco seasoning instead of the spices used. Left everything else the same. Turned out great. Everyone loved it and had seconds.

I have to admit that I didn't make this 100% the same but used all the same basic ingredients. I browned the meat first and added onions,mushrooms and garlic to add extra veggies. I then drained the meat and added the refried beans and a small can of corn and let it warm up together. I did pre-cook my noodles also. Time saver! It turned out great! I never would have thought of putting all of this together. Thank you.

this is NOT MY REVIEW>>>mixed the refried beans and spices in the warm pan with the browned ground beef (it mixed easier as it warmed). I also precooked the noodles and omitted the water in the recipe. I layered as followed: a light layer of salsa on the bottom, noodles, meat-bean mixture, pepper-jack/monterey jack/mozza cheese mix layer, salsa. I repeated these layers, ending with a layer of noodles. I then topped it with more cheese. I baked it for 45 minutes, let it cool for 10 minutes (solidifies a bit in the pan and allows for easier cutting), and topped each serving with plain sour cream. Oh, it was so good! And even better the next day! Thanks for sharing, Popcklgal!

I made this recipe with venison hoping the seasonings would discuise the taste which I just can't seem to handle. Even I thought it was very good and  enjoyed it. The second day the venison tasted stronger so not for me but wow a big hit with the hunters. If I had made this with beef or turkey I would have faught them for it.

This is a good recipe, but I won't make it again - without several modifications.  I still prefer the 'ol traditional "Italian" lasagna.  I liked this more than my bf did (and that's one reason why I won't make it as often), especially since it calls for uncooked lasagna noodles (how easy is that?!!?!).  If I do make this again, I'll add more seasoning (way too bland for me / us).  I think other reviewers suggested adding a packet of taco seasoning to spice things up a bit.  I used fat-free refried beans, and think that robbed the dish of some flavor (my fault).  I didn't combine the onions, olives and sour cream together (my bf doesn't like sour cream or olives and I don't like olives either).  I just dolloped individual servings with sour cream and garnished with green onion, and chopped tomatoes.  This lasagna goes well with a tossed romaine salad with vinaigrette dressing, tortilla chips, salsa or guacamole and chocolate chip cookies for dessert.  Thanks for sharing!

My husband and I enjoyed this new twist on regular lasagna.  I reduced the recipe to six servings and put it in an 8X8X2 inch pan.  I used a full can of refried beans to make the layers a little thicker and added a small amount of shredded cheddar cheese to each layer.  I also used taco seasoning instead of the other seasonings and supplemented that with a sprinkle of cajun seasoning and garlic powder.  As recommended by another reviewer, I soaked the lasagna noodles for twenty minutes which reduced the overall baking time to approximately 45 minutes.  I'll likely make this recipe again!

We love this recipe. We've been making it as is for years. We've changed it up a few times with chicken and used Salsa Verde or no meat, just beans and black beans. This is always a hit!

I was against my better judgment to even try this recipe but I was trying to use up items in my pantry/fridge. I can see how kids might like it but you have even a mild love of pasta this is not the dish for you. Reminds me of something my mom would have served our family in the 80s. She was big on "casseroles".  Really just not good.

It was tasty--far too much water though. I'd certainly lessen the quantity by at least a cup. Boil the lasagna noodles just long enough to get them the slightest bit soft. I omitted the onions because my family doesn't much care for them. Could've used a tad bit more sour cream. Overall it was good.

Need to boil noodle a little before placing them in the pan. You will have much better texture. Otherwise very flavorful.

Very good. I also used the taco seasoning. I do think you need to double the amount of meat - unless you want such thin layers. I also added a can of diced tomatoes to the meat/bean mixture. Still trying to find a way for the top to look more presentable. Otherwise tasty.

This was good, however I made some changes as suggested by previous posts. I added taco seasoning to turkey meat, a chopped green pepper, a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles, and a can of whole kernal corn. I cooked the refried beans with the turkey meat. When layering I added cheese to each layer. Next time I will use black beans instead of refried beans and either mix some salsa with the meat or pour some on each layer instead of just the top layer per the recipe. Overall, good and will make again.

This was a good recipe. I used D's Famous Salsa, leftover from the Chicken Salad Wraps a few nights ago. It ended up being almost to runny. I think next time, I'll forgo the 2.5c of water, and just use the salsa. Otherwise, a delicious recipe!

Satisfying and filling.  I added a can of diced tomatoes to the meat (ground turkey) and beans (low-fat).  I also added 1/2 of a can of tomato sauce and taco seasoning to the meat.  I used no-boil noodles so I omitted the water and added the other half can of tomato sauce to the salsa instead.  I layered in the salsa and some cheese and added the sour cream after it was done cooking.  My toddler said it was good "zanya" and cleaned her plate and even my mother-in-law liked it!!!  Thank-you Shannon (and other reviewers).

This WAS soooo easy to make....and tasted like it took a while to prepare. We eat taco salad quite often...this is a new variation I'll prepare again! It was especially convenient because the ingredients, I always have on hand!

I would really give it closer to 4.5 stars because ultimately this is a great recipe; however, I-for taste preference-recommend leaving out the sour cream from the 'heating/melting topping' stage. Thank you for another great meal.

This was just okay for my family.  It really tastes like a cheap meal.  Maybe it's because I do a lot of cooking with lots of veggies.  I will not make this again.

This recipe was totally awesome! I enjoyed making it and my daughter and her boyfriend loved eating it. I know next time I will make a few alternations for taste but I will be using this as the base recipe. Thanks POPCKLGAL for the awesome recipe!

I only had 8 lasagna noodles so used a little smaller baking dish and used only 2 cups of water.  I found there was just enough of the meat mixture for the smaller dish.  I mixed the beans and seasonings with the drained ground beef in the pan to save on cleaning a bowl.  I don't like sour cream so just added the green onions, black olives and cheese on top for the last 5 minutes.  I really enjoyed this.

My family really liked this recipes! I put the hamburger meat in the food processor to have a finer consistency. Because I used more than a pound of meat, I had to add a bit of salsa to the meat/bean mixture to make it easier to spread. I also added fresh spinach to both layers since I'm a sneaky veggie mom!! I cut the lasagna into squares after being in the refrigerator and wrapped them in saran wrap for freezing. I had one for lunch today and it was wonderful! I have passed this recipes on to several friends. Yum

it was really good  I followed a lot of the reviews and pre cooked the noddles.  I used taco spiced ground turkey (on sale) instead of beef.  I omitted the water all together.  I also sprinkled 2% mexican blend cheese through out.  It turned out great.  I was surprised because I had some many healthy changes.  Will make again.

We all enjoyed this lasagna.  The kids love the taco pie from this site and I thought this looked similar with added nutrition (if that can be said with all of that sour cream :).  I will make this again.

Loved this dish.  My six year old son requests this at least once a week. My husband, who is not really a "Mexican" food fan, enjoys it as well. I've tried several "tortilla" Mexican lasagna from this site.  This was a great variation, with the lasagna noodles.

We are not salsa fans, therefore, instead of salsa and water we used enchilada sauce. It is delicious! Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

This would be good with tortillas instead of lasagna noodles.  It's kind of like a mix between a taco and lasagna and it's quite good.

This was a good, new take on lasagna. I used black refried beans and added a little cheese on each layer and used veggie crumbles instead of beef. If I would make it next time I would just make one change.  Instead of pouring the salsa-water mixture over the top, I would add a little bit in over each layer since the bottom noodles were not quite right.  Overall, not bad!

This was a great recipe however I used ready to bake lasagne noodles.  I also would change and add the salsa and cheese to each layer. I did add black beans and cilantro and like everyone else I added taco seasoning.

I love anything mexican so I was anxious to try this recipe. I soaked my noodles in a pan for about twenty minutes to make them pliable and they were fine. I used taco seasoning in the mix just because I had it and threw in a can of canned chiles. I also put the cheese inbetween the layers so I ended up using much more cheese than called for. We liked this very much Shannon and thanks!

This was very good.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and made some changes.  I added a can of diced tomatoes to the beef/bean mixture.  Also, I used a packet of taco seasoning mix instead of the individual spices.  I boiled the noodles first and omitted the water.  And finally, I doubled the cheese and put some over the first layer of the beef mix as well as on top of the casserole - you can't have too much cheese!  My husband really enjoyed it.

This was good but lasagna noodles were almost dissolved. I used Barilla and they are soft to start with. Would make again but with regular lasagna noodles. I also substituted gr chiles for black olives.

I've made this Mexican lasagna for several friends and they all wanted a copy. Everyone loves it and it's really very easy to make. My friends have made it and their friends have requested copies of the recipe. It must be around the world by now!

Very tasty.  I added a taco cheese blend to the meat/beans.  I also used salsa flavored refried beans for an extra kick.  Everyone love it!  Thanks, Shannon

Great Recipe!  However I did add twice the amount of spices called for due I like spicey food and that still was not enough.  If you like spicey food or food with lots of taste I would recommend you triple the spices called for.

Pretty good! Next time I would use more meat, even though I used 1.5 lbs I didn't have enough for two layers.
 Everyone loved it just the same!

Even though this this recipe needs to bake for a long time, it is so easy to make and so delicious.  Every time my husband and I ate the leftovers we kept saying how delicious it was.  The kids ate it too!  Extra bonus.

An excellent maindish!  I used colby-jack cheese and have also used a mixture of cheddar and mozzarella, just because that's what I had on hand. I've received so many requests for the recipe,that I just refer people to this site! Thanks, Shannon!

What a delicious twist on lasagna!  My husband and son loved it...me too.  The best part is, if you are regular "taco eaters" you probably have most of the ingredients already.  This is a tasty, easy recipe which can be made quickly and with very little mess!

Absolutely loved it. The only alteration I made to the original recipe was to add chopped onions and green peppers to the hamburg while frying.  My husband thought it was one of the best recipes I have ever made.

My go to casserole.  Like other reviewers  I use taco seasoning  and no boil noodles for short cuts.  I also don't add the water when using the no boil noodles.  Great comfort food for cold weather.

Versatile recipe turned out great. I made two changes- I used kidney beans instead of refried beans for some texture, and I used tortillas instead of lasagna noodles; which kinda makes sense. I’ll make this again...maybe with chicken!

This is really good! I don’t like beans so I used a can of beanless chili. I also decreased the water by 1/2 cup and added more cheese to top it off. I will definitely make this again.

I have made this several times and from the original recipe published years ago.  That recipe called for putting the casserole in the fridge overnight, before baking, and this allowed a partial "cooking" of the noodles, which absorbed most of the water.  That might solve the problem for those reviewers who said they had too much water. Also, the meat can be used without browning it in a skillet.  It cooks in the hour and a half allotted time in the oven, thereby eliminating the "messiest" and longest step for those who said it was too much work.  Don't make it harder on yourselves. Give it another try with the suggestions from the original recipe, which somehow got deleted. This really is a versatile and forgiving recipe. I'm making it tomorrow to welcome Autumn and the cooler nights that are now upon us. It's a great "comfort food" dish.

I followed the recipe and really enjoyed the flavor combination.  Next time I will add a packet of taco seasoning to the meat as well, just to punch up the Tex-Mex flavor.

Terrific, despite this being my first-ever home made lasagna of any kind. I made some rookie goofs, but that didn't affect the flavor. I made this AS-IS and am rating it as such. Thanks, too, to the reviewers who added the refried beans and spices to the meat while browning. It made it much easier to combine. I also pre-cooked regular lasagna noodles. NEXT time (one of many), I'll use the no-boil noodles and scale it down for a smaller quantity. SO good - thanks for sharing, POPCKLGAL

I have made this multiple times and it's one of my boyfriends all time favorites. I have fun with the recipe by using variations of the original recipe. I will use flavored tortillas, and have added a can of green chilis & a dab of black sliced olives.  Yummy!

I have made this twice and both times my very picky children inhaled it.  I did make a few minor changes....I used ready bake noodles, lean ground turkey instead of beef.  I also took the advice of a few reviews and used a packet of taco seasoning instead of the spices and added the beans to the warm skillet.  I left out the olives and added a little extra cheese.  It was delicious!!  I will definitely be making this again and again.

Added chiles to the meat and bean mix. Only used 1 cup of water and this turned out great. Definitely a repeat. I also added cheese in one of the layers and listened to other reviews, using taco seasoning instead of the spices listed.

Made this for the guys at the firehouse tonight. It turned out good and was well received. I doubled the recipe and used ground turkey instead of beef. I added mozzarella to the bottom layer. I also added a can of fire roasted corn and a can of green chillies to the second layer and added a can of ro-tel diced tomatoes to the top salsa layer and dolloped sour cream on to bake.  Then topped with Mexican 4 cheese blend and pepper jack. Awesome, and I will repeat it again since the guys liked it.

It was great! I added poblano peppers and red peppers to the meat and doubled the cumin. The quick and easy refried beans recipe on this site complemented the dish well. I'm going to bake this lasagna again!

This is delicious!  The few things I do different is prepare the noodles according to directions on box, put a very thin layer of salsa in the bottom of pan, then a layer of noodles, layer of meat/bean mixture, layer of cheese, repeat those layers and then end with a plain layer of noodles on top.  I ever so slightly water down the remaining salsa (just enough that it spreads a little easier) and top the noodles with that.  Since the noodles are already boiled, it only takes 35 minutes to bake, then remove from oven to top with sour cream and cheese and return to oven for 10 minutes.  Best if left to cool for at least 10 to 20 minutes before serving so it solidifies a little and makes cutting easier.  DELICIOUS :)

This was delicious. I grated a whole block of pepper jack for the top layer and added more sour cream and olives to cover the whole pan below that. I will make this again. My fiancé loved it too.

Very tasty. The noodles were a little weird. I'm going to try tortillas next time. I used a smaller dish so I used less ingredients. I added cheddar cheese to each layer. You can't have too much cheese. The filling would be awesome in a burrito.

This came out great! I love anything pasta/Italian and my wife loves all things Mexican. What a cool combo. I did make a few tweaks. I boiled my noodles (al dente). I browned the beef (we're vegetarian so I actually used faux beef - worked awesome), added taco seasoning (followed taco season directions), and then added/mixed refried beans to meat in skillet. Then in a bowl I mixed 2 16oz jars of salsa, 1 can of red chilli enchilada sauce, and about 1/4 of jar of taco sauce - used this as my "sauce." Then I simply layered noodles, meat/beans, sauce, and mexi shredded cheese (used 4 cup bag) like I would if it was a regular lasagna. Baked @ 350 for 45min. covered with tin foil. Uncovered and baked another 10min. I then used the sour cream and green onion mixture as a chilled topping per serving. FANTASTIC!

I used tortillas in place of lasagna noodles.  Easier to stack, making this a quick dinner.  Mexican oregano is a great spice for this - also a great opportunity to use up some leftover charred BBQ corn...  Didn't use water - the salsa is plenty liquid.  Add some green chilies for extra heat.

This was a pretty easy recipe to follow as well as alter and enjoy.  We used all ingredients as followed only omitting the olives and using light sour cream and whole wheat lasagna.  I made the beef and beans mixture and included taco seasoning along with the seasons called for. I layered each layer with pepper jack slices and topped it off with A Mexican blend shredded cheese (Monterey Jack, cheddar). I added 1 1/2 cup of water and a 8oz can of salsa. All of it came out nicely and yummy. It was a hit and will save to make again. I think next time I will add salsa to the bottom to give my pasta moisture down there as well as in the middle.  My pasta was a little burned but that was my fault. You won't be disappointed.

I agree, this was surprisingly delicious!  Unless you feel like an arm workout, while the beef drains heat the beans in the same pan with the spices, then add the meat once hot.  Unlike most reviewers, my family enjoyed the light flavoring of the bean/beef mixture. I did not boil the noodles but instead of pouring the salsa/water mixture over the top, I added it between each layer.  I wanted to freeze most of this, so I did not put the sour cream on at the end, instead dressing each piece with some. We will definitely have again.

This is delish!!  I used fresh garlic and extra green onions.  I suggest putting some sauce on the bottom of the pan to avoid having the noodles on the bottome burn.  Use "oven ready" lasagna noodles.

Great recipe! Totally easy and really delicious. I added half an onion, a can of green chiles, and also used the taco seasoning instead of all the listed spices. Worked great! Definitely a new staple in my recipe box.

This was great!  I made this for dinner tonight and got rave reviews.  I used taco seasoning in lieu of the spices and instead of salsa, I used Tabasco chili mix and cut some water out.  Yummy!  I think next time I'll do cheese in between the layers as well.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a terrific recipe.  Like most reviewers, I substituted taco seasoning for the spices and served the sour cream on the side.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  We all came back for seconds.  Will definitely make again.

Very good. I was nervous about the dry lasagna noodles so I cooked them first and skipped adding the water to the recipe. My family enjoyed this almost as must as traditional lasagna. I think next time I might mix the sour cream with some ricotta cheese.

Good recipe. 5 star with the following changes. I used the homemade taco seasoning recipe and a refried beans recipe found on this site. I took the suggestions of other and added a can of chopped tomatoes, small onion, minced garlic, and used the taco seasoning (omitted the spices) to the ground beef mixture.   I mixed green chiles with the sour cream and omitted the green onions and olives. Will make again

YUM! I really liked using the lasagna noodles instead of tortillas as in a lot of similar recipes.  I also used taco seasoning and can of chilis.  Added more cheese...used Taco/nacho blend and added another cup or so of cheddar.  There can never be too much cheese for us!  I layered it along top of the meat/beans mixture.  It would be good with a can of black beans or corn too. This is definitely a keeper.

Apart from adding some garlic powder to the meat, and using less water with the salsa, I followed this pretty much as written. I wish, however, I had followed someone else's suggestion of adding corn too. This is some great comfort food - very hearty and filling. Thanks, Shannon!

Good recipe. I also used the taco seasoning when browing the meat. I also put in diced tomatoes, & a layer of cheese on each layer. I also cut the amount of water to 1 cup. Other than that, I followed the recipe as is. Next time I would only use 1/2 the amount of sour cream though, bit to runny for my taste. With those changes, it was a hit...even with the kids, after they got past the look of the dish & tasted it!

We used black beans instead of refried beans and added a little chorizo with the hamburger.  Loved it.  Probalby will add corn next time.  I cut the recipe in half becuase I wasn't sure if we'd like it.  My husband and I couldn't get enough my daughter wasn't as happy.

Really simple Mexican dish!  I cooked the noodles according to package directions, and omitted the water.  I also used a store bought homemade black bean and corn salsa, we had no leftovers...I couldn't believe the entire lasagna pan was empty after dinner!

I thought this was really good. I did not have quite 2 1/2 cups of salsa, so I added some diced tomatoes with chiles. My kids thought it was too spicy even with the mild salsa. I may try to make a smaller amount next time for me.

My husband and I thought this recipe was alright.  My kids didn't care for it.  They said they would rather have tacos.

WOW. My family LOVED this. I was a little apprehensive about putting the uncooked noodles in there, but it worked out GREAT.  I did use a bigger can of beans (30 oz) and i cooked the meat with taco seasoning.  My kids even ate it and that is amazing...they complain if there is any spice on anything but this was a definate hit!

This recipe was a hit with my husband and his parents.  Next time I make it I think I'm going to leave out the salsa and serve it on the side.  It was a little overbearing for my taste.  I'm also going to add more refried beans to the mix.  I didn't use the black olives and I precooked the noodles, eliminating the water.  The sour cream and green onions added great flavor to the dish.  Overall, terrific dish for something different!

This was a good recipe with these changes: I pre-cooked the noodles, used taco seasoning in place of the spices recommended, and used more cheese than what the original recipe called for.  It could have been spicier for my taste; next time I will use medium or hot salsa instead of mild and add some cayenne.

This was just okay.  I used oven-ready lasagna noodles to cut back on cooking time.  It was tasty,,but just didn't "WOW" us like so many other recipes here.  I probably won't make this again.

This was good however, I made some changes.  To cut the cooking time, I used oven-ready lasagna noodles (this cuts cooking time to 45 minutes).  Since this was oven-ready, I did not add the water.  I also doubled the refried beans to two cans.  Next time I'm going to try using black beans in lieu of the regular refried beans.  Thanks for sharing!

I thought this was a nice change from regular lasagna.  I too precooked the noodles. I layered the salsa with the other ingredients, including about 1 cup of extra Monterey Jack cheese. My husband raved about the taste of this and went back for thirds.

Not bad.  Substituted the spices (cumin, oregano, and garlic powder) with taco seasoning for the beef mixture.  Adds more zest to the meat mixture.  Next time will try to add more cheese between the layers as I can’t get enough cheese.

I followed the advice of the other reviews, and I'm glad I did.  I used taco seasoning mix and I didin't precook my noodles.  I cut my cooking time to 35-40 mins.  I also don't use the pepper jack cheese.  I use marble jack.  With the changes the end result was terrific.  Definitely a keeper!

Very good.  I toned down the spiciness (colby-jack cheese instead of pepper jack) so my kids would eat it.  I also used my homemade salsa.  Yummy!  I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and I cooked the noodles before I layered it.  This helped it to cook much faster, pretty much just needed heated up.  I did go ahead and cover it with foil for awhile also, then took it off towards the end of the cooking time.  I also didn't have green onions, so I chopped up some regular onion and put it into the beef and beans mixture.

Very good and versatile. Cooking the noodles a bit first and omitting the water/shortening the cook time was an excellent idea. I added a teaspoon of cayenne pepper and a big can of diced chile/tomatos for a little extra kick. :) Thank you!

This recipe was very boring and had no flavor.  I like spicey mexican food.  I would recommend adding a taco seasoning packet to the meat for some flavor in place of the intended seasonings.

As our family is very health-concious, I used all low-fat or fat-free items.  It still came out excellent.  Every one in my family loves this recipe and I will make it over and over again.

I have to say I didn't really care for this recipe.  I've never used lasagna noodles that were not cooked first, and I found them to be very squishy and yucky.  I may try this again, but cooking the noodles first in the traditional way.  My husband and brother liked it though.
