This was  tasty.. seasonings good. The only change I would recommend is cooking the seitan a bit more until it gets some texture and  bit browned rather than just warmed

There is no cilantro on the list but it's definitely a necessity. Add it to the pan after adding the seitan and spices.

Great recipe.  I’ve made it a few times, but with only 8oz seitan and using all of the bell peppers instead of half of each.  That made for a better ratio in my opinion.  You can’t also leave some seitan and bell peppers off on the side without seasonings for picky young kiddos do they’ll enjoy making their own fajitas!
