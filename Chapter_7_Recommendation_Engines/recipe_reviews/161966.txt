This recipe was awesome the only thing I did different is I added the rest of the cooking wine in the bottle. Al little extra alcohol doesn't hurt any thing.

Was quite good. Doubled for my family of 8. Added more ham than called for, used 2% milk instead of half-and-half -- watching the waistline! Used white rice as I had no wild on hand. Probably better with half-and-half.

Pretty good.  Very rich though - I wasn't expecting that.

This soup will stick to your ribs!  Mine came out a little bitter...don't know if that is because I used wheat flour?  It is very tasty and very easy to make.  I used celery as well.
