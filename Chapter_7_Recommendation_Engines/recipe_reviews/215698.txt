We tried this last night and it was a huge hit.  Next time I will cut the recipe in half because it made too much for us to use at one time.

I tried this last night using the calculation for 2 servings. I did not use mayonnaise since I did not have any (and figured since people said it tastes like 1000 island dressing that it might be better without the mayo). FYI, I found that I could really taste the Worcestershire sauce.

Bless my husband's heart for making dinner for us tonight, but sshhhhh!!!  It tasted a lot like pork chops with a spicy version of Thousand Island Dressing.

This grilled pork chop received mixed reviews in our house with one person rating it a 2, one a 3, and I rated it a 4.  So I took the average of 3.  Next time I think I will marinate it first because that would help it give more flavor and make it more tender.  The sauce is like a slightly spicy thousand island dressing I liked but others didn't.  We generally like spicy and thought this could have used more flavor.  I will probably try it again, marinating it next time and maybe tweaking the sauce.

Easy-peasy recipe! I took out the mustard/ cayenne/ and chili powder and instead put in a spoonful of Thai Chili Garlic sauce. It was a huge hit, even on the indoor grill.

Fast and easy. Extremely soft.  Pretty tasty. I used plain, low-fat yogurt instead of mayonnaise in an effort to eat a bit healthier.  I also replaced the ketchup with pizza sauce, to cut the amount of sugar in the recipe.  Based on what other reviewers have said, I marinated the chops in the sauce for about 30 minutes.  It was good, but I think when I make it again, I'll marinate it a bit longer so the meat can soak up the flavours more.  I used chili pepper, but omitted the cayenne pepper because I don't like very spicey food.

The cooking method and sauce were great!  Cutting the recipe in half I had plenty for glazing six chops and plenty left over for dipping.

My youngest son and grandson, are big eaters, but they can be very picky, I wasn't sure they would even try them. They did and love them. I cooked them over the fire pit using juniper.

Excellent!  We will make this recipe resulting in moist, flavorful pork chops often. We agreed it was excellent and goes with a variety of sides. I  would only change the amount of glaze  per serving to 1/4 of what is listed.   Much better than the dry pork chop recipes in the past.

This was my first time grilling a pork chop. I wanted something that didn't require a 5 hour marinade. I followed the advice and cut the wet ingredients in half and there was only a small amount left over. I had 5 bone-in pork steaks. All I used was salt, pepper and the sauce. I also used a pizza/pasta seasoning instead of what was listed. Accord to my son, "That is one good piece of meat!" Will use it again.
