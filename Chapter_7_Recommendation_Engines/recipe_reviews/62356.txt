You don't really need to add pectin to quince jelly.  Quince is tart enough that it supplies its own pectin.  Just put the same amount of sugar in as you have liquid from cooking the quinces and cook to the jelly point.  I think I'd simmer the quinces a little longer, too, and it looks to me like there ought to be more water.

Quince/apple jelly is really delicious.  Just substitute half of the quince liquid with pure apple juice.

I would like to add, also, that there are two kinds of quince.  There are the quince from a tree that grows approximately 10 feet tall.  They look like a cross between an apple and a pear.  The quince that grows on a short red-flowering bush are less tasty and, in my experience, are mostly seed and not all that pleasant to eat.

Actually you are not quite correct. Quince is wonderful eaten raw. Growing up in Germany it was a great summer treat for us kids. Yes, quince is quite tart, and it has a texture even grainier than pears. But it is delicious even raw.

I did not even know what quince was until some one gave me a sack full --tried this recipe and every one raved about it--of course I took all the credit.:)

Finally!  A recipe for the sweet little Quince tree the owner of the home before us left us.  Last fall, I had no idea what to do with the quince - and the sweet smell of a quince can be deceiving!  (I, too, found it tart - after a huge bite!)

What a perfect way to cook up my quince and enjoy them all year long.  Thank you!

I have not tried this recipe yet, but one can eat a quince raw. I used to eat them sprinkled with salt as a kid.

my grandmother always made quince jelly and it was my favorite. i can't find it anywhere in stores. her recipe did not use pectin either, and the sugar was a little less than the same volume of quince juice after being boiled and squeezed through muslin, so 4 cups of juice would be a scant 4 cups of sugar. i love this stuff.

Good receipe clearer jelly comes out if you don't squezze the cheese cloth Just let it drip out maybe even over night. You can also make jam with quince if you chop up the fruit small and prepare like normal marmalade but you must peel first

Delicious.  The quinces were way too sour to eat alone.  I used pectin to err on the side of caution and the jelly turned out just right.  I'm not certain why someone who has not made this recipe felt it necessary to make a negative comment when the jelly is very good.

I gave only 4 stars because I made a few adjustments. I took others advice and omitted the pectin. My jelly set up nicely without it. Also, I added more water than called for, more like 8 cups and mashed the fruit as they cooked. I then strained the fruit and water mush through cheesecloth and a sieve. After those steps, I followed the recipe to the letter. It looks and tastes lovely!

We've been making this jelly for 5 years.  We add a piece of cinnamon bark to the final boil and remove it after the jelly is ready for the jars.  It's a great hit.

Using this as a glaze for chicken! I had lots of quinces from my tree, and limited time, so I tweaked the recipe after reading reviews. I doubled the batch. I loosely chopped the quinces, using the cores as well - don't throw them out, lots of natural pectin! I used a large sieve to drain, and believe me, it drains slow. I used a large spoon to force the juice through. I probably could have let it sieve overnight and gotten a lot more juice, but I didn't have a sieve THAT big, nor the time. My juice was slightly murky, so after sieving initially, I sieved the juice mixture a second time. Used equal parts of sugar and juice mixture, which was perfect. I would use half the lemon juice next time. Just a personal preference. Canned 3-16oz. jars and had enough for tonight's dinner as well.
