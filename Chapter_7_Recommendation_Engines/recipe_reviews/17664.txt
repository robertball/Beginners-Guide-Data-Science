in order to bring out more of a butterscotch flavor and sweetness, first melt the brown sugar with the butter and a little bit of the buttermilk (just enough so it's not too thick) and bring up to a bubble so that you slightly caramelize the sugar and bring out that flavor. then just let that cool, then mix with the remaining buttermilk and eggs before adding to the dry ingredients. this will also distribute the sugar evenly throughout the mixture and give the crust a slight almost candylike crunch when it first comes out of the oven.

EXCELLENT is really the only word necessary to describe this.  I couldn't have cared less if the bread was "butterscotchy" or not - I just wanted something moist, lightly caramel-colored and pleasantly sweet with brown sugar.  This delivered exactly what I was looking for.  I had some fresh cherries and blueberries to make use of and I deliberately chose this bread for them. Two tablespoons of butter (for one loaf) didn't seem like it would be enough to me so I added another tablespoon for good measure.  Whether or not that was necessary I don't know, but it made me feel better!  The bread has a nice, almost crackly crust, with a dense, moist, incredibly delicious interior.  The handful each of fresh cherries (pitted and quartered) and blueberries I added  made this bread absolutely exquisite.

*Super* easy and yummy.  This is one I'll make again & again.  Oddly enough, it's not that sweet of a bread, which I like.

I was looking for a simple dessert and found this. I was a little scared when there was nothing special about the recipe but brown sugar, but when I melted the butter/sugar and let it caramelize a bit like emiliano lee said, it was DELICIOUS. Anyone who says there's no butterscotch taste should try that. Mmmmm.

This recipe is a simple breakfast bread.  It is nothing spectacular, but sometimes when you need comfort food this recipe is worth the effort.

I could tell that as is this bread would not have had a big 'butterscotch' flavor, so I added in a partial bag of butterscotch chips that I had in the pantry...YUM, it really gave this bread a great flavor and I believe that the addition of the chips was what this bread needed. I halved the recipe to only make 1 loaf, and that worked out fine. My hubby is a butterscotch lover, so I really wanted a good butterscotch flavor, and that was achieved. This smelled really good while baking, and was very moist. I will be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

A very pretty quick bread-it baked perfectly and didn't have me second-guessing if I should keep it in a little longer (you may be able to relate...) I enjoyed it most fresh from the oven. My bf thought it was much better with butter... which is likely because it's really not very sweet so he wanted more flavor? I'm thinking my use of half whole wheat flour may have contributed to the dryness it seemed to have relatively quickly (a day or so later). I also added a handful of butterscotch chips, which sank to the bottom, darn it! It was a nice recipe to try, but I think I'll find another recipe next time!

It didn't taste much like butterscotch to me. It's okay toasted and topped with butter or apple butter. I wasn't that impressed with this recipe.

Love the uniqueness of this recipe.  I did cook the butter, brown sugar and a little buttermilk together as one reviewer suggested, but I can't say it brought out the butterscotch flavor.  Most of that flavor came from the addition of butterscotch chips. I added a half a bag and next time would probably add more.  The buttermilk adds a really nice moistness and texture.

I loved this recipe! Made muffins with it, and cut the recipe in half & it made 12 perfect muffins! For my own twist, I added butterscotch chips and marshmallow creme. In each muffin cup, place a very small amount if the recipe in the bottom, then place a large rounded teaspoonfull of marshmallow creme right in the middle, on top of the mixture. Now just continue to fill with the mixture until it's about 2/3, 3/4 full. When they bake, some of the butterscotch sinks to the bottom and the marshmallow oozes out of the top. Makes it SOOOO yum and sweet all the way through, don't even need a topping! The marshmallow flavor is so tame, almost a sweet substitute for honey. All 4 kids DEVOURED them,.and so did their dad! Only had one left the next morning, so I buttered it and ate it cold, AMAZING. I have saved this recipe and will use it the rest of my life, as well as pass it on down the family tree. Thank you!

Okay bread.  I melted the butter and sugar together to get a better butterscotch flavor, but still wasn't what I hoped it would be.

I liked this but added a lot more butter. I was only making one loaf and used one stick. Also, I added some butterscotch chips.

This recipe is okay, I suppose. I followed the other reviewer's directions about caramelizing the brown sugar, and it did intensify the flavor, but overall there wasn't enough flavor in the bread besides "sweet". Not really a butterscotch flavor to this-- maybe if you added some extra butter, or butter-flavoring? At least it baked up prettily and had a nice texture when lightly toasted the next day. I guess I'll have to find another recipe to use up leftover buttermilk...

I had about one cup of butterscotch bits on hand so I added them  Other than that, I followed recipe exactly as written.  I checked them after 60 min, because sometime my oven temp is a little off, but they were done & beautiful!  I brought them to a church Book Cafe on the next day and got rave reviews.  The butterscotch bits were a nice addition but not necessary.  The general consensus with everybody was that they would've liked them just as well without the bits.

I'm currently deployed overseas -- I make a different bread with my bread machine out here every week.  The troops LOVED this bread.  I added coconut, chocolate chips and walnuts.  They said it was my best yet :)

I made one loaf to start with in case I didn't like it. I think my loaf took a little more than one hour to bake, but method and ingredients were very easy. What I did differently is adding some cinnamon chips while mixing my batter instead of raisins. My loaf cracked in the middle midway through baking and batter appeared through. This is why it took longer in the oven and the edged were little burned. I cut myself a slice as soon as I took it out of the oven and it tastes great. In fact I am writing this review while I am enjoying this first slice.

I did not care for this bread at all. Yes, it was very easy to make, and came out looking perfect. Unfortunately, it did not taste as good as I thought it would, based on all the positive reviews. Tasted nothing like butterscotch, instead just had a weird taste, in my opinion.
