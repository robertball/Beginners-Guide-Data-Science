Wow!  This one's a keeper!    I primarily followed the recipe, but made the following modifications:  1.  skipped the cognac and used only peach schnapps and 1 Black Box sauvignon blanc wine (equals 4 bottles).  2.  Added 6 sliced fresh peaches, 2 sliced ripe mangoes, 2 pints of strawberries, 2 sliced oranges, and 2 sliced lemons.    Put mixture evenly in 2 covered pitchers and let it sit in fridge for 2 days, stirring occasionally.  Turned a beautiful light peachy/pink color.    Served over ice in individual glasses, topped off with gingerale (3/4 sangria, 1/4 gingerale) according to individual taste in each glass.  (No punch bowl)  Enough for several days of drinking, so don't dilute with gingerale until serving time.  I even drank a glass on day 3 without any gingerale and it was amazingly good.  Unbelievably delicious!  Tasted even better on the third day...and the boozy soaked fruit was YUMMY to eat.

This is a fantastic recipe!  Served it at a bridal shower and it was a real hit.  I did add red raspberries just because they looked so pretty.  Next time I will make double!

This was a HUGH hit at my Bunco gathering!  I ran out of the punch.  I used only three bottles at first then added the four bottle as the punch dwindled down.  I used only two oranges, it was plenty.  This is a KEEPER!!!!!!

This was a very, very good sangria - numerous compliments from our guests.  The secret to any good sangria relies less on the ingredients than it does one very important factor - TIME!  When I make any sangria I usually make it the night before the party (or first thing the morning of).  The longer you allow the fruits and liquids sit the better flavor you have!  (Stir occasionally!)  Just remember your ginger ale (or whatever soda you add) is to be mixed in just before serving.  Time is one ingredient any good sangria simply cannot do without!

Made this for a Shakespeare in the Glen picnic and it was a huge hit. I took the previous reviewers advice and omitted the white sugar entirely. I did add sliced strawberries as they were lovely and in peak season and I thought it made the sangria that much more beautiful but I guess it did make it not strictly "white" anymore.

I made this for a party, and people liked it, but didnt' rave over it.  It was VERY sweet with the Ginger Ale.  I think I would have liked it a lot better without the Ginger Ale.  But, I think this is a good drink for people that like super sweet fruity drinks.

Fantastic.  There were only 5 people who drank this at the cook out and the entire gallon was gone.  everyone loved it.  it does creep up on you.  

I used a bit less sugar, natural sugar cane, not white sugar, it was all i had.  I also used a LOT more fruit.

I used everything i had in the house, mangoes, apricots, plums, lemons and peaches.

FANTASTIC  I will make this ALL the time.

Thought i would update this.. i just made it a second time for a friend who had never heard of Sangria.  She left with the recipe.  She is hooked and has already made it for a friend.  FANTASTIC

I made this for a party and it was a huge hit.  People kept saying they usually didn't like sangria or white sangria and they liked this.  I love white sangria because drinks always get spilled, but white doesn't stain.  I followed some of the advice and left the sugar out - it was definitely sweet enough.  I also loaded up on the fruit - nectarines, grapes, oranges, mangos...

Delicious..I made this for a Red Hat party and it was a huge success.  I doubled the recipe and used (2) bottles of Gwerztraminer white wine (which is sweet) and (2) bottles of Savignon Blanc.  Grand Manier for the cognac, Peach Schnapps, Lemon-Lime soda (added just before serving), and sliced strawberries, seedless green grapes, frozen peaches, sliced oranges for the fruit.  Let everything sit in the fridge overnight except the Lemon-Lime soda which was added at the end. Served in a punchbowl, it was fantastic!!  Thank you for the recipe.

Very tasty!  Served at a party and no one refused a refill.  Maybe one less orange, but otherwise perfect for a summer evening.

Highly recommended.  Major hit at a dinner party.  Make extra because everyone will love it.  Also, make copies of the recipes for your guest because they will ask you for the recipe.

This is a great, refreshing summery cocktail.  We like to add the gingerale to each glass as it's poured - it makes sure the last glass is as lovely and fizzy as the first, and also lets each person control their own alcohol intake.  I've substituted Sprite and club soda with equally good results, and for a little colour I added some frozen raspberries.  Works well with frozen mango, to cut down on prep time too.  I will definitely make this again!

Excellent drink!  I made this for a surprise 40th bbq and it was a hit.  I added more fruit...limes, apples, raspberries (at the end).  I also changed the cognac to brandy because it is a lot less expensive.  Thanks for the recipe.

Even without the congac this was a superb hit! It is the perfect summer drink that even the biggest beer fans will rave over.  I served this at a recent dinner party and although there were only 4 of us, we managed to drink almost the entire batch.  I will definitely be using this recipe again.

Great recipe!  I leave out the cognac and the sugar and just soak the fruit in the schnapps, that way it's not too sweet.  I also use sliced firm nectarines, blueberries and green grapes, but you can use any kind of fruit you want.

I have a recipe for white sangria which I obtained from a bartender in a Spanish restaurant in Northern New Jersey.  You can use the liqueur "43", or Grand Marnier in place of peach schnapps.  Use any and all kinds of fruit on hand.  I don't like to use bananas because they tend to get mushy and brown.  Make sure to marinate the fruit in the wine for at least a few hours, preferably overnight, and don't add gingerale until serving.

Big hit. I served it in a sun tea jug and added fruit to each glass. I used pinot grigio and white peaches instead of mango. The peaches were the best part!

This is my go to recipie for sangria or adult punch for a crowd. Be careful it can sneak up on you!  I add lots of fruit...have also used apples, pear, pineapple, its no fun with only one slice of fruit in the glass. Try it with frozen fruit in place of ice to keep it chilled for a bridal shower, etc.  I use trader joes "2 buck chuck" .  The recipe gives you a lot of room to play with different flavored liquor (mango rum, flavored vodka in place of scnapps).  But definately a keeper the way it is, too.

WOW!  I made this for a June BBQ and it was the hit of the party!  I didn't change a thing and when the punch bowl got low, we just tossed in more wine, schnapps and cognac.  We used Menage a trois white table wine.  The only change I might suggest is to quarter the orange slices so they'll fit into cups easily and I'll add other colorful fruit to the mix next time as other reviewers suggest.  Very yummy on a hot summer day :)!

I loved this! I used peach brandy instead of peach schnapps & cognac. The wine I used was a Riesling & it worked very well. I only used a bit of the ginger ale (I used Sprite) & then compensated for it by adding a little  sweetness w/ some simple syrup. I loved the orange & mango slices ... after we drank all the sangria I saved them to use as garnishes on mango ice cream.

I like this for the flexibility it offers. I used the recipe as a base and as such, I added our favorite fruits. We used oranges, peaches, and blueberries. Very pretty served over ice with a sprig of mint. Thanks for sharing.  :o)

Holy cow! This recipe was amazing! Everyone raved about it. It is easy to adjust and use fruit you like. I will definitely do this again. I will most likely add more schnapps, cognac and sugar. In fact, I will probably double the amounts given. But it was still an awesome drink!

I made this last night for a girls' night out at a friend's house.  There were 8 of us drinking this and we ran out!  It was ssssooo good!  Everyone wanted the recipe!  The fresh fruit at the store was hard as a rock, so I added one whole bag of frozen peaches and one whole bag of frozen mango.  We ended up eating all the fruit when the sangria was gone.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I have made this Sangria for many, many gatherings, both personal and professional and it is a HUGE SUCCESS!!  I load it with all types of fruit and let the fruit become plump with the Sangria.
Thank you, Thank you, Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

The drink of my last four summer parties! I can't tell you how many people have asked for this recipe.  Be careful...it can sneak up on you!

Extremely good!  Used regular ginger ale and did not find it overly sweet.  Served it at a women's group and everyone raved.  May eliminate the mango next time, not because the flavor was bad--it was wonderful, but because it was not quite as pretty as I would have liked.

I made this sangria and it is delicious! I used apples instead of mangoes because the store where I shopped didn't have a good selection of mangoes. It was a huge hit. My family loved it! I am definitely make this again. This is a keeip

I tried this recipe on July 4th of this year. It wasn't as sweet or as flavorful as  I had expected. It mostly tasted of peach shnapps and it needed way more sugar. I rec. adding triple sec if you make this recipe. I much prefer red wine sangria.

A huge hit at a big party we recently threw.  I receieved tons of compliments, and it was easy to make.  I let it sit overnight with one bottle of wine in the mix, then added the rest prior to serving.  Not one drop left by the end of the party, and we had a lot of other beverage choices!

This was a hit at the party! Everybodu loved it! I doubled the schnapps, and doubled the brandy that I replaced the conac with. I soaked the fruit over night and added raspberries, kiwi, star fruit, lemons, and limes in addition to the oranges. It was gone in a heartbeat....I should have made more.

I have used this recipe atleast a dozen times so it's about time I leave a review. I always leave out the sugar and depending on the crowd I might also leave out the cognac. This is such a wonderful drink with a great presentation, so perfect for Bridal Showers or Baby Showers, women go crazy for this drink- you will run out!!!

This was a huge hit at my jewelry party! I was asked for the recipe and have already seen it at some of the other parties I've been too. I found that it's best served over a lot of ice. Delish!

I have tried several recipes for white sangria, including another from this site, and this is by far the best.  I only had frozen mango so I added some of this as well as a cut up fresh peach to the oranges.  Everyone loved it.

Fantastic...I took the advice of a previous review and doubled the recipe and had some left-over...  (hurray for me!).  I've been adding more white wine, ginger ale and a splash of schnapps to the fruit and enjoying it for the last couple of days.

This is the perfect light summer drink!  Served this at a cookout and it was gone in no time!!  I followed the recipe for ingredients, but when I made the batch I added everything but the ginger ale, and refrigerated for about 5 hours.  I added the ginger ale just before serving but I actually liked the flavor better as it sat for awhile.  Next time I will just add all ingredients and then refrigerate.  Delicious!!  Like others said, this has quite a kick so drink slowly!

This is almost good. I made a few changes and it turned out great. I used Brandy instead of the cognac. I didn't have mangos so I used fresh peaches. It still needed more fruit so I added some grapes and apples. I also didn't have enough white wine so I used 1/2 white and 1/2 red. I also added 1-1/2 tsps of cinnamon. Yum Yum!!

Made this for a baby shower.  Unfortunately, not many attendees wanted to imbibe in the afternoon, but that left me with a lot of left over Sangria for the rest of the week.  I used apricot brandy and Sprite (that's all I had on hand) with a lot of different fruit.  It's a very mild taste, I thought, not too fruity or sweet, just refreshing.  I'd definitely make it again.

I hate white wine, but LOVE this & it will be my go to summer cocktail. 20 women devoured this at a shower last weekend... per the reviews, I didn't add the sugar and I just used peaches & raspberries. I also substituted brandy for cognac. Didn't add quite as much gingerale but it turned out awesome!

I have made this for 3 parties recently and it went quickly at each!  I do add some orange liquor and doubled the peach schnapps because I like the flavor.

This was drink was a big hit at my last party! I left out the cognac and sugar. Seems to taste very much like champagne.

I made this for a party and it was a hit..but I made some changes.  I only used two oranges - added frozen peaches and mangos and a few slices of apple.  Also..I only used one bottle of white wine.  It made a lot less sangria but the flavor was intense.  I thought only the girls would be drinking it but the guys were diving in too...and if you run out of ginger ale it tastes great with sprite too

This Sangria was absolutely yummy!  I liked it better than the red whine sangria (and I'm a red wine drinker).  The mango is a really great complement!  This one is going in my recipe box to make in the future!

This was my first time making Sangria - I wanted something lite and delicious - something perfect for an evening summertime party with the girls - well there wasn't a drop left of this.  It was delicious!  Even the people who didn't like Sangria drank this. Only thing I changed was the sugar - I made it superfine and I let it chill over night.

Made this for a BBQ and it was a huge hit!  Watch out though - people don't really notice how much alcohol they are drinking because it is so sweet and refreshing.

I made this for a cookout this weekend and got many compliments.  I also added fresh peaches to the fruit. and only used 3 bottles of wine (mostly because I ran out of space in my punch bowl).

I've never made white Sangria, though I enjoy it.  We we having guests for dinner and it's the only alcoholic drink they like.  After looking at several white Sangria recipes, I decided not to make this one because  peach schnaps with cognac, wine and ginger ale does not sound anything like what the 4 of us enjoyed at a restaurant recently.   This recipes also didn't call for a variety of fruit, which definitely was in other sangrias.  The one I selected was a huge hit, and I'll make it again. It just wasn't this one.

I had never made a Sangria, but it was requested for a party I was "catering"... MAJOR HIT!!! Ran out 3 times! I did add apples & maraschino cherries to the mix. At the end, everyone continued to rave about & gobbled up all the "potent" fruit. Next time I will definitely plan for enough of the ingredients for at least 4 batches since it was completely gone before the party ended!!! 
MAJOR HIT & DEFINITE KEEPER

So yummy! I used two 1.5 L bottles of Two Oceans Sauvignon Blanc and I doubled the cognac (1 cup), peach schnapps (1 cup) and sugar (1 cup) because I wanted it a bit stronger. It was a hit at my BBQ!

Awesome!!  Have been making this recipe for years and always a hit. I use Vella box wines and switch between white or red with same recipe. Also, I have all ways made it all the way through with wine and ginger Ale and let sit refrigerated over-nite. It is better made the day before.  I will be taking this to the Derby party tomorrow.

Maybe I expected too much given the rave reviews, but I found it be fairly average in flavor.  My fruit was close to ripe, but not quite fully ripe... maybe that made a difference.

People go wild for this stuff. It's my go-to recipe for entertaining--and it's so good you'll see your guests' eyes roll to the backs of their heads on the first swirl. I have made it many times now, various ways. I use Pinot Grigio for the white wine version, and it works equally well with red wine such as Pinot noir. Experimenting with other variations,  I have skipped the cognac, doubled the peach schnapz, used Splenda instead of sugar, and made the ginger ale optional (just because I'm not supposed to drink carbonation). I have also used sugar free 7-up instead. I recommend fresh mango plus sliced peaches when in season, and feel free to add other fruits as well such as apple and orange slices when mango is out of season. You really can't mess up this recipe--it's so good. Thank you for a big keeper!

This is a wonderful recipe. I did not add Cognac and it was still delicious. You can get creative with the fruit just don't add fruit that will get mushy. I like mangos, oranges, apples and frozen strawberries and pineapple since I already had them in the freezer. I did not need to add any sugar. I made this for a birthday party and it was gone very quickly. Luckily there was still fruit to eat!!

I use Sauvignon Blanc only because it's what I prefer.

Great recipe. I left out the cognac and changed up the fruit to whatever I had on hand, but this is a great base recipe. To be honest I normally just make up a sangria recipe, as it's very easy to do so, but it was nice to add in the peach schnapps, which I wouldn't normally do.
I let the fruit steep in straight white wine for a while before I added the gingerale, which made them extra boozy and delicious!

Big hit any time I make. I prefer using frozen peaches and frozen mango it keeps the drink cold without watering down the taste

I made this for Father's day and it disappeared!  I didn't have Cognac so I added a little extra Peach Schnapps and my mostly non-drinking crowd devoured it and asked for more!  :)

I made this for my friends 30th birthday party, I thought people would be mainly drinking beer and shots but the sangria was gone in an hour or so! I made a few changes, basically just added strawberries and raspberries and omitted the cognac because I didn't have any. I made it two days before and it was amazing! Will definitely make this again!

Made this for girls' nite and just myself and one other lady drank it - she definitely preferred it with the ginger ale. I followed the recipe and it was VERY strong and a tad too sweet. I used a sauvignon blanc, peach schnapps and ginger brandy. Used peaches, mangos and red raspberries. I also used super-fine sugar - definitely less than what was called for - and made it the night before. Boozy and maybe overly sweet drink, next time will ease up on the sugar and try club soda instead. But really good, pretty and easy.

Easy, versatile and delicious! Only used peach schnapps (no cognac), bunch of cherries, oranges and apples (no measuring). Added ginger ale to top off the glass right before drinking. Fantastic summer drink!

I decided to try this as a new sangria recipe.  I did not care for it much and my friends didn't either.  I guess just not our taste!

I actually ended up adding a lot of fruits and letting it sit over night. Next time I will peel the citrus I used as I feel that the skin added a bitterness that I do not like. Other than that, it was very good.

This was soooo good!  I cut the recipe in 1/2 and it was gone in no time.  I will definitely be making this again.  I didn't have Cognac so I used triple sec and was still good.

the wine was a little pulpy with the oranges.  Next time I  might use mango and peaches.  I don't care for pulp.  Other than that the taste was great!!

such a fun, yummy sangria recipe!  I added raspberries as well thanks to other reviewers' suggestions.  
It is very sweet though, so if you don't have a taste for too sweet, you may not like this one!
