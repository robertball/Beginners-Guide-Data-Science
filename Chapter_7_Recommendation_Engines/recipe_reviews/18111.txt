This is a recipe my mom has been making for a long time (except she calls it Pudding Cream Pie dessert).  It is great, and a good dessert for company.  The only thing we do different is mix the nuts into the actual crust.  Yummy!

Because I cannot eat gluten (flour), I substituted rice flour in the crust layer....it had to cook about 20 minutes but tasted fine.  I used sugar free pudding and cool whip to cut calories.  I also substituted Heath Bar for the nuts.

Fabulous!!  Everyone loved this and I will definitely bring to future events.  However, I made a few slight changes and will make some changes next time:
-I omitted the nuts completley, and instead used 6 Skor bars chopped.  I did a layer where the nuts were supposed to be, then a layer on top as directed
-the confectioners sugar was all sold out (my bad for shopping on Christmas Eve!) so I used normal white sugar but threw it in the food processor to make more fine.  Turned out good.
-next time, I will use a little less chocolate pudding and make more of the first layer (the cream cheese, whip cream, and sugar).

I made this without the nuts just because I don't care for them personally.  It was very good.  Not 5 stars for me but close.

This is one of my favorite desserts and I am always asked to bring it to our Thanksgiving dinner at work.  I do increase the crust ingredients as I find that the recipe amount is not enough.

This was very good.  I added about 1/4 cup of sugar to the crust because we prefer a sweetened shortbread crust.  I also omitted the walnuts, because I was taking this dish to my parents' house and my mom is allergic to walnuts.  I also doubled the amount of whipped topping to make the cream cheese layer a bit less heavy/thick.

This is a super easy and amazing dessert!  I've tried it with chocolate pudding, butterscotch pudding, and pistachio pudding (at different times) and it is always a big hit!  I've also substituted sliced or chopped almonds or pecans for the walnuts when family members have allergies. It is always YUMMY!

My husband said this is better than the chocolate delight he grew up on.  The only thing I changed was I used pecans instead of walnuts.  He is already asking me to make it again.

This is addictive and delicious, I don't know anyone who doesn't like this! And it's so easy to make. I made a half recipe and it fit nicely in a pie plate. I added 1T of sugar and 1/4c finely chopped pecans to the crust, and used real whipped cream (whipped it first with 1T sugar) instead of whipped topping.

Super easy and super good.  Could eat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner!!!!  Added more whipped cream to the cream cheese mixture so it is easier to spread and the crust wouldn't break. Made it with Dream Whip too, still good.  Have yet to add the walnuts, maybe next time.

This is an easy, tasty recipe.  My suggestion is to just follow the directions on the boxes for the pudding.  My first attempt turned into a big chocolate brick, but when I re-did the pudding it was great.

I also make this without nuts (personal preference).  Other than that, excellent as written, my husband, however, loves it when I substitute the chocolate pudding for butterscotch.  It is easy to burn the crust though so be careful when you're baking it.  It doesn't taste so great if it is over-browned.

I've made this a million times, Just came here to find the recipe again.  I like it with chocolate pudding, but my preference is with lemon. I buy the canned pie filling and put that on it. I've also had  it made with cherry pie filling. I also never put nuts of any kind in the crust. they aren't our thing!

This stuff is completely addictive.
