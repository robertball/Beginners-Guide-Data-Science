I thought this salad was very good although I ended up with way too much dressing.  I added more pasta - all in all about 8 oz. which made it much better.

I found this to be much too salty.  It could also use some yellow peppers for color and to add to texture and reduce the saltiness in every bite.

This was very good.  I did make some changes, though.  I used almost three times the amount of pasta called for, and it was not too much.  Also, I used only about half the dressing.  I used white onion, too.  Very good flavor.

I didnt leave myself enough time to let the salad set for a couple of hours and it was definitely better the next day. I used olive oil and it tasted too strong when we ate it just after making it, but you couldnt tell the next day. Also, I ended up making the dressing in a blender and that was a lot easier. I'd definitely make this again...but ahead of time.

I have used this recipe over a year and a half and love it! I make it all kinds of ways...somtimes we use dry salamie rather than ham but I always use all my favorite Italian veggies.(olives really make it prety) I have changed the dessing a tad, less sugar, less oil and I add a teaspoon of dill and a teaspoon of Italian Seasonings and also add pepper. It is a nice pot-luck dish!

Good base recipe.  Too much sauce for the amount of other ingredients.   I used a 12oz box of rotini, which is about 4 times as much as this recipe calls for, and that was just right.   I reduced oil to 1 cup.  I used 3 cups of ham and about 2-3 cups of broccoli.   I used a full half of a large red onion.   I added in a 6.5oz can (drained) of sliced black olives.   I also added in 8oz of shredded cheddar cheese.

This is very good, but it does make a lot of dressing for the amount of other ingredients used.  I used wagon wheels as opposed to the spiral pasta listed.  After reading the reviews first, I cut the dressing back to 3/4 cup of oil, but kept the vinegar amount the same.  This makes a nice main dish salad with all the meat and veggies in it.  I served 'Paula's Bread Sticks' from AR to complete the meal.

I almost doubled the pasta (I used shells) and I halved the dressing and it turned out perfectly!  Even my husband really liked it and he HATES cold salads.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a good salad, but my personal preference would be to have a little less ham and/or a little more pasta and veggies.  This would make a nice summer potluck dish!  Thanks for sharing another great recipe, CORWYNN DARKHOLME!
