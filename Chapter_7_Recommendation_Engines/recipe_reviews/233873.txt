As an Allstar Ambassador, it was my pleasure to work with the Bison Council. This was a recipe I choose to make and rate. As I thought it was out of my comfort zone with adding cranberries to a savory dish...Little did I realize, what a treat it was. The pairing of bison with the cranberries was fantastic. During the cooking process, the berries broke down and melded with the broth, meat and herbs and it made an excellent addition to my family's dinner. One bowl was left after everyone sat down to eat and really raved that it was quite delicious. I've used ground bison before and this was a 1st using it in tender cuts of roast. I will so be buying it as a great dinner treat for my family. This recipe was exceptionally wonderful, meat was tender, the broth and vegetables were over the top awesome! The recipe as a whole was just outstanding. If I had enough for the family to have leftovers for another dinner, they would be gone right now ;-) thank you for allowing me to be apart of making this meal. It's a winner!

I would have liked to give this recipe 4.5 stars if that was an option. It was very good, my husband and I really liked it and would make it again. We followed the recipe exactly. The bison was delectable and extremely tender. The cranberries added a unique flavor and depth but you have to be sure to cook it for the prescribed time, otherwise the cranberries taste like barf (we tried them half way through). Overall a very satisfying, interesting and healthy meal. Can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow.

Made this tonight and it was a big hit! I didn't have any marjoram, so I used sage. Talk about wonderful! Thanks for the great recipe!

Great one! We have a little problem with bisons in Czech, but I found an aurochs (I now, it sounds a little bit weird, but we are weird country) and it was delicious. Thanks:)

This went over very well at the family Christmas potluck. I cooked it as directed but then after the two hour cook time it went into a crockpot on warm for about 5 hours. It tasted MUCH better after the 5 hours than it did at the two hour point.  I will make it again but I won't coat the meat in flour before browning. I will grown the meat and onion together in the oil, then without draining the fat I'll make a roux with a bit of added butter and some flour, then I will add the liquids and add the meat back to simmer for 1.5 hours, then add the carrots and celery for 30 min. Then I would mix the beef broth and flour and stir in as much as needed to reach the desired consistency. Doing it this way (without coating the meat before browning) results in a much smoother liquid with a nicer appearance.

This was a great twist on a classic stew.  I live in the north east, so I did substitute bison with beef.  Because I work graveyard shifts, I did this in a slow cooker while I slept during the day.  It was so nice to wake up to the delicious smell of this stew!  When I visit my family out west I'll be sure to try this again more true to the recipe.

Eww.  Really gamey. Maybe my grocery store didn't have good bison but I sure paid top dollar for it.  If you don't like game, don't try this.

Family loved it! I couldn't find fresh cranberries so I used craisins.  Husband said it would be excellent with beef. 

Served it with corn bread and a green salad.

I wanted to fix my mom some easy freezer meals to help her get through the holidays and since she's a big cranberry fan I thought this would be perfect for her.  She just loved it and thought the cranberries added just the right bit of tart and sweet.  "Comfort food on a whole new level" she said.  I did have to use beef instead of bison and I served it over a bed a sour cream mashed potatoes.

I'm adding to my original review to say that I have made this several times now with bison, and it is always a hit. I even consider it my special "company" dinner. The only thing I change is to add splash of dry, red wine. My daughter has made this with elk and venison (sorry, Bison Council), in addition to bison and beef, and is always pleased with the results. 

**original review** I was sad that I couldn't find Bison and had to substitute beef. Otherwise I followed the recipe closely and was pleased with the results. Thick, rich, glossy broth and a slightly tangy taste. The whole family liked it. This time I served it with a crusty whole grain bread. Next time I think I'll put it over egg noodles.

I had venison tenderloin that I used instead of bison. Instead of fresh cranberries, I added 6oz dried in the beginning and at the end added a can of whole cranberries. The cranberry makes all the difference in this recipe. Everyone who tried it thought I used beef.
