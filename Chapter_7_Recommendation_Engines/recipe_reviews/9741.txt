Thank you Florida Ray, I think I have found my new favorite cookie recipe! My second batch is still in the oven but I couldn't wait to say how good these are. Such an easy recipe with so few ingredients, yet so yummy. I made one tiny change, I put vanilla in everything so I substituted a tsp of water for a tsp of vanilla. Yum!

Five stars. Give these cookies a try. You will be glad you did. I crushed the nougat in a plastic bag with a wooden mallet. My second batch of cookies, substituted 1 teaspoon of water with vanilla as the previous reviewer tried. Great good both ways!

Sooo yummy. these are my new favorite cookies! they are super easy to make and are delicious. I substituted vanilla extract for the water, which added a lot of flavor- i think theyd be rather dull without it. Also used vegan butter (earth balance) and it still turned out great! thanks for the recipe!

Didn't care for these much-seems to be missing something, maybe some salt/vanilla would do the trick.  The nougat was interesting, easy enough to make, but didn't really add anything to the cookie itself except for a simple crunchy-sugary taste.

My cookies did not turn out how I had expected at all. It could have been that in making the nougat, I waited a tad bit too long, which makes all the difference in the world! A tip to others: the moment all the sugar is carmelized and a light brown color; pour it immediently! It will taste how nougat should (mine tasted burnt, as I waited too long). Also, some reviews say to add more vanilla for better taste, but too much will make it taste odd, so watch out :). Other than that, the cookie was ok.

The batter ended up really dry so I added a splash of milk, and then it was moldable into the roll. I had a little fun and added twice the nougat, and the second batch I made was 1 cup sugar, and 1 square unsweetened bakers chocolate, made for a chocolatey-caramel flavour. The actual cookie is very much like a biscuit/cookie hybrid.

Had a bad day and wanted cookies. These struck my fancy because they call for a cathartic smashing of nougat. 

Followed the recipe almost exactly (just added salt). Came out great; everyone loved them.

These didn't have a lot of flavor, but were moist and sugary.

This is one of my favorite cookie recipes! Everything came out perfect, including the nougat. I kept it at medium heat and the sugar melted perfectly and hardened quickly. I did as some of you suggested and I substituted the water for the vanilla extract and it was great. I like that the cookies were thin, crispy and chewy all at the same time. The only thing was that I had to add alot of extra flour so the dough wouldn't stick when I tried to roll it up. Other than that, it was great, gone in 3 days!!! Very unique flavor, too.

I made this recipe because I wanted to try something different. I am glad that I did. I added 1 tsp vanilla extract and 1/2 cup butterscotch chips. Try it, you won't be disappointed.

Thank you, Florida Ray! And to the other reviewers as well - collaboration is a wonderful thing! My family loved these cookies - they are different and delicious. The buttery taste of the cookie and sugar-infused nougat are the perfect combination. The advice to not over-brown the sugar was very helpful to me. As soon as the sugar began to liquefy and became golden brown, I transferred it to the greased pan. Be careful - even though you use medium heat - that mixture is very hot! And it takes a minute to cool down enough to handle it. I actually burned my finger after I poured the nougat into the cake pan and grabbed the pan after a few minutes to move it. It was still very hot on the bottom under where the nougat was. 

Because we love sugar, I doubled the sugar and used one cup instead of the recommended half cup of sugar to make the nougat. There is also something entertaining to me about using a hammer as a part of cookie baking. 

I substituted one tsp of vanilla for one of the tsps of water as mentioned by another reviewer. 

The cookies took a little longer to brown on the bottom than the 10-12 minutes. Even though I made a few smaller cookies and a few larger ones - for me - the baking time was closer to 14 minutes, but I also use very heavy-duty cookie sheets. The cookies were not very brown on the top - they came out more white like a sugar cookie, but the taste is marvelous. 

My husband is an avid tea drinker and said he loved this cookie with this Typhoo tea.

Wow.  Ditto what another reviewer said -- my new favorite cookie!  These are delicious (I am a sucker for the taste of melted sugar caramel) -- I think the caramel bits would be delicious in other cookies as well.  I did add a pinch of salt (used unsalted butter), but next time I would use salted butter with an additional pinch of salt (I like salty & sweet together), and will give vanilla a try as well.  Thank you Florida Ray!

When these cookies were in the oven, I was sure I'd done something wrong. They don't come out at all like what I'd normally expect from a cookie, but they are somewhat like a Welsh cookie that is baked on a griddle. That said, these are delicious and make perfect company for a mug of hot tea!

I think the cookie would have been ok if I hadn't overcooked the nougat. DO NOT cook it until it is dark brown or it will taste burnt.

Delicious! I followed the reviewers suggestions and substituted vanilla for the water. The dough was a little hard to work with, but I didn't add quite enough vanilla...it probably would have been perfect if I added enough. Very tasty little cookies!

Very tasty.  I used a good quality spiced rum instead of the water, but then had to add quite a bit of water because its so dry here in the winter & the dough didn't want to come together.  They have a nice buttery caramel taste.  This is a keeper for me, especially because the ingredients are so common & they are easy to put together.

Yummy, soft with crunchy bits, caramel tasting. Loved them. Substituted hazelnut flavoring and vanilla for water.
