The first two times I followed this recipe, the chicken tasted a little too greasy for us.  I decided to give it one last try and substituted 1/2 cup butter for the oil. I also add a little milk to the beaten egg.  It turned out delicious this time.  We'll definitely make it again!

My family loves this recipe.  I make it with chicken drumsticks instead of thighs and the only change I make is spraying the pan with Pam instead of oil.  We've tried this recipe several times and they are ALWAYS cooked in the alloted time and are ALWAYS moist and yummy.  We even fight over the leftovers.

Easy, no-fuss fried chicken. The first batch I made was delicious and the family raved about it. I used baggies for the breading for easy cleanup. I also let the breading "rest" for fifteen minutes before putting the chicken in the oven, so the coating stayed on well and turned out nice and crisp. Will definitely make this again!

This recipe was really easy, and very good considering it was baked.  I had too much chicken to put in one pan so I decided to do a little test and pan fry the rest of it the traditional way.  The oven fried was better overall; it required less "work" because you only had to flip it once and didn't have to "watch" it and oil didn't pop out and burn me (as usual).  I think the key to keeping the coating on is making sure you pat dry the chicken first, coat well with the flour, shaking off the excess, quickly drudging it though the egg, which I added about 4 tablespoons of standard hot sauce to my egg mixture just to give it a little kick, and then really roll it around in the bread crumbs to get a nice even coat.  I added lemmon pepper seasoning after the chicken was in the pan right before it went into the oven and it really was delish.  Will do this again for sure!!

A nice recipe for "Fried" Chicken, it was crisp, delecious, great flavor, and the only thing I changed was using Pam instead of the half cup of olive oil. You don't need a lot of it, just a light spray. Will definitely be making this again.

I find this easy - use a large freezer bag for the flour (and salt and pepper), shake and remove the floured chicken and re-use same bag for the bread crumb coating (why use two bags?).  I also left the coated chicken in the fridge for a while before placing into the glass roasting pan with the oil already heated.  The finished coating is similar in texture to original recipe KFC, which is to my liking (chewy-crispy) but can easily be made more crispy by cranking the heat up for the last 5 min or so.

My grandma used to make us boneless chicken breast "patties" to take on vacation-- we ate then cold out of the cooler or hot when we got there. It would take her all day to pound, bread and fry this juicy familiar family favorite. I have not had chicken like that since she passed away... that is, until now! This chicken tasted very very similar to hers, with half the work. I used boneless, skinnless chicken thighs (b/c that is what I had), and only about 1/2 cup oil. My only advice is that you don't overcrowd the pan- maybe that is why some people's took forever. The chicken has to have space between the pieces for oil and air to move or they will turn soggy. I had my pan too full and realized it in time to separate into two before any problems arose. Overall, great, easy, tasty and not greasy, if you go easy on the oil and blot on towels afterward. Loved it!!! Thanks. Grandma lives on!

This is a good recipe and healthier than pan fried chicken.  I followed the recipe exactly as given. A suggestion, however, after coating the chicken, I placed the pieces on a wire rack, refrigerated it for about a half hour and proceeded with the baking.  The coating adheres better if it is on for a while before baking.

Spicing is done the way I would have done it. I found it too oily. I have done it another way where I melt 1 tblspn of butter in the dish and put the chicken skin side down for 1/2 the time then skin side up for the balance of the time. It turns out golden brown.

This is a tasty recipe.  I agree with the previous posts that you will need two 9 by 13 pans so that the chicken has room around each piece for better cooking.

Single best recipe I have pulled from this site!  I used half breadcrumbs/half panko on 8 drumsticks. I made sure the chicken was spaced out in my baking dish and poured only 1/4 cup of vegetable oil.  30 mins at 350 and then 30 mins at 375 and they were very crispy but very tender and juicy inside. WHAT A HIT!

I always use parchment paper to line the baking pan. No need to drain grease, ever! Just remove the meat when it is finished cooking, wonderful alternative to greasing or oiling a pan. Great for pork chops also....

Wonderful. I used breasts and legs. Modified the spices to include garlic & onion powder with the Italian bread crumbs.

Kinda did a little bit of everything everyone else suggested. 2 bags (1 for flour, salt & pepper and 1 for bread crumbs & remaining spices). Added milk to the egg dip. Let the breaded chicken stand a couple hours before putting it in a heated 9 x 13 pan with 4 tablespoons of butter.

Baked 350, flipped, baked another 350. Turned out moist, crisp, and delicious.

My husband loved this chicken! He went crazy over it. I made a few changes based on other reviews: added a few splashes of hot sauce to the egg mixture, seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper before adding it to the flour, added garlic powder to the salt and peppered flour and used less oil in the dish plus a little butter and heated it before adding the chicken, sprinkled lemon pepper seasoning and paprika over the chicken before adding it to the greased dish. I used thighs and drumsticks and baked at 375 degrees for 40 minutes. Also let the battered chicken sit before baking it to ensure that the coating stayed on. Came out perfectly juicy and so tasty. Will definitely be making more often since my hubby jokingly said, "you would have got the ring earlier if you fed me this while we were dating!" lol!

I use all chicken parts, and in the bread crumbs i mix in parmesan cheese, and instead of the oil I put a pad of butter (about a teaspoon) on each pice of chicken, works better and tastes better than oil

This recipe is so easy and tastes very good.  I sprayed Pam on the bottom of my pan then 1/2 way through the cooking process I added a little bit of olive oil.  That made the chicken crunchy.  Will make this again for sure.  Excellent recipe!!!

I've been making this recipe for quite sometime now.  Try adding a couple of tsp. Garlic Powder, a tsp. of Onion Powder and a tsp. or two of "Emeril's Essence" to the flour mix.  I also use a couple of sticks of butter to substitute the Oil.  Yum !  Thanks for sharing Jo Ann.

I first tried this recipe as it is here and came out great, but I wanted to try and make it more healthier and subsituted olive oil instead of vegetable oil and it came out great also-try it you'll never fry again.

Oh goodness, is this a delicious recipe!!  I just finished a piece of this chicken and it was fabulous-and I was eating cold leftovers.  I used drumsticks and altered the coating by a bit-I used plain bread crumbs and added garlic and red pepper flakes to the mix, along with some homemade Asisago cheese bread croutons that I crushed up.  I was a bit nervous about baking it, everyone here really has enjoyed the fried chicken recipe I normally use but they loved this one even more-as my husband said, "it's bangin'".  I guess that means it's a keeper!  :)Thanks for sharing.

great recipe, I suggest draining the chicken (as I do all fried foods) on brown paper bags, it eliminates the soggy end product.  ENJOY!!

I've been making my chicken like this for years, except I do NOT add the oil to the baking pan. I spray it, and bake skin side down for first half hour, turn and finish baking. Enough fat bakes out of skin and no extra fat is needed. Very Good that way. LOVE my way    ;>)

A very tasty twist on this is to use chicken tenders,dip in egg, then mix equal parts italian bread crumbs and grated parmesan, a couple grinds of fresh pepper.  Coat w/egg, then crumbs, drizzle olive oil in bake pan @ 425 for 20 minutes - turning once during cook time.  Lot lower in fat and big on taste.  My family raves about them!

This was great. I used chicken breasts (we don't really eat dark meat) and it worked out wonderfully. Perfectly juicy. I made my own bread crumbs from croutons. And like suggested in other reviews, I simply sprayed the pan with Pam. Not too greasy at all. Everyone enjoyed it, even my 1 year old who refuses to eat chicken! It was easy to make, and definitely worth making again.

A great base recipe for Oven Fried Chicken! I used Panko breadcrumbs, added my own preference of seasonings to the flour, and baked it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. It came out nicely crisp on the outside and nice and juicy on the inside, with lots of flavor. I used drumsticks, though next time will use thighs and I'm sure it will be even better!

I love this recipe!  I do not use more than three tablespoons of olive oil on a sheet pan.   I also use only boneless, skinless chicken breast in this recipe. This is great alone or on a bun the next day.  Great for the people on food plans to lose weight as well.

Great recipe.  Try finely crushed corn flakes (yes, the breakfast cereal) instead of bread crumbs and let drain on a rack instead of a paper towel.

This was very greasy and flavorless.  Three stars because husband said it was ok. Will not make this again.  I even let it set on papertowels and it was still mushy!!

The only thing I can say about this recipe is that it did cook in the time allotted.  It took at least twice as many bread crumbs as the recipe stated, and when I turned the chicken after 30 min., the breading stuck to the bottom of the pan, so 1/2 the pieces of chicken only had breading on the bottom half when they were done.  It was way more work and mess than it was worth.  None of my family liked it.  Maybe I'm missing something - the photo looks great, but I followed the recipe and I would NEVER make this again.

This worked out GREAT. I followed the recipe with very few changes (nothing to change the overall recipe though). I used leg quarters, cut. I sprinkled some Gram Masala spices into the flour and the bread crumbs. I also used butter instead of oil. I put 1/2c salted butter in my big pyrex baking dish, let it melt in the oven, then put the chicken in the pan. I cut up another 1/2c salted butter and put it around the chicken. I wasn't aiming for a healthier version of fried chicken, I just didn't feel like standing over a fry pan for an hour while cooking for my family. :) So with that much to fry in, it gave it a very fried-chicken flavor. The kids decided it tasted a lot like KFC and ate VERY well. I'll use this to fry chicken again! Right now, I'm off to eat the leftovers.

This recipe was great. I made a few adjustments, I used olive oil, and used wheat flour instead of white, used drumsticks and a couple pieces of boneless, skinless chicken breast.  It came out great. The kids loved it so much they wanted to each take a drumstick for lunch today.  Clean up is so much easier.  This will be a recipe I use again and again.  You know it is good when the kids say it is better then KFC chicken. :)

Quick, easy, fool proof.  Change the taste by adding your favorite seasonings to the flour.  Great for a crowd.  Fine without the skin as flour and crackers seal in juices. I've even cooked the chicken without the extra oil, just spray the baking pan.

The challenge with any oven fried recipe is to end up with a crispy exterior. In order to do so, I used a 3-prong approach. First, I used panko crumbs which tend to contribute crunch. Then, I opted to use convection baking which distributes the heat evenly. The first half of cooking time I held to the 350 degrees, and upped it to 375 for the latter half. And third, I flipped the chicken every 10 minutes. The reason oven fried products are difficult to crisp up is that at any given time, one side is down, meaning the down side is steaming somewhat from resting in its juices. By flipping several times, you maximize the time each side is exposed to the dry heat, thereby creating the greatest opportunity to lose the moisture that renders your breading soggy and unappealing.The chicken meat was juicy and meltingly tender. I added spices to the panko, including sage, marjoram, thyme and a whisper of cayenne. Hands down the best oven fried chicken recipe I ever had. BTW, not to worry if you don't have a convection oven. It's not a deal breaker. You can accomplish good results just by flipping more often. As by now you can tell I had to make significant changes to the directions in order to improve the results, so that loses a point. But 4 stars for the basic concept, ingredients, and prep procedure.

Made this as per the recipe and really liked it.  I used panko breadcrumbs and seasoned it myself.  I also put the pan in the oven to heat the oil then placed the thighs skin side down for the first 30 minutes. I turned them skin up for the last 30 turning up the heat to 375 for 10 minuites. Crispy - not greasy.  I'll make this again.

This is a very good recipe. I took the advise of someone else and prepped the chicken and let it sit in the fridge uncovered for an hour then baked it using 1/4 cup olive oil. Did add some granulated garlic to the flour and more pepper. The chicken came out very crispy and browned beautifuly. Yes, it tasted a lot like fried and much healthier.  I will be using this recipe often and might even try it on chops....thank you for posting.

This is a wonderful recipe, in order to make this a little less greasy, preheat the oil in the pan so the chicken sizzles and then place in oven.  The butter idea is good also as I like the flavor a lot.

We really enjoyed this recipe with the following revisions:   I sprayed the pan liberally with Pam then used 1/4 cup of oil.  I added a garlic/herb seasoning to the bread crumb as well as some red pepper flakes.  After laying the chicken pieces in the pan, I sprinkled a little cayenne pepper over them.  I baked for 30 minutes at 375 and 25 minutes at 400.  They were delicious!

This is very good!  I line my baking dish with foil and use vegetable oil spray to keep from sticking and lower calories.  Makes for easier clean-up.

I would have given it a 6 star but it don't go that high. I didn't have everything the recipe calls for so I improvised. Instead of bread crumbs I toasted a heel from a loaf of Sarah Lee soft white and added Italian seasoning to the crumbs. I did follow one of the suggestions another person made and added a little milk to the egg. Long story short, this was great. I am single and have gotten away from cooking full meals like I used to. Being totally sick of pre-made frozen meals (yuk) I am back to putzing around in the kitchen. I have a bad back so minimal stand up time is a real necessity. I prepped this up and had it cooking in about 3 minutes. I used a boneless, skinless chicken breast instead of a thigh or leg and it worked perfectly. One change I did make because of the comment someone made about it being a little greasy was I preheated the vegetable oil a few minutes in the preheated 350 oven so the chicken started to fry as soon as I put in the oil. Be careful doing this. I only heated the oil a couple minutes and tested it's temp with a small bread crumb.
This is a great recipe and I was amazed just how good since it took practically no prep time and only 1 visit to it while cooking. It couldn't be any easier.

Excellent recipe.  Followed other reviewers suggestions added a little milk to egg and sprayed pans with olive oil spray in place of the 1/2 cup of oil.  Chicken was moist and coating was perfectly crispy.  Will definitely make again!

I soaked in buttermilk all day. And for the breadcrumb mix i used panko mixed with cornflake crumbs. I cooked it at 375 for 10 min then turned down to 350..  Good recipe!

Using the ingredients listed except for the thighs (I used chicken tenders)I salt and peppered each tender before dredging. Instead of oil, I used butter flavored cooking spray on a foil covered cookie sheet and then drizzled Smart Balance on top of the pieces.  The key to baking tenders is a higher oven temperature and shorter cooking time. I baked at 450 degrees for seven minutes then turned the pieces over and baked for 7 more minutes.  My husband really liked it.

I make something very similar to this often. My proportions of ingredients are a bit different, and I add in Italian seasoning.  If you want to cut unneccessary trans- and saturated fats, and up the "good" fats (poly- and monounsaturated), then opt for olive or canola oil in place of the veg oil.  I love fried chicken, but I hate that its usually so drenched in bad fats, so this is a great alternative.

This was the first time I tried making fried chicken. The ingedients are simple and the recipe is easy to follow. I coated the chicken drumsticks and actually let it stand over night in the fridge b/c it was too late to make it. This worked out very well. The coating stayed on and it turned out crispy and delicious! I highly recommend letting it rest for as long as you can!

I searched for a long time for a great oven baked chicken recipe, and this is it!  I used plain bread crumbs, mixed my own fried chicken spices, then added half to the flour and half to the bread crumbs.  And I also used spray oil in the pans...pans because I used a family sized pack of both chicken legs and wings...it took three pans.  I baked it at 375, turned them after 30 minutes and cooked them for a total of an hour.  The crust was crunchy and good, this chicken moist and tender.  I left the skin on at hubby's request.  We all loved it, and I will definately make it again.  I read that some reviewers stated that it doesn't taste like fried chicken...well, it's NOT fried chicken...but it's really excellent oven fried chicken!

Just made this for dinner and I'm still lickin' my chops! I used chicken legs. and started by seasoning them with Chef Paul Prudhommes Poultry Magic. I also added the Poultry Magic to the flour with the salt and pepper. In the eggs, I added evaporated milk. To the Italian bread crumbs, I added,McCormicks Garlic and Herb seasoning along with a few sprinkles of Cayenne pepper and more black pepper. Before I put it in the oven I sprinkled a few more shakes of Cayenne pepper and paprika.  I sprayed the glass baking dish with lots of Pam, instead of using oil, and baked at 400 degrees. SOOO crunchy and yummy. The chicken cooked itself right off the bone!! The spices and pepper seasonings gave it a nice kick, but not too hot. You can adjust the Cayenne to your own taste, we like mild to medium. This is a KEEPER...Awesome!!!!!

I like this recipe. However it was a little bland, next time I will kick it up a little, maybe add a little white pepper and a few shots of hot sauce. 
I bake my chicken in a cast-iron frying pan. I was told to always use a cast-iron pan,when frying or oven frying my chicken. I have a huge pan that fits six pieces of nice sized chicken thighs in it. Also, I put oil (olive oil) in the frying pan and place it in the oven with just the oil in it. While I  preheat the oven to 350*.I prep the chicken and place the thighs in the hot oil in the pan I should be able to hear a slight sizzle thing going on when I place them in the hot oil and pan. This helps the chicken to not absorb as much oil.
 

To go with this chicken, I make homemade cole slaw, a pan of my delicious cornbread, or popovers, and a cast iron pan of my famous baked beans, I put a whole lb of crisp bacon, two medium onions that are already caramelized, 1/4 cup of unsulfured molasses, 1/2 cup of packed brown sugar. Add two large cans of your favorite Bush's baked beans. Bake for 1 hour. Also,for dessert  a nice carrot or chocolate cake and a slice of ice cold watermelon. Add my southern sweet tea, which is green tea with a bit of peppermint tea, which is very refreshing on a hot summer day. Yummy! this is a real Southern Maryland meal.

I've made this recipe before, and many times. Not from this site, just from my brain.  One suggestion I will make, do not add oil to the pan. Instead, use Pam or cooking spray the bottom so the chicken won't stick. The oil from the chicken is enough, especially if you don't take the skin off the chicken first. But if you are going skinless, the spray will be just fine.  Enjoy.

Much simpler than fried chicken and almost as delicious!! These were fun to make and everyone enjoyed eating them. My mom said that this chicken should become one of our new "company dishes." We followed the recipe as written except to use cajun seasoning in place of paprika. This one will for sure be made again!! Thanks for sharing!!

Thank you to the reviewer that said use PAM instead of oil. The chicken came out very moist; I can't imagine how greasy it would have been if I would have used oil. Also I used plain bread crumbs and seasoned them up. Very good!

This was pretty easy, and turned out great. I used chicken legs and just sprayed the pan with olive oil. We were impressed that the skin managed to get so crispy.

LOVED this!!! Easy to make, crunchy, tastey, and substituting olive oil worked perfectly! This is a winner no matter how you slice it: ingredients you'll have on hand, easy & quick to prep, easy to cook, and great taste without all the fat from deep frying! I was cooking for two so I halved the recipe, worked great, had plenty of leftovers. I added a little garlic powder to the breadcrumbs, but found with seasoned breadcrumbs I could easily go without the garlic, too.

I like these, but I suggest using italian flavored bread crumbs instead of plain.. they came out better when i used italian. I used oil, but a little less than the recipe stated. I think oil is a must in this recipe, because otherwise it will be kind of dry and won't brown properly.

I use a recipe from my cook book for oven fried chicken 1/2 cup flour 1 teaspoon salt and paprika 1/4 teaspoon pepper. But then I changed it a little for less fat, I use nonstick foil and cooking spray instead of oil or butter. My family loves it!

I definetely like this way of frying chicken than in a deep fryer, but we felt the breading was a little bland. Next time I will add either seasoned salt or garlic salt to it. My picky daughters loved it though!

Great recipe! I didn't use oil due to the other reviews so instead I used butter.  I made 2 lbs of drumsticks and thighs so I used about 4 table spoons of butter and the chicken came out so moist and juicy.  It was delicious! Thanks cook!

It was very good, but the bottoms were soggy. Next time I'll follow what another reviewer suggested and bake it on a cookie cooling rack over a cookie sheet. Great recipe though. The crust had a wonderful flavor.

This is a great recipe to get crisp chicken without frying and without the mess.  I used drumsticks because my kids like them best.  I followed a few others' suggestions and just used PAM instead of oil.  I used a ziploc bag to dredge in flour, then did the egg, and used the same bag to dredge in the breadcrumbs.  I also chilled for a short time in the fridge, and the coating stayed on great.  My son named this recipe, "Worlds Best Chicken', and asked for it again the very next night, so this is a definite keeper!  Thanks!

Very good.  I added extra seasonings to both the flour and the breadcrumbs.  I cooked it at the time and temp in the recipe and it was crispy and did not stick to my pan.

so yummy!! the only changes i made were that i added a packet of ranch dressing mix to the bread crumbs (like another user), and i also added the paprika in with the bread crumbs instead of sprinkling it on top. i cooked them on a pizza stone and didn't use any oil so they were perfectly crispy, and still juicy on the inside. will definately make these again!

I like this recipe. I made oven fried chicken before but it was not crispy like this one. I followed the recipe to a T and my family loves it. A major plus is no scrubbing the stovetop to remove the excess of grease that pops out of the pan.

When reading the reviews to this recipe I noticed that quite a bit of the ppl who gave it a 5 actually changed the recipe so much that, they didnt give this recipe a 5 they gave THEIR recipe a 5! lol. This recipe at face value is a little over rated. I gave this recipe a two because you have to cut down the oil alot, add more seasons to the seasoned bread crumbs and season the chicken more. A few of the reviewrs used a little italian dressing in the eggs. You also should spray your pan with PAM or lightly grease it, instead of placing it in half a cup of oil. I made the modified version of the recipe but gave this recipe a two because after the reviews I found out it was a little over rated and thought I would be fair and balance it out. I saw quite a few of the reviewers who followed the actual recipe found it " bland and soggy" after reading those reviews i didnt think I'd dare to follow the actual recipe to the "T".

This recipe was quite good.  I didn't have any breadcrumbs on hand, so I just put about 4 slices of sandwich bread and some italian seasoning in the blender until I got italian breadcrumbs.  I think that next time I'll try adding different seasonings to the breadcrumbs to get a different flavor.  It didn't taste fried at all, but very tasty nevertheless.

We really loved this chicken. I didn't use that much oil and I played around with the recipe a bit using buttermilk instead of eggs and playing around with the breading ingredients but I liked this method with the oil a lot. I make a lot of oven fried chicken and this was really good. I did have a mix of drumsticks and thighs and the drumsticks seemed to work better.

Made this yesterday.  Came out extremely moist.   Husband loved it, I found it a little bland.  I used 1 tsp each of salt and pepper and I just couldn't taste it.  Will change it up with season salt next time around and maybe some crushed red pepper and garlic.

Very tasty, chicken was surprisingly crispy!  I made a few adjustments to the recipe:
- lowfat buttermilk, salt, pepper, onion, garlic and coriander marinade for the chicken;
- added some sage and cayenne pepper to the suggested seasoning for the flour;
- mixed the bread crumbs with panko

...I can't wait to make it again!

Made some changes: 
1. Just oiled a cookie sheet (instead of 1/2c oil in a pan)
2. Added some Lawrys instead of regular salt to the flour mixture
3. Used breadcrumbs I'd been saving in the freezer and not Italian seasoning.
4. Used a bag for the flour and then the same bag for the bread crumbs.

Very good!!!

I used chicken breasts instead of thighs since I don't like dark meat.  Well, the concept's good. I have a deep fryer, but the deep fryer is a bit of a hassle to wash and *way* more oil is needed for that, and I think this is probably still less greasy & fattening this way. Which is why the concept is good.  Despite that, this just didn't taste like anything.  I haven't had fried chicken for a long time so it was certainly something different, but it was really lacking in any real flavor.  If I find a good mix of ingredients, I may try this method on it.

I will always use this recipe for oven-fried chiken. With this recipe you will never have to fry it again and cleanup is a cinch. I did add 1/4 tsp Cayenne and 1/2 tsp Coriander plus a little salt to the breading. It was very tasty, juicy but not greasy at all. Excellent!

Absolutely delicious!  I used chicken breasts instead and added a bit more paprika.  The whole family loved it!

Allow chicken to get to room temp before breading & baking or the cook time will be much longer.  I ended up broiling both sides at the end to get crispy.  Wonderful flavor!   My hubby doesn't usually care for thighs, but he enjoyed this recipe.

Good. Easy. And less messy than conventional way. But a Bit on the bland side even with a little more paprika and garlic salt. I'll play with it alittle.

Good.  had hard time getting all of breading to be cooked in oil.  Dry areas on chicken where it didn't reach the oil.

This recipe was a HUGE hit in my house! I skipped the paprika last time, but I think I'll give it a shot this time... And I used chicken breasts instead of thighs. Anyway, I use the same recipe for pork chops, and it's great on those too! Thanks!

It was a pretty decent recipe. I used chicken breast, and may have needed to adjust the timing because they came out on the dryer side, but thumbs up for the flavor! I will certainly try again with dark meat this time.

This a a good recipe, but you really need to season the flour. Our came out very bland. I'll make it again, only I'll be using cracked pepper and maybe some garlic to the flour.

This turned out pretty good but I will say that it was WAY too greasy for us. Next time I wont use the oil, maybe butter instead like some have suggested.

FABULOUS recipe with delicious results! I did everything according to the recipe with the exception that I only had 8 pieces of chicken, not 12. Next time I'll use less flour and less breadcrumbs because I think there would have been a lot left over even if I had used 12 thighs. Everyone in the family loved the chicken, from my husband all the way down the line of 5 kids to my 2 year old. I will definitely make this again!

This was a very good,easy recipe. I used 5 boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Just made them the same way, but used butter in the the bottom of the pan instead of oil. I did cook them a little longer on each side, about 35 -40 minutes per side. They came out crispy and flavorful. This was a great recipe for sure, I served with homemade rolls, baked potato, and corn and my family really enjoyed. Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious!  My family loved this recipe and it was a whole lot easier and healthier than deep frying.  I substituted panko for the Italian bread crumbs and added some buttermilk powder to the flour for a little extra flavor. Both the chicken legs and the boneless breasts I made came out juicy and tender!  Will definitely make again!

Just cooked this for the family and they loved it.  I did change some things though. I used boneless, skinless breast tenders and whole wheat flour.  I seasoned the flour with Season-all.  I also did the baggie technique with the breading and instead of breadcrumbs used Panko and it was so crunchy and great on the outside and moist on the inside. Definitely will do this one again. Gave it 4 stars b/c of my improvements and b/c you really need two pans.

This was great!  I have been looking for an oven fried chicken recipe that still tastes great.  My husband asked me where I bought it!! I made it as the recipe requires except used chicken legs because that is what I had.  I left everything else just like the recipe and it was delicious!!

Very good. Added seasonings (Lawry's seasoned salt, lemon pepper, garlic powder, adobo).  Used finely crushed corn flake crumbs.  I now keep corn flakes on hand just for times when I don't have bread crumbs in the pantry. Comes in handy and works well. Have made this placing butter in pan and also with placing chicken on wire rack.  More flavorful in pan without rack.

Just a suggestion, when oven frying, try using a half sheet pan and wire rack. You won't need all the oil, just a little spray of pam or the like on your wire rack. Eliminates the need to turn the chicken and gives a more even crust. Also bread crumbs seem to help give it more of  that "fried chicken" crust. One more thing, ya got ta season the chicken, salt, pepper, cayenne, oinon powder, season salt, not all at one time, but you get the idea. Go thru your spce rack, taste, smell, try different spices. Recipes are not wrote in stone, make them your own. (note) my wire rack holds the bird about one inch above the sheet pan.

This was an excellent recipe!  Like others, I made this because I didn't want to deal with the mess that involves frying on the stove.  The chicken came out perfect!  It was crisp on the outside but moist inside.  To the flour mixture, I added poultry seasoning for a great taste.  I will be making this again and again!

This came out perfectly. My dinner guests could not believe I baked it in the oven.  I used legs and thighs, and only used enough oil to thinly cover the bottom of the 9x13 casserole dish.  I didn't have a second dish, so I was able to fit six legs and five thighs with the sides touching but not crammed together.  This did not seem to negatively effect the breading or the way it cooked. It wasn't crunchy crispy, but it was a nice texture inside and out. I will be cooking this again.  P.s. I used only the ingredients in the recipe (no extra spices) and it had a great flavor. I will not be making any changes next.

I don't fry food often at all but was in the mood for fried chicken but didn't want to take the time.  This was my first time making any type of oven fried chicken.  I followed the recipe but used Mrs. Dash for extra flavor.  LOVED IT!  M 15 yr old son couldn't get enough.  It was really easy to make and I didn't have to stand over the stove.  THANX!!!

I let 8 drumsticks marinate in 1/2 of a small bottle of Italian dressing for 5 hours. Used 1/2 cup Italian breadcrumbs and 1/2 cup Panko breadcrumbs. Per another reviewer, I sprayed glass 9x13 dish with Pam, then poured just enough canola oil to cover bottom of pan. Added chicken and sprinkled with Smoked Paprika (my *new* favorite find on the spice aisle). Baked 20 mins at 400, turned, then baked 20 more mins, no need to add more oil as the chicken juices were plenty of liquid. The results were tasty. Hubby said "okay," my 9yr old said it was a keeper but she prefers KFC (we never eat there!), and my 7yr old said it was 5 stars. Personally I found the chicken flavor had more "depth" than KFC and it was not as crispy, but it sure felt healthier than deep-fried. For those who had a mess in their oven, try lowering your oven rack so the chicken is farther away from the heating element; you're heating it, not broiling it. Thanks for the post, I'm saving in my recipe box!

Removed skin from chicken thighs before cooking and it did great.  Super juicy.  Also did as recommended by others and skipped the 1/2c oil and just used Pam and a bit of olive oil.  We loved it, I'll make it again.

I don't know what I did wrong with this recipe but it turned out horribly. I did just what the directions said and the outside turned out to be greasy on some parts and completely dried bread crumbs on other spots. I might try it again but I was not impressed by my first turnout.

I think, like someone else said that this is just a guide. I marinated boneless, skinless breast tenders in Italian dressing,salt,and pepper for about 3 hours. I breaded it with the baking mix,crushed saltines, crushed pecans, and black pepper, I reduced the oil a little, so that it just coated the bottom of the pan, and I used a cookie sheet to bake it on. My family loved my version of this recipe. I will use this again.

Didn't change a thing. Had to cook a little longer than recipe called for (approximately 15-20 minutes extra. I served it with mashed potatoes, mixed veggies, chicken gravy, & Pillsbury Oven baked French bisquits. Thanks for the recipe!

Was too greasy and soggy. Chicken is bland and no flavor. Used spray Pam the second time and less greasy.

This was a big hit in our house and I will definately serve this again.  It was easy, inexpensive, and my whole family loved it (including a 3 & 5 year old).  I only had 4 chicken thighs so I cut the recipe by 2/3 but that was easy - as was the rest of it.  I also used Olive oil so it was slightly more healthy and was still very moist.  I left it in about 5-10 minutes longer and it didn't seem to affect the moistness of it either.  I served it with broccoli, rice, and rolls.  Excellent!

Using this recipe, I did eight drumsticks, but I forgot the oil in the pan while I baked it, but it came out very nice.  I did a second attempt for four skinless, boneless wings, and this time I did it correctly all the way through, and they were absolutely delicious.  A southern friend of mine is partial to dark-meat chicken and was VERY impressed with the wings.  He described them as "dark-meat breasts."

I added seasoned salt to the flour, and instead of a bowl for the eggs I used a quart sized baggie for ease in clean-up.  With a family of 6, I don't get alot of time to spend preparing meals, and being able to make fried chicken without standing over the fryer or the stove was a blessing!

Really good.I didn't add oil, I just spray some pam in the casserole and then on top of the chicken before baking.It's a lot less greasy. I tried substituting crushed saltines the second time instead of bread crumbs. Very good!
Made this again and used 1/3 cup of oil in the casserole and sprayed some pam on top. Also added onion and garlic powder and some paprika to the flour.

This is THE BEST fried chicken...oven or otherwise!  I've made it 5 or 6 times in as many weeks.  We love the white meat, so I cut boneless, skinless chicken breasts in 3 or 4 pieces each and follow the same procedure as the recipe.  I've used both Italian and regular bread crumbs, and I prefer regular (otherwise it tastes too much like chicken parmesan for me).  I also combine the paprika with the flour mixture; why make it an extra step?  I find putting the bread crumbs in a large baggie and shaking the chicken makes the final step easier and less messy.  I also use butter in my pan instead of oil; I put it in the oven to melt while cutting up the chicken (and I cut down the amount by a couple of tablespoons).  White meat has a tendency to be dry, but this recipe helps keep it very moist and tender.  We love this chicken!

this is a great recipe.  i did, however, make a few changes.  instead of 3 eggs i used 2 and a splash of milk, to which i added a few shakes of hot sauce.  i really spiced up the flour with s and p, onion and garlic powder, and a healthy shake of cayenne.  and instead of breadcrumbs i used crushed corn flakes.  and i didnt use all that oil in the pan, i just sprayed it well with pam.  then i melted a couple tablespoons of butter and drizzled over the top of the chicken.  over that i sprinkled some garlic powder and smoked paprika.  turned out really crispy and delicious.  i plan on trying this with fish as well.

This recipe was pretty good but I think it calls for way too much oil. I only used about 2-3 TBSP per pan (had to use two 9X13 pans, due to so much chicken). I find that the chicken itself creates lots of grease as it cooks, so I don't need all that extra fat. As some other reviewers suggested, I used a gallon size ziplock bag to shake the flour on, then let the chicken sit for about 15 minutes before dipping in the egg wash (with hot sauce), and then the bread crumbs. I even made some country gravy with the pan drippings. Yum!

This is my favorite way of doing fried chicken now. It comes out nicely crisp with just a small amount of oil. Leftovers were great too.

I made 10 pieces (breasts, legs, wings), ran a little short on bread crumbs but the flour amount was plenty.  Added salt, pepper, garlic, onion powder and the paprika to the flour.  Used half oil, half butter, which I heated while the chicken was resting after being coated. Cooking time and temp was right on, though I did let the breasts go an additional 10 mins since they were bigger than the other pieces.  BF gave it 4 stars I give it 3.5, only because I found the bread crumbs to be meh, flavor-wise.  Mine did crisp up nicely though, oh, maybe because I gave the tops a quick spray before they went into the oven.  Overall, a good meal, I'd just like a different flavor in the coating.  Will use this method again and experiment with the seasoning/breading. Thanks for the recipe.

Added hot sauce to eggs and simply sprinkled chicken seasoning and cayenne on the skinless thighs before flouring, then followed instructions.  As suggested by several other reviewers, did not use the oil; sprayed foil-lined pan with PAM and then sprayed the chicken with it too when placed on the foil.  Crispy yet tender with a great coating.Thanks, Cookie240, for sharing!

Yum, Yum, Yummy!! My husband loved this chicken. I followed the advice of others and let the breaded chicken soak in the fridge for about 30 minutes. I also added some milk to the eggs, garlic sea salt to the flour and grated parmesean to the bread crumbs. Used less oil than the recipe called for. I used bone-in breasts and drumsticks. Allowed the breasts to cook a bit longer than the drumsticks. This gave the drumsticks time to rest and let some oil drain off. Delicious. The chicken was moist and had a good crunch.

Yum, even without the paprika which I just noticed I forgot. Coated my pan with a little EVOO. Perfect chicken and let everyone choose their own dipping sauce if desired.

This is such an easy and mess-free way to make chicken legs for my kids!  They love cold, leftover fried chicken in their lunch bags and when I added this they went WILD!  

I added a few dollops of Country Crock to the bottom of the pan instead of the oil.  I also used half bread crumbs and half panko crumbs.  The chicken was done in an hour, it was crunchy, flavorful and SO delicious!  This one is definitely going into our rotation!

This chicken was not what I had hoped. It was nothing like good fried chicken. It was not crispy, and it was chewy and greasy. I don't think bread crumbs do any favors to this recipe.  The flavor was just not there, and I ended up peeling all the breading off because it wasn't good.

The breading was good. The chicken lack taste. The next time I will season the chicken first. Also, the cooking time is about 45 min.

I felt very Meh about these. They were too greasy for me. If I made them again I would not put the oil in the pan. They did not need it.

Excellent recipe, made it with chicken breasts instead of thighs since that was what I had on hand.  Moist and crispy with a nice flavor.  Covered a couple breasts with pepper jack cheese in the last 5 min in the oven to add a little kick. Both the cheesy and no cheese pieces were Yummy.

Made it as is and it was delicious-the whole family loved it!  I will try it with egg whites and cooking spray substituting the whole eggs and oil (it halves the amount of WW points that way!)

We had this recipe last night for dinner.  Our 18 year old son dove into it, and immediately said he loved it!  My husband said he really liked it too!  I thought it was just the right balance of crispy, with the meat being very tender and juicy.  Thanks, this is a great recipe, and as our son put it best, "That was great Mom, I loved it!"  And only left a bare bone, and a few crumbs on his plate!

Really liked this!!  Made for dinner, we didn't find it greasy and the thighs stayed very moist. I'll be making this again.  I mixed the paprika with the breadcrumbs and added just a little extra because I didn't want it just sprinkled on top.

I found it to be a bit greasy but the flavor was not bad. I also double dipped the egg and breadcrumbs. Next time I may add some parmesan and a bit of garlic.

I was looking for another chicken recipe and made this with all drumsticks. I took someone's advice and added lemon pepper to the bread crumb coating! I cooked for 20 minutes and turned over for another 20 minutes. Also, used Pam versus vegetable oil. The meat was perfectly tender and juicy. This is definitely going on the dinner menu rotation!

This recipe was just OK. I felt like it was missing something. Maybe next time I may add a few more spices to it and use regular bread crumbs instead of the Italian ones. I used chicken breasts and like others cut back on the oil a little. I will try again and play around with it some. Kids didn't hate it so that's a plus.

I have a husband who LOVES fried chicken but he has a wife who HATES making it.  Thank god for this recipe because I have found the next best thing for my husband. He was amazed of how good it tasted and the similarity to fried chicken.  Nice, crispy coating on the outside while the inside was moist and tender. This is a winner, winner not fried but baked chicken dinner!  Note: I used legs, not the thighs.

My family loved this.  I deskinned the thighs first and added garlic powder, lawry's salt, pepper & greek seasoning to the flour mixture.   I did end up needing one more egg and a tad more bread crumbs.  It was perfect!

Wow! Very tasty and easy to make. I only knocked it down a star because I made a few changes, as suggested by the other reviewers, including: mixing half breadcrumbs with half panko crumbs, lightly coating the pan with some butter spread instead of oil and then lightly drizzling some melted butter over the top, and letting the drumsticks "rest" with the coating on while I preheated the oven (~10 min).  Very yummy, and very close to actually tasting like fried chicken. Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe and my chicken turned out excactly like it should. However it tasted kinda bland to me. Nobody ate seconds and i didn't get any reaction at all about how good it was. I might make it again cause it was easy, but if i do i will add more spices.

This was enjoyed by everyone at the dinner table tonight. Rather than using the oil I lined a pan with foil and sprayed the an olive oil spray on it to cut down on sticking. I also sprayed it over the chicken before baking. Half way through I added some butter to the pan. We were pleased with the crunchy outsides and moist tender insides. I did, as suggested in other reviews, add some more 
seasoning. I added mine to the flour. And now as I am typing, I think it might be nice to add some finely grated Parmesan to the bread crumbs next time. But perhaps baking Parmesan for an hour would be too long. Thank you for posting.. this was close enough to fried for us for most of the time.

Taking the advice of previous reviewers I omitted the oil (just used a drizzle on the bottom of the pan) and upped the temperature for part of the cooking time.  Just wanted to pass on a word of warning, though - if you increase the temp. to give you greater crispiness, make sure it isn't for too long.  My chicken ended up extremely dry (I was also using a dark-coated pan, so it's my own fault) so I will make this again but be more careful with increasing the temp.  I also added a little garlic powder to my breadcrumbs which seemed to be a big hit.

I love how it's easy and not messy, the chicken was done just as I finished my sides. Great Recipe! I did put the bread crumbs in a bag as one rater suggested and used a little less oil.  The chicken came out juicy, golden, crispy and delicious!  My kids loved it!

I followed the recipe exactly, except for spraying the pan with a liberal amount of Pam instead of using all that oil (as suggested by others). Maybe the Pam is why the chicken didn't taste greasy to me-- but do drain the chicken on paper towels, as stated in the recipe. It turned out crispy and moist for me, with no soggy bottoms (even when I ate some cold the next day). Yum!

This is absolutely the best oven fried chicken recipe I've tried. Comes out crunchy, tender, juicy, and not too greasy. I use mixed fryer parts and it works great. My husband loves it and it has become the only way I "fry" chicken.

Very moist and tasty! I mixed some seasoned salt with the flour and baked it for 30 minutes longer than stated (I used thighs and legs). I will make this again!

Loved it!  And my kids and husband loved it as well.  I tried it first with thick cut pork chops and second with chicken thighs.  Both were very good!  Gives a nice flavor and texture of being fried without the fat.  The only thing I changed was instead of pouring oil over the chicken, I sprayed with  EVOO.  Thanks for the recipe!

This some good eatin'! I only rated it 4 stars because the seasoning needs a little tweaking. I used poultry seasoning instead of paprika (I'm out of it). I baked it for a total of 70 mins. 30 mins on one side then turn over and bake for 40 more. I also used 4 huge bone-in chicken breasts. It turned out perfectly and I've never made fried chicken before. I also sprayed the pan with a spray canola oil to cut down on the fat.

I had checked some of the other reviews before making it.
I stuck very close to the recipe. 
I used seasoned salt in the flour, enough that you could taste it, and did the rest according to the recipe.
I don't write a review unless I am duly impressed. It was AMAZING!! 
I had to cook it much longer, about 20 min. on one side and 30 on the other, but it was juicy and delicious! 
Will definetly keep this as a main recipe.

Excellent!  Made it for an informal get together and everyone thought I had actually deep fried the chicken!  I have made it many times now, sometimes with extra seasoning in the flour, sometimes not and it is always delicious.  I do cut down on the fat a little and only put in about 1/2 of the oil called for for the bottom of the pan, but don't go much less than that b/c the chix will start to stick to the bottom.  Yum, yum, thank you for the great recipe.  So much easier/less smelly/less mess than deep frying with still the great taste.

I divided this whole recipe in half to make 2 servings.  However, I used 2 chicken leg quarters that weighed 9 oz. each after they were skinned and as much fat as possible was removed.  After reading all the reviews about blandness, I solved that problem and these quarters were DELICIOUS.  I seasoned the flour with a small sprinkle of salt, and a generous sprinkle of cayenne and lemon pepper seasoning.  For my half recipe I used 1 egg, to which I added 1 large grated garlic clove and 2 tsp. of low-fat Italian salad dressing.  For the final coating mixture I used 1/2 crushed corn flakes and 1/2 Italian bread crumbs that I seasoned with extra dry Italian seasoning and cayenne pepper.  In lieu of using oil, I sprayed an 8 x 8-inch glass baking dish with no-stick spray.  I baked the chicken at 400 degrees F. (we live at 4600 ft. in elevation) for 20 minutes, turned it, and after the second 20 minutes blood was oozing out of it.  So I baked it another 10 minutes.  By then it was getting VERY BROWN.  So I nuked it on high for 2 minutes to makes sure it was done way deep down.  I’m glad I used a glass dish so that it could go from the oven to the microwave!  My husband says that this was some of the best chicken he has ever had.  It was plenty moist with all that coating to hold in the chicken’s natural moisture and fat.

I planned a great dinner but luckily had bought extra chicken.  so when 2 hungry unexpected guests arrived it was easy to just through together another batch.  Also great warmed inthe oven the next day for left overs.

What a great recipe!  Easier and less messy than frying, and easier than roasting a whole bird.  I did make modifications suggested by others and a few of my own, but the technique is great and the taste can be modified a number of ways.  I usually just wing it when it comes to seasoning fried chicken, so it's always a little different.  Here's what I did this time.  I started with 4.5 lbs of thighs and legs, 12 pieces.  To the eggs, added 3 Tbs. of milk, and 6-10 drops of Tabasco.  To the flour, added 1 tsp, each seasoned salt, paprika, and cayenne pepper.  To the bread crumbs, reduced to 3/4 c., added 1/2 c. Panko crumbs, and 1 tsp. each lemon pepper and Old Bay seasoning.  After coating chicken, let stand for 30 minutes before placing on foil lined, rimmed baking sheet sprayed generously with Pam.  Placed chicken on pan skin side down and dotted pan with 2 Tbs. butter.  That small amount of butter added great flavor.  No oil used.  Baked 35 minutes at 350, flipped and then baked 40 minutes at 375.  I bake a little longer because my pan was little crowded and didn't want to dirty another pan.  Drained chicken on a brown paper bag and used the pan drippings to make gravy.  After all, what's chicken without potatoes and gravy.  Chicken was juicy, tender, and crispy on the outside' and didn't lose any of the coating.  I think next time I will add a Tbs. of cornstarch to the flour mixture to make the chicken even crispier.  Wonderful!

This chicken is SO good! Tonight was my first time making oven fried chicken. My family loved it!  This recipe is so easy to make; the crust comes out flavorful, and the meat is super juicy (my favorite part).

I used two whole chickens cut up; the oven temperature and cooking time is still spot on. Not one piece was overcooked or undercooked. Not only is this recipe very easy, it's budget friendly which is a huge plus.  I'll be making this often. :)

I used 2 large chicken breasts sliced thin to make 4 halves. Seasoned the flour with onion and garlic powder and italian season. I followed the advice of another reviewer and cooked the chicken with oil in the bottom of the pan at 350 for 30 min turning every 15 min. Then turning the heat up to 375 for remaining 30 min, turning every 15 min. This really did help it get the true fried chicken crispiness you want from this recipe. Let the chicken rest on paper towels for 10 min. Served with mashed taters and steamed peas and what an excellent dinner! Chicken came out absolutely perfect without the mess of actually having to fry the chicken. Will definitley be making again!

Gluten free version:  I just tried this recipe.  I made mine with gluten free bread crumbs without any seasoning.  However, to add flavour and crunch I added grated parmigiano reggiano to the bread crumbs.  I omitted the oil completely and just put the chicken in a non-stick dish. I added some milk to the egg. It came out moist and delicious and didn't stick to the dish.  Time and temp are perfect.

This is the third time I've used this recipe. I was in love with it the first time I used the recipe even before I tasted it all because of how easy it was to prepare. Then I tasted it.... wow! I was amazed at the flavor and how the chicken was crispier than if I'd fried it in a skillet. Everyone loved it even my 4 year old who is extremely picky. And if you think this recipe does not get any better, it does. The second time we made it my 13 year old prepared it flawlessly!

Tried this recipe last night....awesome result.  However I took the recommendation from others and used almost no oil.  You dont need it.  I also made a light dipping sauce that is half greek yogurt and half light sour cream.  Add finely chopped oinion or shallots.

My family has been doing this baked fried chicken forever. Always a winner, but I do cut back on the oil.

I have no clue why this recipe only has four stars. It was great! The only change I made was spraying the baking pan with generous amount of cooking spray instead of all of that cooking oil. My chicken was very juicy on the inside but that may be because I checked it and realized that it didn't need to cook the full hour. Only took about 45 minutes for 6 nice size drumsticks.

I made this last night for dinner and hubby loved it.  This recipe is very simmular to an oven fried chicken recipe that I made for my children when they were little, about 30 years ago.  The only difference was, back then, I made them like chicken fingers and for little ones, it was a great hit and an easy finger food for the little ones.  I also do not use oil.  I use half and half butter to solid shortening.  For those who thought this dish was too oily, try butter/shortening.  You will notice that it isn't oily any more, but don't forget to drain on paper towels as recipe states. The butter adds flavor that the oil does not. For added flavor, use your favorite dipping sauce.  We used BBQ bottled sauce heated because thats what I had on hand, but any dipping sauce that you like is OK.  It is just as good without the sauce, though. Also, I used chicken breasts cut in half and butterflyed - this made for even baking and I was able to decrease the oven time to 20 minutes on each side.  Because of the changes I made, I only give this recipe 4 stars, but it is really a 10 star meal for ease and taste.

I love this recipe as it gives me the fried chicken taste without the oil.  I use a couple of different sauces to change the finished dish when Iam looking for a change.  I use this recipe and follow the instructions but the last 10 minutes of the baking time I will add BBQ sauce to get a nice yummy BBQ chicken.  Or I mix up an peanut sauce and baste the chicken for the last 10 minutes.  the sauce is
1/4 cup peanut butter
1/4 cup orange marmalade
2 T soy sauce
1/4 cup rice vinegar
sriracha hot sauce to taste
1/2 t red pepper flakes
1T oil
mix and baste on the chicken for the last 10 minutes

Tasty and pretty easy to assemble! I think the breading could stand some more flavor and/or serve with a good dipping sauce.  Will experiment with spicier ingredients for sure!

Great time saver.  Chicken cooks without all that fat, but still lots of flavor.  Great for Diabetics.  Have a blog at Http://Cararta.Blogspot.com/ that explains why it is so great a recipe.  Flavor, Convenience and something you really want to eat.

This was a decent start.  I was making 10 drumsticks and used half the amounts of flour & bread crumbs and it was more than enough.  Baked for 50 minutes at 385 and was perfectly cooked through.  Not very flavorful, but a basic recipe I can improve upon with more seasoning.

I tried this recipe tonight.  My husband and I love it. I read the reviews first, so I let the chicken rest in the fridge first.  I also used olive oil and butter for the vegetable oil.  I ran out of breadcrumbs, so for two of the pieces, i just used flour.  This recipe is a keeper!

My family loved this.  I used chicken tenderloins because that's what I had in the freezer, so they didn't have to cook as long.  The meat was tender and delicious and I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was amazing!  I added a few squirts of hot sauce to the egg wash, but I don't think it was  enough to make a difference (heat wise).  I was surprised how crispy it was.  I placed them on a papertowel to drain and while cooking, left space around each piece of chicken and I didn't think it was greasy or soggy at all.  I ran out of the bread crumbs with my last couple of pieces so just dipped in flour again; they weren't as pretty, golden brown as the others.  Not sure how they tasted, we ate the pretty ones first.

This was the way I use to do breaded foods..but now I go a healthier and yet a Delicious way. I grind oats in a blender until flour or bits of oats make a nice rustic crust and some wheat & maybe corn flour also..flour then egg then flour again...or flour egg and then rough oats for bread crumbs I only use enough oil to  coat the bottom of pan  under the chicken  pieces (the fat from skin makes enough OIL) do not CROWD & bone side down 1st 30 minutes check your oven mine cooks hot turn over finish cooking 30 minutes or how fast the first half took....CRISP & DELICIOUS Yet nutritious too

I made this with chicken legs. They're good but a bit soggy because of the amount of oil. I now place a very small amount in the glass baking dish - just enough for a small coating; the second attempt (with less oil) turned out much better.

This was ok. I'm Latina so we're used to more seasonings in our meat. I usually use three main ingredients in every meat we cook with and that's adobo, sazon and garlic powder. But I decided to give this a try because I'd like to learn other things to cook besides all the Spanish dishes I know(and love). This was bland. The coating was good but when u bit into the meat, u just taste flavorless chicken. And I even  made 3 slits on the drumsticks because that's how we always cook our meat so I thought the flavor would spread in and out of the chicken. Well at least the corn and mashed potatoes I made were still good. Sorry :/

Awesome, and so easy. Would give 10 stars if I could. I used panko instead of bread crumbs, and let the chicken sit uncovered on a rack in the fridge for about an hour before cooking. I also added some cayenne pepper to the flour. The chicken came out so crunchy and crisp on the outside, but moist on the inside. Great recipe, I'll be making this one a lot. Thanks, Cookie240!

Great crispy coating.  I only used enough oil to lightly cover bottom of pan, and it worked great.  Kids loved it too!

My family didnt like this very much. They thought it lacked alot of flavor. Even after I added hot sauce to the eggs and 3 tsps smoked paprika to the flour. We are going to try one made with potato flakes and butter next time.

Yummy and moist, followed the directions almost to a T and came out perfect! The only thing I would suggest is to add more breadcrumbs because I ran out halfway through. But I used chicken legs instead. Not sure if that matters.

This was such a good recipe! Easy to make, all the ingredients are staples in my pantry.  Cooked for 350 at 60 minutes, turning once and it came out perfect.  No leftovers, all gobbled up. I thought the cook time was long but it was just right.  Juicy and all.

This has got to be one of the most fool-proof fried-chicken recipes I have tried, my only regret is that I only made 5 servings; next time I will definitely make more.

I really loved the flavor of this. I used boneless skinless thighs (because that's what I had) and it tasted really good. I had to adjust the cook time, though.

This was delicious, and the best part was no mess!  I used seasoning salt (to taste) since I didn't have paprika, and omitted regular salt.  I also added a pinch of cayenne pepper for a little kick and it was wonderful.

It was not as crispy as I thought. I was a bit disappointed, but what can you expected-it's oven fried... The recipe itself is not bad, it's just not crispy. I'll probably try to make it next time, but fry it instead.

So easy and soooo delicious!! I am typically terrible at making fried chicken, but this recipe eliminated all of the usual stress and complications. My husband scarfed down three pieces as soon as he got home, because he loved it so much.

Hot dang this was tasty! Crisp, but still light. I did everything according to the recipe except cooked the chicken on a broiler rack to keep the bottom as crunchy as the top.

So easy and so good!  Next time I will use less oil or Pam as suggested by others, otherwise it was great!  The chicken was so moist and tender.  I used half the amount of chicken and it only needed 45 minutes in the oven.

Use any cut of chicken and adjust the cooking time. I used quarters and cooked 40 mins on each side. I seasoned the chicken also. Great!

This was a very healthy alternative to America's favorite food: fried chicken.  After reading other reviews I decided to use olive oil spray instead of vegetable oil and the result was great.  The chicken was not overly greasy or oily.  I served this with rice but next time I'll probably do mashed potatoes or potatoe salad.

Very moist and tasty. I used bone-in chicken thighs and the family loved it. I added some pepper and garlic salt to the flour and instead of using the oil in the pan, I added 3TBs of butter to the pan, put the pan in the oven just long enough to melt the butter, then added the chicken and cooked according to the directions. Adding it my recipe box because I'll definitely make this again!

Just got finished making this and the chicken is really moist. I followed the suggestion of using cooking spray ( I used Pam Olive Oil spray ) and used drum sticks instead of thighs. I will make this again so easy and yummy.

This recipe is a keeper. I love fried chicken but hate the mess. I've tried other "oven-fried" recipes, but none ever came out so crispy and close to REAL fried chicken as this one did.  I had the kitchen all cleaned up within minutes and the chicken was frying all by itself.  Tasty!

"Just like my Grandmothers!"  This is so traditional tasting from my childhood.  You would think that it was really fried instead of oven baked!  I did add some garlic powder to the breadcrumbs for extra flavour.  I also increased the oven temp to 400'.  So good.  THX

I used this on drumsticks instead of thighs and cut down on the oil (just brushed olive oil and sesame oil on each pan and then added a bit more when I turned them). I will have to try this on chicken breasts next time (I'm not a dark meat fan) because the breading turned out flavourful and crispy. Even my fried-chicken shy boyfriend liked it.

Good recipe.  I tweaked the seasonings and added Cayenne Pepper, Oregano and Natures Seasonings in addition to the S/P and Paprika.  I definitely recommend increasing the oven temp to 375 or 400 to ensure the breading get's crisp.

This is a solid recipe with real potential.  The method and basic process are real keepers - I'll experiment a bit with the spices.  I used panko (which I would recommend).  Italian flavor panko is fine, but plain flavor with a well-crafted array of spices would be an even better choice.

I'm sorry, but we didn't care for this one. The crust didn't have enough flavor, and was pretty hard.  I also thought it was pretty greasy. Made it for my 2 chicken loving sons, one tasted it and didn't want it and the other had a couple of legs and said "It's not that bad". Going to have to try another recipe I think, sorry.

This was awesome!!!  My son who is very picky even asked for another piece.  I used drum sticks and cooked it for an additional 10 minutes (chicken scares me to cook) but it still turned out juicy.  I also used butter instead of oil just because that is all I had.  This is one I will try again and again.

It was alright.... a bit flavourless tho. I added a bit of cayenne pepper instead of regular pepper to the flour but it still needed something else... not sure what tho. None the less everyone ate it without complaints...

I liked the fact that this is very easy and yummy. I work full time and go to school at night so I often have to find hearty meals that taste good and are quick to prepare. I only had bone-in chicken breasts so I cooked them much longer (about an hour.) I also had plain bread crumbs so I added my own seasons. I used italian spice, dried basil leaves and a hint of thyme. Paired well with a baked potato.

This was a nice alternative for 'fried' chicken, when you do not feel up to skillet frying a huge batch of chicken. My family enjoyed it.

This was good, if a bit greasy but fried chicken is usually somewhat greasy.  Definitely will use this recipe again.

It was very moist, but I thought it could stand a little more spice.  It did get crispy though.  I did use the butter instead of oil; however, next time I will only use 1/2 as much as it was greasy.

FANTASTIC recipe!  I used bone-in chicken thighs that I bought on sale.  I normally do not like dark meat, but this recipe was just fantastic.  I used nonstick spray instead of butter; otherwise made as directed.  I will make this again and again - thank you so much!

chicken was really delicious & moist. I added some hot sauce to the egg mixture & added a lil more seasoning to the crumbs. I used chicken wings & baked for 40min (2o min ea. side).

This should be a 5 star but 2 of my 3 kids didn't eat it.  My husband really liked it and said so twice (he doesn't usually comment on the food unless he really likes it!)  I made a couple of adjustments:  I only used 1/4 cup of oil and 2 T of butter for the bottom of the pan for a better flavor.  Also, after dredging the chicken, I let it sit for about 10 minutes so the coating would settle and stick to the chicken after cooking.  It worked great.  This chicken was very tasty and so juicy!  I really liked it.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was amazed at how well this turned out.  My kids didn't even know it wasn't pan-fried!!  I subsituted boneless, skinless chicken breasts for the thighs and it still turned out juicy and delicious.  I already have requests to make it again!

I made this recipe almost exactly as written.  Instead of adding a half cup of cooking oil, I sprayed a baking dish so the chicken wouldn't stick.  It was great!  And my picky kid liked it!

So good and so easy!  I made this with large chicken legs and it turned out great in the time suggested.  I seasoned the flour with a lot of extras (you could make this with whatever combo of spices you like) and used a combination of bread crumbs and panko.  I also cooked them on a rack and sprayed them with Pam instead of having them sit in the oil. Came out nice and crunchy for me.  Next time I think I will use the suggestion of adding hot sauce to the egg mixture for an extra kick.

My 11 yr old son said he didn't like preparing this recipe because it was too easy. The only changes I will make is to add more seasoning & make sure I dab the finished product on paper towels before plating. Will definately have my son make this again ~ great entree' for moms night off don't 'cha know!  Thanks bunches!

This was just ok for us. The taste was good, but I definitely think it would have been better on boneless/skinless thighs, or even boneless breasts. I soaked the thighs for a few hours before coating and baking in a brine mixture of water, salt, and sugar. It really helps to give the meat some flavor on the inside, and not just the outside. I might try this again with boneless/skinless chicken. Thanks for the idea!

This was quite tasty. I wanted to try something a little different, so instead of bread crumbs. I used dry stuffing mix that I crushed in a bag with a marble rolling pin to the consistency of bread crumbs. Added some garlic powder to the salt and pepper with the flour, and skipped the paprika as I thought it would not work with the stuffing seasoning. used a little less oil and let the coating rest before putting it into the oil. I also used skinless, boneless thighs, which cooked faster. It came out very crisp. A little of the stuffing stuck to the bottom of the pan on a couple of the thighs, but not much, and the chicken was moist and flavorful. Smelled great cooking - my husband could not wait to eat!

Great healthier alternative to fried chicken (which is my weakness) to feed to my kids. We substitute the Italian bread crumbs for regular bread crumbs but as some of the reviews have noted, seasoning is key so we season our bread crumbs (we usually use Garlic Powder, Garlic Salt, Salt & Pepper as well as Onion Powder).  We also season our flour with at least salt & pepper. This is a BIG hit in my house.

This chicken was fabulous.  I made it once and then my family asked for it again 2 days later.  I did add some garlic seasoning and refrained from the oil.  I just sprayed the glass pan and the chicken both wil Olive oil PAM and it was wonderful!

i was reading some of the other reviews and i had seen a quite of few people say that their chicken was soggy and stuck to the pan... well let me tell you i followed this recipe to the T. except i accidently combined the flour and the bread crumbs together, so i used it anyway and i coated my chicken and then dipped in egg then coated my chicken in just bread crumbs put it all in a cast iron skillet and it was TERRIFIC. it was so good i dont thing there is a word for it:) i love it and will always make my chicken like this again:) thanks for the super recipe!

This was really good. I used seasoned leg/thigh pieces for this recipe.  I added dry ranch dressing mix to the flour and some milk to the eggs and I used Pam and 1/4 cup melted butter in the pan.  I put the flour, egg mixture and bread crumbs in three separate baggies and it worked really well for coating and the cleanup was super easy. I baked it at 350 for 50 minutes and then at 400 for about 5 more minutes.

I used baggies to flour & coat the meat, and served over spaghetti noodles with marinara sauce.  My family can't get enough. Yum Yum Yummy!

This a really easy and delicious recipe.  I had trouble with the breading falling off during cooking.  Read a review that said to let it "rest" before baking.  Will try that next time.

This was awesome! The crust was nice and crisp and the chicken came out so moist and flavourful (I marinated the thighs for a while before making them.) I didn't use the paprika at all because I didn't have any so I drizzled a bit of pepper sauce over the thighs, it added such a nice kick! I will defitnitely be making this again. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Easy and good!  I cut out the veggie oil sprayed pan with cooking spray, and drizzled bottom with olive oil to cut down on calories and fat.  Used chicken breast tenders instead of dark meat.  Also didn't have italian seasoned crumbes so I took the breadcrumbs I had on hand and mixed with Italian seasoning to taste.

This was really good and fairly simple to make.  The chicken was really moist and tender but a little on the greasy side.  I went ahead and used the full 1/2 cup of oil called for in the recipe because I took the skin off the chicken but I think you could probably make do with a little less oil.  I cooked it about 35 minutes on each side which was just right. Probably would have had to cook a little longer if I hadn't used 2 dishes as recommended by another reviewer.  I used onion salt and garlic salt in the flour and skipped the paprika because I am not a paprika fan.  I will probably make this again.  My family gave it a thumbs up!

needed more spices; garlic, italian seasoning in bread crumbs.  Use boneless thighs or breasts or drumsticks.

Used pam cooking spray as suggested, but did everything else as directed.  Just okay for us, nothing too special.  For those of you more creative than me, I'm sure this would be a great base recipe for more exotic flavors.  Thanks.

The only change I made was that I used legs instead of thighs. All 3 of my kids ate every bit. Husband thought it was pretty good. Yes, it was a bit greasy, it is oven "fried" chicken,so I didn't think the greasiness was too bad, but in the future I will probably cut the amount of oil in some way.

Very good recipe.  To cut down on the grease I substituted butter for half of the oil.  And instead of italian seasoned bread crumbs I mixed plain bread crumbs with Adobo.  Will make again.  Thanks!

A very easy and relatively mess-free recipe for fried chicken. I liked it the first time, but here's a great tip which made my second try even better: marinate the chicken in your favorite marinade (I used Italian dressing) for at least 2 hours in the refrigerator, preferably overnight. For those who like an extra kick, add about a teaspoon of hot sauce to the beaten eggs.

I baked 4 thighs and 5 legs at 400o for 50 minutes (the family was starving!) and they were done perfectly.  This is a tasty and EASY recipe.  I will certainly make this again.  When they were finished baking, I put them on a brown grocery bag (to drain a little of the oil) on a baking sheet and put them back in the turned-off oven to keep them warm until the rest of the meal was complete.

One of the best homemade fried chicken recipes I have tried.  I used drumsticks instead and only 2 eggs and it still came out great.  I put the flour and breadcrumbs each into a seperate bag and tossed the chicken in to coat and saved even more mess.  I may add more spices to the coating next time but it was excellent.
Very little mess and requires very little attention.  My kind of recipe with 3 kids under 3!  All three and hubby loved it!

I was very happy with the way this chicken came out.  My whole family liked it!  It was very juicy.  I normally don't care for fried chicken as a leftover meal but this even tasted great reheated!

I was not very impressed with this recipe. As I was turning the chicken, the coating seemed to break apart and fall off.  I used legs instead of thighs, and that may have had something to do with it. I think I may try it again because the chicken, although not very attractive once the coating came off, was pretty good. I was a bit disappointed, but my husband liked it.

I skipped the oil and just sprayed the pan. I did use some fresh corn meal instead of flour. Super crunchy and super moist! It all was eaten up. Will use again.

Simply DELICIOUS!  I read some of the past reviews and took some tips and tricks from them.  I used just enough olive oil to cover the bottom of the baking dish.  I added Tapatio to my egg wash.  I cut half the flour and replaced it with Ranch dressing mix (the powder stuff).  I let the flour sit about five minutes before doing the egg wash.  I used plastic bags for both the flour and the bread crumbs.  I used Panko instead of regular bread crumbs.  I sprinkled garlic salt, black pepper and some paprika on the drumsticks at the onset of the baking.  I had the glass casserole dish in the oven preheating with the oil in it as I prepped the drumsticks.  Thanks to all who shared all of those tips.  This was my first time making these but it won't be my last!

YUM!! This is so delicious and easy! My family enjoyed it very much!! I "oven fried" them at 350 (actual temp is 375) in my convection oven for about 30-40 minutes and didn't have to flip them! I put the flour and spices in a plastic bag to coat the chicken with less mess.  The thighs were so moist and juicy and it wasn't greasy!! I will definitely be making this again.  Thank you!!

The only thing I changed was instead of using vegetable oil I lightly greased the aluminum foil with olive oil, my husband loved it

I like the recipe very much, but I ended up having too much flour and too few breadcrumbs using the amounts specified.

I make my oven baked chicken in a similar way.   But use Bisquick and bread crumbs.   You don't really need to use so much oil.   Just a little to lightly coat pan.   The chicken releases a lot of grease from the skin and fat.   I love fixing chicken this way.

I would give this recipe a 5 but not until a little love was added to the seasoning.  All by itself, this recipe is pretty bland. Changes I made: I melted 2 T butter and put it into the pan and added a splash of olive oil--1/2 c of oil is atrocious!  I trimmed the chicken skin and fat way down on my chicken thighs. For seasoning, I soaked my chicken in buttermilk for 1/2 hour before coating (drained and patted dry before dredging). To the flour I added paprika, garlic salt and pepper.  I added a little water to my egg. For step 3, I used 1 c panko, 1 c seasoned regular bread crumbs and a handful of parmesan cheese.  As another reviewer did, after coating, I placed my chicken skin side down. I baked at 400 for 30 minutes, turned the chicken over (best to use a spatula for this) and cooked for an additional 20 minutes. Biggest tip?  Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes before serving. It'll make a difference for the coating to adhere to the thigh.

The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5, was because I didn't do the recipe exactly as published.  I read many of the reviews and tweaked it a little.  But overall, hubby and I were both impressed.  The chicken was moist inside and crunchy outside.  I did cook it a little longer than it said.  I used less oil, just enough to cover the pan.  I did add milk to the eggs and some hot sauce.  I did run out of bread crumbs however, but just added more.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This is a great basic recipe.   I used chicken thighs, seasoned  the chicken with salt and pepper and Cajun seasoning.  Then dredged in flour seasoned with Cajun seasoning, onion flakes, garlic powder and pepper.   But you can season it to your taste with any combination you like.  Then dipped in a buttermilk egg mixture and lastly in a Panko, Italian bread crumb mix.  I did put it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes after coating.  Sprayed the glass baking dish with cooking spray and melted a tbsp. of butter in it.  Baked for 30 minutes in a 350 degree oven, turned the chicken over and broiled to crisp the skin until internal temperature  reached 165 degrees.  The chicken was crispy and delicious.  Served mashed potatoes with gravy made from the pan drippings.  Thanks for sharing this simple but delicious recipe.

My family loved this recipe! The only thing that I recommend is adding milk to the egg because 3 eggs are not enough to adequately dip all the chicken in. And I also suggest putting it skin side down the first half hour

This turned out extremely greasy and soggy. It actually turned my stomach. I used only a very small coating of oil on the bottom of the pan, but it didn't matter. Even after taking it out when it was finished and draining it on paper towels, it stayed soggy. Next time, I'll turn the temp up on the oven and heat the pan with the oil in it on its own first, to see if that will help.

Took hints from others and the photo. The cookie screen on a baking pan means you don't have to turn it. Seasoned the flour dredge with Mrs Dash®, added a bit of milk to the eggs. Used half panko/half Italian bread crumbs, to which I added onion powder, garlic powder, and paprika. Sprayed the screen and pan with Pam®, placed the coated drumsticks on the screen and stuck the whole thing in the refrigerator for an hour. Baked at 375ºF for an hour. Wonderful crust, chicken was thoroughly cooked and not greasy at all.

I used butter instead of grease. It came out a bit greasy even after it sat on a paper towel to drain, but I used the Nuwave oven to dry it out and it was perfect.  I also cooked a piece in the Nuwave oven using the same directions but cooked it for 30 minutes and it also came out perfect. I think I will be frying chicken in the Nuwave from now on.

I have made it. and its superb. crispy outside, juicy inside. One thing I have changed after reading so many reviews that they experienced oily. so I used 1/4 cup+2 tbsp oil instead of 1/2 cup oil. I will cook it again and again.

As Mario Batelli says you must season each dip. To the flour I added kosher salt and fresh cracked pepper and garlic powder. to the egg I added paprika, chili pepper, dried rosemary and Thyme. To the panko bread I added a little more salt & pepper and paprika. 
This was delicious and flavored through out, which what I normally don't like about fried chicken. You add more chili pepper for a kick or none at all. As far as how much, I just added a pinch of that and a dab of that.

Just made this for our Sunday dinner, it was delicious! I made my own breadcrumbs and used cut up boneless chicken breasts instead of thighs, which shortened the baking time. Everyone in my family loved this delicious recipe.

Very good! Definitely a keeper. Didn't have seasoned bread crumbs on hand so I tried making my own -- not very flavorful. I'm sure it will be better next time with the right bread crumbs.

This was delicious! I added creole seasoning to the flour and Mrs. Dash and salt to the egg, I also didn't measure the oil, instead I just coated the bottom of each pan... If I had to guess I'd say I used closer to 1/3 cup of oil. Family loved it and I loved the ease of it. This recipe was definitely an instant hit! Thanks!

Just made this. My whole family loved it. Used Panko instead of seasoned bread crumbs since I was serving it with seasoned rice. A bit greasy for me so I may reduce the oil next time. But there is going yo be a next time :)

I didn't find the breading stuck to the chicken as well as I would have liked. It never crisped up the way I had hoped it would. The meat was pleasantly moist and tender, though.

Appointment much easier and better tasting than pan frying!! I add some vanilla flavored coffee creamer to my eggs for a hint of sweetness. I also remove the skin first so the chicken gets crispier. This is officially my one and only fried chicken recipe. I sometimes add some grated parmesan to the breadcrumbs.

Was an ok recipe, till I read the amount of oil in the bottom of the pan. Seasoned and breaded almost to the recipe, but with more spices. Then I cover the bottom of a high lipped sheet pan with oil (just barely), put a baking rack in the pan, spray with Pam, then place the chicken on the rack. Baked at 350', flip after 20 minutes, maybe 20 minutes (I bake by smell) later,turn off the oven, flip again - but leave in until all side dishes are done. Serve hot.

Love the idea, but made a couple of changes.........added 2tsp of garlic powder and 2tsp onion powder to flour and used coconut oil instead of veg oil. OMGoodness, delicious and non-greasy, crispy tenders.....my son and husband loved so much, they asked again for them the following night. Will share and pass along to family and friends....yummy and healthy :o)

I've made this recipe a couple times with excellent results.  Used ziplock baggies for the flour, egg and breadcrumbs for easier cleanup in my tiny kitchen.  I used olive oil because it was what I had on hand today.  Served with a nice garlic mashed potato and fried okra.  Easy and delicious.

I made this last night with drum sticks. I melted a stick of butter in a 9x12 Pyrex instead of oil. My husband, who is always tired of chicken, loved it. Everyone from my teenagers to my toddler loved it. The only think I did different is I added paprika, salt and pepper to the flour, milk to the egg and garlic and onion powders to the Italian bread crumbs. Dinner was great and leftovers were too! My husband took some to work to share for lunch and it got rave reviews. I will definitely make it again. Soon.

My husband loved this.  I loved the easy cleanup.  I thought it lacked some flavor or spice but not sure what I would add.. maybe more salt next time.

My family loved it. I did use the spray for the pan and just two Tab. of oil instead of 1/2 cup. Freezer bag for the flour so grandson could help (less mess). The chicken is also great cold .Will make a great picnic  dish for summer.

VERY GOOD, TENDER & MOIST CHICKEN. I ADDED A LOT MORE SPICE TO THE FLOUR. I HAD ALOT OF EGG LEFTOVER, MAYBE TWO EGGS WOULD BE ENOUGH WITH A LITTLE MILK. I USED SOME MEATY CHICKEN LEGS ALONG WITH THE THIGHS, AND WOULD DEFINITLY USE A ZIPLOCK BAG FOR THE DRY INGREDIENTS, LESS CLEANUP THAT WAY. NOTHING BEATS REAL FRIED CHICKEN, BUT THIS WAS VERY GOOD.

I use this basic recipe, but instead of an egg wash, coat the chicken with mayonnaise and then coat with breadcrumbs. Very good!

This is an easy to make recipe. I used ziploc bags for the flour and bread crumbs. I did as some of the other reviewers suggested and split the chicken into two pans and did not use the oil. I sprayed my pans. My family loved the chicken. This was a nice, flavorful addition to our new year's dinner. I will definitely use this recipe again.

This recipe was awful. Nobody in my family liked it. I did use wing sections. Thought it was going to be great. Tasted blah and tough. Never agian. Of course I did use pam instead of oil so maybe that was my mistake.

Maybe it's just a matter of taste since other people liked this recipe, but no one in our family liked it at all. I cooked it according to directions except that I used chicken drumsticks and I used butter instead of oil. It took longer to cook than 60 minutes, maybe because of the drumsticks. We found it to be too greasy,  and the flavor was very blah. I didn't even bother saving the leftovers since no one wanted any more.

Wow. When I followed the advice of reviewers in augmenting this recipe the results were awful. I'll give it 3 stars because I didn't follow the original recipe exactly. I added panko crumbs to my bread crumbs (wouldn't do that again), substituted PAM for the oil in the dish, added a splash of milk to the eggs, and baked for 30 minutes on 350 degrees, then 30 minutes on 375 degrees. The coating didn't crisp up much and looked visually unappealing.  The meat was done, but tough and difficult to remove from the bone.

My boyfriend and I made a competition of this, and he deep-fried regularly  two of the drumsticks to compare.  His were light-years better and what fried chicken should be! This oven-fried attempt didn't stand up in any way. In the past I've used the Oven Fry (Kraft brand?) box sold at the store and like it. But won't be trying any variation of this particular recipe again.

We all liked this alot.  I too added more spices to the flour mixture - seasoning salt, garlic powder, red pepper.  I didn't use oil, just sprayed a thick coat of Pam on the bottom of the dish AND each piece of chicken after the coating was on.  It crisped up real good.

This is really good oven fried chicken. Growing up eating fried chicken 2-3 times a week and as an adult maybe 3 times a year. This was a nice treat, not complete flavor of fried chicken but crisp and close. My husband loved it. Kids loved it ecspecially the drumsticks.

This is pretty good.  The chicken turned out super moist.  The breading was OK - I'm thinking next time I might try crushed cornflakes mixed in with the bread crumbs.  It is SO much easier than frying chicken on the stove top.  I had HUGE thighs, and I needed at least 3 cups of bread crumbs and 4 eggs,  although I only needed one cup of flour.  Some of the underside of the thighs doesnt fry up as well because it is not all touching the oil as it cooks.  I used the suggestion of another reviewer and shook the chicken in a bag with the flour, then emptied it and shook it in the bread crums after dipping in egg.  Overall very good and will defn make again.

Tried it with other parts of chicken and was still just as great. Easy to make and delicious.

This worked really well for us.  Changes: I used half the oil and only 2 eggs w/ some milk for about 10 drumsticks in a 13x9 pan.

Made this with skinless boneless chicken thighs.  Followed the suggestion of others and baked on a rack.  Changes: dotted the top of thighs with butter before baking, added hot sauce to the egg wash.  Chicken was delicious and moist with a crispy coating.

Exactly what I was looking for in an oven fried chicken recipe. I swapped out the Italian bread crumbs for crushed cornflakes, and it worked just as well. Delicious!

This recipe was wonderful!!!! I love fried chicken and this is the easiest closest thing to it. I added my own special seasonings and it tastes almost just like my fried chicken. I will use this recipe for my pork chops and see how it turns out!!!

simple and easy. I just added garlic powder, black pepper, and lawrys salt to the flour.. everything else was the same.. oh.. and mooore than enough paprika..  I let the boyfriend take the first bite.  The first thing he said was, "Mmmm, it's so juicy!  We should make this all the time!"  There it is.  Going into my permanent file.

This came out pretty good. I mixed panko breadcrumbs with regular bread crumbs. I think the combination made the chicken very crunchy on most parts of the chicken. However, the side the chicken was laying on for the last hour of cooking came out a bit soggy and not too crispy. Kids and hubbystill liked it  . Much easier to make than fried chicken.

Fantastic, I added panko, to the bread crumbs in a 2 to 1 ratio,as well as added garlic pepper and opted to cook the chicken on sprayed rack above a lined pan for easy clean up, you wouldn"t have known it was mae in the oven> It was a huge hit!!

Much better than I expected. Kids loved it and they are 2 and 1 year(s) old. I did as another reviewer did and lined the pan with foil, sprayed it with cooking spray and cooked the chicken on a baking rack set in the pan. Chicken was juicy and tender with a crispy crust. Will definitely make again.

This chicken was honestly too greasy and tasteless. I think if you stick to the same recipe but add some lemon pepper and fry it on the stove it would come out much crispier and tasty rather than soggy and tasteless

I didn't have italian seasoned breadcrumbs so it probably could've been better but all in all it was very good. Though I cut the oil in half so it wasn't as greasy and it still came out great. Nice and crispy with nice juicy chicken!

I am horrible at making fried chicken so I tried this. Yay! I can make chicken and my new husband and my daughter absolutely loved it. I think next time we will sprinkle lemon pepper on at the end instead of the paprika, but the recipe is great as is.  Nice thing is that during the hour it bakes, you can throw something else in the oven too. Makes for a nice easy dinner.

I thought this was just ok.  I did use the spray instead of the oil & I used drumsticks.  The first drumstick was so bland to me, but I didn't really eat much of the skin that had the breading on it.  The second drumstick that I ate I did eat the skin with breading and it had more flavor, but still, not as much as my family would like.  Just . . . ok.

This was super easy.  I sprayed the pan instead of using oil.  Also, I tried saltine crackers instead of bread crumbs on a few of the thighs since I was running out of bread crumbs.  I mixed the saltine crackers with a little seasoning and it tasted amazing.

Great recipe.  We made this for ten poeple.  We cooked it for about fifteen minutes longer than the recipe called for because we used quarters and they turned out perfect.  Next time I will try it without skin.

I took other reviewer's advice and used non-stick spray instead of olive oil. But by doing that, I don't think my chicken was "fried" enough. A lot of the breadcrumbs were "uncooked" and the dish didn't seem entirely like fried chicken. Still, it was plenty tasty and was especially good as leftovers the next day.

The first thing my boyfriends said was "this has to be fried".  This turned out really well.  I cut the recipe and used drumsticks instead of thighs, which worked fine, and since I didn't have the italian breadcrumbs, I added some seasoning in with the flower.  Overall this turned out really well, and I was able to serve it hot and cold.

Outstanding....could not find an old family recipe and this was the closest to it.  Used spray oil in the pan.  Thanks so much for bringing back a great memory for me and my family.

This recipe was very easy, but the meat was extremely dry. I followed recipe exactly, but the chicken was dry and tasteless.

Awesome idea.  The skin melts away and leaves a crunchy coating, no doubt because I used a rack and the bird did not sit in their own grease.  I put 5 different dried spices in the flour, my own taste, and used seasoned bread crumbs.  I used a throw away roaster pan, curved the sides up so no grease in my oven from splatter and no greasy chicken.  Tastes fried, no kidding.

Only issue I have us that sometimes some of the breading sticks to the pan, even with the oil. Otherwise, really good, really easy recipe.   I've made this twice, the first as is, the second with alterations. My version included spices that I like in the breadcrumbs (paprika, onion powder, chili powder, salt and black pepper) and instead of using eggs for cohesion I used a marinade I had at home. Both versions were excellent, but the second just suited my tastes better.

Followed the directions almost exactly. I followed other suggestions and added about 1 tsp of hot sauce to the egg mixture and used butter instead of vegetable oil because that's what I had on hand. Definitely make sure each piece of chicken has room in the pan. I was worried it was not going to be crispy but it was crispy, moist and flavorful. My husband loved this!

This was delicious! I made exactly as written with the exception of a few extra spices I threw into the flour and bread crumbs. The BEST oven fried chicken yet. Works great for chicken strips.  Thank you for sharing this :)

This was a great alternative to traditional fried chicken. I used legs and thighs and substituted panko breadcrumbs instead of regular bread crumbs. I also used butter in place of the oil. I will certainly make this again

This turned out delicious!  Next time will use skinless chicken breasts, the skin was kind of a turn off.  Also sprayed the pan like another reviewer suggested. I added Garlic powder and onion powder and also mixed the bread crumbs 1/2 panko and 1/2 italian seasoned bread crumbs.  Will definitely make again!

Meh. It was just all right for me. I used tenderloins instead of thighs, so I reduced the cooking time. I think because of that, the breading didn't get crispy enough. It was really easy though!

This was really, really good.  Many of the recipes on here with great ratings end up disappointing me, but this one definitely did not.  I didn't have bread crumbs so I used crushed corn flakes instead, and seasoned it with Lawry's Seasoning salt instead of italian.  Put plenty of salt and pepper in the flour and sprinkled with paprika as recipe says, and it was great. And it is not just a good alternative to fried chicken, it actually tastes like fried chicken, the oil on the bottom of the dish is very smart.  Thanks for this recipe!

This chicken is amazing! I only make two chicken breasts at a time, so I use less of everything. My husband now asks me to make extra every time I make it so that he can take it to work for lunch. AWESOME!

The chicken didn't seem to be getting crispy in the baking dish. So I did move it from the baking dish to a cookie sheet sprayed with cooking spray halfway through the cooking process. I turned the chicken regularly so it would get crispy all over. I used a package of Legs and my husband and kids gobbled it up! Great Flavor. I'll make this again.

First time I've made 'Fried' Chicken & it was to die for! So juicy & falling off the bone good. My husband and I served it with green beans and mashed potatoes. If your looking for a way to use chicken thighs and feed a family on the cheap, this is perfect for you! Thx for sharing.

This was pretty good and easy. It wasn't as crispy as I would have liked it, but it had great flavor. I did add some cayenne pepper to the flour to give it a little kick...I think next time I'll add it to the egg.

We will use this one again!  It was so easy and very tasty.  I modified it by using lemon pepper before flouring and then used panko (japanese style bread crumbs).  It turned out great and way healthier than plain ole fried chicken.

Thanks!

This recipe is good, but I don't know what I do wrong.  Every time I make it (or similar recipes), it doesn't come out crispy, it comes out more soggy and the breading all falls off.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and used a pan spray instead of oil as well.

This chicken was awesome!  It came out very tender and juicy.  I especially loved the fried chicken texture and taste without having to actually fry it. Thanks for the recipe.

I thought the chicken was just ok but my kids really liked it. The chicken soaked up a lot of the oil which tasted more greasy to me than crispy.

I added a pkg of Ranch Dressing Mix to the 1 cup of flour.  I also used PAM in one batch and for another batch I just coated the pan with olive oil.  Both tasted great.

This is a good basic recipe.  Like the others I made changes, but I believe this is more of a method than a recipe, so I made it my own and it was great.  Chicken came out tender and moist.  Thanks

I used dried tomato and oregano salad dressing mixed with the egg and I used Japanese panko crumbs instead of bread crumbs.
I preheated the oil as was suggested in another review.
It is oily BUT then - it IS fried chicken.  We were pleased with the taste of the coating.
Overall - very easy to make and I'll do it again.

This was great! I added extra spices to the flour, garlic,onion powder,& parsley. Then I added a little evap. milk to the eggs for richness.Then used italian crumbs w/extran Italian seasoning. Be sure to use a glass baking dish, it adds to the crispness! I doubled this and used 1 glass & 1 metal the glass won out! Thank You for sharing your recipe!

This recipe is a family favorite.  I mixed 1 teaspoon each of poultry seasoning, paprika, creole seasoning, thyme and sage.  Then added 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper and salt and pepper to taste in a bowl.  I poured the spices over the boneless, skinless chicken thighs then dredged the thighs in flour and followed the recipe.  This makes a savory recipe that is spicey, but not hot.

This is a tasty, down home type meal.  In an attempt to perfect it, I've made it a few times over the past 2 months.  My family agrees with the other reviewers that the coating is a bit bland, but that is easily fixed!  In fact, the first time I followed the recipe to a "T" and my husband asked me if it was "Shake and Bake."  The horror!  I've made my way to using a mix of basic bread crumbs and corn flake crumbs spiked with 1 teaspoon (sometimes more) of each of the following:  poultry seasoning, paprika, Cajun seasoning, thyme, sage, salt, and pepper.   With my oven, it's best to cook it for 80 minutes (40 on each side) at 375 - that way the coating ends up crispy.   We used a combination of chicken thighs, legs, and breasts. To cut down on the calories, I used an egg substitute and eliminated the oil completely.  Instead I spray the pan liberally with PAM.   Definately something I'll make again.

This chicken was really tasty.  I marinated the thighs in italian dressing for 1/2 an hour before dipping and baking.  I also used cooking spray instead of vegetable oil. I would make this again.

This was pretty good - not having to deal with the mess of frying was very nice.  I was hoping for something a little crunchier, but the chicken disappeared so I won't complain. I used drumsticks instead of thighs and so reduced the cooking time a bit which made it even faster.

What a great recipe! Yum!! I used crushed corn flakes and jazzed them up with some garlic,parsley flakes and pepper. You just can't go wrong with this recipe. I did turn up the oven to 400 degrees after having it in the oven for 30 mins, just to make sure it was all the way done.  Thanks

To make this dish healthier, I used wheat flour, used a cooking spray instead of oil. The crumbs were just as crunchy and the chicken was SO juicy. I also padded the chicken dry before covering it with flour and added teriyaki sauce to the eggs. Instead of salt I used garlic salt to the flour.  Mmmmm...

I made this the night before with skinless, boneless thigh pieces. We took it cold for a picnic.  This was THE BEST oven fried chicken! Everyone was just nuts over it! This will become a regular item on our monthly menu!

I used boneless breasts and cut them into strips.  The teenage boys loved it and then they could dunk into sauce.  Have made it several times since.

I'm just finishing a piece of chicken, and it's delicious!  I didn't have bread crumbs, seasoned or otherwise, so I made my own with French bread and Italian seasoning and the blender...it worked great, but I think I was a little heavy handed with the seasoning.  I also skinned the thighs and sprayed the pan to eliminate the oil. I'm looking forward to tomorrow's leftovers!

I wasn't very happy with the way this one turned out.  There wasn't much flavor to the chicken and about half of the pieces lost their breading.  The breading was very good but that was about the only thing it has going for it.

We love fried chicken but not the work so this is a great recipe, also did potatoe wedges at the same time with the same batter and it came out great. Thank you all recipes for your support in finding recipes at our fingertips. Laura

I enjoyed making this quick dinner and easy clean up!  we love fried chicken and it did not seem  fatty and greasy.  although, i added about half the oil the recipe asked for and then added the other half water. it turned out wonderful and my husband took the leftovers to work the next day. i wrote this recipe in my recipe book !

The chicken was tender, but none of us liked the bread crumb texture or flavor.  Plus I think of fried chicken with crisp skins and these were soggy.

This is a very tasty recipe.  Here are the changes I made though.  First, I marinade the chicken in salt, a little vinegar, and some rice wine.  Next, I didn't used flour, I just dip the chicken in eggs and then coat with bread crumbs.  Overall, this recipe will satisfy many people.

I really expected more from this recipe and was very disappointed.  The skin on the chicken tasted like your standard shake and bake.  And it wasn't crispy at all nor very flavorful.  I took the skin off the thighs before coating.  Maybe that's why it wasn't crisp?

It was easy and tasted great!  We just had to add more eggs and bread crumbs than the recipe called for, and we cooked it an extra 22 minutes longer than the recipe said, and it was still tender, juicy and cooked through

The chicken came out so good . I did use the Olive Oil and use more spices to give it a little more pop and kick. But followed the rest of the directions . So Good.

Excellent recipe - crispy, incredibly tender chicken legs. Didn't use paprika. Used 1/2 cup regular bread crumbs and 1/2 cup panko with italian seasoning, garlic, salt, pepper. Reduced oil to just enough to cover the bottom of the pans.

Pretty boring.  Not bad if you choose to spice it up a bit.  I think it was better using cooking spray rather than so much oil.

I actually put 1/2 italian style bread crumbs and the other half regular bread crumbs and omitted the salt...I am very sensitive to sodium and it also put 1/3 - 1/2 of oil, and it came out really good!

Just as messy as traditional fried Chicken.  However, this recipe works well and, depending on type and flavor of bread crumbs used produces a flavorful delight to be enjoyed by all.

Delicious and easy to make.  I made mine gluten-free using unseasoned bread crumbs in which I added Italian seasoning, and almond flour adding salt and pepper.  Otherwise the recipe was the same and even my kid likes it.  Will definitely make it again.

This was amazing!! Tastes like deep fried chicken without all the oil and mess and leftover smell !  Less fat eaten as well. Dare I say its like.....even better than a certain colonel's fried chicken from Kentucky!  I served mine with green beans and quinoa.

I made the recipe exactly as written. My husband enjoyed having a different flavor profile, while I prefer more traditional seasoning.  I will make oven fried chicken again using this technique but without the Italian accents.

I loved this recipe and just made it today. I find this to be a healthier and cleaner version of fried chicken. When I made this I seasoned my chicken to my liking then I followed the instructions. I would also recommend you seasoning the bread crumbs or sprinkling more than just paprika on the top. I sprinkled season salt on top of mine and I loved it.

I made this exactly as written and the flavor was good but the texture was mushy and when I flipped the chicken halfway through cooking half of the breading fell off.

Very easy recipe for oven fried chicken and it was delicious! I used chicken drumsticks and the chicken was very moist. I think I will what others have done next time by spraying the pan rather than use the oil. I will definitely make it again!

I made this using more Italian bread crumbs than flour. I initially sprayed the pan as others said and then at the 30 min mark added olive oil to the pan. I served this over pasta with marinara sauce and sprinkled parmesan cheese over it. My husband who claimed to not be hungry kept asking for bites of mine lol  Will make again!

Great gluten free, too. First I seasoned the chicken with 1\4 teaspoon garlic, 1\2 teaspoon salt, 1\2 teaspoon black pepper and 1\4 teaspoon paprika. Then I  used Bob's mills gluten free flour blend and I added a 1\4 teaspoon paprika, 1\4 teaspoon garlic,  and 1\4 teaspoon of salt.  Then, I used gluten free breadcrumbs.  I seasoned the breadcrumbs with McCormick 's Italian seasoning, 1 1\2 tablespoons and I added a 1\4 teaspoon garlic powder to the breadcrumbs.  I followed other suggestions and put a few pats of smart balance butter in a pan lined with parchment  paper.  I cooked mine for longer,  1.5 hours, but everything was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Also flavorful because the seasoning was on the chicken and the coating. Great recipe??!

I followed the recipe and found that there is much work or mess, as frying chicken the conventional way and it doesn't come close to it. 

The only difference is dealing with the frying oil when frying chicken.

If you're looking for easier, this recipe isn't it.

I followed your basic instructions, but I used chicken wings, sprinkled some Tony Chachere's over the bread crumbs. Also I split a stick of butter between 2 pans and melted in the  oven. Let the chicken sit in the fridge about 20 minutes. Final results - 
Mmm mmm good. Will be cooking my chicken like this from now on. I have done fish filets like this but was afraid of having soggy chicken. No such thing  - delicious.

Only cooked 6 chicken thighs and used 1/4 cup vegetable oil.  Very tender inside and crispy breading outside.  I cooked for a total of 45 minutes.  Just right.

very tasty but despite using foil and spraying it with vegetable spray, I had sticking.  My crust also fell off on some pieces, not all.  Used both breasts (which I put in to cook earlier than thighs) and thighs. I would try again because it was flavorful.

It has a good taste. I only had panko bread crumbs so will try again with regular crumbs to get a different texture. The one change that I made was to use seasoned flour. It wasn’t greasy at all as others mentioned. In fact, a couple of pieces were too dry.

The taste was great, the skin was delicious! I may skip the flour step next time I make it though. The skin peeled off a bit too easily, or maybe I'll just use more/less oil I'm not sure. The recipe was great (oh! I did add seasoning salt to the flour and salt and pepper and cayenne pepper -- for paprika, I mean. But it wasn't a big difference I think)

we really enjoyed this. I lined the dish with parchment paper. used half panko half flour for the dry dredge, half a cup of oil and two TBL butter. I also used a spoon to baste the top right at the end to help crisp everything up. added dry thyme onion powder and garlic powder.

This recipe is amazing!! I used drumsticks and bone in thighs. I added the paprika to the flour mixture instead, and also added garlic powder (I add garlic to everything!). Everything else I kept the same. So so tasty and juicy!! The whole family was raving about it!

Next time I will use more spice.

I tweaked it after reading different reviews...it did turn out delicious!  Pretty too!  After coating the chicken, I did put on a metal rack over a pan and let sit in the refrigerator for 15 minutes.   I do believe it kept the crust on better.  I also used butter to coat the glass dish covered with aluminium foil, so the clean up was a breeze!

I made this recipe and honestly I found it bland. I also used drumsticks as I find thighs too greasy. On the positive side I liked that it came out juicy but not too dry or greasy. My trick for keeping the coating on is to pat dry the chicken before doing the dredging. Next time, I might do apply some of the suggestions others made to see if it comes out with a bit more flavor.

The chicken was very juicy and tender but the breading and skin were soggy.   I even put it under the broiler for a few minutes to try to crisp it up but that didn’t work. I won’t use this again .

Although the outside was crispy, it was greasy  and also thought the chicken itself was a bit tasteless - needs some kind of seasoning.

I didn't use oil I just sprayed the pan with non-stick spray and the chicken was very moist. My family wasn't a fan of the coating, reminded me of shake-n-bake.

I've made this several times with all types of chicken.  It's best with big drumsticks.  Easy to pull the skin off of them with a paper towel.  I've made it as directed with a copper chef pan with the grated basket in the oven and it makes it crispy on all sides.  I've even tried soaking in buttermilk with some paprika and liquid smoke and letting it come to room temperature before using the bread crumbs. You can make so many variations of this recipe with different seasonings that are all tasty. Our favorite oven fried chicken.

Love this recipe! The second time,  I did add more seasoning for extra flavor and used less oil.  But either way is great! The chicken is very crispy and flavorful.

Added my own spices and used less than the recommended oil.  Also, lining the pan with foil kept the chicken crispy on the outside and juicy inside.

This recipe is a winner. I use it for legs and thighs and it makes for tasty satisfying chicken. I always need more egg, flour, and bread crumbs than suggested. I add the paprika into the flour with the salt and pepper. Since I ran out of Hungarian paprika, I used smoked this time.

This was an easy recipe. I used chicken legs instead of thighs, and two pans with 1/2 cup oil in each. I put salt & pepper in the flour, and had seasoned bread crumbs as well. A perfect cook on the breading, drained on paper towel after it was done, not greasy, very crispy, but the breading was bland. Next time I will add more salt & some garlic powder or spice to the flour as well to season it up a bit.

It was nice and crispy but I did use butter instead of oil. I only coated the top of the chicken with the melted butter.

I just glanced at the recipe then threw it in the oven and came back to read the reviews.  I saw a few that said it was greasy which I didn't understand because I didn't use any oil at all.  Reread the recipe and saw I missed something, I didn't put oil in the pan.  I used a cookie sheet covered in aluminum foil and then a piece of parchment paper.  I went back and spritzed a little oil with a sprayer and finished cooking.  Turned out great!  Not greasy at all with very little added oil.  Easy clean up too.

A simple, delicious, moist/tender product comes from this recipe.  My husband, who makes the best fried chicken ever, raved about the recipe.  The chicken was marinated in buttermilk for several hours and I  did add the spices that suit my family best to the bread crumbs--used Pam for the baking dish (with a couple of tablespoon of butter).  It is a pleasure to have "fried" chicken without the huge kitchen mess that's usually involved.  This is a keeper!!

Half of the coating stuck to the pan. Otherwise, the chicken was nice and moist. I had to improvise somewhat with the bread crumbs since they were plain, so added a few spices along with Italian seasoning to panto bread crumbs. (Was wondering if that's why it stuck to the pan, using panto instead of regular bread crumbs? Probably.) I halved the recipe with only two of us eating tonight but still needed a cup of the bread crumbs to coat 6 chicken thighs. I took pictures to show why you should probably not substitute with panto bread crumbs.

Yet another great  easy recipe I found here  that my family loves!! With a picky 12 year old this brought nothing but smiles and asking me to make it again and again...

Personally I don't get excited about chicken, but this is really tasty and if this Dad can make anyone can! Enjoy ; )

We enjoyed this. I used boneless chicken thighs that I soaked in milk and hot sauce for a couple of  hours.  Drained and patted the chicken dry then followed the recipe.   Did not use the oil, just sprayed the pan with Pam and also sprayed the chicken with a little Pam.

I had lots of flour left over but didn't have enough bread crumbs.  The chicken was rather bland so next time I'll add seasonings to the flour.  The chicken was beautiful, cooked as the recipe stated, so I'd hate to add seasonings and alter the look.  The cooking method was spectacular, thus the four stars even though the ingredients weren't exactly right.  One would definitely NOT want to omit the oil and use pan spray or this would be just another baked chicken.

Great recipe. I loved the ease of this. Slight modification--I added Italian salad dressing (the kind in the envelope) to the flour and also had to split the chicken across two pans. Muah.

1/2 cup of oil was way too much.  Chicken was cooked properly with temp and time, but came out greasy and ruined the breading. For the breading I added buttermilk prior to the flour. Would have been perfect if not so oily.  Thanks for the recipe.

The only changes I made were the added seasonings of garlic and the Forward mix from Penzeys to the flour and added chipotole Tabasco to the eggs. This recipe is a keeper and I will definitely make it again.

Was really surprised how good this turned out.  For some reason they never ever look like the picture lol.  I was worried about all of the oil absorbing into chicken but saw a comment about heating the oil prior to putting chicken into pan and it worked great.  I poured the oil back in measuring cup after cooking and got more than 1/2 of it back so not as bad as I thought. Tasted great will make again for sure.

Baked "fried" chicken is a much healthier version.  I added garlic and pepper to the initial flour.  Bread crumbs were fine; however, our family uses hand-crushed cornflakes with some flour for an added crunch.  I agree that heating the oil in the pan first leads to a crispier crust.  Using non-stick foil with non-stick spray allows you to cut the oil down to a couple of tablespoons.

Was a great tasting fried chicken without all the oil. Placing in the oven freed up time to do other things instead of standing in front of a stove cooking.

I used 3 bone-in, skinless breast halves, reducing the amount of ingredients accordingly. Taking the advice of others,  I put the flour and bread crumb mixtures into separate baggies, which made coating pieces of meat very easy and less messy, and also used a spray oil in the baking pan. Next time I will add more spices to the coating mixture(s). Nice recipe; a keeper.

As an alternative I've substituted instant potato flakes for the Italian bread crumbs. Always comes out great, and super flakey.

The only personal change made was instead of Italian bread crumbs, we used plain bread crumbs. Overall, my husband and I really enjoy this recipe! It actually comes out crunchy so that's amazing and it's not as greasy as deep fried. I put foil on a pan, put olive oil on the bottom and just spread it around. Super tasty! We made this recipe twice this week . Definitely a keeper ?

Very good!   But my past experience with oven fried chicken legs tells me 400 is a better temp.  I did use butter/oil mix and lightly brushed the cooking surface and the chicken pieces.  BONUS TIP HERE::   drain them on brown paper (i.e. a grocery sack).   Draining any fried foods on thick paper yields very crispy results whereas paper toweling can leave it greasy or soggy.   I steal a few extra grocery sacks when I go to the  grocery store , for this very purpose!      Overall a great recipe with the very minor tweaks I mentioned!

Excellent; we followed the recipe exactly. It came out perfectly. Very crispy on the outside, and juicy on the inside.

This was a winner! Boyfriend took one bite, closed his eyes, and said, "Oh man, it's so good." I used bone in chicken thighs with skin. Seasoned generously: flour with Tony's, smoked paprika, and cayenne, egg with s&p and garlic powder, panko with Tony's, smoked paprika, cayenne, pepper, and garlic powder. I sprayed a cookie sheet with Pam and laid the thighs skin up. After 30 minutes at 350, flipped and upped temp to 375 for another half hour. The skin stayed on for the most part so I was pleased with that!

Resting the breaded chicken is a good idea.  For coating,  I use 8 oz., empty Cool Whip bowls.  I can twist and  cascade, rather than dredge.  This saves wasting ingredients on clumping.

I was totally disappointed with this recipe.  I followed it completely. Taste wise it was neither here nor there but most of all the batter completely peeled off and stuck to the bottom of the dish. Therefore I did not have a golden crispy chicken. It may have tasted better if the coating had stayed on.

I  made this for dinner for my husband who has diabetes. The only things I changed was I used Panko bread crumbs and sprayed the pan with cooking spray to eliminate the oil. The chicken was excellent , moist and crispy! The recipe is a keeper.

I made this my own by changing the recipe just a bit. First, used 2 eggs and 1/2 cup buttermilk   Added garlic powder, salt, onion powder, paprika, poultry seasoning and Italian seasoning to the flour. Refrigerated 30 minutes on a wire rack. Preheated 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/2 stick butter in oven 15 mts then added legs and thighs. Turned every 15 mts and turned up the oven to 400 the last 15 mts.  Drained on wire rack. Excellent!! Will definitely make again with my modifications

Loved that this was really simple to put together.  Loved one reviewers idea of the seasoned flour in a baggie to coat then use the same bag for the bread crumbs.  Remember to just handle the chicken with 1 hand and keep 1 hand clean!  I do not normally have Italian Seasoned bread crumbs so I found a recipe to make my own - perfect. I did go a little less on the oil and might try some butter too next time.  I think that oil rather than spray is required.  Be sure to cook long enough for chicken to be done and not just stick to the timing given.

My family went nuts over this recipe. It came out crispy on the outside and super moist on the inside and was oh so flavorful. For me, it was easy-peasy to make. I did use butter flavored coconut oil instead of regular oil and added a dash of milk to the eggs that another reviewer suggested. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a tee. I am writing this in my favorite recipes notebook tonight. Plan to make it again and again.

The chicken meat turned out wonderful, but the skin was far too greasy for my personal liking and it made the skin moist. I'll stick with a fryer.

Just as there is with anything, this recipe has its pros and cons. First, the pros... The breading adheres to the chicken perfectly. I even found the meat to be moist and cooked thoroughly without being overcooked. It's definitely a recipe that can be worked with, as well as quick and easy. The cons... This recipe is SO BLAND! Even having added garlic salt, pepper and paprika to the flour, the chicken still came out very bland and boring. I would recommend salting the chicken after it's been breaded OR putting salt in the breading itself, rather than in the flour.

Big hit with the family! I varied the recipe:
Dipped in mixture of eggs and a few dollops of mayo and milk. Then dipped in mixture of flour, breadcrumbs and my favorite spices. Finally, baked in melted butter and a little vegetable oil. Awesome!

My family loves this dish and cannot get enough of it.  I always have to make extra.  I have made it so much that my friends cannot tell the difference.  I use olive oil spray instead of the oil.  I love it because it is no greasy at all.

This recipe produced pretty crispy chicken.  I used butter instead of oil and a combination of panko and Italian bread crumbs.  Also, added a little milk to the eggs.  Next time I think I will bake at 375.  I used drumsticks and you need to be sure not to crowd the pieces for better crisping.

If you are in the mood for good FRIED chicken, this is not the recipe for that. This was tasty but reminded me too much of Shake-N-Bake. It is too oily so cut down the oil by at least half if you choose to make this. If the thighs have any bulk to them at all, I would add some cooking time as well; maybe 10 to 12 minutes total.

We followed the recipe with very slight modification. We did the outside coating with Italian bred crumbs and panco. We left off the paprika and found 3o min on each side was excessive (should have used a thermometer!) Almost cooks itself!

Good recipe..... but not that much oil is needed. I used 1/4 of melted butter and oil mixed together. I coated the bottom with a little bit (use a brush) , place chicken in the pan then drizzle the top of the chicken with the rest. It was a perfect , not too oily at all.

Delicious!  The  changes I made were using gluten free flour and bread crumbs and using nonstick cooking spray instead of oil.  My family loved it and I am thinking it's going to be a Sunday dinner staple at my house!  Already planning to do it with a Nashville hot spin on it next time! Yum!

I made this recipe last night with minor changes.  I used two thighs, two drums and two wings, used olive oil spray rather than the oil, and added dried thyme and sprigs of fresh rosemary (placed on top of each piece of chicken to enhance the flavor).  It turned out GREAT! Nice and juicy, not greasy.  I even ate one of the thighs cold the next day and it was just fantastic!  Nothing oven baked can take the place in my heart for deep fried chicken, but I'll certainly be making this as my healthy alternative.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! I wanted to make this because I honestly didn't believe that it could taste just as good as fried chicken. But it definitely does! My husband and daughter both loved it and we all had leftovers the next day. I may add in a few more spices next time I make it and I also used less oil (about 1/4 of a cup) but other than that I wouldn't change a thing.  My friend who makes the best southern fried chicken I have ever tasted says she couldn't believe I made this chicken in the oven! Thank you so much for sharing!

I made this in a hurry, to cook thawed-out chicken breast.  I followed the recipe, and after reading several other reviews, added Cajun seasoning .  I also added a dash of spicy salt to the flour mixture.  Did not use any other salt or pepper as it was not needed.

I used breasts cut up into strips.  Cooked for 20 minutes at 390.  They were very tasty.   I will make this again.

My husband and I loved this "fried" chicken. The only thing I added was hot sauce on the breaded chicken, just before putting the chicken in the oven. The recipe was simple, delicious and I will make it again!

I made this for dinner today. Scrumptious! However, I seasoned the chicken pieces then refrigerated overnight. I then followed the advice from BelleD and refrigerated the chicken on a wire rack for 30 minutes after coating the pieces before putting into the oven. This meant that hardly any of the coating fell off during cooking. I also placed foil in the pan before putting in the chicken, which really made the chicken moist. Instead of using bread crumbs, I crushed 7 crackers (saltines) with a rolling pin (only cooked 4 pieces of chicken). I would definitely be cooking this again!

I just made this for the first time.  I like more spice, so I added Cajun seasoning to the flour mixture.  I then used Hungarian paprika to sprinkle on top.  It was very tasty.  I'd highly recommend it.  It was quick and easy to make.

This is a very good oven fried chicken and it is so easy to make! The first time I made it, I followed the directions exactly and it was really good. I read a few of the suggestions posted by others, and decided to incorporate some of the advice the second time I made the chicken.  I was sure to thoroughly dry the chicken before the dredging process, then I placed the dredged chicken in the refrigerator for a few hours before cooking. I used two 9x13 pans, melting a 1/4 cup of butter in each in the preheated oven. Then, I placed the chicken in the heated pans and cooked as directed.  Turned out even better, and was a huge hit for our Super Bowl party! This is a keeper!

This turned out really good! I served my chicken with white rice, and had to use different bread crumbs (made them myself out of white bread and added seasoning to the bread crumbs). This recipe is very easy, which is good because I'm still a beginner when it comes to cooking.

My husband cannot believe this is not pan fried.  He loves it.  I have made this at least once a week for the past 2 months.  The only thing I do differently is to use butter instead of oil and I let the breaded chicken rest before baking.

This chicken was great, but I did change it up a little. I added milk to my eggs, used butter instead of oil, and used panko crumbs instead of bread crumbs. It turned out excellant!

I've tried several oven fried chicken recipe &, of the three I've tried & liked, this one was outstanding! First oven fried chicken recipe where the coating actually adheres to the chicken all the way until serving & was really crisp. My husband & I enjoyed it so well that we had it again the nights later. It's quick, easy & delicious ??

I made several changes to this, and it turned out *delicious*. First, I coated the chicken in barbecue sauce and let it marinade for about 15 min before dredging it in the flour. Second, I ground the end pieces of bread in my magic bullet, and used them as my bread crumbs, rather than store bought. This made the chicken turn out much more moist. Third, I added a generous amount of cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and salt to the breadcrumbs which gave them an *amazing* flavour. Fourth, I cut the oil down by half. Fifth, I baked it for a total of 30 minutes, rather than the full hour. To be sure it was cooked, I used an oven thermometer, which actually ended up being 202 degrees, which is about 20 degrees hotter than it needs to be. Baking it for much longer would have just dried it out!

The italian bread crumbs did not provide much flavor for the chicken.  I seasoned the flour as much as I could without ruining it.  However, the chicken needed more seasoning.  The paprika was not enough.  I will not cook this recipe again.

Very crispy,  and as delicious as any fried chicken.  I gave it a spray of veg oil before it went into the oven, which might have helped make it so crispy.  I did a drum and a thigh, which were very large pieces, and it was browning too quickly so I turned the temp down to 325.  My chicken was cooked through nicely.

It's a simple recipe that outperformed my expectations.  I didn't add all the oil on the bottom of the pan, but it still worked.  I think that it would be better to mist the chicken in oil, but despite not having done so, it was still crunchy all around anyways.  I opted for some Frank's in the egg wash for some more flavor.  A def recommend and a staple in my files.

I used a cookie sheet, after reading that some reviewers used Pam cooking spray, I didn't measure the but drizzle it lightly over the sheet. The fat from the skin rendered more fat and I just may use PAM next time. Next time, I'll add a bit more salt.

Fast and tasty. I heated  a part butter/olive oil in the oven first and added the chicken.

Definitely will make again. If your scared of oil.  Just put how much you want. As it cooks you can add a little , so it doesn't dry out. Totally Yummy.

Turned out well. I used butter in the pans, which was the right call. I used a shake of cayenne pepper, next time I'll add more salt, maybe more seasoning than the Italian bread crumbs offered.  I baked breasts in their own pan for about 30 minutes, carefully turning over all chicken pieces half way through.  Baked the leg/thigh combo for 45 minutes.  I turned the heat up to 375 for the last half of baking to make sure the skin was crispy.  I usually like to use bags to roll chicken and such in, but next time I will use shallow plates to cut back on waste.  With some modification, I will use this for chicken again.

My family loved it.  I thought a little too greasy, so next time I'll try less oil.  Also bland - so next time more spices.  :)

These turn out like you put a lot of time and effort into them, even though you didn't. I'll probably make this for guests next time. I still prefer fried chicken over these, but they need so much work compared to this recipe. Easy, but good, I recommend it.

This is the best oven fried chicken recipe I've ever made. It comes out perfectly crispy and delicious. The only change I made was to put the Flour mixture and the Bread Crumbs in baggies to shake the chicken pieces in to coat and I found that the baking dish recommended was not big enough so used a flat sheet with edges instead. Other than that, this recipe is excellent. Everyone that tried it loved it.

I left the skin on hoping for crispy.  Didnt happen.  Only deviation was i added garlic and onion powder for more flavor.  Thighs cooked all the way through, didnt add oil. It looked better than it tasted.

It's how you make chicken schnitzel but without the frying in oil. Always a bonus not to have to fry in oil! I use an Italian breadcrumb mix that has Parmesan in it. Yummayyy!!

I liked that this recipe was easy to make and didn't need a lot of ingredients. I read all the helpful reviews and modified my recipe. I used chicken drumsticks, cooking spray, parchment paper and panko Italian breadcrumbs instead. I cooked the drumsticks exactly according to the recipe. I think because I sprayed the chicken with Pam and used panko breadcrumbs, it resulted in a very crispy coating without the greasiness. Will go in the regular menu rotation! Thanks for the recipe.

I make this at least once a month. I raise the oven temperature to 375 and lower the cooking time a bit. This seems to give a better crisp to the coating without overcooking. 

Some comments say it's greasy, but if you drain on paper towels as the recipe suggests, and let it "rest" for a few minutes, it's perfect. I guess you could use Pam, but without the oil in the pan, you don't get that awesome "fried chicken" coating. 

I have used milk mixed with the eggs (only because I was low on eggs) and I don't notice any difference in taste at all. I've also tried it with boneless chicken but you cannot bake it long enough to get that crispy coating without killing the chicken.

I seasoning my flour with 1 tsp. garlic and 1 tsp. onion powders
1 tsp. Italian Seasoning & 1 tsp. of parsley. Then season the chicken with salt and pepper directly. Panko Bread Crumbs is used for that added crunch. the chicken come out very flavorful and it smells so good cooking. Thanks, Happy Cooking!

I tried this chicken with the butter instead of oil as I got some drumsticks from a neighbour that was moving.  I did find the chicken a bit chewy rather than crispy but I am not a huge fan of dark meat - so I'm likely not the best measure. However, my husband and son declared these delicious.

Spread the pan with Pam, that was plenty of oil.  I THINK I made this a few years ago because my notes said to add garlic powder and seasoned salt, still think it needs more seasoning.  But it did come out crispy on the outside & juicy inside.  I'm still keeping this one, just need to add a little more spices.  Thanks for the recipe.

Have enjoyed this every time. Cut down the oil by half.  Definately need a baking dish that gives you some room around the chicken or it will be a little soggy.

Excellant , can use many variations of dips. We baked the chicken in a large cast iron skillet, didn't need to use slot of oil/butter.  Came out excellant, just like mom used to make.  Just be sure skillet has the iron handle not a wooden handle.

i marinated the chicken with 2 tsps of garlic and ginger paste and let it rest for about 3 hours before following the rest of the instructions, tasted very good.

I followed the recipe other than the thighs I used legs, and I forgot to throw the paprika on top.  My husband and kids loved this!  I took others advice and used 2 pans instead of 1 so there was no overcrowding...def a good idea.  I ran out of bread crumbs so used panko and that actually was a good thing. Made the legs extra crunchy.  Definately a keeper!

This recipe was fairly easy to make.  I didn't have any bread crumbs so instead used crushed italian flavor croutons.  The coating came out just as good!  Definitely need to space the chicken out a little more.  Also used this same recipe for boneless chicken breasts and was delicious!

supper yummy!!!!!!!!! Everyone loved it. This was my first time making chicken thighs so i was really worried but it came out great. I used a little bit of milk in the egg, maybe just 2 TBLS. It was crispy and looked great too :)  I think next time I will use a little less oil but other than that it was perfect.

Pretty good recipe. It was really good the first night but leftovers did not heat up well.  Also, I only used 2 legs & thighs and may have overcooked the chicken.

I have made this recipe twice, and it's a keeper.  It's a bit messy to make but so easy.  My husband and two sons, ages 12 and 8, love it.  I used chicken legs when I made it.  The legs turned out juicy and flavorful.  Thank you for submitting this recipe!

This was really good. The only thing was that athestically it was not pleasing, but that is bc my oven is wacky...it looked burned but it tasted great! I used leg quarters. I was concerned about flavoring the thick peices of chicken so I put a garlic, s+p, and olive oil mix onder the skin. Also added garlic powder to the flour, and followed the suggestion of warming the oil in the oven first, maybe that is why it was dark. Anywho it was delicious and quick. Served with greens and cornbread. Will be a staple chicken recipe.

MY FAMILY LOVED THIS CHICKEN!!  I used half thighs and half legs. The only change I made was to add italian seasoning salt to the flour instead of just regular salt.  This will become one of my "go to" recipes for sure.

I made this last night with a few changes.  I added about a tbsp. of sage and used chicken legs but it was very delicious.  I think I might cut the amount of oil used, turned out a little soggy, but it was very good!  Will definately make this again and again!!!

The first time I made this we thought it was awesome!  Being from New Orleans, I did add some Tony's to the bread crumbs, however, it still wasn't spicey enough so the second time I sprinkled the chicken with crushed red pepper and it was perfect!

This should ge 4 1/2 rather than 5 or the following reasons:
1)12 chicken thighs is enough to feed 6 or 8 people not four.

2)The egg mixture doesn't make enough to coat 6 Thighs without adding milk to it.

3)It took a whole box of Panko bread crumbs to coat all 6 piece of mine.

Aside from that, the taste is out of this world good. I ran out of paprika so I used Mexene Chili Powder instead. I also dredged the pieces in whole wheat flour instead of regular old AP. I don't think it makes a difference though. The texture was fabulous. I served it with Mushroom Rice II also from this site to rave reviwes from my hubby.

This was pretty good. I think I would lessen the oil though. Seemed a bit too greasy. I liked that the crust stayed on the chicken, so definitely don't skip the flour or egg or crumbs. I did have to put A LOT more seasoning, garlic salt, onion salt, pepper, etc but it still wasn't enough. My boyfriend loved it, but me and my daughter thought it was just kinda blah. I might make it again.....

OK I guess ... I wasn't all that taken with the texture of the batter once cooked, and there wasn't enough seasoning for the chicken even though I'd added some poultry seasoning ... I'm going to keep looking.

Flavor was good and the chicken was tender; however, it was a bit soggy and bread crumb coating stuck to the pan.  Had larger thighs so cranked oven up to 375 for 1st 30 minutes and down to 350 for remaining 30 minutes.  Kicking myself for not draining on paper towels after baking - perhaps that could have helped with retaining a crispier texture?  Hubby still enjoyed.  I'm sure the kids would have liked it if they tried it - picky 4 and 2 yr old!  Thanks for the recipe!

I messed about with recipe as I nearly always do, the recipe as I cooked it varies from the original is some pretty salient points.  My husband is a fat-phobe so I completely did away with the 1/2 c of oil.  I trimmed the thighs of their the excess skin and fat leaving only the bit covering the outer face of each limb.  I used a couple of T of fat-free ranch dressing and 2 eggs. 'Sprayed the pans (needed an extra 8x8 to hold all 12 thighs).  Naturally, they were not totally fried-crispy given these modifications but they were nicely crunchy and a very tasty alternative to oven baked.

My family really like this dish. I boiled the chicken first before baking since I used chicken breasts and they are bigger. Plus, I used pam and olive oil like another memeber suggested. It turned out really well. It wasn't greasy at all. I will be making this again!

It was tasty enough, but my husband really thought it was Shake & Bake!  It was very healthy and flavorful, but it was no fried chicken!  This might be a great treat meal for kids to let them think they are eating something "bad"!

I just don't think you can replicate fried chicken without actually frying it.  These were okay but next time I want fried chicken I think I will just fry it.

Sorry, not much flavor, and was very mushy. And on a personal note I don't think I like thighs, they were so fatty. The kids picked over it. But my southern husband cleaned the bone dry and gave it a 4 stars.

This recipe was easy and delicious.  I have made oven fried chicken in the past using bisquick but it is cooked at a higher temperature causing it to smoke and set off the smoke alarms.  This recipe was very good.  The chicken was nice and brown and looked pan fried without the mess.  My husband loved it, I will definately be making this one again and again.

Used breasts and ended up just placing the breaded breasts on a baking sheet lined with Release and baking. This worked much better.

This was just o.k. nothing special. I like others added a lot more seasonings. I also used Pam instead of all that oil. Maybe next time I'll try it in a glass pan to see if it gets crispier.

this turned out awesome--the crispiest over baked chicken I've ever made. I did use some crushed saltines along with italian bread crumbs.

After rolling the chicken in flour, I dipped it in to egg that was mixed with an Italian dressing, which worked well since the spices in the dressing clung to the chicken. I then rolled them in breadcrumbs with extra seasonings. I then sprayed both the pan a nd the chicken with cooking spray. I wouldn't suggest the fatty vegetable oil in the pan, not to mention the dirty oven to clean afterwards.

This recipe was great!! The only changes I made was adding extra italian seasoning to the bread crumbs and exaporated milk to the eggs. Make sure you drain the chicken after it's done cause it's a little greasy.

I used legs, marinated in fresh garlic, ginger and balsamic vinegar - you can't go wrong, right?  Well, there is no substitute for fried anything.  Though not bad tasting, I was not thrilled with the outcome.  I think I would have enjoyed it more if i wasn't craving fried chicken.

I liked the cooking method (easy!), but I found the chicken lacked full flavor - a bit bland. I would make this again using extra spices, etc. for more flavor.

very tasty.  What did I do wrong?  They were not very crispy, even though I increased oven temperature.  I will certainly try again and any suggestions will be welcome, espicially since our local market is offering, buy 1 package and get "2 free".  thanks all

This was very delicious! It was quick and easy and there are a lot of things that you can do with it. For instance, I made a wing sauce with hot sauce and a tablespoon of butter and doused the chicken in that and it was very yummy!

Very nice crip, but I find the meat inside is pretty plain.
