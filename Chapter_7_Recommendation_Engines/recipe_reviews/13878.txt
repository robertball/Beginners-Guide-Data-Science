Generally, we liked this very much.  But make sure you add some salt and pepper because it was very tasteless without it.  We had it with rice and mixed some soy sauce in with it, and it was very good.

Great way to use left over turkey.. I subbed frozen peas and carrots.. the carrots replaced the pimento.. which I'm out of.. but still added some pretty color, as well as flavor.. Ofcourse I  added some salt and pepper, as I do with everything.. I will serve this again and again.. It's colorful, flavorful, and healthy!! Oh yes, I served it on biscuits.. Thanks for sharing!!

A little boring with no spices.  Needs salt and pepper plus other spice depending on your personal taste buds.  Curri would go very nicely.

I added only a cup of Milk then added a cup and 1 1/2 cups of chicken stock. As I did not have any mushrooms, green bell peppers. I replaced with it a can of mixed carrots and peas. I added 1 tablespoon montreal steak peppers and added a tablespoon of sea salt. This took away any bland taste that others have talked about

Like other reviewers, it was too bland. I read the reviews first. So when I made it, I actually made a packet of Turkey Gravy on the side according to directions, then added it to the mixture.  Came out perfect with great taste!

My family and I didn't enjoy this. It was too bland, even after adding salt and pepper. I'm finding we're not big on white sauce dishes like this one.

This was a good basic recipe and it will work for many people. For many people some recipies are bland but there are reasons. Some people need to watch their diet. Salt intake can hurt many people. So rather then just griping about something being bland taste it and add seasonings.
Salt
Pepper
Poultry seasoning.
Season it to your taste. 
I used fresh  mushrooms and peas and carrots which were frozen so adding those which were not completely cooked added more flavor as did the mushrooms since i added them to the onions and bell peppers with the butter.
If you have any dressing left over and you froze it then slice it and spoon the medley over it.

Some people served it over biscuts. Others served it over egg noodles. For me I had left over dresssing frozen and sliced it and served it over the dressing. I might make pot pies next time. this medely can also be done with left over roast especially if you made gravey with the roast drippigs

This can also be made into a pot pie. Roll out biscuits until thin and you have a pie shell making one big pie will also work. 

Adding egg noodles after cooked can thicken it up and greate a cassarole you can top with panko or even frrench fried onions. All it takes is looking for things in your cabinet that isn't used often. Everything you add adds flavoring too.

After reading the reviews, and adding poultry seasoning and salt/pepper, leftover gravy, we really liked it. It reminded us of pot pie filling. So, our new family name for this dish is "Naked Turkey Potpie"!

This was just ok.  How can this recipe not call for salt and pepper?!?!  It is quite bland without it!  I added S&P, and used carrot instead of pimentos, sauteing the carrot with the onion and celery.  I also used fresh mushrooms and added them to the saute once the onion began to turn translucent.  I also decided to stir in the egg noodles instead of topping them, and then baked them with a buttery crumb topping.  My changes were a big improvement as the recipe was quite boring and bland as written.

What a nice way to make leftover turkey into a different tasting dish.  I did add pepper, and a little soy sauce.  I put more peas than called for and some corn in it for vegetables.  My husband liked it a lot.

Delicious turned out great. I used frozen peas instead of canned. A little pepper to taste and served over warmed potatoes. And next I’ll cook some egg noodles mix together toss in a casserole and sprinkle fried onions on top. And another great meal for the crowd. Thank you for the base recipe.

I tried this to use up the last of our thanksgiving turkey. I thought it was "okay", but my husband didn't like it at all, even with the addition of salt, pepper and curry powder.
