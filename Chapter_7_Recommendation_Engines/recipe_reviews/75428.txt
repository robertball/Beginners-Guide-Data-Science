This was wonderful.  But instead of doing individual parfaits...I used a trifle bowl.  I also added raspberries for more color.  Thank you for the recipe.

Made this for New Year's Eve and it was a hit! Very nice and light with a nice tart accent. Used the advise of oodles' and really liked the raspberries. I also made this in a clear glass bowl since I took it to a party and it worked very well. Will definately make this one again.

Didn't deviate from the recipe at all, and I'm glad I didn't.  We thought this was outstanding, even using frozen peaches.  Using fresh peaches would put this at 10 stars IMO, and its eye appeal is nice enough for company!  All elements of this parfait are harmonious, and I most definitely will make this again.

I made this in a trifle bowl, as "oodles" did. I doubled the recipe. I added about two cups of blueberries for color, making sure they were scatted around the edge of the layer so they would show.  I used fresh peaches.  They are in abundance in the Carolinas in July.
Making the sauce was the most time-consuming part, but worth it!  Peeling the peache would have been time-consuming, but I recuited my husband to do that.Anything for a good dessert!

This was rather good!  Quite a bit more work than just layering yogurt and berries in a glass and topping with granola, the the flavors tell why!  I felt the need to add more sugar because when the sauce coated the spoon, I tasted it and puckered right up!  I had to use angel food cake because pound cake was sold out 3 different places I went (must be for shortcakes and the 4th!), but either works. Made for Western Region Allstars Faceless Frenzy July 2012
