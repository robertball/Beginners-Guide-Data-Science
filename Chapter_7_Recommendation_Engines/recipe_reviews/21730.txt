I had to review this recipe because my husband and I love it so much. I make a few modifications: omit olive oil, use only 1/3 c. butter, and toss everything with a little oil from the sundried tomatoes. The flavor is amazing and it's pretty easy to make. Sometimes I add chicken. I bake covered except for the final 10 mins.

This is a great recipe.  I cut the amount of butter in half (after tasting it, I can't imagine MORE butter!).  I also used 2/3 the amount of olive oil and only 1 c sun dreied tomatoes.  I added 1 c chopped fresh tomatoes.  I changed these things to cut way back on the calories and fat.  The flavor is amazing.  I might cover the dish the last 10 minutes...my pasta got a little crunchy on top - but my husband liked it that way.  Will make again for sure!

Omitted the prosciutto and added a few more veggies.  Also, cut way back on the butter.  This is a great, pure and simple meal.  Love it!

This was delicious and a very colorful dish!  I highly recommend it as a great vegetable-filled pasta dish.  I did tweek the recipe as others did.  I cut the butter to about 3 TBS and used a bit less olive oil too.  Since I was making this for a vegetarian friend, I eliminated the proscuitto.  I added fresh tomatoes along w/ the sun-dried tomatoes.  To add a bit of extra flavor, I also added some of the herbs in oil from the sun-dried tomato jar.  I cooked it for 30 minutes covered and removed the foil for the remaining 10 minutes.  It had just enough crispy bits, but not too many! Yummy recipe!

This dish is excellent.  I did make some alterations with ingredients.  Since I'm not fond of broccoli I added 1 cup of each onions and mushrooms.  Instead of the sun-dried tomatoes I used fresh grape tomatoes.  These being of small size there was no need to chop.  Then I used bacon instead of the prosciutto.  I browned it first leaving the drippings.  Then I added the tomatoes and butter which I decreased to 1/2 cup.  This dish is a treat to the taste buds along with the nose.

I made this last night and it turned out excellent. I think it is a very good base recipe to tailor based on your own tastes. I added crushed red pepper flakes, some salt and pepper and basil to give it more flavor.

I only used 2 tablespoons of butter and I tossed the pasta and veggies with garlic infused olive oil. I did not use meat in this recipe or the sun dried tomatoes. 

I like the fact you can bake this in the oven so that you don't have to time everything perfectly to get the pasta and veggies hot  at the same time and then you don't have to serve immediately, the dish stays hotter longer than if you just toss the pasta and veggies together.

This is my favorite recipe!!!!!  The taste is awesome!!!! There weren't any leftovers.  Did do some modifications as others stated.  I used only 1 Tbls of oil for the veggies and only 2 1/2 Tbls of butter for the proscitto, garlic and sun dried toms.  I also used the oil from the jarred sun dried toms.  I drained most of the oil out of the jar first but didn't strain the sun dried toms. I can't wait to cook this for company.  I think I will grill chicken marianded in Italian dressing to accompany the pasta. Yummy!

Made this recipe but cut out Prosciutto, butter, and cheese since I'm a vegetarian, still delicious!! I just used a little extra EVOO to sautee veggies.

I love this dish! I have made it several times now. Because my boyfriend is a vegetarian I leave out the ham and it is still delicious. However, if you leave out the ham, make sure to get salted butter instead of unsalted because the lack of ham really takes away from the flavor. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe works pretty well, but I'd definitely suggest cutting back on the butter. There's no reason to use 3/4 cup. Also, if you find sun-dried tomatoes to be too tough, consider using sauteed cherry tomatoes.

Tasty recipe, although I cannot see any need for baking it in the end. Would not the result be the same if tossed around at the end of stove top cooking? I also fail to see the need for all that butter; it would most definitely give a more authentic Italian feel with only olive oil, albeit some more than just the 2 tablespoons.

We used this recipe to made a dish to serve 30 people.  Instead of using that many sun dried tomatoes, we used two cans of diced tomatoes with Italian herbs along with a large package of sun dried tomatoes that we had reconstituted.  We also found that we needed to add some salt and some other spices to kick it up a notch with the volume of pasta and vegetables.

Greatbasic recipe, I skipped the meat and made it with veggies only and it was great. I think you could skip the butter, sauté in EVOO & serve straight without baking and it would be just as good. If you do bake, cover it - we forgot and the top was a bit over-crusty

Penne Rustica is my all-time favorite dish at Olive Garden. This penne recipe far surpasses that dish. I loosely followed the recipe. Substitued 1/2 large onions for asparagus, 3 tbsp Olive Oil for butter, added 1/3 cup chicken broth just before popping into oven. It was superb!!! Like other posters here suggest, I'll make this again with different seasonal veggies to change it up a bit. Can't go wrong with cheese & pasta!

I prepared this recipe almost exactly the same except I used diced tomatoes instead of sun dried. Mine turned out really dry and crispy on top. In my opinion, the recipe would have been better minus the baking. IF I try this again, I'll just toss the pasta and veggies and then sprinkle with cheese.

Excellent!!   - I added extra seasonings - salt, pepper, and italian seasoning - to our tastes - know your spices and your tastes and NO recipe can be bland!!!!! - Also - - - I used Campanelle pasta and 1 package of sundried tomatoes (not in oil).  I didn't go by "cups" in the recipe - I used one huge bunch of brocolli (florets only), 4 large zucchini, and one bunch of thin asparagus.  I didn't use the red pepper - didn't want that in this dish.  After cooking the veggies - and the pasta - I cooked the diced s.d. tomatoes and prosciutto in one stick of butter - with 1/4 cup of olive oil.  Mixed all in a large glass casserole and loaded the top with mozarella cheese.  Came out FANTASTIC!!!  Sure - is a little rich - but the extra butter in the pasta is good mopped up with soft french bread!!!  Perfect dish with your favorite wine!

My husband said multiple times how he liked this dish, which makes me very happy!  I swapped bacon in for the prosciutto.  I cooked the bacon, took it out of the pan, and then cooked the garlic and sundried tomatoes in the drippings.  I did not use any butter.  Other than that I followed the rest of the recipe.  We liked the crunchiness the baking gave to the pasta and we liked all the sundried tomatoes.  Next time I might increase the amount of broccoli and/or zucchini.

I followed this recipe and it turned out oily at the bottom and dry/crunchy on the top. I tried it because of all the reviews but my first thought was that it needed some sauce. I will not make this recipe again, even with sauce.

I changed this up a bit.  I used the swirl pasta since that's what I had, boiled in water with a dash of salt till cooked and set aside.  I used asparagus, red bell pepper, zucchini, crooked neck squash and white onion.  I sauteed with very little olive oil and added salt and pepper.  I put this aside and cut up the chicken into large bite size pieces and cooked in the same pan i sauteed the veggies in, I added some sun dried tomatoes and about 2 large tablespoons of sun dried tomato pesto and salt and pepper and also added some red pepper flakes.  Once the chicken was cooked I combined everything and served.  I added a little fresh parmesan on top.  My husband loved it!  I will make it again.

The grownups in the household loved this, but the younger set picked out the tomatoes and bell pepper. I didn't use an entire cup of the bell pepper, just chopped one. Thanks for the recipe. Yummy!

Great keeper recipe ! I made this about a year ago and found it dry. After re-reading the reviews I covered it for the first 20 minutes and it was much better this time. My husband and daughter both raved about the taste. A real tasty dish :-)

Love this dish! Used some grilled chicken instead of proscuitto and used less butter 1/2 cup and little less sun dried tomatoes. It was wonderful but barely fit in the 9x13. 3 people ate it for dinner and there is still a very full pan left.

The picture looked so good we had to try it.  I was concerned that since it didn't have a sauce it would be dry but it was light and full of flavor.  I used diced salami since proscuitto tends to be pricey.  It worked great...  I used one jar of sun-dried tomatoes with the oil. Also instead of a bell pepper I used jarred roasted red pepper (added to the salami and sundried tomatoes).  It was a pretty dish coming out of the oven.

A very delicious dish. Not a time friendly dish when your hungry and trying something new as soon as you get off from work; after a few errands. The hungry and wait and time was worth it. A very nice dish with plenty of left overs for two. I cooked up some italian sausage, diced them up and added them to the dish because I was wanting some meet in my dish. The only thing I didn't like about it was the grease and oil that collects in the bottom of the dish; Not diet friendly food.  :)

very flavorful! We really enjoyed it. I left out the prosciutto, didn't have broccoli or zucchini, so I used crimini mushrooms and edamame beans.I didn't use anywhere near the 2 cups of sun dried tomatoes as called for. I topped the pasta/veggie mixture with fresh mini mozzarella balls, which melted into the mixture. I will add this to the make again file!

Tweeked it a bit...but either way was good!  No butter...only EVOO. Added mushrooms, omitted zucchini and broccoli.  Used cherry tomatoes in place of sun-dried tomatoes.  Also used Feta cheese instead of parmesan.  Very light and healthy. Tasted even better!  This is a winner!

Excellent!  I cut back on the calories ...used 1/5 stick butter to sauté the garlic and left out the prosciutto. I used Hunt's Fire-Roasted Diced tomatoes instead of the sun dried. I used frozen chopped broccoli, 1 zucchini, and some cauliflower and asparagus that was starting to wilt. It still turned out great!

My family really enjoyed this. We didn't bake...I prepared everything - it was warm and ready to go.  I melted the butter and added as necessary.  Baking may require more butter due to it drying out....Will definitley make again - I used prosciutto for the first time, and no one noticed it either way - don't feel that it's a necessity.

I made this with a few changes.  1. Bowtie pasta, not penne.  2. Roasted red bell peppers, not sundried tomatoes.  3. 3 tbsp of butter, not 3/4 cup
4. Juice and zest of 2 lemons added to the butter/garlic sauce.  5. Sprinkle of finishing salt with the parmesan cheese.

Very fresh and spring-y.

This was a brilliant dinner for my 3yr old and 1yr old, as well as my husband and I.  Followed the general idea but cut back on the butter, as per other reviewers and had to sub artichoke hearts and mushrooms for the peppers and zucchini because it was all I had.  Also added toasted pine nuts with pasta and mixed some bread crumbs and chopped oregano with parmesan and put half in mix and half on top for a bit of crunch. And everyone loved it!  I was amazed to see my 1yr old sucking on a sun-dried tomato and loving it!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

Good basic recipe, baked at 350o 30 minutes but found this to be a rather dry dish, would suggest adding  1/2 c chicken broth before baking. I decreased butter to 2 tablespoons.

Big hit at friends for July 4th and leftover the next night at home. I cooked the veggies in a dry hot cast iron skillet till slightly blackened, which lends a smokey flavor. Sun dried tomatoes are strong; I used 1/2 the amount and it was plenty. Used some of that oil with olive oil and omitted all butter. Added fresh basil. Would also be good with fresh tomatoes instead of dried. Great side dish for a cookout!

This recipe is good only if you make major changes. I made it as it stands, except for the butter. Even though i LOVE butter, it just seemed to be way too much. And it would have been. As it was, after baking it was too greasy and the vegetables limp and tasteless. It would have been much better if I had simply served it after combining everything. At that point, the veggies still had some crunch and the parmesan hadn't separated making the pastagreasy.I cut the butter to 2T and that was plenty. Three-fourths of a cup of butter turns a relatively healthful meal into one swimming in fat. I will probably make a version of this in the future, but with more vegetables and some fresh tomatoes. I liked the sun-dried tomatoes, but good ones are expensive and why bother when you can get flavorful cherry or grape tomatoes. Fresh basil would be good as well.

I made this for a potluck, and actually, everyone loved it, but I made some revisions: I had to use pre-cooked bacon because prosciutto isn't available where I live, also, I thought it would become really soggy if I put it in the butter/tomato mixture, so I just mixed the bacon and some extra minced garlic right into the veggies and pasta before tossing them with the butter/tomato mixture. Which brings me to the butter--it's too much. Next time, I will use only 1/4 cup of butter mixed with most of the oil from the sun-dried tomatoes. Oh, I just read other reviews and realized I was not alone in thinking it was too much butter and needed some of the sun-dried tomato oil!! Anyway, it was delicious when those changes were made! Next time, I want to put in pine nuts and maybe even some pesto...definitely some fresh basil! Oh, ps, I used gluten free pasta and it worked fine...

This is a very good pasta dish, and the flavors of the vegetables really shine.  There isn't any need to drown the vegetables in herbs and spices, but I do think some red pepper flakes would be delicious and add a nice kick. Still, it was yummy just as written also. Thanks for sharing!

This is one of our favorite dishes!  What we love about it most is that it is so versatile - use whatever veggies you have on hand or pick your favorites.  Our favorite version omits the sundried tomatoes and adds one cup of shredded carrots, 1 cup of mushrooms, and chicken.  As others recommend, cut the butter down to 1/4 cup.  Enjoy!

Super good but it did come out oily from the amount of butter. I left out the prosciutto by accident but the roasted vegetables kept the dish nice and flavorful

So good!  The only thing I would suggest is giving it a stir when it is half way through and using a bit less butter.  That way it is not as oily, the top layer will not crisp up, and it will ensure that your veggies will not vary in consistency throughout the dish.  Definitely a repeat!  Next time I am adding mushrooms in the mixture, and sautéed prawns to top it off!  Mmm.. mmm..

This is a really delicious recipe! And very, very versatile. I omitted the butter and sautéed the veggies until tender crisp. I didn't even put in in the oven. I think a lot of veggies could be used, and I look forward to making this many more times.

Made this for dinner last night and it was delicious! The only changes I made were I only added 3 oz. of prosciutto instead of 5 oz., as it was all I had, and it was plenty, 5 oz. would have been too overpowering. And I didn't have any zucchini, so I just left it out. Everything else was exact to the recipe. This will be added to my rotation of great meals to cook on a regular basis.

This is a great dinner with lots of veggies, and can be even better with a few simple alterations. I cut the butter to 2-3 tablespoons, and replaced the olive oil with oil drained from the sun dried tomatoes to enhance the flavor. Plus, I baked the dish covered with foil for the first 20 minutes and uncovered for the second half; that way the top pasta is somewhat crunchy but not overwhelmingly stiff. This dinner is always a hit and makes plenty of leftovers that reheat perfectly.

Excellent annd reasonably health.. What I did different: Bacon instead of prosciutto, I added 1cup of diced red onions, 2cups of sliced mushrooms, skipped the brocolli and drained the oil marinade from the sun-dried tomatoes and used that to saute the garlic, bacon and tomatoes. Also added a tsp of ground, dried rosemary and 2 tsp of dried oregano. Rave reviews from the adoring fans at the dinner table...

Pretty Solid recipe.  If baking in the oven it feels like it needs more cheese.  A little oily, was unclear if I was supposed to drain the sun-dried tomatoes.  I'll make a few changes next time, but will still use it.

Love this dish! I used fresh tomatoes and 1/2 a box of whole wheat penne pasta. Didn't have prosciutto so I used 2 slices of Canadian bacon. My husband and I both enjoyed this meal and will make it again. I like the fact that I was able to use my garden red bell pepper and I love zucchini. Thanks!

I'm giving this 5 stars because even my 13 year old daughter loved this. She asked for seconds the night we ate it and even heated up the leftovers the next day. This usually NEVER happens in our house. Great recipe/

Loved this dish!  The first time I made it, I used about 1/4 c butter, and I cooked up some bacon and added it to the last step instead of prosciutto because we had it on hand.  I cooked it for 25 minutes covered, then 10 minutes uncovered and thought that was great, but I did want more veggies.  The next time I made it, I doubled the veggies but kept everything else the same, and it's wonderful, love it!

This recipe was great but I changed a few things. Used about 1/3 cup butter and 1 TBSP olive oil. I increased the parmesan cheese a cup because I love PARMESAN! Roasted the veggies in the oven with cooking spray. Put parmesan cheese on top before baking. Everyone LOVED it!

I also thought this has a great flavor, but it was too greasy/ oily. And i didnt even use any olive oil. I did not drain the sun dried tomatoes because the instructions did not say to do so. So I had to mention this  as a caution to others. I would also use less butter next time.  Lastly  I didnt have time to bake it, but I also didnt find it necessary because all my ingrdients were still hot when I mixed them together.

As many others have suggested I used only 1/3 cup butter, less olive oil since the sun dried tomatoes still have oil on them, and used 1 cup canned chopped tomatoes with basil with 1 cup sun dried tomatoes.
Got a bit too crispy on top in the oven, so may be better if covered with foil for first twenty minutes.
Nevertheless, a huge success with family and delicious.
Will definitely make again.

Excellent recipe! I leave out the prosciutto to keep it vegetarian and use only 1 Tablespoon butter. I love that this recipe is flexible - you can use whatever veggies you like or have on hand. But I do recommend cutting way back on the amount of butter stated in the recipe. It's way too much and will just add a lot of unnecessary calories to the finished product.

SO delicious!!! My husband and I aren't huge sun dried tomato fans, so we left those out, but it was still fantastic! Cut down on the butter quite a bit after reading reviews. I also added some baby bella mushrooms which was awesome. I will say, once we served ourselves, we all added fresh cracked pepper and it totally made the dish! I will absolutely be making this again and will probably add new veggies!!

My family loved this.  I precooked the broccoli for two  minutes in the microwave and reduced the oil/butter.  Added salt, pepper, and oregano for flavor. Reduced the sun dried tomatoes to about 1 cup and used the oil for flavor.  Also added fresh small tomatoes. Thanks for a great recipe!

I loved it.  I used one zucchini, one red bell pepper broccoli  and no asparagus.  I also used fresh cherry tomatoes along with a jar of sundried tomatoes and just used the oil from the tomato jar - no butter. Fantastic.

This is a super yummy dinner. My husband liked it - he is picky, so that says so much. Takes awhile to prep, but super worth it. I make pasta all the time and needed a twist on it, and this is that twist!

This recipe is great with a few modifications. I only used 3 TBS of butter. I omitted the olive oil and instead tossed the pasta with 1 TBS of the oil from the sun dried tomatoes. I will also probably only use 1 cup of sun dried tomatoes instead of 2, just out of personal preference.  I also added 1 cup of cut up mushrooms, which I thought went perfectly with the rest of the dish. I also probably didn't use as much cheese as the recipe called for, but it was still fine. Next time I will be sure to cover with aluminum foil while baking, as the dish comes out a little dry if it's not covered. Overall, really delicious. I will definitely make this again!

Perfect for when you want a noodle dish without tomato sauce. I omitted the prosciutto (we don't eat that) and the sun-dried tomatoes (didn't have any) and it was still excellent. Thanks for the recipe!

Very tasty! A permanent recipe in my box! We're a family of 4 and there were PLENTY of leftovers. It's a pleasing dish to the eye too! My changes: I didn't use prosciutto and I reduced the amount of butter. I also used about half the sun-dried tomatoes (it was a cost thing!). I did as others did and baked it with foil on for 30 minutes and removed for the last 10, but I think next time I will leave the foil on for the entire bake time. If you want to add a little zing, I suggest adding a little crushed red peppers. All in all, this was a terrific dinner! I served it with an Italian garden salad.

I'm not a fan of changing a recipe then rating it but in a rush I made something that was inspired by this recipe.  All the same veggies, no butter, sausage instead of prosciutto, lots of cheese.  Delish!

Pretty good - I also added some sliced mushrooms and onion and added a sliced chicken breast.  I did not use any butter and just used some of the olive oil from the sundried tomatoes.  I can't imagine that swimming in all that butter!  I cooked it all in an electric skillet, rather than in the oven and sprinkled a bit of basil on top.  Well liked by all - thanks for the post!

Pretty good, my family of "meat and potatoes" people liked it even with all the vegetables.  I did think it was a bit oily, I'll probably cut back the oil and use fresh tomatoes next time instead of the sun-dried, as people have suggested.  Overall though it was pretty tasty.

This made a wonderful, fast, light weeknight dinner.  I added sliced mushrooms and decreased the butter to only 1/4 cup.  Made the dish far lighter and you just need enough butter to flavor the vegetables, not drench them in it.

It was great.
We can't use real bacon so I used soy  and it was delicious.
Next time I will add more vegetables and less pasta.
Also I don't think there is a need in this much butter but overall delicious .
Thank you for posting

This is a good all around basic dish. Yes I did change a few things and I know some people hate it when you change something and then rate it. Let's face it though not everybody wants the same dish made in the same way. We need to make changes with what is on hand and for health preferences. I do find that all that butter and cheese is a bit unhealthy. What is the point of cooking all those healthy vegetables and making it unhealthy with butter and cheese. If you want to get picky people to eat their veggies the butter and cheese is a great addition. Some people don't like that it turned dry. In that case either don't bake it or cover when baking. I pretty much had all ingredients and used all ingredients except I added green onions and regular onions. Also used regular tomatoes and did not bake it. I didn't have garlic so used garlic salt and powder instead, added pepper. Also I am a reducutarian and I try to reduce meat intake. So I didn't make it with any meat. We enjoyed it and will be making it again. I think everyone needs to change a recipe to suit their own needs.

Very tasty.  This is a variation of what I usually make.   I added red and orange peppers, did not use zucchini and had about 1/3 c of Turkey pepperoni, which I cut up for a little meat.  Added Ital. seasoning, only 2TBL butter, used herbed oil from the sun dried tomatoes, about 1 cup of chicken broth to the sauce ,   added cut up grape tomatoes as well.  Also used vegetable pasta.to add more color .  Tossed all in the pot, no oven.  Very good.    Thanks for the recipe.

This dish was delicious with some minor changes to fit my family's preferences - there was not a drop left!  I omitted the prosciutto and sun-dried tomatoes, but substituted sliced italian sausage and regular tomatoes, minus the seeds and juice.  I used frozen steam-in-the-bag asparagus, added mushrooms and squash, too.  Cut way down on the butter, but used a little more olive oil.  I used shredded parmesan cheese instead of grated to give it a deeper flavor.  Like another reviewer, I see no reason to bake it... next time I won't!  If you do choose to bake it, I would put a little chicken broth at the bottom of the pan to keep it from drying out and bake it at a lower temperature (I used 300) for a shorter period of time (15 min).  My kids raved about this!

This is a delicious fresh recipe. Since my boyfriend is vegetarian, I simply omitted the prosciutto. I roasted the veggies in a bit of olive oil in an iron skillet (great for blackening). After removing the veggies I then added only about 1/3 cup of butter and a tablespoon or so of olive oil to the pan, along with halved grape tomatoes and minced garlic to create the sauce. I used a little under a lb of pasta and a 5oz container of parmesan. I also covered the pasta while baking like other readers suggested. Yum!

I have made this twice already for my boyfriend and I. He absolutely loves it and says its one of his fave dishes. I follow recipe almost exact, except used less butter and use a lighter version. It's quite simple to make and healthy. Very flavorful and delicious!

I love the concept of pasta and veggies, but this was a little bland for me! I even added fresh basil and oregano to the veggies, (was surprised to not see these two ingredients in the recipe) also added red pepper flakes. Will make this combination again but will tweak it a little more.

This was a great side dish. I took some of the others advice and made the dish my own. I added more veggies, i.e. onions, squash and carrots. I also did not use as much butter and substituted the prosciutto for bacon. It was delicious, I will definitely make this again!!!

This recipe was delicious! I made a few changes - firstly, this recipe does not need 3/4 cup butter. I used two tablespoons of butter and the olive oil from the pasta and sun dried tomatoes was more than enough. I also added some panko bread crumbs on top. Very tasty.

This was very good. We found that there was no reason to bake this. We ate it as soon as I mixed the veggies and the proscuitto/tomato mixture into the pasta. Some felt there was too much butter used. I think if you use all that butter, you'll find a creamy sauce for the pasta. No, not as healthy as without the butter, but also not so dry. We found this to be delicious. We'll definitely make it again.

This is more of a question: My husband and I loved the dish and the flavor, but with the baking, it seemed to make the pasta tough. What is the purpose for baking or is it necessary? 
Overall great recipe!

I really liked this dish although I tweaked it slightly. I did not use prosciutto or any other meat. I used less butter...a lot less, I used reduced fat Parmesan and did not use 8 ounces, used about 4 ounces, and I used only 1 cup of sun dried tomatoes in oil, and the other cup was a package of moistened sun dried tomato I found in the produce section. I didn't want all the oil in my dish. The result was a tasty dish that was less buttery, oily, and cheesy. I still thought it was really good and my husband devoured it.

This is a good base recipe. I used just zucchini, asparagus, and sun-dried tomatoes. I completely omitted the butter and added three heads of roasted garlic (I love garlic!) and tossed it together. Really easy, really fresh. Yum!

I made this for dinner last night, following the recipe exactly, and we LOVED it!  The kitchen smelled amazing the entire time I was cooking and it tasted like something we could get at a restaurant!  Next time, I may add more vegetables though - they were amazing!  Will definitely make again!

I do not cook AT ALL, but decided after 18 months of watching my boyfriend cook that I should try to surprise him with dinner.  This recipe was easy enough for me to do and was delicious too.  Now he says I can cook more often!  :)  I substituted diced canned tomatoes for the sundried tomatoes and pre-cooked bacon for the prosciutto, and it still turned out okay.

Big hit. I left out the prosciutto and didnt have zucchini.  Everyone loved it. Even the kids. My teenager requested it for lunch the next day. We did cover the top near the end of cooking time since the noodles were starting to dry out. I also topped it with a white cheese mixture. We love cheese. I cut the butter down to amount 1 tbs, just enough to saute the garlic.

I used one stick of margarine, halved cheese and sprinkled cheese on top before cooking.  We added cheese on when it was served.  I sauteed the veggies in olive oil, halved sun-dried tomatoes, added fresh tomatoes.  I would substitute olive oil next time for the butter/margarine and mix in different veggies from time to time.

I would give it 5 stars, but didn't make it exactly the same so that wouldn't be fair. However, it was an amazing dinner. Doubled the prosciutto, peppers, broccoli, and asparagus. Cut the tomatoes in half, and omitted the zucchini. This is all because of my family's preferences. Also, added some shredded cheese I had lying around on top for a final touch. Am definitely making again, maybe with mushrooms as well.
