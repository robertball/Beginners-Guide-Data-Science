These are okay.  They are light for the summer and definitely not very sweet.  I found they actually lacked a bit of flavour though.  In the future, I think I would add even more peaches and perhaps some peach or orange juice instead of the milk.  Be careful if you try these - they do not rise very well, so fill the cupcake papers right up to the top.

Pretty good cupcakes. I first saw this recipe in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. They warned that you need to use completely ripened peaches for best results. I made 18 full size cupcakes. Baked them at 325 for 10 minutes, but they were nowhere near done, so I bumped up the oven to 350 for a few more minutes. The cupcakes are heavy, almost like muffins. Nice peachy taste. The most puzzling thing about this recipe is the frosting - the sugar-to-butter ratio seems waaaay off to me. I made it as written, tasted it and it just seemed super sugary. So I threw in a little more butter and I think it helped.
