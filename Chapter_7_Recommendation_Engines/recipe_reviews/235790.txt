It was good. I would suggest a sweeter apple. You also need to bake about 45 minutes and then turn the oven off and open the door and let sit for an hour before cooling in the refrigerator.

Made it as directed. It's perfect as-is. Ratios/layers are great.

This is a really good recipe ... I used sweeter apples as I personally prefer them ... I added 1 tbsp of sugar to the crust ... added a dash of vanilla to the crust mixture, an additional 1/8 tsp to the cheese layer, and a dash in the topping as well ... used 1 1/3 cup of digestive biscuit crumbs ...  I also made my own caramel sauce ... it was a hit ... fresh and delicious! ... I have also used the cheese layer and crust as the base for a new berry cheesecake that I put together ... that was a big hit as well ... the basic recipe is very good as a platform to showcase your creativity and make a custom cheesecake ... thanks for sharing!

Really delicious cheesecake. It made twice as much streusel as needed, and I needed to nearly double the crust, but I like having a lot of crust on my cheesecake. I tossed the apples in the food processor for a minute before putting them on top of the crust for a more even texture, although in retrospect this probably wasn't necessary.
