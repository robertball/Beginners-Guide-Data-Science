I used the cranberry swirl in a cheescake recipe, it was delicious.  Can't wait to try the ice cream cake.

It was just okay. I didn't think this one was worth the trouble. Lengthy process and time consuming.  The flavor doesn't make up for the trouble to make it, in my opinion. There are plenty of other ice cream desserts that aren't nearly as involved.

Delicious and unusual.  Also too time consuming to make except for very special occasions.  I'd probably double or at least increase the cranberry swirl by half.  I skipped cooking the pistachios in butter, just bought roasted nuts.  Otherwise it was a wonderful mix of flavors, and got by far the most raves of any birthday cake I've made. :-)

I've made this every year at Thanksgiving and/or Christmas for a few years now, and it's always a hit. Love the contrast of the tart cranberries with the sweet ice cream. It is time consuming, especially over the holidays, but I have found it can be easily parceled out over a few days. I'll make & freeze the crust on Monday, do the ice cream layer on Tuesday, add the whipped cream & nuts on Wednesday, and sit back & enjoy it after the turkey dinner on Thursday. That way it's just 5 - 10 minutes per day - much easier to fit in during a hectic time of year.

Made this on Thursday for Saturday's celebration.  Was a huge hit.  Didn't change a thing.
