This is a very pretty dish.  The dressing was light yet very flavorful.  Truely a wonderful summer dish.

Beware, you must LOVE basil! I was also a little worried about using Fishsauce in a salad, because it is quite strong in smell and taste. But the combination of fishsauce, lime juice and sugar was quite good and I eagerly looked forward to the finished dish. And then I added the fresh Thai Basil which I have growing in my garden. It nearly ruined the whole dish for me because in that quantity it was just too overbearing! I will do this recipe again, but instead of basil, I think I'll add some green onions or maybe just a hint of basil. Oh yeah, be sure your onions are mild as well - mine weren't. I also used quite a bit of fresh cayenne peppers and was surprised that they weren't hot. Maybe the lime juice obscured their "bite".

Great use for leftover grilled salmon.  I used thai basil - which I LOVE, although another reviewer found it to be too strong, and added cucumber, also from the garden - tis the season to try to figure out what to do with an abundance of produce!  I did make it a little mild with less chili, and balanced out what to me was too much sour with more brown sugar.  Loved by everybody except our 2 year old.

This is such a simple and delicious recipe.  We eat it once a week.  I prepare the sauce and the salmon the day prior and add it to the mixed greens just prior to serving.  For my kids, I just omit the chiles.

This was delicious. I added some shredded cucumber and a little sesame oil to the dressing. This is a very fast meal if the salmon has already been cooked.

We agree with the previous comment; The best salad ever!So fresh tasting it  made me think of a fabulous cheviche. I suspect the people who gave it less than 5 stars were the ones that replaced some items. Easy to modify to individual taste in regards to spicyness. Another great thing is that you can do all the work in advance, so perfect recipe for entertaining. Great on bib  leaf lettuce and some nice warm bread on the side.. We will be making this one again soon!!

This dressing is perfect for the other salad ingredients.  I used thai chili sauce since I didn't have any thai chilies.  With the real chilies it is probably a 5*

Scaled and subbed. Cubed fish before and pan saut√©ed. Used Serrano instead but will get Thai peppers next time and added some chili garlic paste to dressing. Green onions instead.  Used romaine, iceberg and baby spinach.

We really liked this.  Smell of the fish sauce put me off, but added an incredible, hard-to-define taste to the sauce.  Skipped the chiles.  Also the tomato (terrible this time of year).  Used pesto I'd frozen from last summer--two ice cube tray sized ones.  Used red onion.  Also romaine lettuce.  The flavor is lingering in my mouth as I write and I can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow.

I've had this for lunch twice this week. It is SO good! The only changes I made were to use chili/garlic sauce instead of Thai chilis (too spicy for me), I decreased the amount of basil, and the second time I threw in some partially peeled and thinly sliced English cucumber. I marinated the salmon for about two hours (perfect). Next time I make it, I'll use Thai basil. Thanks so much, Twee!

My fiance loves this salad.  It was funny because he was asking me about it the other day.  So I had too look up this recipe again and I am so glad I found it!  I used a little bit of garlic chili paste to fire it up because my fiance loves everything spicy and instead of a head of lettuce a spring mix salad wilted.  it came out really nice.

Too much basil!1/2 that amount is more than plenty, but the rest of it wasn't as tasty the first time I made it. So instead of having it for lunch, I scraped it off the lettuce and let everything marinate til suppertime.  Then it was delicious! (on new lettuce of course!)

Flavorful salad~ I added red chili peppers to spice it up some more.  Also great if you marinate the veggies in the dressing.

This was really good. I subbed red bell pepper for the chile peppers because we aren't big fans of spicy food. I also subbed spinach for the lettuce and sesame oil for the olive oil. This was even better the next day for lunch.

I think I grossed myself out by smelling the fish sauce too much prior to putting everything together, however, my boyfriend really enjoyed it. He did say thay it needed sonething....a touch of sweet - maybe a sprinkle of sugar?

I found this recipe too salty and I am a salt freak, my husband who does not use salt loved it, go figure.  I added the lettuce to the salad and used cilantro instead of basil.   I could not find any Thai chili so I used Saigon Chili' n Oil Hot Sauce, I used less than an eigth of a teasp, and it was spicy enough.  I only gave it a three because I was not really enamoured with the recipe.  Sorry, but thank you for the posting.

I added 1 cup chopped cilantro. Used romaine lettuce. To make the salad less spicy, remove the seeds and membrane from the peppers. I also used Thai basil.  I grilled the Salmon on the grill. it was delicious.

Good flavor. Needed more zing so don't hesitate to add another chili. And the reader who recommended Thai basil was spot on. We used the salad as a base and each person had their salmon filet on top.

In essence it should be good however, had to add more lime, more sugar, needed more chilli, the basil is all pervading, would be much better with coriander.  The fish sauce is too strong too.  Spent ages doing this and was a bit disappointing.  It needs a clever person to look at this properly and correct the seasoning.

Very good flavor.  Will definitely make again.  Could reduce the Thai Chilies if you don't like spicy and if you don't like a lot of onions in your salad, a half an onion is more than enough.

I liked the concept of this, but did not care for the dressing.  I mixed it with some bottled poppy seed dressing and that was better.  Next time I will just use some other Asian type dressing.  I also added cucumber.

A very nice, light dish with good flavour.  I will make this one again.
