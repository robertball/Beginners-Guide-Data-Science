FANTASTIC. It's easy to make, comes out PERFECT every time. It's nice to have something I can make from scratch, without additives, and not have to rely on something that came out of a box. My whole family loves this cake...even plain with nothing on it...of course, a few strawberries make it even better.
After reading the other reviews, I have some suggestions:
1. Make sure all utinsels used are grease free - any grease can cause your cake to fall.
2. Line bottom of cake pan with wax paper. Before taking cake out of pan, slip a knife around the outside and inside of pan...your cake will come out perfectly. Once out, take the wax paper off the top of cake.
3. If you are seperating your own egg white, remember ANY yoke in the egg white will cause your cake to fall.
Happy eating!

SUPER easy and SUPER yummy.  Scroll down for some great tips on releasing the cake from the pan. I highly recommend parchment paper at the bottom of the tube pan. I also found a GREAT trick for separating eggs.... USE A FUNNEL!!! The whites slip right out and the yokes are kept in the funnel! Just be sure to separate over a separate bowl so that if a yoke does slip through, it won't spoil the whole bunch. Also, the almond extract is a GREAT addition to this cake.

Fluffy and moist, not at all like styrofoam that you get at the grocery. I made mine with half chocolate glaze and half with stawberrys and whipped cream. Both were delicious! Also use Pam non-stick spray when cooking to avoid the cake sticking to the pan.

This was good, I ate 3 pieces! My family really liked it too. The only thing I changed was that I didn't whip the egg whites to stiff peaks. When you make angel food, you're not supposed to whip them to very stiff peaks because that expands the walls of the bubbles to their full capacity, so then they won't rise anymore in the oven. I whipped mine to a good thick foam, then added the cream of tartar, whipped them to soft peaks, added the extracts, then whipped just enough to incorporate them. My batter was POURABLE, I didn't have to scoop it into the pan. Also, when you mix the flour mixture in, gently fold it in with a spatula, or else you'll pop the tiny bubbles and it will deflate. I cooled my cake in the pan on the counter, no bottle or funnel, just balance... and it was fine (make sure you cool it completely!!!). I did use a tube pan with a removable bottom, I also highly recommend that. I served up the slices with macerated strawberry slices and sweetened whipped cream.

Don't be afraid to try this - it's SO good!  I made it and a cake mix version for a family party to compare as a kind of "experiment" - the from scratch definitely won! Though a little more time-consuming, it's not hard at all and definitely worth it.  I always serve with a mixture of lite Cool Whip (1 medium tub)and strawberry yogurt (1 cup) as a center and top layer and each piece topped with fresh sliced strawberries. RAVE reviews every time.

Very simple and you might try different extracts.  I used peach and vanilla.  Very nice.  I really write this review however so that others like me can know that 1 1/2 cups of egg whites translates to 1 dozen large egg whites.  I had just purchased eggs on sale and wasn't sure how many it would take so I thought I'd share this information.  Knowing 1 dozen eggs are required helps enormously.

I thought that this cake would have come out completely different.  I cooked it for one hour and it was a beautiful golden brown, but when i went to take it out of the pan (besides it sticking to everything!) it looked as though it could have cooked 10 more minutes.  Taking the cake out of the pan was a completely different story. It looked like I let my son take it out of the pan with his hands!

I baked it for the time it said and it came out really dry. I tried making it a second time, This time for less time and less sugar, and it turned out better, but still not very good.

This is a good, classic angel food cake recipe. I had leftover egg whites and creme Anglaise from making a big birthday cake, so I used them up in this light-tasting dessert. My only change was the baking method & temp: I don't really understand the reason for the cold oven. From what I was taught, you want to quickly set the cake's structure and not lose the air you so carefully beat into the batter. I baked the cake in a preheated 350 degree oven and started testing the cake for doneness at about 45 mins.

I think this recipe works well. I used it for my science fair project and I worked great. If u want to make it for cupcakes, only bake it for about half and hour though.It also got a little sticky after staying in the fridge. Overall, this recipe is worth making!

Cake did not rise - it stuck badly to the pan.  The flavor is okay, but it wasn't very light.  I was careful with my eggwhites, but for some reason, the recipe did not turn out well.

This Angel Food Cake was AMAZING! my family gobbled it up in ten minutes. I didn't have a few of the ingredients, so I substituted them; Cream of Tartar=1Tbs. Vinegar, and Cake Flour=1 3/4 C. all purpose flour + 1/4 C. Cornstarch. I was a little nervous about the substitutions but they worked like magic! Oh, and I didn't have any almond extract so I used Banana Extract, (It gave it a nice banana flavor) I highly recommend this recipe!

The flavor was good: not too sweet. It was a bit denser than I was hoping for but I made a newbie mistake. "Gently combine the egg whites with the dry ingredients" actually means "fold the dry ingredients into the egg whites." I just decided to go on beating with my handheld. With that change, this would get 5 stars. That being said, this is the first semi-successful Angel Food Cake I've ever managed to pull off...they usually end up about resembling a small white tire!

10 star recipe!!  This is the best angel food cake I have ever tasted!  I've been looking for the perfect recipe, and this is it.  It is nice and moist with that sugary, slightly crunchy top.  When I mixed in the flour mixture it was a  just a little bit lumpy, but it turned out great.  I used the old fashioned tube pan with the little legs and solid bottom, but it came out perfect.  Thank you so much.  Now I won't have to test any more angel food cake recipes.

This is an outstanding cake! I made it exactly as written, and it came out perfectly. What I really love about it is that the egg whites are measured by the cup instead of the usual "12 egg whites." I think this really helps to make the cake turn out well every time...egg whites can vary in size. I didn't read the cold oven part, and it was already almost completely preheated by the time the cake went in. Perhaps it was because of this that the cake didn't rise all they way to the top of the pan and get those deliciously crispy cracks...but that was still ok. Next time I make this, I'll be sure to not preheat the oven. I served the cake with whipped cream and strawberries, and everyone loved it. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe...it was awesome!

Very good cake. I didn't have cake flour, so I used 1 cup of ap flour. I ended up using a dozen of eggs for the whites. I took some advice and whipped egg whites to foam, added crm of tartar and then whipped to soft peaks, then mixed in extracts. It rose beautifully, and has a nice light almondy taste to it. Yum! Will make it again.

Was very pleased when this recipe turned out great the first time I made it.  I used this recipe to use up a carton of egg whites leftover from another recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and processed the white sugar in the food processor so that it was fine.  Then I added the cake flour (I used Swansdown) and the salt to the sugar in the food processor to sift together.  I used a hand mixer to beat the egg whites.  I will make this again.

This Cake is Awesome!! Be sure to use a spatula to Gently mix the dry ingred. one cup at a time into the egg white/cream of tarter/vanilla & almond extract. Just until mixed. Line your cake pan of choice with Wax Paper for easy removal and easy cleanup! The first time I made this I used a mixer to add dry ingred. and my cake did not rise. Serve with icing, or Fresh/Frozen Strawberries and Ice Cream! Or Flavored Whipped Cream! Be Creative!

This cake was incredible!  I have tried to make angel food cake on several occasions, and have not been successful.  This was a hit by my family, wonderful alone, with coffee, or with some fruit and whipped cream on top.  Great as is!

This cake is wonderful. I will never go back to store bought angel food cake/box mix again.  This is so much better- much more texture and flavor. I used egg whites from a box and added cream of tartar just after the eggs started to get foamy (how I learned to do it).   I was worried when mixing the dry and wet that the grainy texture or loss of egg volume would be a disaster but it was perfect.  I didnt have a tube pan, just used my bundt cake pan.  I cooled it upside down on a beer bottle until it was completely cool and it came out with just a little bit of loosening of the edges with a knife.  This is a keeper!

Love this recipe.  It makes fantastic Angel Food "Cup"Cakes as well traditional.  I've had great luck with removing the cupcakes from the pan.  When we don't have strawberries, I love pouring peach coulis on top of it (my recipe is on AllRecipes if you'd like to give it a whirl!).

This was my first attempt, and I used it to make cupcakes, as I have to portion things out in my diet, but it was lovely. Light and fluffy - just what it should be - and so easy! I have a friend who has been put on a low-fat diet due to gall bladder problems, so this is something we can all enjoy. I am going to look into doing a gluten-free version, and I used fructose instead of sugar.

Awesome recipe, I can see this becoming a family favorite in our house. Although, I would dial back the almond extract a bit, perhaps 50%.

Very yummy but the directions for cooking just under 60 minutes is way off. Next time I might try cooking for just 45-50 minutes. In addition, I did not grease the pan (per the directions) and it was somewhat difficult to remove. I saw a recommendation to use wax paper at the bottom of the pan. I will try it next time I bake this cake. Otherwise, yummy cake just a wee bit dry from the 60 minutes of cooking.

Superb!!! I have  never made an angel food cake before, but this is SO easy and OH SO good! It is a bit denser than some other angel food cakes I have had, but that's what makes it so good! Served it with fresh blueberries and strawberries and whipped cream made from scratch. I Highly recommend this recipe!!!

This was great. I prefer angel food with my berries and this was hands-down the best I've had.  It also provided lots of laughs when my cousin tried to invert the pan on a glass and forgot that it was a two-piece pan.  Had it not been for that, it would have been beautiful too.  (FYI -- we just used vanilla, no almond and baking time was about 45 min.)

My mother in law loves Angel food cake so I decided to make her one from scratch. This recipe was great, but it's not something I'd make very often, too many egg yolks. haha

I do not recommend this recipe. Like other reviews have said, this cake was EXTREMELY DIFFICULT to get out of the pan!  When we tried to eat the cake, it was somewhere between chewy and hard/crispy (you can only imagine)!

I am not sure I made it right. It did not get as high as a store bought cake mix. It took quite a while for the eggs to fluff. I used Land-0-Lakes egg whites and they were stiff when I started putting in the flour/sugar mix and I did stift that 5 times while the mixer was working on the whites.

I made this recipe last night for my Husband's birthday.  The cake tasted wonderful.  It was light and fluffy.  I substituted extra vanilla for the almond extract due to personal preference.  It was wonderful.  I added a thin chocolate icing to the cake and it tasted heavenly!

I used this recipe to make cupcakes for an impromptu party yesterday, and they came out very nicely.  The key to this cake is to keep an eye on it and keep checking it so it is not under- or over-cooked.  If a toothpick inserted in the top comes out clean, the cake is perfectly done.  Everyone especially like the almond flavor that was added to this simple cake.

I never believed that sifting flour was really worth my time until this recipe. Although it's time consuming, I add the dry ingredients just a few teaspoons at a time and it turns out much much better.

This turned out perfectly, crusty edge and all. I baked it in two 8" pans lined with parchment paper, and that helped them come out of the pan easily (after running a knife around the edge, of course). The bake time with this method was about 50 min.

This was really good. I served it with cool whip mixed with strawberry yogurt (as advised by another reviewer) and it turned out great. I did use cooking spray to coat the pan and it came out easily. I am making it for friends again tonight and adding fresh fruit to top it with.!

Thank you so much for recipe - I poured over several different suggestions, but opted to try this one (and it was my first time making an AngelFood Cake as well) - worked wonderfully.  Was a little *eggy* tasting at first, but that disappeared the following day - maybe that's the way all homemade AF cakes are ?? not sure as I'm a novice here (grin)

This recipe came out PERFECTLY. I didn't change a thing, just cheated a little and bought cartoned egg whites. I sell baked goods at a market and this one in 'cupcake' form and as a whole cake sells faster than I can make it. Try putting fresh strawberries and strawberry syrup on top and it's to die for.

I made this cake today to be used in a fruit trifle.  I'm not devastated by the outcome since it will be cubed and mixed with other ingredients, but generally speaking it was a flop.    I used splenda blend and carton egg whites, both which could have had a direct impact on the final results.  The egg whites never formed stiff peaks - even after mixing for about 15 minutes, however they formed soft peaks.  I baked the cake in a bundt pan (a quality non-stick) and I used a rubber spatula to loosen the edges - the cake came out of the pan perfectly.  The flavor is good, it's just very dense.  Closer to a pound cake.  I probably will not make this again.

Fantastic and so easy, I've never made a cake from scratch and this was a huge success.  I don't have a sifter so I mixed the dry ingredients with a whisk for several minutes.  I also used regular flour...I'll buy the cake flour next time to see if it's even better.

Oh bummer...didn't turn out for me. I read all the reviews. I am, however, new to baking and did you a blender instead of beaters. batter texture felt really gritty and after only a short time in the oven, it was burnt.

Oh man was this cake delicious. Tender, moist (even after 4 days!), soft, not crumbly but not styrofoam like most store bought angel food cakes... It is possibly one of my favorite cakes I've ever made, and I have made quite a few. I followed the portions of the ingredients exactly, but I changed the order a little bit. I beat the egg whites until they were white and foamy, then I added the cream of tartar and flavorings. THEN I beat until stiff peaks formed. I folded the dry ingredients and egg whites together. The cake rose beautifully and the top was a wonderful gold brown. However the top of my cake did not crack like many angel food cakes do. I also let it cool, upside down on a wine bottle, for over an hour. One important note: don't mix in a plastic bowl, and wipe everything you use to make the cake down with a little bit of white vinegar. This will ensure no fat or left over grease gets into your egg whites-- any fat will cause the cake to fall. If you do these things, this recipe come out just wonderfully. I topped it with a shiny dark chocolate glaze, it was decadent.

Getting an angel food cake out of the pan is the toughest part, regardless of the recipe.  If you baked yours in a bundt cake pan, turn the pan upside down and let the cake “hang” on the neck of a glass bottle for at least 2 hours before you attempt to remove the cake.  Should be a lot easier.

Awesome Cake! Even without using powdered sugar. Mine tasted almost like cotton candy.

This recipe has earned me some major respect amongst my friends. Even gotten helped make some money on the side. I recommend sifting 6 to 7 times if using cake flour. If regular all purpose flour I would sift 12 times. All in all this recipe is a true delicacy that makes any cake in the box be shamed.

Followed recipe exactly or so i thought.  Put into cold oven and set to 325.  In 20 minutes smelled burning and had to take cake out as top was turning black.  WHAT DID I DO WRONG?

Great Angel food cake!!!!  It takes a lot of egg whites (I had some in the freezer - took about 9 eggs) but it is totally worth it!  Next time I may try it with the carton of egg whites you can buy at the store.  Thanks!

I have made a lot of cakes but never Angel Food. I did purchase a pan with removable botton (Thanks for that info.). It turned out perfect, even my wife liked it and she does not like Angel Food Cakes. The only problem I had to make a yellow cake to use the 12 yolks but I only have one cake to eat later (yellow).

Delicious, light, and moist. I followed the advice of another reviewer and made sure not to let any of the egg yolk get in the egg whites. An easy way to remove egg yolk is to put the egg in a bowl, take an empty water bottle, squeeze it and hold the opening on top of the yolk and then unsqueeze it. The yolk will suck into the empty water bottle, separated from the egg white.

This is the single best Angle cake I have ever eaten or made! All you have to do it follow the directions. This is the first recipe I have taken from this site that I didn't want to add my own twist. I see the other reviews and yes you should never let any yolk get into your whites, they simply won't work. Don't over beat. I have made this cake about 10 times in 2 months and the last time I made I left it on the KitcheAid for too long and it was way to dense. When made correctly it is light and airy.

WONDERFUL----I never tried the cold oven method for  any cakes and I was  very impressed. I have never had an angel food cake rise over the top of the pan and stay quite as high.  The texture was light and fluffy and moist, everything an angel food cake should be.
             The only thing I changed was double the almond as it was to go under pitted sweat cherries and cherry vanilla ice cream.
              Anyone who had any trouble with this cake must have  done one of two things wrong. 
             If the bowl, beater spatula  had the smallest greasy film the egg whites will not rise or will be unstable and collapse.
              Or if the cake is rubbery or tough, the batter was over mixed: better to be lumpy than over beaten or mixed.

I do a good amount of cooking and baking, but this was my first attempt at making a home-made Angel food cake. There is definitely a huge difference in taste. I followed another reviewers suggestion and lined the cake pan with wax paper, I also used a butter knife to loosen the edges from the pan wall. It turned out absolutely fabulous! I will definitely use this recipe for my Angel Food cakes! Thanks for sharing  :)

Have to give it a five - without even tasting it - because it came out looking great even though I used egg whites that said "not recommended for angel food cake/will not whip" (and some didn't) and a bundt pan without the removable bottom!  I can only imagine how good it would be if I actually did it right!  (But it's hard to imagine how it could be much better)

I used a 9x13 pan, mine was ready in 40 minutes. Also, 1/3 bag Dr. Oetker backing powder is a must, if you don't like to take chances.
It came out perfect!

Pretty good for my first try at homemade angel food cake.  I was torn over which recipe to try.  I used this one because it called for cake flour.  It wasn't as light and fluffy as I thought it should be, but that could be my techniques and not the recipe.  I've made belgian waffles lots of times, so I am pretty good with egg whites.  I did use a preheated oven. All in all, it was quite delicious.    

My son wanted chocolate frosting on it, so I used the recipe on the label of Hershey's cocoa, halved it, for just a very thin layer. 

I think next time I will try the Heavenly Angel Food Cake recipe.  It called for powdered sugar.

I have no idea what I did wrong I made cupcakes they taste like scrambled eggs and sugar and they have an odd consistency. I think I should've maybe taken them out of the oven a tad earlier and not omitted the cream of tartar :/.

I put some in the fridge overnight to see if they end up tasting better tomorrow.

edit: They really lose the egg taste overnight. So I changed this from 2 to 4 stars.

WONDERFUL cake! I made it for 4th of July for a neighborhood party and everyone loved it! I reccomend you make sure you have at least 12 eggs for this cake though. Great with any fresh berries and whipped cream (I colored the whipped cream so it would be patriotic :-) )

I wasn't crazy about the texture of this cake, but the flavor was very good.  Mine turned out a little dense/tough, but that might have been because I used all-purpose flour plus cornstarch as a cake flour substitute. I did sift 5 times as instructed and tried to fold the dry ingredients as gently as possible, but perhaps I just overworked it.  With fresh berries and some cool whip, it was still delicious!

i was a little disappointed with the cake. it didn't rise like i thought it would, but the taste was great. i made a pineapple frosting to go with it, and it was a hit. this was the first time i've made a 'from scratch' angel cake, so perhaps i need to practice a little more.  thank you!!

I made two angelfood cakes with the same recipe. One I baked in a preheated oven as someone suggested and the next one I placed in the cold oven and then turned on the oven to 325 as the recipe stated. The cake that I put in the cold oven raised more than in a preheated oven. Just an experiment that I wanted to do.

I made this cake with gluten free flour and it came out wonderfully! Everyone in my family loved it and was dying to have more. This cake goes great with strawberries and cream, but is very moiste and can also be enjoyed by itself. Deffinetly five stars from me

This is the first homemade angle food cake I have ever made.  It is great!  I followed the recipe exactly even used the cake flour and gentle folded in the dry ingredients.  It really is the best cake I made.  I don't understand any bad reviews but can only think that our oven temperatures could vary.  I could not find my angle food cake pan so used two loaf pans an that worked good.  Thank you so much for this recipe.  It is in my "recipe box" on all recipes.com.  From a mom who does not bake much.

This recipe worked fine. It rose up and it was not dry. Something about it just wasn't what we were looking for. I think it is just a matter of taste. My husband and I both rated it 3. Our son gave it a 7.

So easy to make when you simply have to buy eggwhites in a container... I love angel food cake. This recipe is so easy to make and much tastier than the "box" version!

I had a ton of leftover egg whites from making a cookie recipe (that called for 16 egg yolks!), so I decided to finally try my hand at making angel food cake from scratch.  I'm so glad we tried this one!  The recipe worked beautifully.  I did make a special trip to the store for cake flour.  I sifted the dry ingredients 5 times.  I carefully folded dry ingredients into wet (yes, it did eventually combine with this gentle stirring).  I started it in a cold oven.  In making the recipe as is, it came out beautifully.  The almond extract was just the right amount for our family.  The "crunchy" bits were especially yummy (waaaaay better than storebought cakes!).  This one is a keeper and my kids and dh are begging me to make this as often as the whim hits.  I admit, I put off trying this for so many years because I was really intimidated based on reports that angel food cake was just too hard, but this recipe made it flawless.  I also appreciated reading the tips below.  Now I have friends begging me to tell them how to succeed in making angel food cake!

Definitely a family favorite! I'll be making this often, upon request, I'm sure. Mine didn't stick at all, after completely cooling in the pan (a one-piece pan.) So MUCH better tasting than store-bought too! Of course it is! Isn't everything if it's made correctly?!?!

I LOVED this recipe!! Didn't change a thing. It was a wonderful hit for the 4th of July. I used it with a strawberry tunnel cake recipe and made from scratch whipped cream. I decorated it with blueberries and strawberries to give it that true patriotic effect. I will never buy angel food cake from the store again!

This was excellent!  I followed this recipe exactly as written.  I really liked the addition of Almond extract.  And its supposed to stick to the pan.  That way when you invert the cake until cool, it stays in the pan and stays light and fluffy.  Use a small spatula to go around the edges to release from the pan.  Be gentle, its angel food cake :)

This was WONDERFUL!!!!  I bought egg whites at the store and only sifted it one time.  I discovered I need a new sifter.  Baked it just 50 minutes and it was WONDERFUL.  I served it with strawberries, but  think it's better all on it's own.  It didn't get very high though, but that sure didn't make any difference to the taste.  Thanks!!!

Lovely cake.  Beautiful crunchy sweet top. So fluffy! We carefully beat for stiff peaks and gently folded the whites into the dry.  I continues to gently mix until combined. So much better than the grocery store!

Made this tonight to serve as a base for strawberry shortcake. I followed the recipe exactly (well, I didn't sift the flour five times...) and it was absolutely *perfect*! My wife and my mother both declared it was the best cake they'd ever eaten, and I have to admit it that, even though I made it myself, it was truly wonderful. So easy -- I used store-bought egg whites from a carton -- and truly delicious; I can't believe I never bothered to try an angel food cake from scratch before. I'll never even consider eating a store-bought cake again.

I've made this twice this week. The first time I didn't beat the eggs long enough and it didn't rise very much (but was still good). The second time I beat the eggs to between a "soft peak" and a "hard peak" and it was perfect! I followed other reviewer's suggestions and added the cream of tartar after it got foamy and the extracts after soft peaks formed. I tried using vanilla and almond extracts, and then just vanilla extracts and I prefer vanilla only. I "iced" the cake with sweetened whipped cream with chunks of chocolate (I prefer dark, but milk is good too), and served macerated strawberries with vanilla bean on the side as suggested by another reviewer. Awesome!

I love this cake better than any other one I have ever eaten!  My dad grew up eating his mom's angel food cake for his birthday, and when I made this one for him, both he and his brother exclaimed that it was the best one they had eaten in ages.  Making this cake with whipped cream frosting is pretty simple to make and clean up is so much easier than with a traditional cake and frosting!

flat....make sure you blend those eggs very well until foamy. even after that it was really dense and sticky. maybe it needs to be cooked longer. Wax paper helps greatly with sticking to pan

Followed the recipe to the letter as I usually do whenever I try one for the first time. The cake turned out to be dense but very delicious. It took some time to get it off the tube pan once it cooled down. So glad I placed a wax paper cutout before pouring in the batter and baking. At least I only had to deal with the sides. The kids loved it. They say its the kind of cake that's already quite a dessert even without any frosting or glaze. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Great recipe! Super simple and open for some substitute ingredients (in oppose to what some others argue). I used baking power in place of the cream of tarter, only vanilla extract, and about half a cup of brown sugar in place of some of the white sugar- the cake turned out beautiful! Using a bundt pan is recommended by me one hundred percent, and don't be afraid to add some frosting around the top A nonstick bundt pan is the solution for the adhesive nature of the cake. Beginners shouldn't be too scared to do this because it's easy! Piece of cake!

I have made this twice now, rave reviews both times.  I love the almond extract in this one.  And I, too, like that it measures egg whites in cups not by how many eggs.  In fact, I broke the yolk on the very first egg today, so I was a little short on egg whites.  I used the adjust servings feature to make it equal how much I had and it automatically calculated adjusted ingredients to match.  Cake turned out perfectly.  Even better than the first time, and I was pretty tickled at that one.  Two changes - I too started out with a preheated 350 oven, and I did spray the pan with nonstick spray.  I ran the knife around the edges and it popped right out.  Wish I remembered to take a picture!  Served with fresh berries (strawberries, blackberries, blueberries) and sweetened whipped cream. KEEPER!

I baked it in a cold oven for the time it said and the cakes turned out great, both of them. I will keep this is my recipe box since Angle Food is my favorite. This is just like the angel food cake I made years ago and lost the recipe. Very easy. I didn't have cake flour so just used all-purpose flour and it turned out great. Just make sure you sift it the 5 times. I made 2 of these and frosted with the fluffy white frosting.

Very tasty! Be careful not to overwork the batter because it will end up dense.

I followed the recipe to a T. This came out to be the best angel food cake I have made. Not too sweet and it came out of the tube pan perfectly. I did use parchment paper on the bottom as one suggested. Then I used this cake to make a trifle with berries and bananas  Looks darn delicious!

This recipe turned out excellent. I did not have any cream of tartar, but I used baking powder instead. It turned out moist, fluffy, and way better than what you get at the store. I ended up using 10 egg whites for the 1.5 cups required for the recipe. I topped it with strawberries and vanilla greek yougurt, yumm!

I followed everything in this recipe: sifting five times, using cake flour, putting the cake in the cold oven... nope. The cake came out of the pan fine for me, but it did not rise very much and it was chewy and rubbery. I tried to get some moisture into it with a strawberry glaze and whipped cream, and that made it okay.  Waste of time, effort, and money. I would have been better off buying angel food cake from the store.

I Added my own Spin to it! I used Meyer Lemon and Key Lime zest in the flour. I also used the juice of the two fruits. Glazed it with zest , juice and  poedered sugar.

Thought it was a great little recipe.  Made it once thought it came out just fine.  Second time I added some chopped maraschino cherries and grated semi-sweet bakers chocolate.  As far as getting the cake out I like to cool my cake up side down on top of an old empty champagne or wine bottle, then give it a good whack on a towel covered wooden cutting board, does the trick for me

The batter from a boxed angel food cake tastes gross before it's baked. The batter from this recipe tastes much better. The cake turned out light and moist. Perfect.

THIS is absolutely FANTASTIC....I do not know what THOSE people are talking about who said it turned out awful.  I followed the directions to a "T" and it  made my husband's birthday cake perfect last week and will make my husband's father day cake even more SPECTACULAR today!!!!  The ONLY problem I found was that I ATE THE REST OF THE CAKE THE NEXT DAY because it was sooooo GOOD!  AND I am one fussy eater!  I like this version with 1 3/4 cups of sugar MUCH better than the version with 1 1/2 cups of sugar.  Egg whites and flour NEED the extra sugar to give it that sweet taste.  

I WILL NEVER ever buy a store bought angel food cake again!  My daughter had bought one for this past Memorial Day weekend and I could not eat the cake at all...ended up only eating the fruit placed on top.  

Three cheers for another recipe added to my recipe box.  

Thanks again!  IT truly TRULY was wonderfu,l and I am indebted to you for a wonderful recipe!

I made this cake for my mom's 60th birthday. Angel food is her favorite and the cake mixes and store-bought cakes just don't cut it with our family.  
I painstakingly followed the directions and eagerly awaited the tasting.  We decided to sneak a small tasting before we had the birthday meal. OH MY! It is "wonderful," as spoken by the birthday girl. This recipe will be used many times in our family. Thank you!!

My husband loves angel food cake and wanted one. So, I looked up the recipe and this is the one I came too. This turned out great and he was very happy. He said it was better than any store bought cake. It was very moist. Will be making this again.

This cake was great! Hubs said it'll be his new birthday request every year. It rose beautifully and the top, which became the bottom, was crunchy and gave a great texture. I used egg whites from a carton without issue, and made sure to fold everything together gently. I was worried it wasn't mixed enough but I think less is more with this recipe.

Easier than I thought it would be.  Did struggle getting it out of my bunt pan.  I cooked it for about 55min after it got preheated. Used around 10 eggs.

No changes however since I’ve used a bundt pan about twice in my life, I couldn’t understand how or why to invert. I read over other recipes and learned that yes, balance on the stem and you do this so the cake won’t sink. 
My grandkids (1 & 4)  couldn’t get enough.  Could hardly believe they were ask for more cake and not the blueberry/strawberry and whipped cream topping.  Excellent recipe.

Half the sugar should be beaten into the egg whites before folding in the dry ingredients. You do not need a cold oven. Go ahead and preheat the oven.

I never knew how easy it was to make this. I should have used cake flour and just automatically used the other and realized it later. It was still very very good and light. Not too sugary. I might do that again if I am out of cake flour because it was still fine. I also used a bundt pan and it worked. Okay, one mare thing, I used twice the vanilla and no almond flavoring. Nut allergies. Thank you for making this easy.

My daughter (12) made this all by herself, calling me for some clarifications. The taste was really great, but we had a few hiccups. 

Notes: Egg whites should probably be room temperature. Hers were cold, and didn't whip up correctly. Second, the cake must be baked on the LOWEST rack. The top of hers burnt within 20 minutes of going into the oven.

I was surprised how easy it was to make this cake.! It was my first time one, and I was worried that I would over whip the whites and that my dry ingredients weren’t fully incorporated. It was exactly like the discription, sweet and light! My only grip was it wants easy to take out the pan, and yes I used the pan recommended. I understand the reasoning of not greasing the pan but there’s has to be a trick. Any suggestions?

DO NOT USE PAM OR GREASE PAN - just had to say that loudly! In order for an angel food to rise it has to "climb the pan" DO however feel free to cut a parchment circle for the bottom! I have not tried parchment on the sides of the pan. If you insist on using pam your cake will not rise as much -also cool upside down...or your cake may collapse when cooling. Leave in the pan and invert on a bottle to cool. I use an olive oil GLASS bottle ...glass BC pan will be hot!! Let cool COMPLETELY (2 hours) then Run butter knife anywhere cake touches the pan outside and around tip and it will pop right out!

Well, the flavor was there but unfortunately, this cake did not quite rise to the occasion, if you get my drift.  I used no substitutions and followed the recipe to the letter but sadly, the cake did not rise.  The texture wasn't bad and my family ate it without any complaints about this dense, 2 inch so-called angel food cake.

A quick note: I saw that a reviewer recommended spraying your tube pan with cooking spray. This cake was taught to me as a small child by my Mom, and she explicitly told me NOT to grease the pan; the cake needs to ‘climb’ up the sides of the pan to reach the extraordinary heights that Angel Food cakes reach!

I subbed almond extract for strawberry extract and sprinkled powdered sugar on the cake once it cooled. I also plated it with fresh strawberries in a clear dish and placed the clear dish in the center of the cake. I preheated my oven to 350 degrees and baked for 40 minutes. This was my first time baking anything from scratch and it was absolutely blissful!

This is the first time I have ever made an angel food cake.  It is well worth the time and effort.   It stuck to the pan, used butter knife around sides and still came out beautifully.  Will make again! Thanks for the recipe!!

Perfect! Easy to make and delicious. Definitely use cooking spray on sides and line the bottom with parchment. No idea to cool upside down. Came out of the pan with no problem. Don’t listen to the negative reviews. They either A- don’t know what angel food cake is, B- did it wrong, C- used dirty/greasy bowls/untencils, D- have never removed a cake from a pan before. 

This recipe is perfect

A super spongy, delicious treat!!! This cake has been a birthday staple in my house for a long time. Before you make this recipe double check that you have enough eggs!!!! It requires about a dozen. When you take the cake out of the pan take a knife around the edges first. From there you can just turn the cake pan upside down, hit the bottom and it should come out just fine.

This is our go to dessert. Paired with fresh fruit and homemade whipped cream, it can’t be beat. Super easy and I love that this recipe uses a measurement of egg whites. I raise my own chickens so my eggs are all different sizes and the yolk to white ratio varies as to the chicken and the age of the egg.

This was my first time making an Angel Food Cake as well as baking in a tube pan.  This recipe is wonderful.  I loved the sweet crunch on the top.  I will definitely make this again but I think I may double the vanilla extract and omit the almond extract next time.  Not sure yet because the almond extract did give it a special taste.

I've made this a few times now and love it every time! Only change I made was to cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and I only used vanilla extract since that's all I had on hand.

I made this cake for the first time for our July 4th celebration. It was easy to make and tasted great, much better than store bought. I added 1/2 teaspoon almond flavor and served in in a trifle bowl with berries and whipped cream. Delicious!

I had no problems making this cake and followed all directions, I am only giving it 3 stars because It was a little to chewy for us and not a lot of flavor , Probably something I did when beating the egg whites not enough or too much . I probably won't make it again.

It is still too sweet even after I have reduced sugar to one and an half cup. Also it is very chewy and my son said it seems like a bread than a cake, After cover with a layer of chocolate whip cream overnight and it then got a bit softer and moist. It is also very difficult to get it out from the pan.

Pretty nice recipe... a bit too sweet for my liking though. However, I was scared to reduce too much sugar because I wasn't sure whether that would affect the texture.

The cake went nicely with vanilla whipped cream frosting. Topped it with some fresh strawberries too.

I made it exactly as written.  Served it with berries and 8 women said it was the best Angel Food Cake they had eaten in recent memory.  Store bought is inedible once you've had this cake.

Recommend adding waxed paper in bundt pan to ease release. Otherwise, perfect texture and flavor was great.

Perfect! This recipe is very easy to make and tastes 100% better than store-bought Angel Food cake. I loved that they tell you 1 1/2 cups of egg white and not just a number of eggs. I used a disposable plastic knife to run around the outside edges and then, because the plastic knife was bendable, was able to pry it under the cake and jimmy it out of the pan.

Definitely different.  Flavor was very good.  But consistency was odd.  Didn't rise to the top of the pan but browned and properly cracked. Served day 1, company liked it and wondered what kind of cake it was; that says it all.  Day 2 it hardened even though properly stored and got sticky.  Not a keeper in my book.

This is fantastic! I’ve made it 3 separate times. If you prefer a less sweet cake I suggest cutting the sure by about 1/4 cup. Also, it may just be my oven but I cut the temp down to about 320 and the cook time to about 45 min or less. It edepends if you like that thick brown crust or not. But even recipe as-is is awesome. And really easy.

I didn't change anything and the cake turned out to be the best! My husband was saying how it tasted just like the one his mom used to make for his birthday, and he was right. It was very fluffy and not dry. I made a whipped cream frosting and everything was delicious together. Highly recommend this recipe!

Eggscellent!!!  This was my first attempt at angel food cake and it was not only much easier than I expected but it was delicious!  I inadvertently preheated the oven, so followed the advice of one reviewer who baked at 350 degrees in a preheated oven for 45 minutes.

This is a really good angel food cake recipe,  starting it in a cold oven was a really good hint.  It cooked perfectly.  I actually took the 1/4c of flour out and added 1/4c coco and added orange rind,  made a syrup out of the orange juice and added it to chocolate whipped cream.  and called it chocolate orange angel food cake.  Another time I used gluten free flour and it came out great.

I have made this twice.  Both times the top burned.  First time it came out good aside from the burnt top, this time it flopped on one side.  It doesn't state to put pan on lowest rack, but I definately would.  I should have thought of that the second time I made it.  The flavor is very good though.  I made it for a  trifle.

The sugar is a little alarming, but the cake turned out fantastic. I can't stand the styrofoam version of this at the supermarket and this was a great recipe to get my fix of angel food cake. I served it with a summer fruit compote and it was a hit.

I grew up making angel food cake with my mom and made it into my twenties. It was a go-to dessert staple with strawberries and fresh whip cream. I had not made it in over a decade and wanted to make it for my family. I could not find my old recipe and tried this one. I used parchment paper, eliminated the almond extract, and cut down on the sugar just a bit. The baking time was perfect, but for me, it seemed like there was too much flour in the recipe. It was a little too cakey and heavy for me, not light enough. I'll keep looking for a lighter recipe.

This was definitely not the light airy angel food cake it should have been.  My mother made her recipe and I made this one.  The ONLY difference was that this one said "combine ingredients" and she said "ingredients must be folded together".  The flavor was amazing but the texture was heavy and extremely dense.  

Another thing that was a nightmare was that it stuck to the pan. 
 I followed instructions to a T and it stuck pretty good. 

I might try it again and fold ingredients and spray pan next time to see if it works.

I followed the instructions exactly, except I didn't take the cake out of the pan right away. When I did take it out, it was dense and heavy, like a pound cake. It was only 2 inches tall. It did have a good flavor, though. I will try to make it again, and will take the cake out of the pan.

The cake turned out well and it was very easy to make. I did grease the pan and it was easy to remove from the pan. When I checked the cake at 50 minutes, a few parts of the cake were very dark. I will start checking it at 40 minutes next time.

Delish! the only change I made was to add 1/2 cup of the sugar very slowly as the egg whites were being whipped, this is the only way I've seen an angel food cake being made so I was afraid to deviate from that technique. , the cake was like heaven in my mouth! Made a maceration of strawberry and also real whipped cream to the top, but really this cake could stand alone. The real test will be when my grandmother comes over tomorrow and tries a piece, she's the ultimate judge, she's made MANY a delicious angel food cake in her time. *edited to add:* Grams tasted the cake today, she said the "texture is perfect, good rise, but a little sweet". I will make this cake again but I'll try a different recipe first....will keep looking for the "perfect" cake for Grandma. :)

This recipe is the best.  So easy!  Fortunately I have a double barreled sifter so I sifted the dry ingredients 4 times not 5 but even still, it worked fine, came out of the angel food cake pan fine, and tastes sooooo much better than store-bought cakes.  Much better texture.  I used Kroger Break Free egg whites instead of separated eggs (didn't want the leftover yolks to deal with) and they whipped up perfectly!  One small container is about 1/4 cup more egg white than the recipe calls for but I used the whole container anyway.

This is the best Angel food cake we have ever eaten.  I had made a Norwegian cookie that called for 12 egg yolks so looked for a recipe to use the whites.   Allrecipes has always had good recipes so when I found this Angel food recipe decided to try it.  It was very easy to make, delicious, moist and lots of flavor.  It wasn't like store boughten cakes that are dry and have no flavor.  Will make this again and again.

I'm not sure if I did this right  but the cake never seemed to rise at all while cooking and ended up being very heavy.  The flavor was still very good but the texture an consistency seemed a bit off.

By far the best angel food cake I have ever tasted. It is  worth all the hard work. The steps need to be followed exactly (DON'T SKIP THE SIFTING!!!), and this is not a beginners cake, but when done correctly it comes out perfect. I ended up substituting corn starch and regular flour for cake flour, which works fine for me and still produces a fluffy light cake.
HOW TO MAKE CAKE FLOUR:
Simply take one cup of flour and remove 2 tbs of the flour. Then add 2 tbs of corn starch. Sift 5 times and you have cake flour! works like a charm ;)

All things considered this was a good cake. It was my first time making angel food cake, won't be my last with this recipe! In all honesty though, it wasn't a dream come true for myself. I put the batter in one of those spring form pans...(rookie mistake) for the first 20min batter leaked out. ending result was a very short thick cake (A very good short and thick cake). Will try again soon with correct pan haha

I'm going to say this recipe is easy. But I wasn't able to actually bake the cake. After I whipped the eggs I turned around and lo and behold the oven was icy cold with the gas on. The pilot light has gone out!  Since I had started this cake earlier in the afternoon but realized I didn't have enough eggs (it was actually heating, then). I guess I'll try it in a day or two!

I made two cakes following the directions exactly, one in a bundt pan and the other in a 9-inch springform pan (I am making a trifle and wasn't sure how much cake I needed). Both came out  just beautifully (I let the cakes cool completely before removing from the pans). I don't love the almond extract and will use less next time, but the texture is amazing and it's just a lovely, simple recipe!

My previous recipe called for a combination of powdered and granular sugar. Sorry mom, but this one is so much moister (so it's not a word...). I left it uncovered on the counter for a couple of hours before serving, so it was no longer sticky. It tastes like a big marshmallow. So good. And yes, it sticks to the pan. All angel food cake will.  If you don't have a tube pan with a removable bottom....don't make it.

This cake was a family favorite and now it is demanded every Christmas. It is easy to make and delicious. I sprinkle some extra sugar on top to make the crust more crunchy. It is so good.

GREAT CAKE! but.. if you don't have cream of tartar -  just substitute fresh lemon juice or white vinegar for the cream of tartar. For every 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda in the recipe, use 1 teaspoon lemon juice or white vinegar. As an example, if your cookie recipe calls for 1 teaspoon baking soda, add 2 teaspoons lemon juice instead of the cream of tartar.

Best AFC recipe ever! Light, moist, fluffy, flavourful, gorgeous! Anyone having issues with this recipe is doing something wrong. Make this cake and you'll never go back to a box!! It's perfect! I made it today, realized I was out of almond extract, so I used coconut extract and believe it or not, it was even better! Thank you to whoever submitted it first!

Delicious!  First time making an angel food cake.  So simple.  Used egg whites from a carton.  Turned out perfectly.  Lined bottom of loose-bottom pan with parchment. Baked as recipe stated beginning with cold oven for 1 hr. but at 300 deg. as I have a convection oven. Will definitely make this again.  Has pronounced almond flavour.  Could substitute all vanilla extract.

Everyone loved this cake! I didn't have cake flour so I used the flour/cornstarch substitute. I also made glaze to go on top (other recipe). The only hard part was getting it out of the bunt pan. I suggest cooling it then using a butter knife to scrape along the sides then cooling it more in the fridge. Patience!

Delicious!  I made the angel food cake on Friday, we first ate it on Saturday.  it was perfect - moist, great flavor and texture.  Still fresh and moist on Monday but not much left.  I have a hand mixer and you have to be patient as it takes several minutes for the egg whites to form stiff peaks.  I lined the bottom of the pan with parchment paper for easier removal.

This was a great angel food cake recipe. I substituted coconut extract for almond, but otherwise I followed it to a T. The key was as one of the reviewers mentioned, you must beat the whites into soft peaks (when they are at room temperature), then briefly beat the extracts and cream of tartar in, then FOLD the dry ingredients in gently. If you over process (or underbeat) the egg whites, the cake will not rise. I also found I needed 45 minutes not an hour in the oven.

Love this recipe!  Very easy to follow.   I'm pretty sure I didn't beat the egg whites long enough but it still turned out deliciously.   I added some flavored jello(dry) to my cool whip to compliment the cake.  (Kool - aid works too)

Turned out great the first time I tried it. I didn't have a sifter so I just used a slotted spoon and shook it out several times. Guess it worked well enough, the cake rose and had a nice crust on it. It was a little more dense than the store bought that I've had before, but the taste was great and it was moist.  With the left over egg yolks I made a sponge cake!
I've been looking for recipes that use lots of eggs as I raise my own chickens. I've also read that the eggs should be room temperature, not chilled. I've tried this several times now as I'm practicing to make my daughter's wedding cake. I tried one time adding chocolate chips and marichino cherries. Doesn't work well. The chips are too heavy, you have to use shaved chocolate and the cake turned pink.

Delicious angle food cake.  I followed the receipe almost exactly (didn't have almond extract and so I substituted amaretto), and the result was a delicious, slightly moist angle food cake that rose nicely.
If you are new to baking, the trick may be to gently, a little at a time, sprinkle the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and blend by hand.

Too much sugar, not enough salt, not enough cream of tartar.  Left out the almond, wanted a traditional flavor.

I used gluten free all purpose baking flour instead of reg flour. Came out great. Use frozen strawberries and raspberries mash together and add sugar to taste. Wonderful.

I was looking for a recipe that was not so guilty with added fruit.  3 pts in WW.  It was delicious and moist and easy to prepare.  I put parchment on bottom for easy release. Will definitely mark as tested and true.

I made this today and it came out delicious!  However, I only  baked it for a little over 30 minutes and put a lil extra vanilla & almond  extract and it came out great.  I also dusted the top of the cake with powdered sugar to make it look pretty. All my boys and Husband loved it.  I think the key is to not over bake the cake.

Followed the recipe almost exactly as it is!  I didn't have almond extract so I just used 1 t vanilla and it was excellent!  Very easy to make.  I was nervous about not spraying or greasing the pan, but I left it ungreased like the recipe said.  It came out perfectly!  Try this...you will not be disappointed and you will never again buy one of those styrofoam cakes they sell in the store!

Just made this Saturday and I gotta say, this recipe as is is a winner!  I didn't change a thing and it was wonderful.

I did use 2-9x5 loaf pans as I don't have a tube pan and wanted to share...parchmented the whole pan and it was a breeze.  Bake time was closer to 45-50min though.  This recipe is going in my binder, it's so good!  My only thing might be to reduce the sugar to 1 1/2c. but truly the recipe is dynamite as is, delicious!  (Takes about 10 eggs if I do recall to get 1 1/2c. egg whites)

I love this recipe. This was my first attempt at angel food cake that did not come from the store and it was exactly what I expected. I have made it several times over and gotten good results every time**note: do not use cupcake liners if making cupcakes out of this recipe. They will stick and half of your cake will end up on the wrapper!
