My mom makes a salad like this for Thanksgiving and I love it!  I like this version because the mayo dressing is "jazzed up" with the garlic and curry powder.  I threw the parm cheese right into the dressing and put cheddar all over the top of this salad.  I omitted the mushrooms, used an orange pepper, and cooked about 7 pieces of bacon and crumbled them.  I also used light mayo.  This one is a keeper!

As stated many times over previously . . . this is a FABULOUS recipe.  My family all 
loved it.  I cut it in half and it was just enough for 8 people as a side dish.  I didn't
change a thing but my curry powder wasn't the freshest so would probably add a 
bit more next time.  It is great to have these recipes for food items that can be
made ahead of time . . . they are such time and nerve savers when entertaining.

This salad is SO good, but it's the dressing that makes it EXCEPTIONAL!  I skipped the mushrooms and celery, and used 1/2 parmesan cheese and 1/2 cheddar cheese on top to give it some more color, and then used imitation bacon bits for convenience.  I used red onion instead of green for more color, and chopped the water chestnuts first before adding.  I will make this salad again and again!  I especially love that it keeps well in the fridge if we have leftovers.

This salad was good. Different from the other layered salads.  The dressing makes this one stand out!  I did omit the mushrooms, used red onions instead of the green onions.  I mixed the parmesan cheese right in with the mayo and added shredded cheese to the top. Yum!!

This was ok, but had too much lettuce.  I think  twice the eggs and bacon may have made it better.  I make a similiar salad, but build it in a 9x13 glass dish; that way the dressing is distributed over more of the salad ingredients.

Wow the dressing really does make this salad stand out from the rest of the layered salads. Delicious!! I added extra hard boiled eggs, used 6 slices of cooked crumbled bacon, and red onion instead of green onion. The salad was a hit. But FYI don't mix the dressing til the last minute as salad doesn't hold up well once dressing is mixed in. The salad is great will make again.

Of several different variations on layered salads that I've made, this is my new favorite.  The combination of ingredients is great, I didn't change a thing even though I am not a mushroom fan and considered leaving them out, but I loved them in this.  The extra flavors in the dressing are just enough to make it stand out from the usual basic mayo topping often used in similar recipes... next time the only changes I might make just for my personal taste would be to add just a bit more of the garlic and brown sugar to the dressing, and maybe a bit more chopped egg in the salad.  I misread the layering instructions and instead of only one layer of each of the veggies, I did two layers of each, and had it in a clear rectangular container, so it didn't look as "layered" as it would have if I had done it right, but still turned out perfectly.  Made it the night before a potluck at work and it went over very well, but we had so much food there that I did have some leftovers to bring home, and the salad stayed fresh and crisp tasting even to the next day.

Great salad! I substituted FF sour cream for the mayo with excellent results. I forgot to put on the parmesan, and knew immediately after I tasted it that something was missing. The salty parmesan is necessary to balance the sweet dressing on this salad. The dressing with the FF sour cream would also make an excellent party dip.

This was a favorite at my party last Christmas and again in  the
 New Year, which I made, by special request.  Added some slices of beets and red
pepper. The dressing made the difference.   fantastic!!!

This is a favorite.  Everyone loved it and cleaned out the dish. One change I made was substituting fresh broccoli floweretts instead of peas.  It was a big hit.

This was an interesting salad; very crunchy and the dressing made it sweet & spicy.  I like mushrooms, but didn't like them in this salad.  I don't think they added anything to it.  I would use broccoli instead or any combination of your favorite vegies.  I used only half the dressing and put the other half on the table for those who wanted it. I had leftovers this morning and the salad was just as crisp and fresh as the night before. The dressing would be a nice change for a dip with your vegie tray.  I would make this salad again.  Thanks!

This salad is very fresh tasting and crunchy.  We had it with our Easter meal and everyone loved it.  I left out the green pepper and used fresh parmesan cheese in the recipe.  Very good!

Okay, so I combined different recipes but I'm rating this one since it's the dressing I used (mostly) except used 1 cup Smart Balance Omega Plus mayonnaise and 1/2 cup light sour cream instead of 2 cups regular mayonnaise.  I made this in the morning, served it about 12 hours later and didn't thaw the peas.  Worked great.  Also, I used 13 ounces of gourmet salad blend, cauliflower, yellow bell pepper, green onion, celery, water chestnuts, and had to mash it all down to fit into a HUGE trifle bowl with 8 ounces shredded reduced fat cheddar on top of the dressing.  I served bacon on the side so anyone who didn't want it didn't have to eat it.  Even people who don't like vegetables emptied their bowls.  Even with the smaller amount of dressing, it's still very "goopy" and no one noticed the lower fat substitutions with all the yummy stuff in it.

This is good.  I just layered lettuce, green onions, peas, mushrooms, bacon and used cherry tomatoes from my garden.  Also added cheddar cheese.  I think it is great, but my husband thought there was too much mayo. I might try it again and halve the amount of dressing.  He was right- it was a bit heavy on top.  But the dressing is what makes this.

Another hit with family and friends. They were going back for seconds on the salad before the first serving of the main course. Added an layer of olives and did  not use the top layer of lettuce.

This recipe was a great hit. But I personally found that there was too much dressing at the top of the salad so next time I make it I will try including the dressing in with each layer, or at least some of the layers, just to break it up a bit.

This salad is great, I made several for our son’s graduation party and we didn’t have any leftovers.  I omitted the mushrooms and used grated cheddar cheese to put on top of the salad.  The convenience was wonderful, I was able to make the dressing a day ahead and then just assemble the salad on the day of the party.

This was a very good salad.  The vegetable ingredients can include anything you have on hand.  I threw in some cucumbers which I seeded to get rid of the excess liquid. (They needed to get used up before they turned to slime)  This made a lot; great for potlucks and family gatherings.  Next time I will add more curry to the dressing, but then I love curry.

Excellent. The hardest thing about trying new recipes in my house is getting my meat & potatoes husband to try new things. I made this without letting him know what is in the dressing. He liked it, but as expected complained about the green peppers. I've changed it and replaced the green pepper with small pieces of cauliflower. Other changes: 8 eggs instead of 2, twice as much bacon and parmesan (fresh grated)  and 50% more dressing.

We really enjoyed this salad.  I made it with lite mayo, and didn't notice a difference from the full fat stuff.  I thought this was really good, althought I think the flavors will definitely be better if made the day before.  Thanks for a great new salad idea!

My family thought it was terrific.  I added 1 cup shredded cheddar.  Definitely an improvement of an old favorite.  I think I'll add some smoked chicken next time and make an entree out of it.

I LOVE this salad!  As many have said, the dressing is what sets this apart.  Other vegetables can also be used, such as broccoli, cauliflower, and red bell pepper.  I am vegan so I sub vegan mayo, bacon bits, and parmesan for the regular.  I omit the eggs.  Fabulous twist on the regular seven layer salad!

We loved this salad - even my finicky 10 yr old enjoyed it and asked when we can make it again.  The curry gives the dressing such an unusual (and wonderful!)flavor. We saved time and some of the mess by microwaving the bacon in layers of paper towels until it was crisp.  This would be great to take to a pot luck or dinner pary.  A keeper!

Excellent...I used fresh peas from the garden, red pepper instead of green, added grated cheddar and left out the eggs (personal preference).  I also added 1/4 cup of milk to the dressing.  It was a hit with all.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This has become my go-to recipe when I want a layer salad.  However, I usually tweak the vegetables depending on what's on sale and what I'm in the mood for.  I rarely use celery, as I think it's too bland for a salad.  I'm also not a fan of peas, and I don't care for the mushrooms in this salad (although I love mushrooms).  I try to make it more like a traditional layer salad: lettuce (usually greener lettuce if I know it will all be eaten the same day), bell pepper, carrots, green onion, cauliflower or broccoli (whichever is cheaper), grape tomatoes, REAL bacon or turkey bacon, and sometimes cheddar cheese.  I substitute for low-fat mayo and double the curry in the dressing.  Making these change, I think it's fantastic.  As is, it's just mediocre (expect for the dressing, which is darn good even with less curry).

The seasonings in the dressing is really what makes this salad different than other layered salads. I like this one the best.

It's a great salad recipe to make ahead and bring with you on a picnic. The dressing was a nice touch of sweet and tang that the adults liked, the kids were not so thrilled with it. the only thing that I would change is the amount of salad dressing placed on top. I cut back onb the amount and found it still to much.

I made this for a dinner I cooked for some friends. I have to admint that I was a little hesitant to try this and so was my wife. I'm not a big salad person but after the first taste I couldn't get enough! I am a big lover of bell pepers so I added some orange and red peppers for color and it turned out fantastic.

VERY DELICIOUS, THE DRESSING MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE!  I USED COOKED BACON, AND INSTEAD OF BELL PEPPER, I SUBSTITUED RED PEPPER. GAVE IT MORE COLOR.

I enjoyed the salad but the dressing... i did not like.  I had to scoop most of it off.  And with the last layer of lettuce and then putting the dressing on top, it made the lettuce all wilty and soggy.

Took this to a potluck and got rave reviews. I am addicted to the dressing in this recipe! Doubled the dressing so I could have leftovers for myself, but used greek yogurt and sour cream to cut the mayo taste, then added fresh lemon juice. I mixed the dressing up a day before serving so the flavors could blend, then poured on top of the salad right before serving (did it separately for easy transport). Such a versatile salad recipe - I used what I had on hand (iceberg, red cabbage, shredded carrot, cucumber, Vidalia onions, green peas, egg, and cheddar cheese). Didn't even miss the bacon, but might try it next time. This will be my go to potluck recipe from now on. The extra dressing was yummy on a toss salad with grilled chicken, craisins, and almonds.

It was really good.  I'm not a huge curry fan, but the amount added wasn't too much.  I think I'll try what other reviewers suggested of doing chili powder rather than curry next time, but I'll make it with curry again, too.  A good mix of vegetables, tasty.  And the dressing covered a lot of it, so my kids thought the mushrooms were chicken.  I just kept smiling at my husband :)  Nope, they're mushrooms.

THE ABSOLUTE BEST LAYERED SALAD I HAVE EVER HAD!!  Dressing was YUMMY!  Next time I might double the dressing and do a layer in the middle!!  With all the layers of "stuff" it could use it in the middle too!!  I got many many compliments on this one!!!

Everyone seems to love this salad.  We make it for many family gatherings and it gets eaten quite quickly.  You can make the salad/dressing separately earlier in the day and combine them just before dinner.  Makes the dinner rush a bit easier.

I made this salad back in May 2006 and again yesterday for a Memorial Day BBQ.  This is a great recipe!  I did use 6 eggs instead of 2, iceberg lettuce in a bag, red pepper instead of green pepper, and red onion instead of green onion.  I think red pepper and red onion give it more color instead of everything being green.  I made the salad and dressing the night before, but didn't put the dressing, parmesan cheese and bacon bits on top until the next morning.  I layered it in a 9 x 13 dish.  Everyone loved this salad!

This recipe is a big hit in our whole family.  I just use whatever colorful salad ingredients I have on hand - including cucumbers, red and yellow peppers and red onion.  The dressing is great.

The curry in the dressing knocks this out of the park. I've been making this for many years.

This was an excellent recipe.  I altered it based on someone's review.  Changed curry pwdr to chili pwdr, reduced mayo to 1 1/4 cups and added 1/4 c. sour cr.  Changed gr pepper to red to add color.  My own suggestions:  Omit celery, changed gr onions to purple and reduce to 1/2 c.  Less chopping & more color.  Changed mushrooms to corn and with the chili pdr it made it more Tex/Mex.  Added 8 slices of diced bacon, an essential change for flavor.  Added 1/2 c. shredded sharp cheese.  It was really delicious and super fast to make.

This is a GREAT recipe for Easter! We make it almost every year. The nice thing about this salad is you can put whatever veggies in it you want and it's so colorful and pretty served in a trifle bowl.

One change my family makes to this recipe is that instead of 2 cups of mayo, which I think is too much, we use 1 cup of mayo and 1/2 cup of sour cream.

Deeeelish!

This just did not work out for me, the mayonnaise dressing did not have a ton of taste.  I would prepare the salad again and leave the dressing off, but preparing it as is, everyone in my household ended up eating a sandwich.

This salad is a great side dish.  I made the salad on a Sunday and I did not put the dressing on the salad. The salad stayed fresh and since I didn't dress it, we were able to have it as a side through out the week.  The dressing is definitely a highlight of the recipe.  I used imitation bacon bits to save time as others have suggested.

I am always asked to make this wonderful salad.  Because of different tastes I use many different vegetables then what is listed. What I use is bag lettuce, a red onion, mushrooms, broccoli, califlower, peas, egg, real bacon and cheddar cheese. I have to say what makes this salad is the dressing.  That always stays the same no matter what veggies I use. This will be in my collection for many years.

We love this recipe! Make it all the time, and never change a thing. I only sometimes remove the curry for my picky eaters, but we LOVE the dressing. Thanks for the simple and go-to recipe.

When I added 1/4 cup of Splenda to the mayo and blended it well, it was a Great Salad. Be sure to completely seal the top with the layer of dressing so that the air can not get into it and cause the lettuce to brown while refrigerating.

Everyone enjoyed this salad.   Usually a tough crowd, but all were impressed.  Made it with one head of lettuce. Used chives instead of onions.

I usually make a 7-layered salad that is very similar to this, but this layered salad tops the other one!  The only things I changed: omitted the mushrooms, instead of curry powder, I used 1/4 tsp chili powder, and instead of bacon bits, I fried and crumbled bacon.  Delicious combination.  Will definitely make this again.

Dressing is very good.  For me it was too much dressing, hubby said it was just enough for him.  Personal taste I guess.  Will keep the recipe and make a again.

I served this to four generations of my family but did not tell anyone is contained curry powder.  Everyone loved it!  I thought it could use more spices, but I generally like things spicer anyway.

Absolutely wonderful. My husband is a VERY picky eater, He loved it, as well as some friends eating over, they asked for the recipe. I changed some of the ingredients, used carrots and omitted celery and green pepper. ?lso, added a layer of bacon under the dressing and cheese over the dressing. My husband says it's a keeper- thast deserves 5 stars!

I was drawn to this by What A Dish's beautiful photo. My husband was at first dismayed that he wouldn't be using bottled salad dressing; then he was then pleasantly surprised after tasting the salad. I left out the mushrooms, bell peppers, and peas (otherwise he wouldn't touch it!), but even with the omissions, the salad was delicious. I loved the addition of curry powder to the dressing.

I just made the dressing, not the salad, and it was delicious! Tasted better tossed with the salad than on it's own. Salad was just field greens and avacado, dressing was the perfect compliment. I did make it a couple says ahead of time and I think that helped the flavors blend.

This is a great salad! The dressing is the best part. My friend says she hates peas, but loves them in this salad. I double the ingredients and place in large foil pans.  I put the dressing and cheese on top a few hours before serving.  I am making three trays for a golf tournament, which should feed 65-70 people.

Very good taste...way way too much mayo..next time I will cut that part of the recipe in half.
