I took this recipe with me on vacation to share with my 5 yr old. They turned out terrific! We rolled them in Honey roasted Wheat Germ, they tasted just like the ones I had as a kid. My only suggestion is to chill the mixture before rolling. It was hard for my son to keep the round shape, due to the stickiness.

I made this and then after the peanut butter balls were done I decided to dip them in melted chocolate chips. They were a BIG hit.

These tasted great but oozed into blobs instead of staying round. I chilled the dough for several hours before rolling but as soon as it touched our warm hands they turned to goo. I used creamy Jiff. Maybe a different peanut butter would work better?

I remember making these in 1st grade as a class project and always enjoyed them after that.  I love them and my son does too.

I just made these and was disappointed.  I was expecting a creamy ball but these are gritty.  Did I do something wrong?  I didn't have to chill before rolling; mine were fine to roll right away.  I also rolled some of them in powdered sugar hoping to add a little sweetness, but it didn't work.  I rolled the rest in regular sugar thinking that at least maybe it would keep them from sticking together.  These were very easy to make, I just didn't like the gritty texture.

These are a good little snack. I like that they are fairly healthy. I used a natural peanut butter but added a few milk chocolate chips to help bind the mixture together as well as add a little flavor. These make a great base if you wanted to add another type of chip or nut to the recipe. Make sure to refrigerate these to set as they can be a little soft.

These are wonderful. I added 1 more cup of powdered milk, froze them and dipped them in chocolate.

These are the exact ones I ate as a child. I couldn't get enough of them at that time. However, one tiny bite was more than enough for me. They didn't have enough peanut butter flavor. All I could taste was honey. This will sound weird, but I don't care much for marshmallows, and that's all I could think of while eating these. If you want a tasty peanut butter treat, try Clark Bars by mom2frankandy. They are delicious!!!!!

These taste great but I can't figure out how to make them retain any kind of shape. I wanted to dip half of mine in chocolate but I don't think that's going to be possible. I've put them to chill in the fridge overnight so I'm hoping today they might roll out better. My advice is keep them in the fridge up until the moment of serving. They are gritty - because of the powdered milk but strangely I kind of like that texture.

Too much honey!  Also, very sticky and soft.  Next time I will use 1/4 c or maximum of 1/2 c honey, maybe about 2 - 2/12 c milk powder, and possibly add some rolled oats until it has a good, stiff shape.  I bet they would be great with melted chocolate chips drizzled over them!  Unless you have many, many kids to feed, I would halve this recipe as well.
