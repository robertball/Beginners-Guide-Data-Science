This looked interesting so I made them just to make them.  I placed the buttered baguettes directly on a cookie sheet.  Too old fashioned for a silicon mat, I guess.  They were wonderful!  I catch hubby snacking on one every now and again.  I was afraid the mustard would be over powering, but it was perfect for me. To eat plain, they could use a little garlic or something, but they would definitely make a nice base for pate or spread just the way they are.  Thanks for the recipe Chef John!

I made this for a party to go along with a meat and cheese charcuterie platter and it was gone quickly. Next time I'll have to make twice as many. We liked that the mustard flavor was not too overpowering.

I made Chef John's Duck Rillettes, which was very good but I didn't like my selection of crackers from the pantry.  I took CJ's advice and made these crostini (well I supervised my daughter who swears I can't correctly spread anything onto anything) for the remaining duck.  They were perfect for the duck and my family agrees that they would be great for anything needing to be spread onto crostini.
