This is a fun and pretty salad for a hot summer night's dinner. I added a little more mayo because it didn't look like enough... but BEWARE! When it chills, it "creates" more liquid. I had to drain it. I should've followed the recipe exactly! I would definitely make it again.

I added about a tablespoon of finely minced sweet onion to this recipe and it was very tasty.  I agree with the other readers, though, that it lacked something.  I think maybe a teaspoon of lemon juice would add a little zip.

Well, it was quick and easy i'll give you that much but I didn't care for it that much and my kids didn't like it one bit! It sat in our fridge forever! I won't make this recipe again unless my step-mom is coming for a visit!

My husband and I love this cole slaw.  However, my 6 year old did not care for it.  We are from the South where everything has mayo or gravy in it and I just knew he would love it.  Will make again and again for me and my husband.  Who knows, the next time my 6 year old may like it!

I was excited to try this but it came out too mayo-flavored for me. I thought I'd never make it again but I think the idea's great and I might just fuss around with quantities.

I enjoyed the recipe and would make it again. It was something different to take to a summer picnic and very easy to put together. It did seem like it was missing something.

Loved this reciepe. didn't give it 5 stars because followed exactly it isn't quite good enough. I added cilantro and green peppers as someone suggested and also added 2 tbs sugar, 2tbs apple cider vinegar, chives, celery seed and pepper.  This is a great base reciepe that was fun to play around with. will definately be making again.

What a fantastic coleslaw recipe. The flavor is wonderful. No need to alter this recipe in any way. It's perfect as is. Thanks for sharing your recipe with us Denyse. It was a big hit with the family.

Found this recipe after having a coleslaw at a restaurant that we loved - the chef gave us his recipe, without any quantities, just the ingredients- he did not know how to scale it down from the jumbo size can/5 heads cabbage, etc. The only difference was that he added white vinegar & sugar. Perhaps this is what was "missing" for some reviewers. I made it with the vinegar and it was very similar to the one we had at the restaurant.... I always make coleslaw ahead of time, let it chill then taste test to see if it needs any sweetening or any tang from more vinegar.

Great! It was so very simple to prepare and I was afraid it would just taste like mayo, but my family and I loved it.  My new favorite coleslaw recipe--thanks!

I combine this with the Hawaiian Coleslaw recipe and made a modified version for my Luau themed 30th birthday party.  I also added a can of mandarin oranges, drained along with 1/4 tsp ginger.  Overall it was pretty good, and went well with the theme, but I think it could have used more flavor so next time I would play around with the measurements.

I really liked this recipe! It doesn't take the place of traditional coleslaw for me, but it was a nice accompaniment to the jerk chicken we were having. I also felt it was missing something and added some celery seed and raisins...perfecto!

would it be possible to post these reviews with the most current on the recipe page instead of reading an 8 year old review first - go from most current to oldest
Too much salt - it just draws the water out of the cabbage and makes it mushy and runny

It turned out good. The only thing I would have changed would be to do it without the ginger. The ginger had a strong flavor I didn't care for. Without it it would have been great. I also took someone's advice and sliced a pinapple lengthwise, gutted it and put the coweslaw in it for display. Loved it! I had a Luau party and everyone thought it looked great!

This Coleslaw is fantastic!  I added around a cup of chopped apples as well (an idea from another recipe), and didn't use probably half of the mayo......i'm not a huge mayo fan though!  Great concept, and it deliver's great flavors too.  Thanks:)

If you add a little green onion, Cilantro,and olive oil to this recipe; it gives it a nice taste. I'm not a fan of cabbage, but I ate it readily, and hardly noticed.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is very similar to my cole slaw recipe, except I use less mayo (i don't measure it, just til it looks right), and I also add a dash of pepper and 1/4t Celery seed.  I won't eat cole slaw that doesn't have pineapple in it, it really masks the fact that you are just eating mayo & cabbage.

As written, this recipe is just okay.  Like other reviewers mentioned, it is definitely missing something.  I added a splash of vinegar and that brightened it up a bit.  I like the idea of the pineapple to sweeten the slaw, but it just feels like it needs...more.

Good, but needs a little doctoring up.  We added raisins and sliced almonds the first round.  The next we plan on adding some apple cider vinegar, and maybe some crasins.

Wow!  I cut this to serve 4, figuring there would be plenty left to put in my husband's lunch tomorrow.  But, NO!  My husband and 18 year old son plowed right through the whole bowl.  I barely had a taste.  I used prepackaged cole slaw mix that had carrots in it.  That made this super easy. Since I have 1/2 can of pineapple and bag of shredded cole slaw mix left over, I will make it again tonight.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

I have made as listed and also made adding some pickled ginger and then made another time adding poppy seeds.  This is just an all around easy and good tasting recipe.  I am going to try the cilantro and peanuts as suggested this time.

I added some Splenda to make it a little sweeter.  Make it acouple of hours ahead of time and stir well before serving - the flavors marry!

I did not have a carrot, and did not have enough pineapple, but my husband and I both love this recipe.  At first I was not sure one cup of mayonnaise would do for the size cabbage I had, but was pleasantly surprised by how well it covered.  It took persistent mixing to get it spread evenly. A note to the person who was surprised by the liquid in the bottom:  that always happens when you add salt - salt extracts liquid from the veggies.  Thanks for a great, simple, easy to make recipe!  I've been wanting one like this for a long time.  This will be one of our staple recipes.

Great recipe. Like others said, I added a splash of lemon juice, 2 teaspoons sugar, 1/3 cup craisins and about 1/4 cup coconut flakes.

I work with mentally  individuals in a home setting. One of my co-workers makes the best cole slaw which is a dish I never cared for until I tasted her's. I've wanted to ask her for the recipe but instead I found this one and it turned out great. The only change I made was adding 1/2 cup of sugar.

This was really good.  Instead of sugar, I used no-sugar-added APPLE SAUCE and dried cranberries.  Also, I added some walnuts to add crunch.

This was pretty good. I added 4 tbsp of sugar to sweeten it up. I also used a can of crushed pineapple in heavy syrup to sweeten it up more. I really hate a strong mayo taste and this recipe has it if you don't add sugar.

Liked how simple this was compared to the great flavour. Added some other veggies to it as that's what we had on hand e.g. red bell pepper, carrot, onion, cabbage, pineapple. The only downside - that I have no idea whether it tastes better the next day as none lasted that long :)

I love this version of coleslaw the best.  I have been making it for years.  With one exception I have never used carrots but it sounds good.  I use mini marshmallows in mine also.  Very good.

So I took this recipe and made it over the top. I used 1/2 head shredded cabbage, some carrots, some chopped almonds, craisens, toasted coconut, cilantro, chunk pineapple, and a dressing made from half mayo and half vanilla yogurt with 3tbsp of coconut white balsamic vinegar. Hubby said it was too sweet and not tangy enough. Maybe next time I'll use Apple cider vinegar instead. It was still really good.

This recipe fell short of my expectations. I made it a second time. To jazz up a mundane affair I added a bit more "aloha". 3/4 cup chopped green onions, a splash of tabasco, and a dash of red pepper flakes and 1/4 cup coconut milk. Much better.

We also thought this recipe needed a little something.  So, we added chopped Mandarin (drained), and chopped walnuts.   The flavor (tropical), is greatly enhanced.  Yum!

Stunning Fridge Cleaner!
I used the recipe mostly as is.  Leftover cabbage head from St Paddy's.   Used fresh chopped pineapple chunks from the fridge and other zip bag items that 'were getting there'.  Added a l/4 finely chopped sweet onion I found, and some finely chopped celery that was languishing.  A 3/4 bottle of Kraft cole slaw dressing was hanging around. I used that with a splash of sherry vinegar, 2 tsp celery seed, 1/2 tsp celery salt, a few grinds of pepper and 1 tsp curry powder.

Maybe I need to post this because it is unbelievably delicious even before it marinades.   

Thanks for the kick start on this great coleslaw!

I took this to a family get together and found it was a nice change from regular cole slaw.  I took others' recommendations and added 2 tsp. of sugar and a splash of lemon juice.  I added flaked coconut to some of the left overs and mixed in some dried cranberries.  I liked it better with the coconut and cranberries.
