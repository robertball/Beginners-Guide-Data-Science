My family enjoyed this dressing. I wanted to try something a little different from what we usually make and came across this recipe. I had a bag of polenta in the pantry that I needed to use and this sounded good. I did have to change it a little bit. I didn't have any fresh summer savory so I subbed dried savory, I also was out of white pepper so I just used some fresh ground black pepper. I used a pound of sausage just because I didn't want the leftovers. Everyone really liked it and the only complaint was that the dried pears were to sweet, so I would probably use fresh next time. Loved the nutmeg! Thanks!
