I knew I could trust this recipe because I prepare cod loins like this routinely with consistently excellent results.  Cod is a mild, flaky white fish that is not expensive and is absolutely reliable in my experience (i.e., not fishy).  Prepared this way it is tender, flaky and perfectly done, but obviously the cooking time will depend upon how thick your fish is.  I have never added wine to the pan, however, and decided to give it a try.  While I didn’t find it detracted from the dish, it didn’t add anything either – so I would say drink it instead. I used bread crumbs instead of “buttery round crackers,” as I generally don’t keep “buttery round crackers” (such as Ritz) on hand.  I added enough melted butter to moisten the crumbs, along with fresh minced garlic, parsley and rosemary.  (Yum)  I gave the fish a little salt and pepper before topping with my seasoned bread crumbs, then popped it into the oven for 20 minutes.  In other words, I skipped the two-step process directed in the recipe as I didn’t find it at all necessary.  As it always is, this was delicious. I served it over wilted spinach, tho’ I would have loved it with some pasta with garlic and olive oil too.  (I was disciplined tonight since Hubs is out of town)  For those not confident making fish, this is a great choice.  For those who ARE confident making fish, this is a great choice.

OK, found this recipe and tweaked it a bit to solve some of the problems that other people had mentioned.  Here's how to kick up the  flavor and get a less mushy texture..  I use a ream of whole wheat RITZ crackers.. crush them up, throw in a teaspoon of onion powder, teaspoon of garlic powder, 1/2 tsp fresh parsley, 1 tsp basil, and 1/2 tsp of oregano.  Mix those all together,two dashes of salt, dash of black pepper.  Next melt 2 tbsp of butter with 1/4 cup of SUTTER HOMES CHARDONAY (this is very important..don't use just any wine) in a small dish or measuring cup.  I line my pan with foil, spray with a non stick cooking spray, put the fish down flat in the pan.  Pour the melted wine/butter over the fish.  Next evenly pour the breadcrumbs on top of the fish.  Pat down lightly.   Next you melt two tablespoons of butter, and drizzle evenly on top of the breadcrumbs.  Lastly, sprinkle a little more black pepper and bake for 23 minutes at 400 degrees farenheit.  This comes out perfect! No mush, nice and tender, flaky and VERY flavorful!

I've made this twice in the past 3 weeks, tweaked slightly to fit my tastes.  I used italian bread crumbs instead of crackers, adding melted butter and garlic to taste.  I omitted the wine, and made it even easier to prepare by skipping the 2 step process. I simply laid  the cod in a buttered baking dish, sprinkled with a little lemon pepper, patted the breadcrumbs on top,  then gave it a little squirt of lemon juice.  Popped in the oven for 20 min and voila!  Perfection!

This was super simple and delicious! LOVED the buttery crumb topping and the wine really gave this a nice flavor. I thought this could use a bit of salt, but that's my personal preference. I forgot to add the green onions, but I'll try to remember to do that next time (not that it needed it, IMO). I will def be making this one again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was an incredibly easy recipe, and the results were great.  My husband, who doesn't usually like fish dishes thought it was really good.  I did use Italian seasoned bread crumbs in place of the crackers, because I didn't have any crackers on hand, but they turned out fine.  I would definitely make this dish again.

This was very yummy and so easy!  I used cooking spray instead of butter to coat my pan (healthier option).  I had cod filets instead of loins, but 20 minutes was all it took.  I didn't have fresh parsley on hand so I mixed dried parsley in with the cracker mixture.  I added a minced clove of garlic too.  I seasoned my cod filets with a little salt/pepper before adding the topping.  I would recommend putting the topping on right away, and cooking the filets for a total 20 minutes uninterrupted.  I think the topping would get a little crispier that way.

This is a perfect ten recipe! I followed the recipe with the exception of the baking in two stages. I just combined the ingredients, then pressed the mixture onto seasoned cod filets, then baked at 400 degrees for 20-25 minutes. Oh, and instead of the buttery round crackers, I used panko bread crumbs, and boy was this delicious! I served this with brown rice and steamed broccoli. This is going to be a regular in this house.

The fish does, indeed, come out flaky and good.  I saw another rating that used bread crumbs, so I did the same. Also, I substituted olive oil for the butter.  The recipe has too many steps.  I sprayed the pan, then drizzled with olive oil. Placed cod in pan, drizzled the cod with olive oil, sprinkled the crumbs on top, poured wine around cod, squeezed lemon on top of cod, baked for 15 minutes.  Because we did not use the salty crackers, we noticed the fish needed salt.  Will add salt next time.

EXCELLENT! Prepared entire dish, then baked about 20-30 min. Added shredded Parmesan and green onion to the cracker mix. FANTASTIC!

My 8 yr old and I had fun in the kitchen together with this one.  Due to a heart-healthy requirement for our family, we baked the cod in a olive oil sprayed pan.  Then after the initial 10 min, we brushed it with the squeezed lemon and 2 T of butter then topped it with chive/garlic pita crackers.  Twas DELICIOUS.  Served with garlic frozen french beans sauteed with garlic and tomatoes. Also, new potatoes boiled then topped with olive oil and dill.  Thanks for sharing.

My family was unable to eat it. First of all, it needs more baking time. Secondly, the texture was smooshy and the crackers became soggy. We rarely eat cod fish so I was looking for a recipe to bake in the oven with my asperagus and potatoes. What a disappointment. Next time I will fry the cod or broil it.

I used plain panko crumbs and spiced it up with onion powder, garlic powder, Mrs. Dash garlic and herb blend, green onion and parmesean cheese.  Mixed 2 tbs of melted butter and just oil in the pan for 2 lbs total of cod and sea scallops. I breaded the seafood but next time will only cover the top as the bottom was mushy. I added lemon juice and forgot the wine and baked at 400 for 20 min then broiled for 1-2 min for a YUMMY crispy topping. Very easy!

Simple and delicious way to bake cod!  It's very important to use loins rather than filets. Seems like many of the negative reviews were due to overcooked or mushy fish which most likely means the fish was too thin for this recipe.

This recipe was super easy and delicious! I have two picky children (one doesn't even like cod fish that much) and they LOVED it! I did add a few more ingredients into the crumb mixture before layering on top of the cod... 
1 full chopped green onion, 
1 Tsp. Garlic Powder, 
1 Tsp. Paprika,
1 Tsp. Dill Weed,
¼ cup Parmesan Cheese,
 
Served with Creamed potatoes and broccoli and/or baby carrots! DELICIOUS!!

Awesome recipe! I did things a bit different based on the reviews. I lightly sprinkled salt and pepper on the fish (both sides). I then melted butter and then rolled the fish in the butter coating both sides. I added to each fish fillet minced garlic (half a clove per fillet). I placed the fish in a baking dish, added bread crumbs on top followed by lemon juice. Baked for 25 minutes at 400F and turned out great! SUPER EASY and FAST!!

Nice simple and delicious. I substituted the crackers with an italian breadcrumb panko breadcrumb combo and substituted the wine with italian dressing. The panko gave it a nice crunch. My 2 yo and 1 yo boys were crazy for it!

Best baked fish recipe I have tried in a long time!  Based upon many of the reviews: I added garlic, parsley and rosemary to the breadcrumb mix (instead of the crackers), with olive oil instead of butter, mix went onto 2lbs of cod fillets, with salt, pepper, lemon juice on them first, and wine added to pan.  Baked 25 minutes.  Polished off by the whole family for second time in a week ... and they generally don't like fish :)

FABULOUS recipe!! The flavors were just the perfect combination--the lemon, butter and white wine obviously the most important. Wow! I've done lemon and butter before (who hasn't?) but I had no idea what I was missing by not adding white wine in the mix! The ritz crackers were great also.  I didn't measure the ingredients, but I did eyeball them and try to keep the proportions about the same as called for. The only actual change I made was that I didn't have green onions or parsley to garnish with, so I omitted them.

The fish was wonderfully moist and infused with a great flavor.  I will be making this again.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of that I used gluten free crackers rather than the crackers recommended.  I recommend putting the crackers in a sealed baggie and crushing then pretty finely.  They will stick to the fish better in smaller pieces.

Not bad once you go used to the smooshy texture.  After about  one filet, was getting tired of it.

Delicious!  My 10 yr old twins & husband loved it and asked for more.  I slightly followed the  recipe so some of this is repeat.  Here's how I made it: 

2 T melted butter in baking dish (coated fish with butter & salt & peppered it) baked fish 10 mins

Removed from oven, drizzled with 1 Tablespoon fresh lemon juice over fish.  
Next top fish with mixture below (slightly pack topping on so it doesn't fall off getting soggy)
 bake another 10 minutes. 

Topping- Combine-
2T melted butter 
1/2 c Italian bread crumbs 
1/2 c fresh Parmesan cheese
1/2 T parsley flakes (didn't have fresh on hand)
1 T fresh rosemary finely chopped  

After removing from oven top with 4 finely chopped green onions, ladle juice from dish on side of fish and serve immediately.

Very good!  The topping was yummy and nicely absorbed the wine and lemon, but did not overpower the taste of the cod.  My family really enjoyed it!

Great recipe! I added the parsley and green onions to the cracker mixture (along with some granulated garlic and lemon pepper) before baking, and baked everything in one step for about 25 minutes total...though I did have to cover the dish loosely with foil at the end to keep the topping from browning too much. I tried to post a picture, but it was apparently too small. So you can see the photo, along with my adapted recipe, on my little cooking blog if you're interested: http://lindseysluscious.blogspot.com/2013/01/oh-fishy-fishy-fishthat-went-wherever-i.html

Great, easy and quick dinner.  I loved the combination of lemony flavors in the cracker crust.  BUT for my taste, the next time I will use 1/4 sleeve of crackers.  The crust was too thick on my cod fish. When I baked it, I sprinkled the scallions over the top of the fish and cooked them as well.  Great recipe Pam.  Thanks.

This was my first time making fish (I'm not much of a cook) and this came out perfect! I followed the recipe exactly except for the addition of some salt and white pepper. Husband and I both loved it! Also a good reason to open a bottle of white wine and finish it over dinner ;)

Very good and very easy. The cod filets I bought were very thin so I folded them to the desired thickness. I dipped filets in melted butter,  seasoned the fish, put buttered cracker crumbs on top, sprinkled sliced chives and snipped parsley over top and baked only once until fish was done (about 15 - 18 minutes).

I expected way more from this recipe but did not care much for it. You would think that crushed crackers would be an interesting touch but did not like it. I tried this recipe twice with different brands of crackers before writing the review, didn't make a difference however. Will not make it anymore.

Absolutely wonderful!  Make sure you use lots of crumbs as they soak up the wine and lemon juice broth which my husband flipped over.  I didn't have Ritz crackers so I used Premium Saltines--Still turned out great!

Used a 1.3lb COD filet, kept it whole. 
No wine, didn't have any
Added some Old Bay Seasoning to cracker/butter crumbs. 
Followed the baking times(10 mins and 10 mins)
No parsley...didn't have that either 
My husband and I loved this!!!

Since I am a recent bariatric patient I tried this recipe without the breading...easy and tastes great!  A great source of protein and easily digested.  I paired this mild fish with acorn squash.  It's a keeper.

This recipe is fantastic!   The fish came out perfectly flaky and moist and had great flavor.  Don't skip the wine!  The mixture of the wine and lemon juice put it over the top!   I mixed the parsley and green onion directly into the crumb mixture and added a clove of finely minced garlic.  I used light butter to save on a few calories and it worked just fine.  I took the suggestion of other reviewers and did not do this in two steps, but, just topped the fish with the crumbs at the start.   I was cooking another dish along side that was at a different temperature, so, I cooked this at 375 for 30 minutes and it was perfect.   Definitely will be making this again.

not to my liking, too soggy. The first time I tried this I only gave it one star. 
The second time I omitted the wine and lemon juice and it turned out much better.

I followed the ingredients exactly, but I put the topping on first and baked for 25 minutes instead of adding it after 10 minutes.

I used panko breadcrumbs instead of crackers, and no wine. It was great!  Served the fish on grilled French rolls with melted provolone.  The fresh lemon makes all the difference. 
Very good!

I loved this dish.  My first time making fresh fish.  I opted to purchase Ritz Garlic Butter crackers for the topping, and it was so good.  Fish came out perfect.  The only thing I could say that is negative is that the topping was a bit mushy under the crunchy part.  It mattered not to me, cause it was so delicous.  This gives me some confidence to cook fish.  Thanks.

Wow! Had to make a few alterations due to lack of ingredients. I melted butter, dipped cod, then dipped in crackers mixed with seasoned pepper and lemon rind. Topped with shredded parmesan and baked at 400 for about 15 minutes. Outstanding!

This came out well, but I used multigrain crackers as I did not have Ritz.  I also substituted citrus seasoning for fresh lemon (didn't have any on hand) and put all the ingredients together from the start and baked for 20 minutes.  No mushy topping on the fish.  Very good.

I made this as the first fish I was feeding my twin 5 year old daughters and my 4 year old son. They went to bed hungry. My husband loved it. I am giving it sucha high rating because I think my children take after me and just don't care for fish. My husband loved it.

Did something unusual and followed the recipe exactly as written!  Baked cod is mild and tastes pretty much like what you do to it.  Do this.  One of the few recipes I won't be tweaking the next time.  Served with a Mexican rice pilaf (onceuponachef) made with green pepper instead of jalapeno to avoid overwhelming the lovely nuances in this preparation.  Next time, maybe some sliced tomatoes for a salad.  This good, and this easy is a rare find.  Thank you,Pam.

Freshest the Seafood will be lean and firm and never mushy especially after it's cooked. Freezing seafood breaks down the flesh and it will be mushy.  Rule of Thumb for baking fish fillets:  Bake at 400-degrees for 10 mins  per inch of thickness, let sit on warmed stovetop, no heat, to finish cooking, you can add 1 or 2 mins if you like fish drier, especially to crisp any topping.  Use any type of seasoning you like, vary the wine or liquid - try Hard Ciders (Angry Orchards Crisp Apple or Pear, Ciderboys Peach/Apple) the sweetness will caramelize into a lush little sauce, especially great for fillets, shrimp, scallops, etc.) Be creative!

Super easy and delicious recipe to make for Cod! Made it Gluten Free by using GF panko breadcrumbs (unseasoned). GF Italian seasoned breadcrumbs would go well here too. Omitted the white wine since I didn't have it on hand and enjoyed the flavors with the fish. This is a wonderful option instead of using a batter and frying cod. Looking forward to making this recipe again with the white wine! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

A great way to make the 'oh so expensive cod' stretch. I served it with sesame noodles as they compliment this dish very well and also serve as a 'filler upper'. Scrummy. England salutes you:-)

I made this recipe with some very large pieces of code, I'm not a good cook, but have to say it turned out great.  My code was larger so needed another 5 min; but cooking at this temp for a short time relatively made the code fully cooked and still very juicy.  Was a terrific recipe and easy to make.  I'll be using it again.  Thanks so much, Don

People need to read directions.  If this is coming out soggy for you, reread directions.  Pan size matters.  This comes out perfectly for me every time.  Simple and perfect, exactly how food should be.

Used different crackers (Annie’s organic bunnies) , only change and it was easy and delicious and we wolfed it down in minutes!  We will most definitely be making this again.

I placed 1 cod on my toaster oven tray.  Sprayed fish with butter.  Seasoned with sea salt, pepper, cilantro, basil and lemon juice.  Baked 10 min.  Removed from oven.  Added 2 Tbl white wine and topped with 2 Tbl melted butter + 5 crackers mixture.  Returned to oven for 10 min.  Wonderful!  I will definitely make this again!

Delicious and Easy. I substituted crushed mimi clubhouse crackers for the round crackers and followed the recipe exactly.  My fish was on the thin side so I shaved off about 3 minutes before adding wine, lemon juice and cracker crumbs and cooked an additional 5 minutes at the end. The buttery crackers got a beautiful golden brown without having to use the broiler. It looked like a restaurant quality dish and also tasted like one. It was very moist and flakey. This recipe is a keeper. I will the same method for other types of fish and seafood.  Love that it's all in one baking dish and cooks in the oven. Be careful not to burn the butter in the oven before adding the fish. Mine was just starting to turn brown and actually gave a deeper butter flavor to the fish.

So tasty!  So Easy!  I love butter - so didn't flinch at melting the butter in the dish first.  Did not mind the "mush" others have talked about - was the consistency of stuffing - and we ate it all.  The only thing I did differently was to use tiny casseroles and fillets.  20 minutes was perfect for us.  This recipe will definitely make it into the weeknight rotation!

Delicious and easy to make. I added some garlic and other spices (parsley, basil, oregano) in with the cracker mixture. Will take others advice and not flip the fish next time. We used a different white fish and it turned out great. You could easily use any type of cracker or bread crumb that you have on hand. Quick and easy recipe. A new family favourite!!

This recipe is simplistic and very delicious.  My husband said he was impressed and he doesn't impress easily.  I didn't change anything but did omit the parsley as we don't care for it.  This is a keeper and will make it again and again.  Thanks for it!

Excellent recipe! I did change a few things though - I used breadcrumbs instead of crackers and I added Parmesan cheese to the mixture. I also omitted the white wine and chives and baked it for 20 min straight with the breadcrumbs on top from the beginning. Came out moist, flaky and delicious! Will definitely be making again!

Made this recipe with recipe ingredients only. I mixed all of the ingredients together in a bowl and patted it onto the top bottom and sides of fish and baked for 20 min. without turning
I made this again on 12/17/17. I used Italian panko instead of crackers added garlic salt, Pampered Chef  garlic rub, and dill mix and baked for 30 min. Still a perfect 10.

Easy. Easy. EASY!  And FAST! 

This fish was delicious. It was buttery, just the right amount of flavor, and the cracker crumbs added great texture. 

But what really made this a five-star rating was the ease and convenience.  I was able to throw this together in no time at all.  Such a delicious dish with so little effort makes this 5 stars in my book!

Very good! I see quite a few reviewers complained about this being mushy. I did notice that after the first 10-min bake time, the fish was swimming (no pun intended) in a lot of liquid that wasn't there when I placed it in the oven (maybe because my fish was previously frozen?). I just poured most of it off because I didn't want it cooking in that. I used fresh minced garlic which was delicious. (I usually just use garlic powder, and there was a big difference. Also, I didn't add the wine - just drank it instead! :)   UPDATE:  Had it with wilted spinach as Naples suggested....YUM!

Only thing I changed was panko and bread crumbs mixed instead of cracker crumbs- only because didn't have the crackers. Was amazing! Whole family loved! Even my daughter liked it who doesn't really like fish.

This fish was delicious!  My husband substituted Vadalia onions sauteed in butter instead of the green onions and I added some dill to the topping. I also used whole wheat crackers which were a very good substitution. We ate this fish on a bed of brown rice and added some broccoli as a side.  Wonderful!

We really enjoyed this one!  Admittedly, I did tweak this quite a bit but the end result was very good.  I cut back on the cracker crumbs a little and the butter, and added a little parmesan cheese.  I topped the fish with the cracker/parmesan mixture and sprinkled it with a little garlic salt.  I was making half the recipe, but just used a squeeze of lemon juice, probably less than called for.  I combined the lemon, wine and butter and poured it around the fish and baked for 22 minutes.  I didn’t bother with the two-step baking process.  It wasn’t necessary.  The cracker crumbs browned and crisped up nicely and the fish stayed nice and moist.  This is definitely a “do again!”

I used COBIA instead of Cod. It was one of the best fish dishes I've ever eaten and fish is my favorite amongst all the meat proteins. I had never eaten COBIA before  and, though it smelt a bit strong, this recipe was amazing and perfect as directed in the recipe. Enjoy with any hearty fish! QUEANIE

I halved the cook time because I had cod fillets, and the fish came out rubbery.  The breaking, wine, and lemon overpowered the fish.  Won't be making again.

This was literally the easiest fish recipe I have ever made.  With a bag of steamed veggies in the microwave, and this in the oven...dinner was on the table in less than 20 minutes.  Thank you.  This had great flavor.

I followed this recipe except I didn't have fresh lemon so I used Old Bay-lemon and herb seasoning which I added to the cracker/butter mixture.OM Gosh it was so good.Thanks to our commercial fisherman Tim for the fresh cod and Pam for providing this recipe. Yummy!

Skipped the wine and lemon, used ritz mixed w/garlic, rosemary and parsley (like Naples34102), forgot to season fish, just dipped in the butter, put ritz mixture on from beginning and baked it straight through without taking out. Great!

I have a lot of cod in the freezer so thought this would be a good way to use it.   Both my husband and I liked it.   I think it is important to make sure the fish is really dry before baking it.  Also, I used multi-grain club crackers instead of ritz.

Have made this twice now, once for just myself and thought my husband would love this, so I fixed it again tonight and I was right, he loved it!  I don't use the green onion--never have it on hand--but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Next time, for simplicity-sake, I'm going to follow the suggestion of other reviewers and skip the two step process. Really good recipe...thanks for sharing, Pam!

I absolutely LOVED this recipe. It's hard to believe that something so easy could be so tasty. The first time I made it I used the Ritz cracker crumbs, and the second time I was out of Ritz crackers and so I substituted Graham cracker crumbs.....it was even more delicious...just a hint of sweet.

I have become a pretty good 'cooker' of fish in the last months and even tho I greedily studied the reviews, took the advice that made the most sense, this recipe just did not turn out as Excellent as I demand.  It was still on the bland side....

I enjoyed the cracker topping on this fish.  I added some spices to the fish before topping with the cracker mixture; garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, dill weed.  I'm not sure the wine added much to the fish, I suspect it could be left out without noticing the difference.  I would make this one again.

Very quick and easy. I drizzled some olive oil over the fish after coating it in the butter. Next time I will sprinkle a little salt over the fish too to help bring out the flavors. The ritz crackers weren't quite enough salt for my taste...especially with a rather bland tasting fish.

Delicious and easy. My changes were small: seasoning the fish with garlic powder, adding the panko/cracker crumb sooner than the recipe called for to make it crispier, and subbing lime for lemon (personal preference. Will definitely make again.

Yum!!!  I used garlic butter (butter, canola oil and roasted garlic cloves) to coat fish, and regular butter for the whole wheat ritz crackers.  I stuck to the 10 min/ 10 min cooking time at 400.  Fish came out firm, flaky and delish!

Good recipe. Very easy and quite tasty.   I didn't have the "buttery round crackers" (A k a "Ritz" ) on hand, so I used panko bread crumbs which worked great!

Very good and will definitely make again since we always have the ingredients on hand.  I even messed up and put the cracker topping on the fish for the whole 20 minutes and it was still good. Thanks!

I used bread crumbs instead of ritz crackers. Added garlic and lemon zest to the bread crumb/butter topping. Cooked all at once instead of in 2 steps. Delicious!!!

I made this tonight and it was excellent!  I had no crackers so I used plain breadcrumbs.  I also used dry sherry (just 1/4 cup).  The temperature and cooking times were spot on.  I've been married 32 years and prior to tonight my wife would only eat battered fried fish.  She now wants me to make this recipe often (if cod is on sale).   I served it with Chef John's twice baked potatoes and steamed broccoli.   Next time I'll try it with rice and spinach (and ritz crackers).  Thanks Pam for your recipe!

I made a variation of this recipe tonight. Instead of the cracker crumbs I used minced pecans. I left out the wine. It was quick, easy, and my husband and I both thought  it was delicious.

Perfect recipe! Simple, easy, quick and not a lot of ingredients. I used margarine instead of butter, reduced the total amount of margarine to three tablespoon, added a tablespoon of Parmesan cheese, and used chicken stock instead of wine. This will be my go to recipe every time I make cod.

I simplified the recipe a bit to work with what I had on hand with really good results. Melted the 2T butter and mixed in 1T lemon pepper seasoning. (Skipped the wine as I didn’t have any open....Should have opened a bottle.) I dipped the fish in this butter/spice mixture making sure to coat each side and placed them directly in a low-sided baking dish (gratin dish worked perfectly).To the crushed crackers, I added 3T melted butter and another tablespoon of lemon pepper seasoning and mixed this well. I topped the fish with the mixture. Then poured the leftover butter/spice on top. (Again, wish I had used some dry white wine here.) Popped it in a 400 degree oven for 8 minutes (depends on thickness of the loins). Sprinkled with chopped fresh parsley. Done! Beautiful crust with tender, flaky fish. My husband LOVED it. Even I ate it (and I don’t like fish)!

I used panko crumbs instead of crackers and mixed in some freshly grated parmesan cheese into the mixture.   The 10 min and 10 more min was perfect!   Sprinkled with a little salt, pepper and parsley at the end. We'll make it this way again!

Bought some cod fish bc that's what kind we always get and love from our favorite fast food seafood place.  No instructions were included on the package so I turned to my tried and trusted website -- that's allrecipes.com!  Husband is the chef in our house and he made it really, really simple.  Needed to know the oven temp.  Used butter, salt & pepper.  Can't get much more simple than that.  It was delicious!  Thanks!!

Soooo easy to make. I used Triscuits instead for the topping as they're more diabetic-friendly and would have a more prounced crunch. The family requested a repeat as soon as possible !

I followed the recipe closely except that I used panko instead of butter crackers, and fresh dill from our garden rather than parsley. I loved it. My wife thought it had too much butter but she is somewhat averse to animal fat, so I don't count that against the recipe.

As good as everybody says and so easy. Only thing I would add is to finish the fish on the broiler for a couple of minutes to crisp up the bread crumbs.

I recommend adding a little spice to liven it up. I went a little heavier on the wine, sprinkled some garlic powder and Old Bay on it, and some fresh ground black pepper. I had a large filet so I went with a full sleeve of crackers. Fish came out perfectly!

This was DELICIOUS!! And it also turned out to be a very beautiful dish to behold! Like others, however, I did tweak the recipe a bit: I used plain panko crumbs instead of fattening Ritz crackers and used just 1.5 tablespoon melted butter mixed with 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil. I first sprinkled the fish with lemon, salt and pepper before breading. Then baked at 400 degrees for 23 minutes and it was perfect! I'll definitely make again and again. An easy, go-to dish. 
Pro tip: Line your baking pan (I used a copper baking sheet) with parchment paper for super-easy clean up).

Soo Soo good & full of flavor! My family LOVED it!! (kids too)  Definitely adding this to our make again list.  Followed the recipe, used salt/peper/ and garlic spread seasoning very lightly before dipping the fish in the melted butter.  I also let the butter brown a bit.  The ritz cracker topping was delicious! I did bake longer than the recipe called for (about 25-30 mins total) Sprinkled with chopped parsley and let it rest about 10 minutes before serving over brown rice and a side of balsamic dressed spinach salad.

Loved this! It was perfect. I don't care for fish and have never done a great job cooking any fish.  I did substitute gluten free almond crackers to lower the carbs and make it gluten free. The fish was light, perfect texture, flakey goodness. It was a huge hit. My husband who loves fish was thrilled. This will be a regular at our house from now on!

It was perfect.  I used crushed garlic croutons on top.  Flaked red pepper.  Minced garlic.  Served with rice pilaf.  Leaf salad with blue cheese.

I loved it but also didn't prepare exactly since I didn't have all of the ingredients.  I  had frozen garlic cubes on hand, so I melted 1 cube with the butter and dredged the fish in the garlic butter mixture, then baked for 5 minutes, added the Ritz cracker/butter mixture and baked for 5 more. I had cod filets (which are thinner), so that was enough time. I didn't have any white wine or green onion on hand, so I omitted those. Otherwise I prepared as directed. It was AMAZING. My husband and I couldn't eat it fast enough.

I make this often. It couldn't be easier. I've substituted white wine several times with half apple cider vinegar/half water and it's tasted just the same.  My husband likes it, my teenagers like it, dinner is on the table in 30 minutes.  It's everything you would want on a busy weeknight.

My husband is not a fish lover to say the least but from the first bite he raved about this dish.  This is destined to be a family favorite.

The only change I made was to add Trader Joe's Grilled Asparagus to the baking dish and put the cod on top. The Asparagus was delicious but the presentation was a little off because when I put the cracker crumbs on, some got into the Asparagus.  Still tasted great!  First time I ever cooked fish in my life!  Woo hoo!  Thank you!

Delicious! I substituted panko bread crumbs for ritz crackers and I absolutely loved it. Because of that substitution, I had to add some salt. I also added some fresh basil. What an easy recipe with fantastic results!

I used panko instead of crackers and put some beet powder in for fun.   It added colour and flavour.   I baked slightly less time because i was using convection.   Came out perfectly.  Super easy and delish.

I have made this twice in the last month.  The butter and crackers give it a nice rich and crunchy taste .  I tried to reduce the butter in the pan a bit, just to cut down on the fat.  It turned out fine and I'll be making it again.  My husband loves it (and so do I)!

Made this recipe as is. It was delicious! Watch the timing. It really depends on how thick your fish is. My fish was 1/2 inch thick so the timing was just about right. Next time, I will season with salt before I put the cracker crumbs on top.

Make sure you add the Ritz AFTER you pour on the wine/lemon juice. Otherwise, you end up with a mush instead of a crust. Seems obvious in hindsight... but I didn't think about it in the moment and it seriously impacted the dish.

Living in Newfoundland, you tend to eat a lot of cod. This was a great new way of mixing it up! Thanks for the recipe!

So I did not have any white wine or parsley. But it was delicious with the copious amounts of butter and crackers! Next time I will make a butter reduction lemon sauce with capers! Fish piccata-esque.

Very good!  The only change I made was using breadcrumbs  and garlic in the crumb topping, putting it on when I first put the fish into the oven.  Delicious - will make again!

Pretty good. I skipped the wine and used plain bread crumbs for the crackers. I seasoned both the fish and the bread crumbs with salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder(the fish would have been bland without). Also,  I went ahead and put the bread crumbs mix on the fish from the beginning and baked for 15 mn at 400. I served with kale salad.

LOVED this recipe! I did not have lemon, so I used some Herbs de provence, but the butter cracker topping was the real hit. My entire family loved it!

Delicious!! I used gluten free crackers (Benton brand) and it came out fantastic. It's also great with some slices of colby jack on top! Just add it when there's a minute or two left at the end.

I always have problems following recipes. I don't read it all the way through or I don't have an ingredient.  There is always something, but this recipe was so simple I did it right and it was delicious!! It is indeed a perfect 10.  Now, this is our staple recipe for cod or haddock.

This is a great,simple recipe that is easy to adapt to personal tastes. I did have to adjust the cooking time because apparently I had quite thick pieces of fish, and I left out the lemon because my family doesn’t care for it, but it came out delicious.

Flaky and buttery with just enough zest from the lemon, parsley and green onions. I added two red and green bell peppers, in 2-inch strips around the fish for the last 10 minutes. It not only added a pretty splash of color in the plates, but a nice added pop to the dish. I served it with new potatoes, baked with parsley and green onions as well.  My husband, who is not a fish lover, enjoyed it  so much he had two servings.

Perfect ten!!  The only thing I changed was to add cracked pepper and a little garlic powder for the first 10 minutes of cooking .  I also added more melted butter to the crushed crackers.  We absolutely loved it!!

I also sprinkled some paprika, onion powder (I didn’t have green onions on hand) and garlic powder before cooking.  Put shredded Parmesan cheese for last 5 mins of baking... was the best fish recipe I have ever made!!!!

I fixed this for my husband and both of us absolutely loved it! The only thing different that I did was sprinkle a little garlic powder and black pepper on the cod prior to the cracker crumbs. This will become a fixture in our home!

This was a great way to use my new grill pans. The first time, I didn't have Ritz so I used reg saltiness and it was great. Next time we used Ritz and  wow.

My whole family loves this.  I've made it with chicken broth (instead of wine), added lemon zest.  I do cook it at 425 for 10 minutes, then 400 for the final 10.  I broil for about 1 minute to crisp up the topping.

I've made this more than 25 times and the only minor change i made was to broil it for about 2 minutes after baking it for 20 minutes. That was just my preference to brown the top a little. 
I read a few comments about it being mushy but that was probably the result of the fish not being patted dry or adding too much butter/wine.

This was delicious and easy to make. Left the prep until right before cooking, and swapped new spring (wild) onion shoots for green onions, and mixed snipped shoots into the cracker topping because I was a little nervous  about using the wild greens raw.  It was a tasty, beautiful dish!

My husband said it was the best fish he has ever eaten. I didn't have any ritz in my pantry. Instead I took about 1 1/2 cups of panko bread crumbs and toasted them in a pan. Yum!

I made it mostly following the recipe and decided that 20 minutes was too long for cooking the fish.  The next time I will bake it all at once rather than in 2 stages.  And I will see if it is done after 10-12 minutes.

This the best fish recipe we have ever made. After the second time we made it we used seasoned Panko bread crumbs and one more tablespoon of butter for the bread crumbs. Make copies of this recipe because when you make it for someone else they will want it. The vides shows just how easy it is to make. Enjoy

I thought this recipe was delicious.  I made this recipe close to  as is.  The fish was very moist and the flavor was tasty.  In the future, I may use only 1 or 1.5 tablespoons to coat the fish in the pan instead of 2 tablespoons.  There was a lot of butter left sitting in the pan that wasn't necessary.  I did cook the fish for about 20 more mins in addition to the 15 mins required in the recipe.

I used fresh cod and, because I did not have white wine, I used dry sherry.  The fish was delicious and my family went back for seconds!  The only thing I might have done different is broil it for a couple of minutes to get a toasty color and flavor on the topping,.    Will try that next time!

Like countless others, I subbed breadcrumbs for the cracker meal. I used fresh GF crumbs, which would have worked better if they were dry from the start. It took longer for the crumbs to crisp, leading to overcooked fish. The Mister, however, loves his fish 'overdone' and thought it was perfect.  Next time, I'll either use already dried crumbs, or bake them on their own first so the fish doesn't get overdone.

This is such a good recipe. A real keeper!  

I decided to make the recipe just as it was described. I substituted nothings and baked it exactly as the recipe said. I thought it was out of this world. I couldn't wait to eat the leftover for lunch the next day.

My daughter (age 10) thought the wine taste was a little strong ( I used Franzia Chardonnay) so next time I will probably cut the amount in half or try Sutter Homes Chardonay as another reviewer strongly suggested. However, I felt the wine added a depth to the dish that was just heavenly.

I give this recipe a strong thumbs up!

Absolutely wonderful. The result was restaurant quality. I dusted the fish lightly before the first 10 minutes in the oven with Old Bay seasoning for a little extra oomph. My family are fish lovers but this is, by far, their favorite cod preparation ever.

My hubby thought this was great. I followed other reviewers suggestions, 1) Put foil down in the pan and spread the foil with Pam. 2) Laid the cod flat and poured the butter, wine, lemon over cod. 3) Put the cracker mixture over cod. Patted it down. 4) Drizzled the butter over the top. 5)Cooked for 22 minutes. Used the same ingredients but a different order. Thank you for sharing.

I tweaked this recipe by using Italian bread crumbs and mixing in a little pinko bread crumbs and adding oregano, garlic powder and onion powder. I omitted the wine and made it a one step process, Simply delicious !

Very good, simple recipe that even people who don't like fish really enjoy!
I used rock fish fillets instead of cod, because I think they have more flavor.
Only other change I made was that after adding the lemon juice and white wine, I sprinkled some Old Bay Seasoning on each fillet before adding the cracker butter topping.
To make the topping crisper, next time I'll try baking at 425° for maybe 15 minutes.
Great recipe to get my husband to eat more fish!

We didn’t like this recipe too much.  We love cod but didn’t like it with the wine and the crushed crumbs on top were a distraction from the fish.  We like our cod baked with butter and lemon.

Absolutely, delicious, simple and easy.    I did put salt and pepper on the fish and did everything in one step.   Did you use plain crackers that I have in the cupboard.  Maybe will add dill or other herbs next time to give it a little more flavour.  Will make this one on a regular basis!

Super easy! Super delicious!  I mixed some crushed spicy tortilla chips with the Ritz crackers for a little extra zing. A BIG hit. Thanks

We're trying to eat more fish, even though one of us generally doesn't care for fish.   We've made this four times, following the recipe exactly.   We all agree that it's pretty tasty.  No changes.

Loved it! The only change I would make in the recipe is how many crackers to use. My size box only had about eight crackers. I added more.  Also, I put the bread crumbs on first > I think it would be better to pour the lemon juice and wine on first. I'll definitely make it over and over.

Great flavor and easy preparation.  Next time I use this recipe I am going to add additional spices for a different flavor, probably some cayenne or red pepper.  I will use this recipe often.

I did not have crackers, so I used cornflake crumbs.

This was so delicious.  Was looking for a light easy fish dish.  I used Boston Scrod and it baked up light and flaky.  Instead of Ritz crackers I had some Panko on hand; seasoned it with Season Salt and black pepper.  No wine but I had vermouth and used that.  It was a hit!

The entire family loved it.  The only changes we made were to add Greek Seasoning to the cracker crumb mixture before mounding on top of fish pieces.  We will definitely make this again and again!

I simplified this to just butter and breadcrumbs mixture and the sprinkle of lemon juice half way through. It was delicious! Best fish I’ve had in a long time. My husband loved it too. Will make again. Thank you!

This sounded better than it was. While easy and quick to make, it did not have the depth of flavor I was expecting. It just tasted like crackers. As I served it, I added a bit of garlic salt and dill to up the flavor. The concept is good. I might make it again with a few more spices to perk it up.

I used a nice fat piece of cod and it was cooked perfectly.  I did just add some lemon pepper and  a sprinkle of lemon juice prior to cooking.  I omitted the wine and saucing at the end also. It was delicious

The only thing I had to change was using Extra Dry Vermouth in place of dry white wine, only because I didn't have any white wine.   I followed everything else pretty much to the 'T' and it came out so perfect and delicious!!!   My boyfriend said "We have to make this at least once a week!"  Definitely putting this one into rotation!

I baked the fish as directed but found that it became over-baked and a bit too soft.  But it was delicious.  Next time I will cut the baking time by a few minutes.  Very easy recipe to follow.

Nice simple weeknight meal. I made it as the recipe states, except omitting the green onion as I didn't have any. Great flavor. Would've been five stars if the breadcrumbs had stayed a bit crisper, but with all the liquid, they were a bit soggy. I might try and just cook them for the whole 20 minutes next time, or broil for a couple of minutes and see if that does the trick.

I've made this several times in the past month. The last time I kicked the broiler on for the last couple of minutes as I like a crispy topping. We love this recipe.

Great recipe!  You may want to make sure to buy fresh cod vs frozen, as the frozen cod can get watery and mushy during cooking.  I used seasoned Panko bread crumbs and reduced the lemon juice/wine by half.  Delicious and easy!!!!

This really is a perfect ten!  My husband loved it and my 9 & 4yr old boys didn’t complain AT ALL... pretty rare as I’m always trying new recipes on them!  I used whole wheat Ritz crackers, with a little garlic salt, onion powder and parsley. Hand mixed the lemon juice & wine,  patted the mixture all over the fish then poured the melted butter on top. Exactly 20mins at 400 F was indeed perfect.

This is delicious - made it according to recipe. We have a super popular fish restaurant in our town - always a long wait.  I should give them this recipe - sure beats theirs. This is however, quite fattening with the Ritz and butter - but that's why it tastes so good!

Don't  substitute the Ritz crackers. I always use the garlic and butter flavored, and smash them fine. It's a much better  than ordinary breadcrumbs. I use Ritz crackers for all my breading, it's so much better.  I skipped the two part process, baked for 20 minutes and left out the wine. Very tasty.

This was really delicious.  I made it as instructed.  I used multigrain crackers instead of buttery crackers.  I think the flavour would be better.  It was easy and good. I have saved it into my recipe box and will make it again.  I served it with my homemade rice pilaf (as suggested in the recipe) and roasted carrots, beets and Brussel sprouts.

I did not have crackers, so I used corn flakes instead. It was really good. I sprinkled the fish with salt and white pepper, since the corn flakes are not salty like the crackers. I put the convection on for the last few minutes to brown the corn flakes a little more, but you don’t need to do that.

We don't drink so I didn't have the wine on hand.   Also, while I had Ritz crackers on hand, they were bacon flavor.   Just doing the butter, crackers and lemon juice was enough   This was really easy and it was delicious.  I served it with Angel hair linguine.

Excellent and especially speaking as someone who's not a fish lover.   I added about 1/3 cup of grated Parmesan to the crumb mixture and garlic. Everyone gave it rave reviews!

Light and so flaky! I maybe used a little bit more butter than it called for. During the initial 10 minutes cook time, I flipped the fish at 5 minutes and then again at the end of the 10 minutes. We substituted panko bread crumbs instead of the Ritz (used enough that the 2tbsp-ish of butter absorbed leaving a little bit of dry crumbs). The family loved it, I loved it!

So Good!  I added Salt, Pepper, and Garlic Powder to the fish before I put it in the buttery pan.  I used Panko mixed with the 2 TBL of butter with some fresh minced Thyme, Oregano, Basil, and Rosemary from the garden, which was a great coating.  I skipped the 2 step processes and coated the fish with the breading before going into the oven.  I skipped the wine and green onions.  I had some Cauliflower that needed to be used up so I broke it up into bite size pieces and scattered it around the fish and sprinkled the leftover breading and butter on it... Wow it was a great meal!  We also had veggies and Couscous as sides.

I made this recipe the other night and thought it was good.  The only change I made was to use dill instead of parsley and left out the green onion( because I forgot it).  My kids even liked it better than most fish, but they were still not 100% sold on it. (they did eat it, which is a plus).  My husband thought it was very good. Would definitely make again.

My family loved this and gobbled it all up, even my super picky kids the SECOND time I made it.  The first time, I made it exactly as described, but it came out soggy.  The next time, I dumped out all of the liquid in the bottom of the pan before adding the cracker mixture.  Problem solved.  Everyone loved it.

Excellent.  I followed a previous review by dipping fish in melted butter, sprinkling with lemon juice, then  pouring the wine/butter mixture over the fish.  Instead of  Ritz I used panko mixed with the butter and parsley and patted on top of fish.  Oven temps vary quite a bit but baked at 400 for 20 minutes and it was very good, flaky and flavorful.  Next time I might use a bit less wine as we had only two pieces of thick cod.  Will make again.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this last night and it was absolutely lovely. I followed the recipe exactly, though I do suggest seasoning the cod with S&P before baking. Served over couscous, the texture was very complimentary. Love adding another "simple but stunning" dish to my arsenal. Thanks!!

This was absolutely delicious.  I would give it 5 stars but I modified the original recipe after reading other reviews.
I wanted to use the Ritz crackers (which are a delicious topping for scalloped potatoes), but chose to use an alternate topping - a combination of Panko + Italian breadcrumbs.  
I melted (unsalted) butter, and added the breadcrumb mixture - but only used half of the recommended amount.  I did not want to overpower the natural taste of cod.
I patted the filets with paper towel to remove excess liquid and placed the filets on lightly (olive) oiled baking pan.  Added a light sprinkle of parsley, sea salt and cayenne, and fresh lemon juice directly on the fish; then lightly sprinkled 2/3 topping of the breadcrumb mixture with a bare drizzle of (lime flavoured) olive oil over the top.  
Baked in 400F oven for 8 minutes, added the rest of the topping for another 3 - 5 minutes until fish is cooked.  (I wanted to be sure the topping was crispy).
My fiancé said it was the best cod he's ever eaten.

I have a family member that is picky and doesn't like most fish. Made this for dinner this evening and he was gobbling it up. Easy to make and looks great on the plate.

I followed the recipe almost exactly with the exception of using bottled lemon juice and adding Italian seasoning to the cod prior to adding the cracker crumbs.  It was exceptional. I would definitely make this again.  I may try panko crumbs next time, but this is such a simple recipe that produces great results.

Wow, this recipe is simple and delicious.  I was not a big Cod fan and had never made it at home.  I have made this three times now and it has been wonderfully moist and flavorful every time, even using different types of wine and cooking sherry.  I'm a Cod fan now!

Really great! Gave it 4 stars only because I did make changes and thought that it was overly complicated. I subbed Panko bread crumbs for the Cracker crumbs. Spiced them up with fresh ground black pepper and garlic salt (since recipe needed salt since omitting the crackers).  
I also made the cooking one step.  Melted the butter, mixed into seasoned Panko Bread crumbs.  Poured wine and lemon juice over fish (in Olive oil sprayed pan), then put crumb mixture over top.  Baked at 400 for about 20 minutes. Easy and done and delicious!

We really like this recipe. It's easy, quick, and can be modified for your own family's personal preferences. Four stars as written but five stars with modifications.  From another commenter's complaint make sure your fish is dry or it will get mushy. I use a paper towel and gently dry the fish before I prepare it. Lightly salt and pepper the fish. 

I use 1/2 cup homemade Italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of Ritz crackers. It's just a personal preference but I like the added herb flavors with the fish. The wine is unnecessary and I don't replace the liquid. Same with the green onions. Replace with finely diced onions if you don't have green onions on hand. I also throw in 1/2-1 tsp powdered garlic into the bread crumbs. I add the melted butter to the bread crumbs and then gently spoon the mixture onto the tops of the fish.  Then squeeze a quarter of a medium lemon over the top of the bread crumbs on the  fish.  Bake for 20-25 minutes in 400 degree oven. This is an easy dish even for beginners.

I had high hopes for this recipe based on all of the positive reviews, but both my husband and I thought that the cracker topping/fish combination was really gross (both the flavor and the texture were off-putting, even though we did expect it to be "mushy" as was mentioned in some of the negative reviews). We both scraped off the topping and just ate the fish, which on its own had a good flavor from the white wine and lemon. If I were to make this again, I would omit the crackers completely. The one good thing about the cracker topping was that it was visually appealing, and made the fish look like it took much more effort to make than it actually did.

Easy to make and tastes like restaurant food. First time I made it I did not have enough crackers so I used panko bread crumbs and it tasted fine. Second time I used salmon. It was just as good. I'm going to share this recipe with my family and friends.

I really don't like fish and really never CHOOSE to eat it, but for my New Year's Resolution to eat more healthy, I decided to make this.  Now...I know there's a TON of butter in there, so not necessarily low fat so next time I will cut down the butter a bit, but this is truly a very good recipe! Bought the Pacific Cod filets at Costco and cut the recipe in half, making only one.

This was easy to make and quick to get on the table. All 4 of us liked it.  Next time I'll season the fish with salt, pepper and garlic power prior to pressing on the cracker crumbs. A bonus is that the house didn't stink like fish either.

Excellent.If you fear a fishy taste, use cod. Very mild and inexpensive. I had a "block" of frozen cod or cod loins that I used. I liked that it was thick. Not sure if I would like something like thin fillets for this. I did tweak it a bit only because I didn't have everything. Used Panko bread crumbs in place of the crackers. Sprinkled the fish with Old Bay seasoning and Lemon Pepper seasoning so I didn't need to use lemon juice. Perfect mild, well seasoned fish.

Quick and uncomplicated, simply delicious.  We love the buttery, crisp Ritz cracker topping gives the mild, light cod.  We make this recipe often, weekdays and weekends alike.

I made this for my mother-in-laws birthday dinner.  She is awesome so I wanted to make something really tasty and delicious.  This fish dish turn out great.  The sauce created in the baking dish was really wonderful with the fish.  When I asked everyone  whether this was a 4 or 5 stars dish, the verdict was unanimous --  5 stars, we loved it!!!

Cooking notes - I followed the recipe exactly including use of Ritz crackers (first time I made it).   If I make it again, I will probably increase the amount of Ritz cracker/butter topping.  This recipe doesn't need any tweaking.  The cod was purchased and used the same day and was meaty, flaky and delicious.

I used a little italian spice, pepper, and dill on the cod.
I used oven baked multi-grain crackers.
I sauteed onions and the spices and put it atop the cod for the last minute of baking.   It was excellent.   Served with aspagus and italian bread spread with garlic olive butter, toasted in the oven.  Absolutely great.

The cod turned out great.  I didn't change a thing, but I had plenty of lemon wedges for squeezing over the fillets.  The flavor is very mild with a bit of lemon.  We'll have this again, and soon!

I was a little concerned about the Ritz in this as I probably would have subbed bread crumbs if I hadn't had whole wheat Ritz on hand. So, thought I would give it a try. I probably used less butter but followed the recipe omitting the white wine (drank it!). Hubs loved it and I was pleasantly surprised. It was quite good. He even offered that he would like to have it again sometime! That's enough for me to give it 5 stars!

This was very good.  I just didn't have any green onions and I seasoned the fish with salt and pepper prior to cooking.  Yummy!

This is an excellent recipe for baked cod.  I squeezed a wedge of lemon over each 1/4 lb. slice of Icelandic Cod, added wine (always a must), and topped each piece with the green onion, parsley, and buttered crumbs before baking.

Sprinkled fish with Mrs. Dash before topping with the cracker mixture, but the topping was a little mushy even after baking for the full 20 minutes.

We really enjoyed this.  For dietary reasons I had to make modifications.  I used 2 Tbsp coconut oil instead of butter,  homemade gluten free cornbread crumbles instead of the crackers and 2 eggs instead of the second 2Tbsp butter.  I also didn't have any wine.  I followed another post on just assembling and putting it in for 20 minutes.  It was flavorful, crispy and nice.  My often distrustful children ate it up too.

I followed the recipe with the exception of adding garlic.  It was still too bland for us.  I think it would be much better with the addition of some spices to 'kick it up a notch'.  If I make this again, I will add spices for flavor.

I made this last minute, & didn't have green onions or parsley.  But my husband (who is extremely picky) loved it.  Will make again.  I did split up the baking time like the recipe suggests.

This is a great recipe. The wine gives it a nice flavor. As another said, I'll use cooking spray and not so much butter for a healthier version.

I am the creator of this recipe and would like to thank all of those that have tried it! After reading the comments I would like to emphasize that the choice of the cod loin makes a big difference in this recipe. The best choice as the recipe indicates is a thick piece ... and  fresh is the way to go! If previously frozen there with be water from the freezing process that could cause the sogginess. Previously frozen pieces are generally thin also. My recipe is based on fresh, regular Captain's cut cod loin.  It is roughly a 1 1/2 " to 2 " thick piece. There is also an extra thick Captain's cut that would most likely require additional time. The fish will separate into flakes when done and be white in center.
It is wonderful to see how many people are enjoying this.  Love the pictures with the different presentations. Thanks for your feedback!

I am not a big fish fan, but I do like white fish that is not fish smelly. This was wonderful, I put salt and pepper on the fish after dredging in butter then Town House buttery crackers on top. Baked in oven for 20 minutes, came out wonderful. Will do this again, since it was on sale for $5.00 at Vons for 16oz. It is a keeper!

We made this for dinner tonight and it was good, but not great.  The topping combination is really what made this dish, but when you add buttered ritz crackers to any dish it's almost guaranteed to be good.  I thought the fish itself was bland and didn't absorb the butter or wine flavours, and all of the topping that fell off the fish into the wine turned soggy (naturally). Even though I wasn't a big fan, both my husband and toddler liked it, so compromising with 3 stars.

This was delicious!!  I changed it a bit - used gluten free crackers, and seasoned with garlic, seasoned salt, paprika and parmesan instead of the green onion and wine, using what I had in the house,  and it was absolutely fabulous!  I will definitely make this more often!!

Tasty! Didn't have white wine so I used broth and regular onions (next time I'd use green). I also used Breton crackers for a bit more grain. Hubs liked it so did the toddler!

This was a huge hit with the family. I doubled the order & it still wasn't enough. I didn't have wine so left it out and I seasoned with Old Bay seasoning before adding the cracker crumbs. Then sprinkled melted butter over the crumbs before putting it in the oven. Baked at 400 degrees for about 23 minutes. Will definitely make again. And soon!

Excellent recipe! The only thing that I would change is the amount of time I bake the cod. I didn't find that 20min was enough. I would add another 5min.

This was so easy and super tasty! I followed the recipe almost exactly...but I didn't use the green onion and I used wheat ritz crackers instead of the regular. This will be made often, as it was super quick, and the outcome is absolutely amazing! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Followed this recipe completely, except I didn't have Ritz crackers, so used Keebler Wheatables, crushed and some plain bread crumbs. Nice, mild, flakey, moist fish, low salt, wine and lemon juice provided good flavor, scallions were a nice touch.  Easy prep. Will use this recipe again.

This was good but really boring. The fish came out a really nice texture but I felt it was lacking in flavor. Maybe more lemon, more wine and some other spices next time. It's definitely worth playing around with.

The idea of this recipe is good, but I would not use buttery crackers (such as Ritz). This gave the fish a slightly sweet taste which my family did not like at all. Instead, I would substitute seasoned or plain bread crumbs. Otherwise, it was easy and the fish came out moist, with a great texture. I'll make this modified recipe again!

Fish can be tricky to make correctly.  This came out great.  My husband loved it.  The only change I made was like  other reviewers comments, I made it in one step. Thanks for the recipe!

This is only my third time cooking cod, and this is recipe is definitely a keeper.  I did season very lightly with salt and pepper, but the kicker was adding lemon zest to the cracker crumbs!

Bland mush. I  wish people would stop rating something 5 stars when they end up making half a dozen changes to the recipe and cooking time. The recipe as written was not good. I feel like I wasted a nice $15 piece of fish.

This is a hit with my family. I took another reviewers advice - I don’t add the wine or put the topping on 10 minutes into cooking, but I do use buttery round crackers and I really press them into the fish. I coat the fish with butter, salt, pepper, then press in the topping (which is just slightly moistened with melted butter) and drizzle butter on the top.

This is so quick and easy! I make this often. Ritz makes half sleeves of crackers that are just the right size for the topping. It's one of out top favs!

Easy go to fish recipe.  Full of heart healthy Omega-3s.  I would add more seasoning next time, like salt and better.  Serve with a side of rice and steamed veggies!

take out the extra butter for the crakers and just put them on the fish and cover with lemon and wine.  Add some tarragon to make it really fab.

I don't recommend substituting seasoned bread crumbs for the crackers.  We did this as it was recommended as a substitute.  This Cod needed something sweet.  I was disappointed.  It looked better than it tasted and I followed the directions beginning to end.

I love this recipe, I’ve made it several times and my kids like it too. Like others have said, I use breadcrumbs instead and I like to broil it for a couple minutes at the end so it’s a little more crunchy. It’s so easy and delicious, defiantly give it a try!

They all liked the topping once I added the garlic powder, oregano, onion powder, and dried basil.  But they still thought the fish was bland. It's not the recipes fault. I just don't think the fish was that goo.

Very easy and basic.  I added Mediterranean seasoning. It seems to be a very flexible recipe that you can season anyway you want. I would cut the crackers down but we don’t like a lot of breaded things.

I cooked mine on a rack with a tray below.   After dipping in the butter, I added parsley flakes, garlic, and dried rosemary sprinkled on top.   Baked it for 10 min then 10 more after adding wine, lemon n ritz.  I ended up adding 7 minutes.     It was ok.  To me...a little tasteless.  IDK, maybe cod is supposed to taste like that.  Will definitely add salt next time n try some different spices next time.   It was pretty!  Then I forgot to get a picture so I’ll have to make again!  Lol!!

I followed this recipe as listed.  My only change would be to not season the cod with salt, when using the Ritz crackers.  It was very easy and good to make.  I substituted my side with Kale instead of Spinach.  I will definitely make this dish again!

I added Panko crumbs to the Town House crackers and two finely minced cloves of garlic to the butter as a binder. The crackers & panko were placed in the baking dish before it went into the oven (I did not turn the fish). After 8 minutes, I added the cracker/panko/butter to the top of the fish and finished in another 5 minutes. A squeeze of lemon, finely chopped parsley and green onion tops as garnish. It was wonderful with Empyrean Claret 2007! (Sorry I didn't take a snap like I usually do)

This recipe was easy, and tastes great. I added a teaspoon of garlic powder to the butter and cracker crumbs, I pulled the fish at 8 minutes in after adding the cracker crumbs as the crust was getting really brown. Excellent recipe, can’t wait to have it again.

Incredibly bland, sad to say. It was edible, but we didn't enjoy it.

This was very good and easy to prepare . I didn't have enough crackers so I added Italian bread crumbs and a couple of shakes of parmesan cheese from the green can. It was a little dry, so I added a couple of shakes of bottled lemon juice to moisten it up.  I sprinkled salt, pepper and garlic powder  on the fish, then put it in the oven.  I followed the 10  then 10 bake time.  I broiled it for about 3 min at the end to crisp up the topping. I'll make this again.

I liked this recipe because it was easy to make.  I followed the recipe exact except for the wine, I didn't have any and I was too lazy to go pick some up.  If the recipe was this good without the wine, I can hardly wait to try it again with the wine. 
I loved the buttery flavor and I will definitely be making this again.

This was way too much butter for my taste.  Also the Ritz crackers were too much.  Bread crumbs would be better.  It did get "mushy" as others mentioned.  I believe I could attribute that to the overpowering amount of butter.  I didn't use the wine.  I will not make this again.  I'd prefer to be able to taste fish rather than butter and will try some of the other recipes instead.

I did not have butter crackers so replaced it with sweet cereal.  I also did not have fresh parsley so I used dried parsley.  I did not have dry white wine so I used Moscato instead.  I absolutely loved this dish! I would definitely make it again and I especially enjoyed the sauce that was made from the butter and the wine and the lemon juice which I poured over the fish. Then sprinkled on the scallions and parsley.

I didn't used to eat cod...until now.  This recipe was a wonderful introduction to me eating this type of fish.  I used Keebler Crackers instead of Ritz, and it was AMAZING.  I think the next time, I will make more wine/lemon juice mixture, because that was very delicious over the cod.  I will definitely be making this meal again.

I made this as the recipe stated but used Panko crumbs instead of crackers as suggested in the video.   I only needed 2 pieces of cod so used a glass loaf pan and it was perfect.  I will make it again maybe adding garlic salt instead of regular salt to pop the flavor a bit more.     It’s a keeper!

Delicious!  Used whole wheat crackers because that's what I had on hand.  Also used closer to 3 Tbsp of butter (instead of 4) and seasoned the fillets a bit after buttering them.   My 2 cod fillets came to 1.2lbs.  Served with baked potatoes and salad.

Easy, fool-proof.  Just don't overcook the fish.  I always leave out the onion because I just don't have it on hand and it is just fine.  I tried bread crumbs instead of the crackers once, but it was too soggy.  Stick with crackers.  "Club" crackers work as well as Ritz.

This recipe is absolutely delicious! I made it as per the exact instructions. The fish was cooked to perfection! My husband and I really enjoyed the taste of the lemony wine flavour of the fish and the crunchiness of the crushed Ritz crackers.  I would definitely make it again and serve it to guests!

This dish comes out perfect every time I make it. I even left out the white wine once and it was still a hit. 
I did tweek the recipe for my family’s taste. I seasoned the cod the first time I put it in the oven with the butter. I used Cajun seasoning because we like spicy food. I also added minced garlic to the butter after I melted it in the oven and dredged the cod through it.  I served it with gralic mashed potatoes, vegetable medley and a salad.  This is a keeper!

Will definitely make it again,  was just wonderful.  Served with a baked sweet potato and tossed salad!  Didn't have a fresh lemon so used juice,  worked well.

This was very bland in taste.  The 20 minutes in the oven was not enough time to be cooked.  I ended up finishing it on in a skillet because I was tired of having to watch it in the oven.  I used a lot of lemon too.  I would recommend tweaking this recipe - more seasoning in the cracker crumbs and longer in the oven.  I cook cod a lot and this just wasn't that impressive.

Didn't have the wine to put on top, but followed the ingredients otherwise. It came out very good, except for what another comment brought up - remaining somewhat soggy after the final ten minutes of cooking. Adding an additional five more minutes helped a little, and as it sat out, the topping did crisp up a little.
I might try a longer cook time at a lower temperature to dry the cracker topping off more the next time I cook this.
4/5 stars.

The only thing I changed was that I used itialian bread crumbs instead of crackers and followed instructions for the rest. Unfortunately, the fish was not edible as it ended up being very rubbery - had to toss.  Don't think I'll be making cod anytime soon...

I prepared the cod  as per Naples suggestion with panko, butter, 1 tablespoon minced garlic, pepper & dried parsley. I'm not fond of rosemary so omitted that.  This was good, but I think I'll make it spicier next time & try it with the wine poured onto the foil before placing the cod.  I appreciate having the breading & spices stay in place.  I baked the dish 20 minutes at 400 degrees.  I added fresh lemon at the table & that  was a good thing.

It turned out okay.  This is the second time I made this.  I had a problem with too much liquid right before I added the buttery ritz crackers, lemon juice and the wine.  What is the best wine to use? How can I prevent too much liquid?

Maybe we just don’t like cod, but we did not enjoy this at all. The crackers were mushy and we did not care for the flavor.

This is just okay.  Kind of bland but I do still make it for my family.  It is a simple way to make cod.  I will continue to make this so thanks for the recipe.  Sometimes dishes don't always have to have the wow factor but mama just needs to make supper:)

No stars ! This had so much butter between the butter & the buttery crackers it completely drowned out the fish! 
Cod does not need to be smothered in all of this ! Much butter in olive oil garlic, salt , pepper & lemon you can add the white wine & parsley.  It ruined our dinner.

I made this tonight, and it turned out great! Quick and simple, which is priority one for me.  I cooked mine by the recipe, which I loved, but left off the buttered crackers for my husband and added garlic and ground pepper, which is more to his taste.  I added asparagus spears for the last ten minutes. Very flavorful!  Will definitely make it again.

I read many reviews and tweaked it a little as well.  I used a 13x9 pan which kept the liquid 'low' and used panko crumbs for a crispier texture and crunch.  Salt and pepper the fish after slowly pouring in the liquid (I didn't use all of the liquid) and before adding crumbs.  Excellent dish!!  Will definitely make it again and share the recipe with family.

didn't use wine, because I was drinking it! Recipe was still great, super easy, made a side of sauted garlic and spinach, and white rice.  Also, roasted some cipollini onions that I had sitting around, did those in a sherry vinegar and everything went really nicely together! would make again as a nice easy way to spruce up some plain cod...you could definitely add some cayenne to the ritz crackers for a little bite.. enjoy

I used Panko instead of the Ritz crumbs and was crisp and flaky no mushiness, and removed wine.
Turned out not bad, though I would tune the spices differently for a bit more flavor next time. (I used basic salt and pepper)

I will make it again.

Taste was good, but the main complaint was that the bottom of the fillet seemed too greasy. It was an off-putting texture. Next time I will try placing the fillet on top of a sheet of parchment paper on a cooling rack placed in a sheet tray. I should add that we generally prefer deep-fried cod with a beer batter.

This was very good.  I only had saltine rounds, not the crackers it asked for.  I sprinkled salt and pepper before the second 10 minutes of cooking, but the  first couple of bites seemed a little bland.  I added a little more salt and pepper.  The touch of finely chopped green onions and parsley with lemon, along with the crackers were a great topping.  Cod is a bland fish.  Next time I'll add something else to spice it up a little.  Will definitely make again with Iceland cod!

Use bread crumbs and dill. I used ritz  crackers  that  had a cookie like sweetness  that was NOT good.  Timing is perfect.

I followed some of the other reviews and  use a whole sleeve of  ritz. Next time I will only use half, so there will be more of the fish flavor.

I usually read the reviews first but was in a hurry and didn't do so this time.   It was a sloppy mess.   What a waste of good fish!

I followed the recipe but used the Italian bread crumbs and a Moscato for the wine (didn't have the recipe ingredients).The fish turned out amazing;  the fresh lemon juice,  wine and butter turned into an amazing sauce. Will definitely make again but try the cracker crumbs as suggested, or omit topping all-together. My husband loved this and I'm sharing it with my daughters!

Disgusting! My family and I couldn't even stand to eat it. The black pepper didn't mix with the other ingredients, and all in all wasted 2 hours of our time cooking it to not even eating it!

I followed the recipe exactly and my cod was over an inch thick, but it ended up overcooked. The topping was good but was unchanged from  when I put it on, just heated through. Adding the wine was good also, it blended with the butter and fish juices to make a tasty sauce in the pan although I didn't care for the lemon. I would make again except cook at 350,  put all ingredients in the pan at the beginning so the topping and wine get to cook longer then bake maybe for 20 minutes but check at 15.  Some good ideas in the recipe, thanks!

Just OK. I made it exactly how the recipe states. In my opinion Cod was flavorless; it needed additional seasoning to give it a kick.

For frozen cod fillets, this was really good and a breeze to prepare! Patted dry two rather thin fillets and seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic/onion powders, dill, and freshly squeezed lemon. Placed them on small jellyroll pan lined with foil and parchment paper, then drizzled a tiny amount of blood-orange infused olive oil on both sides of the fillets to ensure they wouldn't stick or dry out in the oven. Melted 2T butter and mixed in fresh lemon juice, jarred roasted garlic, pepper, onion powder and more dill. I subbed a combo of bread crumbs and panko for the crackers and combined them into the melted butter along with a bit of freshly grated parmesan. I then spread the crumb mixture atop both fillets and did a final olive oil drizzle. Baked 18 minutes and broiled on low for 2 minutes to ensure a crunchy coating, which worked perfectly! Next time, I'd reduce the baking time by a couple minutes since my oven runs a bit hot, but otherwise, a really tasty and simple dinner that both my husband and I enjoyed served with a side of steamed sweet peas.

This recipe was yummy. The addition of lemon and white wine prior to topping with the seasoned crumb mixture  added a lot of flavor. I used bread crumbs instead of crackers and garlic-infused olive oil instead of butter. Otherwise, pretty much stuck to the recipe. I did put  the fish under the broiler for 2 minutes just to brown the crumbs a bit. Very tasty and easy dish!

I made it exactly as stated and thought it very good.   I will definitely make this again as it was so quick and simple with wonderful results.

I will add just a pinch of cayenne to the cracker crumbs next time though.

Please note, everyone, that this recipe calls for thick-cut cod loin.  That is not the same thing as cod fillets.  Fillets are much thinner, and although the taste is identical, the thickness would definitely affect the cooking time.  

Based on the advice of other reviewers, I made the following changes:  Instead of cracker crumbs, I used 1 cup of seasoned Italian bread crumbs.  That was too much, so next time I'll use 3/4 of a cup.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon of garlic salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of white pepper, in addition to the lemon, melted butter and white wine.  Like many others, I skipped the two-step baking and simply baked the entire thing for 20 minutes at 400 degrees.  

It came out great.  This recipe is a keeper, and will be pulled out again whenever cod loins go on sale.

I am not a fan of cod, but I really liked this. I am dairy and gluten free, so I used coconut oil in place of the butter, and I used almond meal in place of the crackers. It was delicious!

I used plain crackers from Trader Joe's instead of the Ritz.  Also added some garlic powder and grated cheese as those are flavors I thought would enhance.
My husband LOVED IT which is something coming from a person who is not typically a fish eater.  It was crunchy and tasty.  Did not alter anything else.

I don't buy Ritz crackers and I find breadcrumbs turn out soggy.  I used my own mix with panko crumbs so the topping was crispy.  The fish texture was good but the whole thing lacked flavour.  It was very bland.  When it was cooked I poured off the liquids and thickened  a little and added cream and seasonings and poured it on the asparagus because I figured that's where the taste was!  It wasn't smooshy as others have said as my cod was quite thick.  I also just used the one step process.   It was an easy recipe but just OK.

To make this recipe gluten free. I substituted Gluten free panko style bread crumbs for the crackers. I increased the butter in the topping mixture by 1 Tbsp and added about 1/8 tsp salt.

I have made this fish topping for years.  It is delicious.  
One addition:  a couple of shakes of Worcestershire sauce mixed into the melted butter and Ritz.

Cook 20 min at 350 degrees

I buy only local catch, so I couldn’t comment on frozen at sea cod.

This was delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly (I always do that the first time).  My family commented it tasted just like lobster drowning in butter.  I had two problems with it, however; it is not at all healthy, so I would definitely try substituting olive oil for butter the next time as well as bread crumbs (panko?) for the Ritz crackers, and it was just too buttery (didn't know such a thing was possible) so I would use less butter.

Really tasty! I used Icelandic haddock in place of the cod. My only recommendation would be to salt & pepper the fish a bit. A bit of garlic would also be a tasty addition. Next time!

Fast and easy recipe. I didn't have the wine so I omitted it. I also put it under the broiler for a minute at the end to crisp the topping. Very tasty.

Pretty good! I had to make a couple of changes, I didn't have any Ritz Crackers so I used my sourdough breadcrumbs and used chives instead of spring onions (as I have those in my garden). This will be a staple. Even my fish-hating son didn't complain. Will buy crackers for next time, it should be lighter.

delicious especially since we love love love cod but rarely get it due to its precarious reduction in quantity due to over fishing....however that said it was an easy quick recipe that turned out just great even though I did not have the zippiest tasty crackers (as suggested) it was so moist, flaky and delicious that I'm sure we'll have this plate again.

The change I made was in the crackers. I changed it from buttery crackers to bacon and cheddar cheese its. It really   enhanced the flavor. Everything's better with bacon!!

This is definately a do again! However, next time I will try baking it like someone else suggested...adding the topping at the beginning and baking it 20-25 minutes instead of 10 minutes without the topping and 10 minutes with it.

The Ritz crackers were ok.  Be careful of the measurements, my fish was drenched in the lemon juice and wine which made the crackers soggy.  IF I make this again, I would eyeball the measurements to taste rather than follow these directions.  Not a winner for my family.

Perfect the way it is written. Addition of granulated garlic to the cracker mixture is a good tweak.    Before serving, some grated parm makes for nice presentation.

I'm not usually doing fish for meals and have little experience, so I was looking for something to compete with the lasagnas and beef based meals that I prepare. After preparing this I had anticipated a bit more flavor and 'zest', if you will. The fish was good but very bland.

Pretty tasty.  Poured 2 TBSP melted butter to bottom of pan, then placed fish in pan, turning it over so each side had butter.  Next, moved on to making the crumb mixture.  Subbed seasoned Panko crumbs (roughly 3/4 to 1 cup) for crushed Ritz crackers.  Omitted green onions & parsley, as I didn't have them and was using seasoned Panko crumbs.  Added 1 tsp garlic powder & 1 tsp onion powder to crumbs & blended together.  Heated 2 TBSP ,butter & wine in microwave, then poured over fish, reserving some of it to pour over bread crumbs.  Sprinkled fish with garlic salt & pepper, poured butter/wine mix over fish, squirted lemon juice over fish, then sprinkled bread crumb mix on fish, then drizzled remaining butter/wine over bread crumbs.  Covered pan with foil & baked 10 minutes.  Removed foil and baked for another 12 minutes.

My husband said, "this can be a regular on the menu!" - I thought it was very yummy. I did without the lemon juice and wine... basically I mixed together ritz crackers, butter, garlic and (dried) basil. I salted & peppered the fish first, then pasted on the ritz-mix. I put it right in the oven with it on; I didn't do the whole cook 1/2 way thing (doesn't seem most people did). I did have it in for 20 minutes or so but the topping still seemed soft, so I gave it 5 minutes under the broiler and that added a bit more crunch. Even tasted good re-heated the next day. I'll be making this again!

I used Panko bread crumbs instead of crackers. I had a thick filet so baking it twice made sure the fish was cooked and the crumbs didn't burn. Delicious!

It is so easy and fast and taste amazing. As I do not have crackers, I used panko bread crumbs, it was good too. As I was only cook for two, the cooking time is only about 12 minutes.
I will certainly do it again and again.

This was very good and I had no problems with my fish having a  smooshy texture like others mentioned. I did add a little garlic powder, onion powder and paprika to the cracker topping. This was quick and tasty. I will definitely make it again.

My husband doesn't care for fish, but he really liked this.  It was delicious.  
I mixed the parsley and onion with the crackers (which in my case were gluten free) and I added garlic. I did as others suggested and cooked for 20 min uninterrupted.

It's our weekend for his kids though and because of Thanksgiving we got them early. I went downstairs to see what was in the freezer and found cod. Opened my go-to recipe site, typed in cod and picked the one with the most good reviews. Checked to make sure I have the ingredients, read the first few reviews and got to work. 

His kids are kinda picky eaters, but we have a rule that they have to taste it. If they don't like it after the taste, that's fine, but they have to try it. With a wrinkled nose and a "yuck!" look ready on his face, the 9 year old slowly raised the fork to his mouth. His face lights up and he exclaims "This is GOOD!" The 12 year old little girl/woman is a less vocal but she's the one who just asked if she could have the last piece of fish.  Dad will eat pretty much anything I put in front of him.

This one is going in my "the kids kove it" cookbook! The only changes I made was to use a mix of Italian breadcrumbs and Panko instead of the Ritz crackers and I added a good helping of shredded Parmesan cheese, some Garlic Powder, Onion Flakes and Parsley to the mixture.

Fantastic recipe, thank you!

I followed this recipe closely but was disappointed with the result. Very bland. The butter and wine/lemon sauce just did not permeate the fish. I think a marinade would be in order...

I've now made this several times and we love it.  However, instead of the cracker crumbs I use Panko bread crumbs.  And after the first time I also cut the butter in half - and it tasted just as good.

This was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly.. except I put some of the green onion and parsley in the cracker crumbs before putting it on top of the fresh fish loins. I baked it about 15 min each time and it came out perfectly cooked and flaky. I did not use the crumbs that fell into the liquid in the baking dish but just for a short time the loins were sitting in the juices. We plated it, then added the rest of the onions and parsley on top,  squeezed a little lemon juice then prepared to enjoy it. It was moist and flaky not mushy, the flavors worked great together.  I used a New Zealand Monkey Bay Sauvignon Blanc in the baking and drank the rest at dinner. I won many points with my husband with this dish. It took 35-40 min. to prepare and bake this dish.

I didn't get mush - it was nice and crispy on top - the flavor was yummy, texture perfect. 

I added about a teaspoon of fresh lemon zest and some parsley to the cracker crumbs and a little lemon pepper on the fish, but other than that, kept to the recipe and really enjoyed it.  

Hubby had 3rds!

My husband said he enjoyed this better than the other ways I've made fish.  The only substitution was to use panko bread crumbs instead of buttery crackers.  Made it on a weeknight and it worked out well.

This was pretty good. I'm going to have to find a sub for the wine because I didn't care for the taste. Also it was on the mushy side, but we all are it regardless.

I made this according to the recipe and was disappointed that the coating was soggy. I scraped most of it off which left me with a piece of boring cod. I might try it again, with some of the reviewers' recommended changes and tweaks.

Pretty good and definitely easy. Texture was perfect. I did not have crackers and used Italian bread crumbs which were good. I did feel that the fish itself was left a little bland, I'd probably marinate briefly in a mild vinaigrette dressing first next time.

I didn't have any crackers so I used rice crispies  instead and put them in the food processor to crush. . Fish came out very good.  My husband and I both enjoyed!  I will make it again. Recipe was very easy to make.

This was really tasty. I did mine dairy free and used the smart balance dairy/soy free butter. I also added some fresh tomatoes underneath the breadcrumbs which was really good. The only thing I would do different is put the breadcrumbs on from the beginning so they crisped up more. Otherwise...very tasty and easy to do recipe!

Very quick and easy. Followed recipe and used Ritz Wheat crackers. Not much of a white wine drinker, but a guest left a bottle of Santa  Marina Pinot Grigio  and I used that. 
Was excellent. Had a very low sweetness in the sauce (from the wine) that thickens slightly from the cracker crumbs. A must try.

I've been making a recipe like this for years.  The reason I gave this version only 4 out of 5 stars is because the texture of the fish is too soft and wet for my liking.  The addition of the wine makes the fillets soft and the coating soggy, though the flavor is good.

I too got mushy fish, but my fish had been previously frozen. Next time I will cook on broiler pan. Hubbs really liked it. (Non fish eater here).  I didn't have wine but will use next time.
Thanks for sharing.  You made hubs a happy guy! (Salt, pepper, ole bay and lemon on fish.  Added garlic, onion powder and ole bay to bread crumbs.)

I opted to omit the white wine and just used plain bread crumbs stirred into the butter and it was delicious. The browned butter in the pan and lemon topping was perfect for my little eaters too! Will make again next week!

Very good. I didn't use the wine. I used bread crumbs instead of crackers and I added mayo and mustard into that mixture. Next time I'll add more lemon because I couldn't taste it. Great recipe, my boyfriend and I loved it.

After denying fish dishes made at home for decades this recipe has changed things forever. One of, if not the, best fish dishes I have ever had. We used wonderful cod from a local market here in Naples, Fl. We did not put in the wine but it was spectacular all the same.

Changed it up just a bit to incorporate my healthy eating style.  Used a 3 seed potatoe cracker instead of Ritz and used coconut oil instead of butter.  It's a hit!

Great quick dinner. I didn't follow the instructions as written but it turned out a perfect ten anyway. I did not use the wine and cooked everything at once, adding the buttery rounds crackers initially then cooking. I've made this several times and it never disappoints.

For once I didn't read the reviews before making a dish and I regretted it. The cooking time is definitely dependent on how thick your fish is--I should've realized this but since my fillets were thin, they ended up overcooked. I also wonder if the fish might have been more flavorful if it had cooked the entire time in the wine and lemon, instead of just the last ten minutes. I needed to cook 2 lbs of fish (enough to feed the family) so I increased the amount of wine and lemon juice as well, but didn't double it since the fillets would have been submerged and the topping would have been soggy instead of crunchy. This may be why the fish wasn't especially flavorful. I will make this again with some of the other reviewers' suggestions, especially adding the herbs that naples34102 suggested.

I followed this to the letter (except for the onion, because I don't like onion) and all I could taste was the crackers.  I couldn't even taste any of the lemon.  If I try this again, I think I'll try saltines instead, andistribution maybe a bit of garlic.

Easy and delicious.  A big hit with my husband.  Made it last week and he asked for it again this week.  Cod is mild and the cracker crumbs add nice texture and flavor.   This is an easy weeknight supper.

Will definitely make this again it is a perfect 10.  I made it exactly as described and certainly had no problems with any "smooshy" texture. Cod is a pretty firm fish when cooked correctly and this got raves.  Simple, fast, delicious.  Thanks for posting this.

We loved it! I used cod fillets, which I sprinkled with Everglades Seasoning, and added about a teaspoon Everglades to the cracker mixture. I also baked it only once, for about 16 minutes. Hubby liked it so much he immediately put it on this week's shopping list.

This cod was a mushy mess! I took a few tips from another reviewer to try and prevent the mushyness, but it definitely did not work. The flavors were fine (with a few modifications) and my husband liked it. But I was pretty disappointed that the topping was not crispy.  I won't make this again.

The first thing that you have to understand, is that my wife doesn't like cod.  I however, do like cod.  Since I do most of the cooking, I decided that I should get my way sometime.  I made this recipe last night.  Extremely easy, by the way.  After dinner, my wife said "We could do this again tomorrow night".  So we did.  It was wonderful again.  We cooked some vegetables as a side dish, and mixed the leftover butter and crumbs with them.  Yum!

I followed other review's suggestion of  lining my pan with foil, spray with a non stick cooking spray, put the fish down flat in the pan, pour melted butter (without wine) over the fish, pat down seasoned breadcrumbs on top and drizzle with some extra butter. Baked for only about 20 minutes a 400 and came out nice. I used garlic pepper seasoning in my breadcrumbs.

Was not a fish fan before, but since this recipe, cod is all I want to eat!  A huge hit.  The only thing I changed was substituting coconut oil for half of the butter.  It worked well, giving a light flavor.

I'm not really in love with most fish. I never use parsley or green onion but I decided to take a chance. I made this recipe with Meyers lemons and Chardonnay. It was amazing. Thumbs up from 4 out of 4 diners.  Thank you!

This is a favorite of ours. I agree it's a tad mushy but taste is great. After reading a few other reviews I may tweak a bit with the steps.

WOW...really GOOD. I added giant scallops during the last 6 minutes. I didn't have buttery crackers, so I used Panko bread crumbs and a little salt and lemon pepper, and DILL.

This is the first time I've wrote about a recipe/posted a picture of something I found on here. It was that good! I have celiac so I modified it with gluten free bread crumbs and added Italian seasonings to it. Turned out perfect! Honestly one of the best things I've ever cooked (since being diagnosed celiac about 4 years ago).

The crackers were not browning much, so I accidentally overcooked the fish. I used mac and cheese for the side so my kids would eat it, and together, it tasted good enough for everyone to finish it up.

Love it!!! I made this recipe as is with a slight change in the directions, I mixed onion and parsley in with the cracker mix. I did make extra mix bc I had two large filets. I also added a dash of salt to the top of the fish at the beginnig.  For my cracker I used reduced fat ritz.  It was delicious!  It was buttery with a flaky but moist texture!  Warning! Do not expect a crispy top bc you are using crackers.  You are mixing the crackers with butter.  Combined with the moisture if the fish, what you get is a buttery soft topping, that is more on the side of a stuffing texture. I really like how it melted with the fish. Cod is always so boring to me but this was amazing!  I will definitely make this again, and again, and again. Did I mention I loved it?

For me it was too much butter between the coating on the fish to the ritz crackers.  Would try it again before writing it off.  maybe add some additional seasoning to the crumbs before coating it

Made it tonight. Came out great!! Left out the 2 step process and just baked for 30 min at the top of the oven, since I also had acorn squash baking in there. Poured melted butter in each baking dish, coated each with butter, then ritz butter combo, then placed in 2, 13x9in glass pans (had a lot of fish), poured the lemon juice over and wine around each piece. The parsley and green onion, sealed the deal.
Really wonderful! Thanks

This was pretty good.  I made the following changes:  panko instead of crackers and no green onions.  I baked the whole time with the crumbs on top.  I think I will leave out the wine next time b/c although it added flavor it wasn't my favorite.  Maybe next time add more seasonings with the topping instead of the wine.

I was disappointed that the topping was moist and not crunchy. I left it in the oven longer to try to crisp it, but fish would have been overdone if I had continued to bake it too long. It did have a nice flavor, just not what I expected since there are cracker crumbs in the ingredients.

I followed the recipe, and mine came out very bland.  Some tweaks may get more flavor into the fish, but as-is this didn't go over especially well at my place.  I had two good-sized fillets.  Maybe fewer, smaller peices would soak up more of the wine/lemon mixture.  But even at that, it needed salt.

I used cod fillets, tweaked the cracker topping with onion power and chives, plus a bit of a lemon vinaigrette I had on hand as I was out of lemons. Mine came out tasty and flaky. I will try it again.

This is a simple and delicious recipe.  Because I am being careful about fat, I cut the amount of butter in half or a little less-using about a TBS melted in the pan and the same amount to make the crumbs.  I made homemade whole wheat bread crumbs to further reduce sodium and fat.  I didn't use the wine, but did squeeze the juice from one-half a lemon onto the fish prior to the second  time in the oven. Very tasty!

I enjoyed this and would make it again. I baked at 400 for 25 minutes, but they were large fillets. I also used Italian bread crumbs instead of crackers and added seasonings to the fish.

I thought it was bland and the topping was dry. The fish came out tender. My son scraped everything off of it in order to eat the fish. Typically, it would be the opposite. I won't make this again.

Very simple and easy.  I didn't measure. I had bread crumbs and Panko on hand so used that. Didn't have any white wine.  Turned out perfect and will definitely make again. I think I seasoned the fish prior with adobo also.

Pretty plain tasting. I will say I used Tilapia instead of Cod because I couldn't find Cod. But the breading didn't have any flavor at all really. 

Next time I would season the filets with salt and pepper first, then add the breading. I might try it with plain breadcrumbs too instead of the crackers too. We'll see. Definitely needs more flavor though in my opinion.

This turned out pretty well. I had a bigger portion of fish, so I upped the volume of wine and lemon juice, which may have been a mistake. Not a huge mistake, but there was definitely more liquid than I needed, which changed the cooking time a bit and resulted in a much less crispy topping than I expected. My son thought it came out a bit rubbery. Nevertheless, the flavors are nice and mild. Again, my son, who as you might guess doesn't really like fish, said it didn't have enough flavor. Well, what are you gonna do. The rest of us liked it. So I think if I had used the right amount of liquid it might have got 5 stars. My bad.

THis was a last minute decision; I had the cod and I needed to make it in a simple way that my kids would like.  I followed someone else's lead and used breadcrumbs since I do not keep Ritz crackers in my house.  It was really quite delicious! I also used some wine with the melted butter in the pan to make sure the fish stayed moist.  Really good! I will make it again.

Cooked this for dinner last night and it was just okay to me.  Took others suggestions and omitted the white wine.  The dish wasn't bad but wasn't all that it was cracked up to be, either.  Just my opinion.  My four year old didn't like this.  My husband said it was "good" but I could tell he wasn't crazy about it.  Probably won't be making this version again.

This is an easy family friendly recipe.  The cracker crumb topping is very good make sure the fish is well coated with it.  Next time I make it I may add add some almonds to the crackers when I process them in the food processor.

Good flavor. I really enjoyed the topping. I used Panko crumbs instead of crushed crackers since I didn't have any on hand - I imagine it would be even better with the buttery crackers, though. My husband and I just aren't a huge fan of the texture of thick cod, so I'll be trying this next on tilapia.
