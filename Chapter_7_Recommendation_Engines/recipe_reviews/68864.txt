I used this dip as a filling for quesadillas and everyone loved them! Simply spread the dip on one half of a flour tortilla, topped with shredded mozzarella and/or cheddar, sprinkled on some more fresh cilantro and folded in half. Grilled them a few hours before my party started and put in the refrigerator. Then about 30 minutes before I was ready to serve them as an appetizer, I put them in a 350-degree oven for 20-30 minutes to warm them up. Had guacamole and salsa to top them with. Definitely make this dip a day or even two ahead of time for the flavor to develop. Also, I used one store-bought rotisserie chicken which worked wonderfully.

*Update* This is still a big hit at get togethers. I always have to share the recipe *Update* This is a GREAT recipe.  I brought three appetizers to a party and this was the only one that I didn't have any leftovers of.  I omitted the cilantro (personal taste) and lessened the chili powder because I didn't know if the guests liked spicy foods.  Also, I beat the cream cheese and spices together first, then mixed everything together.  I left the juice in the tomatoes.  It was just wonderful!  Thanks So Much!!

UPDATED REVIEW: First time, I made this it was good, but not a very pretty dish. I made this for a Bridal Shower yesterday as Tortilla Rollups- Spread dip (with Drained Rotel and without Chicken) onto Cheddar Jalepeno tortillas, then added a layer of Deli Sliced Chicken. Refrigerated overnight in tightly wrapped Saran Wrap and then sliced right before. They were excellent and everyone loved them!

What a wonderful dish.  I knew just by looking at the ingredients it would be tasty.  I took this to a superbowl party and I chose to heat it up and serve.  What a good choice because as it warmed up...guys came out of the woodwork looking for whatever it was that smelled so good.  They swarmed on it like locusts and if they could have gotten away with it I think someone would have licked the plate.  I served this with hard corn tortilla chips and soft flour tortillas.  Great recipe as is, but you can tweak it to suit your tastebuds with different/more cheese, spicier, etc.  I am going to try this base without chicken and spoon it onto a thin chix breast and roll and bake it in the oven.  Then serve with some kind of corn/black bean relish...getting hungry just thinking about it.  Make this recipe and you won't be disappointed.

Made this for a girls' night party I hosted...Rave reviews! Everyone loved the recipe.  It had a great flavor and made a TON.  The only complaint I'd have is that it's a little too rich for my tastes (and i LOVE rich, rich foods..).  Made it a second time halving the cream cheese and adding a little more sour cream (a quarter cup or so).  Much better this time, and it gave me an idea...this would be great for chicken enchilada filling!  So with all my leftovers (which, as I said, is a lot), I put about 2/3 cup filling in the middle of each ten-inch flour tortilla, rolled them up, spread plain sour cream over the tops of each one, shredded some sharp cheddar over each one, and put them in a glass baking dish and warmed 15 minutes (just till the cheese on top is melty).  Then, I garnished each one with extra cilantro.  OMG...these were the best chicken enchiladas ever!  AND, my fiance thought they were from a restaurant.  Kudos!  :)  So, I must say that overall I liked this recipe much better as enchiladas for dinner than as a dip.  But still, very good either way!

Awesome!  Made this as an appetizer at a Pampered Chef party and it went over very well - 5 people asked for the recipe.  Used salsa (drained) in place of canned tomatoes/chiles.  Grilled the chicken and put into food processer (after cool) to shred.  Served with tortilla chips.  Very easy, very good!

We loved this dip.  I thought it was a little bland, but I waited the 2 hour chilling time to let the flavors meld a little and then I added some more chili powder.  I might add a can of diced chilies next time instead of extra chili powder.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! Every time I bring it someplace people comment about how good it is!  I use the Rotel Extra Hot Tomatoes with Green Chiles. Nice thing is it's even better if made a day ahead of when you plan to eat it.

This is so addictive! Next time I will chop up the chicken a little finer because it was hard to scoop with the big chunks of chicken. I may add a little salt, as well.

Yum!  I made this over the weekend. I didn't have as much chicken as it called for but it was still very good. I used a about a teaspoon more cilantro just because I love it.  I also baked it in a 350 degree oven for 15 minutes because I already had 3 cold dips for the party I was having. This dip is delicous hot or cold.

I took this dip to a party...it stole the show!! I was short on time, so I used canned chicken breast. I mixed the chicken, cream cheese, rotel & seasonings in my kitchenaid. I tweaked the spices  until I achieved the desired taste. I also added garlic granules & onion powder; if I hadn't been serving to guests, I would've added cayenne pepper. I placed the chicken mixture in a serving dish, topped with shredded cheddar cheese, fresh cilantro,  fresh diced tomatoes, chopped green onions & black olives.  Certainly a crowd pleaser! Will make again. Thanks for sharing!

No tomatoes with diced chilies (Rotel) so I used a can of fire roasted tomatoes that I zapped in the blender to coarse chop and a small can of mild green chilies. I did double the spices and I added onion and garlic powder. This was good, the little guys even liked it. I think I'll add shredded cheese next time, like pepper jack. I think this would be better hot, either in an oven or small crockpot.

Best dip ever!!  I make this dip all the time and get rave reviews.  I save time by using 1 large can of chicken, drained.  I also bake mine in the oven and serve with Fritos Scoops.  Thanks for this great recipe!!!

Sooo good!  Made this for my brother's "fight night" and everyone LOVED it.  People were standing over the bowl instead of watching the fight.  I didn't drain the tomatoes so my dip wasn't too thick.  I didn't have any green onions but it was still great!

Great ingredient list (did skip the green onions since I personally don't care for them).  My other change was to use garlic powder (out of garlic) and roasted chicken legs (seasoned with salt and pepper, roasted and then skinned and shredded).  I heated the dip on the stove and served in a fondue pot at a party.  Was definitely a hit--I did taste it cold and absolutely preferred it warm!

This dip was spectacular!!  The spices were perfect, and the fresh herbs really added that special something.  I would definitely suggest not draining the tomatoes before adding....the liquid made the dip the perfect consistency.  I took this to a party, and everyone LOVED it!!  Thank you for this crowd-pleasing recipe!

Everyone loved it.  I definitely recommend serving this hot in a crock pot with tortilla chips for dipping.  I think I would leave out the chili peppers next time (personal taste).

I didn't think this dip was particularly "sassy" but it was okay. After making it as stated, it was sort of bland so I added hot sauce and minced pickled jalapeno peppers to spice it up a bit. I also warmed it in the oven since it seemed unappetizing when cold. A few people at our party liked it, but there was a lot left over at the end of the night which is highly unusual with our friends! If I try this one again, I will probably add a can of green chilies since I like the idea behind this appetizer and we love Mexican food!

Too thick.  The chips broke when you dipped them.  My guests suggested it would taste better heated but when I heated it, they still didn't like it.

Great recipe! I drained the liquid from the tomatoes into a glass and added it back into the dip until I got the proper consistency. If you drain the tomatoes your dip will probably turn out too thick and won't have as much flavor.

I've taken this dip to 2 potluck parties in the past 2 months and everyone loved it. I made it exactly as shown, except I left out the Cilantro, because I didn't have any. As suggested by others, I made it a day ahead so the flavors could mingle. You know the recipe is good when someone asks "who brought the dip?"

This was one of the best recipes I've ever found! Brought it to work, and once I convinced a few to try it (if only it looked a WEE bit more appealing..), they convinced the rest. Everyone wanted the recipe (even the notoriously picky ones), and it was the first thing gone. Corn chips make it perfect!

I made this dip for a party and it was a really big hit -- with the people at the party and with my husband the "taster" in advance :-) It wasn't clear to me whether to drain the can of tomatoes/chiles, but the next time I make it, I'll leave that juice in to give it even more flavor.  Good stuff - Thanks!

Delicious. I made it just the way it is written and it was awesome. Everyone loved it. It does seem like it would be really good to roll up in tortillas for enchiladas.

Rave reviews at work pot luck!  I used 2 (9.5oz) cans of chicken breast meat, drained, a couple of tablespoons of chopped cilantro.  I also added a 7oz can of whole green chilis, drained and chopped. I let it chill overnight - it definitely needs some time to let the flavors meld together.

This was a big hit at my Thanksgiving party.  I added 1 jalapeno pepper chopped in my food processor since I like it a little spicy.  It added some extra spice but not too much.

I followed some of the suggestions from other reviews and added my own touch and ended up with a superb dip.  I used salsa in place of the canned tomatoes and used Cajun Foreplay spice blend along with the cumin and garlic.  I served hot with tortilla chips - big hit!

Made this last night and followed recipe very closely.  Used the mild Rotel and drained.  Save liquid and just added what was needed to make it "dipp-albe".  Used Louis Rich chicken breast strips in southwest flavor (three packages).  Everything else exactly like recipe.  This is probably the best dip I have ever made and I've made many.  Even my huband, who doesn't care for cream cheese, likes it.  Try it...you won't be disappointed.  We are eating it cold.

I tried this recipe for a family cookout and everyone really enjoyed it.  I followed the recipe to a "T" with the exception that I also (as others have suggested) baked in the oven at 350 degrees for 15 mins with chedder cheese sprinkled on top. Will try again.

I am going to give the recipe four stars even though it didn't go over quite as well as I thought it would.  And I too thought that it sounded delish based on reading the ingredients. I made this dip for an office pot luck.  The recipe makes a ton and I went home with a bunch left over.  I did make a couple changes, so that might be why it wasn't a hit.  First of all, I used canned chicken instead of fresh, because I was rushed.  I added about a half cup sour cream to it.  The Rotel tomatoes I used were 'mild' and I should have used 'medium' for a little extra kick. I also added a few teaspoons taco seasoning mix because I thought it wasn't spicy enough.  But it was the perfect 'dip' consistency. I used the leftovers as an enchilada filling, but it was just too rich, I couldn't eat it. I will give this recipe another try - but will follow the recipe as written in hopes of getting stellar results.  Thanks.

Flavors were great in this!  I used rotisserie chicken breast chopped fine, and was generous with the amounts of spice, green onion and cilantro.  I also put in the drained tomatoes (used petite diced with garlic and olive oil) and then added juice in small amounts to get the right consistency.  I halved the recipe with success, but this was so good, I will always make the full amount.  Everyone loved it!!!

This was a good recipe, although when left chilled, it was too thick and the chips broke.  No one ate much of it....Then I tried to heat it up and it went quickly....We like it better heated with just a touch of cheddar cheese on top.

This is fantastic. I took it to a going-away party and everyone wanted the recipe. I did follow some of the other suggestions made. I added sour cream to the cream cheese to make it a little thinner and then mixed in the spices. I also added a jar of salsa along with the tomatoes to thin out the mixture. Then to make it pretty I topped it with shredded cheddar cheese, black olives and green onions. I will definately make this again!!

I threw a party and was aware one of the guests cannot eat gluten.  I knew enchiladas were her favorite dish so I served this with corn chips.  Not only did SHE think it was delicious, the rest of the guests crowded around the bowl and devoured it.  It got so bad one person stole the empty bowl are started licking it!!  Needless to say it was a success.  Luckily I served several other gluten free dishes for my friend.

I brought this to New Year's Eve and the next day two people asked for the recipe.  I made it as a warm dip.  I sauteed the onions and garlic in olive oil and used a rotisserie chicken.  When it was all put together I baked it @ 425 for twenty minutes.  Everyone that tried it, loved it.  I will be making again next time I have company.

This made a LOT.  Mine came out kind of thick cause the recipe doesn't say whether to drain the tomatoes or not and of course I drained them.  I should have saved the juice at least till the finished product.  Oh well.  It got many compliments, will make again (with the juice next time).  Very spicy!  
Didn't make any changes.

I loved this recipe and so did my group of scrapbooking friends!!  I did make a few changes though.  I used only 2 chicken breasts (from a rotisserie chicken-time saver!) and 3 packages of cream cheese, and cut down on the shredded cheese a bit.  I also drained about 75% of the liquid from the canned tomatoes.  I also forgot to add paprika and oregano, but everyone loved it just the same.  A great crowd pleaser.

This was great!  Believe it or not, I actually used refried beans instead of cream cheese.  It was excellent.  Not as spicy as I thought it would be though, so maybe next time I will up the amount of heat.

I love appetizer recipes and have created a lot of winners, this one however seemed more like cat food.  The taste was okay, however it just seemed very thick and not really good for presentation (added chopped tomatoes on top - still not looking good?)  My husband thinks it might be good on top of mexican black beans and poblano peppers - heated in the oven.

Very easy recipe and I was passing it out by request.  The only thing I did different to make it easier was to use canned chunk chicken.  Thanks for a great dip, its nice to have something diffenent from time to time...

Try pulsing the cooked chicken in the food processor for a finer consistency to the dip.  And add salt.  Great!

After reading comments I made some changes that made for an excellant dip. Sautee cut up chicken in the spices first with a splash of olive oil. Use smoked paprika. When combining ingredients add the spices again but switch to regular paprika. Use only 8 ounces of cream cheese and use the chive/onion variety. And I never find an 8 oz can of tomatoes but a drained 14 oz can of tomatoes with hot pepper really added a kick. There were no leftovers.

I took into account what others said that it could use more flavor so I used the Spicy Chicken Breast recipe on this site and I liked it. I took it cold to our card night in small crock and heated it there so we had it both hot and cold. I like it better hot. I"m using the leftovers today to make enchiladas and adding some pepper cheese.

Wonderful recipe!  I used canned chicken instead because it is already flavored with chicken broth...easy and boosts the flavor

It was great, a little rich. Next time I will sub half of the cream cheese with sour cream. But there will be a next time!

I used canned chicken and added shredded cheddar and jalepenos, but the dip was a big hit!  I was looking for something heartier than just cheese and didn't have to be heated.  This fit the bill perfectly.  It was great with Frito Scoops or Chicken in a Bisket crackers.

I made this for a ladies' potluck at our church -- had to bring the recipe to the next meeting!  It is now a favourite at our church!  It's wonderful!  I have added some sour cream, and shredded cheese to it, and the flavour is wonderful.

This is a great recipe but I did just a little bit or tweaking. I added a touch of salt at the suggestion of another reviewer. I also made it the night before to let the flavors come together. The next morning when I tried it, it was really good but reminded me of eating cold queso dip, so I put the mixture in a baking dish and topped it with some shredded chesse. I baked it in the oven at 375 for about 25 minutes, just until it got bubbly. After I let it rest for a few minutes topped it some sour cream and chopped tomatoes and green onions. I took it to a potluck lunch and everyone loved it. I think they would have finished it off but we ran out of tortilla chips!

Really good and so easy! I took the advice of another reviewer and mixed all of the spices with the soft cream cheese before adding the chicken. I put everything in my little crock pot (I halved the recipe) and let it sit for about an hour and served with Frito scoops and tacos. So good!  Hubby loved it too, I will be adding this to my rotation.

This dip was a hit at my work "food day".  I can tell you that this recipe makes a lot and won't last very long.  As it was everyone's favorite!  I forgot to add the Cilantro, but it didn't seem to make a difference.  Try lime chips for dipping.  :)

For me, this could've used more of a kick - jalapeños would've been a welcomed addition.  Used Penzey's Chicken Taco Seasoning instead of individual spices.  Drained tomatoes.  Added a bit more cilantro.  Poured in a couple shots of La Victoria's Cilantro Salsa (medium).  Let sit a full day and served warm, with Scoops! Chips.

Pretty good!  I didn't use cilantro (don't like it), used toasted minced onion instead of green onions (didn't have any), garlic powder instead of minced garlic and added a tiny bit of cayenne for a little more "oomph".  I also used leftover turkey.  Definitely will make again.

Really good dip!  Can't help but wonder if this would be good served warm in a mini slow cooker.  Add extra cilantro and a few shakes of red hot to add some more sassiness.

Yum!  I added shredded mexican cheese on top along with extra chives and tomatoes, just for presentation... I took it to a friend's Christmas party and it disappeared!  I would double the recipe though... there's no way a single recipe serves 16, at least not the way we eat!

I served this dip at a get-together last week and everyone loved it.  The only changes I made were to leave out the oregano (didn't have any) and used plain diced tomatoes with a diced fresh jalapeno.  Made it the night before so the flavors could blend and served cold with tortilla chips.  Mmmm

Sorry, but I thought this was disapointing. I expected something fabulous from all the good reviews but wasn't too impressed. I served this for a decent-sized group of friends, then used some for quesadillas, then finally threw the rest out because there was so much left. I did really like it as a quesadilla filling, but I won't make again as a dip.

This is the best dip ever!  I've made this for several tailgating events, which is great for passing around the parking lot.  The only thing I added was a can of sliced black olives.

This is the best dip that I have ever had!  I did not think that I would like it because I am not a cream cheese fan, but the flavor blended wonderfully.  It is the only dip that I enjoyed snacking on for a couple of days.  Thanks for sharing this one!

This was good and easy to prepare. I enjoyed all the flavors but I did not enjoy it cold. I think next time I will try to bake it and see if that makes it even tastier. Thanks!

I brought this to a New Year's Eve party where the theme was 'Mexican'.  It was very good.  I replaced canned chicken breasts for the cooked chicken.  I also used regular cream cheese instead of light.  I used canned chiles since I could not find fresh.  It tastes better after it has time to marinate.

I made this recipe exatly as written and found it lacked a little something, so after waiting 3 hours I added some cayenne pepper which zipped it up a bit.  My family enjoyed it, but I think it needs something more.

this is a great recipe for any get together.I have made it for parties and it was gone it minutes! And everyone wants the recipe. The longer you let it sit, the better it gets as the flavors blend. I also used the 'hot' tomatoes w/green chiles and it was even better for those of us that like really hot and spicy foods.  Try it, you'll like it!

AWESOME recipe, Michelle.  Made this for my candle party and this literally flew out of the bowl.  I couldn't keep the tortilla chip bowl filled fast enough.  Delicious, tasty, easy to make and something different.  If you're tired of Taco dip and bean dip, TRY THIS!!! YUMMY!!!

I made this recipe for the superbowl party last night and it was the hit of the party.  I used canned chicken instead of the fresh chicken breasts and I cut the cumin back to 1/2 tsp and the Chili Powder to 2 tsps.  Excellent!

I used this as a filling for tortilla rollups & it was delicious!  I made one batch with chicken and one with beef carnitas.  Honestly, I liked the beef rollups better than the chicken! Thanks for a great idea!

This really needs to chill more than two hours, at least six hours and even better if overnight. Great flavors. For Halloween I transformed this recipe into a graveyard using tortilla tombstones and used a food grade marker to write on them. This is worth making again.

So I took the advice of a highly rated comment, putting it in a quesadilla and letting it bake for 20 mins at 350. I also only used half the amount of cream cheese and 1/4th of sourcream. I added jalapenos (judge for yourself) which added nice flavor and heat. I didn't add any other cheese, though.

And important note, I cooked my chicken with some taco seasoning, then before pouring it into the main bowl, i squeezed half a lime over it. I could taste it and REALLY loved it, added more flavor to the chicken for sure.

I wouldn't heat these up, at least not as a quesadilla. There's definitely more flavor when it's cold.  There's other queso dips you can do that taste a lot better warm. Not something I'd really make again unless I was going to a potluck or a party.

I followed it just as written.  My chili powder was hotter than the normal kind so I thought this was a bit spicy  and was afraid my friends who can't eat hot things wouldn't like it, but they absolutely loved it!  I was hoping to have some leftovers to use as suggested in enchiladas but they ate it all!

I followed the recipe, except for the green onions which I didn't have on hand.  I also used my chopper to chop the chicken vs. shredding.  Based on other reviews, I used some of the dip and rolled into a flour tortilla, set for 2 hours then cut into pinwheels.  I placed the remaining dip into a small appetizer crockpot and served warm with tortilla chips.  I took both to a party and everyone liked the warmed version best.  The cold version may have been the hit if it were summer though.

Add some chopped jalapenos & a little of their juice, threw in some mexi cheese, then baked.  Not great looking, but DOES taste great!  Made 1/2 recipe just for me, planning to use leftovers in quesadillas as some others have suggested.

Made this last night and took it to work today.  It was an instant hit.  I didn't mix the green onions into the dip.  Instead, sprinkled them on tip along with some shredded mexican style cheese.  Served it with Tostedos small round corn tortilla chips.  Every one loved it.

Best piece of advice - let sit a full 24 hours before serving. This lasted us 3 days and the taste just got better and better the longer it sat - very scrumpcious!~

This was pretty good.  I made it the night before my party so the flavors had lots of time to mix.  You definately want to serve it with a thick cracker or chip because it's very "hearty".  I'll also add more green onion and cilantro next time.

Add salsa and sour cream to get it to dip easier.  The original recipe is too thick to dip with.  I have been invited to parties with the the specific request that i had to bring this dip time and time again.

I have a recipe just like this, except it calls for about 1 t. cayenne pepper, and 1.5 c. shredded cheddar cheese. Very tasty, but I agree with others-not pretty to look at. I'll try the tortilla roll ups for better presentation.

This dip was good, but I feel it needed a little more "kick" to it.  I would add more green onion and cumin.  Maybe some chopped jaiapenos.

The review by ERINCHELSEA says it all - it is addictive! I followed the suggestion to make sure that the chicken was finely chopped and added some salt. Rather than green onions, I used a small yellow onion that I ran through a food processor (my method for hiding such things from some people). Thanks for the terrific recipe.

Loved This!! A quick & easy appetizer/snack to pull together in a pinch! Tasted great! Served it with an assortment of crackers instead or tortilla chips & it was perfect for dipping!

I wasn't too sure about this until I had my first bite.  I now crave this yummy dip.  My good friend and I made it together and she begs me to make it for her.  This would also be really good in a pita or tortilla!

I really liked this recipe, especially the day after making it.  I too, added extra cilantro and cumin, and I will use even more next time.  I added some Cholula hot sauce and a little salt to give it a little more flavor.  Angela

This recipe was great!  I took it to a BBQ at a friend's house and to a work potluck and received rave reviews both times.  The first time I made it I didn't put the cilantro in because I don't really like cilantro, but the second time I put it in and I thought it added a little something.  The second time I forgot to add the green onions and it still turned out great.  My friend's 7-year old nephew loved this dip so much that he made me promise to bring it to our next party!  I'm planning on making it again for a New Year's party in a couple of days.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a great hit at a party.  Instead of chicken, I used some left over spiced shredded beef.
