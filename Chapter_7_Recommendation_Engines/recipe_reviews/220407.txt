It was good.  I had everything on hand (including tamarind paste!) so the numerous ingredients didn't throw me off. However, there are a couple things that were different than other pad Thai recipes, and I would change them. For one, putting the peanuts on top of the servings (with dried red pepper, and green onion if desired) adds color. 

It's easy to get the noodles too soft, between the soaking and the time in the sauce.  Ten minutes is probably too long. 

But the truth is, we ate it all, and enjoyed it.
