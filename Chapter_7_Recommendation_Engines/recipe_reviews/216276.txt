Great for a quick and easy lunch! I used leftover grilled chicken that I hand on hand - great way to use it up. I also added a little more spice to my coleslaw mix by adding some smoked paprika and cumin. I didn't bother grilling this, just warmed my tortillas slightly in order to make it easier to fold and wrap. I used "No-Mayonnaise Ranch Dressing" from this site and served it with homemade salsa and light sour cream. Next time I think I might add a bit of avacado!

These were so good!!!  I made a larger batch and used a smaller amount in the tortilla to make lots of small ones.   They take a few minutes to put together, but it's completely worth it!  This is a versatile recipe that can be adjusted to what you like or have on hand (lettuce instead of cole slaw in my case).  Very nice!

This was super good - I didn't have the coleslaw blend on hand so I used regular lettuce and it turned out awesome. I just pan grilled mine as well, since it's a tad cold out to be using an outside grill right now:)

I was looking for a chicken wrap to make and this looked good. I made it for me and my boyfriend and we loved it. Although i accidently added the salsa with the mix but thats ok cause it made it nice and juicy. I loved the coleslaw ,it  added a nice crunch to it. I think this is defiently a meal i can make anytime it was quick and easy and the blend of flavors were great.

SOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOD!!!!!! Added rice to the mix and it was awesome. Didnt have cabbage mix but didn't need it. Mixed a southwest ranch with the salsa for a little extra tang. One of my fav recipes and so quick and easy!

Awesome. A terrific summer dish - very tasty and filling, but not heavy at all. My husband LOVED it. I loved the grilling step (used my George Foreman and it worked great). I'll make again and again! Thanks :)

This recipe is easy and delicious. Great for whipping up a fast lunch or dinner for a couple or a few, without sacrificing flavour. Use more chili powder or some hot peppers if you like it spicy. I am going to try throwing rice into the mixture next time.

This kind of grows on you, but I'm not crazy about it.  Despite the tortillas, chili powder, Mexican cheese blend, it wasn't really Mexican in taste.  The Ranch dressing was the culprit, I think.  If I make it again, I will definitely tweak it.  But there are so many recipes to try, if it's not wonderful, why bother?

This was awesome and so easy!!!  I didn't measure the ingredients.  I substituted taco seasoning for the chili powder and added avocado, and green onions.  Next time I think I will also add black beans and corn too.  I think the lime juice makes the recipe, it adds great flavor.
