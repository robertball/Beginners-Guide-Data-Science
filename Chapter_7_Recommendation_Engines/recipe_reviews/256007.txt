Holy moley, hell hath frozen over...I made scrambled eggs. I know, this doesn't sound like a big feat, but eggs are my kryptonite. I can cook anything, I'm very proud of my cooking. But my eggs ALWAYS come out terrible. These came out fluffy and delicious. I didn't have ham so I left that out. For the most part, I think I have over easy eggs down, and now I can finally cook scrambled eggs.

Fluffy and tasty, this is a keeper.  I shredded the cheddar very finely an used some extra to garnish the dish.  This a quick and easy recipe that delivers and you can easily make it your own.  Thank you!

I did this with one egg and half a slice of cheese and it really could have been a meal itself. Next time I'm entertaining folks who are hankering for breakfast in the morning, I know what I'm making!!

I love the idea to add the cheese in before you cook it! The only change I made was putting in half the cheese in before you cook it, and the rest I sprinkled on at the end.
