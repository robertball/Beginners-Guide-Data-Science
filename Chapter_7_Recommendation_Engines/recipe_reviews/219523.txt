This was really bland and watery. It needs garlic, salt and pepper.

This was good! I used diced tomatoes I canned from the garden so I added more spices than it called for to compensate for the Prego. I saut√©d an onion also. I omitted the water because I felt the tomatoes and veggies had enough water in them. Served over couscous. The eggplant was soggy but I don't think that can be helped, tasted good anyway!
