I made this cake for the international festival and I cant cook or bake to save my life but this cake actually came out great! out of all the dishes there this one was the talk of the room and everyone enjoyed it. Granted it did take extra time to bake compared to how much time the recipe requires and it did get a little difficult when the top started to slide a little. Overall, adding strawberries in the middle and whipped cream with a circular design of strawberries sliced on top made it look very professional. It is an easy cake to bake even for someone like myself and its very tasty and I highly recommend it!!

I am sorry this is not a good recipe for Victoria Sponge. The consistency is correct but it is much to greasy and tastes of nothing but butter. I lived in Ireland and this is a popular sponge there. I wouldn't serve this to anyone familiar with a true Victoria Sponge.Sorry, I hate leaving bad ratings.

This is a good recipe for a butter type cake (nice and rich), but I would not call it a spongecake.  A true spongecake is made without butter and very, very light.   A typical English treat usually filled with jam and topped with cream.

This cake was absolutely delicious. I layered it with whipped cream and strawberries for a classic treat. The flavour was just right and texture deliciously moist. Makes a perfect Victoria Sandwich!

I did not care for this recipe. It should contain equal parts of butter sugar and flour. 225g of butter is way too much - tried it and wasted all the ingredients on a greasy mess

Didn't rise and needs more sugar. 

I had to make a very sweet sauce to save this "sponge cake" and with the poor outcome I'm going to pass on this recipe all together.

Traveling back & forth to the Northern England, when there I have learned that British definitions of foods can be worlds apart from the USA. Trust me, it has taken a lot of getting used to cooking "his way"

The texture of British "sponge" is just that, looks like a sponge when cut. Baked items are nowhere near as sweetened as ours. They use a lot of custard and double cream(whipping cream)and jams to add the sweetness. 

This was originated for "English Tea Time", think of the sweetness of a scone, jams and preserves are used with those also.

The biggest thing I learned is that just about everything over there is made with self-rising flour. The key to whether using the baking powder with all purpose flour or self rising, fold in! over mixing, or hard mixing will lose the rise.

***********yes, for this recipe, USE 1/2 BUTTER. ****will rise better, be lighter with no greasiness

A very delicious sponge cake substitute for those of us who do not feel like they have time or eggs to use 6 separated eggs in a recipe, which is what most real sponge cakes call for. I followed the recipe except used only 1/2 the amount of butter, as in 1 stick instead of 1 cup, which seemed excessive when I first read the recipe.  I am wondering if there was a typo and she meant to say 1 stick.  It is very good for the purpose for which I used it: strawberry shortcake.

I followed the recipe to the letter and half of it stuck to the bottom of the pan despite the parchment paper I used and it was so greasy inside and heavy. I have no idea what went wrong.

Needs way more sugar. It was quite bland. Also I substituted 1 cup butter with .5 cup butter and .5 cup margarine, and it worked fine.

creates one heavy and extremely greasy mess. Nowhere near as much butter is needed, I just wish I had read the reviews. It took double the time to cook through and it was so greasy and bland.

I turned this recipe into strawberry shortcake and added strawberry puree to the batter to give it more of a pink color.

I like this cake, although it's heavier than a traditional sponge. Instead of cream or jam, etc, I brushed some melted butter on top and sprinkled on a mixture of cinnamon and sugar. A lovely cake to have with tea or coffee. :o)

I give this 3 stars for a few reasons.  1 - I wouldn't really consider this a "sponge" cake...2 - as others have said, the cooking time is not quite enough, it does take longer...and 3 - even though there are some issues, it is a very easy cake to make, it has a wonderful flavor and texture, and it can be dressed up in so many ways with powdered sugar, whipped cream, fresh fruit, compote...or any combination.

Good for what is supposed to be, but like others have said, not too much flavor. Definately not the right texture for an ice cream cake.

This cake has all the correct proportions of a classic Victoria Sponge. Equal proportions of butter, flour and sugar with 2 eggs. The addition of milk has worked surprisingly well in my oven. That's something I never added when making this in my youth in England. As for this not being a true sponge, the other type of sponge is what we knew as a "fatless" or "whisked" sponge, often used to make swiss rolls and plain sponges. But trust me, this does very much resemble the classic Victoria sandwich cake of my English childhood.

Just awful. I just threw out a fortune in good ingredients. The 4.5 star review led me to believe it was a winner. My kitchen reeks of sweetened melted butter since that is what you end up with. Even the pictures show a ring of it on the bottom. This recipe shouldn't even show up in a search. Beware, find another recipe.

I made this cake for my grandparents without any frosting and just added raisins and walnuts. Everyone present loved it, especially my grandparents! It was so fluffy, soft, and one of the best Victorian sponges. Could make this absolutely scrumptious cake billions of times!

Excellent recipe! I've been attempting to bake cakes from scratch for years and this was the first time it was successful! Cake was absolutely delicious. Instead of using 1 cup of confectioner's sugar, I did 1/2 confectioner's with 1/2 white sugar, and substituted the vanilla extract with pure lemon extract. Very easy to make and quick too!

The cake was actually 4 stars, but I only used half of the amount of butter - actually, I used vegetable spread - suggested so I suppose that it wouldn't have been that nice if I had just followed the recipe, so I have to take a star off for that. This aside, I followed the method and, based on the result, I have to say that it was faultless. The cakes were fluffy and light without the need for separating a silly number of eggs. I didn't actually make a Victoria sponge but used this as the basis for a sponge rainbow cake and will now always refer to this when trying different sponge cakes.

This was a wonderful cake. My fiancee hates icing-full cakes, and this was perfect for his birthday. Put some strawberry sauce on top, and he wanted more and more.

It just went very flat, after I took it from the oven, though. Perhaps more time next time?

I'd never made Victoria Sponge before, but this was seriously easy to make.  I sliced it horizonally and filled the centre with M & S strawberry jam and real whipped cream.  My English friend declared it fantastic.

Unfortunately, I agree with other reviewers that there is WAY too much butter in this recipe. I didn't see the bad reviews until after I made it. The butter taste was so overpowering, and it was way too greasy. There was butter pooling in my pan when it came out of the oven. I am throwing it away sadly

I used this recipe to make a chocolate walnut cake and the result was amazing! The cake is soft, spongy and delicious. I added chocolate powder, choco chips, crushed walnuts and a little walnut paste for flavour. I also used a little less butter than what is mentioned in the recipe. 
I would love to make this cake again, it is the perfect recipe for a chocolate walnut cake. I will use this for lamington in the future as well. 
Alot of other chocolate cake recipes seemed to make a dense, brownie texture but I wanted a sponge like cake so this is the best recipe for it.

All it tastes like is butter. Don’t pick this recipe, it is not a fluffy sponge cake, it tastes like it’s covered in popcorn butter and was not good. 

Pick another recipe!

I loved it! It tasted very nice, and I made it for my vertical layered cake! It was very crumbly and cracked a bunch when I was rolling it, though. I will likely not use it for a cake, but maybe for a different purpose!

It sorta worked. It tastes good, but did not come out very high (this could probably be prevented by using a not-so-wide baking pan). 
Texture is like a typical victoria sponge cake. 
Very Buttery though....
do u think i should double the recipe to get a bigger cake? hmmm....

This recipe is the WORST. I've tried making it twice. If you're going to make it DOUBLE THE RECIPE. A Victoria sponge cake is supposed to be twice this size. All this recipe did was  me off and waste ingredients.

It might have been okay had I used the right size of pan. It didn't specify and I use a 10 inch springform (which sadly leaked a little). Please specify in your recipe, size of cake pan. It did come out somewhat spongelike but kind of thin - not like one could cut it in half and spread jam. Burned a little around the edges. Very labor intensive for a rather poor result.

I loved the recipe! I just doubled the size and added 1 and a half  
sticks of butter . The recipe was a bit too small and a bit too much butter if you doubled it but overall the recipe is awesome! This definitely will be me and my family's go to recipe. Even a finger of the raw mixture tasted fresh, and like cream cheese, hahaha. It is still baking but I KNOW it will be great!

My 9 year old wanted to make a petit fours so we were looking for a good base cake recipe. She decided on this one and had no trouble making it. We mad it in a 9 x 13 pan to make a very thin cake which we were able to cut with cookie cutters and slice in half for layers. It was a very simple easy to handle cake, exactly what we were looking for. The flavor was not outstanding (could be tweaked easily) but as a base for our petit fours it was perfect.

I followed the recipe and directions, but i think i messed up somewhere along the lines; it was a dense cake and i was expecting a light and fluffy one.

The result of this sponge cake was not what I was expecting. I found it to be very heavy, buttery, and greasy.

This is my favourite  recipe.... BUT ONLY if you live in the UK or use British flour (self raising is best and no baking soda)... British flour is heavier and will absorb more fat... I have tried this recipe in Canada and now in Israel with the same results... it is way too much fat for the local flours!!!

I added salt!!  Went flat, too greasy but had decent flavor. Doesn't look like the Victoria Sponge I've had in the UK.

The recipe is superb, nice and light. Used cupcake tins instead of a cake tin, got about 14 cupcakes, added pineapple juice instead of milk and topped it with pineapple slices and glazed fruits, for a mini pineapple upside down twist!

This recipe is quick and easy to bake and is a hot with everyone who has tasted it. I have read the review stating that it is not a true victoria sponge and tastes nothing of butter. But I beg to differ on the taste aspect it is awesomely moist and tastes awesomely buttery.

Way, way too much butter. I cut butter amount in half keeping other ingredients the same. Still came out like a fried cake with butter foam around the edges. 1/4 the amount of butter should be about right. Still tasted good despite the greasy donut texture.
Does anyone edit these recipes?? Steps 3 and 4 essentially the same.

I followed some other advice and cut down on the butter. I made whipped cream to frost the top and added fresh strawberries. I served it at a church party, and I received lots of compliments including they thought I bought it from a bakery! Only complaint was there wasn't enough to go around. I was requested to make it again, and I plan on it!

I alternate the butter with half cup of oil, reduced the sugar into 2/3 and added a half cup of grated coconut and it comes out delicious, the rating is after the alternation :)

WOW! After failing (miserably) at another recipe for sponge cake for a strawberry short cake I came upon this jewel. To be honest, it's idiot proof. I baked my 4 servings in a muffin pan and they came out fabulous! They are soft and spongey with a light, sweet buttery crumb. It's a great recipe and I can't wait to make it again!

Too much baking powder, and still the cake didn't rise that high.  It would be an okay cake if it were used to soak rum in it.

Baking time is definitely not enough..when i skewered it after 20 mins, skewer came out covered and then the cake collapsed and went flat (due to hole made by skewer). Baking time needed: at least 30 mins at 200 Degs Celcius. Was really disappointed. One good thing: the cake turned out quite yummy despite being flat and slightly burnt on the top.

Very heavy cake that needs a sauce. I made a blueberry & blackberry sauce. It was good, but not something you'd make often. Don't know if I'll make again or not.

This is an ok cake. It didn't rise any when I made it (granted I was in Denmark so the altitude may have had something). It also really needs the jam inside otherwise it is a bland boring cake.
