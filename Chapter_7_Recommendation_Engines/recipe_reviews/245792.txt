I tried to make this healthier and doubled the spinach and halved the cheese. Not a good idea.

Tasty! I didn't bother pre-cooking the tortilla and cheese in the oven, I just put it all together and baked in the oven until browned (that's the way I always cook my quesidillas). Served w/ a side of salsa and sour cream. I would make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Very Yummy! I made for 3 adults and it was just enough for us. I think next time I may put another tortilla on top instead of folding in half.
