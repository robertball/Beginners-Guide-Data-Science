I followed the recipe exactly except my canned tomatoes had garlic, oregano, and basil in them. I think I'll use this same kind the next time I make this soup. This is not an overly juicy soup; I was afraid I would need to add more water, but I didn't. Very good and very quick to get on the table.

My husband, 7 year old (Picky Daughter) and I loved this soup.  Although, it is not really a soup because it does not have much liquid to it.  Next time I will triple the liquid and seasonings to get more of a broth to the soup.  It is delicious though.  I love the flavor!

Used everything but the turkey which family doesn’t care for. Added about 2 tbsp of low sodium soy sauce to add umami for depth.

My first homemade soup!  Had to modify the recipe due to ingredient issues, and skill-level issues haha.  Used chicken broth to give more liquid to the soup.  Delicious! :)
