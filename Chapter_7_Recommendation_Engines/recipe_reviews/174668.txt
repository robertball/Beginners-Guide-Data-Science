Over the years I have tried a number of Cajun/blackening seasonings and some time ago settled on one that Hubs and I both love and have used exclusively since - until now. We also agree that THIS seasoning mix is even better.  Always mindful of Hubs' sensitive innards I reduced the cayenne by half, leaving all else the same.  We used it to blacken grouper in a cast iron pan on our outdoor grill - just out of this world. All the seasonings blend cooperatively with each other to create a whole new taste - in other words, no one spice stands out. And for us, cutting the cayenne by half was just right. Great recipe.

this is great on everything.  Rub it on ribs, sprinkle on chicken in the crockpot, stew, elk meat, etc.  So much potential.  Put in jars and shakers and gave it as a gift to the guys at Christmas!

Wonderful! And its salt-free~ Hubby rubbed this on our grilled chicken breasts about an hour before grilling. I'd better go to Costco to get the restaurant-size containers of the spices because I will be making this by the bucket! Thank you!!

I thought it was just OK. I put it on a piece
of Talapia and some shrimp. In my opinion,
the taste of the oregano is too strong for my
taste. The wife didn't like it either. The only changes I made were I added a tsp of sugar and 1/2 tsp of celery seeds. I saw them in the ingredients list of Chef Pauls ($5.00) small bottle of 'Redfish Magic'. So, why not! The heat level was good.

Excellent! Used it for seasoning "Pan-Seared Tilapia" from this site. It was perfect for that dish. I will definitely make this again!

This was perfect for my leftover Prime Rib. I made blackened Prime Rib sandwiches with my leftover pieces of meat. I buttered one side of the Prime Rib, diped both sides in the rub, heated my iron skillet for 10 minutes on High, and blackened the meat  buttered-side first for about a minute and then flipped it over. Of course, my kitchen filled up with smoke, but a quick blast with the attic fan took care of that. I cut a baguette in half lengthwise, then into thirds (for 3 sandwiches),  toasted each one, added some provolone cheese, sauteed onions and italian dressing. Mmmm.

This is pretty good but I have to agree with the person who said it had an overpowering amount of Oregano. Next time I make it I'll use 1/2 tsp. Oregano instead of 1 tsp.
I whirled this mixture in my mini processor until the herbs were finely ground and everything was well mixed.

We were looking for a good blackened seasoning recipe and this was good.  Not as spicy as we were looking for, but we made some kicked up dipping sauce to go with the meat we were putting this rub on.  Next time, we will be adding a little more spice, but not salty as we have found wih other receipes.

Very good seasoning.  I made this to use on top of some cod, and it was very good.  I'm not a big fish eater, but this definitely helped!   This one is going in the recipe box.  Thanks!

I love this mix. I have been putting it on my fish. So far i tried it with trout, salmon and talapia, and I just smeared a little butter on then added the spices and baked it at 400 until it was done (about 20 or 30 minutes depending on the type of fish). I like the trout the best. I did cut the cayenne in half because not everyone can handle that much heat and I did add a little salt but not actually in the mix.

This was perfect! I decided last minute I wanted blackened chicken tacos and was able to whip this up in a heart beat. I subbed Mrs. Dash salt free italian seasonings for the thyme since I didn't have any. It came out great :)

This is a great blackening recipe.  I have made it a few times and it is super easy to make with mostly ingredients that I always have on hand.  I do have an 8 year old who it is too spicy for so if you might need to omit the cayenne for those with sensitive tastebuds.

Delicious as is.  I made this in a huge batch to give as gifts for Christmas.  I think if I made it again, which I probably will, I'll add just a TOUCH of sugar, just to take the abrupt edge off, but the spice is perfect, if you ask me. :)

Nice flavor, but definitely lacking in heat, even with 2 tsp of cayenne, when I tried it on blackened tuna steak. I added two more tsp of cayenne to the remaining blackening spice. We'll see how that works next time I use it.

This stuff is fantastic!  I love that there is no salt, so you can load on lots without over-salting your food.  Have used it on fish, shrimp and chicken.  Everyone loves it.  -  thanks for the recipe!

Good.  It was almost too hot for us, so I will probably cut back on the cayenne pepper next time.  I used this on chicken breasts.

Very nice.  I needed this for Rasta Pasta, and I didn't want to buy it (waaay too many spices in my kitchen already!) so this was the perfect sub.  It's also great that when you make spice mixes yourself, you can make exactly enough.  I loved the Rasta Pasta, and I definitely think this mix was key to that.  Thanks for the recipe!

I usually omit salt from recipes anyways, but love that salt wasn't even on the list. I did not have onion powder, but thought it turned out great anyways. The recipe made more than I needed (put it in a sirloin stir fry), so I had extra to use for later.

I love to have this on my salmon fillets.  I melt a little butter and spread it on the salmon.  Sprinkle a little seasoning salt, then sprinkle the blackened seasoning.  Bake at 375 for 15-17 mins depending on the size of the fillets.  Delicious!

Tried this on salmon tonight, lacked any flavor or spice. No way would I try this again. When I want a blackened season I want some spice and flavor this had nothing.

Tried it this way first time then I tweaked it a little. If you do the same amount of pepper but half blackvand half white, than double the salt so it's a 2-1 ratio(2 teaspoons salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, 1/2 teaspoon white pepper) you have a very flavorful true to style blackening seasoning. Very good on pork, steaks, chicken and mild fish like grouper, trout and tilapia.

HURRAY!!  At last!  A recipe I cannot improve on.  Perfecto for blackening anything from tofu to asparagus.  I don't eat meat, but a friend made blackened hamburgers and assures me it's the best.  Not pricy and NO SALT.

This was so good!  I try to cook with the least amount of salt possible, so I love that there was no extra salt in this seasoning.  I also love that I had everything in my cupboard already so I didn't have to go buy another mix!  Thank you!

Very good flavor, nice heat. Used rub on chicken breast and squeezed some fresh lemon juice while the chicken was grillin'. I am going to make a big jar of this to have handy. Thank You!

Was delicious..  I used a generous coating on both shrimp and salmon. The shrimp tasted just a bit spicier but maybe I was a bit more heavy handed or just that there was more spice to less volume of meat.  Both were awesome.  Spicy but not too much so.  I'm going to make this over and over.

Made this and store it in large batches. By far, my favorite mix. Flavorful without salt. That way I can add the amount of salt that’s needed.

I made this and read the reviews afterward. It was pretty spicy but very good. I’d cut the cayenne by about a third next time.

I've tried many blackening seasonings and all were ok but none what I would call great.   This one was easy to prepare ()less than 10 minutes) and the best balance of heat and flavor of any of the seasonings I've tried.  I made it exactly by the recipe.

I initially made this exactly as is and it was fabulous. Subsequently I altered it slightly adding seasonings I prefer in Greater amounts. I have since filled an empty oregano container with this mix. I chose it because the seasoning mix needs the larger holes. you will never go back to store-bought after this.

YUMMMMY! We had it on Chicken twice now and it was perfect both times. If you can find any in the store, the first ingredient is salt which makes it impossible to really crust your meat. With this stuff we load it on, delicious!

I made this at my husband’s request for my homemade chicken Alfredo (It turned out looking just like the pic). It made it so good! Froze the rest in a tight sealed container for later. Will try it on fish etc.

I really like blackened salmon but my husband doesn't so I usually just order it if we go out. I saw this recipe and gave it a try. There is no added salt like most of the commercial mixes. I have used it many times and even made up a batch for a friend who also thought it was the best.

I was googling for a good blackened seasoning recipe for me and my girlfriend and imagine my delight to find this recipe front-and-center at my favorite recipe website! I can't say how much we love this seasoning, right out of the gate. First, we didn't have any problem with the amount of oregano as others have had, but adjust as necessary. Next, we like things very spicy, so we bumped up the cayenne to 1 TBSP. Finally, we added a dash of curry as well. One of the great things about this is that it's saltless. My girlfriend likes much less salt than I do, and sometimes I would like to minimize salt intake for varying reasons. This recipe allows us to control the saltiness at will. It's amazing how much we could use without overpowering. We've already tried this on ground turkey, sautéed in avocado oil and butter to put on a sandwich or in tacos; it's also phenomenal on tilapia as some have mentioned. We’ve already decided to keep some of this in a bowl next to the stove for regular use. It’s magical! I can’t wait to try some as a rub on some meat for the smoker. We will be making A LOT of this in the future. Thanks so much.

I made this as is but did add a teaspoon of salt. Great Cajun mix that both me and my wife enjoy. Used some of this tonight in the gravy mix for mashed potatoes and the wife loved it. I've also used a pinch or two of this for store bought soup and it really adds flavor. Great recipe!

I used less than half the oregano and 1/4 to 1/2 the cayenne. I also added a bit of salt. I have made this three times THIS WEEK ALONE! It's a great mix of flavors. I covered my meat (first time was salmon, second chicken thighs) entirely, making sure each surface was covered with a thick layer of seasoning. Then, I fried each in a pan with butter. I made sure to touch the meat as little as possible, letting each side cook for 6-8 minutes. FOOLPROOF! I would recommend to anyone. This is seriously becoming a new staple recipe for me. Thanks so much!

I've never tried blackened anything, so I don't have any prior experiences to compare this to. Regardless, we liked the flavor exactly as written. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Hands down the BEST cajun mix. I live in Mexico and can't get any seasoning here so I made this. It was amazing on chicken! My mom came for a visit and brought some McCormick Cajun seasoning to me and I tried it… It was virtually flavorless compared to this seasoning recipe. I threw away the store-bought seasoning and will only be making my own from this recipe now! Make this, you won't be disappointed.

Excellent!! I do not like overly spicy, but I do appreciate a good "kick" and this is the perfect recipe for that.
I used it on basa fillet and my family loved it.

Delicious!!  I have made this seasoning many times now and get great compliments. Sometimes I may change the herbs if I'm short, such as the thyme to parsley. I like  the fact that it doesn't have salt because I like to use finishing salt at the end of bbqing my fish. My daughter likes to use this on chicken breast as well.

I've made this numerous times to use on pan cooked mahi mahi.  It's got a nice bite too it but is not over powering.  I always make a bunch and keep it in the spice rack.

Used the blackened seasoning on grilled chicken breasts - with pesto penne beneath. Very tasty- to approach Cajun status it needs more and different heat.

Will definitely make this again. I made a big batch of it and stored it. What can I say?  Its my families go to for everything spice.  The only changes I made was I added 1 tablespoon of cayenne, thats only because my family and I like really spicy food and 1 teaspoon of salt.  We use it on our seafood, especially salmon and chicken breasts.  Thanks so much for this great and easy to make recipe.

Pretty good and spicy. I used half of the salt and still found it salty (I am just not a salt-loving person, lol). This recipe filled 3/4 of a standard spice jar.

This is great. I make this in larger batches for my spice cabinet and have used it as gifts along with Taco Seasoning 1 and a few other marinades and dressings from this site! People love it, and I hate buying store bought seasonings laden with sodium and various forms of MSG, so this is great!

I ran out of the brand I generally used so I finally tried making it from scratch.  The heat level wasn't bad but I thought it could have used more flavor.  I added additional garlic powder and finally some Lawry's Seasoning Salt. I only added a pinch of oregano because I don't like it. Perhaps fresher herbs would have helped.

Love, love, love this!  Just made it yesterday and used it on fresh ahi tuna and fresh salmon.  Perfect heat - but make sure to add your own amount of salt as this is a salt-free mix.  Thank you for the great recipe!

This recipe it really helped me! I, too usually cook salt free but in this case salt was good. I modified it as follows: First of all, I don't actually "blacken". Burning food is toxic and carcinogenic. Don't do it! Use "Trader Joe's South African Smoke" for the basil (that will give you that smokiness), "Slap Yo Mama" **HOT** Cajun seasoning (make sure you use the hot version!) for the salt, black pepper, red pepper, and onion powder, add extra dried onions, and add enough water and olive oil to make a rub, and use a fresh clove of garlic not dried garlic powder. Use other ingredients in the recipe (oregano, thyme, paprika). You should have a nice, thick paste for a rub, but not so thick that you can't spread it well. And then rub it on some fresh tilapia– And cook just enough don't blacken– Use a little extra water in the pan so nothing dries out. Don't use full flame, and use a cover while cooking. When it's done there shouldn't be much water left but it shouldn't be at all dry or brown much less burnt. And that's going to be spicy and tasting good! O btw the way I didn't measure anything-I just kept adding the stuff until it looked and smelled right and I rubbed up that fish with the good flava' before cooking it.

This worked very well on a flank steak that I grilled for a steak salad.  I cut the cayenne pepper in half and I wish I wouldn't have.  I was afraid it would be too spicy for me, but next time I'll use the full amount.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, DJBPITT!

Easy to make, never goes wrong. Most importantly, the kids love it. Important: add salt to taste. Works really well on tilapia blackened in a cast iron skillet. Cheers!

Great, however I placed the seasoning in an iron skillet put it on the grill and heated it until it was blackening then threw green beans raw on it.  Oh, it was so good.

This is a great blend.  I just figured out that I have been wasting a lot of money buying blends.  This taught me that I can google anything and get the details of most any blend out there.

It's okay.... needs salt for sure. Wasn't super flavorful like one that we made previously. Add salt and it's much better.

Exactly what I was looking for!  I've been using Zatarain's Blackened Seasoning.  The problem is I like "spicy" so I sprinkle on a generous amount and then it's too salty.  Wish they would come out with a reduced sodium version.  Until then I'll be using this recipe since I have all the spices available.

Very good blend. Love that it is no salt added so I can adjust how I want. I use "Redfish magic" on one side of the fish fillets and this on the other for blackened flavor that's not overwhelmed by salt. Just add a tsp. of sugar for better caramelization. Thanks!

Delicious!!! I used it to season Swai fillets before I floured and pan-seared them. They were just right, in my opinion. Thanks a bunch for posting this seasoning mix. Oh, and I added 1 tsp of salt to a half batch. That was the only "change" I made.

My whole family loves this.   So easy.  I always keep some on hand in an old oregano dispenser and we use it on chicken and fish and it really gives it that little something

Excellent flavour, especially if you put it on fish and grill the fish on the bbq in a cage, so good.
