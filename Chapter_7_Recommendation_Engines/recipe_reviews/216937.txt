A good drink for dessert :) A way to cut down sweetness for anyone interested is to only use 3/4 cup pina colada mix and 1/4 cup cream or melted vanilla ice cream. It's takes away some of the bold coconut flavor.

Our resort called them Dirty Monkey's also.  I like a less sweet drink, so I cut back on the colada mix and freeze my banana first.  It makes it taste like you added ice cream without all the extra calories.
