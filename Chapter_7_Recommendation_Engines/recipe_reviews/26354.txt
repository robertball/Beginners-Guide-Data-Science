Okay - I know it means an extra step but I first did a quick-fry w/ the beef in a LITTLE olive oil and some all-season salt.  Then, I used 2 cans of low sodium beef broth instead of the water/bullion cubes.  I also ommitted the salt and used half the basil.  Finally, I added the frozen veggies during the last hour and a half of cooking (I didn't want them to get mushy by cooking all day) AND a small handful of macaroni noodles.  Thick but very good! Served with dinner rolls and it was a nice "autumn" dinner. Thanks!

Loved this!  Be sure to use a 5-quart slow cooker and sub in 6 cups of water with 6 cubes of bouillon but skip the salt and this will be the best vegetable soup you ever had!

This soup was delicious. I used 3 cups of water instead of two and also omitted the salt. I used crushed tomatoes w/ basil instead of the tablespoon of basil and it was wonderful. Thanks for submitting. I will be using this again

This is a very hearty soup.  Great things come to those who wait.  I followed the recipe as written, however I will omit the salt and cut back on the bullion the next time I prepare it.  It was a bit salty for my taste, but the meat was so tender it just melt in my mouth. What a great meal to come home to and warm up with!

This was so easy and good. I used chicken instead of beef. I did use all the cubes but did not add any salt. I also added some canned green beans and corn. Will make again!

I found it to be an excellent soup.  However, I did find ait quite salty.  I would omit the salt, due to all the bouillon in it

I am usually a wipeout when it comes to cooking with a crockpot.  I was surprised and relieved at how well this stew turned out.  Based on other reviews, I reduced the recipe down to 5 bouillon cubes.  This is a great stew for when it is cold outside!

I originally rated this a 5 in 2004.  I've been making it every couple of months since - so yes, it's still a family favorite.  I do agree with those that say that there is way too much salt and pepper in the original recipe - use as much as suits your taste!  I've also started using beef broth rather than water and bullion and it makes a big difference - great flavor without all the salt.

I made a few changes to this recipe. Used a can of beef broth instead of water and 2 beef bullion cubes instead of 10. Added some cabbage. I took this soup to a covered dish dinner and it got wiped out, destroying the idea there that married men can not cook.

I rated this soup 2 stars,because the original recipe was like a salt lick, I changed this recipe as follows: Browned beef,1 onion,3 cloves of garlic, and then put in the crock pot. I then added fresh carrots, celery, frozen vegetables, and fire roasted tomatoes,and 2 boxes of beef broth. Also added fresh herbs,such as basil,oregano,thyme and rosemary.No added salt and a sprinkle of pepper. I feel that this recipe needs a complete make over. I rate my version 5 stars ! Definitely not salty or bland ! :)

This is an excellent recipe, but I think it needs more liquid.  I'm wondering if it should be 2 quarts of water instead of 2 cups!  I cooked it for seven hours on low in my slow cooker and it was more like stew than soup.  After adding more water, it was delicious!

Yum! I cut the bouillon cubes to 8 as suggested. The soup was a bit to spicy for my daughter, but perfect for me. I also, used a 28 oz can whole tomatoes and slightly used the blender on them, because I didn't have crushed tomatoes. Very easy to make. Thanks for the great recipe. I used this recipe with left over roast and cooked it on the stove. It was easy and still very good. I still like the whole tomatoes in a blender better than the crushed ones. It just seems to taste better! Thanks for one of my all time favorite recipes!

I followed the others advice about less salt. I used V8 instead of crushed tomatoes. I also used onion powder instead of onions. I also left out the frozen veggies and added a bag of fresh baby carrots instead. I sliced them in 1 inch slices. When the soup was done cooking I added large cooked egg noodles to it. It was really good!!

This is really a delicious stew-style soup.  It is indeed very thick, but we personally love it that way.  I found that mine was better cooking for longer than the 8 hours suggested in the recipe....my potatoes weren't quite done and the beef was a little tough at 8 hours.  After 10 hours, it was perfect.  I followed the advice and cut back on the bouillon cubes (I used 7) and did not add the extra salt, and I didn't find it too salty at all.  Really, I think next time I'll bump it up to 8 or 9 cubes (that may help tenderize the meat some). Served with cornbread and my whole family ate it up (even the kids...4, 2 and 1)!  A keeper that I will make many, many times this winter!

I thought this was a great, easy little soup recipe.  My stew meat was a little tough, not sure why.  I might have lessened the cooking time if it weren't for the potatoes.  Make sure to chop them up very small, I think mine were too bulky.  I used 3 cups water, 6 cubes boullion, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper and just less than 1 tablespoon of dried basil.  I omitted the salt.

Excellent!!!  I recommend reducing the bouillon a bit, it's very salty otherwise.  Very quick and easy.  A great weeknight meal for working moms.

This would have been good, except there was enough pepper in it to kill a horse.  Seriously, I would make it again, but next time only 1/2 tsp of pepper.  We ate one bowl & our mouths were on fire.

Love this.  Make it several times a year.  Have made it as written, have substituted fresh for frozen veggies, substituted beef broth for the bouillon and I use a large onion.  Have also used barley in place of potatoes.  Hubby likes things a bit zippier so have added a few drops of hot sauce and a little Worchestershire sauce.  Just a good basic soup recipe.  It definitely needs more liquid than the 2 cups called for.  We enjoy.

After a couple of changes, this is our new family favorite!  Subbed beef broth (about 2-2 1/2 cups) for the water/bouillon combo and used 15 oz. can tomato sauce/14.5 oz. can diced tomatoes instead of the 28 oz. can crushed simply because that's what I had on hand.  Cooked for 8 hours on low, then the Crock-Pot switched to 2 hours on warm until we were ready to eat.  Absolutely delish!  I will make this again and again, I'm sure.

One thing to note; if you don't like basil, cut to 1/2 tablespoon.  The basil/pepper seasoning was very noticeable and gave it quite a bit of a kick, but still not too strong for my kids to eat.

Much too salty as originally written. Try low-sodium beef broth, beef stock, or  beef stock powder. Also, browning the beef cubes first makes a tremendous difference.

Just made this and it was SOOOO GOOD!!!!  I used 2 small cans of beef broth in place of the water and cubes.  I used 15 oz. of crushed tomatoes and 15 oz. of Hunt's tomato sauce for lasagna. I loved the basil in this (I used the freeze-dried) & I cut the salt and pepper back to 1 tsp. each and added a small bag of diced baby carrots and used 3 Lg. baking potatoes.  I did add one packet of suagr in the raw to off-set the bitterness of the tomatoes.  Mine was done and perfectly tender in 6 hours on low, but my crock pot does cook fast.   I will be making this often! Thank you for sharing your recipe!!!

The can of crushed tomatoes didn't work well for me - it ended up giving the soup a heavy tomato base, which I wasn't expecting and didn't care for.  If I made this again, I would use a can of diced tomatoes instead of the crushed, which I think would be much better.

This was okay. I used a box of beef broth instead of the water and cubes.  I also seasoned with garlic powder and worchesire sauce instead of the herbs.  The only thing that kept it from being 5 stars was that the potatoes didn't cook all the way and the onions were still hard.  Next time I make this I may zap in microwave for a few minutes prior to adding to pot.

Delicious! This was really good w/ some 3-cheese sourdough bread. I did add 1 more cup of water to make it a little soupier, cut down the buillion by half, and added another potato just because I like them a lot.

This recipe has an out of proportion of black pepper.  When I made the recipe it was so peppery that we were unable to eat it. I should have reallized that it was way too much pepper.

Excellent recipe.  I did add some fresh carrots and celery instead of the frozen vegtables.  Also it was more like stew then soup.

This recipe was an excellent "base" recipe.  I did take a few of the suggestions and modify the soup to fit my taste (3 cups water, no salt, less bouillon).    My husband did the potatoes and he left them really in really big hunks.  They didn't cook very well that way.  I'll know next time to get him to make them smaller.  We really enjoyed the soup and I will definitely make it again!

I eliminated salt and reduced boullion to 5 cubes. I also added shredded cabbage & celery. It wasn't the best, but was much better the next day. By the way if soup becomes too salty just add a few more potatoes to soak up the salt.

This recipe was too salty and too much basil. I really did not care for this soup. I ended up putting it aside and making something else for dinner that night. Disappointing!

This was a good recipe! I did make a few changes. I added 1 tbsp of Worchester sauce, 1 tbsp of Heinz 57, 1/2 tsp basil. For the canned tomatoes, I used diced Italian style. Instead of using frozen veggies, I used canned with the juices plus the required 2 cups of water. I also added a 15oz can of tomato sauce. Goes great with homemade cornbread.

I liked this a lot!! MY husband and his friend ate it right up. I reduced the boullion to 6 cubes, added more carrots, cut the salt requirement in half..increased to 3 potatoes. I found a can of crushed tomatoes that had an italian taste to it...it included oregano and basil in it. 
It was yummy!!

Much too salty--even cutting back on the bouillon to 6 cubes, and using less salt. Nobody would eat it! I'll stick to my old recipe.

This "soup" is much more of a stew, but I absolutely loved it!  I read in one of the other reviews that it was very thick and that's why I chose it.  I wanted it to be thick.  Although I would recomend cutting the boulion in half.  I doubled the recipe and only used 10 cubes of boulion.  Also, i do recommend using a little more beef than was called for.  I think it makes it a little thicker.  Thanks Allison!

Very easy and good.  I used beef broth instead of bouillon cubes, and halved all the spices (especially the salt) and it still had plenty of flavor.

This was the easist soup I've ever made. It was excellent except for the fact it was way to salty, the second time I made it I left out the salt and only used 8 boullion cubes.  It came out perfect.

This is a delicious recipe, but next time I am going to use less bouillon cubes or leave the salt out, it came out a little too salty soo I had to add more water.  But overall, I think I will make this again. This is also a great recipe to make in a larger batch and then freeze.

Absolutely loved this recipe. I made a few changes, omitting the onions, using 3 potatoes, instead of 2, and using only 3-5 bouillon cubes. It takes nothing away from the great flavor but cuts down on sodium. I will also add whatever veggies I have on hand, such as carrots, peas, etc. I usually don't like frozen veggies but you can't even tell frozen from fresh, they taste great. I like the thick consistency, so I use the 2 c. of water called for in the recipe. It's been a great way to get my kids to eat their veggies!! Also very popular at potlucks!! Thanks!

great to fix on a Sunday afternoon for Monday's dinner.  I did reduce beef bouillons to seven and didn't add salt. Also used crushed tomatoes with basil flavoring.  Also added extra cup of water. Everyone enjoyed...will definitely make again...don't forget the cornbread!!

This really was very good, and after reading reviews, here is what I did : I used big chunks of carrot and potato, so they wouldn't get mushy...used a whole bag of frozen grn beans instead of mixed veges...only used 5 bullion cubes and omitted the salt..used a little more than 2 cups water...i was out of crushed tomatoes, so I ran two cans of stewed tomatoes thru the blender..also browned the meat in olive oil with a little garlic powder....the only reason I didn't give more stars was that I feel 2tsp of pepper is WAY too much! I used 1 1/2 and it was still to peppery! Almost ruined the dish! Good basic recipe and obviously lends to a lot of creativity according to taste

After reading the reviews I decided to use 5 bouillon cubes and left the salt out. After four hours of cooking I sampled and it lacked taste. I added the additional 5 bouillon cubes uncrushed. I’m so glad I did. This turned out great it wasn’t over salty.

EXCELLENT!!  But you canNOT include all that salt.  I'm convinced it's a type-o.  Bouillon is normally one cup of water to one bouillon cube.  I added 3 cups of water and 3 bouillon cubes and a PINCH of salt (not a Tbsp!!).  It was soooo good on this cold fall night!

I like this recipe BUT the amount of black pepper in the recipe makes the soup not edible.  Especially for kids.  I will try this again but with 1/4 to 1/3 of the pepper and check seasoning at the end of cooking.  When I remake this the rating could change.  I gave the beef pieces a quick browning before adding to the pot which enhanced flavor and tenderness a bit.

This was very nice. I'm not sure where the dividing line between a soup and a stew is, but I sure thought this was a lot more like a stew. Not complaining, though. There was a decent amount of broth, but lots of chunks of meat and veggies in comparison. I made it exactly as written, using a yellow onion and 2 medium-sized red potatoes. I did forget to stir everything together before starting the slow-cooker, but even the veggies still on top cooked nicely after the full 8 hours. One complaint, though - this was much too salty. Considering that the ingredient list on the bouillon cubes I used showed salt as the primary ingredient, I'd skip the recipe's "1 tablespoon salt" next time. In fact, I think I'll make this again in the next several weeks, since I have 10 more bouillon cubes to use up. I liked this recipe a lot (despite the salt).

This was easy and delicious--my family devoured every bite! After reading the other reviews, I also omitted the salt, reduced the beef boullion cubes to 4, and added 1 cup of beef broth. I also substituted a 14 ounce can of diced tomatoes for the crushed tomotoes. I used fresh basil and rosemary, along with some dried oregano and parsley. Before serving, I stirred in a small amount of cornstarch dissolved in water to the bubbling soup to thicken the mixture slightly. It was a perfect meal for a chilly day and I will definitely be making it again!

Very...very good recipe. The only thing I changed was adding two cans of beef broth and a half cup of water instead of the cubes. I also browned the meat in a pan of olive oil before cooking. It was great and will be using again.

I made a 30 serving portion for a party of 24.  People came back for seconds.  Everyone loved it.  I omitted the salt and it was perfect.
I didn't have a crock-pot large enough so I  used a large stock pot.  I sauted the beef in a little bit of olive oil.  Added  all the ingredients ,Except the mixed vegetables, and cooked it on simmer, with a tight lid,  from 10:00 a.m. -  5:00 p.m.  I then added the mixed veggies and continued to simmer until 6:30 p.m.  It was cooked perfectly.  Everyone loved it!

I followed the recipe instructions to a "T" and found that the finished product was very spicy and not as tasty as I thought it would be. It would be nice if the recipe creator would forewarn people of that fact, so as not to upset peoples stomachs. I will not try or recommend this recipe to anyone with a delicate stomach.

This is my favorite recipe on this site.  Very easy, and positively delicious, especially served with a hearty bread for dipping.  I like to use frozen "vegetables for stew," which makes the soup chunkier.  Also, I use two packages of frozen vegetables, and don't put in the potatoes (there are potatoes in the frozen veggies).  As a side note, make sure to cook this one for 8 hours on low, and don't try and do it for 4 hours on high -- the meat will turn out tough.

This is a very easy soup to make and tasty.  I make it often during cold weather and freeze it for easy meals to take to work.  I cut down on the beef boullion because of the salt content.  I use from 6-7 cubes of beef boullion and do not add salt.  The aroma of this soup will draw a crowd!!

My husband and I were very happy with this stew (it is definitely more of a stew than a soup). I was lazy, though, and instead of using one bag of frozen veggies and two potatoes, I just used two bags of frozen stew vegetables (including potatoes).  Turned out great! I thought there was a bit too much pepper in here, though my husband disagreed.

Great recipe. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly and it came out too salty! The second time I didn't add the salt and much less boullion and it came out great! I feed it to a feast of guys who loved it!

This was great!  I followed the ideas of others and omitted the salt and reduced the boullion.  I added 2 carrot, 3 stalks of celery. 1 cup frozen corn and a can of green beans for the vegetables.  I have already given this recipe to 3 people who tasted it!

Too salty.  I used less than the TBS called for, and it was still too much, plus I added 3 extra cups of water.  Try 1/2 tablespoon next time.
Used 1/2 of the pepper called for as well.

I followed the directions exactly and we really liked it.  But next time I will only add 1 teaspoon of salt and 3 cups of water.  The meat was very tender and the soup looked so hardy.  It was really great and so easy.  It's the best recipe I have of all the veggie soup ones.

My rating is deceiving since I, like many other reviewers, changed the base recipe, so I guess I'm giving my version 5 stars haha.  I omitted the salt and used 5 bullion cubes instead of 10.  I added 3 bay leaves and used fresh veggies instead of frozen ones.  It was absolutely delicious!

Tons of potential, but I made some changes for my family's tastebuds.  I used all 10 broth cubes but skipped the extra salt.  I used 2 t. of pepper and it was way too peppery, so will cut down to 1/2 t. next time.  Very easy!  Thanks for the base recipe.

I made this & when it was finished it was more stew like.  Tasted GREAT!! I added more potatoes, and at the end I boiled some small pasta.  I added pasta & a little pasta water to thin it out a bit.  But, it was good both ways.  I had a lot left over since we are only 2 people.  I gave some away to my sister & her husband.  They loved it.  I will be making this again.  So easy even a caveman can do it.

This was a little salty, but really good.  Next time, I'll substitute tomato juice for the water to make a thicker soup and cut the bouillon cubes in half.  Beyond that, it was a great meal served with bread and butter that we'll definitely make again!

Great recipe, really nice soup, but I would definitely cut back on the salt.  By the end of the pot, it got to be almost unbearable (and I'm a salt lover!).  But that's a small change to make in an otherwise awesome soup.  The family LOVED it!

This stew has far too much salt and pepper. Even after reducing the amounts as suggested in other reviews it was awful. It was a was a waste of time and the food budget.

This is a very easy vegetable beef soup!  Made for a friend that just came out of the hospital - perfect comfort food.  I added two cans of V8 and used the best italian crushed tomatoes I could find (with basil added) for the sweetness of their tomatoes.  Turned out perfectly.  Thanks for the recipe.  Will be using this one again.

I have made this recipe many times and it is great!!  To get the potatoes to be done I cook it on high for about 4 hours and then low the rest of the time. Like other people have said cut back on the bouillon to at the most 6 cubes.  I also only use a teaspoon of Basil.  The last change is I put in 2 1/2 to 3 cups of water.  This is a great meal for leftovers.  I think it tastes even better the next day.

I changed a few things.  I used 1 can beef broth (omitted the bouillion cubes), a pinch of salt, and a pinch of sugar and pepper to taste.  I also omitted the potatoes.  I used a 28 oz can of whole tomatoes and crushed them by hand...I think this provided more juice than crushed tomatoes.  I also sauted 1/2 of an onion and added it to the soup.  With these changes, this was great and will definitely become part of my recipe collection.

This is delicious.  I used Wyler's sodium-free instant beef flavor bouillon granules and added a little salt at the end of cooking.  Will definitely make this again.

Yum!  We really enjoyed this.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I altered it somewhat.  I reduced boullion to 6 cubes and left out the salt because I don't usually cook with salt.  I also reduced pepper to 1 tsp so it wouldn't be too spicy for the kids.  It turned out really great.  I think next time I'll only put 5 cubes of boullion in or maybe try reduced sodium beef broth.  This is purely a personal choice.  My husband's family usually adds salt to whatever I cook.  As far as salt goes, I just feel like it's better to put in too little and add to it then to put in too much and no one will eat it.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will definately make this again.

I'll try it again without all that boullion.  10 CUBES!!  That's WAY too much.  Isn't the rule of thumb 1 cube/cup of water?  Even with the water from the tomatoes, this isn't justifiable b/c canned tomatoes have their own salt.

I upped this one to 16 servings and served it to 9 people for a dinner party. They LOVED it!! Almost all of them said it was the best beef "stew" they had ever had and I barely had enough because they wanted seconds and thirds. But it needed a few mods. I also used far less bouillion(only 10 cubes for 16 servings). I added some garlic powder for a little something extra(only 1tbs for 16 servings),used mostly fresh veggies, but the real kicker was about 1 1/2 cups of merlot which gave it a subtle rich flavor that compliments beef perfectly. Remember to use a merlot that you wouldn't mind drinking, not cheap cooking wine! I'll be using this recipe again, only for fewer guests so I can have more for myself!! I'll also add a bit more beef next time.

This is one of the easiest recipes I have made for soup.  I used venison rather than beef, and it came out great.  I also left out the salt, for the beef cubes have enough salt after making the broth.

I to omitted the salt and the pepper.And only used 8 boullion cubes. I think this needs more water or something. It was more like a stew. The kids loved it so that was a real BIG plus! So I will make it again just doctor it up a little.

I tried this for a inservice day for teachers.  They loved it.  My teenaged daughters wanted me to leave it at home so they could eat it, not a group of teachers.  I liked how easy it was, as I do not have a lot of time to spend in the kitchen.

Happy with the outcome.  But 10 bouillon cubes?  Used 2 cups of beef broth, low sodium, low fat instead and glad I did.  I like the peppery flavor but some might not.  Next time I'll cut back the pepper in half.

Loved this! Took another reviewers advice and browned the meat first, and only added 1 tsp salt, you can always add more later. So good! So perfect for these first few crisp fall nights!

I also brown my beef in a little olive oil. I used about a pound of boneless chuck roast cut up in chunks. I used fresh onions, celery, carrots and minced garlic. Plus added 1/2 bag of frozen veggies with carrots, green beans, peas, corn and 1can(no salt) diced tomatoes. I used low sodium chicken stock and no beef bouillon because it has mono sodium glutamate and has added salt. Use a little sea salt and black pepper instead. Put everything in pot now with browned meat.  I cooked on high about 4 hours then added frozen veggies and 2 cans (rinse first) whole potatoes. Cooked another 2 hours on high. It is perfect and not all the added salt. Enjoy !

Usually I've had good luck following recipes on this site, but this one did not work for me.  The meat was uncooked after 8 hours on the "low" setting.

The recipe was way to salty.  It called for 10 beef bouillon cubes crumbled and 1 T. salt.  Otherwise the flavors are good.  Just way to salty.  I just made it today and had to add 4 more potatoes to it and 4 more cups of water.

I reduced the bouillon cubes to 4 and eliminated the salt. I added garlic powder and used fresh carrots instead of the frozen vegetables. At the end of cooking, I added frozen peas. It was very tasty and not too salty.

This soup is so delicious!!  Truly the best tasting beef stew I've made- this is definately my new go-to recipe.  The only change I made, per other reviewers, was to use 3 cups of water and omit the salt.  Thank you Alison!

This was delicious! Even my husband who is not a big soup fan literally licked his bowl clean. I gave it 4 stars though because like previous reviewers,I halved the bouillion. I also used extra potatoes and fresh carrots for the veggies.

This is surprisingly good!  I made this exactly as directed with the only exception being I cut the salt back to 1 tsp.  It was impressive. The flavor was great with just enough spicy bite to it to impress my husband. This is a keeper. Next time I may increase the stew meat a bit to keep my picky husbands interest.

I never would have said this while she was alive, but this vegetable beef soup is better than Mom's.  I doubled the recipe and put 18 bowls of this in the freezer for the winter, when it will come out one bowl at a time and warm me and delight my taste buds!

Yummy :) I made a few changes, instead of the bouillon cubes I used a packet of lipton onion soup mix with a box of beef stock. It is delish. I did brown my beef cubes first too

This was outstanding: tasty & easy. I followed some of the other suggestions: half the bullion, increased water to 3 cups. Maybe it was the extra water, but 8 hrs was not long enough. The other adjustment: I reduced the pepper slightly. Both my wife & I loved it. Will definitely make it again.

was really good except I omitted the salt and added 6 cups of water with the bouillion cubes  I would think another TABLESPOON of salt would be way too salty for me

After all of the high reviews I tried this and cut out the salt.  Soup was still too strong and nothing special. I'll never make this again.

I made this in a hotel room!  I was trying to save money during a family wedding- and several of my sibs liked that idea.  Hotel food isn't exactly cheap, know what I mean?  This recipe was perfect - no pre-cooking of the meat, things I can find ready to go from the grocery shelves or simple chopping.  Threw it all into a crockpot and served with bread from the grocery store bakery.  I did cut down the 10 bouillon cubes to 6, but that was the only change I made.  It was a hit.   My "I eat no salt" mother loved it too!  Besides the fact that it tasted so good, the best part was that everyone kept saying "oh thank you for all your hard work!"  sure.  anytime.

I liked this recipe but I'm happy that I read the comments before I actually prepared it.  I cut down on the salt, added sugar and more water.  I still need to tweak it a little more but will definitely use a variation of this recipe again.

Great soup and very easy.  Like many people said, I left out the salt and cut the beef bouillon cubes down to 5.  Served with buttermilk bisquits.

I have made this soup twice.  First time I thought there was too much pepper so I cut it in half.  The second time I realized that it was way too salty.  I plan to make it again but wonder if the boullion could be the problem.  I really want to make this soup again because I know it can be great.

good basic slow cooker soup, I made mine with as little salt/sodium as possible so I added quite a lot more dried herbs/spices to keep it from becoming bland.  Freezes really well in a ziplock freezer bag.

I did alter this a little (not a lot) by doubling the recipe, I used 8 cubes of boullion for a double batch (didn't want it too salty), petite diced tomatoes for the crushed tomatoes, as I like chunky tomatoes in my stew, and even tho I used a 7 qt slow cooker, I had no room for the potatoes, so I poured off some of the broth from the soup and added it to potato water and partially boiled the potatoes I had for about 5 min (they were cut small) and then we added them to our soup as we spooned out our dishes. Hubby said this was the best beef soup I have ever made, and coming from him, that says a lot!!! Everyone loved it!!! Thanks for a great recipe!!!

This recipe is delicious. My kids loved it and I will definitely make it again.  Since I need to watch my salt intake I did not add the salt because of the amount of the beef bouillon cubes but it still was great.  A keeper in this house.

Very easy soup to make.  I gave it 4 stars because it is VERY peppery, and not my thing.  I will make this again, but I will at least half the pepper or add to taste once served.

I made this soup and we loved it. I did change a few things after making it twice now. I used only 4 boulion cubes and added no salt. I used 2 1/2 cups of water and it browned my meat in olive oil, and used paper towel to take off any
excess grease. My friends who came to lunch, loved it.

This was amazing. I did change a few things. It was a little too salty, so I added 4 cups of water. I only cooked for 6 hours instead of 8. I didn't use onions, but included extra potatoes and one extra tablespoon of basil. yuummmmy! i'll be making it again sooon!

I had to make some minor changes after the fact, but this recipe is a staple in my kitchen from now on! I agree with others, don't add the salt and use 3 cups of water. We followed the recipe to the letter and it was WAY salty! Once we added the extra water, though, it was DELISH.

I thought this was ok. I changed it by using 2 cups of beef broth and 1.5 tsp of salt. I just couldn't see using so many bouillon cubes, and I usually just use broth anyway. The veggies were a little mushy after cooking for 8 hours, and I just didn't love the flavor over all. I think in the future, I will use fresh vegetables and maybe omit the tomatoes. But won't use this recipe again.

A good, hearty soup, but, wow, is it salty!  I didn't add the additional salt and only put in 5 boullion cubes and it was still way salty!  I will make it again but will only add 3 boullion cubes.  I added more veggies and beef than the recipe called for also.  My kids and husband loved it!

This was good, but I must agree that it's WAY too salty.  I cut the recipe to 6 cubes, with no added salt and my salt loving husband said it was still a little too much.  I used fresh along with frozen vegetables, and will make it again.

Very good, like others, I reduced the bouillon, added onion and green pepper.  Next time I will add a few more potatos and I think I am going to add barley.  But even my daughter who isn't a big fan of soup licked her bowl clean.  Thanks

This was really good.  My husband said that you could can this and sell it!  The meat isn't as tender as I hoped, but overall this soup has a wonderful taste and was a big success!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

This was wonderful, however I did make some changes based on other reviews.  I omitted the salt, used three cups of water, halved the tomato (I used diced with basil), only used mixed frozen vegetables, and used 1.5 teaspoons of pepper.  The result was a great soup (not a stew) and was not too salty.  I will definitely make again, however may try using 9 bouillon cubes next time.  I served with a sour dough baguette and everyone loved it.

I really enjoyed this recipe, but my huband and family felt it had too much salt and pepper.  I will try to make it again with less boullion and no salt added, and halfing the amount of pepper.

Wonderful soup for cold evenings!  Served with corn bread and everyone loved it.  Froze the leftovers and served a few weeks later...Still very good.  I used six boulion cubes, added more water, and left out the Tablespoon of salt.

This was fantastic. We omitted the salt and boullion and used left over roast beef & pan drippings,instead of the stew beef. Also added some garlic powder and doubled the water as others have done. Extemely tasty and EASY!!!!We will definately have this again.

Very good.  I, too cut the boullion down to 5 and omitted the salt.  I thought the pepper was a little strong - my kids thought it was "spicy".  It was excellent leftover as well!

I thought this was outstanding! So quick and easy.  Only changes I made was to use about 2 1/2 cups of good quality beef broth instead of the water & beef bouillon cubes and I also added 4 large cloves of rough chopped garlic. I thought it definitely needed the full 1 Tbsp of salt but that might be dependent upon the type of beef broth you use. With some quick dropped biscuits, a great winter meal!  My husband also had a thought that it would be good with Italian sausage instead of the beef stew meat.  May try that next time.

I didn't have an onion so I used fajita frozen onion and peppers. I didn't have enough beef bouillon cubes, so I used some chicken cubes as well. Instead of crushed tomatoes I used diced and it worked out well. It was a delicious stew with a really good flavor!

This was so easy to make; I threw everything together right before leaving for work and dropping off two young children at school.  Just got home from work and it tastes awesome! Also made Pillsbury french loaf with it - perfect fall dinner.

This was a wonderful meal with a stew-like consistency.  I didn't have the beef bouillon at home so just seasoned the meat well with seasoned salt, black pepper, and minced garlic.  It was delicious!  I gave 4 instead of 5 stars because I can't imagine how salty this would have been with 10 bouillon cubes.

This was a really good recipe! I was craving soup for our first cool day of the fall season and this hit the spot.  I did add some lima beans and cauliflower to the recipe and omitted the potatoes (didn't have any).  The only other thing I changed was the bouillon.  I ran out of beef bouillon while making the recipe, so I went out and bought the thick beef paste-style bouillon.  I added about a tablespoon before serving and it made the broth very rich but not too salty. The whole family ate this up!

This soup is super easy. I don't know what the 10 cubes of boullion is all about, I only had three on hand so used them and increased the water to 4 cups, I did add a little salt at the end but this soup is awesome. I also needed to cook it longer because surprisingly the potatoes were still hard. I made some fresh bread and meal was ready. And it tastes better after a day or two, yum!

With adding many of the substitutions given, it was FABULOUS! Added an extra potato, and an extra cup or so of water with a broth paste. Everyone really loved the combination of tomato and broth. So yummy we finished it for lunch the next day, was even better!!! Mmmmm..

This recipe sounds really good with a fresh, hot pan of cornbread with a touch of honey mixed into the batter to give it that touch of sweetness in every bite.

Awesome soup! A little salty, but omitting the added salt makes it just about perfect!

This was a wonderful recipe. It came out just a bit too salty so next time I am going to go with slightly less boullion.

I really should have followed other pople's reviews as I made this according to the recipe and it was terribly salty. Next time I think I will use a can of beef consume instead of all the stock cubes and the water and also omit the stock. Also I think the pepper made it taste funny so next time I think I'll add it at the end just befor serving. Otherwise I think it would have been really nice. It certainly smelt fantastic and the texture of everything was lovely.

I swapped out the water/boullion for 2 cups of beef broth and used fresh corn & green beans rather than frozen veggies, but I have to say I was really disappointed.  After cooking on high for 4 hours (per one of the reviews about getting the potatoes done) I tasted this and the best word I can come up with is:  BLAND!  After adding a cup of red wine, 2 heaping tablespoons of minced garlic, 2 heaping tablespoons of basil, 3-4 bay leaves and a packet of lipton's dry vegetable soup mix and letting it cook another 3-4 hours it still lacked zing to me.

Doubled the recipe and only added 12 bullion cubes.  I didn't have frozen veggies, so I used canned corn and green beans.  We loved this recipe.  I will makes this over and over again!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  Made some changes, used 6 bouillon cubes, used stewed tomatoes instead of crushed, used a little less salt and pepper.  Turned out great, my husband loved it, and I will continue making it throughout the winter. THANKS!

eh, i didn't think this was all that spectacular, kinda blah actually. Did NOT use 10 bouillion cubes, WOW, that would've been a salt lick. Used half that and lots of worcestershire to make it palatable, otherwise booooring.

I certainly will NOT be making this recipe again.
Maybe it is a matter of taste but this was wayyyy tosalty .I omitted the salt and cut down on the beef boullion but it was still too salty and inedible .yuck.
My suggestion is to either cut the beef boullion cubes to maybe 4 or to used reduced sodium beef broth instead.

I seared the beef first and substituted the equivalent of 2 cans of beef broth for the water and boullion cubes... and it turned out perfect.  Sooooo much better tasting then canned and healthier too!

It tasted more like beef stew with so many beef bouillon cubes and very salty.  I WILL make it again with about half the bouillon.  Stew or soup it was very good and easy.

A very tasty soup.  I didn't think it was that salty, but way too peppery, I would definitely cut back on the pepper. I only used 6 boullion cubes and it was very nice.

I have this cooking now for supper.  I used hamburger instead of stew beef. Added a can of dark kidney beans too. A pinch of oregano with the basil and a dash of thyme. Will serve this with garlic bread. This is a great winter warm your bones recipe.

I had to put in more beef base and A-1 to give it more flavor. For some reason it was very bland. ( I didn't use the bullion as it's too salty usually. The beef base I use is low sodium.)   Then it was delicious! I forgot to take a picture :(

As written I suspect that this soup would have been a disaster. After reading the hints,  I cut way back on the bullion cubes and added additional liquid (water).  Vegetable wise I added everything but the kitchen sink.  The end result was a savory soup that required little effort and paid dividends in flavor.

after i seared the beef, i deglazed the pan with some beer; then put in slower cooker overnight for the beef to get tender (lid slightly open for evaporation) with the can of tomato juice, beef broth  and all the seasonings (thyme too). veggies were potatoes, carrots and mushrooms and frozen corn; so comforting!

This soup was really good, it was a little thicker then I normally like, which is why I only gave it 4 stars. I thought having a 28 oz of canned tomatoes in it was going to make the tomato taste over powering, but it didn't, though it does have a strong tomato smell to. Next time I make it, I'll try using 14 oz can of tomatoes and adding another 2 cups of water,  just to thin it out a bit, I may use 12 oz of frozen vegetables instead of 16 as well.

The best recipe for soup ever if you added flour to the meat it would be a great stew. But I wanted the soup first.

Leave out the salt because it makes it far too salty.  I also left out the potato simply because we didn't want it in the soup.  I suspect the potato would absorb some of the salty taste.  Once I did that, we loved this soup and have it regularly in our house.  It's easy to prepare before you go to work and then you come home to a hot supper.  Pair it with a good baguette or a salad.  Voila - dinner!  This is a new staple for our household.

This recipe was very easy.  Like others I did not use the salt, basil, or bouillon cubes but it still turned out good.  I just got my slow cooker.  I will come back for more recipes for my cooker.  This site is very helpful.  Thank you.

Way way too salty...the 10 boullion cubes must be a typo.  We dumped the whole thing out.  Take the advice of others and reduce the cubes at least to half.

I followed the advice of others and omitted the salt, and only used 9 cubes. I made this with 8oz frozen peas, 8oz frozen corn, 3 fresh sliced carrots, and 2 sliced celery stalks. Also used Yukon Gold potatoes. This was very simple and perfect for a cold Chicago dinner with some warm bread. I would make this again, but again using the above modifications.

Yummy recipe!  I just got a slow cooker.  This is the first recipe I've used.  I used a pound of stew meat, frozen pearl onions, and only a sprinkle of salt.  Everything else was the same.  Next time I would probably use a little less pepper and no extra salt.  The bouillon cubes have plenty already.  I let it cook for about ten hours while I was at work and it turned out great!  The meat was so tender!  I will make this again.

Maybe there is a typo in the ingredients list---1 tablespoon of salt is WAY too much, I won't make this recipe again, but if you're going to try it, I would recommend maybe 1 - 1/2 teaspoons instead.

Fantastic!  Never thought to use a chuck roast for soup before, but the family LOVED it!!  I didn't use frozen vegetables (had some time), but put some turnip in with the carrots and celery and onion.  Easy and filling.

the recipe is way, WAY too salty as it is.  Cut the salt to less than half, and use on 6-8 bouillon cubes.  The stew would have been great except for the saltiness, which made me slightly sick.

I left out the salt and used only
half as many bouillon cubes, and it
turned out great.  The had only large bouillon cubes.  I'm not sure of the difference.  I think this would be good served with corn bread.

These kinds of soups/stew are fabulous.  People, all good cooks do everything "to taste" you don't need to follow a recipe to the T.  If 10 stock cubes is too much, half it, then do the taste test!!  cheers

Fabulous stew! I made it for my mother in law and she was in awe of how delicious it was. Very easy to make and since all slow cookers vary I find mine is done quicker than 8 hours!

This was the first time I have made soup in a crock pot.  It was wonderful!!  I cut up everything the night before and when I got up in the morning just put all the stuff in the pot and left for work.  I didn't use the salt and pepper because we both have different tastes but it was just right without them.
My new husband told me I could make this for him anytime.
