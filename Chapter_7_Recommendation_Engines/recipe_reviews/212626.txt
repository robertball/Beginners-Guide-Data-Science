I thought this was really tasty, just a slight hint of spice, so nothing extremely hot.  Very quick as well.  I add chopped tomato to mine right before dishing into tortillas.

We made this the other night only with minor changes.  We had left over cooked cubed chicken.  Warmed in olive oil.  Added the other ingredients except used cheddar cheese canned soup for the creamed chicken.  Added spices as is.  Topped it off with a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies.  Heated this all together on the BBQ pit.  Awesome.  Linda Farrell

Ok, but not great.  Tasted like cream of chicken soup, with the other ingredients just floating around in the cream of chicken soup.

The chicken soup made for an interesting twist on fajitas.  It was good, but it wasn't really "wow."  I'd make this again but I'll keep searching for the "perfect" fajita recipe.  As far as easiness, it was definitely 5 stars!

I did not use the soup, and instead of the different seasonings, I used a pack of taco bell fajita seasoning. I also used 1 red pepper in addition to the green. I served this with sour cream, salsa, lettuce, and tomatoes. They were great!

This is our family's favorite way to make fajitas. I always add some taco seasoning for extra flavor but that's really the only change I make. This recipe is super easy and delicious!

Excellent!  My 5-year gobbled a huge fajita down within a few minutes.  We didn't have any cumin on hand so substituted for caraway seeds.  Also added red and yellow peppers.  Topped with lettuce, avocado, tomato, cheese, and salsa.
