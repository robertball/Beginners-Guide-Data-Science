Awesome soup! Different and so healthy!  Excellent, unique flavor.  I omitted the noodles to comply with the Atkins Diet (saved time also).  To save time, you could use packaged egg noodles and use frozen chopped kale, thawed.  I added salt at the end per directions, but it really needs to be added in the beginning to properly season the soup (adding it the end just didn't permeate the broth well).  Next time, I'll add 1 tsp. salt to the chicken and garlic. Thanks so much for the recipe!!!

Tried this recipe because it sounded healthy and interesting.  My husband and I both liked it and we dug into it with much skepticism.  Neither of us had ever eaten many of the ingreidents and I thought it was smelly cooking.  But, with a little hesitation we tried it and it was great (and tasted better with each spoonful.)  I did not add the curry (don't like it) and this soup was still full of flavor. And, oh my, check out the "Detailed Nutrition" information.  Lots of vitamins in this one!

Make sure to save the broth & garlic the chicken simmered in. I had to add 1/2 a box of chicken broth on top of the broth that I saved. This was AMAZING. (I left out the curry-- didn't have any).

I really did not like this soup.  The soup was just too much of everything and didn't taste at all like chicken anymore.  If you like kale A LOT, it might agree with you.  But, after trying to eat a big bowl of it for lunch after making it last night, I have to say that I will not be making it again.  Sorry, Magic!

Try to be smarter than me and don't beat the noodle dough with an electric mixer.  And don't try to start rolling the dough when its too wet.  But that problem was partly because I don't think the proportion of flour to eggs is quite correct.  It needs either more flour or less eggs.  But it was quite yummy when finished.  Use a really big pot.  You might even use two pots.

I'm giving this 4 stars because it's really yummy, but not SUPER AMAZING  (get the difference?  I'm really enjoying it, but I'm not in ecstasy).  Also because I didn't make that recipe - I didn't have all the ingredients O:)  Basically, I followed the recipe but with chicken thighs, and I left out the cilantro, and kale.  I used 2 regular onions, and frozen spinach.  Also, I doubled the spices, and ended up having to add in an extra 4 cups of stock.  And, come to think of it now that I look at the recipe again, I completely forgot to put in the balsamic vinegar.... I might go back and add that to see what happens.   What I'm eating is pretty darn yummy nonetheless.  Also, in my opinion it's the homemade egg noodles that really make this good. I would NOT recommend subbing store bought pasta unless you're in a huge hurry.

I didn't have time for the homemade noodles and opened a package of large sea shells. Next time I will make the noodles. I just used chicken breasts since I didn't have a whole chicken on hand and breasts are easier to shred after boiling. I added a can of chicken broth towards the end to add more broth and flavor since it was getting a little thick for me. I nixed the kale since I didn't have any and don't care for the flavor. But I added frozen peas instead. It took a ton of salt, curry and poultry seasoning to beef up the flavor. I like to be patient with my soups and continue layering the flavors. Including adding more garlic towards the end. The outcome was fanatastic though and my kids loved it. We added a healthy dollop of sour cream before serving. Will make again. Thank you.
