DELICIOUS! If I could give these more stars I would...soooo flavorful! The only downside is that they are messy to prepare, but the taste more than makes up for that. I seasoned my egg w/ garlic powder and seasoned salt, just because that's what I always do when I'm coating something w/ egg. Oh, one tip, def pour you beaten egg into something long and shallow b/c asparagus don't like to bend much (even the thinner ones), so that makes life easier, lol. These really were wonderful...I will def be miking these again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
