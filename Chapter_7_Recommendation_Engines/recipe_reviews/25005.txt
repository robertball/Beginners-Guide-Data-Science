I made the frosting, frosted the cake, and ate some within an hour.  The bourbon was kind of overpowering, and this is coming from someone who likes bourbon a lot.  However, by the next day it had mellowed and was really tasty.  Next time I would either try adding less bourbon or making it the day before I was ready to frost the cake.

This is great on carrot cake if you reduce the amount of bourbon.  I had to reduce the bourbon to 2T b/c the bourbon was overpowering and the icing became too thin.  The icing is still really thin w/ 2T, but the taste more than compensates for the "thinning" look of the icing.

Disappointing if you're after the bourbon flavor, which of course I was.  Because I'm very familiar with this classic cream cheese frosting, what happened with this is just what I expected, so I should have known better.  If you're looking for a rather thin glaze, then 5 T. of bourbon might  work just fine.  However, if you want a nice, thick, spreadable *frosting,* then 5 T. of bourbon is at least 4 T. too much.  I used 1 T., and found I still had to add extra powdered to make it stiffer.  With only that 1 T. of bourbon, we were not able to taste it at all.  Whether you use bourbon or any other liquid in this cream cheese frosting recipe, start out adding a little at a time - and certainly not 5 tablespoons!

Delicious frosting but don't let the bourbon fool you; it will taste strong when you make it but the next day you will hardly be able to taste it. Everyone loved it though !

Delicious!  I used the suggestions of other raters and substituted orange liqueur for the liquid... perfect for fall spice or carrot cakes.  A keeper.

This recipe right here IS the business! I followed other reviewers advice and slapped this on the A-1 Banana Cake. The folks I made it for loved it and I snuck a taste off the spatula...heaven! BTW, the bourbon isn't overwhelming, so use the alloted amount. I can't thank Pooka enough....love you for this!

Great base recipe.  I would advise low simmering the bourbon in butter to heat off some of the alcohol taste.  I've made twice now, the second time when I was simmering butter and bourbon I added some light brown sugar to round the taste of the bourbon, perfect.

I used my sweet, sweet brown sugar (Maker's Mark) and I highly recommend imbibing as you prepare.  Using the full 5 T of bourbon makes more of an icing than a frosting, but I put it on some brownies and they were highly delicious.  I would certainly consider eating a live animal if they had been properly covered with this icing, perhaps even my dog and he is my best friend.

I made this frosting and frosted a fresh banana cake with it.  Took it to a family birthday and it was a BIG hit!!!  Use all of the bourbon, because the next day it really mellows out...will use this recipe again!!!

This frosting was great on a butter pecan cake. I added 2 TBS. of bourbon to the cake for flavor. I used 4 1/2 cups of powdered sugar instead of 4 it was a big hit. thanks for the recipe.

Tasty!! I followed directions and no, the bourbon (Woodford Reserve) wasn't overpowering. It's just like most every other dish... Use superior ingredients if you want superior results.

This frosting is amazing!!!! This is my go to frosting. I will never again use the store bought frosting. I added about 2 Tbsp of irish cream liquor and 5 Tbsp of bourbon. I didnt have a runny texture with this at all. It was the PERFECT consistancy. I'm pretty sure everyone liked the frosting better than the cake...

For this much bourbon you should double the butter and cream cheese. Also without the bourbon it's great with just 1 C confectioner's sugar, 8 oz cream cheese and 1/4 c butter. Add 1 tbsp vanilla.Yum!

This was fantastic -- everyone who tried it raved about it! I used about 3 tablespoons of bourbon and 3 tablespoons of milk to make more of a glaze, as I wanted to drizzle this over a bundt cake. I definitely agree with the other reviewers that 2-3 T of bourbon is plenty, and any more than that will make the frosting too thin to spread (if you're looking for a more spreadable frosting rather than glaze).

I used 3 tbs of bourbon, and it was still too runny.  If you want an icing or a glaze, use 5.  If you want a true frosting, use 2.  I also added 1 tsp of vanilla extract.  Also, definitely, definitely make this a day in advance.

When I first read the recipe i thought it would make and incredible additional to the Italian Cream cake I have been making for years.  While I very enjoy the taste the frosting, The 5 tblspns of Bourbon made the frosting a little too thin for decorations.  I even added an extra package of cream cheese.  Is isnt runny but just too soft for functionality.  Incredible taste though.

Probably the best frosting on the planet for people like me who abhor frosting. Usually I just wipe off frosting, but this one, this one I had a half inch thick on cupcakes and didn't leave any to waste! I did have to tweek the amount of liquor to 2 tblsp. like all the other reviews note. I used Appleton Estate Rum instead of bourbon. I know it would be excellent with bourbon as well, but I was using the frosting to top off key lime cupcakes, and wanted to keep the geography of the ingredients the same. Thank you so much for this recipe!

I made this with Banana Cake X (from this site) in a 9x13 pan on Saturday. By Monday night it was gone and my family was asking when I was going to make it again. I used the full five tablespoons of bourbon but only a little more than three cups of sugar. The result was a creamy, not too sweet frosting with a nice hint of bourbon that even my nine year old didn't find overpowering. I will be looking for other cakes to pair with this frosting.

Okay, I made the frosting per the directions.  It was a little runny, but I was able to frost a red velvet cake just fine.  What I didn't like about it was I found the bourbon flavor to be a bit strong.  I used Maker's Mark (which I think is decent) and the smell of the frosting was even overwhelming.  Next time I'd probably cut down on the bourbon, or put it on a spice cake or carrot cake or something that can stand up to the flavor a little better.

Yes I agree about less bourbon, I used 2 1/2 tablespoons and it was just perfect! I made it on Moist Chocolate Cupcakes! Everybody loved it! Also I put the frosting in a bag to pipe it on. It worked alot better after putting the frosting in the freezer for just 15mins! I will use this recipe Alot more often!

Made this for a carrot pumpkin cake and it was terrific! The bourbon flavor is great, and I'm sure it will be be even better after it mellows a bit.

Loved this recipe! I did however instead of using bourbon used amaretto instead. Gave it a very nice sweet flavor that really added to the cream cheese. Thanks!

I found the bourbon just a little bit to strong for my liking.  I made this for your classic carrot cake and the bourbon just didn't go all that well with the cake.  The next time I make this, I will use a really good vanilla extract, other then that, this is a nice and easy recipe.

I loved this frosting!  I made a half recipe and drizzled it over the Pumpkin Cake III from this site.  Everyone loved it!  I thought the bourbon flavor was right on, but it did mellow overnight.  Next time will make the whole recipe so I can eat the rest with a spoon!

This was excellent. I did sub mascarpone for the cream cheese, just because I like the creamier flavor. Used 4 T of good bourbon and 1 t vanilla.  Added confectioners sugar until I got the  thickness I wanted, which was quite stiff enough to frost cupcakes, probably 4-5 cups.   The bourbon was not overwhelming nor was it "alcoholy."  Will use this recipe again!

I used Amaretto instead of bourbon, since that is what I had in my cupboard.  It turned out great!  At first, people said they could not taste the Amaretto.  Then after a few seconds they all said "Wait, there it is!  Man, that's good!"

Wow. I made this and put on top of some sour dough cinnamon rolls. The 5T of alcohol was perfect for this application. The frosting was loose so it dropped into the folds perfectly. Stiffens when cold.

As other reviewers, it's a bit runny for a layer cake but I doubled the cream cheese and butter and added additional powdered sugar until it was close to the right consistency. Left the bourbon at 5 tbs. I refrigerated both the cake and the frosting prior to frosting which I think helped as well. I was able to frost my layer cake without issues.  Did a spice cake with caramel filling. It was deliousness!

this was amazing!
I used it for a red velvet cake for my boyfriends grandmother and there was no cake left!
I saved the extra icing to snack on and last night I tried to toss the leftover in the sink but every time i tried one of my boyfriends friends would want to come get a spoonful, I ended up leaving it on the counter and they ate it all!
will be making again!!

I made it for my pumpkin bunt cake. It was easy to make and was a great compliment to the cake (which needed a bit more spices for my group)!  I only used half as much bourbon which seemed to cut the sweeetness of the confectioner's sugar to a more tolerable level. I also did not add the cream cheese as some of my recipients do not like cheese; cream cheese , in particular. It was a nice ganache-like consistency; perfect for my application. Highly recommend. Next time I'll try the cream cheese and full amount of bourbon. Yum!

I made this with Irish cream liqueur instead of bourbon on St. Patty's Day. I only had 3 1/2 cups of sugar, so it was a bit soft. Putting it in the fridge for a bit stiffened it up and made it easier to spread. It was so delicious on chocolate stout cupcakes, regardless of my changes. Can't wait to make it again with bourbon (and the correct amount of sugar)!

This recipe was delicious on a red velvet cake!  Such a good and adult twist on a staple favorite (cream cheese icing)    I used 3.5 Tbsp. of Bourbon and 2 Tbsp. of white rum... the flavor was not too strong and only noticeable in a large bite... several people inquired about what flavors were in it and were guessing things like 'lemon' 'almond' etc. so the alcohol taste wasn't overbearing that way.

This was okay!  Nothing spectacular about it.  I followed the recipe to a "T", until I realized that I didn't have the bourbon!!  I used spiced rum instead but still found that it was kind if runny.  That flavor was interesting though, but good one the carrot cupcake recipe!!!
