Quick, easy and super tasty !!
For an add flavour boost....I soak the craisins in 2 tablespoons of Grand Marnier along with the orange zest, usually let sit over night if possible.
I sprinkle sanding sugar on top of the loaves before the first bake, gives a nice look and a crunch.

This was a great biscotti recipe!  Unfortunately my grocery store doesn't carry orange extract so I had to leave that out.  I added a extra orange zest to make sure that I would get the orange flavor and substituted with vanilla extra.  Received a number of compliments and will be making this again soon!  I also needed to add to the baking time to get a nice crunchy biscotti.

I bake biscotti twice a week and have a pretty extensive collection of biscotti recipes. This one is among the best.

I loved these Cranberry-Orange Biscotti. I followed the directions as stated except for the second baking. 7 minutes on one side did not result in a crispy crust. To get a crispy biscotti, I had to bake them 7-8 minutes on both sides. Depending on how crisp you like your biscotti the second baking time will need to be longer. The dough was so easy to roll out. Some biscotti recipes have sticky dough. This dough was not sticky.  I loved the orange zest along with the orange extract and cranberries. I cut off the ends, and of course I had to taste the biscotti.  Delicious!

I did make changes the second time I made them. They were great both times but I wanted more orange flavour so I added 1/2 tsp of triple sec and a squeeze of orange juice from a 1/8th slice of orange. I also added slivers of almonds and white chocolate chips. If I had white chocolate in bar from I would have added chunks instead.

Made this as written.  Really good, very simple.  Packaged it in pretty seasonal bags and gave away to friends for the holidays, but of course had to keep some for the house!  will definitely be making this again.

Excellent recipe, I made one addition which was 2Tbs of orange juice because my dough was a little dry. Canadian flour absorbs more liquid than American flour so I always need to adjust the liquid in most recipes. Will definitely make again, Thanks for sharing.

I'm not a baker or chef and likely have no business in the kitchen. That being said, the recipe was easy to follow, prep and finish. The taste is phenomenal. My only complaint is the time and temp the recipe calls for.  Now before anyone comments that oven temps vary, i know that! I have a two year old oven and have a thermometer in the oven (although I'm not a baker or chef, but my wife is...). Lol!

I made two batches one following the recipe to the letter and I had to bake that batch about 8 extra minutes and then after slicing and placing them back in the oven to finish them, that also took about 8 minutes longer...

The second batch I bumped the temp up to 375 and that one was perfect at the recipe times.

All in all, a great recipe!

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly but cooked them at a higher temperature (375). My family couldn't stop raving about them... when their mouths weren't full!

First time making these, so I followed the recipe precisely. I added the orange zest, along with the extracts.  Information on length of logs would be helpful, after dividing the dough, the cook is left to guess on how long/thick to make the logs.  My oven is accurate, but after baking the maximum recommended time, they were still very underdone. Added 10 minutes and they were beginning to brown, but still underdone in the middle. Added 10 MORE minutes and let cool, then sliced - still somewhat dense and doughy in centers. the slices were normal biscotti sized, so the logs weren't unduly thick when first baked.  the second bake took a long time, because the slices had to be turned and re-baked several times. When they were finally crisp enough and cooled a bit, I was very disappointed at the blandness of the taste - the orange flavor was barely there, even with the extracts AND the zest. Boring and ho-hum. I suppose with a ton of tinkering, this recipe might be okay, but why bother with a total makeover?  I'll glaze these with a strong orange glaze so they're edible, but I won't make these again.

Excellent recipe. Temp of oven was perfect for 25 mins. Just don't make them too fat - then they will cook perfectly. Also, at the end at 300, I baked 7 min. on one side, turned over, 7 minutes on the other side and then 7 min upright. They were perfect and not too hard.

first biscotti I've ever made.  followed the recipe like it read, because basically I can't stand when I read a review and it states; I added this, omitted that , ...  then it 's a totally different recipe.   it came out great, only thing was it didn't cook completely in the center of one of the logs.  it was thanksgiving so the stove was sharing space-may have affected it.  I sliced it when it cooled and had to cook 16 minutes for it cook through.  then I just left it in the stove and turned it off.  came out very good.  I would make it again.  it was easy and fun and tasted great.

This is a great recipe. I made each piece smaller (shorter), making it possible to get 24 out of the recipe. I thought the calories listed were too high so I entered the ingredients into a calorie creator and found that with the smaller pieces, each piece is only 90 calories. For the second baking, I baked them 5 minutes, then turned them over and baked another 5 minutes. I've had nothing but raves with this recipe.

I made these last year and they were so yummy.  It was the first thing I was asked to make this year. They are in the oven now and my house smells amazing.  I will be topping with an orange icing glaze.

I cut out 2 pieces of cardboard 2x12” and put them underneath parchment paper to shape the logs exactly the same size and width, this made this step so much easier.

Delicious! Very sticky dough and, after the first bake, was very crumbly when cutting for the second bake. I had to be very careful when moving the cut pieces to the pan. I do not like almond flavoring so I used vanilla instead. Otherwise, followed recipe

I successfully used fresh cranberries that I had pulsed in the food processor- this makes for a slightly sticky batter, though not intolerably so. Just flour your work space and hands before rolling the dough into logs. Also, I didn’t have orange extract so I used about 3 Tbs zest. They are delicious and fresh! My cook time on the first bake was about 8 minutes longer than the recipe with my oven set at 375 F. Go with the recipe’s time guidance at first and then adjust in subsequent batches. These are fantastic.

Never having made biscotti and having a party to throw, we have made 4 kinds in the last two days. This was our first batch and by far the best. I am returning to this recipe as the base. I am now about to try it as a lavender biscotti.

We can't stop eating these. The only little extra I did was to dip the bottom edge into some melted white or dark chocolate for just a bit more holiday gifting appeal. Excellent recipe.

At 1st we rated 4 stars, but if you can let them sit another day they are even better & get 5 stars. We put an orange glaze over, but next time would try dipping in almond bark or frosting. Hubby had to bake 35 min.  Hate to admit this by they didn't last long for 2 logs.  They went down real easy & were gone in 3 days for 2 people.  Hope to make soon again & maybe get some in the freezer. Think I like these better than my cappuccino biscotti recipe.

Made the Orange cranberry biscotti today. Loved the taste and texture. I also substituted the Orange extract for vanilla, added 1.5 Tabs of Orange zest and 2Tabs of fresh squeezed orange juice.  They were gone in no time. My husband took some to work and ecerybody loved them!  Thank you for a great recipe., I will make these again and give away for Christmas!
