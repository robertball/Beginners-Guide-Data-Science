I submitted this recipe, but wanted to make a note about the recipe as Allrecipes has "edited" it.  I submitted "Southern Comfort" as a specific ingredient, NOT "peach flavored bourbon liqueur" - Southern Comfort is ORANGE in flavor!  I have gone "store-brand" on the other ingredients, but have NEVER strayed from the real Southern Comfort...

Tried it, loved it. Southern Comfort is actually a peach flavored liqueur infused with orange and other citrus flavors.

Good drink, a little sweet and filling. I didn't find it as strong as many reviews stated. Only complaint is that a lot of guests weren't fans of pineapple juice
