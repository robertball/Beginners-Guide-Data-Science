Sorry but this recipe was a very big disappointment...the recipe itself was picked out by my husband which looked and sounded very good but the cookies themselves were not.  They were a light brown, beyond flat, rock hard and with trying every way possible to bake them including changing cookie sheets to refrigerating the dough before baking them, they still did not turn out and absolutely nothing seemed to work!!!  I made these cookies not once but twice because I figured that I had forgotten something in the first batch but not only did I use new baking soda (? why they are so flat) but also payed close attention to the recipe and did everything right the second time (I think) with no satisfaction.  The dough was great and tasty but only before baking.

I made these for my 100th birthday party!  Let's just say they didn't look too good at first when I hand-kneeded them, but they tasted fantabulous.  :)  Thanks for the recipe!

these are by far the BEST chocolate chip cookies i've ever had.
as other's have stated, the time is usually less than 14 minutes, usually 10 or 11...and if you don't want them to stick to the ungreased sheet, then put foil on the cookie sheet *works everytime*
i made these in addition to another chocolate chip recipe at the same time, and everyone said they liked *the darker ones* (these ones) better!

I just threw out all my other chocolate chip cookie recipes! We have made this recipe three times now, and they are wonderful! Chewy, but not doughy, and very flavorful! The last time I added cocoa powder too...triple chocolate chip!

I am thrilled with this recipe!  I didn't have quite enough chocolate syrup, so I substituted a coffee/chocolate syrup called Ice Java, and it worked out so well I did it the second time I made them.  I also used parchment and baked for closer to 9 minutes.  I also added chopped walnuts.  I love the way they stay chewy.  Thanks so much Stephanie!

This recipe is killer.  It was a great starter recipe and it tasted very good.  I can't believe they stay soft.  I will definatly recommend this.

I didn't have any baking powder but the recipe still came out very good.  I like it better than my own recipe.  My husband loved them too.

These cookies are so awesome.  My friends and family love 'em.  They're not the cheapest cookies to make but oOoOo! those cookies are good!  I like to make 'em nice and big and they turn out resembling those bought at the store but of much better quality.  Classmates that have sampled these cookies are jealous that my cookies come out so well and ask me to bring 'em to class so that they can devour them. *LoL* I made these for a bake sale in which I was only required to bring ten baggies valued at a $1 a piece but brought 20 baggies;  by the end of the night, I found that most of them had been sold.  A guy I knew commented on how soft they were in such a way that it conveyed they idea that he was pleased/impressed.   These are definitely cookies that require some work and care -you've gotta watch them in the oven but overall, once you've gotten a batch that's just right some time in the beginning, you can stick to it.  Pay attention to the syrup proportions and don't mix up the measurements for the choco syrup and corn syrup -I did and I had to quadruple an already tripled recipe.  My mom and I STILL have cookie dough -not that the family's complaining about fresh cookies or anything.  ^_^

I just made three batches of these in three days! So many cookies were gone from the jar by the time i wanted one, so i had to keep making more! I will never be in search of a recipe for chocolate chip cookies again. It is worth it to go out and buy corn syrup if you dont have it...i think it really made a differance. Parchment paper and the lesser baking time were really helpful too. I have never had more success with a recipe and i bake often!

These are wonderful!  I used semi-sweet and white chocolate chunks.  I baked them for closer to 11 minutes.  I also used parchment paper and every one came out beautifully.

i suppose, with such a high expectation set, anything below perfect would come as a disappointment. when i first read the negative comments in some reviews, i thought they were harsh. however, i am prone to partially agree. it isnt that the cookies tasted all bad; on the contrary, i thought they were pretty tasty. the problem lies in the immense size and flatness. they look noithing like the picture and are extremely hard to get off the pan. i recommend a shorter cooking time at lower heat. dont let them cool on the pan too long. not the cookies you want for presentation.

I added chopped walnuts.  A little too rich and sweet for my taste, but really very good.  My husband and children loved them.  If I make these again, I will use a tad less white sugar.

We did like these cookies.  The chocolate syrup really adds something.  Feel free to hunk up chocolate bars--it works well.  Check the cookies before the 12-14 minutes--mine were done sooner.

Excellent chewy, rich cookies. I followed another reviewer's advice and lined my cookie sheets with tin foil and reduced the bake time to 10 minutes--perfect!

Best chocolate chip cookies out there! I swear my family thinks I am a better baker than Mrs. Fields when I make these.

To make my cookies even more chocolatey, I add milk and white chocolate chips. I probbaly use twice as many chips as the recipe calls for, but they taste sooo much better.

My only advice is that you should watch your cookies for the first couple of batches. If you take them out just before the edges brown to a dark golden, you are almost always guaranteed to have a soft, melt-in-your mouth, chewy center.

WOW!!! This cookie recipe is outstanding!! They actually stay chewy, and taste delicious. Not to mention they are so easy to make. This is the only chocolate chip cookie I will ever make again! By the way, I sprayed my pan with nonstick cooking spray lightly and they came off perfectly.

Although the recipe calls for an ungreased cookie sheet, I couldn't get these off of my baking sheets. They would crumble every time I tried to remove them (whether I tried immediately, after 5-10 minutes, or after 20 minutes). In addition, they were not as dark in color as I imagined. They looked more like burnt regular chocolate chip cookies than chocolate chocolate chip cookies.

Use 3 TBSP cocoa powder if you want the darkness you think you are getting with the syrup in this recipe.  I had small whole pecans so I added those.  The cookies spread quite a bit but expected that for the syrupy dough.  I used butter shortening to ensure chewy cookie. Butter is for crunchy cookies!! Pretty good recipe for ease to make but don't know about the "best ever".

These worked out great for me. I'm goingto explain exactly what i did so hopefully they will turn out for more people. i creamed unsalted butter, brown sugar which i didn't pack into the measureing cup, white sugar, and nesquick chocolate syrup. I added vanilla and the eggs and corn syrup.2 3/4 cup flour, and 1 1/2 tsp baking soda. I put them in the oven for 11 minutes and they came out delicious and not flat what so ever!! Yummy!!

One of the best cookie recipes I have tried. I added a couple of tablespoons of cocoa powder to the flour. Wow delicious cookies. The 1st batch was gone in a matter of seconds and everyone was standing at the stove waiting on more to come out! Thanks for a great recipe.

Not impressed with these cookies.  Looking at the cookies you wouldn't know that they were chocolate, they turned out a light brown in color instead of the dark chocolate color that you would expect chocolate cookies to be.  The recipe looked intriguing but save your self the time.

What a disappointment.  These were simply chocolate chip cookies with a bit of Hershey's syrup.  They weren't bad, but they were nothing to shout about.  Won't make these again.

BEWARE!  Unless you LOVE chocolate, don't even attempt this one.  I made a triple batch for work with chunks of Hersheys Dark chocolate in it, and it was deadly (delicious that is).  One of the girls I work with told me I was trying to kill her.  I actually posted a sign under it saying I was not responsible for diabetic comas.  They were too sweet, too chocolately, and too wonderful!

The BEST chocolate cookie recipe by far!! I cut up a leftover chocolate bunny that was in the freezer, and used  this for the chocolate chunks.  Never changed a thing! My family thought they were delicious! My new favorite for chocolate chip cookies!  Will definately make again .... and again :) Thank you!!!

why are these soo thin?? they melt down to nothing as soon as they get hot in the oven, which only makes it harder to remove them from the pan when they're done.  They tasted fine, but I was expecting thick chewy cookies, instead they came out paper thin and hard to handle.

Absolutely wonderul!!! I´ve had some troubles with making cookies chewy and not hard as a rock and then my friend gave me a tip. First of all, you have to have a right brown sugar which I finally found ( I´m from the Czech rep....) and then, you have to let it bake for just about ten to twelve mins so the cookies are not done yet. So I followed the recipe exactly except I did put a cocoa instead of chocolate sirup, followed the rules and it just came out perfect! I let them bake for only 10 mins, though...

These cookies were awesome! I made a few substitutions to make them more chocolatey and used white chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet. As well I didn't have chocolate syrup on hand so I used a bit more corn syrup and cocoa powder instead! They are super chewy and delicious!

These cookies have a strange texture too them and are very flat. They are chewy but have no body to them at all. Their redeeming quality is the taste-- addicting, but not the chocolate chip cookie i wanted. I used real butter, so may try these again using shortening, which tends to give a better texture to the cookies.

Well I am one of the ones that just hated this recipe.  They were runny and went flat.  Almost impossible to get off of the cookie sheet/ baking stone.  I tried putting more flour in to thicken it up, but still no decent results. Next time I'll stick to the recipe on the back of the tollhouse bag.  I know it works.

These were pretty good! I added a little more syrup then called for, because it didn't seem like enough. Anyway, they were chewy in the middle and just crispy enough around the edges. Husband already ate most of them :)

I found these cookies very good. I had also entered them in in a county fair but didn't get a ribbon, or anything. when they had came out of the oven the were a dark brown. the best part of the cookie was how they had stayed chewy. These cookies are worth it to make them because they are very good, I would recomend them for you to make, they were VERY GOOD!

I am very picky about my chocolate chip cookies, and these were absolutely delectable! I love how they are perfectly crispy around the edges and beautifully chewy throughout the rest- however cliche that sounds. I used only egg whites, and it turned out superbly. The flavor was also perfectly wondrous-- not too buttery, but not at all bland. I would definitely recommend this recipe to anyone.

I was not impressed at all, I was in belief that it was impossible to have bad chocolate chip cookies, but this has proven me wrong.  First of all they taste funny, secondly they are hard as a rock, even when cooked for less time.  I can't believe this won an county fair.  Don't waste your time on this one.

These cookies were so good! When I made them I added a bit less of the chocolate chunks and then added some chopped walnuts. It was delicious! I bake often and love to try new cookie recipes and these definately are the best I've made! I would definately recommend these cookies to everyone! I can't wait to share the recipe with my friends. Delicious!

I was VERY disappointed in this cookie recipe. I was expent something brilliant, but it really was just average, if not below average. I made these cookies for some company we had over and I didn't end up putting them out because they just didn't look good.

These were edible if you're looking for a chocolate fix, but overall not so great. They spread like crazy and came out flat, dense, and hard. The appearance wasn't good either. The dough was delicious, so I wish I wouldn't have baked these! Sorry, but I won't be making these again.

Maybe we didn't use enough four but these cookies spread out a ton and were huge and flat.  I have to say, though, they still tasted wonderful, just a bit crispy around the edges.

This recipe was reasonably good.  The batter was easy to work with and the flavour was good.  I'm not sure that it deserved the blue ribbon designation though.  I'll experiment with other cookie recipes before trying this one again.

The actual cookies are browner than pictured. I added 3T cocoa powder, baked 9 minutes in a convection oven and added 1/2 cup toasted chopped pecans.  Next time I'd increase the pecans to 1 cup, because we liked the texture and taste.  I used a 10-oz bag of Belgian dark chocolate chunks purchased at ALDI. As much as I love chocolate, next time I'd use 5 or 6 ounces.

I have made these for the teachers at our local elementary school three times. They have renamed it "Crack cookies" because they are so addictive!. I also put in 2 teaspoons of cocoa, use vanilla from haiti, dark corn syrup, and put milk and semi-sweet chips in them. With the syrup, that 4 types of chocolate! Chocopolooza in your mouth!

This may be the first recipe I tried from this site many years  ago.  It is my "go to" chocolate chip cookie.  I have baked them as written, added nuts or flavored chocolate chips (cherry or raspberry) and they come out perfect every time.  Outstanding cookie.

These cookies are fabulous!!!! They are thick and chewy without seeming to be undone and they are a supremely satisfying size. I am giving them for Christmas and think they will go over well.

The cookies were very tasty, but solid as a rock the day after they were made.  I will make the recipe again, because I think I made a mistake, and hopefully they will turn out next time.

I do a lot of cookie baking and I have to say this recipe was the worst I ever made.  They were flat and the taste was awful. I would not recommend this recipe to anyone.
