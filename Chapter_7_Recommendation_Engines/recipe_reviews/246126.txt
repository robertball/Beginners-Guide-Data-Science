Of all the things I have cooked from Allrecipes, I have never felt compelled to rate anything. This was easy easy easy, clean up was easy easy easy and most critical - My family DEVOURED it! They are not fans of Orzo - but they are converted now! Cooked as instructed. 
Thank you Chef John for the one pot recipes!! We can't wait to try another one AND we will make this again soon!

This is one of the best recipes I've found on this site! I added a cup of diced onion when I added the chicken and I did not add any additional salt. The flavors are perfect and it was super easy to make. We loved it and I'll definitely be making it again

Added half an onion and a clove of garlic when I put the chicken thighs in.  Also added fresh tomato right at the end of cook time.  I never pay much attention to exact measurements of salt/spices and I just kind of did my own thing so it was absolutely perfect and so easy!  Great basic recipe that you can tweak to include whatever you have on hand

Loved this recipe - did not have any chicken just used sausage, also used diced tomatoes instead of sauce.  Absolutely delicious! Easy one pot recipe and very adaptable to ones taste.  Also did not use extra salt as the broth was seasoning enough.  Thanks Chef John!

Excellent!  This reminded me of Spanish Paella.  So I added a hand full of frozen peas at the end.  Since we are senior citizens,  I always cut back on cayenne and crushed peppers in Chef Johns recipes, also we use the milder sausages and his recipes always turn out to our satisfaction.  Again, Thank You for another great dish.

This was a pretty easy and tasty dish - since I had bone-in thighs, I browned the chicken, which I think really helped . Will probably make it again and when I do I'll probably add some more veggies, to give it a little more life.

We love this, making for 2nd time tonight, but used regular Italian instead of Hot and added 1/2 t of red pepper flakes...so it's got a bit of heat but not too much....also, tonight didn't have tomato sauce so puréed diced tomatoes instead...just waiting for some garlic bread to go with it and trying to stay away from my pan (I use a wok for this)....easy weeknight homemade meal, thanks Chef John!

I am not generally one to review recipes but I had to say how good this one was!  I made it pretty much as shown - but I used mild Italian sausage and watched how much salt I put in. It was delicious! My 6 year old son had two helpings and my husband said it is a definite do-over! That is a WIN!

I managed to screw this one up pretty bad and accidentally added way too much chicken broth and tomato  sauce (shame on me for being in a hurry and not reading serving sizes properly!). I think I added about 5-6 cups of chicken broth an close to 2-3 cups tomato sauce. That being said, this was still delicious as a soup. So Im giving this 5 stars for being a very versatile, forgiving, and tasty recipe thats easy to make and clean up. 
PS - I do plan on making this again the right way so see which I like better.

Absolutely delicious ! I couldn't help adding  some chopped onions and garlic before the browning of the sausage. Also, I used what ever beef sausage my Halal store carries. My orzo took 5 more minutes to cook. 
This is a super easy and delicious dish, with the added bonus of only one single pan to clean.

My all time favorite recipe. I prepare this dish once/week. DO NOT add salt, the sausage makes it salty enough.

Chef John doesn't disappoint with this recipe.  It was awesome.  This is relatively quick to make.  And it has great taste.  Spinach would be a nice addition to the recipe as an optional ingredient.

My husband loved it, and I loved how easy it was, but it was way too spicy for me. I'll get mild Italian sausage next time. Overall, very good.

Good idea in theory; just way too salty as written. I think we will try again, but will use low-sodium chicken broth and leave out the salt.

The two most important things to know:  this dish is unbelievably easy, and it is delicious.

My husband and I loved this dish.  My daughter (who is nearly impossible to please) thought it was okay--practically a ringing endorsement.  She  was a bit put-off by the texture difference between the chicken and the sausage.  I only mention this, because I know that there are plenty of kids out there with "texture sensitivities".  

FYI - I used 16 oz of spicy Italian sausage because that's the size that was available.   Also, I only used .75lb of chicken thigh because that's the package size I bought.  My adjustments in the sausage:chicken ratio may have contributed to the degree of saltiness of this dish.  Even so, I will reduce the amount of added salt the next time I make this.

Although you could omit the ricotta, you shouldn't.  This addition smooths out (?) the saltiness and richness of the rest of the dish.  It makes a very good dish into a great dish.

I was very disappointed and let down with this dish! It felt like a jambalaya minus all the flavor! I used turkey breakfast sausage instead, and browned it in my cast iron skillet...and that was the star of the dish. The ricotta seemed like a weird after thought. I feel like this could be decent with a lot more flavor.

I probably just needed a much easier recipe.  Mine came out super bland and took 1 hour 40 minutes to make, not 30 minutes.  Pretty frustrated and discouraged.  Hope it turns out better for everyone else.

So good!  Used chorizo instead of italian sausage for a little kick, but I used low-sodium everything else so I didn't get a really salty result.  It's perfect as it is but I can see how garlic and tomatoes would make another fabulous-tasting meal!

So easy and everyone loves it. Don't add the second tsp of salt. I like that its made in one pot. Be sure to stir it often as the orzo will stick to the bottom.

this is an incredible, easy, delicious meal. adding a few handfuls of spinach at the end doesn't hurt either! if i don't have chicken, i've doubled the sausage and it still turns out great. i've also used leftover roasted chicken instead of the raw chicken if i have it. really, really filling and delicious.

I loved this easy one pot meal & so did my picky 9 year old! My youngest son & I made this together tonight. We used boneless skinless chicken thighs & followed the video/ recipe. The chicken was moist and delicious. Overall an incredibly flavorful fish. I did steam some fresh broccoli & warmed up a baguette to serve this to the family. This has been added to our, make again recipes!! Thank you!!!

This was a simple dish and everyone in the family loved it. I added sweet onion and a bell pepper while the meat was cooking. I didn’t add the recommended salt, personal preference for me. I used mild italian sausage since the kids would be eating it, but I sprinkled a small amount of red pepper flakes to help substitute. I ended up using 4 cups of broth instead of the recommended 3. It was not watered down at all. I skipped the ricotta since I am not a big fan of it. This will be added to the list of meals we frequently make.

Was looking for a really simple weeknight dinner and this one is definitely a winner. All three of my children loved it. My picky 4 year old ended up taking the serving spoon and eating the last bits straight out of the pan because she couldn’t get enough.

Wow, my husband helped himself to more.  I didn’t have half the ingredients but I did have some beer brats I bought by accident and a couple of skinless boneless chicken breasts.  Flavor was great.  I also threw in some cauliflower.

I love this. I add extra chicken and a lot more sausage because we like more protein with our pasta. This is a great recipe.

John you are my hero, I've made a bunch of your recipes before, but this one is my new favorite.

The ricotta is an absolute must, it makes the meal much creamier.

Pan seared the chicken breasts for 3 minutes a side before adding them to the recipe, as Chef John suggests in the video. I doubled the recipe to make sure I had lots of leftovers!! It was awesome! Everyone enjoyed it immensely. Ricotta cheese, which was optional, makes a lovely touch when serving.

Very good restaurant style pasta dish.  But WAY too salty, and I didnt add all the salt and used low sodium chicken broth. So just be careful with the amount you add up front. Taste dish overall.

This was absolutely delicious! It tasted so fresh and the flavors blended perfectly. I followed the directions to the letter, with the exception of eyeballing the amount of herbs. So glad I resisted the temptation to add garlic. It just wasn’t needed. And such easy breezy prep. Thanks for a new favorite!

I didn't have any orzo so I used couscous. I also added chopped green onions (white part) and garlic while browning the meat, then the green parts of the onions when I added in the cheese. It was a big hit!

I am giving it 5 because it is an excellent roadmap. When I have all the ingredients I will make it exactly as written. I used 8oz. sausage, 2 cups vegetable broth, I can diced tomatoes, I tsp Jane's seasoning, 1 tsp fresh garlic and 1/4 cup onion (which I sauted with the sausage).  No chives, no parsely and no ricotta.  After adding the orzo It cooked in 11 minutes. Dished it out with fresh grated parmesan. It was delicious. So easy and one pan. Yay.  Based on this success I will  take up the one-pan gauntlet and make them all. LOL!

I love to food prep for the week and this is a winner everytime. I stick to the recipe with sometimes making it with the sausage and sometimes without. I also like to add grape tomatoes to mine. Great meal and filling.

Excellent!  I did make a few minor adjustments (using gluten free orzo and less salt), but followed instructions otherwise.  Simple, homey, and delicious on a chilly, dreary night!  Even my pickiest child enjoyed this.

This turned out amazing.  It was super easy to make.  I used common Parmesan and used a little extra chicken broth because I know we like a little juicier meal.  The extra cup of chicken broth came in very handy.  Super awesome.  Might add some onion next time.

Quick and simple.  I was good. However,  1 tsp. of salt  is listed 2 times in the recipe.  I figured it was an error and it was.  I put in 1 tsp. salt and the recipe was very salty to me.  Add salt to taste a little at a time.

Loved this recipe. Like others, I added half a medium sized onion and a garlic clove. I left the rest of the recipe unchanged. Turned out great; definitely one of my favorite Chef John recipes.

A really good and EASY recipe that didn't destroy my kitchen.  I added some extra crushed red pepper to spice it up and it made for a delicious meal.  I've never used orzo before, and I really liked it.  Lot's of possible recipe uses that I can think of.  Thanks, Chef John.  Another great recipe.

Really good. I used chicken breasts. Seared them first, removed and added towards the end so it wouldn't dry out. Added more cheese. The whole family loved it! Will make again!

Didn't use any salt. Added garlic and used diced tomatoes instead of tomato paste. Didn't have orozo so used rice that I cooked separately. The hot sausage really carries the dish.

I added onion and garlic in with the sausage because I tend to add it to everything. This dish was extremely fast, which was my favorite thing about it. Relatively low mess and easy clean up always wins an extra star with me. Personally I felt there was a little too much liquid, but I’m not sure I added quite enough chicken so that could be my fault. I skimmed extra fat/liquid off the top. It did end up creamy especially with the ricotta! Ended up tasting delicious and simple but feel it’s missing “something”.... this would be a really good base dish to add things to.

Just made this for dinner tonight. Followed the recipe exactly. First words out of hubby's mouth were, "Mmmmmm. Very good."  Then came, "This can go into the regular rotation.  Thanks for a great recipe Chef John.

This is delicious as written. I’ve made several times and found it to be a good opportunity for substitutions with the meat. Can add shrimp and chicken, or just sausage with artichoke hearts or whatever you desire. The base is there and is super tasty.

Ok so I made this -with few changes-not because I didnt think the dish would not be tasty as it was directed in the recipe, but it was more of adjustments to our family liking and what I had on hand. I think this is a great and easy recipe for midweek dinners, no matter what you put in it :). I cooked the orzo separately from the meat-I cooked in a separate pot ground beef and added a dash of taco seasoning....I had some left over pasta sauce from the other day and half a can of cut tomatoes which I mix with the meat once was brown and finished cooking... I then mixed the orzo together with my meat mixture-added some cilantro and chives, as well shredded Parmesan cheese to top if off :).  I think this is a great versatile recipe .

It was fantastic. My girlfriend loved it! She even got seconds. I did add onion and bell peppers for veggies but next time I think I might add spinach and mushrooms just for the flavor. It was delicious and I’m looking forward to making it again!

My family loves this recipe. I do add extra chicken broth and do not add any salt. There is enough in the chicken broth. I have made it with just chicken and that is good also. Love one pot meals!

Very tasty, easy to change up with other ingredients. I used chicken sausage. I would think making it with vege chorizo would be good too.

Easy comfort food. I added more broth as John suggested and let it absorb into the mix.  And I added a little more tomato sauce cuz I had it. The sausage shines right though, and give it a hearty flavoring. I doubled the batch and brought it to a Halloween potluck. It was a hit. I will make again for my family. :)

I used Sprouts Hot Italian Pork sausage.  No other changes.  So easy to make.  And it could be easier to make if you use bulk sausage which would eliminate the step of removing the sausage casings.  Also quick to make.

Made for a small dinner party and it was a HIT!!  
Changes:
Used more sausage and more chicken than recipe
Used 1 fresh tomato instead of 1/2 cup sauce
Used 2 cups orzo
Diced 2 cloves garlic, 1 medium onion and 1 yellow bell pepper and sautéed (after cooking sausage and chicken and removing to bowl to add back later)
Cut about 3T of chives and 3T of parsley and mixed with about 8 oz. ricotta cheese and let sit in fridge and "blend" for a few hours prior to party

I changed the initial cook time for the chicken because 1 minute didn't seem long enough to make me comfortable (I upped it to 4 minutes), also I used 3/4 cup pasta sauce to thicken it a bit more and added a fair amount of garlic powder because garlic is awesome.  Lactose intolerant people should take 1 Lactaid pill before eating this.

I made it tonight, did not make no changes. My husband had two bowls. We loved this recipe, my husband did say next time you make this dish again use all sausage, or all chicken. 
Chef John you did it again. I have been following you with all your new recipes. 

Thank you, keep on posting  your fabulous recipes.

Like the recipe as is, but doubled - added an onion and bell pepper at the same time as the chicken and some garlic as the onions started to soften (almost added celery but that's my Louisiana coming out).  Loved it with some shrimp scampi potstickers for which I found a recipe floating around.  Going to be an italian night staple.  Couldn't decide if it needed a veg on the side though.  Definitely yes on the ricotta.  
  
Added 1 tsp red pepper to the doubled recipe, but I love spicy food.  Also, to the doubled recipe 3 cups of rice came out well.  It makes the components 1 box of chicken broth, 1 can of tomato sauce, 2/3rds of a sellable portion of green onion (i scale to make sellable portions completely used and use the cheapest ones as variance), 1 onion, 1 bell pepper, 5 teeth of garlic (frozen the smashed and chopped makes them split nicely), one flat of spicy italian sausage, and one flat of chicken thigh filets.  it gets the ricotta mostly used if you buy the small container.

It's amazing, simple, my kids love it!  Selfish!!  I add a little minced garlic & red pepper flakes while browning meat.  We leave out the chicken just for simplicity's sake.  Parsley, is unnecessary.  Ricotta & green onions add a lot, but if you don't have those - it's still great.

I love Chef John's recipes and he did not disappoint with this one either! I made it exactly as instructed using the chicken thigh. So quick and easy and full of flavor. I don't think that it necessarily needed the ricotta though.

Made this tonight. Cooked some onion and garlic before adding the sausage. But everything else was per recipe (but no ricotta, one son and hubby not fans!) Otherwise it was delicious and everyone enjoyed it. Served with green beans and hot bread and butter on the side. Husband said the texture of the chicken thighs was similar to shrimp (which he loves but has an allergy to now) and want to try the method in a different recipe. Thanks Chef John!

This was really good and super easy!  My husband devoured it.  I added onion and garlic, as another reviewer recommended.  I also just went ahead and used the whole can of tomato sauce (8 oz. i think. whatever the small can is).  Seemed silly to only use 1/2 the can.

Made again last night.  Same great results!  Just wanted to add that I followed Chef John's recommendation to brown the chicken breasts first.  Then I added it back in about 1/2 way through the cooking time of the orzo to prevent them from drying out.  Yum!!

The whole family (kids included) loved this! I don't prefer the taste of fennel so next time I make it I will buy plain ground pork or breakfast sausage but it was still delicious!

Followed the instructions exactly and this was better than I thought it would be. Everyone really liked it but I will definitely  cut the salt in half or just salt to taste towards the end because it was  pretty salty for everyone. 
And for being a one pot recipe, I somehow ended up with a lot to wash. But was worth it.

Was a delicious dish. Even the pickiest eater loved it and it was fast and easy to make. I added some minced garlic and didn't have any tomato sauce on hand so I used about 3/4 cup marinara and it was great!

This is a very simple and very flavorful dish.  The only change I made was adding mozzarella for the cheese topping,  instead of the ricotta.  Delicious, with the perfect spice from the Italian sausage.  Will now go in the the dinner rotation!

I made this and thought it was good.  The adults liked it, kids not so much.  It took about an hour to get it finished - took a bunch of time to cut up all the chicken.  It was great that it was all in one pan too.  I also bought sweet italian dausage instead of spicy because people in my household are not lovers of hot spicy foods.  Besides that, I followed the recipe.  I am not sure if I will make it again.

My very picky 16 year old boys said this recipe is "amazing," and I agree! I added onion and garlic in the beginning saute as other reviewers suggested and also added a can of diced tomato as someone else mentioned. I was trying to use the excess sausage patties left over from a work event so I cut them up into bite size pieces and added a little bit of Ghost pepper seasoning from Trader Joe's. I also used one large Costco chicken breast instead of thighs. I did not add any salt. This really is a great, versatile, no fail recipe!

I didn't have enough orzo so I substituted small pieces of spaghetti (1/4 C)
We really liked the flavor but instead of ricotta I used sour cream.
Using 10 oz of anything is harder than using a pound or 8 oz so next time I'll use the full pound of sausage.
Loved the recipe and will use it again.

We didn't care for the chicken in this dish.  Thought it conflicted with the flavors.  Orzo was good though.  If I make it again I will omit the chicken and use mild spicy sausage.

Not over the top fantastic but a decent meal.  And for all the reviews that said it's too salty, the recipe clearly says a tsp OR to taste.  Maybe not dump a tsp in to start with.

Absolutely delicious dinner! Thank you for the recipe. I made it exactly as listed, it turned out picture perfect & so tasty, lots of flavor. It was quite rich though and we could only eat small portions. The ricotta made it special, don't leave it out. Served it with big green salads with lots of chopped vegetables for a fresh side dish, & buttered dinner rolls.

Added some sautéed onions and garlic at the beginning. The recipe was easy to follow and my family loved it.

Delicious as is, and also works well with kale added. I roughly chopped a large head of kale, steamed it separately and added at the very end when the heat was off.

This is one of my favorite recipes on this site however I found it doesn't need the additional salt.

I made just two servings of this recipe, and cut back on some of the ingredients to cut calories and carbs.  I used just one link (maybe 3-4 oz.) of hot Italian turkey sausage, and just one 5 oz. boneless, skinless chicken breast.  I first browned the sausage and chicken, adding a few shakes of red pepper flakes, and removed them from the pan.  I then proceeded with the liquids to deglaze the pan and since I was cutting the orzo to 1/2 cup, I also scaled back proportionately on the chicken broth and initially used one cup.  However the orzo took longer than indicated, so I ended up adding more broth until the pasta was done, probably another 1/2 cup.  When the orzo was done I added back the sausage and chicken and added  the other ingredients as indicated.  I made this ahead of time and re-heated it in the microwave just before dinner, which worked out quite well.  I didn’t have ricotta cheese, so I garnished this with a dollop of sour cream.  The flavor of this was very good and Hubs and I both enjoyed it.  I’ll make this one again!  I can also see subbing pasta sauce for the tomato sauce if necessary.

We really liked this! I used Italian Sweet Sausage and substituted a can of diced tomatoes for the tomato sauce. I didn't have chives, so I subbed sliced scallions. It didn't say whether to cover this at the end but I do when I cook orzo as I would cook rice. However, it is a MUST to stir this, as it mentions,  every 7-8 minutes and for that reason, it took about 20 minutes to finish. Froze the other half for the future.

This was definitely not hideous!

In fact I've eaten it for three days in a row now.

This was excellent! My only criticism was that it was too salty. I added 2 teaspoons of sugar to cut the salt but I usually add some sugar to all my dishes with tomato. I also topped with minced basil and used  2 tablespoons of minced onion because I didn't have any chives.  My husband loved it.

Loved it.  Next time, I will add another sausage I think.  I'm a big fan of one pot dishes!

This was fantastic!  I used chicken breast as Chef John does in the video.  I browned the chicken first and reserved it to avoid over cooking.  I added it back in when the orzo was almost finished cooking so it could absorb some of the sauce and be heated through.    At my wife's suggestion, I'm going to swap baby spinach for the parsley next time.
