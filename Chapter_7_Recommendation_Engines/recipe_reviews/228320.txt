10-18-2015  ~After traveling for weeks I missed cooking, but more than that, I craved a good, home-cooked meal.  Tonight’s dinner, with this entrée, exceeded my hopes and my expectations.  What an incredible dish, very similar to one I had recently in Rome, Italy.  Everything about this recipe is spot on, from the ingredients list to the cooking method, to the timing.  I followed it nearly identical to the recipe, only using olive oil for the vegetable oil and omitting the basil.  After years and years of trying to convince myself otherwise, I’ve finally accepted and embraced the fact that I just don’t like it.  I didn’t have fresh red chile pepper, but a pinch of red pepper flakes worked in its place.  The fish and shrimp were tender, sweet and mild, and the fresh tomato sauce was perfect with it.  I served this with Crazy Delicious Linguine with Peas and Bacon, also from this site, but a simple pasta with garlic and olive oil would have been equally as good.  Kudos to the submitter of this recipe – nicely done.

Great recipe!   Not difficult to make, very healthy, and everyone loved it!  I used a 14-oz can of diced tomatoes, left out the prawns, added some green olives, and used a pound of fish, which made four servings.   Grilled veggies with some balsamic vinegar were the perfect side dish.  Crusty dinner rolls were great for sopping up the yummy pan juices.  Would make a great dinner party dish.

This is a great recipe. I've made it for a number of people and everybody loves it.  The only change I made was I used canned stewed tomatoes instead of cooking fresh tomatoes.

This is a great recipe as is... I have made this probably 10 times and I make it with less liquid in the pan... and simpler steps.  I saute the onions and garlic, then I add only 3 chopped fresh tomatoes with skin on and let them get tender, then add only 1/2 cup of wine or chicken broth... I also use one pound of Cod..  There is plenty of mixture for the fish... and the fillets don't fall apart with less liquid.. Thank you for sharing. Update...  The prawn or shrimp do not make much difference in this recipe... I prefer it without.

Made this tonight for a husband who doesn't like fish, and even he enjoyed the cod! I didn't have prawns and just made it as the recipe called for, though next time I'll use olive oil instead of vegetable. Also, I substituted a couple dashes of red cayenne for the red chili pepper, so it still had a kid. Excellent & will make this again.

I love dishes like this! Many times I've made a similar one from this site, Fish Fillets Italiano. I tried this with the fresh tomatoes. It was OK, but I believe the success of this dish depends on the quality of your tomatoes. As other reviewers mentioned here, they used stewed tomatoes. Those would be better than some of the store-bought fresh stuff, so why not? In my case, this would have turned out a little better if I used stewed or canned petite tomatoes. I also used olive oil and skipped the prawns/shrimp. I did add (like the other dish and personal preference) some chopped green and kalamata olives (so you go easy on adding additional salt). The cod came out so delicious and flaky, cooked for the short time mentioned. To me, this is a real Mediterranean-type dish. It's a healthy dish and so good, especially with a glass of wine!

Tried many different recipes for Cod, this is certainly one of the better ones! The prep work of onions, garlic, tomato and wine are not too hard or difficult, but when added to the cod... WOW! My Wife who is not a big  fish fan went for seconds! Usually I have left overs for next day lunch, I will have a PBJ as this was devoured, all gone!

Okay, I left out the prawns, but that sauce is a universal. My wife and I are coming up with a lot of alternatives like just prawns, or prawns and red potatoes.  Oh, and we served it over rice - a must do!!

I don’t know what happened. The sauce just didn’t taste very good and the consistency was perhaps too liquidy. My husband and I both agreed that something just didn’t go right. Idk if it was the recipe or just me.

This was fantastic good for any white fish, I did not have a red hot pepper so used jalapeño which added a nice kick also just used ground parsley when everybody in the house eats it and wants more it's worth 5 stars lol

Delicious and so very easy.My modifications: 
* small canned diced tomatoes * 1/2 c + Pinot Gris * 2 cloves garlic * pinch of red pepper flakes
Was spiced perfectly. Just slightly hot.
Update: red wine isn't nearly as good in this recipe

Great dish. I made this without the red chili pepper. I used a small amount of red pepper flakes instead. I will definitely cook this again.

I didn't have any prawns on hand, even without, a very nice blend of flavors. I sub'd olive oil for the vegetable oil.

Amazing. Fantastic. What more can I say? I didn’t have any fresh basil...I can only imagine what it’d be like! Light, fresh...probably the only way I’m going to eat mild white fish from now on.

I used my own home grown basil and that made it all the better. I shorten the kitchen time by using fire roasted chopped tomatoes.

Amazing and delicious! I only had cod so didn’t use the prawns. I didn’t have white wine so I used red. I didn’t have fresh parsley or basil so I used dried. It was still FANTASTIC! I made some spaghetti with olive oil and parmesan cheese and topped it off with the cod and sauce. OMG. I can’t wait to make it again with white wine, prawns and fresh herbs. But for what I had on hand it was still a 10 out of 10. Thanks for the delicious recipe!

WAY too liquid and bland. Next time I’ll skip the fresh tomatoes, use a 14 oz. tin of good  tomatoes instead, reduce the wine to half a cup, add more garlic.

This was so good. Replaced the fresh tomatoes with canned in order to save some time. Also used a good dash of crushed red pepper. Otherwise, followed the rest of the recipe. Will definitely make again.

This dish is great. My family loved it. I substituted red pepper flakes for the pepper to lower the heat and it turned out well.

Excellent--used diced tomatoes, cayenne pepper and threw in some capers.Forgot the prawns but was still great. Next time I will make rice or some noodles to go with it.  Will make again.

I made a much simpler version, but it was delicious and easy!  I seasoned the fish with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  I warmed marinara sauce in a pan and added the cod, topped it with parsley, basil, and capers. Cooked covered 5 min each side as directed.

Very good! Flavorful, easy & versatile. I did add capers in the final minutes of cooking to add a tang.

I didn't have the chili peppers so I used red pepper flakes.  And I had cherry tomatoes so I just threw them in and cooked them.  I used one little carton but next time I'll use two.  I also added more shrimp than called for.  This was wonderfully delicious.

This was great! I was cooking for one person. I had one cod loin, I only had two fresh tomatoes, I used red peppper flakes as someone else suggested. I also threw in a couple of sliced kalamata olives. I reduced the amount of onion and garlic, wine, and number of prawns to try to balance the ingredient amounts. this came together easily and I will definitely make this again and again!

As a non-fan of seafood, I couldn't imagine this dish tasting that good. But, I had the fish & my husband will eat anything. The entire time I was cooking I thought eww, gross. Served over whole wheat angel hair (grateful I had frozen pizza in the freezer bc I just knew this would suck!) O.M.G! It was just fantastic!                                                                                                                                          This recipe has made it to my rotation & we've had it many times. The juice is so sweet and good! It thickens slightly so now I serve over a piece of garlic bread & salad. Mmmmm!

I have made a variation of this recipe for several years using canned tomatoes. Using the fresh tomatoes bumped it up a notch. Used a bit of crushed red pepper. Added sliced black olives.

Great recipe! I substituted the vegetable oil for olive oil and didn't add prawns. Easy for first-time fish makers.

I've been a member of all recipe's for perhaps 3 years now and this is the first recipe that has moved me to post. I made it according to recipe and absolutely loved it! I served it over a bed of wheat tortellini and a little of the chardonnay I used in the recipie on the side.
