Awesome video and no problem on the starter. On the 10th day said starter rose over double. I used bread flour and whole  wheat flour and tap water. I baked a small loaf that was sooo good. 

My only question is how to store it. Once a day feeding if left refrigerated and once a week feeding if left unrefrigerated. What is proper technique for both?

I did all this and my sourdough starter is a champ. Named him Lievito Corleone.  Unlike some of the drier starters, this takes on a really lovely lactic/acetic balance that makes a subtly sour bread. Or maybe it's just the bacteria in my house (?). It took 10 days to be ready to bake - went through a very acetic acid period for about the next 4 days. I switched his feedings to a white whole wheat and he's happy as a bubbly clam. Thank you!

My start is about 4 months old now.  It takes a bit of watching and getting the hang of the timing but once you do, this makes some amazing bread.  The flavor is unique and changes with the timing of the rise (longer rise = more sour).  I use this in Chef John's no-knead artisan in place of the commercial yeast (remove yeast, add 75g start, stir the start into the warm water before adding to the flour) and it is delicious.  

For feeding, i use 50g/50g flour/water (this is 1/3 cup with my flour and sifting method).  Keeping a living start 24/7 eats through some flour.  

PS.  I named mine Ichibod Grain.  oh yes, i did.  enjoy that.

Today I have to make new starter because I messed up my initial one by adding BREAD MAKING ingredients to it.  YIKES.  This recipe is spot on.  I  used it to make so many loves of bread that I didn't even bother to count.  So easy, just takes some time.  I know I'll have no problem making new starter.  Breadmaking, here I come in 10 or less days.  :)  A French exchange student stays in the home for the school year.  She finds this bread IRRESISTIBLE!  She said it taste like home.

This starter was easy and created a great bread! My only issue (user error most likely) was that by day 6 or 7, removing 140 was basically all of the starter. Luckily I used it that night for bread but I basically had to remake it from scratch since 100 grams was almost all of my starter. Not sure what I did wrong here. Otherwise, easy and smelled great!

So far so good.  I made bread on day 9 and refrigerated the rest of the starter.  Prepping to make  bread again in 2 days, so the starter is out of the refrig and will feed it for 2 days again.

My little pet is doing really well. Haven't named it yet. Very excited to make  sourdough for my family. Thanks for the straightforward recipe/tutorial. I came across many on the internet but it's great to see one that's accessible to even the beginner bread maker.

This is very easy to make, yet unfortunately wastes all the good flour (since you have to toss 1/2 every day). Yes, I used some of it to make bread on day 3 and 5, yet you still have waste, but that's just the way it is. I'll have to see how it holds up in my fridge over a longer period of time.

I quit buying bread and bake all my own. I wanted a starter that was developed naturally, not started with yeast. I have two, one with bread flour and one with wheat and rye. Both are just what I wanted. Chef John has provided many techniques that I use daily in my kitchen.

Mine turned out really good. When it came to discarding I would often put it in another bowl and continue feeding both. I ended up having three starters going at once. It was good as I did have one of the starters not do so well and one did go bad but having two or three on the go just meant I didn’t have to restart. Worked really well. I also found feeding roughly at the same time every day worked well. I’ve experimented with other starter recipes and attempts. Also don’t forget it in the fridge. Sounds easy enough but when you’re time poor it’s easy to do. Set a reminder if you have to.

Love this starter, great directions!  Just one thing, mine never doubled in the 10 days.
