This was delicious! I made it almost as-is, except I added some mushrooms that I needed to use up, and added more garlic. Even my husband liked it, and he is not a big fan of vegetables. The leftovers were even tastier the next day. Will definitely make again!

I used this recipe for a foundation to build upon, which is my "MO". I cook using ingredients I love, and that I have on hand, melded into a base recipe searched by the basic ingredients I I want to use. This is perfect for that. I used the leftover sauce to top pasta the following night.

My family loved it! We omitted the olives and tried it once with asparagus and once with diced yellow squash. Was super good both ways. We also sprinkled the feta on after it was served. Just a personal preference :) 
 Definitely plan to make this part of our monthly meals.

This is a promising recipe - we LOVE the ingredients.  We found it to be a little bland though.  I think the next time I make it I will make more of the sauce and add more asparagus.  It also needs some kind of herb - oregano maybe.  Sounds like I'm complaining, but I'm not.  It really is a good recipe. We'll be making it again!  Thanks so much for sharing...

I loved this. I'm doing low calorie so I didn't put the olives or  cheese in it and it was still yummy.

Liked the sound of this, but did not have all the ingredients, so used a can of regular diced tomatoes and a jar of roasted red peppers instead of the two cans of roasted red tomatoes and used a cup of green beans instead of asparagus.  Based on another reviewer who said it needed an herb, I added a tablespoon of chopped basil.  It was delicious & everyone liked it - even two picky teenagers.  Will definitely make it again.
