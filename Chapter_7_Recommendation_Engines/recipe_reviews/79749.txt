I tried this recipe and it has a very good flavor, DIDN'T fall apart and makes excellent sandwiches... This is the one that I've been looking for, for a long time.

I slightly modified this recipe, and created a 5 star winner! I sauteed the chopped veggies, then quickly pulsed them in the food processor before mixing with other ingredients. Also, cut the sausage to 1/2 lb, only added 1 cup of milk, 1 cup bread crumbs and ommited the catchup. I am not a big meat loaf fan, but this actually changed my mind. It stayed together, and was awesome!

This is an excellent recipe. I use Ritz or Townhouse original flavor crackers. Here's a nice little tip for the anti-grease crowd. Line the bottom of your loaf pan with bread. (Two pieces usually does it) Place the meatloaf on top and cook per recipe. The bread soaks up the grease and peels off easily, leaving a beautifully moist yet grease free meatloaf! Bon Appetite!

Soooooo... I was looking for a meatloaf recipe that would be as "generic" as possible. My husband was craving it and I had never made it. I am Peruvian and my husband is Bahamian and in Peru we do not make meatloaf as part of our day to day menu. Anyway... I picked this recipe as the ingredients sounded like a generic meatloaf, but I made a few changes: I did not have the onion soup so did not put it in, I replaced it by 1/4 cup of men-si (tau-si) sauce (you can find it in Asian foodstores). I added 2 eggs and cut the milk in half. We do not have mild pork sausages here in Peru so I replaced it by Argentinian chorizos. I did not cover it with ketchup before baking it. I left the rest just as it said on the recipe and it turned out delicious. My husband said it was the best meatloaf he has ever tried!

I realize I'm in the minority here. The only thing I left out was the green pepper, however I substituted a couple carrots. The pan FILLED with grease which I had to drain out, and then I waited 5 minutes to cut the loaf and it completely crumbled. Maybe I did something wrong but this definately did not work out for me, and due to the  overpowering flavor of the sausage, I am not going to try it again.

I've only made meatloaf a couple of times many years ago based off a recipe of my grandmother's. I didn't keep the recipe and she has since passed. This came the closest to her recipe that I found. It turned out great and stayed moist and together. I had to alter it to feed 8 picky people however. I used 3 lbs of beef with 1 lb of ground pork sausage. Some weren't fans of onions, so I replaced the raw onions with about 8 baby portabella mushrooms. I also used red and green bell peppers. I mixed some butter crackers with salted crackers. To help with the size, I kept the milk the same but added 2 eggs. I still used just one dry onion soup mix. I waited to add the ketchup until the last 20 minutes. I didn't have sage so I just left it out. I ended up using 2 loaf pans. My husband was in love. He ate it hot on day 1 and ate cold meatloaf sandwiches on day 2. Everyone else ate it, even my 2 year old nephew. I served it with green bean casserole, cheddar and bacon baked potato halves and baked rolls. It was surprisingly quick to prepare and I was ecstatic with the result.

i'll start by saying i have a favorite meatloaf recipe but was out of eggs, so i found this one as an alternative. i used only ground turkey for the meat, but kept the rest of the recipe the same, minus the green peppers.  although i still prefer my original, this helped me out greatly today when i realized i had used the last egg and we had our hearts set on meatloaf.  good flavor from the soup mix, i really enjoyed that.  thanks!!

Me and my husband absolutely loved this recipe! This was my second attempt at making meatloaf and it was a success!! I think the only thing i did different was that i grated the onion, bell pepper, and celery. I dont have a food processor, and i dont like to bite into the pieces of vegetables, so i grated them instead. I also used just ground beef, and i think i made more than 2 pounds because it didnt fit in my loaf pan. Luckily i had a larger aluminum one that it fit perfect in. I also had to increase cooking time because mine wasnt done in 1 1/2 hours. This recipe is definately a keeper!

This meatloaf was OUTSTANGING.  LOVED the flavor.  I think the Bell Pepper and celery really added to the exceptional flavor and consistency.  I won't go searching for other meatloaf recipes, this one is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.  GREAT recipe!

I loved this recipe! I didn't have green peppers and I didn't use ketchup, but It was a great savory meatloaf. I was suprised how well it held up without the egg but it sliced beautifly. and the veggies keep it moist and flavorful.

No meatloaf needs eggs to not crumble... i dont know why people waste eggs in meatloaf... Best Meatloaf is easiest... 1 1/2 - 2 pounds lean ground beef, cup of crumbs, diced onion (videllia) diced fresh garlic, teaspoon or oregano, 1/4 teasp thyme. 2 tsp black pepper. let the crumb mix sit together over night to share flavours and moisture. mix together with the beef. mix a can of tomatoe soup with 3 tablesppon of sugar, and pout over it, heat at 350 for 1- 1 1/2 hrs depending on how browned you want it. ENJOY

Um, can you say yummy!!!???  We loved this recipe, even my 5 year old ate it, and believe me that is no easy task!  I didn't add bell peppers because we just don't really like them.  Everything else was followed exactly- it did not fall apart AT ALL!!!

This meatloaf was really moist and was delicious, however next time I will add a bit more spices to it.  Believe me, it was all devoured in the end either way!

Not quite as spicy as I'd like - which really surprised me with the soup mix - but great meatloaf non the less.  Will probably tweak the spices a bit next time - but there are many next times to come!  THANKS!

Made this tonight for my husband and I.  I was a little nervous with the amount of milk, but it absorbed into the crackers.  A fabulous meatloaf.  We will be making this again.  FYI - it makes two loaves.

This is a good basic meatloaf.  I used Hot Pork Sausage and it provided a slight kick.  It comes together very quickly and easily using a food processor for the vegetables and the stand mixer to blend all the ingredients.  I'm looking forward to the sandwiches tomorrow.

This meatloaf was tasty, but not a traditional meatloaf by any means because of the sausage, which somewhat dominates the flavor.  It was yummy, just not what I expected.

The recipe is nothing special.  It did give me incentive to experiment with meatloaf and see if I can improve on the flavors, cut the fat and increase the nutritional impact.

Excellent meatloaf!  I have made this several times and it is a huge hit with everyone.  I use bread crumbs instead of cracker crumbs and leave out the celery and it is still great!

This is the best meatloaf I have ever made. I did not add the sage, I did add 3 carrots just chopped all the veggies in a chopper. There is just enough meatloaf to make 4 mini loaves in the Pampered Chef loaf pan. I will use more ketchup on the top next time. I will make this a regular in meal planning.

Okay, mine fell apart, does that mean I messed up?  

It stayed together just fine cold on sandwiches, but hot out of the dish it crumbled. The flavor was delicious though; I'll make it again.  Also, this recipe produced a lot of meatloaf.  It tested the limits of my loaf pan.  I think my onion and bell pepper may have been too big.  Watch out for this when shopping for your veggies for this recipe.

Excellent recipe.  I didn't use the bell pepper because my husband doesn't like it, and I'm not a fan of pork sausage, so I used ground veal instead.  Also, I'm lactose intolerant, so I used 2 eggs and 1 cup of tomato sauce/ketchup instead and it turned out great.  Not sure how this would fit in a loaf pan... I had a lot of meat and used a much bigger dish.  Nonetheless, it turned out fantastic.

This recipe is very close to the meatloaf recipe my mom makes with just a few exceptions; fresh onion in place of dry onion soup mix and omit the sage. I also swirl ketchup on the top and remove foil for last 10 minutes to allow it to brown. If you let it cool for 10 minutes before slicing, it will cut nicely without falling apart. It's very moist and a little crisp on bottom, but not burnt. For tasty meatloaf sandwiches (next day), try making  a can of condensed tomato soup with just half a can of milk and pour it over the reheated meatloaf until warm and bubbly. Place between two slices of bread and VOILA! meatloaf sandwiches...YUMMMMM very tasty!

Really good meat loaf; one of the best recipes I have tried.  The sausage gives it a great flavor.  The only thing I did differently was adding fresh garlic and some cajun seasoning.  Makes fabulous meat loaf sandwiches; worth making an extra loaf on Friday night to have sandwiches for the weekend!

This recipe was wonderful!  I made it as stated, but I did add a half cup of carrots to the other veggies in the food processer. The carrots added nice coloring.  Everyone loved it & it will be a favorite from now on.

I absolutely love this recipe! I only have plain bread crumbs so I guess I haven't technically "tried" this recipe...however, this meatloaf does.not.crumble and the seasoning is perfect! I also put sliced bread on the bottom of the loaf pan to help absorb the grease. This is the only meatloaf recipe that I've found to love and use it over and over. Thanks for sharing!

This is really tasty.  I was a little doubtful of the celery and green peppers but it works.  Since this recipe makes so much, I usually get at least 4 meals for 2 out of it.  I buy the mini loaf tins at a dollar store and divide the recipe evenly between them.  I usually get 8 tins out of one batch.  They freeze great and are so nice to have on hand.

We really liked this when it was hot.  It didn't fall apart but was nice and juicy but there are other recipes that I like better cold.  Grilling the slices made a decent sandwich though!

True to its name it did not crumble.  Great flavor, the only change that I made was to omit the salt.  Will definitely add to my recipe rotation! Thanks!

I have made this recipe three times now.  The four star rating is for the ingredients and methods in the original.  However I now make it a bit differently.  I do not use bell peppers and celery.   I increase the onion to make up for the difference.  I cook up a 1/4 lb of bacon and saute the onion and some garlic in the drippings.  I add the bacon to the mix as well.  I then put two slices of bread in the bottom of the loaf pan and press in the mix, making sure to get out all voids.  My loaf pans are glass so this helps a bit.  I cook until internal temp of 160 is reached, shut the oven off and let it cool down a bit. The meat loaf slices up real nice.  I use 90/10 ground beef an good quality mild breakfast sausage.  Has become a favorite in our house.

After I made this meatloaf recipe, my family said they didn't want any other meatloaf. Therefore, it is the only meatloaf recipe I now use.

Thank you for this recipe.  I have been looking for a meatloaf recipe that I would serve anyone esp. children.  My recipe that I made all the time my kids were at home just has not had the right texture for years.  Maybe becauce of the pink slime added to the meat during those years.  Because of low cholesterol diet, I used a lean beef roast that I had Brookshires cut off any big pieces of fat and grind for me and also with the pork sausage I dumped the fat off right away.  Because of low-sodium diet I left out the 1/4 tsp of salt in this recipe.  I am so glad I tried this recipe because I have found my favorite recipe for a meatloaf.  This is smooth, moist, flavorful, beautiful to look at, excellent flavor and texture, very easy.

I followed this recipe as printed, except I made one change, I  replaced the ketchup with Campbells Healthy Request tomato soup (undiluted).  Preparation is easy, and I served the meatloaf with red-skin potato (mashed with skins), and  lightly steamed peas..  a hit in my household, I will make this again!!

Not a meatloaf kinda family, but have made this recipe more thane once because we really like it!  Decided to make it this evening, but discovered I was out of celery right in the middle of prepping.  BUMMER!  However, I had fresh broccoli with stems, so I cut the florets off and peeled the stalks, cut them up as I would have the celery and put them in the blender.  Nobody noticed the change!

I made this for my husband who is a committed carnivore (I and my daughters are pescatarian) and he loved it! Typically he thinks my cooking is bland and because I don't Taste the meat dishes I make him, I have a hard time knowing what to do differently. But he was very pleased with this. I cut the recipe in half and it made one large loaf. However the loaf shrank considerably during cooking. I used almond milk instead of the milk and topped it with BBQ sauce. Very moist and not crumbly, as promised. It was however swimming in grease when I took it out of the oven to check on it at 1.5 hours. I drained the grease and cooked for another 10 minutes and it was perfect!I will definitely make tis again and freeze the second loaf.

I made this meatloaf it was very tasty, but it was also greasy too. I am not a big meatloaf eater but I wanted to try this out. I will make it again but I will do it with ground turkey, & smoked italian turkey sausage. I will also use season panko bread crumbs instead cracker crumbs

I set out to make my boyfriend a meatloaf he would like, plus last more than one of two meals. I've never made this dish before, either.

I was confused as to what constituted "pork sausage". I  just grabbed a pound of Italian sausage, took the meat out of the casing and combined it. Wow! I'm still getting compliments more than a month later, and true to its title it didn't crumble! I will definitely make it again!

I was surprised to see no eggs in this recipe but my son (who hates eggs) was very happy.  I didn't use green pepper (not fond of it) but otherwise followed the recipe using sausage with sage added instead of adding the sage.  True to it's name, it didn't crumble!

I made this tonight and it was wonderful! I thought with the onions it might be too powerful but it was great. This is the best recipe I have made yet for meatloaf. My 13 month old devoured it. Oh..and in Texas we LOVE ketchup on our meatloaf! I highly recommend this recipe, it has great flavor.

Tweaked it for ingredients I had in hand but it still came out great and held together well. Ended up with 2lb just beef and didn't have soup mix so I did tbls dried onions, tsp powdered onion and 2 tbls  better than boullion, also just used regular bread crumbs. Next time I'm going to flavor up the ketchup a bit more for the top but this is definitely replacing my old meatloaf recipe.

I did not have the veggies to add, bummer, I bet it would have enhanced the flavor. I had the rest of the ingredients and added an egg just to be sure... and it was super good! I will make again, its a keeper recipe.

This recipe turned out good I only used half of the onion soup mix because of the salt and added worstershire sauce to the meatloaf mixture. And it didn't crumble.

I've been waiting for this my whole life. This was amazing and it stays together. Imagine that?! :-) The few changes I did make. RED bell pepper, medium onion and three medium stalks of celery, chopped and sautéed in a little olive oil for 5 minutes, until just soft, then pulsed 5-7 times in a mini processor. A whole roll of Ritz crackers, ground PORK (plain) and Heinz 57 for the sauce. The rest as follows. Thank you!

I had searched for a meatloaf recipe that did not crumble, had flavor, and was good as I remember my mother made,  this recipe met all requirements.  I had tried at least 15 different recipes all failed and I began to lose hope. I have made meatloaf with this recipe 15 or more times without failure.  For those who like left over meatloaf sandwiches, stop looking, this is the best.

It was good and I don't normally like meatloaf! I didn't have any  sage or celery. I chopped the pepper and onion with a couple carrots and sauteed them before adding to the meat mixture. I also made a ketchup brown sugar mixture for the top instead of plain ketchup. This stayed together nicely for my husband to make sandwiches!
I also made my own onion soup mix that I found on this site

This was truly a great meatloaf. I went light on the ketchup because we're not really fans, and I think I could have even left it off entirely. This one is a keeper.

I have tried this recipe a couple of times. Didn't fall apart and the taste is great, I do switch up some of the ingredients, I used hot Italian sausage and sometimes I change that to the mild sausage. Family loves this recipe.

Thought I had onion soup mix, but didn't. Used a packet of brown gravy mix instead...turned out very flavourful. Easy to slice for sandwiches the next day. I will definitely be putting this recipe in my rotation!

Very good. Left out the chopped onion and salt because of the Onion Soup dry mix, which has enough salt and onion to suit our tastes.

My kids love meatloaf and I love sandwiches using the leftovers.  Instead of the crackers I use 1 cup of dry oatmeal.  This is a good way to hide some veggies if you have picky kids.

I tried this recipe tonight and it is flavorful, but it is very greasy.  I didn't think to look for nutrition information until after it was made, and I couldn't find anything, which may be a good thing!  It is tasty, but I will probably look for a lighter recipe.  It did crumble on me as well as some other reviewers I think because it's so tender (due to all the grease) that it just falls apart.

I follwed the recipe and my meatloaf came out perfectly. both in taste and in texture. This will be my meatloaf recipe from now on. My boys also loved it, this one is a definite keeper.

I made this for the first time for about 15 people & everyone really enjoyed it! I used frozen 3 pepper/onion blend for time's sake & added garlic powder. I didn't use quite as much milk as it called for either. And for the glaze, I used ketchup /brown sugar /yellow mustard combo.....much better than just plain ketchup. All in all this recipe held true,  no crumbling!

i made frosted meatloaf using this recipe. i used 1 cup breadcrumbs instead of crackers and cut the milk down. it was awesome. everyone loved it, including the 3yr old that seldom likes anything, lol.
