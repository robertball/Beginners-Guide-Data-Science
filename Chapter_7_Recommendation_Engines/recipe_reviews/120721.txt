My Grandma made this pie every peach season. It is dream-licious and very easy to make.  Just when you think it couldn't taste any more lucious, try adding 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon to the cream mixture before pouring it over the peaches.  The scent of cinnamon wafting through the house makes this all the more lovely.

The filling never set up.  :(  It was good, just peaches in creamy sauce in a crust... and yes, I did put the flour in.

My husband thought it was the best peach pie ever.  Made exactly to the recipe.  I had to cover my crust with foil half way through the bake time to keep from getting too brown.

This was the first fresh fruit pie that I have made. I followed the directions exactly and it turned out very nicely. I boiled the peaches for 1 minute then plunged them in ice water to make peeling them easier.

So easy, and so yummy. It looks pretty too! I could only get 3 very large sliced peaches into the crust, but it turned out really well anyway. Spooned a dollop of whipped cream on top, just to gild the lily. Thanks for the great recipe.

I have made this pie for years.  Before that my mother made it.  Our family loves this--it is a summer tradition.  I sprinkle cinnamon on top.  The amount of flour will differ depending on the juiciness of the peaches.  Best is the recipe as stated, with peaches that are ripe but firm.

Not bad, but not exceptional either.  Had a distinct raw flour taste to it.  Mine did set up fine, and took the recommended amount of cooking time.  The only adjustment I made to the original recipe was to add cinnamon.  Should have added a touch of vanilla extract to provide depth of flavor.  Not sure what to do about raw flour taste.

Best and easiest pie ever to make! OK, we cheated and used a large can of peaches so the cream didn't set as it should but... omgosh, delicious!!!  The grandkids loved it so much, we had to make it the next night!  We will use the fresh peaches next time and give it a try.  I can't imagine it being any better.  Thank you so much for sharing.
