This pancakes were so completely awful. I took one bite and threw them out. You could taste the baking soda and they tasted very eggy. Not good at all. Donâ€™t waste your ingredients on this recipe.

I did not care for the strong taste of baking soda. Not sure if it can be reduced and still have the right consistently

I followed directions exactly as given. I'm sorry to say but they were a huge disappointment.

The baking soda is overpowering but they're nice and fluffy so I will try it again with half the amount b. soda as suggested by another reviewer.

After searching for a low carb pancake I found this recipe. The only change I made was using 1/2 teaspoon baking soda rather than full teaspoon. These were a bit dry but overall I was very pleased with the taste and texture.  You can really taste the coconut which is a good thing for me. I topped with sugar free syrup. These really satisfied my pancake craving. I will definitely be making these again.

We made this recipe once and We loved it, well some of us. Yes, I tasted the baking soda some, now some of you might think I'm alittle odd, but the truth is I just like that flavor. But now that we are making it again I'm going to add a little less baking soda see if it still turns out good. I'm thinking if the first few don't turn out well we can easily add more.  I'm doing a quarter teaspoon less per batch. But we liked it so well that I'm making it 4 times the recipe this time. I'm so glad to find some recipes that have a good flavor that I don't have to keep trying and failing all the time.  Thanks for sharing! I've tried so many different things on my own when things didn't taste really good at all and I ate it anyway as I could not afford to buy expensive ingredients and throw it out.

I've experimented with a few coconut pancake recipes, and found this one to be easy to make and tasty! If I made again, I wouldn't add salt, because my butter was salted... Something I failed to think about ahead of time.

these cooked well, but they tasted more coconutty than i prefer in a pancake, and since I'm not on a paleo diet i prefer the regular gluten free pancake mixes, but it was fun trying a new one.
