Ive made this recipe but I had no cornflakes so I used special K and that was amazing. Then I tried it with Corn and please if you get a chance try with it with Special K you wont be disapointed! I also halfed it again to make thicker crust...YUMMMMMY!

I used the recipe as a base, but changed it around to accommodate what I already had in the kitchen.  For the crust, I used Honey Bunches of Oats cereal mixed with a little graham cracker crumbs, crunchy pb, and only 3 tbs corn syrup.  Then for the filling I mixed vanilla ice cream with 2 bars of crushed butterfingers.  I then sprinkled a little reserved crust and butterfingers on top.  It came out great and I got lots of compliments on it.

This is a family favorite. The recipe I have from years ago called "Drumstick Pie" calls for Cocoa Krispies cereal. It tastes just like a drumstick, one of my DH's favorite ice cream treat.

I made this for a picnic and it was a big hit.  Very yummy!  I used Honey Bunches of Oats cereal and it didn't fit in a pie plate.  I ended up using a springform pan and it worked great.  I used only 3 tablespoons of the corn syrup so it wouldn't be too sweet.  Next time I'll probably try honey instead of corn syrup.  This is a keeper!!

So simple, and yet SO GOOD! I used Breyer's Lactose Free vanilla ice cream for this and I was so happy I almost cried.

Can you say Peanut Buster Bar Pie?  I changed the recipe slightly for the ingredients I had on hand.  I used a graham cracker crust, spread warmed hot funge on bottom, sprinkled spanish peanuts on top, spread on thawed vanilla ice cream, drizzled with chocolate sauce and more spanish peanuts and froze.  YUM!!!

This is good!  I did not have any peanuts, so I used crunchy peanut butter.  Instead of a honey-nut corn flake, I used Wheaties; it was still a tad sweet for our tastes.  I used Pralines & Cream ice cream and topped it with a bit of caramel.  The flavors worked well together; it was, again, just a bit sweet for us.  I'm sure I'll try this again at some point, but I'll leave out the corn syrup.  Additionally, I think I'll try Peanut Butter and Chocolate ice cream topped with a bit of chocolate syrup.  Thanks for the great dessert!

I couldn't find honey nut cornflakes, so used honey-crunch peanut butter.  This was a popular dessert, especially with the kids.  I'll definitely do it again and try some other varieties of ice cream & toppings.

Spectacular summer dessert pie.  I used Crunchy Honey Nut Cereal in the crust, low-fat vanilla ice cream, a layer of whipped topping on top, and then the crushed peanuts.  Served with chocolate syrup, and this was very popular.  I am not even a big peanut fan, and I definitely ate my fair share!  Will make again and even try different flavors of ice cream

Made this exactly as written, but made two pies in disposable pie tins.  Brought both to a 4th of July party.  One pie was gone almost in an instant by six adults and two children.  Later that evening our friend wanted some more, asked if anyone wanted any, when the rest of declined, having eaten way too much of everything, he showed up at the patio table with the remaining pie and a spatula, eating the entire pie!  So good, and easy enough to customize if you need.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This is very delicious and the best part is no cooking so it is perfect for a hot day.  I did have to use a 10" pie pan because there is a lot of crust and I also could not find the cornflake cereal so subbed Honey Oat Cluster cereal.  We used hot fudge and hot caramel topping.

After 2 of my children became lactose intolerant we had to change the way we eat.  Tin roof ice cream was no longer an option as they don't make that flavor in soy ice cream.  We made this recipe using So-Delicious soy ice cream and honey bunches of oats cereal.  It tasted very similar to tin roof ice cream and everyone LOVED it!  This will become a regular for us.  Thanks for a great recipe!

made this as a summer treat and it was heartily enjoyed :)  I took the advice of another reviewer and used Honey bunches of oats because it was all I had on hand.  Very yummy.  I also crushed up some willowcrisp bars on top (crispy crunch type bars).  Yummy!  A great compliment to the peanut butter in the base.  Thank you.

Really good and really easy. The recipe made enough "crust" for 2 pies. Would be great with all sorts of other nut/ice cream/topping variations.

I made this last night after finding the recipe quite by accident.  It was deemed by my guests, husband and children the BEST thing they had ever tasted.  It is incredibly easy and ever so impressive and yummy!  Thank you.

used honey bunches of oats and it was a hit!! I might try using tin roof ice cream next time for extra chocolate crunch.  This was quite rich though...only need a small piece. Thanks for sharing!

I found this recipe on this site a few years ago.  EXCELLENT!!!  We have made it numerous times and for quite a few parties!  
It has become a favorite in my house, a big hit at parties and the most popular dessert!  It's really really easy and quick!  We also have used regular cornflakes which work out just the same.
Gotta give credit where it's due!  
Job well done to the one who gave this recipe!

EASY FAST GOOD  This is very good. How can you go wrong . Sweet crunch ,chocolate, ice cream and peanuts. It's a Tin a Roof. I used Special K honey nut, and corn syrup. I drizzled
chocolate sauce then a few peanuts on bottom . Pralines and Cream ice cream and more chocolate sauce with sprinkling of peanuts . So good. Next time I think I can have a ziplock bag of
frozen cereal crunch ready. Just add all ingredients whenever we choose without worrying about a pie plate frozen in my freezer . Iloveit
