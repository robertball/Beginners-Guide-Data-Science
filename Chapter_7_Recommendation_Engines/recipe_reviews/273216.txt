Wonderful cookies! I love everything about these: flavor, texture, ease of making them--it's all good! I used rolled oats instead of instant, and used 1 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp baking powder to make a chewier cookie. They needed 14 minutes to bake, and I got 21 cookies out of the recipe. If you're looking for a delicious, wholesome, flavorful cookie, then you've found the right recipe! Thank you so much for sharing it!
