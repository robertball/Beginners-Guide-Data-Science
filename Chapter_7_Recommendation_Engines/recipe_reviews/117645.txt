I made this with ginger sesame dressing instead of the Italian because I had some to use up and added red bell pepper and pea pods for color. Very easy and would probably make again sticking with the sesame ginger dressing.

I would probably give this 3.5 stars.  It was ok, but I personally thought it needed a lot more flavor.  I doubled the sauce because I doubled the noodles.  I used uncooked shrimp, but it cooked quickly.  I halved the hot pepper flakes because I was worried about the heat, but ended up adding chili oil for more heat.  I also added 2 cloves of garlic to the sauce because I couldn't believe there was not any in it.  I think next time I will add the cilantro at the end and not cook it for maximum flavor.  It was fast and easy to make.  Thanks for sharing.

Usually I make a recipe as close to 'as written' to give a review of the actual recipe. However, so many reviewers suggested not marinating the shrimp in the dressing. So I skipped the dressing part and also doubled the sauce with the exception of the red pepper. Only used 1/2 tsp. because my daughter had to eat it, too. Got lazy and shredded the carrot instead of julienne. Added in some broccoli for color and served over a multigrain thin pasta. Very tasty!! Will be making this again. Thanks for the recipe.

Super easy and yummy too!  Like a couple others, I opted to not place the shrimp in the salad dressing, just used  as is.  Only made this for the 2 of us, but left 'sauce' ingredients as noted due to some comments about being too dry.  Used light smooth peanut butter, minced fresh parsley (don't like cilantro) and added some pepper strips instead of onions.  I also only used a bit of sesame oil to sautee the veeggies.  Really yummy as leftovers too!

I made this for my husband - I don't like shrimp, but he does.  He said it was really good and came back for seconds.  Some things I noticed that I would do different next time are - make extra dressing because the noodles dry out in the fridge (although he didn't seem to notice).  Break the noodles in 3rds before cooking to make eating easier.  I also added a few splashes of soy sauce to the salad after it was all mixed to give it a darker, bolder color.  I did not have chunky peanut butter and my kids won't eat it so I did not want to purchase any,  I used creamy with a lot of chopped up dry roasted peanuts, I also sprinkled some on top for effect.

It was good.  A little too rich for authentic Thai.  Maybe using rice noodles, a little less peanut butter (I used natural) and adding some peanuts to the stir fry would help.  Otherwise, the flavors were good.  Tip for parents with little ones:  I tossed the pasta in with the shrimp and veggies and served the kids, then added the spicy peanut sauce (which means I could make it as spicy as hubby and I wanted) and tossed again.

awesome recipe, and yes, double the sauce and use rice noodles instead to make it more thai authentic! i also used raw shrimp and omitted the italian dressing and like someone else mentioned, can't believe garlic was not part of recipe. I used 5-6 garlic cloves and chunky peanut butter is a must!

This is one I remake over and over again now!  I don't always have all of the veggies on hand and have made it without the shrimp plenty of times!  It's turned out great every time!  Definitely a keeper!  I think that the flavors taste better over rice noodles as opposed to angel hair pasta, but that's my personal preference.  Regardless, cheap, easy, healthy, and sooo good!

Great recipe. Guests raved. Easy to make. I used yellow onions to substitute. I used raw shrimp and peeled/deviened/cooked them in the salad dressing.

I have made this with both chicken and shrimp.  Both were fabulous.  I made sure to double the sauce.  Also, I didn't bother to marinade the shrimp in the Italian dressing; the peanut sauce was yummy enough on its own.  This really is amazingly good!  I am already planning to make it again soon!

I did not care for this recipe. I simmered the sauce to thicken it before adding it to the shrimp. That seemed to help thicken the sauce. What disappointed me about the sauce was the flavor. It wasn't spicy enough for my taste. I will not be making this recipe again

This was awesome!  My whole family loved it, even my picky 6-year-old.  The only change I made was I added some snow peas when I added the shrimp.  I went light on the crushed red pepper for the kid and served it with Thai chili sauce on the side so we could spice ours up a bit more.

My husband and I agree - a real keeper. Made it mostly as shown with 2 exceptions: I used Kraft Asian Sesame dressing and marinade instead of Italian salad dressing and I added about 1-1/2 cup green beans. Delicious!

Was disappointed. Agree with all reviewers that say sauce is plain and lacks something. I added more soy sauce, red pepper flakes, honey, added garlic (surprisingly, as others have noted, recipe did not call for any) and still could have been more flavorful.

This recipe has a good flavour but I found that I wanted more in it. Next time I will cut back on the noodles, increase the shrimp and add in some bell peppers. Also it is best to eat the same day as the sauce goes grainy when reheated

I substituted raw shrimp and put it in with the carrots and onions to cook.  I also substituted hot chili oil, 1/2 tsp for the red pepper flakes. Cooked broccolie crowns with the pasta, used smooth peanut butter instead of chunky and sprinkled with crushed cashews.

I made  extra dressing. I would next time break the noodles in half before cooking to make mixing easier. I also added a crushed peanuts. I did not have chunky peanut butter but did have Thia peanut sauce on hand. peanuts. I recommend frying the cooked noodles with the onions and carrots a little before adding the shrimp.

I made 4X times the sauce with 1 lb. of pasta and was glad I did.  I added a  LOT of broccoli, baby carrots (not julienned, just the teeny, tiny ones), and red pepper slices.  I sauted the carrots first with Olive Oil til they were.... crisp/tender.  Then I added the pepper, while the broccoli steamed for 2 minutes in the microwave.  Then I added the broccoli and the green onions to the pan.  I cooked the shrimp in a separate pan.  I dumped the cooked angel hair on top of the "stir-fried" veggies and shrimp, and poured the amazing sauce over that.  THEN I added chopped cilantro (much more than the recipe called for, because we love it).  I didn't cook the cilantro, because that kills it's flavor.  I barely tossed the whole mess because it was so MUCH - but it looked lovely on plates this way - a scoop of pasta, topped with veggies and shrimp.  That sauce is unbelievable!  We'll be having this again soon!

I skipped the shrimp marinade as others suggested, used ground ginger instead of fresh, and added roasted peanuts. I liked the flavors but I think more sauce would have made it perfect. It got a little dry for my taste. I will make again and double the sauce. That should do it.

My husband and I looove this. 
I skip the part with the italian dressing and also I use authentic Thai rice noodles and it is delicious. 
He likes it much more spicy than I do, so he adds his own helping of red pepper.

This was pretty dry. If I ever make it again, I will find a liquid to add.

I scaled the recipe to three servings but kept the amount of sauce the same. For a more authentic Thai flavor I used galanga instead of ginger, and I added a good slosh of fish sauce. If I were to make this again, I wouldn't bother marinading the shrimp in the Italian dressing - I don't think it added any flavor at all. Anyway, we enjoyed this. Thanks, Ramona!

Outstanding! Gourmet flavor without being difficult or time consuming. I loved the peanut sauce! I was forced to omit the cilantro 'cause I didn't have any, and I halved the recipe. You could use chicken for this recipe as well.

This was great!  Followed the recipe as is except we used vermicelli pasta instead of angel hair. Very flavorful with just a little kick.  A new one for the "keeper" box!

Just made this for dinner.  I used red and green pepper, zucchini and mushroom as veggies, and plain old Mr. Noodle in place of pasta.  It turned out great.  I might add a little more honey and a little less peanut butter next time.  Fresh cilantro is key!

This was very simple to put together and very yummy.  I did not make any adjustments to the recipe.  I was going to take leftovers for lunch the next day, but there weren't any!

Very good!  I made a pound of angel hair, so I doubled the sauce and shrimp.  I also did not have fresh ginger, so I used ground instead which was fine.

Yummy!  I loved this.  Since everyone said there wasn't enough sauce, I just sort of added a bit extra of everything.  The taste was exactly what I thought it would be.  Thanks for a yummy recipe!!

Very tasty. I added some chicken breast -  cubed it and cooked it in with the carrots and onions. I also used rice noodle instead of the angel hair pasta only because that's what I had in the house. It worked well.

This was so very good and easy. Every bit as good as a restaurant.  It can be sort of a "kitchen sink" recipe...whatever veggies are on hand -- even frozen mixed ones work OK.  I add fresh jalapenos for more kick.

The leftovers are every but as yummy as a cold sald.  It would be a good potluck dish to make ahead as a salad.

This recipe is delicious. Also great with chicken instead of shrimp. I was tempted to not bother with going out and buying the Sesame Oil. But, I'm glad I didn't because it really added a great Asian flavor. Adding peanut halves and mushrooms make it even better. Easy to make too.

Fixed this for dinner and really enjoyed it!  I used whole wheat pasta (we're trying to eat healthier) and that even tasted good with this dish.  We will be making this often.  THANKS!!

I saw this recipe in the San Diego newspaper years ago and it's been a favorite!  The only thing that is different is that I don't use chicken broth and instead of throwing out the Italian dressing I use that to cook the shrimp.
