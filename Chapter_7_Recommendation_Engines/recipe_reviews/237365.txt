I'm Persian and respect your recipe but as you have said it is not completely ghormeh sabzi. The main difference is that there are no potatoes in ghormeh sabzi and also the major herb is Fenugreek, which is very aromatic and should be used moderately. It also has leek in it and the herbs are all chopped and should be stir fried in a small amount of oil. This stew has a lot of green herbs in it so that's why the result should be completely green I have also attached a picture for ghormeh sabzi.

This recipe was quite an experience! I have never tasted anything like these flavor profiles before. It was shocking at first, but each bite tasted better and better. I would say the lime was very strong, and I did cut the cilantro back a bit (I usually don't care for it). But the over experience was a good one.

I have never made this "Not-Quite-Persian Ghormeh Sabzi (Green Stew) for the Slow Cooker" recipe, although I have had "Ghormeh Sabzi" many times. I just wanted to comment that this stew is immensely popular among Iranians who eat herbs ("sabzi") in large quantities the way Westerners eat vegetables. When I lived in Iran, I saw street vendors commonly selling bunches of fresh herbs out of wheel barrels. I also saw my Iranian neighbor wash and prepare two eighty-kilogram burlap sacks filled with herbs to put in the freezer for making this recipe over the winter (she would be making it many times over, obviously). I never actually liked "Ghormeh Sabzi" myself because I always found it bitter. I made some for my Iranian-born husband for his new year (Norooz) a month ago and it was the first "Ghormeh Sabzi" I ever liked. I had left out the cilantro because I didn't have any, and learned from my husband that it is the cilantro that gives it the bitter taste. My husband complained a lot: He definitely wants cilantro in his "Ghormeh Sabzi"! I think we need "his and hers" "Ghormeh Sabzi" at our home! If you are serving this dish to an Iranian, be sure to serve it with steamed BASMATI rice. This dish could easily be adapted to be a vegetarian (vegan) dish since a lot of the flavor comes from the herbs and lime juice. Thank you Jedigeek for sharing your recipe. It is a lovely tribute to your stepfather.

This may not be true ghormeh sabzi but I really like it! I did make a couple tweaks though. I added in 1 more potato to the recipe, used 2 lbs of meat and tripled the amount of spinach - I found even a 10 oz bag of spinach, once sauteed, was not enough. I also cut down the amount of broth in the recipe to 3 cups (I may even cut it down further to 2.5 cups), and dialed back the lime juice to 2/3 cup. I find cooked this way, it is far less brothy and quite delicious!

I made it per recipe but I have to say, I did not care for it.
