I'm the submitter of this recipe, and I haven't been here in a long while, but I was APPALLED when I read the recipe here.  It is supposed to read ONE TABLESPOON onion juice, not a whole onion!!!!!  No wonder some people said it was too onion-y!  Honestly, I don't believe I submittied it that way, maybe a typo when Allrecipes posted it.  So sorry it came out that way!  It really is a great dressing.  Additionally I've found it gets by very well with only 1/2 cup sugar instead of 3/4 cup.

This is an out standing recipe. I have been making this for years. The only difference in my recipe is I use only 1/2 cup sugar and 1T minced onion and only 1T poppy seed. I have made without onions too. Mix in blender without the seeds. Add seeds after blending. It really is restaurant quality. Thanks Cathy!

Very tasty recipe Cathy.  I followed the suggestions of some of the other reviewers and used only 1/2 cup of sugar and maybe 1/4 cup of grated onion.  I added a little balsamic vinegar (the brand I use is strong and rather sweet) for a bit more flavor.  I mixed this in the blender, adding the oil in a small stream so I ended up with a mayonnaise-like dressing and then added the poppy seeds.  On baby spinach with fresh raspberries and crumbled blue cheese, it was an ideal summer evening salad.

My husband and 5 year-old love this. I made a spinach salad with sliced strawberries and toasted sliced almonds.  This dressing went perfectly!  Made a great refreshing "summer" salad.

I would rename this dressing to Onion-Poppy Seed Dressing II. I only used a very small part of an onion, but it was way too much for this. Granted, I used a white onion. I would only recommend using a SWEET onion for this recipe. Otherwise, this dressing wasn't bad.

Yummy!  Fantastic version of a cole slaw dressing.  I made a couple of minor alterations which turned out perfectly...Used 1/2 c. white sugar with 1/4 c. brown sugar, used 1/2 C. veg oil with 1/2 c. Wildtree's Roasted Onion Grapeseed Oil*, added 1 tsp prepared horseradish.  Served dressing over 1 head shredded red cabbage, 1/2 large shredded vidalia onion, 2 shredded carrots and  1/2 C. roasted slivered almonds.  *You may have read in some of my other reviews that I love Wildree Herbs' products.  Top notch ingredients.  I don't know where they're available around the country (I'm in R.I.), but you can check them out at www.wildtreeherbs.com.

Wonderful recipe!! Very tasty...I didn't have the patience to grate 1 whole onion, so I used maybe 1/4 of one.  Only thing that needs to change is that after a day or so the dressing gets pretty thick.  Might need to add more liquid.  Overall, I was impressed!

Great recipe.  I've made it a couple of times now and when it's past its "use by" date we use it to baste meat on the braai (barbecue).  It is absolutely super.  I vary it with the amount of seeds, sugar and type of vinegar and oil but it's just as good with any variation.  Keep them coming.  Susie Blue, Johannesburg, SA

I decided grating onion might be messy and I expected a whisked dressing might separate.  I used a 1/4 inch slice of a large sweet onion.  I used a blender food processor attachement and started with the onion and vinegar on the highest speed for a few seconds.  Add the rest of the ingredients except poppy seeds and process for several more seconds.  Stir in poppy seeds.  The onion is completely blended in and the dressing won't separate.

Excellent!! - Have used at several dinner partys with a strawberry salad.  Several people have commented it is one of the best salads they have ever had!  Only adjustment I make is that I use 3/4 of an onion.

This is an excellant recipe. I used to make it all the time for the restaurant I worked for. I like to cook the sugar, vinegar, onions and spices together. Then cool it down and add the poppy seeds.

Like some others, I halved the sugar and used Stevia.   Used a quarter small onion and blended all in the food processor.  Very flavorful!

Served to 20 ladies today, who loved it.  I didn't realize you were not supposed to use the grated onion.  I used a purple onion, juice and all.  It was awesome, and a neat color.

Delicious! FUN COMBINATION OF RECIPES HERE: I decided to combine the Poppy Seed Dressing I and II recipes, one being more traditionally vinegrette, and the other more contemporary milky/creamy dressing. Here's what I did: I substituted honey instead of sugar. Then I did the oil and cider vinegar and I used wholegrain dijon mustard and then added the lowfat mayo and milk (but less than the recipe calls for) and blended it together. Then added the poppyseeds later. Delicious mix, making a creamier version of the vinegrette! Great with spinach or other green mix with mandarin oranges, nuts, or other berries, and chicken!

This is very easy to make and very delicious!  I served it over a romaine lettuce salad with mandarin oranges, blueberries, cashews and swiss cheese.  I also cut down the sugar to 1/2 cup. I could have even gone with a little less sugar, but since this was for company I didn't want to play around with it too much.  Some people were saying they used less onion than called for.  Perhaps  they misunderstood the recipe?  It is not the onion you put in--it is the onion JUICE.  I wasn't sure how I was going to get the juice out of the grated onion but I just picked it all up in my hands and squeezed it into a bowl.  Worked great!

I made this recipe and my wife loves it.  I let it sit in the refrigerator for 24 hours and it was unbelievably good. I scaled it down to 8 servings and instead of the onion grated, I used a 1/2 teaspoon of onion powder,,,,worked great.  Thanks for the recipe,,,,this is a definite keeper

The only thing I added was some chopped apple. This would be very good over a fruit or veggies. We love this over spinach with dried cranberries, walnuts, and orange slices. Sometimes we even throw on fresh strawberries.

This is a great dressing.  I used it over romaine, craisins, cashews, red onion, and cucumber.  YUM!  I discovered I was out of yellow and white onions and I used a red onion for the dressing.  It turned it pale pink!  I'll be using it again for my Easter Dinner salad as I thought the color was excellent and springy!

I've made this dressing so many times I've lost count. Everytime I take it on my summer salad mix everyone wants the recipe. The only thing I've changed is I put 2 tsp of onion powder instead of grating the onion and use 1 tsp of poppy seed. They eat this instead of dessert. Love it, Love it!!

very yummy, just what I was looking for.  I used my magic bullet to blend up everything but the poppyseeds.  I used 1/4 of a yellow onion, and 1/2 cup grapeseed oil, 1/2 cup light olive oil, otherwise everything as written.  Done in the bullet, it is creamy, like a mayo dressing.

Good basic recipe and easy to make.  I also make something similar except I use 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup regular vinegar, 1/2 medium onion cut up, 1 1/4 teaspoons salt, 1 1/4 teaspoons dry mustard. I use a blender and blend the above ingredients. Then I add 1 cup salad oil and blend only for about 10 seconds (or it can get too thick). Then I add the poppyseeds and only blend for 10 more seconds or less. Similar flavor, but not as sweet.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very sweet but good.  I did cut back slightly on the sugar but it still tasted grainy.  I was concerned the grated onion would over power this so I tried onion powder instead.  Next time I will try using a sweet onion.

This is both delicious and super easy to make ... a real winner.  You can cut down on the amount of sugar without harming the taste; I started with 1/2 cup and added a tablespoon and found it plenty sweet enough.

Very tasty! I put in 1 tsp minced garlic instead of the onion juice, and used olive oil.

Great tasting recipe.  I lessened the sugar and put the onion in my food chopper until it was mush.  Can't wait to put on my salad tonight.  BTW, best from a lady at church romaine, chopped g.s. apple, red onion, feta & poppyseed dressing.  Great on summer nights.

This is an easy and delicious dressing.  I cut the recipe down to 1/4.  I also subbed onion powder (about 1/4 t for my small recipe) and it turned out fabulously.  It is pretty sweet, but was a nice touch to a spinach salad with fruit, nuts and cheese.

really good! i made this for one person, so I had to adjust the measurements but it still turned out really nicely. I also added a little lemon juice and crushed cloves which gave it a nice little spice and a unique flavor. It compliments a strawberry chicken salad nicely :)

I made this recipe and it seems to have way to many poppy seeds in it.  If I were to re-do it i would cut out the poppy seeds by half or even less.  It has a good all around taste, but the poppy seeds just over power it too much, and as Cathy later said, only add 1 T of onion, not the whole onion.

Great recipe.  My family asks for this at cookouts and gatherings.  I only grate about 2 tablespoons of an onion and that seems plenty.

Delicious! the perfect dressing. I did adjust the recipe a bit to make it easier and much more low fat. My version of this recipe has 3.5 grams of fat per serving, while the original has 14 grams of fat per serving.   First of all I only used 1/4 cup oil, and I added 1 1/2 cups water. I added something called "xantham gum" it's a white powdery thickener that is often used in gluten free cooking. Commercial salad dressings use it to emulsify and thicken. You can buy it in the gluten free section of some grocery stores, or at a whole foods store. It's kindof expensive, but a little bit goes a long way. Also, instead of grating the onion and using the juice I just added 1/8 cup chopped onion. Blended everything except the poppy seeds in the blender until smooth and thick, then mixed in the poppy seeds at the end. Fabulous! Drizzled the dressing over spinach, almonds, mandarine oranges, and bacon!

Some would say the 3/4 cup of sugar makes this dressing much too sweet. I think it's just preference. If you don't want it too sweet, add 1/2 cup sugar and see if you think it needs more. Other than that, it's a fantastic recipe that has us hooked.

great recipe-I use my microplane and grate the onion directly into the dressing. I have made it with sugar and with Splenda and had good results with both. I also cut the oil down to 3/4 cup to save calories.

Great recipe as is! I live in an area where onion juice is impossible to find. A 1/2 teaspoon of onion powder makes it work. I also like to add a little lemon juice for a different flavor.

Amazing…I used less onion and at times would use brown sugar. I also used oranges instead of strawberries.
Either way great hit!

Rather than grate a whole onion and use the reserved juice, I just used 1 tablespoon of grated fresh onion in the recipe.  WONDERFUL, thank you!

love the dressing - I made it low-cal by decreasing the oil and adding water and more vinigar.  I also used Splenda instead of sugar.

This is a good, easy dressing. I ran out of cider vinegar, so I combined it with red wine vinegar. I also subbed agave for sugar and used slightly less onion juice. I find most poppy seed dressings too sweet, but this was just right. It was perfect with Wasabi Secret Salad, from this site. It also went well with Mushroom Patacone Pita, sans pita and served as a salad.

This was very tasty. The only thing I changed was that I only used a little bit of onion. It makes a lot, so next time I'll cut the recipe in half. Served with Spinach Salad with Peaches and Pecans (recipe from this site). A great summer meal!
