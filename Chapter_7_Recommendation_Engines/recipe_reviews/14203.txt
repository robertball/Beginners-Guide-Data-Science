Strong garlic flavor! Must serve immediately because by the next day it's rather dry. Wouldn't make it again.

I would recommend using less than a tablespoon of garlic to anyone trying this recipe for the first time.  Also, I'm not a fan of olives so I omitted them and added a bit more roasted red pepper and feta, which took away a bit of the color-contrast you want in a salad but tasted just fine.  I hope it doesn't dry out overnight as I made it with the intention of having it for lunch tomorrow, but I don't see why the addition of a little olive oil couldn't remedy that problem.

I made this exactly as is, very easy to make and very flavorful.  This is a nice change of pace to the traditional side dishes or salads. This one has been added to my regulars.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

This was incredible. Someone brought this to a potluck lunch at work. Very tasty - I think it would make an excellent light lunch or dinner with a green salad on the side.

When we tried this recipe, everyone said, there is something missing here. If you are going to make this recipe, definitely use something like cilantro, and we added our family dressing recipe, and a bit of sugar. Don't put too much sugar in, it will spoil it. And put less feta cheese in than the recipe asks for.

This was tasty! I agree with the other that there is waaay too much garlic called for in here, just use it to taste, that's what I did. Nice, light and simple. This would also be great with a variety of additions. I did make more of the dressing then called for, but again, do it to your taste. The kids enjoyed this too (except for the feta, lol). I will be making this again and playing around with additions! Thanks for sharing. :)
