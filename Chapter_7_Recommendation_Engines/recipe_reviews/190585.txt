I had a dinner party a few days ago and I served this. It was a hit! I didn't want plain old cookies or anything so I figured, why not give bajadera a try? After reading through the recipe, I didn't think it would be that bad, and it was delicious! The animal crackers in this recipe tasted awesome. I will be making more tomorrow!

Bajadera Haiku: "Sinful, yet sloppy. Decadent, but messy treats. Not hard to prepare." I followed the recipe as written, using Costco's organic vanilla animal crackers, but my bottom layer never got past the goopy stage in the fridge, so when I tried to cut them into squares, I ended up w/ some squishy chunks. (Of course, my fingers didn't mind scooping up all those pieces and jamming them into my mouth.) I like that these were easy to make, with ingredients almost always on hand, and didn't require baking, but I'm not sure where I went wrong w/ the layers bleeding together. (Did I crush the crackers too finely? Not enough crackers? /muse.) Their texture and flavor is like fudge, and it sneaks up on you, tempting you w/ a "betcha-can't-eat-just-one."

This isn't exactly the bajadera I've had before but it was still delicious. I modified the recipe slightly by baking the mixture for 5 mins in a 350 degree oven. That's how you finish off Christmas "Crack" which is a very similar recipe and avoided the mushy, unset sections of the dessert. It was delicious and wonderful for shipping as it didn't break apart too easily and doesn't go stale like cookies do.

I had nothing to compare this to but it sounded like something fun to try.  I should have known better, looking over the list of ingredients, but it was like gnawing on hard sugar.  Fixed per directions:  It was waaay sweet and had a very firm texture like a granola bar.

I had animal crackers that needed to be used. I heard ZERO complaints for all that tried - just the sound of MMMMMM - YUMMY!
