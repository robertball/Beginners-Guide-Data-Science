The bite of the lemon and shallot work really well with the sweetness of the pom seeds.  This is a perfect winter salad.  Looking forward to serving it for the holidays.  It's so pretty.

This was OK--not bad, but not great. The flavors just didn't blend well for me. The shallot is a must; it adds depth. This would have drowned in 6T of oil; I used about 2t. Also, I used only half the lemon and zest, and I juiced the pom because I don't like the texture of the seeds. I still needed to add some stevia to soften the bite of the lemon. I think this might have worked better with arugula instead of watercress, but I don't plan to make it again. Thanks, anyway.

This was a HUGE hit at both orphan's dinners I made it for this Christmas. Light, seasonal and delicious. I would probably use less lemon next time, as it was too tart for my taste. I ended up adding a tablespoon of brown sugar and a squirt of balsamic glaze to mellow it out.

Excellent salad.  My shallot was way too strong, so I skipped that.  I'd like to add toasted pecans to it next time.  I happened to mix some leftovers of this salad with some leftover cold cooked pasta, and it made a spectacular pasta salad.

I used red leaf lettuce since I couldn't find watercress. The tartness of the lemon juice and zest in the dressing balanced nicely with the sweetness of the pomegranate. I used less oil than called for in the dressing - just a personal preference. The salad is colourful and looks nice if you have company for dinner.
