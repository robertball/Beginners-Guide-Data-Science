Close, but no cigar. This recipe turned out bland and lacked the flavor that I find in most thai food restaurants. I added a few cut up green beans and left out some of the cauliflower. I do not plan on making this recipe again.

This was a huge hit with my kids on "Adventurous Eaters Night". It was simple to cook the chicken in my crock pot, then throw everything together in just a few minutes. It was delicious!! Next time I am going to offer a variety of toppings for them to choose: raisins, golden raisins, peanuts, cashews, green onions, mango chutney, chopped hard boiled egg and anything else that sounds appealing!

Maybe I am crazy, I am pretty sensitive to spicy dishes, but this was so spicy I could barely even eat it.  I used broccoli instead of cauliflower and lite coconut milk, otherwise stayed with the recipe.  My mouth was on fire.  My husband did like it though.

I had to change a few things because I was missing a few ingredients, but it turned out really well!
I substituted green curry paste (2 tbsp) for the yellow curry powder, and a bit of Knorr vegetable soup for the chicken broth. I also used fresh grated ginger instead of ground ginger and added mushrooms, zucchini, and broccoli.

Very good-- I kicked it up a little with fresh ginger, which I just happened to have, and a tsp. of dried thai dragon chilis, which my friend grows.  We're not big on cauliflower either, so I added peas and an apple instead.  Obviously, this is a very adaptable recipe and a nice introduction to making your own curry.  Thanks for the post, Pam!

My husband requested chicken curry and that is how I found this website. Our whole family enjoyed this recipe, especially my husband, teenager, and six year old. The 10 year old who is a good eater, but doesn't appreciate curry, ate it without complaint. I used broccoli, and added a little more salt. It was VERY easy, and quick to make, especially if you can precut the ingredients ahead of time. I am really going to enjoy this site! Thank you!

Thought this was just ok. My kids, while they don't like spicy food, do eat a lot of Thai food and didn't think this recipe had a ton of flavor. My husband and I added hot sauce, but it was still just ok. We aren't big cauliflower fans,I used both broccoli and snow peas for the veggies. Probably won't make again. It was easy to do.

I thought this was pretty good but definitely needed some more flavour.

This just didn't do it for me, perhaps the excess amount of coconut milk made it too sweet for our likings. The boyfriend enjoyed it though, and said shredded coconut would make a nice touch. Will be making it again for him, but something else for me next time.
