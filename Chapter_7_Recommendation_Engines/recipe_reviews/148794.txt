This was good but it has a lot potential to be made great. I added a little garlic powder to the bread crumb mix and since plain bread crumbs were not specified I used Italian and added the spices listed. I also spray with pam olive oil spray. The egg wash didn't look to be nearly enough but it was perfect. My recommendation is to use fresh not frozen ravioli and maybe brush EVOO on or add a bit to the egg wash so its not so dry. Lastly I highly recommend turning your ravioli on the rack half way through. The underside was still a bit soft and undone with the top was perfectly browned.

Really good. I dipped in flour first, washed with a whole egg (didn't want to waste the yolk), then dunked in the crumbs (I used Italian seasoning and garlic salt in place of the basil and whatever else it called for), then sprayed with the cooking spray. This made for a nice, crispy coating and I still felt better eating them since they weren't fried (hey, you gotta save the calories where you can)! I think turning the ravioli would be much more trouble than it's worth and I would not recommend doing so. For dipping, I made an alfredo sauce and a pizza sauce and sprinkled everything with fresh parsley and parmesan. Fantastic! Thank you for submitting this recipe chefspecialty.

I made these as an app to go with spaghetti night. I coated them with pankp bread crumbs. I think all the reviews said they tended to taste rather bland so, I raided my new erb garden and added everything not nailed down. basil, oregano, thyme, sage, rosemary, cilantro, onion and garlic powder and a healthy amount of Parmasaen cheese, We liked them. Next time I will adjust the heat because at the 15 minute mark they were pretty crispy. I made a second batch and shortened the cooking time and they were much better. Mine were not frozen maybe that makes a difference. We will definitely have these again. I would like to get a more Italian taste to them next time. We didn't worry about sauce, we just used the pasta sauce.

Ugh! I just typed this once with enthusiasm then hit cancel instead of rate... I hope to express myself as well the second time. Thank you chefspecialty for the awesome recipe! The only changes I made were panko (didn't have bread crumbs) and baked mine on a foil-lined cookie sheet because I did not have a rack to put over. Mine were nicely browned and crunchy. I set the timer for 15 mins to check and just kept resetting and checking every 3 to 5 mins. until the right golden brown. I made homemade spaghetti sauce as a dip and truly enjoyed this pre SuperBowl. Next time, I plan to add garlic powder to the breading but I will not make any other changes. Now to hit rate instead of cancel.... :)

I made the recipe exactly as written only used panko bread crumbs instead of regular bread crumbs.  If I made this again I would add A LOT more spice to the breading mixture.  Fresh garlic, salt and pepper.  I thought it was a little on the bland side even with the parm- and I added extra.  I put foil on my baking sheet for easy clean up.  Thanks for sharing.  My daughter enjoyed this a lot.

These were good, not great. Easy and simple. The only thing that I did different was to spray the raviolis with olive oil cooking spray. I felt that without that step they could tend to be overly dry. Also watch them as they bake; they could overcook.

A really great idea! They were like crispy pasta bites that were amazing dipped in a bolognese sauce. I recommend having some sort of dip sauce with this (bolognese/alfredo)and using quality ravioli. I added parm, Italian seasoning to my breadcrumbs and they came out great - not a single left over.

These turned out really good, better than I expected. I made them as written and served them with marinara sauce for dipping. Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderfully easy dish. I really enjoyed this once it was finished. It did have a few minor issues though, as I ran out of egg wash half way though and didn't have another egg so the next time I will use the whole egg. These did turn out beautiful and crispy but the corners turned out a little chewy on them. Other than that I had no complaints. These were not quite as good as I get at the restaurant but they were darned good nonetheless and I will fix this again. Thanks chefspecialty!

I wanted to make toasted ravioli without frying, so I gave this a chance.  I brushed mine with butter and used seasoned breadcrumbs.  These are pretty dry so make sure you have some dipping sauce.  My toddler didn't much care for them, but i thought they were a healthier option.

These were tasty; I scaled the recipe down to make a snack for myself today.  I too dredged my ravioli in flour before doing the egg wash (and I used my whole egg), then dipped in the bread mixture.  Since the recipe didn't specify, I used Italian bread crumbs.  Didn't have cooking spray, so I skipped that step.  Maybe that was why the majority of mine puffed way up???  In any case, the ones that puffed up like that ended up being slightly tough, but tasty nonetheless.  I dipped them in some leftover homeade alfredo sauce that from last night's dinner.  They were good for a quick little snack...  :)

This was really good. I will be adding garlic powder to the mix next time. 15 minutes seemed long enough for cooking in my oven. Thanks for the recipe!

These were a nice change when I wasn't in the mood for just regular ravioli.  I added garlic and onion powder and salt to the breadcrumbs.  They were a little chewy but I think that was my quality of ravioli (cheap!).

I made these essentially as directed, but eliminated the oregano and basil (just personal preference),and added garlic powder and black pepper.  I used homemade breadcrumbs, and a bit extra parmesan cheese. I served them with a sesame mayonnaise-based dip. We preferred them right from the oven.  Thank you chefspecialty for taking the time to post this recipe. We will certainly be making them again.

This is such an interesting way to cook ravioli! Like other reviewers I coated in flour, used the whole egg, and used panko instead of breadcrumbs which I seasoned with garlic powder, salt, italian seasoning and red chili peppers for a kick. Unfortunately I didn't have parmesan cheese or cooking spray. They did come out dry (maybe because of no cooking spray- I'll buy some next time) but the dipping sauce (I used chunky garden spaghetti sauce) made it a non-issue. Four stars instead of five because this isn't something I would make on a regular basis. Might use this recipe again for finger food for a party.

These taste like baked mozzarella sticks!  I made these last minute and had to thaw the ravioli in some hot water.  The egg wash makes them bake crispy.  My kids and husband LOVED them.  These would be a fun party favor with some marinara for dipping sauce.  My husband already asked for me to make them again.

These were okay.  I used a whole egg for the egg wash.  They puffed up quite a bit and some went hollow inside, but that might as much the fault of the ravioli as the baking.  Interesting finger food though.

They were good for what they are. Yes they are a bit dry- but we would rather have that than a greasy one. Besides a dipping sauce makes all the difference! We tried with alfredo & a meat maranira & prefer the meat sauce. Thanks for the 'lighter' version of this great pasta dish. Did turn mine as another reviewer sugg. & they came out crisp & delish!

They were a bit dry and the breading didn't stick well to one of he types of ravioli I used, but I still liked it. They'd make a great side dish.

These were good, but I tweaked the recipe a little bit.  I added garlic powder and salt to the breadcrumb mixture and used 1 tbsp. of Italian seasoning instead of just oregano and basil.  Also, I used a whole egg and 2 tbsp. of milk instead of water. (Personal preference)  Finally, I used whole grain bread crumbs and also some panko bread crumbs.  The combination coated the ravioli completely and added more crunch.  Immediately after taking out of the oven I sprinkled them with more freshly grated parmesan cheese and lightly salted them.  They were not bland at all.  With these changes, they were delicious.

great alternative to the fried ones.  I had to eat them fast though as they started to get really tough as they cooled.

So good! Used panko bread crumbs because that is what I had on hand.

So I totally didnt follow the recipe but I used it as a guide. I used a package of artichoke & Cheese Ravioli from Trader Joe's, whole wheat bread crumbs with garlic salt and italian seasoning added, and 2 eggs with a splash of milk. I dipped the ravioli in the eggs, dipped in bread crumb mix and then re-dipped in egg and bread mixture. I oiled a baking sheet with EVOO and let it warm up in the oven (400F) for a minute, pulled it out placed the ravioli on sheet and baked for 20 mins. YUM YUM

I liked this method a lot but did as many of the reviewers said and ramped up the seasonings and used flour first.  Next time I'll leave off the flour and just use an Italian seasoning blend (increasing original seasoning amount) and putting more than double the Parm for flavor.  I really liked the method, though, and my kids enjoyed it.

I love Italian food, and was anxious to try this. It's kind of a lot of work, and the result was too dry for my tastes. The seasonings didn't add all that much flavor either.

With all of the other great reviews, I have to believe we bought the wrong kind of ravioli because the cheese inside was dry, like ricotta. Used panko bread crumbs and followed the rest of the recipe exact. I will try again with a different brand/cheese filling because everything else  worked as I had expected and the breading is good! Thanks for sharing!

I used both cheese ravioli and beef ravioli to make this. I used the whole egg instead of just the white. I did not really like these. I think that these needed a lot more spices in it. The beef ravioli had a lot more flavor than the cheese ones. But my family really enjoyed it though so maybe its just me. I will make them again for the family.

I had made these before where the recipe called for dipping the raviolis in melted butter instead of egg whites/water so I mixed some melted butter in with the egg white/water.    I placed them directly onto a cookie sheet and they came out perfectly crisp and golden without flipping them.

Excellent!   Fresh Parmigiano Reggiano cheese is the only cheese to use.   Use olive oil and flick on Ravioli with brush.   Put olive oil on grate.   Increase egg whites as needed.   We used refrigerated assorted ravioli flavors.  Watch for golden hue then complete.   Serve with Mayo mixed with gochujang sauce.

Made as written and really liked it.  The panko bread crumbs sound like a good idea to try.  We like to have them with Italian Salsa that I posted on this site.

Added 1/2tsp Garlic salt as suggested by others.  Mae my own breadcrumbs with some slices of white bread.  I "quick fried" these in some olive oil until they were just browned and then transfered them to the wire rack and finished baking them.  Served them with some warm Marinara on the side for dipping..hubby loved them :o)

This was so good that we made it two times in one week. Used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and added additional seasonings for more flavor. Used a ground beef ravioli and dipped it in a four cheese store bought marinara. This was just as good as the ones I have had in restaurants and probably healthier because it was baked. Will absolutely make again!

This was ok. I was overall not impressed, however if I were to make it again, I would use some different raviolis than cheese (like spinach artichoke or sun-dried tomato feta). I would make sure to take them out of the oven as early as possible, so there is a little give in each bite. I did season the breading mixture which was a good idea. I think the grated parm kind of cheapened the flavor.   We did eat them, but really wasn't for me.

I love these!  I used to live near a store that had a frozen version of these and have not been able to find them after I moved away but they are even better homemade.  It gives the ravioli good flavor and a nice texture.  Like other reviewers I went ahead and used the whole egg and just used italian bread crumbs with a little parmesan added.

These were just ok, I think the next time I'll deep fry them. I think that the taste was not as good baked vs. fried. I know that I should stick to healthy, but this one just needed to take a bath in hot oil!!

Great idea, bad execution on my end. I'm not sure if it was because I used butternut squash ravioli but I think I should have cooked the ravioli first as the result was way to crunchy and barely cooked. Will try again and update.

Breading the ravioli made it very dry. I think what works about breaded chicken is that it's more often fried than oven-roasted; thus retaining it's moisture. Also, be sure to thaw your ravioli if it is frozen and not refrigerated. Overall it was alright but I probably wouldn't make it again.

Easy and fun to make.  This recipie delivers delicious, crunchy pasta bites and full flavour served with a tasty bolonese and some extra grated Parmesan on top.  I used heaping teaspoons of basil and oregano which added some extra punch.  Make sure you allow for liberal amounts of sauce because some ravioli can be a little bit dry.  Next time I’m going to add a teaspoon of garlic powder for the perfect dish.

Pretty darn good!! What a quick, yummy appetizer for both kids and adults to enjoy. I followed the recipe but used the entire whipped egg vs just the egg white. I used panko bread crumbs and added some additional dried garlic to the break crumb mix.  Delish!!

Very tasty, but probably very fattening.

This recipe was super helpful! I made two servings of ravioli and used seasoned breadcrumbs instead of bread crumbs with the other spices added in. These could have used a hint of salt, but otherwise were delicious.

I compared several recipes for these toasted raviolis and some said to precook the raviolis, and some (including this recipe) did not.  I did not precook the raviolis and they were so tough my kids could not bite through them.  So disappointed that these didn't turn out, especially since it was a little but time consuming to prepare these.  Next time I will precook them and hopefully they will be as delicious as everyone else said they were.

I used Italian bread crumbs. I also toasted the breadcrumbs before coating--it made the raviolis a little crunchier. I sprayed the cookie tray first, then sprayed the tops of the raviolis.  We will definitely do these again!

I made this for the hubby and I and we both loved it! Totally kicked our boring store bought ravioli up several notches. Thanks for the recipe!

These were rather simple to make, I made them with seasoned bread crumbs and added garlic powder but it still needs more seasoning... I didn't have a wire rack so i used tin foil instead and it worked good, they were nice and crispy. I put them in for about 22 minutes. I used Hunt's thick and rich Spicy red pepper and chili to dip them in and it gave it a great flavor that it needed. If i were to make them again I would just try season the crumbs more and give them alittle less time

The flavor of the bread crumbs with the parmesan and spices was good, but rest of it was dreadful. I don't recommend this recipe. I made it exactly as it calls for and it was just too dry. They were beautiful to look at, golden brown and crispy, but the inside was so dry as it was on the outside.e. I will have to tweak the recipe or cook time.

Honestly, I found these to be pretty bland and tedious to make. I still think the recipe has potential, though. I think a bit of salt would have helped bring forth some of the seasoning. If I made this again it would be halved recipe or bigger raviolis because it took forever to batter an entire bag.

These were not good. And I wonder if it was my fault.  I bought the ravioli that is in the refrigerated section- the gourmet kind.  Not the frozen kind.  I made 2 kinds. Cheese and artichoke. The were so over cooked and dry. I was thinking I should have soaked them in water prior. Lots of work for no pay off. :(

I made this recipe and it came out just as I expected it to. It was great and the raviolis were very crispy. Just took a while to bread each ravioli.

Just tried these with freshly made ravioli (just use gyoza wrappers, it's easy!).  I think I should have cut my baking time (18 mins) or boiled my raviolis before coating them as they were really crispy on the outer edges, like potato chips. As others have mentioned, I used Italian style bread crumbs but no other herbs were added just for simplicity.  But I did use fresh grated Parmesan (a must).  Nice way to get fried flavor without the fat!

Mine turned out very dry and hard. I have made other recipes like this one from this site and I will stick to those.

Awesome! Made these for a football party, they were a big hit. Super easy and tasty. Thinking I might try beef ravioli instead of just cheese. I also love that they're baked not fried.

Fantastic Recipe!  The ravioli are golden brown and crispy, just as if they were fried.  It only takes a small spray of cooking spray to have this effect.  All the taste of fried food without the drippy grease!  Perfect!

This was good - not great.  My kids loved it so that counts for a lot - me?  I was bored.  I used fresh ravioli's that were small - so they were bite size which I was worried about - but I think that it turned out good anyway.  I will most likely make again and do more spices or something.
