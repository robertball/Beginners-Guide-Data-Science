This recipe is great for three reasons!  1. All of the vegetables/beans, I got them all ready prepared from the grocery salad bar.  2.It tastes so wonderful very fresh and satisfying.  3. It's cheaper than buying a deli salad.
It is a great potluck dish, or light lunch.

I was looking for a nice couscous salad recipe and although I didn't have a lot of what is required here, I used some couscous I had already cooked, added the dressing and some veggies, cilantro, and voila!  A very nice couscous salad!

I've been to Morocco and this recipe reminded me of the couscous I had eaten there.  It is wonderful!

This is good, and I've been eating it all week for lunch. However, it's probably not something I will make again. Perhaps there's just too much green onion & cilantro and not enough sweetness for my tastes.

Sorry, lovely though this salad was, the taste did not appeal to me.
