The last time I had venison, I didn't like it, my mother fried it.  Last night I tried this receipe with sliced garlic, olive oil, lots of sliced mushrooms and green beans with potatoe, carrots and celery.  I cooked it slowly in a large cast iron dutch oven, and the stew completely dis-appeared.  We loved it.  Can't wait to make another batch.

There was no gamey flavor at all from the venison. All five of my children actually ate this the night I made it and again for leftovers!

I don't own a slow cooker but was looking for a beef stew recipe without a tomato base. I settled on this one because it looked quite easy. I followed this recipe as closely as I possibly could. After browning the beef mixture I tossed it into a pressure cooker for about 45 minutes with my carrots and the bouillon water. After that, I took some of the "stock" from the pressure cooker and mixed in the flour then I poured everything into a normal saucepan (on the stove), added the potatoes, celery, I put in a little garlic and a sprinkle of cayenne for some heat. It was delicious! Thanks for sharing your recipe.

We don't eat red meat, so this was a pretty heavy dose for us, especially after we eat the leftovers tomorrow. But it was a good and easy stew, and my kids (3 and 4) liked the meat.

It was great. I had to make several modifications due to dietary restrictions. Used almond flour. No bouillion (boxed beef broth/stock instead) no potatoes and no onions. Delish.

This was very easy to make. The only seasoning came from the bouillon cubes, so I tasted it about halfway through and added some salt and pepper. You could make this with beef or lamb as well. I used an electric kitchen kettle because my crock pot was not big enough for the amount of meat I had. Oh, and a trick I'd learned from my dad, was to soak the venison overnight in vinegar and water and rinse well the next day to make sure there's no gamey taste. I did that with this recipe so I'm not sure if it was that, or the recipe, but there was no gamey taste at all. Served it over rice. Husband thought this was a great dinner, so will definitely make again. I only gave 4 stars because of the lack of seasoning. Served it over rice and husband LOVED it!
