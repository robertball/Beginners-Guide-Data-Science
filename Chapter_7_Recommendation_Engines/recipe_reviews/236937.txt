This is the best and most authentic  capirotada recipe EVER, but I did alter it a  bit to suit my family’s preferences.  I added: 

2 large peeled, sliced apples, golden delicious 
2 cups of pitted prunes (whole) 
2 cups water

I also substituted coarsely chopped pecans for the peanuts. 

According to your family tradition, some people add bananas, coconut, pineapple, etc.  My family prefers my rendition, but you can make it to suit your family’s likes/dislikes.
