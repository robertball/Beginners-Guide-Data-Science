This actually works.  Good way to avoid buying caramel topping.  My only changes are - didn't use Italian bread (I put my bread heels in the freezer so I can cook things like bread pudding once a month), I cut the sugar in the pudding to only 2/3 a cup and added two diced apples, and I presoaked the apples in the rum.

I made this twice this week, the first time I burnt the caramel and made it with out it. The pudding was so good I made it again and didn't burn the caramel. I used 3 day old dry Italian loaf on the first one and it soaked up the egg mixture very well and was a very moist and flavorful result. The 2nd one was not as old and crustier and didn't soak up the egg as well giving a drier result. Both times I had more then half the egg mixture left over so the next time I make this and I will make it again I am going to cut the measurements on the egg mixture. So very good!

I was scared to use so many eggs! but this is my favorite bread pudding now - seriously the best I've ever made!! I followed the recipe completely - except for adding a teaspoon of cinnamon. It slid out of the baking dish like a flan - and even looked like a flan to our amazement. Next time, I'll add butter and vanilla extract to the caramel to give it a bit more creaminess. Outside of that, I wouldn't change a thing. Oh, except for adding more sugar to combat the egg flavor.

I changed VERY little (added soaked Craisins and cinnamon, vanilla to the caramel sauce) and this recipe is absolutely delicious! I wouldn't change anything else...can't rave enough...pick this recipe above the others - trust me!

I adapted the recipe a lot to make a dairy free  desert.  I used 5 heaping cups of fresh whole grain crumbled bread, & being uncertain how many cups of bread there would be in the Italian loaf,  I added 2 more eggs, 1 teaspoon more vanilla,  1 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/4 C more rum, 1/2 C more raw sugar, 4 C Silk vanilla soy milk  instead of milk or cream, and currants. This large quantity took forever to bake, but the family loves the pudding, and they are a fussy bunch.

Very good recipe,  I added a teaspoon of cinnamon and replaced the spiced rum with fireball,
            (do to on hand availability :) ) 
I cheated and bought some caramelized pecans to go with some caramel sause, like smuckers, found with the hot fudge in grocery stores, Added the perfect topping with vanilla ice.  cream.

First time I've ever made a bread pudding and it was FABULOUS. I could not find an Italian loaf to save my life so I used a French loaf. And I added a tsp of vanilla extract to the caramel sauce while cooking it. So good!

Made this for my Husband for Father's Day.....my whole family loved it and the couple of fork fulls I allowed myself were so worth it :)  I added two teaspoons of cinnamon to the egg mixture.  I also did not make the Caramel Sauce, as I found Smucker's Special Recipe Butterscotch Caramel Flavored Topping and i used that.  My husband loves Butterscotch and I thinned it out a little with about 2 tablespoons of rum to a half cut of topping.  then I just poured it over the whole thing.  Served it with Ice Cream too.....yes that's how bad we got this past weekend.

My first time making bread pudding. It was delicious! I doubled the caramel and put half on the bottom of the pan and swirled some into the bread pudding.
