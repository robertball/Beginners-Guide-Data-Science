This is delicious.  If you use a flank steak and let it rest for a few minutes after cooking, then slice it against the grain, it will be tender and juicy. Definitely serve the wasabi sauce on the side, though, 'cause it's not for everybody...very sinus clearing! but delicious if you don't mind that.

The wasabi adds a great touch! I had wasabi paste, so I mixed that with the vinegar until it had the correct consistency. We dipped pieces of steak into the wasabi, rather than pouring it on top, since it's so spicy.

This was very good!  It was a little chewy, but I used a london broil.  I scored it and it was chewy anyway.  

The only changes I made were to boil and reduce the marinade for a glaze to pour over the sliced meat.  The marinade is too good to be thrown out.  It makes a wonderful glaze.  I used the wasabi too, but not for the meat.  I made the wasabi and added it to my mashed potatoes (skin-on, red potatoes from my garden).  I love wasabe mashed potatoes! It was wonderful for a side dish!  For my second side dish, I sauteed squash and spinach from my garden in a mix of EVOO and sesame oil, then tossed it with a little bit of the glaze.  

A very healthy, flavorful summer meal!  Me and my foodie hubby give this recipe two thumbs up!

The meat was good although it was quite chewey.  I should have scored it before marinading it as I normally do.  The Wasabi sauce was delicious!  Thanks submitter.

Extremely good. The only changes i made were improvisations. First off i did not have roasted garilc rice vinegar so i used regular and the roasted  about 6 cloves in the oven. Other than that i did not have hot chili oil. Instead i usred chile piquin and chipolte chili owered to create my own oil. i also did not have wasabi but this recipe does not really need it!

I thought this recipe was amazing... I only made one little change, I didnt add the ginger, because im not a huge fan of ginger...but other than that, I followed everything else exactly and it was awesome! A HUGE hit in my household and certainly no left overs!!!

I somehow left out the soysauce so it was mainly a vinegar-based marinade, but he steak still turned out well! I was afraid it would be too tart and not taste good, but it was OK. Will need to try this again the right way next time.
