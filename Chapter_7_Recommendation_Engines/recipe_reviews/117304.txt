My husband is not always a "vegetable" person and he loved this!  I didn't have canned tomatoes or the paste but I did have plenty of fresh tomatoes so I just diced them with a little extra and it turned out just fine.  I prefer fresh over canned anyway so I'm going to continue to cook with the fresh.

This recipe is great! I had a "pastaless" ratatouille recipe from a vegetarian friend of mine that I had lost and this was just as delicious as I remembered hers to be. With the added pasta it made a very nice main dish. I remember that hers also had mushrooms & black olives, so I added those 2 items and the flavors were perfect with this recipe. I also used fresh grated parmesan intead.

Very fresh and healthy. Just a tip for those who don't want to waste a whole can of tomato paste, put your left over tomato in baggies and freeze.  When you're ready to use again, just pop into a bowl and microwave for about 20 seconds.

We made this after seeing the movie Ratatouille, and the kids LOVED it!  In fact, I froze 1/2 of the recipe and had it a month later.  Freezes very well.

I added some kalamata olives and used fresh basil, oregano and 4 cloves of garlic instead of garlic powder.  This is a a good, simple ratatouille which I'll make again.

This was very good!  I made this with a medium sized eggplant and 2 medium zucchini.  I added about 6 mushrooms.  I used 6 oz. penne pasta.  I had 1 can of the fire roasted tomatoes and added about 1/3 jar of pasta sauce since I didn't have any paste.  I stirred the cooked pasta into the veggie mixture and put into 9x13 dish. It filled it up!  I put the mozz. cheese on top and some parmesan.  Then I took about a 1/2 cup of italian bread crumbs, melted a tablespoon or so margarine in them, stirred and topped the casserole.  Watch it so it doesn't burn.  If you have other things to prepare just put it in a 350 oven until everything else is ready.  Delcious, kids loved it. Serves more like 6 adults or 8 with kids.

This stuff is awesome...and healthy! I toss in some bell peppers and use goat cheese instead of mozzarella....gives a nice zing contrast to the acidity of the veggies.  Also, my host mom in Spain would make this and season only with olive oil, garlic (lots of both...!), sugar and salt.  No basil, no oregano, nothing.  Play around with this recipe...it's worth it.

This is a good recipe and pretty easy to throw together after a long day at work.  To me, it seems to make 4 servings rather than 3.  Like the previous reviewer suggested, I did use 2 cloves of minced fresh garlic.  The sauteeing took about 8 minutes, during which I had to add a couple of tablespoons of EVOO.  Next time, I will use a scant 2 cups each of egg plant & zuchinni and also season the dish with salt and pepper in addition to the other seasonings.  I used Muir Glenn organic fire roasted diced tomatoes and I think that brought great flavor to the dish.  Oh yes, and to make clean up super easy, we just sprinkled parmesean cheese on top on each dish.  I also used regular spaghetti pasta noodles.

This was delicious!  My whole family (even my kids) loved it!  I used an all-natural marinara sauce in place of the tomatoes and seasoning.  I also added ground beef.  When sauteing the vegetables, I added fresh garlic, salt, pepper, and italian seasoning.   Left off the mozzarella and just sprinkled with parmesan.  Will make again and again.  Such a nice change from plain old spaghetti.

This is a lovely light recipe for when you want something tasty but not necessarily meaty. The only chage I make is to use fresh garlic. The ratatouille is also a lovely side dish with grilled chicken / meat. I personally still prefer it with pasta, especially penne. Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious and filling.  Even my carnivore husband liked it.  I made some minor alterations by doubling the spices and sauteing some minced garlic in with the veggies because my family LOVES spice and garlic, but otherwise I stayed true to the recipe.  It was very tasty and I loved the chunky sauce.  Just a note on the eggplant...Buy a small one.  I ended up with way too much leftover eggplant.

The combination of eggplant, tomato (whether you use fresh or canned as this recipe calls for--I used fresh), and zucchini is wonderful.  (Onion optional.)  However, the pasta needs to be completely covered in this sauce; otherwise it is somewhat dry and boring.  I'd suggest setting aside some tomatos or sauce and cooking it separately, using it to coat ALL of the pasta before pouring the rest of the vegetables on top.

Excellent. I made this recipe a few times this past summer to get rid of some extra vegetables from the garden. I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned and didn't use all that mozzeralle cheese. Excellent recipe.

Yummy and pretty quick lunch when you dont want any meat. I served it with crusty bread and herbed olive oil for dessert cream soda. Very filling meal. Thanks for the post.

Oh my goodness, I tried this because someone gave me eggplant and I didn't know what to do with it! I have to say, this was one of the best randomly found recipes I've ever found! Will be hunting down fresh eggplant so that I can make this again and again!

This turned out well!  A great way to make it a vegetarian night.  I wish I would have sauteed the vegetables a bit more because it took quite a while for the vegetables (eggplant and zucchini) to cook thoroughly. I didn't have garlic powder so I used 3 cloves (I love garlic).  My daughter also has a milk protein allergy so I used goat milk mozzarella cheese instead.

I love pasta cheese anything, but adding healthy veggies to that is great! I never knew about 'sweating' squash, but it really did the trick! Not mushy at all, just delicious.

I bought a large eggplant to make eggplant parmesan but then wasn't sure what to do with the amount remaining...this recipe worked perfectly.  I did cube the eggplant and yellow squash into approximately the same size pieces, used sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, diced sweet red bell pepper, and quartered roma tomatoes from this year's garden. Used a few squirts of ketchup instead of tomato paste because I didn't want to open a can... The other addition I made was halved black and green olives.  This is a great way to use a variety of leftover veggies and with the pasta and cheese made a very filling meal even for a non-vegetarian.

I always start by making recipes here exactly as shown, otherwise how can you rate it properly?  I made this for my kids and they both loved it.  A great, healthier alternative to plain old spaghetti sauce.  Thanks for the recipe, its a keeper in our house!

This was good!  I followed the recipe but at the last second decided to use a tomato basil spaghetti sauce instead of the canned tomatoes & paste.  I added the extra spices too.  I also had to use spaghetti instead of spiral pasta.  I really liked it, so did my husband.  Kids ate it with some threatening - but that is par for course.  Will definitely make again.  OH - and I love what salting the veggies did - but note that next time I will cut my eggplant a little larger.

I followed this recipe loosely with great results.  I doubled the diced tomatoes and left out the paste.  I used fresh herbs instead of dried.  I let it cook for a while so the flavors would meld.  I made an entire pound of pasta and spooned the mixture on top instead of baking it.  I topped it with Romano.  THE RESULTS WERE DELICIOUS!  Thanks for a great starting point!

Delicious!!  I made this recipe exactly as written except for the end.  I didn't add cheese and broil, because of dairy allergies in my family.  It was so flavorful and healthy and a great way to use tasty summer vegetables.  Thank you for sharing!

This is a great alternative to traditional ratatouille, which requires baking. Now that it's summer, zucchini and eggplant are in season but it's too hot for the oven! We added sweet peppers and spinach. Also mixed in ricotta instead of mozzarella and didn't broil it, which made for a creamy texture.

This was delicious! My boyfriend and one-year old son gobbled it up. I didn't make any modifications, and I thought it came out great. I'll definitely be making this regularly.

This was yummy! I used linguini noodles and used fresh tomatoes (peeled & diced). Awesome recipe, thanks.

I absolutely love this recipe! I usually add summer squash as well since it is a personal favorite.  Add a little chili powder to heat things up a bit!

Easy, quick, delicious. 

Made this with fire roasted diced tomatoes and extra dried basil and it was amazing!

Comprehensive prep time is slightly longer than indicated as you need to account for the 30 minutes to sweat the zucchini and eggplant.

Will be making this often!

I made this tonight and it was great. I did substitute yellow squash for zucchini and left out the tomatoe paste because I did not want to open a can for such a small amount. I left the onions out as well using onion powder (too many small children eating it)

Wow!  I can't believe how yummy this dish turned out!  I quadrupled the recipe and served it at my church's monthly fellowship dinner.  Big hit!  The melding of the flavors is absolutely awesome.  Thanks for submitting this recipe.  I'll be using it regularly!

Quick and easy as I skipped pre-salting the eggplant.  Used real garlic and added 1/2 cup diced bell peppers. Very tasty over penne pasta.

Great and very hearty meal! I doubled the servings to 6 and just needed to use a very large skillet and then a baking pan for the broil at the end.  I also slightly increased the amount of olive oil for sauteeing the veggies.

This was very good. My son loves eggplant and I was trying to find a new way to get him to eat it instead of the traditional parmasean. It was wonderful tasting and very easy to make. The only thing I would do different is, I would combime the ratatouille with the pasta and then top with the cheese and bake. Also I would use crushed tomatoes instead if diced only because I like my sauce with some body and I thought it was to watery done as the recipe called for.  As most left overs, it's better the 2nd day. I add a little spaghetti sauce to it though, it was a little dry the next day.  I would difinetly make it again.

We LOVED it! We didn't have it over pasta, yet, but we will later, as a leftover. I would say it made a lot more than 3 servings or else we just had big veggies and had to use a larger baking dish. But, that was fine because it is so yummy and healthy. I didn't peel the eggplant because we enjoy it with the peel. Will definitely make again!

This recipe is AWESOME. I love ratatouille and this really hit the spot. Way to make it into a meal using the spiral pasta. It's healthy and delicious. The only thing I would change is to use fresh basil if it is available. Thanks!

I'm just learning to cook and this is by far the best dish I have made so far! My family wigged out when they tried it. My five year old son actually ate vegtables!I think he was more excited about the fact that is he was eating the dish his favorite movie was named for, but who cares why he ate them, the point is he ate them!
Thanks!!

Great vegetarian recipe.  Made plenty of 4 people.  I used jarred spaghetti sauce to thicken the sauce a little more.  Added more garlic to spice it up too.

It definitely tasted good, but it tasted like a North American version of a french dish (my husband, who lived in France, gave the verdict on it). Great way to start introducing your family to different cuisine though.

I made this all summer long with vegetables from my garden.  I could eat it everyday!  I am so sad that summer is over.  Can't wait for next year.  Sometimes I added chicken thighs, cut into cubes and sauteed.  But it's great either way.

Well... I made it in honor of the movie.  Didn't realize I was making a veggie dish for a bunch of folks who don't like veggies.  Seemed like it would be a good base for a soup, but then again, what do I know?  We ordered pizza instead.

I used parmesan instead of mozzarella, and obviously a lot less, like only a quarter cup. I also used what I had - a can of stewed tomatoes with bell peppers and onions. This turned out very good and I was glad that I had peeled the eggplant. It was quick and easy. I would definitely make it again.

I had never tried eggplant or zucchini before this dish but we had bought some on sale and decided to try out the vegetables for this particular dish. The seasoning was perfect and the vegetables were tender and wonderful. I would certainly recommend it.

This is one of my family's all-time favorite dinners. As suggested by others, the only change we make is substituting fresh parmesan cheese. Thank you for a family favorite!

I love my veggies but I love my meat as well. Ground sausage makes this dish heavenly. 
Here are my modifications. Make the recipe as directed. Saute ground sausage in a skillet while the eggplant sauce is simmering. When brown, add sausage to the sauce. Absolutely amazing!!!

I made this dish for my girlfriend and myself. We loved it, it's relatively easy to make and gets some vegetables in your meal.
