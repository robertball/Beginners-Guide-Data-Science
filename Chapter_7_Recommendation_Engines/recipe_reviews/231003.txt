Delicious recipe! I used veggie stock rather than chicken stock but other than that I didn't make changes to the ingredients. To get really get all the flavor out of your saffron (for this many other recipes that call for both saffron and milk), I recommend dry roasting it for a few minutes in a pan and then crushing it with mortar and pestle. Add the milk to that bowl and mix until all the saffron is incorporated and the milk turns to that gorgeous golden yellow. Then, add that milk to your potatoes. This is a great twist on your usual mashed potatoes, next time I'll even try it with sweet potatoes. Thanks for sharing!

One pound of potatoes wasn’t going to be enough for our family of 6, so I doubled the potatoes and all ingredients except the stock.  There was still enough stock for that many potatoes, which I peeled and quartered.  These were simple and tasty potatoes,  but I’m not sure I’ll make them again.  To make enough for my family, it took an entire jar of saffron from Costco, and saffron is an expensive spice.

I used this recipe for my first time using genuine saffron. The potatoes turned out great, I added some of the stock when I mashed them. It smoothed them out and added a little extra flavor.

Used purple potatoes instead of Yukon, and it was quite yummy!  However, I did have to add a little more milk while mashing the potatoes, since they were still a little too thick for the food processor to handle
