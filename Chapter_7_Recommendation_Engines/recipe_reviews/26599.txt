I gave 4 stars because I have been making this casserole for years..but with a few changes that I think make it a 5 star.  I never mix all the ingredients up together!..drizzle tomato paste around the meat, around the sourcream which is combined with cottage cheese.  
I use fresh diced onions, one finely chopped garlic, 1-2 Tbsp. gebhart's chili powder, 1 tsp. cumin power, and add it into the browning beef.   Use one small can of tomatoe paste with added water to make into a thick sauce.  Cottage cheese instead of ricotta and mixed shredded mexican cheeses, 1 small can sliced black olives.  I drizzle the tomato sauce over the meat in the casserole, two layers only and add slices of jalepino and the shredded cheese to the top layer.  I omitted the green chilis and if I do sometimes add them I add only one small drained can.  This is one of my husbands favorite dishes.  Arranging your ingredients in layers, the sourcream and cottage cheese should be dropped in little clumps is the best way to make this dish appealing and tasty.  Useing unsalted chips is also nice and keeps the salt intake down..you can always add salt later.

This has always been a family favorite in my house. We have a few variations you can try to kick it up a notch. Use crushed Doritos (Nacho cheese or Fiery Habenero) as your base layer. Substitute cottage cheese for the ricotta. I like my dishes meaty so you can up the amount of beef to 1 1/2 lbs. We only use 1 can of diced green chiles and we don't use onions. We also add 1 tsp of chili powder to flavor the meat  along with the garlic salt. It's always an easy dish for company. I never seem to use the entire cream mix because it can make it soupy at times. Serve with Mexican Rice!

The Riccotta Cheese just didn't work with the Mexican ingredients. But I had to give it a try. Sorry...

Hubby really enjoyed this.  Told me it was a keeper.  He's not one to say much about anything i cook, so he must have liked it pretty well.

Yuck!  We thought this was awful.  I made this because it used many of the things I had in the house already but will not be making it again.

I thought this dish was average. My husband thought this tasted similar to an enchilada because of the corn taste from the tortilla chips. I wonder if using enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce would make this dish more interesting.

There are no leftovers with this recipe unless I make a double batch!  I have been able to easily convert it to vegetarian for my son's family and even my grandson loved it when he was only 18 months old.  Fantastic!!

Very good and easy. I did enjoy this but felt it was more like a dip and I should be dunking my tortilla's and scooping rather than eating like a casserole. Changes I made were, I used ground chicken, only one can of green chilies and baked chips.

My gramma used to make this all the time, though with slight changes! Her variation: 1.5 pounds of ground beef, use a whole chopped onion instead of the minced and cook with the beef, 1 teaspoon garlic powder (not salt), 3 cans of tomato sauce, and add a package of taco seasoning to the beef/olive mix. Then just put a layer of the crushed chips, the beef mixture, then mix 1.5 cups of cottage cheese with the green chilis and spread that over the top and sprinkle with cheese (leaving out the sour cream).  I make this in two 8x8 pans and freeze one before baking. It works great.  Just thaw and bake as directed. The chips won't be so crunchy, so I just sprinkle more on top when it comes out of the oven.

I've made this casserole for years and years but we've always made it with cottage cheese instead of the ricotta cheese.  Ricotta cheese tends to have a stronger flavor which a lot of people shy away from.  Try it with cottage cheese!  It's great!

I would have given it 3 stars, because I thought it was pretty good, but not great.  But everyone else really liked it.  The only things I did differently is used fresh onions (more than what was called for), and about half of the olives.  Thanks for sharing.

The flavor was ok, but the texture was weird and when you cut into it, it did not look very appetizing either.

I'm sorry but we just did not like this.  There were too many green chile peppers in it and the texture was strange.

This was awesome! My husband was so excited to eat it again for left overs. I used 1/2 c. of fresh onion instead of minced and made it a little healthier by using ground turkey, fat free sour cream and fat free cottage cheese instead of ricotta. I will most definitely be making this again!

HEY this is pretty good! My husband and I loved it immensely. We didnt have any jack cheese, so we didnt add any cheese at all (aside from the ricotta). There is no need to butter the casserole dish. Just add the ingredients.

This was pretty good.  I changed the recipe a little and added 1/2 diced tomatoes and 1/2 tomato sauce instead of all tomato sauce.  I also used a little less olives and split the monteray jack cheese with some pizza cheese.  However, next time I am going to remember to put TACO SEASONING on the meat as that seemed to be the worst part, bland and dry.  And for a little extra kick I am switching one of the green peppers for jalepeno's.  I think with those few little tweeks this could be a very good dinner.  Very close to other taco casserole's I have had in the past, but I like that the sour cream is right in it.  Also, this is VERY easy to prepare with a 7 year old, 2 year old and 1 year old at foot, I still managed to not burn myself and have dinner come out good.

I added a can of refried beans to the bottom layer, and took out the tomato sauce and ricotta. What's left.....it is a giant taco. That's right all this effor just leads to a giant baked taco. It tasted fine, but tacos are fast and easy this was ridiculous. Who wants tomato sauce and ricotta cheese on their taco.....ewwww.

Hmm..  I hate to give bad reviews, but I just did not like this.  The looks of it I could get past, but something about the texture just really turned me off.  The kids wouldnt touch it, but my husband liked it.  I swear, he likes anything that I dont though.  LOL  Little bland, and I wish I could put a term to the texture, but I cant.

This was really good, although I did change a couple of things.  I used a can of diced tomatoes with chipotle chilies instead of tomato sauce & used cottage cheese instead of ricotta, just a personal preference for us.  This could definitely be a dip.  It wasn't the prettiest thing I've ever seen and certainly didn't look like the picture, but it tasted very good!

meh--not that great.  For it to be a good recipe you'd basically have to alter the whole thing. First, sub something else for the tomato sauce-then add some more spices to the meat, and that's just a start!

My 15 month old twins, my 4 year old, and my husband all loved it!!  I used protein crumbles to cut the fat and fat free sour cream and cheese.  Next time, I am not going to put the chips on it b/c I don't like the way they baked on top.

I agree it is a bland recipe.  But its a great base and you can "tweak it" and make it better. I did the same as someone else(forgot who did it) but I used fresh jalapenos and mexican style cheese. that did help it to liven up some.  Its worth making, I just think its going to be one of those that your individual tastes will have to dictate a few changes.

Have made several times, but with the following changes as it is pretty bland...
Used only 1 can chilies, but added almost a full can of chopped jalapenos.  Also use Mexican blend shredded cheese.

Easy to make, inexpensive, freezes and reheats well and very tasty. What more could I ask for? I'll be making this one again!

My whole family liked this.  I made it exactly as written, except I crushed some chips on top of each helping right before serving, just to add some crunch.  We thought it was delicious.  It was definitely nothing I would serve for company, but for a casual dinner at home for the family, it was just right.  Thank you.

The only complaint I have about this recipe is that it's a little bland for our taste.  We doused ours with hot sauce and fixed it right up, though!  :o)  Next time, I will add some more seasonings to the tomato mixture.  Other than that, it's great!  By the way, I subbed TVP for the ground beef (1 cup TVP reconstituted in 7/8 cup boiling beef broth), and it worked really well.

This was a good change from the usual.  It's like a mixture of enchiladas and lasagna.  My husband took the leftovers to work for lunch and all his co-workers wanted the recipe.  It's worth a try!

My family has been making this casserole for years with some minor changes. I use about 1/4 cup of freshly minced onion, and about 1-2 minced garlic cloves along with about 3/4 teaspoon of salt. Instead of the ricotta cheese, I use cottage cheese.
It's always a favorite in my family. And disappears quickly at potlucks with friends and coworkers asking for the recipe!

I added different kinds of Mexican seasoning. I added a can of refried beans to the meat mixture as well as some bell pepper, garlic, and onions. Instead of chillies I added jalapeños on top. It tasted great. I made this again and mixed the chilies in with the sour cream and cottage cheese mixture this time and topped it with black olives. I think it turned out better.

I have been making this so many years! It is a family staple. I do substitute the ricotta cheese with cottage and I use a whole bag of Fritos Scoops. It is such a yummy dish and will always remind me of childhood.

Made it for my family and everyone loved it.  My youngest, who is my pickiest, ate every last morsel on his plate.  although i made my own alterations to it.  i used salsa instead of tomato sauce .  diced up real onions and a green pepper.  I also added some minced garlic instead of garlic salt.  Also next time i will not add cottage cheese i used instead of ricotta.  Was not sure how it would turn out and think it would be better without it altogether.

My 20 month old and my husband loved this. I omitted the olives and it still turned out great. A definite keeper.

I didnt care for this too much. I think chicken would be a lot better than beef for this casserole. I did really like the ricotta cheese, sour cream, and green chile combination. That was great.
