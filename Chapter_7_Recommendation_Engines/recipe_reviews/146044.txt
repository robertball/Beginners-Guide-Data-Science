Sometimes I don't understand the ratings on this site at all.  This recipe is a case in point.  Agree with the reviewer who said he didn't like the taste or texture of the ground pork.  Simple vegetarian Ratatouille is much better.  Call this something else.

CREATOR'S COMMENTS: When I make this dish I do not crumble the ground pork; I make semi-rough meatballs about 1/2 thumb size. That way not every bite has pork in it. Also, I have found that using Ritz brand crackers makes a better "crust" with the cheeses.

This was delicious! I used Italian Turkey Sausage in place of the ground pork. I also used Garlic and Herb Wheat Thins (Reduced Fat) for the cracker topping. The combo was perfect! This was a complete meal by itself.

I substituted japanese eggplant for the bell peppers and used an ice cube of basil instead of the dried seasonings. Also used Panko breadcrumbs instead of the crackers. I got 6 servings out of it, and served it with some basmatti rice. Very good!

This was absolutely delicious! I made it for company the other night and even my father -- who hates vegetables and tomato dishes -- raved about it. I used reduced fat crackers and omitted the bell pepper due to taste preferences, but it was still great. Spicier than I thought it would be, so I may use a bit less pepper next time.

3 2 14 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/146044/summery-ratatouille/ ... Since the movie "Ratatouille," (yes, I'm one of those) I've tried a few recipes.  I found one I liked today.  :)  I didn't use any meat.  Used 2 green peppers since they were small.  'Not sure how 1 large & 2 medium squash works out, but I put in 4 zucchini.  Also added half an eggplant (a few minutes after the zucchini so the zucchini could release some moisture).  I accidentally added 15 oz sauce with one can of diced toms.  'Added those after everybody else was cooked.  Ha.  'Took the suggestion of adding pasta - 1/4# bowties.  I layered, but don't think I will next time.  'Used about 2c mozzarella & less than one cup parmesan.  'Didn't do the crumbs, just cheese on top.  Kids willingly had some when they saw familiar pasta, but still picked through, but ate.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Note: the heat intensified after day one - probably too hot for most kids.

This was great. In order to make this a complete meal, I added some ziti. I added eggplant because I had one that was about to go bad. I had enough drippings from my italian sausage so I didnt have to use the olive oil. After the vegetables and sausage cooked I heated my cooked ziti and pasta sauce up. I then did the layering. This recipe does take some time because of all the chopping, cooking, stiring, layering, cleaning. But I thought it was worth it. It took me nearly an hour for prep...not 30 minutes like the recipe stated. And by no means am I a slow cooker! Great dish!!

I turned this into a one-pot meal by using an extra large cast iron skillet to cook everything in, then put the whole thing onto the oven! I tried this recipe last night, with a few modifications because of what I had on hand.  I used 1 lb. ground beef + 1/2 lb. sausage in place of the pork, and 1 jar spaghetti sauce in place of the tomatoes, and added some red pepper flakes. The flavor and texture were both really good!  The only thing I didn't like was the crumb topping.  Way to powdery in the mouth.  I scraped it all off before saving the leftovers, but on that note - it reheats perfectly! Next time, I'll reduce the crumbs to 1/2C.  but still use all the cheese. Overall, I'll make this one again!

WOW! Yum!  This was delicious!  I'm so full but I still want more!  I added a little ground sage to the pork and used Ritz vegetable crackers, but other than that I stuck to the recipe.  I never rate immediately after I eat, but this was so good I had to say so.  Thanks for the recipe!

Amazing recipe.  I used a mix of chorizo and italian sausage in place of the ground pork.  I also omitted the layer of mozzarella cheese.  I mixed cracked pepper flavored crackers with a cup of shredded mixed italian cheeses.  It really seemed to be plenty of cheese without the layer of mozz in the middle.  I decided to add eggplant as well.  I will make this again and again for sure.

This is really, really good.  I have made it two times now and although it seems i dirty every mixing bowl in my (limited) kitchen space in the staging and prep phase, it is worth it.  For the topping, I used some stone ground crackers which I crushed (at least I could do that in a freezer bag and not have to find another mixing dish) with some packaged shaved fresh parmesan.

The cracker and cheese topping overwhelmed the dish.  It would have been so much better without it.

Very good, I also did the pork into little meat balls, made it a little more kid friendly! I think the pork could have used some seasoning though, and probably could have done without the cracker crumbs. Other than that, pretty good, even got my 2 anf 4 year old to eat it!

Great stuff!  I modified this to make it a veggie side dish - no pork, no cheese.  Love the veggie combination!  I served with skillet balsamic chicken.

This is one of the best recipes I have tried on here!

It is tasty, and very easy to make! I personally would not modify this recipe in anyway.

This is a very good recipe! I decided to make it after watching the movie "Ratatoille". I chose this one, because my wife doesn't care for eggplant, which traditional Ratatoille uses. The only change I made to the recipe was using pork sausage, rather than ground pork.

I made this last night.  My garden is producing more summer/yellow squash than I can eat.  First let me say my husband LOVED this!  I liked it a lot.  I would decrease the salt amount and pepper.  I found it had too much and I only put in about 3/4 of what it called for.  I also added more mozzarella cheese.  After all can’t have too much cheese.  Also I used canned diced tomatoes that already had spices in it and plain Panko crumbs as I didn’t have any crackers.   So the only reason I gave it 4 stars was I felt there was too much salt and too much pepper!

I used Jimmy  Dean Sausage in place of ground pork. It has more flavor.  Since I did this, I may cut back on the salt some next time.  Also I cut up 2 zucchini since I had them already. I also used 2 bell peppers ( yellow and red). This dish is fantastic!!

Delicious! I served this over thin spaghetti. Instead of canned tomatoes, I used fresh from our garden. Also, I only used 1/2 teaspoon black pepper.  Thank you for sharing.

This was light and delicious. I used the super thin Pane Guttiau parchment crackers from Trader Joe's.  It is not the fanciest meal but it does the job without being crazy greasy or fatty.  My 9 y.o loved it.

My family does not like zucchini or any squashes, but since I made this a couple years ago it has become a family favorite.  I omit the pork and add eggplant.

I was looking for something different to cook for dinner and this was a HIT! I will certainly be making this again and again! I will probably use ground chicken or turkey next time to change it up a little.

Fabulous!  We left out the meat and peppers, but did everything else as the recipe called for.  My husband keeps saying, "A very satisfying meal" and our family gives it 5 thumbs up! Great Recipe!
