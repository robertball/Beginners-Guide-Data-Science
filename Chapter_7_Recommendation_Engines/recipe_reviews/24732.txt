Made this dip on Christmas Eve.  It was delicious.  The only problem I had was there just wasn't enough!  Will be making this one again for sure.

Good, but salty - not sure if it was the brand of cheese or the bacon (I used less bacon than the recipe called for, but it was still quite salty)

Wonderful flavor and so easy to make.
Even friends who normally would avoid anything with blue cheese just loved this dip!

Delicious spread - very flavorful! I kept mine in crockpot at a recent party and it had a tendency to dry out - suggest adding more half & half if you are planning on eating it over the course of an evening.

Even though I don't know if I'll make this again, I had to give it 5 stars.  It proved true to the other reviews - even people who don't like blue cheese liked it.  I immediately tasted the blue cheese, although I made it so I knew it was in there.  However, two other people were surprised when I told them blue cheese was in it.  I served it with thin toasted slices of french bread.  It doesn't make a very large quanity.  But it was enough for a small group.  I must say it was a nice change from all of the typical dips or appetizers.  Thanks!

Thanks Carol for a wonderful recipe.  I made this recipe as directed except I did add four garlic cloves than recommended.  I used Tricuits and toasted french bread with flavor EVOO.  This was very good.  I would definately make this again.  Also, next time I will try the New Rosemary and Cracked Pepper Triscuits.

Yum!  I used a bottle of real bacon pieces instead due to lack of time.  Served with sliced French bread and it was gone in no time.  Very rich and tasty!

This dip was a HUGE hit with my friends at the marina!  The only thing I would do would be to try low sodium bacon next time.  I could taste the blue cheese, but it wasn't overpowering at all.  This disappeared so fast that I only got to taste it once, and everyone asked me to make it again.  If I had doubled the recipe, there wouldn't be any leftovers.

I knew I wouldn't be able to stop eating this, so I scaled the recipe down to two servings, and had it on a couple of small slices of Viennese bread. So delicious! Thanks so much, Carol!

I just served this at a work luncheon and they loved it!  I assembled it last night and baked it here at work.  I think it actually helped the flavors blend.  We served it with many different types of crackers and breads and felt that simple water crackers were best because the flavors were pure.  I have already been asked for the recipe!  Thanks for sharing it.

A HUGE HIT!  This is what my husband refers to as "Saturday Food" (good for football on the couch) and is also one of the few things he has ever raved about after the very first bite.  
One tip - eat in one sitting for best flavor.  While it's still very good reheated from the frig later, the bacon flavor becomes overpowering.
***UPDATE*** Eight years later (2011), this continues to be the recipe every friend and family member ask me to make for every event and get-together.  Recently I said I was too busy to make it for a family party and they joked that I was uninvited.  :(  
Over the years I have learned that you can use whole milk, 1/2 and 1/2, or cream (or any combination of them) and get pretty much the same final product.  I have never changed any other ingredients, as it's perfect as is.  But I do mix up what I serve it with...  the most popular choice seems to be celery sticks.

Even tho I made this for a party tomorrow, I had to review this now because it's so fabulous. Obviously hasn't even been put in the oven, yet, the flavor is already so incredible. I thought I had bacon in the house but did not, so I fried up some taylor ham and it worked. I'm sure I used more blue than stated but that's fine because we love it. For those who commented on the saltiness, just want to let you know that it's most likely coming from the BC. Three tablespoons contains 430 mg. No mind, it's a party right? Thanks a heap Carol!

This recipe is delicious! AND great as it is. Might be a little salty for some people, but if you're looking at a recipe for blue cheese and bacon, you shouldn't kid yourself, haha. BONUS: I took a small portion of my dip and stuffed it in some mushroom caps, baking for 10-15 minutes, AWESOME!

My husband says this a man dip.  Whatever it is...it is amazing.  As the other reviews stated you can't really tell that there is blue cheese in the dip.  There is a very unique, almost smoked rich flavor.  Everyone wanted the recipie!  Don't be afraid to try this one!

Outstanding dip! I thought it was going to be too blue cheesy, but it was perfect. I served it with Pugliese bread cut into chunks. 5 of us demolished it within an hour during a meeting. Yum!

I made this for a dinner club and it was a huge hit!  I didn't find it too salty at all.  I used purchased pre-cooked bacon pieces and minced garlic in a jar and had amazing results!  Everyone loved it, the blue cheese is not overpowering at all.  I recommend making it several hours in advance before baking it, the flavors all become richer.  I made a smaller portion to try it out, and used Maytag Bleu cheese, and found it much to "bleu cheesy" (my husband, who loves bleu cheese liked it), but for the party I used a pre-crumbled blue cheese, and the flavor was much more subdued.  I will definitely make this again!

Took this to a get together and served with the toasted french bread with olive oil as suggested in another review.  It was great then we had some steaks and I tried some of it on the steak and man it was so good! It was gone quickly will make again.

I made this to serve at my son's birthday party.  It was simple to make ahead.  I actually forgot to buy garlic, so I added garlic powder instead.  It was fabulous and disappeared instantly served with warm pitas.  The second time I made it was for a bigger group.  I doubled it, did the real garlic, and used a different brand of blue cheese.  It was MUCH stronger.  If you shy away from a lot of blue cheese, I recommend being prepared to add more cream cheese after you sample the batter.  Overall, absolutely delicious and a big hit.  I plan to keep it in a small crockpot next time I have a big crowd so it can sit out longer.

This is SO yummy!  My grocery store didn't have chives, so I added in a shallot with the garlic.  I think next time I will double the recipe because it went so quickly.  As previous reviewers noted, even people that don't like blue cheese will like this dip.  I served it with baguette slices, brushed with olive oil and toasted.  All turned out perfectly!  Great recipe!

This is SO good!  A real treat for the blue cheese lover.  I had to make some slight changes based on what I had.  I only used 4 slices of bacon, and it seemed to be enough (it would be great with 7 too, I'm sure) and I used fat-free half and half.  I added slightly more blue cheese because I just wanted to use it up.  It was so good and very flavorful!  I made it yesterday and refrigerated overnight and then baked it today.  It was a little clumpy-looking, but that's probably due to the fat-free half and half and refrigeration.  It still tasted great!  Served with sliced Italian Bread.

I liked it. Also good on steaks!  Teenage kids did not care for it.  Also good on french bread, triscuits, etc.  (Kyle claimed he could still taste the blue cheese despite other reviews.)  The bacon gave it good flavor.

Sheer laziness compels me to buy pre-cooked bacon and nuke the garlic in oil for a minute, and it STILL comes out fantastic.  Fantastic recipe, plain and simple.

I served this along with fresh french bread to dip in it and it was so good.  I agree with others that this recipe doesn't make a lot so you may want to double or triple it.

I made this as an appetizer for the dinner group I started with some friends.  I was surprised by how little it made.  It barely covered the bottom of the 8x8 baking dish I put it in.  There was enough for us, as it is quite rich, but I don't know how many hungry guys it would feed.  No one was sure what was in it, but after being told it was made with blue cheese, a few people said they wouldn't have expected to like it, but they really did!  I did top it with sliced, toasted almonds, which looked nice and added to the flavor as well.  I served it with a sliced baguette.  So easy, I will certainly keep this recipe!

It was great with french bread or crackers.

I added the leftovers with a little milk to angel hair pasta and it made a fantastic hot pasta dish.

This recipe was great!  Left out the chives and added some green onion.  Bacon added some great crunch.  Would definitely make it again.

-Must love blue cheese- 

Used a good quality blue cheese & the flavor was predominate. Nice consistency, good flavor, if you like blue cheese. I don't not but my husband does. I made this for him. I would make it again.

We loved this recipe! I also used low sodium bacon and it was great! I served it with lightly toaste italian bread. It's more creamy/cheesy/bacony insteady of Blue cheesy! It was easy to make to! The worst was frying the bacon.

This recipe is loved everywhere I bring it. I've subbed dried minced onion or green onion, but I think the chives are the best. Take the foil off when its about 1/2 way done for it to turn a nice golden brown. Best warm so I serve in an oven safe dish so if there's leftovers I can easily heat it up. I've made it without the bacon and its still good but might need salt because its missing it from the bacon.  Luv it

This is a dip for blue cheese fans.  I served it with french bread as suggested adn didn't bring anything home from a dinner party.  It has a somewhat strong flavor but due to the ingrediants, you have to expect that...very good.

I tried out this recipe as possible dish for a party and decided to go with a slightly milder flavored dip that would appeal to everyone. This dip is rather strong, but if you like blue cheese it is great. We loved it with crackers, and I would definitely like to make it again. Nothing smells better than bacon and garlic cooking!

This was a big hit at our party last night. I doubled the batch as there were close to 20 people there. Used applewood smoked bacon with the lowest sodium content we could find which I baked in a stoneware pan for more even doneness. The only change I made was I using 1 cup of half & half for the double batch because I was planning on serving it from a small crock pot and other reviewers had stated it had been dry served that way. That worked really well just make sure the cream cheese and half & half blend is "runnier" than the consistency you want it to be when you serve it. I would not use less if planning to keep in a crock for 4 hours or more. This was very good on the plain Italian bread I served it with. Was also very good on the celery, pears, and Granny Smith apples that other guests had at the party with their dips. Those items better balanced the saltiness which I think is mostly from the blue cheese rather than the bacon. Will make again!

I made this recipe as written  for a small gathering yesterday and  while I thought it tasted good I was not over whelmed and probably won't make again. Only about 1/2 was eaten. I served on French bread slices as well as Green Apples at the suggestion of other reviews. We thought it was horrible on the green apple.

I whipped this up for a party last night and it was the bomb...had several requests for the recipe!!  I added a few extra tablespoons of half and half and used maple bacon, then baked it in a bread bowl and served with bread and celery.  I plan on making it again soon!!!

I made this for a gathering and everyone raved about how delicious it was!  I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9x9 dish.  A pie plate would work good, too.
I did have trouble when frying the bacon.  I burned some and in turn, the grease was extra hot and burned the garlic as soon as I added it.  So I had to start with new garlic and some grease that was salvaged.  Just be careful with that!

I followed the recipe to a tee but the texture was off and it was really salty.  With 18 guest less than about 1/4 cup was eaten.  They ate the plain French bread instead.  Sorry it sounded good!

This is simply incredible dip.  Delicious.  I adore blue cheese, but the contributor is correct - you really don't taste blue cheese with this dip.  It just warm and creamy awesomeness.  

I made it on the fly to take to a party when a more intricate appetizer I'd originally made was destroyed, and I didn't even get to taste it until it came out of the oven and I was about to run out the door.  It was all I could do not to take my coat off and sit down with the dip and french bread in front of me and just devour it.  I didn't have any time to do fresh bacon and didn't even have fresh garlic, so I just used bacon bits and packaged garlic and it turned out incredible.  I am bringing it to our family Christmas gathering and I can't wait to have it again.  I won't even dare make it before then because I know I'll just eat it all myself.

My husband and I absolutely loved this. I scaled it down for the two of us and should have made more since there was none left! I will be bringing this around to potlucks and parties.

This was awesome - made it without the bacon because I didn't have any...can only imagine it would be even better with!  Can't wait to try it again.

Wow - I made this for Easter and the Easy cheese ball recipe with ranch and pecans.  The cheese ball hardly got touched but they were scraping the bowl for the remainders of this.  Delicious and EASY!

This dip is so tasty!  I made it last night and took it to my knitting group with celery sticks, petite carrots, and cracker sticks.
I did not have fresh chives and used dried chives instead.  Otherwise I followed the recipe as is.  I could've eaten the whole dish myself.

This is the one dip that I make that my other half keeps asking for again!  It is BY FAR his favorite!
One minor change I do however- I use green onion instead of chives.

Excellent!  I adapted this recipe significantly to try to match a dip I love at a local restaurant - and it turned out great.  Over medium hear, warm 2 crushed cloves garlic in 1/8 c milk.  When slightly warm, add cubes of blue cheese to taste.  When warm, add cream cheese to desired thickness (maybe 8 oz).  Delicious - tastes just like the beloved Gusto dip!

Made this for the Super Bowl and everyone liked it.  Thanks to some reviewers, I used low salt bacon and am glad I did.  It would have been too salty otherwise.  Served with baquette rounds and plain crackers.

Really good, my boyfriend was worried when I told him blue cheese but we were both surprised how light it felt/tasted after being warmed with the perfect blue cheese flavor.  I did use green onions because that is what I had.  It is good cold, but really yummy warm.

I have been making this for years. I got the recipe from an old Junior League cookbook. The only thing I do differntly is use low sodium bacon to cut down the saltiness and I also add about 2 extra ounces of cream cheese. That seems to cut the saltiness as well. In the last few minutes of baking I sprinkle the top with sliced almonds and finish baking until they are golden. Serve with thinly sliced baguette, crackers or sliced green apples. Delicious! Someone always asks for the recipe.

This dip did not last 1 hour at a party! I used a sweet vildalia onion instead of the chives. Served with a sourdough baguette and crackers. I have to make it again due to all the requests. Is very rich though.

This was really good and fairly easy to make.  I didn't find it too salty like some reviewers have (must be a difference in the bacon used).  I doubled the garlic.  I also added a little extra half and half to help keep it from becoming too dry as suggested because I kept it warm in a crock pot after baking.  I served it with slices of freshly toasted baguette.  I will be making this one again.  Thanks for sharing it!

This dip was good. I used 5 oz of blue cheese, 3 cloves of garlic and turkey bacon instead of regular. My only complaint was that the bacon was a little soggy; maybe because it was turkey bacon, maybe because I didn't crumble it enough. Next time, I will try regular bacon and crumble it a little more to see if that does the trick. My boyfriend loved it and gave it a 9/10...

WOW!!  We could not stop eating this one!  One of the best and easiest recipes to really wow a crowd.  I think cooking your own bacon is really worth the extra effort.  We served this with a warm baguette but once that was gone, we were dipping anything and everything into this dip.  My other favorite dipper is fresh cut vegetables.  This is definitely going to be on my list of must-have party appetizers!

This recipe was AWESOME!! Everyone loved it! I baked it in a pumpernickel bread bowl...DELICIOUS! The only thing I would change is the amount...I would probably triple the recipe if I was having a crowd over..I had 8 people over and it was gone in minutes!

Although this dip was tasty, I was a bit dissapointed in the lack of blue cheese flavor, I'd cut back on the bacon as that's all I could really taste.  As for the garlic, I did not care for it being cooked in the bacon grease and think that next time I will put just one minced clove in raw, prior to baking.  On the bright side I did find this easy to prepare and a different style of warm dip.

This was awesome!  I served it with crusty bread and it was a huge hit.  The next time I make it, I may add a bit more garlic, but I really love garlic...it truly is great just as written.  Thanks so much for sharing!

I made this for a party, and for those people who love these ingredients, they will go crazy for this dip.  It is pretty intense, but yummy.

Great dip!!!Not your everyday ingredients.  I made it, brought to a family picnic and had them put it in the oven so it was hot out of the oven.

Bravo!  This is without a doubt the BEST blue cheese dip ever.  And it serves as a divine topper on a tri tip or filet.  Definetly a must have for any lover of rich and decadent foods.

This was SOOOO GOOD!  The flavors are great together.  I made this exactly how it says to and I wouldnt change a thing!  Next time I will make sure to make more of it because it disappeared fast!  My favorite is celery to dip with it but I also had tortilla chips and vegetable flavored crackers.  Excellent!

This was a pretty good dip.  I'm not a fan of blue cheese, but it was great in this recipe.  I recommend using a good quality, meaty bacon too.  I'll make this again.

This is heaven! We had it with french bread as suggested and it was to die for. I have now stirred the leftovers into the pot of potato soup I have on the stove and bet it will be my best potato soup yet! Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is fabulous.  Made it for a party, served with crispy breadsticks, and a baguette that was sliced, drizzled with olive oil, toasted and rubbed with a garlic clove.  Guests loved it.  And I, too added a few more cloves of garlic, just cause we love garlic.

This is very good.  It was OK even for people who don't care for blue cheese.  They didn't even realize there was any in it.  I served it with cocktail toast which was just so-so.  Italian bread or those crunchy bread squares or crackers would be better.  The quantity seems so small when you're making it, but it is very rich, so it seems fine.  I split the recipe into 2 small Fireking dishes (maybe about 1 cup each) and it was enough for a small party - about 10 - 12 people.

This dip was excellent!! It is thick, so use sturdy crackers or bread (I used Triscuits & white baguette). I used only 6 slices of bacon as others suggested, and next time I think I'll use a little more garlic (personal preference - LOVE garlic!), and a little more 1/2 & 1/2 and about a quarter less cream cheese, just to thin it a little. But it's excellent as is too! My husband & I ate the WHOLE thing one night - OOPS!! ;0)

My family and I thought this dip was good, but not great.  The bacon flavor was a little overpowering for us, and the dip seemed too salty.  I might try cutting down on the bacon if I were to make this again.

This dip was very good, but didn't blow me away (like the Buffalo Chicken Dip recipe from this site...I have dreams about that one!).  My guests seemed to enjoy it, and I did give the recipe to one person who requested it, but people weren't raving like I hoped they would. It doesn't make very much, and I still had about 1/3rd leftover after my party. It looked and smelled really good and impressive.  I may make it again.

This was very good.  I made it a day ahead for a superbowl party, and they ate it up!  Even the ones who don't like blue cheese.      And they were putting it on the buffalo wings, too.  I'll be taking this to the next party.

The recipe was easy to follow.  However, the taste of the blue cheese was too strong. If I were to make it again, I would add less blue cheese.

Excellent dip. Very different. Easy to make. I take this to work in a small crock pot. It does get thick so a little extra half & half will help to keep it thinned out. This is a favorite of my very picky friend! If she likes it, it's gotta be good!

This dip is very good.  My son, who hates blue cheese asked me to make it again. I used microwave bacon this time and I think it would have been better if I cooked it myself.

Have made this several times, always a huge hit! Sometimes I forget to saute the garlic, but just makes it spicier. Serve with veg, bread, potato chips, tortilla chips, or triscuits, always tastes great!

I have made this dip twice and each time I have received many compliments. Especially from my bacon and blue cheese lover friends. I'm not a huge fan of blue cheese but I too loved this dip!!

I substituted diced smoked pancetta. Delicious with baguette. Expect very rich and salty. Nice as another option for dips.

SO far I can only give 4 stars, I just mixed it all together and haven't cooked it yet. Cold tastes REALLY good, tempted to not even bake it, but I will tomorrow. I only had whipping cream and thanks to another reviewer's advice, saying cream, milk or 1/2&1/2 is ok, I used it and it seems fine. Added a little extra blue as my siblings are huge fans. I'll update after I've baked it tomorrow.

Wow...5 stars even with some substitutions.  I whipped this up on a whim tonight so I took many short-cuts.  I used low-fat cream cheese, non-fat half and half, and dried diced onions since I didn't have the proper ingredients on hand.  I even re-heated some left over bacon and used the frozen cubes of crushed garlic, and this dip was amazing.  Browning the garlic in the bacon fat gives this dip a really nice roasted flavor.  I just ate it with wheat thins, but toasted bread would probably be even better.  It actually tasted better when it was room temperature.  Overall very easy too, I will definitely make this again!

LOVE THIS. I like to use the low sodium bacon, 5-6 cloves of garlic and a mild blue cheese(not as salty)...I keep thinking this would taste amazing on my morning bagel but there is never any left! It's great with bread, veggies, crackers----just about anything......sooo good!

I'm hesitant to rate anything five but this is. Perfect.  I hate mayo and there are so few dips that don't have it.  I tried it on french bread, ritz, chicken, raw veggies and shrimp.  Best on raw veggies.  Sooooo good.  Next time I'll add more bacon and garlic just for kicks.  I used white onion, not chives, and a tiny amount.  I put it in two ramekins so I could bake one now and one later.

I altered this a tiny bit.  When I was caramelizing the garlic in the bacon grease, I threw in about 1/4 finely diced red onion.  I omitted the chive.  It was fantastic!! My mother won't touch blue cheese and I made her try it, she really liked it.  Thanks a bunch, it's a keeper!!

I was so excited to try this dip, but it was so bad we couldn't eat it.  We love all of the ingredients so we were sure it would be a winner.  WAAAAAY to salty,. even used lower sodium bacon (and I love salt). Just not edible.  Sorry...

I had a party last year where I first serve this dip.  This year was the second annual event and I was given as RSVP contingent upon serving this dip again.  I made a lot & i was devoured!  You may want to keep it warm in a small crock pot or serve in a microwave dish that can be warmed up a few times through the night as its at it best texture & taste served warm. Mmmm!

This was great! It was on my list to try for a long time and I finally made it for a football game- yum! Of course, I love blue cheese and everything in this, so it was kind of a no-brainer for me. Thanks for sharing- will definitely use again!

I took this dip to an outdoor beer / wing party my neighbor recently had.  It was just wonderful!  People who don't like blue cheese gobbled this up, some not even realizing the cheese was a main ingredient!  My changes: I took the advice of other reviewers and used the low sodium bacon.  With this, I did not find the dip to be too salty.  I used probably about 7 cloves of garlic.  (I just kept peeling!)  I also used 5 oz. of blue cheese.  I made the dip the night before and took out 1 hour before baking.  I then filled a hollowed French bread round with the dip, covered it with aluminum foil and baked on a cookie sheet at 350 until internal temp registered 165.  I served this with fresh torn French bread pieces for sopping up all the delicious dip!  What a hit!

Save time and use pre cooked bacon! Add some tobasco or red pepper flakes.  This dip was just very very delicious but gone way to soon. Double or triple the recipe.

I've made this recipe twice; once with regular blue cheese and once with gorgonzola - both groups of friends loved it although I spooned out most of the bacon grease before sauting the garlic (plus put in more garlic).  Absolute make this again and again!

I have made this recipe twice this week.  The first time I made it as the recipe states and the second time I added craisins and toasted pecans for color and crunch.  If you are a huge fan of bleu cheese, then this dip is for you as it really is a strong flavor.  I do not understand the reviewers that stated that people who do not like bleu cheese really liked this, because WOW it is a major flavor here.  I do not love bleu cheese, but I like it, so I did not love this dip, but I did like it.  Some reviews mentioned that this was salty.   I used low sodium bacon and the dip was not at all salty (I even added a few sprinkles of sea salt)& it was just fine.  I am giving this 5 stars because a true bleu cheese lover would go crazy for this, so if that is you then go for it and you should be pleased.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Funny thing about this, my husband who hates garlic didn't want to try it because of the garlic. Turns out it's now his favorite dip. I should mention I did use reduced fat cream cheese and blue cheese just to keep the fat down a little bit. Turned out awesome!

This is a fabulous, easy dish.  I agree with other reviewers, even friends that don't like blue cheese loved this.  I served it with crackers but will serve it with a sliced baguette next time.  Five of us finished it off in addition to 6 other appetizers so make several batches if you will have many people.  This will replace the artichoke dip I serve at my annual holiday open house.

This was AWESOME!!  I did everything to scale, but I cheated and used already made bacon pieces.  I did serve this with thin slices of green apples, and it was splendid.  Do NOT tell people what is in it.  Everyone was eating it until I told people was in it, and I guess all the high calorie ingredients instantly made people shy.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

I really liked this and will most definitely make again. I did get comments from several people who said, “yummy, but too potent for me.” or “I can only eat a little.” so just to keep in mind when serving to groups. Also, I originally found this recipe to be served topped with toasted walnuts, so that’s how I made it, and I think it added a lot to the dish... Especially if you are serving with grapes and baguette as I did, Made for a nice presentation. I used the pre cooked real bacon pieces, and it worked nicely. Also just used plain Publix brand gorgonzola to keep it as mild as possible. I think this would make an insanely delicous spread for a cold roast beef wrap, or as a steak topper. YUMM!!!

This was excellent!!!  Although after perusing many reviews and the majority of the people served it with french bread, I served it with "cocktail" bread, pumpernickel and sour dough.  It was convenient to spread and blended all the wonderful tastes together.  I followed the recipe to the T with no modifications.  Goes GREAT with a nice glass of cabernet.

YUM.  What a calorie bomb... but worth it.   It was a bit too salty, but I guess that's the price you pay for the bacon/blue cheese deliciousness!

I made this for a gathering and served it with french bread. It was fantastic! Everyone raved and wants the recipe. My husband was disappointed there weren't any leftovers for him to have the next day. Guess I'll be making this again soon! Thanks for a great recipe.

Loved this recipe!  Great even for people who aren't so fond of blue cheese (myself included).  I got the ready-cooked bacon and it was tons easier and took off 1.2 the prep time.

I do not care for blue cheese, but after reading the reviews I decided to give this a try.  I did like the dip very much served on French bread, but I used low sodium bacon and it was still pretty salty; if I had used regular bacon I fear it might not have been good at all. I thought it tasted best when really warm, so next time I would serve it in a mini chafing dish to keep it hot.

This was good.  It was rich.  I love blue cheese and so I was expecting richness.  I wasn't overall impressed with it.  It didn't make me stand over the dish and continue eating it.  I did make an olive tapenade the same night and spread this dip over a toasted baguette with the tapenade on top.  That was delicious.  I'm not sure I will ever make this dip again.

Very good.  I put it in a dip sized crockpot, and it was too hot - it burned up.  But before that, it was delicious.

This dip is amazing!  I doubled the recipe - would definately make sure you do as the single version is not enough.  Made this for the office to try and it was gone in seconds.  Served with Melba Rounds Toast.  Very rich and delicious!  Could also serve chilled on bagels...yummy!

I gave this a 4 because some of my guests really liked this, however, I felt it was a little overpowering.  I like blue cheese, but this was pretty intense.  I used less bacon as others suggested and it still was pretty salty. Thanks for the different recipe though!

Well, I gave this recipe 4 stars.  It was very good...but, I may change that to a 5 after making the higher fat recipe.....since I tried a lower fat recipe of it.  I used turkey bacon, lower fat cream cheese, light cream, and blue cheese.  You don't want to overcook the lower fat recipe...cause it will dry out quicker!  I served it on baguette slices.  I made some for work tomorrow.  I hope everyone likes it...  Oh yeah, I also put some slivered almonds on it too!!

Loved this!  Super easy to make.  I used it as a fondue, which I took to a fondue party.  Everyone raved about it.  I also cooked the bacon in my fondue pot so clean up was easy.  Yummy!

I used real bacon bits and didn't bother with the first two steps. Added fresh ground black pepper and served with French bread slices. It wasn't bad but it didn't have that "wow" kind of taste I was hoping for. I am giving it a four because it did come together quickly and was something different. For taste, I think it would be in the 3 to 3.5 range.

Very tasty - thought that it was a bit thick, and may try and thin it down next time with more half 'n half.  Will make again.

Every time I make this for a family gathering, it’s the first thing that’s gone. Even those who aren’t big blue cheese fans love it! People stand over this eating it! I make it exactly as the recipe states. I’ve read some reviews saying it’s too salty. I have never had that happen. I do use high quality ingredients and don’t skimp - brand names only. Maybe that’s what makes the difference. I serve with a variety of crackers, whatever I have on hand. I’d like to try it with apple slices and celery sticks in the future.

I put into a warming bowl and it dried out quickly.  Added more milk to help.  It was too salty with the blue cheese and maybe little less bacon

Love this dip and everyone I make it for loves it too. I make a day ahead and put in the fridge and cook later too if short on time. It's addicting! I use gorgonzola instead of blue cheese.

This dip is my husband's absolute favorite!  It's truly a standard of ours.  I do a little tweaking to the recipe now that I make it a lot.  
1.  I add about 1/4 cup of blue cheese dressing instead of the half and half.  
2.  I add a splash of worcestershire sauce, 
3.  I also add about 1/4 cup of slivered almonds. 
It's divine with a sliced baguette and some veggies!  I promise you- if you make this dip, there won't be a drop of it left after you serve it!!

OMG. I took this to book club & although we all like blue cheese, this was a HUGE hit. I used a 5 oz container of blue cheese, hand mixed it because I was using someone else's kitchen, & used pre cooked packaged "real bacon bits" instead of freshly cooked. I also used refrigerated minced garlic instead of fresh. I am considering  just keeping some made up in the fridge to eat with a  spoon a few times a day; it is THAT good. We ate ours on apple slices....DELISH!

This had such great reviews, I chose it to make for a dinner party of 6.  I made it exactly to the recipe.  I thought it was good, not great.  Nobody else seemed to care for it...  half was left over.  My husband said it was too blue cheesy....  probably half the amount of blue cheese would have made it better.

I made this for the adults at my son's second birthday party.  I unfortunately didn't have any due to being ill.  However the people that tried it didn't go back for more which leads to me to think they didn't enjoy it very much.  It was easy enough to make though.

i only used 5 slices of bacon and it was WAY too salty for me. the blue cheese was slightly strange and also found that the cheese didn't bind well when i reheated it the next day. won't make this again.

This was really salty, and I realized that because of the bacon there was no real way to fix that. The taste was okay, but the salt overwhelmed everything else. Won't make this one again.

I didn't like this dip.  It was way too salty, and it did not last very well over the few hours of a party.  It was initially decent (though too salty) when hot, but as it cooled it hardened too much and was inedible.  I won't make this again.

I've never been a fan of blue cheese, but this dish "converted" me. The flavors of blue cheese, bacon, and garlic were amazing. I've had strangers contact me for the recipe after trying it. I served it with sliced french baguettes toasts.

This is a very good, rich dip!  I didn't think it would make enough for the crowd I was feeding, it doesn't make a whole lot.  But it is so rich, it was plenty!  It does have a strong Blue Cheese flavor.

This was awesome! Everyone loved it... even bleu cheese-haters. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I had to tweek it a bit. It didn't have any "bite" to it, and I like my food to bite back- so I added some freshly ground black pepper. The lack of bite may have also been because I added less bacon than called for. I made it all ahead and warmed it in the crock-pot for Thanksgiving, so I didn't want the bacon to get too overpowering. Also, be very careful not to burn the garlic in the bacon grease- it cooks fast!
