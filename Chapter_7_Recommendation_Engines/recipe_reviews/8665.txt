WOW! I just made this for dinner tonight and my bf and I LOVED it!  This was SOOO easy to make.  The most time consuming part is slicing the onion / removing fat from the chicken (although I really didn't need to do the latter...). Use the best quality balsamic you can find - and afford (it REALLY does make a difference). Next time, I'll use a better quality balsamic (the dish was a tad tangy, but I like tart, so it wasn't an issue for me),  mix the balsamic, tomatoes & spices together BEFORE adding to the skillet (the spices tend to clump together otherwise) and add fresh minced garlic to the skillet as the breasts simmer (in lieu of the garlic salt called for).  If you are in a hurry or don't have all of the spices on hand, substitute Italian seasoned tomatoes for the plain ones and omit the seasonings alltogether.  This dish goes particularly well with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans, although, I think I'll try it with seasoned rice (i.e. chicken flavor) & steamed asparagus or broccoli next time to change things up a bit.

Just a note to those who aren't fond of balsamic vinegar. Try adding some chicken stock in with the vinegar to equal the 1/2 cup measurement. It's a great way to cut down on the bite of the vinegarbut, still adds great flavor. So, those who might give up on this recipe try it this way and see what you think.

I made this in the crockpot. Very easy to make. I prepped everything the night before and the next morning just popped everything in the crockpot and turned on low, the chicken was even frozen. I did use only 1/4 C. of balsamic vinegar as recommended in other reviews and I will add garlic cloves instead of garlic salt next time. Also, I will use chicken on the bone instead of boneless/skinless chicken breast if I plan on making this in the crockpot. The boneless chicken turned out dry. Other than that, the taste was very good.

Loved this dish....  only made a few changes based on my family's preference:  No onion and didn't miss it.  Cut down the rosemary, basil, and oregano to 1/4 tsp each and omitted the thyme.  Threw in sauteed mushrooms and roasted red peppers I had prepared for another meal.  Now here's the secret, use the very best balsamic vinegar you can find as it has the smoothest flavor and will cut down on the tart vinegar flavor and you must use San Marzano tomatoes.  It makes all the difference....  Served this over angel hair pasta with a salad.  Family loved it!!!

I made this for my beau last nite.  Not sure if he would be a fan of the Balsamic flavor.  I made it w/ 3 chicken breast and cut the balsamic amt in 1/2.  I added mushrooms & topped off w/ some mozzarella cheese.  I also added a touch of brown sugar to cut the tanginess of the vinegar and also to carmalize the onions & mushrooms.  It was very tasty and I took the leftovers to work where they all wanted to recipe. I will definately make this again!

Suggestion: Do not make this as stated if you are not a fan of the balsamic taste.  All others, enjoy this delightful dish.  I make this all of the time, and change it up by slicing the chicken and onions, adding slices of green peppers and serving over pasta...but I like preparing it as the recipe states as well.  I LOVE the flavor of it and love the fact that it's a great meal that can be made in little time which makes it perfect for those busy weeknights!  Thanks much!

All I can say is "wow"! I found this recipe in efforts to eat healthier. When reading it, I thought it resembled a pasta dish at TGIF's. It blew both my husband and I away! I made as written (rare for me), but doubled the sauce. I served atop angel hair, and topped with scallions for presentation. Not only will this be in our regular rotation, but it is also company worthy (a huge compliment coming from me!) As if this wasn't enough, it so economical and easy/quick to prepare. Over all, a winner!!! For all the reviewres complaining about the balsamic vinegar......If you're not a fan of it why would you try a dish where that is a prominant ingredient? I really can't figure that one out......

I can't believe how good this was!  I omitted the oil and sauteed the onions and breasts in water and I used fresh rosemary and fresh basil.  I served the chicken with risotto and poured the sauce onto the risotto.  The chicken was excellent and I'll definitely serve it again.

I cooked this on medium heat and followed the recipe almost exactly.  I did add 3 cloves of minced garlic.  My friend and I both enjoyed the flavor and the spices.  I served it over white rice and with green beans.  I do plan on adding this to my regular rotation.

Very good.  I followed earlier advice and cubed the chicken and served over angel hair pasta.  My husband hurried home the next day to eat the leftovers.  (He NEVER eats leftovers!!!)

Great recipe. I have made this several times. I converted it into a slowcooker recipe for a friend who had company coming over. I used 5 chicken breast halved into 10 pieceds and seasoned both sides with salt and pepper. In a hot skillet seared off both sides till browned working in batches. I then placed them in the slow cooker and poured the balsamic tomato and onion seasoned mixture over the top. Placed on low for 4-5 hours. (This next part is optional for a thicker sauce to go over polenta, mashed potatoes or pasta.) Remove the chicken and pour the sauce in a sauce pan add 2Tbs. tomato paste  and simmer till thickend. I really loved this method because I was able to make twice as much chicken, go to our kids football game and visit with her family and have a clean kitchen! Great technic!!!!!

I made this a week ago and it was so good, I had to make it again. The more I make a recipe, the better it comes out and the more creative I can make it. I sauteed a clove of garlic(minced), sweet peppers, artichoke hearts and shaved onions in olive oil and a Italian blend dry seasoning. ((while my veggies are browning I made a mix of the balsamic vinegar, chicken stock, and brown sugar...***I doubled my sauce*** 3/4 cup balsamic, 1Cup chicken stock and 4tbs of brown sugar))I then salt and peppered my chicken and tossed it the the browning veggies and browned the chicken. Once everything is blended and browned, i tossed in some fresh chopped tomatoes and the sauce mix. I brought to a boil, lowered heat and covered for about 20 mins)**cook on low for longer if you would like your balsamic to thicken***   Yummy!! Paired with garlic and olive oil couscous and broccoli :)

My husband and I loved this recipe!  I've made this twice now in the past two weeks and it is just delicious.  However, I did use the half the recommended balsamic vinegar and substituted the other 1/2 with low-sodium chicken broth and it was even better.  I also used used 2 cloves minced garlic instead of garlic powder, fresh rosemary, fresh basil, and added fresh mushrooms when browning the onions.  Sooo good and will remain a favorite in our house.

I made this last night for dinner. Excellent & followed receipe exactly. You MUST use good balsamic vinegar. I live in Appleton, Wi. and we have a small shop called "The Olive Cellar". They specialize in olive oils and vinegars. I used their 18yr old aged balsamic and it was delicious. Even my husband, who is not very adventurous when it comes to ceratin things absolutely loved this.I will definitely make this again. I think crumbled feta cheese would be a good addition to this receipe.

** I've seen the reviews since my original one years ago.  What kind of idiot would try to make this enitrely without balsamic vinegar?  Cmon, people! ** Wonderful!  Many thought it was a bit "balsamicky" -- here's what I did.  Instead of pasta or rice (too mushy to hold up to this), I boiled some potatoes, then cut them up and fried them lightly in a skillet in olive oil and a LITTLE salt and pepper, , making chunky hashbrowns (no seasoning -- the "drip-down" onto the potatoes from the chicken breast is sufficient and neutralizes the vinegar).  I like to serve this with steamed broccoli lightly drizzled in italian salad dressing, with a crunchy warm loaf of sourdough.

Amazingly good just as written.  A good quality balsamic is not acidic at all but incredibly sweet.

A great weeknight dish that you can easily make in 30 minutes with basic ingredients from your pantry and freezer.  This deemed a "keeper" by my husband.  I served it with mashed potatoes (I needed to get them used up) and braised spinich.

This is the best chicken dish I've had! I left out the tomatoes. Put all other ingredients in my crock pot. Put a little olive oil in the bottom of the crock pot. I used 2 frozen chicken breasts and it only took 2.5 hours to cook. My husband raved about it! I did also subsitute the garlic salt for fresh garlic and did 1/4 cup of balsamic and 1/4 of white balsamic. I paired this with a mixture of brown & wild rice and steamed vegetables. We will be having again very soon! (Also, next time I'll make more of the sauce. It was very good on the rice and made it very flavorful!) Very easy and healthy meal!

This was really just ok...I had to do some tweaking at the end because it was a little bland.  I removed the chicken and reduced the sauce since it was going over pasta and it was too thin for that at first.  Also, the chicken breasts were a bit dry eventhough they were a little large and I cooked them according to the directions.  Maybe because they were organic?  I promised my friend leftovers since she couldn't make it over but I am a little nervous to give them to her.  Defintely not a repeat for me.

Wow!  Talk about lip smacking flavors.  I made as is, and have made it again with personal preferences which are a very small departure from the original recipe.  As stated many times, if you go for the cheap balsamic vinegar, then expect a meager outcome.  This ingredient is the main focus of the recipe; might as well not skimp on it.  The first time I made as is, even my kids liked it.  They made a little face on the first bite but the tomatoes and spices really balanced the vinegar.  The only things that I have changed thereafter is really simple,
1- Added three cloves of garlic when cooking the onions
2- Combined the tomatoes, vinegar, and spices in a bowl and then added to the chicken.  It just kept all the ingredients together and coated the chicken better in my opinion.
I have made this several times and will continue!

This is amazing!  The chicken is moist is very flavorful!  I cooked for about 10 minutes and chicken was not fully cooked and sauce was nicely reduced so I put a lid on to hold in liquid and it was great!  Serve with pesto mashed potatoes, and roasted cauliflower. YUM!

Very good and very easy.  I sauteed the onions and made the sauce/veg mixture in a saute pan. I salt and peppered my chicken cutlets in a baking dish and topped the chicken with the sauce.  Bake for 20 minutes and Enjoy!

Made with chicken tenders and I couldn't believe how tender they were (no knife needed) and the flavors were perfectly blended!  FYI, My mom gave me a wonderful ceramic blade mandoline style hand held slicer from Kyocera (around $19) and I almost look for recipes requiring sliced veggies because it's so easy and quick to use.  The onion took 10 seconds to slice (and 10 seconds to clean up) so this recipe was soo quick!

Everyone should realize that the resulting flavor is dramatically affected by the quality of the balsamic vinegar. This is no time to go cheap.

Knowing that using straight balsamic vinegar would give it a well vinegar taste I decided to do a balsamic reduction prior to adding it to the chicken in hopes of bringing out its more sweet flavor. However it was still to tart and to balance the flavors I added sugar to taste. This definitely helped.

I have made this recipe at least 15 times, and it is perfect everytime. you can make so many changes, and the dish is pretty much fool proof. PERFECT!!!  I love it served over rice.... and with steamed asparagus, it is out of this world. A perfect meal for sure!   I could not give a dish a stronger reccomendation!

This was excellent and so easy! I pounded the breasts thin to cut down on cooking time. I only used three breasts but kept the "sauce" ingredient amounts the same. We really like this and the only thing I would do next time is cut the rosemary and thyme in half. We, too, used petite diced tomatoes and thought they were perfect. This dish tastes much more difficult than it was. Thanks for posting the recipe.

SO Good!  You do have to love Balsamic vinegar for this one but luckily we do!  I tossed in 4 different coloured peppers in while simmering and it was just incredible.

Wow!  What an easy, tasty and lowfat recipe!!  I used bone-in chicken breasts and simmered them for about half an hour.  They were super tender and juicy, and the flavor was wonderful!  Served over rice with a side of steamed vegetables.  Yum!  Highly recommend!!

I made this a while back and I realized just now that I rated it very poorly. I guess I had forgotten about it so, I made it last night and we really enjoyed it. Used about 1/4 cup balsamic and used crushed tomato's instead of the diced. I added about a 1/2 teaspoon each of garlic and onion powder and added a little bit of sugar to sweeten it up and I also cut the chicken tenderloins into bite size pieces and put all over rice. I am glad that I had forgotten about this and tried it again because it was really yummy. Thanks for a great recipe!

Living in Tokyo, I have to make do with limited ingredients. I had everything for this recipe already in the cupboard. If you like balsamic vinegar, then you'll like this. I used fresh tomatoes and served it with pasta, though rice would have been better to absorb some of the sauce. I didn't have any of the spices separately so I used italian seasoning instead. A good, quick weekday supper.

I decided to make this recipe, because I wanted to mix things up a bit. I am not a big fan of vinegar anything (normally), but wanted to make it as I thought my husband would like it. We BOTH loved it. I did change somethings after reading other people's reviews. I mixed a little less than 3/4 a cup of the balsamic vinegar with a cup of chicken broth and about 3 tablespoons of brown sugar and only a fraction of the seasonings called for and set aside. Then I browned the onions and once those were ready I added 2 teaspoons of fresh minced garlic then added the chicken to brown. Then I just added a can of diced tomatos and brought it to a boil and then ccovered and simmered it until it was done. This was different and very tasty. I even loved the chicken reheated!

This was great! I used fresh garlic (6 cloves), threw in about 2-3 cups fresh sliced mushrooms and about 3 cups baby spinach on top of the chicken to steam when it was cooking. To make this perfect? PARMESAN CHEESE sprinkled on top. Yum!

I've made this twice and enjoyed it both times.  I always make extra sauce.  Using sweet basil and yellow onions gives it more of a sweet taste which everyone loved.

This was really good.  I put mine into the crockput before work.  I browned the chicken in the pan, put it into the stoneware, then simmered the tomatoes, onion, herbs, salt, pepper and added some garlic powder for 5 minutes and then tossed it into the crockpot.  Served it with brown rice and steamed zucchini.  This was delicious.  I only added 1/4 c balsamic vinegar and it was perfect!

I loved this one.  I added a scant teaspoon of red pepper flakes and that made it five stars for me.  Next time I will only use 1/3 cup of balsamic vinegar and use fresh rosemary rather than dried.

Very good, quick, and easy recipe.  I just did a few things differently:  used fresh basil, 1/4 c balsamic vinegar & 1/4 c chicken broth, used crushed tomatoes instead of diced, added a pinch of brown sugar, and browned the chicken breasts with minced garlic cloves in addition to the onions.  Overall, an excellent dish - highly recommended.

This was AMAZING! It tasted so good, I could have sworn I was eating something bad for me...But I wasn't! I followed the recipe for the most part, except I used basil, rosemary, and tarragon. I added a pinch of cinnamon, and a little sugar to take the edge off. When the chicken was done, I removed it and let the sauce reduce. Then I finished it with a pat of butter. Scrumptuous!

AWESOME!  This was so quick, easy and tasty.  I followed the recipe with a few minor changes, used chicken tenders (shorter cooking time) and added 1 teaspoon of brown sugar to caramelize the onions.  I served this over Easy Sauteed Spinach recipe.  I will DEFINITELY make this again.  My new favorite chicken recipe!

The taste was not good at all.  Balsamic vinegar and tomatoes together made the dish much too acidic. The taste of the herbs is minor as it is overwhelmed by the balsamic vinegar taste (and I like balsamic vinegar but just thought the combo of ingredients was poor).  My husband thought it was disgusting. I would never make this again.

Made this tonight according to directions but wasn't completely happy with the result.  It still smelled too vinegary so I removed the chicken, let the juices reduce for about 5 minutes, then added about 1/3 cup of heavy cream for a really wonderful sauce.  The cream cut the acidity of the vinegar just enough. Served it over pasta but will try rice next time to sop up more of the sauce.

I think that this was really good and would be even better with fresh tomatoes and herbs. I read a lot of reviews that said it was too sour. I think a big part of how sour the dish is would depend on the quality of balsamic vinegar used. A good quality balsamic vinegar is thicker and sweeter than cheaper ones and would be great in this dish. I can see how a cheap vinegar would make it way too sour..even for someone who loves vinegar.

Tasted great off the grill. Followed the recipe, except for the garlic.  I used fresh minced garlic.  
This was the 2nd time this week I made it.  Great with grilled vegetables.
Thanks for the recipe

This made a very good meal.  I served it with brown rice and green beans.  The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I felt the need to modify the recipe.  I only used 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar and substituted the other 1/4 cup with chicken broth.  I believe it would have been inedible with 1/2 cup of vinegar, as it was already pretty strong with only 1/4 cup.  Otherwise, it was an excellent meal and will go into our regular meal rotation.

This recipe was okay. Even though I don't much like the taste of vinegar with chicken, it wasn't terribly offending. It still was a bit much though. The presentation is also a disappointment (maybe I did something wrong dressing it up with broccoli) since the chicken comes out a bit grey and covered in blackish bits (the herbs). I don't think I'll be making this again.

Great weekday or weekend recipe. We added fresh mushrooms when adding the tomatoes and other ingredients. Used only 3 breasts but used full 14 oz. can of tomatoes to serve over our rice. Excellent supper.

This gets all stars as an EASY quick dinner that a married dude can zip up for the wife, three kids or mistress in no time flat. I just zipped this up on 11/17/14 and it will become a repeat at the dinner table.  I served with baked asparagus and garlic.  Toss in some Italian bread for the carboholic in your crew and you'll be good to go.

I drizzled some Alessi Balsamic Reduction on top when I served and it was great.  The bottle of merlot helped out as well!

Super easy recipe to make but I did feel like it was a bit to acidic between the tomato and the vinegar. I love balsamic vinegar but this was the kind of acidic that burns your nostrils! I'd recommend using only a quarter cup of vinegar and maybe cut it with something more savory like chicken broth.

Yummy!! Made this for myself tonight and I greatly enjoyed it. I have to admit though that the onions were my favorite part:) So Good!! The only changes I made was to use fresh tomatoes and also I didn't have any rosemary or thyme. Next time I make it I will use fresh garlic, add extra onions, and make sure I have rosemary. It is better to cube the chicken or cut into strips in order for it to soak in the flavor so the middle part is not dry or tasteless. I ate with a side of green beans and roasted red potatoes. Delicious!! Will be making this again(soon). Thanks for sharing!! 
*UPDATE* ~ Double the onion, use fresh garlic and tomatoes, and add spinach and mushrooms. Awesome!!

For us, this was only a 4.  It was interesting and edible, but some tweaking might improve it.  I followed the recipe, and it filled a 12 inch skillet.  I feel that the balsamic vinegar should be reduced to 1/4 c. and that crushed tomatoes should be used instead of diced.  The tomato pieces and the herbs sat on top of the chicken instead of blending into the sauce.  If I make it again, I will combine the vinegar, tomatoes and herbs before I add it to the skillet.  There was a lot of sauce left over.

just finished eating this. i was surprised at how much i liked it. i used rotel lime and cilantro tomatoes because its all i had in the cupboard, diluted the balsamic vinegar with maybe 2 tbsp of chicken stock, and then about 1 tsp of brown sugar in the pan to tone down the tangyness of it. definitely going to be doing this one again.

This was lovely. Such rich taste. Next time will brown first side of chicken, then add onions. Added a little wine to the tomato-balsamic mix. Can't hurt ...  could only help.

I pretty much followed the measurements and ingredients from the original recipe except I used / added:

Fresh garlic cloves (6 - minced)
1 large can diced tomato (28 ounce)
1 can of mushrooms
1 can of artichokes

I chopped the raw chicken breast (4 med - lg ) into med - bite size pieces.  Sauteed the onion, garlic and mushrooms in a skillet with the olive oil.  While that's going, put the diced tomato and artichoke in a crock pot to get it warming (on High).  When the onion mixture is close to done, added the chicken pieces to give them a quick sear to seal the flavor / juices to help prevent drying. 
Add the whole skillet mixture into the crock pot, gave it a good stir and let it simmer on High for about 1 1/2 hrs checking periodically.  I also took the suggestion of adding a little bit of brown sugar to help cut the acidity from the vinegar and did this about 45 mins in.  Can't say the exact measurements of the sugar...maybe 1 T. total.  This dish worked out very well and the chicken was not dry!  It also had a very nice sauce!  I served it over brown rice.  This one's a keeper for us!

Amazing.  The flavor of the balsamic is strong, so if you don't love balsamic, this probably won't be up your alley; we LOVED it.  The sauce reduced to such a nice thickness that I'd be reluctant to add stock, as some reviewers have done; more liquid seems like a bad idea.  I couldn't stop dipping bread in the sauce as I was putting away the sole leftover breast!  Bonus prize:  go easy on the garlic salt, and it's low-sodium.  You won't miss it because of the acid.

Everyone really liked this dish and complimented on how moist the chicken was.  However, after trying it once the second time around I made a few adjustments.  I found the rosemary totally overpowerd the other herbs (and I'm not really a huge fan of it) so I cut it in half.  I put the oinions in raw because I don't like them too overcooked.  And lastly, I added more balsamic (because I love it) and doubled the tomatoes so there was extra sauce which I used on rice.  All in all, a very easy and yummy chicken dish!

This is FANTASTIC!!! I did the recipe exact ( I like to try it without changes first) and rather than put it over pasta (which would be AWESOME too though!) I put it over a fresh green salad.  No need to put fattening dressing on when this chicken makes a VERY flavorful sauce.  SO HEALTHY AND TASTY!! Next time I think Im gonna throw in a can of artichoke hearts too!  YUM!!!!!

Made this tonight and it was a keeper.  I used the "servings/scaling" feature on allrecipes.com to change it to 2 portions. I used petite-diced canned tomatoes. Then I followed the recipe except instead of cooking it on the stovetop, I baked it in the oven at 350 for 35 minutes.  Then I cut up the cooked chicken and dumped the chicken and sauce on top of angel hair pasta.  It was terrific!

I love this recipe.  The only change I made was to make the balsamic vinegar a glaze that you add at the end.  In a very small saucepan, add 1 cup balsamic vinegar and 1 tbsp sugar.  Bring to a boil and then allow to simmer, stirring frequently, until it has reduced by 1/2.  It should stick to the back of a spoon.  Remove to a cool container.  Then I just drizzle the balsamic glaze over the finished dish.

This was good but not spectacular.  I used 4 breasts & cut the balsamic vinegar back to 1/4 cup as suggested.  Also cut back on the spices a tiny bit & used fresh minced garlic instead of the garlic salt.  I served it with pasta and fresh grated romano but would use rice if I make it again since the sauce is watery & would be better absorbed into rice.  I think it might be good with some mushrooms & zucchini added to the sauce while simmering.  Also I let it simmer, covered for 1/2 hour since cooking it in the sauce keeps the chicken moist.  My son & husband both liked it so I think I might play around with the recipe & try it again with rice.  It's a nice change for a chicken recipe, thanks.

This was very tasty. My husband really dug it and even the kids liked it. I only used a couple of tablespoons of balsamic because that was all I had (used red wine vinegar for the rest) but had I used all balsamic, I think it would've been too strong. I used 4 chicken breasts and the amount of sauce was just right. I liked it too especially since it's lo-cal! All in all, a good recipe if you like balsamic vinegar.

By far the best chicken recipe I've made in my entire life!  Moist chicken, gourmet flavor without being snobbish, AND it looks great, with the golden and red colors mixed with bits of onion.  Totally easy to make, and idiot-proof. AMAZING!!

We enjoyed this.  I had some leftover ricotta cheese, and I stirred it in at the end for a yummy, cheesy chicken and pasta!  The flavor of balasmic vinegar with the ricotta cheese was wonderful.  Will make again.

I did it with pasta, adding the extra juice the chicken left in the pan to it. Everything was delicious and quick.

Well, it doesn't get much easier than this! One skillet which makes this easy to prepare and easy to clean up - perfect for a quick, yet delicious weeknight meal! I used thin sliced chicken breasts and minced garlic vs. garlic salt. I also opted to add in some sauteed mushrooms along with the onions to get in some extra veggies. I used seasoned diced tomatoes, added a pinch of red pepper flakes and just eyeballed the rest of the ingredients to taste. A definite keeper!

This was really good.  My husband who doesn't care for most vinegars loved it, but I did add a little chicken broth to tone down the vinegar flavor a bit.

I've made this recipe several times for my brother and each time it get's better and better! I followed the recipe exactly as stated and added a little bit of brown sugar to help caramelize the onions. If you're a fan of balsamic vinegar you will absolutely adore this recipe! Thanks for sharing!!

We LOVED this chicken. We used fresh herbs from the garden (3 times what the recipe called for in dry herbs) and white balsamic vinegar. When it was done cooking, we folded in angel hair pasta, letting it sit to absorb the juices before serving. OUTSTANDING dish, of the sort you might have in a nice restaurant. Distinctive flavor, moist chicken. Wonderful. We will make this regularly.

I made this recipe exactly as written. I was certainly edible, but the flavors weren't very well balanced. While I am a big fan of Balsamic Vinegar, and used a very good, aged vinegar, it overpowered the chicken and was the dominant taste. Next time, I think I'll try halving the amount of vinegar, supplementing with chicken stock, or water. Also, the Balsamic Vinegar significantly darkened the dish, making it much less visually appealing than the picture indicates.

I love balsamic vinegar, but for some reason, this didn't turn out that great.  The onions were probably the best part.  I followed the recipe exactly, and the chicken turned out dry.  I think it would have been better had I chopped up the chicken first.  That way, the meat would have been more flavorful.  Probably won't be trying this again anytime soon.

Such a quick and easy meal and SO delicious!  We only use 2 chicken breasts, and serve it over rice with a side of green beans and mix it all together.

Flavor is definitely good, but remains superficial. Chicken does not absorb the flavor. Any fixes?

This is a good tasting healthy recipe.  I added mushrooms when it was time to simmer,  which was a good complement to the onion.  Unlike others, I didn't think the 1/2 cup of balsamic vinegar was overpowering, I thought it was the right amount.

I made this in the slow cooker and it was awesome!  I used only 3 chicken breasts seasoned with black pepper and garlic salt.  Then topped with some onion, 1/4 c. balsamic vinegar, the full can of tomatoes and then the dried herbs.  It smelled like balsamic, but it wasn't overpowering in flavor.  I loved it and I will make this again - slow cooker or stovetop as per recipe - doesn't matter!

I made a couple changes which I thought would be amazing, and they were!  I saw another recipe on this site for a balsamic chicken and it used mushrooms, which inspired me to include mushrooms in this recipe.  I used one carton of fresh mushrooms, which I sliced into nice chunks.  I then added a lot of garlic granules to taste, and a little salt instead of garlic salt.  I was in a hurry so I didn't brown the onions and chicken, I just added everything into a small stock pot.  I thought that by adding everything at once, the flavors would be absorbed by the chicken as it's cooking.  By browning you may seal the pores of the meat so the vinegar can't get in.  Anyway, I threw everything into a small stock pot and simmered until the chicken was done.  There was a lot of moisture from the mushrooms, so I took a cup of chicken broth and added cornstarch, which I then used to thicken the juices in the pot into a delicious gravy.  It was excellent!

I apologize for my rather unsightly presentation of this dish, but ignore the fact that it looks a little harried. This braised chicken is fantastic! I always worry that chicken breasts will be dry but this recipe solves that problem and adds a nice flavor punch with that tasty balsamic & tomato sauce. We enjoyed this very much (both times I've made it)! Didn't change a thing and I really like that deep dark color that the chicken gets. Thank you for sharing the recipe! :)

I'm giving this 4 stars because it's a good recipe to start  with but to me, needed some tweaking to suit my taste.  Since some readers commented that the chicken was bland, I brined my chicken with salt, sugar, the spices listed in the recipe and vinegar.  Instead of 1/2 cup balsamic, I used 1/4 and added 1/4 of red wine.  To make the dish more saucy, I doubled the tomatoes using one can of rotel and one can of italian spiced tomatoes.  After the sauce simmered and the chicken was cooked through, I thought the sauce was a little too tart so I added a tablespoon of honey to balance the flavors.

This chicken was amazing!  My kitchen smelled wonderful as I was making it.  Will definitely make again!  I guess the only thing I did differently was I didn't measure out any of the spices or the balsamic vinegar; it didn't end up affecting anything negatively.  Thank you for the recipe!

I prepared this dish for dinner last night and it was really good!  I added mushrooms and artichoke hearts as others recommended to get in more veg.  For those who found it too tangy, try cooking it a bit longer to allow the balsamic vinegar to sweeten up.  Thanks for a great recipe!

THIS IS AMAZING!!! My boyfriend loves it, his parents love it, my mom loves it. It's a crowd pleaser, I love making this for people because it's so simple yet fancy and full of flavor. I followed the directions exactly and it was perfect just as directed. I serve it with a rosemary olive oil loaf and fresh steamed green beans. So good!

It was pretty good. It kept the chicken moist and I added more garlic and onions. I'd have to say you got to love balsamic for this dish to be excellent. My mom loved it, but I had a little hesitation because it was quite tangy but overall it was a good recipe. Thank you!

Omitted the tomatoes, halved the herbs, halved balsamic and replaced with chicken stock, added garlic and herb feta to skillet in last five minutes and let melt down. Yummy.

I'm sorry, I did not care for this recipe. I followed it as written. As it was cooking, it didn't look appetizing, so I added another can of tomatoes, hoping to make enough to cover penne pasta. I like all the ingredients, so I'm not sure why it didn't do anything for me. I probably won't make again.

To date this is the best chicken recipe I have gotten from All recipes.com. I was afraid to add so much balsamic at first however went ahead and tried it anyway. I served it at a dinner party and it was a smash! The only extra part I added some some brown sugar towards the very end just to add a slightly sweet touch to what might have been a bitter taste to those not used to balsamic.

This was great!  I reduced the vinegar by half and added mushrooms.  Seems like a really versatile sauce - I am going to try it with prawns, too.  Rice is a perfect side because it soaks up some of the juices... Not sure about it coming out "black" as some reviewers have said... mine was a rich red because of the tomatoes.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was good. I will make it again, but maybe add less Balsamic, slice the chicken, and serve over rice instead of whole wheat pasta. The only thing I did change was add a can of mushrooms and extra garlic. It's great in a pinch, and will make again.

We are trying to eat better and this fit the bill. However after reading reviews I made the folling changes. I kept the chicken the same, doubled the sauce, added minced garlic, fresh mushrooms, fresh chopped spinach, and tomatoe paste to thicken. Served with whole wheat pasta and tossed salad. Very Good!

So delicious! I cut chicken into small pieces and used 2 fresh tomatoes cut into cubes instead of the caned tomatoes. I increased the thyme to 2 tablespoons, and did not use rosemary and basil. I also decreased the amount of vinegar to about 1/4 cup.

EXCELLENT!! An incredibly easy and flavorful chicken dish!! Didn't have garlic salt so just used a teaspoon each of salt and garlic powder, also didn't have diced tomatoes so I just used a can of stewed tomatoes (I crushed them up), which all worked out just fine! The vinegar is NOT overwhelming at all! It's just right!! The whole family couldn't stop eating this!! Even my 6 yr. old loved it! Will definitely make this again and again and will try with fresh herbs!! Thanx for the wonderful recipe Beth! It's always nice to find great new recipes for chicken! :)

If there were 6 stars, I'd choose that! This recipe was WAY too easy and WAY too quick to taste that good. AND it's low-carb for the Atkins diet! My boyfriend raved. I made minor modifications (used 1/4 cup vinegar and only 4 chicken breasts and full amts of everything else) and it was wonderful. I was worried about said boyfriend disliking balsamic vinegar but he couldn't get enough. This has to be one of my absolute favorites so far and I'm sending it to all my friends and family! Thank you so much, Beth!

we loved this recipe (as modified) but it might be a bit too balsamic vinegary for some.  Because of other reviewers saying it made lots of sauce, I cut up the chicken and used it as a pasta sauce. The only change I made other than cutting the chicken was adding about 1/4 cup of fresh chopped basil at the last moment. My husband and I both loved it.

Tastes great! My girlfriend and I just made this tonight with white rice. We also had buttered bread with it. All went together very well. 

One thing: we used only 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar and it was plenty. 

Other than that, fantastic recipe!

I made it as is, and it was great! 6 out of 5 stars! I served with asparagus and brown rice. However, you NEED to love Balsamic Vinegar to like this dish... obviously. Those who are saying it's too much Balsamic, might be served better by an entirely different dish. Balsamic is a strong, bold flavor, and I love it!

Very easy, I would add an extra onion because I love onions.
I agree use a higher grade Balsamic vinegar.
I used fresh tomatoes and herbs out of my garden.
For gluten free could be served with quinoa or rice.

After removing the cooked chicken from the pan I decided to reduce the sauce by cooking over medium heat another ten minutes. The sauce was amazing over the chicken breasts. We loved this recipe!

pretty much made this exactly except I left out the tomatoes. and I cooked chicken in the oven, because I cannot handle the fried oil cooking. basically just put chicken in mixing boil and added all ingredients and then transferred to cooking pan and dumped the rest of the excess ingredients on top of chicken. cover with foil to keep chicken moist! oven at 375 for 30-50 minutes dependent upon oven cooking intensities.

Great dish super easy to make and like it says in no time at all. It was a little sweet for our taste but we'll certainly make it again but with a variation of some sort maybe add in some peppers.

I just made this recipe for dinner and it was so delicious! I made only minor changes - canola oil instead of olive, sun-dried tomatoes instead of canned and mushrooms instead of onions since we didn't have any - and the recipe was still delicious. I wasn't a huge fan of the sun-dried tomatoes. Next time, I think I'll try mushrooms and onions instead. So glad I made this dish. Loved it!

This recipe is now my favorite!  Excellent combination of ingredients and spice, offset by the balsamic vinegar--a real hearty dish! The only thing I added was fresh mushrooms.

This was so good! I used fresh garlic cloves minced. I used my home grown tomatoes and fresh herbs. I love balsamic vinegar, so made it as stated.  When almost done, I placed a slice of mozzarella fresca on top and let it melt.  So very yummy!

This was really good, made it just as the recipe states except cut in half and used small chicken breasts as there are only two of us.  Served over steamed rice with sauteed zucchini and mushrooms as a side.  Delicious and full of flavor.  I think next time though, I would use pull the chicken and onions out of the pan after browning and add the juices drained from the tomatoes and the balsamic vinegar and deglaze the pan, then simmer that down to about half and add back the chicken, onions and drained tomatoes to simmer for the last fifteen minutes.  Definitely don't overcook this, if you cook as stated the chicken will be perfectly moist.

This is a very ordinary recipe that has been rated very highly. I like the taste of Balsamic vinegar and I use it in recipes where it blends in gently. However with this dish it just happened to be the predominant flavor and after a few mouthfuls, my husband and I grew tired of it .

This is soooo delicious! I love the tang from the vinegar, the zip from the Ro-Tel tomatoes & the herbs add a nice touch! It is also weight watchers friendly...only 3 pts. for a 3 oz breast! I didn't use all the oil, just a spritz of olive oil spray in my non stick skillet. Served it with steamed broccoli and brown rice. This will be a regular around here!

This recipe was very tasty and pretty simple to make. But, next time if I use boneless/skinless chicken breast again, I will cut it up in to pieces so it retains the flavor or the balsamic more. Would also like to try bone in chicken in the crockpot! My husband and teenage boys just ate it up!

The whole family loved it, and we plan to fix it again. I reduced the entire mixture until the sauce had some level of thickness to it, and the sauce/onion/tomato mixture was a delicious way to dress up the blandness of chicken breasts.

Wonderful recipe with no substitutions, but did add an extra onion.  Weight watchers - I figured out the recipe for points plus, and it comes to 5 points per serving for each of 6 servings. Tip- if you try to brown all the chicken and onions in a pan, they will all wind up steaming with no color.  I had to begin the browning of the onions, then remove them and brown the chicken before putting all back in pan. My husband and I both loved it.

This recipe was so easy and delicious! We used progresso balsamic vinegar, but reduced serving to 1/4 cup because I was afraid of it being too tangy. I lightly sprinkled with brown sugar also just to carmalize a little bit. Served with chicken rice and green beans. So light but still flavorful. Also almost doubled the herbs and so flavoful and yummy. A repeat in my house for sure!

So easy to put together for tasty results! I did find it a little tangy and think next time a pat of butter or two and a dollop of honey might even this out just fine! The 'gravy' was excellent on the mashed potatoes! Thanks for the recipe.

This was YUMMY!  I did a mix of white and regular balsamic.  Also used fresh roma tomatoes instead.  Even my 2 year old ate it- and that says a lot.  This meal is definitely in my meal rotation now.

I don't even give this recipe a star.....sorry but I make this meal and even used less than what it called for of balsamic and my husband still didn't like it.  I normally get recipes to make him meals out of this site but this was one where he said please don't make this again and he had to go out and himself somethin to eat

I only used 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar as I thought the 1/2 cup would be too much. I was glad I had cut it back as it would have been too over powering a flavor in the amount listed in recipe (which is why I am giving only 4 stars). I actually think it would have been better using 2 to 3 tablespoons balsamic. I cooked this in individual foil packets on  a hot grill, 350 - 400, for 15 to 20 minutes. I did cut the chicken portions into 3 to 4 pieces prior to putting in foil packets. I did not pre brown the onion or chicken, just divided onion amongst the foil packets. I mixed the drained diced tomatoes with the balsamic, all the dried herbs, some salt and fresh minced garlic. This was spooned equally over the chicken and vegetables. I did add some red & green bell peppers cut into chunks. Then sealed each packet. Served over chicken flavored wild rice. Made a nice low fat healthy meal!

This was really good, and something different. I cubed the chicken, used 2 cans of tomatoes and about 1 cup of balsamic plus fresh garlic. We like alot of sauce, and it was tasty. Served it over whole wheat angel hair, yum!

Delicious!  I used 18+ year aged Balsamic which added a lovely flavor.  The only change I made was to use no salt added diced tomatoes due to low salt requirement here.  Served it with mashed potatoes and green peas.
Like another reviewer suggested, I added another can of diced tomatoes, more herbs, a bay leaf & balsamic, and reduced the sauce to serve the dish over pasta in the future.

This is one of our favorites. I mix the herbs with the tomatoes and vinegar in a large bowl first. I like to let it sit in the refrigerator for a little while before I use it. Very good recipe!

Outstanding but I ran into a few issues: 1) The chicken breasts were too large to be cooked in just 15 minutes, so the sauce and tomatoes/onions were getting close to burning. Since you're going to cut them up anyway at some point, might as well start out in cubes.  

Because my sauce was starting to burn, I poured in some white wine.  It did a fantastic job of taking the excessive tartness out of the balsamic vinegar while retaining the flavor of the vinegar in the dish.   I'd recommend reducing the vinegar by 1/4 and replacing the remainder with white wine.

My husband is in a food coma on the couch after eating his dinner portion, my leftovers, and his lunch leftovers. Oops.

Delicious! Hubby loves it, better than at a restaurant. Instead of 6 boneless breasts I had 4 large skin-on, bone-in breasts with some rib meat but just right for this recipe. Used real garlic and fresh herbs from the garden instead of dried, added some leftover fresh chopped tomato. Tender and tasty, after browning, simmered for about 1/2 hour because of the bones.  Next time, if I feel less lazy, will reduce the sauce down a bit. The browned onions start to caramelize. Yummy.

You definitely need to be a fan of balsamic vinegar to like this recipe.  We are, so we liked this quite a lot.  I used only four chicken breasts, but left the sauce ingredient measurements the same so there would be extra sauce to serve over rice.  I felt that the sauce needed a little something extra, so I followed the recommendation of a member on The Buzz and added some minced garlic and a couple Tbs of cream cheese.  I also added a bit of kosher salt.  The resulting sauce was fantastic over brown jasmine rice cooked in chicken broth.

Couldn't have been easier and tasted great. The balsamic does turn the dish into something special. I made a double batch and cut up the chicken, added zucchini & mushrooms. Versatile dish and great for a crowd.

Great Recipe; so healthy too!  Some people were complaining about the strong balsamic taste; I recommend making my version, which is diluted with chicken broth.  I threw everything from the recipe in my slow cooker, replacing the garlic salt with real garlic, adding in some mushrooms, and 2 cups of chicken broth, so it wouldn't burn.  You can either cook it for four hours on high or eight hours on low and it always turns out wonderfully (it makes your house smell super yummy too!).  It's easy and delicious, two of my favorite things!  This is now part of my regular recipe line up. Edit 8/22/15--This is also super easy when you pan-fry the chicken.  It does taste better when it's not made in the slow cooker.

I used to make a balsamic cream sauce with chicken (also from allrecipes) but after knowing how much butter and cream went into that dish, this one just feels much healthier and tastes even better! I don't change anything about this recipe, except that I've tried boneless skinless chicken thighs a couple times and been pretty happy with the results. I'll pour this over pasta. It reheats really well as leftovers too.

Made this as directed but my family did not like it, too vinegary and too many dried herbs.

Wonderful! We really enjoyed the flavors. I cooked the onions for a bit before I added the chicken, which I liked...more caramelized onions. I ended up using some leftover pasta sauce that we needed to use up, instead of the canned tomato. I don't feel like that drastically changed the recipe in a way that I would not be justified in reviewing the recipe... plus it's a nice tip for someone else who may be in the same position! Cooking for two can be annoying... lots of little leftovers of everything  :)

Very good according to my husband, and that's all I care...LOL. I followed the recipe and only added 1 teaspoon of brown sugar to tone down the balsamic. Served on a bed of whole grain rice. I'll make it again.

Best recipe ever! I followed the recipe exactly and it came out amazing. I don't usually like chicken dishes and my husband definitely doesn't but he said this is his new favorite chicken recipe. Not only does it taste great but it LOOKS great, which is really a plus. Anyone can make this and come off as a better cook than they really are.

This recipe is great! I make it on a weekly basis and it is a family favorite. It takes no time and the chicken stays nice and moist when cooking in the balsamic.

Loved this! The only modification I made was to use coconut oil to saute the onions first. Made a GREAT flavor with all of the other ingredients. Just take out the chicken and it's a great vegetarian dish over spaghetti squash.

My Friendship Diner forum friends and I chose this as our January Community Cook-along recipe. So far the we've several ratings from "I loved it" to "I didn't care for this at all." From my rating you can see where I stood on this. First of all, altho I truly like every one of the ingredients in this recipe, I felt none of them were team players. I tasted every ingredient separately instead of having them engage to create a tasty sauce. I'm a huge vinegar fan but I felt there was just way too much of it. My S.O. liked it better than I, so at least that was a plus. However, I thank you Moonandback because there were members on my forum who gave this one four and five stars and that makes me happy!

This was a bit too strong on the balsamic vinegar side for my tastes, but I think I might have made a measuring error. The taste was otherwise good and the chicken was tender. I served it over pasta. Just in case, I will start at 2 Tbsp, balsamic vinegar next time, and work my way up to the full half a cup as I taste the sauce. Because I found it too bvinegary, I looked online for a fix. I found a suggestion to add a pinch of baking soda at a time (stirring and tasting after each addition) to neutralize the vinegary taste. This worked quite well, so I thought I'd mention it in case anyone else has the same problem. It will fizz when you first add it, but just stir it in thoroughly.

This sauce is delicious.  I think it would be great on red meat.  The chicken was a bit dry and didn't really absorb the taste of the food.

I was concerned with the balsamic vinegar in this recipe (I stared at the measuring cup thinking that is a lot of vingar!) But, I am so glad I made it according to directions. I truly enjoyed it and was happy to find another twist on chicken that is healthy. Thank you for the recipe!

I really enjoyed making this recipe.  The taste was just like described.  I followed the advice of others and used a higher quality balsamic vinegar.  There is a big taste difference between the good one I boght for this and the one I had in my house.  I served the chicken over angel hair pasta.

I rating of the recipe is a bit missleading... most people are NOT following the recipe as it is written.  I followed the recipe as is and it does need tweaking.  Read other reviewers to help you decide what would be best for your version.   My #1 recommendation is to use WHITE balsamic vineger (if you have a Trader Joes you can find it there).  Also, the herbs are slightly too much you can cut back a little on the amount of each.

This was good, but not great. After reading SOOOO many stellar reviews, I was expecting much more than what we got. I followed the recipe exactly and we found it to be an "okay dinner"... Hubby & I were both in agreement on this one. (Would really give it 3 and a half stars if I could!)

This was pretty good! I ran out of balsamic vinegar and for a double batch of sauce ended up using about 1/4 cup balsamic and 2/3 cup of red wine vinegar. Kinda glad I did. I think the full amount of balsamic could have been a bit too overpowering.  Overall, a good dish and not too complicated.

Loved this recipe.  Very easy to make and has lots of flavor.  We used only 3 chicken breasts but followed to rest of the recipe exactly.  Served over spaghetti which made it a great one dish meal.

Although I didn't "love" this, I did like it a lot and would have rated it 4 stars if only going by my own taste. My boyfriend said it was good, but only ate one breast even though there was a half one left over and he normally has a very hearty appetite. And my adult daughter really didn't care for it at all, although she said it may just have been that she wasn't feeling that well. I suspect both of them were just being kind, and that neither really liked it that much. But I still give it 3 stars since I liked the tang of the vinegar and thought it had a lot of taste for what seemed like a healthy way to cook chicken.

Nothing special. It had potential with the strong ingredients like Balsamic Vinegar (which I'm a huge fan of), but felt like it was lacking something.

It was pretty good. I'm not a fan of balsamic vinigar, so i cut it in half as others suggested. I still could have lived without it, but then it would become another dish. Everyone ate it up with no complaints, but no rave reviews either. Definately quick and easy  to make.  5 WW plus points

Overall, I give this a 5 star rating.  It's a great recipe to make when boneless skinless chicken breasts are on sale for $1.99/lb.  I cooked this dish in a 12 inch Lodge cast iron skillet.  Like so many others, I recommend using only half the amount of balsamic vinegar.  4 oz of vinegar in my opinion is too overpowering for this recipe.  I cooked this with both the regular balsamic and white balsamic vinegar and both turned out very well.  With the exception of the basil which was added at the time of cooking, the other herbs were applied to the chicken several hours before hand and allowed to marinate.  I also like to have my share of veggies when eating, so I added diced bell peppers and mushrooms to the mix.  The peppers were added after the onions and the mushrooms were added at the very end.  I could have easily used a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes to the recipe.  Good with pasta or white rice.  Add some fresh grated Parmesan cheese to the top of the dish for additional flavor.  Personally, I love to add a big splash of hot sauce for some additional zip! Overall, it's a great recipe that requires minimal effort and time.  I'll definitely use this again and again.

Excellent. Used garlic powder and added sliced portobello mushrooms, diced green pepper and celery. Served with mushroom flavored rice. Took suggestion and used 1/4  cup balsamic and the rest chicken broth.

Very good!  I used chicken tender pieces rather than breasts.  Sauted crushed garlic before adding the chicken.  Also used mushrooms, asparagus, and a tsp of brown sugar.  I reduced the balsamic slightly.  Used canned diced tomatoes with basil seasoning already included.  To thicken the sauce at the end, I added a tbs of tomato paste.  And i served over pan fried egg wheat egg noodles.  I plan to serve the left overs over brown rice.

So quick, easy and good. I added mushrooms and minced garlic rather than garlic salt. My husband said he would order this in a restaurant. Very healthy too! Served with sugar snap peas and crusty bread to mop up all the juice.

This was delicious! Made it tonight, almost all gone with just me and the kids tonight! Wonderful flavor, I changed the servings to 4, and reduced the balsamic vinegar even more based on other reviews. It was easy and tasted fabulous!

We really enjoyed this.  I used half of the balsamic vinegar and substituted chicken broth for the remaining half.  I also added a tiny sprinkling of sugar and about two tablespoons of butter.

Fabulous!  I used 2 cloves of fresh garlic that I minced instead of garlic salt.  As another reviewer suggested, I cut my chicken breasts into about 1.5" chunks and dredge the chicken in flour, salt and pepper.  By doing this, the sauce thickened easily.  I also added approximately 1 lb. of mushrooms, a 1/2 cup of diced black olives, a can of quartered artichoke hearts, and about a 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes.   I used a 1/2 cup of balsamic vinegar and 1 cup of water.  During the last 5 minutes of cooking, I added a 1/2 teaspoon of capers, as the sauce needed a bit of salt and an additional 1/2 cup of pasta water.   Served this over pasta, although I think it would be equally good with rice or roasted potatoes and a salad.    My best friend's husband owns a restaurant and is looking for new entrees for specials, and after eating this dish with my modifications he said that he would like to serve this at his restaurant.

I made this in the crockpot, using boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  Omitted the olive oil, since I wasn't browning the onion and chicken.  Also omitted the garlic salt and used 2 cloves minced garlic instead.  Used 1/4 c. balsamic and 1/4 c. chicken broth as someone recommended instead of 1/2 c. balsamic. Placed the sliced onion in crockpot, put chicken on top (it was partially frozen still,) then mixed everything else together, adding 1 Tbsp. brown sugar and poured this over the chicken and cooked on low for 8 hours. After it was cooked, I thickened the sauce with 2 tbsp. cornstarch dissolved in 1/4 c. cold water.  Served it over brown rice.  It was delicious!  (Using the chicken thighs kept the chicken from drying out as mentioned in an earlier rating post.)  Definitely one I will make again, although I will leave out the brown sugar next time. My older daughter, who is also a fan of balsamic vinegar, loved this.

Made recipe exactly and this was easy to make and fairly good.  But the balsamic sauce (even with a very high quality vinegar) is still a little overpowering. I would definitely follow the other reviewers advice to mix half and half with a stock liquid.

Excellent recipe. I double the tomatoes, and use garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  I serve it over angel hair pasta.  This is a huge favorite around my house, I've made this many times, and I keep getting requests for more!

I don't understand the hype about this one. It was ok, but the sauce it created was watery, and I let it simmer for longer than even the recipe suggests.  I won't make this again.

I took the advice of some other posters and cooked this in the crock pot, with 1/4 c. balsamic and 1/4 c. chicken stock.  I also used fresh tomato instead of canned.  It came out really good, but next time I think I will use the full 1/2 c. balsamic.

we both enjoyed this recipe. i didn't think the vinegar taste was too strong probably b/c i didn't use too much of the sauce when serving this dish. i served over angel hair with a little bit of olive oil and some steamed green beans. i also used boneless skinless thighs and added some fresh mushrooms right at the end of cooking. tasted great. thanks so much....

TRY THIS!!!!  It is SOOOO EASY and it tastes like it's NOT!  Just to let you know what also works if you don't have some of the things on hand.  I used real garlic cloves instead of garlic salt and sauteed it with the onion.  I used 4 bone-in chicken breasts, and put them in the skillet skin down first, to brown them.  I turned the chicken back over once I added the other ingredients.  I used fresh oregano and rosemary.  I also used a can of STEWED TOMATOES instead of diced, which came out DELICIOUS.  ( I did NOT drain them) I let this cook while I got ready for work (maybe a half an hour to 45 mins since it had the bone in it), and it came out so good.  My husband LOVED it.  The balsamic cooked down with the tomatoes to make a GREAT sauce.  This is TOO EASY and TOO HEALTHY for you not to try!!!!

Fiance said this smelled a lot better than it tasted. Weird sweet/sour thing going on. I used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt and fresh chopped tomatoes and basil. Not going into the normal rotation.

Very good, but I agree with other reviews- don't add so much balsamic vinegar. I added the full amount because I love vinegar in general, but this was too much. But otherwise- excellent chicken; went well with rice.

Very good.  I used a tad less balsamic then called for and also added fresh garlic as others suggested.  I used 3 large Costco chicken breasts and left the sauce amounts the same.  Turned out very nice and moist, not too tart and I didn't use the brown sugar as others have said.  Served with mashed potatoes and creamed spinach from this site and it made a great well rounded meal.  By the way, the sauce amounts with using half the chicken called for was just barely enough to give extra on the top of the chicken and use for some potatoes as my hubby requires when i make any kind of sauce!!

I did not want to saute the chicken so I put the breasts in a baking dish greased with olive oil cooking spray.I sprinkled black pepper and garlic powder over them. Then I made the sauce as directed and poured it over the chicken. 45 minutes in a 375 degree oven and the breasts were juicy and tender. Absolutely delicious!

Soooo delicious!  It's also very easy and quick to make, which I love. I served ours with plain couscous and it was great, the sauce is perfect on the couscous.  I didn't (and wouldn't) change a thing. My husband, however, thinks the vinegar taste is way too strong (he tends to not like strong flavors like that) so if you're not in to tart, strong, vinegar flavor, I would reduce the amount of vinegar. For me though, it's perfect.

It is rare that I do not enjoy a highly rated recipe from this site. Actually this might be the first time. The balsamic was too strong & the tomatoes added to the overkill of acidy flavor. I will not make this one again.

This was fantastic meal!! My wife and I especially enjoyed the wonderfully rich flavor the balsamic vinegar gave to the chicken. My daughter, who eats like a bird, ate an entire chicken breast, which is a great testament to exactly how good this meal really was. Thank you!!

I had this last night for dinner.  I didn't have a lot of time to cook, and I didn't feel like making a trip to the supermarket.  Luckily, I had all the ingredients needed to make this delicious dish.  My mother stopped by and tried some...she hasn't stopped raving about it.  I plan on making this again and again.  I also think that steak would be a good substitue for the chicken if you wanted to make it a little fancier or for a special occasion.

Simple, quick, easy and best of all DELICIOUS!  I substituted fresh garlic, fresh chopped tomatoes instead of canned, and also added in some chopped mushrooms.  Served over rice.  Everyone loved it and there were no leftovers!  :)

This is a good recipe, however, I would omit the dry rosemary.  It is too overpowering.   The thyme, oregano, and basil is enough.   Using the herbs fresh is best and some fresh garlic.

Not one of my favorite recipes.  The husband didn't care for the tomatoes, and the flavor was a little bland.

Excellent!  Yes, the flavor is strong, so if you like mild or bland, skip this one.  The flavor really pops out at you and it is all Balsamic, but if you like Balsamic, you should really enjoy this chicken.  And super easy to make too!

Prior to making this recipe I was seen as a pretty good cook. Now though you may refer to me as a domestic goddess because this recipe was simply divine. As others suggested I used a tad less balsamic vinegar, cut my chicken into bite size pieces, browned my chicken/onion/bell pepper(added a 1/4 cup bp) with white wine, and added minced garlic to tomato mixture. I added cooked white rice to the mixture which absorbed additional sauce. (If you do this only use enough white rice to absorb sauce or it will be too dry.) I am new to cooking and this recipe was easy. Thanks!!!

This was wonderful for so many reasons.--1)Very Easy, 2)Smells glorious, 3)Looks incredible, 4)Tastes great--and not rhe same old chicken recipe.  I used diced roma tomatoes because I was out of canned and they worked wonderfully, in fact would recommend it over the canned variety.  I ended up making a 10 serving portion to bring to church and the oohs and ahhs were plentiful!!
Will make again soon.

Good recipe to try when you're looking for something a little different.  I wasn't sure I'd like the vinegar flavor, bit I did.  Served over whole wheat bow tie pasta and steamed broccoli for a healthy meal. **** Made again in the crockpot, and I don't recommend this method.  I think it allowed the vinegar to become even stronger.  I liked it in the skillet a lot better.

It's very rare that I read a new recipe and err so greatly.  By reading the recipe ingredients I felt that this would be appetizing.  I couldn't finish mine and my husband said not to rush to make it again.

Very good recipe. I'm a huge fan of balsamic vinegar, but even I thought it called for too much. I reduced the vinegar to 1/3 cup. I didn't want to use garlic powder so I sauteed the chicken with about 3 cloves of minced garlic... though it could have used more. I also added a half of a jar of marinated artichokes and a few portabello mushrooms. I served it over no yolk egg noodles tossed with a slight drizzle of olive oil and salt. This was packed with flavor and was very low fat. Will make again many times. Thanks!

Loved this recipe.  I think plain chicken is on the bland side and the tomatoe, onions and balsamic vinegar added so much to the flavor.  It also made the chicken very tender.  Will use it often.

My husband and I both liked this. I cut the chicken up into smaller pieces (each half breast into fourths) to make the chicken cook more quickly, help it stay moist, and to heighten the flavor. I wasn't sure about using 1/2 cup of the vinegar but tried it and it turned out great (even to a non vinegar person like me). I served the chicken over angel hair pasta. Very nice.

Did a few things differently. Used 1 can tomatoes but whizzed in blender, added 1 8oz can t. sauce, 1/2 all spices but rosemary
simmered longer. Served over pasta, very good flavor. I think those who said it smelled "funny", didn't let it simmer long enough. My husband HATES all vinegar and he liked this.

This was pretty good.  There's a sort of "adobo" flavour, with the tomato and vinegar.  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs cut into chunks, and added coarsely chopped green peppers.  My first thought when tasting it was "Cacciatore meets Escabeche!"  I served it over jasmine rice.  My guy liked the dish a lot.  I made a large batch, and I think I will serve the leftovers with a peruvian-style ceviche appetizer.

This recipe was really good, but instead of balsamic vinegar, I slightly altered it and used 1/4 cup of red wine vinegar, freshly diced garlic, and two large fresh tomatoes. the result was a thicker sauce with stronger flavor. I loved it!

Delicious! My husband thought it could be served at the fanciest restaurant in  town.  We loved the sauce and thought was only enough for 4 breasts. I may add a little bit less vinegar next time, but otherwise loved it!! Great with rice. Thanks for the recipe.

I thoroughly enjoyed it and so did my family. I had members, who don't normally go back for seconds, go back for seconds.

I nearly overcooked the chicken but that was my error. The only alteration was that I added the slightest amount of salt to taste at the end. Other than that, this dish was fabulous and I would have to make it again.

I put all the ingredients in the crockpot on low for 6 hours.  I added more balsamic vinegar and a bit of water to total 1 full cup of liquid.  I kept all  other proportions the same as in the recipe.  We served this over fettucine noodles and it was excellent.  Will definitely make again.

Wow, this chicken was something else ! Firstly, the instructions were really on point. I knew to wait till the onions were nice and brown and then to wait for the sauce to dry a bit. And then came the taste- awesome!! And to think their was no flour or any definite starch in it !  Served with romaine lettuce, roasted balsamic eggplant and mushrooms as I did not want the starch side.

One of my new favorite recipes! I was able to make it with ingredients I had on hand, and it took less than 30 minutes. My picky husband and four year old had seconds! I served this over farfalle pasta. I used crushed tomatoes because that's what I had on hand. Reminiscent of a nice bread dip. This will definitely be in our regular rotation!

Great, easy recipe.  Took the chicken out of the pan while cooking the onions.  Trying to be careful not to overcook the chicken.  Will definitely make again.

This was very good with my adjustments, Hence the 4 stars. I read A LOT of the reviews before I made it.  I think this recipe was meant to be made with 'good',  i.e. aged, VERY expensive  balsamic vinegar, which IS NOT  that tart, and is kind of sweet. The less expensive balsamic is  nothing more than a fortified 'red wine vinegar', which may be why so many reviewers found this too 'vinegar-ee'. I'm not wealthy so I had the less expensive balsamic  and reduced it slightly on the stove before application.  Then basically followed the recipe, with the following changes, based on many of the reviews:  1/4 cup reduced balsamic with 1/4 cup water;  I just couldn't justify opening up a 32oz box of stock for a 1/4 cup. Added about 2 tsps brown sugar and about 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes ( I like spicy) to the 'sauce' which I mixed in a separate bowl first.  I also added about 1/2 cup diced sweet red bell pepper and added a drained 4oz can of sliced mushrooms to the onion sauté. I know that this is a lot of changes, and that many people get annoyed that a modified review is actually reviewing that person's changes and NOT the authors original recipe, and I used to agree with that.  However, I've gotten sooo many good tips, advice and opinions from said reviews and changes, that I've changed my mind. All  of my modifications came from the reviews I read, and I've been cooking for 45+ years.  You're never too old to learn.  Just had a dish of my finished recipe

This was delicious! I blended all the ingredients for the sauce together (I have picky eaters in my household). I slightly browned the chicken in a dutch oven for about a minute a side, poured the sauce over top and then put it in the oven at 325 for 45 minutes. (My husband had called and said he'd be late from work. Otherwise I would have made it as written)
It worked out so well in the oven! I didn't cover it and a lot of liquid evaporated. It was a beautiful, thick sauce that was great over brown rice. The chicken was so tender we could cut it with a fork!

***Edit - I have made this multiple times now in the slow cooker! Just throw everything in and leave it on low for a few hours. Turns out amazing!! I can't get enough of this sauce!

Tried this recipe tonight based on the good reviews.  It was excellent, modified only slightly!  I followed other suggestions to use 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar and then 1/4 cup chicken broth.  Added mushrooms to the mix with the onions.  Otherwise, I did everything else.  Served it over bowtie pasta and a side of asparagus.  Would definitely make this dish again!!!

I tried this recipe, I changed it a little....I took two whole chicken breast diced them, prepared a little differently instead of garlic salt I minced a medium size clove of garlic and pepper. I also did as suggested by "Harpo" Nov 22, 2006  I used 1/4 cup of chicken broth and 1/4 Balsamic Vinegar. I sautéed 5 Brown Baby Bella Crimini Mushrooms (sliced removed stems)in butter in separate small fry pan with a little pepper for flavoring. I added these after they turned brown and I already added all other ingredients as cited above. I also served over Farfalle Pasta after straining I poured melted butter and minced garlic small glove.... and Garlic French Bread ....I'm glad I found this site, my household truly enjoyed this dish. I also only used 1/2 onion not to overwhelm the dish this easily serves a hearty portion for 4.

Very good!  I used a good, sweet balsamic and think that made a big difference.  also added some freed mushrooms and asperragus  at the end.  Great served over angle hair pasta!  Worthy of making for company in the future.

Made this recipe for dinner for my boyfriend and I. We both liked it, but I thought it was very vinegar-y. The balsamic vinegar tasted good but was too strong for my taste. I will make it again but will use less vinegar.

The chicken turned out dry and it wasn't anything special to me.  I do like balsamic so that wasn't the issue.  My kids didn't like it much, so that's a huge factor.

I cooked this in a crock pot. But I changed some things: 

I used garlic and onion diced tomatoes
No garlic salt, but I used fresh garlic
Fresh herbs of those that were called for
I added chicken stock
I used half a bunch of kale
A handful of small fingerling potatoes
A package of mushrooms, whole

I cooked on high for four hours, low for three. 

It was yummy. 

I give your original recipe 4 stars as well. Used it many times but baked in the oven. I did this as something a little different and just kept adding things because they were there and needed to be used up :)

2015: This recipe was good.  I used half the amount of balsamic vinegar and added just a teeny bit of honey on top of the chicken, so that it would be sweet.  Will probably make again. -  4 star

-Update in 2017: I made this again, using the full amount of balsamic and no honey.  The only change was that I added a small can of mushrooms to the pan near the end of cooking.  Perfect meal with some homegrown green beans as a side.  Also easy, quick and convenient.  Will certainly make it again.  Everyone in our house loved it, including my dad who isn't always big into the balsamic.

Just made this. U must be in love with balsamic vinegar to enjoy this dish!! I added cinnamon, a little sugar, and some tomato sauce to tone down the vinegar a bit and baked on 350 for about an hour. It's looks absolutely delicious and tasted incredible. I'm serving it with a avocado cranberry salad and risotto.

Super easy and tasty!  I didn't have Rosemary, so I subbed 1/4 tsp marjoram and 1/4 tsp sage. I also reduced the balsamic vinegar to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup chicken broth.  I browned 6 chicken breasts and removed them from the pan so I could sauté the onions and deglaze the pan with appx 2-4 Tbsp additional chicken broth. I also added 2 cloves minced garlic.  Served with rice and garnished with Parmesan cheese which really made flavors pop. Very happy to have another quick, gluten free recipe to add to my family recipe arsenal. Kudos.

Very easy to make, and very tasty!  Ended up using 1/2 cup vinegar and only drained the tomatoes halfway. Halfway through cooking the onions, I threw in some mushrooms.
I definitely will make this again.

This was really good. I mixed the tomatoes, balsamic, and spices together in a bowl and let them sit for about an hour before pouring them over the chicken, which gave the tomatoes time to soak up the balsamic vinegar.

Very acidic dish. I love balsamic but it definitely needs to be reduced from the original recipe. I might try this again with less balsamic. The only other change I made was to cube the chicken, eliminate the onions, and used fresh garlic.

It was good--I'd make it again! I found it lacking in flavor though. I suggest adding a bit more herbs to the chicken before browning it. I also added baby portobello mushrooms, and they turned out amazingly! 

Lastly, increase the amount of thyme, rosemary, oregano, and basil you use! Add fresh garlic to the onions when you brown them.

It pairs well with angel hair pasta and green beans.

ADD ONLY 1/4 cup OF THE BALSAMIC, AND ADD 1/4 cup chicken or vegetable broth! I followed this suggestion from another user, and it was AMAZING. If I used all the balsamic vinegar the recipe suggests, I think it would have been much too sour. I also substituted the garlic salt for 2 cloves finely chopped garlic. Absolutely delicious - better than restaurant quality! 
If you love mushrooms, I think those would go well in the sauce too.

I made this in the crockpot, which made it even easier and maybe even more delicious. - still browned the chicken, then deglazed the pan with about 1/3 cup water. Add chicken and water to the crock pot and dump everything else on top. Cooked for 4 hours on high, and the breasts were just barely hanging together when I took them out. Beautiful!

I've made this twice. The first time, I did half chicken stock, half balsamic vinegar, as some reviews said. The second time, I forgot the balsamic vinegar completely. My wife significantly preferred the second serving. I liked them both. I write this to affirm what others have said about the balsamic vinegar. If you like balsamic vinegar, great, make it as written. If not, no worries, just don't add it and it will still be awesome.

I was very skeptical about the balsamic vinegar but I still used it in this recipe and I loved it. I just cut the chicken into smaller pieces and went with the exact instructions. Made red potatoes as my side dish and my family loved it !!! Will definitely be making it again.

Love this recipe!  Braising has become my new favorite method for preparing delicious chicken.  This is a diet recipe that is so good that you'll even make it when you're not dieting.  My husband loves it, too!

Excellent! I followed the recipe for two servings. As far as the amount of balsamic vinegar I added 2 tbsp and 1 tsp and it was perfect!

I liked this dish but I would definitely tweak it next time around.  The only issue I had are: the chicken was way over cooked although i did remove it before the time suggested and I think there is too much thyme in the recipe.  I forgot the basil so I dont know if that would of added flavor.  Fresh garlic would be better too.
After I stated simmering the chicken and sauce i started reading the reviews and panicked because I thought it would possibly be too "vinegary."  I added a teaspoon of sugar to the simmering sauce and it was fine.  
I served this chicken on a bed of fresh baby spinach with fettuccine and green beans.  I topped the chicken and pasta with the sauce.

Tonight was the second time making this dish and it is super! Both times I did not have balsamic vinegar, but I did have a balsamic vinegrette. I used that iso vinegar(white, red wine or apple cider is what I have). The smell is heavenly. The taste divine. Nice and tangy.

Totally delicious as is!  I did change 1 ingredient, only because we are on a low sodium diet.  I changed the garlic salt from 1 tsp to 1/2 tsp and added 1/4 tsp garlic powder.  That's it!  Absolutely delicious if you like balsamic vinegar.

This was alright.  I've been experimenting with recipes that have lots of flavor (to make up for the fact that I can't eat dairy), and this one certainly had a lot of flavor.  If you're not much of a balsamic fan, though, this might not suit your tastes.  I'm okay with balsamic, but I have to say it was a pretty tangy dish.  My family sprinkled cheese on theirs and liked it that way.

I made this today with roasted potatoes,and will make it again! I had to cook the breasts 3 at a time so I divided the vinegar up. It's a nice change up, and looks and tastes good. Thanks for sharing.

I used a maple honey balsamic vinegar which gave the dish some sweetness.  To save on dirty pans, I added some fresh spinach.  Very good.

Super simple and full of flavor. I wanted something that would be quick and easy to prepare after a long day at work. This dish more than met those requirements. My husband wanted even more vinegar flavor, so I may add more balsamic next time I make this dish.

I just made this. It was very tasty!  I simmered it for about 30 mins thou so the sauce really thickened up. I would suggest using 1/3 balsamic to 2/3 chicken stock or water. It's got a strong flavour.

This tastes SO DELICIOUS! I used a little bit of dried chicken broth (2 tbsp.) and omitted the garlic salt but added about a cup of crushed garlic to the chicken before Browning. My family said it tasted almost as good as TGIFridays recipe of Balsamic Chicken! Thank you for such a Wonderful recipe! :)

My Family of 4 Loved this!... the only thing I did Change was used half the Balsamic Vinegar and the other half with Chicken Broth. I also Added another Can of diced tomatoes. We love tomatoes, and wanted to make sure there was plenty to poor over our Chicken and bed of Rice. The whole family loved it and we will definitely be making this again and again!

Amazing!  Easy.  Big hit with my friends.  Key is to use high quality balsamic vinegar (I used 18 year), not the cheap grocery store kind. I cut the boneless chicken breasts in half as they were quite large. Since I was entertaining, I browned the chicken and onions earlier in the day, mixed in rest of ingredients and simmered prior to serving.  A definite keeper!

Easy to make and tasty. I used thighs because I don't like white meat. I covered the pa initially because I was afraid it wouldn't cook through. The recipe makes good use of spices and is very flavorful.  After sitting overnight the balsamic was a little intense

Just finished this for dinner.  Loved it!  Took another reviewers suggestion and served it with garlic mashed potatoes
 and green beans, all went well together.  For my adjustments, I used only 1/4 cup balsamic, omitted the garlic powder and used two cloves of minced garlic instead, & used fresh rosemary.  The favors were wonderfully tangy and sweet.  The sauce reduced nicely.  Being the first time to make this I used a slotted spoon to put the tomatoes and onion over chicken not wanting to put too much sauce on.  After the first bite my husband and I went back to spoon the sauce over the chicken and potatoes.  An easy, quick & yummy weeknight dish.

This recipe is AMAZING!  I made it for the family at the cottage and the reviews were over the top - my normally picky nephew exacts words was "that it rocked".  The only thing that I did to improve the texture of the chicken to make it more juicy was the following and the results were very positive.  I braised the chicken breasts for a few minutes on each side and then transferred the chicken, and added all the ingredients into a large baking dish and baked it for 30 minutes at 350. After letting it sit for 10 minutes, I then took each of the chicken breasts and cut them at an angle into diagonal medium sizes pieces and served on a platter in the sauce.  Cutting at an angle can add moistness to chicken breasts and allows the favor of the sauce to penetrate....plus easier to serve to kids and larger groups.

My husband loved this recipe, but I found all the dried herbs to be overpowering. I will make it again, but I will use mostly fresh herbs and less oregano. I felt it needed some sweetness, maybe from sweet, fresh basil, or something. I think I just need to play with the flavors, but the recipe was super easy! 
Also, we added onions and mushrooms to the sauce, and those were yummy! Serve with rice or something to soak up all the yummy sauce!

I absolutely love this recipe! I use a peach balsamic, and the sweetness really compliments the spices in this recipe. The only thing that I do differently is cut the chicken into bite sized pieces. I season the chicken a few hours before so that the chicken has more flavor. I never knew that I liked balsamic until I made this recipe. I made it a few days ago and my husband ate all the leftovers, so I made it again today. It's so good!

I just made this tonight and it was delicious.  The kids loved it too.  It was quick, easy and very flavorful.  I halved the recipe and it turned out great.  This would be great with a side of mashed potatoes.  I will be making this one again!

The Hubs and I both really enjoyed this.  Added julienned red and orange bell pepper, whole mini baby bella mushrooms, and zucchini circles with the onions, for extra veggies.  Served it with rice pilaf (made w/chicken stock), which went surprisingly well together.  Also subbed a 48oz. can of whole peeled tomatoes for the diced. -WWW

I loved it! My brother was not a big fan, but his opinion is based on what he is use to. I like to try new things. This was a good choice. I did use crushed tomato sauce instead of chopped tomatoes. Next time I will cube the chicken and serve over pasta.

Made this for the family and everyone liked it.  I LOVED IT! I used chopped garlic as some others suggested and I also mixed the spices in with the vinegar and tomatoes as suggested.  Next time I will probably add more tomatoes and vinegar to make a little more "sauce".  Overall..I will make again.

The flavors in this recipe are wonderful if you use a good quality canned tomato and balsamic vinegar.  The spices blend perfectly with the vinegar and tomatoes.  Cooking wise, the time is WAY off for braising.  Braising is low and slow - in the alloted time, my chicken was super tough and even doubling the time only helped a bit.  Next time I'll use a more normal braising method but use the ingredients because flavor-wise, this is fantastic.

I LOVED this and I am not a big tangy or weird flavored type of eater but, this was light and perfect. The tomatoes, onions, everything made this a healthier way to eat chicken with a hint of flavor that wasn't full of salt or grease! I will def make again, my grandma and dad loved it as well! I made green beans and rice as the sides, worked out great.

Our family loves balsamic and chicken, so a great match for us, this recipe is delicious and easy!!  I have modified it for us by adding baby portabella mushrooms to steam on top (time to cook depends on how soft one likes their mushrooms).  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

THIS was the best homemade chicken i have ever made!!! delicious!!
i used the italian stewed tomatoes as some one else mentioned and wasnt sure about using the juice, but definitely use it! it adds so much flavor!! and the chicken comes out so tender and juicy. however, my chicken took about 8-10 min, so keep an eye on your chicken ;) some pieces came out slightly over cooked but still delicious. my hubby was very impressed!! 
i also added a little bit of ground oregano and kept the rosemary and thyme (omitting the other spices since i used the italian stye which had the oregano and basil)
definitely going in the make often recipe box!!
thank you so much for a great recipe!!

Quick, simple, tasty.  A great recipe to make during the week.  Didn't change anything (left out rosemary as we didn't have any) and thought the flavors were nice.  Served with some quinoa, and would definitely make again.  Thanks for a solid recipe!

Definite five stars for labor/taste ratio! This was quite easy and straightforward. I substituted fresh cherry tomatoes because I don't like the taste of canned tomatoes. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly, but when I checked the meat after 15 minutes the top side was still quite pink, so I turned them and kept cooking for another 10 minutes or so. Make sure to spoon the braise over the meat every few minutes so they stay moist. Delicious! I'll definitely make again.

This dish received mixed reviews at my house.  My husband did not like it.  He said the sauce was way too strong for the chicken.  I liked the dish, but I agree it is a strong taste.  He said I could make it twice a year.  At least it didn't get the dreaded response of only once a year, which is his code for don't ever make this again!

Only reason I did not give this a 5 is because of the changes that I made to the recipe.  I do not like to use ingredients out of a can if fresh ingredients are available.  I used all fresh ingredients.  Instead of the can of tomatoes, I diced 6 fresh tomatoes and added some fresh juiced tomato juice to add to the sauce.  I used fresh garlic and fresh herbs.  The meal turned out to be fantastic and when served with some steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes, it was very well rounded.  Hubby loved it, although the kids passed because it was very "brown".  Will make this again.

Great recipe.  I loved it.  I used some bone in chicken thighs since I had them on hand, so I had to cook a bit longer, so added some broth to keep it going longer.  Thank you for sharing.

Excellent way to prepare chicken.  Since I was multi-tasking and the chicken pieces were HUGE, after browning the chicken and onions, I put everything into a baking dish and finished it in the oven at 350 for 40 minutes (covered with foil).  It was perfect!

This was so good! I did used fresh herbs and marinaded the chicken with the herbs and olive oil for 2 hours before cooking. I also added a can of tomato sauce. I pureed the "sauce" so my husband would eat it. We both ate it up, yum yum! You won't be disappointed.

Delicious. Made this with fresh tomatoes instead and only used 3 chicken breasts. I used the Great Value Balsamic Vinegar brand from Walmart and it turned out great.

Made this tonight and we loved it! It was quick and easy! I made it with the Parsleyed Rice Pilaf recipe from this site and steamed carrots and it was great! I would highly recommend this recipe.

Will make again, but will reduce the balsamic vinegar to 1/4 cup.  Little bitter.  But good.

This is an excellent dish! I was a little bit concerned, because all I had was a cherry balsamic (wasn't sure how that would turn out) but it's actually quite good that way.

I have made this recipe several times and it is ALWAYS GOOD!  The chicken is always moist and juicy and it has a wonderful flavor.  I let the balsamic mix simmer a bit longer to allow it to reduce.  Then, I usually pair it with garlic mashed potatoes.  SO GOOD.  Definitely a favorite in my house.

Not a fan.  15 minutes was too long for chicken tenders.  I only braised for 10 minutes and the chicken came out overcooked.  Also, this recipe requires way too much seasoning.  I would prefer maybe only using basil in the sauce next time.  It was too busy and my kids didn't love it.

YUM!  This was so good!  I did add mushrooms after I added the tomatoes and instead of garlic salt I chopped fresh garlic instead (about 3 cloves).  I had a box of quick parm pasta and this was great!  It reminds me of a Lean Cuisine meal that I love, but have never been able to duplicate.  Thanks so much for sharing!  This will be a keeper!

I really enjoyed this dish, but the vinegar was a little too assertive for my husband. He didn't actively dislike it, so I'll probably make it occasionally. We had it over mashed potatoes, which was a nice textural compliment.

Amazing!  I made it with chicken tenders (on sale this week).  I used 2 cloves fresh garlic (grated with microplane, added during step 2) and seasoned chicken with salt and pepper.  I cooked onion first, removed from pan, cooked chicken, added rest of ingredients and stirred to combine before simmering.  I used 1 Tbsp Italian seasoning instead of the other spices (similar flavor profile, lazy cook).  I will make this again and again.  I am going to try varying the spices and using white balsamic vinegar to change it up (only because I may be making this once a week).  What a great recipe!  Very easy to make and great flavor!

I am on Weight Watchers and my husband is a very picky eater...this is a definate recipe I'm keeping.  He loved it, and it was low point value for me.  Only thing I will do different next time is using McCormick's Italian Seasoning which has all of the seasoning in the recipe but in 1 bottle.  Well done!!!!

EASY AND DELICIOUS!  I made mine exactly as the recipe said besides without the onion, because I do not like onions.  It was phenomenal and had tons of flavor.  My husband LOVED it, he said I could eat this every night!  It was very fragrant and made the entire house smell good!  This one is a keeper!

I used Italian stewed tomatoes (cut up a bit) in place of plain diced, 3/4 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp granulated garlic in place of the 1 tsp garlic salt, and halved the thyme (because all I had was ground). I replaced half of the vinegar with red wine once, bit I much preferred the balsamic tang of the original; might be good with just a little wine mixed in instead of replacing so much of the vinegar. Mushrooms would be an awesome addition and I think I'll try that next time, maybe with the chicken cut up first as per a few reviews; it would be easier to eat with pasta that way. This has definitely made the rotation.

Not really what I was hoping for. Balsamic vinegar wasn't the problem, but rather the spices. I'm not a huge fan of being able to feel the texture of the spices. I thought that the spices would soften, but it didn't happen.

This was very tasty. The chicken turned out so moist which does not happen for me. The only thing I did not like was that the balsamic viniger had a sweet taste and it was a little too sweet.

We really love this!  It was fast, easy and so good!  I didn't have any vinegar in the house for somer reason so used some Sherry instead.  It was excellent!  Will definitely make this again.  I served with a brown rice blend and green beans.

This was a good dish. I made this in the crock pot with bone in chicken, after I followed step 1, but other than changing the way it was cooked and the type of chicken, I kept all the ingredients the same. We will make this again.

I had to modify this recipe a little based on what I had on hand, but not enough to really change the flavor.  My husband and I both loved it.  A keeper.

I made this according to directions, but layed it over rice... it was just ok.. it was VERY VERY tomatoey, (I recommened ommiting the tomato), its a very overwhelming tomato taste and taste like your eatting spaghetti.Has great potential... but eh... im gonna try this again with out the tomato... ( i think it would aslo be better cut into strips and wrapped in tortilla shell with lettuce onion and peppers with a lil bit of motz cheese... (of course made with out the tomato, and minced garlic instead of salt)

used  1/2 cup chicken broth and1/4 cup balsamic vinegar because I thought it would be too strong for the family.  Hubby liked it, I did too.  Maybe make again with no chicken broth.

My family felt that the vinegar was too overpowering!  I will make this again but will follow the suggestion made by other reviewers to cut down the vinegar to one half and to add 1/4- cup chicken broth and possibly some sugar to calm down the taste for our preferences. I tried this the second time with half  of the balsamic vinegar and a few dashes of sugar (to taste). It was just right!!!

Delicious, easy, and almost had everything in the house! Used fresh rosemary and omitted the basil (as I didn't have) and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, but it was still d-lish!!! As I was only making a serving for 2, I didn't feel like opening a whole can of tomatoes for only a portion of the can, so I used 1 garden fresh tomato, diced, and if anything, it was probably better! Will definitely make again!

You have to like the balsamic flavor to enjoy this chicken. It has lots of flavor and is great served with pasta.

This was DELISH!!!  very simple to make, and very tasty.  my 3 kids devoured it and had seconds!
I added mushrooms to the onion mixture (because I had them on hand), and served with a side of sauteed spinch and a side of pasta (for the kids). This dish will be going in to my regular rotation, and would also be nice to serve for guests.  It is very pretty when presented in a large serving dish.

I really enjoyed this dish and I am always looking for a low calorie meal so this was great for me; however, my husband did not like the balsamic taste. I added mushrooms to this dish and served with a side of mashed potatoes and garlic bread, super yummy! I followed others suggestions and diluted the balsamic in chicken broth (1/4 cup balsamic:1/4 cup chicken broth, and added a tablespoon of brown sugar. I think 1/2 cup of balsamic would be a little too overpowering. I also mixed all the ingredients for the sauce in a separate bowl before pouring it onto the chicken. I only added a small dash of rosemary and used fresh oregno and removed before serving. My only complaint was that the sauce was very thin.

It was ok...  I ended up with a LOT of very thin sauce.  The rosemary really overpowered the dish.  I won't make this again.

Really, really good!  I cut the chicken in cubes and put over some egg noodles.  The sauce was good on the noodles. My chicken got a bit dried out, but that is my fault.  I also used some chicken broth in place of 1/2 of the balsamic, which added great flavor.  Will definitely make again!

I really liked this dish. It was the perfect weekday dinner very easy to make. I was worried that the balsamic vinegar would be to strong, but it added the perfect amount of flavor. I did decide to add mushrooms to it. I will definitely make this again.

Very yummy! DEFINITELY use high quality balsamic though!! I bought an expensive one, and compared in it against a cheap brand that we happened to have at home, and the cheap stuff had an extra sweet taste/smell that definitely would have killed the dish. Spring for the expensive balsamic, you won't regret it!

I made this for my family and it was only okay.  I thought that it had too much of a vinegar taste that overpowered the tomatoes, so I would use about 1/3 cup instead of 1/2 cup.

I have made this dish probably a dozen times and just realized I never rated it.  This dish ALWAYS turns out great and is requested often!  The recipe is very forgiving on ingrediants too.  Tonight I used dried onions instead of fresh and added mushrooms - and served over wheat pasta.  Yum!  I frequently add chopped garlic too.  This dish is excellent over brown rice - adds so much flavor.  If you like basalmic vingegar even a little bit, you will love this recipe.  Make sure you brown your chicken first to make sure it stays moist after simmering.

I give this recipe 4 stars because it's a quick & easy week night dish with ingredients that you probably always have available.  I'll probably season it more and serve with a mild grated cheese the next time.

We actually reduced this for 2 servings but probably did not reduce the sauce enough, so about half way through eating it the sauce got a tad overwhelming. I would actually recommend with potatoes to help absorb some of the sauce. Also, we are not huge Rosemary fans, so we will back off on it next time. With some personal tweaking this is a great and easy add to the recipe box for a flavorful chicken so we will be using this recipe again!

Followed this to a "T" except I used minced garlic rather then garlic salt.  AND I put it all in a crock pot, on low for 4-5 hours.  Turned out PERFECTLY delish.

It was great over pasta and I will make it again that way. However not so good as a side dish.
So I have made this 3 or 4 times the last two times it was just way too vinegary.  I decided I didn't like it so much, and the hubby doesn't want me to make it again.

FANTASTIC! I read some other reviews and decided to reduce the balsamic vinegar to 1/4 Cup and I mixed that with 1/2 cup chicken broth. I then added all the spices to the liquid mix and added it to the chicken all together. I topped that off with the can of diced tomatoes and let it simmer for about 25 min. I made brown rice for a side dish. It was so good. I will make this again!!

You really should mix the balsamic and herbs with the diced tomatoes in the beginning so it can marinate.  Fantastic dish.

split balsamic with 1/2 chicken stock ans 1/2 balsamic.  chicken was very tender, though lacking flavor a little.  good week night chicken dish.  Added crimini mushrooms the 2nd time and liked it.

Edible, but not delicious. I love balsamic, but the flavor in this dish just wasn't very good. I followed the directions exactly and the end result was unexpectedly bitter. Strong vinegar flavor, strong oregano flavor and dried out chicken. If I do try making this again, I will make sure to use top notch vinegar as one reviewer suggested. I will also cut back on the spices (especially the oregano). Finally, I will check the chicken after 10 minutes of cooking since the breasts were overcooked at 15. Sorry I can't rave about this recipe. I'm glad so many others have enjoyed it.

Follwed others adviced and cut back on the balsamic and upped the broth.  Used canned tomatoes with Italian seasonings and scrapped the rest of the herbs.  Great easy dish!

This recipe is great, my family raved over it! I had to used sliced stewed tomatoes instead of the diced ones, but that didn't make any difference in terms of taste. If I could do it differently, I would put in 1/3 cup of balsamic vinegar and the rest chicken broth, because I thought it was a bit strong (though my family doesn't want me to dilute it, they love it how it is!). The wide opinion among my tasters is also that it tastes better over the pasta instead of the rice, though the suggestion for pairing it with mashed potatoes sounds REALLY good. Thanks, this is a keeper!

I made this for my Husband (not a chicken fan)and his parents. Everyone raved about how amazing this dish was.  Based on previous reviews I made a few minor changes: I added a little minced garlic while browning the onions. I used about 1/3 cup of the balsamic vinegar and topped it off with a little chicken broth to make the 1/2 cup measurement. I also used a pre-blended Italian seasoning instead of those listed as that was what was already on hand and left the rosemary out, only because I do not care for its flavor. I served the dish with green beans and seasoned potatoes (using a Grocery store seasoning packet) baked in the oven. This was a fabulous dinner!

Too much balsamic vinegar, besides the fact the finished dish was not attractive with the dark brown muddy sauce, the balsamic overpowered all the spices that were added. If I were to try this again I would start with a tablespoon at a time of the balsamic plus this heavy of a sauce I think boneless chicken thighs would be better but there are so many chicken recipes I'll just try some others.

This was really good. I remember eating this as a child when my grandmother would make it with pork chops minus the balsamic vinegar. I have made it with chicken and and turkey cuts. Although I really like it with the vinegar I will use half of what is suggested in the recipe.

I did use only 1/4 cup of the balsamic vinegar and it was delicious. I also grated fresh romano cheese on top. This is so easy and yet looked and tasted like I could have been in a restaurant.  Great recipe.

Delicious! I was surprised that my 4-year-old grand-daughter asked for seconds of rice covered in the sauce with, "More onions please!". So I guess it's obvious, we had rice on the side :) The flavors are wonderful together.

GREAT!!! It's much better with Bone-In Breast!!! Bake Breast 45 mins, drain, cut 1/2. Drain tomatoes, up Vinegar to 2/3, mix all ingredients then simmer on stove to poured over cooked breast, simmer in oven 30+ mins at lower heat in tight fitting pan and cover w/ foil. My 9 yrs olds + hubby loved it more with bone breast over boneless.  Breasts taste better the longer they sit the sauce. A KEEPER!!  Great with Rice...use extra sauce/juice to top rice...might want to increase sauce.

This was awesome! I made it for my entire family and everyone loved it. It was a little too watery, not sure what I did there. I doubled the recipe and it served 7 with only a little leftover. I also cut the balsamic vinegar wayyyy down from 1 cup to 1/3 of a cup. I can't imagine putting the whole thing in. I served it with just regular pasta with olive oil and a little garlic salt. It was delish! I will definitely make it again!! :)

I loved this recipe.  I was worried my kids wouldnt and they did.
I pulled the chicken apart and put over egg noodles with a slice of garlic toast and i added mushrooms too.  
MMMMMM it was good.

I am trying to cut out excessive amounts of sodium plus I needed something easy and different, and this recipe fills the bill on all points. I used plenty of Mrs. Dash Salt-Free Table Blend and garlic powder on the chicken pieces (cut into strips) before browning in an oven-proof skillet along with the onion in 1 T olive oil and 1 T butter. I mixed no-salt added tomatoes with only 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, the herbs and, on a last minute whim, 2 tsp. brown sugar. I then poured this mixture over the chicken and put the skillet in the oven at 350 for about 20 minutes while I made rice. Since I only used 3 large chicken breasts halves, I had quite a bit of sauce, so next time I will add a couple of sliced yellow squash to the skillet along with the onion. Thanks for posting this, Moonandback!

I have used dozens of recipes off this site - this is the first that I have ever written a review for.  AWESOME dish.  I did as other reviewers suggested and cut the vinegar by half, since we didn't want as much tang to it.  Did add garlic during the browning, mushrooms and parmesan on the last 5 minutes. Absolutely delicious!  Served with risotto, steamed green beans and garlic bread.  Family loved it, quick and easy to make.  DH said to make sure and make it again.

With the exception of excluding the rosemary and thyme, I made this as is, and it was delicious! It was a big hit with my family including a 10 year old and will be included in the meal rotation. It is easy, healthy, and I always have these ingredients on hand.

LOVE this recipe. The first time I made it and served it over pasta. I loved the chicken but decided it would be better as a bruschetta. So, this time around I served it with the chicken cut up small and spooned over toasted baguette slices covered with provolone (to keep the balsamic chicken juice from soaking into the bread and therefore keeping it crispy). It was delicious this way!! Try it!

I only realized after I'd started the recipe that I didn't have balsamic vinegar on hand so I used equal parts of molasses and lemon juice and it turned out beautifully. I think using the balsamic substitution made it just as good but I will try with the original balsamic next time tyo compare.

So good and so easy! I cut the oregano and thyme and increased the rosemary. I also added a little lemon juice and brown sugar. My husband loved it!

My husband and I invited friends for dinner on short notice and I needed a recipe that didn't require a trip to the store. I was able to pull this together with pantry items and it was a hit. I made several adjustments but the result was amazing! I used fresh rosemary and substituted some pre-made pesto since I didn't have any basil on hand.  I also cut the vinegar to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup vegetable stock. The sauce was a bit tangy so I added about a tbsp of sugar to balance the flavor. Finally I stirred in aprox 2 tbsp of flour while the sauce was simmering to thicken it. I served over angel hair pasta with an arugula salad. Fantastic!

Great recipe, though next time I will try to use fresh herbs and less balsamic vinegar.  Served with white sticky rice which was a good compliment.

do not believe the other reviews! i made the recipe the other night for myself and a friend. at first taste, i was mortified! i love vinegary things, but this is too much! i felt bad for my guest, she barely touched hers and i only ate a bite or two before i had to throw it out! this recipe seems like it would be good, but it isn't.

I added fresh minced garlic to the oil rather than using garlic salt to season the chicken, otherwise I made this exactly as written and it was wonderful.  Even my husband, who is not a fan of balsamic vinegar, was very pleased.  I served this with green beans and some mashed potatoes and the whole meal was a hit with everyone.  I can't wait to make this chicken again.

Love it!  Note that even if you use Italian style tomatoes, you still need to add all the spices.  Those tomatoes are barely seasoned and don't contain all the seasonings used in the recipe.

Yummy!  I am a balsamic fan, though, and this is not everyone's fave.  I am making this again this evening with a different balsamic (pomegranate vanilla from Oil & Vinegar).  The results will be fantastic, I'm sure!  Btw, I actually forgot to add the spices the first time, and it was still fantastic...

Great flavor and very simple to prepare.  The only change I would make is to stir in the tomatoes near the very end because the balsamic stains everything dark brown very rapidly....the addition of some color from the tomatoes, basil and feta make for a much more pleasing dish. Great easy dish!

My entire family LOVED this...kids included!  Very flavorful and easy to prepare (I did use 1/4 cup of balsalmic vinegar and 1/4 cup of chicken broth as others have mentioned).  Will definitely make this again and again!  Thank you!

Absolutely Family Friendly.  I made this with a half turkey breast that we had and doubled the sauce.  We ate over pasta and the kids and hubby could not get enough.  I did reduce the balsamic vinegar slightly per another review as we had an inexpensive one......and I am glad I made the adjustment.  It had just the right amount of tang without being too much for us.  Wonderful!

This was delicious. I added green pepper, fresh garlic and basil,chopped up roma tomatoes.  I ommitted the oregano, rosemary, and thyme and it was still awesome. I would start at 1/4 cup of vinegar and add to taste from there. I had a lot of left over liquid and the vinegar was strong, which I liked, but may not be for everyone.

I did this one a little different, I marinated the chicken in the spice-mix , 1/4vinager, chopped onion, and 1/4 cup of oil for at least 4 hours in a ziplock bag in the fridge(turn it once or twice). Then I browned the chicken on both sides, no need to add oil it already has it, and added the tomatoes and remainder of the marinade. Simmered until juices ran clear, and served with carrot rice recipe from this site, wow nice combo (I thought)

Very tasty!  I used crushed tomatoes, it's what I had, and cut back just a tad on the balsamic.  I did mix the tomatoes and the balsamic before pouring over the chicken.  Next time I think I will even mix the spices in as well.  It did take longer than 15 minutes to cook, but that may have to do with the size of breasts I was using.

This was wonderful.  Took the suggestion of one of the reviews and made it in the crock pot.  My Husband loved it!  It is a budget friendly recipe that will now become one of my regular meals.  First night, we had it with angel Hair Pasta, second night with gnocchi.  My Husband said it was better than a restaurant's and even made a sandwich with some of the left overs.

Delicious! Cubed the chicken added more tomatoes (only had a 28 oz can, didn't want to waste), added green pepper & green olives. Turned out more stew-like because of extra tomatoes and cubed chicken, which was fine with me. Everyone loved it.

This was pretty good.  The chicken was juicy.  The balsamic flavor was a little overwhelming and took from the other flavors.  I will probably try it again and cut the balsamic vinegar with some chicken broth.

The balsamic taste is very over powering in this dish.  I suggest using less.  My husband was the only one who liked it,  I didn't mind it but I will not go out of my way to cook it again.

Wow this really surprised me.  Im not a huge tomato fan but I love balsamic so I gave it a whirl.  I used the pre-spiced diced tomatoes and thickened up the sauce a bit at the end with some corn starch.  If you do this, be sure to combine the corn starch with some of the hot liquid BEFORE adding it to the pan or you will just get a clumpy mess.  Very tasty and I will definitely make it again.

This was wonderful!  We substituted the dried herbs fort fresh because we have an abundance in our herb garden and since we are garlic lovers, I added about 3-4 cloves of garlic. We both thought this dish was great. I served it with Quick Angel Hair with Basil Cream for One (also from AR) as well as a side of sauteed snow peas. FYI, this balsamic sauce is great for chicken parm too!!

Good easy recipe! I love it when I find a recipe where I have everything I need on hand. I used a Mediterranean Fig Balsamic and added a few mushrooms. My whole family enjoyed, even my two year old son.

This was absolutely delicious! I don't know why someone would make a balsamic dish if they don't like balsamic vinegar, but I am a fan of that kind of vinegar and I thought it was extra-tasty with the tomatoes. I have used both fresh and canned, and it always comes out perfectly with lots of flavors. I have left out the onion on occasion with no decrease in the yumminess. The seasonings are awesome, too. I love that this is an easy chicken dish with so few ingredients! It has become a regular dish in our house for nights when I want something quick, easy, and healthy.

I was really hesitant about trying this recipe, but I printed it anyways for one of those days I felt spunky.  Yesterday was that day.  I made it for dinner.  My 2 young children were gone for the night and I thought it would be something good to try on my husband (something out of the ordinary).  It was fabulous!  I served it over bowtie pasta.  The only thing I would do different would be maybe only use about 1/3 cup of balsamic vinegar.  It was a tad strong for our taste.  Other than that.........it was out of the "MOON AND BACK".  Thank you MOONANDBACK for a little something different.

This was simple and good. You do need to use a really good balsamic vinegar.

very good! the only thing i did differently was add less vinegar and a tad of vegetable broth bc i didnt have chicken broth- i knew that if I followed the recipe to the "T" that my hubby wouldnt like it.  Other than that it is so yummy and I will make it again for sure- I made this with the quinoa and black beans also from this site.

This dish is easy and amazing. My sister made it for us, and the only change she made was fresh garlic rather than garlic salt. I will make this recipe again and again.

Boyfriend liked it! Used a can of garlic and onion diced tomatos, mixed with 1/4 cup balsamic and 1/4 chicken broth. Added spices and mixed it all up before pouring in the skillet per another reviewer. Great weeknight meal!

This is a great recipe!  I used chicken tenderloins, fresh herbs instead of dried (because it's summer and they're growing outside) and a can of Hunt's Fire Roasted Tomatoes which I just discovered and are phenomenal I think...thanks for the recipe!

Pretty good1  Hubby went back for seconds and he is normally horrified to see anything fixed with tomato chunks.  Easy to make, will probably make again. Served with angel hair pasta. Used garlic powder to season instead of garlic salt.

Something easy to throw together that tastes like you slaved over it! The balsamic really does give it great dimension, not to mention all that sliced onion.  I cooked the onion until carmelized a bit and used fresh garlic. Other than that followed the recipe to a T and it was wonderful!

I only made 2 chicken breasts, but used the full sauce recipe.  I added some fresh tomatoes on hand and used fresh rosemary instead of dried, also on hand.  I did not have an onion so used onion powder.  I also halved the thyme due to personal preference.  Browned for a few minutes per side and then simmered per the instructions.  We served over sticky rice.  It was delicious!

One of my new favorite chicken recipes.  I only used 2 chicken breasts but all the sauce, which was great over whole-grain spaghetti.  SO tasty!  Hard to believe it's on the healthier side.  Will make this again, often.  Thanks!

Smoewhat similar to a recipe I got from my Mom that I improved on before I ever tasted this.  This just wasn't  very good.  I've posted my recipe but just waiting for it to be approved.  Scotts Balsamic Braised Chicken Romano.  People beg for this recipe.

This is definitely going into our regular rotation, though I think next time I will be doubling the tomatoes, onions, spices, and balsamic vinegar so there's more of a "sauce". Great flavor and super easy to make!!

This was pretty good but it definatley needed something more. I added mushrooms but it still lacked that robust flavor i was after and i wish the sauce could somehow be made thicker.

FANTASTIC!  I used 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar and added a little water. Mixed the tomatoes, seasoning, and vinegar in a bowl and then added it to the chicken and onions.  The chicken with the sauce served over white rice was out of this world!

This was pretty good.  I would actually give it 3 1/2 stars if possible.  I did cut the balsamic vinegar in half as other suggested and added sugar to cut the bite.  Very distinct flavor, not sure if I would make again.

I actually used this as a marinade and then cooked it all together in a pan (adding the tomatoes when the chicken was halfway done). It's a good recipe. Nothing exciting very tasty and the leftovers will be great tomorrow with salad.

Love this recipe! I scaled it down to serve 3 people and used stewed tomatoes because I didn't have a can of diced tomatoes. Other than that, I did everything exactly as the recipe states and it was amazing! I served it with rice and chopped steamed asparagus.

This was very yummy and easy to put together.  I'm glad I took the advice of previous reviewers and cut the Balsamic to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup of chicken broth.  I love Balsamic Vinegar, but it would have been way too strong with a 1/2 cup.  I also combined the drained tomatoes, Balsamic vinegar and herbs in a bowl and let sit for a few minutes before adding to the chicken.  Thanks for the recipe!  :)

DELICIOUS! EASY!  Only used 2 very plump chicken breasts but used the amounts called for in preparing 6 breasts (except for seasoning the chicken breasts themselves - just sprinkled on some Goya seasoning).  Since the breasts were thick I slowly browned them on one side for 5 minutes, turned them over and browned other side and added the onions at that time. If I had added the onions in the beginning they would have burned.  I used diced tomatoes that had oregano, garlic and basil already in it so I just had to add the thyme.  At other reviewers suggestions, I used 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar and 1/4 cup of chicken broth.  Good suggestions - the vinegar was not overwhelming.  I simmered (uncovered) for 15 minutes on one side and 10 minutes on the other side because of their thickness.  While it was simmering the liquid reduced itself and gave a nice thick sauce to spoon over the chicken.  Thanks submitter.  This is a keeeper.

This was very easy and very tasty.  Husband liked it also.  We both love balsalmic vinegar and this is fairly heavey on the vinegar.  If you are not a fan of vinegar, I suggest cutting back a little.  Will definately be making this again.  Thanks!

This was wonderful. I added asparagus like another reviewer suggested. I also increased the tomatoes to 2 cans, diced the chicken and added about a cup of parmasean cheese to thicken the sauce and add some cheesy goodness. I will definitely make this again.

What an easy, delicious dish!  I cut each breast into 3 pieces, and pounded them down to about 1/2" thick.  I used fire-roasted canned tomatoes and high quality balsamic vinegar.  I served this chicken with some seriously good/seasoned mashed potatoes and steamed spinach.  YUM!

YUM! I added a yellow bell pepper cut into strips and some artichoke hearts.  Hubby loved it too!  Next time I will add mushrooms and maybe a sprinkle of parmesean cheese.  I served with steamed asparagus and bow tie pasta for a complete meal.  It's a keeper!

This was a big hit, but I made it with pork loin chops instead of chicken, turned out great, I only used 1/4 cup of the balsamic vinegar instead of the half cup and used stewed tomatoes, the tomatoes soaked up the juice and were sooooo good. Will try it again with chicken next time

Loved it...my youngest son, age 9 and very thin...at 2 huge chicken breasts.  I did use part chicken broth/part balsamic vinegar.  I also used a can of undrained stewed tomatoes (chopped) instead of the diced.  Gave the sauce a sweet rich flavor.  Definitly a keeper!

Delicious and the sauce is addicting.  Next time I’ll serve with a crusty baguette so I can mop up my plate.  The trick to this dish is using the BEST balsamic you can find—one that is thick and sweet.  I added equal vinegar and chicken stock, and next time will add an additional half onion since they came out sweet and kept each bite of the chicken saucy.

This was very easy and delicious. I dusted my chicken thighs with a little whole wheat white flour after seasoning with the pepper and garlic salt so sauce would be a little thicker in the end. After I added the tomatoes I sprinkled the sauce with a little bit (1/2 tsp) of sugar to balance the tang out a little bit.   I absolutely adore Balsamic Vinegar so this recipe was great and two out of my three kids ate it and like it!!!  I served it with Trader Joe's green beans and Lundberg Parmesan risotto.  Easy weeknight dinner for a busy mom. Thanks!

This chicken dish was excellent!  It had lots of flavor from the balsamic!  It was just great!  I did like a lot of others and added half vinegar to half chicken broth.  But after tasting it while it was simmering, I wanted more balsamic so I probably ended up putting in almost the whole amount that it calls for.  The key is to use a good quality balsamic.  So when your in the grocery, pay that little extra for a good bottle.  I did saute in some garlic and only had two large chicken breasts.  It actually was perfect with two.  I wouldnt use more than four chicken breasts for this recipe because then you wouldnt have enough sauce.  And we love the extra sauce!  I served this with the pasta pomodoro recipe on this site.  It paired excellent with this dish!  It actually almost reminded me of a popular dish at fridays restaurant called chicken bruschetta.  Great recipe, 5 stars, this is a favorite!  Thanks for the recipe!

I did not expect it to be as good as it was! used 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar and 1/4 cup chicken stock. I was worried about it being real tangy but it was not. I cut up my chicken breasts and served it over wheat pasta. Yum!

easy enough to cook.  family liked it and collectively rated it "4".  i did add brown sugar as suggested while carmelizing the onions and i think this helped a great deal.  next time i will use 1/2 the vinegar and not drain tomatoes.  also would cut down on the herbs a little as they can be little overwhelming.  all in all this is a good dish and one i will try again...just with a few of my on tweaks.

This was excellent!  I did use fresh garlic instead of garlic salt, after browning the chicken deglazed the pan with a little red wine and added fresh mushrooms.  Other than that i followed the recipe and thought it was fantastic.  I served it over farfalle with sauteed green beans.  Delicious.

After I made this my dad could not stop talking about it he loved it so much! I did change the recipe a little though, I only used 3 really big chicken breasts and I cubed them so it would be easier to eat. I kept all the other measurements the same except I only used 1/4 cup of balsamic and that was perfect. I also added some mushrooms because my mom and I love them. I put it over white rice and it was really good, I am definetly going to make it again.

Made this the other night for my family.  I will admit to some mild trepidation about using all that vinegar (especially after reading prior reviews), but I needn’t have worried.  I followed the recipe exactly, and everyone loved it.  My husband was still talking about it the next day!  The chicken was tender, and the sauce was beautiful and delicious.  I served it with parmesan couscous (Near East brand), and it was the perfect accompaniment, giving the dish a sort of Middle Eastern flavor. The only modification I made was using all fresh herbs.  Will definitely make again.

This chicken is delicious.  It's very versitile, too.  When I first made it, I served it with rice, which was great.  I had leftovers which I served over vermecelli pasta, that was great, too.  The next time I make this, I'll add mushrooms.

A great dish! Easy to make, but looks and tastes very gourmet. I serve it with steamed veggies and long grain rice. One of my favorite recipes! Leftovers are great for work lunches.

Mmmm, delicious, and the man of the house really enjoyed it, too. I liked that it was simple, and used ingredients I already had, plus it was fast. The balsamic vinegar reduces, and gets sort of thick and syrupy; there's a really pleasant tanginess about it. I served this with Garlic Parmesan Orzo, and will happily make it again.

I wish I had read the reviews regarding the tanginess of the balsamic before I cooked this;  I don't have any regrets, I loved the flavor, but it was certainly tart, which I would have liked to have been toned down a little.  I was hoping the sauce would be more a reduction, so I may just reduce the sauce alone to have with the leftovers.  In order to keep the chicken tender, I dredged the chicken w/ salt/pepp/garlic powder/flour.  I happened to be baking cauliflower mashed "potatoes" to serve with this, so instead of simmering in the pan, I browned the chicken in the pan w/ the onions but cooked the rest of the way in a 350 oven for about 20 min.  It looked beautiful coming out with the tomatoes and onions browned on top.    Def a keeper, but one that I would like to tweak to suit my own tastes in the future, probably just to make it less tangy (with the addition of a bit of brown sugar) and make a reduction sauce.

This was a very tasty recipe.  I used chicken thighs instead of breast, but that was because it's what I had on hand.  Instead of garlic salt, I sauteed minced garlic with the onion.  I also cut the balsamic vinegar with chicken broth, but I think it would be good either way.

This was the absolute best chicken dish I've ever gotten from this site!  My husband made it so you know it was easy and he followed the recipe almost to a tee.  (I had to supervise.)  By adding a bit extra olive oil, there was plenty of sauce to pour over hot pasta.  Excellent!

This is one of our family favorites.  We love balsamic vinegar so we love this one.  It is one of  my go-to weeknight recipes when I don't know what to make.  It is delicious, healthy, and so quick and easy to make.  I usually use canned Italian Style diced tomatoes and skip the other seasoning when I am in a hurry.  Also I use garlic powder instead of garlic salt to reduce the salt.  Thanks for this recipe.

Try this with bone-in chicken thighs!  I had to discard quite a bit of fat and it cooked considerably longer, but it was fantastic!  I browned the chicken first and then deglazed the pan with chicken stock before sauteeing the onion and fresh garlic(don't use garlic salt).  I followed the recipe from there, but tossed in a tablespoon of butter at the end to add a sheen to the sauce and to help it stick to the chicken.  Excellent!

This was good and healthy but not a OMG experience. It was plentiful in flavor but there needs some adjustments which I will implement next time as suggested by others such as less balsamic vinegar and the addition of fresh garlic versus garlic salt. Lastly adding some sugar to cut the acid cut and including a glass of red wine at the table. I served ours with brown rice and green beans. There was plenty of sauce from the chicken to eat with the rice that I didn't need to fancy it up. Good recipe, just needs some tweeking to your liking. Thanks.

omg this turned out excellent!  I followed the suggestions of another poster & used brown sugar to tone done the bitterness of the vinegar; I also added sun dried tomatoes instead of diced-canned tomatoes along with artichoke hearts & 2 cubes of chicken bouillon.  Very yummy!  I ony wish I topped pasta with the sauce, I will have to keep this in mind for the next time I make it!

Good.  Too much rosemary and balsamic vinegar for my taste.  Next time, will reduce both by half.  Also, tomatoes should be drained.

Great recipe.  I used tenderloins one time, and the next time cut the breasts into strips like tenderloins so they cook faster and more thoroughly.  Didn't change anything else.

This is fantastic!  I would dice the chicken next time so that more of the chicken has contact with the delicious sauce... and probably double the sauce so that all the chicken is covered.  Otherwise, fantastic.

This was very good. I didnt have the tomatoes which we dont care for much at home anyway so I used tomato sauce. I served it with pasta garlic and oil and made garlic bread. My husband is an Italian chef and he loved it. He has never made the dish before. I asked him what he would of changed and he said nothing. I will save this recipe and make it a part of my families meals for now on. Thank you! D

This is absolutely delicious. I did what others suggested and cut the vinegar in half and added one TBSP. of brown sugar in the pan with onions. Used sauce over rice. I will be making this again real soon but next time I will double everything but chicken so I have more sauce.

I made this ahead for dinner the following night and stored it with the braising sauce.  It was very bad... Maybe I shouldn't have stored it with the liquids.

I scaled the recipe down to 2 servings and then followed everything as written last night. The dinner turned out absolutely wonderful. There wasn't an overpowering balsamic taste like other reviewers mentioned. It was perfect. I served each chicken breast over brown rice and then sprinkled just a bit of mozzarella cheese on top. I served it along side fresh broccoli that I prepared like "Pan-fried Asparagus" also. It was a really great meal. I wish I would have held off on making it until today. We're having company over and it would have been great to serve. Maybe the DBF will eat it 2 nights in a row...heck, I wouldn't mind.

I thought this was very good.  My husband liked it too.  He rated it a B.  For him to give an A is rare - he's pretty picky.  I would make this again, but I think I would eliminate the thyme & rosemary and perhaps reduce the oregano.  It was a bit too much, but just my taste.  Great recipe.

I made this recipe exactly as directed, with the exception of substituting fresh garlic for the garlic salt, and this chicken was fantastic.  I couldn't believe how easy to prepare the dish was, and my hard-to-please father not only ate the chicken, he asked for the recipe.  This made a wonderful Valentine's Day dinner on a day when my poor husband had to work late.  One note: I think the chicken is as good as the quality of your balsamic vinegar.  Mine was a great bottle of Bella Famiglia.

I thought this recipe was pretty good. I did take the advice of others and added some crushed garlic and reduced the balsamic vinegar. It wasn't the best chicken ever, but it still had a good flavor. I'll probably make this again.

This recipe is really quick and easy to prepare, and tastes great. I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned. I love how the ingredients are ones I usually have on hand, so I can easily make this any time I need a quick, delicious dinner.

Very good - reduced baslmic to 1/2 and added 2 tbsp of brown sugar with a little wine. Reduce brown sugar to 1 tsp. next time.

Outstanding! I made this with only 4 chick breasts since that is what we need for my family. I also used a good quality balsalmic, since it is like wine- if you use a cheap one, you are just concentrating that cheap flavor. The longer it is aged, the sweeter the flavor. I added chopped garlic since I like garlic. My husband loved it and said we need to add it to our rotation.

This recipe is awesome.  I prepared it exactly as directed and it came out delicious.  My husband and I both liked it a lot.  It reheats well in the microwave too.  The only suggestion I have would be to ground the rosemary before using it.  Other than that it was great!  I will be making this again.

This was so great! I made this for my fiance and he stuffed himself. I absolutely loved the flavor; it wasn't too strong at all. The only thing I ommitted was the olive oil. I used pam's non-fat olive oil cooking spray. I try to skim the fat and calories wherever possible.

I made it in the slow cooker with frozen chicken so there was a lot of water that came once the chicken was frozen..i also think there was too much oregano. could try it again as listed.

Personally I thought that the vinegar was really strong in this but it was very good. My boyfriend loved the sauce though so thats all that matters. I used chicken with bone and I browned it first and then baked for 20 minutes at 375 degrees then I got the sauce together and let the chicken simmer for about 10-15 minutes. Very tasty and will make again.

This chicken was so-o-o-o-o good; I can't wait to serve it to company. It was tangy enough for me using only 1/2 of the balsamic vinegar. I doubled the recipe & put it over rice the first night, and a couple of nights later, I put it over pasta. My husband couldn't stop raving about it; he's usually not too crazy about leftovers. He said it was even better the 2nd time around.

We loved the flavor of this dish!  As suggested, I halved the vinegar and replaced missing amount with chicken broth.  Also, I doubled the amount of tomatoes and it was perfect. Dish was served over rice with steamed broccoli.

The balsamic vinegar makes or breaks this dish. We used Trader Joe's balsamic and this dish was fabulous! Substituted fresh herbs for dried and served over rice with zucchini on the side. Easy and yummy!

This was delicious!  Unfortunately I didn't have any onion, but it still turned out well.  Also, I didn't make quite as much chicken, so I had a lot of extra sauce.  It was fantastic over pasta for lunch the next day.

I used 10 year aged balsamic for this recipe - since it is much sweeter than what you might find at the grocery.  The dish was good - but the balsamic flavoring of the chicken was very subtle -- even though I tenderized the chicken before cooking.  What we did find is that the diced tomatoes absorbed the rosemary and balasmic flavoring very well.  We served this over vermicelli pasta.

I was looking for a recipie that would work with the limited ingredients I had. I didn't have enough olive oil and I was out of tomatoes. I did have sun dried tomatoes, they are covered in olive oil and they were great. With all of the seasoning already in the tomatoes, it was  great with the basalmic vinegar. I don't even know if I would use fresh tomatoes when I make this again.

This is an awesome EASY recipe!!!  I changed it to two breasts.  We do NOT like tomoatos and just used a small can of tomato sause, along with an added spoon of minced garlic while browning the brests.  Also, in addition to the herbs I included a couple of dashes of crushed red pepper.  We enjoy spicy foods.

This is a great recipe and I highly recommended it.  Very quick!

First review for me - I LOVE this dish!  I have now prepared it twice.  I used to get this dish made for me at a local Italian place.  Now I can make it at home!  Thank you!

I put mine over angel hair pasta, and I also cut up the chicken into bite-sized pieces.  Also, the first time I made it, I only had diced tomatoes with green chilies.  Gives it a bite and my husband loved it.  Next time, I made it with regular tomatoes and still love it.

thanks!

I'm taking the middle road with this one. I cut down on the balsamic to 1/3 cup, used fresh garlic and halved the spices like other reviewers suggested, but the sauce was still quite overpowering. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't fantastic either. Unlike others, I thought this plated very nicely-I'll have to take a picture. I think it would be best served over some plain white rice. Thanks anyway for the recipe.

I enjoy balsamic vinegar and all the other ingredients but wasn't overly impressed with this recipe.  Too much liquid (add cornstarch maybe?) and the vinegar is a little in excess (add sugar?).

The herbs and balsamic vinegar in this dish are intense but in a very delicious way! I cut the chicken into fajita-size strips and doubled the recipe for a group gathering: it disappeared very quickly. Extremely healthy and delicious recipe- thank you!

Great, easy recipe for a busy weeknight or to impress guests for dinner!  I halved the amounts of rosemary and thyme that the recipe called for- I think if I added the full amounts, it would have been overpowering.  If you love those spices, though, I suppose you could go for the gusto and add the full amount.  Great recipe, thanks!

Not very good.  Too much vineagar, needs brown sugar, and make sure to drain tomatoes.  Sauce tastes like Heinz 57.

This is a sinch to prepare with ingredients one tends to have on hand and can be made at a moment's notice.  I don't use garlic salt.  Instead I crushed 2 cloves and put it in the end of the onion/chicken saute so it would not be too brown and get bitter, and added salt to taste.  I then proceeded with the rest of the recipe.  I left out rosemary(don't care for it) and added a can of the Italian diced tomatoes as well as the other spices as listed.  I don't like bland; if one likes things with a little zip then I would suggest adding a bit more of the spices or use the Italian tomatoes as well.  I love the sweetness that Balsamic gives to any dish or salad and usually sub it in place of other vinegars.  If one finds it too vinegary, sometimes adding some BROWN sugar to a sauce will help cut it.  Would definitely make again.  Served it over basmati rice and it was nice.  *If one likes the blend of chicken and balsamic, might want to try the Chicken Breast Pierre recipe here on Allrecipes...it is somewhat similar.

Honestly, I wasn't expecting much but this was really good!  I forgot to buy an onion at the store so I used dried minced onion and it still turned out great.  I tossed it with penne pasta and it made for a light, flavorful dinner that my husband and I both enjoyed.  Thanks!

I've made this dish several times now and its delicious as is, but I've tweaked it to my tastes. I accidentally pureed the onions in my ultimate chopper but it made it better! I added tomato paste to thicken the sauce and cook everything with at least five cloves of fresh, minced garlic (I looove the garlic!). I also cut the chicken into bite size pieces and let everything simmer for 30 minutes to an hour (however long it takes for my fiance to come over) and serve over bowtie noodles with garlic crescent rolls on the side. Perfect!

I cut the chicken in bite sized pieces and added spinach at the end for a one dish meal.  My husband couldn't stop raving about it.  His only suggestion was to use angel hair pasta or rice because the sauce doesn't
stick.  Maybe will thicken the sauce just a little next time.

A very tasty recipe as is, but I could certainly see how roasted peppers and/or artichokes could be introduced (looking forward to trying those next time) I served it over bowtie pasta and everyone enjoyed it! The only thing I changed was to cut the chicken into strips so the spices and sauce would cover more area.

This was a great quick recipe. I followed advice from previous reviewers and pounded the chicken and cut it into pieces and also added mushrooms. I also used the full 1/2 cup of balsamic and it was perfect. It seemed to just be a matter of letting it simmer long enough (the full 15 minutes)to tone down the owerpwering taste of the vinegar. I also sauteed roasted red peppers and a clove of garlic along with the onion. Next time I'll probably try artichoke too as some suggested. Thanks for the recipe!

Very very good.  I only had 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts, so browned those.  Changed vinegar to 1/4 cup per other reviews, and used 1/2 tsp rosemary, all other herbs used as shown in recipe.  Also added 1 can of mushrooms drained.  Excellent!!  Served with white rice.  Only gave 4 stars cause i wish there would have been some more juices.  Next time I may add maybe 1/2 c chicken broth.  Hubby doesn't usually like chicken with sauces, but he liked this.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is awesome! I added some sliced mushrooms along with the tomatos and then sprinkled some feta cheese on top of the chicken at the end. Served with a baguette and a nice side salad, you have yourself a great healthy meal! My husband loved it too!

I followed the recipe exactly and was not very happy with the results.  The vinegar flavor was way too powerful for my taste.  If I make it again (which is doubtful,) I will definitely reduce the balsamic vinegar to about 1/4 cup, maybe less, and replace with either chicken broth or water.  I served this over brown basmati rice, which helped to salvage the chicken.  My other complaint is that it isn't a very pretty dish -- sort of muddy looking.  This recipe is rated really well by other users -- it was very quick and easy to make --and if you like the taste of balsamic vinegar, you'll probably really like it.

This is a very tasty recipe! If you reduce the serving size, I'd suggest only reducing the amount of chicken so you have a little "sauce" left over. Also, if you want to increase flavor, cut up the breast into tiny strips.

Very nice dish. I had requests after they tried it for the recipe, and they wondered how I got such a nice flavor into the chicken. I added sliced portabella, white mushroom, and shiitake mushrooms to this recipe, and fried them along with the onion. Turned out really well, and if you enjoy mushrooms I suggest you try.

My husband and I both liked this recipe very much.  I would suggest using fairly thick chicken breasts as I found it took longer than 15 minutes of cooking time to get the sauce to our desired consistency and this could dry out thinnner cuts of meat.  The sauce was wonderful with the rice I made as a side dish.

I didnt have onions on hand so I used mushrooms instead. To save time I skipped all the spices and used some salt, pepper and garlic & herb Mrs. Dash. This was so quick and easy and got rave reviews. I have made it several times and it always goes over well!!

Yummy!  My husband absolutely loved this dish.  The chicken was incredibly tender, and the tomatoes were a great addition.  The thick, fresh chicken breasts I used took a bit longer to cook than the recipe states.  But that might give the sauce longer to soak in.

I really loved this recipe and so did my whole family. It was super easy and tasted delicious! I didn't care for the dried rosemary so next time I will leave it out. It was too twiggy as someone else mentioned. Fresh herbs would be great too if you have them around.

This is an easy recipe that makes a great dinner.  I've made it twice and the second time I cut the vinegar in half and like it much better.  My husband doesn't normally like 'tomatoey' recipes, but really likes this one.  I serve it over white rice.

Nice change of pace for chicken.  I added minced garlic to the onions and chicken. As suggested earlier, I also added a dash of red pepper and cut the vinegar in half for the simmer.  The chicken was juicy and flavorful and worked well with rice.  I thought the spices were just right.  Fairly easy too!

This was so good. It made me feel like a master chef and wish that I was having a dinner party instead of just serving it to me and my husband.

YUM YUM YUM! MY boyfriend and I loved this. It is very flavorful; makes MOIST chicken and the tomatoes, onions, and balsamic vinegar make the best sauce. Serve it over rice and you've get a quick, easy, and flavorful meal.

Absolutely delicious!  I used fresh tomato and fresh basil - which I think makes a big difference.

Fabulous and easy recipe!  I added a few whole fresh mushrooms halfway through cooking, and they made a nice garnish.  Also used fresh tomatoes.  This recipe looks great served in shallow bowls over pasta--I'm not great at presentation, but this looked beautiful and would make a great last minute recipe for company.

EXCELLENT!  First off, let me say that I'm totally new to this whole cooking thing, but you'd think I was a master chef the way this stuff turned out!  I'm pretty darn impressed with myself, as are my husband, father-in-law and even my 11-year-old niece, (though I'm not sure this would appeal to most kids).  Towards the end I threw in another can of tomatoes and a little extra vinegar because I thought it could use a bit more sauce (I served it over white rice), but other than that it was absolutely perfect!  Now I'm off to see what other great recipes Beth has to offer!

All I can say is, YUM.  I loved this... In fact I keep craving it and thinking about it and I just have to make it again.  I agree about using more tomatoes though.  I used four breasts and it was just barely enough sauce.

I thought this recipie was delicious, and my 4 and 2 year olds did too. We had it with spaghetti noodles. My husband, Mr. Finicky, said it was, "all right."  He'll just have to eat some more before deciding how great it is :-)
Very quick and very good!!

My husband had cancer, and one of the side effects of his treatment was significant loss of his ability to taste. He couldn't stop raving about this dish! He could taste it very well, and it is delicious. Both of our kids ate it up too, as well as a friend who is a picky eater. Thanks for this great recipe; in the words of my husband, "This is a make-again dish for sure!".

I decided to make my boyfriend rate my meals 1-5.  There's criteria for ourselves you can find in my profile.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was amazing.  My boyfriend loved it and it is weight watchers friendly. Very easy and schedule friendly.  Will be a staple recipe for me in my weight loss journey.

Very good, relatively healthy main dish. Using a cast iron will brown the chicken up nicely and the sweet onions will then soak up all of that deliciousness.

Made this per the recipe except for cutting back on the balsamic and  adding minced garlic in with the onions.  Did not serve it on rice or pasta as it was plenty all by itself with the veg cooked in and a salad on the side.  Hubby and I both liked it and will make again!

This is an excellent recipe.  We didn't have chicken breasts and had no desire to go shopping (snow) so used pork lion roast we had cut into steaks.  The "other white meat" worked quite well with this recipe.  We also had roma tomatoes that I diced rather than using the canned diced tomatoes.  The combined herbs blended perfectly with the balsamic vinegar and made for a very tasty (and tender) main dish.  Served with rice and roasted brussel sprouts.

I have made this recipe at least 30 times.  It's my favorite all time recipe!   It is perfect for entertaining because you can prepare it ahead of time and guests think you have been slaving in the kitchen all day.  I do recommend a good Balsamic vinegar.  That is the key!  I follow directions to a T.  Bon appetit!

Wow!!! I was a little worried that the vinegar would be too strong and overpowering. Especially after simmering for a long time and seeing the chicken change in color to a dark burgundy. Nope. The flavor was perfect! The only vinegary taste was the tomatoes and they were perfect too. My family loved this, it was easy to make, and it was a healthy dish. I highly recommend it. PS- I know people tend to add their little alterations. Try it they way it is posted first. No need to alter this recipe.

I've made this twice for the family and they love it. No tweaking the ingredients. Instant read thermometer a must in my mind.  I pull the dish out when the meat hits 160*, rest for 5 minutes, serve it up.

So flavorful and quick!  I used Aceto Balsamico Di Modena which is a thicker balsamic vinegar. It is a little more expensive than other balsamic but it's the only one my Italian husband likes. I only buy Bell and Evans brand chicken and don't have to drain fat.  This is a keeper....use good quality products and you won't be disappointed!

I was looking for something to quickly put together for dinner and I had all the ingredients on-hand, so went with this recipe. I love balsamic vinegar and made this exactly as written. Even served it with rice and green beans as suggested. It was really good and I bet the leftovers will be even better tomorrow. Husband loved it too. It's a keeper. UPDATE: I made this for dinner again last night and decided it was worthy of 5 stars. Simple (all ingredients that's I usually have on hand), fast (no marinating and minimal chopping), and very flavorful! Great recipe!

This is by far my favorite dish ever! I had 10 people over and decided to try this recipe. I wanted something that wasn't too time consuming but seemed semi upscale. This dish was it! The favors are amazing!

Will make this one again Great flavors. Be careful it is easy to over cook the chicken making it a bit dry.

I've made this a few times and it's great every time.  I like some more vegetables so I cut up some red pepper and throw it in at the same time as the onions.  I also take the chicken out with about 5 minutes left, cut it into cubes and throw it back it.  The chicken absorbs the sauce better and I've found it's tastier this way!

I found the sauce a bit tart so I added about a 1/4 cup raisins and simmered till they were plump-then it  was perfect!

I followed the recipe exactly.  It was wonderful!  I used an expensive vinegar.  You can't go wrong with that.  The only thing I would do differently is butterfly the chicken breast or pound it down a little as mine were so big and thick.

It turned out pretty good! I forgot to add the tomatoes and realized it only when I went to add the recipe to my "favorites". The boyfriend said that he didn't think it would make it better than it already was. So I guess my contribution is that you can make it without tomatoes and it'll still be good.

My entire family loved this recipe! I did think the taste of vinegar was a little much though,  next time I might add a little bit of sugar to mellow it out.

Made this tonight, followed recipe, but... I used fire roasted tomatoes and added 2 cups of sliced mushrooms to skillet as chicken was cooking. Delicious served on a blend of greens (arugula, spinach, lettuces), and a side of plain white basmati rice. I will make this again! Thanks for posting this!

Braised Balsamic Chicken Haiku: "Added some mushrooms. Tangy, moist & flavorful. Instructions spot-on." Nothing remarkable to note - followed the recipe except added mushrooms. Served w/ crusty bread (lots of balsamic juice to mop up!) and salad. Good stuff!

Excellent flavor! We all loved it however I did make a couple of minor changes.  I caramelized the onions first .  Removed them from the pan and added them to the tomatoes ( I used fire roasted tomatoes ) with the spices.  Cooked chicken and then added the onions and tomatoes when I flipped the chicken.  Made sautéed mushrooms and a salad....easy and delicious.

I love this recipe! It is easy, healthy and delicious! It is safe to use when cooking for gluten-free, dairy -free and sugar-free guests. It is often my "go-to" recipe! Sometimes I add mushrooms, and sometimes I add kalamata olives, or both. It is great over rice.

I was very pleased with this recipe because I followed a reviewer's suggestion to reduce the amount of balsamic vinegar and add brown sugar to caramelize the onions.  This is quick to make and works well served over noodles.

I liked this. I agree that you should reduce the amount of vinegar by half and replace with chicken stock. I get heartburn from garlic salt, so I dredged the chicken in flour, salt and pepper before sautéing. I added fresh garlic to the tomato and vinegar mixture instead. Served it with couscous and peas. Relish.

I changed the recipe a bit because I didn't have onions, guesstimated with spices, halved the recipe, and I used crushed instead of diced tomatoes, but it was AMAZING. At first, I tried the "sauce" and the balsamic was way overpowering (my cheap Kroger balsamic), but after I let it cook for not even five minutes it was TO DIE FOR. I would even make just the sauce again to use in pasta. The chicken was incredibly moist and flavorful. I loved it! Thanks!

This recipe was incredibly easy! I didn't have any onion so I just used onion salt, which since my bf is not much for onion worked just fine. I was afraid this was going to come out to tangy due to the balsamic, but the sweetness of the tomatoes offsets it beautifully! Great recipe, super easy, I'll be making this again for sure.

This was delicious.  Even my kids enjoyed it.  It was so good, tasted like a fancy restaurant and was easy and quick to make!  I used diced tomatoes with mild green chiles for just a little kick, but other than that, I followed the recipe completely.

Easy and delicious.  I will use less vinegar the next time.  I added sliced carrots while sautéing the onions.  Because I have a very small kitchen, with small pots and pans, I put the chicken and veggies in a baking dish, in the oven, to finish cooking.

This recipe is scrumptious!! I've made this several times and have had rave reviews every time. The only change I personally made was to cut the rosemary in half. I also followed the advice of other reviewers and used half chicken broth/half balsamic vinegar. Also, DO NOT skimp buying quality balsamic...it really does make a difference. I serve this chicken with garlic rice and it's a great combination. Thanks for the recipe. LOVE IT!!

I've been making this recipe for a long time and it is my go to because of how simple and quick it is. I like to marinade the chicken in a bit of olive oil, s&p and fresh garlic while I prep everything else. A good quality balsamic vinegar and olive oil makes a huge difference.

Love the balsamic flavor, I used chicken thighs since they are not as dry when cooking, also crushed the Rosemary so there isn't all the sharp spines poking out (kids don't like that). 

Served with rice noodles and asparagus, big hit in my house.

Made this a few nights ago and the whole family loved...including my picky eater. It's a quick and easy recipe. Chicken was so juicy! I added mushrooms... add any favorite veggie and I'm sure it will be great. As I used the leftover tomatoes and sauce and made myself lunch the next day with chicken and spinach. Agree with other reviewer to blend spices with tomatoes ahead of time.

Not bad. I would try it again before scratching it off my home menu. I will try a fresh stick of rosemary instead of adding the dried.

This was very easy to make... a nice, relaxed, no hassle recipe and extremely flavorful! We enjoyed it with a small mixed green salad tossed in balsamic vinaigrette and a side of grated cauliflower (microwaved for 2 minutes).

I tried this recipe Because I did not want dry bland chicken breast. I used salt and garlic powder. I added some minced garlic (garlic lover). It came out perfect not acidic at all. The balsamic vinegar with the browned onions gave it a milder sweeter flavor. I did cook it a little longer than suggested maybe 20 minutes and I let the juices come to a boil before I cut the temperature down.
I served it with quinoa and salad. My husband loved it and the calories were right in line with what I was looking for.

I followed the instructions and the ingredients, but I must have gone wrong somewhere.  The chicken came out great, but the process was a little nerve wracking, it could be me, I don't like to cook chicken because I'm scared of undercooking it.  Anyways, when I tried to brown the chicken, it never browned, instead it kind of boiled in its own juices, even though I only had the 2 tbs of olive oil in the pan.  Then I felt like it took forever for it to cook, and I kept waiting for the liquids to reduce, but they never did.  The chicken turned out great though, and the sauce was really good, even my husband loved it, but I did follow the instructions to a T and had some difficulty, but it was worth it.

Really like this. I DO use a quality balsamic vinegar however; but that always makes a big difference in any recipe. I also pound the chicken breasts slightly to make them tender. This is definitely going into my regular rotation - thanks!

This was really easy and very tasty. I'm only not giving it 5 stars because it wasn't totally amazing. But my husband really loved it and I definitely liked it enough that I'll be making it again! The only thing I changed was using minced garlic instead of garlic salt, since I had just run out. It was really good!

This was a very tasty dish, at first bite I wasn't sure if I liked it but as I ate it, it tasted better and better. I served it over brown rice, delish. I took the advice of another cook and cut the vineager with chicken stock. Will for sure make this again.

So delicious and so unbelievably easy! Only differences were I used half of a sweet onion instead of red and doubled the amount of canned diced tomatoes (made for thicker sauce!). I served with rice pilaf and broccoli spears.  So happy I stumbled upon this recipe, simple and delicious.

I made this tonight and it was amazing. Definitely now the favorite chicken dish in my house. I was shocked that my picky kids, ages 4, 2, and 1, ate everything on their plates and asked for seconds. I added some chicken stock to take the vinegar a bit for the kids and served it over rice I cooked with chicken stock. It was such an easy dish and fell right off the bone after braising on low for about an hour. I highly recommend.

Since my husband has been on a balsamic vinegar kick I decided to try this out. I myself not so much a fan of balsamic but I absolutely loved this recipe! The tomatoes added that perfect touch for me. I think using the 14.5 oz can was the perfect amount with the balsamic vinegar. We used modena balsamic vinegar but look foreward to trying it with various types. Also served this over simple white rice and green beans, which both suite this recipe well.

I've made this recipe twice now, with rave reviews from my family. It's easy, takes few ingredients and it's delicious. I do cut the breasts in thirds or quarters so it will cook through faster. Other than that, I use the recipe as stated.

Great recipe! Made it with whole grain spaghetti and green beans. It was just perfect. The balsamic vinegar, herbs and diced tomatoes is a perfect combination, the herbs adds so much flavor. My fiancé loved it and he is very picky with chicken recipes. I highly recommended it, fast to make and it goes well with anything either mashed potatoes, vegetables or pasta.

I'm not a very good cook, but this was easy to make and turned out amazing. I ended up adding a little white wine because the sauce boiled away before the chicken was done. Still turned out nummy. My boyfriend is raving about it while washing the dishes. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Just made this (still eating it this second =P ); have to say it came out with perfectly moist, delicious chicken. Made two tiny changes: first off, instead of 1/2 cup of balsamic vinegar, used 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar and 1/4 cup balsamic vinaigrette so it wouldn't be quite so overpowering in strength. The second change was to add some cayenne in as well for a bit more bite to make up for the slightly weaker balsamic bit used. It was quick, easy, cooked the chicken perfectly, tasted great. I'll be experimenting with this more in the future to work up some personal variations, as I have the strong suspicion that it could be even greater than it already is with a few more tweaks to the spices. I also really have the feeling, as eating this, that it could use a little soy sauce as well. Still, very good recipe, highly suggest trying it out! ^.^

I hardly ever cook, and by hardly I mean never. Decided to try this and I must say, it was a GREAT recipe even for someone who is pretty foreign to the kitchen. I only had to buy one or two spices but I had everything else in house. Pretty quick and easy to prep. Only thing I would recommend is less Balsamic vinegar(maybe 1/2-1 cup) as 2 cups was a bit too much for our taste. To my surprise the chicken turned out great! Again, I don't cook but this was a great recipe that anyone can make. I will definitely be making this again and passing it off as my own creation! ;P I highly recommend it!

Very good -  Tasted very good - I used fresh tomatoes, and Fustini Olive Oil and Balsamic Vinegar (both flavored),   The onions and tomatoes were very tasty as well.  Easy and quick fix.

Great quick chicken recipe. My only change was to use three large breasts and to cut back a little on the balsamc.  When the recipe allows, I make extra sauce to freeze for a quick meal another night.  Next time, I think I will use ground rosemary as the dish does not really cook long enough to soften the needles enough. But that is a small change and I will definitely make again.  When my husband say "Wow" after his first bite I know it is a hit!

This was delicious - so easy and very healthy. I served it on a bed of angel hair pasta and garlic sautéed spinach - perfect combination. I added a cup of chicken stock to make the sauce go a bit further and it worked perfectly. I also used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt. This will be added to the menu plan for this family!

This recipe is delicious.  It was a hit with my two daughters ages 10 and 3.  We served it with herbed rice and/or mac n chz.  It was great with both.  Highly recommend making enough for leftovers. I love that it is a one pot dish that is really simple.  Yummy!

I added 1/2 cup of chicken broth to the pan to dilute the bitterness of the balsamic flavor and create more sauce. Amazing dish.

Absolutely loved this as a base recipe. Just for personal taste, added pancetta at the start and left out the thyme and rosemary. Toned the amount of balsamic vinegar down slightly, as my other half doesn't like the taste too much.

Not quite as good as "chicken pierre", but not bad. Double the tomatoes. Plan to cook closer to 30 minutes, rather than 15, once all ingredients have been added. The longer it cooks, the more tender it becomes.

This recipe was just OK.  I made it with chicken on the bone and therefore had to braise it much longer, and after removing the chicken I cooked the liquid down to remove any trace of sourness from the vinegar.  The onion-tomato-vinegar stuff was good but not exceptional, and the chicken didn't absorb much flavor.  I would not make it again.

Good recipe but the directions are all wrong IMO. Start with a heated, oiled pan and add the onions, cook until brown add the other ingredients (except chicken) and simmer for around 20 minutes. Season and cook the chicken in a separate pan, deglaze with a bit of red wine and add to other ingredients. Simmer for a few more minutes. This way you have time to caramelize the onions and marry all the ingredients without overcooking your chicken. I agree with others to cut the balsamic with chicken stock if it's too tangy. Adding a tablespoon or two of sugar will help with this too.

This was OK, barely.  I think there's way too much balsamic vinegar for the amount of other ingredients to offset it.  If I were to make again, I'd use just a 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar along with some chicken broth, mushrooms and black olives.

I made this dish for dinner tonight. My family and I enjoyed it very much. I baked the chicken breast in the oven at 450 for 20 mins instead of on the skillet. I mixed all the other ingredients on the skillet under low heat. Once the chicken breast was ready I poured  the tomatoes mix over it - delicious! I made a side of rice to go along with  it.

It's a great simple chicken recipe especially when you're in a pinch for time. I used trader joe's 21 seasoning salute which had most of the herbs listed and I added some fresh basil and rosemary on hand.  I diced up some tomatoes, and added mushrooms and roasted bell peppers. I made sure not to simmer it too long and it turned out very moist and tasty!

My whole family loved this!  Even my daughter that doesn't care much for meat or chicken loved it.  They all want me to add this to our usual rotation.   I tenderized the chicken beforehand. I cut the vinegar in half and added chicken broth for a delicious reduction.  I served it over pasta and garnished with fresh basil. It was quick and easy!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I served it over rice. I did use the suggestion of chicken broth in place of some of the balsamic vinegar, which I think was a good decision. This will be going into my regular recipe rotation. Great when you want a quick, easy dish.

I made this a bit simpler - I used a can of Italian style diced tomatoes (has the herbs already in it) and didn't add any extra herbs.  Threw in a jar of button mushrooms, cut the balsamic back to 1/4 C, added 1 chicken broth cube (no extra water).  After tasting it was a bit too sour, so I added maybe 1-2 t. of sugar and then it was sooo delicious!

I love the flavor of Balsamic Vinegar.  I had no idea what to do with the chicken breasts I thawed and this was easy. Got to use a lot of my favorite herbs also.  Served it up with some seasoned yellow rice and sweet green peas, and my guys was licking the plate..I just loved it!!

Made this for my family, and it was fantastic!  My wife, daughters and I loved it!  My wife took the leftovers to work with her for lunch, and let her coworker try.  She loved it, too and made it that night for her family.  Definitely a success!  I will keep this in my rotation.  The balsamic taste, onions, and herbs go so well together!  Thanks for submitting this recipe.

I love the flavors and simplicity of this recipe, but I must admit that using whole, boneless chicken breasts made for a dry piece of meat.  The second time I made it, I bought thinly sliced chicken breasts and barely seared them, took them off the skillet, and reintroduced into the onions once the onions were browned.  Much better!  Just add to the sauce, because buying the thin pieces makes more surface area.  I recommend making it in a pot rather than a skillet, if you do it this way, so all of the chicken gets into that yummy, tomato-y, balasamic bath!

The flavors were delicious and using good-quality Balsamic makes a huge difference. I added sliced mushrooms (had on hand) and that was an excellent addition. My husband loved the flavors. However, the cooking time will have to be adjusted because the chicken was a a little dry, after following cooking directions exactly. Will definitely make again - just make sure you monitor the cooking time.

I love this chicken! The sauce is perfectly balanced with subtle flavors of sweet and savory. I have never used balsamic vinegar before for cooking, but this recipe has really opened my eyes to new possibilities. The only thing I changed in this recipe was that I added a little chicken stock and butter to the pan when I was frying the onions. That, and I used fresh herbs and I eyeball the quantities. This recipie took me 30 minutes flat with prep, and is definitely a winner for an excellent busy weeknight meal.

This was so good!  Make sure you are using good balsamic vinegar, the quality will make or break this dish.  It shouldn't be too tangy if you use good balsamic.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and combined the tomato, balsamic, and spices and then added the mixture to the chicken.  I also added a little minced garlic.  I only needed to simmer the chicken for 10 minutes.  I served the chicken on top of spaghetti, which absorbed the extra sauce.

other than that, good!

This was good but not great. I followed the recipe, only substituting fresh herbs for dried and fresh tomato for canned. I love balsamic vinegar and used a nice aged one I had on hand. The chicken turned out fine but not something I'd make again.

Cut the vinegar with chicken broth, & added a tsp of brown sugar. Ponded the chicken flat. Turned out really well.

WOW!  This is good! I didn't make any changes except used fresh herbs instead of dry and it's so good! The balsamic vinegar flavours the diced tomatoes and the chicken! Oh and I used double the amount of tomatoes, didn't want to waste half a can. And it turned out delicious! Definitely adding this easy dish as a staple to my recipes!! Recommend!!

Made this on a week night with sides of garlic mashed potatoes (instant) and a green bean and carrot mix (microwaveable) in 35 minutes and it was very good. I might use less Balsamic next time as it was a bit too tangy for my liking. Very delicious and healthy!

This is my 1st time writing a review, but I had to write one for this dish. It was so easy to make and incredibly delicious!! The chicken was soft and tender and the tomatoes added just the right amount of sauce or gravy. I followed some suggestions  and used minced garlic and caramelized the onions before adding in the chicken, I also added a chicken bullion cube with about a 1/2 cup of hot water when simmering to add to the flavor. I paired it with brown rice and buttered green beans and potatoes. The end result was phenomenal. I will definitely be making this recipe again! I

Love this dish! I serve this over Basmati rice or mashed potatoes with roasted vegetables. I have used Italian Style Stewed Tomatoes or petite diced tomatoes, both work fine. I also like to prepare this in my Dutch Oven, with the ingredients exactly as called for and it is wonderful!

I was craving for something new different and stumbled upon this delicious recipe.  You must use good balsamic vinegar because it starts with good ingredients and I use organic products. I prepared this with egg noodles, zucchini, and 5 tbsp pasta starchy water. It turned out amazing thx for the recipe :)

Not my favorite dish. I prepared it to recipe, and chunked up the chicken. Served over brown rice. It was not bad, but I could have used more veggies. I think if I try it again, next time I will add minced garlic and zucchini. This could actually be decent over a baked potato.

Not sure what went wrong.... Followed directions exactly and the chicken breast came out very dry. Even with all the sauce, which was tasty! Will try again, I'm going to tenderize the chicken first next time.

Delicious with whole wheat spaghetti and green beans on the side.  The combination of spices was wonderful.  I did halve the amount of spices because I was only cooking for 3.  Perfect at any time of year since it is a stove top meal.  Can't wait to try with garden tomatoes and fresh herbs

This was pretty good!  Before I made the recipe, I was joking with my boyfriend that some reviewers complained that it was "too balsamic tasting."  I thought that was hilarious because it's a balsamic chicken recipe!...  Well, I literally ate my words.  The chicken was delicious, but the sauce was very balsamic-y LOL!  But, we put it over rice and it seemed to balance out the flavor.  He loved it!  Overall it was good and I'd make it again.

EASY! Used double tomatoes and added a little water. Was a little worried when I poured the vinegar in the pan. Got a good whiff and it did not smell good but after cooking, it was sweet and tasty. Made it with green beans and brown rice. Making it with Farro next time. Will make again!

I would not make this again. This dish contained too many spices. It tasted artificial. I would add fresh herbs. Overall the taste was just alright. My boyfriend doesn't want me to make this again

I followed the recipe exactly and even splurged on good balsamic vinegar. It was edible, but no one in my family liked it. Unfortunately, this will not be a keeper for us.

My first time doing an AR recipe and it turned out great..The only thing I changed was I added a bigger can of diced tomatoes for more juice and added about 1/4 cup of brown sugar and the children loved it! Thank you!!

My wife hardly ever cooks but she looked up this recipe and made this tonight for dinner and it was absolutely amazing! She said it was really easy to make. We ate it before we could take a picture of it to post on this website lol. This is my new favorite dish.

Incredible flavours! This is such an easy recipe with fantastic results. No changes required. Absolutely worth trying. Of course, you must like balsamic vinegar. If you do then this is a recipe for you! Thanks very much MOONANDBACK.

I used 4 chicken breasts and cut them in strips.  I used Italian style diced tomatoes and omitted most of the herbs, except added a little thyme.  Next time I would season with a little bit of salt too.  This tasted better the next day over brown rice.

This recipe was just ok, but my adult son liked it; my husband said it had too much tomato.  I should have used real garlic, and I should have used more pepper.  I did add chicken stock to 1/3 c. of balsalmic vinegar, and I was glad I did.  It would have been too strong.  On the other hand, it tasted too tomatoe-y.  But that's just me, I'm not crazy about chunks of tomato.  I agree with someone else who said this is really good without the chicken!  I used Quinoa, and it was very good with the sauce.  I cut up chicken, because I had thin chicken breasts, and I didn't like the texture.  That isn't the fault of the recipe, though.  I think I prefer cooked tomatoes and balsalmic vinegar separate.

Yummy! I stumbled across this recipe while searching for another.  It was easy, healthy and delicious.  I wasn't sure about the vinegar but took a chance and so glad that I did.  I subbed 2 cloves of minced garlic for the garlic salt (not a fan of garlic salt) and used chicken breast tenders.  The sauce was exactly as written.  I thought we'd have leftovers but hubby had 2 big servings and proceded to pack the leftovers for lunch with just a bit left over.  I served it with rice and a wedge salad.  I think this would be great with pork tenderloin or chops, too.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks!

Tried this recipe last night, was really excited about it because of all the great reviews. Far, far too acidic - I even went so far as to remove the chicken to not overcook it and further reduce the sauce to bring out the sweetness in the balasmic a little more. 

I love balasmic and make reductions and dressings with it all the time, but this was so far off the mark I can't recommend the recipe to anyone.

Delicous!  I added sliced mushrooms with the onions.  Also I mixed in a bowl the balsamic vinegar, diced tomatoes and the herbs.  Stirred it up then poured over the chicken.  I will definitely be making this again!

This was excellent! What I did differently:  I used fresh garlic, and sauteed with the onions for a few minutes before adding the chicken.  I also used boneless/skinless thighs.  I also used a very good aged balsamic ( I think this is key) and braised the thighs for about 25 minutes until the vinegar started to thicken.  Great with mashed potatoes.

This one got a resounding "meh" from the family.  It's not like anyone pushed it away or anything, but probably not rotation worthy in our house.  Has nothing to do with the balsamic flavor many on here don't like, as I used very good quality.  Quick?  Check.  Easy?  Check check.  End result?  Meh.

Made a single serving version on stove top with minced garlic and fresh tomatoes instead of canned. It was a moist and yummy and very very flavorful. Added some paprika to the chicken seasoning for a little heat which complimented the sweetness of the balsamic vinegar. Will be making this again for the family and will serve over some quinoa.

This recipe was very easy to make and very tasty. I didn't have rosemary or basil but it was still delicious. I would definitely recommend using this recipe!

Absolutely gorgeous... my other half wasn't too keen on so much balsamic vinegar but me, as a self confessed vinegar hater, well I thought it was perfect. Making it again tonight now the question is do i use chicken stock so less balsamic or not? hmmmmmm

I wanted to like this so much more than I did. I added a small sprinkle of Truvia sugar to the balsamic vinegar, and I'm so glad I did. It cut down on the tang and brought out the smooth flavor of the balsamic. The tomatoes were actually pretty delicious because they soaked up so much of the balsamic flavor, but the chicken itself was a little bland. Even the next day, after soaking in the balsamic/tomato juice mixture, the chicken was STILL bland!! I was a bit disappointed.

Really a fantastic, easy, healthy family favorite. Everyone ate everything on their plates, and it seems we didn't have enough to go around! Very tangy and enjoyable; served it with rice, salad, and watermelon. Perfect for summer :)

I'm a FACS teacher and had my students in Nutrition & Wellness class make this in a poultry unit. They loved it SO much that I had many take the recipe home and make it for their families! Some of them sat over the pot as they made the topping and smelled it the whole time it was cooking!! This was by far one of the best recipes we made all year, taste wise, and it was healthy and easy to make.  You just can't beat that nowadays.

I thought this was great because I love balsamic. Since I have two small children I add a bit of honey to cut out the tang that was a little to intense for them the first time I made this. I also add mushrooms, bell peppers, garlic and fresh herbs from my garden. If we want some kick a squirt of rooster sauce is perfect. I brown the chicken in my Dutch oven and then add all the other ingredients and pop it in the oven at 350. I leave the skin on the chicken except for my husbands piece because it grosses him out. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

This was really good and pretty simple! I love one pan dishes!   I followed the recipe to a T except that i added only half balsamic and half chicken broth so my kids would eat it.  Served over white rice with salad!   YUMMY!

This recipe is so easy & so good! I sauteed onion and garlic before adding the chicken (which I coated in salt, pepper, garlic powder, and poulty seasoning). The seasonings are great with the balsamic (which I am a big fan of) so I really enjoyed this one & will make again.

Fabulous! I'm a huge fan of balsamic vinegar, so this was right up my alley. The flavors came together very nicely. This is pretty tangy, so keep that in mind if that's not your thing.

A few modifications. Based on a previous review, I added minced garlic to the skillet right before adding the balsamic vinegar (instead of seasoning chicken with garlic salt). Also based on a previous review, I mixed the balsamic vinegar, tomatoes, and herbs together before adding to the skillet. Finally, I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned.

Had this with rice. Was sad when my plate was clean...

My husband is on a diet and this fit the bill so I tried it. He really LOVES balsamic vinegar and buys good ones so I thought this would be great for him.  He loved it and takes his lunch to work, so he loved it even more the next day.  Thanks for an additional meal to add to the diet file.  ;)  Update--this is 6 years later and we continue to make and enjoy this often.

I love balsamic vinegar and was really excited about this recipe!  I even went out and bought "top shelf" balsamic vinegar.  Unfortunately we did not care for this recipe, it somehow tasted too sweet...not sure what I did wrong but I thought I followed the recipe exactly.

This was very tasty, but I did amend it by cutting the balsamic vinegar in half.  I have been caught before by adding too much vinegar to a recipe so I was cautious with this one.  A quarter cup was plenty, gave it a nice bit of bite.  Will make it again.

I am giving the recipe 5 stars since the mixture of herbs with (in my case) tomato sauce was very good. Even without rosemary that i didnt have. I didn't really like the balsamic vinegar even with half the dose. However, the next day it had a bit of a barbeque sauce taste to it. So I added a little more and it tasted great. I had cut the chicken into small bites and after the cooking mixed everything with canned green beans. It was sooo good. Will definitely do it lots and lots of times.

My husband would give it 5 stars.  It was good to me, but I wasn't scrambling for more--though I will definitely put it in rotation.  Followed others: only used 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar (used Wegman's store brand and it was fine) and 1/4 cup chicken broth and added fresh garlic.  I accidentally thought I had diced tomatoes, but after I'd already started cooking, I realized that it was actually tomato sauce.  So I used just half the can.  I mixed the sauce, vinegar, and spices together and set aside.  I placed chicken directly on top of the onions and garlic and moved everything around every now and then.  Simmered it in the sauce for just the requisite 15 minutes.  Tasty!

Made this for dinner for the family and then I left for work.  I reheated this for lunch the next day and it was delicious!  I used boneless chicken thighs, and diced up fresh tomatoes because I didn't have any canned.  I also added a little bit of chicken stock to give me more of a sauce.  I will definitely be making this again.

Very easy to make, quick and most of the ingredients you'll probably have in the pantry. The herbs and balsamic make this recipe. Very healthy, and a great protein hit.  Would be great with a handful of mushrooms and chopped garlic.

Both my SO and I loved this dish. It was very simple to make and even the cheap balsamic worked just fine. We bought chicken with bone in and we butchered butchering it, so we cubed the chicken. Still excellent and I'd probably make it with cubed chicken instead of the whole breast.

I used about half as much balsamic vinegar than the recipe indicated, making up the difference with chicken broth. The flavor of the sauce was very nice, much better than I was expecting. My kids weren't totally on board, but I thought this was outstanding!

O.K., I just made this for dinner tonight. I maybe didn't use the exact amounts for the seasonings, but I did use the same ingredients. I just increased them a bit. I really liked it, but I love balsamic vinegar. My hubby said it was good. He wasn't' as keen on it as I was, but he did like it. I sliced the chicken into strips, and cooked it as the recipe said, and I served it over a plate of spaghetti noodles.  We had a mixed vegetable salad and bread sticks, and a glass of Syrah wine(or was that two glasses), anyway, it was very good, and I will make it again.

I made it with of the alterations suggested--used fresh garlic, mixed spices with tomatoes before adding to the chicken, and I used 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar and 1/4 cup of low sodium chicken broth.  It turned out fabulous.  Even the picky eater in the family loved it.  Will definitely be making it again.

Love!  This was wonderful!  I'm a big fan of balsamic vinegar anyway, and the tomatoes, onion and spices just put this over the top.  Plus it was fairly quick and easy.  This will be in heavy rotation going forward.

This was really good! Easy to make and lots of flavor. 1/2 a cup of balsamic vinegar is way too much. A 1/4 a cup was just right and I added a few splashes of red wine.

Used fresh rosa tomatoes, fresh herbs and red onions. Sautéed the green beans in the same pan after adding the tomatoes and the balsamic vinegar. Served with brown and wild rice.

This was good.  Not our family's usual type of meal, but my 7 yr old gobbled hers right up!  I served over angel hair pasta and did thicken up the sauce with a little tomato paste like another reviewer had suggested.

This dish is packed with wonderful flavor. If you don't like strong flavors then don't make this dish.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Used a large white onion which was perfect.  Followed the advice of another reviewer and mixed the balsamic vinegar, tomatoes, and spices all together and then poured over the chicken.  I also found it difficult to cook the chicken and onions together so I cooked the onions and then browned the chicken and added the onions back in the last few minutes of browning.  Hubby went crazy over this dish.  Has already requested we make it again.  It was very moist and delicious. We dipped our crescent rolls in the sauce.  Might serve over some white rice or pasta next time.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

I really liked this. Hubby and kids not so much because of the tomatoes. I ended up eating most of it myself, but that was ok with me. Very moist and good over spaghetti.

This was interesting, but good.  I'm not a huge fan of balsamic, so it was a bit much for me.  My husband loves balsamic, and loved this.  He'd say five stars, I'd say three, so we're going with four.
EDIT: We made this a second time, using fresh tomatoes (3 medium) and fresh basil - DEFINITELY made a difference.  I'd still say 4 for the original recipe, but with our changes, a 5-star.  We served it with brown rice pasta (my husband has to be gluten-free) and green beans.  We're making it again tonight!

I made this last night, and as some users suggested, cut way down on the balsamic vinegar. I used one large chicken breast which I cut in half, and so reduced balsamic to 1/8 of a cup. I also added more thyme and 4 cloves of minced garlic. I wanted mine to be served with rotini pasta, so I added tomato puree (one large carton) and 1/2 of a can of chicken broth. I cut the chicken into pieces and removed from heat while the sauce cooked for about 25 minutes. I then re-added the chicken and stirred in the pasta and 1/2 of a cup of freshly grated Parmesan cheese.

I thought this recipe was delicious. Served it with asparagus and brown rice (added some mushrooms with the onion). My pan wasn't big enough so I sauteed the onions and mushrooms, took them out, then browned the chicken.  Added onions and mushrooms back to the chicken then the rest of the ingredients.  Really good! Try it :)

Made this for the first time a few days ago. All i can say is AWESOME!! I was looking for an easy recipe to make with things i already had. used frozen chicken and 1/3c balsamic Vinegar since i wasn't sure if my balsamic was "good quality" or not.  
the only other thing i did was omit the onions as i didn't have any. it was probably one of the top 3 best chicken dishes I've had in my life!! definite keeper

Awesome. Used chicken thighs, added a couple cloves of sliced garlic, and used canned fire-roasted tomatoes. Served with polenta and salad. Big hit with the bigs and littles.

i thought this was a fantastic dish! i did make some adjustments as i didn't have all the dried herbs on hand. i also just cooked this for 1, myself, and it came out perfect and i ate everything in the pan. i didn't have garlic salt, i just seasoned my chicken breast with a whole bunch of seasonings in my cabinet. i used garlic & herb, caribbean jerk, and poultry seasoning. i didn't have canned tomatoes on hand, i just diced up some cherry tomatoes i had in the fridge- worked perfectly. i also bought some cheap balsamic vinegar- i bought publix brand- and i thought it was fine. not too tangy or anything. i also threw in some diced garlic to the pan when i sautéed my onions. i also added a squeeze of chili pepper paste (its in a tube) that you can find in the veggie section of your supermarket. when i added my chicken breast to the pan and after i added the vinegar, tomatoes, etc., i just threw it in the oven for 10 minutes at 350 degrees. 2 minutes before it came out, i added a thick slice of mozzarella cheese to it (i had the deli section at publix slice me a big piece) and viola! it was fabulous! i even added some fresh basil to it when i put it on my plate and it was delicious. fantastic meal!! will keep this one around! and i think the chili pepper paste added a nice, small, kick of heat to the dish!

SOOO good :)) i traded dried chives for rosemary, don't use a sweet onion or it gets WAY too sweet, and only use half as much tyme as it calls for. I used the balsamic vinaigrette dressing instead of actual vinegar, and put a little more garlic salt in it. Wonderful!!

This recipe is fantastic.  I have made it several times now and the whole family loves it.  The only change I make is garlic granules instead of garlic salt.  Serve over cooked orzo. Fantastic!

This was an excellent meal. The only thing I changed was adding some chopped garlic with the onions. Served with jasmine rice, garlic mushrooms and a mixed greens salad.

I made this last night and it was delicious!  I followed the recipe with two exceptions.  First, I grilled the chicken on the bbq then cut it up and added it to the sauce, and secondly, I used fresh rosemary.  I served it on a bed of rice with a side of green beans.  This is so simple to make, but does not sacrifice flavor!  I should also add that I only used three chicken breasts as it was only for two of us.  However, I didn't change the quantity of any other ingredients because I wanted a sauce for the rice.

I changed the recipe slightly by using chicken wings and baking without using the diced tomatoes. Otherwise, I used all of the same ingredients and it was fantastic. I did decrease the amount of balsamic vinegar but wished I hadn't.

Quick and easy. I used less oil, and I used the canned diced tomatoes that come with italian seasonings, but still added my own (3/4 tsp instead of 1 tsp).  Very satisfying meal, and very very easy to pull together.

Very quick and easy - and healthy to boot!  Only had cheap balsamic on hand, so I halved it and added a pinch of sugar, but I think it would've been best with the whole amount.  Subbed garlic for the onion and tomato sauce for the diced tomatoes due to personal preference.  Flavor was good - I was afraid the spices would be overpowering, but this was not the case - and chicken was juicy.  I highly recommend pulverising the rosemary with either a spice grinder or a mortar and pestle for better texture.  Served this with whole wheat penne and roasted asparagus,  Delicious!

great recipe, missing a little 'something', next time i think i will add more garlic flavour to it. made in the oven rather than on stovetop as i had a full stovetop of asparagus & corn on the cob. excellent flavour.

Loved it, I used white wine and a can of whole tomatoes and its liquid along with the balsamic. Did not use Chicken broth.  Used One bay leaf and fresh basil.  Tremendous.

Ok so I didn't have a can of diced toms, so I thinly sliced 3 roma's and added 1/4 of catsup cutting the balsamic by a third. To my surprize, it was sooo good! I also sprinkled the toms with sugar, salt free salt and salt free italian spices b4 adding it to the chicken, and added the catsup after everything was in the pan cooking for five minutes. Next time I will try the canned toms, but this was really good! Thanks for the idea.

I'm not sure I can still call what I made Braised BALSAMIC Chicken because I only used 2 tbsp of balsamic vinegar and replaced the rest with chicken stock since my boyfriend doesn't like the overpowering taste of balsamic.  I'm still giving this recipe 5 stars though because the other ingredients and prep instructions resulted in a very good meal.  I used crushed tomatoes instead of diced because that's what I had on hand and served it over brown rice.  The chicken turned out very tender and juicy.  I will be making this again.

We really enjoyed this!   I used Italian style diced tomatoes so I reduced the herbs to 1/4 tsp.  I also added a chopped clove of garlic.  I pounded out my chicken breasts so they were of even thickness to braise.   Once cooked I removed the chicken breasts and reduced the sauce to a thick glaze.  It was so good - almost a chutney consistency.  We will definitely be making this again!

This is tastier than I expected. I recommend cutting the balsamic vinegar down to 1/4 cup and adding 1/4 cup red wine and a little (1-2 tbsp) brown sugar. The next time I make this I'm adding mushrooms.

I made this for dinner tonight and both hubby and I really enjoyed it. The flavors blended beautifully, and the chicken stayed moist. I served it over hot couscous with a green salad and we both felt spoiled. The only change I made was to use onion powder instead of fresh onion, because I was out. The fact that it was still so good in spite of the missing fresh onions tells you what a great dish this is. I did mix the tomatoes together with the herbs and balsamic vinegar in a bowl (as a reviewer suggested) before adding to the skillet--I think this is an easy way to make sure all the herbs get distributed evenly. I bought a good quality aged balsamic recently and I think it truly makes a difference since the vinegar is such an integral part of the dish. Will make this often. Thanks for a great, easy dinner, Moonandback!

I really enjoyed this recipe. So easy, and really healthy. I made a change though, I didn't use canned tomatoes I just diced fresh ones and added some water and simmered. It came out great it with less sodium than using canned. I served it with quinoa. Will definitely make again!

This recipe was really good. I cut the balsamic vinegar to 2T, as my family isn't crazy about a lot of vinegar. I also cooked some orzo until is was al dente and added it into the pan to finish cooking in the juices. I served it topped with parmesan cheese and a salad.

This chicken is amazing! I would recommend using the highest quality balsamic vinegar you can find - it makes all the difference!

Good and really easy but VERY balsamicy!  Once the shock of the balsamic taste calmed down I liked it.  It was just okay for the rest of the family.

I added garlic and mushrooms and used fresh herbs (because I happened to have them). I served this with rice and a side of veggies. So good!

This was VERY good! My fiance LOVED it and wants it again. I did rate it down due to the fact that I made changes. I added green bell pepper for flavor, color, and to add more veg. Also I added crushed red pepper for that little extra kick that we enjoy. I served this over Spaghetti noodles. Thank you for posting!!!

This was very good! Very easy and healthy! I used half the amount of Balsamic. I had a wonderful bottle of Balsamic from and an olive oil & vinegar specialty store that was quite thick, dark and flavorful, so I'm glad I was careful. Use your better judgement before adding all the vinegar and be sure it is a good quality Balsamic. Served over rice! I would make this again. Thanks!

Great pantry recipe. When you're out of fresh veggies and need a good dinner, this is a great solution. Half a large yellow onion was good, can of stewed tomatoes, Alessi balsamic vinegar. I added a little honey and minced garlic and cooked in crockpot. Served with brown rice.  I salted the onions while they cooked and added the garlic salt, but yeah it was still a little bland.  My only suggestion for that is to stop eating so much processed food.

Enjoyed this for dinner tonight. I used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt and halved fresh grape tomatoes instead of canned. I have two people who don't love the vinegar flavor so next time I will substitute half the amount for stock. I served with risotto (arborio, onion and stock) and broccoli. I drizzled all with balsamic glaze. Yum!

Delicious!  I added a few teaspoons of brown sugar and used crushed tomatoes based on personal preference.  I didn't have the spices on hand, so used Italian seasoning and it worked great.  Served over whole wheat linguini.

Not a favorite at my house! Predominate taste is Balsamic, I did not taste any other flavors. If you love balsamic it is probably awesome.

I made this recipe last night and it was absolutely delicious.  I pretty much followed the direction, as is.  Using a high quality balsamic vinegar is the key.  The sweetness from the onions perfectly complimented the acidity in the vinegar.  Highly recommended!

I followed the recipe just about exactly, using seasoned diced tomatoes and italian sesoning (instead of the individual dried herbs). This was delicious! My family, including me, usually just tolerates chicken (and my 10-year old will usually only eat if it's breaded). My 10-year old ate it without a single complaint (which says a lot), and the rest of us truly enjoyed it! So easy and healthy and delicious. This is a keeper. Thank you!

This was so flavorful and was such a hit all three times I have made it. I used cilantro instead of oregano since I was out, and a little less thyme since the flavor can be over powering.

This was super easy and I had everything on hand, pretty much.  I used boneless, thick cut pork chops and they were super tender and delicious.  I also used white balsamic combined with apple cider vinegar, simply because that's all I had to add up to 1/2 cup.  I also substituted Rotel tomatoes and it gave it a nice kick.  I did cook it longer in the simmering process.  Served it with Balsamic Roasted Brussel Sprouts from this blog:

Really very good served over jasmine rice.  I cut the balsamic in half and  made up for it with chicken stock because I wasn't sure if my family would like a strong balsamic taste.  Next time I will add the full amount since they loved it!.  Might add mushrooms next time too, to make it like a chicken cacciatore.

The first time I made this recipe, I followed it exactly and we thought that it was a bit too balsamic-y for our tastes. After the chicken was cooked through, I let the sauce simmer a little longer and added some brown suger to cut back on the balsamic taste. 

The next time I made it I halved the balsamic and substituted the remainder with white wine. The result, I thought, was much smoother than the original recipe. 

Both times, however, I used garlic instead of garlic salt, and sauteed the garlic with the onions (which I did before adding the chicken so that the onions would be nice and soft by the time the balsamic, tomatoes and seasonings were added). 

It needed a little tweaking but overall a delicious recipe.

This is a good mid-week family meal, even being a little on the fancy side.  When simmering, I did flip the chicken and total simmer time was about 16 minutes.  Came out pretty close to perfectly moist.  My 7-year old said he enjoyed it, along with the rest of the family.  Keeper!

This one's a keeper!  Following the advice of other users I added some brown sugar to the sauce and the dish was fabulous.  I made the whole sauce recipe for two very large chicken breasts and the extra sauce sure didn't go to waste as we put it over rice.  I'll be proud to make this recipe for company.  Yum yum!!!

Absolutely delicious! Instead of garlic salt, used real garlic plus salt, and also used fresh rosemary. I braised the chicken, onions and garlic first, then removed the chicken and added all the sauce ingredients. After that put it everything in the slow cooker in low for a couple of hours. Chicken was perfectly tender! It did taste even better the second day as all the flavors had blended perfectly and it wasn't as much of the balsamic taste in front. Awesome recipe!

Love this! Prepared this differently than the recipe directions- First we cooked the (red) onions until lightly browned and soft in a mixture of butter and EVOO. Set aside. Used 8 pieces of chicken (thighs/legs) rubbed with seasonings then browned in the pan. Set aside in a glass baking dish. Topped with a can of fire-roasted, diced tomatoes and a cup or so of homemade pasta sauce (made with red wine, parm, plenty of seasonings- was on hand from the freezer) then added a few oil-packed, sun-dried tomatoes and drizzled on the balsamic vinegar. Baked in a pre-heated 350F oven for 40-50 minutes. Served with "Mushroom Rice Pilaf" from AR.

Followed to the T but was slightly disappointed with the flavor. It was decent considering it was a quick and effortless dinner, however I don't think I'll be making again.

Cut the chicken into cubes and cooked them in a wok - very tender.  Found the sauce a tad sweet but overall a good meal option.

I made this as written with the exception of adding some mushrooms. The rosemary was overpowering for my taste. I will make it again but will only use 1/4 teaspoon rosemary. As other reviewers stated, I believe the higher quality balsamic you use the better it will be.

This has become one of my family's favorites!  I use chicken thighs, personal preference, and let me say they were falling off the bone tender!  When making for the kids I follow the advice of others and halve the balsamic vinegar and add 1/4c chicken broth.  We also prefer using stewed tomatoes instead of the diced...the last time I used diced it was a little too sour for us...a blitz in the food processor before adding the tomatoes to the pan makes the sauce thick without being too chunky.  Loved it with potatoes or garlic rice!  Very pretty dish that would be suitable for company, besides who doesn't want a new way to cook chicken.

We just had this for dinner and I thought it was very good. I did cut the balsamic down to 1/4 cup and used 1/4 cup ck broth. I also sauted fresh garlic with the chick instead of garlic salt. Served over rice and it was a quick and delicious meal. Family said worthy of having another time!!! Thats a good thing! Oh i did sprinkle a pinch of sugar just to cut some of the acidic taste and it did need some salt.. Otherwise followed recipe

This was excellent and super simple. I did 4 chicken breasts, a little less than half a cup of balsamic and used ro*tel original with tomatoes and green chilies then grated a little locatelli cheese on top when finished to make it like bruschetta chicken. boyfriend loved it!!

This recipe was easy and excellent. I used some of the advise on the other comments and I cubed the chicken before I cooked it and added artichokes and mushrooms. My husband ate it and said that I had to make this again very soon.

I think it was smelling/looking great, and then the addition of the dry spices overpowered it. There is already a lot of flavor going on with the balsamic and the tomatoes, perhaps scale the spices back or opt for fresh?

I would give it 5 stars, but first of all, I didn't follow the recipe exactly... so I'm not certain how it would taste doing so... I ran out of diced tomatoes without realizing, but I had a can of crushed tomatoes... they worked great! I also sliced some garlic and added when browning onions and chicken. I would, from now on, cube the chicken (easier to cook, easier to eat). All and all, this was wonderful! I LOVE the flavor! It was great!!!! Will make again, maybe with diced tomatoes next time... then again, maybe not! ;-)

This was a very good dish. I am watching my calories and was so upset that I couldn't have seconds. My husband on the other hand had seconds and thirds. He was still talking about this dish the next day. I followed the directions as given except I forgot to add the tomatoes. It still came out great. I served with garlic mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus makes a great green veggie side. Make it and enjoy.

I fixed this for a birthday dinner for 10 (used 3 skillets).  It was simple and everyone loved it.  I didn't change the recipe but I just sprinkled a little parmesan on top.  The balsamic was not too strong at all. I will definitely fix this again.

Really great recipe. We did a couple extra things to spice this recipe up.
1. No pepper/garlic salt
2. Cut/flattened the chicken breast, and stuffed it with soft Blueberry Cinnamon Goat Cheese.
3. Rolled the breasts up and toothpicked them shut.
4. Baked at 375F until center was done. (Approx 25 mins)
5. Sauteed onions with spices until golden, the added tomatoes and balsamic vinegar.
6. Served with sweet potatoes, asparagus, topped with sauteed onion/tomato over chicken.

Deliciously sweet and exotic.

I love this recipe.  From the other recommendations, I use a bit less vinegar, 1/3 cup.  It makes great leftovers, this one gets made a lot in the winter at my house.

This is SO GOOD! I didn't have any diced tomatoes, so I used olive oil, garlic and basil pasta sauce. Added a little extra dried basil, the rosemary and about 1/2 cup of chicken broth to cut the sweetness of the pasta sauce. Used the 1/2 cup pf balsamic as suggested in recipe. I will definitely make this again the same way next time. Served with sour cream mashed potatoes... YUM!

this was a simple simple easy recipe. Started my diet again and was looking for new recipes so happy I tries this because I was satisfied and was happily eating healthy food. My hubby doesn't care for balsamic or chicken or tomatoes so i was hesitant, but thrilled with how well these flavors combined and we both really enjoyed the recipe

Thank you for this original recipe for chicken...always looking for a new way to prepare.
I did make a few changes (personal taste).  I used 5 chicken thighs for the flavor,  I added a few large, sliced shallots to the onions and later on, added several large, diced garlic cloves. I first used 14.5 oz can of tomatoes and added about a cup of fresh from the garden and still found it needed more, so I added an additional 14.5 oz can of tomatoes.  This made the volume right, but had to tighten it up a little with a flour/sauce slurry...did the trick!  I served it over fettucine with fresh steamed green beans, drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with fresh romano...mmmmm....This will become one of my family favorites.  Thank you for sharing!

So delicious! I did everything just like it said except I only used 4 chicken breasts and the sauce ratio was good that way.

This was just "edible". I followed the recipe exactly as directed with the exception of cutting the amount of basalmic in half. I was very disapointed. I don't think I will be making this again.

Holy cow this is fantastic!! Made it last nite and no leftovers! I used bone-in, skin on chicken breasts, seared them in a skillet w/evoo and thru them in the slow cooker. I used the onion, fresh garlic and some fresh mushrooms and caramelized all then added to the chicken. I used italian seasoning and poured the tomatoes over. I let it cook on high, was able to remove the bones and skin, made some garlic mashed taters and green beans it was so yummy. I think next time I will use cremini mushrooms for even a deeper flavor, oh, I also added a smidgen of dark brown sugar which really brought out the balsamic flavor without adding more vinegar! So easy to make and so yummy to eat definitely a keeper, Thank you so much!!

this recipe was really good, brilliant. but honestly i cant have that too often, every now and then is good enough for me, nothing to do with the recipe itself, just personal taste. i replaced garlic salt with 3 garlic cloves, and added salt to the chicken to taste as with the pepper. I didnt have a can diced tomatoes so i finely chopped 4 tomatoes, crushed 3/4 of the quantity and added 2 tbsp of tomato paste to them. i did mix the basil, oregano, rosemary, thyme with the crushed tomatoes as other reviews suggested, to avoid clots. i didnt decrease the quantity of balsamic vinegar, but i did add 1/4 cup water to the mixture while simmering. My family loved it.

Added chopped egg plant and garlic, and this was very good. Will try marinading the chicken breasts in the vinegar overnight to see if it gives it a bit more flavor.

this smelled good! This was also my first time cooking chicken and it went well!  And if you LOVE balsamic vinegrette, you will be in heaven with this dish.   In my case however the cook time was much longer, I cooked (in addition to 10 minute saute) the chicken about 20 minutes.  But I didn't use a skillet, I used a stainless steel general pan, so that might have been why I needed longer cook times.

This is a keeper.  Like another reviewer, I had leftover pasta sauce and used it in place of diced tomatoes.  i did add garlic and mushrooms and cut the balsamic vinegar to 1/3 cup, carmelized the onions before browning chicken.  The result was excellent.  Will add to my all time favorites!

This was amazing! I modified the recipe slightly by putting fennel seeds and celery over polenta.

I loved this recipe and so did my family.  I did do a couple of things differently from the recipe.  I caramelized the onions first and browned the chicken on each side then added the other ingredients. Oh! and I used fire roasted diced tomatoes instead of plain.  Anyway after I added all the ingredients to the chicken and onions I let it cook low and slow instead of the 20 minutes that the recipe says, our chicken was all but melting in our mouths.  I wish I had thought to take a picture.  But serving it with rice is a GOOD addition!  I will be using this recipe again!

Delicious!  I made the recipe exact with only altering tomatoes for fire roasted tomatoes(only because that is what I had on hand).  Loved it!  I will make this again & again.  I prepared the dish with linguine & a salad.  This recipe is so easy and tastes like you spent a ton of time!

This was okay but I probably won't make it again.  I followed the recipe and tasted the sauce once it had time to simmer.  The vinegar gave it a sharp bite and I had my doubts that my family would enjoy that.  I took suggestions from some reviewers and added some brown sugar.  That helped but still was not enough.  Some reviewers suggest adding chicken broth.  I did not want more liquid so I added some chicken bullion crystals instead of broth.  That helped balance the flavors and I served it like that with white rice and steamed broccoli.  They all ate it but none of us were crazy about it.  The leftovers are untouched in the fridge.

We loved this.  I decrease balsamic vinegar to1/4 cup and added 1/2 c. chicken stock.  Simmered covered then uncovered to thicken.  Did end up adding a bit of cornstarch.  Served over mashed potatoes.  Yum!

What makes this recipe so fabulous is how quick and easy it is. I ha meant to add mushrooms but realized I had forgotten once all the food was plated and realized that it wasn't necessary as it is so flavorful as is.

This recipe was amazing!  I made it exactly as written and served it over long grain white rice. The rice was the perfect compliment to the tanginess of the balsamic vinegar.

I love this recipe - although I found almost everything a bit too strong for me, so I have cut nearly everything in half. Tastes soooo good, I serve with angel hair pasta.

I am a beginner at cooking and this was the first recipe I've ever attempted on my own and not only was it very easy to make, but I thought it tasted great! I added some sliced mushrooms and green peppers along with the onions, and it was really tasty. I'll cook it again!

I loved this one. It was super easy to make and very healthy. I removed the chicken breasts from the sauce, added some asparagus to cook and then put the chicken back in to warm. Excellent simple healthy meal. Even my husband loved it and he doesn't especially try to eat healthy.

This dish was so yummy!!! My guests and I loved it. I served it over angel hair pasta that I had tossed with butter and fresh parsley. I used bone-in chicken breasts that were on sale and it came out great, I think the bone helped with the flavor and made the chicken really juicy. I also used fresh garlic vs. garlic salt. I will make this again for sure!!

Easy to prepare. Certainly flavorful! If I make again I will take the advice of another review and cut the vinegar with stock. I love vinegar but it was a little overpowering in this dish.

This is so easy to make! Only make if you really love balsamic flavor.  I am a family of 5, so I always buy the big pack of chk & try to get 2 meals out of it. There were 8 breasts in the lg pk. I cut the thick part off each breast & saved for another meal.  I also did this so my chicken would cook faster. I served over Jasmine rice.  Everyone ate it up! Thanks!

Very good, I added mushrooms to use them up. Very easy and great if you like balsalmic!

The sauce was too overpowering.  Too much tomato and spicing was heavy.

I did salvage this though. I discarded the sauce and used the cold chicken in sandwiches made with pepper jack cheese and that was excellent!

Followed advice of one reviewer and used only 1 T. of balsamic vinegar and the balance of liquid used chicken broth.  Hubby HATES vinegar but with this slight of hand he really enjoyed it.  Used thighs as breasts simply leave us both cold.  I would have liked to have tried with just the balsamic...

Great dish, my husband loved it. The balsalmic was (just) a bit over powering but that could have been due to the fact that I had to keep it warm for a while before serving it.

OH MY!! Is all I can say, very delicious. I did cut the chicken into Medallions first and added bell peppers, but followed rest of recipe, but I put a lid on it and simmered for about a hour, so good, so good. had it with Zatarains yellow rice. Leftovers are also yummy in a Flatbread Italian wrap with melted Mozzarella cheese..

Strong balsamic taste, which I love, so I thought this was great. I only had 2 chicken breasts, but basically kept all other ingredients the same, except used garlic powder instead of garlic salt for lower sodium. Served over rice and this was fantastic!

This recipe was great! I added 1/4 cup of chicken stock suggested by another reviewer and it worked out fine. The herbs and spices made the sause very tasty! I did mix the herbs and spices together with the tomatos and balsamic vinager prior to pouring over the chicken. Had it over angel hair pasta. Family loved it.

I thought it was tasty, but since I didn't know how much my family would enjoy the vinegar, I halfed it.  The dish was a little acidic, but I would like to play around with it to see if I can tone that down. Maybe use fresh tomatoes? Good recipe, though, otherwise.

Delicious!  Took advice from other reviewers and reduced balsamic to 1/4 cup.  I also added 4 sliced cloves of garlic and 8 oz. fresh mushrooms to the sauce.  Terrific weeknight meal that comes together quickly!!

This was the BEST - my very picky family all loved it.  I loved it as was easy to make, took little time, and was absolutely delicious.  Definitely will make again and again.  I used Italian Seasoning blend instead of individual basil, oregano, rosemary, and thyme as blend has all four included.

I made this exactly as stated, except substituted 1 1/2 teaspoons of Italian seasoning for the herbs, it was delicious!!!!  My husband, daughter and I finished the entire thing.  Served it with Uncle Ben's Ready Whole Grain Roasted Garlic Rice and sugar snap peas.  Will definitely be making this again.  Oh, I only had the fire roasted diced tomatoes with garlic, so I used them.  Once again, this was AWESOME!  Can't wait to make it for company.

This was absolutely delicious!  However, I would double the sauce for 6 breasts.  I only used 3 breasts but made all the sauce and it was almost gone.  I made it exactly as stated except used stewed Italian tomatoes as this was what I had.  Give this recipe a try.  You will not be disappointed!!

Prepared this last night and we were impressed!  I did make the balsamic reduction as other reviewers suggested and WOW.  I can't wait to try it on pork and thighs.  Oh and I did add Italian green beans to make it more of a one dish meal.  I will difinitely be making this again.

Definately a great recipe.  Has a bit of tang from the balsamic.  I carmelized the onions first and halved the balsamic and had excellent flavor.

Loved this recipe and am a big fan of balsamic vinegar.  Would even add more next time.  As I continued adding ingredients, my husband kept saying, Oh that smells so good. We finished off the dish and had a merlot with it which was a perfect fit.

This was the first recipe that I've tried since joining Allrecipes, and it was just great! I followed the recipe with a few changes that I got from the other reviews. I will do this again. Can't wait for the wife to get home to try it.

Fantastic! The only change I made was too add a little sugar to account for cheaper Balsamic Vinegar, but this recipe was fabulous and will surely be a regular for our family.

I am a newlywed and really want to make our new apartment a home by cooking dinner for us more often.  My husband was watching ESPN in the living room and literally came into the kitchen once he smelled this cooking.  He kept telling me how great it smelled, and that he had been salivating for the past 10 minutes!  He also tried to convince me to let him fix a plate before it was even done.  This was a really great, healthy recipe – since there was only 2 of us, I halved the recipe as is except used the whole can of tomatoes anyways, to not be wasteful (we love tomatoes anyways).  We are adding this to the weeknight dinner recipe rotation.  Thanks!!

I thought this recipe was just ok. It was a bit too sweet for my taste buds but its certainly easy to make. Not sure I'll make it again.

Love this recipe! Sometimes I just use a bottle of Light Balsamic vinegarette and italian season diced tomatoes and omit the spices to make it even easier. Soooo yummy. Also, I'll add thin sliced zucchini to the mix too sometimes. It makes a really good addition!

We liked this – great flavor.  I made the recipe as written, but even though I love the flavor of balsamic vinegar, I did cut it in half.  I was concerned that it would overwhelm all the other flavors, but halving it was just right.  I would make this again for a flavorful, quick, weeknight meal.

Truly delicious.  My husband loved it so much he wanted to plan a dinner party with this dish as the main course.  There is an interesting flavor from the vinegar and tomatoes that is akin to sweetness but not quite.  Complex and interesting flavor.

Really good -  probably something to make every other week or so.  Since I was making this for one person, I only used one chicken breast half and reduced the other ingredients accordingly.

This was pretty good!  If chunking the chicken rather than using whole breast halves, you don't need to cook it as long (found that out the hard way).  I know some hate people who change recipes, but I did use fresh garlic instead of garlic salt, I chopped rather than sliced the onions, used fresh basil and rosemary as well as fresh tomatoes from the garden.  We also chose to thicken it with a little cornstarch/cold water as the kids don't do as well with super juicy sauces.  If you use fresh tomatoes and garlic, you will need to add a little salt to taste.  We served it over rice, with a salad.  Overall, very good and relatively fast, and going into the regular rotation.

I made this with a fig balsamic vinegar, cut the chicken into bite size pieces and marinated in the balsamic/herb mix for about 20 minutes. Served over rice, wonderful! The leftovers were great too!

I followed the recipe almost exactly.  The only change i made was that i only had diced tomatoes with oregano and basil instead of added the dried herbs.  It came out very delicious.  The chicken was juicy and i loved the addition of the onions.  I will definitely be making this again!

This recipe exceeded my expectations, we absolutely loved it. The chicken was so tender, and the onions just melted into the sauce. I am very very timid with balsamic vinegar, so I used just over a quarter cup balsamic and added an extra can of tomatoes. For our tastes it was flavored enough, I'll attempt a full half cup next time with 2 cans to follow the recipe closer. The tomato chunks seem to soak up the vinegar flavor and you get a great burst of tomato-balsamic flavor in each piece. The herbs complemented everything nicely. I will definitely make again, maybe someday with up to the written amount of vinegar: thanks so very much for sharing!

This was a big hit and will be added to our weekly rotation.  Did what many suggested and split the balsamic with low sodium chicken stock and it was a hit for everyone in the family.

A yummy, easy, and quick week night meal that tastes like you've been cooking all day!  The chicken is SO moist and flavorful.  I ended up serving it on top of spaghetti noodles and adding Parmesan cheese to help the sauce stick to the noodles better.  This would be perfect to cook for a date night because it looks so good on a plate!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND, would give it 6 stars if that were an option!

The balsalmic vinegar came through well but it just wasn't that interesting to me.  It seemed that it was about all I tasted.  I had reduced the BV to 1/4 c but it wasn't enough so went back to the 1/2 c.

I cook a lot with balsamic, so I had real concerns that 1/2 cup would overpower this dish.  I used equal amounts of chicken broth and balsamic to measure 1/2 cup, which gave us the balance of flavor we were looking for.  Used chicken cutlets which cook very quickly, so next time, I'm going to brown the onions a little bit before adding the chicken.  Easy dish with nice presentation.  We enjoyed this recipe.

4 stars!  The recipe didn't have enough sauce.  I  added a second can of Tomatoes, I like the mexican flavored they havea  zippy flavor, a small can of mushrooms, 5 heaping tablespoons bottled tomato sauce, lots more vinegar, chopped garlic.    Served with brown rice.  My version gave enough sauce to top the rice.  My doctored version, 10 STARS !!!!  DEEEEELISH !!

I NEEDED A QUICK CHICKEN RECIPE FOR DINNER AND DECIDED TO MAKE THIS CHICKEN USING DRUMS BECAUSE THAT WAS THE ONLY CHICKEN I HAD ON HAND. BUT OTHER THAN THAT FOLLOWED THE RECIPE AND MY FAMILY THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY GOOD.  I DIDNT HAVE THE BEST QUALITY BALSAMIC BUT PLAN ON GETTING SOME AND MAKING IT AGAIN AND AGAIN.

This was a very good, quick and easy dish.  I actually didn't have an onion but it came out great anyway.  Thanks!

I love balsamic but even this was a little much for me.  I added some chicken stock and water to tone it down, and it turned out delicious.  I also used fresh tomatoes from my garden instead of canned.

This surprised me.  It was much better than I was expecting.  I only added about 1/3 cup of Balsamic, but not because I didn't like it just that was all I had.  I will make this again.  I added some baby portobello mushrooms and it was really good.

This was wonderful! I did not have any onions so I left that out. I used a lot of garlic powder and basil. The tomatoes I used already had basil and I added more dried basil. I put the chicken on the plate with no sauce and then pasta on the side. I then topped off the pasta with fresh basil and shredded Parmesan cheese. Yum, yum, yum! Next time I will use the onion and try fresh garlic.

Delicious! We loved this served over pasta or just on its own with a big leafy green salad! One note though..if you've never tasted balsamic vinegar before you should def. try it before making this. If you're not wild about it to start with you will not like the results here at all. Cooking it down only intensifies the flavor.

I didn't care for it. I like balsamic vinegar and it was too balsamic-y for me. If I make it again, I'll prob sub some chicken stock.

While the hubby really enjoyed this flavor combo, I surprisingly found it too pungent with herbs (and normally, I love herbs!!).  It's pretty interesting, but a bit overwhelming - maybe there was too much rosemary.  However, the recommended amount of balsamic vinegar is just right.  As a sauce over noodles, it actually tastes great... just doesn't seem to work quite as well on the chicken.

Great flexible recipe.  I prefer flavors a little more subtle so the second time I made it I halved the vinegar and spices and chopped up the rosemary.  Also agree with mixing spices, vinegar and tomatoes together before adding to pan.  Looking forward to many variations using this as a base recipe.

This was wonderful! I made it for my parents and they wanted spoons to eat it right out of the skillet before it was even done! I didn't change anything except that I halved the recipe. If you take the time to let the sauce thicken, the taste of balsamic is less powerful and mixes perfectly with the tomato and herbs. Next time I'll try this with fresh tomatoes!

Oh, my!  This is delicious exactly as published!  I've also used this as a marinade for grilled chicken with delicious results!  A tip for those who don't like the vinegary taste:  Buy the most expensive balsamic vinegar you can afford.  It really does matter!  Williams-Sonoma has great reasonably priced balsamic vinegar, but Costco's balsamic vinegar gives you more bang for the buck and is *almost* as good!

I thought this was good, but a couple family members felt the balsamic was a little strong. 2nd time, I decreased balsamic to 1/4 cup and finished with chicken broth.  Very good and all enjoyed.

This was ok.  I think I messed it up when I went with anoter reviewer's suggestion to use tomato sauce instead of diced tomatoes - it ended up tasting like BBQ sauce.  Also, next time I'd halve the spices.  They completely overwhelmed the balsalmic taste.

I found this recipe from supercooks.com (website where you put food items you already have in your house, and it finds recipes).  I loved that I didn't have to buy a thing!  This tasted similar to my favorite Chicken Mirabella recipe.  I did add a little chicken stock to the sauce since my husband isn't as big a fan of balsmic vinegar like I am.

Overall, this was an enjoyable meal.   My 6 year old and 4 year old both cleaned their plates.  I made the following changes:  I used a can of tomato sauce instead of diced tomatoes (my kids hate chunks of tomato), 1/2 tsp Rosemary and 1/4 tsp Thyme.  I think the diced tomatoes would have tasted better, and I will try it next time.  I will also brown the chicken with freshly minced garlic, rather than using garlic salt.  I served it over brown rice.  A good meal that was quickly prepared.

Much more flavorful than other healthy recipes I have tried, but I expected more when I saw the rave reviews. I myself am a huge fan of balsamic vinegar, but this recipe wasn't my favorite. However, it wasn't bland, and that earns it 4 stars.

This chicken is excellent!  Great flavor and my kids loved it.  Easy and quick to cook.  It is great just the way it is.  I used Weight Watchers recipe builder and it comes out to 5 points per serving, which is also a huge plus!  I will make this again and again.

This was a great weeknight recipe!  I made a few changes by cutting the chicken into (just larger than) bite-sized chunks.  About halfway through browning the chicken I added a clove and a half of diced garlic and when adding the tomatoes and balsamic vinegar I also threw in a can of (drained and rinsed) quartered artichoke hearts - thanks to the suggestion of another reviewer.  While the chicken was simmering in the vinegar and tomatoes I broiled some asparagus, cut into 1-inch pieces, with olive oil, salt & pepper, and threw them into the chicken just before I took it off the stove.  I served this over brown rice.  It received rave reviews from my boyfriend (who has a self-proclaimed discerning palette). 5 stars! This will definitely go into the rotation!

YUM!!!  This was soooo good! I used chicken thighs (we like them better).  I caramelized the onions in the pan then removed them to brown the chicken.  After the chicken was browned I threw on the onions, some shitake mushrooms, Kirkland balsamic vinegar (from Costco), fresh garlic, rosemary from my garden, and since I didn't have any canned tomatoes, I used almost 2 cups diced fresh tomatoes with 1T tomato paste.  This was absolutely fantastic!!  I will definitely make this again and again.  It was not too "vinegary" it was absolutely wonderful!!

OMG!!!  This was soooooo good.  I don't like altering recipes but had to based on what I had on-hand.  I used turkey cutlets instead of chicken.  It was okay but will definitely use chicken next time.  But let me tell you about the sauce!  It was amazing.  I only used 1/8 of a cup of Balsamic Vinegar and the whole can of tomatoes (with the juice -- do NOT drain it) and it was perfect.  I added fresh mushrooms.  My husband and kids loved this meal.  Will definitely make it a staple item in my home.

This was delicious! I didn't really make any changes to the recipe (I didn't measure the herbs) and the sauce is full of flavor. I think I'm going to try making a spaghetti sauce using this recipe as well as making this recipe in a slow cooker. I bet the chicken will be even better after cooking all day in this sauce.

My children and I loved this recipe.  My husband thought that the balsamic flavor was a little strong.  I will definitely keep it in my "keeper" file and make it when my husband is not having dinner with us.

Fantastic.  I made this with Italian style diced tomatoes and forgot to add more spices (oops!) but it still tasted great.  Turned out really moist and flavorful.  Serve with brown rice and green beans!

I was looking for something quick and healthy, this was just that. I followed the recipe exactly except I used fresh basil because I had some and added zucchini. I loved the taste but then I love balsamic.

I am on a low cal diet and finding new recipes has become a challenge. This is a perfect chicken recipe that has plenty of flavor. I didn't have a chance to read other reviews before making this dish but luckily I know how powerful balsamic vinegar can be and cut it in half. I also cut the rosemary in half. It still looked as if it may be overseasoned but luckily it was not. I would season to taste as a suggestion. The sauce is wonderful. I will use the leftovers for a pasta dish tomorrow night. Quick, easy and flavorful. I definately will make this again.

I used two chicken breasts, the same amount of tomatoes and onion and reduced the vinegar to 1/4 cup. Seasoned the chicken with sea salt and black pepper and added two cloves of garlic (one minced, one crushed) in the beginning. Soo delicious! I usually don't like white meat chicken but this cooking method makes it soo moist and yummy. I spooned the extra sauce over noodles (and have some left over!) and added a side of green beans. Love love love!!

Everyone in the family loved this. I have to say this is a great recipe, cheap, easy and extremely flavorful. Husband and son were fighting for the leftovers. i was concerned about the vinegar, so I added the chicken stock to it, but we love balsamic vinegar and i ended up adding more to the end. thanks for a great recipe

This was pretty darn good. Next time I think I'll cut down on the spices, it seemed like a lot. I cooked everything in the dutch oven for about 3 hours at 250 degrees. When it was done, I took the chicken out and put the sauce in the food processor. The end result was great!

Very good, my tomatoes did make it a little too watery, so next time I will drain them better.  Served with cheese ravioli.  I also threw everything in the crockpot and turned on low for the day.  Worked very well!

It was good. I would use a little less vinegar next time to cut down on the tartness (which my boyfriend loved!)  And I would sprinkle it with a little parmesan cheese before serving.

Simple and tasty.  I did half balsamic and half chicken stock because I thought it might be too strong for the kids.  I might try it full strength next time.  Served over whole wheat pasta.

Very flavorful, and super easy to make--with ingredients I already had on hand! I used chicken tenderloins and tossed in some mushrooms while I was cooking the chicken and onions, and used a minced clove of garlic instead of garlic salt (will use more next time). Served with baked asparagus topped with the extra juice. The boyfriend and I vacuumed this up! Will definitely make again soon.

The balsamic vinegar was overpowering...Probably about half would have been sufficient.

This recipe is soooo good. I used Chicken legs and wings instead of chicken breast and used half the balsamic vinegar and substituted broth instead. I will make this recipe again and again!

Very good, very easy.  I already had Tilapia defrosted so I thought what the heck...I used fish.  I really enjoyed the ease and flavor of this one pot dish.  I had fresh Rosemary so I used that, and I did cut back the dried herbs to about 3/4 teaspoon each since the fish is so mild.  I served it over angel hair pasta.  Great for a busy night.

Unfortunately, this recipe was not a winner in my home. I heard, "Tastes like salsa" and, "Is this ketchup?" I used half good balsamic and half chicken stock and thickened it a bit with roux to go over pasta. I used half the dried herbs called for (and substituted fresh basil and fresh garlic), and the taste of the herbs was overpowering... as was the sourness of the balsamic.

I feel like this is more of a 3.5 star rating, but since that's not an option I will go with my husband's advice. First of all, I read through many many reviews and decided to cut back on the balsamic vinegar...despite the fact that I really like balsamic vinegar & I used a good kind. I am glad that I did because it was pretty "tangy", which is what my husband liked about it. I, on the other hand, liked the taste but thought that the vinegar overpowered the other herbs & seasonings. What is the point of adding all the other stuff if all you can taste is the vinegar? So, I will be making this again and will probably play around with it...good starting point though.

I made this following the recipe exactly.  The chicken was ok (a little dry), but everything else was a waste.  I threw it all in the trash.  The kids wouldn't touch it and my husband asked me never to make this again.

Perfect for a nice meal after work. Extremely quick and easy to throw together, but tastes like you spent hours on it! It will definitely be added to the rotation of meals.

Added extra tomato sauce, used chopped fresh rosemary (out of dried), threw in chopped celery (had it sitting on the counter), and simmered for 30 minutes instead of 15.....incredible.

My husband does not like balsamic vinegar so I took the advice of another reviewer who said not to write this recipe off if you do not like balsamic vinegar. I used 2 tablespoons of balsamic and then added chicken broth to equal 1/2 a cup. It was delicious and my husband and I both loved it. Even my picky 2 year old ate it. We were able to taste the balsalmic vinegar in the dish, but it was not overpowering for my husband. We will definatley be making this again.

Too much balsamic vinegar. Glad I tasted at 1/4 cup. Like other reviewers, needed to add some brown sugar to make it edible. Won't make again, although possibly decreasing the vinegar to a splash or two may improve. The seasonings otherwise were okay.

Delicious!  My husband couldn't get over how simple and tasty this recipe was.  I used 1/4 cup balsamic just to ensure my 18 month old would eat it.  I was afraid it might become to vinegary.  Reheated nicely as well.  Would definitely make again!

Very good recipe!  I only used 4 chicken breasts, however.  The rest of the recipe was as-is.  I think the sauce would be a bit sparse with 6.     The leftover sauce goes great on garlic toast. :)

Yummy!  I didn't have any canned tomatoes but I did have three fresh romas in my fridge, so I cut those up and used them in place of the canned.  It was quite tangy which I really liked, as did my boyfriend.  This was way easy to make and I will make again.

Fantastic!!  The only thing I changed was to add 2 cloves of fresh garlic instead of garlic salt, and to simmer for about 1/2 hr to 45 mins to reduce the amount of liquid.  Even my picky child loves this chicken!  Great with basmati rice.

I love balsamic vinegar in combination with almost everything, so I was really looking forward to this recipe. When I was cooking it, however, I got rather alarmed as the kitchen started to smell only like very strong onion and tomatoes - which normally I like, but not when so overpowering. I was really worried that that smell was what the sauce and the chicken would taste of. When it came time to eat, I grabbed the chicken, leaving as much sauce as I could in the pan. The amount remaining on the chicken was excellent, and the chicken was juicy and tender. However, I served this with rice, and I was rather disappointed that the sauce (including all the tomatoes, etc) was doomed to be thrown away. Also, although in the end it turned out well, I don't know if I'd make this again, just because the sheer smell was so off-putting to me.

This recipe was easy and very tasty. I added some minced garlic  and a little chicken broth to give additional flavor as others had suggested. The leftovers were even better because the balsamic vinegar taste had soaked into the chicken. This is a keeper.

Delicious! I made this in the skillet, but this will be a future consideration for the crock pot as well.

I was looking for a dish that matched one I had in a local eatery and this is it.  IF your sauce is too tangy - you did not use a good quality Balsamic.  It should be almost like a syup.  I added some veggies to the sauce to camalize before I added the chicken so the chicken wouldn't get too well done.

MMMMM good.  I cooked a whole ton of this and ate it over whole wheat spaghetti every night for a week and didn't even get sick of it!  The only slight change I made was to use the "italian style" diced tomatoes that include some herbs and then add a little extra seasoning (dried oregano, garlic powder, salt, pepper, I think) while cooking.  Very delish, chicken was so juicy, and sauce was tangy and wonderful.  I am a big fan of balsamic, so I loved the tart flavor.  Will definitely make again.

Even my teenaged boys liked this! I've made it with both chicken and pork - I think I like the pork better - you can use a tougher cut of pork and simmer it longer with a little more water/stock added. I used a little less balsamic than indicated.

Very good recipe.  Reminds me alot of Bourbon Chicken...the kind from the Big Easy!  Took a few onions out, and didnt have any thyme, but other than that, the recipe worked out great.

The flavor was decent, but a little too much punch for the family's taste. I even cut the vinegar in half and replaced it with broth. I guess you have to have a preference for the vinegar.

Absolutely fabulous!!!! One of my favorites that I've gotten from this site! However, I did tweek it a little bit. I seasoned with just salt and pepper and sauteed fresh garlic cloves in the pan before adding the chicken, omitting the chopped onion (don't like to bite into a piece of onion, just a personal preference) but adding onion powder to the seasonings. I used diced tomatoes that were canned with garlic and olive oil and were already seasoned so I cut back on the basil and oregano and omitted the rosemary and thyme (keep in mind if your tomatoes aren't pre-seasoned you won't have to do this. Also instead of plain balsamic I used an aged balsamic-chipotle glaze and it was incredible!!! I think the spice truly made the dish, so definitely add some if it's what you like!

This chicken had a lot of flavor but only giving it four stars because it tasted a lot like vinegar.  Worth trying though and still may make again someday.

Very good! I just made this for my boyfriend and myself. He loved it and so did I. I omitted the rosemary because I didn't have any on hand, and accidentally dumped in too much oregano and basil, but it still tasted awesome. Also, I heated the olive oil, added some minced garlic, and on top of that seasoned the chicken with garlic salt and freshly ground black pepper. It was nice and quick and easy to make, perfect for a weeknight. Paired with leftover scalloped potatoes and steamed green beans, which proved to go together well.

I would rate this 3.5 if I could. I definately suggest the chicken broth and cook the contents until it has a syrup texture. I might make this again and add a little brown sugar perhaps to cut the bitterness or a bay leaf to cut the acid. I also used a very good balsamic vinegar , and served with rice.

Major go-to recipe for me. I love this one! I almost always have the supplies on hand. I don't change a thing EXCEPT cutting the balsamic in half, and adding in 1/4 cup chicken broth to make up the liquid difference. Very good. Very tasty!

This was fast, easy and good! Double the sauce with 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar and 1/2 cup chicken stock. If you use diced Italian tomatoes you don't need any of the extra spices. I also added garlic and mushrooms when I was browning the chicken/onions. Sauce IS thin so serve over rice.

SUPERB!!!!  This dish was absolutely delicious.  The only change I made to the recipe was adding mushrooms to the sauce.  And, wow, that sauce is to die for.  The balsamic vinegar and diced tomatoes got nice and thick and syrupy after simmering for 15 minutes.  Served this over rice, but pasta would be excellent too. Fantastic recipe, Moonandback!

This was awesome. Quick, easy and extremely delicious. Made it on a weeknight after a rough day at work, and it was just the pick me up I needed. Used 3 chicken breasts instead of six, so had plenty of extra veggies and tangy sauce to enjoy with the rice. Will definitely be putting this on my regular list of things to make.

This was a great recipe!  My husband and I loved it, but of course, I made some changes.  Instead of garlic salt, I used 3 cloves of fresh garlic, and added a pinch of salt to the chicken.  I also used red onions which gives it a slightly sweeter taste (to combat the tang of the vinegar).  I also didn't add the tomatoes (I used 3 fresh plum tomatoes) til the end in order to keep them somewhat firm.  Served it over garlic mashed potatoes and it was a hit!  Thanks for the great recipe!

The chicken was very moist (I used bone-in, with skin and just peeled the skin off when eating) but it wasn't flavorful enough for me. I thought the vinegar flavor wasn't strong enough.  The only substitutions I made were real garlic, no rosemary and fresh thyme.

Quick and easy! The mixture of the balsamic vinegar and tomatoes, along with the spices, made a kind of barbecue sauce (and because the edges of my pan "burned" a bit, it even had a slightly smoky flavor -- in a good way). Definitely a keeper for those "gotta get dinner on the table quick!" nights.

awesome! Must make a again.  I used this recipe as a rough guide. Used 2 large chicken breasts, 1 onion, 2 cloves garlic, 2 T olive oil, 1/2 big can of diced tomatoes, good big swig of balsamic vinegar, generous couple of pinches of italian herbs, added one can of artichoke hearts. cooked for 20 minutes after braising, uncovered, and chicken was nice and tender. Served with greenbeans and rice.  Boyfriend loved it.

Very good.  I didn't reduce the amount of balsamic vinegar like other reviewers suggested, and found it to be fine.  I let the sauce reduce while waiting for my veggies.  I'll make this again.

This chicken was great, easy to prepare and tasted delicious. I halved the amount of balsamic vinegar as sugested because I was concerned the flavor would be too strong for the kids. Everybody enjoyed it.

My husband didn't care for it but that's not the recipe's fault as he hates Balsamic, however this gets a big 5 star from me as I absolutely loved it.

Edible - but not impressed. Too vinegary, no depth  of flavor.

Very easy to make and quite tasty. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I did think it needed either a little less balsamic or a little sugar to balance the acidity of the dish. Other than that it was a hit at our house.

this was only ok. It was vinegary... almost had a BBQ-like quality. I  did not measure the spices, but I don't think that would have affected the overall outcome that much. I would not recommend this.

This was really good.  My husband liked it and said it tasted "gourmet".  Seemed like there was just something missing.  Maybe I'll put fresh garlic in next time.

My bf gave it 3 out 5 which I guess coming from him isn't bad because he is super picky! I was trying to find different ways to make chicken and I was happy with the results.  I think next time I will cut down a little on the balsamic but I will make this again

Yum!  This was a tasty and easy one-pan dish.  I really like the fact that recipe can be made without having to make an extra trip to the store for ingredients.  I used fresh herbs since I had some that I wanted to get rid of and added approximately three T. black olives (that was all I had left in the fridge) and 1/3 c. chopped mushrooms.  Artichokes would be good to add as well; I always like to make recipes healthier in any way I can, so extra veggies often find their way in!  :) To combat the vinegar taste that many reviewers mentioned, I used one T. brown sugar and the taste was just right.  I prepared this for my mom and two sisters and everyone loved it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very Good. Very Easy. I followed the recipie as directed only adding some crushe/chopped garlic. I will DEFINATELY make this again (added to my regulars) and expirement making changes. It's great as is and already looks delish, I just want a little more 'something'... I'll update when I figure out what that something is.

This is Wonderful! We love the balsamic vinegar taste though. I did add a bit of chicken broth, as the kids need things tamed down a little for them, but this was delicious and they ate it up as well! Thanks!!

Wow!!! This one's a keeper. There is so much flavor (but not overpowering) in this. I didn't think it would have that much flavor from the simple ingredients. One of the best things about this for me is that I almost always have all of these ingredients on hand. I used a red onion and added an extra 1/2 teas. of freeze dried chopped garlic in with the other spices. You could easily tweak this recipe to your liking, maybe throw in some thinly sliced green or red bell pepper, or even use steak in place of chicken. I took some of the leftover pan juices, onions and tomatoes and mixed with some plain brown rice for a complementing side dish. Chicken was perfectly tender. Keeper!!

What a super easy recipe with so much flavor!  This was easy to make, easy on my house in the hot summer eat (skillet cooking), used things I had on hand in my pantry and the husband and kids loved it!  Low in fat and chicken was tender, too!  I used fresh diced tomatoes and a mix of balsamic and red raspberry vinegar and it was wonderful!  I served it with brown rice and a mixed veggie.  Highly recommended and I will make this again!

I wasn't a big fan of this recipe. I had hoped for maybe some kind of a bruschetta flavor, but it really was way too overpowerng with the herbs, and the balsamic taste was lost somewhere in between. Perhaps if the chicken had marinated prior to grilling it may have made a difference as well. I probably won't make again.

EXCELLENT FLAVOR! Added minced garlic along with some mushrooms to mine and it was FANTASTIC!  The sauce would also be great as a Bruschetta mix served cold with toasted french bread!!! Yum!!  Will definitely be making this again and again!!!

Used organic chicken breast and added asparagus to the simmering process in a cast iron pan. The asparagus gave it some more volume, eliminating the need for a side dish. It was excellent and easy to make!

If you are at all "unsure" about the balsamic taste, this may not be a great recipe for you.  The vinegar was a big overwhelming for my personal taste and combined with the tomatoes (maybe should have added a little sugar?)...it was just too much.

This chicken was different. I would definitely make it again, but not every week. I also cut the vinegar down to 1/4 cup. I am glad I did because the vinegar taste was very strong. I cut the chicken breast up into big pieces and served it over rice and had broccoli as a side.

Made this the other night and it was really good. I only had Rotel on hand and used that instead of regular diced tomatos and it came out great! Also added more garlic. Next time I would use either thin sliced chicken cutlets or tenders instead. The breasts didn't absorb much of the flavor of the sauce which was wonderful!

This was very good! 

I used the full amount of balsamic vinegar. I omitted rosemary and thyme, as I didn't have them on hand. I cut back significantly on the onion - only used about 1/4 onion.

The chicken was among the most moist that I've ever had.

I was shy to try out this recipe, as I'm not a fan of vinegar of any kind, but decided to give this recipe a try. How could I not, with such rave reviews?

I served the chicken with broiled asparagus and a crunchy artisan bread.

Everything was delicious. Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

This was EXACTLY my taste!! The only thing I did not add was thyme since I didn´t have any. My bf loved it too!! I served it with seasoned penne pasta, yet there was way more then enough sauce for the pasta as well!! Next time I will use the sauce to go on the pasta...less work for me!! :P

I made this last night and my fiance and I loved it.  I did cut the balsamic vinegar to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup of chicken broth as some others suggested.  I only made 3 breasts, but made the full amount of sauce.  I allowed the breasts to simmer in the sauce for about 45 minutes, covered, and they turned out very tender.  I served them over penne pasta and it was a very complete meal.  I will definitely make this again.

The chicken was turned out great but wasn't really my choice of flavors. I think I'll scale back the vinegar a bit next time.

Enjoyed this recipe. I only made two chicken breasts but still made the full amount of sauce and enjoyed that because it was so tasty! I added extra balsamic because we're huge fans of it.

Way too much vinegar! No one really liked it here.  Will never make again. I just don't understand why nearly 700 people love this recipe. We had to drink a bottle of wine to get it down!

I cut the chicken into strips and cooked it that way.  It turned out pretty good!  I bet it would taste good over pasta.

Tasteless and way to much liquid. The only thing I had changed is that I used fresh tomatoes. Not recommended.

I followed the recipe exactly, but left out the thyme because I didn't have any. It was absolutely delicious and I don't think that sugar needed to be added to the sauce as others have suggested. I served this with seasoned rice (from a package) and veggie medley (frozen) and the combo was great. Next time I will either marinate the chicken in the vinegar, or cut the chicken into strips before cooking. The sauce did not penetrate the whole chicken breast, so it could have been more flavorful. I just now had the leftovers - cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces and let it soak up a lot of the sauce as I warmed it in the microwave. Delicious!

I cut the chicken breasts into tenderloin sized strips.  I sprinkled salt, pepper, and garlic powder on the chicken, then marinated in the balsamic vinegar.  In the pan, I used olive oil and a tablespoon of butter.  I also used minced garlic along with the onion.  When I tossed in the chicken and remaining vinegar that didn't soak in.  With a dash of brown sugar in with the spices and diced tomato, the taste wasn't too tart but just right!  I plated the chicken and added grated Parmesan.  The sauce was fantastic with pasta, and I served green beans too.  This was quick and easy, but most importantly, satisfyingly tasty!

Excellent prepared just as written. Be sure to use a good quality Balsamic. I've made this several times. All turned out great except for time I used a cheap Balsamic. Chicken lacked the flavor then.

As a weight watchers couple we eat this nearly weekly adding in a 3/4 cup of cooked rice(per serving) to soak up the juices is a 9 point meal this is flavorful and sticks to your ribs (without showing up on your hips!)

This was a good recipe, and  I was surprised that my 2 and 3 year olds liked it. I cut the chicken up into bite sized pieces prior to cooking. I also increased everything to make more sauce. I used 1 1/2 onions, about 3/4 cup of the vinegar and 3/4 cup of broth. I doubled the spices and herbs and I did add a little corn startch to thicken. Definitly would make again.

This chicken was very good.  I was afraid it to be too syrupy, but it wasn't.  I did feel like the tomatoes tasted to vinegary, might add them even later next time. Overall, pretty good though.

Great recipe.  Basic ingredients, and tastes wonderful.  I used real garlic instead of garlic salt.  I used 1/4 cup of vinegar based on the other reviews.  My husband thought that was the perfect amount, and would not have wanted any more, while I wouldn't have minded more - so I guess it just depends on much you like balsamic vinegar

Very very tasty recipe!! I reduced the Balsamic vinegar to almost 1/4 cup and used chicken broth to equal 1/2 cup. It was the perfect amount to make it delicious without overpowering. I served it with the juices ove rice. Yummy!

I made several amendments to this recipe: I used fresh garlic cloves instead of garlic salt; I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned tomatoes; and I added LOTS of fresh cilantro. Also, I allowed the pan to simmer until the balsamic vinegar became thick. The resulting dish was delicious. Next time, however, I will use more onions. My brother, who does not care for balsamic flavours, rated my dish a 7.5 out of 10. I will be making this again (though I may decrease the amount of balsamic if my brother is joining me for dinner).

Update 11/2/14: I just made this recipe again with half garlic powder and half minced garlic (jarred), fresh tomato, and no thyme (didn't have any). I followed the rest of the recipe closely and cooked until chicken reached 165F and the balsamic vinegar reduced. The resultant dish was delicious! I love that it is quick, healthy, easy, hearty, and oh-so-good!

Recommendations:
-To avoid overcooking or undercooking chicken, use a meat thermometer 
-Consider increasing herbs/balsamic mix by 50% and cook in a wide, shallow pan to avoid long reducing time. 

Verdict 
I will make this again and often!

This recipe offered a lot of flavor, but i think adding some type of sugar base to the chicken and marinating it for a bit would absorb more flavor. Next time, I will try to add some lemon-lime soda. I also added some chicken broth to the pan and let the chicken simmer in it. That made a great sauce. I was also unable to brown the chicken. Next time I will brown the onions, then take the onions out of the pan, brown the chicken, then add the onions back in. I would also saute some fresh chopped garlic in the pan.

This is especially good if you let the sauce simmer for quite awhile to thicken more. The balsamic vinegar gets a much deeper sweeter taste.

This recipe was delicious! I went with other reviewers suggestions and cut down on the vinegar a little as I was afraid of the strong flavor...but regretted it! Next time I'll go with the whole she-bang! Very good, served to company and it was enjoyed all around. Served with roasted rosemary/garlic mini potatoes and green beans. YUM! Will be making again and again!!

I thought this was really good. I've made it twice so far.  The only things I did different was use less spices and I cut up the chicken. I'm not a fan of cooked tomatos, so I think maybe next time I'll use fresh and only cook them for a little bit.

I've served this recipe many times when we have dinner guests; it's very easy to prepare and holds up to just about any restaurant chicken dish - superb flavors. I pair with wild rice and roasted asparagus.

What a pleasant, healthy tasting dish!  A couple of changes - I didn't have balsamic vinegar, so I used 1/2 cup red wine vinegar with 1 tablespoon sugar and reduced it to half (great substitute), then mixed with 1/2 cup chicken broth.

I didnt really like this recipe. I did everything the way that viewers had suggested. The flavors werent there for me or my husband. Maybe our palate's cannot appreciate the sophisticated flavors of balsamic vinegar. I have no idea, but this one wasnt for us.

Needed less balsamic and a bit of sugar to offset all the acid.

I browned the onions, fresh garlic and chicken then deglazed the pan with a little white wine and used fresh herbs. I served it over rice and everyone really enjoyed it.  I used canned diced tomatoes that already had a little garlic, basil and oregano.

I found this recipe a little acidic and heavy on the balsamic vinegar but I found if I tweaked it a bit I liked it a lot better: reduce to 1/3 cup of balsamic vinegar, reduce to 1/2 tsp rosemary, use 2 cloves of crushed garlic rather than garlic powder and add 2 tbsp of tomato paste to the recipe. Tasty.

The only down side of this recipe was that I used the rest of my high quality balsamic vinegar for it.....was it worth it?  YOU BET!!  This was really very good.  The only alteration I made to the recipe was that I used fresh basil and I didn't have any thyme:(  When I make it again I will probably cut down on the balsamic a little bit and will cut down on the oregano.  It was the one spice I could taste above the rest.  I will also up the basil.  The way I see it olive oil, basil and tomatoe is a classic and I'll go with 2 tablespoons of the basil and cut back on the oregano to 1/2 teaspoon.  I'll also serve this with pasta.  It was great and the best part is I have everything in my staples.  Thanks for sharing!

I am a huge Balsamic fan so knew I wouldnt have a problem using the full amount.  Added minced garlic when browning and also used stewed tomatoes instead of the diced, which was a great texture combination.  I choose to serve with gnocchi for a change of pace and it was delish!!  In a separate pan I sautéed zucchini with 2 spoonfuls of the sauce from the chicken and a dash of Dijon mustard to jazz it up.  WHAT A WONDERFUL MEAN!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!!

Delicious and very easy to prepare. I added 1T. of brown sugar as suggested by other reviewers to cut down on acidity, but I really don't think the recipe needed it. Next time I'll make it without the sugar. The balsamic I used was surprisingly mellow! Great recipe!

This was very good!  Next time I'll thicken the sauce a bit, but other than that it's great.  I followed one reviewer's suggestion and used the left over sauce for pasta and it was tasty.

This is my new favorite chicken recipe! My husband doesn't care much for most poultry, but he loved this dish. The only thing I did differently was to sauté minced garlic with the onions to add a little extra zing.

On a scale of 1-10, we only gave this dish a 5. Found the tomatoes and vinegar taste to be a little too tart for our tastebuds. Not sure what the sauce needed, but tart and bland were not a great mix.

My husband described it in one word ,"Winner".  He's not a fan of vinegar so I used less balsamic.  Next time, I'll try to make it more saucy for me.

Very good, very easy.  I was a bit hesitant at the amount of balsamic, but it was not overpowering at all.  Dish was eaten by all members of the family at dinner with no complaining.  I'll be adding to dinner rotation.

I served this up at a dinner party to rave reveiws from my guests - kept it warm in my slow cooker.  Perfect for entertaining - simple, and no creamy sauce etc to form a skin over an extended evening of eating.  Easily scaled up and best of all DELICIOUS

I was really looking forward to eating this, but it was just okay.  The flavors tasted fine - I liked the tomato-balsamic combination, but it really didn't do anything extraordinary for the chicken.  It wasn't dried out, but it also wasn't really as moist as I hoped it would be.  We may make this again, but put our own spin on it.  As is, it was overall just "fine" - we could take it or leave it.

Very good! I made this recipe for supper tonight, and both my husband and son gave this one the thumbs-up sign. This was made exactly as written and served with rice. Next time I'll leave myself enough time to mix up a green salad and a homemade loaf of bread to go along with. Thanks for sharing this recipe; we really enjoyed it.

My husband and I are crazy about this recipe!!  The balsamic vinegar adds amazing flavor to the chicken--in fact, I've found that adding all three spices is unnecessary, and typically just add a small amount of basil OR oregano.  The recipe is "special" enough for company and easy enough to throw together at the last minute--I typically have these ingredients on hand.    I echo other cooks who have posted--if you aren't crazy about balsamic vinegar, this may not be the recipe for you.

Way too much vinegar. And I really like Balsamic Vinegar. It completly overpowered any other flavor going on on the dinner plate. I ended up throwing out the leftovers because no one would eat them. Too bad...

Made this one for dinner tonight, served over angel hair pasta - it was wonderfully simple.  I used just a bit less balsamic vinegar (1/3rd cup), and it had wonderful flavor!!!
Thanks for the great recipe!

This meal is great tasting and super easy to make! I added some green peppers and mushrooms to the onion and chicken, and some mozzarella cheese on top of the chicken when it was nearly done.  I served this over pasta and it was great!

This recipe is fantastic! Simple enough for a weeknight, but impressive enough for company.  We served ours on a bed of mashed potatoes with extra "gravy" poured over the chicken and a side of steamed broccoli.

I thought this recipe was very easy and delicious however my husband who is a cook did not enjoy the actual taste, he thought something was missing.  I still give this recipe four stars.  And the kids loved it!

We really didn't care for this.  We found that the balsamic was a little too potent.  If I could figure a way to tone it down, I may make it again, but I doubt it.  We have leftovers in the freezer, which I am sure my husband is not too anxious to eat again.

This was very tasty and easy to do.  Made this for guests this past weekend, and they enjoyed it so much they asked for the recipe as well!  As another reviewer suggested, I added fresh garlic as well (with the onions).

Fantastic!  The changes I made: Cut up the chicken, replaced fresh garlic for garlic salt and added brown mushrooms.  This is perfect over sticky rice, the sauce soaks into the rice and it is oh so yummy!

Surprisingly very delicious. I cut my chicken into strips, and instead of using the full teaspoon of garlic salt, I did 1/2 tsp. and then did a bit of additional garlic powder cos I am trying to cut back on my salt intake. I was out of oregano, so I did 3/4 tsp. of Italian seasoning and upped the rosemary a bit. We ate this over whole wheat spaghetti, and it was delicious. I think using high quality balsamic makes a big difference.

This is a great low cal entree! I served it with pasta & a salad & it was really great. However, I did have to alter it some. I added some wine (I use it in almost everything) with the chicken while sauteeing. I also used only fresh herbs & tomatoes. After following all the instructions, I just felt like it was really missing something. At that point I would have given it about 3 stars. I added about four cloves of garlic and it was exactly what it needed! What a difference. It was excellent after that. I will definitely be making this often!

Great recipe!  I also used 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, cubed the chicken and served over bow-tie pasta in a bowl.  We also enjoyed some romano cheese sprinkled over the dish.

This dish was really good. My hubby and BIL even liked it and they can be pretty picky! I used the full 1/2 cup balsamic and I added half a yellow bell pepper and half a red bell pepper. I also used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt and next time I will use fresh herbs and probably the whole bell peppers. Thanks for a great healthy recipe!

This was excellent!  I only added half the vinegar as other people suggested and am glad I did; it was the perfect balance of flavors.  The whole amount would have been overwhelming!

This was delicious!  I had some fresh mushrooms that needed to be used, so I sliced them and sauted them with the onions and chicken -- very good.

I used 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar and 1/4 cup vegetable broth and the balsamic flavor was still way too overpowering for my taste.  The chicken was nice a juicy but we didn't care for the sauce.

Although I love balsamic vinegar, I felt it was too overpowering in this dish. The chicken came out very juicy and tender, but I couldn't eat more than half of it before the sourness was too much for me. I most likely will not make this again. Thanks anyway!

So easy, savory and light.  Everyone I serve it to wants the recipe. Fresh herbs make it so much better. Grow your own, they grow like weeds.  I freeze the abundance.  So, so much better than dry.

I loved this recipe. I did make a few changes.  I didn't have balsamic vinegar on hand, so I used red wine vinegar. I also only added 1/4 cup of vinagar as suggested previously.I only browned 3 chicken breasts which was wonderful, as I had enough sauce to serve over the chicken. I didn't have the herbs mentioned, but it was still good. I served the chicken and sauce on brown rice.  It was SO delicious. Thank you so much for a great recipe.

This was real fast and real good.  Hubby who is pretty picky gave this a thumbs up!  The balsamic vinegar gave this a really nice sweetness to the sauce.  The chicken breasts were gone (only made 3), but I couldn't bear to dump the sauce.  Serve this with some pasta to fully enjoy this!  Yum!

I'd had such high hopes for this recipe, but neither of us was impressed.  I only used 4 bs breasts (kept everything else the same) and served over rice with a side of green beans.  Won't be making again.

My husband and I were not fans of this recipe.  The Balsamic taste was way too strong for us.  Just personal taste I think - it was still fun to try a new dish!

I scaled this recipe down to 1 serving, and I don't think it came out as good as if it was made with the original serving size.  Basically, if you make this for one, add a lot more balsamic!  And also brown the chicken first before doing the onions, since there are so few, and wait a little bit before putting in the tomatoes (I used fresh Roma, also, which I thought was better than canned; also used fresh basil).  I agree with the other reviews that adding garlic would be fantastic.  I cut up the chicken and put it over angel hair, then made a balsamic reduction sauce to pour over it since I didn't think there was enough.  That helped a little, but maybe I just really like balsamic more than the average person.  So, I give it 3 stars for this time but I think it has the potential to get 5 next time :)

This recipe was absolutely excellent! I was looking for something quick to cook with the ingredients I already had on hand. I changed it slightly and used a few garlic cloves, which I would recommend doing if your a garlic fan. Also, I used skinless, boneless chicken tenders in place of chicken breasts. I think this would be a great slow cooker meal as well as a pan-friend meal.

This recipe is so easy to make and tastes really really good!  I think the next time I will use 1/3 rather than 1/2 cup of balsamic vinegar though.  I love balsamic vinegar, but the amount that this recipe calls for was too much for me.

This recipe took only about 20-25 minutes to finish from start to finish.  I ate it on top some whole grain pasta with garlic bread on the side.  Delicious!  

As other reviewers stated, it doesn't look so pretty, but on top of pasta it looks beautiful and tastes great.  It tastes like something I might purchase at Olive Garden or The Cheesecake Factory.  This is one food that also smells great while you are cooking it!  

I am bad with leftovers.  I can usually eat a dish once and can't eat it anymore until after several days.  This will be coming out tomorrow for lunch though!  This will definitely become one of my regular menu items.

VERY VERY GOOD! Absolutely a 5* recipe! My husband fell in LOVE with the sauce! He'd like to use this sauce anywhere a recipe calls for marinara, and loved it on the basmati rice I made to go a long with the chicken.  I did add appx 2t cornstarch (mixed with cold water) to the sauce to thicken prior to serving. The only problem I had was that the chicken didn't get fully cooked in the amount of time the recipe called for - I ended up covering the skillet and cooking about 10 minutes longer...they were kind of large pieces, so, if you want to stick to the cooking time of 15 minutes, you may want to flatten the chicken prior to cooking.  Excellent and very different! Thank you for sharing this tasty recipe!

What a wonderful chicken dish!  I have been looking for something different, to get out of the "dinner rut" I often find myself in.  This was a fantastic dish, easy to fix, FAST!! The cooked down Balsamic vinegar leaves the chicken slightly tangy, which will be a joy for your tastebuds!  My picky husband actually said, "I'd pay for this at a nice restaurant."  High praise to be sure!

This was delicious. The only change I made was adding a can of artichoke hearts to the dish when I added the tomatoes (which had roasted garlic in them). The chicken was done before the sauce reached a consistency I liked, so I took them out and cooked the sauce alone maybe another 10 minutes. The vinegar taste is strong, but I happen to like balsamic vinegar. If you aren't sure if you like this, I would say to cut back on the vinegar the first time you make this just to be safe. I served this with bulgar wheat and it was a perfect compliment to the tasty sauce.

Could this be any easier?!!  The dish is spectacular.  It's perfect for those busy weeknights - so simple and bursting with flavor.  Served up with some steamed veggies (especially asparagus!)or mashed potatoes, this meal is near unbeatable - a must try!!  To switch it up try adding a splash of soy sauce and slicing up some green peppers with the onions.  Also, fresh garlic is soooo much better!

I tried this recipe because I love balsamic vinegar and was looking for a good chicken dish. This was really nice with the right amount of tanginess that wasn't overpowering. Although, I think I'll take the advice of others next time and add a little minced garlic to the onions. I really like the tomato sauce it makes and the spices complemented each other nicely. To me, it was even better the second day.

Really liked this.  Picky hubby also liked. I added fresh minced garlic and reduced the vinegar to 1/4 cup.  Served with fettucini and salad.  Quite nice.

I have not used balsamic vinegar before and this made a really zippy chicken dish that my husband I both enjoyed.  It's kind of ugly, but tasty.  I served with rice but I think next time I'll just serve it with french bread to soak up the juices.

I made this  tonight, according to directions.  Served it with rice pilaf, steamed zucchini and a tossed salad. It was a hit. My husband and 8 yr old picky eater LOVED it!  And so very easy to make. It will be a keeper.

Mmmmmm! This is a wonderful alternative to every day chicken recipes.  The sauce was very flavorful without being overpowering.  My husband, kids (ages 9 - toddler) all LOVED it.  I'm thinking of trying it on pork chops, as well.

Okay recipe.  The flavor wasn't to bad.  I like balsamic vinegar but this was a little strong for my taste.  Next time I will cut down on the balsamic and add a little stock to simmer with.  Good combination of all the other flavors, neither one over powered the other.  I really like cheese so I tried some parm on it after taking a few bites.  Not a good combo either.  I guess the balsamic and the parm a both to bitter to get along.

Both my husband and I thought this recipe was delicious.  I used chicken tenderloins instead of chicken breasts.  I might cut back on the rosemary next time as it was a bit twiggy and will probably serve it with rice.

This was delicious!! My family has some food allergies, so I substituted a few cloves of crushed garlic for the onion, and artichoke hearts + chicken broth instead of tomatoes. Added a side of pasta, and it was wonderful!! Will definitely make again.

This recipe was soooo easy to make and the result was a nice tangy tasting chicken.  A nice alternative the rather dull fried or baked chicken.

I add leftover vegetables like broccoli or green beans to the recipe.  I also like to put in black olives and artichokes for a mediterranean flavor.  It is one of my favorite quick meals.

This recipe was really easy and really yummy!  It was even better as leftovers...we chopped up the remaining chicken and put it in a big salad.  I liked it better that way!  I'll certainly make this again.

I loved it!  My boyfriend who doesn't even like tomatoes and is so picky, even loved it.  He said we could have this any time.  I think the only thing I would change would be to delete the rosemary out of the recipe.  This is a definate keeper!

Love this recipe.  Have made it several times.  I make one addition.  Once everything is cooked, I take a small pack of fresh spinach and wilt it into the sauce.  Fantastic.  I actually haven't ever served this over pasta.  I've thickened the sauce just a bit and eat it as is.

Excellent recipe, and really tasty. Added cremeni mushrooms, and highly recommend using fresh herbs rather than dry. Just adds that much more flavor when cooked down.

Yum!! I made everything as per the recipe but did have to brown my chicken in batches as my skillet wasn’t big enough. I served this with couscous and roasted Brussels sprouts. All my kids (under 6) loved it! It does have a balsamic tang if that’s not your thing. We enjoyed!

Made this the other night for the 2 of us.... it was great.  The only things I had changed, was dicing fresh tomatoes (didnt want to open a large can of them fo so little) and adding a heavy ½ teaspoon of sugar to the sauce.  Was told to save recipe.

I made the recipe per instructions, but doubled the servings.  The recipe was tasty and most importantly my kids also liked it.  We served this with rice and a side of vegetables.

This was an easy recipe to make and it was pretty good! My feedback on the recipe is it was light on seasoning which is easily fixable. I also added some mushrooms which gave it a nice earthiness and would do that again.

Delicious and easy. I added fresh herbs, artichokes, and red pepper flakes.  I also used crushed San Marcos tomatoes because I was out of chopped.

I just made this. It is a very tasty, tangy ,new way for me to enjoy chicken. It was simple and quick to make. I am really enjoying it, and will make it again.
I am new here and looking to eat healthy, and d loose weight. This fit the bill.
An added plus this site has is the  automatic adjustment to the ingredients to adapt to the servings I planned. It takes out the guesswork  or calculating. It is very helpful.

So easy and very flavorful. As others have done, I combined all the herbs with the tomatoes and balsamic.  I added extra chicken broth, which I should NOT have done -- too much liquid. I also browned the chicken first, then took them out, and browned the onions. While onions were browning, I cut the chicken into fork-sized pieces -- I was taking to a potluck. This recipe is pretty forgiving. I will make again.

As written it wasn't very flavorful.  Next time I may add a slice of mozzarella and make a balsamic reduction sauce by adding brown sugar and a bit of butter.

This recipe is outstanding! Very delicious and easy to prepare. Served mine with homemade mashed potatoes and steamed brussel sprouts. The only thing I did different was cut the chicken breasts into smaller strips so they absorb more flavor. Adding this to our house favorites list.

Good over all. I agree with other reviewers that there was a bit too much vinegar. I cut in half. And I added a bit of honey. And (as I am French) a bit of white wine (Gewurztraminer).

I really enjoyed this. Ate over egg noodles. Only change was that I used minced garlic and fresh tomatoes. Next time I will add more garlic and onion but I just really love onion and garlic. Fresh basil would really make this extra amazing too.

This was fantastic. Used chicken thighs, doubled the sauce and seasonings, and followed the other reviews and used half the vinegar and the other half stock. I served it with Parmesan risotto. Even the kids liked it, so a big hit.

I've made this as written before and those who didn't like it were right.  It's very easy to make and ok, but it is flawed.  After reading some of the comments, I fixed it last night.  Below are the required changes to ingredients, preparation, and technique.  Not quite as easy to make, but mostly adding small details which makes all the difference.

To the recipe, add about 2 cups of sliced mushrooms,  2 – 4 cloves of garlic (minced), ½ cup of white wine, 1 cup of chicken stock.  Also, use fresh rosemary (chopped) instead of dry and triple the amount.  (the dry rosemary ends up leaving an unpleasant texture of little wooden sticks in the finished dish).  (Afterthought:  Adding a good handful of golden raisins  to the cooking liquid while reducing might add a nice sweet accent to it.  I'm going to try it next time.)

You may want to reduce the amount of vinegar to 1/4 - 1/3 of a cup instead of 1/2.  Some found that much vinegar too tart and they have a point.  It’s up to you.  I made mine with 1/3 of a cup.  The added wine and stock help to cut the sourness as well.

New Procedure

1)  Liberally season both sides of chicken breasts with kosher salt, pepper, and garlic powder (do not use garlic salt)  Set aside in refrigerator for at least 2 – 3 hours.

2)  Combine the can of diced tomato, balsamic vinegar, white wine, chicken stock, and all dried/fresh herbs in a small bowl and set aside.  (Add a couple of teaspoons of kosher salt if you use unsalted chicken stock, which I su

I made this for a dinner party and it was a great hit; was asked for the recipe. The only changes I made were (per other reviewers)  the addition of mushrooms and kalamata olives, cubing the chicken (breasts were HUGE), and mixing fresh herbs in tomato/ balsamic mix as it was much easier that way. Will definitely serve again.

Made as directed.  Next time, I'd mix the spices into the tomatoes and vinegar before adding to the pan.  Would just be easier to mix.   I gave my kids just the chicken.  My husband and I used all of the sauce on the chicken and rice.  Picky teens liked it and we loved it.

This was a nice change of pace for us.  I purchased a very large bottle of good balsamic vinegar from Costco and have been trying new recipes that include it and this one didn't disappoint.  I was nervous about using the whole 1/2 cup so ended up using more like 1/3 cup. I also used fresh garlic. I served the chicken over noodles but since I was waiting for hubby to get home it cooked a long time and there really wasn't any "sauce" to put on the noodles just mushed up tomatoes and onions that had great flavor.  Might be better served with crusty bread and veggies verses noodles or rice and veggies.

I made this tonight following the recipe fairly closely but did leave the garlic salt out, adding 1/2 t. flavor salt., and added a small clove of minced garlic.  I also reduced the basil, thyme, oregano, and rosemary to 1/2 of what the recipe called for.  When I make it again, I'll stick to the revised measurement because it was perfect, and I will definitely be making it again.

Took the suggestion of another reviewer and replaced half the balsamic vinegar with chicken broth. Followed the rest of the instructions exactly. Was quick and easy to make and turned out great. Thanks.

A delicious and simple chicken recipe. The only changes I made were using fresh minced garlic instead of garlic salt and fresh rosemary (only because I already had some in the fridge) and threw everything in the crockpot and cooked on low for about 6 hours.

The only thing I think would make this dish better is to use chicken thighs over breasts.

For a bit of spice and lots of flavor, purchase the canned, fire roasted tomatoes with green chilies. It add some good heat to this tasty dish. I also suggest making a side of quinoa and serving the chicken right on top!

I think the balsamic vinegar was a bit too much. I also used fresh herbs instead of dry ones which gave it great flavor. I wasn’t really impressed but if I decide to make it again, I’ll cut back on the balsamic vinegar.

I served this over egg noodles. I liked it but think it needs something to balance the acidity— maybe a bit of sugar?

The flavor of this dish was amazing. Slightly tart and slightly sweet and packed with flavor. Next time however I will be making the following changes to take it to the next level. First, I will be cubing my chicken like others suggested. I followed the instructions exactly and it was difficult to properly brown the onions  and mix all the flavors with these big pieces of chicken in the way. If you're going to stick to the original instructions and to the keep the chicken breast whole, I suggest mixing the tomatoes, spices, and vinaigrette in a separate bowl before placing in the pan over the chicken. Next, I will be cutting down the cook time in half. I cooked my chicken following the directions, and I ended up with really dry chicken. And last, I'll be serving this over a bed of angel hair pasta, or some mashed potatoes. Depending on the mood I'm in. P.S. choose a really good vinaigrette!! Great job to the original poster for an awesome, easy, and low cal recipe!

I was looking for something to make that would make everyone happy.  This was it.  This chicken was so flavorful.  The sauce was great over quinoa.  It is definitely a keeper.  Loved it, and really easy to make.

Loved it! Added a can of mushrooms and some black olives. The most important thing is it's quick and easy to make, and my husband loves it! I've made this recipe sooo many times and change it up just a bit each time, but, the original recipe here is perfect too!!!

No changes! Simply dee - licious! If you want  a quick, simple ingredients recipe that explodes with the taste of Italy! This is it! I paired it with angel hair pasta and a simple romaine salad and  don't forget the fresh grated parm! You might think that there wont be enough sauce for six but there is! the sauce is sooo flavorful  a little goes a long way!

Loved the chicken recipe and it goes well with either rice or potatoes. Easy to prepare and cooking is very short. Will experiment with other vegetables in the future.

I used a tablespoon of butter with olive oil while sautéing the onions then added sliced button mushrooms to the pan when onions were almost done. Mixed in the rest of the ingredients and had that finished ahead of time. Chicken was cooking in the instant pot sous vide style which I had added garlic salt, pepper and a bit of paprika too. When it was time for dinner we popped the chicken on the grill for appearance and searved with sauce over the top. Very good and I’m sure it’s good as written too I just like the idea of adding mushrooms and making ahead without drying out the chicken.

I really liked it.  You could use any seasoning blend you wanted. I added a bit of sour cream at the end bc I felt like it. It was tasty without the sour cream too, though, don't get me wrong. I could NOT fit 6 boneless skinless chx br halves in a 12 inch skillet and I don't think anyone really could honestly. I fit 4 without too much crowding. Thighs yes, breasts no. Thanks for the recipe, the chicken was tender and enjoyable!

Made this exactly as written, except used chicken thighs since that was all I had.  It was very good, very easy, and pretty quick to make. I'll definitely make it again. My picky husband had seconds, and THAT is rare!

I made this in a crock pot with 2/3 the balsamic called for. It was delicious. I would increase balsamic to full amount next time. The crock pot brings out lots of juice!

Very good.  Mixed a lot of reviews and made it with 1/2 of the balsamic vinegar (good quality - important), added 1 tsp of brown sugar, mushrooms and replaced the garlic salt with minced fresh garlic.  Smelled the vinegar, but didn't taste it.  Was very good and will make again.

Very easy to make with ingredients already on hand! I made this exactly as written, using the full amount of Balsamic Vinegar. The flavor was FABULOUS!! Also, lower in calories than many similar dishes. I served it with couscous to soak up all the delicious sauce. Everyone at my dinner table raved about it.

I really liked it, but would definitely not add the rosemary next time, as I’m not the big of a fan of it. However, my boyfriend really liked it! Would be making again.

Wow this was awesome. I watered down the vinegar with a little bit of veggie stock (that's what I had on hand) since I knew the vinegar as called for would be too much for me and it was amazing.

Delicious and SO easy. As others recommended, I added mushrooms and minced garlic to the braising liquid (which I simmered after removing the chicken to create a thick, stew-like sauce of diced tomatoes, onions and mushrooms). Served over mashed cauliflower. For me, the best part of this meal was the sauce. WOW. 10/10 would make again (as long as you REALLY like balsamic).

I thought this chicken was fabulous. Flavorful and juicy! I seasoned the chicken with Adobo with pepper and added fresh minced garlic with the onion. I did use the whole amount of balsamic (I love it), but I added about a half cup of  vegetable broth that I had in the fridge and let it simmer until reduced. Oh my was that sauce good!

This was, overall, pretty fantastic. Super easy to make! My family loves balsamic and we use it in a LOT of recipes, so when I chose this, I knew what to expect. Another reviewer pointed out that 15 minutes is really not nearly long enough for a true braise, and I agree, hence the reason for 4/5 stars. 

I had boneless, skinless chicken thighs, so that's what I used. I halved the *entire* recipe because I was only cooking for two and had enough on hand for that and a single day's leftovers. Other than the protein (and I'm not sure I'd do this with breasts, but maybe with pork chops), I made this mostly as written. My minor changes were to season the breasts with salt and pepper and Italian seasoning before browning, I used fresh minced garlic, I added a splash of sherry in the balsamic, and I let it braise for at least 30 minutes (I didn't set a timer, but it was more than 30, less than 45). That let the vinegar *tang* mellow as it cooked and I ended up with a deep, rich sauce that was fantastic on the chicken. 

Next time I will likely add the mushrooms several folks have suggested, but otherwise I like this recipe a lot and we'll definitely make it again. Might even adapt it for the crockpot.

I made this dish exactly as instructed after watching video and reading carefully. I am so disappointed!  First, the definition of "braising"  (from Food Network) on anywhere else, is low and slow.  Not 15 minutes.  if you want it tender, it takes TIME.  The sauce was good (reminded me of the Liver & Onions my mom used to make).  BUT the chicken was as hard as a rock.  If the chicken breasts were slice thinly, this would probably be good, but you still need to simmer for 35-45 minutes and make sure you have enough liquid in your pan,.

The only change I made was to use four Bone-in Chicken Thighs  and omit the Thyme (didn't have it).  I paired it with mashed potatoes and broccoli.  Very tasty and easy to prepare.  Its a keeper.

This dish was amazing. Made it for a dinner party and everyone just loved it. 
I used kosher salt and dry brined the breasts for several hours, brought them to room temperature before putting them in the skillet. While frying the chicken, I had the tomatoes (28 oz can San Marzano), 1/2 c balsamic vinegar,  fresh oregano and basil and tablespoon of brown sugar simmering Added sliced mushrooms and onions to the skillet and caramelized and then added the sauce and continued simmering for another 15 minutes. Served over rice with buttered asparagus .  Amazing!
Will definitely be making again and again.

I made it, as written, and it came out pretty good. It was easy and the family seemed to enjoy it. I served it with bowtie pasta. If I were to make it again I would cut the amount of balsamic vinegar by about half. I felt that it came out a little too sweet with the amount the recipe called for.  Otherwise a solid recipe that I will make again.

It was yummy and the only problem was really on me.  I should have probably seared the chicken longer to start with because it ended up being slightly dry.  I'll have to be more careful next time.  But over all, made this as part of Christmas dinner, it was a hit.  A good healthy alternative to add to the holiday feast.

Instead of a can of diced tomatoes, I used fresh cherry tomatoes.  I think it added a little more sweetness to the dish.  Next time I would not use as many dried herbs...the taste was too strong for me.  My boyfriend loved this, though.

This  was great! Hubby loved it! I followed another reviewer's advice of mixing the balsamic, tomatoes and spices together and then adding to the pan.  I also used fresh garlic.  I agree that a good quality balsamic is really important to this dish. It makes the difference between a sweetness vs a tart or tangy dish. I highly recommend this one. Thanks!

Very flavorful and can be modified to add extra vegetables to the sauce and served with basically any side.

This recipe was really  good!  I used boneless skinless thighs instead of breasts and it was good.  I used the canned tomatoes with basil, oregano and garlic adding some thyme and extra basil.  I served it over rice and it was wonderful

Absolutely delicious!! I made it 3x now, and this last time I accidentally used more chicken than i meant to, i used 6 split chicken breasts over three pans but it came out incredible! Chicken was so juicy and soft and the onions and tomatoes were amazing too! My boyfriend and son hate veggies, but they both ate the onions and tomatoes with this dish! I served it with a side of cajun style french green beans that my family makes. Highly reccomend this recipe! 

Another great thing about this is the affordability! Once you buy the ingredients 1x, you only have to buy the chicken, onion and canned tomatoes to make it again.

I followed the recipe altering all breast meat with breast and thigh.  I also used Italian seasoning vs the individual seasoning cause thats what I had in the pantry.
the 13 year old Michelin Star critic loved it!.  Wife enjoyed the breast meat and I ate both breast and thigh.  All came out good.
Its a healthy recipe which can to served for larger gatherings.

I changed it a lot so will create new recipe and use this as the base.  I diced the chicken into bite-sized pieces.  Followed the recipe except I added artichoke hearts and a cup of tomato sauce.  Cooked Rotini and mixed that in and served as a casserole.  SOO GOOD!

We both loved it!!  It's easy and quick to make.  Based on other reviews, I used 1/4 c. balsamic vinegar and added 1/4 c. white wine to make 1/2 c. liquid.  This will be a repeat!

This was AMAZING! My only change was to increase the basil and oregano since my husband loves those flavors. Everything else was just as written. Really fabulous. We ate leftovers for the next two days and even the last of it was just as delicious, tender and juicy as the first serving. Super easy, too. This will absolutely go into our frequent rotation.

By cooking the chicken until done or almost done, then slicing it and letting it swim in the delicious sauce with the tomatoes,  basalmic, and onion, for just awhile longer until heated completely through - that will make this recipe a 5 star winner!

I liked it, definitely mix balsamic, tomatoes and spices together before adding to avoid clumping. Use high quality balsamic vinegar.  I also lidded it while simmering. It was a hit even with the kids.

This is a "go to" recipe in our house. So easy and delicious and I typically have all ingredients on hand. Getting a good balsamic is key.  Toss the extra sauce with a little pasta. This recipe is a winner!

My family was split down the middle with half disliking the dish, and half finding it “okay”.  I followed the recipe, but found the chicken dry, and the sauce definitely too strong with vinegar flavor for kids.

This chicken was amazing! Very moist and flavorful. I did not follow exact measurements, and I cooked the chicken for a little longer than suggested as well. My family and I loved this dish, and I will make it again!

Great quick dinner recipe. I made this recipe as is and loved it! I have made it a few times and i prefer to serve this with mashed potatoes instead of rice.

I love balsamic vinegar.  followed recipe except grilled the chicken.  I sauteed the onions with mushrooms in butter and olive oil.  Added can tomatoes and balsamic mixture.  then added grilled chicken to that and warmed it up.  served over penne pasta.   Family loved it.

This dish was phenomenal! Easy to make, and very few ingredients. I tempered the bite from the balsamic vinegar with a few tablespoons of honey, and it worked perfectly! I poured the remaining vegetable and vinegar mixture over egg noodles to serve with the chicken, and it was a match made in heaven :-)

Great recipe. The balsamic flavor is really strong, and the onions and diced tomatoes pair well with it. Ten out of ten would recommend this dish- it's easy to make, and the results are delicious

Delicious and easy.  I agree with the others who reduced the balsamic vinegar.  I used about 1/4 cup or less on the second try.  The 1/2 was a bit too much for my taste.  I plan to try this in the crock pot next time.

I wasn’t sure about this.. But surprisingly it turned out great! I hate tomatoes, so I left them out.  Otherwise, I kept the recipe exactly as is.  I took the pan drippings, (onions and herbs) and mixed them into the brown rice. Excellent!

Love it. I needed to reduce the amount of balsamic vinegar because I have two young children. Also added some chicken seasoning. I really enjoyed it and will be making it again. I omitted onions and added mushrooms. Yummy. I'll probably try adding artichokes or asparagus next time

Outstanding taste, and very easy to make. I used the stated amount of a medium-priced balsamic vinegar, but reduced the other spices by about one-third. The harshness of the vinegar cooked out to a nice tang during braising. I’ll make this again, and soon.

This is a great dish packed with lots of flavor. The stewed tomatoes end up enhancing the dish. I’ve made similar dishes but I can say this one is the best take on this.

I loved this recipe! I had to change a few things, but overall it was the same dish. I cut everything by 1/3 (for 2 people). Instead of wasting a whole can of tomatoes, I used 1 medium chopped Roma tomato. Also, I added mushrooms, sliced portabellas to sauté with the onions. It turned out great! I think one thing that makes a HUGE difference in this dish is the quality of balsamic vinegar used, I used a high quality imported version. It has a less acidic, tart taste, and is slightly sweet.

We are on a low sodium diet so instead of garlic salt I used garlic powder and it was really good. 
We will have this one again.

I think next time I'll tone down the balsamic a bit as it was a bit over powering but otherwise this was a tasty dish.  Also, I didn't cook the onions enough so they were crunchy but that's my fault not a fault of the recipe.  Finally, I think adding some fresh mushrooms might jazz up the recipe a bit.  Overall, a good recipe that we'll try again with the above changes.  Thanks for sharing!

Pretty good! Followed the recipe pretty precisely. Since chicken breast are so large, I cut three large chicken breasts in half and the portions of sauce worked out well.

Absolutely one of my favorites!  Have made repeatedly...  only change is that I reduce the amount of onion.  Just a personal preference though... not a big onion fan, so a little goes a long way for us!

This is fabulous tasting but I changed the cooking method..  Saute the onions and fresh garlic in the olive oil till just soft. Add the dry spices and stir until fragrant.  Add the rest of the ingredients and simmer for 5 minutes.  Pour on the chicken and bake for 20.  So good!  I am making it again tonight and cooking it over chicken tenders.  As stated be sure to use a good balsamic!

I used balsamic vinegar GLAZE which is much sweeter than regular balsamic vinegar. Next time I will omit the Thyme - too overpowering. I suggest using the glaze if you are worried about it being too acidic. This was a great dish.

I love Balsamic Vinegar. This was a great dish. I used real tomatoes instead of crushed in a can. Also, I added Dijon mustard and Lemon juice.  I can’t get enough of this dish. My Step Son who is a very picky eater, wants me to make it every time he come over.

It turned out really well.  However, I was running low on balsamic vinegar and had between 1/4 and 1/2 (closer to 1/4) cup on hand and it called for 1/2 cup.  I just used what I had and we all agreed that if I'd put the whole 1/2 cup in, it would probably have been too much.

It was so good and easy. I added more tomatoes and balsamic to make it saucier. One of my new favorites.

Very good!  To be on the safe side I cut the balsamic with chicken broth as someone suggested because I wasn't sure how my family would like the balsamic flavor.  That was a good call.  Next time I will add some slivered fresh garlic to give it punch.  Goes great with angel hair pasta and green beans.

I make this all the time and I found if you mix 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar and 1/4 cup balsamic reduction instead it balances the fanciness with a little sweetness, my family loves it! and I serve over white rice.

One of my favourite dishes ever. I switched to fresh garlic instead of garlic salt, and cubed the chicken. So, delicious! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Used chicken thighs and added calamata olives. I happened to have fresh rosemary and thyme. Also added fresh basil on hand.  Spirilized butternut squash as a side.  A hit with husband and adult son!

I’m not sure why all the 5 star reviews. While this recipe was simple and quick, the flavors were also simple.  It simply tastes like vinegar flavored chicken. You would be better served to simply marinate chicken in Italian dressing then sauté.

It looked gorgeous but the flavour was too harsh and not especially interesting.  I tried this because normally I love balsamic. I didn’t feel that it went well with rice or pasta, either.  We were able to eat it but I won’t make it again.

Will definitely make this recipe again.  I used fresh tomatoes instead of  canned ones, reduced the second portion of spices a little bit as well and added a couple of Tbsp of water to juice it up and I finished it off by adding a small green bell pepper and a couple of mushrooms.

Amazing! I absolutely loved it. 

I didn't have any balsamic vinegar, instead I used 1/2cup red wine vinegar mixed with a tablespoon of fancy molasses. I also added some red pepper flakes to season the chicken, but that because I enjoy the spice.

I made this tonight and my husband and I loved it. I read a few reviews and made a couple of changes. I used half the vinegar and couldn’t find any chicken broth so used a part of a pk of onion soup mix and water, I also added fresh mushrooms and used fresh diced tomatoes.  Will definitely be making this again.

Loved it!  Just added sliced red pepper and zucchini with onions because I had to get rid of them!  No one knew zucchini was in there. ;D  didn't have fresh herbs so, I used Italian seasoning mix. This is so versatile, thank you!!

I made this recipe for 2 people. Used 2 chicken breasts, cut in half. I cut the seasonings in half and used only 3 tablespoons of good balsamic vinegar. Used the full can of diced tomatoes and 1 medium onion. Also added a small can of mushrooms. 
Sauté the onion and mushrooms, adding 1 tsp of brown sugar and 1 Tbls.  of butter. When the onions are softened and beginning to brown, add all seasonings and 1 tsp minced garlic.  Remove the cooked veggies from the pan into a small bowl. Add a bit more oil and brown the chicken 4 minutes per side. Remove the chicken. Put the veggies back in the pan and add the cam of diced tomatoes. Mix thoroughly and nestle the chicken in the pan. Simmer, covered until the chicken reaches 165F. Serve over rice.

I loved this!  It may be too tangy for some but I love (a good) vinegar! Will definitely make again. It's healthy and very satisfying. I was concerned because I only had canned tomatoes w/green chiles. Wasn't an issue.

I am really surprised by all of the positive reviews on this recipe.  I love balsamic, tomatoes, onions and chicken and really looked forward to making this recipe given all of the high marks but the flavor of vinegar was incredibly overwhelming,  Not a fan at all...

It was pretty good. My kids ate it with rice and they are fairly picky. I added a few cherry tomatoes to the canned tomatoes and a couple mushrooms (because, come on, mushrooms!)
I bought the fancy B.V. and did a 75% balsamic/25% chicken broth mix because I was worried that the kids might find it too strong. It's still pretty strong even diluted. Next time I would slice the chicken after searing it to get more flavor into the breasts and a more tender braise.

This was okay but maybe that's because I used a cheap balsamic vinegar from Walmart, that was more tangy than sweet, as other reviewers have said a good balsamic is very sweet. So based on other's suggestions I used only half the vinegar and replaced the other half with a beef (not chicken) broth, and also added brown sugar at the end. I used whole garlic cloves minced instead of the garlic salt. We ate this over spaghetti. I felt this was lacking flavor. We added more pepper and also lots of parmesan cheese which improved the taste. I probably wouldn't try this again unless I buy a better balsamic vinegar.

I like this recipe a lot. My husband ended up cooking it, and he said it was pretty easy to make. The chicken had a lot of flavor. We paired it with Balsamic Mushrooms. It would also pair well with orzo.

Great recipe! Add some buttered bread on the side as well. One thing is you really don't need a 1/2 cup of the balsamic vinegar. 1/4 cup is more than enough. Save the rest for next time!

Good recipe for something a little different, but easy.  I added sliced fresh mushrooms a little after the onions.  I halved the recipe for 3 adults and still had leftovers, which made a great lunch the next day.  I served with rotini and green beans.
It's pretty much the same as the wine-braised brisket I make, so I think you could substitute red wine  for the balsamic vinegar if you wanted t o.

Loved it.  Really easy to make.  We had it with couscous.  Definitely a keeper.  My suggestion is to use a high end sweet balsamic vinaigrette.

I typically do not modify first time recipes, but I only had 3 very large chicken breasts. I added 8 oz's of fresh mushrooms and a package of frozen spinach. I didn't crush the rosemary enough; I love the flavor but not the little sticks :) Next time I will crush them better. I used granulated garlic instead of the garlic salt to make the dish with less sodium. I don't feel the addition of these items changed the flavor much, just added more substance. Will put over brown rice next time.

This dish was easy to make and it made the chicken very moist and flavorful, but the rest was not that great. If it was a little bit sweeter, we might have liked it better. If I were to make it again, I would either put in less vinegar (and add some chicken broth) or add a little bit of sugar to it, and I would definitely use fresh garlic plus salt instead of garlic salt. Also, I might prefer it over pasta. We put it over rice and it didn't particularly mesh well.

Definitely will be making this again & again. I did make a few changes based on other reviews. (1) for the 1/2 cup of Balsamic Vinegar I split in 2 & used 1/2 chicken broth (2) I added 3 cloves of minced garlic. That's it! Everything else is the same & boy was it it delicious!

Love love love this and so does my picky daughter.  I use about triple the onions, two cans of diced tomatoes, and a very heavy pour of balsamic vinegar to have much more of the topping to serve with brown rice.  I simmer about double the time and sometimes break the chicken up.  I like to finish/top with a balsamic blaze drizzle.

The vinegar was a little strong, especially when it was cooking, but it gave the chicken a kick that didn't make it taste like "diet food". I'll add this to my archives. THANK you to the original cook!

Bursting with flavor but quick and easy! I did cut a bit of the balsamic with chicken broth because my employers aren't crazy about vinegar overload. I also threw in some sliced mushrooms - yum! Perfect over rice with garlic green beans on the side.

I made this tonight. It was fairly quick and easy.  I chopped my onion and some cloves of garlic in a food processor.  Seasoned and browned my chicken in olive oil, added onion/garlic and sweat them, then added can of tomatoes, a little water (2 Tbsp, to get sauce out of can) and GOOD balsamic vinegar. I think this is key, as a poorer quality would likely lead to a more acidic tasting dish.  I truly braised it (in a closed container) on my stovetop for about 30 minutes.  The boneless chicken breasts cooked perfectly in that ime. I turned over the chicken half-way through.  When nearing the end, I left the lid off and allowed it to simmer to try to cook down the liquid.  In the end, it was savory, slightly acidic and somewhat carmelized--adding a nice touch of sweetness to the dish.  Served it over steamed rice with a side of sauteed green beans.  Will definitely make this again.

I loved it.   Definitely will add this to my meal rotation.   I used skinless boneless chicken thighs.

I used Kraft Balsamic dressing instead of vinegar and halved it with the remainder being chicken stock. It was excellent and I will most definitely make it again!

This was a really easy recipe, and very tasty. I did add a bit of water to cut down the tang of balsamic vinegar, and also make up the liquid from the tomatoes as I used fresh ones instead of canned. I served it over spaghetti noodles, and it was a very filling meal.

Followed recipe only change was fresh garlic instead of garlic salt and threw in a pint of grape tomatoes that needed to be eaten.  Delicious.  Hubby (who doesn't like tomatoes) gobbled it up!  Served with rice and broccoli.  Will be added to rotation!

This was delicious. Made it as directed and the only adjustment I will make for next time is to cut the chicken into bite sized pieces. Would be great served over rice!

Easy to make in not much time but absolutely delicious. The second time I made it I added 1/4 c. dark beer to liquid which made an already great sauce even richer. Try this recipe either way or add your own touches.

Yummy and easy - great dinner for a week night when you need a 1 pot dish to feed the family.  Paired it with the 90 second microwave rice pouch and green bean steam-able as sides and had dinner on the table in about 30 minutes!  I didn't use the rosemary because I'm not a fan but other than that I made it as written.

I made this recipe and followed it exactly, I used chicken stock instead of the balsamic vinegar. It turned out VERY tough and not that great. My husband ate it, but he eats anything.

I would give it six stars if that option existed.  Truly an inspired recipe and so easy to prepare.  I served it with brown rice and broccoli .  I can't wait to make it again.

Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

My husband is not a chicken fan, so I'm thrilled to have found a few chicken recipes he really likes. This is one of his favorites! 

I've made this 3 times now. I took the advice of reviewer Kristi L. and used frozen chicken in a slow cooker, and it's turned out fabulously each time.

This was easy and delicious. I added about a tsp of agave syrup as a sweetener to cut the acid of the balsamic a little. It turned out GREAT!!!

Wasn't very good.  Way too balsamic, not enough salt, very bland, no spices.  I would not recommend making this at all.  You would do better just putting salt, pepper and marinara

Due to sodium concerns, I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  To make it even easier I used canned diced tomatoes that were already seasoned with basil and oregano and didn't add any extra.  Result was very flavorful still!!

This was delicious! The chicken was tender and juicy! We LOVE balsamic vinegar in our house, so the flavor was perfect! I will make this again! (I didn't have rosemary or thyme on hand, so just left those out. and oddly didn't have canned tomatoes, so I just diced up some that I had frozen tomatoes from our garden and it was amazing!)

The dish was delicious. I added red wine, removed the chicken once cooked to allow it to simmer for longer without drying out the breast and used fresh tomatoes instead of canned.

I made no changes.  Yes I will make it again.   My side dish was rice, and the flavors blended well together.  The next time I will have pasta as my side dish.

Followed the helpful hint of cutting the balsamic in half. (It really would have been way too much using the full amount). Next time will add mushrooms.  And plan on slicing chicken into bite sized pieces.  I prefer not having to cut meat on my plate.

What I really liked about this dish was that it is a pretty healthy dish but has a lot of flavor. I only used 4 chicken breasts and 2 minced cloves of fresh garlic in the sauce instead of the garlic salt. Used all fresh herbs and cut back on the balsamic by using chicken broth (a 1/4 cup of each).

Love the ingredients so made this on a weeknight. Used a little bit of chicken broth to the vinegar and added portabellos and red peppers chopped at the sauté point.  Served with rice and veggies!  I used 3 chicken breasts and fillet them so they cooked evenly.  Served with Feta Cheese.

I added squash and crushed red pepper. The recipe has too much vinegar, I would only add 2 Tbs.  Overall it was good and easy.

Very Good. I didn't have garlic salt so added about 3/4 salt and 1/4 garlic powder to equal the measurement.  Also omitted the thyme as I didn't have any.  Quick easy and tasty served over rice

My entire family loved it! If you like balsamic vinegar, this recipe is for you. I added time to the browning the chicken step so it was extra golden brown. Also added parmesan and mozzarella cheese at the very end. Delicious!

Was a pretty quick simple recipe but way too much balsamic vinegar, the vinegar makes it very sharp.... would put 1/4 cup in and 2x cans chopped tomato. Also added mushrooms to the dish to bulk it up.

This was delicious and easy to make for a beginner cook. The only change I would make is starting to sauté the onions sooner than suggested if you're using thin chicken breasts, otherwise they may not have enough time to cook well by the time the chicken is done.

Loved it, yes it does have a strong balsamic flavor, but we love balsamic, I used fresh rosemary since that's all we had, and added a few handfuls of pasta to soak up the liquid, it was fantastic, and definite keeper!!!

This recipe is amazing, as you simmer the chicken it absorbs all the flavors and is so tender.  I make this with a rice side for my family and it is a regular in our house now.

The only thing I changed was not using the rosemary and simply because my family is not fond of it.

Great recipe and so easy to make.  I have and will continue to recommend it to everyone.

This is a great healthy recipes but with the tomatoes and vinegar, too much acidity takes over. I sprinkled some permagiano but a slice of mozzarella cheese might be a good addition to make the meal more balanced.

I made this recipe in an attempt to use ingredients I had in my pantry. I didn't have chicken breast thawed but I had cans of diced chicken. I prepared the recipe as it was written but used 2-12.5 oz cans of diced chicken instead of 6 chicken breast. I googled the proportions of diced chicken to chicken breast. It is 1 chicken breast is approx 4 oz. diced. I still seasoned them the same and browned them a little before the onion. All I had was Italian style diced tomatoes and still used the same spice amounts. I probably could've reduced the oregano, basil and thyme. It was kind of strong. Next time will get regular diced tomatoes. My family LOVED it! Even my autistic son who hates most things loved this... Major win for football Sunday meal. Served with jasmine rice and seasoned French style green beans.

The adult in the family thought the mushrooms on the side (in the pic) should have been layered on top. I did diced/chunks of chicken pan fried on the stove top and mixed all the ingredients in  as a one dish. VERY YUMMY.  The youngest of the family isn't a fan of tomatoes, but thought if it was tomato sauce (or maybe pureed) he would eat it all. Plan to make this again. :)

I used chicken thighs (boneless, skinless) as I prefer dark meat and also was out of plain balsamic  used raspberry instead.  I added artichokes as I love them and try to get more vegetables into my diet.  Loved  the recipe and it will be a staple in my recipe collection. Delicious!

Made some of the changes (half of balsamic and other half chicken stock and I added a variety of mushrooms.  .  Still it had a overpowering vinegar taste.  Need to cut back even more on balsamic.  It was ok but there's a lot of better chicken recipes out there.

I made this with boneless skinless chicken thighs. It was delicious. I served it with sautéed mushrooms, wax beans and brown rice. Also, it is low in fat.

Wonderful! Very tasty. Loved what the balsamic vinegar added to it---a certain sweetness. I did cut the amount of balsamic a bit, and it worked out fine. Used fresh herbs at 2-3 times the measurements for dried.cooking times were right on the mark. We are big fans of this recipe!

Super delish and healthy! I added mushrooms with the onions per another rater's advice,  used fresh heirloom tomatoes (6),  and added a tablespoon pat of butter at the end to make the sauce smooth and creamy ( I didn't have time to let the sauce reduce but I didn't mind at all ). I served it over quinoa with a side of easy sautéed spinach  and roasted cauliflower  ( both from this site).  next time, I'll try it in the slow cooker. This will definitely be added to the rotation.

Love the balsamic flavor.  Thin chicken breasts make it easier and less time consuming to cook.

I thought this was amazing!!!  I added green pepper (1)  chopped up.  also 1/4 cup  of vinegar  2 Tablespoons of brown sugar.  I made these changes just by tasting and adjusting to our taste.  Thanks for the recipe.  Nest time I will cut  up  the chicken  in about 1-2 inch pieces.  The whole breast altho came out delis. and moist  it's a lot for one person.

It's easy and tasty. I followed other reviewer and added chicken stock and fresh cherry tomatoes my 9 year old ate it with no problems. Cooked it with pasta and honey glazed carrots to make it kid friendly. Yummy

I made this with one large chicken breast cut in two (so I used 1/3 of everything else for the recipe). I also didn't have any canned tomatoes, so I diced up fresh ones. After the tomatoes and spices were in, I only simmered it for 8 minutes or so, and it turned out perfectly. I also covered it while it was simmering. I served it over fettuccine. Would definitely make again.

The recipe was coming out great until I added the 1/2 cup of Balsamic Vinegar. It was an overkill, its needs to be reduced to at least 1/4 cup, maybe less.

Made this for dinner, it was awesome!!!!  Can't have grains, so I added sliced mushrooms and zucchini to the pan after removing the chicken to rest. Flavor was  amazing. Will try over zucchini noodles next time, don't want to waste any of the sauce:-)

This was not what I expected at all.  The vinegar took over the whole dish.   Would not make again.

Very delicious! I had people over for dinner and I have never made dinner for a group before and all the food I usually cook is simple, so this was my first time! And it was a last minute choice cuz it was all short notice (the group coming over) so I went on allrecipes and saw this amazing looking recipe! This recipe was sooo easy to follow and was very very delicious and everyone loved it! I'd pair this with brown rice on the side and top the chicken with barbecue sauce. Mwah!! So good!

Easy and delicious. I followed advice of some others and did cut the balsamic with some brith. I also used  boneless chicken thighs as that is what I had defrosted. My kids are a little fussy so I took about half of the liquid and puréed it. They always push the tomatoes aside and this helps. No one complained snd that makes this a 5 star in my house!

This was so easy and really turned out great!  I used a Lite Balsamic salad dressing and McCormick Italian Blend seasoning (I think it's everything but the rosemary already combined).  Then I also used a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes and I think the flavor turned out great!

I loved this!  What a great flavor!  I made it for my husband and me so I only cooked 2 chicken breasts.  I sliced the breasts in half lengthwise.  I used the whole can of diced tomatoes and 1/4 cup of the balsamic vinegar.  I also added sliced mushrooms and minced garlic.  I don't care for thyme and rosemary so I left them out.  So good!  I will definitely make this again.

Not a huge fan of chicken in general, but the flavor of the sauce was great! May try the sauce (tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, onions, seasoning) over pasta sometime.

Amazing! Very flavorful! I cut the oil in half and added 3 cloves of garlic while cooking the onion. I ran out of balsamic vinegar, so I only used about 3 oz instead of 4. I used 2.3lbs of chicken, but the chicken breasts were huge, so I cut them in half. When I plugged the recipe into my calorie counter, it ended up being only 134 calories per 5 ounce serving!!! This is going to be a frequent meal in our house from now on!

I really really enjoyed this.  I agree it depends on how good your balsamic is.  Mine was phenomenal.  I have one of those specialty oil and vinegar stores near, and I used a thicker white balsamic, more of a reduction.  So I only used 1/4 cup.  But the sweeter white balsamic reduction made this just amazing.  I didn't add any thyme, but I hate thyme, and the other seasonings were more than enough.  I will make this time and time again I'm sure.

Loved with minor changes. I added a cup of chicken broth to cut the basalmic vinager and used fresh mushrooms.
 I always get the thin cut chicken breasts and there were only 5 pieces in the pack but that was enough. By using thin cut chicken it stays moist!

I followed the recipe with the exception of I used a homemade flavored oil to saute the chicken and the tomatoes I used were flavored with oregano, rosemary, and basil. I didn't have any plan diced tomatoes on hand. I was searching for an easy and healthy recipe when I came  across this and I am very happy I went with this. It was super flavorful and I will make this often.

Yummy, easy and quick.  I accidentally picked up crushed peeled tomatoes instead of diced.  Still worked out great. Figured that I'd get creative and throw in some sun dried tomatoes.  Don't think that made any difference, could have done without.  Don't waste your time adding anything else.  It has  more than enough flavor as is.  The balsamic is VERY dominant.  I love balsamic but even still,  I think next time I'll go with a  1/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup.  Skipped serving it with a carb but would have been great with pappardelle, polenta or even mashed potatoes.  Don't think I'd serve it with rice. Did serve with with garlic roasted broccoli (can find recipes on this site). Yum.

First time making this dish one thing I removed chicken to make a reduction in sauce also I think the next time I will add a little chicken broth. With that being said I would say this recipe is quick easy and family loved it.

This was very tasty!  I only had 4 chicken breasts instead of 6 so I cut all the ingredients in half and there was plenty of sauce. I also added cornstarch (mixed with water first) at the end to thicken the sauce a bit as it was quite runny.

Think the chicken lacks a little flavor on its own but love with the sauce; will double it next time.  I used only half the balsamic as some other reviewers did, as well as a bit less of the herbs.  I sautéed the onion and some fresh garlic in the skillet first, then removed before browning the chicken.  After browning I put the onion mixture back in along with the sauce ingredients which I combined ahead of time.  All six of us liked it, including a very picky grandson!

Very tasty. Would recommend using good balsamic vinegar and halving the amount of vinegar.  Also use chicken thighs instead of breasts which made it even more moist.

Actually would rate this about 3.75/5. It was good and worth making again for an alternative basic chicken breast recipe. Bright flavor palette with the balsamic vinegar but served with rice and broccoli was quite good. Simple to make.

I made this for my wife last night and she loved it, I skipped the rosemary and thyme (I personally don't like them) but followed the rest and it turned out well, juicy well flavored chicken. My wife thought it needed something so I drizzled a balsamic vinegar reduction over the chicken and it added a great finish to the dish.  

Thanks for sharing!

I used 2 chicken breasts and 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, 1 can of tomato sauce, along with the suggested spices. (I used fresh garlic).  I added mushrooms because we like them. We didn't have a whole lot of sauce leftover. I served it over angel hair pasta.

I made this recipe just as it was written. It was delicious. I also made it with chicken thighs as my one daughter prefers them. 
I will definitely be making this again.

Delicious & easy! I made it as directed and it was a bit much with the balsamic but still good nonetheless. Next time, I will try the chicken broth and balsamic mix another user suggested. I also love the idea of putting this in a crock pot. Great dish!!!

I made this for my husband, mother and I and we all highly enjoyed it. I served it over rice and added diced garlic when I cooked the onions. I didn't have diced tomatoes so I used stewed instead. We all liked the stewed that I will continue to use them however, I will do TWO 14.5oz cans next time because we like tomatoes and one can was not enough.  It was a fast and simple recipe and will become a staple. I have a recipe similar to this that you basically put it all into the crock pot and cook on low so the chicken doesn't dry out. I really didn't think this took too much more time then that but if you all want to do it that way, I can say its tasty. Just don't use all the oil in this recipe in the crock pot.

Delicious! Made exactly as written. Chicken was tender and sauce was perfect. I did let the chicken cook for a little longer than 15 minutes (~18 minutes or so) to let a little more of the sauce reduce.

Excellent dish, tangy yet creamy, tart yet smooth. Made a few modifications, only had 3 breasts, added a red pepper , tbls butter,  a clove of garlic, and replaced the balsalmic with red wine vinegar. Served on white rice. Will definitely make it again!

Delicious!!!! I have extremely picky eaters and they loved it.  I did add a little bit of brown sugar as another reviewer suggested. It was a great suggestion. I also added 1/2 cup of dry cooking wine. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

It was really tasty and quick to make. I would probably use a finer grind of rosemary next time. And perhaps next time do it with boneless chicken thighs as we prefer dark meat; however that being said this recipe is a keeper!

I omitted the thyme only because I didn't have it, and used garlic powder + table salt instead of garlic salt. I didn't have canned tomatoes so used sliced cherry tomatoes and a tablespoon or so of tomato sauce. I also added spinach. It was very aromatic, and really enjoyable with garden salad and basmati rice. I'll definitely make it again. Super easy.

Really good, didn't put the rotel in it because my daughter fussed but it was really good!  I only used 2 chicken breasts as there are only 3 of us.  If you make more chicken breasts be sure to add a second onion.  
We all loved it.  Great flavor.  Will make again soon.

Flavor was delicious. Next time I will probably cook the onion first to allow them to cook down a little more but that is just a personal preference.

I absolutely love this recipe!!! It is so delicious and gives the chicken an amazing taste. I had leftovers and cut up the chicken and put it in a salad the next day. I made this twice and I made it a little different the first time because I didn't have diced tomatoes, and I have to say I liked it better. Instead of the can of diced tomatoes I used a can of tomato sauce (not prepared, just the tomatoes). I also mixed in a little tomato paste and mixed all of this with the vinegar and seasonings before adding to the chicken and onions. The sauce came out thick and creamy...absolutely delicious!!! I let this cook for awhile until the chicken was so tender it broke apart when I touched it with the fork. MMMMMM!

I made it and though I really love balsamic vinegar I did not much care for the taste.  I  followed the directions with the exception of using 1 clove of minced garlic instead of garlic salt. Did use a good quality balsamic vinegar.  It was easy and did make a nice presentation on serving ( I served the chicken and sauce over a bed of angel hair pasta).  It was okay but I probably would not bother to make it again.

Made for 1, did a half chicken breast. 2 and 1/3 table spoons balsalmic vinegar, added mushrooms and brought other ingredients more in line with a serving for 1. Really really good.

OMG!!! OUTSTANDING!!! I made this recipe  yesterday,  &  was totally  impressed! Totally  restaurant worthy.  I used all ingredients,  exactly  according  to the recipe.  The only thing  I did differently from the recipe,  was put the sauce  &  seasoning  in a separate  pan, simmered  it for about  30 mins,  so the spices in the sauce  was evenly blended,  then poured over the chicken  (cooked according  to the recipe), and simmered for another  30 mins.  Mushrooms  would  be a nice addition  to this recipe,  but not needed. There's enough  sauce  to put the chicken  &  sauce  over rice,  egg noodles,  or whatever  you desire. I have  been  using  this website  for years, &  this is my first review.  (FB  makes it easier  to log in &  write reviews). I found  this recipe,  when I was looking  for something  healthy  to support  my husbands diet). I know  some reviews said  they used chicken  broth &  vinegar). I recommend  cooking  it exactly  as stated, then  make changes  if you're  not happy.  The vinegar  is not overwhelming, (for my family  anyway)! Enjoy!!!

Just great!   Not usually a big fan of chicken--was looking for something different and easy--this was absolutely delicious; I will make it again with a better grade balsamic which can only make it 10 stars.  Thanks for sharing it!

I made the recipe pretty much as is.  I used a roasted garlic balsamic,  and Italian seasoning in place of the herbs called for since I didn't have them all on  hand. I served it over pasta and drizzled the sauce over. It was delicious and extremely easy to prepare.

I made this tonight with ingredients I already had in the house. It came out so flavorful & juicy. I used fresh garlic  and fresh tomatoes because I didn't have any canned. I also used white Balsamic, which has a lighter, almost fruity taste. Very good, very healthy over brown & long grain rice.  Thank you for this recipe, will make again!

I sautéed  the onions first along with some garlic until they were almost browned. Then I added the chicken, which I had coated with seasoned flour.  
Next time I would add some wine to dilute the balsamic vinegar a bit.  Another option would be chicken or vegetable broth.

My husband, who often often finds that boneless chicken breasts are dry was most impressed with the meat's tenderness.
Will definitely prepare this again!

LOVE balsamic vinegar and it translates very well to this recipe. Very intense flavors, if you don't like balsamic vinegar you prob won't care for this. I Followed the recipe but for adding mushrooms and fresh garlic (I never used garlic powder) at the same time as the sliced onion. I also used high end balsamic. Hubby and I both loved it.

Love this recipe. The only thing i changed about the recipe was left out the onions because my boyfriend and 4 year old dont like them but i followed everything else exactly and it was a hit. Even my toddler gobbled it up.

My husband and I are both trying to lose weight so I'm putting together a low-cal cook book for us. I did change up a few things. Like safflower oil instead of olive oil and garlic powder instead of garlic salt (I'm not a fan of anything super salty). I did add about 1/4 teaspoon black lava sea salt from Hawaii. I used fresh tomatoes that were sitting around waiting. I also coated the chicken in all the seasonings before browning. And then added the balsamic vinegar after it was finished so that I could have the amount I liked vs the amount my husband likes. Served with a side of steamed broccoli. Yummmm.

Found it, made it, liked it! It was that quick and easy. Which makes it a really good recipe. I used ro-tel original tomatoes and I thickened the sauce (corn starch)at the end which my husband prefers. I threw in some fresh spinach w/ the onions.  I served w/ yellow rice.   Loved the balsamic with the flavor of the ro-tel tomatoes. Definitely will make again. We rate on our own scale: hubby gave it a solid 7.5 ( high for him) and I gave it a 9 ( very high for me)!

Quick, fast and tasty. This dish was good although I did use half of the balsamic the recipe called for and a can of oregano, basil and garlic diced tomatoes. I served it with steamed broccoli and rice. A must make again!!

I'm not a huge fan of chicken breast, so if I was it might be more than okay. The benefit of it was that it was really quick to make. The sauce was good. I followed the recipe exactly except tailoring down the servings. I also added mushrooms because I had some I needed to use up.

I've made this dish several times. My fiance loves it! The first time, I followed the recipe exactly. Since then, I've gotten more flexible. I love to add mushrooms - they really soak up the wonderful flavors. Green peppers are a nice addition too. We always serve it with noodles, sometimes a vegetable on the side. Flavorful and something I would love to have at a restaurant. Great recipe. Thanks!

I like the basalmic vinegar effect. I changed to fresh tomatoes and added red wine for the juice. Also added crimini mushrooms and yellow bell peppers cut in large pieces, and substituted fresh for dry garlic. I'll make this again. Easy, fast and tasty.

Delicious. Make sure your chicken breasts aren't too think or they don't absorb the taste as well and come out dry in the center. That was my mistake. Next time I might try doing it with chicken strips instead of whole breasts.

I love that this recipe packs a great flavor punch without a lot of preparation. In fact, maybe a teeny bit too much punch.  I adore balsamic vinegar, but did find that it was the only ingredient I could taste and the other yummy ingredients had been relegated to just interesting texture.  I do think that it could be partially due to the very high quality balsamic vinegar that I used, so I gave the recipe 4 stars instead of 3.  I would recommend cutting back the balsamic vinegar quantity a little though.  All in all, great dinner that can even be thrown together on a weeknight.

Great taste!  

I would recommend mixing the sauce ahead of time so the spices have time to blend together and soften.

I cut the balsamic vinegar in half like others suggested and it was great.  I also used a fresh garlic glove instead of garlic salt, then seasoned chicken with salt and pepper.

I made this recipe tonight almost exactly as written, except I didn't have rosemary so left it out. I thought I had a large bottle of balsamic vinegar with a small amount in the bottom, but I was wrong. I had a bottle of less-than-perfect, store-brand stuff. I have no idea how it got into my pantry but I'm thinking someone must have given it to my husband (the never-throw-anything-out kind of guy) and he brought it home, put it away, thinking I'd think I had bought it. Anyway, I did have a balsamic glaze made from Balsamic Vinegar from Modena. I used this but slightly diluted with chicken broth. It is to die for good. Back to the recipe.... it turned out incredible. I did add a tablespoon of brown sugar to balance out the sweet/sour/savory thing. I served it with steamed rice. Will I make it again? You bet - in a heart-beat. It was super easy, economical, and tasted like heaven.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was pretty good. I would make it again but won't go out of my way to. Other review said to maybe add less Basalmic vinegar but I don't think having less is going to change anything. Vinegar dressings are often a good match for chicken, but I was wondering if it might have been better with some butter or something to cut the acid just a little bit and to make the sauce creamier.

Super easy - super delicious.  I added chicken broth (equal parts to balsamic) to cut the "sharpness" out.  Still had that delicious balsamic flavor.  Added garlic in with onions and tomatoes and topped with fresh balsamic.  LOVED this dish.  Served with pasta and syrian green beans (also on this site).  Whole family loved it.  Great to have new dish in circulation...

Add me to the 5 star list! This was really very good, and very easy to prepare. The only modification I made was to use fresh garlic instead of garlic salt. Definitely a keeper...the whole family enjoyed this dish.

I didn't have any diced tomatoes, so I used leftover marinara sauce.. Added a red wine reduction to the chicken & onions sautéing.  Lastly added mozzarella to the top of the chicken. Added a side of steamed broccoli..shhhh don't tell my husband I can cook??

I caramelized onions separately in the butter then added to the chicken. Also went  easier on the vinegar  and instead of fresh tomatoes used RoTel tomato and green chilly mix. The dish came out delicious. We loved it and def will do it again.

I did bought Italian seasoning but realized that I should have added a couple pinches of salt also. Other than that, it was delicious! Ate with quinoa as a side dish.

I added jalapenos and mushrooms. Instead of chicken breast I used chicken thigh meat. I also served it over Mexican rice. It was fantastic! It was also cheap and easy. I'll definitely be doing it again.

Delicious!  I added about 1 1/2 cups of  crimini mushrooms to the onions.  Other than that I followed the recipe, and we all really enjoyed it!  We always use really quality balsamic, and I'm sure that makes a huge difference.  I cooked some angel hair while it was simmering. Crunchy French bread and a salad and you have a winner!  It was also easy!

I added green peppers and mushrooms, and used fresh romas rather than canned tomatoes. I needed to add som water, or maybe I should have turned down the heat a bit after adding the BV. Delicious!

Used a 28 oz. can of tomatoes but otherwise followed the recipe (cooked off the extra liquid).  Served with mashed potatoes.  Next time I would use about 1/3 cup balsamic vinegar instead of 1/2 cup and serve with pasta.
This was a very fast meal and tasty but felt like something was missing.

It was pretty good. Can be cooked covered to retain moisture & it would be better with more veggies added as others have suggested.

I made this tonight...I didn't have chicken breasts but I did have chicken (bone in) thighs. It was wonderful! Omg the aroma and the flavor of the sauce is amazing. The meat fell off of the bone! Thanks for such a great recipe.

I was making half the recepi and instead of the 14oz diced tomatoes I used 10oz Rotel diced tomatoes & green chilies. It gave the unbelievable flavor.

Made this last night for dinner. O.M.G!  The quickest and best pan fried chicken I have ever made!  We love balsamic vinegar and I used a pomegranate infused balsamic vinegar. Yummy!  I wasn't thinking about what to serve it with and had already made baked potatoes. I just served the sauce over the potato! Next time I will use rice, and to tone down the acid I will add a pinch of sugar. Thank you for this great recipe!  My go to Greek-Medditeranean meal!

Excellent recipe!!! Used 2 cans of diced tomatoes and 1 cup of balsamic vinegar since I used more chicken then the recipe called for. Took large spoon of sauce and mixed with flour then Poured back in pan to thicken sauce.   Very tasty.  Served over Bow Tie pasta.  This is a keeper!

This is a wonderfully simple chicken dish. It went very well with rice and grilled artichoke, but would go just as well with pasta. This will almost certainly go into the regular dinner rotation.

This has become one of my favorite chicken recipes.  I wasn't sure how my family would like the balsamic taste, but everyone loves it.  Very good over rice or pasta.

I make this recipe relatively often.  I love it!!!! I have made a few changes.  I use fire roasted diced tomatoes and usually more diced tomatoes and balsamic.  I also cook the chicken slower by simmering the chicken in the tomatoes and balsamic and spices.  Makes the chicken very tender and flavorful.  I serve over egg noodles. So nummy!!!!  Giving 4 stars only because I like my additions and changes.

Love, love, love this. It was simple enough for a weeknight, but so flavorful. The chicken was moist and delicious. The only changes I made were that I sauteed my onions in a separate pan with a little butter (because there just wasn't room in the pan with the chicken), and after the chicken was cooked, I sliced it into tender-like pieces. The whole family loved this, from the 3-year-old to grandma! This will definitely be in heavy rotation for us!

This recipe was great! I threw all of the ingredients in a crock pot for 8.5 hours on low and served over angel hair pasta. Delicious! My husband requested that I make it every week :)

This was my kind of recipe - easy, quick, and delicious.  We loved it. I used garlic powder and sea salt because that's what I had, and I was out of Rosemary, and it was still  delicious.  I served it on thin spaghetti.

This recipe is easy and quick to make and delicious.  I would either use a little less balsamic vinegar next time or use a better quality, aged vinegar which is a little sweeter.

This tastes so much fancier and difficult than it was to prepare.  Totally appropriate for guests.  My only change was to add 1 T of fresh minced garlic to the onions.  I used fresh ground sea salt and fresh ground pepper to season the breasts before browning.

I paired it with roasted green beans and garlic mashed potatoes.  A delicious, easy, fast recipe for any night of the week.

The dish looked nothing like the picture and was black - the tomatoes completely disappeared! I would use use 1/4 of the balsamic vinegar, adding  a teaspoon of brown sugar to counter the sourness  - if I try it again. Quite tasty with pasta but somehow did not seem right,  rice is probablybetter. Try fresh herbs if you have them.

Yummy! My whole family love it. Didn't change anything in the recipes. Expect slice the chicken into slices. Usually my kids hate eating chicken breast but when I made them this for dinner the other night. Wow, they love it! They even ate leftover the next day. Making it again for dinner tonight.

Delicious!  This dish was a hit with both my husband and 2 year old. I did use half the balsamic and substitute chicken broth for the other half of the liquid. Turned out great, and easy to make :-)

Pretty tasty. I think my husband and I just aren't huge fans of balsamic vinegar, so we only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 for the reason, not anything to do with the recipe. We served it with pasta with asparagus pesto--a good combination. For our family (2 adults), 6 svgs = 4 individual meals

I Was In Love! What a great dish! I skipped the herbs and added the equivalent in Italian seasoning, since that was all I had on hand, and it worked great. I followed everything else to a T and everyone adored it. What amazing flavor! Thank you for a wonderfully well-created and well-written recipe! (Btw, this was my first time cooking chicken so I had someone watching over me and this recipe made it really simple. Thank you!)

I used fresh basil and fresh garlic (plus regular salt) but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  My husband and I both loved it and it was so easy to prepare.  We will definitely make this again. Thanks!

So easy & so tasty! I was looking for something that wouldn't require the oven heating up the house. My daughter made it as written & everyone liked it very much! I do think I will make some additions - capers, olives, fresh pressed garlic instead of garlic powder, artichoke hearts etc...

This was fast, easy, and delicious. I used half regular balsamic vinegar and half fig balsamic vinegar. I can't pass a vinegar and oil shop without buying something. With all of the super sweet, fruit-infused choices out there, this recipe could really lend itself beautifully. Would be great using pork chops, as well. Served with blue cheese mashed potatoes.

My 18 month old ate this dish like nothing I have ever seen, definitely making it again! Will do more salt and add some cut up pineapple for a contrast in flavor.

Very simple, and went over well. For my preferences, it was too tangy and the onions felt  slimy in it. Visually, however, the dish was absolutely gorgeous.

Nice easy recipe, the broth tastes great. Leaves a nice taste but is somewhat underwhelming. Nonetheless, this is a cool recipe for when you have some chicken breast lying around. Pretty good.

My family loved this!  I used World Market balsamic vinegar and followed the recipe with the following changes.  After 10 minutes of simmering, I cut the chicken into smaller pieces to soak up more liquid.  Then I simmered for 10 more minutes.  I wanted a thicker sauce so I mixed some of the liquid with cornstarch.  My son went back for thirds.

I love balsamic flavor so this was perfect for me. The only thing I changed was using granulated garlic vs garlic salt, then I salted just to taste.

Great recipe. It was delicious on top of garlic cauliflower mash with a spring salad dressed with balsamic vinegar.

Made it a few weeks ago for my husband, daughter and myself and it turned out GREAT. It has a very strong balsamic taste, sort of overwhelming for me personally, but I guess it'd be fine if you are a huge fan of balsamic vinegar. Next time I may cut down on the balsamic vinegar but overall it was amazing. Very nice and tender and it was even juicy and tender the next day when we ate it at lunch as leftovers.

This is so good! I had fire roasted diced garlic tomatoes on hand that I used and instead of the dried oregano and Rosemary I used a drop of oregano and Rosemary food grade essential oil! I used the juices and tomatoes left over(we only did 2 chicken breasts) to sauté some balsamic and garlic marinated asparagus! Yum-O!

We really enjoyed this recipe! It was light and flavorful.  I had a little bit of leftover pesto so I rubbed it on the chicken before I cooked it.  It added just a little extra flavor. We really like balsamic vinegar especially with basil and tomatoes so we loved it, however, if you don't like balsamic vinegar it might not be for you. I also used my Italian seasoning mix instead of individual seasonings and it was just right!

My husband and I love this dish. It was something different and just what we needed! Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. The only change he made when preparing was that he butterflied and pounded the chicken out with a meat tenderizer.

This was a hit! The only thing I did differently was add a pinch of brown sugar to combat the bitter vinegar.
I will be making this again very soon.

Five out of six liked this. I used Italian stewed tomatoes and a couple fresh sprigs of rosemary. I also substituted a clove of garlic for the garlic salt. It was easy to make and tasty.

This is so delicious!! I made this with my mom and everyone was a huge fan.  Personally, I am not a huge fan of balsamic vinegar.  However, it definitely gave this recipe its kick.  It gives the sauce such a tangy, almost sweet flavor.  We followed the directions exactly, but my mom accidentally got a can of petite-cut tomatoes.  It was still so delicious, even my picky sister loved it.  Next time, we both agreed we would double the sauce as well as doubling the onions because it wasn't enough for us.  YUM!

Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  This was AMAZING!!   My husband and I both loved it!  I did make one change.. I cut the balsamic in half as some reviewers suggested, but I wish I hadn't!  We ended up adding balsamic back in at the table to give it more flavor.  I served this with orzo and roasted asparagus.  Delicious meal!  Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow!

This was easy and delicious. Pretty much followed the recipe other than subbing chicken thighs for breast and fresh garlic for garlic salt.  I used 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar and 1/4 cup chicken stock since my husband isn't as fond of vinegar as I am. But I think it would be delicious either way. The other ingredients do mellow out the vinegar flavor. He and my daughter both loved it.  Will try it in the crock pot based on another review next time to make it even easier.

What a fantastic recipe! I prepared this braised balsamic chicken with a sweet onion. I didn't cut the onion thin because I love the medium pieces. I used boneless skinless tenderloin and cooked six pieces. I will say that the sauce was to die for and it was sweet. it yielded enough liquid for six servings (gravy) over white rice. I added more of the seasonings on top of what was listed. I'd prepare this again with rice or try pasta with parm cheese on top.

Made this one time and it will be the last time. The flavours just do not go well together and the vinegar over powers any of the other flavours.

I used 16oz tomato sauce because i didn't have any diced tomatoes. I also did not use rosemary. Mixed the sauce together while the chicken cooked with the onion and simmered for about 20 minutes. Wonderful! Next time i will cube the chicken instead of leaving the whole breast.

I LOVED this.  Not sure if it made a difference, but the diced tomatoes I used were already flavored with garlic and onions.  I thought the dish was perfectly balanced with great flavors.  And, easy one pot cooking.

After reading the reviews where people said it was too balsamic-y, I asked my husband if he liked it. He came up with the same comment, that it was too balsamic-y.  

We ate the same meal, but his side dish was pasta with more of the braised balsamic sauce piled on it.  

I ate plain rice with my chicken, and it was perfect!  I thought about it every day for a week & bought the ingredients to make it again.

So, although the balsamic sauce is yummy, a little goes a long way.

Made this tonite for dinner and it was a WIN! My fiance and I loved it. I even gave our 1 yr old a taste and got a big smile. Our neighbors actually made thid for us after I came home from delivery, I had been wanting to make it ever since I just thought it was gonna be extremely hard but this recipe was super easy and your company wouldnt even know it. the only thing different I used was 2 tablespoons of sugar it mellowed out strong tart taste while not taking away from the flavor of the vinegar. I really enjoyed making this recipe I will definitely be making it again.

Tried it tonight and read some reviews and used some of the things people suggested. I put it on top of angel hair pasta, added some bell pepper and mushrooms. I also was afraid of the balsamic vinaigrette so I only used 1/4 and filled the rest of the 1/2 cup with water.  Husband snarled his nose while cooking it but was a hit at the dinner table!! I got all thumbs up on this and will use the entire 1/2 cup next time :)

Great recipe! Easy and quick to make with ingredients always in the house. I used fresh garlic and Rosemary because they were available. Halved the vinegar and used twice as much diced tomatoes as I had a large can and I don't like to waste. I served it over baby potatoes with a healthy scoop of sour cream. As well, added some sautéed mushrooms, cauliflower and kale to be lazy and make it a one pot dish. I can't imagine messing this one up! Highly recommend it especially when pinched for time and you want a healthy meal.

This recipe is delish.  The hubs, who does not have an adventurous palate, said that is was a keeper.  I did, however, add a little bit more garlic salt to the tomato mixture.  I served it with green beans and Quinoa pasta.  I mixed olive oil, parsley, and grated Parmesan in with the pasta.  Just a really simple, tasty meal.

Awesome, tastes amazing. Assuming you like balsamic vinegar, which we love. The onions are possibly the best part. After simmering in that sauce for that long, I'm not sure how anything could not taste great.

OMG! Absolutely delicious! Used cherry tomatoes from my garden that I roasted in the oven instead of the can of tomatoes. Other than that followed the recipe exactly as written. Served it with garlic flavored quinoa and sautéed mushrooms. My husband loved it too! Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this several times. I now use canned tomatoes with Italian spices already in them. I like the flavor blend better.

I loved how easy it was to make. Simple, few ingredients and quick. It was ok, not bad, but not great. That is coming from someone who loves basalmic vinegar.

Would be better with less balsamic vinegar. Next time I will try with half vinegar, half white wine.

Tender chicken, great balsamic flavor. Added some extra garlic. Great with some balsamic potatoes on the side.

Followed recipe with no changes and it was excellent! I love dishes with balsamic vinegar. I do use vegetarian fed non antibiotic chicken breasts (IMO higher quality chicken makes a huge difference in any dish).  My side was spinach with minced garlic and some sea salt and fresh ground mixed pepper.

Delicious and Easy!  I confess I had to tweak.  This is what I did: added mushrooms with the onions (hubby has to have shrooms on everything); thickened sauce with cornstarche water; added turmeric powder when adding pepper and garlic powder to chicken before browning. Turned out fabulous!  Will make again! !

I made this recipe twice. The first time I made it directly from the directions and I did not like it. Since the reviews were so positive I decided to give it another try with better balsamic and fresh herbs. I took several suggestions from other reviews which made the dish delicious. I mixed the sauce in a bowl and adjusted the seasonings and vinegar according to taste. I also added some chicken broth. I used at least twice the fresh basil but less thyme and rosemary than the recipe called for. I still thought it was too much rosemary. I used dried oregano but also did not use all that was called for. I served this with broccoli and a tomato basil quinoa. It was delicious.

I normally love balsamic vinegar on anything, but these were not very moist and tender and the vinegar flavor was overpowering.  Hubby agreed with me.  Kids did not eat... Not difficult to make, but won't make again.

Easy, fast and even my nine year old liked it. Although, she did scrape the onions and tomatoes off! The chicken was tender. We paired it with rice and green beans. Nice light meal that tasted great!

This was so good! My family loved it. I only used 1/4 cup of the balsamic vinegar, & I added some roasted red pepper, green bell pepper & garlic. I also used fresh herbs instead of dried. We served it over whole wheat pasta with peas & carrots on the side. My husband raved over it & can't wait for us to have it again.

Was not a huge fan.  However my girlfriend liked it.  If I made it again I would cut the amount of balsamic!  I used green onion because she is not a big onion fan.

I used half balsamic vinegar and half chicken stock. It was a good dish, not amazing, but for the amount of time it took to make (15 min?!) it deserves atleast 4 stars. I don't know if i'll make it often, but if you need something fast, this totally works. I also added mushrooms to my dish, and served it with white rice. The more sauce you make the better!

Great recipe!  Didn't have quite half a cup of balsamic vinegar so I topped it off with chicken stock as some people recommended.  Used fresh rosemary but dry basil and oregano, no thyme (just because that's what I had on hand).  LOVE this.  Will make it again!

This was good. I used the directions with the exception of following advice to reduce the vinegar to one-quarter cup and add one-quarter cup chicken broth to make up the difference in volume.

I thought this dish was pretty good. The chicken was wonderful; however, I thought the sauce was a little too "spiced up," particularly because they were dried spices. Next time, I may just add a few dashes of each. I also, similar to other reviewers, thought the balsamic was overwhelming and too "tangy," so I added a tablespoon or two of sugar. My husband loved the dish, so will be trying again.

Quick, easy, delicious! I didn't have tomato paste, so I subbed some sauce and it was still delicious. I also sliced the breasts in half through the middle so they weren't as thick for cooking. The result was tender, moist, easy to cut chicken.

Good taste, quick and easy to prepare; I think the recipe calls for a little too much balsamic. Will try again with half the balsamic and supplement the other half with chicken stock. Will also add minced garlic two minutes after adding onions. Also will need to reduce thyme and rosemary by half.

This has been one of my favorite chicken recipes for several years.  I usually double it so I can freeze half. To make it particularly freezer friendly, I cut the chicken  into small pieces before browning. My kids like it over pasta with Parmesan cheese.

This was great! I followed the suggestion of adding a little chicken broth to the sauce to make it less tangy. My family still thought it was tangy but we loved it. I didn't have rosemary and that didn't affect it at all. I served it with white rice. Will definitely be making it again. Thanks!

At first I thought about reducing the amount of balsamic vinegar, but the tomatoes and onions help to reduce the sharpness of the vinegar. This is now one of my go-to recipes for when I'm too tired to make anything fancy, and my family always eats rice with the chicken.

This dish was pretty tasty and easy to make. I had average quality balsamic and canned stewed tomatoes on hand. I only had Italian seasonings. I used fresh garlic as suggested as others. The onions cooked down nicely and went well over pasta. The chicken breast was moist and tasty. I usually overcook breast meat and it comes out dry. It doesn't seem easy to dry out the chicken with this recipe. Will definitely add to my rotation.

This was really good. My family enjoyed it... I added a little kicking chicken seasoning to the meat before cooking it, and it turned out to be one of those meals family want to add on monthly menu...

I used fresh herbs, but made the recipe pretty much as written. To my taste, the flavors of the herbs plus those of the tomato and balsamic vinegar clashed. I would not make this again. There are other similar recipes that are much better.

I thought this was really good, and even the kids loved it. I did follow some of the suggestions by adding brown sugar to the balsamic vinegar, but that was the only change I made.

Tried this tonight, and it was delish...I got it started in a pan, as directed, but put it in a baking dish to finish it in the oven...I used thighs, and cut the recipe in half!  We will be making this again. My husband says it will be one of our "go-to" recipes.  Even with my customization of this recipe, it is a keeper.

The chicken came so tender and juicy. Definitely a keeper for us. I did make one change. I didn't have tomatoes so I used asparagus. Came out just fine.

Really good and super easy.  I cut the chicken into big chunks to help it cook quicker and added a little corn starch to thicken the sauce but did everything else as directed.  My husband announced it is his new favorite meal and he can't wait for it to make it back in the rotation.  Thanks for a great week night dinner!  Oh,and served with fettuccine alfredo and mixed veggies, yum.

I did doctor this recipe a little to our personal tastes. I added minced garlic to the olive oil when cooking the chicken. I'm not a big fan of garlic salt so I just worked that out on my own with real garlic and salt. I'll use my favorite higher grade balsamic next time rather than the store brand I used. The balsamic I usually buy has more flavor and I think that's all the difference it will take to make this a 5 rather than a 4.

My 7.5 year old daughter made this all by herself!  We all loved it!  We didn't make any changes other than used fresh tomatoes instead of canned.  This really is an easy recipe and tastes soooo good!

I have made this a few times and love it, very easy and healthy.  Today I added chopped spinach and sliced olives.  I was out of balsamic vinegar and used a balsamic vinaigrette from the store so I left out the dried herbs as they were in the store dressing/marinade. Also will add feta cheese when I serve it over pasta. Now it is a all in one dish

Made as directed and we enjoyed it but we also like vinegar. I certainly like the method of preparation and the chicken was unbelievably tender and moist. I'll definitively make it again but it's not a "regular rotation" meal.

So tasty. Nice to use so many herbs from my windowsill garden and I added a step before, sautéing mushrooms, returning them back in near the end.

This recipe was delicious and worthy of serving to company! The Balsamic vinegar gave it a rich flavor, but was not over powering at all. With the vinegar and tomatoes I was worried about it being too acidic so I added a tsp. of sugar to the vinegar before adding it to the dish. I used McCormick grinder Italian seasoning to the chicken before browning it. I served it with Basmati rice and asparagus. My picky teenagers thought I was serving them a "fancy smancy" meal and yet it was so easy and they LOVED it!!

My family loved this meal.  My husband said this is the best meal I had ever cooked.  I only made a couple small changes.  I cut the chicken breast in half and added a package of fresh sliced mushrooms when I added the tomatoes.  I used the best quality balsamic available at my grocery store.  I served it over angel hair pasta with roasted asparagus.

this was fine. It is a great way to make boneless skinless chicken breasts more flavorable. If I make it again, I will brown the chicken first before the onions. I will cut down on the balsamic and add chicken broth. Be sure to serve over pasta or rice.

This recipe is delicious! I doubled the sauce, so there was plenty to serve over pasta. I recommend a few changes. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Cook the onions with minced garlic before adding the chicken. That way the onions get nice and soft. After you add the ingredients for the sauce, let it simmer on low/med for 45 min until the sauce thickens. It won't be too tangy, and it even tastes a little sweet.

The balsamic measure must be inaccurate as I followed to the letter and the balsamic overpowered and soured the entire meal.  The thyme wasn't my favourite spice either as it seemed all I tasted was Balsamic and Thyme.

I tried to cut the acidity but couldn't get a flavour anyone cared for.

This dish was absolutely amazing!!! Everyone loved it. Only thing I did different was use a 1/4 cup of the balsamic vinaigrette because we really aren't found of a vinaigrette taste, and added 2 table spoons of soy sauce and 1 table spoon of dales seasoning. Definitely making this dish again!

VERY very tasty, however, I didn't use a great quality balsamic. Rating the result of what I made, I'd say it was a 3 1/2 - 4 star, but can likely blame that on the balsamic that I used. I m going to invest in a better vinegar and try this again.

Very easy and tasty recipe.  Instead of adding basil, oregano and rosemary, I just used canned tomatoes that were already seasoned.  Also, like some of the other commenters, I substituted chicken stock for half of the vinegar.

Made this for lunch today and we loved it! I followed the recipe except for the onions (I don't like them) used onion flakes instead. Like some others have said I used 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar. I cooked my chicken first, removed then cut up fresh tomatoes mixed with the other spices listed sauted then added the chicken back to simmer in the juices. I served with rice, a bean salad & brussell sprouts cooked in apple juice. YUMMY! :)

Made this for the family everyone thought it tasted like something you would get in a restaurant. I used my wok. The next time I make this, I would slice the onions thick and add additional veggies to it. The sauce is a great marinade.

I made this the other night and it was so good and so easy. I love that there is enough sauce, tomatoes and onions to drape over the chicken. I hate when chicken sits there with just seasoning, it seems so boring. This recipe is definitely not boring, for your plate or your taste buds!

This dish was amazing.  I used a quality balsamic and quality EVOO and the sauce was perfect.  I did mix the spices, balsamic and tomatoes together before putting in the pan which worked much better.  We will definitely make this again!  I paired it with Parmesan and Basil Orzo and it made for an excellent meal.

Came out excellent! Did not change a thing. Spooned a bit of the sauce and onions over the chicken after about 10 minutes cooked it covered for another 10 minutes and was perfectly cooked to temp. Served on white rice with a bit of the sauce and a side of steamed broccoli,cauliflower and carrots. Will be making this one again!

Yum! I will definitely make this again; even with my Western Family balsamic we had on hand. My husband isn't as crazy about balsamic as I am, so I added a pinch of brown sugar. Might add something hot next time, red pepper or chipotle. Kept chicken juicy and so easy. We had ours with baked broccoli and long grain rice. I drizzled the sauce over all the sides and it especially went well with the broccoli.

Over the top delicious!!! Made the recipe as written, except used pounded chicken tenderloins. Half sauted the onions and then added the tenderloins and the rest of the ingredients . Served with a side of mashed potatoes, coverd with some more of the delicious sauce and of course a veggie. This is a keeper. A great dish for guests. Thank You for Sharing.

Made this for company and it worked out so well. It's so easy that I plan on making it again and again. Some notes: it is important to use a decent sweet balsamic vinegar. I like Lucini, Monari Federzoni, or Colavita for the supermarket brands. Also, Muir Glen organic fire roasted diced tomatoes added nice flavor. They are so much more flavorful than other canned tomatoes. Finally, I have a 12-inch skillet and 4 chicken breast-halves just fit, even though the recipe is for 6. Luckily I was just cooking for 4 guests. I could not find any smaller skinless breast-halves at the supermarket that would fit 6 in a skillet.

I made this dish for my boyfriend tonight and he loved it! We are both a fan of tangy flavor so this was right on the money. He loves mushrooms so I added them in with the onions. I plated this over some angel hair pasta tossed with olive oil and some Parmesan. There was plenty of sauce to drizzle all over! Very quick and easy for a large flavor payoff.

I used chicken thighs instead of breasts and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  I thought it was great and the bf raved about it.  Will be making this one again for sure.

I make this several times a month. The recipe is fantastic as is. Easy enough for weeknight, elegant enough for company. It is a keeper for sure!

My friend made this for us and it was sooo good that I had to make it for myself. Each time was delicious! I recommend this to anyone that wants something quick and easy. I paired it with asparagus & cornbread. awesome.

Easy to prepare and very tasty! I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut the tang of the vinegar with about 1/2 cup of chicken broth.

I've made this several times now and enjoy it each time. I'm not a huge fan of the balsamic vinegar so I only add about a 1/4 cup. I liked it much better the second time when I made it like that. This recipe is simple and quick to make.

Quick and easy, and tasty!!  I love balsamic vinegar.  Wasn't sure if the rest of my family would like it, but everyone did.  Very good served over rice.

Great recipe!  But made some adjustments. We cut the amount of Balsamic Vinegar in half, added chicken stock, added green peppers & mushrooms, and served over spaghetti squash in lieu of pasta for a healthier option.

Totally delicious!
I admit I made minor adjustments.  I used more canned tomato than called for (I was only making 2 chicken breasts)...about 3/4 a can and I also added fresh sliced tomatoes.  I added a tablespoon of Cabernet as well.  It was fantastic.  My husband loved it and I did too!

Terrific! I used boneless/skinless thighs and they were fantastic in this recipe. I usually make the soy sauce chicken when I have thighs and bake them, but this was so quick and easy and moist and delicious that my old standby recipe just got replaced! I didn't use the onion because my family isn't that fond of them, but even without the onion this recipe is a keeper! Thanks for sharing :-)

This was delicious! I was really skeptical with that much vinegar but I simmered it 30 minutes longer than the recipe calls for and it was absolutely tender and terrific.

So easy to make! It was a hit with my family. I cut the amount of balsamic vinegar in half and there was still plantu of flavor. Served with a side of sauteed green beans and rice pilaf.

Absolutely loved this recipe. My wife thought it was good but she doesn't love vinegar like I do. I can and on occasion do drink vinegar straight, but she said it was very good, just not her favorite. Again, as always, followed the recipe exactly the first time.

I loved this recipe! Everything turned out perfect and it goes great with rice. I did need a lot less balsamic than the suggested amount but to each his own :) I used 6 skinless thighs instead of breasts and it still turned out amazing. I took this with me for lunch 3 days in a row and still not tired of it! Very very good recipe!

Really really good!  I prepared the chicken breasts scallopini-style, brown them and left the whole mixture to marinate for a 6 hours in fridge. Came home and dinner was ready in 20 minutes and tasted awesome!!!  Husband announced that he is having the rest for lunch tomorrow!  Thank you thank you Moonandback!

I like this recipe. Very quick & easy. My only changes were that I used garlic paste instead of salt, added a bit of chicken stock to cut the tartness of the vinegar and added a little brown sugar. I'll definitely make again. Perhaps I'll invest in a better quality balsamic vinegar and I'll chunk my chicken.

I think some people don't like an overwhelming taste of balsamic vinegar which is why they don't like this recipe. You can always tone it down by decreasing the vinegar and adding a neutral ingredient such as cream (I made mine creamy with a few chunks of cream cheese). This will give you a juicy sauce to add in pasta to tone the balsamic down some more.... that's what I did and it was a hit.

This is a "go to" recipe for me! I've made this dish several times and it always turns out amazing. I have even tweaked it to use it as a homemade marinara sauce. Its a really great flavor! I wasn't sure at first if I would like the balsamic taste but trust me that the balsamic flavor really rounds this dish out nicely. I do recommend grinding the rosemary or finely chopping it. Its never fun to take a bite and get pricked by a piece of dried rosemary!

As written this dish doesn't cook long enough for the flavors to meld together.  It would be better if the juices reduced and thickened, but there's no way to do that in 20 mins.  I agree, fresh minced garlic is the better way to go. I might try it again in the crock pot.

We made this tonight. My husband and I thought it was good and I appreciate the fact that it is healthy, cheap, and easy to make. I tend to always have these ingredients in the pantry or can substitute something else. Tonight, we subbed some fresh chopped tomatoes for the canned.  We served it over pasta because it was strong but I really think it would be awesome over some cornbread...

I was looking for a recipe to make with what I had on hand and found this.  We loved it!  Not only was it delicious, but it was so quick and easy. I didn't measure the balsalmic vinegar and I don't think I used enough, next time I will make sure to use the full 1/2 cup.  The only ingredient I didn't have was rosemary, and I really like rosemary.  I can't wait to make this again when I have some. And I will make this again, and again and again.

You must like the tartness of balsamic vinegar and the over powering nature of the dried herbs to like this recipe.  I didn't like it at all and I made the recipe according to the instructions.  Sorry.

I love anything with tomatoes and vinegar.  This is what I call a "home from work quick dish".  I enjoyed it, although I found the sauce a bit thick.  Second time round I added more vinegar. I don't have garlic salt, so put in a clove of garlic.  I don't like chicken breasts.  I used wings - not that it matters.  I don't think I will make it again.

This was very easy to make and tasted delicious. I didn't have any canned tomatoes so I substituted same amount of heirloom tomatoes for canned ones. Also added quartered baby Bella mushrooms towards the end. Everything tasted great. Will definitely make this again.

We liked this recipe quite a bit.  You really do need to be a fan of balsamic and herbs to like this recipe, because the flavors are quite strong.  I may even back the dried herbs down to about half the next time we make it.  Great chicken dish though.

I would not give this recipe 4 1/2 stars.  I made it just as it read.
I found the balsamic vinegar was all you could taste.
Definitely would not make it again.

Love this dish. Made some modifications. Used fresh copped basil, minced garlic, and instead of the spices in this recipe I just seasoned with Italian seasoning. I used Italian stewed tomatoes. Added portobello mushrooms. Instead of pouring balsamic vinegar into it, I reduced the balsamic and had it on the side to drizzled over the chicken. That way people can have as much or as little balsamic. Also melted mozzarella cheese over it.

This was a great recipe. Took me a little bit longer to cook the chicken than was stated in the recipe but in the end it was pretty good. I think I will try a dash of something to cut down the acidity next time.

Wanted to like the recipe, it looked great and smelled great.  The flavor just wasn't WOW...which is odd, considering how many flavoring adding items are in it.  I served it with rice, and if I do decide to make it again, I would serve it with mashed potatoes.    Even my daughter said she thought it didn't go with rice.   Had fun making it, maybe our 
Trader Joe's brand Balsamic left something to be desired?  When I asked my Husband and daughter if I should save the recipe to make again, they both said.....ahhhhh, no.

This was a great recipe, just needs a bit more garlic and fresh with garlic salt. I was afraid of the Balsamic so I cut it back a little. I will use as recipe calls next time. Very good!

Everyone loved this. The directions did not say if the tomatoes were meant to be drained or not, unless I missed it somewhere. I left them undrained since I saw some reviews were saying the vinegar taste is strong. It was delicious. I am making it again tonight because my daughter chose it for her dinner day.

Very good. As other reviewers state, I will try a higher quality balsamic next time I make it. I'll also sautee some garlic in the pan instead of garlic salt. Very tender and very easy.

Super easy, super tasty! I can get a little overloaded on balsamic flavors, so I did as reviewers suggested and halved the balsamic with chicken broth. I made sure to turn the breasts as they cooked to get the flavors soaking in both sides. My husband loved it and actually requested I use more onion next time since they turned out so yummy! Next time I think I'll try some of the canned tomatoes "with basil" to see how that turns out. I would imagine this would do really well in a slow cooker as well, so I'll have to give that a go!

quick and easy with things I usually have on hand. I gave a new rating after making this again night. I've decided the key is to use really fresh (dried) herbs and good quality balsamic. It maybe it's that I was really hungry tonight but this was awesome! Didn't change a thing.

This dish was really good. I'll make it again. I used lemon juice instead of oil to brown my chicken which is a nice alternative for those on a calorie restricted diet as well as a nice tenderizer.

OMG this was sooooooooooooooooo good. I made mine a little different, but it came out excellent! For the most part, I made the dish as stated, however, I used chicken thighs instead, and browned them on the stove with the onions and transfered everything into a baking dish. Since I had never cooked with balsamic vinegar, at the very last minute, I threw in about a half cup of chicken stock, then changed my mind, and added more balsamic vinegar!(I have a picky 6 y.o.) Unlike the recipe, I baked it for about an hour or until it was cooked and reduced. Absolutely delicious!!! Thanks again for the recipe!

Delish! The sauce is to die for; added a bit more chicken broth to cut the vinegar...but...OH!

This was pretty good - I kept the ingredients the same just took out the tomatoes.  I think if I used a more expensive balsamic it would've been better because the "bite" wasn't as strong as I was thinking it would be.  I'll try it again and see... overall a good recipe for quick/easy.

DON'T CHANGE A THING! One of the only recipes I have made exactly as stated, and it couldn't have come out better! Everyone loved it, including my picky eaters! It made a beautiful presentation served over wilted spinach. I wish I'd taken a picture to share! Will definitely keep in our regular rotation, and its wonderful for guests as well! I was worried about the spices and almost halved them as others had done, and I'm SO glad I didn't! I was also hesitant about the balsalmic vinegar from other reviews but bought a good one and stuck with the recipe as stated! DON'T CHANGE A THING! THANKS FOR A DELICIOUS AND EASY-TO-PREPARE MEAL!!!!!

Made this for dinner last night.  My sister-in-law was in town and I wanted to cook something special for her.  It was very, very good.  The sauce reduced nicely and I paired it with garlic mashed and zucchini tots.  You could cut the chicken with a fork - very tender and moist.

I love this recipe is fast and easy to make. The key to it is to really let it simmer all the herbs combine and the taste of everything together is just amazing.

I loved this sauce. The chicken was great but I loved the sauce. I took the extra and put it on pasta the following evening. I am a big balsamic vinegar fan. I could just eat the sauce. Can't wait to try it with steak.

One of my favorite chicken dishes for the family. When i'm looking for a quick and easy chicken dinner this is my go to. I'm not a big fan of a lot of Italian spices in my meals so I altered the ingredients by just adding a little bit of oregano and used the garlic salt.

Perfect as is. Changed recipe from 6 to 2 servings. Even at 2 servings, sauce could have accommodated 3-4 small chicken breasts (and I am a sauce girl!). No need to double this sauce recipe.

My boyfriend isn't a huge fan of balsamic, but he ate two servings of this! Don't drain the tomatoes before you throw them in; I simmered the chicken at a higher heat with plenty of diced tomato juices and balsamic vinaigrette and it turned out really tender. I used red onions as well, which stood out against the other flavors well.

Served with rice and side of broccoli. The balsamic was a tad too sweet for my husband, but that may be bcs I scaled the recipe down. I thoroughly enjoyed it and will be making it again!

Different. We did use a tish less of the Balsamic vinegar, but otherwise did as recipe said. I think next time we'll grind up the rosemary & serve with linguini or spaghetti.

I was brain fried and needed a quick healthy dinner and this just nailed it. I substituted white balsamic and, for our palate, it was "just right". Served over fresh spinach and avocado.

Delicious! After reading reviews I reduced the balsamic vinegar to 1/3 cup and a little water and chicken bouillon paste. Only change I made. Hubby and I loved it and will make it again. Served with some linguine pasta.

I just wasn't all that jazzed about this recipe. I found the flavor of the balsamic to be overwhelmingly strong, so if I make this again, I'll definitely sub out some of that for chicken stock as others have suggested.

This was pretty tart for me. I added a little sugar at the end just to take away the bite. Can't ask for anything any easier though. Quick too. I noticed suggestions to use half balsamic vinegar and half chicken stock. I intend to try that next time.

I liked it!  I used a sweet balsamic and my kids thought it was too sweet, but I thought it was delicious.  I added it to a homemade sauce I had frozen and reheated and when it reduced, it was really tasty.  Easy recipe for a weeknight dinner and good for us too.  Thanks!

This was delicious and really easy to make!  I used half of a very large onion and one diced fresh tomato in place of the can but followed the recipe otherwise.  The Balsamic flavor is strong so don't make it if you don't like Balsamic vinegar!  I served it with yellow rice and fresh Tatziki.

Excellent! Delicious and hearty! I used regular salt instead of garlic salt, and added chopped garlic cloves along with the onions. The sauce was fabulous over spaghetti squash.  Will definitely make this again.

This wasn't my absolute favorite (not real big on chunky tomatoes and the balsamic was overpowering for me), but my husband liked it.  Next time I might cut back on the balsamic vinegar so it's a little less strong.

I loved this recipe and it was so simple! 
The only change I had was omitting the garlic salt and that was just because I didn't have any. It was delicious and just as good the next day reheated.

No rosemary and extra balsamic!  Added extra onion, minced garlic and criminis for the ckn cooking! Extra balsamic (1/4 c) and included the garlic salt in the herb mix and it was FABULOUS!  Wanted the ckn to be moist so I covered while I boiled down..... Perfect for husband and me. I'm doing Atkins and (skinny got pasta) husband is not! Served with fresh broccoli and it was amazing! Definitely amazing!!! Leftovers will be out of this world!

We really liked this ... I added fresh mushrooms because i'm addicted to the healthy mushroom! and also chopped garlic to saute the chicken with in addition to the garlic salt and pepper... I cut the chicken into cubes because its easier to eat and more flavorful. I cut the recipe in half but used a full can of chopped tomatoes with basil and garlic and oregano... then just added the rosemary and thyme. I served it over rice. I'm sure i'll make it again!

Made this recipe exactly as directed (except only used 4 chicken breasts) and my boyfriend and I both enjoyed it.  We ate it over white rice and had green beans on the side. I think next time I'll add less rosemary but that's just a personal preference.  I might also add a little chicken stock or just water to make a little more sauce. We will definitely be putting this dish in our normal rotation.

It was two to one in my house tonight.  Two seemed to like it and I was the one who didn't like it at all.  The flavors didn't' seem to mesh.  I love balsamic vinegar but this dish didn't do it for me.

So good!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful.  I served it with the Classic Rice Pilaf recipe from this site as well as some zucchini sauted in Italian dressing.  The only thing that would make this better is to serve it with a balsamic reduction sauce (I REALLY like balsamic, so that's just my opnion).  Will make again and again.

I love balsamic vinegar but didnt want it overpowering so as others suggested i cut the vinegar just a bit and added some chicken stock to it,, this was really really good,,, i did also dredge the chicken in flour since i like the way it will thicken the sauce a bit otherwise did the recipe exact and it was really really great, definitely would make this again,, simple,, one pan,, easy clean up too,, to go overboard with the balsamic i paired it with balsamic braised red cabbage,, great meal !!

I admit I did make some small changes.  I halved the recipe, lessened the balsamic vinegar, and mixed it with low sodium, low fat chicken broth.  I didn't really measure just went based on taste.  I also added about a tbsp of brown sugar to the mixture and used all of the other ingredients from the recipe.  I put it together with mashed potatoes and broccoli and it was absolutely phenomenal!  Very easy, quick, and tasty.  Thanks!

Totally overwhelms chicken/tastes more like a beef dish. Wish I'd halved the recipe so I didn't have all these leftovers. Also wish I could give it a negative star rating.

This was really delicious. I made it and let it sit in the sauce while I roasted potato cubes with olive oil, balsamic and rosemary. The flavor went all through the chicken and it was moist and flavorful and was great with the roasted potatoes. Tasted like something from a good Italian restaurant!

Excellent! Made as written except used a shallot in place of onion and fresh basil as it was on hand. I think the key to this recipe is using high quality balsamic vinegar - if at all tangy/tart then you used a poor quality. I served over mashed potatoes with steamed green beans.

Delicious! I love the tangy balsamic vinegar. They only change I made was to use 5 cloves of fresh garlic which I fried with the onions. Added the chicken to the pan a couple minutes after the onions and garlic were started. Served it on rice with steamed sugar peas.
Update: have made this several times now. Maybe my tastes have changed but I find it too vinegary so next time will cut vinegar in half and maybe replace with chicken stock or wine

Very easy, very tasty. I will cut back the amount of thyme I use. It was a little too much for my taste but overall a good dish.

OMG!! My husband & I cooked this tonight for dinner instead of ordering pizza on this snow day in from work!! It was absolutely amazing! He's a firefighter and at his first bite he stated that he was going to cook this at the station (yeah right ;) ). We thought the vinegar was very strong so we actually ended up only using about 4 tbsp. If that! It was perfect with brown rice & steamed broccoli.  We will definitely be having this again on our quest for healthier meals!!!

With all ingredients, even cutting down the recipe for smaller amt. of people it was an excellent dish. The flavor blended all very well.

This was...amazing! My husband was crazy about it and ate himself sick and even my kids loved it - of course they had to dip it in ranch but they dip everything in ranch! The only thing I did differently was I used about 3 tablespoons of italian seasoning just because I didn't have all of the spices in my cabinet and italian seasoning has most of them in it anyway.  It was also EXTREMELY easy and quick!

Loved the simple preparation, loved the bold flavor.  Didn't have diced tomatoes so used tomato sauce which worked out well for our family.  went well with our parmesan risotto.

Made this with stewed tomatoes with Italian seasoning and it turned out well too. :) We enjoyed the flavor...maybe less balsamic in the future...I think I put it more than 1/2 cup.  Ooops! :)

Very good. I cut recipe in half for just two. Only thing I would do different is have some good crunchy bread to dip in the sauce too. Fixed with fresh asparagus & buttered noodles. Will be fixing this one again.

Made this recipe last night it  was so refreshing and light . I only made a couple small changes  . First I sliced the chicken before I cooked it because I was putting it with spaghettini . I only have garlic powder in the house so I used that . I only had 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar so used chicken broth and added extra since I wanted lots of sauce for the spaghettini . It was great definitely will be making this again . Did the mixing of tomatoes, herbs and vinegar & broth in a bowl first like suggested by another review .

This turned out absolutely perfect!! I can't believe how easy it is and delicious.  It's also so readily adjustable to the number of people you're feeding.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Believe it or not it is actually better as left overs the next day.  Hard to believe but it is.

Made this last night, it was delicious.  I made it with orzo pasta and a side of green beans.  Added a small zucchini to the chicken, too.  I will definitely make it again.  Thank you. :o)

I thought this was allright. I saw it on a menu on the main page for daily meal plans at 1200 calories or less and decided to try it. I only had sweet pepper Italian chicken sausage, so I used that. One must really like balsamic vinegar to enjoy this, as that is the dominant taste. It is an acquired taste. The only other change I made was reducing the dried basil way back, as I don't care for it and shortening the cook time by 5 minutes due to using a pre-cooked chicken product.

This was FABULOUS!! I cubed the chicken, caramelized the onions, added one tablespoon of brown sugar and it was amazing. Would have been fantastic over angel hair pasta.

This dish was okay.  Mine didn't turn out very flavorful, but perhaps I didn't saute the onions for long enough.  I like balsamic vinegar, but I probably won't make this one again.

This tasted really nice.  I added the brown sugar as some other reviewers did.  The chicken was a little overcooked so I'll have to adjust the cooking time the next time I make it.

I recently found out that my daughter has a dairy protein allergy and being married to an Italian, it's been extremely hard to find good recipes. I made this tonight for my family of 5 and I wish I read the reviews prior with cutting down on the Balsamic as it was pretty strong but still very tasty. I did make some changes to our liking...instead of garlic salt, I used chopped fresh garlic and I seasoned the chicken with some seasoning instead of just pepper. I served the chicken with peas, corn, and mashed potatoes...everyone enjoyed this tasty meal. Next time, I will definitely be cutting down on the balsamic vinegar. Thanks for sharing!!

This recipe was very easy and very good. I added mushrooms and mixed greens (collards, turnips etc) and served it over polenta. Very good, healthy and filing dinner!

My entire family loved this! Even our 4 year old, who is very picky, said I did good. Our 1 year olds thought it was a little spicy, but that was my fault. The spice is dependant upon how much pepper you season the chicken with. Lol. I was also pleased that the "under 30 minutes" cliam held true. It will definately go into our recipe box!

Very tasty and super easy. I altered the recipe a bit for my, "we don't like chunky tomato dishes" family by using crushed tomatoes and dicing the onions. As others have suggested this recipe is excellent with a nice serving of steamed rice and veggies. My husband commented that he really liked the flavor twist from the balsamic vinegar.

It was delicious! Paired with steamed asparagus :) My hubby and my favorite part of the dish was the tomatoes (I prepared with a freshly cut tomato instead of canned).

Great! Serve with white bean puree. The flavors go really well together! Next time I will add some mushrooms to the chicken as well as a little brown sugar as others have said.

Pretty good. Definitely fast. I steamed broccoli and put the chicken over egg noodles. It was a little vinegary but I also wasn't sure if I was supposed to put the juice from the diced tomatoes in or not. I drained the tomatoes before adding them.

Followed recipe but replaced balsmic vinegar with red wine vinegar and sugar (1 tsp sugar to 1 tbsp red wine vinegar). Family loved it, lots of sauce and very easy to make.

One of my favorite recipes! Easy, healthy, and tasty! I add mushrooms. I also use a can of italian seasoned diced tomatoes instead of all the seasonings it calls for. Sometimes I sprinkle a bit of fresh grated parmesan cheese on top and serve with brown rice!

I doubled the recipe and used chicken wings.  It was awesome! My husband usually doesn't like tomato based recipes but the balsamic vinegar helped win him over.  Thanks for sharing what will be a family staple in my home.

This chicken was delicious. I wish I had bread to mop up the rest of the sauce!  I used fresh tomatoes from the garden instead of canned and fresh basil and thyme (doubled the called for dried amount). Used dried rosemary and omitted the oregano because I don't like it.
Will definitely make again!

This was easy and delicious!  I cubed the chicken and added mushrooms as well.  I halved balsamic and used chicken broth to bring liquid to 1/2 cup but next time using full 1/2 cup of balsamic.  Definitely more flavorful.  This recipe will be added to my recipe book.

Wow. This is now on our regular rotation. Used 4 large bone in breasts and browned on stovetop then braised for 30 min at 375 in oven.  Also added a couple garden tomatoes cause we're trying to use them up. It made an amazing sauce for angel hair pasta. I'm sure its good with boneless skinless as well but this was amazing!

This was incredible. We are thinking it should be a weekly dinner dish! The only change I made was that I had whole breasts instead of halves, so I doubled the sauce ingredients. But, I only had one can of tomatoes so I used one big fresh one that I diced and tossed that in the pan with the canned.

I made one small change.  I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  Other than that, my family enjoyed it!  My teenage son, who is an extremly picky eater, doesn't eat gravys, sauces or even tomatoes even loved it! This recipe will be added to my cycle of recipies!

This was good but not spectacular.  I'm trying to figure if it was because of me or that it just wasn't as great as I hoped it to be.  Next time I'll leave out the rosemary and thyme.

This is delicious! I made this amount of sauce for 2 breasts and served with angel hair pasta. I also added about 3/4 cup of julienne (sp?) carrots. It didn't add any flavor but had a nice texture and added a little more nutrition. I highly recommend this yummy recipe!

THIS WAS AMAZING!!!! I did add a few ingredients. I marinated all the ingredients, except for the olive oil, chicken, and onions in a bowl for about 4 hours.  I didn't have a can of diced tomatoes, so i cut up two softball sized tomatoes in chunks. I also added one small can of tomato paste to the marinade and 1 tsp of brown sugar. I didn't have rosemary, so I just omitted that.  I put the bowl of marinade in with the cooked chicken, olive oil, and onions. While the sauce and chicken were simmering, I added 1/4 cup of Holland House white cooking wine. The taste was so good, I had it for dinner the nest night!

Quick, easy, tasty! Perfect on a week night.  I marinated the chicken in the herbs with minced garlic and a spritz of lemon for about 30 mins while I sliced the onion and mushrooms I added and made rice and green bean to go with.

Absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe to the letter, (except I didn't have thyme!) and it came out perfect.

I made it with 3 chicken breasts, (and followed the original recipe for the sauce) and there was only just enough sauce for three, So I would definitely double the tomatoes and go half up on the balsamic and herbs if you are serving for 6 people, so there is plenty of sauce for everyone!

It was delicious with rice and green beans.

This was really good.  I accidentally bought diced tomatoes that were 'ready for chili' so they had some additional spices in it, but it still tasted great.  I made it for myself to eat through the week, and I would say I actually liked it better as a leftover.  The balsamic taste melded a bit more.  I also made it with chicken thighs in stead of breasts, just my preference for meat. It is definitely something that I would expect my French mother in law to make, and I will make it for my husband soon!  I also ate it with a few boiled/microwaved baby red potatoes instead of rice or pasta.  Quick and easy!

I thought this was OK.  Not one of our favorite meals.  Followed recipe except used garlic instead of garlic salt.  And cut balsamic in 1/2 and substituted chicken broth for the other 1/2.  It was tender.  But not a huge fan of the flavor.

Found this recipe to be one we wanted to make again. The first time, I used Italian seasoning in lieu of the separate herbs and finely-minced scallions in place of the onion. This time, we're making it with a locally-sourced Italian herb-infused olive oil and regular onions. Didn't change anything else. About the only tip I have is to brown the chicken breasts on med-high heat to sear them and retain juices, and drop the heat to medium or so to simmer with the liquid. Otherwise - this one's going in my permanent rotation. And I'm not even a big fan of Balsamic =)

Made exactly as described in original recipe, but added more seasoning than called for. Next time, I would slightly reduce the amount of balsamic vinegar. Even though I love the taste, it can be just a little overpowering in the dish. Served with mashed potatoes and a salad.

This was very good.  The chicken was tender and the sauce was great over rice.  We did not think that it was too acidic at all.  I used 1/3 cup of balsamic vinegar due to the reviews, but will use the entire 1/2 cup next time.  Buy good quality balsamic it does make a difference.

Made this the other day, but ate only as leftovers but still amazing! My boyfriend asked for seconds and was disappointed when I hadn't made enough for thirds! I used 1/2 raspberry and 1/2 pomegranate balsamic. I used red onion, and I also didn't have quite enough onion so added a little onion powder. The entire house smelled amazing! So good!

Love this recipe - super healthy unless you serve it over rice or pasta!  I did add some white wine and allow to reduce before adding the tomatoes.  Did the balsamic just to taste and not measured.  Used a large can of the diced tomatoes so that there would be more sauce for the rice.  Added a bay leaf and allowed to simmer in the juicy sauce for a long time.

The vinegar in addition to the tomatoes made this quite tangy, especially when eating the tomatoes and onions on their own. However, paired with the chicken it wasn't too overpowering. Next time I'm going to add peppers, add more spices, cut down on the balsamic a tad, and add some red pepper flakes for some heat. Great recipe though and not too difficult to make!

This was fantastic. The only changes I made was to use fresh minced garlic instead of garlic salt, and a heavy tablespoon of Italian seasoning instead of the separate spices, and about half a cup of caramelized diced onions (that I had leftover from making onion rolls). I served it over rice and steamed broccoli. I wish I had made more, there were no leftovers, and even my super picky nieces ate every bite. A definite keeper!

WOW....my lips puckered like a fish (so did my husbands) and I cut the balsamic in half per other reviews.  Word of warning....if you don't absolutly LOVE balsamic vinger do not make this.  This would have been great leaving out the vinegar and replacing it with say chicken broth.  Just warning ya....

Great! I cut up the chicken to help it cook faster and make it easier to serve to my kids. I tossed it with cooked thin spaghetti and completed the meal with a light salad.  Excellent recipe. Husband loved and 4 out of 5 kids liked it.  Can't get much better than that!

Fantastic!  Like others, I omitted the thyme (personal preference), and I used fresh diced tomatoes instead of canned.  It was delicious, and my family loved it.  Thanks!

This chicken was good, especially for as low-cal as it is.  I carmelized the onions first, and I only used 1/4 C balsamic vinegar and 1/4 C reduced-sodium chicken broth and it had a good balance.  Served over brown rice and I'm looking forward to leftovers tomorrow!

I didn't follow the recipe to a T because I read reviews and made adjustments - but maaan, this dish is so good I make it pretty regularly because it's so easy. First, I caramelize the onions in butter for about 15 minutes, adding brown sugar and ground black pepper the last 5 minutes.  Meanwhile, I have chicken marinated in balsamic vinegar (you don't have to, I just do to make it easier to throw together) - add the chicken in and then the tomatoes and basil.  I don't have the other spices, but it turns out fine.  I like how you really can't mess up this dish - sometimes I add chopped green onions to the mix, other times if I have some cilantro on hand, I throw it in.  It's also good with mushrooms, or without.  Good over rice or with some somen noodles.  Thanks!

I made this last night but didn't eat it until lunch time today. I chopped the onions only to realize that they should have been slicked and I left out the rosemary because I didn't have any and I used thighs instead of breast because I don't like breast meat. I am really happy with the results. It tastes really good and I will definately be making it again.

One of our favorites.  I cut the vinegar in half though because it is a little too strong for our taste.

Yum!  I just made this and my picky boyfriend loved it.  The breasts were not cooking, so I had to take it out halfway though and cut it into cubes.  Next time I will just do this from the start.  Also, I used fresh basil.

If I could give this more stars I would, it is one of THE BEST recipes I have tried recently.  We love chicken and eat it often, as I am always looking for different ways to fix it, I tried this and was NOT disappointed at all.  Great Flavor and marvelous combination of ingredients.  Will make this OFTEN!!!!

We did not care for this that much.  I love balsamic but this was just WAY to overpowering.  My daughter wouldn't even eat it after one bite, and I ate half.  Won't try again...

Well, it came out great, but since the author forgot to put the onion amount in the actual recipe I had to improvise, lol!  I just used one whole onion, sliced thin, and sauteed it with the chicken as it states in the direction. My family loved it!

I didn't make this recipe exactly as written as I made some changes after reading comments. Made with chicken stock and balsamic vinegar, added in some mushrooms and fresh garlic, and served over angel hair pasta. I also sprinkled some parmesan cheese over top and it was fabulous. I only gave 4 stars as I changed it to suit my family's needs. But it turned out so well that they all said I needed to make it again.

Great taste.  Only used 1/2 onion for kids but kept the vinegar at 1/2c.  Served over egg noodles.  Yum. We will be having this again.

I just made this and the only can of diced tomatoes I had in my pantry was the kind for chile...so I used it anyway and followed he rest of the recipe. It ws still yummy. probably would have been better without the chile flavor. I'll definitely try this one again.

My hubby loved this and said to add it to company menu!  I added lots of black pepper before browning the chicken.  Also added 1 large garlic clove minced with the onions.  Served w/ roasted zucchini and yellow squash and purple onions.

We served our chicken over rice and the chicken had a good taste but it tasted like something was missing.  There are only two of us so we had leftovers from the first night.  The second night we cut the chicken up in small pieces and added noodles.  AMAZING!!

It was good but I felt like it needed more flavor. I'm not sure what else I could have put in it as I added artichoke hearts as well as mushrooms (I think it could have had asparagus with it but it wouldn't have added to the flavor much). I topped the mixture on whole wheat spaghetti (I also cubed the chicken). Maybe I'm just one of those individuals who really needs a huge flavor difference than just it tasting mostly like chicken. Don't get me wrong, it is good though. I especially like that it is low calorie and low in fat.

I made it with white rice.

A favorite.

This was great!  The balsamic sweetened the dish and the chicken was moist as written.  Tried it again and was very pleased with the result.  Will keep.  No changes needed.  I made it for 4 and used 2 halves.

Family loved it!  I used sweet, ripe tomatoes and melted mozzarella cheese on top.  I was asked to double the sauce next time so I'll double the oil and vinegar and increase spices.  Also, added garlic.

Unless you love balsamic vinegar read the reviews first! I made this dish exactly like the recipe and probably should have read the reviews before I did so! It is very good and I will make it again but with less balsamic vinegar! I will do as one reviewer said and add a little chicken stock as well!

This dish came out fantastic!   I didn't change anything except for adding some garlic (I tend to add garlic to most everything).  Next time I plan to serve it over pasta.  Will definitely be making this again!  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent! Three kids, my husband, and myself all liked it. Made as written except cut the chicken into bite size pieces first, and simmered a little less time. Great flavor.

Chicken was good a bit dry. I added brown sugar and took a lot of people's suggestion to half the balsamic and add chicken broth. I would make it again, just probably cook it a little less longer because I did it 35 mins to try to make sure it cooked all the way through. Also, served it with macaroni.

This was delicious.  I used a combination of legs (6) and breasts (3).  I cut each breast into about 5 pieces and when it was about done, I cut those pieces into smaller, bite-sized pieces and let it simmer about 5 more minutes.  I used 2 cans of Italian flavored stewed tomatoes and a can of tomato sauce.  The sauce was a bit thin when it was done, so I added some flour to the mixture to thicken it up a bit and served it over angel hair pasta.  It was a hit with the entire family.

This was great - quick, easy, and tasty! 

All I used was chicken, olive oil, onion, balsamic vinegar, italian seasoned tomatoes and rather than garlic salt I used a dab of miced garlic. 

Super easy and very yummy!! 

I would recommend putting the onions in for a minute or so alone prior to adding chicken. Some of mine weren't cooked as well as the others.

My fiance and I loved this recipe!! I did make some changes to it as others had suggested. Otherwise it would've been a 5 star. Changes I made were: When browning the onions add fresh minced garlic instead of garlic salt, use only 1/4 C of balsamic, use 1/2 tsp of basil, oregano and rosemary and mix the spices and balsamic together before adding to the chicken. This is a definite keeper in the recipe book!! Enjoy! :)

I fixed this for dinner last night, and everyone loved it!  My teenage son ate seconds!  The only changes that I made is that I didn't measure the garlic salt when I seasoned the chicken breasts and I covered it when I simmered all the ingredients.

I like balsamic flavor but this is crazy!  Way too soupy and I even added 2 servings of brown rice to it and it was still soupy.  It doesn't have enough ingredients.  It was just weird.

Really tasty dish.  I used a nice balsamic that a friend left (thank you Annie), and it was fantastic.  I sauteed the onions first and set them aside after a mild carmelization.  Then, after tenderizing my 3 large chicken breasts, browned those independently cooking about 2/3 through.  After that, added back the onions and added the rest of the ingredients (subbing Homemade Italian Season I from allrecipes for the independent spices) and let it stew.  The outer portion of the chicken absorbed the wet ingredients beautifully, so with the two extra breasts (I'm a bachelor), I chopped the remaining chicken and added it back, and am certain tomorrow will provide proof of tonight's happy marriage.

I loved this recipe! Although, I did tone down on the balsamic vinegar and added fresh garlic. My husband loves spice, so I added about 2 tsp of crushed red pepper. I served it over angel hair pasta. Delicious! Thank you! :)

This recipe was easy and turned out great! The chicken was really moist.  It was the perfect weekday dinner, easy, quick and tasty! I substituted spaghetti sauce for diced tomatoes (only because I didn't have any) and then used less of the required spices, but it was still incredible.  My husband loved it!

YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY!  I used 2 onions, only because I LOVE onions. I also used italian seasoning instead of the individual seasonings.  Came together super quick.  Was a hit for dinner.  Will definately be making it again!

AMAZING! I cut the recipe to make for two using diced tomatoes with garlic, basil and oregeno flavor and used red onion instead. Absolutely DELISH and I'm not a huge vinegar lover. SUPER easy too!

I just made this tonight.  It is easy! My husband is not a sour, tangy, vinegar kind of guy so I added 2 TBSP of sugar.  I also added a heaping handful of fresh spinach during the braising.  The flavor is robust and I served this all over brown rice.  This dish has a nice presentation too!  Next time I make this, I will thinly slice 2 cloves of garlic and brown with the onions instead of using garlic salt.

Loved it!  This ones a keeper.  My husband and kids don't like balsamic vinegar,  I had a bottle of balsamic cream that I used instead.  Didn't measure just drizzled over the top.

Wasn't a huge fan. This is not a bad dish it just has WAY to much going on flavor wise. Very strong spices and the vinegar is a bit over powering. I guess I'd just recommend using a tad less of what's posted. I probably won't make this again tho. On the bright side it did turn out picture perfect ;0)

loved the taste of the balsamic vinegar mixed with the diced tomatoes.  The herbs gave it a wonderful, fresh flavor.  Even my meat and potatoes loving husband enjoyed it. :)

Loved this recipe! Per others suggestions I used 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar and 1/4 cup chicken broth instead of just the vinegar.  It still had plenty of balsamic taste.  Other than that followed the recipe exactly.  I usually dont like tomatoes, but I loved these. I even used just the tomatoes over rice the next day for lunch.  Graet healthy recipe, low on weight watchers points plus points.  This is a keeper!

This was absolutely mouthwatering.  I used the whole amount of balsamic the recipe calls for and it was definitely not overpowering.  Just wish I could afford a really old expensive balsamic and give it a try.  mmmmmmm good.  we will definitely be having this again.

This was superb.  I cooked according to directions, except that I liberally added garlic salt instead of just one tsp.  And I let it simmer on low about an hour.  My family loved it!

It was okay, but a little too sour.  Maybe you should use a little less of the vinegar.

GREAT!!!! I used a 28oz can of diced tomatoes instead of 14 oz because thats what I had. Instead of garlic salt I added fresh garlic. I didn't use rosemary because my husband hates it.  It turned out awesome!

Just made this for dinner.  Took other reviews advice; added brown sugar to cut the acidic vinegar, just a tad.  Mixed herbs with vinegar and tomatoes.  Cubed chicken prior to cooking.  Served over angel hair pasta.  Yuuummm. Will make again!  Thanks for sharing.

Pretty good added fresh garlIc crushed red pepper and mushrooms still a little bland though. Served over pasta will probably make again but add more flavor.

Good staple recipe, very easy.  I used chicken tenders instead and served with couscous.  As another reviewer noted, the directions should state to brown the onion before cooking the chicken; also, the spices should be mixed together with the tomatoes before adding.

We love balsamic vinegar.  I cut it down to 1/3 cup and thought it was still too strong.  Maybe adding a little sugar would help.  My husband liked it anyway!

This recipe is really yummy, I had to add a little salt, pepper, onion and garlic powder to the sauce to give it an extra kick. Added egg noddles to the pot so they soaked up the extra juices and I am telling you it was superb, will try this again with chicken thighs as my breasts dried out a bit (probably my fault though). Also, I browned all the chicken first this added the onions to the leftover juices and browned them then added the chicken back in layering the onions in between them. Perfecto!

I've made this several times now and love it each time! I have sauteed fresh chopped eggplant and zucchinni (tis the season) with onion... I've thrown in fresh garlic and tons of fresh chopped herbs (basil- lots of rosemary - thyme - oregano). If you add another can or tomatoes (w/a bit of water to thin it) you can get enough sauce to put it over angel hair pasta... some crusty bread and salad and you have a gourmet dinner!  I love it with garlic mashed and sauteed green beans.  I've made a lot for company too... just caramelize your onions - pan sear your chicken - then layer it in a large rectangle baking dish... mix up the tomato mixture and pour it over... top it with foil and put it in over for a half hour on 350.  Possibilities are endless : ) Thanks so much for this awesome recipe!

I drained off some liquid from the diced tomatoes.  Went easy on the balsamic vinegar (just a few splashes). And added more garlic powder.  Very tasty.

Great recipe! I planned to serve over penne pasta and wanted more liquid. To achieve this I increased to two cans of tomatoes and increased the herbs proportionally. Used red onion as that was what I had on hand. This recipe has a kind of mediterranean taste. Next time I may add black olives and top with a little feta. Yum!

Like that it is an easy and fast recipe.  1/2 cup of balsamic vinegar is way too much.  I used 1/4 cup and would probably use even less next time.  Cubed the chicken and added cremini mushrooms.  Served with spaghetti and fresh parmesan cheese.  Not my favorite but a nice option.

Absolutely delicious! The chicken was so juicy and flavorful, and it was so easy to make! I was a little worried after reading some other reviews that the balsamic might be a little strong, but I had a good quality brand and it was perfect. The only thing I might change in the future is halving the amount of rosemary, but that is simply a personal preference as I find it can be an aggressive herb. Overall, a wonderful and simple dish.

Too acidic for my taste and didn't really like the combination of seasonings.  Family was not impressed.  I will try again, but reduce the amount of vinegar I use.

Made this last night for dinner. I made it as directed, cooked for about 35 min, my boyfriend and I thought the vinegar was just way too strong, I even used a high quality vinegar. He will eat just about anything, and he wouldn't even finish his plate :( Probably will try again with a few changes, I suggest cutting back on the vinegar to 1/3 cup and letting it cook for at least an hour or more to cook out some of the vinegar taste.

I made this last night and really enjoyed it. I did make a few changes due to what I had on hand;I used boneless skinless thighs. I put the ingredients in the slowcooker adding a red and green pepper (diced). The chicken was frozen so I cooked it on low for 8 hours. I will double the sauce next time. Delicious and easy.

I made this dish for dinner tonight. I made a few adjustments after reading some of the other reviews. Even though I used a quality balsamic vinger, I only used 1/3 cup. I added frozen carrots to the onions. Used whole garlic and seasoned the chicken wih half the herds and black pepper(no salt) for 30 min.  before braising. I paired it with roasted rosemary potatoes and green beans. Think I will add this to my recipe box!

This is delicious!  I used a whole cut up chicken since that is what I had on hand.  I simmered it very gently for about an hour, maybe an hour and a half.  I think the key to this recipe is to use a really good balsamic vinegar.  The tomatoes were sweet and delicious!  I took the chicken from the bone when it was finished and served it over rice.  So easy and wonderful!

My "go to meal" whenever I want to impress with not much work- lots of flavor for not to much work- I pound out the chicken for less cook time and I would double the sauce when pairing with pasta!

I really liked this recipe. I only needed one piece of chicken so I modified the measurements. Flavor was good. I used fresh basil bc I love it.  I also added a couple of slices of a red pepper. I wish I had made a little more sauce to mix with my pasta. Flavor was  delicious though.

Fiance rated this a solid 8, maybe even a 9. Simple, quick, and so tasty. The chicken stayed very moist. I followed this recipe exactly except I used 2 cloves of real garlic instead of garlic salt. The spices are what made this dish awesome. Next time might try to cube the chicken and then serve the whole thing over rice for an asian flare. Yum!

This has become one of my favorite dishes in the house! The balsamic is pretty tangy, so to sweeten it up a bit, I use two onions and once they caramelize, it sweetens up quite nicely. Slice them THIN though, it looks better and cooks up quicker.

Absolutely delicious! It was very easy to make, and even my boyfriend, a picky eater, was trying to steal bites off of my plate. After only making it once, it has very likely become my favorite dish.

This has become a regular in my house. I do cook the chicken longer because unless pounded down, the breasts need more cooking time. Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing. Just one recommendation - use a really good balsamic vinegar. This is a keeper!

I'm giving this recipe 3 star or 6/10 because the chicken, although was very tender did not absorb any of the flavor from the sauce.  The chicken was actually pretty bland.  Not something I will make again.

This was great! I cut the balsamic like many suggested, I just used 1/3 of a cup but i used two cans of tomatoes to make extra sauce.  I also used fresh rosemary and basil.  The boneless breast comes out unbelievably juicy and tender after only 15 min of simmering.  This is a winner and will be made often in my house.  But as others stated if you don't like balsamic then this isn't for you.

Pretty good, but all the flavor was in the liquid!  My chicken only had flavor in the part that was submerged.  I will make it again but will probably change the technique a bit.  I used fresh garlic in place of the garlic salt, added with the tomatoes & balsamic.  It WAS ready very fast which was awesome! :)

I LOVE THIS RECIPE. SO SIMPLE AND GOOD ANYTIME. GREAT FOR COMPANY... IMPRESSIVE. I ALSO MADE A "MEXICAN" VARIATION USING A MEXICAN RECIPE OF CANNED TOMATOES & ALONG WITH A CAN OF "ROTEL" & USED CUMIN & OF COURSE LEAVING OUT THE ITALIAN SPICES & BALSAMIC VINAGRETTE.

Not to hard and o-so-good. Like other reviewers, I only used 1/4 c balsamic vinigar and fresh herbs from my garden. The taste was very nice, not to strong. Will make again! I served it with kinoa - a fun substitute for rice/pasta.

Sorry, but we didn't like this recipe.  The ingredients sounded great, but even with extra garlic, it lacked in flavor.  Also, the "sauce" wasn't thick enough to coat the chicken which didn't adhere to pasta and was too liquidy to serve over the chicken alone.  I won't make this again.

Awesome!  It has become one of our family favorites.  The kids like it better without the tomatoes.  I simmer it a bit longer to carmelize the onions and thicken the sauce.  Served with jasmine rice and green beans.  Love it!!!!

I used actual garlic and salt and served over couscous. IT WAS AMAZING! And subtly sweet with a Moroccan twist.  I may have added a little more balsamic vinegar and really let it sit on the stove to thicken up. a great meal!

It was very easy to prepare and tasty.  I listened to the balsamic suggestions, but shouldn't have.  Next time I will use the full amount and see if that makes it five stars.

As other reviewers mentioned, I added a few things to this recipe. First, I only used 3 chicken breats and cut them into chunks. I browned them first then added the onions until carmelized, then added sliced fresh buttom mushrooms until they were brown, then a large clove of minced garlic. At that point, I added the tomatoes, balsamic (excellent quality, thick and sweet), a little chicken stock, the herbs, and a can of baby artichoke hearts. I let it simmer covered for about 20 minutes then served over angel hair pasta and topped it with fresh grated parmessan. You'd think it would be amazing but to me and my husband something seemed like it was missing and it wasn't out of the ballpark like I thought it would be. The next day, leftovers were a little better but overall it's probably not a dish I'll make again.

This was absolutely delicious. I replaced the garlic salt with a fresh clove, cutting out some of the sodium. The tomatoes take on a wonderful flavor, and the chicken stays nice and tender. Will be making this again very soon.

Great dish and great flavor. I didn't have any rosemary and it still turned out great. Used fresh basil and added it at the very end. So tasty! The sauce is pretty loose but it stayed with the pasta pretty well.

great recipe! I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned ones...I also added a tad of corn starch at the end to thicken the sauce up a little. This recipe makes A LOT of sauce though... I would definitely add extra veggies while it simmers so it can soak some of the sauce up, like bell peppers, mushrooms, onions.

This dish was AMAZING. I don't think I have ever had chicken so moist in my life!  I like to eat healthy and I asked my husband to cook a healthy dinner. He found this recipe and himself too was amazed at how delicious it was. We served it with sauteed vegetables and it was a hit. This is a keeper in my recipe book :)

This dish can easily be made into a meal all by itself. I have fixed this for my boyfriend and myself several times. To turn it into an entire meal I first cut two organic chicken breasts into bite size pieces, then cook them with half a sliced onion, minced garlic and a cup of sliced portabella mushrooms. I then add in an entire can of organic diced tomatoes, the balsamic and seasonings. Super low calorie and full of veggies and protein! I serve this with a side of steamed green beans. Less than 500 calories per serving and DELICIOUS!

I loved this! I couldn't get enough of it. I honestly literally drank the remaining sauce when I had eaten all the chicken and pasta. I served this over some multigrain angel hair pasta and steamed squash. The chicken was very moist, tender and flavorful.

This was very tasty and so easy to make.  I was worried the balsamic would be too strong, but it wasn't at all.  I cut up the chicken before cooking to make sort of a stir fry and cooked the onions until tender and clear.  We had this with a side of mashed potatoes, but next time will try rice or maybe egg noodles.  Very yummy!

Pretty  good! I've made this twice, and both times I doubled everything but the chicken. (I use fresh garlic) The second time, I also added 1/2C of chicken broth (with some corn starch) and it was FABULOUS! Not quite as much bite, and the corn starch helped thicken the sauce a bit. The second time I also sliced the chicken into strips, and will do so again in the future. This recipe is a keeper, and I hope to try it this summer with fresh herbs. Also, I've tried it with both rice & egg noodles - rice was better.

Good.  Everyone ate it but no one really said anything.  I thought it had too strong of a vinegar taste.  Won't make again.

Great recipe for the time when you are down on ingridients. Very easy and quick. Hubsand was satisfied, and so were my tastebuds. I did cut on balsamic vinegar and added some brown sugar, per other reviewers' suggestions. Next time I might try it with the full amount of vinegar suggested.

1/2 the balsamic vinegar.  I used 20 year aged organic balsamic vinegar that's awesome in salad dressing but was over powering in this until I doubled the tomates, garlic and spices to balance out the vinegar.  Otherwise good recipe.

Healthy and delicious.  I used 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar and 1/2 cup low-sodium broth because I wanted extra sauce to toss into pasta.  I added bell peppers and mushrooms and cannot imgaine without.  Served over a bed of bow tie pasta for a nice presentation.  My friend and I had the leftovers as a warm sandwich on toasted rustic bread spread with just a little olive oil and garlic,  provolone cheese and tossed the veggies and some of the sauce (warmed) with mixed greens to top off. It made a tasty sandwich too.

I thought marinating the chicken before I went to work, in the balsamic and herbs would make the chicken extra tasty.  However it may have made the taste too strong!  Being a beginner cook, I also overcooked the chicken so that probably didn't help the dish!  :s

Not only did this taste good, it smelled amazing!  Hubs and I love balsamic, so used the full amount.  We did find the chicken to be a little bland on the inside, so I may cut it into pieces next time.  Other than that, absolutely wonderful!  Served with angel hair pasta to soak up the sauce and tomatoes.

Not bad, definitely an easy dish to put together. Besides splitting the balsamic with chicken broth, I followed the recipe exactly. My husband loved this as did the 1yo. I thought the chicken could have had more flavor so I'll try browning the chicken more. I mixed everything from the balsamic through herbs together first (easy step, suggested by others). Given the "5 stars" from my husband I'll probably make this again. Hubz also suggested letting the dish sit for a while after cooking. Maybe next time I can wait :)

My fiance and I loved this recipe!  We also loved how quick and easy it was to make.  We used fire-roasted diced tomatoes which gave the sauce a great boost in flavor.  Definitely need to use a good balsamic.  We served it in a bowl with a side of french bread that we dipped in the sauce (so yummy)!  Will make it with rice or quinoa next time.

WOW!!! Made this for dinner tonight and it is REALLY good. I cut the chicken into chunks, using pepper and garlic powder for seasoning. The only thing I did different was add an additional can of tomatoes since we love extra sauce. SUPER YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Good, but not the flavor I hoped for. I thought I had good quality Balsamic but maybe not. The Balsalmic was the only taste and without it I don't think there would have been any flavor. I will try again.

If you are looking for a recipe that is super easy yet looks and tastes like it was prepared by a pro, this is it.  This is sure to be a smashing success with your special dinner guests AND received a golden seal of approval from our 6 yo who is one of the pickiest eaters.  Definitely a 5 star meal.  I always have fresh basil on hand so I used them instead of dry.  It added a wonderful aroma to already a delicious sauce. I served it with penne pasta and top it off with some Parmesan cheese.  Yum!!

My husband and I LOVED THIS! I am looking forward to my left over piece for lunch! :)  I made mine with mushrooms, yummy! But other than that, I didn't change a thing.  And it only took about 10 minutes or so total to cook.  Served over whole wheat speghetti with a ceasar salad on the side.

this was very, very good- however, i recognize it probably depends on personal taste. that said, i added mushrooms and artichoke hearts, and used fire roasted tomato sauce. served over polenta with asparagus. will make again.

This was very good and my wife and I enjoyed it immensely.  I substituted Red Wine vinegar because I didn't have any balsamic on hand.  I also used tomatoes that my wife canned last fall which were more stewed than diced.  Other than those changes, I followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks for a great dinner!

I think this is a pretty good recipe. I prepared as written and agree with others that the vinegar is a bit overpowering. I'm going to make again and experiment a little with less vinegar and add chicken broth, maybe some brown sugar. I think it is fantastic as a low cal/low fat recipe. Tons of potential, I know many liked as written, just a little strong on the vinegar for me.

I make this recipe as written and it's perfect.  This is in my regular rotation of weeknight dinners.  Cooks quickly, little mess, almost zero prep-work and it tastes delicious.  The balsamic flavor really absorbs into the chicken and the tomatoes add a little bit of sweetness.  I like to serve this with green beans and some bread or rice for a simple, light meal.

Delicious!  Easy to make and full of flavor.  The only changes I made were using three chicken breasts that I cut up into large pieces (I didn't realize until I was cooking that it called for six) and garlic powder instead of garlic salt, personal preference.  Served over rice but will try with polenta next time. Thanks for this recipe!

I absolutely loved this dish.  It is very easy to make.  I added sone sliced mushrooms and minced garlic with the onions and it was delicious.  I served it over angel hair pasta with roasted asparagus.  My wife could not get enough of this.

Yum! I really liked this one a lot! And it is pretty quick too! I subbed pearl onions for the onion slices because... well I had some left over pearl onions. I also added a 1/4 or so of dry sherry because... well I had some open Sherry. Finally, I removed the chicken and reduced the sauce a bit because... well I had some time. Oh, I used thighs instead of breasts because.. well you get the idea!  Thanks for a great dinner! Cheers!

I had to do a few alterations to make this dish tasty.  I cubed only 4 chicken breasts and seasoned it with salt, pepper and garlic powder. I also added fresh minced garlic and had to add chicken base for more flavor. I also only added 1/4c balsamic because it was getting too tart and tangy.

I used newmans light balsalmic vinergerette and 1 tlb of olive oil with lotsa fresh garlic.  I  assumed the chicken breast was 4 oz.  WHY don't people include meat weight in there recipes (1 star off!) Chicken was yummy.  I'll be cooking this again!

Delicious...nice and juicy.  I'm a very picky eater and not a big fan of tomatoes but followed the recipe anyway.  Loved it even with the tomato taste...mmm!  Wasn't over-powering but instead gave it a nice flavor.

I'd rate this as a successful experiment but not an immediate keeper as I found several changes that I will make in future. Firstly, there was far too much chicken in relation to the vegetables. Secondly the serving amount was it was huge - far too much for two people. Next time I'll cut down on the chicken and add more vegetables and we'll see how it goes. Thanks for the recipe!

Wow, this was delicious!  Used tenders to save time.  Used sherry wine vinegar rather than balsamic.  And used 1C chicken broth rather than the diced tomatoes (relentless children who believe tomato must be pureed to be edible).  I made a lot, thinking the leftovers would make a great chicken salad.  I still think so, but I'll have to wait until next time to try because the chicken totally disappeared.  And hubby spooned the leftover sauce over his baked potato.  Thanks, MoonAndBack!

Loved it!  My three year old actually asked for more - this never happens.  It's still a hit - I've learned this cooks best in my cast iron skillet (so I can get it to a medium/high heat when initially braising the chicken) and I also cut the chicken into medallions so they absorb more of the balsamic vinegar and seasoning flavor.  It cooks more quickly too.  I definitely took another reviewers suggestion about adding just a pinch of brown sugar to the mix to reduce the bite of the vinegar - it makes it delicious!

Made this dish last night and it was delicious.  The taste was a bit different from what we eat on a regular, but my husband and 8yr son really enjoyed it. I did tweak it tad.  I decreased the balsamic vinegar and added a teaspoon of flour and water to thicken sauce a bit. I love to try new dishes and this one's a keeper.  I will definitely make this one again.

this was wonderful!  My husband & I are dieting, and always on the lookout for chicken recipes with a lot of flavor--no added fat, sugar, etc.  We did find it slightly acidic, so if not for the diet, probably would add some brown sugar or honey.

I'd just bought a 25 year old balsamic vinegar & was looking for a dish to make with it. This was quick, easy & a hit! :) (the only things I did differently was to pass on the onions and use Italian seasoning instead of individual ones).

My hubby and I think this was one of the best and most easiest meals to make being we both work.  He thinks maybe thinner chicken cutlets next time but i enjoyed it as is!!  Maybe i'll cube the chicken and put over pasta next time, another good idea!!

Very good. Next time I will double the tomatoes and onion and the balsamic sauce, it's wonderful over rice. If you don't eat the tomatoes and onions with the chicken you might find it now wowing in flavor, but if you get some of the tomato onion mixture in the same bite as the chicken it is unbelievable. No one else in my family would eat the tomato/onion mixture so were not impressed, but I did and I was. Goes great on top of a salad the next day or as the chicken in Catherine's Spicy Chicken Soup recipe from this site.

This recipe was fantastic.  My husband actually found it and wanted me to give it a try (trying to eat healthier).  Needless to say, it was very delicious.  We were even more shocked at how much more flavorful it was the 2nd day.  This is a recipe you can make the night before if you are expecting company and just warm up and add your sides....wam bam...thank you maam.  You are ready to eat.  This will be a regular visitor to our dinner table.

I really liked this recipe, I followed another suggestion and prepared in my crockpot.  When I came home from work, the house smelled wonderful. I microwaved a couple of baked potatoes and sauteed some zucchini in a little bit of garlic salt and pepper to serve alongside.  Meanwhile, I  added some cornstarch to thicken the sauce in the crockpot and served over the baked potatoes. Delicious.  My husband wasn't crazy about it, but my daughter-in-law and I really liked it.  Next time I think I'll add some mushrooms too!

Excellent Recipe!  Very east to make and so yummy!  I made this one night after work.  By the time I made the seasoned rice, cooked the sugar snap peas, and set the table, the chicken was done.  All in 35 minutes... start to finish!  Now that's my kind of recipe!!!

This was delicious! My whole family approved!!  The only tweeks I made were, I only had canned tomatoes with the garlic, basil, oregano already in it and I cut my chicken into strips to make it go longer!  Very flavorful and low calories!!!

A really good and easy basic dish.  I cut the chicken breasts up into fairly small cubes.  I served mine over bow tie pasta that had been drizzled with italian dressing.  Very tasty.

This was really good and really fast.  I used the canned italian seasoned tomato and half the vinegar in the recipe with the other half as chicken broth.  Healthy, fast and yummy.

I hate to give this recipe 2 stars, but I did not care of it.  I followed the recipe as stated except I used some fresh ingredients such as; fresh tomatoes, rosemary and thyme.  I imagine that if I used expensive balsamic it may have tasted better, but I can't imagine liking it 100% more.  Will definately not make it again.

I liked the idea and taste of this dish... but it needs some work. The sauce is VERY thin, but to cook it any longer would dry out the chicken, so something needs some changing. I, like many of the suggestions, cut the vinegar in half and added some chicken borth to cut down on the acidity and I think this made a nice flavor. It went well over pasta and I steamed some green beans and threw them into the mix, which was nice. As I said, I really liked the flavor but something needs to be changed about the cooking method...

This dish was so tasty. I took reviewer's advice by adding half the portion of balsamic vinegar and half chicken stock (to avoid the tangy taste). I also added mushrooms in the beginning with the garlic, and added some sherry cooking wine. Soooo good!

We really enjoyed this!  Used 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar and 1/4 cup of chicken broth as others suggested.  And fresh garlic instead of garlic salt.  Served with buttered egg noodles and fresh asparagus.  Will be making this again for sure!!

I had just made this a couple nights ago and it turned out really great.  I used about 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar and 1/4 cup chicken stock.  It had great flavor throughout.  I let it simmer quite a bit longer than it suggests, and when the sauce started getting a little to thick, i just added some water here and there.

I made this recipe as is and agree with the other reviewers that the vinegar taste is a bit tangy, espeically in the tomatoes.  Next time, I plan to caramelize the onions a bit and use less vinegar.

I love balsamic vinegar & strong flavor, but unless I messed up measuring something,I'm tempted to try it again to see if I did something wrong the first time because all of the other reviews were pretty good.

Simple with a sophisticated taste, and good for you too.  What's not to love?  You must use a good brand of balsamic vinegar or it may be bitter.  I used the full amount of vinegar and even my kids loved it (but they woudn't have eaten it if I told them vinegar was in the dish).  I would serve this to guests, and that's saying alot.

Nothing spectacular. I made with an expensive  balsamic vinegar 1/2 cup as listed in recipe. I only added 1/2 the amount of spices as listed in the recipe due to many people saying it was too strong. It was okay but not worth the time to make again.

We enjoyed it, even the 3 year old. Ok, the 2 year old wouldn't touch it, but I don't think that was the chicken's fault! We had lots of sauce, and the tomatoes were an absolutely fabulous addition (we used garden fresh ones). As per other reviews, I added garlic. Didn't have tyme, but was fine anyway. Served it with new potatoes and green beans. As leftovers, I mixed in the green beans and loved it. The sauce is really good!

I changed up the recipe slightly, using minced garlic and salt rather than garlic salt, I also used Garlic and Onion diced tomatoes.  The chicken was tender and juicy.  I found the 1/2 cup of Balsamic slightly overpowering and would try it again with a little less.  Overall a delicious and healthy recipe.

I LOVED this!!  It was so delicious!!  I only used 1/4 of a cup of balsamic vinegar, substituting the other 1/4 cup with chicken broth.  I cubed my chicken, and used petite diced tomatoes w/ sweet onions.  I served with whole grain brown rice I had cooked w/ the leftover chicken broth.  It was so, so good.  I'm not a big fan of balsamic vinegar, and I've never cooked with it, so I was skeptical that I would enjoy this dish, but I did.  My husband and 2 picky kids loved it as well!!  Great recipe, I will definitely be cooking this in the future!!

Hubby said if they sold this at a restruant he would buy it! He really liked it. I carmelized the onions w/ a bit of brown sugar and used a mixture of balsamic vinegrette dressing and some white wine vinegar b/c that's what I had. We had it with spaghetti noodles.

I don't typically review recipes, but I have to give a shout out for this one.  My family loved it.  Perfect recipe: Healthy, quick and easy! My dh and I both took leftovers for lunch the next day and I think it was even better. Made the recipe as written, but did pound the breasts to even them out.   Thanks so much!

Oh wow, where to begin?! This was amazing - quick and easy, the chicken was very juicy, the flavor was to-die-for, and the ingredients were inexpensive. I used Colavita sweet balsamic vinegar, by the way. And, since I made this in the middle of summer, canned tomatoes was not an option! I used several fresh roma tomatoes instead. I served this with asparagus and fresh corn on the cob for a super healthy and flavorful dish. I will make this over and over again!

Delicious, and the best part is, this dinner was SO easy to make! My husband liked it a lot. He had his over some angel hair pasta and I had mine over some leftover jasmine rice (my favorite). I used 2 cloves of fresh garlic along with the garlic salt (we are garlic fans around here). I also only used one large chicken breast half, cut into strips before cooking. Also added a pinch of brown sugar to cut down on the tartness, and only 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar, per the other reviewers suggestions. Excellent, easy dinner, perfect enough for a weeknight but good enough to serve to company, too.

This was a great recipe! I added some portabello mushrooms and put it in the oven at 230 degrees for a couple of hours after I finished preparing it(we couldn't eat it right away). It was really tender and had a wonderful flavor. My husband was impressed! Will definately make again.

I LOVED this dish!!  I used 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar and it was still extremely flavorful. I also added mushrooms and carrots while cooking the onion, and it really added to the dish.  Overall, great recipe!

I thought this was pretty good. It would be really good over angel hair pasta. I did change the recipe a little bit, I used 1/4 c. balsamic and 1/4 c. chicken broth because I didn't want a strong vinegar taste. I also cut the chicken into chunks before cooking it and used canned tomatoes that were pre-flavored with basil, oregano, and something else that I can't remember. I think it turned out great, not too strong of a flavor but enough to make it not bland.

Very tasty, if you're a fan of balsalmic vinegar (otherwise why would you make this?).  I thought the chicken stayed nice and juicy, and the sauce was very flavorful.

This was a good recipe. I pretty much followed the recipe except for adding some mushrooms, and using fresh minced garlic instead of garlic salt. And I ended up cutting the chicken in smaller peices. I made some white rice and poured the whole thing on top. I only wish that it was more saucy. Next time I will add more Balsamic. Other than that it was really good!

OMG!  Loved it.  My husband and I are not tomato people, but we loved it.  I did not use the rosmary because I couldn't find it, but the recipe was amazing.  Nice taste.  Tomatoes did not overwhelm the sauce.

I made this last night at the last minute after arriving home with no plan for dinner.  It was super easy, tasted wonderful and is healthy.  What more can you ask for in a recipe.  I made it exactly as directed, except I used the diced tomatoes already seasoned with basil, oregano and garlic, because that's all I had in the pantry.  I still added the spices as the recipe says and it definitely was not too much.  It was delicious and will be made many times again in my house.  It is also very pretty and could easily be served to company.

This is the only way my 10 year old will eat chicken breast.  I blended advice from several reviewers to make this more kid friendly.  I cut the chicken into chunks to make it easier to eat and allow people more flexible serving sizes.  I cut out the recommended spices and used Italian tomatoes and 3 cloves of crushed garlic.  I used only 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar and added 1/4 cup chicken broth.  I also covered the pan for half the cooking time to assure all of the chicken was cooked.  I served this over brown rice for some and pasta for others along with roasted asparagus and salad.  This was a super easy week day meal that I will definitely serve again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I followed some of the other reviewers and put in less balsamic- about 1/2 as much.  I also cut the chicken into 1" cubes before I put it in with the onions.  I served it over rice.  I would make it again- very easy, not wow but everyone liked it.

Very easy, very delicious! Definitely use real garlic though; no powder. It definitely seems like a recipe that's easy to add or subtract to in order to suit differing tastes.

This was awesome!  I did cut back on the herbs a little.  We're already thinking of different variations of this dish, like doubling the sauce and serving over fettucini.  Will definately be making this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I liked this more than my hubby, he just doesn't like cooked tomatoes and onions much, but he really like the chicken flavor as did I. I cubed the chicken and served it over brown rice. Next time I would add a clove or two of minced garlic in lieu of the garlic salt. I think it was the rosemary that made the dish. I left out the thyme as I didn't have any. I really appreciate dishes like this that are low in fat, but you don't miss the fat.

This chicken was wonderful!  I like how the balsamic really seeps into the chicken and flavors it nicely.  Really easy to make as well.

This was really easy and pretty tasty. It had a lot of flavor but I feel like it needed depth to it, it was sort of a one-note dish. My husband liked it and I would make it again for its ease but it wasn't a real stunner, stand-out dish.

I halved this recipe since I'm only feeding my husband and daughter.  After reducing the serving number, I did the following: used only 3 chicken breasts, sliced them into strips, used the whole can of diced tomatoes instead of the 2/3 it listed, and upped to herbs slightly to counteract the extra tomato.  I enjoyed it.  My husband didn't like the chicken but that's only because it's breast meat.  I'll make it again the same way and use dark meat instead.

Fantastic! We wish we would have NOT used chicken stock to muddle the flavor of the vinegar. We didn't use mushrooms but it was still divine!!!!! Awesome!

Love love love!!  Cut chicken into bite-size pieces, doubled the sauce (added about 1/4 jar of leftover marina sauce from the fridge - had to get rid of it), and put it over angel hair pasta.  It almost tastes like a really exotic tomato sauce.  We're balsamic lovers in my house, so the ratio seemed fine!

This was a good recipe. I added an extra can of tomatoes to make more sauce. I had to cook my chicken longer because I used thick breasts. The only other thing I did differently was add about 2 tablespoons of cornstarch mixed with cold water to thicken the sauce. My family loved this served over angel hair pasta. This was a quick and easy recipe.

Enjoyed the recipe; used half balsamic vinegar and half chicken stock like others suggested.  Added mushroom and onion when braising chicken.  Ended up cutting the chicken breast in half.  Other than that, I'll probably make again.

I give this a 5 because the flavors are very good together- I would rate it lower because I overcooked my chicken breast but that was my own mistake!! Will do again but keep a better eye on the breasts!  That is the most important thing in any chicken recipe!

Great flavour! I did make a few changes though. I followed the advice of one of the other reviewers who suggested adding some chicken stock to mellow out the flavour of the sauce. It was a great idea and really rounded out the flavours in the tomato sauce.  I added a teaspoon of sugar to lessen the zing of the tomatoes and balsamic.  And, finally, I added some chilli flakes, just because I prefer a little heat in my dishes.  Great recipe - I will definitely make this a part of my regular line up.

I did as many suggested and used half balsamic vinegar and half chicken stock, but I think we would like it better with the full vinegar flavor.  I added artichoke hearts and garlic cloves instead of garlic salt.  Very yummy!  Will make again!

This chicken was AWESOME! It is so juicy and flavorful. I was a little worried at first, with the smell being a little overwhelming when I first began cooking it. But I simmered for the length the recipe states and it quickly began to smell wonderful. Try serving over pasta!

This was great. I made very few changes. Just halved the vinegar and added chicken broth as others suggested and also added some mushrooms and garlic. You can also make a quick cacciatore with this by subbing the vinegar for a can of beef broth and sauteing baby bella mushrooms (serve with wide egg noodles). Thanks for the recipe!

This was really tasty! My husband and I both loved it. We followed the recipe to the T (only reducing some of the olive oil) and the flavors blended together so nicely. The chicken was incredibly juicy and tender. We had it with brown rice and the Healthy Garden Salad from this site and it was a perfect, low-cal little meal.

The only reason I give this a 4 instead of 5 is personal taste - I like balsamic to an extent but don't love it.  For people who do love balsamic, I am sure this will get 5 stars.  The only thing different I did to this was add a bit of fresh minced garlic.  This recipe was very easy and took minimal time.  I served it with steamed broccoli - some of the sauce from the chicken got on the broccoli and it was a perfect seasoning for the veggies.  I will more than likely make this again but will prob cut the balsamic with chicken stock next time for a more mild balsamic flavor.

Yummy!  I used fresh minced garlic instead of garlic salt.  Once the chicken was done, I removed it from the pan and brought the remaining sauce up to a boil to thicken it.  This was delicious served over steamed asparagus and potatoes.

Made this for Valentine's for my boyfriend.  He loved it.  He even took leftovers to work the next day.

I had a headache already so when I saw the amount of spices, I decided to cut all by at least half. I had 4 chicken breasts and used 1/4 tsp garlic salt, about 2 cloves minced garlic, 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar,  1/8 tsp basil, 1/8 tsp oregano, pinch of rosemary and a pinch of thyme. With all the alterations, it was very tasty and not too overpowering. I'm not big on using spices so the modifications may not suit others.

This was okay but for some reason I was expecting to be able to taste the balsamic more. I think I should have used less tomatoes than the recipe used. I am a huge fan of balsamic & will adjust the amount next time to fit my preference. I also used minced garlic instead of garlic salt for more flavor. Sadly, I still wasn't overly impressed as many others were.

Great recipe! I'm fairly green in the kitchen and I usually make a mistake or two on the first try, but this one went smoothly.  It looked great and tasted even better.  I threw it a bit extra balsamic vinegar, simply because my husband and I are big fans of it.  I also used whole plum tomatoes and just pulsed them in the blender......unfortunately I didn't have any diced on hand.  I might try using fresh plum tomatoes, too.

Delicious, I used chicken broth with to neutralize the acidity of the balsamic vinegar and it was amazing. I am already planning to make it again and am disappointed that I didnt make more for left overs.

This is a great healthy meal.  For those who don't like tomatoes, it's still wonderful because they soak up the vinegar and have a sweet taste.  The kids enjoyed it as well!

This had a great flavor; the whole family enjoyed it. We added about 1/2 lb. of sliced fresh mushrooms to round it out, and they soaked up the sauce really nicely. Quick, easy, healthful and tasty... a winner all the way around. Thanks!

Delicious recipe! I took advice of some others and cut vinegar in half- but after eating it I decided it would of been better with a little more. You could smell it, but not really taste it. It was still really, really good. I will be making this again. It was so easy too!

My SO actually liked this dish.  He picks out a lot of the tomatoes and onions, but he does 'eat what sticks to the chicken'!  I serve it with garlic mashed potatoes and a vegetable.  I also cut the vinegar in half, as it is too strong for us.   I really like this recipe, though.  I have made it several times.  I like to cut up the chicken into bite sized pieces.  It looks very rustic this way.

Wonderful recipe!  Next time I will use more chicken as the recipe creates quite a bit of juice.  The chicken was very tender and my husband raved about the meal!  Said it was one of his favorite chicken dishes.

Very good flavor and the chicken was very moist.  It tasted best by putting the tomatoes and onion over the chicken.

Just made this again, and it was delicious! I used actual garlic in the pan and regular salt on the chicken. I scaled the recipe down for 2 chicken breasts, since I was just cooking for me and my boyfriend. However, I ended up using the whole can of diced tomatoes because it all just kind of fell out when I poured it. I'm glad I used the whole can of tomatoes because I think the vinegar would be too strong otherwise. It turned out perfect, and the remaining sauce was great to dip my homemade focaccia bread in!

Cut the chicken into bit sized pieces and served on thin spaghetti.  It was very good, and the vinegar flavor was nice and not overpowering.  definitely a keeper.

Pretty good meal. The wife did not like it a lot, but said it was "okay".  I thought the flavor was good, but if you do not like balsamic vinegar STAY AWAY.  It was very tangy.  I served it with some balsamic veggies (potatoes, red peppers and carrots), and I placed the chicken over some white rice.  I give it 4 stars.. but the wife probably would have given it 3.  Definitely not for everyone.

This recipe was excellent and SOOOO easy to make. I was really impressed. I used 1/4 cup of vinegar and 1/4 cup of chicken stock though, thought it might be too vinegary. I also used different herbs that I had on hand and fresh garlic. You can use a variety of herbs for this recipe.

I enjoyed the meal.  My wife and daughters didn't care for the vinegar taste though...even after I cut it in half with the chicken broth.  The cook time took longer, could be the altitude, but everyone commented on how moist the meat was.

I thought this recipe was SO good. I think cooking it in the juices over an open flame helped keep it moist. I didn't have balsamic vinegar so I used the balsamic vinegarette salad dressing, it was so tasty!

This is hands down one of our favorite recipes!  My husband thinks it is as good as any chicken dish you would find in a fine restaurant, and he eats at a lot of great restaurants while traveling.  We always have the ingredients on hand, and it is a very quick dish to prepare.  I use whatever canned tomatoes I have and an italian seasoning blend instead of all the individual ones.  I serve over mashed potatoes (instant because I need shortcuts!), they soak up all the wonderful sauce.  Serve with your favorite vegetable and a glass of red wine, and you will feel like you are in your favorite restaurant!

Wow! This was awesome, I was looking for a simple chicken dish to try and this was just the thing. My husband loved it, I am definately going to add this to my regular routine. I made it as is, except added a little minced garlic to taste.

I like to make this recipe but one thing I do is I boil some noodles (usually spaghetti) and serve the chicken over the noodles - the balsamic mixture makes a really good sauce!

This was a phenomenal recipe, and so simple! I didn't have any garlic salt, so I chopped up 3 cloves of garlic and browned them with the onions and chicken.

This was really good!  I followed the recipe exactly.  The balsamic taste was good but a little strong.  I may try it with 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar and 1/4 chicken broth next time.

Awesome recipe! This is the best chicken recipe I have tried to date. I made a few minor changes: I added a sprinkle of Splenda brown sugar blend when sauteing the onions. The only tomatoes I had in the house was fire roasted diced tomatoes with garlic (I used 1/2 of the can) I also used 1/4 cup balsamic vinager and 1/4 cup chicken broth. I will use this recipe again!

Made this last night exactly as the recipe stated (except I only had half an onion) and it turned out really yummy! Hubby even had seconds! I served over chicken flavored rice just in case the balsamic taste would be too overpowering but it wasn't and the rice soaked up the flavor nicely too. Will definitely make again. Thanks!

I made this for dinner last night and was disappointed.  Using some other reviewers suggestions I cubed the chicken first and added some brown sugar to the sauce.  However the dish just wasn't anything special and I will not make it again.

This recipe was good for a change. I added a side of white rice with butter and this evened out the taste of the balsamic vinegar. My husband liked it

I thought this was a good dish.  I only used 1/2 the balsamic vinegar as other users suggested.  I found myself wishing I had used the full 1/2 cup.  I thought it was a bit sweet, good but sweet.  I'll make this dish again but I'll follow the recipe.

This chicken had a very good flavor. I think I should have cooked the onions a bit longer because they were a bit crunchy for my taste ( and I love onions!), but my husband and I really enjoyed the flavor of the chicken.

I followed the recipe exactly, but the vinegar taste was too strong for us.  It was 'ok'--but based on the reviews I was expecting it to be very tasty.  Also seemed like it was missing 'something' else.

Very good recipe. I modified per another reviewers suggestions. I added onions, mushrooms and fresh garlic also a bit of brown sugar to help caramelize the onions and mushrooms. I mixed the vinegar which I cut down a little with the tomatoes and spices then added that. I served with rice. Everyone in the family ate it without complaint. I will continue to make this dish.

Good, quick and easy.  I served this last night over rice.  I'm also a big fan of balsamic on broccoli, so I wanted to incorporate that into the dinner as well.  I marinated the chicken in the spices and a little bit of the vinegar.  I heated olive oil in a pan and put in the onions to sauté.  After a minute I threw on the chicken (dumped the whole marinating bag) and browned it lightly.  I then removed the chicken and threw on some broccoli (I hate when things overcook).  I sautéed the broccoli until it turned a bright green (so a minute or so) and removed it.  I then put the spices, vinegar, and tomato on the still cooking onion and let the sauce cook down for a while.  After it was a consistency I liked, I put on the chicken, let it cook the rest of the way through, turned off the heat, and added the broccoli and mixed it all together.  Whole thing took me less than a half hour!  There were no leftovers and my guests discovered that dipping Italian bread in the sauce was also a treat.  I will be making it again, although I think I will sauté mushrooms and add some brown sugar to cut down on that vinegar aftertaste. YUM!

Not bad. I was expecting to really taste the balsamic as some reviewers said it was a bit overwhelming. I was actually diappointed because I was expecting more of a tang from the vinegar but just the same it was good. It was a nice healthy dinner.

I made this dish for the guys on my shift at my firehouse and they absolutley loved it! They said it was my best dish yet. The only thing I did different was the diced tomatoes I bought were flavored with roasted garlic and it made the dish even better. Thanks for posting!

I really enjoyed this recipe, but my husband thought it was "ok". It was easy to make, and I thought the balsamic taste was delicious. I might do as others suggested though by using a bit of stock and not as much balsamic to satisfy my husband. I also passed it to another balsamic lover, and she thought it was great!

I originally gave this recipes 4 stars as written but am upgrading it to 5 with a substitution I discovered. I substituted the canned tomatos for 3 very large roma tomatos (chopped and seeded) and one tablespoon julienned sundried tomatos. I use fresh garlic (minced) and 1/4 c basalmic (use good quality - garbage in, garbage out ya know). I also cooked slowly with the lid off at the end to reduce the liquid and intensify the flavors. It was outrageously good! Oh, and I dice the chicken so it cooks faster. Biggest critics love it: 2 yr old to picky brother-in-law. Try with risotto.

This was pretty good! My husband gave it 3 stars and I gave it 4 so I'll just put 4 stars. If you don't like balsamic then I don't think you would enjoy this very much..

This was a very good dish - my roommate and fiance loved it!  Next time I would cut back a little on the vinegar and also on the rosemary - those two were a little overpowering.  But I will definitely make this again!

Great meal, can make healthy when cut out the fat and everything.  Made for my friends and they all enjoyed, put on some jasmine rice made a good combination.  For the 6 pieces you definitely need a very large skillet.

Like other reviewers suggested, I added garlic to my onions.  I also added chicken broth in addition to the full 1/2 cup of balsamic.  This is a very good recipe, and it's pretty quick to pull together from typical pantry ingredients.  I served it over bulgur wheat with a side of sauted brussel sprouts and a glass of wine. We'll be adding this to our mix.

This was excellent.  I cut up the chicken breasts, stir fried, and then added all the ingredients.  It was great over rice.

I tried this recipe out on a whim two weeks ago, and it was wonderful. It seems to have now become my boyfriends favorite as he asked me to make him a weeks worth, which of course i did! It's now going to be a part of my regular rotation.

This was okay, but not as fantastic as I thought it would be based on the reviews.  I like balsamic vinegar, but this just seemed to acidic for me and the spices were a bit overwhelming.  We will more than likely not make this again.

Delicious! This recipe was so easy to make. The only thing I did was added sun dried tomatoes; it made it very tasty. I will definitely make it as part of my everyday repertoire. I may add the brown sugar as another reviewer suggested.

A definite keeper!  I used 1/4 c. balsamic and 1/4 c. chicken broth.  Instead of the spices listed, I used 2 tsp. of Italian seasoning.  Simmered for about 20-25 minutes - boneless, skinless chicken breasts were tender and juicy.  Served with garlic mashed potatoes and petite peas, this was a fast, easy, nice-looking, delicious meal!

I don't usually review recipes that I try but this one was awesome. I made one adjustment - adding 1 TBSP Brown Sugar per another review.  I also chopped up the chicken breasts because I was going to serve it over rice and that is easier for my kids to handle.  I doubled the recipe and took a meal to a friend who'd just had a baby, and received rave reviews.

The balsamic is a little overpowering in this dish.  Must use a high quality vinegar to get the right taste.   I did cut back on the spices, 1/2 t of each basil and oregano, and rosemary and only 1/8 of tyme.  Can't imagine using full amounts, this was just right.  Overall I would make this again.

This chicken was fantastic! I changed it a little bit to suit our tastes. I cut the chicken into bite size pieces to stretch it a little farther and chopped the onions instead of slicing. I only used about an 1/8 cup of balsamic vinegar and replaced the rest with some vegetable broth I had on hand. I also decreased the amount of rosemary. We had it over penne and it was fantastic! I'll definitely make this again and again!

This was absolutely awesome!  The acidic vinegar made the chicken so tender.  All of the flavors came together perfectly and I didn't change the recipe at all.  I served it with basmatti cardamom rice but this would also be very good with spaghetti.  I'm wishing I had doubled the recipe for more leftovers.

This is very delicious! I made this recipe cut down for two, except I used fresh tomatoes and still used 3 cloves garlic (love garlic) and it was sooooo tasty! My husband was dipping frenchbread in the juices toward the end of the cooking. the chicken was so flavorful and not a bit dry! We ate this with spinach & french bread. This would be excellent with a little more sauce over angelhair. Thanks!

I used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt and cut the amount of balsamic in 1/2 cause the taste was too much for us. Not bad.

Made for my family over the weekend.  None of us were impressed.  Followed the recipe exactly...we all like balsamic vinegar.  The guys looked for something else to eat.  The sauce had a wonderful flavor but, the chicken did not absorb any of the flavor and was rather bland.  I served over rice.  Had lots of left overs and used the chicken to make chicken enciladas...they turned out really well.  Am planning on using the rest of the left over chicken for chicken spaghetti.  Thanks for the recipe but this one was not for us.

Another big hit with the family and these are some picky eaters! I made the recipe as submitted just slightly less vinegar and added garlic while cooking the cubed chicken and onions. I prepared rice and green beans as the side dishes. We love it, thank you.

It was different.  I used only half the basalmic amount and bam....tons of flavor.  I think I may use less next time.  I will make it again.  It was easy and I made it with Rice last time, next time I am thinking a mashed potato patty.

Awesome recipe. We love balsalmic vinegar, and its flavor comes out even richer and almost sweeter on the chicken.

This was good but not wow!  I cut chicken into bite size pieces before cooking.  I served over brown rice.  I think next time I will add some garlic to this and more salt and pepper and top with some parmeseam cheese.  Definetly an easy and quick dish to make and a nice change of pace.  Will make again!

Wow! I made this recipe exactly how it was listed and served with some fresh garlic bread and it was awesome! Next time I'll add some fresh garlic to the sauce to give it more kick.

This recipe was really very good!  I followed the recipe exactly except for adding a few cloves of fresh garlic (you can never have too much in our house!) and even my 2.5 year old son ate it all up!  Served it along with brown basmati rice.  We will be making this a regular here!

I made this last night for dinner and it was absolutely fabulous.  I will definately make again and I am raving about this to all my friends.  My boyfriend loves chicken and I am always looking for ways to cook it differently.  Definately give this recipe 5 stars and an additional two thumbs up!!

I thought this was wonderful!  The tomatoes I used were with "zesty jalapenos" which added a little zip!  I also added a small can of sliced mushrooms and served with whole wheat thin spaghetti.  It was a hit with the whole family.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I took the advice of others by cutting the chicken breasts into bite-sized pieces and serving it over pasta. If you don't drain the tomatoes, it makes a great tangy sauce along with the balsamic vinegar. I didn't have onions, so I substituted onion powder and it was still tasty. Very healthy and quick to make.  Great for a weeknight meal.

YUM YUM YUM!  And so easy it was almost embarassing!  I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but then again I rarely do!  I omitted the onion (heartburn!) and dry herbs.  I used canned diced tomatoes that has herbs already mixed in, but did use salt and pepper on the chicken and some fresh basil.  I sauteed a little garlic in the oil before browning the chicken and used boneless skinless thighs instead of breasts, since that is what I had defrosted. 

I served this with tomato-lentil cous-cous and sauteed zucchini.  It was delish!  Thanks a ton!

My boyfriend enjoyed the recipie more than I did, but it was still rather good.  I put 1/4 cup balsamic and 1/4 cup chicken broth.  Next time I will do the same, but use less rosemary. It was a little overpowering for my taste, but it was definately a good recipie.

I used this recipe today & it was a hit.  I put the chicken in the slow-cooker this morning with 1/2 cup water & a bit of olive oil.  By mid-afternoon, when I added the other ingredients (including 1 tsp of brown sugar to cut the tartness of the vinegar & 1 cup chopped green peppers for color), it was falling apart.  By the time I served it at 6:30, it melted in your mouth.  Will have to add the mozzarella next time--sounds good!

This was really tasty and even easier to cook.  I substituted balsamic vinagrette instead of vinegar - so it wasn't as harsh as other's were saying it was.  Even my 2 year old loved it.  The only thing I can recommend is cutting the chicken up into smaller pieces and simmering longer or possibly putting it in a slow cooker as the chicken didn't absorb the sauce as much as I would have liked.

This is a really great, simple recipe.  Like others suggested I added mushrooms and I think it really added something needed to the recipe.  I like to cut the chicken up into bite sized pieces and thicken the sauce with cornstarch towards the end.

This is really good.  I used the full amount of balsamic vinegar, but also used a 1/2 cup of chicken broth as well because instead of boneless chicken breasts, I used a combo pack of thighs and legs.  Making it this way, I should have doubled the herbs, but it was delicious anyways.  Will definitely make again.

I made this for the first time for a dinner party at my home!  Luckily, it was delicious!  I, too, was concerned about the amount of vinegar.  I kept the amount of vinegar, but added 1/2 cup of chicken broth to cut the tang of vinegar.  I substituted mushrooms for tomatoes and cut out the rosemary and thyme.  Served over rice with green beans and beer bread (from this site), our guests were thrilled!  This is a new staple for my family!

This is a good concept but in my opinion needed a lot of help.  With some modifications, however, it is wonderful.  I took the advice of others and only used 1/4 c. balsamic, and also added 1/4 c. chicken stock.  When the chicken was done, I took it out and added 3 t. splenda to sweeten the sauce as it otherwise is too bitter -- and I love balsamic vinegar.  I then added cornstock to thicken the sauce, then added a can of mushrooms.  I served the mixture over pasta and it turned out excellent.  With the modifications, the sauce is rich and irresistable.

Made this recipe with no alterations, though I didn't measure the spices, just eyeballed it. Oh, and I omitted the garlic, since my husband thinks he's allergic (he's not, he just doesn't like it, and won't eat if he knows it's in there!) We enjoyed it, served over pasta. I'm making it again tonight (this time I'll be adding some garlic, I now think it's a necessary addition) and may also add mushrooms as others have done. I will also serve it over med. grain rice this time, as we thought the texture of the onions and pasta were too similar. Great recipe though, and one that's going in the long rotation.

This recipe was a fantastic guideline for a very simple and quick but VERY tasty dish! I didn't follow any of the measurements but eyeballed everything and the flavors all just seemed to compliment each other.  I added extra onions and lots of sliced mushrooms before adding the diced tomatoes and also added enough vinegar to darken the contents of the pan considerably - my boyfriend loves balsamic vinegar.  It simmered for more than 15-20 mins but on a low heat it kept the chicken moist and the sauce that came together had a chance to thicken a bit.  I broiled asparagus in olive oil and salt and mixed it with tagliatelle pasta.  The chicken served on top and ta dah - DEEElish.  Thanks for a great recipe.  SO easy and flexible - will def make it again!

This recipe was outstanding! It was very easy to make, and I didn't do any sort of modifications at all. The flavors mixed together was very tasty, but it had a bit of a bite to it (spice-wise). Nothing extreme by any means, but a nice mix of spices and chicken. I served it with pasta, but next time I will serve it with basmati rice.

this is one of the best recipes I've used in a long time.  I used fresh basil- that's the only change I made (besides cutting the recipe to 3 servings).  Delicious!

A couple of really good things about this recipe is that it's so quick to make and it's list of ingredients are things that are always on hand in a fairly well stocked kitchen.  The only change I made was to add  mushrooms and I think that was a fine addition.  My chicken was slightly overcooked - and that happened in a blink of an eye so make sure you keep an eye on it. It did NOT take 15 minutes for me. More like 10 or 11 and my chicken breasts were not thin either. Very aromatic and extremely tasty. We served it with white rice and steamed veggies on the side. The onions in this recipe are wonderful - next time I might add a whole other onion. If you are looking for a quick meal to prepare and cook - this is it.  Very quick, nutritional and delicious.

I had about ten minutes to scan for something to make for dinner and I just grabbed this because I happened to have most of the ingredients.  It was surprisingly fantastic!  I used a teeny bit less balsamic vinegar, and I added chopped Portobello mushrooms, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I don't know who commented on here that that the chicken was dry; the chicken was moist and flavorful!  Great combination of spices.  Thanks!

Nice recipe, and easy to make.  I did use chicken thighs (what I had on hand) and added some portabella mushrooms, they added a great flavor to the dish!  My husband took the leftovers to work the next day, and said they were even better than the night before!

I made a few small changes that worked out really well.  I used fresh tomatoes sprinkled with suger instead of canned and red onion instead of white.  Came out very sweet and juicy.  Only problem I had was that the onions were not cooked enough (could be an error on my part) so next time I will wait a few minutes before I add the chicken.

This can be a tad too vinegary, however since we like the taste of balsamic vinegar; this recipe was very nice.

My husband and I both really liked this. I was a little skeptical to use all the vinegar after reading all the reviwes but I figured I would try it as written.It was the perfect amount. I left out the onion because we don't care for it and I used real garlic.I also added some shredded parmasane cheese on top.It was the best dinner we have had in a long time. Thank you so much for posting.

I'll certainly make this again. May cut back on the balsamic. I used a wee more than the recipe called for. Also skipped the rosemary because I didn't have it on hand.

I realized at the last minute that I was out of basil, and I added about 3/4 the amt of vinegar listed, but other than that I followed it exactly.  We really enjoyed this and will make it again.

I thought this dish was excellent!  I did double the sauce (we love sauce) and opted for fresh garlic.  My boyfriend loved it to but likes a thicker sauce so perhaps omitting some of the tomato juice and or adding corn starch would do the trick.  Overall though this dish is fantastic and will be a regular in my rotation.

Wow! We made this last night and we LOVED it! I did marinate the chicken for a few hours in the vinegar and still didn't find the flavor overwhelming. Next time I think I will cut the chicken into strips to get more flavor on it. Served with rice. The sauce was great! Thanks for this one! This will be a regular at our house!

I made this for my sunday dinner 3 weeks ago and everyone loved it.  I did make a minor adjustment and that was all the herbs used including the garlic was fresh. I also added the sugar to cut the taste as it was suggested by another review.  I am making again this sunday. I served with seasoned wheat pasta...love this recipe

Ok. The actual chicken didn't really have that much additional flavor of balsamic. Maybe next time I'll try marinating it 1st for a longer period of time.

We both enjoyed this very much. The only thing I would change is to double the sauce because it was so good, we wanted more!  I had a chicken breast leftover, so I dived it, made more sauce, and put it over pasta, which was very good as well.

Great but I used some of the modifications suggested in other reviews. My taste for balsamic is what led me to this recipe, but as I was making it, even I thought 1/2c was too much, so I put in 1/3c instead. I also added about 1 tablespoon of light brown sugar.

I simmered my chicken for closer to 25-30 minutes, basting the chicken every so often and that left just the sweetness of the balsamic vinegar.  I served it over rice and it was delicious.  Already looking forward to making this again!

Scaled back to 2 servings and substituted 1/2 a fresh tomato for the canned tomatoes. Cubed the chicken before cooking. Omitted the onion, garlic salt, and rosemary. Kept the balsamic vinegar the same amount.  I used the sweet balsamic vinegar, it has a wonderful taste. Turned up the heat at the end to thicken the sauce which turned out perfectly. Not too salty, too sweet, or too vinegary. Very good dish that needs only a few ingredients. Will make again soon. Thanks!

Total agreement - This chicken rocks!  The sauce is so yummy.  I served it with brown rice and brocolli.  There were no left overs.  A keeper for sure.

We loved this but altered it a bit. We reduced the vinegar as suggested by other posters and used fresh garlic. We cooked ours in the crock pot for about 7 hours and added a splash of red wine. It was WONDERFUL! We've made it again using pork instead of chicken breasts and it was great as well.

Very tasty! I scaled it down to four servings my first time, two servings my second time. I've served it over buttered spaghetti and whole wheat linguini; I personally think the linguni holds up a little better for it.  I put a little splash of maple syrup in to cut any vinegary-tang, but I did use the full amount of vinegar.  I think I'll try doubling the sauce, because it's so darn tasty!  Might pound my breasts thin, too; I had to add a little water to the pan because my really thick chicken still needed cooking while the liquid was almost gone.  A company-worthy dish that earned a thumbs-up from my husband.

This was a very nice dish, I will use a little less thyme though when I make this again.We love how the tomatoes soak up the vinegar.  I sauted cauliflower, red peppers, baby carrots, and zucchini in olive oil and seasoned it with some dash. This is a good healthy meal thanks!

I made this in my crockpot.  I didn't have tomatoes or onions, so I added some onion powder and added a can (8 oz.) of tomato sauce.  I used the full 1/2 cup of balsamic vinegar which mixed with the tomato sauce and had a great flavor.  My kids even liked the grown-up taste.

I followed the suggestions and used 1/4c vinegar, 1/4c chicken broth. I skipped the herbs and did not miss them in the finished product. The tomato/onion/vinegar sauce pairs well with rice (also cooked in chicken broth). I've never cooked with more than a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar before, and I am surprised how long the flavor lingers in my mouth. If you are unsure how you will enjoy the balsamic flavor, I suggest going for a 3 to 1 ratio of broth to vinegar. Will make again though! Great and simple pantry-staple recipe

Delicious and easy recipe!  I did not have thyme available.  I replaced 1/2 cup of balsamic vinegar with 1/4 cup balsamic vinega and 1/4 cup white wine.  I also added a tablespoon of brown sugar.  I will definitely be keeping this recipe as one of my favorites.

The balsamic vinegar overwhelmed any tomato taste.  Next time, I think I'll increase the tomatoes and decrease the balsamic vinegar (and we really like balsamic vinegar!)

If you don't LOVE the taste of Balsamic Vinegar then you probably won't like this recipe. I however, love it, and I really liked this recipe. The 'sauce' got really thick and dry before the chicken was done so I added more tomatoes and sauce from the can and a little bitter of water. The resulting sauce was delicious and the chicken came out great!

Absolutely delish!  I don't like mushrooms, so I didn't add those but didn't change a thing to the recipe and it was amazing!  Loved the reduction sauce and the chicken was cooked perfect.  Great job!

This is an excellent recipe.  My (very) picky boyfriend gobbled it up and kept asking, "Are you sure this is healthy?"  We   are adding it  to our rotation.
I didn't change a thing, however, my chicken was probably cooked after 11 or 12 minutes.  Maybe I browned it more than most people, but be sure to check it so it doesn't dry out.

this is quick and delicious!  i usually re-season my chicken and add more vinegar about half-way through because i find the seasoning comes off during cooking.  i also skip out on the tomatoes and it still turns out great!

This recipe was very flavorful, but too much for our family. The spices and balsamic vinegar were overpowering. If I made this again, I would cut the spices back by at least half and substitute half the balsamic vinegar with chicken broth. Everyone else seemed to love it, so maybe it's just my family that thought the flavors were too overwhelming. I did love how healthy this recipe was, though.

The suggestion to use chicken broth with the balsamic vinagar was key for my family!  My husband is not crazy about the flavor of balsamic vinagar, so cutting it with chicken broth was a great idea, thanks!

this is a super recipe.  i've made it twice and used dried once and fresh herbs once.  I was pleased with both!  I found the balsamic flavor to be perfect, though I initially thought it would be too tangy.  This is a recipe I will be making often :)

My whole family LOVES this recipe. I follow it exactly and it comes out perfectly everytime. It is sooo easy to make. You should definitely love balsamic vinegar if you are going to enjoy this. I don't feel that the vinegar is harsh. Once simmered, it mellows a bit.  We serve with wild rice. I've made it for guests a few times and had rave reviews and clean plates!!! Thanks so much for the recipe!!

Very good but I used half rice vinegar and half balsamic because balsamic has quite a bite.

Three and a half stars is what I would give this if I could.  While cooking, it smelled awesome and we were sooooo excited.  Once I served it, I was very happy with it.  I don't love the taste of canned tomatoes and felt that it gave it a chicken cacciatori taste.  That is not necessarily a bad thing, but I was looking for a new take on chicken. I will make this again.  Next time I will drain the tomatoes and add either more balsamic or something else on hand, if needed.  The onions were really yummy.

I really loved this chicken!!! It smelled delicious while cooking and the vinegar made it taste delicious! I actually loved the vinegar on it despite what others were saying, and served it over a bed of white rice, and the tomato and onion along with the vinegar made this a keeper. My new favoirte marinade for chicken!! Thanks!

This was a great recipe for a quick dinner.  Don't overcook as it tends to dry out.  I did cut the balsamic in 1/3 cup as some suggested but would probably not do that again as we love the flavor.  Easy, impressive and delicious!

I'm not sure if it's the rosemary or thyme I didn't like or if it was the balsamic that was bitter (I cut it in half) but I think if I omitted those two spices and tried again it may be worth it for a quick dinner because I should have everything on hand if it's last minute.

Easy and great taste.  I used halved fresh cherry tomatoes.  Since I didn't have any plain balsamic vinegar, I let a bottle of balsamic vinagrette seperate, then used a turkey plunger to extract the oil (on top) for step one, then the balsamic (on the bottom) for step two.  I'd advise others to use too little rather than too much thyme and taste it before adding the salt.

Made this again in 2015.  I suggest thinly slicing (not dicing) red onion.  I am using the leftover sauce and vegetables to marinade another chicken breast.

Wow!! I was really surprised on how good this dish was. I like balsamic vinegar in salads so I decided to check it out.
At first I was going to cut back on the vinegar has some reviewers mentioned. However, I usually follow a recipes exactly the first time I make it. Then I make changes as needed. The only thing I did differently was that I added some chicken broth. About 1/2 cup. My wife boiled some chicken earlier that day and I wanted to use the broth instead of throwing it away.
This recipe is definite a keeper.

Liked this recipe, but after reading other reviews, did cut the balsamic vinegar in half.  I think if I had used the whole amount it would have been too tart.  Wasn't sure whether I was supposed to drain the tomatoes or not.

Made this tonite with green beans and baked mac and cheese....yummy!  I only used half the balsamic vinegar and added 1/4 cup water to make up the difference, but only because I didn't have enough vinegar, not because of the taste.  Was very good, nice and juicy, easy to make.  Boyfriend loved it and he's a pain to get any feedback from!

I reduced the balsamic to 1/3 cup and it was perfect! I served this with Baked Zucchini Chips (from this site) and Italian bread and it was a big hit! I will make this again and again. The leftovers work well as a sandwich on a roll with the balsamic broth poured on top. Yum!

Very good.  I used garlic powder instead as Im on a low sodium diet.  Still turned out delish.  Served with a nice side of pasta.  The sauce tastes great over the pasta.

This dish is great.  I've tried it a couple of times. The first time I used the listed ingredients and loved it.  The next time I tried using the Italian seasoned diced tomatoes and  less of the Italian dried seasoning. I like the original recipe much better.  It has better flavor balance and isn't as sweet and tangy.

This is a quintessential Italian tasting dish.  I cubed my chicken for faster cooking and ended up adding an extra can of drained diced tomatoes.  I served it over a bed of polenta with sauteed zucchini on the side.  Delicious!

My boyfriend and I made this exactly as the recipe reads...and it was unbelievable!!  My mom, who hates chicken (I am 23 and literally had never seen her eat it before) had 2 pieces saying it smelled too good to resist.  My boyfriend and I are getting our first apt. together next week, and are making our own cookbook of our favorite recipes...and this will be the first to go in there!

The balsamic was supposed to turn me off, but to my surprise I ended up rather liking it.  This is fast, simple, and has just about every characteristic Italian flavoring you need for a satisfying and believable meal.  Would make again.

i was torn between 3 and 4 stars, so i'll round up.  I cooked according to instructions, yet added more tomatoes and i'm glad i did because it was a lot of vinegar.  may use 1/2 or a 1/4 of the vinegar next time.  other than that it was pretty good.  healthy and easy.

Tangy. Added a little bit of brown sugar as well as some crushed red pepper for some heat. Not sure if I would personally volunteer this for a weeknight dinner...my husband however loved it. But for ease of prep and time I do give it 5 stars

Easy to make and quick to fix for any weeknight dinner.  I agreed with everyone else and didn't put as much balsamic vinegar; I used only a 1/4 cup and even that gave it a strong flavor.  I used with skinless chicken thighs and worked just as well.

I actually forgot to add the canned tomatoes and panicked, thinking to myself that the chicken would taste too much like balsamic vinegar. Alas! I used maybe a 1/4 to 1/3 cup of balsamic vinegar, adding the minced garlic just before dropping in pan to prevent tburning, and it came out delicious. I served it with a flavored couscous and sauteed fresh vegetables (carrots, cauliflower, broccoli and green beans).

This dish was very tasty.  It had lots of flavor and texture.  I cut the chicken into bite sized pieces and served it over converted rice. This was a great "good for you" recipe.

Pretty darn good. The sauce was a little too runny though, next time I may thicken it up with some cornstarch to give it some substance. The taste and the smell were wonderful. A perfect dish when you're watching your weight but don't want to feel deprived.

I love this recipe for 2 simple reasons...it's incredibly easy and fast, and it tastes good.  These are the changes I make:  I don't use onions and I never seem to have rosemary or thyme on hand, so I usually play with the spices and it always turns out fine.  This recipe is perfect "staple" chicken recipe...great if you're in a hurry but feel like doing something extra to a chicken breast.

I thought it was wonderful (even better the next day) but my husband who doesnt really like the taste of balsamic vinegar hated it and didnt even want to take it to work!But then my 3 year old loved it also... It definately depends on your taste.

I did exactly what the recipe called for except didn't put a half a cup of vinger I put a little less vinger. It was good but not the best.

My new favorite recipe. I used boneless pork and it was fabulous!!! My 16 month old LOVED the tomatoes. I would double the tomatoes and onions next time and use it as a warm salad with bread. YUMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!

This dish is fast and easy to make and it tastes delicious. I used less chicken breasts but I made the same amount of sauce so I would have extra to put over the rice I served with it. I was suprised by how sweet it was, and I think I might add some brown sugar to the sauce the next time I make this. Thanks for the great recipe.

This was a really good chicken breast recipe. I made it even easier by using canned diced tomatoes that are already seasoned with oregano, basil, and garlic. I added some fresh garlic as well as a carton of sliced baby bella mushrooms, and it was delicious. Good enough to serve company. I served with brown rice and Dad's Pan Fried Green Beans (also delish, and made with balsalmic).

Great, rich flavor. A word of caution, it does have a heavy herb flavor, which, while I find delicious, others may find a bit strong. Spinach salad with a light balsamic dressing is a nice side and balances the meal.

Have made this recipe a couple of times.  I will rate it a 4 as I made adjustments to it.  Reduced the amount of tomatoes by 1/4.  I added about 2 tbsp of brown sugar.  Husband enjoyed very much.  Another keeper.

I thought that the tomato mixture in the pot would be good to have over rice - but it dried up during the cooking process - the chicken was dry too.  My hasband liked it, but I could take it or leave it.

Byron loved this recipe, despite the fact I accidently left out the onions. We opted to use Balsamic vinegarette instead of the vinegar (didn't have any) and it worked just as well. The only problem is the excessive amount of oil that comes with the vinegarette. Either way, the chicken stays moist.

My family liked this recipe.  I liked that it called for alot of seasoning since I take the onion and tomato off for my children.  Without the veggies the chicken must still be flavorful since my oldest ate his without complaint.  I liked the recipe pretty much as is.  I might decrease the balsamic vinegar just a little bit.

My family loves this dish!  It's on my standard menu planning list.  I use italian flavored diced tomatoes, and serve with rice.

I don't like to give up on 4-5 star recipes easily, so I tried this for the second time yesterday, but still don't care for it. I like all of the ingredients separately, but somehow this combination just doesn't agree with me - too overpowering for the chicken I guess. I made only a small amount, as my son and husband were away on a fishing trip. I don't think they would like it either. Maybe there are some suggestions for tweaking from other reviews I should look for.

LOVE this recipe! I cut down on the balsamic vinegar a bit and it works out great for us. It is essential to use a good quality balsamic vinegar.

This was fantastic and easy. You do have to like balsamic quite a bit (my husband found it a tad overwhelming) but for my taste, I wouldnt change a thing. Make sure you make this with rice, or have crusty bread to soak up all of the juices. YUM

My husband and I liked this although I could have added more vinegar. None of my kids liked it, even the ones who will eat anything. Might add to my meal plan every once in a while just for something different.

This was awesome, I used only three breast halves and cut everything in half except the tomatoes. Turned out wonderfully!! The spices were perfect. If you don't like balsamic vinegar though I wouldn't reccommend this recipie.

This was awesome.  The flavor is definitely strong, but we like it that way.  It makes plenty of sauce so it was perfect served over angel hair pasta.  This will be a regular on our table.

First of all, I'm amazed to read that anyone thought this dish was bland.  If you are a fan of balsamic vinegar, you will love it.  My whole family loved it, including two boys, 10 and 7.  They say it's "AWESOME!!" and I can't argue.  I did have to cook longer than the stated time to get the sauce to thicken, but was it ever worth the wait.  Thanks Beth for a fantastic recipe.  This is absolutely fine restaurant quality!

I thought this dish was alright. Bland if you ask me. I would suggest you add more seasoning.I think I went wrong by using brown rice instead of a fried rice. Definitley use some type of flavored rice for this dish...it might just be better. I will try it again..

I found this to be bit too tangy for my tastes the first time I made it, so I added 2 Tbsps brown sugar to cut it down a bit.  I also added 1 tsp paprika and 1/8 tsp cayenne.  That really helped, but the balsamic flavor was still a little strong, so next time I'll cut back on the vinegar and add chicken stock to top up to the 1/2 cup. Very nice recipe - thank you!

My family really liked this recipe, I thought is tasted to much like  vinegar. I did add a can of tomato paste instead of the diced tomatoes and it made a really nice thick sauce. I also added fresh garlic. Next time I make this I think I will add rice or angel hair pasta.

I cut chicken into bite-size pieces before browning, and then added the chicken & onions into my crock pot, along with the rest of the ingredients.  Cooked on high for 3-4 hours - smelled delicious!  Sauce was perfect consistency and chicken was very tender, although the dish seemed to have a slightly bitter aftertaste.  Might try with wine next time instead of vinegar if I use the crock.  Served with angel hair & green beans.

Loved this dish.  I didn't have balsamic vinegar on hand, so used a lemon-rosemary vinegar instead.  Also, used chicken tenders instead.  Turned out fantastic.  I will definitely make this again in the future.  Thanks much for sharing!

I put all the ingredients in the slow cooker and it turned out beautifully.  Wasn't quite as flavorful as all the herbs and vinegar might suggest, but good none the less.  I shredded the chicken and served it all over rice.  Next time I might add more garlic (I used regular salt and pepper, but added minced garlic), and a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce.

Loved it.  I didn't add any olive oil, just sprayed my pan.  Served it with some noodles and steamed veggies.  I will make this again.

I really liked this recipe.  I used sliced fresh mushroom instead of an onion.  I used Pam spray instead of olive oil.  I really liked it, i thought it was a tad strong on the balsamic flavor a few bites.  I don't think I would like the sauce over rice or pasta, we just had a side salad w/ it.

This was great! I scaled it for 4 servings, left out the onion (I didn't have any) and used 1/2 t. minced garlic instead. I used a whole can of diced tomatoes instead of 2/3 by accident and it still turned out fabulous! Will definitely make again!

This was quick & easy. We served it with the chicken over rice and the combination of the onions with the balsamic vinegar was yummy!! I will definitely make this again, and will probably add mushrooms next time.

This dish was full of juice and flavor.  My husband said this is one of his favorite chicken recipes! He can't wait to make it again.  I added one bell pepper (diced) and one onion (diced) and it definitely made it even better.  To make it low fat, I used one tbsp of wine in place of the olive oil.  The best thing is that it was quick weeknight meal.  Thanks Beth!

We really, really liked this chicken.  Very tasty, fast and easy.  I first sauteed the onion along with roasted red peppers and removed them.  I browned the chicken and then added back the onions and peppers to simmer until done.  Next time we'll add mushrooms, too.  The sauce is absolutely delicious!  YUM!

Awesome recipe! Cooked the chicken a little more before adding the sauce. I also mixed the balsamic vin., tomatoes and spices together first before adding to the chicken. This recipe was very simple and looked and tasted like something you would order at a fancy restaurant. Thanks for sharing, Beth!

This recipe just ROCKS! Not only did both my kids love it so did my not so fond of chicken husband. I did take the advice of others and cut the balsamic vinegar in half. This has restaurant quality flavor all the way. This would be great over any meat. I will definitly be making this again and again!

This is a really good recipe.  I wasn't disappointed.  I altered the recipe just a little by using balsamic vinaigrette (salad dressing...it was a less oily, more creamy kind) instead of balsamic vinegar and reducing it to 1/4 cup.  I also added about a teaspoon of crushed garlic when cooking the chicken.

Chicken turned out wonderfully!  It was very juicy, but the flavoring was not too strong.  I prefer it this way, but if you like a stronger taste, you may want to try something else.

Easy and super yummy. I cut the chicken in large chunks before cooking.  I also added red pepper flake to spice it up.  A keeper for sure.

I noticed that one reviewer said the recipe lacked "zip" and another said that if cooking for fewer people, do not reduce the sauce as it is very good.  I was cooking for two and cooked one breast and two thighs.  I used a 10 oz can of Rotel Mild Diced Tomatoes and Green Chilis.  I did reduce the balsamic as suggested to a bit over 1/4 cup as the tomatoes came in a 10 oz can.  I also reduced the herbs to a scant 1 tsp as called for.  It was superb.  I definitely will serve this again.   Had PLENTY of sauce for more chicken so if you are cooking for 4 this should work.

This dish was amazing. I made a couple of adjustments as suggested by other reviewers. I cubed four chicken breasts. I diced one large fresh tomato. Added 1 cup of Fresh mushrooms and 1 cup of marinated artichoke hearts. After the chicken was cooked, i seperated the sauce. placing chicken in a heated dish and leaving the sauce in a sauce pan. I added a tablespoon of butter to the sauce to thicken it up and served the dish on a bed of white rice. It was amazing. It didn't look too pretty but it tasted SOOOOO good.

Always looking for new ways to prepare chicken.  This one will go in the recipe book.  I did follow several reviews and cut down on the vinegar to 1/3 cup.  Did not have all the spices so I used what was available.  Also added chopped garlic.

Easy to make, I didnt have chicken breast, so I used legs instead so I had to cook it a little longer.  Came out great, has a wonderful tangy zip.

I thought that this was excellent!  The vinegar flavor can be a little overpowering, but serve it over some fluffy white rice and it is yummy!  I didn't change a thing in the recipe.

My husband made this one. He made spaghetti noodles and served the chicken on top.  He added red pepper flakes and only 1/4C balsamic vinegar.
Nothing left over, maybe he should cook more often!!!!!

Extremely tasty, simple dish. With my limited spice rack I was unable to use all the seasonings listed, yet it still tasted wonderful. The tomatoes serve nicely to lessen the sometimes overpowering taste of balsamic vinegar. A wonderful meal!

This was ok. I thought with all the spices it'd have more flavor, but it was kind of bland to me. I might try again if I play it up some.

I thought that this recipie was just okay.  The thyme was a little overpowering.  My husband and I could only eat so much before the flavor of the balsmic bacame too sickening to eat anymore.  Sorry!  I will not make this again.  I do however enjoy trying new recipies.  The only way to find out if you like something is to try it!

I cut my chicken into small pieces, otherwise made this according to the recipe. Tastes great! I portioned it out, and froze the individual portions. I use them to add to salads, serve with brown rice, etc. when I want something healthy but don't want to cook more. Yum! Great twist on the usual.

Tried this tonight. It was quite good. Very flavorful. I didn't have any rosemary. Used garlic pepper to season chicken and added a clove of minced garlic.

This recipe was amazing!  I didn't use as much vinegar that it called for (about 1/3 cup), used tomatoes with chiles for an extra kick, and added portabella mushrooms.  It was incredible, I am definitely going to make this again, especially for company!

This was wonderful.  I have impossible boys who don't like anything except what they are used to.  I love variety and this recipe was a hit all around.  I let everything simmer longer to thicken the sauce since other reviews had said it was too watery.  Absoutely wonderful, the balsamic and the tomatos are a wonderful compliment to each other.

This has become one of my new favorite chicken recipes.  My friend and I call it "ugly chicken" because it really doesn't look too good.  But who cares -- it has a really "zippy" flavor and tastes terrific!  I serve mine with fresh french bread and salad.

Although I enjoy balsamic vinegar, it was overwhelming in this recipe.  My husband and sons ate small portions by removing the sauce.  If I were to make it again, I would greatly reduce or even eliminate the vinegar.  I might also try baking it to produce a moister chicken.

This recipe was pretty good. I was looking for a different way to make chicken, and the balsamic vinegar hooked me. It turned out tender and somewhat elegent with all the onions, tomatoes, and spices, but it really lacked something in flavor for me.  I guess one should expect it to taste like balsamic vinegar, which it did, but it didn't really have any zing/punch to it. It was kind of sweet and flat, but it was alright. Probably not something I'll make again.

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars, because I just thought it was ok, but my husband loved it.  I added a can of artichoke hearts that I roughly chopped, and thought they went very well with the dish.  Actually, I think I would have liked it better without the chicken, and could have had the sauce over rice.  I didn't want the vinegar to be overwhelming, since I'm feeding two kids, so I only added 1/3 of a cup.  I'm glad I did, because even with a smaller amount, I thought the vinegar was quite strong.

This is an excellent recipe! I used less onions (I only used about 1/4 of an onion because I dont like a lot of onion flavor) and would probably use only about 1/3 cup of vinigar next time. I served it with brown rice and green beans and it was very tasty though!

This was good, but I'm not sure if it was my mistake or the recipe, but it was a little too vinegary.  Anyhow, I followed the recipe to the t, except I added some sliced mushrooms to the onions while sauteing.

Wow!! I was pleasantly suprised by this recipe. I used 1/3 cup balsamic vinegar and added 1 can(drained)unmarinated artichoke hearts. From the smell I was afraid the flavor would be overwhelming. It was delightful.

This is an outstanding recipe.  As is, it stands alone.  The only 2 changes I made was to add some crushed red pepper and use thick, boneless pork chops instead of chicken.  Thank you....I can't wait to make this again!

My husband and I are not tomato fans but I decided to try this just using the juice from the tomatoes.  My husband said this was too vinegary. But, I really enjoyed it.  I will make it again.  Thanks for sharing.

This is the best chicken recipe out there.  The chicken is so moist and flavorful.  My two and four year olds liked it too.  I thought it was easy to make but wish it was an "oven-dish" so I can just assemble and leave it.  This one is a definate keeper.  I felt like a pro!

I would never have thought of this flavor combination but it was wonderful!  I had all the ingredients on hand and my boyfriend loved it.  Best of all, it was low fat.  Thanks Beth.

I loved this recipe. It takes cooks for 45 minutes, but it is very easy to prepare. Excellent flavor, and great with rice or pasta.

I was looking for something new to do with chicken that would liven it up. This was a great recipe for that. I think it would probably be better with fresh plum tomatoes instead of canned. I will definitely use this one again.

The more I eat this, the more I like it.  I put it over a little bit of rice to absorb some of the sauce.
