I joined allrecipes just to review this this bread.  I sent it to the man I'm dating who lives 800  miles away as part of a Christmas gift and it took 5 days to get to him and he still has been raving NONSTOP over it, he even shared it with coworkers and roommate who loved it too! They said I should sell it.  I made it with naturally white flour, added a hint of cinnamon and nutmeg to the dry ingredients, skipped the orange zest but used oj with pulp and threw in a bit of vanilla with the wet ingredients. I also threw in some dried cranberries and some almonds that I had on hand.  It cooked perfectly in an hour. I made a second loaf to feed my parents - it's great toasted with a little cream cheese on it!

This had a great flavor! I added half a cup of plain yogurt to the batter, doubled the cranberries, and baked it in two 8.5 x 4.5 x 2.5 inch pyrex loaf pans.  It took about 45-50 minutes to bake.  I'm so glad I saved some cranberries in the freezer- this was yummy!

I make this all the time and have been making it the exact same way since I found the recipe about a year ago!  It's easy and it impresses!  I never make bread though, I put these in muffin tins for individual servings!

This is a great muffin recipe also.  I omit the walnuts, add a little bit more OJ and use chopped dried cranberries.  Then I bake them as muffins at 350F for about 23 minutes and my mom repeatedly asks for these every time I come back home to visit from school!

I have to admit, the first time I tasted this bread, I thought it was too tart.  However, when we cut another piece in the evening with some coffee, it tasted amazing.  The flavors just took a little while to come together - try the recipe...it's excellent!

I used 2 cups cranberries and left out the walnuts. Also, I had to leave it in for an extra 15 min. It was gone as soon as I put it on the table. Good thing I stocked up on cranberries in November.

I just made this and it is very nummy!  I was worried because the batter was a bit think that it might be dry but it isn't at all and has great flavour without being overly sweet.    I will make this again :)

Great bread to serve during the holidays. The tartness of the berries mixed with the orange is a great combo.  I followed the recipes exactly and only had to extend the baking time by about ten minutes-( my oven is old:) I sliced it while it was still warm and served it with hot cider.  This will definately be holiday treat that I will make for years to come

Quick and easy to make and delicious!  Very festive - a hit at Christmas parties.  We left out the walnuts and added even more cranberries.

Great base recipe for Cranberry bread, but I highly recommend (another review recommended as well) to cook the cranberries until they pop and add some sugar. Recipe as is did not appeal to some who tried it. The tartness of the cranberries were shocking when you took a bite since they were fresh. Alternatively, coarsely chop cranberries and add 1/4 cup of sugar and let stand a room temp for 30 min then add to batter. I personally love cranberries and thought it was way too tart. The bread batter is great and moist, but the cranberries need to be sweeter.

Wow - this is fantastic!  A while ago I was looking for the perfect muffin recipe and eventually gave up and then I found this and my search is over!  I followed the recipe as written except added a little vanilla.  I doubled the batch and got 6 mini loaves.  Everyone in my family raved over this recipe.  I wish I'd found it a few weeks ago and I would have been giving it out as Christmas gifts.

I used all whole wheat flour in place of all purpose flour. I cut the sugar back to 2/3 cup instead of 1 cup and used brown sugar instead of white (just to give it a little more flavor). I substituted canola oil for the butter and left out the walnuts. I tripled the recipe and planned to make 3 loaves, but felt that they were kind of small so I made 2 loaves out of the triple batch. They turned out beautifully! Very tasty!

For those who wanted "orange bread" w/o cran or nuts, it is a great recipe for that as well - I left those out for a plain & simple loaf! Its a 5* recipe with my changes: 40 g (3 Tbsp) butter  (I did not have any yogurt on hand and I thought it would need more fat); 1/4 c more OJ and I popped it into an oven at 160C, and upped it to 170C which is what the recipe calls for about 15mins later (because some people had trouble with dry bread). I make a syrup with 3 T white sugar & 3 T OJ - pull bread out of the oven, poke light holes in it with a sharp fork while its warm, and pour warm glaze while its in the tin. Then take it out of the tin only when cool. I always line my tin with paper so I'm not sure if this makes it difficult to pull out eventually. -- super moist! PS zest of 2 BIG oranges did it - super strong orange taste :)
Also, toast some slivered almonds, and pour half the syrup on, then scatter almonds, and pour the rest of the syrup. Almonds stick to the loaf & remain crunchy - YUM.

I have been eating and later making this bread with slight variations for years and it has always been a favorite.  Variations: I use 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda and no salt. 2T of shortening instead of butter, and I like it better when the cranberries have been sliced in half rather than the whole berries.  I also omit the 2T of hot water but squeeze the juice of the grated orange and add water to that to make 3/4 cup.

Excellent bread!  The orange flavor was nice, and I like the fact that it uses less fat than the other recipes.  The one thing I did change was to use half the nuts called for and that was just plenty.  For us, a full cup would have been too much. I'll be saving this recipe!

I really didn't enjoy the flavor combination of orange and cranberry. Also, this was too dry for me.

Delicious!  I made three mini loaves and substituted dried cranberries for fresh, as well as added 2 T or so of vanilla yogurt and 2 T or so of wheat bran.  I glazed them with an oj/powdered sugar glaze when they came out and wouldn't do that again because it made them almost too sweet.  I would also soak the craisins in the oj for a few minutes next time, but all in all this was delish!  The mini loaves took around 35 minutes to bake at 325.  YUM!

Just a caution - some oranges have very thick rinds and it makes the bread a little bitter if you use all of it. I usually use about 1/3 of a cup of the gratings, loosely packed. I also leave out the hot water and put in about 3/4 cup of strong orange juice (enhanced with a little "condensed" juice). This is absolutely my favorite cranberry recipe of all time!

This is a really good alternative to the recipe on the bag of Ocean Spray cranberries I had on hand. I popped them in the magic bullet so they were coarsely diced (I prefer that to whole berries or larger chunks). I doubled everything in the recipe (which was enough to use the whole bag of cranberries I had). I only had satsuma oranges and used the zest of two of them. I added 1 tsp of vanilla, a little bit of extra orange juice, and 1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice, and left out the nuts entirely since I have a toddler who can't chew them. I baked in two standard loaf pans for about 50 mins.
 
Whole family is really enjoying it, even my picky toddler. It's especially good warm with butter. Will definitely make again.

Use up that cranberry sauce! I made this after Thanksgiving and substituted left over whole cranberry sauce for fresh cranberries. I also took the idea from others and here are the extras ingred. I added: 1/2c vanilla yogurt, splash of vanilla extract, hint of nutmeg and cinnamon. I cooked in a mini loaf pan @ 350 for about 23 min. Thanks!

These are very yummy muffins. I love the flavor of orange in just about anything. I added the pulp (chopped into ity bity bits) after juicing the orange. Just to intensify the orange flavor even more. And, I made them in muffins tins; this recipe made 24 muffins. I froze 6 and between my husband, myself and some of kids dropping by today, they are all gone. This is a keeper.

This is an amazing recipe! For once, I followed it exactly with no modifications and I was thrilled with the results. This is a dense, rich, tangy bread with great texture. The orange juice makes the crust a bit crisy but when combined with the moist, dense texture this makes for wonderful mouth feel. Really fabulous and works nicely as muffins too.

Great tasty bread.  The tart taste of cranberries in the sweet bread is great, but the orange flavor just pulls this bread into a new level.  Thanks so much for sharing.

Nummers.  Didn't end up with half a cup of juice, from the orange that I used for the grated orange peel, so I used pineapple juice which I had on hand. Also used oil in place of the butter, and before serving drizzled with a confectioners sugar/milk glaze. Perfect holiday breakfast bread.

Amazing bread. I used dried cranberries, extra OJ to plump up the cranberries, and wheat flour.

I made a few alterations to this recipe, not because there is anything wrong with the recipe as written, but because I didn't have all the ingredients and I still wanted to try it.  I used 1 cup of dried cranberries instead of fresh, and because of this, I upped the amount of orange juice to a full cup.  I did not have any fresh oranges to zest, so I put in a heaping spoonful of orange marmalade instead since it's main ingredient is orange zest.  Because I used the marmalade, I mixed all the wet ingredients in a blender to insure that they'd mix evenly.  I also sprinkled some almond slivers and coarse sugar crystals on the top before baking it, which gave the top a delightful crunch.  This bread came out great, even with the alterations.  I can't wait to try it again with fresh cranberries!

This is THE best bread I have ever made.  My family has requested this bread 4 times since Thanksgiving (and they are not big sweet bread eaters).

I just made this for Christmas gifts, as well as for my family. It is wonderful. Here is what I did based on reviews and it was just perfect:
I doubled the recipe and this was perfect for 3 mini-loaf pans.
I hand chopped the cranberries (blender is broken and don't have a food chopper), which I do recommend.
Also, I added generous shakes of cinnamon and nutmeg, plus a generous splash of vanilla.

Yummy!

Amazing! Everybody who has tried it absolutely loved it. I topped mine with a simple orange glaze made from orange juice and powdered sugar.

The taste is ok, but the bread is very heavy and dense.  It is not what I was hoping for.  I may try to tweak it some, but I'm not in any hurry.

I followed this recipe to the letter. It was ok—but definitely not the best quick bread I've ever made. I found the fresh cranberries to be a little too sour in the bread, and I would bake it for less time (it turned out dry).

Made this three times now. Twice as a loaf of bread and once as muffins. Both methods are great!

I changed a few things:
- Added half a Yoplait Orange Cream Flavor. Made the bread a bit softer.
- Many reviewed ommitted the walnuts, so I just added 1/4 cup of crushed walnuts, and it was fine. Added texture.
- Included the orange peel twice and ommitted it once. Didn't make much of a difference, so I might not include it for future batches.
- Used craisins instead of fresh cranberries. Tasted fine.

Great and easy recipe!

Just made this bread.  I read through the reviews to see if anything needed to be changed - but I made it according to the recipe and it turned out GREAT!  I did coarsely chop the cranberries first - that was the only change I made.  Yum!

For years we had been using an old family recipe for cranberry-orange bread, but I tried this one out just for fun and WOW! My family is very impressed! The nuts really add something special and I will be stockpiling cranberries in the freezer so I can make this bread year round. Thanks for sharing!

I followed the recipe exactly- I find it very funny when people modify the recipe then rate it poorly, LOL. But anyway, this bread is nice. Not as moist as I thought it would be- but it has a nice tart flavor. My husband didn't care for it because he dislikes the taste of orange marmalade. This does very much taste like orange marmalade. But that just means more for me =)

This was easy to make.  The batter has the consistency of a sugar cookie dough and is very, very sweet.  The cranberries are a too-tart contrast.  This recipe would probably make a good cookie, but I don't care for it as bread at all.

This bread is amazing. I baked a loaf for Thanksgiving and had to bake another on Saturday because my granddaughter wanted to take some home w/her. I doubled the cranberries which I chopped in my mini chopper (using a knife was waaay too much trouble). Subbed pecans for walnuts (what I had) and had to add a couple extra tablespoons of oj to the batter. My loaf pan was not quite as big as the size called for so I ended up baking it about 10 minutes or so longer with foil on the top to keep it from over browning. It was to die for and my house smelled heavenly while it was baking. I'm going to buy extra cranberries for the freezer so I can bake this whenever I want. Granddaughter wants me to help her make it for her teachers as a Christmas gift. You will not be disappointed in this recipe if you like cranberries.

This bread was much better than I anticipated. I can't stop eating it! I did omit the nuts (hubby not a nut fan) and doubled the fresh cranberries per a review I read. WONDERFUL!! I love the sweet bread and tart cranberries. Will definitely make again (probably tomorrow, this one's near gone).

This is a definate keeper. I did modify by a bit. Instead of sugar, butter or oil in any bread recipe I make, I always replace with a no sugar added applesauce. It cuts down the fat, sugar and calorie intake by quite a bit and is still great tasting. My picky girls and husband all love it! Thank you for such a great recipe!

This is a more dense, crusty, flavorful bread.  I found that adding 1/4 tsp. of cardamom gave it a certain richness.  I will definitely make this bread again.  Can't wait to try it toasted with butter and a cup of tea!

Yum!  This was really good, and I wasn't even sure if I liked this combination.  I did make some changes, based on reviews; I added 1/4 cup extra orange juice and two tbsp plain yogurt, for extra moisture, plus I switched half the flour to whole wheat.  I'm only giving it four stars because I think it would have been dry otherwise.  With these changes, it's 5 star, really tasty!

This recipe is great! We used 1 1/2 cups of wild cranberries. We threw together a honey-orange butter using 1 tblsp of the orange rind, 1/2 cup of butter and 1/4 cup of honey. I will agree with another reviewer that it is much more tart the day of baking. More "orangey" the next day, very soft and smooth, we WILL make this again.

I've been using this recipe for years, since I first saw it in Taste of Home. So easy, lower in fat, no cranberries to chop and delicious! Doesn't get too much better than that.  I also add about 1/3 cup of ground flax in place of a 1/3 cup of the flour for a nutrition boost. Love this recipe!!

Loved this recipe. I, like another reader added 2 cups of chopped cranberries. Makes it a lil less tart when you chop the cranberries. Also I added about 1/2 Cup of dried green cherries to add to that Christmas color.

This was ok, but the batter was way too thick and the result was dry bread. It needs more liquid. I compared it to the recipe on the back of the cranberry package, which turned out to be identical except that it called for 3/4 c of orange juice - so I would recommend increasing the liquid by a 1/4 cup.

Made this for dessert for Mother's Day dinner and our family just loved it. On half the loaf, I spread jam on top when there was about 5 minutes left to bake, it got all bubbly and added a little extra sweetness. I just did that for my kids, I knew they would like it more sweet. My wife and I had our pieces with no jam icing and it was really delicious. The flavour of the orange zest comes through wonderfully. Elaine, thanks for the great recipe!

I liked the flavors of this bread and the tartness the fresh cranberries added.
I omitted the walnuts and the orange peel.  I also used egg replacer and canola oil instead of butter.  I also added some nutmeg.

Great tasting bread!  I coarsely chopped the cranberries before adding to the batter.  The only problem I had was that some of my cranberries turned blueish greenish while baking.  It looked more like a fruitcake when done.  It happened both times when I made with fresh cranberries or the frozen.  Any ideas why this happened?

I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup. Most of my family enjoyed it that way (as did I!), but my husband wished they were sweeter.

This recipe makes a wonderful, moist, tangy bread.  My changes included 2 cups of cranberries and no walnuts.  Also, I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla, just because I do this with all of my breads.  Since I usually make a double batch, I grate the whole orange, and then squeeze what juice I can into a measuring cup, then top it off with Minute-Maid Low Acid orange juice.  I have made both loaves of bread and muffins.  Both come out beautifully!

I made this to use up some left over cranberries from Thanksgiving and it was great! I did add a half a cup of apple sauce and used half brown sugar half white sugar and was very liberal with the fresh cranberries and walnuts. The fresh cranberries make this bread, I would not substitute dried cranberries unless you really don't like the tartness of them fresh.

Good bread but needs more than one cup of sugar. Using only the amount the recipe calls for give the bread a very tart taste. I would make this again but add 1/2 to a cup more sugar.

I used slightly more than 1 cup of dried cranberries, slivered almonds instead of walnuts, and added vanilla to the wet ingredients.  I also made a glaze out of powdered sugar and orange juice and drizzled that over top.  The bread has a wonderful moist but dense texture and is very fruity and flavorful.

I did as someone else suggested and cooked my frozen cranberries just until they popped open before folding them into the batter. I also added about 1/4 tsp of orange extract because I didn't have the orange zest. This bread is *very* good. I'm pleasantly surprised.

Absolutely wonderful bread!  It really hits the spot when you're snowed in during the winter in and has a nice hearty texture.  Orange extract works well if you don't have an orange handy for the peel.  Used 1/2 tsp.  Making it again tomorrow.  This will be a regular until I've used up my cranberries.  Thanks for the recipe!

A fantastic recipe!  After it cools and the flavors set it's perfect!  I made them in mason jars (taken from another recipe on this site) and gave them Christmas gifts.  The whole cranberries make for a gorgeous seasonal presentation through the glass jars.  Had to remake it 3 times, we kept eating them!

I make this into muffins - very good recipe. I forgo the hot water and up the oj to 3/4 cup. I also chop up the cranberries to get berry goodness throughout the muffin. Make sure to bake at 325...I keep burning mine because I'm used to baking muffins at 400!

I love this refreshing Christmas-y bread, though I'm happy to eat it all year round. Double your cranberries for extra tart yumminess. I use kitchen scissors to cut mine up so they're smaller and incorporate better. Cut up slices and serve with strong coffee on Christmas morning. You'll be on the nice list for sure!

Really good!  Made muffins out of it instead of a loaf (portable!)  Used 1/2 cup of orange juice, no zest, and used craisins instead of fresh cranberries.  Watch the cooking time if you do muffins because the first time i made this they came out kinda dry.  Will do again and may try an orange glaze next time.

I took an earlier suggestion and used the orange zest of 2 oranges. I also used the juice of the oranges and added enough water to make 3/4 cup. I want to thank whoever was the first to suggest the extra orange zest. It made the bread tangy and special. My whole family loved it.

This bread is INCREDIBLE!!! What a crowd pleaser! I have added 2x as much zest and a handful of dried cranberries but kept all other ingredients the same. EVERYONE who has it wants the recipe! And now that cranberries are in season, I can't imagine a better time of year to make it! I am making it right now to give as a host-gift when I go to stay over-night with friends this week-end. YUMMY!

This was great! I made it mostly by this recipe but didn't have fresh or frozen cranberries so I used dried and soaked them in water for a couple of hours first, then drained the water out before adding them. I also included about a teaspoon of vanilla & no orange zest.  It was so good, I will be making it again very soon!

This was a great recipe. It was easy and had only a little butter, which is amazing. I would rather use craisins instead of cranberries though. Too tart.

This bread is delicious.  I stayed with the original recipe except I added a tiny amount of vanilla to the wet ingredients and I used orange juice with pulp.  I loved it and gave some to my mom and neighbor and they loved it too.  Great recipe.

I liked this bread, the orange flavor was  wonderful.. but I felt it was a little dry.  I used more butter than called for, and I think I might use even more next time.  I was a little crumbly. More butter would probably make it more moist. Or maybe even sour cream.

The batter is shockingly thick, but the but bread turns out perfect.This is "the Best!" quick bread. I'm so grateful that I put up a few extra bags of cranberries in the freezer this year. They will all go into this bread. :)

pretty good,. not the best i've ever had, but still pretty good. I did make the changes others had recomended, by adding a splash of vanilla and increased the OJ to 3/4 cup. I also made 4 loaves (big family) and in two loaves we chopped the cranberries. Also, mine took a full 60 min, but i did test at 50 just to be sure.

I'm in the UK for a year, but when - surprise of all surprises - I saw fresh cranberries at the store, I knew it was time to make cranberry bread!  My recipe is packed away, so I needed a new one.  This recipe was delicious!! I've made it twice, and it disappeared so quickly I almost didn't get a piece myself :) This will be my new cranberry bread recipe!!

This is a very easy and tasty recipe. The only thing I changed was the walnuts -- I used pecans instead because that's what I had on hand. I put this in pretty bags and ribbon, and gave this to teachers for Thanksgiving. I'm pretty sure I put in the wrong amount of either baking soda or powder too, because I got distracted by the kids while I was mixing this up and couldn't remember how much I'd put in or not put in! It still came out great.

I love the flavors in this recipe! I used the whole cranberries because I do like that tart taste. I also used more OJ (squeezed fresh)..1 cup and added a generous splash of vanilla. I omitted the nuts as I can't tolerate them. I think with the extra OJ it came out very moist and delicious. I certainly will be making this again!

This turned out a little on the dry side for me. If I make it again I will start testing it at 50 min. Unfortunatly I had only dried cranberries which were ok but fresh ones would be better. The orange zest is very nice in this bread.

I wanted these for Chritmas gifts at work so the first time I made the recipe as it was written but the fresh cranberries were a little to tart for my taste. I then made two loaves with "Craisins" and used dried orange peel. These were very good. Also tried toasting it with butter which made it even better. I have glass loaf pans so I'm not sure if that is why my loaves are very brown. The next two double batches I made were baked thoroughly in the middle but slightly sunk in. Not sure what happened there either.After 6 loaves, I still highly recommend this recipe. I'm giving them with a small tub of whipped cream cheese.

I don't think that I reviewed this recipe when I made it but am about to make it to be served as part of refreshments at a conference. Could not think of any better bread to make. Was easy and very delicious. Will use many times. Should add; made as directed. Thanks for the submission.

Delicious!  I must admit that I made few changes, but I would bet this is still delicious as originally submitted.  I omitted the nuts.  I measured two cups of whole fresh cranberries, chopped coarsely, then brought to boil in just enough apple juice to cover, in order to soften and sweeten the berries slightly.  Once boiling, removed from heat and left it covered while measuring other ingredients.  I then drained the berries and used that hot liquid in place of the water.  I added 1 Tbsp of vanilla and used 1cup bread flour and 1 cup all purpose flour.  The result is a delicious moist bread and the cranberries are still a little tart, but not too much. Love it!!

Love this bread!  I made it exactly as stated but chopped the cranberries with the walnuts very coarsely in the food processor.  It is a hearty, nutty bread and with only 1 egg and 2 Tablespoons of butter for the whole load it must be pretty low fat per slice.  Super easy to make!

Good, but not great.  Maybe it is just me, so don't rule this out immediately.  Maybe it's the high altitude I find myself living in (over 6000 feet).  Maybe I simply mixed it too much.  The taste, however, was DELICIOUS.  The fresh cranberry/orange/walnut combination is outstanding.  It's the consistency that left a little to be desired.  Very thick batter (almost like a cookie dough) that didn't "pour" well into the pan.  So, in essence--I love the ingredients, but didn't love the texture of the end product.

Great great recipe!  I've made this twice now: once as written with fresh cranberries, and it was so good.  Today I tried a few things differently-I used blueberries instead of cran, I subbed one of the cups of flour with whole wheat flour, and I added about 1/2 cup of non-fat plain greek yogurt.  I brought it to a ladies luncheon, and watched as everyone had slice after slice!  Thanks!

Just made this last night. I had leftover cranberries and orange from Thanksgiving that I wanted to use somehow. I used about 2 cups of cranberries (that's what I had left) and sliced almonds for the nuts. Came out amazing!!! Will definitely be making again when my folks come out for Christmas!!! Can't believe there's only 2T of butter! It's super moist and delicious!

This bread is delicious! After trying  the recipe by the directions I added a bit of my own to it by replacing half the flour with whole wheat pastry flour, fresh ginger and a little bit of vanilla.
One tip, this is a dense dough, so the outside can look done but the inside still needs some baking, I just starting making them into muffins!

I used whole wheat flour for this otherwise I didn't change a thing. I've been making bread lately (pumpkin, zucchini, sweet pot, etc) to sneak veggies into my 3-year-old. While I LOVE LOVE LOVED this bread as did my husband, friends etc... My 3-year-old spit it out and said "that bread is yucky". Oh well, back to dried cranberries and orange slices. Other than that this is definitely a 5-star recipe!

I've make this every year. I've made regular loaves, mini loaves and muffins.  I always add 2 C cranberries, extra OJ by tablespoons just to moisten the batter a bit and leave out the walnuts.  As muffins they only take about 20 minutes to bake. Always a big hit!

Opted for Muffins instead of bread loaf.  This recipe yielded a dozen muffins.  I baked them for approximately 30 minutes and checked them.  They were already browning I continued baking for another 10 minutes to absolute perfection.  Will definitely make these again and again.

I made muffins instead of bread.  I think orange and cranberries are good when combined.  However I found it very tart,  maybe because I added xtra cranberries to finish up what was left in the bag.

Everyone at our house (LOTS of picky eaters) liked it! so that is 7/7 people who liked this! I gave it as a Christmas present to my friends and dusted the top with powdered sugar to add a fancy touch to it.  It was super quick and great for the holiday season!

I made this yesterday and love it. I made the recipe exactly as written EXCEPT I had to adjust for 7000 ft altitude. That means reducing the amount of the baking powder and baking soda each by 25% and adding 2 teaspoons of water when beating the egg. I did put the glaze with the grand marnier on it after I removed it from the loaf pan, as suggested by a previous reviewer. I was tempted to add a teaspoon of vanilla but didn't and was so pleased with the texture and flavor of this quick bread.

Good! I didn't have access to fresh or frozen cranberries so I used a bit less than 1 cup of dried, and I thought it could have used more.  I also threw in a dash of cinnamon, and might add more next time.  Very good; Co workers loved it!

Yum!  I tried making these into mini loaves and I left them in the oven for 35 mintues which wasn't enough time but the loaf I made in a regular size loaf pan was wonderful so I'll have top play with the time on the mini loaves (they sunk since they were undercooked, booo).  I added a cream cheese frosting to the loaf and served it as part of a brunch and it was so moist and yummy, just perfect tart and sweet, mmmmm.  The only thing that would have made it more wonderful is if I added some chopped candied orange peel to the frosting.

I don't often try a new recipe this time of year but I and so glad I tried this one.  I didn't change a thing.  Today I'm off to the store for more walnuts so I can make more.  This will make great gifts for the neighbors.

This was a big hit with the family.  I made three small loaves and was able to share the great taste.  One of the other reviews said to buy extra cranberries and put in freezer - and I did!

well, it didnt turn out as i expected...the texture & taste wasn't just right. I didn't omit anything from the recipe and i dont' know what happened...I will finish eating it cuz i love cranberries, oranges & walnuts (very healthy!), but i don't think i'll make it again. My bf definitely didn't like it...

This braed tastes great, but the batter is very sticky and somewhat hard to spread evenly. Rated on tasted alone, I'd give it 5 stars.

So good! Word of advice for those of you who are new to the baking thing, do not add more OJ then required! I did this because I read that someone else was going to try to add more to make it more orange tasting. I added only 3/4ths more and it made my bread turn out flat! I tried it again only this time using what the recipe called for and it worked out great!

I followed the suggestions of other members and made the following changes. I added 1/4 cup cooking oil (in addition to the butter), 1/2 cup vanilla yogurt and 3/4 cup organge juice.  The bread turned out moist, but w/o these changes I suspect it would be dry

My experience was virtually identical to another reviewer's - had to bake for nearly 70 minutes, hard crusty outside, dense dry inside. The flavor was pretty good, but I agree that it needed more fat.. possibly another egg? more leavening? Not sure. i'd like to tweak it.

Moist and very flavorful - my only problem was that I doubled the recipe and found that the orange flavor from the grated orange peel was a little too much - almost fruitcakey.  But it's still a good cranberry bread.  I used pecans instead of walnuts, as I prefer those in cranberry bread.

Very delicious!  Just want to let you know that I followed another reviewer's advice and chopped the cranberries.  Then, I let them sit in a little (about 2 Tablespoons) sugar while I made the rest of the batter, adding at the end as the recipe calls for.
 My family loved it!

This is my favorite orange cranberry bread. I add about 1/2 tsp orange flavoring to boost the flavor, and exchange the water for OJ. As others suggest, I rough chop the cranberries. I don't find it too tart, but that's a personal preference

I used dried cranberries because that is what I had. I also added a little yogurt to the batter because it seemed rather dry but I probably added too much since the loaves sank in the middle when cooling. 

UPDATE: I made these again and instead of adding yogurt I grated the peel off of two whole small oranges and then blended them (pith and all) with about 1/8 cup of water in place of the orange juice. I then blended the rest of the wet ingredients in with the oranges in the blender and then combined with the dry ingredients. The result was a moist and deliciously orangey loaf that did not sink. :)

This was good but it was pretty dry so I used 3/4 cup orange juice and 3/4 cup sugar.  I also didn't have any orange so I used clementine peel, it was more fragrant.

great easy quick recipe. I made muffins and it ended up being about 15 muffins total, i filled them up to get a nice top. Also chopped the cranberries in the cuisinart and used pecans. great taste. for muffins-325 for 25-30 minutes. I used a stone muffin pan i have found muffins need to cook a little longer than in the metal.

This bread tasted better than our family recipe.  The crust was crunchy and delicious.  We ground the walnuts to a finer consistency and I think it made the bread even more delicious.  Also, the whole cranberries are wonderful!

The taste of this bread was great, however, it was a very dense bread. Not exactly what I was looking for. I also substituted Craisins for the cranberrries and it was easy and gave it a bit more sweetness!

This was just okay in my opinion.  I followed the recipe as written and found it to be a little cakey and kind of boring.  My husband thought it was like banana bread with cranberries.  I will probably not make it again.

Really liked this...but did not have some of the ingredients.  No cranberries, used craisons instead.  No orange juice but used fresh squeezed with lots of pulp.  Added slivered almonds.  Am looking forward to making it again only with cranberries!

Hubby made this yesterday.  There's just the two of us and it's almost gone so a second loaf is in the oven as I type this lol.  It is wonderful!  He added a little more grated orange than called for and 1/4 cup more cranberries.  Unlike some, we love biting on the tart cranberries.  It is not dry or crumbly at all!  We eat it with a little butter on it.

I loved the flavors of this recipe. I did however have issues w/ it being a little dry. I think it's because I used dried cranberries instead of fresh or frozen ones. Next time I will try it with fresh. I also had to cook it an extra 30 minutes but that was probably because of the atltitude. I live on top of a mountain at 7500 feet. The flavor was fantastic and I will definately try again.

I made this with less orange juice and dried cranberries and it was still quite good, so I'd imagine it's even better with the original ingredients. Unlike when I make banana bread, this cooked through in the time on the recipe and didn't get too dark on the outside.

This bread is so good! I'm living away from home at the moment, so I didn't have a zester for the orange peel and therefore omitted it from the recipe. I also used dried cranberries (that's all I had) and about 1/4 cup extra orange juice. The batter will look thick, but if you follow the directions, it will turn out yummy! This is a keeper.

It's a pretty good recipe, but it wasn't as amazing as I expected after reading the rest of the raving reviews. Perhaps it was my oven, but I baked it for 50 min and it seemed a little overdone (I should have checked before that). I also found it a little bit too sweet, even with the tart cranberries. It does go great with hot cider or citrus tea.

Moist and delicious.  Perfect amount of cranberries and orange.  Not too sweet, and it only demands a small amount of butter.  I had to bake it about 5-10 minutes more than an hour, but it is definately a keeper.

This is a great recipe. I think the more fresh orange peel, the better. I used Craisins as I wasn't able to get organic cranberries when I made it. Very good, will make again.

Tried the recipe using dried cranberries (a little less than 1 cup) and juiced the orange instead of using orange juice as someone suggested.  It hardly rose in the pan, and I had to cook it a total of 70 min for the center to set.  The outside turned out very hard, and the inside is dry and rather dense.  I did use a pretty good sized orange, but it probably needed another 1/4-1/2 cup more liquid.  I think the recipe could also stand a bit more margarin/oil.  The bread is not very sweet, but the flavor was nice and orangy.  All things considered, I'm still looking for the perfect orange-cran bread recipe.

This was great- I'm definitely making this again!! The only changes I made were that I double the amount of cranberries to 2 cups and used pecans rather than walnuts- that's all we had.

Brought to a Christmas breakfast at work - was enjoyed by those that ate it.  Did not go as quickly as I had anticipated.  Very pretty for Christmas!

For this recipe I used all whole wheat flour instead of regular and applesauce instead of butter. I should have added more OJ to the batter because it was so thick in the pan and by the time the inside was done the edges were way over cooked - and I know that wasn't because of the whole wheat flour because I substitute it for regular flour in every recipe I make (except cakes :-) and have never had this problem. All in all this was okay and we won't be throwing the loaf away it was just not good enough to be a repeat recipe.

I start making this bread as soon as cranberries start appearing at the gorcery.  I take it to work, to parties, to family gatherings, and it gets rave reviews everywhere!
