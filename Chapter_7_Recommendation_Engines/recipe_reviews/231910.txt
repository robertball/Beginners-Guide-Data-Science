This was OK--not bad, but not great. The only change I made was to sub zucchini and green pepper for the carrots and peas (I had some from my garden that I needed to use up), but it was the sauce I wasn't crazy about. It was fairly bitter, and it didn't highlight the sweetness of the scallops at all. My 19-month-old ate it with no complaints, though.

Tried this tonight for the first time. Made as directed except I didn't have fresh garlic, only garlic powder. Definitely needs FRESH garlic. Also, didn't have Holland House Sherry cooking wine so I substituted Holland House White cooking wine (3 T) + Red cooking Wine (1T). Might try again, but would definitely use the fresh garlic and larger scallops.

Made for my husband and self: used zucchini and red bell pepper in place of carrots. Used Marsala in place of cooking wine(which has added salt). Added a splash of cream to deepen the flavor; yummy, expect to make again.

Also - used jarred garlic not fresh and also added 1/8 cup white wine to 1/4 cup cabernet red wine since I didnâ€™t have cooking sherry. Also mixed the cornstarch into the wine before soaking the scallops to dissolve the cornstarch. See other review for more info

I didn't have the fresh pea pods, and can't eat onions and garlic, so I subbed peas and carrots and used Jared mushrooms.  It was killer!  The lemon sherry sauce, I added some cream and cheese to and it was off the charts.  Thanks!
