Pretty good, but the butter on top seemed to make them soggy. I like them crisp, so next time I used a butter-flavored cooking spray and they turned out much better. I love dill, so that addition gave it a nice twist, I thought.

This was a pretty yummy and simple recipe. Turned out moist and tender, but a little soggy due to the butter. I used regular milk and a few drops of lemon juice instead of buttermilk.

My kids love this and have been requesting it often.  It reheats great in the oven but not the microwave.

Wonderful. I dipped first in skim milk (no eggs) and used parsley instead of dill. So good. You definitely have to flip halfway through or else they're soggy.  Next time I'll line the pan with aluminum foil. Clean up was a nightmare.

My guests thought these were very good.  I used  Panko Italian bread crumbs.  I also deep fried mine instead of baked them for crispy texture.

These are very good and I did not turn mine and they were fine at 15 min in the oven. This is another great go to recipe. Thank you and I will try the sauce next time. They dont really need sauce.

I didn't think these were worth the work. They weren't even that time consuming-I just felt these weren't much better than breaking open a box of Tyson or Banquet chicken strips.

OK, I screwed up! But, they still turned out great. I ended up making chicken strips "Local" style. That is, here on the Big Island you don't see chicken breast served that much. It is usually thighs and legs! So when I went to the store to get the chicken I bought boneless thighs instead of breasts! LOL!  The spices were right on and the meat was so juicy and tender! served them up with Uncle Bills Sweet and Sour sauce from this site. Great combination. I may even try it with the white meat next time! A Hui Ho!!

Pretty standard recipe (except for the dill).  I usually don't make my chicken fingers with buttermilk, but I had some to use up so I searched and got this recipe.  The other review is correct...don't use butter...use a cooking spray and place the rack higher in the oven.  I also added some balsmic vinger to the egg/buttermilk mixture to bring up the flavor and used italian bread seasoning instead of dill to match the flavors.  Any homemade recipe is way better then buying those frozen patty things!  And you can up the health factor by using whole wheat bread crumbs & lowfat buttermilk.

This was very easy and good.  Not a whole lot of flavor, but the chicken is really moist.  We really liked the parm cheese and dill together...thanks for the post.

Very yummy!  I used dark meat cut into strips and shredded Parmesan rather than the grated.  My kids loved it!  I would definitely make this again.

Made these for my girlfriends when they came over for dinner one night. They were a huge hit, actually my girls couldn't believe that I had actually made them and not bought them. They were so crispy! I ran out of bread crumbs and I didn't have any dill...still awesome! Make them all the time now, soooooooooooo much better than store bought!

Great recipe all around! Definitely a favorite with the family. I use 2% milk instead of buttermilk, panko break crumbs and leave out the dried dill weed.

Very good, fairly easy, and sort of guilt-free considering they're baked instead of fried.  Of course that went out the window once I poured homemade buffalo sauce over them as a Super Bowl appy.  Thank you Uncle Bill!

I was doubtful about the dill weed in the breading, and was tempted to leave it out, but I try to make a recipe as close as possible to how it's written the first time. I'm glad I didn't omit it, as it made all the difference in this recipe. These have fabulous flavor and tenderness. I will confess I did leave off the butter drizzle at the end, and just gave them a light spray with olive oil. That's really all they need. And I did make your sweet and sour sauce, Uncle Bill, to go with these. I would definitely recommend it. Thank you.

These were O.K. but I didn't care for the breading. Left out the butter because I didn't want them to be soggy. Took longer to cook too. Son ate everything I put on his plate though.

I thought this chicken tasted pretty good.  However, I couldn't get it to brown like in the  photos.  I baked it in the oven as the recipe stated.  Any advice for me, I would love to make it again.

Very good. Make sure you season the egg mixer with salt. This helps to give the meat more flavor.

I love this recipe & method!   I only changed it in that I "eyeballed" the measurements, but I know I poured extra buttermilk in the bag. [Oh - I used a gallon bag to squish the egg & knead the buttermilk into the mix - less dishes!] I also let the chicken pieces "soak" for awhile while I tended to other things (checking homework, putting dishes away, etc.).  This was a big hit & I've made it twice now.    One method change:  I brushed some melted butter on the bottom of a 1/2 sheet pan before I put the coated chicken on, then drizzled the rest of the butter on top.  I used my convection setting & baked for longer than called for until I got the browned look I was going for (I flipped a few times), but I think the buttermilk really worked because once 'crispy browned & delicious' on the outside, the meat itself was still very delicate, tender & moist -   My seven year INCREDIBLY PICKY EATER ate really good tonight!  (In spite of the garlic and dill which she is not accustomed to.)

I am giving this recipe five stars although I made some changes (minor?) to the recipe to my liking and scale of my household...I used chicken tenderloins instead of chicken breast. I also dredged the tenderloins in seasoned flour first, then in the egg buttermilk mixture, and finally in seasoned breadcrumbs (seasoned myself with garlic powder, pepper, and other salt free seasonings. I put the tenderloins in a 425F oven for 30 minutes. 5 minutes longer they would have been DRY!!! I digress, I cooked them on a rack sprayed with cooking spray.  I got a little nervous and added a drizzle of butter after I turned them over at 15 minutes.  I didn't need to they were absolutely delicious.Crunchy, flavorful, and tender on the inside...  They didn't need any thing really but I have a grown-up sauce from TJ's that I dipped them in.

My trick here is to roll/dip in melted butter first, skip the buttermilk, then follow the recipe.  The butter will crisp up the chicken in the oven.  Also skip the top butter as well.

These were just okay. A-lot of seasoning and work for not much of a taste. The adults in our household did not like it much and had to dip it in either ranch or bbq sauce to eat it, but the kids in the household just loved it. So maybe it is an adult taste-bud thing (smile). I will say I did add butter to the bottom of my pan and on top of my chicken strips prior to cooking and they did not get soggy at all but came out nice and crisp. I also let them back just a few minutes longer than recommended. Not sure I will make again, I will first try other chicken strip recipes on this site first.

I LOVED THIS RECIPE!!  These were the best chicken strips that I ever tasted (that I can re-call).  The only thing that I would do differently next time is that I probably would cook them on a cooling rack for more of a crispy coating.  However, I did love the moistness of the chicken meat.

We didn't think these were that good.  Too much batter or something also not enough flavor/seasonings.

This was great! I have to say that this was one of the most flavorful chicken dishes that I have gotten from this site. It was moist, yet the outside was crunchy enough. I didn't use as much butter, so the coating didn't get soggy. The dill was great! I served it with baked french fries with cajun seasoning. The two flavors mixed quite well together.

I didn't have 2 pounds of chicken so I halved everything... I increased my oven temp to 425 and cooked for about 5mins longer (I read reviews before cooking and saw that the chicken wasn't crispy). The extra heat and time made them good and crispy even with the butter!!! Will be making this again!

Loved this! After reading reviews, used Panko bread crumbs and skipped the butter all together. Cooked till both sides had some golden brown. This recipe will go in the keep box!

As suggested, I opted for the cooking spray rather than the butter. I also used about 2/3 cup buttermilk instead. Cut up some thighs rather than breasts (were more like nugget shaped).  Read the recipe too quickly and actually soaked the buttermilk/egg mixture with ALL the chicken pieces in a ziploc bag while getting together the rest of the recipe (which I also did the breading in the ziploc ~ VERY easy cleanup :)and saved me ALOT of time, as my day was runing late).  They turned out very moist and family loved it.  Were hardly any leftovers for lunch the next day.  Because the pieces were more chunky, had to cook a bit longer to get them browned.  Did have to put in uppoer oven rack (thanks for suggestion) to get them to brown.  Think I will even go a step further next time and allow the chicken to marinate in the buttermilk/egg mixture a little longer in the refrigerator.

I thought these were pretty good, and my 2.5 yr old twins gobbled them up! I didn't use buttermilk (didn't have any), followed another reviewer's advice and used milk with splash of lemon juice.. also foil lined my dish. I didn't use butter, just sprayed dish well with Pam olive oil, then sprayed the top of the strips with some more.

My family found this "ok". I followed other suggestions-brought the heat up to 425 degrees for 30 minutes; 15 minutes both sides on a sprayed cooling rack on top another rack with aluminum foil. I may try to fry this the next time I make it. Had good flavor.

We made these for a quick dinner the other night and weren't pleased with the end result.  The batter lacked flavour entirely and the butter just ended up making things really soggy.  They weren't terrible, but bland, soggy chicken strips aren't my idea of good food....sorry.

I only had a pound of chicken to cook up, so I did a half batch. One egg, maybe 4 tablespoons of 'buttermilk' (4 TBS of milk to about ½ tsp of vinegar), almost 1½ cups breadcrumbs, maybe 3 tablespoons of Parmesan, a few good shakes of garlic, and a couple shakes of salt and pepper. I added only maybe ½ teaspoon of dried dill so it wouldn't be too dilly. I omitted the butter after reading so many reviews that said it made the strips soggy. It took more like 20 minutes to bake them, and the end result... Well, as my husband stated, "it tastes a lot like Shake 'n Bake... And I don't care for Shake 'n Bake." It was a nice change from deep-fried chicken and I think it would be easy to add different spices for different tastes, but I wasn't totally blown away... One thing I did differently was add two or three shakes of chili powder. It gave it a nice little zing. :) Thanks, Uncle Bill, it wasn't half bad.

I was very underwhelmed by these. While they certainly aren't bad, they were very bland. However, maybe it's better that they're bland since they'll probably be served with a dipping sauce (I used honey mustard) and therefore you won't have competing flavors (but this is a stretch). They are easy to make, and also very tender and juicy, which is a big plus. They'd be good for kids, since they tend to not like food that's outside the ordinary.

My family loves this recipe!  I do agree with of the other comments about the butter, but even then it's still very delicious.  For a little extra kick I add a can of gridded up chipotle to the buttermilk mix.

The first time I made this recipe, it was pretty tasteless. I also did not have parmesan on hand so I put in different cheese which I'm sure changed the taste a little but still would've been bland.  It needed a whole lot more seasonings and with that being said,it has much potential. The second time around, my family raved about it. I used a seasoned bread crumb mixed with penko bread crumbs. I did have parmesan this time and I added seasoning like ceyenne pepper, cumin, chili powder, and more salt and pepper than called for. I also added a 1-2 dashes of hot pepper sauce in the egg  mixture. It wasn't too much because my children who can be picky about spice said nothing about it being spicy but it definitly added that little kick. I baked the chicken then broiled themfor a few minutes to add that crunch. Was a hit the 2nd time around. Just needed more seasoning.

I use a recipe like this often but just use egg dip only and use panko with whatever seasoning you want. Press firmly in to panko mix then fry in olive oil or coconut oil!

i LOVED this.  crunchy enough where it feels like you're eating something fried.  i just used a package of chicken breasts and cut them in half.  i also used 1 C of breadcrumbs instead of the 1.5 it calls for.  there would have been even more wasted had i used the recipe amt.  this will be a regular recipe for sure.

These are quite good. After a few batches, I've substituted parsley flakes for the dill, and use non-stick spray in place of the butter. Think it makes them crisp nicely. Add a little cayenne for a bit of a kick!

We will not make this recipe again.  Not that it's bad, just doesn't have anything that sets it apart from similarly breaded chicken recipes.

This was good, not great but good.  We followed the instructions and the suggestions, but it just wasn't as good as we would have liked...probably best for young eaters with limited taste buds.

Not bad. The flavor was good but despite cutting back on the butter, the breading didn't crisp up nearly as much as I hoped. Next time, I'll take another reviewer's suggestion, and bake them on a cooling rack.

These were good but not excellent, hence the 4 star rating.  My grandkids liked them and gobbled them up.  I liked that these were prepared in the oven instead of frying pan.  Easier clean-up.

This is my first time making homemade strips and I must say that it won't be my last.  I took others advice and didn't drizzle butter.  I also coated the chicken in flour before the egg. I find that the egg sticks better that way.  I added more spices but next time I'm going to add the spices to the flour as I think having them against the meat provides better flavour. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

My husband and I really liked this recipe. Since I needed to serve just my husband and I, I cut the recipe in half and left out the dill weed because I didn't have any. Next time I'll use less garlic powder. Easy
to make and the chicken fingers were moist, tender and a great flavor.

Very simple recipe and the family love it.  We use Italian breadcrumbs and usually cut the breadcrumbs recipe in half as I find there is a lot left over.  There are not crispy by any means but still very tasty. Serve it up with plum or sweet thai sauce.  Leftovers are yummy cold as well.

We have made this several times and it is one of our dinner favourites.   We follow the recipe exactly as shown but use Italian breadcrumbs and will usually just make only half of the breadcrumbs recipe otherwise there is way too much left over.  Served up with some plum/sweet thai sauce. Love it!!

I used Mayonnaise instead of the buttermilk mixture because I didn't have it but these turned out so incredibly yummy, juicy and tender.  I cooked my about an extra 2 minutes.

Easy recipe, and delish! 
I did not use buttermilk. I used regular milk and added a little lemon juice.
I used both fresh and canned parmesan cheese.
I have oven baked and deep fried these chicken strips. The fried is so much better.

I thought the recipe work great. I cooked in my cast iron pan, maybe that helped them crisp up, but cleanup was significant so I will try foil-lined pan next time. Kids loved them, they were great the next day too.

I would add more breading next time and cook for a little longer. They weren't soggy, but they weren't exactly crispy either. Good with a simple sauce, nothing too flavorful.

My daughter, a true chicken fan, liked the strips so well she wanted to serve them at her wedding shower. I prefer more crispness, so I cut back on the butter poured over the top. On the whole, a good taste.

Was looking for a good, easy recipe for chicken strips. Used "Italian" bread-crumbs. Followed previous advice and cut dill to 1/2 tsp. and deep fried for crispy texture. Was nervous about  doing them in the deep fryer but they came out GREAT - perfectly crispy. Used 2 1/2 bag of frozen chicken breasts (5). My 3 young boys and husband all raved. Next  time I would halve the egg/buttermilk as I had a lot left over. I gave four stars because of the adjustments needed.

Wasn't too impressed with this. Taste was good, but I couldn't get it crispy. Put it under the broiler but that didn't help. Probably won't make again.

Can use crumbled saltine crackers in place of bread crumbs.  Leave out the butter if you want crispy chicken strips.  Yummy with any spice/flavoring!
