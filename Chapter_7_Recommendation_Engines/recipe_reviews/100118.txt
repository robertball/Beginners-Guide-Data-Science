Okay, here's how it worked for me.  I made the recipe as it is written using whole milk and got some curds (about 3/4 cup) with remaining liquid that looked like 2% milk, not whey.  It seemed like I could get more out of it, so I cooled the mixture down to room temperature, then heated it to boiling again and added a tablespoon of white vinegar as suggested by another reviewer.  It curdled beautifully leaving a clear whey and more solids than the first attempt.  My advice is to go straight for the vinegar as the acidity of lemons may vary from one to the next.  The paneer tastes excellent with a nice firmness that held its shape when cut.

Paneer is quite easy to make.  Definitely requires whole milk.  One thing this recipe doesn't mention is that the milk has to curdle.  This occurs once you put in the lemon juice.  I have seen it not curdle, perhaps due to less acidic lemons.  Lemon can be substituted with white vinegar, especially if your lemons won't cause it to curdle.  Toss some fresh cracked peppercorns into the curdled milk in the cheese cloth and stir before hanging for peppercorn paneer.

Being an indian, we use regular milk in making paneer.  I am assuming that Dostanden ment to put that in the recipe.  Usually the higher the fat content in milk, the better and more paneer you will get.

the taste was fantastic, but i did not know how much the recipe was supposed to make - i used fat free milk and did not get much out of it (8 servings = apx 6oz of cheese) but i suspect if i use full fat milk, it is going to get a lot more cheese...but the taste is WONDERFUL

Finally!  A paneer recipe that worked!      I made this yesterday and am using it tonight in Rosy's Palak Paneer.
I did read the posts about full-fat milk working better.  Since all I had was 2 percent, I substituted a half pint light cream for 1 cup of the milk.  Also, the yogurt I used was Stoneyfield Organic full fat with cream on top.  So I added a little of the cream from on top of the yogurt ;-)   This did require more than one Tb of lemon juice in order to curdle, but it all comes down to how acidic the lemon is, I guess.
The cheese is DELICIOUS (been nibbling at the curds that stuck to the cheesecloth... LOL) and firm enough to cook.  Thank you SO MUCH for posting this recipe!

This is a great recipe, and so easy to make.  Those of you who couldn't get your milk to curdle, it's possible that you didn't get your milk hot enough.  I only got a tiny bit of cheese the first time through, then I put the milk back in the pan and reheated it.  I didn't add anything extra, I just stirred until I saw the first bubble of a boil.  I poured it through the sieve again, and it worked beautifully!

I have no idea what I am doing wrong, but I tried this recipe twice and I didn't get any cheese. It wouldn't curdle at all. I used whole milk.

Great recipe. I used vinegar instead of lemon juice. I doubled it and got over 300g (about 3/4 of a lb) of cheese from 2L of whole milk. I pressed my paneer under a heavy pan and some cookbooks. I experimented with the paneer when cooking it. I'd seen other recipes that said to fry it before adding it to curries, so I fried half before adding it to my curry and added the other half as is. The frying definitely gave it a chewier texture and helped it keep it's shape better. The cheese was equally tasty both ways. I've also read that the whey can be used in soups and also for making bread, roti or chapatti. Will definitely be making this again. Where I live, paneer isn't available, so I'm very happy to have found this recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Crumbly the first time - allow curdling to take place while heating on medium - might have to add extra lemon juice

I couldn't get it to work. Tasted great (made a great paneer paste!). Hard to get out of the cheescloth. Will try again.

Absolutely outstanding paneer recipe! I made one the other day (first time ever) with milk and yogurt only and it was far less flavorful that this more authentic version. Thank you so much for this keeper!

I actually haven't made this recipe, but wanted to respond to DaraFG.  The probable reason your milk didn't curdle is because you are using Ultra-Pasturized milk or Ultra Heat-Pasturized milk.  UP and UHP milk will not set into curds due to the high pasturization temperature.  I hope this helps.  Milk that says only pasturized on the front will work.  I hope this helps.

Pretty good!  The flavor was great but it didn't make as much as I hoped it would.  Next time, I'll double the recipe.  Also, it was very crumbly, didn't hold together when I cut it which made my Matar Paneer look not so pretty.  But it tasted great!  Maybe I need to work on my technique . . .

I used whole milk and tried the lemons - didn't get much from it.  Trying again with the white vinegar next time to increase the yield.  Since this is the only reason I buy dairy milk at all, I want a bit more than a cup of cheese.  But I like that this had salt added  - it is necessary - but maybe only 1/2 the amount listed.

This makes a really nice consistency, but I've always had to add vinegar.  For a more delicate paneer, I'd suggest trying the simple 8 cups whole milk to 4 cups buttermilk recipe on this site.  I personally prefer the taste of that paneer, but it is very soft and can be hard to work with in a recipe.  I'm not Indian, so I can't comment on the authenticity of the various paneer recipes, but I do love cooking with it.

I'm glad this worked for others. Mine was not very firm in the end - only slightly firmer than ricotta cheese. I'm leaving cheese-making to the experts.
