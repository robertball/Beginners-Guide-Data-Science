I have just decided after 17 years of not eating beef to incorporate beef into my meal to give my children some variety... And  this Sunday was oxtails, which was the very same meal that made me sick and discontinue eating meat... Well this recipe has changed all that.. It was absolutely amazing... The grave had the right flavor, the meat was tender and tasty.... My husband and i were over full.. I applaud the author of this recipe.. It is one of my favs... And although I m not gonna venture into eating beef as consistently, I will definitely make this again... Thank you very much...

I made this again tonight and decided this time to cook it in a cockpot after browning. Still the same great flavor but the meat was even more tender. cooked it about 6 hours and alot of it literally fell off the bone. It was still very tender when made the way it is called for in this recipe. I just can't say enough about this!!

Made this for my husbands bday as oxtails are his favorite meal. Planned on plantains to complete the "Jamaican" theme but plans changed halfway through cooking. The recipe is perfect as is as previously stated. I doubled the recipe for 5 1/2 lbs of oxtails but rain out of marinade, and mixed another single batch. So I recommend tripling for 5 1/2 to 6 lbs. was skeptical about the cayenne at first because I didn't want it too hot, but could stand to use another 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon (or more if u want it spicy). Regardless, the flavor was still good and better the  next day. I imagine marinading for at least a couple hrs prior to cooking would be the icing on this already perfect start! Thanks so much!

I make this dish in my pressure cooker 40 minutes to fall off the bone absolutely to die for tender and delicious. (Tip) add Jerk marinade vacuum seal oxtail 2-3 hours or overnight. Also I like to give a light dusting of floor prior to browning...this will thicken the stock melt 2 tblspn butter for a rich finish to the sauce/gravy. Purely delicious comfort food!

OMG!  These were the BEST oxtails I've ever eaten!  It was my first time cooking oxtails. I've had some pretty good ones at Jamaican restaurants, but because they are so expensive, I wanted to make my own. Wow!  I am so glad I did. I marinated mine overnight in all the ingredients except the bay leaf and broth.. i used about 2 tbs browning sauce because I like mine dark. I also added a couple tablespoons ketchup to the marinade, put the mixture in a large glass bowl, covered it with plastic wrap, and refrigerated it overnight. I removed them from the marinade and cooked them in the oil for a while with the veggies they were marinated in. I discarded any liquid left in the bowl. Afterward, I added the broth and bay leaf and cooked them for about 3 hours until they were fall-off-the-bone tender. I will definitely make these again and again.

People don't know what they are missing by turning up their nose to oxtail. It is one of my favorites and so decadently rich. I made this with a few changes to fit my taste and it came out great. 
  If your  oxtail came out tough, it just needed a longer simmer time. I always simmer my oxtail with water, onions carrots, salt and pepper for a couple hours before I continue with any oxtail recipe.

The vegetables tasted great with the rice and peas and plantains I made, but the meat was just too tough.

The only thing i changed was the herb and garlic seasoning.. i couldnt find it in the supermarket so i used oxtail seasoning instead.. i also cleaned the oxtail with lemon and hot water as i washed them. Then marinated the oxtail overnight... Everyone loved them.. will use this recipie again..

I used a slow cooker after Browning them on the stove and it turned out absolutely amazing! Meat falling off the bone! My daughter and fiance loved it and they are both picky eaters. I only used half the amount of salt but it was great!

I really like this recipe.  To make it better, I’d like to add a few last steps.
Before riseing temp to thicken  sauce  scam fat off the top. Add 1&1/2  tablespoons of cornstarch to a 1/2 cup of water and add to pot. This will give you a better gravy. For more flavor: add 1 cup of red wine and 1 Teaspoon of balsamic vinegar. Now increase temp and cook til thick. Enjoy!!

I attempted for the first time to make oxtails using this recipe.  I only slightly modified it by using a Serrano pepper for heat.  I also misplaced my browning sauce (still can't find it) so I used a stout beer instead to marinate.  Beer or wine is always yummy when cooking meat.  I made my own cilantro lime rice using jasmine rice.  The oxtails went so quickly that I barely got to enjoy leftovers!!!!!! I had plenty of the gravy leftover, so I seared a couple whole chicken breasts and cooked them the same way as the oxtails and threw them in the leftover gravy.  Equally delicious!!!!! I will be making them again this weekend for other family members.

It was good enough for me to stop going to carribbean restaurant to buy this dish. I dont like carrot in my oxtails so i didnot put them at all. The celery has great flavir but i dont like eating it too much. I made 4 lbs of oxtails made 1 1.5 of everythi g in the recipe ingredients except the celery stood the same amount. I also added chopped ginger. Will be one if the recipes i will use in the future. Thanks

The oxtails were delicious. I cooked them in the oven for about 3 hours on 300 degrees instead of on the stovetop. Next time I will put the herbs in a bag.

I grew up on oxtails because I have Jamaican parents. I se to cook it routinely, but have not in some time. Somehow, no matter how I tried it was just average. So I tried this recipe and OMG!!! It does does not taste like there oxtail or yesteryear, it actually taste better. Really enjoyed it. My only chance was to add broad beans.  Great recipe.

I had to make several changes because of dietary restrictions - no sugar, no browning sauce, no Spike ( substituted powdered cumin and coriander, and fresh tarragon and fresh oregano from the herb garden).   Used slow cooker on high for 3.5 hours, since I had to work that afternoon.

This was awesome and the guys raved about it.  No question, we will make it again.

THANK YOU! I try oxtails years ago and I did not like them one bit. the area I live in now has an influx of Jamaican and African residence and restaurants that carry out some popping up and selling this dish like mad. my boyfriend loves oxtails, but they are expensive as a platter can be upwards of $15. although it was a little expensive because I had to buy each and every ingredient, it was still worth it! at least now I have all the secondary ingredients and all I have to do is buy oxtails in the near future. this dish was absolutely on point!

I have enjoyed oxtails in restaurants. I wanted so much to be able to make them on my own. Once I found a reasonable place to purchase  them, I was willing to try this recipe. This recipe overly delighted me and my family! Love, Love , Love this recipe! I did use the tip of dusting the oxtails with a litlle flour for browning and the gravy as well as cook them in a pressure cooker until they were tender. Definitely a keeper!!! Thank you

Are you kidding me? This recipe is absolutely delicious. Two changes... first I started these and my wife brought home take out so I ended up marinating the meat overnight. I think this may have enhanced the flavor. Second, I added a teaspoon of allspice (personal preference) when the vegetables went in. I couldn’t believe how this turned out. I am sitting here eating it remembers some of the BEST oxtail I have ever had and this one is way up there. I have tried to make oxtail 100 times lol and I never figured it out. Even with recipes I just couldn’t get it. I get this though. Thank you for this. I thank you my family thanks you my friends who got to try some thank you as well. This is a wonderful addition to my menu.

This recipe is very good.  My family enjoyed this dish, even my husband agreed this one tasted way better than the recipe he uses and we’re back to me making oxtail dinner.  We used everything but the butter according to the recipe and it came out great, thanks.

I added 1 pound of stew beef cut into 1" pieces and increased the spices by to compensate. The oxtails came out delicious! I will keep this recipe in my arsenal!

I had stew meat in the fridge and decided to use this recipe and it came out amazing!  Will be marinating the meat overnight next time. I had to thicken it up with a roux because it wasnt oxtail.  Everyone that had it loved it will definitely be making this again.

The recipe did not include how much rosemary, bayleaf or thyme were to be used in. it.  This should have been caught by proofreading.  Otherwise, the recipe look VERY good.

I personally do not eat Oxtails; however, everyone I know enjoy them.  The recipe was simple and easy and like with all good cooks, I added a few of may own personal touches.

OxTail was tremendous. I would not boil the veggies and then simmer  3 hours. Just add the veggies raw and simmer for the 3 hours.

This was my 1st time making oxtails and it came out amazing !! Great recipe! Only thing I did different was boil the meat for 2 hours instead of 3 but still came out tender  and used more Soy sauce instead of the browning sauce since I couldn't find it .

This was a really good basic recipe and my first time making oxtails.  I doubled the recipe, trimmed as much fat as I could  and marinated the oxtails with the seasonings and browning sauce (I used lots of browning sauce..I like mine dark) overnight.  The next day I browned the oxtails in a pan. Then sautéed the veggies in the same pan and added the beef broth to scrape the bits from the bottom of the pan.  Then I put everything in a crockpot and cooked it overnight on low.  The oxtails were sooo tender. I’ll definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing!

PS:  This cut of meat produces a LOTS of oil, so be prepared to scoop quite a bit from the top of the pot.

No Worcestershire sauce. No beef broth. Used water to make the gravy base. Prep time after marinating was about 45 min to an hour. I didn't precut my veggies until time to put them in. Not did I wait until the carrots were soft. Everything is simmering together so the veggies don't get mushy.

I have made it twice thus far and plan to make it every time I want ox tails. It is delicious and easy to make. I took the suggestion of another user and marinated it for a few hours before cooking. The second time I substituted carrots for mushrooms because I love mushrooms and beef together.

Made this dish for my family this weekend. It was a huge hit. Oxtail were perfectly seasoned and tender. We will definitely be enjoying it many more times
