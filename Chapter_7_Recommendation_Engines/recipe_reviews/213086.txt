This recipe was excellent!  I bought some fresh jalapeno chicken sausage from a local market and was looking for something different to cook for dinner...I found this recipe and was not disappointed! Everything tasted so fresh and was so easy to put together.  I served this with couscous instead of rice just based on personal preference.  It would have been great with rice as well!  This was a very filling meal!  I served it with grilled vegetables.  The mango and pineapple tasted amazing!  Not too sweet, not too overpowering!  Love love LOVED this and will be making it again!  Can't wait for my leftovers tomorrow!

I make this recipe once a week! I cut down the salsa to 1 cup simply because i prefer a "thicker" sauce and i add a few extra edamamme!  This recipe is fantastic with the al fresco Chipotle Chorizo Chicken Sausage - DELICIOUS!!

So glad to see this recipe on this site. Now I can save it to my recipe box and not have to search the al fresco site for it.  I have made this a few times and we just LOVE it! I don't add the edamame because we don't like it but I bet it works just fine here. I wouldn't change a thing otherwise! Perfect-spicy AND sweet!
Update- ok, so I've started using the edamame and its pretty good in this. I do recommend doubling the sherry because, hey, why not! It makes just that much more "sauce". Yum Yum yummm!

Really good and satisfying! I used Morningstar Italian style vegetarian sausage instead of chicken sausage, and sauteed it with a jalapeno pepper. I also substituted black beans for black soybeans, and parsley for cilantro. Loved the sweet and savory combinations.

My family LOVES this recipe! My husband likes to call it "RQ"...anything he thinks is "restaurant quality" gets that rating! However, I have yet to make this with jalapeno chicken sausage because I haven't been able to get it, so I substitute Chipotle seasoned turkey sausage and it is still good. I also substituted black beans for the black soybeans. Some day if I can find the jalapeno chicken sausage, I will give it a try.

This was delicious!!!  I used fresh sun dried tomato basil chicken sausage from whole foods.   I just cooked it in the oven about 25 mins. since it was uncooked then proceeded with the pan frying.  I sliced it thinner too.  I have never heard of black soy beans so I just used a regular can of black beans.  1 1/2 cups of salsa sounds like a lot but I found out it's really needed for moisture.  The mango kind of mushes up when you eat it in comparison to the pineapple...it's just a texture thing but it didn't bother me.  Great flavor and super easy and quick!

Wow! This is a great dinner recipe! The soy beans add so much great flavor... I did however have to regular sausage instead of jalapeno sausage.. I just wasn't sure if it would be too hot for my kids... but it was still awesome... definitely a keeper!

I crave this meal because it is that good! The fresh mango and pineapple balance the spicy sausage so well! The colors of the different ingredients are beautiful and it's healthy too!

Great recipe! Modified a few things: used deer jalape√±o link sausage that my husband made instead of chicken sausage, used 2 cans of black beans instead of soybeans, and next time I make it(which there will def. be a next time) I will use close to 3 cups salsa.  I had just about doubled this recipe, but would have liked more salsa.

GREAT RECIPE!!!!   OUR PASTOR IS SAMOAN & HE LOVED IT!   To PALLADIN......Get off your high horse & go make your own chicken jalapeno sausage, grow your own mangoes & pineapple & harvest your black soy beans.  Most of us have lives & enjoy making good food for our families.  You should be ashamed for your negativity!

I don't know if it's actually fair to review this considering I used turkey polska kielbsa but I kept everything else the same.  I used a different meat to keep it mild for my kids.  The end result was delicious!

Not a cheap recipe to make, but tasty.  Nice blend of flavors.  I used a spicy andouille type of chicken sausage I found at Whole Foods.  Also served with brown rice instead of the jasmine.  Paired with a dry reisling.  Will make again for my card group this weekend.

My husband (always the skeptic with my  new creations) really, REALLY liked this!  The only thing I would do differently would be to make my salsa ahead of time to allow it to blend the flavors a bit more (I made my own right before making the recipe.)  Also, next time I'll add more jalapeno to it for some more kick (I didn't use the jalapeno chicken sausage, as I couldn't find it.  I used plain ole chicken sausage, so there wasn't much heat.)  Travis (the skeptic) suggested a squirt of lime juice to freshen it up and it was incredibly good.  This is a GREAT summer dish - very filling, but light.  I couldn't find black soybeans, so plain ole black beans had to stand in.  Overall, easy and good for a nice weeknight meal.  And yes, the leftovers are anxiously awaiting my consumption for lunch today.  Hehe.

I've made this twice now. I cook the fruit a bit less than it says so it doesn't get too mushy. The cilantro rice is a must to eat with it.

Easy, quick, and delicious. I added a chopped jalapeno and it added some good spice. I also used canned pineapple and it worked well. Would definitely make it again.

I didn't care for this recipe at all. I have no idea what a black soybean is or where to find one, for that matter. There is no balance to this dish. It's very acidic . . . almost to the point of making you pucker. I am not particularly thrilled with the sausage, either . . . not very sausage-y. I'll try a different tropical dish next time.

I really had high expectations for this recipe given the great reviews.  It was good, but not great... had way too much salsa- the store-bought salsa I  used overtook the taste of the other ingredients.  I will make it again, but probably reduce the salsa by about half or leave it out entirely.  Perhaps I had this problem because I didn't make my own salsa?

This recipe really is a keepr, so simple, flavorful and versatile!  The first time I made this recipe I made as is and served it over brown rice.  Everyone loved it.  The next time I made it, I left out the Edamame and served it as a filling for quesadillas with monterrey jack cheese.  Great recipe!

This was pretty good.  I made some changes, though.  I didn't have a mango, so I skipped it and I used one cup of black beans instead of the soy and edamame.  My husband really enjoyed it.

This was delicious, and even better as a leftover the second day. I have picky eaters who couldn't get enough of this, served on corn tortillas. 

I only had ground chicken sausage, which I sauteed with fresh jalapeno. I agree with other reviews about adding more edamame, both for taste and color. I also had corn on the cob which I sliced off and added in. Yum

Really good.  I used andouille chicken sausage instead of the spicy jalapeno chicken sausage.  I used apple cider vinegar in place of dry sherry. I used 1 can of black beans (rinsed & drained) in place of the edamame and black soybeans.  I followed the instructions exactly except I added the mango and pineapple at the very end, so they wouldn't get overcooked.   I live alone and I love leftovers.  I was concerned that the dish wouldn't reheat well with the mango and pineapple, but it did reheat well.  Will make again.

I made lots of substitutions and omissions because I didn't have all of the ingredients. I used Mango Tandoori Chicken Sausage from Whole Foods and Whole Foods medium chunky salsa. I didn't have pineapple, sherry, edamame or black soybeans. I used black beans instead of soybeans and substituted a coconut balsamic vinegar for the sherry. The coconut balsamic combined really well with the mango, Tandoori and salsa flavors.
