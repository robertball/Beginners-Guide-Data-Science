These beans were very tasty (very similar to the the beans I learned how to make from my granny and mama). My comments: 1) The original poster must have had a saltier ham hock than the ones I get - as other posters have mentioned, I do add more salt. 2) I always use minced, fresh onion rather than onion powder. 3) I never use lard, bacon grease is the way to go. If you don't have a ham hock, you can really just use bacon grease alone. 4) For the reviewers who didn't care for the taste/texture of the beans - these are not haricots vert and are not intended to be crisp. These are southern-style green beans (as indicated by the name of the recipe) and if you like 'em, you like 'em - if you don't, you don't. Some people enjoy both kinds(like me). 5) And finally, if you want to get truly southern, serve these beans with real southern cornbread (NOT the sweet kind), cooked in a cast iron skillet. Don't discard the soup (the pot likker, as my granny would say) and don't discard the ham hock until you've picked the meat off of it and scattered it in the beans. You can also throw some small new potatoes on top of the beans for the last half hour or so.

This is the way I've been making green beans for the last 35 years. Now days, I usually throw them in the crock pot and let them cook all night and all the next day. Add a little bit more salt, cut up some potatoes in them when they're nearly done and you can't ask for anything better.

8/21/04 I did not like this recipe. The flavour was good, but the beans were too over cooked for my liking. They reminded both hubbie and I of canned beans. I don't like canned veggies at all! I did not add the lard, but did add some bacon. I cooked it in the slow cooker for 4 or 5 hours. One good thing, I used the broth to make a nice 15 bean soup...now that was GREAT! = = = = = = = = = = 9/6/04 I just made this recipe again, but did not use a slow cooker. I really liked  it. I used fresh onion and garlic instead of powder and smoked slab bacon instead of lard and a ham hock. I simmered it for about 90 minutes....GREAT!!!! I'm upgrading from 2 stars to 4

This is "almost" the recipe my mother-in-law always used, which my husband's family called "Kentucky Beans". The beans are supposed to be over-cooked and cooked "low". My neighbor once told me, "But, you are cooking all the vitamins away!"  My answer, "I cook evrything else healthy, but I cook these, just because they taste so good!"  I have always "slightly over-peppered" the beans, and omit the salt, because the ham hock makes it un-necessary.

This is a great recipe.  I substituted a 4 ounce block of salt pork for the ham hock because my grocer didn’t have one the day I shopped.  Next time I make this, I’ll probably add half a sweet onion, quartered and separated.  One word of advice:  DON’T use stringless green beans.  They just don’t have the right flavor for this recipe.  Use half-runners for a taste right out of granny’s kitchen.

This is the way to make green beans if you are used to having them limp and cooked to death. That being said, they are delicious! I used bacon instead of ham hock and did not use any other fat. Also, I put in a chopped onion instead of onion power. Cook for as many hours as you have! :-)

This may very well be the best green beans ever! I had forgoten just how great green beans can taste.  My grandmother made green beens like this in the 1950's. She always added cubed potatoes and onions.  I did the same the first time I made these. I also added cubed ham because I didn't have a ham hock. THIS IS HOW GREEN BEANS ARE SUPPOSED TO TASTE! Another time when I made these, I sauted some mushrooms and added to the green beans after they were done.... MMMMMMMM GOOD

This recipe is a great idea, but the cook time is too long, the seasonings need to be increased due to being diluted by the water, and there is no mention of using the meat from the ham hocks in the finished dish. I made the recipe as it is stated, then had to make adjustments to make it taste like something other than greasy canned green beans.

This method is the way I first learned to make beans from my Mamaw years ago. I dice bacon, fry it in the pay, throw the fresh beans in, deglaze the pan with Chicken Stock and small amount of water (add enough to come up about 1/4 of beans.)  Add the seasonings to taste, cover and simmer/steam for approx. 2 hours. Check the seasonings again and serve. This is everyone's favorite way to eat fresh beans. The flavor is excellent. Great Recipe! Thanks for sharing.

My Mom died 15 years ago and my Sister-in-law and I have been trying to re-create her green beans ever since, to no avail. I tried your recipe in the crockpot and the flavor was just really close to hers. What made her's special was, she always forgot them on the back of the stove and they would burn. The flavor was heavenly with a caramalized touch! I made your beans and cooked for 3 hours in the crockpot. Then I put them in Mom's old pot on the back of the stove and left them to simmer for HOURS!. When I smelled the burning start I pulled them off the heat.
PERFECT!!! My entire Family thanks you!

This recipe is pretty good. I did add a few peeled and cubed potatoes, a medium onion and more season salt and salt. It turned out fantastic.

Absolutely delicious green beans!  I used chicken broth instead of water, and salt pork since the grocery store had no ham hocks that day.  I cooked the beans on low in my crock pot for about 4 hours and they were perfect!

My mom has made these green beans for years, with a few minor variations.  She uses canned green beans, although she has used fresh occasionally.  We use a quartered onion instead of the onion powder, a tablespoon of bacon grease instead of the lard, and lots of salt and pepper.  Sometimes she will throw in a couple of slices of bacon, we don't use ham hocks, but they are probably pretty good.   A staple at any family dinner.

I'm from Miami wihcih is not considered the South.   However, my Mother's side of the family is from the South and this is authentic southern green beans.  For those who complain they're too mushy, this isn't the recipe for you.  I love quick stir fired garlicky green beans too but this is what I love at holidays.  Enjoy

This is the way I cook my green beans. However, you only need to cook them on high for about 1 hr; and they will taste even better if you cook them in an iron pot or deep skillet. A true southern cook is never without a good iron skillet! Happy cooking

Good down home green beans. I did make some changes, I substituted season salt for the salt. I increased my seasonings, but similar to other reviewers I felt that keeping the seasonings at the suggested measurement wasn't enough, since the water diluted it. I added minced onions, garlic, and slabbed bacon. I also used cooking oil instead of lard and decreased it to 1 tsp, since my bacon made enough fat.

My family thought these were wonderful, even my stepson who usually won't eat greenbeans.  I changed only a couple things.  I had almost two pounds of beans, but I kept the water the same and it was fine.  I didn't have a hamhock so I used a poound of diced ham.  At first I doubled all the seasoning, but after about 90 minutes, I tasted one and thought it needed more.  So I doubled the seasoning again.  I let them cook about 2.5 hours on med-low and they were perfect.  I don't know if using a hamhock would have helped reduce the amount of seasoning I had to use, so I may try that next time.  Will definitely make again.

I've been making this recipe for awhile now.  I searched and searched for the recipe of how my grandmother made her green beans.  I cannot tell you how much I love these beans.  I'm not a big fan of ham hock so I get a porklette pork shoulder butt.  They are kind of hard to find but the dish is a meal when you add it.  Thanks grneyedmustang!

I thought this was really bland.  Not sure what it needs. I used chicken stock instead of water.   I thought about added a can of fire roasted tomatoes and red potatoes.  I would not make this recipe again without modifying it into something tastier.

Good base recipe, reminds me of my granny's.  We add fresh garlic, diced onions, about a teaspoon of chicken boullion, and diced chunks of one potatoe to the beans.  Simmer for about 1/2 hour, a favorite of ours for decades.

This was pretty darn good. I didn't make it exactly like the original. I had some beef broth that I wanted to use up so I used it instead of the water. and I cooked bacon in the skillet along with some onions and garlic and added that, the grease and all to the crockpot. it was still very good. Thank you!

The only change I made to these was to add extra seasoning salt.  They weren't salty enough for my taste and need a little extra flavor.

I simmered the salted pork (which I substituted for the ham hock) to render out some of the fat before I began. Then I added about 2 cups of chicken stock (that's all I had) in place of the water and about 1 cup of diced onion to the skillet. I omitted the onion powder (because of the diced onions) and finished the dish as instructed. I was trying to copy my favorite green beans from a steak house restaurant, and I think it turned out great. My family thought they were very good. I will use this again.

I made these beans and they were off the hook!!! Even the kids loved them. I did not have a hamhock so I used 3 teaspoons of powdered ham base instead. I had two pounds of beans. These beans were fantastic! They are destined to be a staple for many meals to come...

If you want GREAT SOUTHERN STYLE GREEN BEANS, follow this recipe. My dad's family is from Arkansas, and mom is from Texas. 

These are EXACTLY like my paternal grandma used to make. I was raised on Southern food, and this is the REAL DEAL. The only thing different I did was use real onion instead of onion powder. 

Don't expect crispy green beans. These are DOWN SOUTH as the recipe says. Good old SOUTHERN green beans. 

THANK YOU FOR THE RECIPE!

Good recipe, didn't add the lard or the garlic though, I have to admit.  Cooked the beans with some new potatoes added later in the cooking process.  Yummy!

To be truly southern you would use bacon grease instead of lard, and omit the onion-Then cook until almost falling apart. Remember to add water when it gets low.

Great recipe!  My husband usually does not care for fresh green beans.  He prefers canned.  Made these for dinner and he loved them!  Only change was I used salt pork since I did not have any hamhock.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe turned out awesome. I used 4 lbs. of beans and only 6-8 cups of water ... worked just fine in the slow cooker. I also used smoked ham hocks which added another layer of flavor. Everybody at dinner raved about these beans.

I cooked these in chicken bouillon, added more of the seasonings, bacon grease, onion, and butter.  Knocked the fat content up a noche, but were very good.

This is the ONLY way to cook green beans! My father is a country boy from KY, and this is the way it's done down there.  We use chopped onion instead of onion powder and don't use garlic at all.  I've used cut up bacon strips instead of the ham hock. Also, I've always put everything in the pot, brought it to a boil, then turned it down to a simmer. The longer they cook, the better the flavor (remember the salt/pepper though...the beans can be bland without it).  Enjoy!

I'm from the Midwest where we don't boil the hell out of veggies; my wife is from the South where we do. I promised I would make some  "Southern Country green beans" for her and used this recipe. Her response? "These are better than my mom's".

Great! I doubled the recipe and used frozen green beans, 2 ham hocks, 1/2 lb cooked, chopped bacon and bacon grease as my fat.  I also added 1 diced onion. Cooked in crock pot on low for 8 hrs. Delicious and very soft, tender beans just like my husband likes them

This was AMAZING.  I made a couple of small adjustments based on what was available, but kept it mostly the same.  I made a double order but did not double the water.  (Because you cook it with the lid on, it didn't need additional liquid.)  I used 1/2 of  a minced onion instead of onion powder.  I used sliced ham hock instead of a whole one because that's what my grocery store had in stock.  (The only problem with sliced ham hock is sliced pieces of bones so BEWARE if you use this!)  I served this at a dinner party and everyone RAVED about it.  I'll be making this again and again.  It is a legit southern classic.

I used fresh sliced onion instead of powder and a bit more salt. Cooked for 1.5 hours . Scrape the meat off the hamhock after cooking and add to the beans. Delicious.

This is pretty much how I make mine. I add bacon grease  and a big onion.  Oh and not so much water.

Used to love green beans this way when I was a kid and we went to church suppers, they seemed to always have them.  Thanks for the recipe, I skipped the salt - only because I'm supposed to be low salt.  They came out perfect, I dont usually spend time snapping beans, but it was worth it, thanks for the childhood memory, I'll be using this one plenty more!

This recipe is in regular rotation. I don’t eat pork so I substituted the ham hock and lard with smoked turkey and Crisco All Vegetable shortening but besides that I made the recipe like it written.

I'm not from the South but my husband is.  He was craving his grandmother's green beans.  I found this recipe and gave it try.  He loved them!  He said, "they were delicious."  Thanks!  I will be using again and again.

I too substitute salt pork for the ham hock.  My family loves this recipe and yes the beans are cooked until they are very soft but this is a family favorite.

Absolutely loved this recipe!  Was recently back in Kentucky and as always, I try to eat local recipes vs anything I can get at home. Southern Green Beans were on the menu, so I tried them. They were just like these - soft and flavorful. I used a ham  bone I froze after Christmas dinner as well as a ham steak diced up - outstanding!! One of my family members likes things a little more on the sweet side, so they added a little BBQ sauce. I tasted their version and that was yummy too. This one is a keeper, for sure.

Didn't care for this recipe at all.  The ham hock flavor was too strong - I couldn't taste anything else.  Also, the beans were way too mushy for my taste.

Made these tonight with Southern Living Chicken Fried Steak and gravy, mashed potatoes and cornbread. These were very good! Omitted the ham hock and used a bit less water since I needed these to be done faster. Used a can of Allen's Italian green beans and more bacon grease than called for. Great comfort food! Very tasty!
