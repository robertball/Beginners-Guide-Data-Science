Made this soup with both white and dark meat. Used one 32oz carton of beef stock and 3/4 of an 32oz chicken stock. I added more stuffing because it thickened the soup a little and also gave it more flavor. It is good by itself or over egg noodles which is what I did. I will definitely make this again and itâ€™s a excellent way to use your Thanksgiving leftovers.

I was happy to use up the extra stuffing and give some more body to the turkey soup.  I didn't cook the onion as  there was enough onion flavour in the stock and stuffing.   Used canned tomatoes and dried parsley.  Nice hearty soup with good turkey flavour.  Put the noodles in, but the soup could stand alone without the extra starch item.
