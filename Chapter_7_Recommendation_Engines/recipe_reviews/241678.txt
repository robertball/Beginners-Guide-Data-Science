The flavor is excellent! We like our cauliflower really tender, so we ended up cooking it for closer to 1 hour. I increased the heat to 450 degrees F for the last 10 minutes of cooking, and it turned nicely browned. I brushed the oil mixture onto the outside about 3 times during cooking.

This was a nice change to plain ole cauliflower.  It has bright, lemony flavor with little bit a kick from the Sriracha.  I think my husband's natural inclination to double the amount and mix the Parmesan cheese into the sauce was correct -- otherwise, it doesn't melt and falls off.  The next time, we'll try that method.

instead of making this whole, i cut the cauliflower up into good sized florets and marinated for about 8 hours.. i used 1-2 tbsp oil.. closer to 1/4 cup of bottled lemon juice.. reduced the sriracha, cumin, garlic powder, and montreal steak seasoning by half.. i only had about 1/4 tsp of coriander left but would love to see this with the full amount.. i left out the parm.. we put the florets in a cast iron skillet and cooked it on the grill.. they were very good but it was also good raw.. ty for the recipe

I did like the flavour, but made many changes, so take that into account.  I increased the lemon, decreased the oil, increased the sriracha, decreased both  the cumin and steak seasoning.  I also cut into florettes, and added the parmesan cheese right into the sauce and cooked it into the cauliflower.  This decreased the cooking time, and made it really easy to serve once done.  The flavour was quite nice.

This was very tasty but I would have made more mixture and like the previous review, I would have brushed it on throughout the cooking process. Other than that I would have also cooked it for 1:15 to make it softer.

I don't usually like cauliflower and neither does my husband but this recipe is a winner! We both loved it and is becoming a frequent addition to our diet. The Sriracha and spices made it amazing!

I agree- add more sriracha.

I used vinegar instead of lemon juice.  Didn't have Montreal steak seasoning or parmesan.  Still loved the flavors.

I used a sriracha rub with ketchup, and omitted the steak seasoning.  It was excellent, and I will make it again.  You are right about the presentation.  It is pretty to look at before cutting up.  Thank you!

This is my go to roasted cauliflower recipe!  The spice is just right for us but some might want to adjust.  Otherwise, it’s fast and flavorful!

Easy recipe and a different way to prepare what some think is a boring vegetable...loved the crunch!  I agree that it should be cooked a bit longer....1 hour gave me tenderness and crunch!!!

No changes made to the recipe.  I do like cauliflower and sriracha both, but I didn't care too much for the flavor.  I won't make this again.

Good, but I just didn't love it. This would taste best served with Southwestern-style or Mexican meals since I thought cumin was the predominant flavor, not sriracha. Btw, I followed the recipe exactly as I always do, but did cook for 1 hour 15 minutes to get my medium sized cauliflower tender.

This was a tasty recipe but a little too salty for us.  I would omit the steak seasoning, or at least use less due to salt content, and use fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.   We sliced it the minute it came out of the oven so the parmesan cheese could melt.  We will make this recipe again with the modifications listed above.

It was still under cooked after 50 minutes and the rub falls off when you cut it. Tasty, but has issues

I made it exactly as written and I was not very impressed. It was difficult for me to get the mixture to stick to the head of cauliflower, I had to cook it much longer than directed and I put a sheet of aluminum foil over the top top prevent burning. Not something I would make again.

This is absolutely delicious.  I followed the recipe with one exception.  I used smoked cumin.  The only reason I give it 4 instead of five is that it was undercooked a little and I left it in an extra 10 minutes.  My head was large though so maybe next time I will use a smaller head or cut it into large pieces before I baste.

I wanted the seasoning all through the cauliflower, so I did what another reviewer suggested and threw all the ingredients into a gallon zip lock bag, massaged the bag to mix, then threw large cauliflower florets in to coat. Baked for 30 minutes and it was fantastic, with flavor not just on top.  I used real smashed garlic instead of garlic powder and I didn't have any Montreal, so I used 3/4 tablespoon of seasoned salt and 1/4 tablespoon of Mrs. Dash instead. For the picky eater in our house that doesn't like spicy, a side dip of ranch dressing made it perfect for her. I will definitely be making this again! Very tasty.

Loved the flavor, great way to spice up Boeing cauliflower.    The only thing I would do differently next time is reserve some of the sauce (or make extra) and “baste” it a few times as it cooks.  The sauce all settled at the bottom of the pan and began to darken up as it cooked.

Really loved this as a change!  I chunked the cauliflower, faster to cook and more seasoning on the inside parts.  Next time less Montreal (too salty) less cumin, more sriracha, we like it spicy!

I would give this 6 STARS if I could! Amazing flavor, so good I went  to the store the next day and bought 2 heads of cauliflower for tonight's dinner! I doubled the Siracha and had to improvise for the Montreal Steak Seasoning by  using  All Purpose Seasoned Salt and adding herbs to make it comparable.  I used slightly less olive oil to prevent the "melting off" effect that other reviewers  complained about as well as cooking for one hour It was complete perfection. Thank you so much for this recipe

Very enjoyable and easy recipe.  Follow the directions and it will be an amazing side dish. Cooked 35 minutes on 400 with cooking sheet placed on a low rack level to ensure it softens before it browns.

I love it, especially with my changes that greatly simplify it.
- Use lime juice and zest instead of lemon.
- Precut the cauliflower into bite sized little trees. (I like to just purchase a bag of precut pieces and cut up the largest pieces.) This helps coat more of the veggie with the spicy goodness.
- Put all the ingredients, minus the cheese, in a gallon sized zip lock back and shake vigorously.
- Bake as directed and add the cheese on last as directed.

Enjoy.

Going to try next with Worcestershire, instead of steak seasoning. And I'll double the lemon. Very good as written, too!

Followed the directions exactly for this first try. We really liked it! Lots of different spices on this, but It all worked. Thanks! Now I have to check out other cauliflower recipes since a head is one dollar at our local store!

This one just didn't work for us. Too tangy for our taste.

Very good but I cut the cauliflower into pieces before seasoning. Next time  I would use less of the Montreal Steak seasoning as it was too salty for my taste. To cook,  I place the pieces in a large baggie, add the oil and seasoning, shake to coat  then remove from baggie before placing on parchment on baking sheet.

I didn't like this very much.  It took quite a bit longer to cook, and it pretty much just burned around the outside.

I didn't care for the flavor. I think it was the combination of sriracha and steak seasoning that turned me off. Sriracha tastes a little sweet to me, and it didn't harmonize with the savory seasoning like other combos might, imho.

Delicious but a bit too spicy! Use less sriracha next time.

This was very tasty, even without the steak seasoning. I really liked the lemon!
