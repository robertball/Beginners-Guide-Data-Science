Yummy! This is the cobbler that I remember eating as a child. I baked it in a cast iron skillet and added 1/3 cup quick oats.

10.16.16  Cleaning out the cabinets and ran across a can of peach pie filling which needed to be used up.  So I sub’d the peach for the apple pie filling and cut back on the amount of brown sugar (that’s just a personal taste preference).  IMO there’s one thing wrong with this, and it does affect the outcome of the dessert... the size of the baking dish.  The pie filling barely covered the bottom of the 9x13 baking dish (maybe there's a typo and this should be 2 cans?), and what I ended up with was a dessert that was about 1/2” high and just a bit dry.  This needs to be baked in a much smaller dish, maybe 8x8, so you really get a spoonful of the fruit and the topping.  This is a very easy recipe to make and does taste good, but I think it would be much better if baked in a smaller dish, and that's certainly an easy thing to change.  Emi M, thanks for sharing your family recipe.

I didn’t have any canned pie filling so I made 4 individual servings with canned peaches and 2 with fresh blueberries. I also sprinkled pecan pieces over the top. Only baked these for 30 minutes.

Extremely quick and easy to make. Only changes I made were to use 2 cans of pie filling and to bake it in an 8 by 8 inch pan. This made it look smaller, but it was thick with fruit and very good. So far, everyone who has tried this dessert has really enjoyed it and proclaimed it a “keeper” recipe. Thanks for this one...I’ll be using it often over the years, I’m sure!
