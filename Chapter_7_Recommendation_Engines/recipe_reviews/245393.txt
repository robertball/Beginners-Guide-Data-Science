I used this recipe without adding the milk and used it as a filling for a chocolate cake topped with chocolate buttercream frosting and chopped Reece's Cups

Makes a ton of frosting.  The cream cheese over powers the peanut taste.  Covers really well.  Any left over works great as a dip for pretzel.

I'm confused about the high reviews for this one. I've read the directions over and over again to see what I might have missed but I followed the directions exactly and used JIF creamy pb. The taste was fine but it was gritty and ugly with a terrible texture for frosting. It would have worked for a cupcake filling or maybe the filling on a layer cake but I certainly couldn't have used it to frost the outside! 
To fix it, I added another stick of  butter and 3 more cups of powdered sugar.. This made it become the light fluffy frosting all the other reviews seem to describe..

Turned out great! I wish I had used a little less milk at the end but it still made a great firm frosting.

Following the instructions, I found the texture was gritty. When I frosted the chocolate cake sheet cake I made, it looked so ugly!  (Haha)  I had also baked a chocolate bundt cake. I had about half a cup of frosting leftover. I decided to heat it up and try to use it as a glaze. It slowly heated it, stirring after every 15 seconds, until it was a texture I could pour. I drizzled it onto half of the bundt cake ( some of the kids donâ€™t like peanut butter).   The texture was very pleasant and the flavor was AMAZING!

This has a very strong peanut butter flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly but I ended up adding the remaining 4 oz. of  cream cheese .  I used this for a banana cake and it almost masked the delicate flavor of the cake.  I will make again using less peanut butter and the full 8 oz. of cream cheese.  I'm sure it would be fine on a chocolate cake.

I love that this is nice and fluffy but not too sweet. I used natural peanut butter (nothing added) and did have to add a bit of dairy. I used some half and half I wanted to use up. I also used coconut sugar instead of brown sugar.  Will definitely use this again
