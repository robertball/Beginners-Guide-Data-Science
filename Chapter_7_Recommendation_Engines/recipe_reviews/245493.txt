I used lean beef but it was delicious. It was very lean beef and with the rhubarb feels healthier. I recommend this to all

I used one small can diced tomatoes and one small can of fire roasted tomatoes with green chile's in addition to two very coarsely chopped fresh tomatoes. This is very easy to put together.

I gave this recipe 3 stars because it was good but not really all that special. I was excited to try rhubarb and also the cocoa powder was intriguing but there just wasn't the wow factor I was looking for.

Good but definitely needs more liquid!  I wanted something savory using my garden's rhubarb and came across this.  For the most part, I followed the recipe but found that liquid was needed after adding all the ingredients listed in step 2.  I google'd "rhubarb chili", found other recipes online, and saw they all listed 2 or 3 cups of broth so I added 3 cups chicken broth.  My other changes made due to what I had on hand: 1 pound lean ground beef (rather than turkey); 2 cans of Great Northern Beans (rather than black), 1 can diced tomatoes and halved fresh cherry tomatoes (rather than 2 cans) & 2 smallish ears fresh corn (rather than 1 cup frozen).  Lastly, I increased a few spices a bit for more flavor - 4 garlic cloves & 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper.   Good the first day but better the next.
