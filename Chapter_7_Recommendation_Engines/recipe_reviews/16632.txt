I just made this and it is VERY GOOD.  I made as first instructed and took a taste and found it a little bland, so I did as a few others instructed and put in some mustard.  (I used Dijon and about 2 tsps.  That made it much better!) The olives definately gave it that extra kick that my old recipe was missing!
Loved using the potato masher! Made it so creamy.  Served over lettuce instead of as sandwich, as I'm not a big bread fan! 
I will be making this again!  Thanks!

If you like olives you'll love this egg salad. I leave out the paprika and add a small amount of yellow mustard(only about a teaspoon). I usually dispense with the celery too. But the lettuce is a must. Don't forget to salt and pepper to taste too. I am always a lot more generous with the olives too. I've been making egg and olive salad for years. It's my favorite. When there are non-olive lovers around you can always make your favorite egg salad recipe and then add sliced or chopped olives on the sandwich instead of mixing them into the salad. I used to get egg and olive sandwiches made in a restaurant this way. It tastes just as good.

I Love Egg Salad & I Love Olives but this recipe was terrible. Too much pepper & too much olive.  I wasted all my eggs making a big batch of this.  It was awful. I am sorry.  I was so looking forward to liking it.

This is an old recipe, I have been using a similar recipe from a 1959 cookbook for years (Mary Margaret McBride's Encyclopedia of Cooking): 3 eggs, 1/2 cup celery, 1 TBSP mustard, 2 TBSP mayo, 1/4-1/2 cup chopped olives.  Since I work nights I have to take my lunch to work every day & I pretty much always bring either egg salad or chicken salad sandwiches.  This recipe is very tasty & fast to make.

I’m of the school of thought that when it comes to cooking season to taste!  What is too salty/not enough salt, bland/bold, too peppery/needed pepper varies, depending on whose palate is doing the tasting!  So…if it’s too bland, add some seasoning!  I added pretty much the first thing I grabbed, some Sazon seasoning and a bit of ground mustard, tho’ any number of things I had in my spice cabinet would have worked – Penzey’s Fox Point Seasoning,  Jane’s Krazy Mixed Up Salt, Lawrey’s Seasoned Salt, celery Salt, garlic salt, even Montreal Steak Seasoning – and the list could go on. Seems too peppery?  Again, add it to taste!  Start with a small amount, add more if you like. There are no boo-boos that way.  I didn’t mash the eggs; I prefer my egg salad chunkier, however… if you were going to make canapés with this, on rye rounds, for example, with a garnish of fresh dill or parsley, the mashed version would not only spread better, it would be more fitting and easier to eat as a finger food.  Also, it’s no problem to add more or less mayonnaise to your liking.  I didn’t measure; I just dumped it in there till it was the way I wanted it.  To please both Hubs’ and my palates, I knew we’d like the bite of fresh green onion and the crunch of chopped celery, so I added both.  I’ve never added green olives before (tho’ I recall adding them to AR’s “Mother-in-Law Eggs” and liking them) and, while I may not add them routinely, I did enjoy them for something different than “the usual.”

i found this a good basic recipe to work with. You could add mustard, or celery etc to it to add some variety to it. 
I'm not fond of olives in the salad ( it was worth trying anyways). For myself, i would only use real mayo- i feel that miracle whip ( and other subs)would not do this recipe justice.

This was a very good recipe for egg salad.  The potato masher is a nice idea.  I am not a big fan of green olives but they taste great in here and I think the recipe could use even a little more.  Thanks Stacey!

I thought it was really good.  I didn't follow the instructions given to make the eggs, so I have no comment on those (I just made them the way I always make them).  I think the kids will even like it because they love olives. Thanks for the recipe.

I tried this recipe yesterday after a craving for egg salad, no celery.  I do love olives and never thought of adding any.  I did add a bit of Dijon mustard and mixed with LF mayo.  I served on romaine like others suggested.  It was the best and no bread??  even better!  Thanks!

I hate giving low ratings, but this just isn't the egg salad I expected and my husband loves egg salad.  I liked the idea of mashing the eggs vs. chopping and the idea of green olives.  He loves both so I thought it would be worth a try.  After looking the recipe over there's way too much pepper.  I cut that down to 1/4 tsp.  This had no flavor so I added some chopped green onion and dijon mustard.  It saved it a little, but not much.  It's more like a spread than a salad.  I'm going back to Jen's Heavenly Egg Salad as my standard.

Thought this was a great base recipe, but made a few additions.  I added a little dijon mustard, a few dashes of tabasco, some dill weed, and some lemon juice.  It made fantastic sanwhiches, or just all by it's self.  I will definatly make this again.

GREAT RECIPE!  We love olives so I knew this would be a hit.  I skipped the paprika and added a little Gulden's mustard.  I did not mash the eggs as we like them chopped.  I added the chopped olives to taste rather than measuring them.  This was so good!  Next time I think I will add some chopped onion.  Thank you OLIVIES for sharing your recipe.

I grew up on this recipe minus the paprika and pepper. The more olives the better! I don't even like green olives!  Just put a glob of mayo to your preferred creaminess in with the chopped eggs, add chopped olives, start with a little and add to taste. For even more flavor add a little of the olive juice! No salt needed!! I just wish it was filling.

A good base, but felt it needed more spice.  I added a teaspoon of paprika, doubled the black pepper, a half tsp of cajun seasonings, and a finely chopped rib of celery and a green onion.

This is the recipe I grew up eating with the exception of the paprika. If you're like me and love Spanish olives, you'll love this recipe - I always wind up popping about 4 olives into my mouth while cutting the others for the salad!

This is a good variant on an old favorite- the paprika is a nice, subtle addition. The olives add some salt, but you may want to add a little more. (I did!)  Like all egg salad, it gets even better after it's had an hour or so to mellow in the fridge. If you can wait, that is...

This is, without a doubt, the best egg salad I have ever had.  The ingredients are simple, the results amazing.  The only change I made was to add a dash of worstershire sauce. All other egg salads pale in comparison -- Thanks, Stacey!

What a suprise!  This was good!  I've done this one several times now and it's now in my personal cook book.  :)  The olives were a nice change to the more "common" egg salads!

FINALLY! My mother made this and I grew up knowing only this kind of egg salad, which she called "Egg and Olive"! I've never had an actual recipe, as she and I just made it to taste. This recipe will come in handy as I pass it around to relatives and friends!

Was looking for something different for egg salad and came across this recipe. Liking olives, I gave it a try. Great! I did add chopped celery as I like the flavor and added crunch. Will definitely make again.

I have always made my egg salad with spanish olives (the ones in this recipe). And, I've always used my potato masher to stomp the eggs because I couldn't stand to have big chunks of egg whites. This recipe is good, but I guess it's the same one I've been using forever.

YUMMM!!!! This was a delicious break from the norm. I added a little mustard to suit my taste and doubled the amount of olives and it was absolutely delicious. This is definitely my new standard egg salad recipe. Thanks!

In one word "delicious". I didnt have pickle relish on hand and found this recipe. I never realized that egg salad had variations, I was skeptical about the olives but it is great with crackers Thumbs up!

I was looking for something different to do with Egg Salad.  Loving olives made me think this would be interesting.  I was skeptical when it came time to actually put the chopped olives into the egg mixture, but I did it anyway.  I'm afraid its just not to our taste.  I ended up putting in diced celery and alot more paprika to try to perk it up.  Sadly, that may have made it worse.  Oh well, back to my same old boring recipe.  Thanks for posting anyway...I'm glad I at least tried it.

I made this as is and test tasted it to make sure is was suitable to out tastes. I love the idea of putting green olives in but it wasn't so good. Not enough crunchines and bland. Thankfully I was able to fix this by adding onion, celery, green pepper, a little mustard and about 1/2 a tsp of garlic salt. Turned out great after that as is the repcipe just isn't the greatest for us, it has a good base just needs some modifications to make a good egg salad sandwhich.

First egg salad I've ever made.
I hit it with a bit of mustard. It really tasted good.  I think it is the olives.  I will make again.

I made this without the olives, because I didn't have any and added pickle relish and mustard instead.  I thought it needed salt...  I think with the olives this would be just perfect and can't wait to try it again!

For such a SUPER SIMPLE egg salad recipe, this was VERY, VERY GOOD.  I made 1/2 of it to serve 2, and it made more than 1 cup, even before I added about 1/4 cup chopped celery.  I deleted the lettuce (didn't have any).  This was DELICIOUS.  (I cooked the eggs my old-fashioned way: cover them with cold water, rapidly bring them to a boil, boil them rapidly for 13 minutes, and then immediately cool them in ice water.  They peel wonderfully every time.)

This was excellent, with the green olives being a nice and different addition. After reading some of the reviews, for extra flavor I also added small amounts of garlic powder and Montreal Steak seasoning, and some chopped celery. I usually don't mash egg salad, so I left it chunky. Thanks OLIVIES for great recipe!

I grew up with this as a staple from both my mother and grandmother. We always add just a touch of yellow mustard. It was made in small batches too, 2 eggs at a time usually and way less mayo. I think maybe 1 and 1/2 tsp max.

Probably my favorite egg salad recipe ever! Creamy and chunky, but not too much of either. The olives were also unique, but the recipe holds its own without them too.

I tried this recipe because it was published in the cookbook. I figured it must be great! I didn't think much of it. It was mushy, and rather bland. I did doctor it up with several other spices and that helped. I just think at that point you are creating a new recipe and not using the one provided. Not my thing at all. If you like very bland and creamy egg salad this may be right for you.

My husband said 5 stars but my son and I agree on 4 stars.  I would make it again but I would probable add celery for a little crunch and extra flavor.

I love eggs.  I scaled this recipe down since it was just me eating this and I added a few more spices to suit my taste. I did not have the olives, so I left them out and I did add a little mustard along with the mayo since I've always made it that way. Thanks for sharing Stacey.

I was fortunate enough to have spent four days in Augusta at the Masters recently and lived off of the egg salad sandwiches they serve.  I have been searching for a recipe similar ever since.  This is not what I have been looking for but it is very, very good.  I love black pepper more than most...as well as green olives, but unless you really pour on the pepper in your other dishes, you may want to ease back a shade.  I will definitely make this again.

This is a great, and extremely easy to make egg salad recipe.  My family loves green olives, so we added a bit more.  Add a little lettuce on the sandwich, and it is absolutely delicious!!!

This is a pretty good egg salad, I made it exactly as written.  It was lacking a little "zip", though, and I added a tablespoon or so of relish after I tasted the finished product, and that helped.  I think next time I'll make it with miracle whip, and it will be a 5 star recipe then!

My BF made this recipe and being an olive fiend, he added additional olives.  We both really enjoyed it but he had used sliced olives and I thought that next time, we should chop up the olives so that they're spread throughout the salad instead of having concentrated bites.  But definitely the egg salad recipe we'll use from now on.

I love the addition of the Spanish olives.  I tasted it as the recipe is... and felt it needed a little something more.  So I added 1 TBLS Djoin mustard, 1/4 cup of minced celery, and three chopped scallions.  Then is was perfect to my liking.

This  is a great and simple recipe.....loved the olives. I also added dijon  mustard, chopped celery, onion &  peperoncino for more texture & flavor. Great as stuffing for tomatoe or on bed of lettuce.  Will make many more times.

I don't like green olives either but I don't make egg salad without them. This recipe is how I make it., almost.  I didn't use nearly as much pepper  but what took it over the top for me was the mustard.  I used about a half  teaspoon of plain old salad mustard.  Never thought of it before.  To prepare, I use an egg slicer,  Slice first, then turn the egg and dice.  I have a little egg masher to finish it off.   This is a really good recipe.

Like what I make minus the paprika , but I like chunks of egg, so I just cut the eggs in 1/8's .   I cut the olives in 1/4's. I add a little of the liquid from the olives too, maybe a tablespoon.  When you mix in the mayo the eggs will break up a little more. If you mix too hard you won't have any chunks of egg left.  The yolks pretty much disappear during the mixing.

Very good recipe, I omitted the olives because I dont like them. But the paprika gave it a nice touch. Use salt and pepper to your taste, adding a little bit at a time.

This is REALLY tasty!  I made it true to recipe, except I added about a tablespoon of yellow mustard and threw in some extra olives & juice!  Delish!

We loved it.  A little different than I usually make.  Will use again.
