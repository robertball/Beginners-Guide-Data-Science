The flavor of this was okay, but I found it to be way too strong. I even cut the amount of brandy in half and didn't even use the rum! Maybe, I am just not an avid drinker. I found the brandy to be a flavor, that is rather strong to begin with. Maybe, I would have liked this better with amaretto. It is a sweet almond flavore. It seems it would have been more appropriate to.

A delicious warm winter comfort drink; for someone who has sensitivities to milk, this makes a great alternative to both hot buttered rum and eggnog. As is, I would rate 4 stars, but as I played with the recipe to my personal taste, it became a 5 star hit. For a milder taste, I omitted the cinnamon and rum, and used 3 oz of brandy. Some almond milk has less of a vanilla taste than others, so occasionally I will add 1/4 tsp vanilla extract.  This could also satisfy as a 3-star alternative to spiked hot chocolate.

A wonderful, lighter alternative to traditional eggnog for the holidays.

I used regular 2% milk in this recipe and added a touch of almond flavoring only because I do not drink almond milk. This was enough for one big serving as my husband opted out. Very good. Nice twist on a hot milk before bed.
