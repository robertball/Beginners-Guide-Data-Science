Very easy to make. I was surprised by how wonderful it tastes, considering how easy it was to make. This will become a staple for me.

We did not make any changes . We cooked it a little longer in the insta pot.  Extra 25 minutes. It tasted a little on the sweet side. It was still good . My family loved it. If I could make for myself I would make with HOT Spicy Sausage. My family doesn’t like Spicy!! Thank you for the recipe it was easier then cabbage rolls. GOD BLESS!!

I didn't use pork at all just 2lb. ground chuck. I used 2, 1lb.bags of brown rice and 1 jar of Fire Roasted (Bertolli)  pasta sauce, and a 24oz.can of diced tomatoes with basil and garlic. The taste is great and very filling! Loved it and everyone who has tasted it Love it also ! I will be making it again !

I made this recipe with very little variation (added a sprinkle of red pepper flakes as we like a little heat). Wonderful recipe! This will be a regular in my soup rotation. Highly recommend.

This was great.  Made enough for leftovers.  Next time I will only put  1/2 the brown sugar as it was a little sweet for me. Hubbie LOVED it!

We loved this. I looked for a cabbage soup recipe because I had a bag of fresh shredded cabbage packaged to make Cole slaw from, and didn't want coleslaw anymore. It was perfect.

I had to make a few adjustments because of grocery shortages (no rice- but I had instant rice) - still turned out very well.  Definitely a keeper and "go to" soup for the future.

I made his today on my stove.  It was EXCELLENT.  
After I put the rice grains in, I just kept it simmering until they got done.  I used mild Italian sausage (gound bulk)
