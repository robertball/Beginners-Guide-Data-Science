This is a great recipe! I made some changes like I used 1 pound of beef, 1 whole green pepper, 1 whole onion, 1 clove of garlic, half a tub of the cooking creme, and 2 cups of mozzarella cheese.  It turns out great I am going to use this recipe a lot Thanks!

While cooking the ground beef, I seasoned it with ital. seasoning, oregano, garlic powder and pepper. I also added a can of petite diced tomatoes with green chiles. I used more mozz. cheese than the recipe called for (I like it cheesy). And this was delicious. Definitely adding it to the menu rotation.

I love creamy pasta. This was delicious! I am a vegetarian, so I used Morningstar Farms chopped meat. Fabulous!

This was a lot better than I thought it would be. Pretty much followed the recipe exactly, but used 1/3 less fat Italian Cheese & Herb cooking creme. I cook for my sister and she liked it, so that's what's most important to me.

Delicious! Subbed italian sausage for the ground beef & mixed all the cooking creme into the sauce, then topped with remaining mozzarella. Also, I baked it uncovered - there isn't really any need to cover if the pasta's freshly cooked and the sauce is already hot.

Made this last night and it was great, I used some frozen meatballs we had instead of the ground beef and substituted 8oz of cream cheese for the cooking creme. It turned out great! It was even really good reheated today for lunch. Thanks for the easy, quick and versatile recipe. It can be used so many ways.

This was fab!  I eliminated the beef and made this vegetarian.  Also used parmesen with the mozzarella.  Held very well in a chaffing dish for my buffet.  A real keeper!

I've tried several of the Phila cooking creme recipes, and this is one of the better ones. It's a simple, straightforward comfort food classic. Obviously not for those of us on a diet! The baked penne turned out very delicious. I would make this again.

This is a great, classic Italian dish! The Philly cooking creme was a great touch! I didn't use the entire amount (only used about 1/2 cup and none on top) because my husband is not crazy about real creamy dishes and it was still wonderful! Even my picky husband liked it! Next time I might add a little more meat or try with sausage as others recommended. Thanks for sharing!

Very good!  Husband REALLY like it.  I seasoned the beef a bit....italian seasonings and garlic powderand browned with onions and green peppers, then drained grease before adding sauce.   Other than that, followed recipe.  After adding mixture to casserole dish, I covered and refrigerated until dinner time.  Baked probably 40-45.  Fast and delicious and I really like the fact that I can prepare ahead of time.

This was an excellent recipe that allowed me to use the box of penne pasta that was sitting in my pantry, but I do feel it lacked a little in the flavor department.   I would make it again but next time I will add more to the meat sauce before baking.

My daughter requested penne and sauce as her last meal before leaving for college.  Decided that this sounded like something my husband might like as well since penne usually isn't his thing. Huge hit with both girls (rarely happens) and my husband.  I did add some fresh basil and used only half of the cooking creme, chosing not to add it to the top.  I actually put it into two smaller pans and froze the second pan for my husband and I after work some night since we are now empty nesters.

This was really a wonderful meal!! My family loved it!!  Unknowingly, my daughter had made the same thing for her husband! Her recipe was alot more complicated and called for things that she didn't have in her cupboards. I told her to come to Allrecipes!! This was simple and delicious!! I added more mozzarella cheese. But besides that it was perfecto!!

Oh my word...I must admit, I made this recipe only expecting it to be "okay."  Wow, was I blown away!  It was incredible!!  My husband tells me that this recipe is going on our list of "recipes to impress" for when we have company.  I'll just be sure not to tell company how easy it is to make! :)
I didn't make a single change to this recipe, and it turned out great.  Thanks for sharing!

This was delicious!  We didn't change it at all, just baked it as is.  I think it could use a bit more seasoning-- perhaps more garlic.

This recipe was tasty however it lacked some flavor.  I prefer my food to be a bit more seasoned, otherwise it was good.

This was excellent!  It turned spaghetti night into a treat!  I may have added slightly more onion than the recipe called for, but otherwise I didn't change a thing.  Will definitely make this again.

They no longer make that cooking cream. So I had to substitute with one tub of cream cheese, two tablespoons of milk, and two tablespoons of Italian seasoning. That was Kraft's suggestion for substituting. I used a little more green peppers and less onions. I loved it, my husband said it was "okay" but he's not a big fan of peppers or onions.

Just finished making this, it was good but I found it a little rich. I wouldn't say it makes 6 servings more like 4 if that. I added 5 cups of pasta instead of 3 & mixed all of the cooking creme in the meal rather than using some on top. I plan on making this again with the following changes: 1 13.25 box whole wheat penne pasta, 1 lb ground beef, 1 cup each chopped onions & green pepper, 2- 24 oz jars tomato sauce, 1 15 oz tub cooking creme, 2 cups of mozzarella cheese.

Not bad but not a favorite. The herbs in the cooking creme are a tad overwhelming.

Did this almost exactly as written. The only ingredient I changed was doubling the meat to a total of 1 pound, since that is what I had defrosted. I made this a day in advance and stuck it in the fridge overnight so all we had to do was throw it in the oven for a weeknight meal. Both my husband and my son went back for seconds! So this was a total win. Worked perfect as a make-ahead meal too.

I used a mix of red, yellow and orange peppers in this recipe and threw in 8 ounces of chopped mushrooms and some fresh minced garlic. After tasting the sauce, I did add some italian seasoning to goose it up a bit. Everyone really liked it--NO leftovers. Very simple dinner to throw together.

This is my first experience with using the Cooking Creme.  While it was a time saver, it wasn't my favorite.  I have another penne recipe using regular cream cheese mixed with sour cream and sliced green onions mixed together.  I like that better.  Using the "quick stuff" was quick, but not necessarily better for my personal taste.  Overall, though, a good recipe that many will probably enjoy.

Awesome! All I added was a little more spice, some portabello's, a little parm and some garlic. My husband said "WOW!" (He is hard to please...) So In my opinion this is an awesome recipe! Thank you!

Very good dish.  I made my own sauce rather than use jar sauce.  Gives it a much better flavor.

Made this for supper and it was a hit! I made 4 cups ziti noodles with 2lbs beef browned with onion; a jar of drained mushrooms, 8oz of cream cheese (heated/melted), combined with 1 cup of mozzarella, cheddar and a large jar of Prego spaghetti sauce and let it simmer for a few minutes. I added Lawry's, garlic powder, salt/pepper to the meat as it browned for additional flavor. Combined the sauce mixture with the noodles and topped with a cup of mozzarella and sprinkled some parmesan - served it with garlic bread. Will make this again!

I didn't have the cooking creme so I used 4 oz of cream cheese instead, 1/2 cup of shredded cheese and fajita seasoning. It tasted good, but next time I think I'll try using less cream cheese as I wanted to taste more of the spaghetti sauce.  Definitely going to make this again.

Even though boyfriend hates cream cheese flavor, he loved this.  Though taking his taste into account next time i'm gonna leave out the cooking cream and try 2 cups of milk double cheese and added seasonings. great recipe!

I really enjoyed this dish. It was easy to make and has a great flavor to it. The Philadelphia Italian cheese and herbs cooking cream added a nice taste to the sauce. I will definitely use this recipe many times.

This recipe was really good and very easy to make. The only thing that I didn't like is that in the ingredients you are supposed to have 3 c. of hot noodles, like you just have those on hand. It does not add the time it takes to cook the noodles into the total cooking time nor does it tell you to cook them anywhere. I got the sauce completely done, and then saw that the noodles were supposed to be already cooked. Other than that, it was very delicious!

My family really liked this. The only thing I changed was I used a full pound of hamburger.  I think would like less meat next time so 1/2 lb. I want to try it with ground turkey. Used whole wheat penne.
I think this would be yummy with shrimp!

This turned out pretty good, but I added some shredded carrots and fresh parsley to the recipe. Left out the beef since I don't eat it. Great basic baked penne.

This was excellent! I did, however, make a few modifications... my grocery store did not have the Italian Seasoning cooking creme so I substituted the Tomato Basil in its stead (to make it more "season-y" I added some added minced garlic and herbs de provence to the meat so the tomato flavor wasn't overwhelming); I used 1.25 lbs of ground turkey instead of a half pound of beef (which came out deliciously); I used the equivalent of dry chopped onions to the fresh chopped onion (2 tbsp); and I used around 4 cups of pasta instead of the 3---and it turned out great. My fiance and I loved it! A caution, though---it makes a ton of leftovers for two people! Which, in the case of this dish's superior deliciousness, I totally did not mind :)

Wow I just made this with Italian turkey sausage and added minced garlic, oregano, and red peppers... No need to cover in the oven.  Came out super excellent!  Next time I will add mushrooms and maybe cut down on the cooking cream as it was a bit over-powering.  I can't believe I just baked this... Tastes like I got takeout from an expensive Italian restaurant!

Awesome and simple! :) I decided to substitute italian sausage (a mix of sweet and mild) and it turned out fabulously! My husband is a huge fan and it's super simple for the kiddos. You can easily spice it up if you're a fan of spicy foods. Definitely give this a try!

Being Canadian,  we don't have access to some delicacies that our neighbours down south have. Since we don't have Italian Cheese and Herb cooking cream, I just used a small container of regular Philly Cream Cheese and seasoned the  out of this with Italian spices.  My whole family loved it! My 18 month old kept vigorously signing "more"! Cant wait to try it next time with Herb and Garlic cream cheese and some freshly grated parmesan.

Say goodbye to those expensive bag dinners that are similar to this dish!  I don't think they even make the cooking cream anymore, but who cares?   I used about 8oz of regular cream cheese, 1 can of  diced tomatoes (slightly drained), 1 small can of mushrooms, and a pack of mild Italian turkey sausages (removed casing and mashed them up while cooking) instead of ground beef.  I also added a bit more seasoning - garlic powder  and oregano, a dash of red pepper flakes. I topped it with a bit more mozzarella and  WOW!  Super easy and delicious.  This recipe also keeps well for a couple of days of leftovers on busy nights.  This one is a winner!

I made it but I used a block of cream cheese, added more cheese on top. It was a hit with my picky family.  This recipe is a perfect amount of food with very little leftover, plus it's still tastes great as leftovers.

Great, easy family dinner. Switched out a few ingredients as the notes suggested: pork for burger, cheddar for mozzarella, and plain cream cheese for crime. This is a great way to bring a creamy-ness to a red sauce. We'll be using this again!

Decided to make this for the Mr. Because I was too afraid to make lasagna... don't judge me, I'm a horrible cook. I had to substitute the Philadelphia spread from the recipe because apparently Philly doesn't make it anymore. No problem though, I just got regular cream cheese and Italian seasoning (Something Philadelphia suggested as a replacement) tasted just as good. So I browned the beef, put the onions and peppers in along with salt and pepper and ohhh my goodness it was smelling wonderful. My noodles were almost done as I added my cream cheese and mozzarella cheese. I dumped my noodles into a baking dish and mixed in my beef/cheese mix and added more mozzarella on top then baked it. When it came out it smelled great, I took a bite and... well I was disappointed. I was frustrated and a little upset because it just tasted bland. As I stood in front of my oven wondering how I was going to feed this to my hardworking man I look to my right and realized I did not put the pasta sauce in the meal!  y'all the excuses I came up with as to why dinner would be another twenty minutes. I dumped it all back in a pan, added my sauce and then served it to him and it was great!! The recipe, when made properly, is easy and just plain good leftovers as well.  I would absolutely make this again and and add a nice salad to go along with it!

This is a great recipe! It's very easy to make, tastes great, and leaves you with big portions. I made one small change; instead of using the cooking cream, I mixed an 8 oz tub of cream cheese with 2 tablespoons of milk. I also added some extra mozzarella, following the advice of many others on the forum.

Very good recipe. The only thing I had to change was the flavor of creme cheese because the store didn't have the same favor. I also omitted the pepper. My kids and husband really enjoyed the dish.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I substituted cream cheese for the Philly cream,  used Raos Arrabbiata Pasta Sauce, 1 can diced tomatoes, Italian seasoning, dried parsley, oregano and extra veggies (peppers and onions) as well as added a small amount of parmesan cheese and it was wonderful!

Very good and easy!  I doubled it and stirred in a block of cream cheese and a little italian seasoning since I didn't have the cooking cream it called for.  I also didn't use the green peppers since we don't like them.  It was really, really good!

I added a layer of pepperoni before I sprinkled the cheese and it was wonderful.

This was delicious!  I did not use the cooking cream, but used some cream with parmesan and more mozzerella.

My family ate all of this in two day!! It was a big hit, I will for sure make this in the future. I made some changes to the recipe. I used twice as much meat and noodles, substituted butter for the cooking creme and used orange peppers instead of green. It was very easy to make, didn't take very long and was very tasty!

This was delicioso!  I added cilantro and garlic along with the following spices (oregano, cumin, basil, parsley).  I also used media crema (Hispanic isle) since I couldn't find the Philadelphia cooking creme.  Love it.

This is an awesome recipe.  I made it for a Community Dinner, so used the recipe for 120 servings and received many many compliments on it.  We mixed pork sausage with the hamburger and added more seasonings to it.  Yummy!

Loved this.  Like others suggested I used sausage instead, and I used a whole pound to give it more protein.  Will be making this again!  It heated up very well for lunch the next day.
