Awesome recipe! Perfect timing! Also, for those using an instant pot, as per one of the other reviewers.  There is not an error with the recipe. The  OP does mean 2 minutes and then leave the release pressure alone for 15 minutes. ( Which means do not release the air ). I did mine for 5 minutes on high pressure, and 10 minutes natural release. The meat was perfect! I think we will all add a pinch of salt for taste depending on the curry paste and milk used. I had to add a little to mine but wait till the end to do this.  Highly recommend this recipe, it will be my go to now and of course my base recipe, I may tweak it where desired! 

So, I have no photo as the pot was licked clean before I got to my plate of FOOD! Next dish I will try to upload a photo, oh and I added a few tablespoons of heavy whipping cream, I like my sauce to be a little thicker. But, it looked fine prior to doing this.

This was good! Just the right level of spice. My mods did not change the recipe considerably, only added stuff that made sense. I used chicken thighs, and added ginger and garlic in step one. My cooking time was 15min on hi pressure,  probably a bit too long, the chicken was very tender, almost mushy. I will try 10 min or less next time.

This receipe has errors in the directions (i feel). it says 2 mins and i think it meant 20. i used a hot pot so i was a little unfamiliar with the operation vs directions. 
In any event, the meal was good and colorful. i added mushrooms. i used red curry paste and it wasn't spicy at all. i need to make it again and do some thing's different but it was easy and tastes good. It looked like the pictures when finished. 
Pictures next time.

Great base recipe - very simple, fast and tasty!  I used half a 4oz can of Maesri red curry paste, which allowed me to shortcut the garlic & ginger (in a hurry) and still get plenty of flavor and spice.  With bite-size chicken I prefer to set the manual pressure timer for 0 min and it's still plenty cooked during the pressurizing and depressurizing steps - but not overcooked. I used alternate veggies (carrots, broccoli & mushrooms) - the stuff that happened to be in my fridge - and it was yummy.  Thanks for posting!

I did not have a pressure cooker. I made this recipe in a pot on the stove. It was something different and simple to make.

This was very bland-it was my first time making Red Thai Curry so I used the 2 tablespoon suggested of curry paste. I probably would have doubled it.

Wife and I both liked it, but it needed at least 2 Tbsps of curry paste and probably could have used a little more. Also needed salt and pepper to round it out. I'll make it again

Making this for the frist time, I followed the recipe to the letter.  This is very good. considering how simple and fast it is to make.  The chicken breast  turned out very moist and had a good texture.  I did find it slightly bland for my taste, so next time I think I will add fresh garlic and ginger and a chili pepper or two (and that might just be the variety of chili paste I bought).  This is definitely a winner!!

Not my best dish.  Next time I make this I will double the coconut milk, fish sauce and curry paste plus add some soy sauce. It was too bland for my liking.

4.5 stars--I think to get to 5 stars, I will try a little more red curry paste in the recipe or some chili garlic sauce for a bit more spice.  The flavors were good, but I would have liked a little more "zip".  I didn't have palm sugar so used brown sugar instead.  I didn't have a red pepper, so used a whole yellow and orange pepper to make the desired 3 cups of sliced peppers.  I served this over brown rice that I had made in my Instant Pot earlier.   Really easy and satisfying--it will become part of our standard rotation!

Delicious!  My whole family liked it and they're generally pretty picky.  I skipped the fish sauce and used brown sugar instead of palm. Added some chili garlic sauce to spice it up.  Great over jasmine rice.

Solid recipe but i would definitely recommend kicking up the seasonings. Definitely needs more salt and i would recommend seasoning the chicken prior to cooking
