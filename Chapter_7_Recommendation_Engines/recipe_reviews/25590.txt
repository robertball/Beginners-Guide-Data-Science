For anyone that loves chocolate and fabulous very-easy-to-make-and-spread frosting, this takes the cake!! :) My only suggestion is to use three 9" layer cake pans instead of the 8". The 8" pans make too narrow a cake in diameter, and too high (would not even fit in my glass cake dome holder). The 9" pans make for a much more attractive and large, more normal appearing cake. And because the cake layers are just a tad thinner, the frosting in between the layers is thicker -- looks beautiful when it's cut and tastes terrific! Just remember to bake the 9" layers a few minutes less and test with a toothpick. And be sure to use a nice amount frosting between the layers -- the recipe makes plenty.

This cake is so extremely moist and the frosting is wonderful! The only thing I would add is some vanilla or other extract to the cream cheese base for the frosting to give it a little more flavor.

This is awesome!!  I used 3 9" pans as suggested and it was great.  My husband does not like nuts, so I used chopped Skor bars, saving a bit to sprinkle on top.  Definitely will make again...and again...and again!

I've made this cake several times for baby showers, and it has been a MAJOR hit every time.  It is super easy and has a nice heavy texture.  I've only made the cake with 9 inch pans, and there was barely enough batter for 2 layers, so when I needed a larger cake, I just doubled the recipe.  I also make sure I make the frosting at least 1 night before I serve the cake because it takes some time for the sugar to fully dissolve, but it is perfect the next day.  I've also used white chocolate shavings to decorate the top of the cake and it makes it really classy, professional looking.  No one has to know that it started as a mix!

Delicious cake and the frosting is amazing! I made this recipe for a friends birthday, and it received rave reviews.  I changed the recipe a bit because my friend requested chocolate cake with chocolate frosting.  So, I cut each of the three layers in half and frosted every other layer with the candy bar frosting and chocolate on the others.  Then I frosted the outside of the cake with chocolate.  To decorate I used hershey's hugs because of the brown and white stripes.  It matched the inside and was a neat effect.

This cake is very delicious.  It is very easy to make, and the most complicated part is the layering, which is not difficult at all.  I made this cake for work and received many compliments. i.e. This is the best cake I have ever tasted.

I made this for my mom's birthday & got SO many compliments on it! I had to print off the recipe for my grandma. I plan on making it again for my son's first birthday with some homemade ice cream! Instead of using pecans & chocolate bars, I chopped up Skor bars & added those.

I made cupcakes instead of a cake! I followed the recipe for the cake exactly as writen. They came out very moist and delicious. For the icing I used a little bit less sugar than called for and a little more cool whip to make it a tad creamier. I made these for Thanksgiving so to please everybody I used 3 different candies; Butterfinger, Kit Kat, and Heath. The Kit Kat was the family favorite, but the colors of the Butterfinger were perfect for really cute fall cupcakes! I didn't feel the need to freeze the candy. I used my Pampered Chef chopper to chop it all and it worked wonderful.

Yum! This was so good! I did use 3 9' pans instead of 8' pans. I chose to skip frosting the sides of the cake. Instead I heaped frosting on each layer, taking it out all the way to the edge of the cake. It was thick enough to not dribble down. I then sprinkled on the chopped up chocolate and the pecans on all three layers. It was so pretty and impressive looking when cut. I'll bet it would be good using 1/2 chopped chocolate and 1/2 peanut butter cups. If you buy the tiny peanut butter cups in the bags there's no chopping, With the cake mixes being 3 ounces smaller, I also use a recipe from Pillsbury that's a cake mix extender, making a little bit bigger cake. I just add cocoa for a chocolate cake.

Baked in a 9X13 glass baking dish. Covered top of cake with icing. Chopped up Reese's cups and pecans for topping. The birthday boy and my family LOVED this cake. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Made it just like the recipe except for omitting the nuts.  It was really great!  The icing is a keeper. I can see how you can change this recipe and still be wonderful! It is hard to wait but make sure it is really cold before you eat it!

This cake was good but I didn't like the frosting.  The taste of the cream cheese was totally lost and it just had a sugary taste.  It's worth working with, perhaps cutting back on the sugar (maybe omitting the white sugar, as there's plenty of confectionary), or adding a teaspoon of vanilla to give it a 'real' taste instead of just sugar.

Extremely moist cake with wonderful creamy icing! I only made minor changes...I omitted the pecans, added 1/4 tsp. of almond extract to the frosting and put the candy bars all on top instead of mixing it in the frosting. (Made it easier to decorate). I did use three 9" pans and found this to be the perfect size. I've made this twice, once with Kit Kats and another time with chocolate toffee bits. The only thing is the candy doesn't keep its crunch after you put it in the fridge a while. Next time I'll use peanut butter cups for this reason. Got rave reviews from my Bunko group and a family get together!

This is just wonderful.  The cake is so moist and delicious -- I made this in a 9X13 and in my oven, which runs a little cool, it took about an hour.  The cake is very moist and flavorful!  I made a simple syrup using coffee instead of water and a splash of vanilla and brushed it over the cake to keep it moist overnight.    With the frosting, I whipped two cups of heavy cream with about 3/4 cup of sugar (I added 4 t of plain gelatin melted in 8 T water after whipping the cream and sugar to medium peaks to add stability) and folded that into the cream cheese mix.  I processed Butterfingers and Crunch bars and folded those in, and almonds instead of pecans.  The frosting was stiff enough to pipe, but it spread beautifully.  The cake looks gorgeous and tastes even better, I'm sure the birthday girl will be thrilled.  Thank you so much!!!

Made this for hubs birthday and used his favorite candy bar- Reese's peanut butter cups. Whole family loved it. Made with two 9" pans and cake was super moist.  Lots of frosting so I could layer with a thick layer of frosting between cakes. Great frosting base so definitely will work with any candy bar. Thanks for sharing!

I bake a lot but this definitely won the prize for my family and friends!  I made some changes that are not necessary but due to the rave reviews (and how yummy it was), I will do them next time.  First, I used 3 -9" pans and I only baked the cakes for 20 minutes.  They were slightly under baked which made the cake denser.  I made two batches of frosting: the first I used as a filling using only 8oz cool whip and 2 chopped up Skor bars, kept other ingredients the same, eliminating the pecans.  To frost the whole outside of the cake, I followed the recipe, but did not add any nuts or Skor bar.  I topped the cake with crushed up oreos.  I am making cupcakes this weekend using the extra frosting left over.  This was absolutely one of the best cakes I have ever made and I have made a lot.

This recipe turned out great and everyone loved the frosting!  Even my grandma said it was the best she's ever had and she's an amazing baker!  I used crushed chocolate peanut clusters for the candy bars on top and also drizzled Hersheys syrup, it was a hit!  I only used an 8oz container of whipped topping and that seemed perfect otherwise it may not have been as thick and it worked out wonderfully.  Love this recipe and would recommend to anyone and everyone!

I made this for my husband's birthday and it was a hit with everybody.  The cake was very moist and the icing was just enough (sweet, amount, etc).  I did omit the 1/2 cup of sugar and just used the confectioner's sugar due to the many reviews stating it was too sweet with it.  I used reese's cups.  Freezing them beforehand was brilliant and supereasy.  My husband is not a huge fan of sweets but said that he really liked this cake.  I think next time I will try it with snickers just to see if it will work.  Thank you for sharing this recipe....it is now in my recipe box!

This was a hit at Thanksgiving dinner! Everyone kept talking about how good the Chocolate cake was. People where going for 2nd and 3rds. I had one sqaure left (I made a sheet cake). I was proud to take the credit. I used 4 eggs and added a little more milk. It was very moist. Also I had to cook it at 350 and for 35 minutes.

Divine!  I added 1/4 cup of peanut butter to the cream cheese when beating it and used chopped up Reeses peanut butter cups in the frosting.  I chopped up extra candy to sprinkle on the top and on the outside bottom inch of the cake.  I also just used 2 9" pans, all I had.  It was so good, we couldn't stop eating it!

I made this cake this past weekend for a party and I am sorry to say I didn't like it. I think it was the frosting, it was just to sweet and just had an odd flavor to me. Everyone else seemed to like it ( or were just being kind) so I did rate it four stars. If you don't mind cream cheesy, super sweet frosting ( I even cut the white sugar back 1/4 cup) then you would like this cake. A word to the wise * do not* use Pillsbury brand cake mix with the pudding in the box and add the additional box of pudding to the cake batter. I almost burned my mixer out while mixing it...it was sooo thick and heavy it climbed up my entire mixer ( the cake part still tasted good however).

I made this for my husband's b-day using Snickers (his favorite candy bar).  We all loved it!!  It was especially dense & moist... I'm going to start adding pudding to every cake I make from now on :)  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

This is fabulous - the only changes I made:

Instead of nuts & candy bars, I did crushed oreo cookies (a little less than 1/2  a package), as someone else suggested.

For the frosting - I added 1/2 tsp. vanilla.

Excellent! I will definitely make it again!

I made this in two square 8x8 disposable pans, so I had to increase the cooking time by about 10 minutes.  It was a delicious, moist cake.  I also added chopped peanut butter cups to the icing, as someone suggested.  It was great!  Thanks for sharing.

This cake is absolutely delicious! I'm making it again for a Labor Day weekend cookout, but I'm trying it with less chocolate pieces just sprinkled on top since I think I would like the frosting less chunky. This one definitely goes in my recipe box!

This is the second time I've attempted adding pudding to a cake mix...I simply don't like it. Instead of tasting light and fluffy, it tastes dense and heavy. I did enjoy the concept of the candy bar cake and I liked the frosting so I'm giving it 3 stars. I made it in 3 9" pans and then layered the frosting in between without frosting the side - so pretty when cut. Will make again, but with heavy alterations.

Impressive looking cake that starts with a mix, what more could you ask for! The only change I made while making this recipe was sprinkling the top of the cake and in between the cake layers with crushed Skor/Heath bars. I personally do not care for the texture or look of icing with candy/nuts blended into it. I was a bit hesitant about the frozen whipped topping in the icing, but all together the icing ingredients made a great topping for this cake. Will make again.

I'll be honest, when I first read the ingredient list for the frosting, I had some misgivings...but the reviews convinced me to give it a try. I'm so glad that I did! I'll admit that I skipped all of the extra calories with the cake itself, and just made the box cake as normal. For the frosting, I used 3 regular butterfingers (chopped/crumbled) and used chopped hazelnuts rather than pecans (that's what I had on hand!), also I left out the granulated sugar and just used 1.5 of powdered sugar. I tasted the frosting and was immediately hooked! YUM! I brought the cake to a work function in December and have been requested to bring it 3 more times since then. I prefer to make this and let it sit in the fridge overnight. Try this - you won't be disappointed!

The best cake I have ever eaten. I use butterfingers but not too many to overpower the great frosting and moist cake but just enough to give it a good flavor. My 11 year old son asked for this cake once every couple of weeks and my husband asks for it more than that. It keeps very well wrapped tightly in the fridge for several days and is as moist on day 4 as it was on day 1. Thank you for the recipe.

This is the best cake recipe ever!  Even my husband who doesn't like chocolate cake likes this one!  I use the base recipe for every cake now (the main cake ingredients with the boxed cake mix and pudding mix).  I switch it up with different flavors - it works for any flavor!  I use the icing recipe (minus the candy bar and nuts) for every cake!  It's the best icing for those who don't like really sweet icing.  This cake & icing recipe has become my signature cake recipe!  EVERYONE loves it!

Very good and easy cake to make.  I took this to a neighborhood party and there was none left!  I also had requests for the recipe.  If you like cream cheese or whipped cream this is a good one to try.  I used Hersheys with almonds candy bars.

Big hit, everyone loves the cake. This is a KEEPER. My daughter does not like pecans so I left them out of the icing this time. I can't wait to make it again with pecans. Thanks for posting this recipe.

This cake turned out great! The recipe is very user-friendly for a new baker as the ingredients are very unassuming. After reading the reviews, I used 3 9-inch pans instead of the recommended 8-inch pans and adjusted the baking time. This made for a very good cake-to-icing ratio. As per the icing, instead of candy bars, I crushed up regular Oreo cookies and added that in (approx. half a package). I had conserved some of the Oreo-free icing to use as decoration and added some halved Oreos to the top! Will definitely make this cake again.

Delectable cake!  Followed directions for cake as written except for using 3 9" pans. Of course the change in pans cut a couple of minutes off baking time.  Changed the frosting by cutting back to 1/4 cup sugar and adding a tsp of vanilla. The frosting was super easy to spread. This cake was a big hit!

My whole family absolutly loves this recipie. I put about half of the chocolate and nuts into the frosting and put 1 and 1/2 tubs of cool whip anstead of just the one. I found that the fluffyness of the frosting offset the denceness of the cake. ABSOLUTLY wonderfull recipie. so glad i found it

I have made this exact recipe, but my inner tweaker thinks the cake is best when you toast the pecans first and instead of run of the mill chocolate, use one 4 oz Ghirardelli milk chocolate baking bar and one 4 oz Ghirardelli 60% cacao baking bar.  I chop them finely in the food processor prior to folding the chocolate it.  This recipe also works great with "Black Magic Cake" if you don't want to use cake mix.

Amazing recipe! It came out perfect and was very moist! The only thing I changed was I substituted crushed Oreos for the chocolate bar which add an even better taste. And I added 3/4 cup of sugar instead of 1/2 a cup.

This is the best cake! I make a lot of cakes and this is my go to. It is easy to make and it is decadent! I use this as a base recipe for other types of cakes like red velvet cake mix with chocolate pudding. It is open to the imagination!

This is an outstanding cake if you like sweet cakes. I am making this for the holidays this year. Everyone loved it. My only change was to eliminate the candy. The cake and icing alone was plenty sweet enough without the candy.

Wonderful!!  Made this for my family tonight and they loved it.  I made this with German chocolate cake mix and followed the directions on the box instead of this recipe.  For the frosting, I used all the ingredients just a little different.  I combined the sugars and cream cheese, folded in the cool whip (accidently used 8 oz), toasted the pecans and sprinkled them on top.  Then topped it all off with hershey chocolate bars and reese peanubutter cups, crumbled up.  Very good!!

I made this for work and the guys went crazy over it. Me being me I tweeked it a bit. I used a pillsbury devil's food cake mix and followed the box directions for a 13x9 cake. I poked holes in the top of cake and cut into 2 layers and covered each layer with a coat of caramel topping followed by a coat of fudge topping followed by a coat of cream cheese frosting.My version is 8 oz. cream cheese softened,1/4 cup real butter softened,2and 1/2 cups confection sugar,1 tablespoon plus real vanilla, and 1 tablespoon milk if frosting is too thick. The top layer was thin covered with a layer of cut up mini snickers and milky way bars. I used a half a package of each and then drizzled more caramel and fudge topping
over them.Then refrigerated over night until serving.This version is best done the day before you need the cake!A coworker said it was sinfully good!thus my variation I call sinful chocolate candy bar cake.

This cake is absolutely delicious! I used the white and milk chocolate kisses chopped for the topping and in the whipped topping, and it came out great! I added a tsp of vanilla extract to the icing and left out the granulated sugar, and it was still plenty sweet! I will probably make this again!

I have made this cake for years and my family tells me I have to make this cake every Thanksgiving. So this year will be no different. Instead of using Pecans and chocolate candy, I use Heath bars. SOOOOO GOOOD. Love it!

This cake is worthy of using icing tips to dress  up the frosting as it so moist and delicious.  It reminded me of a suzy Q only way better.

This cake is awesome.  The frosting is fantastic and not to sweet.  I did make some changes.  I made the cake exactly as the recipe said, but I poured it into 3-9" pans.  Make sure you mix the batter with a mixer for the entire 4 minutes, and you will have enough batter for the 3 pans.  When the cakes came out of the oven and cooled , I cut each cake in half to make a 6 layer cake.  I doubled the frosting recipe since i had so many layers.  Than I layered cake, frosting and crushed up heath bars and kept repeating until all the layers was done.  Frosted the entire cake and sprinkled the top with crushed heath bar.  It was GREAT.  Definately better than expected.

This is a great recipe.  I don't use the white sugar in the icing because it doesn't need it.  The icing seems like mixing cement, but it is very good.

Excellent recipe! I screwed it up to and it still turned out great. I realized too late that I used 2 9" round cake pans instead of 3 8". I just baked it about 10 minutes longer. The cake was so moist and good. ANd the frosting was to die for! I used Snickers bars cut up really fine and mixed it in the frosting. Then on top after it was all frosted I put shaved Hershey bars. I made the cake the day before the party and refridged it that whole night cause I wasn't sure if the frosting would get runny sitting out(and it had cream cheese) It was perfect! Big cake too! It easily serves about 15 people.

Elegant and delicious!  I took the advice of another reviewer and used crunched up oreos instead of nuts and chocolate bars.  I also just sprinled the broken pieces on top of each layer of icing and on top of the cake (instead of mixing it in the frosting).  I will be making this one again!

Made this for a friends birthday party, people could not believe it was from a box.  Excellent cake, I think next time I will just use plain cool whip for the frosting.  I don't think you need the cream cheese of the extra sugar.  I used skor candy bars instead of just plain chocolate bars.  Was very good.  I also left out the pecans.  Thanks for sharing!

I can not say enough about this cake,its so moist,so scrumptous,dang it has ruined my starting my New Year's Day diet till next week,its been like 4 days since I made this cake and its still super moist.Anyhows,I made the cake exactly like written but used cheesecake pudding mix,(I really dont think it matters what pudding mix you use because you cant taste it but its the key to the moistness of the cake)I didnt use whip cream topping I made heavy cream with vanilla and powder sugar mix instead and for my candy bar I used snickers.Dang that snickers is the bomb.The perfect amount of nuts and carmel in the cake man alive I cant say enough.Since I used the snickers I didnt put the pecans in my whip cream mix.I think if you have too much nuts it would just enpower the cake,and I love nuts.Sooooooooooo please please try this cake,it will change the way you make cakes from now on.Now I will put pudding mix in all my cake mixes.Thank you Nancy,a great recipe to keep for life.Koodols to you!!!!!

This cake was wonderful! Unique and kid-friendly. I made it with cheesecake pudding in the mix instead of vanilla, and for the frosting I used two chocolate bars, two Skor bars, and only eight ounces whipped topping, which I thought was plenty. There was lots of yummy frosting left, too, and I loved the mild cheesecake flavor. The cake itself was moist and dense; I plan to use it as the mix for other cakes, too. Thanks so much for sharing!

I am getting ready to make it for the second time in 2 weeks! 
I actually only used 8 oz. whipped topping instead of 12 oz. because that was all I had and it was delicious!

OK, personally, this wasn't my favorite cake, but everyone else loved it.  (The only thing I didn't care for was the frosting, but I am a member of the buttercream fan club...I am spoiled!) The frosting is very light and the nuts and chocolate are a nice surprise.  The cake is moist and dense, so it makes for a great combination.

Wow! Delicious, moist cake that was a hit! Everything me loved it! I used Heath bar (no pecans) and it was just enough delicious crunch! I had enough frosting to frost the entire outside of the cake. It was a tad bit too sweet so I'll either reduce the amount of sugar or not frost the outside next time. This cake is worth the effort!

This is the one cake I make for the birthdays in my family. It's the request every year. I have also made some alterations. Instead of using icing in the layers, I make a chocolate mousse. Just take pudding and don't put in as much milk to make it thick, and the. Add cool whip and mix in to make the mousse. I also use 4snicker bars. I freeze my snicker bars, and then put them in a Baggie and use a hammer to smash them. I call this my snicker bar cake....

I love this recipe.  Got it from my sister in law, only to realize she probably got it from here :).  For those of you who find it to be heavy, try using the sugar-free, fat-free instant vanilla pudding.  I've tried both types, and it is definitely lighter and fluffier with the sugar free pudding.  

For frosting, I've done a few variations, and the best one so far is two heath bars and two special dark bars.  Yum.  It's a hit every time.  I'm thinking of trying it with heath ice cream in the middle next time I make it, at my daughter's suggestion.

Rated 5-stars for the recipe as written. Awesome and amazingly delicious. I am always asked to bring this cake… ALWAYS. If you don't have 3 baking pans just make two and then you can cut them in half when you are finished. I find dental floss works great and makes nice clean cuts. I have now started adding a package of MILK CHOCOLATE CHIPS to the batter after it is blended. As per some of the other reviewers suggestion I add crushed OREOS to the frosting mix. It is the BOMB!! With the addition of the OREOS I give it 6-stars ;-)

This rating is for the cake only; I did not make the frosting.  I made it according to the recipe, however the batter was very thick.  I had some buttermilk on hand so I added about 1/3 cup to the batter.  The cake baked up beautifully.  It is super moist, rich, and dense.  I prefer a lighter texture, but it was a delicious cake.  Frosted with vanilla buttercream.

I made this for the first time today, and it was delicious! I only used two layers because I didn't have three cake pans that were the same size. My food processor wouldn't chop up the chocolate so I did it with a knife, and I got a workout! I made my own whipped cream instead of buying Cool Whip. I made some chocolate curls and my daughter put them on the top of the cake..gave it  a nice elegant look. I will definitely make this again! My oldest (8 years old) loves dessert as much as I do, and she ate a big piece and wanted more. A keeper for sure!

This was delicious! The cake had a rich flavor that was perfect with the light flavor of the icing. I shaved chocolate on the top & made a beautiful cake.

This turned out very good, but I made it for a coworkers birthday & did not like the way the frosting looked, so I used it for filling only & topped with a creamy chocolate frosting

The cake is a 5 star, super soft and moist and delicious! 
The only problem...I really should have followed the suggestions of others with the frosting. It was much too sweet to enjoy. I will make this again but use half of the amount of cream cheese and not use any white sugar (only use powdered sugar). The cake is so good it needs very little added to it.

I made this recipe for my friend's birthday, Thanksgiving, and am making it today! The cake is delicious and moist, and the frosting is amazing (my dad said he could just sit and eat the frosting)

Usually, I use white chocolate chips instead of candy bars and leave out the nuts (half of us are allergic to them) and it's still amazing!

Great recipe. I had a Dark Chocolate cake mix on hand, and went with that instead of the Devil's Food. I used Butterfinger candy bars and omitted the nuts since a few of my family members aren't big on nuts. It went over very well, but several people commented on how rich the frosting was. 

I made exactly what the recipe called for, with the exception of the cake mix switch I mentioned earlier. Next time I would use less sugar in the frosting and probably go with a different type of candy bar. The crunch from the Butterfinger bars seemed to put some people off.

Yummy luved it the icing was great the cake was moist and if I could have eaten the whole thing I would have.  Did not change the recipe at all.  Also nice with just crushed oreo's,  just don't over mix or the icing turns an unappealing grayish color still takes good mind you.

I must say this was a great cake everyone loved it. I made a couple of small changes: I used chocolate pudding instead of vanilla, I did not have frozen whipped topping, so I made my own out of heavy whipping cream and sugar. I also added cocoa powder to the frosting. After frosting the cake I made chocolate syrup out of bitter chocolate, semi-sweet chips and heavy whipping cream and drizzled all over cake.

By far, the moistest chocolate cake I have ever eaten, but for me the icing was a little too sweet.  I thought it took away from the deliciousness of the cake.  The next time I make the cake, because i will definitely be making that again, I think I might just use a can of whipped chocolate frosting.

I made this for my dad's birthday and my WHOLE family was blown away!  They raved for days and when they came back to the house a few days later, they were VERY disappointed there was none left.  It's very rich and hard to eat a lot if you eat a full dinner beforehand.  So I suggest skipping dinner and going STRAIGHT to dessert!!!

Substituted 'Dark Chocolate Cake 1' for boxed recipe but liked the frosting. Didn't add regular sugar, only conf. > it was plenty sweet.  Will try again with boxed mix for a quicker dessert.

I have been making this cake for a few years. My sons all want it for their birthday cake. I have made it in a 13x9 baking pan. After it cools I pour hot fudge on top. Let it cool. Crumble oreos on top of the fudge. I top that with vanilla ice cream. (If you take a sharp knife you can cut throught the ice cream container and get uniform slices.) I then top the ice cream with the candy bar frosting. Freeze and serve. It is amazing!!!

I was incredibly reluctant to make this cake. Almost everything about it goes against all of my kitchen rules from the boxed mix to the frozen whipped topping, but I was very short on time & needed a birthday cake FAST. I used Butterfinger bars & crushed up some additional ones to put up the sides of the cake. It looked pro bakery quality. I was nervous to hear peoples reactions because I loathe box mixes but everyone loved it. I even have to admit the cake was incredibly moist & whatever box taste was there got covered up by the delicious frosting (:  I only had 8" pans & it worked marvelously. Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

OH MY !!!  This is a must try recipe, we loved it.   I like that it uses a cake mix so it's homemade with it's other ingredients yet not.  Really easy to make.   I used a 9x13 cake pan rather than round cakes and stacking them.  Less fuss that way by leaving the cake in the pan to serve.  (and to take to other places to serve)    Which worked out perfectly.   Instead of plain chocolate bars I bought one of those really BIG Symphony bars and chopped that up to put on top.   That added an extra touch of flavor.   It's pretty, easy to make and good, plus it's chocolate.  What more can you ask for.

I made this cake for the girls at work and it was a big hit.  I used Butterfinger candy bars instead of chocolate bars which was so good!  I made a 2 layer cake and kept it refrigerated and it's definitely a cake that needs to stay cold.  Next time, I will try a dark fudge cake mix because devil's food cake is not rich enough for me. Thanks for the recipe.  Can't wait to make it with other candy bars!

I made this for a quick birthday party cake for a coworker and they LOVED it!  I didn't change one thing just followed the recipe.

Excellent!  Thanks!

I made this recipe as cupcakes for my 4 your old daughters birthday party, they were a huge hit with the kids and the parents. I iced the individual cupcakes and then put one chocolate square on each one. The only change I made was I added chocolate pudding mix instead of vanilla. They were delicious!

This was VERY good. Two out of my three kids said that they thought it should be thier birthday cake next year! My husband loved it too. I did not add the nuts because of a nut allergy but it was still wonderful and the nuts weren't missed.I used two 9 inch pans.

The frosting was really too sweet.  The cake itself was incredible, though. Next time I would cut back on the sugar since there is already a lot in the Cool Whip.  Love the chunks of candy bar in the frosting idea, that was a big hit.

I made it twice but the first time, with the chocolate on top, was just too sweet, second time I just left out the extra chocolate and it was perfect.  People love this cake, its the perfect birthday cake, so moist, rich, and flavorful, the cream cheese whipped topping is wonderfully fluffy and tangy, overall the cake has cheesecake like appeal.

I used crushed Oreos instead of candy bars as suggested by another user.  I also used all confectioners sugar (1 1/2 cups) instead of any granulated sugar.  It was delicious.

This was awesome! I took it to work to share with my team and apparently nearly caused a divorce because a colleague's wife had baked a cake that evening and my colleague made the mistake of telling her that my one was better when she asked how her cake was. I did make a couple of minor adjustments - I didn't add the vanilla instant pudding based on some of the reviews and I used crushed Oreo instead of candy bars in the icing. I also doubled the icing and still only had enough to cover the top and between layers so next time I may need to triple it. Will make again next time I want a chocolate fix.

I've been making this cake for 15 years from this recipe and it only has 200 reviews?!? That won't do!  I use this recipe whenever I want to impress someone. I took it to a speech class in college and it got rave reviews. I took it to work for a pot luck and even the health fanatics loved it. Today I'm taking it to a gathering to plan my own business. It truly has been there for me every stage of my life and has been well loved. You'll love it too. I do put the pecans around the outside of the frosting like a German chocolate. It's just a touch for the nut haters. Enjoy!

The cake came out very moist which is nice for chocolate cake. Just had a slightly weird after taste but I think it's because of using a cake box mix and instant jello. I would double the cream cheese next time since I prefer that flavor over whipped cream. I added 1tsp of vanilla to the frosting and used Oreos instead of candy bar. I also did 3 - 9" cakes that were thinner. I ran out of frosting and wasn't able to do the sides of the cake. I added a bunch of Oreos inside the frosting and then sprinkled a bunch on top right before serving so that they were still crunchy.

This is delicious!  The only change I made was 1/4 sugar like others suggested.  I did the three 9" inch pans, too.  Just used a soup ladle to divide evenly.  I only frosted the top of each layer.

When cut and laid to the side to show all the layers, is so pretty!  I've never prepared a box cake with all these ingredients,mit is so moist it tastes homemade.  

One mistake I made, that was corrected.  Since it was cool whip, I thought it needed to be refrigerated, but it doesn't.  You couldn't taste the flavors as well, nor the wonderful soft texture.  After I decided to let it sit out and get to room temperature it was wonderful.  We've been grazing on it since XMAS!  Nice cake to serve guests.  I would cut it and put it on the plate to serve individually.

We also put raspberries on top to fancy it up a bit.

Delicious!  This cake was so moist!  I didn't change any of the ingredients, but I only had 2 - 8 inch cake pans.  I was baking this for my twins' 16th birthday and I was so worried about only using 2 cake pans versus the 3.  It turned out fine!  All the batter fit in my cake pans.  I did have to bake them about 35 min though.  And I just used 3 of the chocolate bars in the icing.  They loved it!  Thank you for an easy and yummy cake!

This is amazing! So many people have told me it's some of the best cake they've ever had. Don't expect to have leftovers if you make it for a large gathering. My husband likes it even more made with a large box of pudding because he says it has more of a brownie texture. Either way, you can't go wrong! Especially with peanut butter cups!

Awesome Cake! My hubby thought it was from the bakery. Loved it I used Hersey Bars and followed recipe to a tee except left out most of the sugar for frosting I did put a little. Making today and I'm going to use Milky Way candy and leaving out the nuts because my daughter doesn't like any kind of nuts unfortunately.

Yum!! Delicious cake...very moist. Followed recipe as-is, except I used three 9" pans because that's all I had.  I also made one-and-a-half times the frosting because we like cake that way.  Used Hershey bars and it was great.  Might try Reece peanut butter cups next time!  Will most definitely be making this cake again....and again. :)

I have been making this cake now for a few years, only instead of the chocolate and nuts, I use chopped snickers bars.  It is always requested at family gatherings, especially by my father-in-law.  This last time, I made cupcakes with the frosting piped in the middle and on top, with chopped snickers on top.  Definitely a keeper!

Pretty good!  I thought I'd undercooked the cake as it didn't rise very much.  The toothpick came out of the center clean, however, and I didn't want to overcook it and dry it out.  Turned out great.  Really like the icing and the cake was moist and rich, almost fudgy and brownie-like.  I served at a family birthday party and was told to add it to my short list of birthday cakes.

This is an awesome cake.   I have made it a number of times and each time people start begging me for the recipe.  I do switch it up a bit but for the most part it is the same.   I 100% recommend.

Frosting is the thing - makes the cake. Everyone likes the pudding in it, says it makes it moist. I think it makes it a little rubbery - but it works well when it's refrigerated. I used choc chips and it worked out fine. Toasted the pecans and it make it incredible

This is a easy recipe to follow. I follow the cake mix on the box and follow this icing. Only changes were that I used chopped walnuts but sprinkle it between the layer after i'd frost it instead of folding it into the icing. I also added chocolate curls as a topping.

This is an awesome, delicious, moist cake.  It tastes like something that should be called a "blizzard cake," as in Dairy Queen.  I made this a few months ago, and my husband still talks about it all the time.  I'm about to make my second one!  =0)

The cake was good but not chocolatey enough.  I also thought it was a tad dry.  I didnt make the frosting, but instead used store-bought.  I sprinkled the tops with heath bar bits.  Everybody raved about how good they were.

This cake is AMAZING!! I made it for my husbands birthday. He LOVED it! I used chopped Reeses instead of the milk chocolate...MMmm! Definitely freeze the candy bar before chopping. I only had an 8 ounce container of whipped topping and it still turned out great! My birthday is in a couple of days and I'm going to make it again for my self!!

This cake is amazing!!!I used kit cats since that's my husband's favorite candy instead of milk chocolate candy bars, and it was so tasty. I also had 2 9-inch pans, so that's what I used instead of 3 8-inch pans. My cooking time for the cakes was a little bit longer, but 5-10 minutes. However, this is an awesome cake!!!

I have to say I was a little disappointed with this recipe. The cake itself was delicious, but the frosting was just to sweet! If I make it again I would cut out at least half of the sugar.

The cake is very soft and fluffy, not dense. I sprayed 3 8" pans with vegetable oil spray but forgot to flour. Still came out perfect. Frosting is incredibly easy to spread. I really don't like cream cheese frosting but this one was good. Will make again but next time for a gathering. A little to much cake for just a regular night at home.

I make this for a family cookout. It was great. Everyone loved it. I used hersheys special dark chocolate bars and it was perfect. You would think that this cake would be very rich, or too sweet but it is not. It is perfect in my opinion. Thanks for posting it.

AMAZING! Although I do not have a huge sweet tooth, my husband does and fell in love with this cake immediately. I used butterfinger and mini peanut butter cups. Per the suggestion I froze the candy and broke them up with a hammer in a bag. I honestly have no idea how much candy was in that frosting but I am pretty positive it was a lot more than what the recipe called for! Additionally, I did use fat free whipped topping and fat free cream cheese and you could not even tell the difference. (not that it really matters considering the other ingredients haha) Thank you so much for this recipe--I will continue to make this and am excited to try the endless other variations!

This came out great.  I followed some suggestions, I made it for my boyfriends birthday, so I used his favorite candy, peanut butter cups.  I did it in 3 layers, it was moist and looked so impressive toped with cut up cups.  I made a ring around the edge with cups cut in half, top down and fillet style, then added the left over pieces to the center.  I used a small bad of cups.  And the best part, he didn't believe it was from a cake mix until I showed him the recipe!

This cake by far is the best cake ever!  My kids and husband rant and rave about it.  Though its not the cheapest cake to make, it is the best, definately worth the extra buck!   Still cheaper than store bought from the bakery, and MUCH better!!

This was very, very good.  I did make this in two 9" cake pans and it took much longer to cook.  I also used skim milk.  I followed the recipe for the frosting and used all of it to frost the cake.  I did use Kit Kat bars as my candy.  I mixed them in with the frosting and used that for my filling between the layers and then I just used the plain frosting (without the candy) to frost the sides and top of the cake.  I sprinkled pieces of Kit Kat bars on top of the cake.  Everyone thought it was good.  The frosting was pretty easy to spread and I didn't have any problems with it.

The best cake.  Ever!  I crushed up chocolate raspberry milano cookies instead of candy bars.  That's the way to to, otherwise, too sweet, I think.

Absolutely Delicious.  I made the cake exactly as directed but found it took a bit longer to cook then stated.  I didn't have milk chocolate candy so I just added Skor candy bits that I had on had.  Everyone LOVED it.  No leftovers :(

My husband loves peanut butter & chocolate, so for his birthday, I made this cake for him, with a peanut butter chocolate flair, and he LOVED it! I just added 2 tablespoons each of peanut butter and cocoa powder to the frosting and used chopped up peanut butter cups in the layers and on top. It looked great and was so yummy!!

Excellent!  I left out the nuts just because there were going to be kids eating it and I added vanilla to the frosting.  It was very tasty and is a recipe you can really adapt to your own personal tastes.

I made this today for my daughter's birthday and it was AWESOME!  I used 3 - 9 inch round pans so the layers would be a little thinner.  I also used a large (16 oz, I believe) container of Cool-Whip.  I added about a tsp. of vanilla to the frosting and didn't mix the chocolate and nuts in.  I had enough frosting to frost the entire cake and still plenty to pipe a border on top.  Then I sprinkled the chocolate on top, inside the border...and pressed the nuts around the side of the cake!  If I could have found my usb cable, I would have taken a picture!  It looked PERFECT!  It tasted wonderful too!  I will definitely use this again and again!  Thank you!!!

This cake was amazing. It stayed moist for days. I kept everything in the recipe the same except instead of using candy bars for the frosting I used half a box of mint oreos. If you like mint you will absolutely love this frosting. This recipe is great and I'm sure anything you add in for the frosting will be amazing.

Awesome recipe---I omit the nuts because so many people have allergies.  I also don't use the chocolate pieces in the frosting.  I use it just between the layers and then decorate the top with chocolate curls.  I have also used different flavor of cake mixes.  I do add an instant pudding, a little milk and reduce the sugar in the frosting.  Everyone raves about this cake.

This recipe was so good. I used three 9 inch cake pans, and use dove milk choc.  For the pudding I used cheesecake pudding. I love cake but hate frosting, but this cake was different from any frosting I have ever had. Not to heavy like normal frostings, but not so light like whipped topping. Perfect.

This cake was excellent!  I made it for my birthday party and my friends couldn't get enough of it.  It was a very easy recipie to follow too.  I added 4 butterfinger bars crunched up to the cream cheese filling and sprinkled two more crunched up on top.  Some people might think thats to sweet, but i'm just a crazy teenager who loves candy so... I thought it was amazing.

I made this for my son's birthday party.  I used Heath bars and omitted the pecans dt some nut allergies.  It was great.  I actually thought it was a little too sweet, but every other person at the party loved it.  I had to copy the recipe and give it out to everyone.

This was a very good cake. It turned out moist. I read some of the reviews listed and I added a little less than 3/4 cup of powdered sugar and I only used 8 0z whipped topping and the frosting turned out great. It was delicious! I would definetly make it again.

I tried this recipe and it tasted good. My cake was a bit heavy and the cream cheese frosting too sweet for me. The next time I try it I will only use 3/4 cup of confectioner's sugar and 6 ounces of cream cheese(alot was left over) to suit my personal taste.

This is a fantastic recipe! The only reason that I didn't rate it with five *'s is because I don't like devils food cake. So I substituded it for double chocolate cake, & left out the nuts. I also added choclate curls on top for the pretty factor. Everyone loved it!
