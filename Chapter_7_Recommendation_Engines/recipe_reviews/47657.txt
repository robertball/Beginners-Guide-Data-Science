Very interesting take on a taco salad.  In the past, I've always complained about the chips being on the bottom in a traditional taco salad...this way, they're incorporated in every bite!  I followed the recipe as close as I could with the ingredients I had on hand.  Only changes: I used black beans and didn't have any jalapenos, so I used hot, hot salsa.  Thanks for the recipe, DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED!

This was excellent! Hubby is a San Antonio native and he gave his stamp of approval. Changes I made: brown the beef with chopped sweet onion, use shredded lettuce in the bag, rinse the beans thoroughly (and I have subbed other types of beans for the pinto). This is very yummy and customizable. Always a hit. We really like having this on hot days.

This was delicious. DH raved about this one. I used ranch style beans and mixed them in with the meat and let it simmer for about ten minutes. I mixed the cilantro with the chopped tomatoes. I didn't mix everything together, we built it on our plates. We did top ours with sour cream. This was perfect for using up all those broken tortilla chips near the bottom of the bag too! Very good for a fairly quick meal. Thanks Debra, we really enjoyed this salad.

Wonderful Taco Salad.  I like not having to use a salad dressing or if you want, a little ranch or italian can be tossed at the last minute.  Will fix this often this summer for a cool dinner.

I love this salad! Have made many times! Thanks for the post! The only change I make is to layer the ingredients instead of mixing all together. I love the addition of chips in this.

Wonderful recipe!! Made it for a salad potluck at chuch - it was all gone!!  I left out the jalapeno - was an older group - but would use it and hot salsa for my family. Made everything the night before and mixed it just before we ate, was perfect!!  Will make this again and again!!

This was wonderful. Made it last night. I didn't have cilantro or green onions but it was good without them. Had some left over, just reheated and my hisband said it was better than last nights. The lettuce was a little wilted but it didn't matter. Thanks Debra, your recipe is a winner in our house.

We don't like cumin or chili powder (we're just wimps) so we used taco seasoning for the meat. Other than that, didn't change a thing. It was really good and it was nice to have it all put together, not seperate taking up too many dishes.

I'm going to make this for a beach outing tomorrow!!! I have some ripe avocados from the tree in my garden that I will dice in a bowl and mix with some lemon juice, paprika, a dash of chili powder and cumin (to give guacamole flavour)and then place on the salad! Should top it off nicely.

Yum! I added ranch dressing, olives and left out the beans. I also cooked the beef with the top taco seasoning recipe on this site and white onion, and left out the green onion. Thanks for the recipe!

I wanted to like this recipe, & enjoyed the crunch of the chips in it.  However, I found it too dry, it needed some sort of "dressing."  There's another taco salad recipe I like better that uses French dressing.  Sorry.

We love this recipe.  Its easy and it is VERY filling.  Great as is or with some corn thrown in and about 1/2 ranch dressing mixed with the salsa.  We fix this once a week.  Thanks!

I was lazy and used taco seasoning for the ground beef. I don't like the bean juice, it's just too weird looking in the can, so I drain and rinse. Then you can add some dressing, it is good with sour cream, ranch, or for a crazy twist, try thousand island dressing.

This was okay. I liked the cilantro and green onion, but the mix itself was very heavy. I added sour cream and avocado as garnish, but no one in my family of 7 seemed to like it that much.

This recipe was delicious.  Each ingredient added it's own flavor and texture component.  I forgot to add the cup of salsa and even without it, "dressing" it was great.

Absolutely delicious! I used romaine so the slightly-tougher leaves stayed crisp up against the heat of the meat.  Very easy to tailor to what you have on hand and get great results either way. Thanks for a terrific recipe. Also, I liked that this didn't use a "taco seasoning mix", making it simpler to keep the sodium content from being crazy.

i saw this and wanted to try it.  I have to saw it was great. I changed a few things i used black beans with jalapenos in them that i mixed with some frozen corn.  I also used taco seasoning for the beef instead of the other seasonings.  The kids loved it so i will be making this more often.

this was a really great summer dinner!  I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies and romaine instead of ice berg.
we mixed the romaine and chips in per serving and had the leftovers for lunch the next day.

This was super easy and fantastic! My 10 year ols son called it a 9.5 on his scale. It's a great way to get him to eat veggies. He also said it was a once a week kind of meal. Everyone loved it. I will say this if you are making this and think you  might have leftoves. Don't put the lettuce and chips in until you are ready to eat it the next day. Next time  I will add the chips and lettuce last. Great recipe!

Really good! I used Doritos instead of plain corn chips. The family enjoyed this too! Thanks for sharing. :)

no beans, added 3 table spoons of Tiger Sauce (love that stuff) wife swore it was the best she had ever eaten...I'm retired  (she is still working )and I do most of the cooking...She is insisting on having it for dinner on a regular basis especially on the weekends, until she gets tired of it.....She warned me "NO ADJUSTMENTS"...

A very good taco salad. I drained the beans and used salsa and a bit of Italian dressing  to add moisture. Otherwise I made this recipe as submitted and I will make it again!

This recipe has become a regular for us.  I use romaine instead of iceberg lettuce and include black olives and extra sweet peppers to the mix.  In addition, we top with sour cream.  With the right salsa and chips, this is my favorite salad!

Tasty salad. I added black olives and green peppers (you can basically add any item you would normally use on tacos). Oh, and I added some sour cream each serving (with the salsa) - made it even better. Great recipe.
