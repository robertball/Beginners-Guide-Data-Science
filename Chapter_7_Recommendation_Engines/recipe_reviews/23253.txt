I loved these potatoes! I split it and made two small batches one with soy products for myself, one with dairy products for my husband. We were both very happy with the results. This is going to become a regular dish at our home.

I've made this twice.  The first time exactly as the recipe is written- it was great, except it took an extra 45 min to cook.  Most likely the potatoes where just too thickly sliced.  The second time i sauted the onions with a little garlic and butter- again took an extra 45 minutes to cook.  Both ways were delicious!

This was pretty good.  It wasn't very crunchy on top, though.  Next time I would use regular bread crumbs. My husband loved it.

Very nice.  I didn't boil the potatoes but sliced and placed in the pan, then poured the sauce over.  Since I did that, I had to bake about an hour and a half, but to me it was worth it since I didn't have to go through all that prep.  This made a TON of potatoes, and we enjoyed them, which is really good since it is just the two of us.  I used olive oil for the roux instead and made a bit more of the sauce.  I also salted and peppered the potato layers since I didn't cube but sliced. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this tonight as a side to cauliflower steaks. It was awesome! I only changed a few things. First, I used Walnut Milk instead of soy milk, and Panko breadcrumbs instead of regular. Then I cut back on the plant based cheese because it is usually off putting to me when used as exact equivalents to cow cheese. So I replaced the soy cheese with 1/2 cup Daiya Cheddar, 1/4 cup cashew based mozzarella, and 1/4 cup nutritional yeast. The darker color of the walnut milk looked more like cream of mushroom soup. But the taste was phenomenal! I will definitely make it again!

I substituted rutabaga and turnips for the potatoes and added 1/2 an onion and it turned out fantastic.

I found some sliced, dehydrated potatoes at WinCo and thought they would make good, fat-free potato chips. I was wrong. The only other thing I could think of to do with them was if I could find a vegan, low-fat, au gratin recipe. After searching around, I found this one. The ingredients were simple (since I already had the potatoes), and as it turned out, it's absolutely delicious! I never cared for potato au gratin before I went vegan, but now I love it! I'll be making this again and again!

Very good. Simply instructions. Iâ€™d add a bit seasoning next but it was well received at Thanksgiving!

Followed the recipe exactly but the dish seemed a bit dry.  Flavor was very good but next time I may try more broth and/or soy milk to get more moisture.  Everyone ate it but nobody has asked for a repeat so there is something just a little off.

I had dairy free family members  over for easter. I made some changes to this based on attempting to match our Dairy version of Funeral Potatoes.  The Dairy Free folks loved it with changes. 

- Frozen Hash browns instead of the potatoes
- Goat milk for the soy milk (that is their preferred substitute for cow milk) 
- Panko mixed with earth balance butter substitute for the topping. 
- Kept the cooking time the same, just moved under the broiler for an additional 10  minutes to brown the top.

It was delicious! I substituted sweet white rice flour because I'm gluten free and mustard seed because I didn't have any dry mustard. I will definitely make this again next time I'm in the mood for potatoes au gratin. Thank you for sharing this recipe, Krista!

I love the recipe. It was simple with easy to follow instructions. I added rosemary and thyme and it was a huge success. I boiled the potatoes longer and didn't bake the dish in the end but left it on a hot plate to melt the vegan cheese. Added to my menu for Thanksgiving this year. Will certainly use this recipe again.

this was very rich, and gave me heart burn, but I kept going back for more. SO yummy! I even fed some to a non vegan friend, and she wanted seconds. Ill definitely be making this one over and over again!
