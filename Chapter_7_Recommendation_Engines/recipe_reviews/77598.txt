OH MY GOD!! This recipe is just like my Norwegian grandmother used to make it. She used to call it "Sukse Kake". Have been looking for a similar recipe for years but didn't find it until now. The custard topping really sets it off, but be careful to stir constantly to avoid it burning on the bottom. Got rave reviews from the family - my husband wouldn't stop eating it!! Although a little time consuming I'll definitely make again...YUMMM!

Excellent!!!!  I am questioning the amount of butter to use for the custard.  My custard was just a little too loose for me, but the taste was great.  I did use a bain marie to make the custard.  I think I will just use a saucepan next time.  

I used almond meal instead of chopped almonds.  It gave the cake a smoother texture.  I sifted the meal once and as well the confectioners' sugar.   

I also lowered the temp of my oven to 375 degrees F; 400 degrees F in my opinion is too hot.

This is the same recipe that my Norwegian grandmother made, we have always called it almond torte. One difference is that we used grated dark chocolate to cover the top which made it prettier, I like the taste of the torte itself and do not use the chocolate, my grandma always used the chocolate. This is a huge treat.

OMG! The smell in my kitchen is heavenly! I can't wait 'til it cools enough to eat! My husband and I taste-tested the cake batter and custard because we couldn't wait until the cake is assembled.   I took the cake out of the oven after 22 minutes because it looked like it was close to burning. I think I'll turn down the oven temperature to 325 the next time I make this recipe.  I used 2 cups of Bob's Red Mill almond flour / meal because I didn't have any almonds on hand.

This cake is AWESOME. I had high hopes for it after I sample the still warm custard topping but the finished product more that surpassed my expectations. This will definitely be among future holiday sweets.

Very good!  And, actually, I thought it was very pretty - very presentable.  I tried this recipe because my sister visited Norway recently and told me about how popular desserts are  after meals, and the desserts are fabulous.  She said this was very much like the pastries she had eaten there. Everyone liked it!

This is SOO good! We were eating the custard topping the day before, immediatly after cooking. Everything was really great but the cake got very very slightly burned. 25 minutes is probably enough for my oven. Thanks!

This is really good and has a lot of texture.  Addictive and can't stop eating it.  I kept it as one of my favorites and I will be making again, in fact I dream about it.  We're not allergic to wheat or anything like gluten free and I made it for someone who is and ended up loving it so much and was surprised pleasantly.  Thanks for sharing!

This was a hit with my family.  The only change I made was adding almond extract to the cake and custard topping, and sprinkled toasted sliced almonds on top of the custard.  Next time I will lower the temperature of the oven about 50 degrees and extend the cook time.  Yum!

Sadly, this cake didn't turn out really well for me - I followed the recipe, but the bottom was not cooked at all! I also thought that the cake was a little coarse - this may have been a mistake on my part, since I could have chopped my almonds more. Additionally, I think that there was way too much butter in the custard topping...if I were to make this again, I'd decrease the amount of butter in the topping, chop the almonds finer, and decrease the baking temperature while increasing the cooking time.

It is very good, I didn't change anything about it (messing with baking recipes never ends well). I do medieval and viking cookery and married a Norwegian man and am often looking for recipes in keeping with this theme. The almond flour gives it a marzipan taste. I wasn't sure how this recipe would come together until the very end since the parts are made separately. I did serve it with homemade lavender ice cream which I think greatly enhanced the flavor - the cake is just a little bit too dense without a bit of something else to compliment it (fresh fruit or cream, something cold would be my suggestion)

What a nice surprise. Didn't have time to refrigerate the custard 24 hours and it was a little thin.  But the thin sauce just made the awesome cake stand out more.

I loved the airy texture of the cake and the cream on top to boot. Some think it is too caloric but  it is just a deconstructed version of what we normally know as the cake only. The cake itself instead of whole eggs, it only contains the egg whites and the egg yolks (same amount) are used for the topping. Instead of flour it has almond meal, some sugar and baking powder and that is it. The butter and dairy in this case heavy cream, would normally be baked in the oven included in the cake. In this recipe you save those for the topping and it actually saves you calories while allowing you to indulge without artificial sweeteners. This is a keeper, everyone in my family loved it, and it is very simple. Do follow the instructions and make the topping in day head, it does make the difference. Also, don't freak out and think it is burning, almond meal bakes a few tones darker than if you were using flour and lastly, because of the consistency your life will be much simpler if you bake this on a mold with removable bottom, for example the ones used for cheesecakes. The topping will melt when out of the fridge too long so if you are taking this somewhere it will be outside on a table for a while, hope it is winter! Hope you enjoy as much as we did!

I have made this twice. I really like almond things, and this is very good, but it can get messy as the glaze has managed to run down off the cake inside an air-conditioned room for me before. I like this, but it is not a friendly option for a potluck unless you are the host. Straight from the fridge is the best way to eat this one, for sure.

I shifted all the dry ingredients but the cake was still a little gritty. The flavor was good though. The custard like topping however was DELICIOUS!! That made it for me!!  I did put shaved chocolate on the top but it honestly didn’t need it. I was looking for a gluten free cake for a friend but when I make it  again for mysel I’ll make  it with regular cake base.

Just by reading it the 200 °C seemed a bit high. Anyway i prepared a half portion set the oven 200°C, then went to check after only 20 minutes(instead of the 30mins baking time) and it was burned. Ok i dont think its because i made only a half portion...So could you help me? Otherwise everythings seems okay with the recipe :)
