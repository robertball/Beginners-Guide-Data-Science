The name says it all this was definitely a flop. Butter pooled on top and it never browned even after baking it an extra 10 minutes. So greasy I actually blotted the butter with a paper towel. The flavor was good but all that pooled butter made me not want to eat the rest of it. Thank goodness I only made 1/2 the recipe.

I've had this recipe for a while and finally made it. I tried it once the way it was written and it was ok. The second (and by now up to 5th) time I only lightly dusted the top with flour and then crumbled the butter and brown sugar together for a topping. It was fabulous and now my husband asks for it all the time.

This is very simple to make and tastes wonderful! Almost like a coffee cake. Not too sweet and not bland! A perfect one for coffee!

Easy, quick breakfast.  It was very crumbly, which made it tricky to serve but it may be because I substituted walnut milk for dairy. It looked like too much butter to drizzle on top so I poured half off and drizzled the remaining sugar/butter mixture over the top. I also stirred a half teaspoonful of cinnamon into the four mixture before combining. It was wonderful with fresh strawberries. Thank you
