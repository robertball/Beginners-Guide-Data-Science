Wonderful! I didn't have any "Rice  Crispies" so I used 3 handfuls of Italian bread crumbs. The meatloaf too 50 mins and it came out perfect! The wine sauce was purple, but looked and tasted awesome! Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe!  The flavor with and without the mushroom sauce was great!  I didn't have egg, so I substitued 1/4 cup mayo and I didn't have dry mustard, so I used a squirt of dijon.  I think I stayed close enough to the original to rate it.  The only thing I thought was funny is that the mushroom sauce came out a tad purple.  Definitely a keeper!  (Hubby and two picky kiddos ate it, too.)

I've made this recipe several times. This is my workhorse meatloaf recipe because it's quick to prepare and is savory instead of sweet (although it's also tasty with the traditional red sauce on top instead of serving with gravy). It's also very forgiving in terms of cook time -- I've left it in the oven as long as an hour, and it's still tender.

Two things I suggest: cut back just slightly on the milk; 3/4 cup makes a falling-apart loaf. And use white wine instead of red in the gravy, unless you LIKE purple gravy. (Trust me, it does not turn out the pretty brown in the photo.)

The gravy really made this meatloaf.  Something different from the regular ketchup based loaf.

I made this for my family, and everyone loved it! Definately not the typical ketchup taste, it was way better! And the sauce was a nice touch.
