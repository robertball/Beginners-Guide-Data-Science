MMMmmm! This IS a classic Lebanese dip- We eat it with oven roasted chicken, dipping the pieces in it. I aslo make mine in the food processor and add mayonnaise instead of veg. oil. Its very addictive, and you will eat alot of it. Its garlic, but it sooo good- its worth the risk. Hint: chew fresh parsley after- it will kill bad breath

This recipe was fantastic! The only thing I added was extra garlic! Oh and I put mine in a food processor; worked perfectly fine.

i really did love this, although it was a pain in the neck for me to make...no mortor and pestle...had to improvise...don't ask.  i don't know if i made it correctly.  came out almost looking like mayo.  thick, creamy and white.  it was delicious, but didn't make much.  thanks, i might make again.

My husband is middle eastern and we love this!  However, you must use olive oil and we also add fresh chopped parsley and 1 small minced jalapeno(no seeds). lemon and salt to taste.  It is best served at room temperature once refridgerated the oil can harden..just let it sit out for few minutes before serving.  Great with warm bread for dipping.

I love it.It makes a difference crushing garlic & salt with a mortar & pestal than chopping it up & adding oil & lemom juice.It tastes best with roasted chicken.

There was too much lemon juice. I think half a lemon would have been perfect. I had to add the whole bulb and more oil to try to try to tone down the lemon. I like my toum thicker so it was better after a couple of days in the fridge.

Turned out thick and creamy. Used older garlic and it was super strong - too strong to eat on its own (and we love garlic)! Kept it in the fridge and used it in cooking. Next time I'll use fresh garlic.

Love this!!! I agree with Sarah....it is so much easier using a food processor. Delicious with baked pita bread brush with olive oil/cumin mixture before baking!

I don't doubt this is a good recipe as many have rated it 5 stars, however it didn't taste like what I've had in restaurants.  I tried the mortar & pestle, I tried my food processor but it came out really hot.  I know garlic is hot but it was insane! Did I maybe have bad garlic?  I even mixed it in about 1 cup of mayo and it was still way hotter than what I've had at the restaurant...any suggestions?

Finally!  A toum recipe that did not split for me!  I used garlic press, bowl with wooden spoon, and then electric hand mixer, as I do not have mortar and pestle. Perfect.

This is excellent. I used a food processor.  The key is constantly keep on blending while alternately adding the oil and lemon. Also make sure you add the oil in a very thin stream.  I used 2 cups of garlic and eyeballed the canola oil. If it is still watery, keep on blending. It will will look thick like mayonnaise. Love it!!!

My son's friend Jon gave me this recipe 15yrs ago.  His Mom was Lebanese, and I loved this recipe but lost it.  She died not long after I got it, so I'm OVERJOYED to have another copy.  Only thing I remember different was putting tahini in it.  THANKS for the memories!

Had this at a restaurant in LA, fantastic!  The waitress told me they used an ice cube(s) in their recipe, has anyone heard of this method?  Their dip was so light and fluffy.  I just made this and it is really good, but quite runny, not fluffy at all, any suggestions?

Worked well for us.  I blended this in my Magic Bullet.  I did add a bit of Safflower oil, which seemed to help thicken this mixture up. I only had to add a few tsps.

I have been making this recipe for a long time now. We love it! You can adjust the garlic and lemon to your liking. I use a lot of garlic, and quite a bit of lemon, along with some kosher salt, and I make it in my food processor.  First, I mince the garlic by hand, then I process it with salt and lemon, slowly streaming the oil to emulsify. You can serve this with anything, meats, chicken, seafood, veggies, as a spread or dip. It is great just with pita bread. I also sometimes use the leftovers to make a salad dressing! Awesome!

I thought this was really thin. I normally use a scaled down version of the thick Lebanese sauce from this website. I wanted to test a different recipe this time. I used an emulsion blender instead of mortar in pestle, for ease. I think, this is best with all or half olive oil too. It did work well in a pinch for some red skin potatoes I steamed and grilled. They were kind of bland before adding this. I just had to tweak it some adding a little olive oil and adjusting the other ingredients to make the lemon juice a little less dominant. ty

I cheat and do it in the spice grinder/ blender. Still turns out and creamy and garlicky. Add the lemon juice last.
