Similar but not as tasty as mine...
I use equal parts (2 cups) water and vinegar. 1/4 cup of sugar, add 2 teaspoons of pickling (brisket) spices, 1/2 tsp of salt, no pepper and blanch the carrots. 

This brine is also excellent for picked beets and pickled watermelon rind.

This is a very good snack - used Splenda instead of sugar and added pepperoncini and dried dill weed.  A small sack of baby carrots filled a quart and the liquid was just the right amount.

These are a really, really good tangy finger food.  I used baby carrots, quartered lengthwise & served them on a tray with Jean's Marinated Mushrooms, Deviled Eggs & Cream Cheese Pickles.

I have used this type of recipe with some variations. I add cauliflower, red pepper strips,red onion, celery and toss in some black peppercorns along with the carrots. It is more economical to do this than to purchase Giardiniera. I use dishwasher cleaned pickle bottles, etc. Always a hit on a relish tray for a covered dish affair.

Good recipe. You have to be very careful about how you slice your carrots and other veggies versus how long you marinate them in the vinegar mixture. After about 24 hours, thinly sliced zuccini and radishes turned out wonderful in this marinade. However, shredded carrots were REALLY vinegary, and 1/4" carrot slices were kind of bland. So monitor you pickles closely for flavor.

Also, I did not think the recipe made enough marinade for the number of carrots, so I would suggest doubling the recipe to be on the safe side.

We have a 20 acre part of our ranch planted in baby carrots. I have been frantic to find different ways to prepare them. These were just Great! I used very tiny whole carrots. They had a spicy tangy,which was wonderful.

These carrots are delicious! To make them spicy I added some garlic, sliced jalapenos and red pepper flakes. I have had several requests for this very easy to make and tasty recipe. I also added in some cauliflower for some color and they taste great too!

too much vinegar, these just didn't work at all. there was no "pickle" like bite, just Vinegar bite. Followed instructions exactly, and it just didn't work out. Maybe the planets weren't aligned properly or something.

Recipe was easy to make - I used a 1 lb bag of baby carrots and it worked well, carrots were tangy and nice and crisp.  I think some additional seasoning would be nice, but I'm not sure what I'd add.  Everyone else thought they were good as is.

This worked out great, I added celery and yellow pepper to  the mix and a good tablespoon of hot sauce.  I let it ferment in the refridgerator for about two weeks.  The vegies all stayed crisped and have a wonderful flavor.  Thanks for the recipe and the tips.

I read the reviews and added some dill weed and used a spicy sea salt mixture I had, added some pepperonicini rings and let marinate for 24 hours. Very tasty. I am going to make more and add celery and red pepper flakes for a spicy kick and give out for Christmas gifts.

Delicious! I made mine with a few sprigs of fresh dill in the jar, and they turned out great. I also put in a few slices of red pepper and celery. I first tasted them after 24 hours and I agree that they tasted too "vinegary", but after a few more days in the fridge they were really really good. I'll make a much bigger batch next time!

I used baby carrots sliced lengthwise into quarters or sixths depending on how fat they were. I used 1/2 cup sugar and marinated them in a plastic baggie in the fridge for 2 days. They weren't good when marinated for 1 day only. Crispy and tangy.

It was nice to find a vinegar pickle recipe that could be easily adapted. It seems the fewer the steps and ingredients the more room to experiment. After completing the recipe, I couldn't wait the 12 hours.  Five hours in I can say I'm thrilled. So much so I'm chewing while typing. I eat, blend, juice, quite a number of vegetables so I used some "crunchy" vegetables that I had available. I like it spicy so in went the last Serrano pepper. Have fun everyone experimenting and finding out what you prefer, there's plenty of reviews to help you out. For me, it's a thanks to Sal.

I made this for Thanksgiving and believe that this needs more sugar to cut the strong vinegar taste. I made them on Sunday and the baby carrots were still too crunchy for Thursday. The adults did not care for them but the toddlers liked them so they went home with them.  I will try this again with other veggies as I like the idea and ease.

Very easy to make & very tasty.
Had lots of carrots on hand, and had already used them in baking and in soup. Needed a new way to use them.
Good accompaniment to sandwiches and garnish for salads.
Yes, I will make this again.

I put the hot vinegar solution over the top so it would 'cook' the carrots and added onion on top. Hopefully they were pretty much ready to eat then.

This is a VERY vinegary recipe.  Made as is and took them into work for the girls to test.  Not a hit.  There needs to be a balance, it's not here.

This is a quick and easy recipe. I used organic baby carrots. I also used a half cup of organic apple cider vinegar(AVC) and a half cup of distilled white vinegar.   I reduced the amount of organic sugar by half.  The AVC makes for a sweeter taste, so less sugar is required.  I also used sea salt instead of table salt, as well as organic pepper.  I also used was filtered water, which retains all the good stuff and eliminates the chemicals, etc.  The purer the ingredients  used the better the flavor. Yum!

I was looking for a recipe to pickle various veggies - used this as the base and as per other cooks added garlic, pepper flakes, cauliflower and red pepper slices. The original recipe as is would have been a bit bland for us.

We made this, we used pickling spices and crushed garlic, we have them sitting for 2 weeks now, we will try them in a week! We used peppers, carrots, green beans, zucchini, daikon radish onion and garlic. Our garlic turned blue/green but it's safe. It's the vinegar solution that turns it that colour.

Have added cabbage, garlic cloves, banana peppers, cauliflower and cucumber and always tastes great. I always add celery seed and dill weed, too. Just a pinch.
