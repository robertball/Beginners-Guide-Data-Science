Had this for brunch.  Wasn't too thrilled with the red pepper flakes and the mustard...I think I will stay with my more traditional blt.  Thanks for the post.

I admit I'm a bit of a wimp when it comes to spiciness, but 1 tsp of red pepper flakes was way too much for me. I didn't use that much curry either. This tasted ok, but I don't think it was the 'best BLT' at all. Thanks anyway.

The flavor was OK but the spices clumped up, and burned a little onto the bacon.  I had a huge mess afterward.  I would take a traditional BLT anyday.

Oh wow -- I toned this done by only using a tiny sprinkle of red pepper flakes, and using some light mayo to mellow it out.  I think next time I will try the curry/mayo combo again, but I may just stick with the ol' fashioned BLT.  A great change of pace though, thanks!

This was good but my favorite is to take about 1/4 - 1/2 tsp.(depending on your taste) of Luzianne Cajun seasoning and mix into 1/4 C.  of Mayonnaise.  Spread onto toasted bread - this is the best

Kudos for imagination, but there is way too much mustard, curry, and red pepper flakes for a mere two slices of bacon.  I didn't actually make this but can see by just looking at the recipe it would be a disaster.

My husband loved it.  I also put rosemary in my mayonnaise and put 2 slices of italian bread together so make toast on the outside and put stuff on the inside or side not toasted.

I tried this only because I had the seasonings anyway and it was no big deal to make "1 more" using this recipe.  I thought it was a bit different but still okay.  My wife was once accused of cooking to suit her own taste and nobody else's; so not wanting to share that "rep", I decided to stick with the old trusty tried-and-true BLT.
