Has anyone else had trouble with this recipe?  It looks really good but I couldn't get the crust to work.  There wasn't enough liquid or something & the dates were sticky so my blender got all gummed up.  Was there a misprint or did I just miss something?  Please help because I would really like to try it!!

This recipe is very poorly thought out. As the other reviewer noted, the crust just doesn't work. The dates are too gummy and there is not enough liquid. There is also not enough gelatin in the recipe so the filling is very runny. After all those problems, it was so bland that I'd consider it inedible.

If I could give this no stars I would.  The worst recipe I have tried.  The filling never firmed up.  This created a huge mess on the floor of my car when I brought this to a friend's house for dinner.  Will NEVER try this recipe again.

Almost not worth rating, but felt like I had to warn others to NOT make this recipe.  Something is missing (sugar?)  Doesn't set up right, either.  Even my husband, who eats anything rather than throw it out, tossed this one in the garbage (literally).  Sorry, but this needs a lot of work.

Funny that so few people seemed to like this dish; I enjoyed how different it was from other pies. I would not use this as a dessert pie - it won't satisfy a sweet tooth, but as breakfast? Awesome! Not too sweet, but enough sugar to get you going for the day. As for difficulties with the crust - for heaven's sake people! If it's too dry, add liquid! I added a touch of melted butter and it worked out fine. I also added a bit of coconut milk in place of some of the evaporated milk, which was quite tasty.

Made the following changes: used 3 cups oats, no dates, 3/4 cup orange juice, added 1/4 cup coconut oil to help congeal crust. For filling, used full fat evap milk, used full fat vanilla yogurt. It set up nicely in only about an hour. (Had extra filling so my 5-yr old assistant drank it as a smoothie.)    If you don't keep the naturally occuring fat in a dairy product, your body cannot absorb any of the vitamins from the dairy product, no matter how many are added in!
