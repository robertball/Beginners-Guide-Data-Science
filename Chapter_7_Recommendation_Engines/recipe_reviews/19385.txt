Enjoyed this recipe very much, and got 2 requests for the recipe after bringing it to a family get-together.  Recipe did not state to break the spaghetti before cooking.  I used spaghettinibroken into 4 pieces, and using a bag of pre-washed baby spinach made it quick and easy.  Reheated well in the microwave.  A keeper.

Delicious pasta dish.  I served this along with the Fiery Pork Skewers recipe I also found on this site.  I only used about 1/2 lb of pasta (I used vermicelli), but I left the rest of the ingredient amounts the same as the full recipe.  There was just too much pasta compared to sauce in the full recipe.  This was easy to make while my husband was outside grilling the skewers.  My 10 year old really liked this dish - he asked me to make it again as just the main dish even.  I saved the leftovers for lunch tomorrow - I think it will be just as good as a cold salad.

This recipe calls for way too much pasta. Tasty, but not delicious.  Quick and easy though!  Not highly recommended.

I make this pasta salad whenever I want to impress- we love it!  I prefer it with bowtie/farfalle noodles rather than the fettucine.

Served this at an open house and it was a big hit.  I tossed the spinach with the pasta when it was just barely warm and it worked great.  There was still a slight texture to the spinach.   I also added crushed almonds.   In the health food section I found a toasted sesame oil (used in a lot of stir frys) that had a nutty flavor to it.   This was a great last minute pasta salad since you don't have to let the flavors set by putting it in the refrigerator for several hours. I added red and yellow peppers to the stir fry too.  Definitely a keeper.

Loved it! I stir-fried chicken strips first and added them after I cooked the veggies. I julienned the carrots instead of grating them. I didn't add mushrooms because I didn't have any, but I think they would have made it even better. I think some sliced water chestnuts would be good, too. This will be a regular meal for my family.

Absolutely loved this warm pasta salad.  A perfect side for just about anything, I served with strip steaks.  I made the recipe closely as written, but halved the pasta, and a little less spinach and mushroom.  What a versitile dish, this would be perfect as a vegetarian main, or a terrific way to re-purpose left over shrimp, chicken, pork or beef.  Hubs raved over this, and that doesn't happen often with sides.  Thanks for sharing your dish!

My family really did not like this recipe at all.  The teriyaki sauce was just too overpowering and sweet.
