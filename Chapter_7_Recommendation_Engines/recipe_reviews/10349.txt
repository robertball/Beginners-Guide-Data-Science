For those who found the recipe to crumbly, I have some advice to mix better: first cream shortening and sugar together, then add egg and vanilla and mix well until creamy. Then mix flour,baking powder and salt.Add dry to wet ingredience a little at a time until you are able to mix it all in. Save the confectioners sugar for the glaze! Wonderful cookie, my kids loved them and I even took a picture for the web site!

I think some reviewers added the powdered sugar as part of the cookie recipe. All that is needed to bring the dough together is a bit of milk. I also added about 1/4 cup more sugar. It's a great roll out recipe!

There is something missing from this recipe the dough is crumbly and is not able to be roled out for cut outs.

I followed advice about creaming together teh shortening and sugar first, then adding eggs and vanilla.  I then, slowly mixed in the dry combination of flour, baking powder, and salt.  This ended up terrific!  I have perfect cookies.

Followed advice of others and creamed sugar and shortening first, added dry later.  Used exact amounts of flour.  Rolled like a dream and tasted like the bakery cookies we get at Publix.  Glaze was good, too, and it dried well.

I think i figured out what the dough needed. First cream shorting,eggs,sugar,vanilla, 
Second add only add (3 cups of flour instead of 3 1/2) flour,salt,baking powder,salt. And do not use the powder sugar and water in cookie dough its for the icing.

A rating of 3 only.  If I could, 2&1/2 stars is my true rating.The flavor of the cookie itself is good, however the dough is not easy to roll out due to a dry texture.  I tend to think this recipe is missing milk.  After Iw baked a dozen with the recipe as is, I added about 2-3 tbsp of 1/2&1/2 to the already mixed dough, worked it in well with my hands to get a more plyable dough.  THEN I was able to easily roll the dough and cut-out cookies.  I will not use this recipe again - too much trouble/work.  I will stick with my current rolled sugar cookie recipe.

My 13 year old daughter made these while my husband and I were at a Christmas party.  They were awesome! I was very impressed. She did not read the reviews first, so when I read them I was surprised at the negative remarks.  I asked her about the dough being crumbly and she said she just had to press it together with her hands to form a ball before she rolled it out.  She used pre made frosting to decorate so this rating is for the cookie only.

I loved this recipe.  I only had about 1/2 cup of shortening left so I added 1 stick of butter.  I also creamed the butter and sugar then added the dry ingredients.  After refrigerating them, they rolled out perfect.  Very easy.

I lost my favorite cut out recipe and decided to try this...I totally lucked out!  For those who thought too crumbly you need to mix it more until it comes together.  A countertop mixer works well for this.  It rolled out fabulously without being refrigerated. I did 1/4" thickness for a cookie to be royal frosted for my son's end of year soccer game.  Be sure not to work it too much after each rolling or you'll have drier cookies from all the extra flour.  Refrigerate the cut out dough for 15-20 minutes to keep it from spreading while cooking and you'll have the best chewy cut out cookies ever! Thank you for my new recipe!

I made the cookies and used a different frosting recipe.  As for the cookies, they proved difficult to roll and cut.  I ended up doing one cut-out cookie at a time.  I made two half batches, one with vanilla and the other I substituted the vanilla for anise.  I also added 4 drops of red food coloring to have pink cookies for Valentine's Day.  Both cookies had a good flavor and made great VD cookies!

I wish I had read the hints to cream the sugar and shortening, etc. before adding the flour.  The dough was so crumbly.

I followed some of the suggestion the the previous reviewers and these were not hard to roll out and did not crumble at all!!
These are the first cookies I have ever rolled and cut out and I found this a very simple and easy recipe!!

For hotel welcome buckets, I included these cookies cut into starfish (beach wedding theme) and they were a huge hit. I used a cake tester to dimple the starfish to look more authentic.  Simple to make & great tasting too!

I made these cookies twice, the 1rst time I actually made a mistake instead of using baking powder I used baking soda, the 2nd time I baked these I followed recipe to a Tee. The 1rst batch was much fluffier and not as crumbly. I think this is an error in the original recipe so try baking soda instead. Also I creamed sugar and shortening together 1rst then added dry ingredients a little at a time alternating with egg and vanilla, so mixture is less crumbly. I baked at 350 degrees for 6 minutes with oven wrack on notch above the middle.

Very easy cookies and taste great! Not to sweet, just enough! Took these to work and one of my co-workers told me this is the recipe she's been looking for. I agree with previous reviews regarding creaming the shortening and sugar, adding egg and vanilla and THEN adding dry ingredients... I thought that was an understood rule of making cookies. Anyway, wondreful recipe! My kids had way too much fun helping!

I did find the dough very crumbly (didn't see the advice about creaming shortening and sugar)...but I added some water and hand mixed then it was ok.

Made with my five year old.  She had fun.  The dough was very easy to make and work with.  They family loved the taste.  We did not frost.  We only sprinkled with colored sprinkles before baking to save on decorate time.
