I have to complain. I hope the 2T. salt is a typo. This is WAAAY too salty! I just ruined a whole batch, and having diluted it twice, it is still too salty. I don't think the liquid smoke helps, either. Cooking the asparagus like this in the micro only made it tough and almost burned it. Steaming it stovetop or in the micro with water would be a lot better. A few bacon sprinkles could take the place of liquid smoke if you really wanted it to have that flavor.

I never add ANY salt until it's finished cooking and I've tasted it ... To the person who added that much salt was just silly for not thinking twice beforehand ... Liquid smoke is optional but when used ever so slightly its a nice taste

Thicker than I thought it would be.  I would like it better with some Chicken or Turkey included.  Using the blender is a must!

I'm only giving this a four since I think that using the microwave is not the way to steam your asparagus.  I pretty much followed the recipe other than using that method for the steam.  Use a standard steamer until the trimmed stalks are tender, and the rest is superb.  I think some people don't understand that microwaves vary in power and such, and mess up.  Steam the stalks, do the tips as memtioned, and all will be well.
