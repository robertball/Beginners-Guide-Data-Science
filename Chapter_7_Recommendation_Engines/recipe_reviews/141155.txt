Wow, this is a great recipe! I was a little worried while it cooked because it smelled like nothing but soy sauce, but once it was done, my DH was using a spoon to get all the juices out of the baking dish! I used a little less EVOO and only marinated for two hours and I think that was plenty. I used about half the cheese called for and no red bell pepper (hate that stuff!) I took other reviewers advice and left out the bacon and secured it with toothpicks instead of twine. I thought all that olive oil kept it moist enough without adding more fat with bacon grease! I cooked it for 50 minutes at 350 degrees and it was a tiny bit on the dry side so watch your oven and don't go over the 145 internal temp recommended by the poster of this recipe. I can't wait to make this again, we loved it!

First of all, this is a 5 star recipe all the way.  I made a few minor changes that I feel make a huge difference.  Cook your bacon first.  I cooked mine to the point of almost crispy.  Then I wilted my fresh spinach leaves in the bacon grease.   I also roasted and peeled the skin on my red peppers prior to slicing.   I cooked my rolled contraption in the oven until 142 degrees internal temp (145 would be too done for our taste) and let rest for 15 minutes.  Sprinkle parsley over the top and serve.  The meat was SO tender you didn’t need a knife to cut it.  These simple changes make such a difference in this dish.  It turns it into something you’d expect to see at a very nice restaurant.   This is an absolutely wonderful recipe and SO easy to make.  Thank you so much for sharing this with us!!

I'm sure this is great as is, but I didn't have some of these things so this is what I did: I had some milanese steaks (SUPER thin-cut steak), lined them with thin sliced provolone, lined that with fresh baby spinach, rolled it up tight, wrapped it tightly with raw bacon, pinned it with toothpicks and laid it in the casserole dish on its side.  Then I drizzled it with worcestershire and sprinkled it with garlic powder, fresh ground black pepper, a pinch of thyme and paprika.  Then just cook to temp.  Absolutely delicious!!!

What a great dish! The flavors combine perfectly and the steak just melts in your mouth. I will definitely be making this again, it was a huge hit with my entire family.

I made this for dinner last night and it was awesome! I'm sure it would have been even better if I'd followed the directions exactly, but I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, so I had to improvise a little. And I only marinated it for 1 hour before cooking and it was still great. Can't wait to try this again- thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

Followed recipe exactly and it was amazing. Everyone enjoyed. The only recommendation I would make is to cook the bacon a bit before as it won't cook all they way once rolled into the steak. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! I'm not a fan of provolone so I used cream cheese with chives and onion instead. I can't imagine eating this any other way.   It took 50 minutes in my oven. Next time I will cook the bacon slightly but other than that and the cheese change, we loved it! Thank you for an amazing recipe.

These were fantastic! I was going to take a picture, but we ate them too fast. I do have a couple of suggestions, though. I used a package of thin cut flank steak, that was cut into individual servings (super cheap). I think it took a little more time, because I had to roll each individual steak, but it was definitely worth it. I used toothpicks to hold them together, three for each. They were easy to put in and easy to take out. The bacon didn't cook all of the way, so I would suggest cooking the bacon half-way first and then layering it on top of the steak pieces. The flavors were outstanding, the presentation was beautiful, and we will be making this again! Thank you for developing and sharing this recipe with us!

I used the teriyaki marinade recipe from the Teriyaki-Flank-Steak recipe and then followed this recipe's directions for making the roll. It was both delicious and eye-pleasing. 

TIP: Make sure you have a meat thermometer because there's no other way to correctly determine if the dish is done.

Marinating overnite is way too long. Tasted too much like beef jerky when marinated that long. Will try again but will reduce the marinating time to about 2 hours.

This was awesome! I'm not a really good cook, seems like even if I follow a recipe, it doesn't come out how I'd like, but this one was amazing. I just made a couple little changes. I used swiss cheese, since it was what I had, and also used ham instead of bacon. Also, I think everything is better with onions, so I cut up some, and made a bed, put the rolled steak there. It smelled incredible, and I made a gravy with the juices and the onions, and served it with mashed potatoes. BIG HIT!!! My husband and daughter loved it, even tho it was something kind of new for them. Definitely a keeper!!!

DELICIOUS!! I doubled this recipe for 6 couples for a Valentine's dinner. I do not like provolone, so I substituted onion and chive cream cheese. YUMMY!! I also had the butcher run the steak through the meat tenderizer then I pounded it out just a bit before marinating. Served with a strawberry, spinach, walnut, parmesean salad with balsamic dressing, tomato fetta bread, grilled asparagus, cous cous, and finished it off with the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake from this site! My friends were so impressed with this meal! My husband was sooo bummed that there were not any left overs! SO EASY AND DELICIOUS!!! THNANK YOU!!! This will always be served at my dinner parties!

My family really liked this.  Even my son, who normally wouldn't touch a mushroom or a bell pepper, cleaned his plate!  Next time I will thicken the pan juices with a little corn starch to make a sauce.  The only change I made was to use about a third of a package of frozen chopped (thawed) spinach, since I didn't have fresh.  I think I could have used more.  The dish is relatively easy, once the meat is butterflied, and attractive enough for company!  Thanks for the idea!

Great flavor and presentation. I had the flank steak butterflied by my butcher. I used all the ingredients listed and agree that bacon can be either reduced or eliminated. I used silicone bands to hold the meat together. One hour baking time gave me a nice steak that was cooked to medium in the middle.

This was amazing!!!!  I used prosciutto instead of the bacon (didn't have to worry about the bacon cooking all the way).  I also used a roasted red pepper instead and left out the mushrooms.  I cooked my 2 pound steak for exactly one hour and it came out medium which was perfect.  I'm definitely adding this as one of my signature dishes and will make it again.

I did what another user did and used steak that was already cut into individual servings (which turned out cheaper.)  Next time I will buy more cheese (I didn't have quite as much as the recipe called for - my mistake) and I will let it marinate longer than the 30 minutes I had.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  It turns out so beautifully that it looks like it took a lot more time that it actually did.  Any dish that makes me look that good with minimal effort will certainly get made again in my kitchen!!  Also, my husband tried a couple of his with banana peppers instead of the red bells, and he really liked it (although he LOVES banana peppers.)  Great recipe - thanks so much!

If you are looking for an easy recipe with a beautiful presentation..look no further. This tastes amazing and looks like it took all day to make. It is super simple and very adaptable to what you have on hand or your own personal tastes. I stuffed mine with spinach, roasted red peppers, and aged provolone. My husband requested some capers next time, and there will SO be a next time. Great recipe! Thanks!

This was amazing!  Got rave reviews from the husband.  I added worcestershire sauce, garlic and black pepper to the marinade in place of steak seasoning.  Used all natural, organic ingredients, baked per recipe- next time will lower the temp to 300 and cook for 30 minutes longer and cover with foil or used the Pampered Chef deep dish covered baker.  It was so good!

"Tastes like an expensive philly!" says my husband! He loved it, and that says a lot because he is a professional cook, and is rarely impressed by a dish. However i switched it up just a little.  so i have been trying to find something to do with all my cubesteak off of my deer meat. I think cubesteak is just a tough hamburger not a steak! This recipe was perfect! I used the cubesteak, but i did not roll it! I just put it in a baking dish and covered the dish with tinfoil to cook a little faster. I removed tinfoil after the meat was up to temperature and cooked for another 5 minutes! Again this was an awesome recipe, and is now a permanent monthly meal! Thank you so much!

This was fantastic. I didn't add as much cheese because it sound like a lot, but I was wrong, I should have added it all. I also added an extra piece of bacon, which I sholuldn't have done. The bacon adds salt and it was a bit too salty with the extra piece. Recipes was great as is! Next time I make it, I will follow directions exactly. YUM!!

This was so good.  I use hormone free meat which I have found to have more flavor anyway.  I used roasted red peppers and prosciutto instead of bacon - very very thin.  I did think it was a little salty though.  Maybe the steak seasoning made it a little salty.  Other than that- I thought it was wonderful and may make it for Christmas.

Great recipe! This was my first time cooking flank steak and it turned out perfectly. I would suggest letting it marinade for several hours or overnight.

I found this recipe and my girlfriend made it for our New Year's Eve dinner.  It was DELICIOUS and beautiful!  She said it was pretty easy to make, too.  Definitely keeping this recipe in the mix, especially for entertaining!  Thanks for a great addition to my book!

Excellent!!! I made this for dinner and my husband and 12.5 month old LOVES it! Thanks for sharing!

We made a new twist with this dinner. We mixed together cooked sweet Italian sausage, a package of the garlic and herb laughing cow cream cheese, a box of spinach instead of the ingredients suggested. 
We then rolled it up in the flank steak and cooked like directed.

Oh Gosh!  This was fantastic.  I only had a 1 1/2 lb flank steak that I had the butcher butterfly for me, which was a wonderful idea.  I can't imagine doing it myself.  I followed the recipe except I put the bacon in the micro for 1 1/2 mins per other reviewers and used roasted red pepper instead of the red bell pepper.  It was awesome and I can't wait to make this for a dinner party I am having in the near future.  Awesome!

Crazy good! Precook the bacon, and try with roasted red peppers. I also just used standard white mushrooms instead of crimini.   I used Lawry's seasoning salt because I wasn't exactly sure what "steak seasoning" was. The recipe was incredible and beautiful.

So good.  Had some trouble butterflying the steak myself and then ultimately trying to roll it.   Will try a few more times to get it to look pretty before making for guests.  I did partially cook the bacon first as others suggested.  The red pepper was still a little crispy so next time I may use roasted red peppers or just cook them a little before attempting to roll.  Thanks for this recipe!

My steak wasn't very thick to begin with, and even thinner after butterflying.  I guessed that it would take less time to cook, but didn't check the temperature soon enough, and it was overdone.  The flavor was good.  I made a sauce with the marinade.

Loved this recipe and I made a few changes... I marinated the meat in Gravy Master (not affiliated with them). The pan drippings from the GM made for a fantastic sauce! I cooked the bacon before rolling and I also basted with butter when I pulled it out of the oven to rest. I found that it was even tastier as leftovers the next day!

This dish was surprisingly easy to prepare, and was flavorful and delicious as written. DEFINITELY use a meat thermometer, if I had cooked for the recommended time of one hour, this dish would have been extremely undercooked. I ended up cooking this for almost an hour and 20 minutes before the thermometer registered done.

We needed to downsize our Christmas dinner and this was perfect! The only change I made was to substitute sun-dried tomatoes for the red pepper, which my daughter doesn't like. I used inexpensive, thin bacon, which made it easier to roll. I was also worried that there was too much cheese, but it worked out fine. Served it with smashed potatoes; broccoli w/cheese sauce; and a spinach salad with feta, craisins, mandarin oranges, & raspberry vinaigrette. Simple, but festive. It got rave reviews. Thanks!

Amazing! All three of my guests went back for seconds! I did make a gravy, as some users recommended but it wasn't needed. I had to combine three pounded butterflies steaks together to make it two pounds and I doubled the insides. Made for trickier rolling and added half an hour to the cook time, but otherwise it was great! Also I subbed cooked turkey bacon for the bacon.

This recipe was great! I did not follow the ingredient list exactly because I wanted to use what I had on hand...I used baby kale in place of the spinach and a moz/prov blend of shredded cheese...it was delicious and I will definitely make this recipe again ...maybe I'll use the listed ingredients next time... :)

Oh my!!!!! What a wonderful dish. only used a slight amount of olive oil (both sides) salt/pepper.I did like others and used the bottle Roasted peppers, no bacon. I did pre cook my mushrooms and then added the fresh spinach just to wilt. Not only is the flavors perfect but looks like a real Chef cooked for us... I can hardly wait to make again and again!!!!

My family LOVED this recipe. I had to tweak it just a bit with the marinade because of what I had on hand. I used teriyaki sauce and soy sauce in the marinade because I didn't have enough soy. Then I added garlic powder with parsley and onion powder along with the olive oil. I did cook my bacon first till it was just crisp. I added about 2 tbs of chopped red onions to the roll. I also only marinated for about an hour as I got started late. The sauce was delicious. This was one of the prettiest dishes I've made by far. Thanks so much for sharing!!!

This was fantastic! Really easy to make and everyone raved.
I took a few of the suggestions, precooking the bacon as well as roasting the pepper. We don't care for spinach, so we left that out.
Definitely give this recipe a try, you won't be disappointed!

Turned out great! I made a few adjustments only because I can never follow a recipe to a "t" I didnt have steak seasoning so I just added fresh cracked black pepper, garlic powder, and 2 tsp. of dijon mustard. It was fabulous! Family loved it and it was a great new way to have steak.

Will pre-cook the bacon next time even more. I used my Convention oven and this was done in 35 minutes. The bacon, although I partically pre-cooked was still underdone. I also will try with the garlic-herb cheese next time as that sounds great too.

I had serious doubts about the marinade for the steak. But I figured all the good reviews could not be wrong so I went with it and added about 1T. minced garlic.Marinated for 2 hours. Stuffed the steak as directed except I subbed roasted red peppers from a jar instead of the fresh. Baked around 45 minutes- Perfect! This was so good! I will make this recipe many more times for sure! We loved it! Thanks so much!

WAY. TOO. SALTY. If I made this again, I'd use less soy sauce, and less steak seasoning. The bacon and cheese add even more saltiness to it. Also, I'd cook the bacon first. Mine was practically raw!

This was great!  The only change I made was to leave out the bacon.  We thought this had excellent flavor.  I think this would be great to serve to company, though I need to practice my rolling technique.  I would make this again in a heartbeat.

My husband went nuts over this recipe!  Left out the bell pepper, but made as written otherwise.  For father-in-law's birthday, served with uncle ben's original recipe long grain and wild rice, and Brussels sprouts.

Seriously, YOU HAVE GOT TO TRY THIS!  I scored some serious mother-in-law points with this one.  The only reason I only gave it four stars is because I would forgo the red peppers.  Next time I will try it with blue cheese and make sure I wrap it more tightly - mine sort of fell apart, but still tasted uh-mazing!  Well done.

This dish was EXCELLENT! I made it tonight for dinner and my wife and I both cleaned our plates. I marinated the steak for 2 hours and used feta instead of provolone cheese. I also pounded it out a little to tenderize the steak.  Very good and very easy.

WoW! This (with a few very very minor modifications to accomodate the ingredients I had on hand and to take a few reviewer suggestions) was a HUGE hit here! One of the technical changes I made was to cut the steak into smaller pieces. This made it easier to butterfly and I just made sort of smaller, individual servings instead. My family is already asking when we are having this again. Seriously though if you have a meat-loving family, DON'T OMIT THE BACON! I pre-cooked it just a bit and I think it's responsible for the great way it was received by my guys.

This recipe is pretty much the same as an Italian meatloaf recipe on the web that we love to make. The only difference is the meat and the use of bacon.  This recipe is easy to prep and overall the flavors are good.  After serving and having a few bites the one thing my wife and I immediately agreed on what to use prosciutto instead of thick sliced bacon.  The bacon fat didn't render at all and remained thick and stringy. Perhaps cooking it first in a  skillet would improve that.  Still, using prosciutto seems a better choice to add the desired flavors.   Also, we found layering the Provolone cheese slices made it too thick once everything else was on, thus making it harder to roll.  Next time we'll shape the slices to fit evenly without overlap, which is how we do the Italian meatloaf. Lastly, for this particular flank steak recipe, we're going to try adding a topping of fire roasted tomato sauce with garlic to increase the "pop" this dish should have.  All in all, this is a decent, basic rolled flank steak recipe and easy to modify to your own tastes and health standards. Good job, Angelshark!

I used Feta, Mozzarella, and Provolone.  Also, I chopped brocolli instead of using spinach.  In my opinion the bacon wasn't needed.

Surprisingly amazing recipe!  It's so easy to make.  My fav recipe so far!  Great job!  Thank you for this recipe very much! I didn't have mushrooms and bacon - I put red bell peppers, spinach, and cheese - and it was light and great.  You can vary the inside ingredients a little with no harm to the final taste, which is very handy.

This was so delicious!  I wasn't able to roll it, so I left it flat on the pan, and it was so beautiful!!  I poured the leftover marinade over the whole thing before it went in the oven.  Throughout the cooking process, I kept basting it with the liquid in the pan.  It was so moist and flavorful.  I marinaded it for 2 1/2 hours, and used a whole bell pepper, more spinach, and two garlic cloves pressed.  YUM!!

The flavor was excellent but there was no way I could use all that cheese - used about half of it...the meat was so piled up with the filling that I couldn't roll it so I just kind of pulled the edges together and tied it at intervals - marinated the steak in my Mom's marinade which I put on this site and poured leftover marinade on top before baking and basted with it during - everyone LOVED it!

Wanted a festive dish for an elegant dinner with friends. This did the trick. It was delicious! Not a bit was left over. Served with baby new potatoes, creamed spinach, salad, shrimp coctail appetizer, wine and candle light. Perfect.

The marinade is good and the flavor is good, but the raw bacon on the inside is a no-go.  It's a little borderline on food safety.

This recipe would be 5 stars with some other precooked pork product in there (prosciutto anybody?) or with the bacon placed on top.

You cannot ruin this recipe even if you don't have all the right ingredients!  Don't have steak seasoning?  Use whatever herbs your family loves.  My husband needs low salt, so I used the side pork that he cooks on his smoker and then throws in the freezer.  I didn't have a red pepper but I always have a jar of roasted red peppers.  I used the lower sodium Swiss cheese and less of it.  We decided that this was a main dish to serve guests.

Very surprisied at how fast and easy with beautiful results!  I pounded my flank steaks just a little thinking I didn’t have enough area to lay out my filling, but didn’t seem to make a physical difference. The steak, however, was so tender and juicy and I poured all scraps and juices over the meat before serving. 
Will make again, especially with company!  I think I could make earlier in day and just remove from fridge early enough to bring meat back to room temp before searing them.

Definitely 5 Star! I left out the peppers and only had time to marinate for 2 hours, but it was fabulous! Very tender. The only thing I will do differently next time is to partially pre cook the bacon. Some of it didn’t crisp up, but it was cooked enough to eat. The flavors are indescribably wonderful!

I had a frozen flank steak and butterflied it while still slightly frozen, which makes it easier to cut. The steak was  delicious but pretty salty with steak seasoning, soy and bacon. You could go low sodium to reduce the salt.  It probably doesn't matter what you stuff with.  I used shredded cheddar (barely noticeable flavor), spinach, medium spice pre-roasted hatch peppers, and bacon. I would definitely pre-cook the bacon a bit. I also like rare red meat but the men prefer well done, so i had to  cook it until 155 degrees .  I Loved it!

"This is my favorite steak" is what my boyfriend declared when I made this. Honestly, I didn't think it was anything special; hence, a combined 4 stars. I used ricotta, thawed frozen spinach, and roasted red peppers, and skipped the bacon to make it South Beach diet friendly.  I tenderized the meat and pinned it with wet toothpicks. Baked for 1 hour.

This was amazing!! We're stuck at home for a snow/ice day and I wanted something supremely tasty. I happened to have a flank steak in the freezer, so I went searching for recipes that didn't use the grill. (Although next time I think I will cook this on the Big Green Egg-indirect for that hint of smoke!) I had to sub a few things because I didn't have them on hand. I used chive/onion cream cheese and roasted red peppers, but I had all the other stuff. My steak felt a little too thin to butterfly, so it turned into more of a "fold" than a "roll", but it was still delicious! Next time I will ask the butcher to butterfly for me so I can get the true roll effect. This is definitely a "company" meal!! And 145 got it to a perfect medium!!

I made this for my husband and, I on New Years day. I couldn't find flank steak so I used a flat skirt steak and divided it to long pieces. I followed the recipe with the exception of rolling the steaks in bacon. I opted to use a smoked gouda and used frozen fire roasted peppers and onion blend that I defrosted in the microwave and chopped fine,along with the mushrooms. I rolled baby spinach leaves,gouda,and mushrooms into the two bundles and secured the mixture ends with toothpicks. Taking the hint from another reviewer,I sprinkled the rolled steak bundles with garlic powder,fresh ground pepper,and a sprinkling of dried thyme. Came out superb! Cutos Angelshark.:)

I almost followed the recipe on this - just added more of everything.  It was wonderful - great flavor!  We served with garlic mashed potatoes and roasted brussell sprouts w/pancetta.  Excellent combo.  This is a recipe I will definitely include in my "go to" file.  Not only easy to prepare, but beautiful to serve.

Turned out awesome. Did make it with bacon on inside on one and bacon on outside. Outside was better bacon was crispier.  I also wilted spinach in bacon grease and garlic and added a little Canadian spice to the outside. Winner recipe!!!

This was very good however; if I make it again, which I more than likely will, I won't use thick cut bacon. It didn't cook through. I would use either regular cut or better yet prosciutto. Also I used skirt steak.

Really fantastic recipe! I ended up marinating the meat for about 8 hours, making the roll, then putting back in the marinade again . . . because, you know, life doesn't always go as planned! We ended up eating this tonight - a good 24 hours after I made the roll, and it was delicious! We like our meat medium-rare, so I cooked it only to about an internal temp of 125, then let it rest. Next time - I will pre-cook the bacon a bit before making the roll because of this. It was so juicy and flavorful! Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe!

Made this for company one night.  It turned out great, lots of compliments and a print off of the recipe.  After reading through the previous reviews here are my tweaks to this;  I did not have a flank steak, so I used very thin sliced sirloin and made individual rolls.  I used frozen spinach instead.  I precooked the bacon.  I rough chopped the mushrooms, red pepper and bacon, plus added onion and gorgonzola along with the provolone.  I sprinkled garlic powder over it all before rolling the steak (b/c we don't cook anything w/o onion and garlic).   I rolled and placed seam side down on foil lined pan.  Sprinkled sea salt and pepper over top of rolled steaks and baked for the 1hr--which was perfect.  I made a sauce from the drippings, added beef broth and a splash of red wine and cornstarch---YUM.   I served with asparagus and wild rice in which I added the left over mushrooms, red pepper and onion.  Looked wonderful and tasted great!  Oh, and I only marinated for 3-4hrs, which was plenty.

I made this exactly as the recipe calls for, and it was amazing!! The only change I might do next time is cook the bacon  a bit first or maybe swap it out all together and use prosciutto instead. I served it with rice, and dribbled the pan drippings over it, YUM!

This is an awesome recipe! I substituted onions for the red peppers. Also, keep in mind that the mushrooms and spinach will release a lot of moisture, so I actually drained my filling before rolling it, which made rolling much easier and less slippery.  The man at my local meat department said he had no idea how to butterfly the flank, so I had to do it myself, which of course was a massive balls-up. HOWEVER, a few healthy whacks with a meat mallet quickly set it to rights. I served it with a salad and some roasted potatoes and my family loved it. I'll definitely be making this again to hone my knife skills!

Has a great flavor and at the time I didn't have any mushrooms. I pulled these from the freezer, they freeze well, and cooked them up. Made a mushroom gravy and these were great.

Followed recipe as written, with the exception of taking one steak out after 50 minutes, as we prefer our steak medium-rare; also omitted mushrooms.  I had two steaks, with one being thicker than the other - the thick one I baked for about 70 minutes for medium, so thickness will make a difference.  I marinated over night, and rolled tightly in the am; kept in fridge til ready to roast.  Voila!  

I researched numerous recipes on cooking "rolled flank steaks" and went with the baking method, as this was for a party and baking was the easiest way to go.  But if not in a rush, next time I will make pinwheels (individual slices using toothpicks) and use the "sear, then bake" method (sear one minute per side, then bake for 10-15 minutes in 350 oven).   I think this would be a 5 star with the meat being seared - I think it would also improve the presentation.  Marinating and ingredients go very well together.

Finally!  Been searching for a good rolled flank steak recipe.  This was absolutely amazing!  Followed the recipe exactly, no changes needed.  Amazing flavor, melt in your mouth.  Will do this again and again!  Thank you!

Really good recipe! I'm not big fan of soy sauce so I changed up the marinade for one that I use for grilling meat and turned out to be amazing anyway. For the marinade: I used half a light beer (I've found Corona or Stella are best for this), 1/2 cup of olive oil,  the red bell pepper slices, 1 medium white onion (sliced into half rings), parsley and cilantro to taste, I used a tbsp of each. Also instead of the steak seasoning I added Trader Joe's "21 seasoning salute" (about a tsp). Let it marinade in the fridge for 2-3 hours. I added the veggies from the marinade inside the roll, along with some spinach, grilled leeks and  muenster cheese instead. Making this again for sure.

This dish did not work for me.  The meat was undercooked, the bacon made the dish very greasy and had a very strong taste.

I followed the directions to a T, the center of my meat was still raw when I pulled it out and all of my cheese had melted & pooled out into the bottom of the baking dish.  If I attempt this again I will reduce the amount of olive oil it seemed a greasy.

This was sooo good!  It was also very easy to make.  The only thing I did differently was to use the pre-cooked bacon bits found in the salad dressing isle.  I use these all of the time being a working mom with three kids, it is a real time saver.  My husband loved the way it tasted and the presentation made me look like a pro!

This is a fabulous recipe. I Marinated the steak for two days before baking, and it melted in your mouth. I did bake it for an hour and a half, as I like my steak med. Well, and it was just a little pink in the middle...perfection.   Will be making it again soon!

I enjoyed this recipe and will probably make it again, but next time I will use ham or Canadian bacon instead of regular bacon.  The flavor was too much and I do not care for bacon this way.  It was transparent and chewy.

This was a major hit at our last family gathering.  The presentation factor was huge!  It's really easy to make too; the hardest part of it was butterflying the steak.  If you can't get your butcher to do it, just make sure you have a super sharp knife!

My family raved on this recipe.  This looks harder than it really was to make. It's beautiful yet full of flavor. I don't like to change a recipe on the first try but I didnt use the bacon and used roasted red bell pepper instead of fresh.  Also I thinly sliced some red onion for that extra oomf.  LOVE LOVE LOVE!

This was an excellent recipe!  The only thing I did different was I used a 1/3 (strong) bleu cheese to 2/3 provolone mix--I didn't want to overpower the whole dish, but I definitely wanted some bleu cheese with this steak.  Also, I can't stand bell pepper, but I left it in because my father likes them (and this was a Father's Day meal)...and I'm happy to report that the flavor (surprisingly) played well with everything else.  I can't help but feel like it's missing something...maybe a couple sprigs of mint or cilantro (I'm 1/2 Thai, so that's my taste).  All-in-all, however, this has been one of the best recipes I've found on this website.  5 stars!

I made this for a birthday dinner and it was WONDERFUL! I couldn't believe it! The meat was a bit tough on the outside but it tasted great and was very juicey on the inside.   The cheese did melt out more than I had hope so next time I make this I will close off all sides but it was worth all the time and effort. I used two 1 pound steaks and they still turned out great.   I would recomend this for any one who wants something new.

This turned out FANTASTIC!  The hardest part (for me) was butterflying the steak.  I followed the recipe pretty closely - I decided to microwave the bacon strips for about 1.5 minutes (great tip). The only other difference was that I used jarred roasted red pepper instead of raw and left out the mushrooms (we don't like them).  The meat's flavor came out really good - I let it marinade for about 5-6 hours and cooked it for the full hour. Weber makes a great Chicago steak seasoning that may have helped - my husband doesn't usually like flank steak but he said that this recipe made him a believer!  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious!  Cutting the steak was a bit of a pain, but everything else was easy!  The only thing I left out were the mushrooms just because I don't like them.  Made this for a Christmas family party & everyone raved over how good it was.  The presentation factor was huge too.  Really looked & tasted great!

What an amazing meal! This was not too difficult to make (I didn't even cut myself when butterflying the meat!), and the result was awesome! Everyone raved about this meal (even my Dad who is a very picky eater), and the leftovers were equally delicious.  Thank you for sharing this with us--it has been added to our rotation of recipes!

I used to go to Costco on special occasions and by this exact same meal. It would cost me  around $25. I was able to make it for way cheaper and it was wonderful. My husband was so impressed.

This was great.  With a little foresight, this is a really easy meal to prepare.  We cut back the oil to 1/4 C and used only 3 slices of cheese and thought it was wonderful!  I would make this for company and will make for my family again.

This was very good and makes such an impressive presentation! I found it to be a lil salty though. Not sure if it was the marinade, bacon, or cheese, or everything put together. I wont marinade overnight next time and yes, there definitely will be a next time!

Excellent flavor.  I made this recipe exactly as directed, however, I found it to be a too salty.  I don't know if it was the bacon or the soy sauce that caused it to be too salty.  I plan on making this again and figuring it out! Thank you for the recipe!

This was exactly what I was looking for!  I didn't have mushrooms on hand so I left them out, but I am sure it would be delish with them.  The marinade works great on steak as well.  Definitely a keeper.
