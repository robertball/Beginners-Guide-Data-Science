I hate when people alter the recipe and then rate the recipe based on the changes they made.  I believe rating should be on the recipe as it is written.  That being said, we're giving this one 5 stars.  I can see how some of the suggested additions/adjustments could be good as well, but the recipe is wonderful as is.  The aroma, flavor and texture were all good enough that I could see this soup served at a fine restaurant.  The ingredients all worked together very well and there wasn't anything that seemed out of place.  I was worried about the dill and thought it would overpower but it definitely does not.  

I can see how some people might find this soup to be a little on the heavy side (with the half-and-half and the butter) or salty side (with the use of regular chicken broth), but personally I don't think anything needs to be done.  I think it's a good fall soup worth trying.

Wonderful soup and perfect for a cold snowy day!  Made exactly as written and received great reviews from those heading in from the slopes.  Based on personal preference, I reduced the butter down to 2.5 tablespoons of butter - couldn't tell the difference.  Will definitely go into my family's list of favorites!!!

My grandfather grew up in Poland near the Russian border and this potato soup reminds me of our family recipe.  This soup is comforting, rich, delicious, and not your ordinary potato soup but out of this world!  I substituted onions for leeks, and added 1/2 cup sour creme in addition to half and half.  I used portabella mushrooms rather than button mushrooms for richer flavor.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

I reviewed this a while back.  Had to update the process I intend to use from now on.  I found that the cream and flour mixture to thicken the soup wasn't necessary IF you blend at least half the soup before adding the mushrooms.  The blended potato made it chowder-like.  I also added a dollop of sour cream for a nice tart flavor, and shredded cheese on top.  LOVE IT!

This soup was fabulous! The broth was so good! I used a sweet onion instead of leeks and I sauteed the potatoes and onion together before putting it into the soup and then sauteed the carrots. I just cut my mushrooms and put them straight into the soup. I can't wait to make it again.

Mmmmm....wonderful....I substituted the half and half for plain yogurt mixed with a bit of water and also whole wheat flour works well....I also pureed half the veggies in my blender at the end of the recipe and mixed it back into the soup for a more creamy texture....fabulous! Thank you!

this is a very tasty, simple soup.  i left out the salt and used portabello and shitake mushrooms.  also, i always use veg. broth and never salt anything as to me the broth is pretty salty.  next time i'll try it with the sour cream or the cheese suggested earlier.  Very good.  Thanks!

Wonderful soup! Everyone loved this. The only change I made was to use light sour cream in place of the half and half. I loved the addition of the fresh dill at the end. To me that made the soup really special. Next time I make this I think I'll puree some of it as other reviewers suggested. I think I'd do that before I add the mushrooms though. Thanks so much for this great recipe!

One of the best soup recipe's I've found on this site.I ended up using 4 leeks, about 24 whole baby carrots, an extra potato and 2 bags (20 oz.) Crimini mushrooms.
Needed closer to 8 cups broth (used Better Than Boullion) and skipped the salt. Stuck with the same amount of dill, also adding 1 tsp. dried parsley,1/2 tsp. crushed bay leaf, 1/2 tsp. marjoram and a pinch of granulated garlic. The soup turned out just perfect for us; not too thick, not too thin. The aroma was driving us nuts as it simmered. DTERESA, I can see why you've been making this one for 15 years... it's amazing. Thank you!

I made two concessions to healthful eating when I made this soup this weekend: I omitted the salt altogether and substituted no-fat evaporated milk for the half-and-half.  No regrets on either front.  I had been afraid the lack of salt would make for blandness, but after a night in the fridge, this soup is plenty flavorful.  I have long found that using no-fat evap generally works as a sub for cream, etc.  Oh, and (at least for me) no need to peel the potatoes!  Great winter soup.  I will be eating it for lunch all this week!  yum.  Thanks!

Perfect for a cool, rainy night.  After making several times, have cut back the dill by a half teaspoon but otherwise usually make as written.  To avoid getting another pan dirty I saute the mushrooms in the dutch oven first, then transfer them out to a bowl and set aside to add in at the end.  You can use half and half for a richer flavor, or even cream if you have it on hand.  Divine.

This was a fantastic, flavourful soup! As a Ukrainian, it was very reminiscent of one my grandmother used to make and one that I have not had in such a looon time. I did lighten the recipe though in the calorie department, I used Olive Oil for sauteeing in place of the butter and I used fat-free sour cream in place of the half and half. I threw in some green beans for good measure too! Wonderful, hearty flavour that definitely filled me up! especially on such a cold and snowy day! Thanks for the recipe!

I love this soup.  However, I made a few changes. First, I omitted the mushrooms because I don't like them. Second, I pureed about half of the soup in the food processor because I like a smoother soup. Third, I added 2 cups of sharp cheddar cheese.  It was quick, and my family loved it.  I will definitely make this soup again!

If you are vegetarian and/or lactose intolerant, you can make the soup as I did with vegetable broth and omitting the dairy (mix the flour with 1 cup of broth instead of the half and half).  The soup came out absolutely delicous with these changes. I made it Halloween night as the author suggested!

A really terrific recipe..The only change was that I used 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 vegetable broth...The ones in the carton are the best...I also added more mushrooms and potatoes and did like one other rater sugested, I smashed half of the potatoes before combing all.

I'm living in Russia for the year and the weather just turned cold. Served this and everyone raved. Instead of leeks, I used 2 small onions and 2 celery stalks. I skipped the bay leaf. And at the end, I blended it all up for a smooth consistency. Ochen vekoosnoy (very delicious)!

This was quite easy and quick.  I prefer a thicker soup as well, so I just mashed the potaotes with a masher right in the pot before adding the mushrooms.  No need to dirty the blender.  I used baby portabello caps and a wild mushroom mix.  It needed a bit more seasoning as well.  I used half skim milk and half cup of the half and half to spare a few calories...plus I did a butter/olive oil mix for sauteeing.  A nice hearty fall soup.

This is definitely in the top 3 of soups that I've made, and I do make quite a few soups. I was so surprised by how wonderful this soup is that I had to review it. I was skeptical of the dill; I love dill, but I couldn't imagine it in a potato soup because I've never tried it before, but the dill MAKES this dish.I followed the recipe as closely as possible--I only had half a pound of sliced baby bellas (would have been even better with the full pound), and I didn't have half and half, so I used 1% milk and added a few tablespoons of light sour cream to add in more richness and some tang. This was so good, I am embarrassed to say that we (the two of us) ate 3/4 of it in one sitting!! I served it with pumpernickel bread. This is a very easy, low stress, fast meal. You can't go wrong!

This was fantastic! My boyfriend requested that I put chicken in it, so I boiled 2 chicken breasts and shredded them. I added the chicken after the potatoes were done and let it all simmer together for 10 minutes or so. I omitted the leeks and threw in a clove of garlic, chopped. I also skipped adding the flour; it was plenty thick for our tastes. The only other changes I made were to add about a 1/2 cup of light sour cream and about 1 cup of shredded cheese right after adding the half and half. The dill was the perfect flavor for this dish; we LOVED it. Thank you!

This soup is fantastic!!!!  I made it last night for dinner and it was a huge hit.  I did take some of the suggestions made by others like mashing about 1/2 a cup of the potatoes and adding them back in for a thicker soup and using sour cream instead of the half and half.  Other than that kept everything else the same.  Thanks so much for this great recipe.

This was fabulous! I followed the recipe exactly but used sour cream instead of the half-and-half. I love how the dill gives the soup a fresh twist. Part familiar, part exciting. Warm, creamy and tasty with chunks of veggies. Thanks for sharing!

I loved this soup! :D My husband and I were skeptical, nevering having had Russian cuisine before. However, we are VERY happy with this soup and will be making it again! The ONLY changes I made were 2 tbls (heaping) of Sour Cream and I substituted Whole Milk for 1/2 and 1/2 since I had none. Also - we garnished with "Fiesta-blend" cheese. Five stars, all the way!!

Good comfort food for this cold weather! Added 1 chopped onion and 1 minced clove of garlic to the carrots and leeks. Reduced salt to 1 tsp and used heavy cream instead of half & half because I didn't have any. My 11 month old baby couldn't get enough and even my husband who's not into soups liked it.

Kept it healthier by omitting the flour and Half & Half.  Instead, before adding the mushrooms, I removed about a 1/3 to 1/2 of the cooked leeks, carrots and potatoes, then used an immersion blender to puree what was left in the soup.  This thickened the soup wonderfully.  Returned the rest to the pot and added the mushrooms.  Seasoned to taste.  Simply delicious.  Yum!!!!

This soup certainly delivered the goods according to my wife and I.  On soup recipes like this, we tend to omit the cream, or 1/2 & 1/2, not on any principle, but because we haven't found that it adds to the flavor.

I saw this and sent it to my mom who loves to make soup.  She gave my husband and me half and we LOVED it!  She, like I, never change a recipe the first time we make it so as to see what the originator of the recipe intends for it to taste like.  With that in mind, my mom didn't change a thing.  This recipe needs no altering.  I'm going to make it soon.  Thanks for sharing!

Very Good! This soup is unique in flavor but very yummy! The Dill is the key. I did add both button mushrooms and shataki mushrooms and a little extra potatoes. Next time I will use mostly the shataki mushrooms, they are a little "meatier" and stronger in flavor. Even my daughter, who does not like mushrooms, liked this soup. She just didn't eat the mushrooms. More for me, Yum!! Oh, and I would recommend cutting back on the salt if you are watching your sodium, and maybe use a low sodium broth. Great flavor!!!

I made this for Halloween.  Absolutely fabulous.  I was afraid it called for too many mushrooms but they reduced by 2/3 in the saute.  Gave some to a sick neighbor and she called back raving about it.  I won't wait for next halloween to make this again.  Thanks!

Excellent.  Perfect as written, I tasted before modifying.  I took the blender suggestion and added about 1/3 to 1/2 of the soup to the blender and added it back in.  A big hit at my house, and yes we made it on Halloween.

Absolutely sumptuous! The only changes I made were minor. I had fresh dill, so used it in place of dried, and I puréed the vegetables, so that thickening with flour was unnecessary. At that point, the texture was creamy and rich, making the cream enrichment unnecessary, as well, when calories are a concern. Of course, the half and half made it decadently rich!  Another variation is to skip the half and half, and garnish each bowl with a tablespoon of sour cream. Very Russian! At the end of the simmering, the flavor of the dill becomes quite subdued. It blends in and points up the other tastes to perfection. The resulting flavor is deep and earthy.  You could easily sub vegetable broth or stock for the chicken broth to make this vegetarian-friendly. Add a salad and a crusty loaf of newly-born bread, and you have a healthy, memorable meal, perfect for a cold, snowy evening, or a Lenten Friday supper. Comfort food at its best.

I just made this and it is awesome! It's still on the stove and because I did not have all the ingredients I subbed red onion for leek and fat free sour cream for half & half. It still rocks. I am lucky enough to have a pallet that can "picture" the flavor profiles of other ingredients. So to those out there who want to bash folks for reviewing an altered recipe. Get over yourself. People know what they like without your judgment. Captain of the reality police Dannyz

This was WONDERFUL!!!!  My husband went back 3 times for more and told me we needed to have it at least once a week!  I didn't notice much of a difference after adding the 1/2 & 1/2 flour mixture so I added a little sour cream.  Still didn't notice a difference but I thought the taste was amazing!

This is excellent.  I've made this multiple times as written with the exception of using onions in place of the leeks.  My husband is Russian and his mom didn't make cream based soups so now when I make it I leave out the milk but either way it is an excellent recipes.

Very Good! I was shocked about the dill, I never had a potato soup with dill but it really worked well. I did however mash some of the potatoes to thicken the soup just for my personal preference.

Added celery and didn't peel the (red) potato's (we love skins).  Pureed about 1/4 of the soup before adding the mushrooms.  Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly.  DELICIOUS!  Next time, and there WILL be a next time, I will try to cut down on the butter where I feel it's not needed.  I also might replace some of the half and half with yogurt or sour cream.

Someone said it was hard to mess this recipe up. I used water in place of the broth and rutabaga instead of the potatoes. The leeks I used were getting a little soft and in place of the cream I used soy milk. Even with all of those changes this was a very good soup that comes together easily.

A last minute search for something to make for dinner led me to this awesome recipe.  Wanting to make the soup but being limited to what I had in my refrig/pantry I had to make some changes to the recipe. My family says that this is the best soup I have ever made.  Here are the changes:  I used onions instead of leeks; diced 1/4 large red pepper and sauteed with onions and carrots; used chunked portabella mushroom caps; omitted the 1/2 and 1/2 and the flour but added about 3oz sour cream instead at the end.  This is a keeper!!

This soup was good, but turned out less hearty than I expected. I added about a teaspoon of cayenne pepper and that did the trick. All the measurements were right on, it's a good recipe.

Really good! I only gave it 4 stars because I only added 1 tsp. salt as I felt 2 tsp. was way too much. I was right - if I had used 2 tsp. as the recipe states, it would have been inedible. Even with just 1 tsp. the soup was a little too salty (and I love salt!). I think it really depends on your chicken stock. The recipe should say "salt to taste" rather than specify 2 tsp.
Anyway, it was very delicious - great flavour!

I didn't make this exact recipe, but I'm going to review it anyway. I used mostly the same ingredients, but I added turnips because I had a ton of them in the fridge. I used two small yellow onions in place of leeks and let them caramelize over low heat for about half an hour before I added the other ingredients. I didn't use butter or half and half, but I pureed about half of the potatoes, turnips, and onions and the soup is wonderfully thick and creamy. I also added a tiny bit of crushed red pepper, ground mustard, and dried sage, and I used vegetable broth (I'm a vegetarian). Overall, this soup came out DELICIOUS, and super low fat! The only fat used was about a tablespoon of olive oil to sweat the onions. Probably going to make this again.

This is always a big hit with my family (hubby, 5yo, 3yo, and 18mo old).  I've made this a couple of times following the recipe almost exactly (left out the flour) and it is very very good. I've also made it using 4c vegetable broth 2c water (since the box broth comes in 32oz sizes) and replaced the half and half plus flour mixture with heavy cream since I'm not a huge fan  of adding flour to soups.  If you add a little extra potato and blend about a cup or two of the soup at the end and add it back that will thicken the soup up nicely.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Quick and easy soup to make.   I added celery and left the bay leaf in longer for more flavor.  I used fat free milk and added some fresh corn when I had it.

Excellent "Fall" soup.  I followed the recipe exactly but I used fat free half and half.  I figured that with all the butter in it, then it wouldn't make much of a difference.  It is DELICIOUS!!  (I can't imagine how full fat half and half would make it any better.)  I'm not ashamed to say that I'm eating it for breakfast. It's that good!

I really enjoyed this soup and look forward to making it again.  I was scared that it would be too bland or maybe even "earthy" but it was so flavorful!

This is a simple soup, but satisfying and very good. My daughter can't eat dairy, so I add a splash of half-and-half to my bowl at the table. I do not thicken with flour. Otherwise I make it as written, and we both enjoy it immensely.

Very good!  My husband always said that he's not a big fan of mushrooms, but he really enjoyed this soup!!!  This is going into my personal recipe box, and lets just say very few recipes make it there.  Thanks so much for sharing!!!

Wonderfully quick and easy to put together.  I slow cooked all day - then put it all in the cuisinart.  It could have used a little more "oomph" but it was still a yummy soup for a cold night.

Do not change a thing.  This recipe is perfect as is.  It's like cream of mushroom with extra hardiness.  The fresh dill makes it yummy!  I have also used frozen dill that we grow and keep in the freezer over the winter.

A delicious soup that I'll make again.  I did smash some of the potatoes with a wooden spoon against the side of the pot to help thicken the soup...next time I'll add an extra potato or two just for thickening.  This needed less than half the amount of salt...definitely taste it first, before adding all of the salt.

This is brilliant. I couldn't find leeks at a reasonable price ($5.29/lb is not reasonable) so I substituted garlic and celery, but even then it was delicious! Highly recommended.

A wonderful, hearty soup.  I substituted chopped onions for the leeks and regular milk for the half and half with great results.  A keeper for sure!

My husband looked this soup up and asked me to make it.  I never even touched leeks before.  I was a little hesitant to try it when it was finished, so I got out a small bowl.  I felt like Papa Bear with the big bowl when I was finished.  We ate the whole pot of soup in the day it was cooked.  The next week, I was out buying the stuff to make it again!!!  Love it!!!!

I am a soup fanatic.  I have tried many soup recipes on this website.  This recipe, my fellow allrecipe friends, is truly one of the best--certainly in the top five.  The only thing I modified had to do with mushrooms.  I used three different types of mushrooms: shiitake, portobello, and button mushrooms.  Do not fiddle with anything else.  This recipe is perfect as is.  The thing that makes this such a great recipe is that it combines an earthy, home-made style with spices that generate a more exotic taste than what one might expect from the ingredients.  Believe me, this one will make you look good. I would happily pay for this one in a restaurant.

Very Easy and Very Yummy!!!!  I followed some of the tips from others - used sour cream instead of The half and half, and I pureed half of the soup to make it creamier. I also cooked the mushrooms first in the pot, then set them aside while the soup cooked - saved a little on clean up. Why clean two heavy pans when you can get by with one and a small bowl??

Excellent. I omitted the salt and used milk instead of half n' half. I also mashed a few of the potatoes and added them back to the soup to make it a little bit thicker. I'll be making this one often over the winter months, it tastes SO good and is such comfort food!

I used onions(yellow, kinda big) instead of leeks, cut the chicken broth to two soup can size and used light cream in place of half & half.  It was great!  I think the pan cooking of the baby bella mushrooms really made a difference.  Don't take a short cut with this step.  This is now one of my top 5 soups.

Wow, was this absolutely delicious.  It has been deemed a favorite on the first try!  I used onions rather than leeks.  Other than that, made as directed.

I had a friend who went to Russia for two years and said their food was really bland.  He must not have had this soup, because it's great!
I made it exactly as written except that I backed off on the dill just a tad and I used a few bursts of my stick blender before I added the mushrooms, just to make it a little thicker consistancy.  My family loved it, even my picky eaters.  Will definitely add it to our winter soup collection.

Perfect. Next time I'll decrease the butter as there was a bit too much floating at the top. I used 1/2c  half and half instead of 1 cup and it was the great -not too thick (chowder-like) or watery.

This was a wonderful soup.  My husband, who is not a big soup eater, ate three bowls.  The flavours meld together so well, it was quite delicious.  I was worried about the amount of dill, but it was just right.  I will definitely make this again.

To accommodate the Slavic tastebuds, I make this recipe using half amount of mushrooms with wild variety; can use dried mushrooms, soaked for an hour, adding the soaking liquid to the soup.  By request, I prepare this with 1/2 less the suggested amount of potato, for more focus on mushroom flavor.

Not bad, but not extraordinary either. May try again with an extra leek and more mushrooms.

Also, I passed on the salt addition as the broth already contributed plenty.

Loved this recipe. I still have to try it with all the correct ingredients, but I was pretty happy with my substitutions. I was out of dill, so i used a dalmatian sage instead, and i didnt have any half and half, used 1% milk. Additionally i added some broccoli flowerettes and a little bit of chopped celery. Everyone loved it and as i said, i look forward to trying the pure recipe.

Delicious recipe!  I used onions instead of leeks like some others did.  Also deglazed mushrooms with a splash of dry white wine and added a pinch og garlic powder.  Be careful not to scald half and half.  Reheat gently on low, do not boil.

This soup is absolutely wonderful and I don't see myself making my regular old potato soup again!  I made it pretty much as written and adore it- the dill, leeks, mushrooms (I used portabella)- it just has a unique taste.  HIGHLY recommended from me!

Following the directions, my soup came out rather bland and too chunky for my taste.  I would have preferred it to be more stew-like or maybe I'd process the vegetables finer next time.

Mmmmm!  Delicious!  I was pretty faithful to the recipe, only adapting a few ingredients.  Before I added the mushrooms, I pureed the soup in the pot.  I only had a few fresh mushrooms, which I chopped and sauteed.  I also had some dried mushrooms, which I chopped and reconstituted in hot water.  I then strained these out of water and sauteed them as well.  I then added to the soup both these  mushrooms as well as the water they soaked in.  I didn't have any cream, so I used milk instead.  Based on other reviewers' comments, I chose not to add the flour.  Thanks for sharing, Dteresa!

I am not a big potato soup fan, and I just tried this one because it sounded so unusual.  I had never bought a leek before in my life and had to look up online which parts were usable!  I ended up using the white part plus about two inches of green (after removing the very outer green layer).  I also was worried about so much dill but this recipe is INCREDIBLE!!  One of the best I've ever tried on this site!  I used sliced baby portabello mushrooms instead of button.  Wow, this one's a keeper!!

This soup was ok, it was pretty bland. It tasted like cream of mushroom and cream of potato soup combined. This will be a good alternative when I don't want to use the canned versions in other recipes. Not too impressive alone.

This is a highly flavorful soup! I made some adjustments for personal preference which I'll share with you at the end. I made the soup between Christmas and New Years Eve because it seemed to be a festive soup, which it is, but I will make it again at any time of the year. Caution: you must like the smell/taste of dill weed, as the herb heavily infuses the soup and your kitchen!

Adjustments made: 
In place of all butter I used 2 Tablespoons butter and 3 Tablespoons olive oil. In place of the chicken broth I used vegetable broth.  I decreased the dried dill weed from 2 teaspoons to 1 teaspoon. Finally, in place of all the half and half I used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 half and half.  Add the sour cream last and heat gently. Reheat leftovers gently because the sour cream can curdle.

Delicious!!!

Not a fan of potato soups, I wondered how a potato soup could be rated 5 stars by so many. Then I made it. It is delicious, my a new favorite! We used Yukon gold potatoes, leeks not onions. The only change we made was fewer mushrooms since we only had half the required mushrooms on hand, and it still had a great mushroom flavor. This is the first time I've bothered to review a recipe -- that's how good it is!

Butter.  Its what's for dinner.  But seriously, this type of soup is supposed to be very rich and I think this is a pretty good recipe.  However I think the Hungarian Mushroom Soup recipe is a much better one and adds subtle flavors such as lemon (for tangyness), soy sauce, and paprika.

Wow, this was good!  For something slightly different I think I'll add some clams and fish for a chowder, but it's definitely wonderful as is.

I've made this several times now, substituting sour cream for the half-and-half.  The last time I made it with fresh chanterelles and portabellas and OMG did that ever kick it up a notch!  The wild mushrooms make it absolutely phenomenal.

I made the recipe exactly as called for but I did add two ribs of celery diced.  The soup turned out fantastic.  I wished I had cooked my mushrooms a little longer but that was my issue not a problem with the recipe.  I would just suggest cooking the mushrooms to your desired tenderness before adding to the soup.  I think this is the best soup I have ever made!

I COOK FOR A SUNDAY BRUNCH CROWD OF ABOUT 70 PEOPLE. I SAW THIS LAST WEEK AND DECIDED TO TRY IT. EVERYONE WENT CRAZY OVER THIS SOUP. THE ONLY CHANGE I MADE WAS TO USE RED POTATOES. THEY WERE ALL I HAD ON HAND. IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT THE SOUP POT IS SCRAPED TO THE BOTTOM!

Proof of the simple recipe yielding spectacular results! And an adventure for dill-lovers. 

Though I was tempted to substitute with expectedly delicious sweet onions, the leeks gave beautiful color and textur to the soup.  And the smell!  

After sauteeing the mushrooms, there was quite a bit of water I withheld (from adding to the rest of the broth).  I prefer this soup to the creamiest degree -- what with all the vegetables! my preference, a thick vegetable soup -- and if I had added all of the water from the mushrooms, it would have gone thin.

Someday I hope to have children... who will grow to be nostalgic about this soup. : )

Wow, no matter how this recipe is prepared and what changes are made it is always the bomb!  I have made this to recipe, I have ground up the potato and eliminated the cream, I have even eliminated the potato and used barley instead. I have used a variety of mushrooms as well as using onion in place of the leeks. Cannot go wrong ALWAYS A WINNER!!!

After 167 other stellar reviews, I should not be surprised that this soup was the hit that it was.  Despite my fourteen year old's objections to finding mushrooms in the soup (go figure), the mushrooms were consumed along with the rest of the soup, rather than picked out as I had anticipated.  With that in mind, next time I may chop the mushrooms into smaller, less distinguishable bits, instead of just slicing them.  I might also add a couple extra potatoes and a carrot or two for a little more texture.  The only changes I made to the recipe this first time around were to use rice flour rather than wheat (due to gluten intolerance), and to add a quarter cup of lite sour cream.  My family agreed that this soup tasted like something we would find at one of out favorite restaurants.  This recipe is a keeper!

A very yummy soup! I used vegetable broth instead of chicken and did everything else according to the recipe. As per another reviewer's suggestion, I kept the soup on the stove after adding the flower mixture for another 10 minutes, stirring constantly. I will do the same thing next time because it also helps blend all the flavors.

This soup is so awesome.  It's so hearty yet nutritious and healthy at the same time.  The first time I made this, my brother kept raving about it.  I used baby bella mushrooms because I'm not a big fan of button mushrooms.  Bellas are definitely tastier in my opinion.  Also I make sure I sautéed the mushrooms (Don't move them around in the pan or they wont caramelize).  I was disappointed the second time because I forgot to add leeks, so I substituted an onion instead.  It still came out great (and my sister actually preferred the onion over the leek).  I like leeks better in soups.  : )  Thanks for the recipe!
Oh, serving this soup in a bread bowl is great.  It actually makes the soup thicker if you scrape the bottom, and you can make croûtons from the inside of the bread!

Very delicious soup. Maybe not the healthiest thing ever with the butter and cream, but really good. My girlfriend (born in russia) said it was close to a traditional soup, but the "real deal" is a bit more brown, probably because of the type of forest-picked mushrooms used (i used regular white mushrooms).

I made this soup last weekend and would not share it.  Going to make it again this weekend.  I also used onion instead of leek and put about 1/2 in a food processor to thicken it rather then use flour.  I'm going to add more mushrooms today but that is just because I'm a mushroom lover.  Best soup I've had in a long time.  Thank you!

Excellent! We fixed this while my mother-in-law was visiting from the Ukraine, and we all thoroughly enjoyed the soup.  It does taste authentic Russian.  It has quite a bit more flavor than you would first guess when looking over the ingredient list.

made this yesterday.  will be a staple in my recipe box.  it was very good.  made exactly as directed, didn't change a thing because it wasn't necessary.  i wouldn't recommend substituting onions for leeks because the flavor simply won't be the same.

I thought this was great, very chucky and hardy. My husband thought it was good. I made it in the crock pot while I worked. Potatoes and carrots were still firm while still fully cooked. The mushrooms were perfectly done. I, however, could not find a leek to save my life, so I had to leave that out. Was probably so much better with it. I will make it again (when I can find a leek) Thanks.

Absolutely delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used whole milk instead of half and half as that is what i had on hand.  I used brown mushrooms - were great - meaty and lots of flavour.  Look forward to trying with a mix of fall mushrooms available.  A delicious and hearty fall recipe with great flavour.  Will be on my list of favorite soups!

I don't like mushrooms but I wanted to branch out and give this a try. Overall, I really liked this soup but I think if I make it again I'll leave out the mushrooms or substitute something else in their place. I also used onions in place of the leeks.

This is a great recipe!!  My wonderful daugher-in-law from Minnesota (she now lives in Georgia) makes a similar soup, but uses wild rice instead of potatoes.  Don't forget that wild rice takes awhile to cook.  Also, she adds shredded chicken, which gives more substance to the recipe.  By the way, I really appreciate allrecipes.com.

Yum!  I forgot to add the carrots and omitted the flour due to personal taste, but otherwise made it as written.  Savory and delicious!  Mushrooms are nearly impossible to overcook, so I suggest starting by sautéing them in butter in your stock pot first, then adding the leeks and everything else.  That way you have all that amazing flavor on the bottom of the pan to mix into the broth.  Next time I'll remember the carrots and it'll be even better.  Also, it was enough for me to use only three tablespoons butter rather than five.

Really good!  I too don't appreciate it  when a recipe is altered then rated.  That said, I used 2% milk and lightly browned canned mushrooms in butter cause that is what I had on hand.  I imagine it would be even better with fresh mushrooms and 1/2 & 1/2.

Amazing. One of the best recipes I've found on this website. Such a perfect soup for a crisp fall day. The fresh dill at the end is essential. It adds such a delicate herbal flavor. I sauteed a combo of white button and crimini/baby portobello mushrooms. The recipe could not have been easier. Made the recipe exactly as written except I added a touch of Old Bay seasoning at the end to "soup" it up a bit.

I am Russian and I loved this recipe. I've decided against adding half and half. Just added a spoon of sour cream to serve. Most Russians do this while eating soups. While the recipe is perfect as it is, I also added some egg noodles.

Very, very tasty as written.  The dill gives the dish a slightly sweet edge.  If I were looking for a more savory edge, instead of the dill, I might add minced garlic during the initial saute of the carrots and leeks.  Also thought frying 3 strips of chopped bacon and  and using 1 Tbsp of the fat to replace some butter would add nice flavor.

If I could rate this six stars, I would.  I am Polish, through and through.  My grandmother died when I was very young, but what I remember best was her mushroom soup.  I have been searching YEARS for a recipe that brought those memories alive again.  This is it!  The only change I made was to hydrate the mushrooms in white wine.  Absolutely hit it spot on!

Rich, delicious soup. I did substitute canola oil in place of the butter for the sautéing but it still was fabulous. Definitely will make it again!

I did not change any of the recipe ingredients, only used more mushrooms and fewer potatoes because that was what I had in house. Satisfying, warming, delicious soup with complex but light flavors. Thanks for this recipe.

Great flavor. Very easy to make. I used sour cream insted if hal-n-half as suggested by others. I also used green onions in place of the leeks. i will make this again. Very hearty without many calories.

The only change I made was that I didn't peel the (red) potatoes, which added even more color to this visually appealing soup.  It's delicious comfort food that's quick and easy to make and tastes even better the next day.  Next time, I'll use less salt and butter; otherwise, the recipe is perfect as is.

Tastes great! Really good for a cold winter night. It is very filling and satisfying! I like my soups really thick so after the potatoes were soft I purees half of them and poured it back into the soup. It made it extra rich!

Think of this as combining potato and mushroom soups. It is chunky as the finished product is not pureed. Not as heavy as some soups but very filling anyway. Seemed to improve the next day as some things do

This is a wonderfully flavorful soup.  The only addition I made was adding a head of roasted garlic to the onion and carrots during the saute.  Otherwise adhered to the recipe.  Amazing flavors.

This soup is A-mazing!  It is so worth all of the peeling, chopping and sauteeing!  The only change I made was to use sour cream instead of half and half because it's what I had available.  Glad there's enough to freeze leftovers!

Loved this! I actually made this into a vegan gluten-free dish by substituting grapeseed oil for the butter (used slightly less, ~3T), veggie broth for the chicken broth, rice milk for the half-and-half, and about 1/3 cup coconut flour (rather than all purpose). This has become a staple in my house!

This recipe was wonderful.  It was my first attempt at making a potato soup and I am very happy I picked this one.  I didn't pay attention to the servings so we have plenty of leftovers for two people but as long as it warms up good it will be worth eating for many days :)  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This was a delicious and simple recipe to cook in my new dutch oven! I put in about 2 tablespoons of fresh dill in place of the dried and substituted the half and half with sour cream because I didn't have either ingredient. I also cut the salt in half to suit my taste.

I make this soup all the time; it's awesome! I saute the mushrooms at the beginning with onion(no leeks) and carrot and make a rue with the flour and cream. then in goes everything else. I don't see the need to use all the separate pots, this can be a one dish meal. I always have fresh, frozen dill in the freezer, which really makes the soup!

An excellent soup!!! I didn't have any leeks in the house, so I just used to medium white onions instead.  They worked just fine, and tasted great! I only had half a pound of mushrooms as well...I just used that and was very glad, because the whole  pound would have been overkill in my opinion. I think that the two teaspoons of salt is an error in the recipe...I used one and it was plenty...on the salty side if anything. Although I did only use half of the mushrooms...that may have made a difference. To cut down on the amount of fat in this recipe, I used fat-free evaporated milk instead of the half-and-half. The soup was still very rich and creamy...it tasted rich and decadent, but in reality was pretty light. Thanks for sharing the recipe...I will be making this again!

AMAZING!!! You cannot screw this soup up. The first 3 times I made the soup it was to the letter of the recipe. It was absolutely fabulous! The fat content made me want to scream though. So I made a few adjustments for the next few batches (I've made 6 batches in 2 months!!! That's how good this is!). I use only 1 leek because they are HUGE here. Never dwindle the amount of dill... omg... my house smells like a HOME, it's beautiful. Used olive oil/smart balance mixture for sauteing all veggies. Used fat free sour cream. Ok... I've had this recipe with the half-n-half and sour cream... sour cream it MUCH better. I also remove about 2 cups of soup before adding the mushrooms and blend it because I love "cowder" style soup. And during the sauteing mushrooms I add 2 teaspoons of chopped garlic. REMEMBER though that this recipe is good as is... I just like my own adjustments better. We all like to tweek things to make them our own. :)  Happy Cooking!

This was so yummy! I  will definitely be making hits again. I substituted sweet onions for the leeks because I didn't have them on hand. Next time I will try pureeing some of the soup and skipping the half and half for a lower fat version, but it is fabulous as written.

This soup was very tasty! I followed directions pretty closely but made the mistake of mashing the potatoes too much for thickness! I prefer my potatoes in nice chunks as shown! I would definitely make this soup again. Thanks!

I'm not sure how many 5-star reviews one recipe needs, but here's another...This soup recipe sounded good, but was even BETTER than I anticipated. My husband, who rarely eats anything without meat, called this recipe "a Keeper" after his first (of many) bowl. WOW! That never happens! He even suggested I add more veggies - like more carrots and celery.  Thanks, allrecipes, for doing something I've tried for years to do - make my hubby enjoy a meatless meal!!!

OH MAH GOODNESS!! This soup really didn't taste what I thought it would taste like. It's like a WORLD BETTER! The flavor is so well rounded....I really didn't even think it needed garlic or anything else added to it. I had initially thought that the flour needed to be cooked and was going to do that with the mushrooms but said what the hey...I followed the directions and I am so glad that I did! Wonderful soup! No flour-y taste at all. Just follow the directions folks and you will have a pot of good soup!

Mmmm... so good!  Went the quickie route and substituted 3 cans sliced potatoes, a can of cream o'mushie soup and 5 boullion cubes with five cups water. (Instead of fresh potatoes, mushrooms, broth and cream)  Still delicious and it only took about 45 minutes from start to finish.
Amazing deliciousness...TRY IT!

My mom and her boyfriend liked this recipe, but I didn't like it.  It was a bit watery from the broth and just wasn't very good.  But maybe it's just me.

Fabulous recipe!  The whole family loved it.  I used vegetable broth instead of chicken so my vegetarian daughter could eat it too, but left everything else the same.  I served it with grilled cheese after a cold night at football practice.  Perfect!  Will definitely add this to my regular lineup.

Absolutely awesome.  I made as the recipe read but next time I would cut the butter down to a tablespoon and use fat free half and half.  There was too much butter floating on the top.  Even Grumpy loved it!

This soup is absolutely wonderful! All of the ingredients mesh very well together. I have made and tasted many potato soups before, but this one is by far the best. It's nice to have a recipe that is healthy and without all of the cheese. It is made fairly quickly, but tastes like you worked for hours in the kitchen. This will definitely be made again!

This is excellent!  My husband said this is the best soup I ever made - & I have been making soups for 40 years! When I read the ingredients I couldn't see how this would be any better than other soups I had made - but it is.  I used 1/2 Portebello & 1/2 white mushrooms.  Next time will use all Portebello.

Haven't made this yet, but it is very much like the soup I had in Poland in 2007.  I would use the sour cream, blend part of the potatoes instead of a roux, but would add some rehydrated dried mushrooms (any but chinese and shiitake) to up the mushroom flavor even more.   Reconstitute them in some of the broth.
In Poland it was served with rye bread.

This was very tasty! Here are the changes I made to tweak it to our tastes at my house. I left out the dill & bay leaf (didn't have any). I used onions instead of leeks plus added celery. I also boiled two chicken breasts then shredded them and added at the time of the potatoes. At the end I made a roux and heated it with 2% milk to a simmer for the thickening agent prior to mixing in the soup, then let it cook about 5 minutes longer after mixing it into the soup. It did take awhile to prep all the veggies but cooking time was fast. Next time I will add the dill & bay leaf to try to get a bit more "ummpf", I typically like more spicy/salty foods so I also might try some different seasonings to experiment.

I have been making this once a week for the last month! Love this recipe. I am able to make it vegan using soymilk, and veggiebroth instead. Comes out great everytime. My 2 year old loves it! I don't know if I will ever get tired of this recipe, also very easy to make.

I was new to leeks and added the green part of the leeks to the soup the first time I made this soup.  The soup still came out delicious.  I like using crimini/baby bella mushrooms, which I think give the soup an extra hearty flavor.

This was really good hearty soup! My husband is from the Ukraine and he had two servings. I did add more chicken broth to mine because my husband likes it thinner and I increased the spices to compensate. I let it sit for awhile after I put the mushrooms as suggested by another reviewer to get more mushroom flavor. I really don't think the half and half/ flour mixture is even needed to thicken this soup up. I will be making this recipe again!

Originally I thought this soup was just ok, but on the next day it was marvelous.

My husband detests carrots so i did omit them, and i did 2lb of mushroom and 1 pound of potatoes. Also I did add two large portabellos. 

It is great but it is super important to let it stand for a while after you add the mushrooms to have the flavor of the mushroom really seep into the soup and make it super mushroomy.

It is amazingly easy so you get extra points for that.

Also i just did lots of fresh dill as i did not have any dried (not that it matters much if at all )

I served with some crackers.
My husband just consumed 5 ladles full of this for dinner, and had it for lunch too. 

:) tasty!

I ate one bowl of this soup before I stored the rest in the freezer, and at that time I thought it was pretty good. Perhaps if I'd left in the fridge for a couple of days, it would have tasted even better, as soups and casseroles often do. But this is not the case once it's been frozen. Yuck. The potatoes "separated" from the rest of the soup--which was easily fixed with a good whisking--but the mushrooms were chewy and tough, and I suspect they don't respond well to the freezer treatment . . . Feel free to correct me if you've had a different experience.

Chunky, flavorful, and rich - real comfort food. I skipped a step by throwing the mushrooms in while the onions and carrots were first cooking. I also used yogurt instead of half-and-half. This was a hit with every member of my family, not an easy feat!

This was simple and quick and was decent the first night, but I ended up wanting a bit more flavor.  I ended up buying some spicy sausages and slicing them and serving them in this soup, which was very good.  Will make this again because this is good and certainly does not have the calories of other similar soups.

I made this soup for the first time and served at a dinner party for 6 guests.  Everyone raved about it and took the recipe home.  Definately great recipe and will be making again.

A divine soup! I am suprised at how well it turned out. I was floored when I realized I was out of dill, but I had a "savory" blend of herbs which I used instead. I didn't use 2 tsp of salt, only 1, because chicken stock is really salty already. I would add salt to taste. My potatoes only needed 10 minutes in the pot with the lid on before they were tender. I didn't have anywhere near a pound of mushrooms (more like 1/4 pound) so I added some sliced celery along with the carrot and leek. I didn't have 1/2 & 1/2 so I used 1/2 cup heavy cream and 1/2 cup 2% milk. This is a really good veggie soup! You could make this TOTALLY vegetarian by using vegetable stock instead of chicken. Healthy and delicious. Thank you for the recipe!

Wow, so good and easy.  I used leftover mashed potatoes which I made with butter, milk and sour cream....it naturally thickened the broth so I didn't have to use flour.  I also used skim milk instead of half and half so I did 4 cups of broth to 3 cups of skim milk.  Turned out great!!

Wonderful recipe! I made a few changes to make this great soup even healthier:  I used 4 T olive oil with  1/4 c. whole wheat flour to make a roux to get it started.  As it browned I added 6 green onions because I had no leeks.  I threw in the mushrooms (almost double the amount) with 1T butter and let them cook down a little. Then I added the broth, potatoes and spices.  I used only 1/2 t. dill and it was just enough to impart a subtle taste of dill. I had no cream and used evaported milk. I'll definitely make this again.  My daughter is a big mushroom fan.

Simple and delicious!  I used 1 tbsp Smart Balance & 1 tbsp olive oil to sautee the veggies, 2 full cartons (8 cups) of chicken broth, an extra carrot and extra potatoes, and baby bella mushrooms.  Pureed some of the soup before adding the mushrooms, then used only about 1/8 cup flour mixed with 1 cup of 1% milk.  It was plenty thick and creamy enough for us and hubby, daughter and I all loved it. I can't wait to make it for my mother-in-law . . .  she's a soup lover too. It was even better the next day for lunch. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

very good, especially for meatless.  as suggested I pureed about half and tasted it at that point.  It was so good with great consistency that I questioned putting in the flour and half/half. Put it in anyway since it was printed that way and it was fine but not a lot richer.  From here on out I will leave it out and you should too...esp if you want to cut the calories.  thanks.

Very tasty Autumn soup! I chose to puré half of the soup to get a creamy texture without adding the half and half and I sautéed the mushrooms in Noilly Prat - which really made them stand out and made the soup more luxurious.

I followed the recipe but substituted onions for leeks. When making soups I precook my vegetables in the microwave this hastens the cooking process and eliminates spatter.

this soup is Wonderful! Other reviews have said "restaurant quality" and I agree. The only thing I did differently is I didn't have any dill. Other than lack of dill, I followed the recipe. We will be adding this to our regular rotation of soups!

The only changes I made were to replace the leeks (which I did not have on hand) with a medium shallot and a small wedge of white onion. I added the flour to the mushrooms while they were cooking instead of adding the flour to the 1/2 and 1/2.  I did cut the recipe down to more than half because there are only 2 of us. It smelled wonderful while it was cooking. I simmered it longer than noted in the recipe because I think soups taste better the longer they simmer. It is a great recipe!

Delicious.  Have given away the recipe to others after using this recipe when it was my turn to cook for my work Soup Club.  After reading so many reviews and trying a few styles, I suggest:  use portabello mushrooms for the soup and add 4 ounces of sour cream when thickening.  Don't be afraid of the dill.  It's so good!

Good, simple soup. The only alteration I made was using less butter, and in the method: I sauted the mushrooms first, then put aside. Then I sauted the leeks and carrots in the same pot, so I only used one pot/pan in total. For me, the soup is the main dish and thus 12 servings=6 large-ish servings.

boy, is this scrumptious!  such a wonderful flavor and the addition of the dill just adds to the dish; it is not overpowering but compliments so nicely.  Only thing i did differently was to cook the carrots, mushrooms, and leaks all in the same pan and then deglazed with a bit of white wine.  I had 3 leeks in the bunch so used all 3.  I didn't bother with the flour.  I used my immersion blender to blend a few bowlsful, and realized I would not need it.  Used ff half & half, and a big dollop of greek yogurt at the end.  the consistency was perfect without the flour.  both portabella and button mushrooms used.  I used half pound more of mushrooms, and half pound less of potatoes out of preference.  I can easily see where this could be made vegan by using vegetable broth, and omitting the cream portion.  With the immersion blender, it blends it up nicely to make it thick.  I even hesitated to add the cream after tasting the portion I had blended with the immersion blender.  perfect recipe, so easy to prepare, and budget-friendly as well.  thanks so much!  will definitely make again.

I just made this recipe, and it was wonderful! I loved all of the vegetables, and the dill added a nice depth of flavor to the soup. I was going to add the flour and half & half at the end, but I couldn't resist trying the soup at that point. It tasted so wonderful that I didn't add the half & half. My husband, who is not a fan of soups, also loved this soup.

I have a favorite potato soup recipe using ham and I really didn't expect to like this recipe more, but I liked the idea of having mushrooms in the soup so I decided to try it.  That recipe has now been replaced; this was amazing.  One change I will make next time is to put the flour in with the vegetables before the broth (to make a roux) to make sure the flour doesn't lump. As the recipe is, I could see lumps, but I couldn't tell they were there while eating.  My fiance asked that I make this again next week... and often.  My 7-year-old boy loved this soup as well and didn't say a word (he's normally chatty) until his bowl was empty and he was asking for seconds.

I've tried making this recipe with some of the variations people mentioned. The last time I made it, I went back to the original recipe except I used fresh dill and vegetable stock, since I'm vegetarian. I do like to get a couple of different kinds of mushrooms for flavor. This is by far the best soup I've ever had. I make a huge pot for my family and neighbors and it's gone in a day or 2.  Everyone loves it.

Delicious. Made it exactly as stated, except I did forget the carrots. The soup is amazing and if you're worried about the dill, don't be, it blends right in. Will definitely make again.

This soup was great!  I make soup all the time and my husband said this was the best he's ever had.  I added green beans b/c I didn't have carrots, but besides that I followed the recipe exactly.

I had to omit the dill as I didn't have any and replaced the leeks with celery but other than that, omg it was perfect! I used vegeta, a croatian seasoning, instead of chicken broth/stock because my boyfriend is vegetarian but it was a huge hit! I love the cream and flour mixture. Made it really creamy. Perfect cream of potatoe soup.  10 stars in my books.

This was excellent! We didn't have leaks so used sweet white onion. We also used light sour cream instead of the flour and half&half. It could have been thicker but it really didn't matter. A nice piece of pumpernickel on the side and we needed nothing more. Great recipe!

This soup is delicious! My family and I enjoy it so much that I have memorized the recipe from making it so many times. It also makes a great slow cooker project. I add all ingredients to the crock pot minus butter and let them cook all day, then add the cream and flour mixture for thickening a bit before it's finished. In fact this cooker method has become my adapted way of making this soup every time.

Before making this, I had no idea what a leek even was.  I just happened to get some leeks free and was looking for a recipe to use them.  I had all the ingredients for this one and OH MY!  This will definitely be something I make over and over again.  My whole family loved it and raved over how delicious it was.  Thanks DTERESA!

I made this recipe as written (except I used a white onion because I didn't have any leeks).  Everyone loved it!  When I served it I sprinkled a few freshly cooked crisP bacon bits and sliced green onion on top.   Amazing!!!!

Awesome soup! I make it as written for my hubby and I. My daughter and family are vegan, so when I make it for them I swap the butter for vegan margarine, the chicken broth for Veg. broth and the 1/ 2 & 1/2 for Coconut milk. It's just as good the vegan way! I like to use fresh dill, rather tan dried if I have it.

Great!  I used purple potatoes and didn't have leeks so I sautéed an onion.  I also just sautéed the mushrooms with the carrots and onion in the first step so it would save time.  I also used 1/2 c. Sour cream and 1/2 c. Half & half.  Delicious!  Will definitely make again!

This soup is hearty and comforting. I substituted onion for the leeks, but other than that, made the recipe as written. Cooking the mushrooms separately gives the soup a nice earthy flavor and great texture. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was really good and easy to make! The only thing I would change is I would to 1/2 the amount of mushrooms, but that is because I really enjoyed the rest of the soup parts too and the mushrooms were over taking a little. I used baby bellas. If I used a plain button mushroom maybe it would have a more subtle mushroom taste.  It's very good though and my husband LOVED it!

we used plain almond milk and gluten-free flour for a diary-free, gluten-free version, it was still delicious! Lots of compliments from the family and neighbors who shared it with us.

I have made this soup about 5 times now and every time it's a hit with friends. I love it as is, every time! For my own taste I sauté the mushrooms with a little red pepper to spice it up just a bit! Just an added way I put my own touch on an already fantastic soup! Vey good on a cold or late fall day! Very easy to prep and I don't make very many soups, but always get excited to make this one.

Easy recipe. I left the skins on, I hate to waste food.  I didn't add flour. Instead I pureed some of the soup to thicken, before adding the mushrooms. I also used sour cream, instead of hall and half.

Loved this soup!  Made it exactly "as is" EXCEPT I didn't have any leeks at home so I used finely chopped onion.  I think a leek would be better, but the soup was still awesome using a regular old cooking onion.  This is a keeper!

I am not sure if this is authentic Russian cuisine but this past Summer we were in St.Petersburg. I do know they had many potato and soup dishes. We paired this with dark bread and fish.The soup was so very good. I made it as written but used veggie broth for vegetarians in family.

was so delicious! I made it exactly as the recipe calls for. It was hearty, yet light. I loved the mild flavor. I was asked for the recipe. I will be making this ongoing!

SO delicious!!! This is my first time leaving a review, but since this was so easy to make and tasted so great, I had to make sure it got 5 stars! It is like a fancy potato soup with a little something extra! So good! I agree with the other reviewer who was skeptical of the dill, but it really is mild and makes it different than just plain potato soup. Thanks for the recipe.....it will go in the rotation for fall and winter!

Very good! I was searching for recipes with leeks because I got some from the co-op and had never cooked with them before. This soup was excellent! Must try! I pureed the soup after it finished cooking so that my kids would eat it! They would never have touched it seeing all the veggies in there. Tastes fantastic with a little sour cream on top too.

This soup is pretty good! I love the combination of flavor from the dill and bay leaf. That was my favorite part. I didn't have carrots or half&half, used celery and plain milk in it's place. We did find it to be a bit too salty and rich. Next time I'll probably cut the butter down to 3 T. and omit the salt. I served this soup with simple quick biscuits. Thanks for sharing!

Make this soup once a month.  We love the mushroom taste to this soup.  Used coconut milk in place of half & half.
Used cayenne pepper in place of black pepper.

My husband was very skeptical about this soup when I described it to him but after tasting it he decided it was one of the best soups he's had!  Since he is lactose intolerant, I went with the suggestion of one reviewer to blend part of the soup to thicken it (blending before the mushrooms were added).  I mixed 2 tablespoons of flour with 1/2 cup of lactose free milk (that had a splash of heavy cream in it) to further thicken the soup and add a creaminess to it.  This soup is very flavorful and so simple to make!

I looked long & hard for a non-blended soup because in several years, my 19-year-old daughter hasn't liked any I've made . I made changes to control for cholesterol and gluten and tweaked the spices. I used olive oil rather than butter (butter would be far better; next time I'll reduce olive oil to 3 tablespoons total). Instead of flour, I 1/4 c. gluten-free instant mashed potato flakes. This doesn't make the soup thick but adds body. I used 2/3 low sodium chicken broth & 1/3 regular, because that's what I had on hand; I found it needed a hair more salt,  more black pepper, a couple dashes of white pepper (because I love it), & upped the dill weed to 3 tsp. I used yellow potatoes w/the skin on. Next time, I'll use a little less potato and a little more mushroom (my daughter's suggestion after she enjoyed a large bowl) and 3 leaks. Finally, I cut up about 1/4 of the mushrooms (I used portobello) and cooked them with the mirapoix so the broth would pick up more mushroom flavor. When I make it again, I'll saute the mushrooms longer and add them all to the broth sooner. I topped with a small dollop of nonfat Greek yogurt and a sprinkle of toasted pine nuts. The soup went together easily, relatively quickly, and is tasty and quite hardy. Thanks for sharing!

Delish!!!  My family loooves this soup.  The flavor is mazing.  I have already made it 5 times.  I omit the flour, and use cream instead of half and half

I made this soup EXACTLY as the recipe states:

I've been eating a cup of this soup everyday this week for lunch and it is very good. The only difference I would make is to use heavy cream instead of half and half if you like your cream based soup a bit more on the heavy side.

Quite tasty.  The only thing I did differently was to use my immersian blender for a few pulses before I put in the mushrooms.  Having done that I think next time I'll skip the flour - it would thicken up nicely without it.

I made this exactly as written and it was very good. My family loved it and I will definitely be making it again. For me it was not bland, it was just that the flavors of the ingredients were subtle, with the mushrooms standing out with the most flavor. If you like alot of flavor, I think that adding some shredded cheese and/or bacon on top would be really good. And definitely have some hot, crusty bread with this soup for dipping!

I love dill but I didnt like this soup.  Was some what bland except for over powering taste of dill.  I did not garnish with more dill as stated in the directions, I did crumble a little bacon on top.   Maybe some sour cream would help or paprika.  On a positive note was easy to make and not expensive ingredients  Sorry I cant be more  positive on the taste.

This recipe finally prompted me to join allrecipes just to give a review of this soup.  I made it this fall exactly as specified. Amazing. I have (after making it for my family's traditional Polish Christmas Eve dinner) only made one change. I pour in the half and half into the soup, then make a flour paste with water, and slowly stir in. Seems to thicken better that way.  The picky husband loves it as well as my 3 and 6 yr old.

This was wonderful.  This will definitely become part of our regular soups.  I did use plain yogurt in place of the half and half, since I live in Brazil and they don't sell half and half here.  I also used onions instead of leaks because that was what I had on hand.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

I made this soup this weekend and my husband said it was one of the best soups he'd ever had!  He has been on several missions trips to Ukraine, and he thought it tasted just like the soup he'd eaten there.  I did take into consideration the suggestions to reduce the salt, butter, and mushrooms.  I discovered (too late) that I was out of bay leaves, so I substituted 1/4 tsp. thyme.  I also used baby portabellas and unpeeled red potatoes.  I don't believe these changes really altered the original recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

I have made this twice now, once on a chilly fall night, and once as part of a special Father's Day dinner. It was a total success both times. I was so impressed with the quality of soup this turned out! It was restaurant quality and got rave reviews from my family. Yum!

Wonderful creamy soup with chunks of potatoes.  I cut the mushroooms and leeks smaller than the potatoes so the family noticed them more and it was a good way to use the leeks from our csa without the family even knowing they were in there.

This is an excellent soup and I'm sure I'll make it again. Even though I made changes out of necessity, I rate it 5 stars b/c it's gotta be good the way it's written. Who knew mushrooms sautéed in butter would be so amazing? I didn't have any carrots, and only had 1/2 the mushrooms (portobella), used 1/2 white flour, 1/2 wheat flour. Substituted veggie stock & mushroom bullion for the chicken stock. Also added 1 huge garlic clove when I was sauteing the leeks. It ended up a bit salty so I'd omit the salt until the end next time. I used 1 t. black pepper and 2 t. celery seeds.

I only added a little garlic powder with the spices, added a splash of Madeira, and used a thinly sliced onion instead of the leeks.  It turned out one of the best potato soups I've had.  Can't wait to try with a few morels in a couple weeks

This soup was excellent! I made no changes to it, and the WHOLE family raved about it! Even kids who ate only meat loved it! This is excellent to serve on a cold cold day, make sure you double the recipe up, because it'll all be gone!

I was very pleased with this soup.  I was able to avoid the half-and-half by mashing some of the boiled potatoes to thicken the soup. This made the soup quite chowder-like and filling. I added a heaping tablespoon of sour cream to mimic the cream taste.

Just made this soup for our weekly lunches, it's very yummy- however, I do feel like it needs a meat of somesort, maybe some bacon would be really good in there or turkey shreds.  Unfortunately, I don't have either or those, so the vegetarian style it is.  :)  ~~

Excellent!  I didn’t use the dill; didn’t sound good to me, but do plan to try it in the future.  Guess I’m not too adventurous.  Anyway, I followed the recipe with only minor, typical subs:  chicken base for broth and fat-free half-and-half. The second time, to try and cut the sodium, I used less broth and more cream, also added celery with the leeks and carrots, but it didn’t taste as good; not sure if that was why.   I did alter the methods on adding the mushrooms and thickening the soup.  I sprinkled the flour over the mushrooms, stirred, and cooked for a couple of minutes.  The mixture was kinda dry and clumpy at that point, but I wanted to cook the flour and incorporate the mushroom liquid/browning bits.  Then I added the cream to the skillet, stirred and cooked.  As this thickened, I added a ladle or two of the soup.  Cooked for a couple of minutes then added the whole skilletful to the soup, stirred, and cooked (without boiling) for a few more minutes.  I also chopped the mushrooms instead of slicing them; used baby bellas.  Also did not add salt because of the sodium in the broth...but it does need some, at the end.  Just not as much as the recipe calls for.

I made this for our Progressive Dinner Group.  It was a hit for sure.  To double the recipe I used 5 lbs of cubed potatoes (10-11 cups), 4 carrots, 3 large leeks, 2 containers of sliced bella mushrooms,2-48 oz boxes of chicken broth, 2 c of 1/2-1/2 and 3/4 c. flour plus double the spices.

The only complaint my husband and I have is we would add more potatoes, and maybe add our own ingredients such as carrots. Otherwise, surprisingly yummy and refreshing to eat a very thin cream soup instead of something too thick to finish!

The best recipe I've found on this site. Wonderful. I've made it to spec, but to me, anything with dill and mushrooms just calls out for sour cream. I substitute sour cream for the half-and-half, up the dill, and cut the flour (really no need for thickening with the potatoes in there). Excellent either vegetarian, or with bacon or sausage added. Extra sour cream and leeks don't hurt it one bit.

As others have noted, if you're not going to follow the recipe, don't downgrade the rating.  If you mess it up, don't assume it's anyone else's fault!  That said, this recipe is AWESOME!  I added the sour cream as others suggested, but I think it would be equally delicious either way.  My husband declared this the best soup ever, and I might agree - and I'm not even a mushroom soup fan.  This dish is exceptionally good.

This soup rocked.  I added some mini meatballs so that my husband would consider it a main dish but made the rest as published.  The dill was fantastic.  My two year old gobbled it up and asked for seconds.

Delicious!  I made this according to the recipe and the flavor was amazing!  It had kind of a buttery flavor and the dill was perfect, not too strong.  This is going to be a regular in my kitchen.  Easy to make, too.

This stuff is amazing. I used portabella mushroom, onion instead of leeks, and vegetable broth. This soup is definitely comforting and delicious. I wouldn't change a thing about it if you don't have to due to lack of ingredients.

EXCELLENT!  Even my hubby loved it, and he is not a fan of potato soup.  The only things I changed were that I used green onion instead of leeks (to cut down on cost), and I used less butter and 1% milk to reduce the calorie count.  Will definitely make this again!!!

A lovely soup and very filling, even my husband who does not like cream or milk based soups gave me praise for this one. My three year old dipped his bread in his soup until all the broth was gone, and then would eat small spoon fulls at my request which was a small success with a picky toddler! Thank you for the recipe DTERESA.

This is the best potato soup I've ever had.  I put a slice of processed swiss cheese (creamier than the hard kind) in the bottom of the bowl, added hot soup and stirred a bit to blend in the cheese....wonderful!

This was a good soup recipe. I added the sour cream instead of half and half. I use chicken bullion and tried using less than was required to cut down on sodium. My father LOVED the soup- with cheese I enjoyed it more. Thank you for the recipe!

OH this is good! I took the advice of Gitano and used fat free sour cream in place of the half & half. I have to admit..I was worried about doing this since I don't like the taste and texture of fat free sour cream. But, I did it anyway and I'm glad I did! Saved a TON of calories and fat! this way: 148.1 Calories, Fat: 1.9 g, Cholesterol: 3.2 mg, Sodium 1,261.4 mg, Total Carbs: 23.9, Fiber: 2.8g Protein: 9.6g. I also used cooking spray to sautee the veggies & mushrooms. Soo good! Only made 1/2 the recipe since the kids don't like mushrooms...but I love them! Will certainly be making many times over!

I thought this soup was great - not too hard to make either.  I mistakenly dropped all 5 Tbls butter into the saucepan to sautee my onion (instead of leek) and carrots (frozen with the ice washed off) and didn't see how that harmed anything.  We're not as big a fan of dill, so I just used a bit less.  The Half and Half and flour mixture thickened up the soup just fine.  I'm looking forward to more of this tonight!

This is the best soup that I have ever made, my husband and I could not stop eating it. I did not alter the recipe at all.

I used low sodium broth and non-fat half-n-half, sauted the mushrooms in olive oil and this was still incredible...I can only imagine the full fat version must be out of this world.  Definately a keeper.

I Made this recipe exactly as submitted for a family gathering during the Christmas season.  After preparing the day before I put it in a crock pot for easy transportation and to reheat.  My three siblings all requested the recipe.  It is delicious.  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent basic recipe. Thanks for sharing. 


Because of health issues, we omit salt, half and half and flour in our hoousehold. I tried the soup without butter, but in the end put some garlic butter in before serving. I also added some nugget size chicken breast for protein, and dehydrated shitake mushrooms that were in our cupboard. I also substituted a plain yogurt for the creaminess, and to thicken, added a 1/2 cup orzo and a 1/4 cup leftover barley for texture/thickening; 

Next time, if I don't have any orzo, I might try using a food processor on half the mixture (before adding mushrooms).

Excellent soup!  Definitely a great way to warm up after being out in the cold.  I would make a couple recommendations however, by adding two stalks of celery sliced, or about a teaspoon of celery salt, the flavors really pop. Next time I will also cook the mushrooms along with the leeks and carrots to add a bit more of their flavor.  Even without the changes though, fantastic recipe!

Fantastic flavors and a very hearty, filling soup.  It almost seemed a little too salty, but not overwhelming - I think next time I'll just leave the salt out. Really love the sauted mushroom flavor in the soup!

Left out the carrots (not a fan), but otherwise followed recipe.  Very nice taste, without feeling overly rich.  Definitely will make again!

Too salty - and I really like salt. I would cut it to 1 teaspoon next time or just let people salt their own. I did make it exactly as written, or rather in the spirit, because I made two small adjustments: I chopped the mushrooms into chunks instead of slicing them, and I had 1/4 cup of heavy cream so I used that and rounded out the "1 cup half and half" with 3/4 cup nonfat milk. I don't think either adjustment changed the intended taste of the recipe at all, so I feel confident that I'm rating it as written. Changes I may make in the future: A bit less butter. Combined with the half and half, it feels almost too rich. And I'd probably just go with milk. Of course, I'll be cutting the salt to 1/2 to 1 t. as mentioned. But! It's a very nice potato soup; the mushrooms and dill add a great depth.

Absolutely delicious!  It's similar to my special potato soup recipe with the chicken stock and dill weed.  The only thing I substituted was green onions for the leeks.

I must start with upon looking at these ingredients I knew there was no way I would eat this soup.  However, I knew there were a number of gentlemen in my life who would likely enjoy it.  The soup tasted wonderful according to my dad and brother-in-law.  My mom and I thought it was gorgeous to boot!  They both really enjoyed the dill seasoning and thought the butter made the soup rich and creamy without being too overpowering.  I will admit due to necessity I substituted onion for the leak.

Excellent and hearty soup.  I only had 1/2 a cup of cream, but found it thick enough.  Next time I will use a huge white onion as that adds a lot of flavor.  My husband said more salt and dill.

Even though this soup is very good, I decided to give this 4 stars because it's not one that I'll make again. It is good, but it didn't stand out in any way.  While eating it, my enitre family thought of other potato soups they liked better.

A really great soup on a crisp autumn day. Hearty and flavorful, and really easy to make.  My family seemed alittle skeptical when I told them mushroom and leeks, but after trying it they changed their attitudes. Raved about how good it was and said I need to make it again...so I'll be making it again...but next time I'll use regular potatoes instead of baking potatoes as they softened up too quickly, and left a gritty texture to the soup. Still wonderful...Thanks

I bastardized this by adding corn,ham, and bacon but it was yummy and the aroma was delicious. I didn't even need the flour to thicken it.

I halved the ingredients and made the recipe as written.   The ingredients worked extremely well together and produced a soup which had a lovely flavour.  The only change I made was to use 2 tsp of flour as the soup had a nice texture and didn't require much thickening.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

looks like I am one of few who just didn't like this..overall it was just ok, but it was def. missing something. Very bland as recipe called for, and even after I added in extra seasonings it still was just boring. I had such high hopes for this...we ate it but after I doctored it up quite a bit. Thanks anyway =)

My kids said this was the best soup ever and they want it every night!  The only change was that did add a celery rib as some other reviewers suggested (because I love celery in soup).  I did notice that the flavors blended better after it sat for a few minutes after adding the cream and flour mixture.  But be careful--it can scorch if you aren't watching it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I normally tinker a little with recipes to get them just how I like them, but this one was perfect as-is.  Served it up for a Halloween party last night- mostly guys- and everyone loved it.  Most of 'em thought they wouldn't like it by the look of it and the name, but once they tried it, they were surprised, and most had seconds.  Great recipe.

Excellent!  I followed the recipe exactly but blended a few cups of the soup before adding the half & half and flour.  It is a great winter soup, although, I might try the addition of sour cream next time.

FANTASTIC soup, 'specially for those colder nights.  Very hearty and a great soup to dunk breads in.

Freezes and reheats really well too.

This is wonderful. Please try iy as is, I honestly don't think you need to play with it.  I did use onions because I never but leeks but everything else was to the tee.  I make soups at least 4 or 5 times a week and this will be one I continue to use.

I knew from the other reviews that this was going to be a good soup, but I was still amazed at how hearty and tasty this was. I didn't change a thing, and I'm glad I didn't. I can't get enough of this soup! So good!!

Mmmm, even my soup defying husband thought this one was excellent.  He didn't even say "you know this would be good with some meat it it" like he usually does when I feed him something without meat.  Super soup!  I will make again and again.

This soup is delicious! It was finished by the end of dinner, and everyone said it was wonderful. It did, however, call for too much butter. I would recommend cutting the amount in half. Also, I cooked the potatoes in a separate pot and then puréed them. It made the base creamier with a thicker and more filling consistency which I highly recommend. Will make again!

I rarely give any recipe 5 stars, but this one earned it. It was delicious and pretty easy. It didn't thicken as much as I expected, so maybe next time I will make a rioux. I was afraid that much dill would be too much but it wasn't. 

Now for the tweaks. I added a chopped red pepper because I had it and wanted to use it before it spoiled. Also, I added a couple cloves of minced garlic and a tablespoon or two of sour cream. To the sauteing mushrooms I added salt and a little Worcestershire sauce. And I cooked the whole thing in the slow cooker which is really good for soups. 

I think you could use this for any kind of mushrooms and it would come out well. I think it also makes a wonderful base soup to which you could add some chicken and more potatoes to make a more meal-like dish.

Sinful!!  This is an easy, yet delicious and rich tasting soup.  I have already passed it along to many friends.  Can easily be substituted w/ skim milk to cut the fat.  I used red bliss potatoes w/the skin on.  Yum!  Even better the next day!!  Thank you for this recipe!!

This soup was yummy! It had a very good consistency and excellent taste. I skipped the half n half and used 2% milk instead. I also used baby bella mushrooms. My 3 year old even loved it. This is definitely a keeper.

This soup was really wonderful!!! My husband and I were quite impressed with it!  It had great color, texture, and flavor.  It was also quite filling.

Sadly, I didn't have any dill weed; I used fresh basil instead.  It was very good with the basil; however, I am looking forward to trying the soup with dill weed next time.  I didn't have any half-and-half but used evaporated milk in it's place, and that substitution worked very well.  I also added a bit of paprika.

This soup was excellent.  I accidentally only bought one leek, but it was plenty as far as flavor went.  I used whipping cream, and then oops! I added 1/3 c. flour, so I dumped half out and replaced it with whole milk, so I guess I ended up with half and half anyway.  The potatoes didn't cook as much as I'd like and I at least quadrupled the cooking time - I used red potatoes, this may be why, I don't know.  This soup pureed really well for my 15 month old, and everyone liked it.  I will definitely make this again.


ETA:  I used russets this time and the potatoes still weren't done, so I'd recommend giving them a quick boil near the end - that worked out great.  Also, a side note (discovered because I have a toddler), this soup is wonderful pureed. 

Also, it freezes VERY well.

This soup was very, very good.  Some suggested adding cream cheese but it is yummy even without it.  I omited the dill weed and next time might add some cooked chicken to it.

I have been eyeing this one for a while...I didn't have leeks so used sauteed onion instead and also threw in some celery.  I just mashed some of the potatoes instead of thickening with flour (my potatoes were done in less than 20 mins) and added some fresh garlic to the mushrooms as they were sauteing. Served with a salad and slice of french bread for a nice quick lunch...thanks.

My husband made this several weeks ago and it was absolutely wonderful.  The only thing that he did differently was to use Gold potatoes instead of Russett, which made it thicker.  He also added approx. 1/2 cup of Kraft Tomato and Basil cheese, which is optional.  Great recipe!

What a great soup!  I used portabella mushrooms for flavor and red potatoes with their skins on.  I omitted the flour... it was delicious with a broth-base.  I also just used a splash of half and half which saves on calories/fat.  It is a keeper for sure.

I loved this soup.  I took some other reviewers' advice and pureed half of the soup for thickening instead of using flour.  I also added milk instead of half and half.  Delicious!

Delicious!  I omitted the half and half and flour, and instead pureed about half the soup to thicken it up.  Then I added a spoonful of sour cream.

My husband and I just got back from Russia, so we've been craving food from the region.  This soup hit the spot!  I followed the recipe as written and it was perfect on a snowy/rainy day back here in the USA.  This will be a favorite in our house for years to come.

Great Soup!  After reading the other reviews, I made the following modifications: Sauted the potatoes with the carrots and leeks for about 5 - 10 minutes before adding the broth, mashed about 1 cup of the potatoes before adding the mushrooms, and  used a mixture of Brown and Portabello mushrooms.  This is a hearty soup that is even better the next day!

WOW!  This was much better than I expected.  Will definitely make again.  I only had 4c. broth so I added 1c. water, and it turned out fine: nice and thick and chunky.  I was hesitant about the cream/flour mixture but it was delicious.  I also used 3 chopped green onions instead of leeks because I couldn't find them, and increased the pepper to 1tsp. for my husband, who likes food a little spicy.  He LOVED it!    We both like mushrooms, so we used interesting varieties: 1 pckg "baby bellas" and 1 pckg "Maitake" - awesome!

This was was a terrific soup.  My husband doesn't like mushrooms so I chopped them fine instead of slicing and even he thought it was great.  Didn't change anything else in the recipe.

This was so so good!  We absolutely loved it and my husband isn't even a huge soup fan.  The only change I think I will make next time is to cut the salt down to 1 1/2 tsp.  Thanks for the recipe!  We will definitely make this again.

Excellent soup recipe - my only comment would be that I don't think it would ever serve 12 in our household - more like 4.
Thank you for posting.

I used onions instead of leeks, beef broth instead of chicken, omitted the dill and instead used parsley and oregano...used as little butter as possible also.  Also used fat free greek yogurt instead of cream, and pureed half the soup to thicken...turned out awesome

Made this for a small group of friends for Imbolc. I halved it because there were only 6 of us. That's a mistake I won't make again! LOL Everyone loved it, including the two guest who usually aren't too keen on mushrooms and the 11 month old who's semi picky. Will definitely make again, but the whole recipe this time. Also, I didn't have fresh dill, but added a bit extra of the dried and that seemed to work just fine. I will absolutely make again for company. Might make a batch this weekend to freeze and see how it does.

Pretty much an instant addition to my favorites from the moment I tried it. Really easy to make, and super hearty and flavorful- definitely makes the cold winter day a little bit more bearable! Potatoes and carrots cooked to the perfect consistency. Get a slice of crusty bread to dip straight into the soup and you're all good to go!

This was absolutely fantastic. I halved the recipe since were 3 of us eating it for dinner but did not change the ingredients except adding a little more butter to saute the mushrooms since half the butter wasn't enough. The major change I made was to use an immersion blender at the very end after almost finishing the thickening so I could make a "creamed" soup. I used the blender until it was a medium-fine puree with little bits of the ingredients vs completely pureed. Then put it back on the burner on med-low until it completely thickened. It was AMAZING. My somewhat picky daugher loved it and my husband had 2 1/2 bowls of it. Will absolutely repeat it - one of the rare recipes where no tweaks are needed, even the salt levels which are normally horribly high to me.

A very satisfying, hearty soup and relatively healthy.  Whole milk works as well as half & half. I recommend a one- inch dice for the potatoes or reduce the cooking time for the potatoes.

I love it when people rate a recipe and make minor changes to it! It’s one of my favourite things about this site.
I didn’t have have enough half & half, so I added a dollop if sour cream to serve. Delish!

This is delicious - the photo is my second helping!!  My husband loved it too.  I used a regular onion, my immersion blender but left chunks, and added Colby jack cheese as garnish.  My husband always adds pepper.

Used onions instead of leeks. Added 4 strips of thick bacon, cooked and crumbled, at the end.

Fabulous recipe, thank you for sharing—forgot leeks and substituted an onion. Perfect consistency. The dill is critical to the flavor. Nice work!

Delicious!  I didn't have any dill so added 1 tsp dried rosemary and 1 tsp basil instead(as those are supposed to be good substitutes).  Next time, I might reduce the salt by 1/2 tsp, as I felt it was maybe just a tad too salty....but it didn't keep us from enjoying :)

I followed the recipe exactly and loved it. It was just right for our snowy day. Delicious!  Was concerned with the amount of dill but was brave and put it in.  It didnt overpower the soup at all. Taste is great.

I really love the flavor of this soup. I was nervous about all the dill, but it’s just right and not overpowering in any way.  I used Better than Bullion for broth and salt free butter. I made the rest as instructed. The only change I’d make next time is to sauté the mushrooms a bit longer or maybe try a different variety; mine seemed a little gummy yet. But that’s the chef not the recipe! I’ll definitely be making this again!!

This was amazing, and really easy to make, even for someone like me who doesn't do a whole lot of cooking due to back and knee pain. Just chopped up all the ingredients beforehand, took a small break and then started actually cooking. I made it a bit salty because I accidentally used too much chicken buillon but it still turned out wonderfully! I'll definitely make this again.

Delicious recipe. I did add garlic and almost tripled the dill since we love dill. I used mushroom broth and it all was tasty. Will make again with these modifications.

I was looking for something to make with the limited ingredients I had on hand after coming home from a week out of town. Found this recipe and it was a perfect comforting welcome home soup for the family. The only thing I didn’t have were leeks so sautéed onions instead. I’m sure leeks would make it even that much better. This soup will definitely become part of our family!

Made as directed except for a couple of small changes. Used less salt because I added a little salt to the onions as I was sautéing them to sweat them. I didn’t have any cream or half-and-half so used regular milk and a dollop of sour cream. It was delicious as is and this is my second time making it. This time I added some pork roast that needed to be used. I chopped into small cubes and sautéed first and then re-added towards the end. The soup and pork flavors really complimented each other and it was just as delicious the next day for lunch.

My mother and I made this together on a cold, rainy, icy, and snowy March day.  We liked the recipe as is, but what really put it over the top is a teaspoon of dried tarragon and a teaspoon of mexican oregano.  Then, it was perfect.  Served with toasted rye bread on the side.

This is an extremely good soup.  I sautéed my mushrooms first, then set to the side and then the leeks.  I didn’t want to lose the flavor by sautéing them in a separate pan.  Also later when it’s time to add the mushrooms back in, I let it cook for a bit to let the flavors come together. This also helped the potatoes break brown

Wow. An amazing soup! And when I hesitated to put in two teaspoons of salt I checked the reviews for tweaks and found three separate reviews all saying not to tweak anything!! I never hear that about a recipe! So that alone made me pretty confident this recipe would be a keeper.

A good recipe, but the amount of cream makes this much sweeter than I wanted it to be. I'll have to add more chicken stock and spices to cut back the sweetness.

Excellent Soup.  I served it with homemade french bread.  We had guests from out of town and they raved.  I only used about half the half & half and flour. I did not decrease the butter at all, and I added some garlic powder and onion powder to taste while potatoes cooked.  Just enough to compliment the dill not over power.  Thank you for this recipe, this is definitely a permanent winter addition in our house.

I loved the flavor and simple ingredients. I'm giving it 4 stars only because 5 tablespoons of butter made the soup a little greasy for my taste. Otherwise, it would be 5 stars. I didn't have leeks so used yellow onion. Some of the comments said the soup was salty. I used low sodium or unsalted broth.

Really tasty soup. I halved the recipe (except the butter), decided to use lactose free whole milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2 and fresh dill for the whole thing and it still came out great. I used a low sodium chicken broth so I could control the salt intake. It’s probable that I’m going to make this for the rest of my life.

Great, hardy meal soup!!  I did make a couple of changes since I made this for my sick brother and he's not supposed to have dairy.  I took out about a quarter of the soup with a little broth and put it in a blender and then put it back to thicken the soup(instead of using heavy cream and flour).  I also added some garlic powder and complete seasoning to the veggies because I must add those to everything I cook.  The soup is delicious.  I will add bacon and a little cheese and sour cream because I can!!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I thought it was a very easy recipe -- nice consistency and tasty... although I was minus the leeks and pepper, I added broccoli . Will make again.

This is now one of our favorite soups. Yum! Thanks for sharing!
Question: Does anyone know if this soup can be frozen and used at a later date? I was going to make a big batch for the holidays and freeze it, but a little concerned about the mushrooms being okay. Anyone tried it? If so, how did it turn out?
Thanks.

I followed the directions to the letter, with the exception of using kale vs spinach.   It was delicious and got double  thumbs up from my family.  Easy recipe and I will make it again...and again.

5 stars!!! Only sub was diced onion for leek and I added a bit of garlic. I was nervous about the amount of dill, but it was spot on. The half and half / broth mix was perfect. I will be making this again and often. Thank you!

Delicious! I brought it to a Halloween party, where is was quickly devoured. Multiple people asked for the recipe. My only deviation from the recipe was to use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth for dietary reasons. I’ll make this again and again!

I used vegetable broth instead of chicken. Tasted great, husband and kids gobbled it up. I would probably decrease salt from 2 tsp to 1-1.5 tsp next time.

One of the best soups I’ve ever made. I had a lot of mushrooms on hand and was looking for a recipe to use them up and found this. I didn’t have any leeks in hand so I used a large sweet onion instead. Otherwise I stuck  to the recipe ingredients. Before adding the half and half I took out about 2/3 of the solid soup ingredients and used a stick blender, then added the ingredients back in with the flour and half and half. The dill was not overpowering at all. Wonderful recipe!

Very good basic recipe. I did not add the  flour and half and half, just stirred in a bit of whole milk Greek yogurt into individual bowls. Also, as others suggested, I used an immersion blender which thickened up the soup very nicely. Been eating it all week - use a little chicken broth to thin it out when reheating.

Excellent exactly as it is! Very, very good.
That said, to make it have a more mushroom-y flavor, I'm going to add some powdered dried Porcini mushrooms to it next time.

Soup was amazing. I will definitely make this again. The wife still raves about how good it was two weeks later. My only change was, I added 4 strips of bacon to the mix. This one is now in my recipe book.

We make this at least twice a month now! Super cheap and easy. I use the baby bella mushrooms. Only thing I sub is using sour cream instead of cream because It's just what I have on hand. I add the flour to the mushroom mixture rather than after so it blends better. 

Perfect winter dinner

We discovered the recipe a decade ago on Allrecipes.com, and have made it many times since. Always a crowd pleaser, and one of our go-to favorites. PERFECT for that cold snap or for when you need a big pot for lots of guests.

This soup was amazing! I wasn't sure if I would like it - the idea of mushroom soup instantly made me think about the gross cream of mushroom soup that comes in a can. This is NOTHING like that. Don't be afraid of the dill. I added extra. Sooooo delicious. This will be on the menu frequently, especially in the winter, it is a definite go for comfort food.

I'm in love with this soup.  Forgot to get leeks at the store, so I added an onion. Will try it with the leeks next time (oh, and trust me there will be a next time!).  Hearty, filling.... perfect for a January night.  Had plenty leftover for a couple of lunches.  This one is going into the regular rotation for sure. Thanks for sharing!

Talk about a stick to your ribs kinda meal! My husband has been asking me to make potato soup for a long time but I always found the recipes to be so bland. Not this recipe! He really enjoyed it, and it was perfect on a cold evening. I only made one tweak and used sour cream, and sprinkled a little shredded cheddar on top. Served up with some warm croissants, this was fantastic.

I really,really  enjoyed this soup! I did not use the half and half. I put about 2 bowls n the blender, that thickened it up enough for me. I also cooked some bacon to put on top, I then sauteed the m'rooms in a little bacon grease and butter. Served with a dollop of sour cream and a little sharp cheddar. Great recipe!!!

This is a great soup recipe, did not have leeks on hand so used onion, also did not have enough half and half so used a bit of it, then some sour cream and milk. It is a super soup :) for cool days and veggies can be substituted whatever you have on hand-even though the mushrooms are pretty much a must :) as they add a very nice flavour. Definately a keeper! Thanks for sharing.

I made no changes to the recipe and we loved it!  The hubs is already asking for it for our Thanksgiving dinner.  Next time I think I might add a touch more pepper and then puree some of the soup to add just a touch more heft to the texture.

I didn't have leeks on hand so I used onions. Didn't peel the potatoes, and used whipping cream instead of half and half.  I used my immersion blender to purée the soup down a bit before adding the cream. Delicious and decadent!

Excellent recipe - my mother loved it!  Since she is on a low sodium diet, I did make the following changes:  used unsalted chicken broth, "No Salt" brand sodium free salt and substituted 1 T melted unsalted butter plus enough milk to equal 1 c instead of using half & half.  I will definitely make it for her again.  Thanks for sharing.

This soup is delicious! I followed the  recipe without altering anything. I made it for  small dinner party, and everyone was impressed. The dill gives it a distinct flavor. Easy and quick prep time. Will definitely make again soon!

I made this recipe as is. All I can say is that it is FABULOUS! I use low-sodium broth to adjust salt content to my taste. I agree that this soup as is might be seen at high end restaurants. Everything in it is how it is supposed to be. European style of soup is not broth style of soup nor stew that is the norm in the US. This soup is fast and tasty perfect for the fall. I would recommend to boil it and immediately switch to simmer after each step, but especially after adding the flour and half & half mixture. The simmering will help with that thick but not blob type of consistency. This technique also helps to achieve the firm yet tender texture of all the veggies in the soup. I reduced the recipe to 4 servings. My  husband ate his portion plus ALL the leftover soup!   Thanks for the recipe!

I give it five stars because even though I changed a few things, I followed her lead and it was better than if I had tried it on my own (and i like my own soup!).  I did it without the milk and flour at the end because that's the mood we were in and didn't put in all the dill, maybe more than half. You could taste plenty of dill even so.  And since I made it from my own broth I also threw in the chicken and it made a hearty, delicious meal that warmed our bellies.  Will make it again!

Was looking for a way to incorporate more mushrooms into my diet.  This fit the bill and I will definitely make again.

WOW, this soup was amazing!  To keep some calories down, I sauteed the leeks in olive oil.  I also used fat free sour cream mixed with a little chicken broth as the thickener.  Don't leave out the dill. It adds so much flavor.  I ate it the next day for breakfast too!  Thank you so much for sharing!

I have made this twice so far and it was great both times. I used sour cream rather then half and half as suggested in other reviews. I also used onion rather then leaks because I love onions.

I always make this vegan by subbing coconut oil for butter, veg broth for chicken broth, and a cup of canned full fat coconut milk for the half & half.  I always sub chopped onions (about a cup) for the leeks.  The last time I made this with crimini mushrooms and my husband (a meat & potatoes man) said - keep this recipe!  Very good.

Beautiful soup! Tasted before I added the Half and Half mixture, and used immersion blender to see how creamy I could make it.  Was perfectly creamy with Red Potatoes, but went ahead and added half of the cream mixture just to see. Loved it both way! Thank you for sharing!!!

I was looking for a mushroom soup that wasn't made with cream, and found this one.  I'm not keen on dill, but the soup was tasty anyway, but the family and I both agree that I should use 1 tsp dill next time, instead of 2.  Because if my own personal taste buds, I cannot give it 5 stars because of the dill.  I used a salted soup base instead of chicken broth,  so didn't add salt.  My fat of choice when cooking is olive oil, so I used olive oil instead of butter.  Had no leeks, so used onions.  Had no half and half, so used milk, and the soup was just thick enough to have nice body.  So, soup base instead of broth, no salt, olive oil instead of butter, onions instead of leeks, milk instead of half and half.  This soup goes on the "make it again" list.

Absolutely loved this soup. A dollop of sour cream when served enhanced the flavor even more. I used chicken STOCK plus 2 cups of water for the broth. I had to substitute a scallion and a cooking onion for the leeks as I had none,. Will definitely be making this again!

When I found this recipe it reminded me of my Ukrainian Baba so I was excited to give it a try.  I was pleasantly surprised that it taste just like her recipe. 

Like Baba, I used fresh dill (4 tsp). I did also use fat free half and half which  makes it a little thin for my taste so I cut the potatoes and little bigger so I could mash them a few times to thicken the soup. I do this before adding the mushrooms.  

Speaking of mushrooms,  I seasoned them with salt and pepper when I pan fried them. I  now have a new favorite soup.

Loved this! As some others did, I blended up part of the soup (I just stuck in my stick blender) to thicken it up a little before adding the mushrooms. I also added some sour cream after it was done (not replacing half-and-half, but in addition to), maybe 1/3 cup and stirred it in. I used two packages of mushrooms and found that to be just perfect.

We had our first freezing temps of winter and I needed a comfort food fast! Because I used chicken stock  instead of milk, I omitted the salt as another reviewer suggested and it didn't need it. If you find that it's too salty for you taste, you can add some water or milk to dilute, but will have to adjust the other seasonings. I did however add a can of evaporated milk towards the end of cooking time as another reviewer suggested.   I also puréed some of the vegetables and potatoes to thicken the soup instead of using the flour and butter roux.  This is one of those great, basic soup recipes that you can add whatever veggies that you have on hand to. I added some coarsely  chopped broccoli florets. 
Thanks to all of you who  review with your great suggestions! A dollop of soup cream into my bowl added a layer of richness! Though I made it on the stovetop, I transferred it to my crockpot and kept it on low so we had it for lunch and supper! Yum!

I used celery and onion in place of leek (had these ingredients on hand) and sour cream in place of half-and-half for the same reason. I used fresh dill instead of dried (never use dried dill). The soup came out pretty mediocre in my opinion, and I'm a soup lover. I gave it four instead of 3 stars because I really like soup, even if it's mediocre.

This soup has a great base!  I wanted it to have more of a zing, so I added sour cream, some sharp cheddar cheese, and grated parmesan cheese, and garlic salt.  Will definitely make again!

This is delightful! Unfortunately, I didn't make it at all like the recipe called because it was slow cooker day for me so I literally threw everything in the crock pot and cooked it all day and it came out great. I froze the half we didn't eat and it warmed up beautifully and the flavor was even better. Will definitely make again.

Delicious and easy!  This is a keeper.  I substituted sour cream for the half-and-half.  (There's no going to the store - game 7 of the World Series is about to start).  I think I'll try Greek  yogurt next time.  The baseball fans in the house took their attention off the game long enough to ask for seconds - a big hit!

This soup was absolutely incredible!  I normally have to mess with the spices in order to get any sort of flavor in soups like these, but I this time I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out delicious; it was well-seasoned and creamy.  I would most definitely make this again!

Excellent. Made it mostly according to recipe except I eyeballed all the quantities and used onions instead of leaks which I didn't have. Served it to 4 Russian guests who didn't recognize the recipe as Russian but loved it nonetheless. My toddler also ate it, so definitely making this again. Probably next week :)

This is a very easy recipe.  I made it as directed except I mashed up the potatoes a little after the 20 minutes cooking.  It makes a good creamy soup.  I felt it was a little bland, potatoes can be that way, so I added bacon bits and cheddar cheese to the bowls and had sour cream available.  I will definitely make again!  Oh yeah, I had no dill, that may have made all the difference in the final taste, will be sure I have some next time.

This is my new favorite soup!!  I love mushroom soup and I love potato soup so this was the perfect combination.  The flavor is amazing with the dill weed and the bay leaf.  Everyone in my household loved it.  The only change I made was I used onions instead of leeks just because that's what I had on hand.  Will definitely make again!!

Simply wonderful. We LOVE this. I make it every few weeks through the fall and winter. I do follow the directions and have found it to be even tastier by doubling the cream and use fresh dill in the entire recipe. My husband asks me to make this again and again.

Delicious. I will definitely make this again. Im single, so I reduced the recipe by half. I had two servings, gave my dog a ladle full (she loved it too), and stored another couple servings in the fridge. Im sure it won't last long there. The only thing I would add is the smokey flavor of bacon. Not too much, only a single slice. Still, the recipe, as it stands, is excellent.

Wow this soup is delicious! I was a little nervous about the use of the dill but the flavor is amazing and the overall result is a rich hearty soup. I didn't have any leeks on hand, so substituted with half an onion thinly sliced. Mmmmm mmm mmm. My recommendations, add one more carrot, and cut those mushrooms into nice thick slices. It creates a delicious bite and a rustic feel to a wonderful soup. Seriously good.

Followed this without changes. Could probably avoid 2 tbsp of butter by using Pam on a good nonstick pan to fry the mushrooms. I did it with the butter this time.

One extra instruction: let this soup stand for 10-15 minutes so that it can thicken up. I ate it immediately and was disappointed with the first few bites, but the soup got better and better as it cooled a bit and thickened. Enjoy.

Fantastic flavor - the butter-sauteed mushrooms make for a nice texture and flavor contrast with the rest of the soup.  I forgot to buy half and half so I used 1 cup of sour cream instead of half and half and it turned out just fine.  Will definitely be making this one again!

Really enjoyed, quite hearty and filling. Made the mistake of cutting the potatoes a little too big, so I burnt my mouth - but that was my fault. Either way, delicious and would be great for rainy days, cold weather, and the like!

Very good! I'd never used  leeks before and they are delicious, well worth the bit of extra work to clean them. I used the method whereby you chop the leeks and put them in a bowl of water, swish them around and then scoop them out with a slotted spoon after a few minutes. Taking the advice of others, I didn't use any flour. Used whole milk instead of half and half and it turned out creamy enough for my taste.

I changed up this recipe quite a bit, just because of my ow n preferences and what I had to cook with.
I left out the dill, the bay leaf, and the leeks.
I added celery, onions, and parsley flakes.
Changed the chicken broth to beef base (I like base better and I think beef goes better with mushrooms)
Changed the potatoes to fingerling potatoes, cube in 4's, and left the skin on.
So, with all the changes, not sure i can say it was this recipe but it was delicious.
I will make it again, for sure.

Love this recipe except too much salt.  Need to use only 1 tsp. and another cup of broth if 1/4 cup of flour is used per the recipe.  Even salty, it was a real hit in our house.

Oh my goodness, this was very tasty. I had halved the recipe and made it pretty much as written.  I did not have half and half, so googled a substitute and found 1 tbl butter and 1 cup milk And there you have half and half especially with whole milk.  I added an extra tbl of flour, tempered it before adding to the pot of hot soup.  This is a lightly savory soup with the dill.  I presented it with a dollop of sour cream for a little tang and then sprinkled with more dill.  Would make a very nice and different first source for company dinner.

We loved this soup: texture, flavors, appearance--all great. I used tiny potatoes and didn't peel them--delicious.
And here's a PS: made it again without the half and half and flour mixture and like it even more!

I loved this!  Very healthy even for my meat lover husband.  Good with a baguette.   I used some sweet potato mixed with reg. potato.  the full serving recipe was huge for 2 people, which I will be freezing some.  I didn't use fresh dill, I didn't have any but it was still so tasty!

This was a huge hit with my family today, a day that we all needed some major soul nourishing! The flavors and amounts listed were absolutely perfect- I didn't need to add a single thing. The only thing I did differently was to use heavy cream rather than half and half as that's what I had on hand, and I would definitely use heavy cream again next time as well as the soup was the perfect consistency! Delicious.

I found this recipe last winter and have made it probably a dozen times since then. It's a wonderful fall/winter soup that's hearty but still healthy enough. We made it last Christmas Eve for a large group and got rave reviews. I always make it exactly to the recipe! It's perfect as is.

Very delicious soup!!! My family loved it very much. I didn't follow the recipe strictly but anyway it came out very delicious.
I'm making it for the third time already. First one I made with half and half as in the recipe, but 2nd and 3rd I made with sour cream instead and it was even more delicious. Thank you for the recipe.

This is the best potato soup I've tried. It reminds me of zuppa tuscana except much more healthy. I did sub in corn starch for flour. next time I might add some kale because I'm a health nut.

Perfect for those chilly fall days at home.  Only thing I added was a 1/2 chopped onion with the leek and about 3 strips of crumbled bacon.  Wow, what a great tasting soup!

This was one of the best soups I ever made.  Followed the directions, except I added the potatoes when I sautéed  the veggies.  Then I used my immersible  blender to puree, adding the cream and mushrooms at the end. It is so good.

Delicious! I followed exactly except for using veggie broth and adding just a little cheddar to the bowl. I too was nervous about the dill, but the final product was so good that it must be doing something right. I like salty food, and it was perfect, but may be a little too salty for others. Made mine with unpeeled redskin potatoes and used a stock pot. Can't wait to eat it tomorrow too.

This is a great recipe. The only difference is I add much more veggies go it (only a personal preference). I also add one cup of beef broth. But this is a great dish and my whole family loves it. Thank you!!

This soup is very good. Even my elderly father liked it, and he's not a big fan of mushrooms. I just cut them up a little smaller since he was eating it, too. Like others, I used onions because I didn't have any leeks. My sons and I like things a bit spicier, so we just added hot sauce to our individual bowls. This would probably be good with some chili powder, crushed pepper flakes, or even some minced jalapeno.

This was a really good, very simple soup! I didn't make any changes. Next time, I might prefer to use more Potato and less Mushroom.

Leeks aren't available where I live so I used onions as others did.  This soup is delicious!  I tasted it when it was done and thought my 2 yr old would like it better if some of the veggies were hidden so I blemded  almost 1/2 of it and I actually thought the flavor was better (mabe blending distributed the flavor better per bite?!). If this soup gets even better a day or two in the fridge then my tastebuds will be shocked!  It's fsbulous the first day!

Used floor an butter instead of the half n half.. still turned out great.. while making the soup i didn't cook the carrots long enough before adding the broth, after that had to clean the mushrooms the right way. Which took longer then twenty minutes to do! After prepared i just placed the mushrooms into the brine before sauteing, had to saute them so i separated them quickly!Oh beginners trials lol. Although i ran into a few speed bumps this soup is so good!

Very good!  Didn't have a bay leaf so didn't use that.  Used half regular shrooms half portobello.  Would have personally liked more half and half in it to make it creamier.  Would make again.

This soup was so good!! We all loved it! It was easy to make and very tasty. We are vegetarians so we used vegetable broth instead of chicken. We used different size potatoes which was kinda nice to add different texture to the soup. We are defiantly going to make this soup again!

Only mods: Used three onions in place of leeks, Better Than Bouillon vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, whole milk in place of half-and-half (half + half = whole, so I figure that works! *grin*), and didn't peel potatoes.

I thought this was quite good and rich-tasting.  DBF said there was a taste in it that he didn't like, but he wasn't able to identify it.  I would have liked it to taste a little more dilly, but maybe my tiny jar of dill is just too old.  It will certainly get used up quickly enough if I keep making this recipe!

This soup will not keep you full for long, so consider adding or serving with some sort of protein (chicken on side or in chunks in soup, seitan (for vegetarians), hard-boiled eggs, beans...).

I made this soup for family and it was a great hit!  I followed as directed with the exception of adding a bit of minced garlic and also sauteed the potatoes with the carrot, and onion (I actually used scallion because that was on hand)..I also at last minute added a bit of kale.. it was "oh my goodness-GOOD"!!  Will definitely make again and again. Thank you for sharing this recipe. It was a very refreshing break from the traditional potato soup recipes.

i added more spices because it tasted a little bit bland and i added a couple cloves of garlic. i enjoyed it but my family has not tried the soup yet. their opinion will be the final verdict. word of advice do not listen to one reviewer that said to use less flower by half. the soup will not thicken.

I seen this recipe and I had all these ingredients on hand, so there was my sign. It was fast and the directions were very easy to follow. I loved the mushrooms in the creamy soup! We are empty nesters so we go end up having a lot of soups salads and sandwiches, so were always looking for a new recipe for soups. I can make them up and freeze them in single serve containers. This is one I will make again to keep on hand. Absolutely fantastic!

I have tried many of the potato soup recipes and this one is different than the other ones I've tried. I like the addition of the mushrooms and the dill. We will be adding this to the list of foods we try again.

This was a wonderful recipe full of delicious flavor. First time I've used leeks and they were great. We made this for an Olympic's party and my husband requested it forever more be added to our more frequent recipes. Because of milk allergies, I substituted the half and half for 1 part coconut milk cream, and one part almond milk. Delicious!

My family enjoyed this soup. The only complaint I have is that it is more "brothy" than We like. Next time I will either reduce the chicken broth to 4 cups and adjust the spices accordingly or increase the quantity of vegetables.

Made this today, Sundays are soup days, yummy! I will definitely make again, but will use half water and half stock, can't believe I am saying it was a little too salty. Will probably use only half the salt, you can always add.  Like the substitute of sour cream for the half and half.  Usually have that in the refrigerator, versus the milk.  I also added fresh chopped garlic -- this really is a good soup, just like my grandma use to make, hearty and yummy!

This was a super tasty soup and paired well with Italian Bread from Allrecipes.  I had to make a couple of substitutions (red onions instead of leeks, skim milk instead of cream and light butter) based on what I had on hand. We like soup with more broth so I added a cup more of chicken stock.  We will have this earthy soup again.

I will definitely make this again! I cut the recipe in half since it was for me and my boyfriend. I made the mistake of cutting the liquid in half too, which means it wasn't really a soup. Still delicious though!

This recipe is very good. It is very thick, perfect winter soup. I recommend to use home-made chicken broth, if available. I also added a dash of dry sherry, which goes so well with any mushrooms.  We'll make it again. :)

I made this with vegetable broth and since I didn't have dill I used tarragon instead.  I obviously ended with a much different flavor than the recipe intended but it was very good.

Know up front that I had to tweak this recipe, but still giving it 5 stars because the base of it is outstanding.  I did not have leeks and used a whole chopped onion instead.  I also used chicken bullion granules for chicken broth, and sour cream in lieu of half and half.  I left some of the skins on the potatoes because that is how my husband and I prefer it.  Crazy good soup!  I was concerned about the dill, but it was just what this soups needs for a little kick.  Soooo good, will be doubling recipe next time.

I made this recipe a week ago - we all loved it. I was out of butter, so used olive oil instead. Also, I had Plevrotus mushrooms (otherwise known as oyster mushrooms I believe) which I chopped in the food processor. Next time I would chop them a little finer, as larger pieces did not cook through - they actually reminded me of oysters, which was not the texture I was expecting in the soup. I cooked this early in the day, and left to rest for a couple of hours which allowed the flavors to blend. I served sauteed sausages on the side - added the leftovers to the soup leftovers. We enjoyed it for 3 days.

The leeks are lovely in this soup. I would not substitute onions or scallions as some did. I topped with some shredded cheese as one reviewer mentioned, but it's not really necessary. This is easy to make and good. Thanks for posting it.

My family loved this soup! I am vegetarian so I used Not-Chicken CHicken stock. I added some celery and doubled the carrots. To thicken it I used about a teaspoon of corn starch and a tablespoon of flour, mixed with the half and half. This was for HALF the recipe. I wish I'd made it all! My husband is a devout carnivore and added bacon to his, but tried mine and said it was great even without!
I will definitely be making this each fall/winter!

Absolutely perfect. The tastes were just right. I have tried cuisine from Russia before and this was right along their lines. Not too heavy on spices and creamy. This is a favorite in my home now. Great job.

Amazing! I followed the recipe w/o altering. Used both regular white mushrooms as well as 3 large portabello shrooms. Rich, smooth taste. I served with the option of shredded sharp cheddar cheese on top...I liked the slight tang the cheese added. Hard to explain why, but the addition was nice.

I had potatoes and mushrooms that had to be used up and this was obviously the right choice.  I overloaded it with veggies so that it came close to being more like a stew, but either way, hubby and I loved it.  I didn't change any ingredients and this was a great comfort food!

Eh, it was ok.  I used baby portabella mushrooms - maybe that made it taste a little funky?  The color was off too.  I am not sure I would make this again.

Everyone loved this one including our master chef mom and very picky dad. My sister and I stuck to the recipe except for a few little tweaks and it still came out great. We used fresh dill and half the amount of half and half and butter called for in the recipe. We let it simmer a little longer and didn't even have to add flour since it was already thick. It's a great dish for a cold rainy day!

I love this soup. Is rich in flavor and easy to make. The only reason I give 4 stars is because is too salty. There is no need to add salt as the recipe suggests. Otherwise, this soup can have 100 stars!

I made this just as written and it was amazing. I'd advise using leeks rather than onions if possible as the difference in flavor really lends itself to the soup. My only complaint is that I havn't found a way to keep it as it does not freeze well and there are only two of us. Oh well, it isn't hard to prepare and fresh is always better!

Wow.  Normally we end up altering a recipe, but not this one.  It is wonderful. I had my doubts about the dried dill, but it was perfect. The broth is the best; I could just drink it and be happy without all the other goodies, but that is what makes it so good.  

Thank you DTERESA for sharing this recipe.

Everyone enjoyed the soup. Due to a dairy allergy in the family, I had to swap out the half and half and used rice milk that we had on hand (and swapped out butter with our nondairy butter). I imagine I would like the soup just as well (if not more due to the richness of a cream) if we were able to use the half and half. Very easy to make and this has already been requested to make again.

This is a really tasty soup, just feels like to me that it needs a little bit of meat in it.  Like a crumbled bacon that has been sitting in the fridge from yesterday or some shredded corned beef...

As a vegetarian, I did swap out the chicken broth with vegetable broth, but the rest remained the same and it was delicious.  Definitely adding this to my repertoire.

This was so good and it was easy to do.  I did make two changes, which I don't usually like to do when I review a recipe.  One was I thickened the soup with potato flakes since I have to be GF and the other was I didn't have any half-n-half so I used 3/4 cup of heavy cream, which I added after turning off the heat. 
That said I don't think either was enough to change the flavor of the soup which was wonderful!  The light dill flavor was very good.  Both my sons loved it! The oldest stating that "you can make this again Mom!" He's not usually enthusiastic about potato soup.

This is my new favorite comfort food!!  I did substitute scallions for the leeks, only because they were available, but either way this is a most delicious, filling, smile-generating soup!  It will be on my company list for mushroom lovers, for sure!

Perfect for this fall day in Wisconsin!!  I only added one leek instead of two and I just washed Yukon potatoes and added with the skin on.  Topped with some bacon bites, shredded cheese and/or sour cream.  Will definitely be in my favorite soup category!!!

I made this soup tonight and it is my new favorite.  To keep it healthier, I substituted olive oil for the butter and 1% milk for the half-and-half and it was still amazing.  My 5 year old daughter gave it her seal of approval as well, so I will definately be making this again.  Thank you for the great recipe!

I did substitute veg broth instead of chicken (to make vegetarian) and whole milk instead of half-and-half (because it's what I had) but don't think these subs changed the integrity of the recipe so I'm rating it still.  It was very good, and I will def make this regularly! I didn't find it too bland at all, not too salty (type/brand of broth used makes big difference), and the dill was a nice change of pace from the spices I typically use in soups.  While blending some of the soup would thicken it, I enjoyed the texture of the thick and chunky broth by using milk/flour to thicken; it makes it more of a hearty main meal than a first course. Worth the calories.  The only change I will probably do going forward is an onion instead of leeks, only because it's what I normally have on hand.  I'm not a huge fan of potato soups so thank you for giving me a version that I devour!

This recipe comes very close to the soup that I had in Yoshkar-Ola, Russia. Of course, they use all natural ingredients ie: Forest-picked mushrooms real cream and home grown leeks that are sometimes difficult to find in the US. This is a super healthy cold-winter soup that will charm your soul. My Russian wife gives this a thumbs up buts suggests to fry the mushrooms first in sunflower oil and add them in the end to finish the soup. It's no wonder that they live to 90+ years!

Made it according to recipe but felt it lacked a depth of flavor -- not sure what was missing, but added a bit of cooking sherry and two cloves of crushed garlic while it simmered and then served it with shredded cheddar on top -- the sherry, garlic and cheese seemed to help develop the flavors more fully.

This was very easy and tastes as though it's much more complicated! I didn't have half-and-half on hand, only low-fat milk and it still came out delicious.  Just a side note, I used red potatoes because they hold up better than russets.

This soup is hearty and delicious! Perfect for a cool rainy New England fall day.  I did substitute a sweet onion for the leeks and used thyme since I'm not a big fan of dill.  Will definitely be making this again throughout the fall and winter.

I made this soup recently for my wife. This is an incredibly easy and tasty dish!
I chose to slice the potatoes super thin so they would break up more during cooking and I was pleased with the resulting thicker soup.
We both loved this soup and will surely make it again.

This is a wonderful soup! You could serve this in any situation. It is a beautiful and hearty soup. I didn't change a thing outside the fact that I just didn't have carrots. I noticed that one reviewer said that they didn't have to add the half and half, but it gives the soup a really nice creaminess. I wouldn't change a thing and I will be using this over and over. I did however cook bacon crumbled up on the side with grated cheese and chives for those that wanted to eat it like the loaded potato soup. Thanks Teresa, we love it?

We subbed veg stock for the chicken stock, used 8 oz of port mushrooms and added a few stalks of chopped celery. Served with shredded cheddar on top. Was a hit at this house!

My daughter-in-law asked me to use this recipe to cook for us all at her house once because she'd found leeks on sale and wanted to use them.  This recipe is easy and so delicious!  I am amazed how good the dill makes it, and a nice change from garlic or other flavors.  Our group likes it thicker, so I use cream and a bit more flour.  I also have substituted onions for leeks to save money, as well as thrown in extra mushrooms when they were on sale.  It's a very flexible recipe and still stays fabulous!

Maybe make this with less butter.  It was too rich, and I only enjoyed the first bowl.  It wasn't something I could eat day after day.

Good but nothing special. But if I made it again, I would use less butter, because there was too much grease floating on the top. I think white wine would taste really good in this.

I am a horrible cook, so I'm trying to learn.  I followed this recipe exactly.  It is excellent.  Even I couldn't ruin it.  I think it's even better the next day.  My first recipe from this website, and I know I'll be making it again.  Very easy and delicious!

I made this the other night, for a little dinner party to celebrate my mom's birthday. The proof was definitely in the pot, because there were no leftovers! (And, I had even increased the recipe by half!) We love garlic, so I included about two heaping teaspoons of jarred, minced garlic. I also followed the suggestion from one of the reviewers, and added some roasted chicken (white meat, only). I didn't have any plain dried dill on hand, but I did have a Pampered Chef dill blend, which seemed just right. A few guests don't care for mushrooms, and left them in the bottom of the bowl!) This is definitely a keeper!

Really hearty soup.  I made vegetarian by using vegetable broth instead of chicken.  I made it as is on the first try and it was fantastic.  I played with it a few days later and added other root vegetables and it was still excellent.  Easy and satisfying.

Very easy and delicious! We don't care for dill, so we used parsley and a little tarragon, which was very tasty. I also used canola oil instead of butter and fat free Greek yogurt (stirred a teaspoon into each filled soup bowl) to make it more healthy. I skipped the flour too. Will definitely move this into our regular meal rotation!

LOVE this soup! I used an onion instead of the leeks as I didn't have any on hand. I also use milk instead of the half and half and it still came out delicious and creamy! The dill flavour is great, don't skimp out on it! It's super filling and easy to make too!

This recipe was delicious! I was somewhat doubtful because of the simplicity of ingredients, but it was extremely tasty. I followed the recipe exactly except for adding about 1/2 the dill. (Not a big dill fan).

I also don't understand the rave reviews.  It was barely okay, no more.  Too much dill for my taste.  I won't make it again.

Says my husband, "It's good.  It's filling, smells good, but it's just not my first choice in soups."  I tend to agree.  I substituted the half-and-half with sour cream, and the leeks with one small onion, per other reviews.  I wish this soup were thicker, and I'll have to play around with the amounts of flour to find the right consistency. No need to garnish with fresh dill - it's dilly enough at the end of cooking to not warrant it.

OK so everyone knows that its not really proper to change a recipe and then rate it BUT I had no choice.  Having made a batch of lentil soup yesterday I was out of chicken broth, so used water and 3 boullion cubes.  Didn't have leeks so used onion.  Everything else was as written and this was very good.  It has a mild flavor, using onion, but it's definitely tasty.  I think that you could easily add ham or any kind of sausage that you would like, if you prefer some meat. The only prep change I made was to fist brown the mushrooms in the soup pot, why dirty another pan and waste the flavor, removed them and continued on.  I REALLY want to try this with the leeks, I'll bet it is like 10***s with leeks.  Thanks for the quick and tasty soup!

This soup is amazing; my family loves it.  I didn't have leeks so I used celery, and substituted low-fat evaporated milk for the half-and-half.  I also decreased the amount of butter used.  I served it with a fresh, crusty French bread. It's a perfect freezin'-cold-day-outside comfort soup. The only problem is that there are not enough leftovers!

Delicious! I made a couple minor adjustments....used onions since I had no leeks, and olive oil instead of butter. So, so good and filling....I used baby bellas as my mushroom of choice. My kids really liked this one...thanks, will make again!

I don't review on here nearly as often as I should, but I did have to say what a delicious soup this is. I did use FF cream as that was all that I had on hand, and added a hearty pinch of tarragon - we thought the soup was rich and delicious, and made great leftovers. Will be making again soon - thanks!

I have made a couple times now. Everyone now thinks I am some goddess in the kitchen. Picky kids loved it and went back for more. Healthy enough that the diabetics in the family could eat it as well. This is a new family favorite.

This is really good!  I wasn't sure about the dill, but it adds a nice touch.  I didn't have a leek, so used a bit of onion instead.  I like to make homemade soups in the fall and winter, and this is the perfect addition to my stash!

I can't go grocery shopping without my husband asking me to make this dish!  soo yummy.  Just wonderful as is!  Our first time using leeks, and the flavor is great.  We also used oyster mushrooms, but the regular white or portabellos are good too.

This soup is excellent.  I did use onion instead of leek, only because I didn't have leek.  Also I added about 3/4 cup chopped celeriac (celery root) just because I needed to use it up.  I will definately make this soup again, without my changes.  I know that it will still be great.

This soup was absolutely fantastic. The only herb I had on hand was parsley, so I used that instead of dill weed and it was still great. I'm not a huge fan of mushrooms, but I loved the flavor of the soup. Really great comfort food.

reply to Napolits: During steps 2 & 3, you want to keep the soup at a slow boil or "simmer".  I hope this helps.  It's a very easy soup to make, so I encourage you to give it a try.  You will be surprised at how quickly you learn ;-)  Good luck!

It was a solid soup. Great creaminess! I actually expected more of a punch from the dill and a complex flavor but it wasn't so.  I substituted red potatoes for regular potatoes and it was great!

A wonderful change-gourmet soup!UPDATE:I added too much dill while serving the 2 of us each day for lunch. Think it would be best to add each time, if you are keeping it a day or two.

Yummmy!  Our boys (3 and 6) ate their whole bowl and asked for it for another meal.  Really good.  Everyone liked a different aspect best.  The dill did if for me, although, not nearly as potent as I thought it would, when I saw how much went in the soup.  We used some broth that we had made a few weeks ago and so the salt wasn't at all too much.  Highly recommend it.

I haven't made this recipe yet because I'm a novice cook and am not sure if you are supposed to keep cooking the soup on medium heat during steps #2 and #3.  Can someone please clarify for me as I would like to try this recipe. Thank you.

A definite keeper.  The only changes I made were to use low sodium chicken stock and also 5% light cream.  Next time I might try non-fat evaporated milk.  Thanks for a recipe I'll definitely be making again.

This was a great meatless soup. If you're a fan of mushroom soup and potato soup, then you've got to try this.  I followed the recipe as written but I think next time I'll try to cut the calories a bit by substituting the half and half for milk or plain yogurt and the butter for canola oil.

We love this soup!!!  I didn't have high expectations since I am not a big mushroom soup fan but hubby likes it so I decided to give it a shot.  All of us really enjoyed this, my two year old even ate two bowls.  I thought about altering the recipe a bit with reducing the dill but decided to make as is this time and so glad I didn't change anything.  The dill was not overpowering.  This will be on the regular rotation for soups thank you!

Delicious soup that's perfect for winter. However, to make it five stars, I had to mash up 1/2 of the tomatoes to give it a thicker, chowder-like consistency. I also made it with red potatoes and left the skin on, but next time I might try it with one Russet potato to make it thicker. A delicious alternative to canned soup!

I could not believe how good this soup was, oh man. I didn't have half-and-half, so I used sour cream (I should have used less sour cream than 1 cup or less flour, in hindsight, the combo made the soup too thick). DELICIOUS. Even my mushroom-iffy husband loved it. Definitely going to make this one again!

Definitley use the sour cream over the half and half.  Last time I didn't peel my potatoes and it turned the broth a funny yellow color.  Tasted good still but I think I'll peel from now on

I used vegetable broth instead of chicken, added garlic, used hand blender to puree which thickens it considerably, used whole milk instead of cream and no flour, also only used 1 tbsp canola oil to sautee onions, used water in non stick skillet to sautee mushrooms to reduce fat some more. Very good soup, whole family loved it.

I am always looking for great soup recipes.  My husband and I loved this soup.  Only changes I made was I used sweet onions in place of the leeks, since I did not have any leeks and used fat free half and half, added a few extra potatoes and mushrooms, but other than that I followed the recipe.  I will definitely be making this again.

I made this soup with the following alterations:
-added 2 cloves, finely chopped, sauteed garlic
-no leeks, unfortunately I was out
-added 3 stalks chopped, sauteed celery

My family loved the soup. My husband thought it was the best mushroom soup recipe I've made.

Excellent! As a first time soup maker I found this recipe easy and delicious. I subsituted yellow onion and green onion for leeks, was generous with the dill and used baby portobello mushrooms along with regular mushrooms. Yum!

This recipe went over very well with our family.  We didn't have any leeks on hand, so left them out.  We also didn't have any fresh mushrooms, so used canned.  Otherwise, we stuck to the recipe and really enjoyed it.  My husband was especially impressed.  Kids who don't like mushrooms will probably pick them out, as my younger daughters did.  Otherwise, even they loved the soup.

We've made this soup several times, and it's AMAZINGLY good. I tend to skip the fresh dill, unless I have it around, and like to double the mushrooms (they're soooo good!). Otherwise, I  follow the recipe exactly. We rarely have leftovers when I make this!

This is a great soup.  Thick and chunky, with lots of flavor.  Per other reviews, I added a few extra potato and used a hand blender to blend part of it.  This way I didn't need the flour.  I threw in some dehydrated mushrooms after blending and some left over ham.

I made this exactly as the recipe was written except for adding the salt (I don't cook with much salt).  I tasted the soup right before serving and the only thing missing was the salt, so I added the amount called for and it was perfect.  I was concerned about the dill, but it was perfect and made this soup from good to excellent.  I loved it, but my husband who is very picky only said it was okay but could not pin point anything in particular that he did not like.  I will make again and my husband will just have to 'suffer'.  This is a definite keeper.

Awesome! The only thing I did different was reduce the salt by 1/2. Figured it could be added later to suit individual tastes if needed. Definitely a keeper.

THE BEST POTATO SOUP EVER!!! I consider this soup to be the best gourmet/comfort food I have found yet. My husband who doesnt like potato soup loves it. I made it to take to work and gave the recipe to several people. It was a Huge Hit!!. The only change I made to it was using onions instead of leeks. It is indeed restaurant quality, and when my sister finishes culinary school and opens a restaurant- this will definitely be on the menu.

This recipe was excellent with a few changes to make it a bit healthier.  I used onions because I can't get leeks where I live.  I increased the carrots, used reduced salt chicken broth, didn't add the extra salt, used milk instead of half/half and baby bella mushrooms instead of button ones.  I got multiple requests for the recipe.

I made this soup exactly according to the recipe.  Great flavor but a bit too salty.  I used chicken broth concentrate which is has a higher sodium concentration than regular chicken broth.
Next time I'll use no salt butter and lo salt broth.  Also, when you add the flour/half and half mixture you really need to cook the soup a bit more to overcome the "raw flour" taste.  Excellent starter with a little tweeking.

I've wanted a good potato soup recipe and I think I've found it!  I made the mistake of using my slow-cooker and not decreasing the stock so next time I'll either modify the liquid or cook on the stove as directed.  Even though it wasn't as thick as I think it was intended to be, the flavors were very comforting on one of the first very cold evenings in Upstate NY!

Hearty and comforting. This soup is like a hybrid of leek and potato and mushroom soup. I pureed about 1/3 of the soup in the blender and returned it to the pot before adding the flour and half and half. That extra step helped thickening the soup and I only needed 2 tablespoon flour. The recipe makes 8 medium servings.

I have had a Polish dill potato soup that was very similar to this recipe.  I have searched for a long time for something as good as this.  I did not alter or change the ingredients and loved it as is.  My husband is the type of person that wants meat in his soup or stew and he liked it a lot.  Definitely a keeper and will become part of my recipe collection.

Made it exactly to recipe (I did use portabella mushrooms) and this soup was fantastic, very hearty. Will add to our short list of cold-weather favorites.

Good recipe, family chowed on this one. My spoiled son had two bowls. Only change I made was to use 4 chicken bouillon cubes instead of the salt, just to cut down on salt and boost flavor.  It is a keeper. Make sure to use a good brand of chicken stock, or better yet, homemade (its not hard and you can freeze it). It make a HUGE difference in flavor in any dish!

This soup is freaking awesome.  I also made exactly as described and was perfect.  The only thing I added was shredded cheddar and real bacon pieces on top.  OMG---this is a keeper!  Thanks again.

Delicious and easy!  I halved the salt, and it was still plenty flavorful (perhaps because I used normal-sodium chicken broth).

My only complaint is that I severely scalded my mouth, eating this ambrosial soup too quickly!

This is the best soup I have EVER made.  My husband, usually not a soup fan, loved this, too.  The dill was perfect.  I did not use leek - used chopped sweet onion instead.   Also used whole milk instead of cream as that is what we had.  Fantastic recipe!

Want them to think you're an expert cook?
Make this.  I like a thick broth so,
thanks to other reviewers, I increased the flour.  But that's just a matter of
preference. As to the taste... how does
one improve perfection?  Thank you,
Dteresa.

My husband was craving for some of his mother's homemade Russian soup, and this more than satisfied his appetite! Thank you! If you would like some extra protein in there, I cut up some turkey sausage and had with my extra leftover soup, it was delicious!

Yumm!!! It is so easy and simple to make. I made it according the recipe the first couple of times and then I decided to make it my own. I have tried several alterations and my new favorite is useing white onions. It adds more flavor. This has become a stable in my kitchen and I feel that I will be using this recipe for years and years to come.
Thank you!

Awesome soup!  The only change was since I was planning to add bacon to please hubby, I sauteed the leeks and carrots in the bacon grease instead of butter. I also used less mushrooms b/c of kids.  But they all loved it!  Will definitely make this again!

Excellent!  I almost never follow a recipe exactly but I did with this one and it was fantastic.

The only changes I made were to make it dairy and wheat free.  I used margarine for sauteing the vegetables, cornstarch for thickening, and soy milk / silken tofu for the half-and-half.  Yum!

This is absolutely the best potato soup I've ever had. Potato soup is one of my favorites, so I've eaten many different versions. I made it pretty much like the recipe. The only thing I did different was use baby carrots, about two cups worth-uncut, because they are sweeter and more tender and I used shitake mushrooms, for the meatier flavor and texture. Other than that, I used the recipe and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes potato soup. I'll try the leftovers with some of the other suggestions.

This was an excellent fall meal. Easy to prepare and easy to personalize if you choose. We followed a few of the suggestions of other reviewers: 1) pureed the potato mixture before adding mushrooms, 2) used a mix of portabella and button mushrooms 3) added sour cream after tasting the original (this wasn't necessary...it was delicious both ways and didn't seem to alter the flavor that much). We also used fat free half and half and it was still thick, creamy and delicious...we let it simmer for about 20 minutes before eating. I will definitely make this again. (And my husband wrinkled his nose at the amount of dill when it was added, but agreed that it gave the soup an excellent, rich flavor once it was finished.) Great recipe!

SMACK!  This was awesome!  It's my new favorite potato soup - I've made it twice already!  As a side note - I used my immersion blender to blend up about half of the potatoes like another reviewer did.  That's just how I like it.  FABULOUS!  THANKS BUNCHES!

Absolutely wonderful! This was a great cross between a broth-based soup and your typical thick cream soup. I didn't have any half & half, so I used 1c milk plus 1c powdered coffee creamer (I mixed the powdered creamer with the flour before mixing with the milk), and it worked perfectly.

Fantastic, and a new family favorite.  My family is not big into dill, but cooking with the bay leaf gave it a taste all its own.  Simple, happy, comfort food.  I cut back on the salt and added a chicken bullion cube.
Great recipe!!!

Absolutely the best potatoe soup I'v ever had, and I'm not a big mushroom fan.  Outsid of adding sour cream which was suggested by other reviewers I wouldn't change a thing.  I searved my with fresh made italian bread.  A hearty meal which doesn't need any fluff to go with it.  The dill makes this dish absolutely amazing!

While I think this would rate 5 stars without changing a thing, I added bacon (leftover from breakfast), reduced the salt, and added garlic powder (husband's idea).  Really good and really easy.  Thanks for sharing.

Everyone loved it! Very good meatless soup. I was worried about the amount of dill, but it was not too much. The only change I made was that I used fat free half and half instead of the full fat version. It was still thick and delicious.

My 6yodd does not like potatoes. She hates mushrooms. She really doesn't care for carrots, either. She ate TWO bowls of this soup! It is delicious. I can't wait for lunch to have the leftovers.

Great fall/winter soup and easy to throw together.  I almost opted to reduce the dill but went with the full amount and am so glad I did.  It's an essential ingredient to this recipe.  I also added, as I always do, about 1 t of Worcestershire sauce to the mushrooms as I sauteed them.  Nice and hardy.  Thank you for posting this recipe!

I was looking for something different and this recipe was perfect.  It was fun, quick, and easy to make and it was a hit among the family.  I also made some Russian black bread to go with it and they paired very nicely.  Will definitely make again. Thanks for the great recipe!

This soup was hearty and delicious!  Plus it was super easy to make.  I didn't have 2 leeks, so I used one and substituted a yellow onion.  I also had to add a little extra salt (garlic) for my husband, but we both loved it!

Not only did this soup tast great, I also appreciated how easy it was to make.  It only took a few standard ingredients, basic cooking skills, and a short prep time.  This made the soup a reasonable dinner for me to cook just for myself.

DELICIOUS. The only thing I changed was using onions instead of leeks. I didn't have leeks on hand and just used up an onion. DELICIOUS. The dude loved it, and so did I. I had three servings. YUM.

very good! I left the chunks of carrots and mushrooms large, which is good when you eat it, but for the leftovers, which I froze, I would recommend having chopped the mushrooms and carrots into bite size pieces. 
I will definitly make again!

I like this recipe.  As is I give the recipe 4 out of 5 stars.  It was very delicious, but I think next time I will tweak it.  I would add less salt, less flour, more carrots and leeks.  Maybe less mushrooms.  I love mushrooms, but my boyfriend said it was WAY to much for his taste.

This was excellent!  The next time I make it, I will leave out the 2tsp of salt as I had already used a low sodium broth and it was still quite salty.

Can't wait until my family tries it tonight.  I've already had 2 bowls of it and it's not even lunchtime yet!

I was looking for an easy-to-make soup that was full of flavor, which I could use as a complete meal and not a side dish.  This recipe was simply PERFECT!  The taste was simply exquisite, it was very easy to prepare, and the ingredients were all affordable.  My whole family was blown away. :)  Thank you!

Good soup that can be altered to your tastes.  Can be made a little healthier with milk or ff half and half. It was just a little bland to me.  It was a very hearty soup though and very filling.  Maybe it will be better today.

Really hearty & filling - great for a cold winter day! I had some Portabella mushrooms that needed to be used so I used them instead of regular mushrooms like I used the first time and still, the flavor was amazing! Note that this recipe make A LOT of soup - cut it in half and you still have 6 servings...

This soup - well my version of it - was GREAT! Nice cool weather comfort soup. Here are the alterations I made for lack of original ingredients and reduced fat :-) 

4 tbs of olive oil instead of butter (2tbs to sautee onion and carrot, 2 tbs to sautee shrooms), 1/2 large yellow onion instead of leeks, 1 - 49.5 oz - can of chicken broth and half of that can of water, 1 can reduced fat cream of mushroom soup instead of the flour/cream mixture, and I added 1/4-1/2 lb of baby arugala. 

YUMMMMMMIE!

This is a very tasty soup, but I modified it quite a bit... I didn't add leeks. In the beginning, I sauteed the carrots and mushrooms all together at once instead of doing the mushrooms later (I'm all about saving extra time!). I also used more butter. My potatoes were red potatoes and I did not skin them. The mushrooms I used was a combo of shiitake, portobello, and white button mushrooms. In terms of seasoning, I ended up adding a little red pepper, parsley, savory, and garlic salt because I felt like it was missing a lot in terms of flavor. I almost didn't add the half & half/flour mix at the end because the broth was so good as is, but I went ahead and did it and was pleased. Once I made all of the above changes, I was very pleased with the recipe and so was hubby. We both have some left over for lunch today and tomorrow. Thanks!

Mmmmm… very good recipe.  I was dying to try this but didn't have all the ingredients so I did some compromising.  It still came out really good.  I substituted onions for the leeks and evaporated milk for the half and half.  Also, used one can of carrots instead of the fresh ones juice and all, but added them at the end.  I used two jars of 6oz. dry weight mushrooms and fried them to get the liquid out and them fried them in the butter.  I will make this again, hopefully with all the right ingredients next time.

Wonderful recipe. I did it without the cream or flour, because I prefer brothy to creamy soups, and I used more broth than called for. I used a combination of oyster and shitake mushrooms. The flavor combinations were wonderful. I'll absolutely be making this soup again. Thanks for posting it.

This soup is AMAZING!!!  Perfect for winter, I can see it becoming a family favorite!  I followed it exactly as stated, but instead of using 1/2 and 1/2 I used light cream (5%) and it was delicious!!  I'm so happy to have found this recipe.  Next time I'll experiment with different kinds of mushrooms.

Delicious and different!  My husband who HATES to eat soup loved this.  His first words were, "This is restaurant quality!"  He even had two helpings.  I cut the recipe in half for the two of us and had enough for another meal.

I made this soup following the recipe except I added a few more mushrooms, 1/2 regular and 1/2 shitake.  Wonderful flavor although a bit salty.  I think next time I'll use lower sodium chicken broth.  Excellent after shoveling the drive!  Thanks!

Made it just as the recipe calls for and it was absolutely delicious!  I made this at a family gathering and everyone that had a bowl of this soup had to have the recipe.  Love the Potato and Mushroom combination.  Yum Yum Yum!

Everybody loved this soup!  I used half butter and half olive oil and skipped the half and half as we are trying to cook low cholesterol at the moment.  I didn't thicken the soup - it was fine with just a plain broth base. Thanks for the delicious recipe!

Great Recipe. I only made three substitutions. I was going to be freezing this, so I thickened it with a roux, and I added a little madiera to the mushrooms, and used Veggie broth. Very Rich and flavorful.I will make it again.

Awesome soup! Easy to make! Easy to customize. I did change the recipe slightly. I used one large leek, 3 cloves of garlic, Yukon Gold potatos (which in my opinion added a nice buttering flavor), portabella mushrooms (but only 10 oz instead of 16) and to top it off I used some canned french fried onions (Durkee). Everyone loved it. I will definately make if again.

I made this for lunch on Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I didn't have any leeks and just used regular onion, but otherwise didn't change a thing. It's perfect just as is and I plan on making this often from now on!

This is one of the best soups ever!  I've made a second round and I even love it cold (brings out the dill).  I don't bother with peeling the potatoes, and it comes out great.  Excellent!

This is an excellent soup! Have printed the recipe and put it in my "keeper" box.  Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect.  My 4 Yr. old daughter even enjoyed it.  It is also the perfect soup to take to a sick friend or neighbor.  Can't go wrong with this great recipe!

This recipe was great the first night and absolutely fabulous when reheated. I too substituted green onions for leeks and it came out great. Thanks for an easy AND delicious recipe from a new wife and an even newer mom!

Wow! This recipe was incredible! The perfect soup to start out the cool months. I followed the recipe completely.  I think the next time I may reduce the butter; but oh what a treat! Thank you for sharing.

I love this soup!  The dill made it unique.  I did change it a bit.  I used fat free sour cream instead of half and half and much less flour for calorie sakes.  All in all .. excellent soup
