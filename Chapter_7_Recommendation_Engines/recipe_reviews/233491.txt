I followed the recipe as is, other than the cooking method. I baked in the oven versus frying, since I currently dont have a grill.
I liked the recipe, it was simple and I am sure most people would have the ingredients on hand. 
I would have liked a little more 'flavour" to it, maybe I need to up the thyme content next time around

Easy and delicious recipe. Subtle flavor that lets the flavor of the trout come through. Baked fish on baking sheet at 375 deg. F for same amount of time and it turned out great.
