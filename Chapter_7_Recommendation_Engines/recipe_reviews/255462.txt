10.11.16   I used garlic naan bread, mild Italian sausage, and my homemade marinara sauce.  I must say that the ricotta in the cheese base really does make this taste a bit like lasagna. The mozzarella on top did take a while to brown up, so I'll bump up the temperature to 400° next time.   Quick and easy lunch today....and tasty, too!

This was excellent.  Used mixture of Italian sausage and ground beef. Jake and Ty just had flatbread with Classico sauce and cheese.  They thought it was way better than pizza.

Great review from my husband so this is definitely a recipe to keep! I used mild Italian sausage, ricotta cheese and Naan flatbread.  Most likely will make this for a luncheon or a dinner when hosting guests.

Used hamburger and found it was not as flavourful. Would use sausage next time.

Delicious and filling. To get 6 servings my family ended up using 2lbs of sausage and the full jar of marinara sauce. Had some left over, but we like our sauce "meaty".

If you feel its too rich. Try using low fat cottage cheese. My family adores it. Simple changes of your choosing will make it a meal to remember.

My family enjoyed this recipe and I'm definitely going to be making it again. My marinara sauce was really bland, so I would recommend mincing up at least 3-4 cloves of garlic to give it a bit more flavour.

I scaled it down to make only 2 flatbreads and even at that, it was a lot of food! Takes care of lunch the next day! It was tasty, with a different flavour due to the ricotta cheese.

My family thought it was delicious. We used a store bought ( dairy department) pizza crust & I made my usual spaghetti sauce. I’ll definitely make this again.

I reduced the ricotta cheese to about 10 oz. and added 10 Crimini mushrooms (sliced)to the sausage while it was about 1/2 cooked. My wife and I both loved the final product and will make it again.

Used sweet onion pita and baked two on a rack.  I substituted sharp cheddar for ricotta. This is the easiest recipe for one-person meal; refrigerated and reheated second one  @375; even better the next day for lunch.

Good basic recipe. I added some sauteed mushrooms, garlic, onion and bell pepper to the meat mixture (ground Italian sausage). Will work with adjusting the seasoning next. Great the next day for lunch. A meatless version of this would also be so simple. A definite do-over dish for us.

I haven't made this yet, but it looks delicious!  A quick question for anyone willing to help out...is the parmesan cheese grated (Like the kraft stuff in the plastic container), or shredded?
Thanks, and I'll update once I make it!

I love this simple recipe! I used garlic naan instead of flatbread. Since I am vegetarian, I chopped up some thin "chicken" strips to replace the sausage on top and it was soo good! We plan on experimenting with different toppings like sauteed mushrooms, olives, etc. Thank you for what will surely be a recurring favorite!

I liked it, my family liked it. It wasn't quite at the loving it stage though. It could be the way i cooked it but it just didn't make it there yet, to me i felt that the ricotta cheese was too much snd to add less of that. I would consider making it again, it was enjoyable. Thanks for uploading this recipe!
