Have made this recipe twice now.  It's absolutely fantastic and easy to follow.  The fun part is watching the raw shrimp cook in lime juice with no heat at all.  This is a great appetizer dish to prepare ahead of time, as giving it time (overnight) allows all the flavors to mix.

I Didn't have tostada shells, so I used tortilla chips instead.  I once used the lime juice in a plastic lime container, and this worked fine.  Just make sure you have enough lime juice to submerge all of the shrimp, and stir/mix at least once or twice while the shrimp is "cooking"

Excellent! I used 1/2 shrimp & 1/2 crab and added a full bunch of chopped cilantro and a diced avacado, as well as 3 jalapenos instead of serranos. This was fantastic! We ate it with corn chips instead of on tostadas. Yum:)

I have waited so long to make ceviche and this recipe was perfect. Very easy to make and it was absolutely delicious. I make it at least once a week now.

Made this for work and everyone loved it!!  Too spicy and tart to eat the night I made it, but by the next day all the flavors had blended and mellowed perfectly.  Perfect recipe!

I added avocado and used crabmeat and mahi mahi in this dish. After increasing by several limes for juice I left overnight and the seafood cooked perfectly. Next time I'll shred the fish, rather then cube it for even faster cooking. Refreshing dish.

Excellent!  I add a couple more limes to cover and added 1/3 cup chopped cilantro. Sometimes the time varies a little depending on the amount of limes and the temperature of the fridge. One time I used my friend's fridge and it took 4 hours but that was because her fridge was set at almosts freezing (her milk was icy).

I made a few changes I did 1/2 lb bay shrimp. (the little ones) 1/4 lb immitation crab and 1/4lb bay scallops (little ones). I did a rought chop of all making sure to chop the scallops more than the crab and shrimp because they were already cooked. I put all the scallops on the bottom so they would be submerged in the lime the most. I cut all the veggies and added a handfull of cilantro. Mixed it all up and added some tapatio. Let it sit over night. YUM YUM!

Thanks for posting this!   A few changes: I found as I was adding the tomatoes that it called for a lot and I wanted to feature the shrimp more so I held back a tomato. Also added more limes, cubed avocado and some chopped cilantro. It not only adds taste and texture but also great color contrast!   Definitely making this again! My friends complimented me on it all night! :)

The best ceviche I've made to date! I didn't add as much pepper as it called for and skipped the hot sauce.

YUM! This was incredible with bite sized pieces of avocado added. It was perfect after marinading for 24 hours. Be aware though, it makes a lot! I might half the recipe for two next time since I understand the leftovers don't keep very well.

Great recipe! I added diced cucumber and lots of chopped cilantro. Chile/lime powder is great to sprinkle on top (you can usually find this in your local Mexican/Hispanic grocery store).

so delicious!  i was a little nervous about the shrimp, so we marinated the shrimp for at least 4 hours in extra lime juice, which turned out great.  also added avacado and cilantro.  a friend who doesn't even like ceviche loved it!  definitely making again and again.

Fabulous.  Added the avocado and cilantro as others suggested and 'cooked' overnight in fridge.  My mother said "I thought ceviche was raw"  I said "This IS raw."

Lovely, light, clean flavors. I juiced a handful more limes in order to cover the shrimp and also added half a cup of torn cilantro and one chopped avocado. The shrimp cooked in about three hours for me but I didn't serve it until a total of twelve hours. The shrimp were still tender but the next day the few bites that were left were a little rubbery.

Excellent recipe.  A few substitutions I made:  I used one pint of grape tomatoes cut in half instead of the roma tomatoes,increased recipe to 5 limes (felt like there was not enough marinade), red onion instead of yellow, and 3 large, diced jalapeno peppers instead of serrano. Also, I let marinade 4 hours as I felt 1 hour was not enough for the shrimp. 

I look forward to trying the avocado and cilantro additions next time!

I made this with a pound of scallops and served it with tortilla chips. We let it marinate for 2 hours and unfortunately the limes we chose turned the dish a bit bitter. We added some honey and more salt and left the dish alone until the following day. Served as a nibbly app, our guests raved about it.

Shrimp ceviche is one of the very few things i can make without following a recipes (just from watching my mom make it when I was growing up) but I decided to check out some recipes to see how others make it.  Anyways, this is pretty much how my mom made it.  Delicious!  Only thing I added was some shreaded carrots, green onions, and slided avocados.  I like to mix shrimp and immitation crab to mine but shimp alone is also great.

This was really good, much like the fresh ceviche that I recently had in Belize and have been craving.  I added a little more spice with jalapeno and also added chopped cucumber and carrots.  I think they are a must.

I had never eaten ceviche, but it sounded interesting. YUM! It was fresh, light, had the right heat and I loved the texture. I halved the recipe since I was just feeding a few people. I followed the recipe, except I let it set for several hours. Also, for convenience I spooned it into the scoopable tortilla chips. I think adding an avocado would be good

It's almost exactly like the authentic Ceviche that I've had before.  The hot sauce is a most because it adds the "authentic" flavor to the ceviche.

Very, very good ceviche. My preference is without the cucumber, but it is good both ways.

Added cubed ripe avocado and a half bunch of fresh chopped cilantro.  Served with restaurant style nacho chips, a side salad and homemade sangria— the perfect summer patio meal.  Will be making again! (Used the juice of five limes)
