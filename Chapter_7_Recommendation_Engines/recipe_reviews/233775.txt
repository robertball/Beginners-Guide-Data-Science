I used two large ears of corn from a local farm stand (end of season and not great ) that I roasted, and they worked perfectly here. I scaled it down to five servings and used whipped cream cheese. I also took it out of the oven a few minutes short of the 30 min specified. Good side dish, but I had some right out of the oven as a dip with mini tortilla chips. I'm thinking this will be a good side for a holiday buffet. Can see adding some sauteed onions to this, as well. Nice recipe!

Tasty but this turned out more like dip than a real side dish. I used whipped cream cheese as I didn't have the block type. I only had canned mild green Hatch chiles so that is what went in. I cut this down to only can can of corn and adjusted ingredients accordingly. This was really good, but I'd rather have had it as a dip next time.

Used my homemade pickled jalapeños and garnished with additional peppers and black olives.  Really good side dish for a Mexican meal or most meals, actually.  Watch it once it goes into the oven, as you really don't want this to overcook and dry out.  That creamy sauce is part of what makes this so special.
