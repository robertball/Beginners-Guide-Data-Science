This was AMAZING! No "cream of" just pure wholesome yumminess!  I added some sautéed mushrooms to mine, and it was absolutely delicious! This is a keeper!

This was a winner in our house!   The recipe came together quickly which is always a plus on a busy weeknight!  I prepared as the recipe stated, but, seasoned the pork chops with a light dusting of salt and plenty of fresh cracked pepper. I also sauteed some mushrooms in with the onions and garlic.   I opted to use the Swanson's beef stock instead of the broth and it gave great depth of flavor.   The pork chops were moist and very tender and the gravy thickened perfectly.  I would rate the recipe easily a 4-1/2 star recipe.   To make a full five star recipe for me though, I would probably add some additional seasoning to the gravy like fresh thyme or a touch of sage and I do think you should season your pork chops before searing.  Go light on the salt though until you taste your gravy.  I served with garlic mashed potatoes & roasted asparagus.  Overall, a great recipe!

This is great! I added a lot of extra seasoning because the recipe itself doesn't even call for salt and pepper. I also used Swanson chicken stock instead of beef. I added mushrooms with the onions and garlic and I also added the suggested Dijon mustard and Rosemary. My boyfriend loved this!

3-9-2016  ~Not bad, not bad!  Certainly easy, that’s for sure – a no stress dinner that doesn’t call for a gazillion different ingredients and steps.  The chops cry out for some seasoning, however; I chose Montreal Steak Seasoning but there are many that would be good.  Also, be careful not to overcook these – it doesn’t matter how delicious they MIGHT have been had you not cooked the heck out of them.  If you have a thermometer, use it – the current rule of thumb for proper cooking temperature is 145 degrees, and it is very easy to surpass that.  We enjoyed this no nonsense, simple American comfort food.

I was unsure after reading the ingredients, thought it might be bland, but this turned out to be a new family favorite. The only change I made was to season my pork with our favorite spices and used bone in pork sirloin chops. The pork was tender and fell off the bone. Amazing!

This is an easy and quick mid-week recipe that anyone at the dinner table would think you spent hours in the kitchen preparing! I did use a thinner, bone in pork chop and added some mushrooms. Very simple, easy to prepare, my niece thought it was "gourmet!"

So I goofed and misread the ingredients. I used bone in pork chops instead of boneless. This was tasty nonetheless! The beef broth used in the sauce paired very well with the mashed potatoes used with chicken broth. I would try this with more of a breading or some sort of a browning crust on the pork to add more texture.

Quick, easy, and delicious. I used 3/4" thick center cut pork loin chops, browned them on each side for 3 minutes over medium-high heat and they came out tender and juicy. I followed the add-on suggestion and mixed in Dijon mustard and dried rosemary. Even with the mustard the sauce is a little underwhelming for flavor, so I think without the mustard it would be too bland. I also added sliced baby bella mushrooms with the onions and sauteed them both for  6 minutes before adding the garlic.

GOOD FAST EASY  This was very tasty. I used pork tenderloin
Sliced in portion sizes ,not chunks or slices just nice size pieces. As always with pork  watch watch watch. Everything is
lost when you dry them out. Other than that great.

This went over well in my home.  I did not have the Swanson brand beef broth and instead used the "Better than Bullion" brand of beef base mixed with water. It worked well for us. The chops were moist and tasty. I served them with herbed rice, corn and garlic knots (rolls).   The gravy in this recipe is very flavorful. It'll be great with leftovers tonight on mashed potatoes.

I made the rosemary dijon version and it was great! I did use chicken broth due to allergies instead of beef. I also upped the garlic  (we like garlic and I knew 2 cloves wouldn't be enough). I seasoned my pork chops with pepper and a sprinkle of salt. It turned out wonderful! My pork chops were perfectly cooked (be sure to use a thicker pork chop) and my entire family devoured it.

This was delicious yet simple. I did season the pork chops with Goya "Perfect Seasoning" and pepper. I added a splash of worcestershire sauce while the "gravy" was cooking. We all loved this. Yum!!

Like many of the other cooks, I salt and peppered my pork steaks (that's what I had in the freezer)before searing, using two steaks and keeping the rest of the amounts the same. I upped the garlic to 3 cloves and added 2 1/2 teaspoons of Herbes de Provence for additional flavor. I also sauteed 6 oz. of sliced crimini mushrooms with the onion and garlic. I used reduced-sodium Swanson's chicken broth. So convenient and I like the idea of less sodium. Easy, tasty anytime meal that I will certainly will be making again. I also appreciate that this is NOT a cream-of-something-soup pork chop dish. Thank you, Swanson's.

These came out delicious! I used the thick pork chops like it calls for in the recipe and they were were so nice and juicy. My daughter who is usually my biggest critic said they were the best pork chops she has ever had. Thank you Swanson for a fantastic recipe.

The gravy part was pretty tasty, but the chops were way overcooked in the 5 minutes, so make sure you are careful about that. I think in the future I would sear them very fast and then remove them as soon a seared crust was achieved. I used shallots and added dried cherries to mine, plus salt & pepper as several reviewers noted an absence of seasoning. Thanks for sharing!

We enjoyed this but like a few other reviewers, mine took a little longer to cook and was very bland as is. We added some salt and pepper to ours but definitely needed something else. We served it with creamed corn and garlic bread. Very quick and easy recipe!

This was a good, easy meal.  I think the next time I'll add some mushrooms just to give it a little extra.

Even after salting and peppering the pork chops, I thought this dish was bland, and it took much longer to cook (I use 145 internal temperature with a meat thermometer for pork).  The sauce thickened beautifully, and I decided to take the Recipe Twist route and added the recommended Dijon mustard and freshly-chopped rosemary.  That worked great in bringing needed flavor to this recipe which I felt definitely needed seasoning.  I think the addition of the Dijon and rosemary to the sauce (other herbs would work, too) improve this recipe greatly, and adding some mushrooms was a good choice, as well.

Such bold flavors for a quick and easy dinner that has so few ingredients. This will go into my regular rotation.

My family loves this recipe! I seasoned the pork chops with salt and pepper, then followed the directions as written. I served this with cheddar grits...it was sooooo good and soooo simple!
