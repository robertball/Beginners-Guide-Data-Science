Overall, this was not all it should or could have been.  It was kind of dense and crumbly.  After the fact, I compared the measurements to another similar recipe that I had made before.  I really think for this much sugar and flour the butter should be 1 cup not 1/2 cup and the baking soda upped to 1/2 tsp.   Sorry - this was worth a try but I wouldn't do it twice.

I've tried many pound cake recipes   but this by far was one of the best! My cake was very moist and fluffy. Some like a more heavier cake and others like fluff so I made one in a regular cake pan and one in the bundt to get both effects. The only things I changed was  I used cake flour, adding a 1/2 cup of Mayo and 1/2tspn of vanilla & almond w a whole squeeze lemon and baked at 345Â° The cake turned out wonderful!
