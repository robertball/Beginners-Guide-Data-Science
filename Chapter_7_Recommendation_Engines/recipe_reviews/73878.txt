I've been making this for quite some time and had to rate it since it's far too underrated for its category.  This is definitely the side to use if you're trying to impress.  Words cannot describe it's goodness. If you like mushrooms, you'll love this!

A delicious dish that is not too difficult. For a great vegetarian sandwich, serve open-faced on toasted rosemary foccaccia spread with dijonnaise. Sprinkle with chopped fresh parsley. For the reviewer who ended up with venegar tasting mushrooms, your wine must have been off. Thanks for the recipe.

Definite five star.
 I used a delicious red wine from the nights before, it was wonderful.  If the wine is good, the mushroom will be as well. For presentation, remember that white wine will not change the color of the mushrooms as the red wil darkened them a bit.

This was simple and all done on the BBQ.
Will make it again
Thanks for sharing

Mushroom lovers, try this recipe.  To the reviewer who needed to add cornstarch to the "sauce," note that the recipe states to let the wine "nearly evaporate."   No sauce with this dish.  I rubbed olive oil into the mushrooms (both sides) prior to grilling.  I didn't have shallots onhand so used half a large vidalia onion and added garlic, like other reviewers.  Paired nicely with grilled Steelhead Trout from this site.  Thanks RCOWGILL !

We loved this!  Didn't have shallot so we used vidalia onion instead and it was just wonderful with grilled steaks.  Thanks!

Only had leeks and added garlic. I served over thinly sliced steak and sprinkled with real roquefort...yumm! I used a $3 bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon and the wine flavor was perfect.

I used white wine and garlic instead of shallot. Added some cornstarch because the sauce was too watery for us. It was easy, impressive side dish.

My husband has been making something like this for a while now.  He always uses red wine (since we're grilling steaks), wht. sliced mushrooms, sometimes more or less Worcestershire, sometimes more or less A-1, garlic, butter, always red wine.  Even when we use a spoiled red wine, it has never tasted vinegar-like.  I can't wait to try this with shallots!  You really can't miss w/a saute of wine, butter, shallots, garlic, and mushrooms!

Delightful taste & easy to prepare. I'm giving it five stars ... BUT ... it is not even close to "and can be prepared in the time it takes the steak to be grilled" ... well, only if you prefer your beef medium well or worse (YUCK !!). My fault, really; if I'd been thinking I'd have realized 15 minutes on the grill will ruin virtually any steak. Prepare the mushrooms, timing to finish at about the point you would normally turn the meat. On the whole, after using this several times, I do prefer the shallot to a Vidalia and frequently use Sherry in the place of white as I seldom have the latter - typically younger diners prefer the sweeter taste.

Never cooked mushrooms in wine before. Tell you what I will be cooking them in wine again. Shopping day tomorrow so one bottle of wine and mushrooms on the shopping list. Thanks for the recipe. Cheers from New Zealand. ??

For those without a grill, a pan and stovetop work great. To save time, I sliced mushrooms before and omitted the shallot. This ensured done-ness throughout. Also, halve the wine or it will take forever to evaporate. Tasty!

WE LIKED HOW THEY COOKED UP ON THE GRILL, BUT EVEN WITH A NEW BOTTLE OF WINE, WHEN IT COOKED DOWN IT TASTED LIKE VINEGAR (WHICH MY BOYFRIEND HATES).  I WOULD MAKE, BUT WITH LESS WINE NEXT TIME.

Fantastic, easy recipe.  I made this recipe indoors using my cast iron grill pan to grill the mushrooms.  Use a good white wine and follow the recipe as is and the dish will be great.

Great! Delicious and very simple to make. Also, my boyfriend is a big meat person and usually prefers some kind of meat with his dish. But I was trying an all-veggie dinner, and he ended up saying he didn't even miss meat and that this dish seemed like a pretty good substitute, and I agreed! Very good. As the recipe calls for white wine, I used the only kind I had available, Moscato, which is of course very sweet. And it was of course delicious, but I'd be curious what it'd taste like with a dry wine. I'll have to try that sometime in the future. Also, I didn't use a grill to cook the mushrooms -- I instead just roasted in a skillet (with a light spray of  olive oil) on the stove. Couldn't tell any difference!

I added a splash of Lea and Perrin's for enhanced flavor; I'm a big fan! Although I didn't do it this time, I could see using a larger volume of liquid, a little less reduction and some thickener to make a very nice wine sauce for steak or pork.

I made this exactly as written... then I added salt and pepper to save it. Most of the positive reviews mention they used red wine.  That's a huge difference from white wine as written.

Delicious and easy!  highly recommend.  Made just one addition - adding garlic to the shallots.  Grilling the mushrooms is key!

Fantastic!  I have done this both on the grill or just on the stove in a pan....both are great!  The grilling doesnt make a whole lot of difference in the taste as sauteeing it in the wine overpowers the grilled flavor anyways.  Also have used many different types of wine.... as long as you love the wine your using and like portabellos, you really cant go wrong!  Portabellas are hearty enough to eat as a main dish and healthy to top it off.  Easy Peazy but tastes like you spent hours in the kitchen preparing a gourmet dish!

Sherry vs wine, butter, shallots, garlic, and mushrooms. Parmesan cheese. Delicious side dish.

Excellent dish. The first few times I grilled the mushrooms on the george foreman grill and used large portobellos. The last 2 times I used baby Bellas and made the whole thing in the pan, I just skipped the grilling part and they were still delicious. 
Everyone in our family just loves this recipe. thanks for sharing
