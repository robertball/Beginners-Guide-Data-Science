I had a wonderful vegetarian fideua this past spring in Barcelona (fideua is popular in the Catalonia region of Spain), so was excited to find this recipe.  I couldn't find frozen artichoke hearts, and thought using canned might be too mushy...plus they weren't in the dish I had, but peas were, so I added those instead.  This is a very tasty recipe and close to the real thing.  I think using the cast iron skillet and sticking it in the oven would add the final touch.  Will make this again.

Simple, but excellent.  I used 4 cups of chicken stock, and could have used slightly more.  Next time i'll increase the quantity of tomoatos to 2.5 cups.

I cut the recipe in half and it still made more than enough for my husband and I.  Followed the directions exactly with the exception of using more stock as it wasn't enough to cover the noodles and vegetables.  The dish ended up with a slightly off flavor and we couldn't figure out why.
