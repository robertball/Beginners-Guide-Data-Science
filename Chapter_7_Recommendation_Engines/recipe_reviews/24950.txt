five stars for the fun factor alone! I'm snowed in with "Snowmagedon" her in PA and just opened my door scooped out some snow mixed in soda for my son and put it in a fancy glass. He loved it! I'm planning a Snow-mopolitan for myself for later.

Ice cream made with snow never tastes like traditional ice cream...but this was something else entirely. It was a really odd flavor. We tried again with apple juice and that was eaten right up!
