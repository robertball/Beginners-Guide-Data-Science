The ingredients were correct however the amounts led to a very runny milkshake. We added two additional scoops of icecream (all of our scoops were made with an icecream scoop and the scoops were large)and an additional ice cube. Then it needed a little more flavor so we added more vanilla.

Delicious and took less time then waiting in line for one at McDonalds (by the way did you all know fast food shakes dont contain dairy? they're a whipped oil product..ick!). This recipe was cool and refreshing, and I made mine with fat free frozen yoghurt and skim milk so I can just imagine how creamy and sweet it would taste using the regular ingridients!

While making this recipe, I used the amount of ice cream than called for, and after blending it was still absolutely soupy. I tried another scoop, but it wasn't much better, and had too much vanilla. The milkshake was good, but not what I was expecting.

This was pretty good, but it barely made 1 serving, and 1 1/2 cups of milk would have been way too much.  I used only 1 cup and it was too thin.  I made a second batch omitted the milk entirely and poured the first batch in.   The two batches together made almost 2 servings.

This milkshake was very bad.  I just made it and i can still taste the bad taste.  I added extra icecream because I tried makeing a milkshake earlier that made barely 1 cup  and that might have been where I went wrong.  I gave this milkshake a second star because the ingredients is very easy to fingd and put together.  Overall I reccomend trying a different milkshake!

I did everything correct, and it came out soupy and had way too much vanilla. And I am a HUGE vanilla fan. In almost every recipe I do, I add a little extra vanilla because I love it sooooo much. I did the right amount of vanilla this time around and it was too intense. Don't make this recipe if you value your taste buds...

Basic recipe that we have always followed (minus the sugar.) Tried it with the sugar, didn't see much of a difference. We only use a cup of milk and it's the consistency we love.

great vanilla taste, but too thin. I needed to add at least three additional scoops of ice cream and cut down the milk to 1/2 cup.

ok, so i NEVER measure things... i put two shakes of sugar and about 1 tablespoon of vinilla in the mixer...then i went for the milk...well...we didn't have any, so i added 3 scoopes of ice cream and blended it together...well, that didn't work too great so i added about 1/2 a cup of water and two more scoops of ice cream and blended that all together. It turned out GREAT!! great consistancy, really thick, goopy, delicious =)

Put too much milk so it came out thinner than I like.  I did not add the extra sugar and  really liked the flavor!   Will put less milk next time for a thicker shake!  YUM

Tastes wonderful. Ruins my diet. My alternative is skim milk with artificial sweetener and vanilla extract (not imitation). I actually like this warm, like a "steamer" from a coffee bar. It satisfies my craving for sweets, with so many fewer calories.
