This didn't even deserve a "1" star rating. I just tried to make these cookies, and they came out terrible! There's not enough dry ingredients for the cookies to hold a shape, they collapse in the oven. I was left with a puddle of burnt cookie dough.

I found this recipe to fit my needs pretty well. Even though I didn't have enough vanilla (used about 1/4 teaspoon), they were delicious. Crisp bottom, chewy top. I didn't use the peanut butter chips or the walnuts, because I was baking for a picky couple of guys! A note - I used a cookie scoop for these. The first batch came out with the weird marks on the top from the scoop's wiper, and they stuck slightly to my baking sheet. For the second 2 pans, I put down parchment, and pressed them lightly with my hand before baking. Perfect! :)

I made this with just the chocolate chips (omitting the nuts and candy), and it was delicious.  They spread nicely and had a soft, chewy texture.  Everybody loved them!  Best cookies ever.

These are quite good as long as you don't over cook them,18 min. was too long. 13to15 min. was plenty of time.I love the honey flavor in these cookies. I also like not having to use shorting in the recipe like in some other chocolate chip cookie recipies.

Hi I just made these cookies for some teachers and they came out wonderful. Their texture is a little different, soft and crunchy at the same time. I substituted candy for dark chocolate chips and macadamia nuts. I also used a little bit more cinnamon and margarine instead of butter. They came out wonderful! Great recipe for gifting cookies!

Much better than i expected.  I halfed this recipe, and it made 2 dozen cookies.  Cookies were soft and delicious.  I ommited the cinnamon because i didn't see the point, and just added chocolate chips instead of nuts etc.

OMG! These are  very good. I added blueberry infused dried cranberries, m&m's,  and chopped pecans because it's what I had on hand. I misread the amount of vanilla, only added one teaspoon, everything else I followed to a T and baked for exactly 15 mins.  Very easy & good, I'm saving this one. Thanks!  :-)

The cookies turned out amazing. One of the better cookie recipes on this site that I have made. I make cookies every week, so that says something. I made these cookies on May24 it is five days later and still soft. 
Thanks, Brittney

Well, I don't know if I did something wrong but these came out like little clumps of dough.  Although I enjoyed the taste of the cookies, they didn't spread at all.  I only know how to bake by following recipes, but maybe if I add a little more butter next time they will spread better.

A brilliant cookie recipe, with plenty of flavour and it's crunchy. However, does anyone know a good substitute for cinnamon as it ruins the whole taste for me.

I used 1/4 cu. cinnamon chips as well.  My husband loved them!  I would prefer if they were a little more chewy.
