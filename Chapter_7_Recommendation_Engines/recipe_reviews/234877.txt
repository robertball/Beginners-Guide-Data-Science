Prior to making It, I perused the 3 other reviews.  One noted it to be soggy.   I made it using 3/4 cup of water and was making it for guests we were entertaining, finding it easier to do the final cook in the oven rather than tending to it in the microwave.  I cooked it at 350 F for about 35 minutes.  Turned out very well, not soggy.  All of us thought it was delicious.  Thank you for the recipe.

Made this exactly as the recipe called for.  My husband loved it, in fact he ate almost half of it within the first few hours of it coming out of the oven.   We will definitely be making this again!

I've made this a few times and it's very good. I didn't realize until I was in the process of making it that it is cooked in the microwave. It's very easy to make. I've switched apples with peaches a few times. I don't think it needs the white sugar, especially if you use peaches. The leftovers get really soggy, so I pop each serving in the microwave again.
