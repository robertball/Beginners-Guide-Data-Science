I live in the U.P. and was looking for an approximate amount of vegetables.  This recipe was the perfect balance!  As far as everyone else saying they were dry, my grandmother used to put a pat of butter inside of it before closing it up, and it wasn't dry at all. Hope that helps.

I'm from the U.P. of Michigan, so I grew up knowing what a "real" pasty should taste like, not the  they call pasties here in Detroit.  I left out the pork, rutabega, and MSG because I couldn't find any at the store, but it still turned out great!  I was able to make 10 pasties.  The crust was a little dry, but I may have cooked them too long for the size that I made.  Next time I'll try brushing with milk as another person suggested.

To freeze them, let cool after cooking and wrap in tinfoil.  To reheat, place the frozen pasty in the oven at 350 degrees for about an hour (or you can microwave it if you let it thaw first).

Great Pasties!  The crust was easy to make, although I added salt to make it a bit more savory.  I followed the recipe exactly and it made 12 generously sized pies.  I baked half and froze half on a cookie sheet, transferring them to a freezer bag after they were frozen.  I baked the frozen ones in a 425 degree oven for about 50 minutes, and they came out perfect.  This is definitely a keeper!

These are awesome!!  My husband went to Michigan Tech in Houghton MI (UP), and he said "they are as good as Verna's"  Verna  was his fraternity's cook and would occasionally make pasties.  Obviously the people posting reviews lower than a 5 and complaining that they are "bland" have never had a pasty and don't know how they are supposed to taste!  These are not for dieters, and you will wreck them if you try to cut out the fat!  Run an extra mile or 2 and make them the way you are supposed to!  My husband and I agree that they need more than 1/2 c of rutabaga and fewer potatoes.  I did not use the MSG, and they were still awesome.  MSG is not needed. My husband says that Verna probably didn't even know what MSG was, and she knew how to cook pasties!  You won't be disappointed with this recipe if you are looking for a true pasty recipe.

I am not from MI; however, my husband is and he loves pasties so I thought it would be nice to have and old favorite.  We both agreed that these where really good.  I did make a few changes to include omitting the MSG and adding 1 tbsp of worcestershire instead.  I also used 1 lb of beef (97% lean) and 1.25 lb. of pork.  I didn't have the beef bouillon so I substituted with 1/4 cup of chicken broth and used 3 cups of potatoes and 3 cups of turnips diced (only because I didn't have rutabaga).  The last change was putting only 1 cup of filling in each pastie.  I ended up with 12 pasties half of which I froze.  They were great not to dry and not greasy.  Oh and for a golden color I coated the top of each pastie with egg white wash.  Next time I will devide the dough into 12 equal portions, form balls, and roll out until about 1/4 in thick.

These are great!  Another one born and raised in Michigan, and these taste like the real thing, including one I had while in England.  The rutabaga is a must for the flavor, and I had no trouble with dryness.  I spiced the filling up a bit and added a little worchestershire sauce, and I brushed the outsides with eggwash before baking.  I'll be making more and freezing them soon!

I'm a yooper and these pasties are better than some in Marquette pasty shops--- the crust makes the whole thing!  I do omit some of the things I don't like and sub extra potatoes/onion for them- it seems to work just fine!  A batch of them takes me a good 3-4 hours, start to finish...I like the dough to be just right!

Excellent recipe.  My British husband loved these.  Added lamb to the mix, and omitted the msg (couldn't find).  Delicious!

My mother was from Palmer, Michigan and I misplaced her recipe when I moved.  This is almost identical to the pasties I grew up with. Adjust, the amount of veggies, and seasonings, great with ketchup.  My grandchildren love this, they just pick it up and go. EXCELLENT!

On a quest for the perfect pasty recipe, I found this one. I must say, better than grandma's! These were fabulous! I like to boil the ground beef and pork a bit to remove extra fat. Other than that, I followed to a T and these turned out flaky and delicious.As others have advised, these freeze beautifully. Thanks for sharing.

I am an original Yooper from the Western UP, living in Wisconsin now. This recipe is as close to a traditional Finnish pasty that I have seen with the exception of beef bouillon and MSG.  Yukon gold are the best potatoes for this and I would suggest some minced garlic for added flavor.  For those that struggle with the crust, try the ready to bake Pillsbury 9" pie crusts... just unroll, fill it up and bake.  Great recipe!

I ended up making 1 1/2 recipes of the pastry to match the amout of filling.  All in total it equalled 18 pastries.  We all found it a bit dry so next time we are adding 1/3 cup of A1 Steak Spice and a smooth beef gravy to go over them.

maybe you have to grow up on these things or something, but we ALL thought they were extra gross, and of course, the recipe makes a ton of them.  UGH!

My whole family loved these! My husband and I are from Michigan, so these were a treat! I ate it with gravy and my husband had his with ketchup. My kids just ate them up!

We followed the recipe exactly, minus the msg. I ended up with 7 large pasties and 1 small one. We couldn't fit 1 1/2 cups of filling in each (more like 1/2 a cup), so we had quite a bit of leftovers that we just fried it up and ate.

Next time I will add a bit of butter to my dough, or butter flavored Crisco, to give it a bit more flavor, and double it (dough) so we have leftovers and enough dough to use all the filling!

I made a "somewhat" lighter version of these pasties, using very lean ground beef and pork and no lard in the pastry.(Crisco instead) I also eliminated the MSG (allergies) and the pasties were delicious. I packed them fresh out of the oven and went to the beach (west coast of Northern California) to watch the sunset. We found a lone picnic table, set up our meal and the pasties were a bigger hit than the sunset. Everyone raved about them. I am from Michigan so when I read this recipe I knew it was authentic. The rutabaga really gives them that touch of flavor that reminds you of the Upper Peninsula. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, I will use it again and again. They definitely need to have milk brushed over them before baking...makes for a lovely, soft golden crust.

My mum was born in Cornwall England and I have many happy memories of her making us Cornish pasies when we were young. She always used short crust pastry The correct meat to use is actually shin beef cut very small , a cooking onion chopped up , carrots , turnip and potatoes chopped finely Cover the whole thing with salt and pepper , no stock at all. Fill the  pastry full , pull together to make the " spine " and make slits in the top Brush with milk We used to sit on the porch with our hot pasties wrapped in greaseproof paper , a great childhood memory

These were wonderful! Full of flavor, reminding me of the pasties we had in U.P. MI last summer! I however "cheated" and used Pillsbury premade pie crusts. I also took the advise of previous reviews and generously brushed the crust with a white egg wash. They came out beautiful...picture perfect!

Very good. I left out the msg for obvious reasons. The recipe made way more filling than I could use with the dough recipe. I ended up buying store bought pie crust and it worked great. I also put some filling in ramikens and topped with crust to make pot pies. They were a HUGE hit. I added a little worcestershire to the second batch of dough and preferred the flavor to the original.

Guess it depends upon where you are from, but if you are from Butte, Montana these pasties are simply not up to par...sliced potatoes? pork? MSG? beef bouillon? rutabaga?..ugh...might as well make a stew....No one in Butte would consider these "cornish" pasties...sorry...

We're from the lower peninsula of Michigan and we always look forward to our trips to the UP where we always have pasties. On our last trip, due to certain circumstances, we did not get any pasties. Therefore, we set out to make our own UP pasties.  This recipe was perfect.  I doubled up on the rutabaga and added a little Worcestershire sauce. There is a lot of cutting an dicing to do, but it is worth the effort. These really are as good as we have had in the UP - - if not better.   Now we will be having pasties on a regular basis.

I grew up in Michigan and haven't found anything that compared to a pasty... until now!  What a great recipe, perfect for a chilly fall evening.  I didn't have any beef bouillon on hand so I reduced a can of chicken broth to 1/2 a cup and used that instead.  I also skipped the MSG.  I served a green salad on the side and called it dinner!

I made these exactly according to the recipe and they were very tasty, the pastry was nice and flaky.  I did not find it dry (did those of you who did leave out any vegetables?  They do add moisture).  The only change I would make would be to dice instead of slice the potatoes so that they would be more evenly distributed--I ended up with areas that were all potatoes and no meat.

I'm a college student and am not able to enjoy homecooked food often.  On a day off, I made these pasties for my friends who have never tried them.  They enjoyed them a lot and they were easy to make.  Now I have more requests than I can handle!  They tasted just like they tasted when I was growing up.  The recipe was great.

Made these for Christmas dinner (minus the MSG) at the request of my Roommate from Ironwood Michigan.  He has now named me an official Yooper.  Reminds him of his family's recipe.  I'm quite fond of them myself.  Thank you for the recipe!

I omitted the MSG and I don't care for rutabagas so I used carrots and just ground beef. I put some pats of butter inside for extra flavor and moisture. For just the two of us, I used 1 lb ground beef, 1/2 onion, 1 or 2 carrots sliced, and 2 good sized potatoes sliced or diced small salt and pepper and place in a pie pan put several dots of butter on top and cover with a store bought pie crust. Baked at 375 for 45 minutes and served with extra butter and catsup on top.

I almost hate to do this, but I did change this recipe quite a bit, but I used this one as a base recipe. Here's what I did to simplify it and make my kids happy: used store-bought crust; omitted rutabaga, pork (didn't have any) and MSG.  I was wary of cooking the meat raw in the dough, but I had nothing to worry about. They turned out great. Thanks for the inspiration!

Recently I was reminiscing about amazing Cornish pasties I used to buy from the deli at the local college I attended right out of high school... remembering how amazing they were, so I looked up a recipe here.  Saw several variations, decided to try this one.  I left out the MSG and replaced it with a few shakes of various spices from the cupboard (can't even remember exactly what), and used turnip instead of rutabaga (that's the store had).  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  My first taste was a nervous one, not knowing if I'd be satisfied... but wow, was I satisfied.  Delicious!  After one bite I recalled that I liked a lot of pepper on the pasties I ate in college, so I grabbed the pepper mill and applied a healthy dose.  Fantastic!!  Very similar to what I remember enjoying as a student.  I highly recommend this recipe, delicious!  Great meal on a cold winter night.

The crust is the thing. My father, gone 25 years, found from living in the UP that real home made pasties were often leftovers from supper the night before put into a shell and baked in the morning for a relatively hot meal of whatever was on hand. Hence, recipe???? what recipe??? I find the variations to be great and use the wonderful shell to fill with all kinds of things, like leftover turkey from Thanksgiving. I use a little gravy inside to keep them nice and moist. My grandkids will eat vegetables if inside a pasty so in they go. I also sometimes use Jeruselum Artichokes for a bit of smokey taste in place of part of the potatoes. We have vegetarian friends who add cream cheese to a veggie mix and serve with sour cream and others who claim it is not the same without gravy covering the whole thing. Me, I say whatever you want inside is fine, just DON'T MESS WITH THE CRUST!

SKIP THE MSG!!! You don't need it! This recipe is excellent without the MSG and bouillon (which usually contains MSG as well). I would have rated this 5 stars if it hadn't called for MSG. I cook from scratch to AVOID feeding my family chemicals. Anyway, I otherwise followed the recipe and even my picky teenagers loved them. They're a little time consuming, but well worth it. This makes a huge batch, and my husband is very happy to take the leftovers for lunch tomorrow. I will definately make them again. They brought back memories of our trips to England. :-D

I made this for the first time tonight. Thought I would try it because of all the great reviews and they were right. I did change one thing though, (well 2 things if you count adding the seasonings that others had recommended)  I added yams instead of potatoes and I'm glad I did. Next time I think I'll not only add the chunks of yam but shred some into it also. It adds sweetness and moisture to the filling and yams are more nutritious than potatoes. I recommend if you are using yams that you cut bigger chunks, as yams cook faster than potatoes.

Good basic recipe, though the filling could use a bit more spice. Will try another reviewer's idea of adding Worcestershire sauce. Vegetables came out well done, not too soft and not too crunchy. I like to mix creamy horseradish with ketchup and eat it with the pasty!

I am a Yooper and was pleased with this recipe for pasties. I left out the MSG and probably should have added more salt, they were a bit bland.  I used the leanest pork and beef I could find.  I had a lot of crust left as well, probably would make the crust  thicker next time, or the pasties larger. We eat them with ketchup.I made the dough in my food processor.

Great recipe. Grew up in Northern MN and moved further south and never found a good recipe til now. Pasties have a certain flavor and this is the exact same taste from when I was young. We eat ours with cream of mushroom soup over the top. Being dry is a part of their trademark. Crust was very easy to work with and just needed to make a little extra dough for the leftover filling. Fabulous recipe. Freezer friendly too!

My husband and I both went to college in the Upper Peninsula, and took a great liking to Pasties.  

We've tried to find something similar since we are now all the way out on the West Coast, and have even tried making another recipe in the past...Nothing compared until now!

These pasties are wonderful :)  The only thing my husband and I did with the recipe was to reduce the amount of onion :)  We made them for our neighbors, and they haven't stopped talking about them - lol! :)

Great recipe!

I grew up in Northern Wisconsin and knew people who would drive to the UP just to get the real pasties. 
They were always a hit with my family, but I couldn't find the recipe to let my husband try. These were great. I didn't put MSG in it and I was out of rutabagas, but everything still turned out great. Give yourself some time for this one, it is labor intensive. The results are worth it though. It made a good size batch which I froze when we had eaten our fill.  Hubby is still taking them with him for his lunches. Thanks again!

This was the first time I tried making pasties. I shredded the rutabaga and omitted the MSG. I used seasoned salt instead of plain in the meat mixture. I may try using Worcestershire sauce the next time I make them. I also used the feature to change number of servings and it turned out perfect. I will make them again!!

We have never had a pasty before, so I can't compare to anything.  The pastry was easy and I used my food processor to make it.  I put the dough in the fridge while I prepped the rest.  I didn't have rutebaga so used extra potato and skipped the MSG.  start to finish was approx. 1 hour 45 minutes.  I baked 4 and froze 5.  The quantities were right on target!  I used lean beef and regular pork.  Not greasy or soggy and a nice flavor.  I did add a couple dried herbs and generous salt to the meat.  Definitely will make these again.

So I am Cornish and a Michigander, but planted in North Carolina. I was happy to find this recipe when looking for recipes for "rutabaga." (Of course, my Grandma and Grand Aunts never used anything that fancy during our annual making of the pasties. Just carrots, potatoes, beef, salt, pepper, butter, flour.) All in all, this was a huge crowd-pleaser for our whole family, including small kids. MUST serve with an option of catsup or gravy. (And instead of MSG, I used soy sauce for about 1/2 of the water.)

My dad's from the U.P. and made these for me when I was a kid. These tasted exactly like I remember them. The only thing I omitted was the MSG and this recipe made 12 good sized pasties. I'll making a larger batch next time to freeze.

This is the first time I've ever tried my hand at making these. I thought I would be clever and chop all my veggies in my processor to save time. I don't recommend doing that as the veggie flavors got lost in the ground beef and the texture was too dense. I think this was my fault and not the recipe's. My husband loved these. I was particularly pleased with the pastry. They kept well in the fridge and reheated nicely in the microwave. I liked dipping them in ranch dressing.

I made these over the weekend, omitting the MSG and carrots (I've never seen a pasty with carrots in it, plus I'm not a carrot fan).  To me, these don't taste like Upper Peninsula pasties, but they're tasty and satisfy that pasty craving.  Two reasons I especially liked this recipe are 1.  these aren't greasy like so many UP pasties I've had, and 2. the pastry was nice and crispy (I truly dislike a soggy crust that falls apart).  Next time, I'll use all beef and no pork to see if I get the taste I'm expecting.

I also grew up in the Upper Michigan.  This recipe is a lot like mom's.  Only mom's use sirloin steak cut up in small pieces.  She did not put carrots in it, but I am going to try it.  She used lard for the crust and even put in the fat from the meat.  I did this at first, but now I only use shortening which works just fine.  I trace a plate to make a nice round crust.  Load on the filling, then salt and pepper each one (no msg needed).  I never used water or bouilon, but I could see where the bouillon would give it a little more flavor.  We also always put catsup over the top right before eating them.  Ummmmmmmmm!  Pasties where I lived were a weekly item on the school menu.  Mom was a great cook, so I did not usually take school lunch, only on pastie day.  Make a big batch.  They freeze well and then are a quick meal.

Excellent recipe. Our version does not call for carrots or MSG (We use salt).  My grandmother made these and told me to put a little baking powder in the dough to make it "soft". She never measured it so I just added what I thought was right and they were perfect. I cheated and used southern style frozen hash browns and they turned out just as well as if I peeled a bag of potatoes...only without all of the hard work.

These are a must at my house.  Can definitely do without the MSG.  I bought rutabagas for the first time just for this recipe and have since started using them in other things.  This recipe is correct: no need to cook the meat prior to stuffing.  I add a tsp of thyme for flavor and my family loves it.  I use my food processor to shred and slice the veggies.  I actually make a quadruple recipe at a time for my family of 9 and freeze the cooked pasties once they've cooled.  Wrap in foil for freezing.  Pop the frozen, wrapped pasties in a 350 oven for 30 min; unwrap, place on cookie sheet and continue cooking for another 30 min.  These are the best!  Also great for letting children help roll out the dough because it is a sturdier dough than regular pie pastry.  Enjoy!!

I think these are a 5 star, but my family thought they were to bland. I grew up eating pasties, and these brought back fond memories for me. Tasted just like the ones my mom made for us. I did sub a few things, used packaged refrigerated diced potatoes (country hash browns, the type with only potatoes nothing else) to help cut back on prep time. Omitted the rutabaga (didn't think my family would like it), used pre-made refrigerated pie crust (to cut prep time), cut back on black pepper, mixed granulated bouillon into about 1/4 - 1/3 cup of hot water before adding to filling to help kept it from being too dry, and added a small pat of butter on top of filling before folding and sealing pie crust. Filling was perfectly moist.

Excellent recipe. My whole family(even kids) enjoyed this. I did add about a tablespoon of cumin, 2 T worstershire, 2 t of garlic powder and it came out not at all dry or tasteless. My husband is from MI and he loved it. Make sure to chill the shortening prior as well and the pastry will be so flaky and delicious.

We loved these, it hit the spot for my hubby who is a meat and potato kind of guy.  Plus my picky son loved it! It definitely reminded me of the pasties I used to eat as a kid visiting the U.P. I did not use MSG, gives us headaches too, but instead added Worcestershire sauce which gave it a great flavor.  I used southern cube cut hash browns which worked out perfectly and saved lots of time. Instead of rutabaga, since I had a hard time finding it, I used parsnips which added a very mild sweetness and great flavor.  Also I decided not to put the ground pork in and just used 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef and added extra veggies to make up for it and it was still excellent.

After seeing the rating and reading previous reviews, I was expecting something better tasting. We found them to be pretty bland and dry.Admittedly, I didn't use the MSG as it is a migraine trigger for several of us, but still I expected more from this recipe. This recipe is a good starting point, but I feel it would be greatly improved by seasoning the filling mixture and maybe adding something to make it not so dry. I will try it again, but with those changes.

HI TO ALL THE YOOPERS POSTING REVIEWS! :)
I, too, grew up in the U.P. eating Pasties (YUM!). I've had a recipe almost exactly like this one for years. With mine, I omit the MSG. Boy! I love Pasties!

I converted this recipe to a vegetarian one.  I omitted the meat, reduced 1 cup of veg. broth to 1/2 cup (by the way I really like the wofgang puck because it has no tomato anything nor msg).  I followed the ingredient list for the vegetables.  
Yes, I was left with way too much filling but I'll just save it and make a smaller batch of dough in a few days.
Yes it lacked a little flavor and I guess that the beef broth and ground gave it that special flavor.  However as bland as it was it was still very enjoyable to eat.  Next time I'll add some herbs and maybe something that makes it creamier.  Whatever;  if you go vegetarian it'll need a little flavoring but it was very good with the ketchup dunking.  It will definitely become a home classic that will probably have several permutations.

Not a native yooper but have lived here for the last 5 years. This recipe is pretty identical to what I've tasted around here. In fact, it tastes better than what you get some of the resturants around here. Gravy or ketchup would help if it's too dry. Yes, there's definitely more filling that dough. And it does takes a whole morning to make. I didn't change a thing in the receipe. But a word of warning, this is not for the faint of heart... espcially if you're prone to heart attacks. A tad on the fatty side imo.

these were ok.....the pasty did not seem to hold together.  I had lots of leftover filling...so I just fried it up and served it inside a flour tortilla...that was much better.  But it was fun makeing the pasty once...we even put my kids initials on them the way the miners wives used too...don't forget to put a little bit of jam or apple butter in one end with a little pasty partition...makes for a nice dessert surprise at the end.

These came out really good.  I adjusted the recipe for 4 servings and made the pasties a little smaller.  There was still a lot of filling leftover, so I would double the crust recipe next time and use the same amount of filling.  I left out the 2T of extra water in the 4 serving recipe for the dough and it was plenty sticky.  I also froze the shortening for a while and kept the dough in the fridge while I made the filling.  The crust is really flaky. I maybe would add a little more onion and rutabaga next time as I could barely taste the rutabaga. Also maybe more carrot and a little more broth.  Overall, excellent recipe!

Both hubby and I really liked these. We're from Michigan and always crave these since we moved away. Had no idea they are so easy to make. These are spot on. Somehow I ended up with way too many potatoes though so next time Ill reduce those and maybe add a bit more salt to the meat.

Great recipe!  I am now pestered on a regular basis to make pasties!  I use beef suet from my butcher for the crust because that's the way I was taught by my husband's Cornish grandmother.  Otherwise, I follow this exactly.  A+!

Fantastic flavor better than any I have had in the "upper." Born and raised in Michigan this recipe is best by far!! I failed on the crust however not sure what my mistake was ended up runny added flour to fix but the dough came out tough..... I guess I screwed up somewhere???Will try to make another dough recipe.

I learned to make this from my Mom and generations before her.  I dont usually use pork, but I like to use cube of beef and not ground beef, I like skirt or flank steak.  One time I did not have enough potatoes and tried using some yams (which I healthier for you anyway) and it was really great.  I used some white potatoes and added yams.  I also dont use MGG but if you can get some montrial steak seasoning it really picks up the flavors.  I also find a brush of water or spray of a vegtable oil spray on the crust makes it really nice and brown for the crust.

Fist let me say that though I live in Michigan I have never had a true pasty from the UP, only the ones in southeastern Michigan. To me, these are AWESOME! I only changed a few things, but I am positive they would be perfect if you followed the directions to a tee. I made the dough exactly as it is except added the salt as another review suggested. I used diced potatoes and carrots, had no rutebaga or msg on hand, I added a can of sweet peas, cooked the meat slightly to drain excess fat and added pepper, basil and parsley for flavor. Sauteed the onions with a couple gloves of garlic and the seasonings to soften. Also used a egg white wash for top. Came out perfect after 50 mins at 425 f.

I have been brought up on Cornish pasties, and why I think these are not the same, they are not a million miles away.  I did think the inside was a little dry, and next time I may add a few peas.  I will make this recipe again but I think I will have a play around with it and see if it can be improved.

I thought this was the most complete recipe. I have lived in Michigan my whole live and don't ever recall a Pasty having sliced potatoes and shredded carrots so I didn't think mine should either. I doubled the amount of rutabaga, used 5 carrots diced instead of the 2 shredded, and about 5-1/2 cups of diced potatoes. My slapchop made that part easy. I put them on the pan as instructed. Evidently I didn't have every one sealed completely, because the juices came out, burned on the pan, and set off the smoke detectors. I pulled the two trays out at 30 minutes, then I wrapped each one in aluminum foil, placed them on a new tray and cooked at 350 for the last 12 minutes. YUM! They weren't dry at all. Basing this meal on a family of 3, they sure were filling. I ended up with 9 pasties so I will have 6 to freeze. I would recommend this recipe, but make sure the pasties are SEALED completely. The grease will burn to the pan and smoke out your house.

I used only ground lean beef (no pork), frozen hashbrowns (that we thawed prior to using) and frozen onions and carrots that I had in the freezer (already chopped/grated), added some worcestershire and didn't use any msg and they came out very good and very close to the Lawry's that we get up in Marquette when we go to the U.P.  Had to make more of the pastry though as I ran out before all the filler had been used up.  The extras that we didn't eat went into the freezer for a quick meal in the future.  Thanks!

My mother-in-law is a Finn from upper Michigan where pasties are practically an art form, so I had big shoes to fill! I decided on this recipe for my first attempt and they turned out GREAT!! I substituted onion powder for the chopped onions and omitted the MSG (allergies). The only snag that I ran into was due to the size of the dough rectangles. In my opinion, 6"x8" is too small and made for difficult sealing. I ended up making larger but fewer pasties than the recipe called for.

They freeze beautifully! I just cooked 'em, cooled 'em, threw 'em into Ziploc baggies and tossed them in the freezer. This recipe is a definite keeper!! (Btw, my husband informs me that the only proper way to eat a pasty is with ketchup. He HATES it when my son and I use BBQ sauce!)

I have made these for my Inlaws once while they were here on a visit and now they request them everytime they come. Everyone I have made them for has loved them even the kids. I haven't tryed freezing them yet because everytime I make them they are gone.  I don't know if I should freeze them before or after cooking.

This is the first time that I prepared the recipe and found it very easy to use.  I used venison instead of beef and omitted the MSG.  I got rave reviews from all who tried them and believe me, this will be a "keeper" in my recipe file!

We love Michigan (yooper) pasties.  They are flavorful and easy to make.  We use prepared pie crusts (store brands seem to work better).  I make a big batch and freeze them later to be reheated in rv's convection oven on our trips.  Also good after working outside in the cool fall air.  Simple. tasty. comfort food.  The mines may be gone from the UP but the Pasties will live forever

I modified this recipe a tad to what I grew up on in MN. The dough makes about 5 pasties and I had extra veggies. I made another batch of dough. I mixed in the meat with the veggies so it is more blended. I also added extra pepper, salt, splash of soy sauce, 2 cloves pressed garlic, and a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce to the veggie/meat mixture. Baked on 375 for 1 hour and 20 minutes with 5 minutes to cool down. It must be eaten with ketchup!

Made recipe as is besides the addition of more rutabaga. They turned out perfect! I put an egg white wash and sprinkled some coarse salt on before baking, crust came out beautifully golden. My husband loves pasties and said these are the best he's had! I served with brown gravy and sour cream, perfect! Neighbor already asked for the recipe too!:)

Really good. Sadly I could not find the rutabaga so I had to leave it out. I also left out the MSG and added worcestershire sauce instead. I couldnt find ground pork either so I substitued it with a little bit of pork sausage. The spices in the sausage actually made it better. Thanks!

Liked this - reminded me of Aarne's Bakery in Detroit in the 1940's
I tried various potatoes; I liked redskins the best but found them a bit hard after cooking.  Ended up with 3 cups coarse-dice Idaho russets, 2 cups medium parboiled redskins, and 1 cup sweet purple-top turnips (and no swedes).
Try using a big Vidalia or Maui onion.  Mmmm!
And absolutely no @#$% MSG!
Finally, I add a small piece of beef liver (frozen then chopped) with the meats. 
Hyvää ruokahalua!

SO delicious!  I had some left over refrigerated pie crust that I used and I also had some extra puff pastry in my freezer.  It was excellent with both.  I had extra that I froze too and that was an easy, delicious meal I could pull out of the freezer - VERY good!

Great recipe, and easy to make healthier, too! I did not use MSG, but used 1/2 a natural Not-Beef bouillon cube in the 1/2 cup hot water. I also used 2 lb of local grass-fed beef and added about 3 cloves crushed garlic. I didn't have rutabaga- so skipped that. I was able to make 12 pasties, with about 2c left over filling that we just sauteed in a skillet for leftovers. I have a large family, and these were all eaten up in one meal, no complaints from the children! Try this one- you'll like it!

I was born and raised in Michigan and live in Texas.  I was really wanting a pastie and found this recipe.  It was AWESOME!  Everyone loved it and even went back for seconds.  Some people said they were dry, I like beef gravy over the top of mine and others used ketchup.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I grew up in northern Michigan and have childhood memories of fresh pasties at "Poor Boy's" in the UP. These were very close to what I remember. I didn't have a lot of time for dinner prep, so I used pre-made pie crusts (Pillsbury) and re-rolled them for pasties instead of making the dough from scratch. That shortcut made this a realistic weeknight dinner. My 4 year old loved playing "lumberjack" and devoured his dinner.

Amazingly yummy and easy to make.  I'm gonna make another batch tomorrow to keep in the freezer!  I did omit the MSG, went 50/50 on beef and pork, and used more rhutabaga.

I used to eat pasties every year when we would ski in the UP of Michigan.  I thought I would try to make them myself and this recipe was amazing.  It came out great!  I used less potatoes, more rutabaga and pork...it turned out well.  Anyone that wants the real deal Michigan pasty needs to try this recipe!

These are just like Grandma Stimaki's! I made these for the guys at the fire house and they loved them. I used the calculator to double the recipe and it worked great. The only bad thing about this recipe is that now I have to make them for the guys every other Sunday!

I'm also from the UP and have made a similiar recipe to this one for almost 30 years now.  I use cut up round steak and they are never dry because I always make a mushroom sauce to pour over the pasties.  I agree with using less potatoes and more rutabagas.

These were awesome! They had a wonderful flavor and I did not find mine dry;however, I used 85/15 ground chuck and no pork. I also used white pepper instead of black and threw in the worsterchire sauce as someone else advised.The only thing I would recommend is to double the amount of dough for the crust. I ran short for the amount of filling I had. Otherwise I am very happy with how they turned out! Great recipe!

These are very tasty. Instead of MSG I used a couple shakes of Worcestershire sauce; plenty of savory flavor! Never made them before and had filling and a little dough left so I made a pastie pie in an 8" dish (just the top crust). Perfect for the chilly weather.

Used very lean beef and pork, but turned out way greasy, making the bottoms soggy.  Filling had no real flavor.  Proportion of dough to filling is also incorrect as others had pointed out.

I'm another Michigander that loves this recipe.  
I usually sub parsnips for the rutabagas because I like them better and use stock instead of the bouillon and water.  I have trouble getting a full 1 1/2 cups in each pasty and so I usually have filling left over, which I bake in a dish and eat plain.

Good recipe. But being from Michigan I use chopped beef stew and Pork instead of ground and I leave out the MSG and Bullion for a Recipie Like my grandmother showed me... Healtier too, not as much sodium... Don't forget to serve with Dill Pickle and ketchup. The copper miners of the calumet area would be proud.

This is a great recipe.   I've made it at least three times in one month.  It is an amazing option for everyone to have a different type of lunch without having to worry about heating things up or stuff leaking out.   

I divide one batch of dough into fourths.  Roll each out and divide it into at least 6 .  So at minimum we end up with 24 yummy little hand pies - good for lunches for the week usually if they alternate with other options.    They are surprisingly filling even in small sizes.  

TIPS:   
The key to not leaking is low fluids and small amounts.  Don't overfill the pies and don't add too much liquid.  We pack dipping sauces in small containers and that takes care of any dryness issues.  

Do use water to moisten the edges when you pinch them together.  Also poke holes in the top.  Make sure to seal the edges by crimping them or folding.   

Do try other fillings!   I know they aren't traditional, but we love pepperoni pizza type fillings, and/or rotisserie chicken/cheese/potato/onion.   It's nice to have a change for lunches.   Add seasonings or a tiny bit of cheese to the dough - or brush with olive oil.   

Our sandwich bread went bad because everyone was taking these for lunches!   Great recipe and very versatile!

I’m a Michigan girl, so grew up with these treats. I use an alternate crust found on all recipes and used ground sirloin. My California family loved these and wanted more!

I had a lot of extra filling so I fried it all up and made a soup with it. With my small family I think I'll cut the filling recipe in half

It was OK.  I grew kohlrabi so I used that instead of  turnip or whatever.  I wasn't  convinced that raw meat and potatoes would actually  cook in the oven, so I precooked it in a frying pan.  I had a hard time keeping the pastry from tearing and leaking, and not impressed with the crust which was too much like a pie. And, it didn't have much flavor.  I think I'll stick with sausage bread, which has a yeast dough , cheese and seasonings. 
Strangely, I've been to the U.P. many times, and never had a pastie.

I have relatives in Northern Michigan and have had a lot of pasties in my day.  Several restaurants make delicious pasties while others are too dry with awful crusts.  Anyhow, this recipe is decent. Unfortunately,  I did not have any rutabegas so I substituted a turnip.  I also used my own butter crust recipe instead of this one.  My entire family absolutely loved them!  They were very moist and tasty inside and the crust was fantastic.

These were great. I beef instead of pork and omitted the rutabaga and msg, added some gravy to keep it moist. Boom. Pretty good.

Really delicious! Made them for a family picnic and everyone (except the 2 year old!) loved them. Way harder to make than I thought it would be but then again I'm recovering from cancer and don't have a lot of energy in the first place!

I have eaten many pasties as I have lived in the UP for many years.  I made this recipe.  not flavorful.  crust was dry along with mixture inside.  baked at 425 for 40 minutes and if cooked any longer would be inedible.

This was a great recipe guide when I decided I wanted to make pasties after enjoying them in the UP!  I quartered the recipe so that I'd only make 2 which worked well.  I used all ground turkey for meat which worked.  I omitted the MSG because of its bad rap, but as a result, felt like it needed more seasoning.  I will definitely make these again, though I might just go buy that MSG!

Not enough rutabaga for the potatoes called for.  When I make pasties, I usually use equal amounts of rutabaga and potato.   Also make a small amount of gravy when I brown the meat so that the filling is not so dry.

Marrying into a Finnish family, I got introduced to these 32 years ago, I to thought they were dry and boring. So when I started making them myself, I added a little cream cheese to my dough, and I blended Campbell's Chunky Sirloin burger soup and added a tablespoon of the mix in each meat pie before closing. This recipe had the perfect balance of veggies to meat that I have seen so far.

I have eaten both Cornish, Finnish and Michigan's Copper Country style  made by my Finnish and Cornish grandmothers. The recipe here is pretty darn good but I suggest adding is 3 pats of butter laid out on top  of the meat and root crop vegitables. Your pastys need to be hot and leaky.so they won't be bland and make sure there is enough salt and pepper. Some eat them with gravy but I like em with ketchup.......

These are definitely more labor intensive to make, but very worth it. I made a double batch and froze (in foil) all but enough for one night's dinner. Now I have sandwiches to take to games, work, etc. Very convenient.

Remember that pasty can certainly be made to your family's particular taste.  We use pork tenderloin sometimes, and always use Pillsbury crust.  This is great, great recipe.  Keep in mind that most of the salt should be added AFTER the baking by the individual eating the pasty.  And those of you putting ketchup on these have no soul.....yes, I'm having a little fun at your expense!

I've used this recipe 5 or 6 times and have to say they're a success in my house. I use premade pie crusts, which are unauthentic as heck but convenient. I also changed the ratio of ground beef and pork to 1 pound each. I think it makes for a moister pastie. I omit the MSG and also add about a tablespoon of A-1 sauce. Admittedly, they're not as good as those made by the fine ladies at the Gwinn VFW, but they're pretty darned close.

Very authentic on the crust, but I never heard of the MSG or beef bouillion/broth, but I think I might try it with the broth some time, and maybe even a little worcestershire sauce as some have mentioned.  Another good tip (if you are saving some in the freezer for another time) is to half-bake them, then cool and wrap to freeze.  They come better this way.  Thaw and bake, or just bake them from the frozen state(takes awhile).  Thanks for posting your recipe!

Better than I expected. I used more rutabaga and less potato (and only sweet potatoes), left out the carrots and pork, added 1-2T Worcestshire sauce, coated them in egg whites, and they were still good. Which made me think you could put almost anything in this crust and it would be a fun/easy hand-held meal. I'll definitely make again with whatever I have in the fridge.

These are delicious!  I would have given them five stars but I did make a few changes.  I add worcertshire sauce per other reviewer's suggestions and the taste was great.  I think it would have been a tad bland without it.  I also used only beef (couldn't find ground pork at our supermarket).  I ended up using 80% lean ground beef to make sure it stayed moist since a number of reviewers said it was dry.  I also left out the carrots simply because I forgot to buy them.  We made a double batch of the filling.  We ended up making three batches of the dough and still had filling left over.  My husband loved them.  He says that they taste just like the pasties he used to eat when visiting his aunt in the UP.  Thanks for the great recipe!

So good the wife is worried about her turn to cook. Can't wait to play with the recipe. Just like deer hunting in the yoop.

We saw Cornish pasties recently on TV and, living in TX, had to make them in order to try. Never cooked or eaten rutabaga, I followed the advice and doubled the amount. Pasties weren’t dry at all and I used lean meat and no butter. Make sure to add the bullion into the mixture. I let the mixture sit in a fridge for a few minutes and veggies released some more juice.  I will be making them again with leftover Thanksgiving turkey.

We thought these were good for something different.  The dough turned out good and that's always a good thing and instead of slicing the potatoes, I cubed them as I did with all the veggies about the same size so they would all cook at the same time. Did not have or use the MSG. I was leary about not browning the meat first but had faith and it worked out fine. I did have too much filling for the dough ratio so I made a few small pasties then made one big one in a baking pan by putting down a layer of dough on the bottom, filling with the filling and topping with dough. I brushed all with cream. While I was not expecting them to be super savory as the reviews kept saying they were pretty good.  My husband enjoyed his very much and took some to work the next day. When I heated some up for lunch the next day, I wasn't impressed, I thought they lacked a lot on day two. A nice different touch though for a change up in the weeknight menu!

It was dry as everyone else has related.  I even made some gravy.  Way way way wayyyyy too much filling for the pastry.  My non-Finnish mother makes them much better, even shaming my full-blooded Finnish aunt.

Tastes just like a pasty!  I used ground round in the recipe and the filling was too dry and packed together like a hamburger.  That's not what I was aiming for, so I added another 1/2 cup of bouillon to the rest of the filling, which worked out fine.  Also, I got way more than 8 pasties out of this recipe!

This recipe was delicious and they reminded me of our vacations in northern Michigan!  Excellent!
