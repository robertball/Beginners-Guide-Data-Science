I was born, raised and still living in the Philippines. I know there are several regional versions of adobo here but I never heard of any with catsup in it. Some of your reviewers were right. It's also too salty. You may do away with the salt. The ratio of vinegar to soy should be 1/2 cup vinegar to 1/4 cup Filipino soy (the Silver Swan brand being the best, if you can get it Stateside). Also, I find the bay leaves  too overpowering,1 or 2 would do. Whole peppercorns are usually used and adding pork liver (cut into 1 inch x 2 inch pices)  provides a richer and thicker sauce. I usually add more garlic than suggested. Traditionally, adobo does not have vegetables added to the meat.  Vegetables are  side dishes to compliment it.

The recipe is somewhat incomplete.There is no ketchup is this original dish and you need to use filipino soy sause which is much lower in salt than chinese soy. There is a packet of seasoning for pork adobo at your local asian store made for this dish. cj

I gave this rating with my modifications.  This receipe was very easy and tasted just the way my grandmother used to make it after I made some changes.   1st of all forget the Catsup that is just not part of Adobo.   2nd I used low salt soy and decreased it to 1/2 a cup.  You can always add it is hard to take away.   When I made it the first time with all the soy it was just way to salty.   The last thing I did was add potatoes about 30 minutes before it was done.  I did not use the string beings.

I thought I would try it as I grew up with Pork Adobe and was looking for an easy recipe. However, the ketchup ruined it for me.

I followed the recipe except that I used a little less pork than was called for. We couldn't even eat the pork because it was so incredibly salty! I didn't add any salt, so it was just the soy sauce I used. B/c the other 2 reviews didn't mention the saltiness, I wonder if it is the type of soy sauce I used (an authentic Chinese brand). I'm giving this 2 stars and not 1 star, thinking that the recipe might have good potential if not for the soy sauce I used that made it 10 times too salty to eat!

I reduced the soy sauce because of other reviews saying it was too much. My husband says it tasted just like the adobo he grew up eating.

Does the recipe call for tomato ketchup or the Filipino banana-based ketchup?  I don't particularly care for the tomato in this dish.  Also, too much vinegar and soy in this recipe for my tastes.  I'd prefer 1/2 c vinegar and 1/4 c soy.

My husband raved when I made this. I used lean pork sirlion and added onion. I didn't have enough soy sauce so I only put in 3/4 cup. But otherwise I followed the directions exactly. Great recipe. I served it with basmati rice and a green salad.

We really love this pork adobo. I add ground ginger to mine and then thicken the sauce at the end with a bit of flour before serving over rice. It has become a regular in the dinner rotation. My two year old just loves it.

This actually turned out pretty good for me, with a few modifications.  I left out the ketchup because that just doesn't sound appealing to me.  I used low sodium soy sauce, distilled white vinegar, and a little bit of rice vinegar to add some sweetness.  I used whole peppercorns instead of ground black pepper.  After simmering the pork I fried it in a little bit of olive oil (as is traditionally how it's done) allowing the sauce to reduce and thicken a bit.  I left out the green beans as well.....didn't seem like it went well.

This recipe was good, but it ended up tasting really salty, I'm not sure if that was because it only took 1 hour to cook instead of 2 1/2 hours.  After one hour on the stove on low, all of the liquid was gone and it started to burn.

This must be another variation of the recipe.  Original Filipino adobo doesnt have ketchup as one of the ingredients.And too much vinegar, this is only to hint a tangy taste and not to dominate the flacor od the dish

The soy sauce was too much!  I thought the ketchup made it taste weird.   I would probably use only 1/4 of a cup of soy sauce.  1/4 cup of water.  Garlic would make this dish smell awesome!

Ditto on removing the ketchup. And also agree and modified to 1/2 c vinegar 1/4 c soya sauce. And lastly, also omitted the veggie. Attached a photo. Will serve on a bed of white jasmine and quinoa rice made with cumin seeds and sesame oil. Came out perfect!

Actually I have made adobo with ketchup and it is masurup. (Delicious) My wife who was filipina liked it and also asked what I put in it and I told her "Secret" only filipinos will get that one but anyway this is a very good recipe for some good adobo. Don't knock it before you try it.

Not bad overall. Found it to be a little on the sweet side, although that may be how it is meant to taste. Would cut back on the ketchup a little if making again.

Made as directed, although I did add potatoes. I didn’t mind the bit of ketchup & I knew the soy sauce would be too strong, so I diluted it with water, but the worst part was the vinegar—waay too strong!  I had to rinse everything  through a sieve so we could eat it, & even at that the potatoes were still tangy.

I was born and raised on Filipino food and thought that this recipe was a little "different" but tried it anyway.  I'm sorry to say that this is not authentic adobo.  I usually try and say something positive when writing reviews but with all the time, money and effort that I put into this recipe I'm sorry to say that this one should be removed from the site.
