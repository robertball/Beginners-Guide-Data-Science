These were really good!  I made some of the muffins plain, some with dried cranberries (I didn't have fresh ones) and some with dried blueberries.  My husband and I both liked the ones with the dried blueberries the best. I used 3 tbs. of lemon juice because that was the amount in one whole lemon and I didn't want to waste it.  I also added wheat germ instead of ground flax seed.  This made 18 muffins for me.

These are so soft and moist, it's hard to believe they are whole wheat.  I made these twice already, and made 6 large muffins instead of 12 small ones.  Didn't change anything in recipe.   Since they are so soft, these were hard to get out of the pan the first time (I don't use paper liners), but the second time I buttered and floured the pan first and they came out of the pan easier (see my pic of 6 large muffins).

I followed this recipe exactly as written except I didn't have applesauce so I boiled some chopped up apples with a little water and mashed it to make my own. Since it was a little lumpier it actually left chunks of apple in the muffins which was great. I also added sliced almonds and it turned out great!!! Delicious and healthy!

My family and I loved it.  I added extra lemon juice, lemon zest.  Multiply the recipe x4 for the Bosch and put in 5 bread pans.  Added a little extra oil as well.  Baked as a bread as I didn't have time for muffin dolloping.  350 for 50ish minutes.

So delish!!! Very excited to have a new go-to muffin recipe!  Substituted whole flax seed for ground. Used egg whites. Little bit extra apple sauce (1.5c for 2x recipe) doubled the lemon juice (2 lemons for 2x recipe) and added 1 lemon rind (could use 2 next time), used half brown half white sugar (could try using slightly less sugar next time) skim milk and 1/2 the oil. Reserved 3 tbsp of flour and tossed about 3 cups of frozen blueberries in it (instead of cranberries). 2X recipe made 76 mini muffins. Seems like a lot of mods, but this is standard for me :-)

Altered recipe to 
1-1/2 whole wheat flour
1/2 C honey (do not like to use white sugar)
1/3 C flax seed
1/2 C whole oats
1/3 C applesauce 
3/4 C chopped walnuts
chopped cranberries in food processor
increased lemon juice to 4 tablespoons.
All else the same.
We love them!

Light and moist, but lacked flavor.  I recommend adding zest of one lemon and using all the juice (3 tbsp?) from one lemon.  More of the flavor comes out, especially in the cranberries, if you microwave the muffin for 12 seconds before serving.

I do like this recipe because it is easy.  When followed exactly, I didn't think it was sweet enough for me.  I also didn't like the texture of the cranberries so much.  I tried it again replacing the fresh cranberries with a can of "Woodstock Organic Whole Cranberry Sauce" and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup.  I made my own applesauce unsweetened from pink lady apples and added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the 1/2 cup of applesauce. Much better for the sweet-tooth I am.  I will make it again like this.

They’re OK, but not amazing, but probably because they may not have as much sugar and oil as other recipes.  Used more cranberries than what the recipe stated and didn’t bother to cut them in half as directed.

I made these for the community Mother's Day breakfast.  Took note of a few of the comments and tossed the cranberries in a little extra sugar and added the zest  as well as the juice of fresh lemons.  Very nice to have a recipe (other than smoothies) to use ground flax seed in although it never hurts to toss it into any muffin recipe.
I did make a double batch so can have some at home for myself as well.  I am sure they will freeze well too.
Very tasty!  Thank you.

I made this last week and I'm not sure if I did something wrong because me and my husband did not really care for these at all. I felt they didn't have much flavor and neither one of us like the consistency of the muffins.

I've used this recipe as a base and made many variations. In all my versions, I've doubled (at least) the applesauce and subbed the flax for chia seeds. I also leave out the lemon juice if it doesn't go well with the fruit I choose. Ex: banana nut, or chocolate chip. The batter is good, but might have more flavor if you use sweetened applesauce, or even just add honey! I've never been good at baking, but these come out perfect every time!

I followed the recipe except I added the zest of two lemons. I will be making these regularly as an easy & healthy breakfast on the go for myself & my family. Great freezer to microwave/toaster oven. It is hard to believe they are low fat & whole wheat. These muffins are moist & rise beautifully. I am going to use this recipe as a base for other muffins like banana. Thanks for sharing this recipe, its fantastic.

Delicious and moist! I was worried about the tartness of the cranberries - I used frozen cranberries which I halved and added two tablespoons of sugar and set aside while making the batter. I followed everything else exactly!

Both hearty and delicious.  I used both blueberries and cranberries and loved the result.  The lemon flavor wasn't very strong, though - next time I may add some lemon zest along with the lemon juice.

Halved the recipe and made mini muffins. While they rose beautifully ( prettiest muffins I made!!), so easy to make  and were really soft and bouncy, I do agree with some of the other reviewers, they lack flavor.

I make these almost every month.  Love them, not too sweet, just right.
Thanks for the recipe!
