I tweaked this recipe quite a bit, I halved it, used canned chicken, one can of cream of chicken instead of mushroom, thinned it with about 1 1/2 cups of milk, used seasoning salt and some garlic instead of poultry seasoning, and served on toasted bread.  If you made it this far, it was really good! :)  My kids asked for seconds.

My family loves this recipe.  I use skinless, boneless chicken breast and cream of chicken and cream of celery instead of mushroom.  It is a real winner at my house. Im making it for my sons graduation next week.

This was great! I didn't have the exact ingredients on hand so I used a 3 pound can of cooked chicken, two cans of cream of chicken soup, a capfull of Mrs. Dash seasoning and the Ritz crackers. It was so fast and easy and everybody loved it! Thanks for the recipe!

This IS an Ohio thing. I grew up on these sandwiches in the Newark area. Not all of Ohio has them. I didn't realize until after moveing around the country it is ONLY a central Ohio thing so I make these for my family. I do add garlic and onion powder with salt and pepper. Not ment to have a lot of spice flavor, just a good chicken flavor. Some places made theirs creamy (more soup, less crackers) others with less soup and crackers, less creamy.

Delicious! For all the "anti-mushy" folks: shredded chicken sandwiches are *supposed* to be mushy.

My family was not impressed with this recipe at all. It was too mushy. I would add more chicken and less crackers. Taste was also kind of bland.

For those who think it is too bland try adding a  10 oz bag of crushed sour cream and onion chips...if its too mushy try adding more cracker or bread crumbs....a little poutry seasoning will help kick it up too!

The ladies in the nearby church add dressing (like stovetop) to give the sandwiches more flavor and less mushiness.  They also sauteed chopped onions in lite butter to add to the recipe.

I made these and they were OK but kind of bland. I tweaked it next time I made it. So 3 stars for original but 5 stars for tweaking. I slow cooked 3 skinless chicken breasts all day in crock pot with chicken broth,garlic powder,& onion powder. Drained about 2 cups broth in cup set aside. Shredded chicken added one can cream of chicken and one cream of mushroom. Added cup of milk. Put some stuffing mix in baggy and rolled rolling pin over it to smash. Added them....mixed all together then added chicken broth to make it moist!!!! YUMMY!!!!!

What a quick, tasty recipe! I used cream of chicken instead of mushroom soup and added some garlic salt, and then served on toasted hoagies. The mushy appearance didn't bother my husband or I. This chicken has a great flavor and is very quick and easy to prepare!

This is a great REGIONAL recipe from the Ohio area. I came on this sight in search of the traditional Ohio Shredded Chicken sandwich. And happily I found one. So thank you for the great recipe. This is a regional food that is very popular in Ohio and some surrounding areas. It's meant to be a yummy sloppy shredded chicken and gravy sandwich.

A new trick I have recently learned about making these type of chicken sandwiches, whether cooking the chicken myself or opting for the canned chicken, is try substituting condensed chicken noodle soup in lieu of the 'cream' soups.  I was a real skeptic when it was suggested to try this.  But, honest to goodness, it is much better than the cream soups and you don't realize there are noodles in it.  I know it sounds weird, but it does really improve the chickeny flavor tremendously.

I love these sandwiches, but then, i am from central Ohio. I grew up on these things at celebration parties, and fairs. My husband, on the other hand,  does not like these, but he is not from the area. It is totally a regional thing. I think the odd texture throws people off who are not familiar with them. This is always the first thing I make when my husband goes out of town, my kids like them too. I use some stuffing mix instead of crackers.

Great basic recipe. I grew up with these from Dairy Queen in Bowling Green, Ohio. (Thank ya, Chip)I don't know their recipe. After reading reviews I tried it again. I started with 4 lbs bone in thighs in my 6 qt crock pot at noon on low. Kicked it up to high @ 2PM until 5:30PM. I let it cool in a colander reserving all the broth in a 2 cup measuring cup (about 2 1/4 cups). I shredded it as fine as I could and put in back in the crock pot. Added: 1 can of cream of chicken soup,1 can of undrained chicken noodle soup, the broth. I don't really measure stuff, but added about 3 TBSP McCormick Grill Mates Montreal Chicken seasoning,1 1/2 TBSP garlic powder, 1 TBSP onion powder. A sleeve of crushed Ritz crackers. Mixed well and warmed it on low for a couple hours. Everyone said it was awesome. I live in Phoenix, AZ. No one had ever had it before except me. I was even impressed with the taste. With 2 packs of hamburger buns ($0.89 ea)and the chicken on sale cost of $0.87 per lb I figure I spent about under ten bucks for 12 - 14 sandwiches. The mixture turned out moist but firm too. It didn't soak the buns. It could also be used as a dip with tortilla chips or the Ritz crackers served in soup bowls? Hmmm..?
NOTE: To make shredding the chicken and mixing it all up quick and easy put the boneless skinless chicken back in the crock pot and shred with an electric mixer on lowest setting. Add everything else and mix with the mixer.

I am from Ohio and I can agree that this recipe is also a Ohio recipe. It was awesome! I use the soft honey buns from Nickels bakery to make these. Also they have these sandwiches in most drive ins in Ohio. I think best I have tasted are at a drive in called Fred's rootbeer stand in Canton, Ohio. This recipe taste just as good. I would not change a thing to this recipe.   (Maybe ad a sandwich pickle to the bun). Lol!    Mmmmmmmm good!

I grew up with Shredded Chicken Sandwiches.  So good.  I've always used crushed potato chips or herb flavored stuffing mix instead of the crackers.  I also don't remember it needing any seasoning.

I used 2 cans of the chicken and 2 cans of cream of chicken soup and 2 sleeves of the ritz crackers.  I also added seasoned salt and pepper (just added to the crockpot).  Took this to a take-in at work and everyone raved about it.  Making it again tomorrow for another take-in.  Great recipe!

This recipe was really good!  I would have never thought to add stuffing the the chicken. I did it a little different though, I used Kraft stove top boxed turkey stuffing and it gave the chicken sandwiches so much flavor. I used turkey stuffing because its what I had already but im sure that if i had used chicken stuffing it may have tasted good too!

Wonderful!! I cut it in half, used left over chicken from the crock pot chicken on this site and cream of chicken because it's what I had. Seasoned with a little lowrys and garlic powder and thinned with a splash of milk. Served it on toasted hoagies and it was gone in a blink! I'll be making this again and soon!

I was quite excited to try this recipe...but I have to be honest...it was so so.  It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great either.

Quite bland and I wish I had read the review about adding sour cream and onion chips instead of crackers...that might have made it better.

Brought this for a potluck at work and everyone loved it. I used one can regular cream of mushroom soup and one can cream of mushroom with herb and garlic which adds the flavors that some might find missing. Quick and easy recipe.

Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. My family loved this recipe. It's so easy to make, takes few ingredients and is super fast to make. We have made it a few times and this can be "doctored" to your own specific taste. We don't normally have poultry seasoning on hand, so after the initial making of it, we boiled our chicken in chicken broth and garlic and added salt and pepper. It was good! We love the Ritz crackers in it, giving it a nice buttery taste. We will continue to make this over and over.

I've made these sanwiches for two separate crowds (baby shower and meeting at work) and everyone loves it!  Even the fussy eaters in my life love it!  My only change is to add chopped celery, which most say "makes it".  I put it all in my crockpot and warm it up and voila! A crowd pleaser!  I normally double it for 20 or more people.

This is Ohio comfort food at its best. In my experience, only Ohioans that have had this at every family function and the local Dairy Maid fully alleviate this recipe. Other people find it a bit bland.

I have found that you can use 48 ounces of canned chicken; I rinsed the chicken before use. I have also switched up between cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soup. This is a very versatile recipe.

This recipe came out GREAT!  Just like I remembered from childhood.  The whole family loved it.  Only thing I did differently (because of my work schedule) was add 1.25 lbs boneless things and 1.25 lbs boneless breasts, uncooked, into the crockpot with the soup and seasoning.  Cooked it on low for 6 hours.  The chicken was perfect.  I added the crackers at the end (because I had to buy them on the way home from work).  Just wonderful!  Would be just as good without the crackers to be honest!!

Very easy! I was short on time for dinner and found this recipe. It whipped up in minutes. I used canned chicken. I didn't have enough Ritz crackers on hand so I used saltines and added light butter. I also added about 1 cup of chicken broth to thin it out. I like chicken sandwiches MUSHY (and runnier) and this was perfect. My picky 2-year-old daughter loved it too.

Fantastic "basic" recipe to start off with! Here's what I did different: I used a rotisserie chicken for 1/2 of the chicken supply which added a lot of extra flavor. I also used bbq chips for 1/2 of the cracker supply, then natural wheat crackers for the rest. Turned out DELICIOUS and I never would've tried it without inspiration from this recipe. Thanks!

All I had on hand was honey dijon chicken breasts (boneless/skinless) and I think that threw the taste off a little.  My husband hates mushrooms so I used cream of chicken/celery soup.  I thought the texture was fine - similar to chicken salad.  I did add sliced red onion on my sandwich for some crunch.  Will try again with plain chicken.

This was a great recipe! I used about 4lbs of bone in chicken breast boiled then deboned and shredded. I left it in bigger pieces kinda like you would for pulled pork. I added a little extra pultry seasoning and lots of pepper. Very yummy and not mushy at all. Really fast and easy to make.

Have used this recipe for years.  Easy to make and to tweak.  If it's too "mushy" as some have said, try serving it over mashed potatoes instead of as a sandwich.  You can also try adding more crushed crackers to help thicken it.  Great for club potlucks!

Really liked this but added a little chopped onion and some celery flakes...make this as a chicken casserole with bread crumbs or potato chips on top or a little shredded cheese at the last minute....very good this way...shredded chicken casserole...350 degrees for about 20 minutes...it will get light brown on top and a little crusty that you can cut and serve

I thought this was a great idea!  My family used Tims Cascade Jalipno chips (crushed) instead of the crackers for more flavor, and cream cheese instead of the soup. This made it not as mushy for us. Add some green onion and garlic and its amazing!... thanks for the amazing idea!

All of my husbands family love these sandwiches. I personaly think they are bland and mushy. I feel like I'm eating a gooey piece of cardboard. They always eat them at family get togethers. I will be making them for my son's b-day party but I will also make bbq pork sandwiches for people who like their food to have flavor.

I cooked chicken tenderloins in the crockpot with water overnight then the next morning added the rest of the ingredients but I used STOVE TOP STUFFING savory herb instead of the suggested seasonings and crackers. Set it on low and it was ready by game time.  Pretty good!

I made this recipe last night and it came out very good. I used a store bought pre-made rotisserie chicken, and stuck it in the fridge for a day. I think this made it easier to shred the meat. Plus it was there already cooked when i decided to make this recipe.

I slow-cooked 2 ½ pounds of chicken thighs on the stove with carrots, celery and onions.  When done, I reserved the vegetables and de-boned the chicken.  I added ONE can of condensed Cream of Chicken soup, ½ cup of the broth/stock used to cook the chicken, a sprinkle of Soul Food seasoning, and a couple shakes of celery seed.  After stirring, if I find the mixture too “mushy” (as others describe), I simply sprinkle in enough store-bought Italian seasoned bread crumbs until I have the consistency I want.  My family loves it on oatmeal bread toasted and quartered.  We can’t get enough of it.

Very good. When I used to travel to Ohio I would have these a lot at local ice cream stands. This is a good recipe but if you boil your chicken in water with a bouillion cube and add salt, pepper, paprika and garlic powder I think it is better. Instead of crackers you can sub dressing. Delish comfort food!!! Thanks.

I have been looking for a recipe for shredded chicken sandwiches that tasted like the one I would get at the local ice cream stand.  This is pretty darn close.  I love the mushy texture and will definetly make it again.

I had some extra cooked chicken and thought about making shredded BBQ chicken sandwiches but saw this recipe. My kids love toasted tuna so I thought this would be a great recipe. I used cream of chicken and added some seasoning. The taste was Ok  but the texture was like warm chicken pudding. Yuck. The only good thing about the meal was the veggie tray of peppers, celery, and carrots. I've never seen the boys be so excited about veggies. I don't think I'd waste the chicken again.

I boiled 3 boneless CB in water, Chicken bouillon, Creole Poultry seasoning, dash garlic salt, dash onion powder & S&P.  When done I shredded with fork & added 1 can Cream of Chicken Soup, more creole seasoning and about 12 crumbled Town House crackers.  I served on toasted/buttered hamburger buns.  This was pretty good.  My son (very very picky) actually ate the whole sandwich!

Not the worst chicken sandwich I have had but not the best. I found it to be very much lacking in flavor. I had to add more spices.

I used a can of gravy (which sounds gross, I know) because that's what we had in the pantry and this was still a hit with the hubbs and my toddler. Who would have guessed?!

I used one Chicken breast, boiled it, shredded it in the blender a little bit at a time. Then I used 1 can of cream of mushroom,a little bit of garlic salt, about 1/4 tsp of Italian seasoning, and crushed up a few wheat crackers. Cooked it on the stove top about 10 minutes, it was good. It wasn't too mushy either.

Really yummy sandwich filling; is good cold, also. I like to add diced celery. Especially a nice recipe for mothers with several children, because it makes alot. Much more economical also than buying overpriced lunchmeat, and healthier too I'd imagine. Great recipe!

I have been looking for a similar recipe for a while. This is very good. I used Mural of Flavor seasoning  and a dash of Sandwich Sprinkle from Penzeys. I also cooked the chicken (I used chicken breasts) in water with a rounded tsp of chicken bullion, ground celery seed, onions, carrots, all-purpose seasoning blend, sea salt and pepper. It gave great flavor to the chicken.  Good recipe!

I made a few changes and it was ok - I poached the chicken in chicken broth, added a little of that, paprika, a little milk, and a spoonful of sour cream.  I think I'll do without the crackers next time, I didn't really like the taste they added.

It is true, this is a bland food but that is exactly how these sandwiches taste.  I was raised in Texas & haven't really understood my Ohio family's excitement over these sandwiches served at their local fair  each year but all I can say is that maybe it has everything to do with regional taste, memories, & tradition. I guess that is why I was searching for the recipe!

This was okay.  I used one can of mushroom & one can of cream of chicken with herbs.  I also added about a half cup of sour cream & a half cup of milk.  For seasoning I added 1/4 of an onion finely minced & some garlic powder in addition to the poultry seasoning.  The recipe is a little bland, but you can jazz it up to your liking.

I used canned chicken, so it didn't have to cook so long.  It left it a little dry, though, so I'll add a can of cream of chicken soup next time.  All in all, it was pretty good and we will have it again.

My boyfriend and I enjoyed this recipie.  Great for a cold, wet day.  I did not have any crackers so I used stove top stuffing.  Reheated well the next day too.  I'll probably make this and put it in a crock pot for a fall pot luck.

When I first tried this recipe about 4 years ago, I had no idea how often I'd turn to it! I make either this or sloppy joes when we have leftover hamburger or hot dog buns and I want something quick and easy. Over time, I have modified it to what works best for us. I use ground turkey (I'm sure shredded chicken would be better, but ground meat cooks faster) and add garlic powder, salt, pepper, fat free sour cream, olives, and a little milk. Then we sprinkle a little bit of Frank's Red Hot Sauce on our individual sandwiches. I know I changed the recipe, but I really like it and am glad I stumbled upon it!  Thanks!

This sandwich turned out very well. I added cajun seasoning, cayenne and chili powder, and pepper to the mix in order to spice it up a bit. Will make again.

My family really likes shredded chicken sandwiches.  I like adding about 1/4 tsp of sage and instead of crackers I use Pepperidge Farms seasoned bread crumbs, this adds a little more flavor for those who think it is to "bland"!

I grew up on shredded chicken sandwiches (another Lancaster, Ohio peep here). First, I never knew it was an Ohio thing, second this is perfect. This is the basic recipe and if you want to add flavor, I add your salt, pepper, and even more ritz crackers. It is great for potlucks, football season, or quick fix dinner.

I made it with chicken breasts which I poached in chicken broth til tender, then shredded. Added the chicken back into the broth,  then added 2 cans cream of chicken soup, crackers, some Penzey's chicken soup base, poultry seasoning and pepper. I let it simmer on low for about an hour and it was wonderful. I don't think it would have been as tasty without the added soup base and seasonings, though.

I used this recipe as a foundation. I was looking for a shredded chicken recipe for sandwiches.  I smoked the chicken on my Pit Barrel Cooker with just a little mesquite wood - 3 boneless, skinless breast and also used reduced fat Ritz crackers - almost one whole sleeve. I skipped the poultry seasoning because I seasoned the chicken w/ Pit Barrel All Purpose rub before smoking. I added only 1 can of condensed creme of mushroom soup and thinned it with about a 1/2 cup of milk. After letting the chicken rest for about 5 - 10 minutes after coming off the smoker, I shredded one breast and then thinly sliced up the other 2. The consistency was thick - you could eat it with a fork but it was PERFECT between a couple of slices of toasted bread!! Great flavor - not the least bit bland! Another reviewer mentioned you could thicken it with more crackers and thin it with more milk depending on your preference. The smoking was a little bit of extra work but WELL worth it and definitely something you could prepare in advance. Kids loved it - will definitely be preparing this again!

Used cream of chicken and cream of celery.  Everyone liked it.
Will probably make it again, but instead of a whole cooked chicken will use chicken breasts.

And the verdict is...... quick, easy and delish! We fudged it a little...had to work with what we had. Ritz bits w/ cheese instead of regular "buttery rounds", cream of chicken instead of mushroom, and regular bread instead of buns cuz we have 10,000 loaves open. We also sprinkled a bit of shredded cheddar on top. Picky autistic boy gave it 4.5--he said we had to choose 4 stars since there are no 1/2  stars available. (I'm happy since last night's dinner was an epic fail.)

Definitely an Ohio thing.  Popular at potlucks and after church dinners. I use cream of celery in ours, a cup of shredded cheddar and top with crushed potato chips, but like it with crackers too.  Always serve on toasted buns to negate any mushy issues (although it IS a mushy sort of sandwich) Great to cook chicken in a crockpot for serving too.

I always use chicken broth instead of cream of mushroom. I can't say how much I use though b/c I just add a little at a time so that I can stop before it gets overly mushy.

This is exactly what I was looking for!  My husband remembered it from his childhood & I had never gotten the recipe from his family.  I used the canned chicken, but shredded it up by hand before adding the other ingredients.

We used half chicken thighs, and half skinless boneless chicken.  We also used two cans cream of chicken soup and used some garlic and onion powder in addition to the poultry seasoning.  We mixed everything together and tryed to cook on the stove.  The mixture was so dry that we just couldn't figure out how this was going to cook (without burning anyway).  We added a half cup of milk, which gave it a more workable consistency.  Flavor was decent.  Not completely sure if I would try this one again or not.  It was good, don't get me wrong, everyone ate this (including three young children) with no complaints.  I'm thinking there is a better recipe out there though.

I thought this recipe was way too dry. The crackers plus the bun felt was too much. My family thought it was just OK, we never finished the leftovers.

easy to make. i get whole chickens and cook them which gives better flavor than canned chicken. also, i include a bullion cube when cooking the chicken. i made it for a dinner and kept it warm in a crock pot. worked out great. my husband loves it! I've made this recipe several times.

I thought this recipe was very quick and easy, but I made it a little different.I used the cream of mushroom, but  I added a cube of chicken bouillon and a can of milk.I also used seasoning salt and garlic salt instead of poultry seasoning.It was pretty good.It could be kinda of salty to some people.

I'm giving it 4 stars because my family liked it alot but I was not as impressed. I found it a bit bland. But it was very easy, quick and made everyone happy so that is good. I covered my portion with creole seasoning.

Didn't care for it at all. It was bland and the soupy runny texture was not pleasant.
