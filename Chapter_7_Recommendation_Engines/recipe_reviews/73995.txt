This is the same way Sandy's mother, Mrs Hadsell, made wild black berry pie when we were kids back in '47 or so. There are a few tips that help: Either go easy on maple syrup or skip it. If the berries are quite ripe, skip the syrup. You shouldn't need the liquid from the syrup if the berries are ripe. Also, don't be shy with the berries, she would often but in 5 or more cups.  Sometimes Mrs Hadsell would put in almond extract or cocnut extract instead of the vanilla. She almost always added a few dabs of butter on top of the berries. The key is ripe and full sized blackberries. The rest takes care of itself.

Adding maple adds a unique flavor to this pie but the recipe lacks a thickening.  When I made the recipe, I pureed 1 cup of the berries very well and sieved them into a pan with the 1 cup sugar, the spices and 4 Tb. cornstarch, cooking until thick and bubbly.  Cool slightly, and mix with the remaining ingredients to put in pie shell.  I'm sure tapioca would also work in this recipe. The flavorings are a good combination.  Another time (since we have a lot of large and juicy wild blackberries) we added part of a can of pre-made apple pie filling, not having quite enough blackberries to make up the recipe.  That also works with these flavors.

Yes, the pie was runny, but, served with whipped cream, resembled a juicy berry cobbler. The taste was superb, although I would suggest a little less sugar. Note: I substituted Ollaliberries with this recipe.

This was pretty disappointing. I must say that I think it was the first time I'd ever made a double-crust berry pie, so I tried to follow the recipe exactly. But when I cut into it after letting it cool for about two hours, the inside was totally soupy - not gooey, but quite liquid. I guess that thing about lacking thickeners (as a previous reviewer mentioned) was the problem here. The crust I used was a store-bought refrigerated one, not from scratch. I'm not very familiar with blackberries, but they looked nice and plump and ripe to me. I cut 6 slits in the top of the pie (does making "holes" as specified in the recipe really make a difference, i.e., better venting?) and baked it for 50 minutes. I will mention that I live at a high elevation (around 6200 feet), but I wouldn't think that would make much difference either. On the other hand, the taste per se was pretty good, and when I drained most of the liquid out after having the first half of the "pie", the remaining pie slices were a lot more like what I expected, although they were pretty flat. A hard lesson to learn - I'll know better next time - but this recipe just didn't work for me as is.

I haven't made this yet, but I have seen a lot of comments on it being runny. One trick I use when making berry pies is to dice an apple and add to the filling. It helps absorb the juice and doesn't impact the flavor of the berries.

The flavor was good but the consistency is awful watery. If you add starch maybe will be OK.
