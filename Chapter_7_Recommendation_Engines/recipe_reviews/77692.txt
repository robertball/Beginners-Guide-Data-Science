If you're looking for the pimento cheese eaten in the Southern US, this is NOT it!  To make the "classic" spread, omit the nuts, add just a dash of hot sauce (for flavor, not heat), and 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder.  It will keep for weeks in the fridge and makes a great sandwich.  Also good melted over tortilla chips.

The secret is cream cheese. Use Miracle Whip in place of mayo. Blend cream cheese, pimentos,pecans first. Add cheddar, then miracle whip as needed. Use miracle whip to freshen up.

This is our absolute fav pimento cheese.  We have been making it this way for a few years. Some tips.  Shred your own cheese.  Its SO MUCH BETTER. Its a lot of work to shred a pound of cheese, but the package stuff just does not compare.  If you are going to serve it as a spread for crackers (as opposed to a sandwhich spread, which to me is odd, but lots of people like it that way), don't add all the juice from the pimentos.  It will be too runny.   Drain and save the juice and add as much as you want to make it a nice considtancy to serve as a cracker spread.  To me, a little bit of pepper and salt goes a long way...but thats a personal preference!

This was not our favorite. We love pimiento cheese, and my husband loves pecans, but this recipe just didn't work for us. A waste of good pecans. Sorry.

I'd recommend decreasing the amount of nuts in it.  After a few days, the pecans gave it a bitter taste and was too overpowering.  I did not add any pepper to it.

This is a simple basic Pimento Cheese recipe; just what I was looking for.  I think that it is delicious.  I used salad dressing instead of mayo because I like the tart taste of salad dressing.

this was very good & super easy. I left out the nuts because of an allergy. I added a dash of garlic powder, and a dash of red pepper...I'd make it again

This is a very basic pimento cheese.  I did like the crunch you get from the pecans, however, I did think it was bland for my taste.  I added some cayenne pepper to taste and it greatly improved the flavor.  It was more for flavor than the spicy heat.   Definitely grate your own cheese.  Pre-grated cheese may be a nice shortcut, but, it won't blend or taste as good if you use it.
