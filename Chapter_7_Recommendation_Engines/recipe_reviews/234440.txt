Pumpkin pie is my favorite pie to begin with. Now this pie is my favorite and seems to be everyone's favorite! I've made 6 of these so far this fall and winter and my 7th is in the oven now. I've received many compliments on this pie. Now if I ask what I can bring for a dinner with family or friends this is the 1st request! I've been using sugar pumpkins from our garden. I've found that with the pumpkins I've canned I need to double the cooking time to 325 for 1 hour.

I could taste the Kahlua.   Cut in half the cloves but was still strong.   Good product.
