I love the taste of this kettle corn, but for future makers you need to be careful. I ran into a problem with the sugar, following the directions I waited for a few pieces to pop before adding it in and got splattered  by oil,  was actually stirring the sugar so it would melt enough that I could shake the pot and the sugar would be a sticky sugary paste the kernels just stuck to; again I ran into the problem of the oil splattering. To say the least my first batch burned on the bottom.  The second time I made it, I added the sugar and the kernels in at the same time and the popcorn turned out delicious.

Awesome!  I doubled all ingredients, except the oil I left 1/4 cup.  I also threw in the salt (maybe 1/2 teaspoon) along with the sugars.  It tasted like a light version of caramel popcorn but was ready in 5 minutes! I know by the way the kids inhaled it, I will be making it a lot!  Thanks happy cook!

Super easy, followed as is it yields a good sized bowl of crispy, crunchy, and certainly sugary, popcorn. On a scale of 100 I'd give this a 95 but that's still an A. 

Some recipe notes after trying this several times:

• Heating the oil slowly is a big deal. Before you put the kernels in, drop a couple into the oil. Do they pop quickly? If so then your oil is too hot.  Reduce the heat and wait about 15 seconds then try again. 

• If you guessed wrong and they start going off the moment they hit the oil then you'll have to pour the sugar immediately. This will still result in a random mix of over and under coated kernels. Ideally if you bring up the heat slowly waiting until the kernels pop works. 

• IMHO best way: 
- Bring oil to low heat.  
- When test kernel sizzles but doesn't immediately pop add kernels and reserve half of your brown sugar/sugar mix. I also add a little coarse salt. Distribute evenly and stir if necessary. 
- Add lid and gradually increase heat while gently agitating the mixture.
- When first kernels pop, add remaining sugar mix and replace lid.
- DO NOT REMOVE THE LID
- As the popping increases begin agitating the mix more fervently so the oil/sugar mixture coats all those freshly popped kernels. 
- The popping dies down. If you've ever popped stove top you know when it's done. 
- Pull it off the heat and shake it like hell. 
- Pour into bowls, drizzle of you wish. Serve AFTER its cooled down. It'll seem kind of gooey at first but they crisp after they

This is soooooooooooooo good! I will never eat bagged kettle corn again! This is so amazing while hot and has a crispy outer shell...the only thing I'd do next time around is add a little more sugar. Be extremely careful with the hot oil, of course....I wouldn't let children help with making this. 5 *****!!

My boyfriend & I made a small batch of this the other day to try it and we were blown away!  It tastes exactly like the kettle corn I buy at fairs & festivals.  I'm so glad I can now make this anytime I want at home.  We didn't even have a pan with a lid we used a big wok and covered it with aluminum foil and carefully tucked the foil around the edges so the kernels didn't pop out.  It was so good, we've made 5 batches of it in the past week!

Excellent recipe! I adapted it to my electric popcorn popper and it was GREAT! (1/4 C oil to 1/2C popcorn - let them heat until they are "sizzling" then sprinkle sugars over. I shook the popper to make sure nothing stuck or burned.)YUMMY!

this was a great recipe! It's more like a cross between Kettle and Caramel corn. if you follow the recipe exactly you should have no trouble (after burning my first two batches I know!). One helpful thing I learned make sure you use a much larger pot than you think you need (ie a dutch oven etc.) and be sure the popcorn covers the bottom of the pan completely, that way when you add the sugars it sits on the corn, not the pan.

I have made this a couple of times. The first time I added the sugar and popcorn at the same time and it burned. I discovered that if you make the sugar mixture separate from the popcorn it doesn't burn. I use 3 Tablespoons of margarine, 3 Tablespoons Brown sugar and 3 Tablespoons white sugar and 1 teaspoons of cinnamon

This was a very tasty recipe, and super simple to make. I've tried other forms of sweet and salty / Kettle corn before, and this was by far the best. It wasn't overly sticky as some other ones are as well.

I added 2 tsp of brown sugar just to have a bit more of a caramel flavour, but otherwise I made it as the recipe said and it was fantastic.

As many suggested, I added three kernels in to ensure the oil was hot enough and quickly added the rest of the kernels and sugar at the same time. I removed it from the heat while I stirred to coat and then put it back on the burner and covered.

The three seconds shake/rest worked perfectly! Thanks for the great recipe, I'll definitely make this again.

I too used 1/4 cup oil an a 1/2 corn. Needed more firm to the ratio. I'll only use white sugar next time for that true Texas State Fair kettle corn taste. Robin - Beach City Texas

Exceptionally GOOD!  I do think it is more like caramel corn than kettle corn however.  I used 2 Tbs. of both the white & brown sugars & 1/3 cup of popcorn in 1/4 cup of veg. oil.  I used medium heat.  I think the key is to keep that pot a shakin' pretty much throughout the cooking process.  The brown sugar makes it thick & the kernels seemed slow to pop, but patience paid off.   This was one of the best snacks I've had in a very, very long time!   I'll be making this often!!

The oil-to-corn ratio seems way off (I used half as much oil as corn), and I added the seasonings after the corn was pretty much done popping because I was afraid of getting a melted, burned mess.  I also added half a teaspoon of cinnamon, which made it awesome.

I made this 5 min. after I seen it here. YUMMY!  I used coconut oil instead (it was what I had). Usually I put less sugar in things I make but trusted this recipe and glad I did!  Some of the sugar does stay at the bottom of the pot and you probably only get half of it on the popped corn. It tastes FANTASTIC!  My son who LOVES popcorn loves it. I will definately use this recipe as a fundraiser too.  I also sprinkled alittle cinnamon on my bowl of this and it is SUPERB!  The only thing that is not correct is that it can be ready in 30 minutes or less! Going back for more!

This popcorn needs to be moved around frequently.  The brown sugar didn't melt completely and caused some burning and smoke from the electric burners on the stove.  Overall the popcorn turned out descent.

Made this recipe but I need to warn everyone, when oil gets hot it splatters, so if you reach over or into the hot pan, it can splatter on you!!!! 

Anyhoo, I doubled the popcorn and the sugar but not the oil, oh and used coconut oil instead of canola oil and it turned out PERFECT!!! It was a BIG HIT!!! Hubs and kids devoured the whole batch while it was still on the stove!!!!!!!!

I used a whirly pop popper and increased the amounts 2x.  Delicious!  My wife isn't much of a popcorn eater, but she loves kettle corn.  I make this without her knowing it...the look on her face when she ate some was priceless..she asked for a dish full!

I used 1/2 cup corn kernels with 3T popping oil. I did 4T white sugar and 4t brown. This gets really hot. Be ready with oven mits. I had to stir to get it going and keep it from sticking

Easy, simple and tasty. We might have to make another batch. We sprinkled kosher salt on as it cooled.

I followed the directions and got a oozing blob on the stove. Only about half of the popcorn popped and half of it was stuck in the pan. The taste was really good but not worth the mess.

I wish I would have read previous reviews first.  It is essential that you add sugar and popcorn at the same time.  By following the recipe, my sugar burnt and I had to toss the whole thing.
