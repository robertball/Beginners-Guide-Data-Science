Move over spinach and artichoke dips - this recipe blows all of you away!  I've made this recipes at least 16 times now for company, and everytime it disappears.  My favorite part is not telling anyone what the key ingredient is and making them guess.  We usally eat it with flavored Triscuts.  And the best part:  low fat mayo and sour cream work just fine!!

This dip definitely moved to the top of my appetizer list!  The only modification I made was to replace the green onions with minced shallots. It made for a creamier consistency. And the suggestion to serve it with water cracker is a GREAT idea, you do not want to use salty crackers with this dip otherwise it is too salty.

I like to add a clove of minced garlic and puree the whole thing in my food processor.

I made this for company & it was a huge success.  I asked people to guess what was in it and nobody could.  I added a clove of minced garlic (per the suggestion of another reviewer) & only used a 1/4 cup of scallions as my husband isn't a big onion fan.  Also I used reduced fat mozzarella & sour cream as well as mayo made from canola oil.  The only other comment I have is that it tasted salty to me.  As I'd never used hearts of palm before, this may just be the taste of the ingredient.  Anyway my guests still scarfed it up & one asked for the recipe, which is always a good sign.

This dip is great!  I like the hearts of palm better than artichokes in this same style of dip.  I used vegenaise instead of mayo with no problems.

Rather mild, bland, only ok to my taste, but people who like mayo & cheese-based dips will like or love it. This was similar in texture to artichoke heart dips. I halved a batch so I could taste it as written, & then with half the mayo. I preferred it with less mayo. I thought it needed more hearts of palm, & a little something else, maybe 1 clove garlic, or a pinch of red chile pepper. I'll eventually make this again, but only with changes to suit my taste. ~~ I much prefer "palmittos" plain on salads, or in a shrimp empanada.

I've never had hearts of palm before, but I thought I'd try this recipe out anyway. It turned out so good! I too added a bit of minced garlic, and this dip was perfect! I'll be making this one again, thanks.

Tastes great with triscuits!  I added two cloves of minced garlic per other reviewers.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I found it a little salty, but hearts of palm are salty.  I will definitely make it again.

Holy smokes good!  I added a clove of minced garlic. I could not stop eating it, but eventually it gets too rich and I had to stop. Yum. I have made the at least a dozen times with rave reviews.

This was the biggest hit at my Christmas celebrations this year!  I love hearts of palm, and this did not disappoint.  So easy to mix and bake.  I toppped the dip with some paprika for color before baking, but other than that, made exactly as directed.  Will definitely do again!

Everyone really liked this dip - reminded me alot of artichoke dip. And it finally made use of that can of hearts of palm I had lying around (I had bought that one time accidentally - intending to buy artichokes).

Made for Christmas Eve cocktails .  It was well received ,  and SO's 90 yr. old mom asked for the recipe !  I tasted a bit too much of the mayo ,  so next time I will try 1/2 c. mayo , and 1/2 c. sour cream .  I will also try some minced garlic stirred in . Nice change from artichoke dip .  Thank you for sharing .

Excellent - similar to the artichoke dip that people make but with a different twist.  I took this to a party and served with pita crisps.  Everyone enjoyed it!

Love it!  So easy.  I've been making this dip for years, and it's always been a great hit.  I add a little more cheese but it's fabulous exactly as the recipe is written as well.

Love this recipe!  Didn't have green onions so I used regular, but cut the amount back to 1/4 cup to make sure they didn't take over. Added a tsp of minced garlic based on other reviews. A definite keeper!

I had 17 people in my house last night and this was a HUGE hit. Even the kids gobbled it up. The only problem I had was finding the hearts of palm. (I had never even heard of them before) I had to go to 2 different stores. Atleast now I know where to find them. This was SO yummy. I will make again when expecting another crowd!

This dip is absolutely fabulous!! The tartness of the palm hearts gives it a flavor that you can't get with artichokes or spinach. Perfect with baked pita chips!

What a good recipe.  I know so many people who say they dislike hearts of palm but when they tried this dip it changed their mind.  It is alot like an artichoke dip in consistancy and apearance but a taste is all it's own.  The minced garlic is a good way to "zing" it up.  Not a recipe I was over the moon for but deffinatly a keeper for parties and appetizers!

This was soooo good. I made it with my mom a few months ago, and everyone in the family inhaled it within an hour. Fantastic.

It's so good, that I wish I had never made it. I ate nearly the entire dish! Substituted light mayo and sour cream it was still delish. I served it with french bread.

This dip is Amazing! A real crowd pleaser and sooo easy to make. It’s really easy if you get the sliced hearts of palm and. Chop it up real good.  Mix all the other ingredients together and Walah!  Serve with water cracker or tortilla chips and you’ll be a hit!

Didn't want to make changes but I had to use plain yogurt instead of sour cream and I used a blend of cheese because I didn't have mozzarella.  I used a good sprinkling of garlic salt and added 5 scallions . I will make again when I have all the right ingredients but my husband did like this very much.

I'm probably not rating this recipe as I did modify it. I had made a half batch of the Exotic Salad found in Allrecipes (yum!) and wanted to do something different with the remaining half ingredients. I searched for a recipe with heart of palms and found this one. It didn't call for artichokes and canned mushrooms but I put them all with the heart of palms in the food processor along with vegan mayo, nutritional yeast, and veggie dip seasoning. It tastes great! I'm not going to bake it.

I was met with skepticism when putting this together, as onlookers were like, "what are those?" when they saw the hearts of palm. However, it was very well received!! Caution, very hot when it comes out of the oven - burnt the roof of my mouth as I was so eager to try it! Used other reviewers' suggestions and used equal amounts mayo and sour cream, and added garlic. Baked for 25 minutes. Did not find it too salty as others mentioned. Absolutely delicious!!

Great recipe! People loved it! I made some modification based on reviews and what I had on hand. I added 1 glove of garlic and used only 1/4 cup of scallions as suggested by other reviewers. I substituted Creme Fraiche for sour cream and used fresh grated vegetarian Parmesan - simply because it's what I had. I served it with Shoprite Entertainment crackers. It was not salty at all and tasted great.

I have never seen a dip go so fast in a small crowd.  People could not stop talking about how good this was.  I did make some changes just based on what I had on hand - I used less green onions and didn't have mozzarella so used all parmesan and asiago cheese.  I also used vegannaise because one of my friends is allergic to eggs.  I served it with roasted red peppers in the center.  Thanks for this one!!

Very good. I made it as written, and think it could have used more "oomph" but not sure what..... I was not thrilled at the first bite, but the more I ate it, the more I liked it.  My friends practically licked the dish clean, and asked me to make it again, so I would say its a keeper!

This was delicious!  The only thing I did differently was add a touch of garlic salt.  People could not stop eating this.  I enjoyed it best with water crackers but others like it with Roasted Garlic flavored Triscuits.

Served w/pita chips and plate was licked clean. A nice "classy" (if a dip can be classy) twist to the artichoke dip you know and love but see everywhere.

I didn't have the exact ingredients, so I used what was in my fridge (i.e. 1/2 bar of low fat creme cheese, etc) but the best substitution, i think, was chopped red onions instead of green onions. They tasted great. This recipe gave me a great foundation for my first experiment with hear of palm. I'm going to a party this coming weekend and plan to make this again. Thanks, great recipe!

VERY GOOD DIP!!!  My daughter went bonkers over it and told me three times to make sure and give this a 5 star review.  I liked it better after it had cooled for about 5 to 10 mins.  Very good flavor!  Thanks for posting!
