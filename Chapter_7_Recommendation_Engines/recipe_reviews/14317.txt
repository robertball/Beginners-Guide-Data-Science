Beautiful summertime salad.  The most difficult part is timing it so that the mango and the avocado are sufficiently ripe at the same time, since grocery stores usually sell them in a pre-ripened state.  Attractive presentation.

Great and exotic chicken salad.  Worth the assembly of all these delicious fruits, little more time consuming, but wonderful to the taste buds.  Cool, tasty summer salad for company on a hot day, or just your family on a hot day.
Love it.

This is excellent for those who enjoy eating healthy meals.  The flavors work wonderfully together and there is such a nice variety of fresh ingredients most children can find something they enjoy.  I will make this again exactly as it is written.

This was pretty good.  I ended up adding more OJ to the dressing because the sesame oil was overpowering - I would cut the sesame oil in half next time.  This probably won't become a dinner staple for us but it's good when you're looking for something different.

Very tasty! My husband who does not like salad dressing even enjoyed it.  I spiced up the dressing a bit by adding a teaspoon of Sambol Olek and it was great!

This is a visually attractive salad, perfect for ladies' luncheon. While we all liked the taste of the dressing, we thought it was too thin. Didn't coat the salad, which made it kind "drippy." Couldn't think of a way to thicken the dressing at the last minute.

Delish! This was a nice 'don't have to measure anything' recipe! All the flavors combined well. Left out the cheese, and used 'Light and Fresh Dressing' (from this website), since this one got mixed reviews.

I thought the dressing for this salad was really gross, the sesame oil was WAY to overpowering, so i through out the dressing and completely started over, omiting the sesame oil, cutting the soy sauce in half, and also, leaving out the pepper, and even with that i still wasn't happy with the dressing. The salad was overall, just ok, nothing special, i would prefer a salad with ranch dressing and just some plain old grilled chicken over the top before i ate this one. BUT, my hubby loved it and scarfed it down, and finished mine, so i am giving it 3 stars, because i hated it and he loved it, so i found a happy medium.

I love this recipe! I am not a big fan of sesime oil so I added a 1/4 cup more pineapple juice to the dressing.

A great idea, just missing something.  The dressing is very thin and just runs right to the bottom of the bowl, it doesn't seem to coat the greens at all.  The combination of fruits and green pepper was wonderful though.  I might try it again but with some changes to the dressing to thicken it up a bit.

Weird.  Just plain weird.  The dressing seemed to lack something...and it had a lot of ingred's!  Dunno.  I'm into different tasting food, but this just lacked.  Will try other ways to use mangoes.

This was really good and so light and refreshing. I served it at a beach-themed bridal shower and it was very well received.
