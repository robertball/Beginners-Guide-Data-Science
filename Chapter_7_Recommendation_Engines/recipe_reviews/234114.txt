Came out even better than expected. If you’re in the States, or somewhere you can’t get Club House spices, I substituted it with a mixture granulated garlic, onion, rosemary, thyme, black pepper, and pink salt. Came out phenomenal- flavor, texture, everything about this was amazing. It’s (obviously) very filling, too- a serving is a serving. 6 servings allowed my family of 6 to take home left overs. I couldn’t give this recipe 5 stars in good faith because I didn’t use the spice mix that the recipe required, but this is overall an amazing recipe.

I had huge expectations for this one. My guests loved it  but me... hmmm.  I think I needed to add more cheese and gravy! They both really melted away (its like they disappeared) because I had to bake for about 20 minutes longer than called for.  I used a spiralizer to cut then potatoes and it worked out great.

This is really rich and more like 8 servings at least.  I didn't have the seasoning called for so I used a Seasoned Pepper Blend.  Allow more like 60 minutes baking time even with very thinly sliced potatoes.  Thanks for a new take on scalloped potatoes.

Its ironic that one of the reviewers said their potatoes needed more gravy, because mine were swimming in gravy. I did use turkey gravy leftover from thanksgiving, so maybe it was because of a different type of gravy, or maybe he used way bigger potatoes than I did.

Delicious.  I halved the recipe, for two people, and omitted the seasoning blend since I used a salty-enough gravy mix I got from the Mennonite food store.  My husband loves poutine and enjoyed this recipe too.  We'll make it again.
