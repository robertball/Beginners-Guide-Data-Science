Sorry, but we did NOT like this chowder; sugar in a corn chowder? I had my doubts as I read the recipe, but I never mess with a recipe the first go-round. It was TOO sweet; actually I don't think it needs ANY sugar. I gave this recipe two stars because of its potential. Other than it being sweet, it has great flavors, and love the ease of the crockpot. Will try again WITHOUT the sugar!

This was a really good starter recipe.  I added two diced pototoes and a small diced white onion.  I used whole milk since that is what I had on hand.  I doubled the bacon, cooked and diced it before putting it in the crockpot.  I cut the black pepper to a  TEASPOON and half and still felt the bite.  Next time I will only use a teaspoon.  I added a sprinkling of parsley flakes and about a 1/2 cup more chicken broth than the recipe calls for.  This was delicious and everyone in my family ate it without issues.  I have 4 kids, so that's a victory at dinner in my home.

To obtain more fresh corn taste, I  added 2 cups of fresh corn chopped in the blender .  For a little bite chop real fine 1/2 of a fresh jalapeno pepper with veins and seed removed.   Delicious.  What a great soup.

This was good but I made a couple changes.  Make sure to cook bacon before hand or it won't get done.  Also, don't use fat free cream cheese.  I took out the sugar and celery and it was delicious!

This was a great chowder! Great consistancy unlike some watery corn chowders I have seen. I made a few changes I dident add the sugar and I only added 1/2 a tbs of pepper and wish I added less and let everone add it to their own bowl I found it to be a little too much for my little ones even with the 1/2 a tbs. At the end of cooking it I tasted it and it was good but something was missing.... Potatos! So I diced up three medium potatots cooked them up and added them to the soup before I served. My husband said it was the best corn chowder he ever had!

I really liked this recipe, however, since the first time making it, I've made some changes for our taste.  I use 2 bags of frozen corn, Flavor Pac brand I think, the Sweet Candy Corn and the Sweet Yellow are the two I think and I do still add the sugar.  I use 2 cans chicken broth, omit the pepper or just give it a light sprinkle, omit the celery and omit the bacon unless we just sprinkle it over each bowl before serving.  To assemble, I dice up 2 potatoes, half an onion, add the corn and the chicken broth to a big pot on the stovetop and cook until the potatoes and corn are soft, 15-20 minutes; then add the cheeses and stir constantly until all melted.  Then I remove the pot from the stove and add 1 can of evaporated milk--careful here or it will curdle--still taste ok but look not so good...  Almost forgot the most important ingredient to my changes--I add 2 heaping tablespoons of chopped jalapeno pepper from a jar with some of the juice while the potatoes are cooking.  This soup is fabulous as written but even better I think with my changes--wish I could give it more stars!

This recipe has great potential, but as is is way too spicy.  When I cook a recipe, I never mess with the amount of ingredients.  As I was pouring in the pepper, I was a bit skeptical of 2 tablespoons, as that seemed like a lot.  When I tasted it a few hours later, it was so overwhelming that it took away from everything else.  I ended up just doubling the recipe w/o adding any more pepper...and it was still spicy, but not nearly as bad.  I will do this recipe again, but with much, much less pepper.

This Chowder was so delicious!  I used corn on the cob I had in the freezer.  I just cut it off the cob..wonderful fresh taste.  I will definately make this one again!

This soup is really good but the celery was still crunchy after 4hrs on HIGH in the crockpot..I would saute it first or leave it out...and add 2 peeled potatoes to make it a true chowder. The cream cheese really makes it good & creamy, though.

Pretty good!  My husband and one year old son also enjoyed it.  You can't beat a throw-it-in-the-crockpot-and-forget-it kind of meal.  I did make a couple of changes - omitted the sugar and added some potatoes.  I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and would probably do it the same way.  My only mistake was to substitute turkey bacon - not a good idea!  It came out tasteless.  Stick with the real thing.  I will definitely try this again with real bacon.

i love this recipe. celery is such an underrated ingredient. the sugar is a nice touch. i will add a frozen chicken breast to it for more meat, and i will chop up a red potato if i have it laying around. this is a chilly day staple for me

My husband likes hot peppery dishes, but even though I only put 1 tablespoon of ground black pepper, he found this recipe to be too hot.  I liked it a lot, otherwise, but next time I will use half a teaspoon and let everyone add more pepper to their taste.
