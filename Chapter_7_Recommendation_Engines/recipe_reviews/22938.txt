Look no further for a chili recipe - this is the best! Be sure to use hot paprika because it makes this dish. I add a little extra spice by measuring a heaping tablespoon each of chili powder, cumin, and hot paprika. We also prefer one large onion and one medium yellow pepper.
I now also add 1-2 tsp of jalapenos for an extra, tasty kick. We like it spicy! Leave out the extra sugar if you want it less sweet.

This was fantastic!  I made it for a party, and I used vegetarian soy crumbles instead of meat.  I fooled all the carnivores at the party!

Receipe tasted just like regular chili, except this was sweeter, which was a minus. If it had a little less sweet and a little more hot (cayenne pepper) this would be great!

This chili is really good, although it definitely needed spicing up!  I added a minced habanero pepper, which gave it the needed zip.  I also used texturized vegetable protein instead of ground beef to get the same texture as meat chili without all the saturated fat.  I'll make this one again!

I hated chili until I found this recipe. Don't change a thing, it's great the way it is. I have made this chili several times since I found it and it always turns out great. Also it is not a really spicy chili. Thanks so much!! :-)

This is one our favorite chili recipes!    I love the balsamic vinegar in it.  It's different but oh, so good!  I do tend to like more beans then meat so I usually throw in and extra can of beans (whichever I'm in the mood for) and reduce the amount of hamburger.  But, that's my personal prefernce and the recipe reallly is worth every star as it is written.

Awesome recipe!  I did change it a bit.  I omitted the beef by choice, omitted the cilantro and vinegar by accident.  It is a great, quick easy delicious and nutritious meal.

I have had over 10 chili haters and people with gerd try this and they love it!!  This is a sweeter, milder chili which even extreme chili lovers like this.  If you want a traditional "Hot" chili this isn't it.  But for people that have had to stear clear of the hots or just don't like it hot, this is an excellent option!!!

I'm not sure how fantastic the recipe is as written, lol...because I made a few tweaks from the first time.  In making this as a healthy low fat meal with lots of flavor, I made the following changes:
- Used ground chicken as the meat
- Eliminated all oil in cooking
- Used Chipotle Chile Powder instead of the paprika, adjusting amount to accomodate spiciness
- Doubled most of the other spices
- Added a little thyme
- Eliminated the sugar

I served with low fat whole wheat corn muffins.  This was absolutely fantastic and the diet-conscious folks at work I make it for are in love with it.

Excellent base recipe!

OH MY GOSH! I thought I made good chili until I tried this recipe. I used regular paprika instead of the hot and it was just right for us. Very flavorful. I left out the olive oil and browned the beef with the peppers, garlic, spices, etc. and combined them with the beans, etc. in my crockpot and cooked it on high for 3 hours. We will make this again and again and again and again and . . . well, you get the picture.

My husband, who is not prone to liking unusual recipes, loved this! I did sub chicken for the ground beef because when I think of Caribbean jerk flavoring, I think of jerked-chicken.

I made this chili without beef and it was good. It definitely tasted different than other chili recipes I've made--sweeter, with the unusual taste of cloves. I served it with rice and cilantro as suggested. I am giving it four stars because it's just not my favorite chili recipe, but it's pretty good.

This recipe made a good base, but I didn't really find it too 'Jamaican'. I added 2 tablespoons of Jerk seasoning, the juice of one orange and one lime, a half of a red bermuda and a drop or two of molasses. 
It was awesome! Very caribbean flavoured and a nice kick.

Fantastic chili with a little kick - whether you choose to add the meat or go vegetarian. Never fails to impress people and works with all varieties of beans too. I buy a few cans of "bean medleys" and it's great.

I followed this recipe to the letter, and it was without question the worst tasting chili ever.  The clove was overpowering and there was no heat to the dish. There is nothing you could do different to make this chili taste better and it certainly does not make a person think of Jamaica.  Big yuk.

No sinus's draining here. I added 1 tsp. of cayenne and a few shakes of habanero sauce.
All in all, good tasting chili. This one replaces my Purdue Boiler Maker Chili recipe.

Like a dope, I went to the grocery store to buy ingredients for a Jamaican dish and bought "Italian Style" canned tomatoes!  Still, it was a very sweet chili.  I was expecting it to be a little tangy and spicy.  Especially since I added a few jalapeño peppers.  I like my chili spicy not sweet.

This will be my new "go to" chili recipe. Excellent flavor...my whole family loved it! I did use 1/2 hot paprika and 1/2 mild just because my kids will not eat real spicy foods. I also added heaping tablespoons of the other spices.  Topped the chili with shredded cheddar and sliced avocado.  My husband added diced jalapeno.  So good!

This recipe is the best! My 10 year old likes to make it for the family! It has the best mix of flavors. If you are looking for a good chili, this is the one to make!

FANTASTIC!! We couldn`t get enough of this. It`s the perfect chili recipe. I didn`t have `hot paprika` so I used regular and added about half a teaspoon of red pepper flakes. Also didn`t have enough ground cumin and used mostly cumin seeds. 
I find topping it with fresh dill is a DELICIOUS garnish, as well.
Healthy and very yummy!

Just a bit too sweet and a bit too spicy for our liking.  I had never used hot paprika before so if you don't like things overly spicy, you may want to cut back a little on that.

Made this and put it in a crock pot to warm while we went snowboarding on Super Bowl Sunday.  Served it to our hungry football fans in small bread bowls.  Got lots of complements.  Thanks!

This was very good, and perhaps if I'd been able to find hot paprika it would have rated five stars!  I tried substituting regular paprika and cayenne pepper, but can't be sure it had the same impact.  Be sure and chop up the tomatoes!

Maybe it was because I could not find HOT paprika that this did not turn out.  I just used plain paprika.  I did add cayenne pepper to spice it up.  It was still a sweet chili.  I don't make chili to have a sweet taste, that is not chili.  Every reviewer changed this recipe to kick up the heat. Since it is not good as is it gets one star.  The clove was over powering

When I first served it right after cooking, it was really very bland and didn't taste any different than chili you make from the spice packets. The next day it was better, but the day after that it was very delicious after I fixed it. I had to add a tsp each of cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes, and in my own bowl also poured on Tapatio hot sauce and that gave it a sweet, spicy flavor. I hate recipes that have a mile long list of ingredients and then taste bland, gimme a can anyday over this recipe as written.

I do a daily soup special for a local restaurant and this has become Friday's special.  It sells out fast every week.  Note:  If you want to reduce the heat but keep the flavor, substitute sweet paprika for the hot paprika.

This recipe is excellent! I did change a couple of things by adding in a little more meat, 1-2 peppers of your choosing (depending on how hot you want it), plus my families special hot sauce (we like it HOT)! I serve it over some basmati rice and with sour cream, cheddar cheese, and cilantro! All that being said, I won in the category for "Best Hot Chili" three years in a row! This is a great recipe!

We loved it - especially the taste of the cumin and the balsamic vinegar.  I did cut back on the beans by one can and used a combination of chili powder and habenaro chili powder - so needless to say my chili was not mild.  We did taste the sweetness of the chili but it was appreciated because of the heat from the chili powders and hot paprika.  Thanks submitter.

Good chili, but a little sweet.  I did find hot paprika & liked the level of heat in this recipe--spicy but not too crazy.  I served with rice, but think I'd like it better plain.  The rice made the chili kind of bland.  The balsamic and cilantro add a nice touch.  Be sure to chop up the tomatoes.  Goes together easily & makes enough for a crowd or provides leftovers for another day.

This was good, but not a 5 star chili. We ate it plain, as a chili, but it probably would have been even better over rice.

Great chili recipe to start with, but I personally like a bit more spice.  Instead of regular chili powder, I used some extra hot chili powder I found at an Indian Food Market.  I doubled the amount of chili powder, added a bit mroe garlic, and this recipe was certainly tasty.

This was my first time making chili from scratch. This recipe made it so EASY and delicious. It was the best chili I have had. I left out the meat, and served it with Mexican Cornbread, and WOW was it delicious. I added a little brown sugar, and cooked about 1 tablespoon of chopped cilantro with the chili. This added an interesting flavor.

We made this chili with a few additions and entered it into a chili cook off at my kids school.  We had a "Pirates of the Caribbean theme" and this chili was perfect for a Caribbean flare!  We won first place!  We used shredded pork seasoned with Jamaican jerk seasoning instead of beef, and added bacon and a hint of BBQ sauce (just to add our own flare to it, but it was great before the changes too).   We offered mangos, cilantro, and two specialty sour creams on the side.  We did a chipotle/bacon/ranch sour cream and a Cilantro/Avocado/lime.  Both were great with it!!!!  Everyone LOVED this chili!!!

This was an excellent recipe.  It really has a good flavoring by adding the spices with the sautéed onions before the meat is added.

A filling, flavorful chili. I used ground chicken rather than beef to make it more healthy, and used a mixture of red and yellow pepper to make it more colorful. And I found that the cooking time was way too long — after ten minutes of simmering it started burning and sticking to the bottom of the pot. Once you do all the browning and sauteing doesn't need more than 15 cooking time tops. 
I served it over rice which was interesting; next time I may try mashed potatoes.
