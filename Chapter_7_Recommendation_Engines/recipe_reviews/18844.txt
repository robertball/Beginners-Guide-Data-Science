added the garlic powder and worcestire as recommended by another user. also added a layer of mozzarella cheese with the bacon and peas, and that helped a lot...then again, what dish doesn't benefit from a layer of cheese?

With a few minor modifications, this recipe turned out delicious.  I used fresh spinach and sauteed it with garlic and onions.  To the hot dog mixture, I added both tabasco and thyme for flavor.  Additionally, I used vegetarian soy-based hot dogs and bacon.  The final dish was creamy and flavorful, low-fat and high in protein!

This is a kind of fun recipe.  If I had kids, they probably would like it. Like others, I added some Worcestershire sauce and a couple splashes of Tabasco Sauce. Also sauteed some onions and used Mushroom soup with Roasted Garlic. Fat Free Sour Cream and 2% cheese limited the fat. I love the fat free white smoked meat Turkey Hot Dogs...so the recipe is a lot lower fat than the original. Whole Wheat noodles also helped. I diced up some zucchini and added that to the soup mixture as well, to give it some REAL vegetable besides frozen peas. Doesn't hurt to mix it up a bit before putting it in the oven.

Very tasty! I was skeptical but it turned out great! I added some garlic powder to the spinach. I added some cayenne pepper, a dash or two of worcestershire sauce and a tad of tabasco to the soup mixture.  Yummy!

I was not sure about it but had leftover hot dogs from a cookout and gave it a try.  The only things I changed were 1-splashing worchestire sauce over the noodles 2-cooking the spinach with pepper and garlic salt 3-adding a top layer of cheddar cheese and 4-used the real bacon crumbles (for ease).  I also seasoned the top with garlic salt and pepper.  B/f making it i was concerned with the spinach bed, but it was not so spinachy.  The flavors went well together. 
I will try this recipe again for a different taste.  My hubby said that he would have like saurkraut on the side.

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe! We all love hot dogs, and this was such a great way to serve them. I prepared the recipe just as it is written, and I would not change a thing! I will definitely use again.

What a great way to get picky kids to eat different foods!  This casserole tasted GREAT!  I will make it again and again.  Hot dogs can also be interchanged with chicken or turkey pieces and have a more "grown-up" taste!  I loved this recipe and passed it out at work and a couple of moms were so happy that their children ate some green veggies!!!

Weird, but good.  The spinach doesn't really work, though.  I'm going to try broccoli next time.

Hot Dog Noodle Casserole Haiku: "Embarrassed to say, but well, we really liked this. Hey, it's a keeper!" Putting this together had me telling myself that we were going to love, or hate this. It's just THAT weird. And turns out we really liked it. The only thing that I added was 1/3 c. chopped onion and a minced garlic clove that I sauteed in the bacon grease, since the recipe called for bacon on top. I put it together in the morning and didn't thaw the peas - easy enough to just go right from fridge to oven for a little more than 45 min. to warm it through. Next time I'll add significantly more spinach b/c it kinda gets lost at the bottom. I'm sure it would taste awesome w/ kielbasa or another "fancier" kind of meat, but if you've got tons and tons of leftover hot dogs from a kid's birthday party and need something to do w/ them, this is the recipe for you!

These ingredients are things that we like seperately but they do not mix well.  I even added seasonings and substitute whole wheat penne for the egg noodles and corn for the peas.   They just don't seem to mix well and the kids did not like it at all.  We had a huge struggle to get them to eat it.

It was good, but not something I'll make again.  My family was not impressed like others were in the reviews.  It was sad because I had high hopes for it (my kids tend to be picky).

It seemed like an odd combo as I was making it, but it actually tastes pretty good, like a stroganoff with hot dogs.  

I had a lot of venison hot dogs to use up from my husband's hunting trip last year, which is why I was willing to try this unusual recipe.  It's something different to try with hot dogs.

Thank you for posting this one.  My mother used to make this recipe for us when we were growing up.  I made it today for my brother's birthday.  He was so happy!  We didn't like spinach, as children, but would eat it in this dish.

This was pretty good.  It needed something else, maybe cheese.  I used frozen spinach, as well as fresh spinach that I sauteed with fresh mushrooms.  The taste was very light and fresh, maybe because of all the veggies in it. The flavors were not very prominent. I thought it needed to be a bit creamier.  It was good.  It is worth trying once, but I dont think Ill make it again.

While I like the idea of this and love all of the ingredients separately, I was unimpressed by this rather bland casserole.  I can't put my finger on what was wrong with it, but as I ate it, I found myself eating each thing by itself (i.e. I ate all the hot dogs first, then the spinach, etc.).  Sadly, I will not make this again.

My husband and I come from German families but this is the first time we ever had this type of recipe.  We love all of the ingredients but did not like them together.  This just did not taste good at all.  My husband suggested trying this with some type of sausage instead of hot dogs.

I made this with turkey hot dogs and used low sodium canned soup.  Added mushrooms and some grn bell peppers for color.  I also used whole wheat ziti pasta (that's all I had). Worked out well, I'll try this again. My 4 yr old loved it and said, mmm mommy, this is yummy!

This was a great way to induce our children to eat spinach!  I was  pleased with how much healthier this casserole was than the other "hot dog casserole" recipes I  have seen.  It was very good but I felt like it was missing something.  It was nice, bland comfort food, but we like things that are a little spicier.  It kept extremely well in the freezer.  Thanks for sharing this recipe and I would love to see more experienced cooks comment on how to bring a little more taste to the spinach lower half of the casserole.  I used frozen spinach- perhaps that was the problem?

I made this per recipe this evening.  It came out very wet and runny, as though one had put all the ingredients in a bowl and just warmed it with a microwave.  It was too sweet and rather bland for my tastes.  I won't make it again.

'a bland, subtle entry, suitable for patients recovering from surgery.' I liked it better after I picked out the hot dogs.

Not a real good flavor.  I used turkey hot dogs instead of beef.  Edible but not real tasty.

This was 3-stars when it was made.  Tasted like traditional tuna casserole but with hot dogs.  BUT the next day it was awesome.  Unlike tuna casserole it aged well!

I added fresh sliced mushrooms to the sauce and used a 10 ounce package of Usinger's Weiners.  Next time I would add more bacon.  It was definitely different in a good way.

I used canned spinach, added some garlic, minced onion, and Worsch sauce, subbed sour cream with greek yogurt, and added some mozz cheese (8 oz).  Used smoked turkey sausage instead of hot dogs (just using what I had).  It was fine.  Nothing that anyone will be excited for me ot make again, but worked OK for dinner.

I heard my husband screaming from the basement, where he was watching football with this dinner in front of him: "The best dinner ever!" It just seemed like a flexible recipe (not to mention "strange").  I figured a bit of tweaking wouldn't hurt!  I sautéed a 10-oz. bag of fresh spinach in 1 T. of bacon fat (it's the only bacony thing I had in the house). After a few minutes, I added minced garlic cloves, and then a bit of German (Riesling) wine, Worcestershire, and cracked pepper. Placed in buttered casserole and topped it with 8 oz. cooked macaroni and diced Mozzarella. Next layer -- the hot dog/creamy mixture, topped with more Mozzarella. Baked as directed, but rather than use peas the last few minutes of baking, I covered the casserole with French Fried Onion Rings and served the veggies on the side. Did not expect this taste sensation, but it was incredibly delicious!

I was looking for a recipe for leftover hotdogs and this was great!  I made a few changes and the best one was using creamed spinach in the steam bag!  Then instead of layering I just mixed everything together including the bacon bits and mozzarella cheese.  It came out nice and bubbly and really hit the spot!

My kids went nuts over this.  The only things I changed was french style grn beans as I had no spinach on hand and used ziti because had no egg noodles. Making 4 kids happy virtually never happens here, so this is a winner.
