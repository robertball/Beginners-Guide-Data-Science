I have made something like this with the exception of one ingredient. My recipe calls for Chili Sauce (looks like ketchup) instead of salsa. Actually I made it for my family after a friend brought it to a party at my home.  It was such a big hit.  When she came she brought saltines to use to dip it with.  I figured she just didn't have other crackers so I got out the fancy type. Come to find out nothing is better than a plain ole saltine with this wonderful dip.  This will store in the refrigerator for 4 days. It is best made several hours in advance so the flavors meld.

This is a great recipe.  I have made a similar one before but could not find the recipe.  The only change is that I made mine without ketchup but used chili sauce. This is great with either saltines or tortilla chips.

This is almost like I make mine minus the garlic and salsa verde. Gotta have Tapatio and ketchup, too. I also add cucumber and imitation crab meat to mine. Must eat with saltines.

I’ve made this recipe many times! The only adjustments I made was I used the Clamato with lime in it already. Saved the avocado for right before serving it. Instead of jalapeños I put some Tapatio hot sauce! Really good recipe!

I make this frequently, especially in the summer since it's a light lunch or dinner for those hot summer days when you don't want anything heavy for a meal.

I made according to recipe...no need to make any changes.  Absolutely delicious..husband loved it!  I will make it again just for the salsa.  Of course, as a shrimp cocktail also.

I made this recipe as written for dinner on a hot summer night. It was easy to make and my family thought it was as good as the one we get at a local Mexican restaurant. I served it with tortilla chips and chicken and cheese quesadillas.

This was so easy to make and it taste great! The only modifications I made were no salsa, no salsa verde, no garlic and used 1tsp of hot pepper sauce as opposed to 2.

My bride thought it was a bit "hot" as I added a bit of habanero sauce, and added chopped celery instead of cucumber.  Almost as good as some of the best that I have had in Mexico.    I have frozen the sauce, and will try it again with left over sauce, just adding more avocado and new shrimp.   I'll let you know if this is good, or a no no.

Wonderful Mexican Shrimp cocktail. I took it as an appetizer for a party this weekend and everyone loved it. I let it sit for about 4 hours before serving it so the flavors could meld. For best results,  add the avocado right before serving or it. Wonderful!

Very nice recipe and, if quality ingredients are used, very authentic.  Like most spicy dishes, it "warms up" the next day.

Absolutely delicious!  Rave reviews by my guests!  I didn't have the Roma tomatoes so I used a can of petite diced tomatoes. I also used only 1/2 tsp of Tabasco sauce instead of the 2 tsps of hot pepper sauce, because I prefer a milder taste.  It was wonderful!

Wonderful dish!  Sauce is perfect!  I added a ;little fresh corn cut off the cob.  Important to not put the avocado in unit just before you serve it so it doesn't make the sauce  too creamy.   Made this dish twice in one week per request.  Thank you!
