I know what the recipe is supposed to accomplish, but it just doesn't do it.  When prepared as written, it'll take you forever to get the sauce to thicken and you'll end up losing so much of the sauce that you'll wonder why you bothered.  And the sauce is just too bland.  I spent as long trying to fix the recipe as I did making it.

My basic suggestions are to replace the oil you saute the garlic and onions with "I can't believe it isn't butter".  It makes a difference.  Secondly, when making the sauce, first add 3 TBL of the butter substitute with the 3 TBL of flour, and heat and whisk it until the butter melts and the flour breaks up.  THEN add the milk and the stock, s&p, whisking constantly as you bring the liquid to a boil.  By the time it boils, the sauce will have thickened quite well (actually you might need to thin it a bit with more milk and stock) and you'll have made a basic white sauce.  Then, add a dash of powdered mustard, red pepper, and garlic (the garlic flavor needs to steep into the mixture a bit better and more "Alfredo" like).  I added basic Italian seasonings for fun.  And I think I doubled the amount of Parm. cheese.

I think most people will be far more pleased with the resulting sauce and it sure is a lot faster to make.  Plus, since the sauce you make is a basic white sauce, you can add what you want without messing it up.

Fantastic and so easy!  I omitted the onion but added 4 more cloves of garlic and some red pepper flakes.  Sauted 2 chicken breasts cut into strips with the garlic.  Removed the chicken when browned and added flour and a little salt and pepper to taste.  Cooked this roux for about 2 min.  Then added the broth and 2% milk, brought to slow boil to thicken, added freshly grated parmesan and stirred to melt.  Added chicken strips and allowed to heat through.  Delicious - I can't imagine making a traditional Alfredo sauce - too heavy!  Thank you Dorothy!

i was looking for a way to enjoy one of my favorites, alfredo, without the guilt trip that usually follows. this is the answer!!! this alfredo is creamy and YUMMY!! i used a can of evaporated skim milk, (plus about 1/2 c. skim milk- to equal 2 c.) to give it a little more creaminess. i think it also helps with the thickening, because i didn't have problems like other reviewers. fixing the broccoli with the pasta works great! i've served this with both shrimp and chicken; both get gobbled up quickly! this is a KEEPER!

This recipe had incredible flavor.  I used whole wheat pasta, and also added 2 cups of fresh chopped spinach when I made this and the dish was wonderful.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was ok. I had to use 2% milk it was all I had. The sauce took forever to thicken. I would just assume make the original.

Being from the south I made a rue adding the flour to the onion and garlic - then added the liquid. Since I made it with shrimp instead of chicken I left out the broth and added a bit more milk, salt and pepper. My husband loved it!

YUM YUM YUM!!! This is a fantastic light recipe, you can't even tell that it's "light". I sauteed mushrooms with the onion & garlic, & added grilled chicken breast & it was wonderful! Thanks for a great recipe!

I followed some suggestions from other readers and omitted the onion and used 3 large cloves of garlic.  This was so delicious and you didn't feel "cheated" as with some light recipes.  This will be a regular at our house!

I've been looking for an easy, yet tasty Alfredo sauce I could use with broccoli, chicken, shrimp, etc., and this is perfect.  I used Carb Counter milk (my guilty conscience)and cornstarch.  It was delicious.  Will add this to my recipe file for safekeeping!!

What a fabulous recipe!  I wasn't even looking for low-fat, but after reading the ingredients realized that they're sooo much cheaper than a traditional Alfredo, and are all things that I usually have on hand.  Very flavorful - my husband and I both loved it (we added a grilled chicken breast to top it off).  A skimpy half recipe was a good size for both of us, with a bit leftover.

I halved the recipe, added cooked chicken and made the whole thing gluten free by using Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free All Purpose Baking Flour and Ancient Harvest Gluten Free Quinoa Spaghetti.  Like others suggested doing, first I made a roux by melting 2 tablespoons of butter (use 4 tablespoons for the full recipe) and then stirring in the flour and allowing that to cook for several minutes before I added in the milk and broth, both in several separate amounts to allow the roux to thicken up and absorb the liquids.  Stir constantly over medium heat and it thickens up very quickly each time after adding in the liquids.  Then I added the cooked garlic/onion mixture and cheese to the roux and also then added in about a cup of cooked shredded chicken (I bought a fully cooked rotisserie chicken breast from the grocery store).  Only after adding in the chicken to the sauce did I throw the pasta in the boiling water, so as to allow the chicken to absorb the flavors of the sauce for the full nine minutes of boiling the spaghetti.  After draining the cooked pasta and broccoli, I put them back in the still warm pot and poured the chicken alfredo sauce over it all and tossed it all together.  I also increased the salt and pepper from the recipe.  Next time I will add some red pepper flakes to cook with the garlic to add a bit more flavor.  Excellent dish that my family adored!!!

This is the best low fat alfredo sauce I have yet to make.  I should've read the reviews first though - mine did come out a little thin - i tried adding a bit more flour, but didn't want to ruin the great taste.  Next time I will read the reviews first to learn how to thicken it - but wow - yum yum

I was looking for a healthier way to make one of my favorite dishes but this is just not good. I knew I would have to add seasonings to it but the sauce never thickened to my liking. Even though I did as others suggested. I did like the broccoli and pasta.

Love this recipe.  Makes a yummy Alfredo sauce that doesn't make you cringe thinking of the calories.  To get the sauce to thicken, I saute my onions in butter and add the flour to first before adding the milk.  Never had a problem getting the sauce to thicken when making it this way.

Well I liked my version - lol!  I added chicken which I browned first with salt, pepper and garlic powder. Made the sauce with fat free half and half, made a roux with som eoil and the flour in with my onion/garlic mixture before adding the liquids. I added the broccoli in with my pasts (penne) and also some sliced dry packed sun dried tomatoes.  Nice meal.

This was awesome!  I did omit the onions, used 1% milk and added more garlic, chicken, parsley, a little more cheese and a extra TBSP of flour.  Nice to see a recipe without TONS of butter.  Did not feel guilty after I was done eating.  Great recipe!

Minor changes: heated butter and sauteed onion and garlic. Whisked 3 tbsp melted butter with 3 tbsp flour in a saucepan. Once I had a roux, I added the milk, chicken broth, and salt/pepper. Along with the parmasan, I added a dash of powdered mustard, garlic powder and Italian spice.

I thought this was pretty good.  In general I think alfredo sauce doesn't taste like much more than butter and cream.  This wasn't too different.  I did make a few changes.  I didn't want to use so many pots so first I started the pasta.  While that was going I sauted the onion, garlic and oil.  When that was limp to golden brown I added the flour.  I stirred that until it was all blended then added the liquid.  For liquid I used a can of evaporated skim milk, a can of water and a teaspoon of chicken broth base which would be like chicken boullion.  I added the pepper and a dash of cayenne pepper too. When that came to a boil I added the cheese.  My kids liked it and I thought it was good.  I'm not a fussy eater just happy when my kids eat without complaining.

Yummy - what a way to make "alfredo" and save yourself the calories!  I cut up two chicken breasts, coated them in flour and italian seasonings, and sauteed them with the garlic and onion.  I added a little bit of the broth and cooked the flour in at this point to make a roux, then added the milk and rest of the broth slowly - sauce thickens up very quickly this way.  Could use a bit more salt and pepper but I like my food salty (no high blood pressure worries here :)).  At the end mixed in some steamed carrots and frozen peas along with the pasta and sauce, topped with chicken, voila!  Served with salad and bread - a dish worthy of company :)

Excellent! Took other reviewers suggestion and used cornstarch instead of flour. Next time (for a change) I am going to use less onion and more garlic. Thanks for a great light recipe

JEUSHAGIRL's review from 2005 is spot on.  I made the sauce as stated and it was pretty bland.  I could actually taste the flour, and that on top of the pasta was a bit too much.  I used asparagus for the vegetable - and a lot of it! - and added a pinch of red pepper flakes.   This certainly wasn't horrible - for what it is (a healthy substitute for alfredo sauce) it's ok.  But it needs something else, whether it's butter/butter substitute, more parmesan, more garlic, herbs or maybe even replacing a little of the broth with white wine.  It strays a little from the classic alfredo sauce, but I think it would taste better.

I made this recipe last night and followed many of the suggestions listed and it came out fabulous.  The changes I made were: more garlic, more parmesan cheese, more black pepper and I added a little crushed red pepper flakes.  

I was also able to make this a two pan meal.  One pot for the pasta, and a large skillet for everything else.  I completed step one, but added sausage, mushrooms, grape tomatoes and peas.  In a small bowl, I mixed well the items in step 2 with a whisk and then slowly added it to the large skillet  (on Medium heat).  It did thicken up without problem after about 3-5 minutes of cooking.  I then added the pasta, more black pepper and more parm. With warm bread and a salad...Delicious!

Yum. You really need ALOT of patience for this. I kinda changed things a tad bit. I completely omitted the first step with the onion,garlic,oil mix. Decided to make a roux with equal parts butter and flour, then the milk and broth. Seasoned with garlic,pepper,very little salt, and a pinch of nutmeg.After stirring for awhile, I ended up adding some cornstarch to help it thicken. Used a mixture of romano and parmesean. We ate this with shrimp and roasted red peppers. Needless to say,it came pretty close too the real thing without all the guilt.

This recipe is enjoyable and easy to prepare with ingredients you normally have in the house. Using cornstarch makes it very quick to thicken.  I sauteed bacon pieces with the onion and garlic and it added a great flavor.This is a basic recipe with which you can add a little imagination and go a long way!

I used 3 tbsp cornstarch as others suggested and cooked the sauce over medium heat.  It didn't take long to thicken. Yes, strong on the onion, but we like that.  I will definitely cook this again.  Better than buying the store pre-made packages, and I will always have the ingredients on hand as you don't need heavy cream.

My family loved this! I wasn't actually looking for an Alfredo recipe when I found this one--I was trying to find a recipe that would use up the broccoli I had. I liked this though because it uses ingredients that I tend to have on hand. I wasn't necessarily going for low fat so I used butter in place of oil and 2% milk for added flavor. I blended the flour into the cooked onion/garlic to create a roux as others had suggested and it thickened up just fine. I also used fresh broccoli.
My kids said they actually liked this Alfredo better than the one I make with heavy cream! The texture is much better.

I found that combining the first two steps in this recipe, so as to make a "rue-like" sauce, it cut down a lot on the thickening time, and well as lessened the chance for lumps in the sauce!

Yummy!  I made this for dinner last night and we both enjoyed it.  You must go into making this recipe understanding it won't taste just like alfredo made from cream and butter, but it's delicious nonetheless.  I scaled the recipe to 4 (which is enough for 2 dinner sized portions), left out the onion and garlic since alfredo sauce is supposed to be very smooth but added 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder as well as some dried parsley, and found it needed twice as much salt.  I also used whole milk, since that's what we had. Unlike some other reviewers, I had absolutely no problem with it thickening.  In fact, I only used 1 tablespoon of flour and it thickened up right away!  Since I wasn't cooking any onion or garlic, I left out the oil (added 2 tablespoons of low fat margarine, but this was unnecessary) and instead of making a roux, I simply brought the broth and all the milk but half a cup to a boil, stirred the remaining milk and flour together in a cup, and stirred the mixture into the boiling liquid.  This is a delicious sauce that  I'll surely make often as it's cheap (provided you regularly keep parmesan on hand anyway), pretty healthy and can be made in the time it takes the water for the pasta to boil.

This was fantastic.  I will never use butter and cream again!  I actually liked it better becuase it was not as heavy and didn't leave me with a stomach ache after.  Will use for a chicken spinach alfredo lasagne.  Thanks so much.

I found this recipe to be very good.  The sauce did take a while to thicken, but was worth it in the end.  I added chicken to it for some extra flavor.  I consider myself a pretty picky eater especially when it comes to textures, and this recipe was just fine.

This was AMAZING! I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and used one can of skim evaporated milk and a half cup of skim milk. The sauce was perfectly thick. I also added 3 cloves of garlic instead of one...perfection! Will definitely make this again.

This recipe was amazing - my boyfriend couldn't believe it was light!  Instead of the parmesan, I used 4 wedges of Laughing Cow garlic and herb cheese, and it turned out wonderfully.  Also, when the initial white sauce is cooking, it's best to bring the sauce to a simmer before you add it to the onion mixture - it thickens up much better that way.

I have been making alfredo like this for a couple years since I saw Rachel Ray do it.  Its not quite as rich as traditional but its tasty and a great way to have something I like without all the fat and calories.  Ive even started replacing some of the milk in my mac and cheese with broth and its so much better.

I have never attempted alfredo sauce except with a seasoning packet before, and I was very happy with the results from this recipe!  I enjoyed the fact that I could use milk and didn't have to use cream.  I took other reviewers' advice and added more garlic.  I didn't use any onion because I was out.  And I did make a change in that I used a mixture of butter and oil in making the rheu(sp?), before adding the flour and then the turkey broth and milk.   Cooking the broccoli with the Penne pasta was a great shortcut and worked out well. I added some cooked chicken to make it a meal and served it with a salad.  Very satisfying! My children, from my 19 month old to my teenager loved it (as well as my hubby)!  I will be making this again.

i was hesitant to try this after reading some reviews, but i made lots of changes, and it came out AMAZING- followed previous reviews and made a roux, still took a while to thicken (i ended up adding some extra flour to speed it up)- i added chunked chicken breast and it was delicious! could barely tell the difference from the full fat alfredo sauce! i will definitely make it again!

This was a very good recipe , just what i was looking for.  I added about a cup and a half of mushrooms to the sauce, it was delicious.  I also grilled some chicken with a bit of rosemary and out it on top of the pasta , it was a great addition.

I have found my Alfredo sauce!!!!!  I have been looking for a light and good tasting sauce.  I left out the onions because that is an absolute no no at my house.  I added some garlic straight to the sauce.  BBQ some chicken and steamed the broccli-we like it crunchy!  It was great and everyone said it was a keeper!

This recipe made a good sauce, but it wasn't really alfredo-y. Way too much onion flavor to be called alfredo, and I only used half an onion. It also took much longer than expected to thicken. I kept waiting, and eventually added cornstarch. The cornstarch helped it thicken, but dulled the flavor of the sauce. If I make it again, I'll leave out the onion, use a lot more garlic and cheese, and start earlier to allow time to thicken.

Delicious! I didn't follow the recipe to a T--
Just tasted as I went and made adjustments as needed. Didn't have vegetable broth but didn't need it, as the milk was enough liquid and added basil + more garlic for flavor. After it started to thicken I turned off the heat and let it sit for 5 minutes, which helped thicken more. The man LOVED IT--gobbled it up! Perfect with spinach, broccoli and asparagus. Will add white beans next time to round out the meal.

The taste is FABULOUS, which (for us) made up for a lack of thickness in the sauce. Even so, the sauce was decently thick. 
I did make a few adjustments to the recipe based on other reviews that seemed to help...
Added 1 TBS of cornstarch
Mixed in grilled chicken
Only added a tablespoon or so of onion
Added salt to noodles, sauce
Also, in the last few minutes before serving, I brought the sauce to a boil before adding the parmesan. 
Definitely worth making and enjoying!!

Turned out pretty well! I skipped the onions, and cooked 3 garlic cloves with 5 large mushrooms in a bit of water and OXO. Took them out of the pan, then added the milk and flour to remaining liquid. I also added about a teaspoon of corn starch. 

Didn't take very long at all to thicken up - added the parm, mixed and added the mushrooms. My husband was thrilled, he didn't even know it was a light alfredo.

This was SO good!  I mainly made this for the sauce.  I used rotini pasta and did zucchini for the broccoli.  My sauce came out nice and thick, although I did use 1% milk.  Delicious and great flavor!

Enjoyed this very much. Made a few changes. Since I need Gluten Free I used brown rice flour. I used fresh broccoli, and quinoia fettuccine. I also added chicken leftovers. It was awesome, will definately make again!  Thanks for the recipe!

I think this is a great alternative if you are looking to lighten up Alfredo and not have so much guilt after eating it.  I made this tonight without onions because my 5 year old daughter was eating it.  Other than that I was able to get my comfort food fix and not feel bad about it.  Thanks for the great alternative!

This turned out really good - I added peas and carrots, used 2% milk instead of skim, and added broiled chopped chicken breast - will be making again!

This is a good base but is better using extra virgin olive oil, fat free condensed milk, and organic orfree-range chicken broth. I use at least three times as much garlic and a little more cheese over the top. You really don't need more thickener if you use more cheese. If you simmer it, it thickens nicely.

I brought this to a pasta-bar-pot-luck and it was the first sauce gone. Really good especially with chicken.

This was really good. I served it over spinach fettucine and added some boneless chicken breasts on top that I oven fried.  Very good and I didnt have any issues with my sauce thickening.

delicious!!! I just went to olive garden and ordered fettuccine alfredo, and oh my God this recipe closely resembles the taste of the alfredo sauce i had at that restaurant! I did what one of the previous reviewers suggested, and mixed a can of evaporated milk and half a cup of skim milk to make up for the two cups of milk in the recipe, and it turned out great!! :D

Wow.  I was looking for a quick recipe and feel like I hit the jackpot.  Like others, I used 2% milk as I didn't have skim.  I squeezed some more garlic into the milk/broth mixture and probably used twice the parm.    Browned chicken with garlic, onion, parsley, rosemary and thyme.  Added in some sun dried tomatoes. Removed the chicken from the skillet.  Added the broth to the skillet to thicken, which it did quite nicely.  Added the chicken back and used penne.    Reminded us of a local restaurant favorite Penne Al Pollo. Try this one.

I used the sauce portion of this recipe to build a chicken alfredo pizza. I used fat free half & half instead of skim milk, fresh sliced mushrooms, green peppers and purple onions. Turned out pretty good!

I used fat free half-and-half instead of water, and it had plenty of flavor with the chicken broth.  I didn't use any flour and used cornstarch instead.  Great recipe and thickened up in no time!

Normally I would say it's not worth the effort but since I can't really eat the creamy stuff in regular alfredo, I would make this again. I did put in lemon pepper as well as add extra parmesan cheese. It did take awhile to thicken up and I did put in an extra tablespoon of flour because I was worried it wouldn't thicken up. The sauce was pretty good but not awesome.

Good but a little bland.  I added some red pepper flakes at the end, 2 tablespoons of half and half and more garlic.  might try adding some lemon juice next time.  also added shrimp and it was delicious.  Thank you!

Thought this was pretty good for a light recipe. I added peas and chicken instead of the broccoli. Kids liked it too. Will make again, but next time I'll figure out how to use less pots!

This was a decent sauce but it took forever to thicken.  I substituted the broccoli for chopped fresh mushrooms and used 2% milk in place of the skim.  I also served it over spaghetti instead of fettuccine.

I've never been a fan of alfredo sauce, and so this light (flavour and calorie) version was perfect.  i did add some extra seasoning, paprika/nutmeg/cayenne as others suggested, which really helped the flavour.  And it did use a lot of pots and dishes..not my favourite, but I would make it again.

Good basic sauce. I followed the suggestions of other readers and used butter to sautee the  garlic (used a couple more cloves); created a roux; and nearly doubled the parmesan cheese.

Hard to believe this is low-fat!  Wonderful!  Instead of cooking garlic & onion separately, I simply mixed two to three teaspoons of garlic-infused olive oil into the chicken broth.  Didn't want to use up all the milk in the fridge, so used low-fat evaporated milk (1 cup low-fat evaporated milk plus 1 cup water).  Will definitely make this again & again!

I also added a total of 3 garlic cloves and substituted cornstarch for the flour.  I still think it was missing something flavorwise, but I am not sure what.  I added an extra 1/2 cup of cheese and used fresh broccoli and tri-colored rotini.  Since I added extra cheese, I cut the oil in order to maintain a lower fat content.  I sauteed the onion and garlic in some chicken broth instead.  I will try this again, but will use more garlic and some cayenne or red pepper flakes.

ADD EGG!!!  I suppose I am spoiled by my mother's recipe that is made with half & half & 3 eggs in the sauce.  I added 2 eggs to the sauce and still felt the sauce was lacking flavor.  Too much onion, tasted powdery, & ultimately not good.  Some things were just not meant to be made light.  I will never make this again.

I added corn starch to thicken. Also added chicken. This made a lot of pasta, but that's ok, it made for good left-overs. Very yummy, will make again.

Excellent low fat version!  I used 1 1/2 cups skim milk and 1/2 cup fat-free
half and half for extra richness.  Fresh parmesan cheese makes all the
difference!

I added more garlic since I am a huge garlic lover.  Made it exactly as the recipe stated.  Sauce did take a while to thicken but worth it.  I also added turkey bacon but next time I will add chicken.  Very good light recipe

I felt the same way as far as the sauce taking too long to thicken, I added chicken to my recipe.  And, my family needed to add a bit of salt to it also, just a bit to bland for them.  I did like the lightness and included a bit of parsley and Italian seasoning also!   I'll probably  make it again, but thicken it  differently and season it just a little bit more.

Excellent!!!  I'm watching my weight for our upcoming wedding and am having a hard time finding meals to cook that are both low calorie and make my fiance happy.  I made this last night with a few modifications and he had no idea that it was a healthier version of what I normally make.

Based on some of the recommendations I used a can of 2% evaporated milk and 1/2 cup 1% milk.  I also used Ronzoni Garden Delight rotini and a mixture of broccoli, cauliflower and carrots.  To spice it up...I added crushed red peppers.  

I was happy because it was light on the calories and my guy was happy because he couldn't tell that it was a low cal meal!!!

I added bits of chicken in as well and left out the onion, using instead a bit of onion salt. Even with the changes, my husband and I still loved it.  However, it could use a bit more flavor.  Next time I'll add a few other spices as the sauce thickens (oregano, coriander, and a bit of garlic salt).  This is will definitely become a regular meal at our house!

As is, three stars but addition of garlic, extra salt, and more thickener will make it a 5 star.

i was hoping for a good lower fat version of alfredo, but this was pretty bland. I omitted the onion and used 3 cloves of garlic instead, maybe the onion is the key?

I would give this 5 stars bc my husband and 2 yr old loved it....but to get it to 5 I had to make quite a few changes....definitely triple the garlic-replace the veg. oil with butter-double the cheese-add garlic powder and red pepper flakes...as for the cooking method as others mentioned it takes 20-30 min to thicken the sauce on low....higher the temp and if it doesn't get thick add a bit of flour/milk paste to thicken.  Overall-very good!

This was so yummy!!! I made it exactly how the recipe was here with no changes and my husband loved it! The only thing I'll do differently next time is double the garlic. We both love garlic and you didn't really get any kind of hint of the flavor here. Thanks for this recipe!

Exactly what I was looking for! I'm trying to lose weight, but I was really craving some alfredo and this just hit the spot.

This is the only recipe I use when I want an Alfredo sauce!  I can't stand Alfredo sauce from a jar (any brand), so I am glad to have found this.  I do a couple of things differently than the original recipe.  I make this all in one pan (less clean-up).  After I add the broth, milk, salt and pepper to the sauteed onion/garlic, I mix the flour with some water in a small dish and then pour that into the saucepan.  In my experience, that helps thicken it much better.  I also stir in a pinch of nutmeg just before serving. I omit the veggies and serve this pasta dish with salad.

I haven't tried this yet, but I will.  My only question is, if a person making this sauce is lactose intollerent, then why are you using Parmasean cheese?  I can't use anything dairy, so I would have to use a soy based cheese product and margarine.

did not thicken, finally added a jar of store-bought alfredo, and milk/cornstarch combo.  Seasoning was not right either.  :-/  Wasn't too bad after all the changes.

I have made this several times.  While it is not your true homestyle alfredo, it is very good and has very good flavor...and is simply much much healthier.  If your sauce isn't thickening, bump up the heat a little and/or add a little thickening agent (flour or corn starch).  It's not a super thick, creamy sauce, so don't stand around waiting for it to get that thick...there is no butter and cream, so you have to sacrifice thickness a little.  This is great warmed up as leftovers, also.  I suggest giving it a try if you're trying to eat healthier and love pasta.

Used this for the sauce only, and added it to a baked pasta dish.  I created a roux with the oil and the flour first and fried the onion in it, then added the remaining ingredients.  I had to use a little more than 2tsp of oil though, so perhaps it wasn't the low fat alternative.  We did it this was to get the onion to cook down a bit as my wife doesn't like the taste of onion.  I'd make it again.

Absolutely amazing! YUM Great taste without the guilt. I made this as suggested: without the onions, increase garlic cloves to 3 -4.  Also, added chicken tenders while sautéing garlic in butter.

Good stuff....my favorite part was that I had everything on hand.  Added Chicken and served with a green salad.  Yummy. Did have to end up adding more flour though.

This recipe was pretty good.  After reading all the reviews about it not getting thick quickly, I decided to add one more tablespoon of flour and one tablespoon or cornstarch.  I also added red pepper flakes and much more garlic.  It was pretty good!

This was pretty good. We also made it with peas instead of broccoli because that's all I had.. but I have been wanting to have Alfredo without using cream cheese.. etc.  This was yummy.  It did take forever to thicken.. shoulda read the reviews before I made it.. but  I used some corn starch and a little extra flour and things worked out.

I made this for my girlfriend and I for each of us to take to work during the week.  We both loved it, and it's a money saver too.  I used 4 cloves of garlic rather than 1, as some people suggested, and also minced the onion and garlic in the food processor.

I'm sorry, but I guess I'm in the minority on the reviews for this recipe! Our family thought it was pretty tasteless (the sauce). I found it difficult to thicken and had to add more flour than called for. We wanted more of a substantial meal so I added some pre-cooked (Perdue) chicken. No matter...nothing seemed to help this recipe! I know it's supposed to be light, but there has to be something more to this sauce! I will continue to look for a light(er) version of alfredo!

This was good but needs more spices. We added 3 cloves of garlic and it still did not give it enough flavour. The sauce was also slightly too thin. You can probably fix this problem by just adding slightly less liquid; maybe 1/4 cup milk. I will make this again but i will get creative with my spices and probably add fresh mushrooms :)

This recipe was amazing.  A little tweaking of spices for my personal taste, but that was about it.

I read that some people had issues with thickening the sauce.  I made sure the flour was well whisked in, and then cooked over a medium temperature, basically simmered it for a minute or two, and it thickened right up.

This was DELICIOUS!!!! I didn't add the brocoli(my kids and boyfriend doesn't like it) I did add chicken, and i doubled the recipe and used 2 cups of parmesean cheese. It was awesome!!!! And this was the first time I made homemade alfredo sauce, No more buying it in the stores for me......

I was really unimpressed with this dish and so was my husband.  Obviously I wasn't expecting it to taste like regular alfredo but we didn't care for it!  I tried adding things to give it more flavor such as pancetta & asparagus but nothing could save this dish.

This was good but I had to do things a bit differently. I attempted to make the sauce twice. The first time the sauce never thickened. It was seriously taking way toooooooo long. The second time I just added the flour and some of the broth to the onion mixture to make it thicken. Then I added the rest of the broth and slowly added in the milk allowing it to thicken even more, then adding the rest of the milk. The only thing I did not like about this recipe was the texture. While my husband loved the parmasean cheese texture, I found it to be a bit overwhelming and almost unappetizing. I think next time I will not put as much cheese in the sauce. I needed to add a lot of pepper and salt, a lot more than the recipe called for to give this dish some flavor.

I thought this was very good--much better than my own fat-filled original.  My 4 year old asked for more. I did some tweaking for personal taste.  I added chicken tenders and mushroom to the saute and left out the broccoli (didn't have).  I did have to add some corn starch to the sauce just for personal appearance.  Smelled so good while cooking that hubby had to come in the kitchen to see what was going on.  Only difference I would make next time would be to cut down on the onions a little and add more garlic.  This one is definitely a keeper.  BTW, hubby even bragged to HIS mom about it.

Unfortunately, I just didn't like this recipe.  Took too much time for a below average sauce.  The texture was gluey, and the flavor was pretty bland, even though I added extra garlic.  Not really comparable to Alfredo sauce.    Plus, it used 3 pots!  Just not worth it at all.

Great! I love alfredo but not that it's fattening. I found this sauce to be a little different from alfredo.

Quick & easy recipe. I would double the salt and add additional spices/herbs to give it more taste. Overall it was good. Next time I will add more seasonings and possibly some mushrooms and I would be able to give it 5 stars! Will be using again and again. Thanks.

This recipe was just ok. We found the taste was bland and the texture too grainy. Won't make this again, I'll stick to the fattening version!

This is a good starting point for a quick sauce that doesn't use cream.  I heat garlic and crushed red pepper in a pan, then add either chicken or shrimp.  Set aside chicken/shrmip once cooked then follow the recipe as it is so it picks up the spice from garlic and red pepper.  Also add some nutmeg and fresh baby spinach at the end - yummy!

This recipe was good, although a tiny bit bland. I think turning it into a pesto, with basil and pine nuts, might spice it up a bit. After reading a couple reviews of people saying it took to long to get thick. I found that bringing the sauce up to a boil and then reducing the heat helped a lot. I made it with the Garlic Chicken Recipes submitted by Carol and the two recipes taste really good together. I just put the chicken over the pasta and then poured a little sauce on it. Since this recipe is lower in fat and doesn't leave you with that heavy feeling makes this recipe is a keeper! It's also easy to play with. Some suggestions would be to add some pureed red peppers to make a creamy red pepper sauce or less cheese for a garlic cream sauce, or canned tomatoes for a tomato cream sauce.

A great alternative to heavy alfredo sauces. After a plate full you aren't stuffed. Add chicken at the end for a complete meal.

This was an excellent alternative to a heavy cream based sauce. Like most people, i didn't think it was going to get thick enough, so i added a little corn starch. however, i won't add the extra thickener next time, after i removed it from the heat, it got plenty thick on it's own. i will certianly try this again!

I know this is a light dish, but a little flavor would be nice. Out of a family of 6, not one asked for secounds of the pasta but asked for more salad and My husband and kids are not big salad eaters. I will not make this again.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe and I will definitely be using it again. I try to fix as many low-fat, low-cholesterol meals as possible, and I knew it was a winner when he looked at me suspiciously and said "You put cream or butter into this, didn't you?" Success! I took the advice of the other reviewers and added an extra tablespoon of flour, and I also added a package of small, pre-cooked shrimp to make it more of a "main dish" meal. It was just as good reheated the next day.

This was a good light alternative to creamy, fatty alfredo sauces. I modified using canola oil instead of vegetable oil, mushroom/vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, fresh broccolli florets instead of frozen, corn starch instead of flour, sea salt instead of regular salt, and soymilk instead of skim milk. I used freshly grated parmesan cheese and and vegetable mix fettucine (normal, spinach, & beet). Turned out delicious!

This is a g-r-e-a-t alfredo recipe! It was light and not too heavy. I omitted the onions and used 2% milk which made it thick quickly...I just worked with the milk I had. I'm saving this one for sure! Thank you!

I Really enjoyed this recipe. However, I am rating it "as is". I findit misleading when people give recipes 5 stars but make 847574899 changes to it :)
 I added extra salt, substituted corn starch, omitted the onion and used a different amount of garlic. I also added broccoli and chicken. I highly recommend experimenting with this sauce. It is definitely worth it!!!

This might be my first negative review on allrecipes. The chicken stock flavor in this sauce seems to be very strong and pungent and onions in an alfredo sauce is very unusual. I followed recipe exactly as followed to assure proper judgement. I'm sure there are tons better out there!

Hmm... well, this was good but not what I expected. Perhaps I did something wrong. My sauce as WAY too watery and it ended up being more like a noodle soup. Also, the flavor was a little bland. But, I paired it with garlic bread and despite everything it tasted really good!

Did this with short notice, so I used onion and garlic powders and added a couple dashes of cayenne and a splash of white wine.  It was absolutely delicious on cheese tortellini and shrimp.  We found it to be very flavorful and will definitely use it again, we'll try scallops next.

Pretty disappointing.  I added extra Parmesan cheese, and still found it very bland.  Maybe with extra garlic or something else added (roasted red peppers, etc.), it would be better.  Like other reviewers, I added a little cornstarch when the sauce did not seem to be thickening.  I understand it will not taste the same without the cream and butter of regular alfredo sauce, but they must be replaced with something else to give it some flavor.

I gave this 3 stars because my kids and my husband liked it.  It was okay for me.  I don't think I would consider this an Alfredo sauce by any means.  It was more like a gravy.  It was good, but if your looking for alfredo, this isn't your recipe.  I felt good eating it because it is lower in fat and will probably make again considering my family enjoyed it, and my son didn't say "this is discusting" like he usually does if it isn't full of sugar however it wasn't my favorite.  I would almost rather consume the calories of regular alfredo sauces.

I played with the suggestions from other reviews and really liked the taste, but it was a bit thin and grainy.  I replaced the oil with margarine, added more garlic, cornstarch instead of flour, and vegetable broth rather than chicken broth.  Served sauce with 'Absolutely Fabulous Portobello Tortellini' and it was quite delicious.

Who needs the guilt associated with Alfredo sauce when this recipe is sooooo good, you would never know the difference!  I used more garlic and fresh grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and white pepper.  I won't make Alfredo sauce any other way now!

This recipe had no flavor. Seperating the onions and garlic from the liquid base strips the strength and it just tastes like a really, really boring white sauce. I added some left over pesto to make it halfway interesting

This recipe was quite bland - it had no flavour.  I am a big fan of using chicken broth in place of some of the fat, and I never eat the true alfredo (way too fattening).  I added an extra garlic clove and some oregano to try and spice it up, but it still ended up tasting like a sauce that is made from an envelope.  Thats waht I'll next time and save some of the work!

I guess I shouldn't have expected much from a light alfredo sauce. Only the 2nd recipe in 7 years of marriage my husband asked me never to make again. I added chicken and other ingredients, but we ended up picking the chicken out and only eating the loaf of garlic bread I got to go with it as dinner

Two thumbs up here!!  I made a couple changes though.  I wasn't looking for a light recipe, so I used 2% Milk.  I ommitted the onions and garlic and replaced them with onion and garlic powder which I seasoned cut up chicken breast with.  I also mixed it all together and baked it with marble cheese, because I had no parmesan.

I think this will be my new standby white alfredo sauce. As per other reviews, I used cornstarch instead of flour, and towards the end of the simmering time, I mixed a half cup water with another Tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken it up. No parmesan on hand, used a block of Fontinella instead and it was delicious.

At the advice of other reviewers, I used cornstarch insteach of flour, and it didn't take long to thicken.  I really missed the typical goopiness of alfredo sauce with this recipe though - guess that's what you get when you use skim milk!  Next time I make it I'll try more cheese, fatter milk, and maybe some salt... Even though it has plenty of onion, it isn't hearty enough for me.

this recipe was good, not great.  i used 1 cup skim and 1 cup fat free 1/2 and 1/2.  it did take a while to thicken, and like another person said, i added starch.  i had mushrooms that needed to be used so they went into the recipe too!  it is not as good as leftovers, so eat up the first time!

My whole family enjoyed this recipe.  I used packaged parmesan cheese--which was not only sold aged, but I had bought it probably a decade ago--so it had a strange taste.  But even then I could tell if I used freshly grated parmesan cheese it would be yummy!  Very satisfying.  A definite keeper.

Although I appreciated the health value of this dish, it didn't seem to satisfy my craving for the artery-clogging traditional alfredo.  However, it was easy and I will make it again.

I was looking for a long time for an Alfredo sauce that tasted like the one they use in the Olive Garden. Not only does this one taste just like it, it is also a light version. The best of both worlds! The only thing I did different was that I added more parmesan to it (about 1/4 cup). Otherwise this was really really good :)

Very flavorful for being pretty low fat.  It took alot longer than I expected but was worth the wait.  I took out the brocolli and served it on the side instead to make it easier for my kids to enjoy, one loved it, the other turned away.

This didn't turn out at all. It took me two hours to make the sauce over a very low heat and once I added the shredded parm cheese it curdled. I had to throw it away.

I have not made this as directed - I use an extra tbsp of flour, no peas. I also just use what ever milk is in the fridge!!
I'm sure this recipe is even better when followed exactly. I recommed this for anyone!!No more packages for us!!

Very delicious, used for chicken florentine so I added pesto sauce, lighter than regular alfredo but in a good way, way better nutritionally, will definitely make again!

It was delicious. I did modify the recipe for 4 - added asparagus and chicken. For the Alfredo sauce I used a clove of garlic (not 1/2), added 1 1/2 tablespoons of butter, olive oil, 3 pinches of Italian seasoning, 2 pinches of red pepper flakes, less salt, 1 tablespoon of flour and a little more pepper.

Made this tonight. Only change is I used "I cant believe it's not butter" instead of vege oil. It did take a long time to thicken (18 min) but well worth the wait. Great taste and there is none left!

This wasn't bad, but it really didn't taste like alfredo sauce. It was actually kind of sweet, and it definitely could have used more spice. I wish I would have read more reviews and realized the high ratings weren't for the posted recipe but for the reviewers' modified versions.

my family loves this recipe.  Made very minor adjustments. Skipped the onion and added extra garlic. Used 1% milk instead of skim. I had no problem with it thickening as some others did. I will add less salt next time and more fresh ground pepper. I used fresh broccoli and also served with chicken, over penne. :)

good recipe,  cut it in half and still made plenty. would rather thicken with a slurry of corn starch rather than flour, otherwise liked it just fine.

Just made this and it was very good!  The only thing I did differently was add Italian Seasoning to the sauce and put fresh diced tomatoes on top.  My hubby and 5 year old loved it! Will make again for sure!

The following is what I changed: 1/8 cup of finely cut onions,1 tbs of minced garlic in olive oil, I used a 14.5 can chicken broth of which I measured 1/4 each time I added gradually added depending on my preference of thin or thickness,4 tbs of flour and this is where I think I went wrong- I used grated parmesan cheese in the jar ( the topping for pizza). I'm new to cooking so this is the only grated parmesan cheese I knew of. In the end the sauce had a good taste but over all had a powered taste. Much like when you add grated parmesan to pizza. I could not eat, but I am eager to try again. I will try this again but with fresh grated/shredded parmesan. I gave three stars because the sauce was ok but that powdery taste just did not go down smoothly-my mistake using wrong cheese.

So good! I also made a roux, added zucchini, spicy sausage, and mushrooms to the garlic. Had some leftover Gorgonzola cheese from a previous meal, added that to the sauce. Was just absolute heaven delicious!!

This is a very nice, simple 'light' pasta dish.  To help it on the healthy side I used whole weat pasta and added green peas (for color) and small shrimp.

I liked this recipe a lot, but I didn't follow it very closely. I forgot to get onions and garlic at the store, and I had even run out of garlic powder, so I started by reconstituting 1 T. of dried minced onions in the broth and used 1 tsp. of garlic salt in place of both the garlic and the salt. Will try to do it properly next time, LOL.

I also found that it didn't thicken the way I wanted, so I added roux (a couple Tbl.). It was still thin, but tasty! I made a double batch and added 1 lb. shrimp, a cubed, steamed zucchini, a can of mushrooms, 1/2 c. chopped spinach (thawed frozen), and 1 c. peas and carrots (thawed frozen). I don't know if that's the way you're supposed to make alfredo or primavera or anything, but it was AWESOME!!! My hubbie NEVER eats leftovers but he was still gobbling this up for lunch the next day.

I added extra garlic, mushrooms, and fresh grated nutmeg to kick it up a bit after reading some of the reviews. I omitted the broccoli and black pepper.  Then I served it over cheese filled tortellini. Mmmmmm Mmmmmm Good!

I was craving the fatty-Alfredo sauce, but dreading the calories and fat content. This recipe is SO LOW FAT, and SO GOOD. I used to think that this sauce was super hard to make, but it took me 20 minutes, and it received so many compliments. Thank you for the idea and the recipe, it was definitly the best and least regrettable Alfredo EVER!!

I had been looking for an Alfredo sauce I could make lactose-free, and this was a pretty good option. I used 1 1/3 cup lactaid milk and 1/3 cup of margarine. I also added a couple dashes of Italian seasoning. I didn't have any broccoli, so I used corn instead. The end result was good. Nothing spectacular, but I enjoyed it.

I thought it was very good and very thick.  I halved the recipe and maybe I used too much pasta to not enough sauce, but it made it very thick.  It was very good and I will definitely make again.

I'm sorry but the only thing that I enjoyed about this recipe was the broccoli.  I felt that the flavor of the sauce (not sure you can call something this runny "sauce") lacked depth.  Although it adds an astronomical amount of fat and calories, using a recipe with cream or half and half is worth it every time.  I don't reccommend this recipe if you are a fan of full-fat, full-flavor alfredo.

Great recipe! Didn't taste like it's light version of Alfredo. I added mushroom, asparagus, and shrimp to complete this pasta dish. Next time I would put more garlic.

this was really good. i changed the following - doubled the cheese (next time i might not bother, cos this turned out really rich), didn't sautee the onion and garlic separately - just added then into the milk and simmered (this meant i didn't have to use the oil) and added a squeeze of lemon juice at the end. this was great - it took a long time to thicken, but was so nice and rich, really delicious. next time i might try using vegetable stock, or adding more lemon. great recipe.

It was great, not heavy. I did find that it wasn't th ick enough , so I added more flour. I took the suggestion not to put the onion and increase the garlic.  I am on Weight Watchers and it was low in points.  I love light recipes.  Dorothy, thanks for the recipe.

The taste was O.K. but I guess if you love Fettuccine Alfredo(the fat one) like I had in Rome Italy, this doesn't quite measure up.  The idea was great but missing something.

It was very good, but nothing special.  Just your basic pasta and white sauce recipe.  The parmesan added a good touch to the sauce though.  I put some sliced pieces of fresh tomatoes on top of the dish as a garnish, it worked out great.  If one does not like broccoli, they can substitute it for carrots and/or peas.  I think that would go good in it too.

Made as stated a bit bland. Will add more garlic and onion.  Filling and easy to make.  Still alot of carbs and sodium.

Very good. I have a similar recipe with only garlic, broccoli and parmezan. Would definitely make this one again as a creamier alternative. I baked onions and garlic, than added flour and other ingredients in the same pan.

This was really good! I followed other reviewers' advice and made a roux using 3 T butter and 3 T flour. I also used a can of evaporated skim milk in place of plain skim milk.  I did not add onions or broccoli.  I bought a hunk of Parmesan at the deli counter and grated it myself. This is a great base recipe that you can customize with the seasonings your family likes.  No one even noticed it was "light."

Added mushrooms and bacon to this and it turned out great. Also added triple the parmesan cheese to make it creamier.

I thought this had a good flavor and was easy to make. I couldn't get it to thicken up, however, so I had to add some cornstarch. I like that you can add whatever you want to jazz it up. I added some chicken and roasted red peppers and it was tasty.

This is a really good and easy base recipe to adapt to individual preferences.  I changed not only the ingredients but the cooking method as well.  Had to tweak it quite a bit for flavor.  Sautéed the onions and garlic, but I made it as a white sauce and bumped the flavor by adding some crushed red pepper, parsley, mozzarella, and a little more  garlic, black pepper and some herbs.  I also used a combination of heavy cream and 2% milk  (thus negating the "light" title.  I was trying for a slightly creamier texture with that and the mozzarella).  I  used mushroom tortellini for the pasta and hubby really liked it.  Had no problem with it thickening. (Note to self, see memos)

Very good and very quick to prepare by consolidating one step.  You don't need another saucepan to prepare the sauce.
When the onions and garlic are browned, make a roux in the same pan.  Add the flour, salt and pepper to the onions; let that cook for a couple of minutes then slowly add the skim milk and broth, stirring constantly until it thickens.  The broccoli in my fridge had faded to an undesirable yellow so I used some raw Brussels sprouts - trimmed and halved and added to the pot of pasta to cook.  I cut the servings to 2 and I would say that if you were to add meat as a side, it would serve 2 very well.  As it is, I've almost devoured the whole amount.  Topped with some extra ground black pepper and fresh grated Parmesan and this is good enough for company.  I've posted a picture and I will make this again.  Thank you to the poster.

This is a good base for a recipe.  I tripled the amount of garlic.  I used olive oil to saute the garlic and onion.  I then added a small amount of  butter and made a roux with the flour.  I omitted the chicken broth.  I only added enough milk to make a thick sauce.   My suggestion would be to "eyeball" the amount, adding a small amount at a time..  I couldn't imagine using as much liquid as the recipe calls for.    I used fresh grated parmesan cheese.   My only regret was that I did not have mushrooms.   I will definitely make this again.

I made a few changes, like marinating the chicken in a lawrys herb and garlic marinade, using evaporated milk and 12 oz of chicken broth which I just poured in the milk can. I also added fresh grated Parmesan, chipotle cheddar, and a 5 cheese Italian blend. For the pasta I used Barilla vegetable pasta! It was absolutely AMAZING!!!

I made this recipe but I did substitute 1 cup of 1/2 because it was in the fridge.  I also cooked the onion and garlic and then added the milk, chicken broth and other ingredients right into the same pan.  It worked wonderfully.  I will definitely use this again.

My kids and husband really liked this. I did not use the chicken broth as other reviewers said it took a long time to thicken. I also used half the amount of pasta so there was more sauce to go around.  This is a definite keeper!

This was just ok.  It is light, but the onion is over rated.  If I make this again, maybe I will try some of the altered recipes in the reviews.

This was a pretty good easy recipe, however next time I'll use a fourth of the onion, or omit them entirely. We are garlic lovers so I used 4 cloves of garlic instead of just 1, but the onion flavor still overpowered it. My husband called it a good onion gravy. 4 stars because it was still yummy, but not 5 because it didn't feel like we were eating alfredo. Thank you for the easy recipe!

This was really good. It was thin, but it did thicken a little as it stood. I didn't add any veggies to mine, but I did add a couple pinches of nutmeg and sprinkled more Parmesan on top. It's tasty. I wouldn't really say it was an "Alfredo" though.

This was great!  I wanted to make some homemade pasta and I found this to make with it.  Watching calories and this was it! I used 1/2 cup white wine and 1/2 cup chicken broth.  I also only used about 1 cup 2% milk.  I actually made a roux in the pan with the onions and garlic.

I doubled this recipe and it didn't really thicken for me.  I added parsley and in my opinion, there was too much onion.  Luckily, I saved this recipe by turning it into a baked mac n' cheese (adding A LOT of cheddar) and then sprinkling breadcrumbs on top and baking it for 30minutes.  Thank God!

This was great for a light alfredo recipe. Hubby loved it and took the leftovers to work (a rarity). I did add a lot of extra salt and some fake bacon bits for the bacon you find in some alfredos. Thanks!

This recipe is a great base for a lite alfredo.  I followed others advice and first made a roux, then added the milk and stock, along with parsley, basil, minced garlic, and red pepper flakes.  After letting it simmer and thicken I added the cheese and it turned out well.  I don't think my boyfriend suspected it was low fat.

I too find this recipe 'as is' to be a bit inferior.  The second time I made it, I perfected it.  Instead of oil, use butter, and instead of salt, use a cube of chicken bullion.  Voile!

For being low fat, this alfredo sauce has great taste! I will never buy the fattening and expensive alfredo sauce again!

This was good for a light version. We just prefer the fattening kind. :)

I made this last night and was impressed.  It came together quickly and had a good flavor.  If you're really craving fettuccine alfredo, this may not do it, though.  If you're looking for a good pasta dish, try it.

I thought this was excellent.  I added some grilled chicken and used egg noodles instead and my husband said it was very good.

This was a great way to make a lower-fat cream sauce.  I used cornstarch, like was suggested in some of the reviews, and it came out nice and creamy.

This was wonderful! My husband and my 3 year old son loved it! I didn't have skim milk in the fridge so I just used 2% and used half an onion instead of a whole one. Great recipe! Will be making again!

I liked the flavors, the ease and the fact that the pasta sauce wasn't too rich. However, the consistency of mine was too thick--next time, I'll follow some of the other reviewers' suggestions and use cornstarch instead.

Pretty good!  It gets a little dry and I used less sour cream.  I think even half a package would work.

Unfortunately I am a chef by previous experience, I found that to make the recipe featured even lighter not to use the "roux" based method using the flour but to use an alternative like creme fraiche which works very well. As for children.well none of mine ever liked brocolli, they don't know just what they are missing.Easiness I should give it a 5 though I am a chef and after any prep, everything is just so "easy"! All in all, very tasty and quite experimental. More recipes pleas Dorothy, BF

This was good. You can change some things if you want.  I use 2% milk not skim milk. If something is not thickening you simply add more cornstarch or flour.  I agree cornstarch is good because you do not have to use as much.

After making this once, my husband and I agreed to throw the recipe away.  It wasn't good at all.  It took FOREVER to thicken.  There was too much onion flavor.  I guess adding onion and taking away the fat content wasn't a good idea.  I would rather haven driven 30 minutes to the Olive Garden, waited in line for 30 min. more and then again for the dinner and the drive back.  At least by then I would have actually eaten something, and something that tasted good!
