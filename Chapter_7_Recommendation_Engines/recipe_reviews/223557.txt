This recipe turned out very well. I added 1 tablespoon of brown sugar because I like my pumpernickel bagels a bit on the sweeter side, and it turned out well. Next time I may decrease the amount of ground coffee just because that flavor came through a bit strong for me, but it could also be the type of ground coffee I used. Also, with regards to the prep time, this definitely took me more like 45 min to prepare, and this wasn't my first time making bagels.

This is the first time I have ever seen a recipe for pumpernickel bagels in the UK. My husband has raved about them in New York where he visited a relative for many years. We went there as a family and tasted them when I saw this recipe I tried it straight away. These bagels are exactly  what we had in New York  a fantastic recipe and it's saves us a lot of money as we were getting them shipped over twice a year from a deli on the lower east side.  A recipe well worth the effort double the mix and freeze half no problem. I added a lot more caraway seed because we love the taste of them.

It was a good recipe to my taste.  I followed the recipe almost as exact.  I got 12 small bagels out of this batch, so I imagine 13 would have been very small.   I would reccommend baking a while longer than listed.  The only things I changed were activating the yeast in brewed coffee (didn't have instant) and letting it rise in the fridge overnight.  The taste was good, but some of my guests complained of a strong cocoa powder  taste.  Would surely make again.

This was my first time making these and these bagels brought me back to NY although I think a few tweaks could be made. I added 2 TSP of vital wheat gluten to the mix. If you have an efficient oven like I do I would drop the temp to 425 and cook slightly longer (if you have a baking stone that is a definite PLUS. I (personally would add more caraway seeds) I would definitely do a 1 egg and 3 TBSP water egg wash over the bagels after they have dried from the boiling water. The bagel insides were slightly wet in some places but because they were hot they continued to cook during the cooling process so don't be alarmed if they seem a little "juicy" in some places. They seemed to be lacking in something taste-wise but I just cannot place what as I have not been to NY in many many many years to have a REAL pumpernickel bagel. They definitely have the denseness of a classic pump bagel which was most certainly a plus. Overall if I can figure out what I am lacking and refine my recipe slightly there is absolutely no reason why these bagels would not deserve 5 stars.

These turned out good. They look great. The kneading took a while and had to add extra bread flour for the gluten to start to develop while kneading.  But I’m not sure what they’re supposed to taste like because I’ve never had one before. I’ll try making these again but will probably use less molasses or substitute it altogether with sugar. The flavor of the molasses was a little too strong. Maybe it’s just me though since I’m not a fan of molasses. Haha. 


Apologies for multiple uploads of the same photo. I can't figure out how to remove them. The photo didn't show at first, do i kept trying to upload.hehe

Great! Will make many more in the future. Used olive oil in place of vegetable oil and no coffee. Perfect!

I modified to simplify this recipe:
3 1/2 cups bread flour
4 tsp active dry yeast
1 1/2 cups warm water
1/2 cup molasses
1 tbs brown sugar
1 tsp kosher salt
1 tbs caraway seeds
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tbs vegetable oil

Mix  brown sugar and water to dissolve in a large mixing bowl; add yeast and let sit 15 minutes to foam. Toast caraway seeds lightly in a pan. Add flower, molasses, cocoa powder, salt, toasted caraway seeds, and vegetable oil and mix until dough comes together (it'll be chunky and awkward looking). Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead continuously for 10-15 minutes. The resulting dough should be even-colored and smooth, with color resembling milk chocolate. Replace into the bowl and let rise until doubled in size, covered at room temperature (45 mins to an hour). Gently deflate the dough, and divide into 8 pieces approximately 3 inches in diameter. Roll into balls, and create a hole roughly 1 inch in diameter. Place onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and allow to bench proof while boiling a gallon of water in a large pot, and preheating the oven to 450F. Once the water comes to a rolling boil, place bagels (they should have puffed up a bit) into the pot 4 at a time, boiling them for 45 seconds on each side (they will float and you shall have to flip them over). Bagels should increase in size. Extract, place back onto the baking sheet and bake at 450F for 10 minutes. Enjoy! (pic added)

Have made this by recipe directions and we loved it, also have put my own touches to it. Our family loves dark rustic breads and flavors.

This was my first time making bagels at home, and wow are they tasty!  I did not have coffee crystals, so I used brewed coffee in place of water.  I was also out of molasses and subbed maple syrup.  The dough was overly sticky so I ended up added extra flour during kneading ~1.5 cups.

Delicious and "worth eating" when they were fresh and warm. They were quite small - if I do this again, I will make about 6 bagels with this recipe.

Very good recipe I altered a couple of ingredients. I used  malt barley instead of molasses and did not add the coffee. I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I used bread flour in place of all purpose. 
I also added malt and baking soda to the bioling water.  Was a little sticky I most likely will add the couple of teaspoons of vita flour next time. Yummy

I liked this recipe, but I would suggest about 1/4 cup less water (then adding it as needed) and some sugar (about 1 tbsp.) to make it sweeter.  Otherwise, a good recipe.

I added 1 Tbsp. of brown sugar and 2 tsp. gluten.  I also egged the top.  The texture is amazing and they taste delicious.  But, the recipe does not make 13 bagels unless you are making them tiny.  I made 12 and they are equivalent to size as the minis that get sold in the store.
