Super tasty. Had just enough for leftovers (which I usually dislike) and it was just as yummy.

My hubby loved it. 
I couldn’t get the sauce to thicken up so I added a couple TBLSP of flower.

Added carrots and peas, I think the frozen peas slightly diluted the sauce. Quality of Dijon used is integral to this dish. I’ll make it again
