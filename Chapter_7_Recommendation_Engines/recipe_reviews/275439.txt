Just had this for lunch today and have to say that this quiche has great texture and flavor.  Except for adding around 1/3 C. of Mexican Cheese Blend and more basil than it calls for, I made this to recipe.  Will be warming the leftovers for breakfast in the morning.  My hubby, who isn't a big quiche fan, thought it was good!  Thanks Kim's Cooking Now for a tasty recipe!!

Great recipe. The only adjustment I made was to sprinkle mozzi cheese over the crust before baking to seal it. Keeps the crust from getting soggy. Instead of putting the cheese on the crust before you bake you can sprinkle the cheese over the baked crust before you put the filling in.

It turned out beautiful. I made for company this past Sunday morning. It was great. I got nervous when I removed from oven because it was Sunk in a little in the middle of quiche. As it cooled it poofed  up again.  Tasted great. Next time I will add more onion. If I was having for dinner I would add a little something along with onions and spinach. Perhaps some red pepper and maybe even some mozzarella cheese. I used fresh dried basil from my garden. I was truly happy with this recipe and results. Hope you all will try it!!!

I've made it twice. Once per the recipe in a pie crust, which was delish, and once with no crust but a half cup of Carb Quik added to fit a Keto diet, and was delish. I guess I did add a handful of cheddar and whenever onions are called for, I always use shallots. I find them more flavorful.

spinach layered on bottom didn't really allow egg and cheese to mix in so quiche ended up like a layered pie. Flavor not that great.

Didn't follow recipe exactly because I didn't have all the ingredients (substituted yellow onion for the red, had only Parmesan cheese and didn't have the full amount).  Quiche came out fine and was delicious anyway.

I used all fresh and good quality ingredients but found this quiche somewhat bland.  I see other reviewers modified it by adding to it - e.g. bacon, feta, mozzarella, extra basil, mushrooms.  I would recommend tripling the fresh basil and adding mushrooms and/or bacon.

This was delicious.  I added mushrooms per another reviewer.  I love mushrooms.  I think I will make without the pie shell next time.  Only because we are trying to eliminate all breads.  I think this will hold up on its on after baking.  I think next I will throw bacon in, instead of serving on the side.

9.25.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/275439/spinach-ricotta-quiche/ ... This reminded me of manicotti, a favorite.  Didn’t prebake, just first ten minutes were on 425.  Subbed w 10oz frozen spinach, which was thawed, squeezed n rechopped.  To remove extra moisture, I added to pan w onion once browned; pushed around till started to stick.  Put a little shredded mozzarella in the unbaked shell, then the spinach mixture.  Combined eggs, cream n spices; poured over; sprinkled Parmesan in top.  Crumbled bacon on top next time - & a touch of nutmeg in egg mixture.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, KimKN!

A pleasant light spinach quiche that I didn't make any changes too. I have made a spinach quiche with ricotta cheese, mushrooms and mustard on the crust that has more punch which is what I prefer. However, this is a nice quiche for that ladies luncheon on the veranda.

Very tasty!  I added feta cheese to the mix to give it a greekish taste.  Yum!  It was slightly moist in the bottom, so I may try the suggestion of putting mozzarella cheese over the pie crust to help maintain crispness.

Very good. Nice taste and texture. Used half and half instead of the heavy cream. Really couldn't  taste the basil. Will add more next time.

Delicious!  I used about 1/3 C of basil leaves and a LOT of spinach, fresh out of the garden, as well was about 1/2 C parmesan.  Used immersion blender to mix eggs, cheese, etc. right in the mixing bowl.
I baked the quiche in the Breville toaster convection oven.  Next time I bake this  will cook the base a couple minutes longer.  The cooking time for the whole quiche was just about right, maybe a few minutes more than suggested.  It all depends on your oven.

I added garlic, substituted half and half for the heavy cream, cooked the onion and spinach in bacon grease, used 10 oz. of baby spinach and I did not layer, just mixed it all together. I made 2, one was crustless.  I preferred the crustless one. I will definately make it again, but will add more cheese and different types.

Will definitely make again...very versatile recipe. I cleaned out my fridge and added some chopped summer squash, green pepper. No ricotta, so used cottage cheese. For color I sliced small tomatoes and baked them on top of quiche. I make my own crust, but would use frozen in a pinch.

The taste was delicious as written. Next time, though, I will mix the custard with the spinach mixture, not layer it as the directions say. I think the texture will be a lot better, and the crust will be less soggy as a result.

Delicious! I salted when cooking the onion and spinach and then added them to the blender on slow with the other ingredients. I buttered my iron skillet and skipped the crust. It came out perfect. Did not burn on the bottom and lifted right out. This is an excellent tasting quiche! Quick and easy to make. I will definitely make it again.

I used way less spinach, about 2oz, and it was plenty.  I couldn't imagine using the full amount.  I also didn't like pre-baking the crust, as it fell in and down onto the base.

Even with those negatives, the taste and texture were very good.

Did exactly as the recipe said, other than making the crust at home, and it was soooooo delicious!! I will be making this for my mom this Christmas when she visits.

I didn't have fresh basil, but this really didn't need it. Also used up some left over spiral ham. Very nice and fluffy - excellent for a light dinner with a little salad.

Very good and easy to make. I gave it 4 stars because it is extremely rich. I may cut back on the ricotta next time.

I used store bought pie crust , 10 oz of my home frozen spinach and since I did not have fresh basil, used 1 tsp of dried.  Everything else I followed recipe.  Wonderfully delicious and easy.   Will make it again.

I did make changes. I used 1.5 cups of small curd cottage cheese and no cream. I used dried basil. I added 1/3 c of pine nuts. I used white paper instead of black. I did not blend the cheese/egg mixture. I just folded together.

I made this dish tonight. I bought a frozen pie crust in a foil pan and pre -baked it 10 minutes. I used frozen thawed chopped spinach squeezed out the excess water. The rest of the recipe was followed as written.  It was easy to make this dish and very little cleanup. Turned out very well. I will make it again

I added a layer of rotisserie chicken on top of the spinach and onion blend.  I also used an Italian cheese blend as the 
crust barrier.  Yummy!

I made it without the crust and it turned out wonderful.  I didn't have any fresh parmesan cheese so I used that mix of shredded Mexican cheese and I used 1/2 cup instead of 1/3 cup.  It was great.

This is the tastiest, easiest and best quiche I've ever had. I followed the recipe exactly, except I forgot the basil so I sprinkled some dry on the top before putting into the oven, so I always do it that way now. I don't want to mess with perfection. It is an outstanding recipe! 
But please note, all the deep dish pre-made pie crusts I tried were too small to hold all the liquid. I even made my own crust for a 10 inch pie plate and it just barely fit.  
And if you're trying to go low carb just pour into a buttered or sprayed pie plate and bake for 35 minutes - outstanding!! I was trying to clean out the fridge so I used more ricotta and more heavy cream, added more onions and all the spinach I had on hand which was a 10 ounce bag and a smidge left over from another bag. I may even like it batter crustless. This is a very flexible recipe, so go ahead and experiment. I love this so much I've probably made it a dozen times in the past 2 months!

This recipe is very delightful.  I used frozen pie crusts, a vidalia onion and 1/2-3/4 TBS of dried basil (I did this because I mixed the blended ingredients the evening before and put them in the fridge.  It turned out so well for a school carry-in that I had to give out the recipe

Just delicious, even with my screw ups.  Basil had gone over the hill, so left it out and forgot to add parm. Cheese.  It ended  up light and delicious (according to my wife who is always an objective critic). I chose to stir in the cooked spinach and onions (and added some cooked mushrooms) into the eggs rather than layering on bottom to avoid having any chance of soggy crust.  Worked great. Adding the Parmesan would have made it richer.

I made it exactly as written and it was delicious.  Next time I'll use half and half, low fat ricotta and maybe some more basil because I love the taste. This recipe is just too rich for me, as written.

The flavors were great , but the recipe does not give you all the info.
1st pat the spinach/onion mixture dry before putting into pie shell-the bottom of the Quiche was soggy.
2nd No oven temp is listed for cooking- I tried 375 and after an hour it still was not done. Put oven to 400 then it finally cooked, after another 15 minutes. Recommend to use 400 to begin with and should cook fully after 40 minutes.

No changes but I think I’ll wrap my crust for half of the baking time so it’s not dark. YUMMY

I used Swiss chard since I didn’t have spinach and 1/2. and  1/2  instead of heavy cream. I would use more onion next time to ‘kick it up’  very good

Easy and fast.  I added a few thin sliced mushrooms in skillet to onion mixture, cooked for 2 to 3 mins, added spinach.
Delicious, will make again.
