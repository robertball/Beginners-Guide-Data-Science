Whether you use this method because it’s an easy, no-fuss method of roasting corn or because you want to free up space on your grill or stove-top, you won’t end up with a more perfect ear of corn cooked any other way. The recipe doesn’t indicate this, but since you’re directed to bake the corn for an hour, and since corn is generally soaked in its husks, I assumed the husks were meant to be left on.  Two ears fit perfectly in a 2-quart beverage pitcher.  This corn was, in a word, simply excellent - sweet, juicy, delightfully “seasoned” because of the salt/sugar brine.  Time and temperature were both spot on.  Hubs and I couldn’t stop commenting all through dinner on how good this was!

Make sure and leave the CORN IN THE HUSK when you brine it.

This recipe caught my eye.  I’m used to making corn on the grill, and an oven recipe, especially one that cooked the corn for an hour, was intriguing.  We started with fresh, Wisconsin sweet corn. Leaving the husks on, we followed the directions exactly and the corn turned out sweet, tender and delicious.  It’s something I never would have thought of doing and is something I will definitely  do again.  It’s absolutely a wonderful and different way to enjoy sweet corn.

I had to try this recipe because of the cooking method!  Since I had the oven on already anyway and since I had one cob of corn, I figured I'd give it a whirl.  I halved the ingredients and left it to brine for about two hours before placing it in the oven.  I am sorry not to have taken a photo of the cob before cutting it away!  It was a little dried-out looking, like corn gets when you leave it on the counter too long after taking it from boiling water.  The taste was good and didn't need to have any extra seasoning.  I probably won't make it again this way, but I'm anxious to have someone else make it and see if it was just something I did wrong.  I really wanted to like this!  EDIT:  Talking to the author of this recipe on the Buzz, I discovered that the directions to his recipe were supposed to inform us to LEAVE THE HUSKS ON!  I'm so glad to see that Naples did that, and so now I really need to try this again so I can change my rating!  EDIT AGAIN!  I felt the need to try this method again!  And I did another photo, too!  We did like this method, and the corn was good and it was sweet---not quite like back in the old days when my dad raised his own corn and you could taste the natural sugar crystals in the corn.  This does in a pinch.  I still like when I put my corn in boiling water for just a very few minutes--just enough to warm it up.  That's how I like mine!  Thanks, Ed.  I am done with corn for this season now!

No need to use up space on the outdoor grill anymore!  So easy to do, and such a tasty result.

I tried this as is, and was not impressed. I don't know if the brine did anything or not.  Next time I will try some in the brine and some cooked without to see if the natural sweetness of the corn is improved or not.

This was so easy for our Family Sunday crowd of 20+. Other recipe reviews say to leave it in the husk, but we had already husked corn (thank you Costco) so we soaked it (cutting the sugar in half) and wrapped each 1/2 ear in foil just before baking. They turned out perfect.

Omg!Made this tonight & it was wonderful! (I'd made some roasted garlic while the corn brined, mashed up in some soft margarine to slather on the corn!) I decreased the cook time to 40 minutes, turned the oven off the last 15-20 minutes while the rest of dinner finished cooking! It was perfection!

This was a Big hit at my last dinner party. Like so many Others I left the corn in the husk. I Let mine soak in the Brine for about 7 hours refrigerated. Served with "Indian" lamb stuffed onions and spicy egg plant. I didn't tell anyone how I made the the corn. Yet everyone's first bite was followed by Mmmmmmmmm how'd you make this? Definite Keeper !!!!

This is my new way to making corn.  I followed the recipe pretty much except that I leave the husks on and butter the ear before wrapping in foil and putting in the oven.  The corn always comes out tender and moist, and it frees up the stove for cooking other things.  My family and I really enjoy baked corn on the cob.  Great recipe!

I used this method to prepare the corn for an eloté recipe, since we didn't have a grill.  Definitely a keeper!

Pretty good but not exceptional.  Next to e I will go for earlier in the season, and give them an extra extra ten.  Husk after no more than 15 min, instead of a half hour.

The brine made the corn very delicious! I had spareribs & sauerkraut baking in oven. Added corn on top for last 30 minutes. Came out perfect, A little crunchy which is the way I like it.

Great corn on the cob. I made it for a few guest that I had over for a small gathering, this corn on the cob was a hit. Everyone loved the corn on the cob. New and only way I will make corn on the cob in the further. . The best part is leaving the corn in the husk and silk for others to clean and they didn't mind because the corn was worth it. ????

Very good flavor.  The brine was nice.  I did mine at 350 for an hour along with another dish in the oven.   Next time, I'll pull it out after 45 minutes.  350 was good.

This worked really, really well.  I had 6 ears and doubled the brining ingredients and it worked great. Yes, brine and bake with the husks; don't bother to clean the silk because once cooked the silk comes off easier than when raw.  One thing that hasn't been mentioned is how your kitchen has this wondrous corn smell while baking.  The end result was awesome using corn from my local farmer's market.  You do want to consider having the oven on for an hour; what does that do regarding costs in fuel and heating your kitchen. If grilling is not available I like this result better than boiling, but having a choice I would still plop soaked cobs in the husks on a grill over this method.  Regardless, this method results in delicious corn.

I had partially husked corn, so I soaked them and wrapped them in foil before grilling. I can honestly say, I'm not sure I've ever had better corn on the cob in my life.
