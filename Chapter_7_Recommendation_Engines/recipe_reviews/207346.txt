I followed the recipe exactly. The finished product was too salty. If I make it again, I will cut down on the both the 1 T. of salt in the water the raw fish soaks in before cooking, and cut down on the 1 t. of salt in the "breading". And I love salty food, so if I think it's too salty, those of you that don't prefer salty foods should really watch the amounts.  Halibut is at least twice the price of other similar white fish, such as tilapia, cod, etc. I paid $16 for 10 oz. of Halibut, while the other similar white fishes ran from $6 to $8 for the same amount. Halibut is extremely flaky, so it fell apart right in the pan when I turned the filets - which was fine. The end result was about 10 pieces of fallen apart fish.  It was very easy and quick to make - couldn't be simpler. But the finished product for me was good, not great.

This recipe was very easy to make, and I was surprised how well the spice mixture stuck to the fish. Also, the recipe produced the perfect amount of spice for coating the fish (not too much so nothing was wasted). Thank you Pixie2 for sharing your recipe.

Very good. Loved the flavors and ease.  Served with a crunchy Asian style cole slaw.
