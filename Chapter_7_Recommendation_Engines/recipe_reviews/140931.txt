Awesome recipe. I did not use the seafood seasoning because I did not have it. But I did use the Cajun and it was good. It tasted just like eating out. Also, I picked this recipe because it did not have eggs. I was beginning to think you could not fry pickles without eggs. Thanks so much poster.

The first time I ever saw these on a menu, I thought it was a joke.  Then, I ate one.  Fried pickles are so delicious and this recipe makes them turn out crisp and yummy.  I've always dipped them in plain ranch dressing but the cajun seasoned kick to it is a great touch.  Don't be afraid to try these - you'll be hooked!

When I saw this recipe the thought that crossed my mind was, How weird! But I was very curious about what it wouls taste like so I made them. And I was pleasantly surprised! They are so good. I did it for a womans night. We felt like real men, eating fried pickles and drinking beer! Haaha! It is worth a try and I will make this over and over!

was excited to make these at home but this recipe was nothing like what we've had at a pub. too grainy and the mixture was not thick enough. tried some beer batter mix and it worked so much better.

I love fried pickles, but this was a disappointment. I believe it calls for too much cornmeal, the breading as a result was thin and absorbed all the grease. tasted greasy and heavy, but ok for a midnight munchie I guess.

These were so good. We are a gluten free family so we used our normal gluten free flour blend in place of the AP Flour and it worked wonderfully. Crispy yummy fried pickles. Thanks so much for sharing!
Update- I just realized that I didn't even notice last time that there was more cornmeal than flour so I used 3/4 c flour and 3/4 cornmeal, and you won't be disappointed. Whatever amount you use, just use equal parts flour and cornmeal.

I thought this was delicious. I didnt have any cornmeal so I used some bread cumbs (a little less than amount of flour used) and I added a splash of cayenne pepper,  and a little paprika. I also used garlic oil. I made other recipies on this site using the egg and ect, and thought this recipie was much tastier and easier to make.  I havent got to the making a dipping sauce yet cause I didnt need one. great recipie, this one makes the recipie book. :)

Delish!  I used mini dills instead of slices and I dipped them twice in the breading (with buttermilk in between) for a really crunchy exterior.  Thanks!

Excellent recipe.  I think the buttermilk dunk/soak is perfect to make the cornmeal/flour stay on well while frying.  We really enjoyed these, as good as any restaurant here in the south!

This recipe nails it.  I added more Old Bay because I am from Baltimore and that's just what we do.  The ranch side with the cajun seasoning is perfect.  I actually think this recipe works better with the pickle spears.  Really make sure you coat them with the batter, otherwise the fried layer is too thin.

These were as delicious as eating out. I do not have a fryer so I did them in a regular pot on the stove and it made for a messy cleanup. Great recipe though and I would definitely try them again. Still working on perfectly a sauce to go with them though.

Awesome breading that I can see being very versatile.  Super easy to prepare.  I did not have buttermilk but really wanted some fried pickles so I took them straight from the jar into the breading and fired them.  They were perfect. Just what I was in the mood for.  My kids even said they were better than some popular restaurant fried pickles they have had.  I made a whole 32 ounce jar of hamburger dills with just one recipe of this amazing breading!

I'm from Texas where we fry anything and everything. Fried pickles have been one of my favorite fried foods for years, but the batter for this recipe just doesn't taste right. It's way too grainy and doesn't have much flavor even with the seasonings. Still on my search for the perfect fried pickle batter.

Made these for a pig roast, and they were a huge success.  People weren't even waiting for them to cool off before grabbing by the handful.

We had a lot of happy, but burned, mouths that evening!  Super easy and fun to make, especially if you get someone to help you out.

I think it needs a little more spice also a cup of cornmeal is more than enough.

I used a coarser cornmeal than called for, and regretted it. I'd definitely use a fine cornmeal in the future.   Also, I used really crunchy pickles because those are the kind I eat normally, but if I were to use this recipe in the future I'd buy ones a tid-bit less crunchy.    I forgot to add the cajun seasoning, and the taste overall was a bit bland. I had my own dipping sauce which did help. Overall, the recipe itself was o.k. but nothing compared to fried pickles I've eaten in restaurants.

The cooking time on the top of this recipe is misleading. It actually takes only 1.5 mins to cook. My 11 year old son, a connoisseur of fried pickles, and I just whipped these up in 5 mins total. They are crispy and yummy. We cooked ours in a deep fryer. They really don't need a dipping sauce, if you are looking to cut carbs.

New Family Favorite! Fried pickle lover approved! 

This recipe was so easy to follow.  It took no time to prep, and the pickles were better than most restaurants.  I like the recipe as is.

These are good, but here is how to make them even better. And easier too! 
Forget about dipping and dredging. Make a semi-thick batter with ingredients. Dip the drained pickles into the batter and fry. So much easier and with much better results. And use the crispiest thickest chips you can find.

I live in souther Louisiana where fried pickles are pretty common. I've made them quite a few times at home. I found this recipe was good I just didn't care for the seafood seasoning. But I really like the idea of using buttermilk. It makes the flour and cornmeal coat better. Over all a good recipe

DEEEEEEE-LICIOUS!!!!!!! I only used 1 cup of cornmeal and almond milk instead of buttermilk (its all I had!). I added some extra pepper to the cornmeal/flour mix and these came out perfectly!!! My mother & I both loved them! Def will make these again!!!

This was my first attempt for fried pickles and was very happy with the results! ONLY thing that was upsetting is that the batter doesn't stay on that well..maybe didn't put enough on? Anyways I didn't end up using the seafood seasoning because I don't like anything seafood/fishy (Blah!)  Also changed the dip a bit and made it almost the same as Boston Beerworks! (Kens ranch dressing, buttermilk & Cajun) Pretty impressed with myself! Lol Perfect slight kick and consistency.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone!

Wow. This turned out great. The one and only change I made was that I used whole pickles and cut them myself a bit thicker than normal sliced dill pickles.  Turned out excellent.

These were great! Everyone in the house ate them up! My kids usually don’t like fried pickles but devoured these. I omitted the seafood seasoning but kept the rest the same. Will definitely make these again!

I followed this recipe to the T. These were very flavorful, but too salty. I think the key is to use a thicker pickle slice. I’ll try this again, but with spears, thicker slices, or cut the slices myself from larger, whole pickles. I made some homemade buttermilk ranch to go with them and found it to be a necessity to tame down the saltiness. My guests thought they were too salty as well.

Great recipe, the recipe was confusing because it has Cajun seasoning on there twice so the portion was a little “to taste” but other than that it was good. This recipe paired well with the Hidden Valley Spicy Ranch.

My sweet baby girl grand daughter requested fried pickles for Thanksgiving. Tested some small batches and this is the recipe we liked best. Super crust, super easy.  One change, I didn't have Cajun seasoning (on my shopping list) so I used soul seasoning and I had to add some cayenne to give it a little more punch.

I've attempted fried pickles before but I just couldn't find a recipe that didn't end in sad floppy pickles. I'm so glad I found this! My wife and I are hopelessly addicted to fried pickles and now we can make delicious ones at home! Perfectly crispy outside, delicious snap inside. Lovely.

I followed the instructions fully. The only suggestion would be to somehow double batter the pickles.  They were delicious but the batter was not as thick and crunchy as restaurant ones

These were easy to make and tasted great. I might try adding hot shot  (McCormick spice) next time.  The cornmeal made them crisp up nicely without getting soggy.  The pickles were delicious with ranch dressing- a new family favorite!

Cooked them for 1:30 and they were golden brown.  Only change I'm going to try is reducing the cornmeal a little bit.

I think the recipe as is is a 3, but with adjustments can be much better.  I used the suggestions of others & used 1/2 cup of cornmeal.  The next time I make it I will use even less & use more flour.  I didn't use the seafood seasoning as I didn't have any-something was definitely missing with the seasonings even with extra Cajun spice.  I used the sandwich pickle slices & they worked just fine.  The next time I will experiment with the spices.

Good start. Liked the flavor, but I felt they were too grainy. Will definitely try again with less cornmeal. I made a batch with dill pickles and a batch with Flamin' pickles. The Flamin' Pickles were great!
