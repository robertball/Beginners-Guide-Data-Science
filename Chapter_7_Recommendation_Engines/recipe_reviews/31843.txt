Super Good.  Used Italian Bread Crumbs instead of Oatmeal & Lipton Onion Soup Mix instead of Onion since some family members are not fans of chunks of onions.  This was a big hit.

Because I'm on Weight Watchers, I substituted fat-free egg substitute for the real eggs, soy milk for the cow's milk, and took pains to use the lowest calorie spaghetti sauce I could find (which turned out to be Classico's Fire-Roasted Tomato and Garlic) and the 93% fat-free ground turkey. It tasted *amazing*, especially when you remeber how bland turkey can be. Not so here! It never firmed enough up in the oven to slice cleanly without falling apart - it was a touch mushy, which means no leftover meatloaf sandwiches. I think leaving the milk out might help with that issue.

My family Loved it!  It was flavorful and moist.  We also thought that the
texture was just fine.
   Now, my apologies because I intended on staying close to the original recipe but due to circumstances some things were modified...I did use 1 and 1/2 tsp. of the Italian seasoning in the meat (after reading some of the other reviews) and 3 cloves of minced garlic.  I used 1 pound pork sausage with the ground turkey, because that's what I had.  The sauce for the top was modified because I don't buy sauce, but the sauce I made was simple and completely winged so anyone can do it in a pinch.  And lastly I did double the hot sauce drops.  
The meatloaf was much larger then I was expecting and at 350 degrees it took around 2 hours to bake. 
If you're in need of the Simple sauce...I used 1-14oz can diced tomatoes, 1-6oz can tomato paste, 2 cloves minced garlic, 1/2 tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp. basil and 1/4 tsp thyme.

I always make meatloaf with ground turkey and ground pork, but my husband and I really enjoyed this version with the mild turkey sausage. I followed the instructions exactly and the result was YUMMY! I don't know how kids might like this recipe due to the spicy tomato based sauce.

I just made this for dinner tonight.  Yummy!  I loved the way the oats bound everything together - and you couldn't even tell they were there once it was cooked.  I also added a little shredded carrot to increase the veggie factor and add a little more color to the mix.  As other reviewers said, I didn't have liquid smoke, so I used BBQ sauce for the topping - delish!  It adds just the right amount of interest to the topping.  Did I already say yummy?  Yummy!

definitely yummers!  easily halved the recipe -- just scale for 3 instead of 6. (btw, 2 italian sausages equal half a pound. i used jennie-o turkey italian links) beside that i followed the recipe exactly, well, except i didn't use any milk. oh, and i sauteed the onion & fresh garlic instead of using powder --the texture was perfect, the taste outstanding.  my family loved it. i'm looking forward to a sammie for lunch! yum

I loved this.  Even as leftovers.  Quick and easy to prepare.  I tried with bread crumbs, but it was more mushy.  The oats give it great texture and keep the perfect moisture.  Don't put too much liquid smoke in the sauce, because it easily can become overbearing.  It does add something unique to the recipe though.

I do not like meatloaf in general, but I loved this recipe!  The turkey sausage really makes a difference.  I was out of oats, so used 1 C. of italian bread crumbs instead, and it was just delicious.  My picky kids and husband loved it as well, this will definitely become a staple in my home.

I love this recipe.  My husband doesn't eat red meat so I am constantly looking for new turkey recipes.  I've tried to make a turkey meatloaf before, but it didn't turn out anything like this!  I only put half the sauce on before cooking and leave the rest as a side to spoon on by anyone who wants more after it's cooked.  I layered strips of roasted red and yellow peppers over the sauce before baking.   Next time I want to make meatballs, this is the recipe I'll be using!  For fun, I would add some freshly grated parmesan cheese for the meatballs.  Thanks Chris!

This very good and FILLING.  The only modifications I made were for the fact that the ground turkey and turkey sausage come in 20oz packages from my grocery store. I increased it to 3 eggs and 2 cups of oats and a whole vidalia.  I did put just a little spaghetti sause in the mixture... it was PERFECT.  Makes a lot.

This is definitely a favorite in my household.   The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfectly and got rave reviews from several friends who tried it.  Since then I've made small adjustments to the recipe to suit the tastes of my family and it's always a hit.  Even my mother-in-law who is a fabulous cook and doesn't like most other people's food loved it and raved about it to her family members.

I only had 1 cup of rolled oats, so used crumbled stale bread for the other 1/2 cup and it still came out great.  I also don't keep liquid smoke at the house, so used 2 tablespoons of hickory smoked BBQ sauce (and upped the hot sauce to 1/2 teaspoon) and it really deepened the flavor of the sauce.  Next time, I think I might add 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese to the meat mixture for a little more flavor.  Overall a simple, good recipe that I'll be keeping!

I use 1/2 turkey and 1/2 lean ground beef. The meatloaf itself has a potential to be a little on the bland side, so I add a little more spice to the meat with a touch of liquid smoke. I cook for 2 single men who ask for it week after week. It reheats well.

The recipe as is was not that impressive, thus 3 stars. However the sauce was very good and with some modifications I think it would be a good meal for our family. I followed the advice of other reviewers and omitted the milk - this was a good call, the consistency of the loaf was perfect and made great sandwiches the next day. I also omitted the italian seasoning, and next time would go for maybe 1/2# of turkey sausage, and up the plain turkey. I think those are the only necessary changes - the sauce was great, the consistency was good, it just was too italian seasoned for me, and I skipped the extra seasoning even. The oats blended in really well.

Confining this recipe to just meatloaf would be a shame.  I'm going to be making meatballs and turkey burgers, for sure!  For interests sake, I used fresh garlic instead of powder, also added sauteed mushrooms as well as a 1/4 cup of fresh chopped basil.  (Just happened to have these ingredients in the fridge that needed using)  This will be one of my go-to recipes from now on.  Even my 17 month old son LOVED it!

SO great! My husband & kids liked it so much last week that they asked me to make it again tonight. I used ground turkey breakfast sausage, and l left out the liquid smoke (didn't have any in-hand). Everything else was followed exactly.  YUMMM!

Fantastic! My fiancee (who is a beef lover) frowned when I told him that tonight's meatloaf was actually turkey.....but he changed his mind once he tasted it:) He LOVED it and so did I. It does make quite a bit, so I would suggest seperating into two dishes, but I used every ingredient exactly and it was delicious!

By far the best turkey meatloaf I've ever tried!  Replaced the onion with grated carrot because we don't like onion, and just used a can of tomato paste to top it.  Looking forward to the leftovers and will definitely make again!  Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this a couple times, and we LOVE IT.  I used regular Italian sausage (not turkey), just because that's what I had.  I also took other suggestions and used a package of onion soup mix instead of the onion.  I didn't have oatmeal, so I just used regular bread crumbs (slices of white bread that were starting to go stale ground up in my mini-chopper).  I also didn't have Italian seasoning, so I just sprinkled some parsely, basil and oregano in.  I made HALF of the glaze - just using 1 small can of store-bought tomato sauce with the Worcestershire sauce...I put a few dashes of hot sauce in, but I didn't have liquid smoke, so I just put in some creole seasoning.  It gave it such a nice flavor, and the glaze "baked on" since it was the lesser amount.  One key thing that I did (that was a lesson learned from the first time) - instead of making 1 big meatloaf, I made 2 smaller loaves in the same pan.  Then the baking time did take about an hour.  Like some of the other commenters, I found that the baking time for a single loaf was far longer than these instructions say....but split in 2, it's about perfect.  THIS RECIPE IS A KEEPER!!  :)

We don't care for oatmeal in our meatloaf, so I used crushed buttery round crackers instead. I did omit the Liquid Smoke, only because I had just run out from another recipe. The flavor was there, just not as strong as I would have liked. The meatloaf was real wet and I felt there was too much sauce on top of the meatloaf that the meatloaf was just floating in. If I make this again, I'd probably cut out the milk called for and use a cup of the spaghetti sauce in the meatloaf as well as on top. I would double the spices, too. I liked the uniqueness of this meatloaf, I just think I'd like to play around with the recipe a bit and try it again.

I don't usually do so well with things that require baking - and unfortunately this was no exception. I accidentally put in 2.5 total pounds of meat (I used ground turkey that was pre-seasoned with Italian flavors) and even with that huge mistake it was SO SO good. The sauce was key (I used 2 parts spaghetti sauce and 1 part BBQ b/c I didn't have smoke flavoring and I used Sriracha as my hot pepper sauce). I love that it uses oatmeal too! Thanks for posting!

This was very good.  I followed the recipe exactly as indicated--I like the idea of keeping it as healthy and unfattening as possible.  I thought it was great.  I may have added a little more of the indicated spices when I felt like it but I was going for keeping it the same as written and assessing the taste.

Pretty tasty!  I followed the recipe, but added 1/3 cup of finely grated carrot and one chopped roasted red pepper for color and more veggie content.  Also added chopped fresh parsley from our herb garden. My husband even liked it the next day on a sandwich!

Soo good. I use venison sausage instead of turkey sausage (because i have a hunter in the family and always have to find venison recipes) but I keep the rest as is. My 9 and 4-year old love it. I'm going to make meatballs with it tonight!

Probably one of the best meatloaf recipes I have ever made.  It was met with rave reviews from my boyfiend.  I will definetly make this one again.  I did make it in a standard meatloaf pan  so I ended up cooking it for about 90 minutes and it came out perfectly!

I have made this recipe several times now and it has become a favorite!  I make it exactly as written and it's fabulous every time.  I use Trader Joe's 99% lean ground turkey along with a very good Italian turkey sausage that my local grocery store carries.  I had tried other turkey meatloaf before but none compares to this and I tossed those old recipes because I certainly have no need to make those anymore.

I love this. It's easy and so good. I use Ritz crackers instead of oats and onion powder instead of real onions. Joy of cooking for picky eaters. Big hit in our home.

This is a fantastic recipe. It has given me ideas for other meatloaf twists with different ethnic sausages: andouille with a creole topping (substitute cayenne for the italian seasoning), chorizo with a salsa topping (substitute mexican chili powder for the italian seasoning) and bratwurst with a mushroom cream sauce topping (substitute powdered mustard for the italian seasoning). I am still working on a substitute for the worcestershire for each of the variations and will post those recipes when I figure it out.

I used 1.5 lbs of ground turkey and no turkey sausage since I didn't have any.  I just topped with ketchup since it was for my kids and they wouldn't care for a fancier sauce.  Everyone was happy.

This meatloaf is ultra moist.  I did not have the turkey sausage and I didn't have enough Worcestershire sauce.  I omitted the sausage and used Teriyaki sauce.  It turned out fine.  I would make this again, however, I felt that (for my household), it could have used a bit more flavor like more garlic and some black pepper.  Nice recipe.

Probably one of the top 3 meatloaves I've ever made.  The consistency was fantastic and the flavor spectacular.  I made a few modifications to the recipe though (left out the turkey sausage but added fennel for flavor, sautéed onion in extra virgin olive oil and added some garlic and fresh chopped spinach to the pan).    I also placed a few pieces of fresh mozzarella on the top just before I took it out of the oven so it could melt.  So good it I almost forgot it was turkey!

very tasty.  only thing I did not like was the sauce.  The liquid smoke killed the true taste.  I removed that and the sauce was awesome.

This is a winner, folks!  I made it last night and received rave reviews from my family.  It looked beautiful, sliced nicely and was incredibly tasty. The only changes I made were to substitute fresh crushed garlic for the garlic powder and to add 1/4 cup fresh chopped Italian flat leaf parsley to the loaf.  I will be making this often!

This a great recipe that I've made many times. I've modified it for our taste by using hot Italian turkey sausage and by spicing up the sauce with crushed red pepper. I'm not a liquid smoke person and can't imagine that using it would improve it much. Give it try...

This is a great recipe! Turkey meatloaf can be very bland and this recipe helped to put a kick in the flavor.  I used hot turkey sausage to keep the fat content down and skipped on the liquid smoke since I did not have any. Be sure to use a thick marinara sauce to avoid a soupy result. I poured off excess liquid 40 minutes into baking (which took me 1.25 hours at 375 degrees.

Leftovers are also great!

OMG!!!!  With many failed efforts of using more Ground Turkey instead of Beef, this here is a sure fire WINNNNNER!!!  I've not only made this as the instructions, I've made my own several twists.  This is a favorite with my "Recipe Club" at work.  I now have the non believers believing that Turkey can taste wonderful.

If you like spice, try dicing a jalapeno and mixing it with the turkey. Or instead of the tomato sauce topping, I've made a Pomegranate Balsamic Glaze *wonderful*.

Very good recipe. I was a little worried about how the oats would turn out so I only used 1c of them. As for the seasoning, I didn't measure them. I used garlic salt, pepper and italian seasoning and just seasoned the meat mixture. The onions cooked well and the oats weren't noticeable. Look forward to making this one again.

This has become a household favorite for us too!  I always half the recipe (using 1 pound of ground turkey and omitting the turkey sausage).  Sometimes I'll add a layer of cheese in the middle of the loaf, yum!

Wonderful recipe!  I followed it, except I doubled the Italian seasoning and added 4 cloves crushed garlic.  I was worried about the oatmeal, but it did a wonderful job binding the loaf together, and my two finicky teenaged boys never knew it was in there! Thanks Chris!!

I halved the recipe because it is just hubby and me.  The only substitution  I made was bbq  sauce instead of liquid smoke (don't have) and because I halved the recipe I used only the turkey sausage.  This was fantastic!!  it is now my go to recipe for meatloaf!!  It was  moist, flavorful  and great the next day for sandwiches.  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious! I followed the recipe pretty much to the letter- I had to substitute pork sausage for turkey, and spicy BBQ sauce instead of smoke flavoring. Worked out well, though I still want to try it with the turkey sausage. I made two smaller loaves instead of 1 big one and cooked at 350 for 50 minutes. Only critique is that 2 cups of spaghetti sauce made way too much sauce, and masks the other flavorings. I poured a liberal amount over the uncooked loaves and still had a good bit left over for serving. Next time I'll reduce the amount of red sauce and play with the proportions of the other ingredients.

The Best Meatloaf I have ever had!!  I kept to the recipe as it called, no subs, no additions.  I promise you won't have any of the problems that others have said if you stick to it. Can't taste the oats, smoke not over powering and it only took the 60 mins.  I think those that had problems were those that made changes.  I do also agree with many others, Great for Meatballs!

Wow!! Absolutely incredible! the second best meatloaf I've had in my life! Hubby definitely loved it and wants me to make it again. Used a little bit of the onion soup mix n some chopped onion. I only had half of the rolled oats so I used the other half with regular breadcrumbs. This ones a keeper!

Very good!  Even my picky eater said she liked this better than my regular beef meatloaf recipe.  I made this pretty much according to directions except the sausage was pork sausage since that's all I had and I did reduce the milk a bit.  Very tasty, good texture, and no trouble with it falling apart.  I did skip the glaze because we prefer brown gravy for our meatloaf.  I will be making this again.  Thanks!

This would be great just the way its written although I recommend, for those who object to the rolled oats texture, that the oats are pulsed a bit finer...this produces a more satisfying texture and incorporates the oats nicely.  Do this in a blendtec or blender.  I, however, modified the recipe for my 'blood type' diet and used pureed artichoke hearts (for red sauce) and goat milk yogurt (for the milk).  Thanks for the basics!

Love this recipe! So easy to make and taste great!  A few things I did differently based on previous reviews: First I used eggs whites to cut calories. Next I only used 1/4 cup fat free milk. Finally, I added a bit more onion than called for (might even add more next time!).  A few things I plan to try next time: First, I am going to add about a 1/4-1/2 of the sauce into the meat mixture before putting in the dish (to add even more flavor). Next, I think about a 1/4 cup chopped Sweet red pepper would make a great addition in the meat mixture.  This is a great healthy, filling dish!! Will make again and again!

This is the best turkey meatloaf that I've made.  My husband had 3 helpings.  I thought that the glaze was really unique, since it was smoking and spicy instead of the usual ketchup.  I used a little bit of browning sauce in the glaze instead of liquid smoke and added some additional hot sauce.  Very tasty.

WOW!  My husband and I are watching our fat and cholesterol intake, so this was right up our alley.  I was leary about a turkey meatloaf for fear it would be dry and tasteless...BOY I was WRONG!  This is great.  

My supermarket did not have italian turkey sausage, so I used regular sweet Italian sausage.  Removing the casings was surprisingly easy.  It had to cook an hour and a half though.  Otherwise, I adhered to the recipe.  It came out perfect and both my picky husband and picky daughter ate it all. 

One note: 2 pounds of meat, plus the oats makes a GIANT meatloaf.  We barely ate half of it.  If you are cooking for a small family, you may want to consider halving the recipe.  Great meatloaf!

this was an AWESOME spin on regular meatloaf...I cooked mine at 375 for an hour, adding the sauce to the top 1/2 way through because we like a firmer meatloaf.  I also added 4 minced garlic cloves and a whole palm full of Italian seasoning. I used bbq sauce in place of the smoke...it was just incredible and the leftovers today are even better.  Like meatball sandwiches? TRY THIS!

I have to admit I did not make this recipe exactly as directed.  I used ground turkey and chicken sausage instead of turkey sausage.  And I used a bit more sauce than indicated just to "finish off" the jar.  Alas I did not like the results, although my husband did. I found the texture of the chicken sausage unappealing.  So if you try this recipe be cautious with substitutions.

This took about forty five minutes longer to cook and was a bit odd in flavor. We didn't care for the smoky marinara sauce and the meat itself was just okay.

My husband and I loved this meatloaf and loved that it was lower in fat than traditional recipes. I made a couple of adjustments because of what I had on hand. I used steel cut oats,  and instead of milk, I used light Italian dressing for liquid and seasoning.  I also baked a little longer than suggested, because it didn't seem done after 50 minutes. I was afraid that much sauce would make it soupy, but it thickened up in the oven and came out perfectly. I'll make this again.

Seasoning wise, the recipe is great. However, I did not like the texture of the oatmeal. I typically use breadcrumbs in my meatloaf and will do the next time I make this. A nice alternative to "beef."

I made this recipe, with a couple changes for personal tastes, a few days ago. It was yummy! Both my husband and son loved it. We made scrumptious meatloaf sandwiches for dinner last night. 
The changes I made were to use onion soup mix instead of the onion and salt, and to use bbq sauce for the topping. 
Thanks for this recipe. It will become a standard in our house.

I made this exact to the recipe and it was fabulous!  I kept sneaking pieces of it the next day -- had to stop so I'd have enough for a second dinner for the family.  Makes great cold meatloaf sandwiches, too.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

I recomend this, its very good and yet healthy too.  I will say that it went a little awry along the way and was too thin so I defrosted more meat and added that and bread crumbs but since we like lots of flavor I had already doubled the spices anyway and it came out fine but made a TON.  It was too much for one meatloaf so used half to do a regular meatloaf and then put the rest into a mini loaf tin to make mini loaves to freeze.  Will definately make again.

This is a really good meatloaf and I loved the addition of the liquid smoke and the hot sauce. I did add more than suggested and also put some of the tomato sauce into the meat which made it even more moist. Thank you Chris!!

This has an amazing flavor! I used 11/2 pounds ground turkey and 1pound of pork sausage. I didn’t have oats or an onion, so I substituted Italian breadcrumbs for the oats and one packet of onion soup mix for the onion( I had read another reviewer had done the same thing). I also bumped temperature up to 375, and cooked for a little over 1 hour. My family doesn’t like tomato sauce on meatloaf, so I left that out. They raved about it, and gobbled it all up!

we love this, but I add all kinds of stuff - lots more herbs - basil, oregano, thyme, fennel, parmesan cheese, etc.  whatever you feel like.  Serve with zoodles and spaghetti sauce.

Not a meatloaf fan, but make it for my loved ones who are.  This recipe is the best meatloaf I've made.  Made the recipe as is and tweaked it the second time by adding onion powder and 3 tbs of italian dressing .  Both were enjoyed.

I didn’t have sausage so I upped the Italian seasoning and added fennel seed and oregano. Came out moist and great texture and great flavor.

I made this recipe many times using chopped turkey.  I didn’t have this in my freezer, I used meatloaf mix, veal pork and beef.  I don’t didn’t change a thing other than the meat I used. Absolutely delicious. I’ll make this again using the chopped turkey, but come out awesome using other Chopped meat

My family loved it! I put the sauce on half. Added about 2 cups of fresh spinach to it because I’m always trying to add veggies...turned out really good.

I made the recipe as stated.  My family did not like the texture and the meat component was lacking in flavor.  We did like the sauce, however, so we'll finish the rest tonight; but I won't be making this again.

One of the best meatloaf recipes I've had. I only had to make two minor changes out of convenience. I used pork italian sausage instead of turkey sausage and a can of tomato soup (adding garlic, parm cheese, and italian seasoning). IMO no changes to the original recipe are needed. I think it would also be great for meatballs.

It came out very good.  Followed the recipe exactly but not sure about the oatmeal.  It gave the meatloaf a strange texture.  Think next time I will use Italian seasoned breadcrumbs.

This wasn't a hit for me.  It was a little too dry and the flavor of the sauce over the meatloaf wasn't my favorite either.  I wouldn't make it again.

I have made this recipe many times. Now I'll tell you I've tweaked it only a little. I love all the ingredients here, but my family love and need spice. So we add Tabasco in the sauce and the meat mixture. Thanks and I'll just keep making it for years to come.

I have never been a particular fan of meatloaf.  But I have made this recipe more times in the past year than I've ever meatloaf in my entire life before.  It is awesome.  My biggest regret is that I did not discover this recipe before my late husband passed. He LOVED meatloaf and would even order it out.  But I rarely made it at home.  I just know this would have been his favorite!  It sure has become one of mine!

This is the first turkey meatloaf recipe I have ever made. THANK you trooworld  for posting this recipe. I need to add this to my regular rotation.  I didn't have the hot sauce and didn't miss it (personal preference). I grated the onion since it was easier to do (arthritis - chopping sometimes an issue) and I'm glad I did that, too.  This is really, really good. You know when you taste something that's a wonderful surprise, you have to just laugh? This is one of those recipes.

Used 1 lb lean turkey and 1 lb lean beef.  I added extra garlic and chopped green pepper.  I didn't have the worcestershire or smoky liquid  and can't say that would have improved it.  It was so moist and flavorful!  Will definitely make again.

My whole family loves this, including my young kids. I use a combination of lean and very lean ground turkey, lower fat sausage, and always double the recipe. Make one and freeze one. I don't use quite that much pasta sauce on top. Otherwise I really don't change a thing!

Who would have thought that oatmeal would work in meatloaf? It sure does.! I am gluten free (due to a wheat allergy) so this was an especially welcome recipe.
I followed this recipe to the letter and it is so good! The flavor is perfect. The onions help keep it moist and the seasoning is well balanced. I was surprised about how nice the texture was with the oatmeal. I did not use all of the sauce, but the leftover makes a great pour over for other recipes.

Not much flavor and not impressed. I thought the sausage would help but it didn't do much.  I wouldn't make this again, or if I did, I would have to add more seasoning.

Delicious; super yummy! and I'm italian! This should be on everyone's must make list. I used 3 lbs of Jennie-O ground turkey,  no other meat. I used italian bread crumbs instead of oatmeal. I didn't have worsestire sauce but used a healthy tablespoon of Italian seasonings and garlic salt,  and skipped the hot pepper sauce and liquid smoke. To control sugar & other additives I used 8 oz tomato paste & 8 oz water instead of premade sauce, and added fresh ground pepper and himalayan pink salt. Top with  grated romano cheese sprinkled over alittle extra sauce, yum!

Excellent meatloaf!  I am normally not a fan of meatloaf but I've made this several times.  This meatloaf also freezes and re-heats wonderfully.  I will make this meatloaf again and again.  The first time I used chicken italian sausages and it kept the meatloaf very moist.

My family enjoyed this recipe. I made it with the 1-lb. ground turkey but used regular sweet Italian sausage. I also put grated Parmesan cheese on the top after baking. I served the meatloaf with fettucini which I added olive oil and some Parmesan to. They went very well together. I will definitely make this recipe again. Thanks!

This meatloaf was excellent. I have been looking for a turkey meatloaf that is both juicy and tasty. I found that and more with this one. My family asked for seconds and thirds.

This was pretty darn good, I added chopped fresh parsley, 1 cup diced canned tomatoes, a garlic clove, and used italian breadcrumbs. I added a little extra smoke flavoring, but next time will decrease the amount of salt. Baked sweet potatoes and lemony greenbeans as a side. Delicious.

I made this without the turkey sausage and accidentally put the tomato sauce in with the meat (instead of on top)! However, it turned out deliciously moist and I went ahead and added another 1/2 cup of tomato sauce to spread on top. Tasted great, even better the next day!

Yum!  Made this with ground pork instead of the sausage, onion soup mix instead of the onions and didn't have Worcestershire sauce or liquid smoke.  I also put pepper jack cheese in the middle and it was quite delicious, especally turkey!  Will make again.

Mushy and uninspiring taste. Maybe beef would save it. I am a ground turkey lover, but this recipe was not quite right for it.

This is a great recipe! I made it for my health conscience husband and he LOVED it! The only thing i changed was instead of garlic powder i used fresh minced garlic...and instead of rolled oats i used whole wheat breadcrumbs...This recipe will be a staple in out home! Thanks!

My husband especially loved this because he really likes sausage.  I thought it was pretty good too.  My grocery store didn't have any turkey sausage yesterday so I used light mild Italian pork sausage and it was good.  Next time I'll add some fresh garlic instead of the powder.
