This has a different frozen texture, loaded with good flavor, low in calories, carbs & fat.  The best way to describe the texture is sort of like a frozen "slurpee."  It also will melt very quickly (so eat fast), but you can certainly enjoy this guilt-free, so go ahead and have a second serving.  Yeah, it may be a compromise to a rich ice cream, but I liked it!

This was very easy to make with only a few healthy ingredients.  I couldn't scoop any out once frozen, so it had to sit on the counter for about 15 minutes before I could shave bits off with a fork. This strange texture left me pining for something creamier, but at least it's a fairly guilt-free treat. I also made it for my 3 year old as a healthier alternative to ice cream, but unfortunately he didn't go for it. Maybe more suited for a popsicle mold.
