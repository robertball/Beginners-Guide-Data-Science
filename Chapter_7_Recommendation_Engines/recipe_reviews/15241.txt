Lost my fave traditional shortbread recipe so adapted this one; use 1 C. confectioner's sugar (cos I doubled it)instead of all white sugar to reduce the sweetness & get a more buttery flavor.  Fructose instead of regular table sugar has a finer texture & blends in easily, but my grocery was out of it.  Also, I always make these a few days ahead of serving, it seems to really let the butter come out on the palate.  A tender, delicious cookie, I always make it for our local Hospice Tea fundraiser.

After making the dough, I cut the dough into 4 pieces and added different things to each. (mini chocolate chips, macadamia nut, cocoa, plain) I also melted chocolate and dipped some them after baking.  This dough is easier to handle than most cookie cutter recipes so I rolled them out and cut them into different shapes with cookie cutters.  Everyone loved them!

I'm from Switzerland.  My family enjoy this recipe  - very easy to do - we eat them with black chocolate and milk at tea time. I add natural vanilla aroma in the butter so there is small black grains in the shortbreads - it's delicious with a very sweet taste....

This is a delicious melt in your mouth shortbread cookie. I mixed them up in my Kitchenaid mixer. I uploaded a photo.  We are getting ready to dip the ends in Dove milk chocolate! I did lower the oven setting to 325 degrees and baked for 25-30 minutes because of cutting them out as opposed to baking like a bar cookie as recommended in the recipe. You won't be disappointed.... YUM!!

Use superfine sugar and you won't get any grittiness, it is not from the rice flour like some other reviewers assume, that is why you use rice flour to make them more light and smooth. You can  make superfine sugar by putting it in a proccesor.

great, buttery flavor! My 11-year old made these all by herself. Instead of making bar cookies, she rolled the dough into a log and sliced it into individual cookies.  They baked up in less than 10 minutes.  The recipe was quick, easy and resulted in a rich, great tasting cookie.

Made it!!! This is surely an easy to follow recipe.  I did all as the recipe but make it as classic as possible by adding pure vanilla extract...and 1tbsp of salt... The dough is easy to be play with too...After I cut it in shapes, pricks it with fork and pour in sugar, I place it in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes. The trick says it will firm up the dough so the cookies will maintain their shape when baked and glad to know that the trick works...   It's indeed a wonderful recipe...give a new twist to a shortbread... but if you are trying to find a -buttery ala walkers shortbread... I don't think this is the recipe you are looking for...

Wonderful, light and crisp.  I used these as a cutter cookie for a family get together. Although very tasty they were very fragil and a bit challenging to cut and  place without effecting the cookie shape.  If your are wanting a yummy decorated cookie for a casual event...this recipe is great, but for special event cookies with detailed decorations I would stick with a more traditional recipe.

Perfect! I did exactly what the recipe said and it came out wonderful. Oh I had a fan oven, so instead of 35 mins, they were done in 25. My husband is from Scotland and he loved it. (for those who don't know, shortbreads are native of scotland:)

This was super easy to make, and the finished shortbread bars looked great.  They tasted very good, too.  However, the rice flour resulted in a very subtle "grittiness" to the texture.  Nothing overly objectionable, but I prefer a shortbread that just melts on the tongue without any grittiness.  For those of you who are wondering where to buy rice flour, it is available in asian markets.

The cookies have great taste but mine were very fragile.  I cut them along the score lines after baking while they were still warm as the recipe suggested and most of them broke :(  Next time I'd wait til they were mostly cool and see if that's any more successful.

FANTASTIC! Per other reviews I used confectioners sugar instead of regular and these were AMAZING. So buttery...but they do tend to fall apart in your hand/mouth but its worth it :)

This was yummy and easy to do but I forgot to sprinkle the sugar on right before putting it in the oven... caught my mistake a few minutes in and it turned out ok after all.  My family loved them!  I was really impressed with how easy they were but I had a hard time finding the white rice flour in the average grocery store.

I made this with a group of afterschool kids, and it was a big hit.  We dipped the cookies in chocolate, which made them crumble a little bit, but it was still delicious and fun to do with kids.

I did not have rice flour but used cake flour instead.  These turned out great.  I have made 4 pans of these and they have now become a staple to have with coffee in the morning!  Thanks for sharing this one.

This was the first shortbread cookie recipe I ever tried and it worked out just fine! In fact I experimented with making a brown sugar cinnamon mixture and layered on half the cookies. I also lowered the oven tempurature to 325 and baked about 5 minutes longer. Cookies came excellent!

Really yummy. I'm putting away my mom's recipe that I use every year for this one! I used icing sugar instead of a cup of white sugar (because that's how I have always done it) and they were nice and sweet. Just make sure to score and cut when still warm. I was distracted for a while by a little one, and they split a bit. Even the 19 month old liked them!

This is a good recipe but I recommend but id you want a softer cookie, melt the butter! It always works to make them softer instead of a crunchy cookie.

The texture of these cookies is perfect and that's half the battle with shortbread.  But I could taste the rice flour and I thought that was a detriment to the cookie.  I give the texture 5 stars and the flavor 4 stars.  Otherwise, it's a great shortbread.  The base isn't very sweet, so you can choose whether to add the sugar to the top.  For me, I like the sugar on top.

Our Gran's recipe (from Inverness) uses rice flour too.
But she used super fine sugar which makes a difference.
We all like the extra texture of the rice flour. Not heavy like a lot of other recipes. It is baked a little hotter too, and I like it done more. It brings out the buttery flavor better.
Nice to find a recipe with rice flour. Good stuff.

I was very impressed with the buttery flavour. I did substitute convectioners sugar for the white sugar....
Made them very light and tasty.

Like my grandmother (Scottish)d did, I used icing sugar instead of white sugar. When I kneaded the dough I added flour until it started to crack. I made both cakes and cookies around the end of October, wrapped them tight, packed them in tins, and stored them in a cool place until Christmastime.
