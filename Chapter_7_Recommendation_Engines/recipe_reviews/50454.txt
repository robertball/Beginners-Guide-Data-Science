My wife and I really enjoyed this dish. But, of course, I did not follow the recipe very closely. (btw: the dog gave a big ‘thumbs’ up for the leftovers also)

I used about a 1 3/4 cup cheese. I used a very sharp cheddar and also some nice jarlsberg rather than a generic American cheese.

Instead of ‘salt’ I used lowery’s seasoned salt, 2 teaspoons. (and after mixing in the salt, I let it stand covered in fridge for a few hours before draining the extra liquid)
I added 3 minced cloves of fresh garlic.
Tossed in some dry seasoning; cumin, basil, oregano, cilantro… and probably some other stuff.

I pan fried them at med-high heat in olive oil until they had a light crispy crust (about 3 minutes per side)

Served with sour cream and a dash of crystal hot sauce.

This was delicious.  We love fried squash, but not the mess. This is much easier and the squash is nice and crispy.  Make sure to make small patties.

My family loves this recipe!! We may use a bit more cheese but otherwise we don't change a thing.  This recipe makes more than we can typically eat at one meal and we store it in a zip top bag in the fridge and it does great!

I used half zucchini and half yellow squash. I also added a clove of chopped garlic to the mixture before frying. It was delicious!

Grateful for a new recipe to help use some of the buckets full of Squash. I might add some garlic or even fresh pepper to give a little added flavor.

Very good! I used 3 little squash and kinda just altered the rest of the ingredients. A very kid friendly way to serve squash. I've been making a lot of squash this summer and the kids are pretty scared of it...but not anymore.

I don't understand the part about draining the squash.  Putting salt on it is supposed to extract water?  Nothing drained from mine.  We ate these with Ranch dressing, and the dressing was all you could taste.  This recipe is going to make a LOT of patties unless you the number of servings.

I couldn't get any moisture to drain off the squash, even leaving it overnight in the fridge (when I mixed in the salt it got pretty mushy. I added the garlic like others suggested and made the patties bigger (fish cake size). It took a really long time to brown them, but they tasted pretty good. I'm definitely going to add some of the spices suggested as I felt they lacked something. Totally worthwhile making, though, and a nice change.

Everyone enjoyed these. I will definitely make them again and would certainly suggest this recipe. Even those that dislike squash should find these patties appealing. I only had four medium squash and they were enough for 4 adults making approx. 3in. round patties. I would like more seasoning next time and will add garlic/onion, etc.

With squash coming out of our ears from the garden, I found this recipe and tried it on my family.  The only way my husband will eat squash is fried and none of my five kids like squash.  However, ALL of them LOVED this recipe and they ask for it at least twice a week and my oldest has even gotten adventureous and made them several times herself.  We even have made them and froze them on wax paper on a cookie sheet and then bagged them and fried them later and they worked fine.  I have shared this recipe with fellow workers who also love it.  KUDOS to whoever dreamed up this recipe.  NOTE:  I only used 3 medium squash and the other amounts I left the same and it fed 7 of us and we froze quite a few for cooking later.  So unless you are feeding an army, I wouldn't do 8 squash, I measured out 8 cups and it worked great.

Yellow Squash Patties' Haiku: "Man, these were so good! Used some squash from my garden, and other stuff too." While picking some squash to make this recipe, I plucked a handful of parsley, and a chubby jalapeno too, to add some color and zip to these patties. Swapped cheddar for parmesan, and couldn't have been more delighted w/ the results! I didn't really shred my onion (more like minced), but I did let the onion and squash drain for longer than 30 min., pressing the excess liquid w/ a clean dish towel. Very tasty and great way to use up exploding garden boom!

These were really good and a nice way to use ALL THAT DANG SQUASH! (Oops, didn't mean to yell :) I added some sauteed garlic and onion (of course) and served with Lebonase Garlic Sauce found on this website. Was a nice side dish for Shish Tawook chicken and skillet bread as garlic went well with all three items.

These were very salty for me. I used 4 cups of shredded squash, pressed most of the water out. I could taste the cornmeal (which isn't a bad thing to me). I also tried oven baking them, and they didn't turn out too bad although they all stuck to the pan a little until they crisped up. I did one batch with some cajun seasoning added, which helped the flavor a bit.  A good basic recipe and idea to use up that yellow squash. Thanks RS!

GOOD, good, good and easy, too. And I don't normally like summer squash. I halved the recipe and used both yellow squash and zucchini.  I made a horseradish sauce to serve with them.  Sour cream, mayo, horseradish, couple of drops of hot sauce, and a teaspoon of sugar.  But I also tried putting catchup on my patties and I loved that.

This dish was excellent! My mom, fiance, and kids who hate squash loved this. I followed the recipe aside from using zuccini and squash together. I didnt have corn meal so I used bread crumbs instead. Everyone raved! Of course I didnt tell them until they ate it what they were. Just called them fried cakes. I am going to try to bake them today. Thanks for the recipe!

Okay that was awesome! Of course I added mushrooms and green onion since I only had 1 squash that my husband had left over from a different dish, but it was very good! I will definaetly have again and maybe make the patties small for an appetizer.

So good and uses a lot of squash.  I served with a fried egg and toppings (avo, tomato, salsa, sour cream).  I will make this again.

These are good.  I adjusted the recipe to use one rather large yellow squash and just added the dry ingredients to make it stay together.  This will be a repeat recipe for us this summer.

I've made this recipe three times and it's good, but kinda bland as written. It needs about 1/2 tsp of Tony Chachere's and a dash of hot sauce in the mixture for seasoning. Also I've found that butter and a little bacon grease is the best oil to cook it in, not vegetable oil, as butter always produces nicely browned and light patties and the bacon grease lends more flavor. And cook it a little cooler than medium, mine tend to cook too quick or want to burn at the recommended medium.

I cut the recipe in half the first time and it still made so much more than the 3 of us could eat. The patties are delicious so I used the recipe as a guideline to make a smaller amount. I grate one yellow squash and 1/2 a small onion and add 1/2 cup of cornmeal, 3/4 cup of flour, 3/4 C shredded cheddar, one egg and salt and pepper. I also grate one carrot into the mix and I also added grated zucchini one time. Great way to get extra veggies into your diet.

Yum! Yum! I always soak my squash b4 frying in Zesty Italian dressing overnight. Just a personal preference :) Other than that, I follwed the recipe & boy!! Were these good!! My 10 yr old son, absolute squash-hater lol, LOVED these!! Made them about once a week this summer & I always had to hide a few so I'd have some the next day!! :) Oh, I like the left-overs cold, straight out of the fridge!!

Very good, a tad bit on the salty side though. Would make again but decrease the salt a bit next time. Served with creamy garlic horseradish spread from this site, these are flavorful enough though that you really don't need anything to dip them in. Thanks for the recipe:)

I make these at least once every other week.  So easy and different than the traditional fried squash I make during the summer time.  Everyone wants the recipe when they try these for the first time.

These are great! Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The only issue at all is with the quantity of squash. Eight squash could be anywhere from 2 to 20 cups. I used about 7-8 cups and it turned out great.

The whole family loved it, even the 4yr old that won't touch a veggie.  I did change slightly as others, cut recipe in 1/2, added some garlic, cumin and paprika.  Thanks for helping me use my squash in a way that won't go to waste.

Very good!  I don't usually like cooked squash.  Will try adding cilantro,red pepper flakes next time to give them a little more zip.

These are delicious.  I halved the batch and still used one whole egg.  It was so good.  I only had self rising cornmeal, so used that in place of the flour and cornmeal.   Thanks so much for posting!!

Not to popular at my house. I ate most of them. Kids and hubby didn't like too much. Maybe if I had skipped the onions altogether instead of cutting back.

These are delish!  A wonderful way to eat your veggies!  :-)  I pretty much made it as is, with the addition of a few spices and garlic.  My squash was still draining quite a bit of juice after over an hour, so I ended up actually squeezing it out over a bowl.  Worked pretty well!  Would definitely make these again!

Loved these. I had a lot  of yellow squash from my garden, and decided to try this recipe. My husband doesn't care for squash and he didn't even know, he thought it was potato. He liked them too. I did add a chopped vadalia onion. The topping was great on it.  This is a keeper.

I saw where some people had trouble getting moisture out of the squash. Maybe our squash has more moisture here but I added salt to the squash and set it in a collander for an hour. Then squeezed the squash and everthing was fine. I thought this was a good BASIC recipe. You can experiment with it. I added garlic and a healthy amount of Tony Cachera's original cajun seasoning. The sweetness of the squash and cornmeal with the bite from Tony's made this a very good side dish.

Very easy and yummy. My husband, 17 month old son, and I all loved the recipe. I took the advice to add seasoning salt, fresh black peppr,  and doubled the cheese. I pan fried them and served them with a bit of sour cream. I will definatley make them again. Next time I may try adding garlic or maybe a little hot pepper to kick up the flavor

I though these were good. The cornmeal kind of threw me off a little though, it seemed to overwhelm the other ingredients. I may make these again but adjust the cornmeal to our liking.

I only used 5 medium to large squash and got 38 patties. I didn't have any cornmeal so I substituted with another half cup of flour, which turned out well. I also added two cloves of garlic. I was tempted to start shaking on the seasoning, I'm glad I didn't. These were delicious as is,no dipping necessary. I recommend using a cast iron skillet if you can. Go as light as you can on the oil in the pan, they crisp way faster. I did a batch with too much oil and they never crisped they just stayed soggy. I will definitely be making these again.

These are great. Based on previous reviews I added more cheese, minced garlic, and extra seasonings. Even my 2 year old gobbled them up. I'll be using this recipe a lot.

I do these patties with zucchini as well. I altered the recipe slightly by adding finely sliced  string beans and grated carrot, and used 1/2 cup of parmasan instead of the cheddar and more breadcrumbs to make a firmer mixture. I then coated the patties with extra breadcrumbs before frying them, to prevent sticking. Delicious, and well worth a try if you have a lot of squash on hand.

Really good. I forgot the cheese, added a carrot, used a combo of cornmeal, breadcrumbs, and flour. Seasoned w/ S&P, garlic powder, basil, cilantro, chili powder, and a dash of smoked paprika and cumin. Pan fried. Toddler and husband approved. These would be yummy with some hummus.

I had to improvise a bit I didn't have cheddar so used parmesean from a can and used multi grain bread crumbs in place of corn meal. I loved this, it was easy to make my patties held up quite nicely maybe it is because I used my cast iron skillet!

I put a plate on top of the squash while draining and used half zucchini/half yellow squash. It did go together very quickly, so next time I will add seasoning and perhaps some diced hot peppers. I placed them on a rack fresh from the pan, to maintain the crispness until I was finished cooking. Served with Greek yogurt mixed with dill.

I didn't care for these at all. They were SUPER time consuming to prepare and cook. I really like zucchini patties, that I have made, and assumed these would be really similar. I found the centers to still be gummy or uncooked when the outside was done and I cooked them on medium. The better ones were the much more crisp ones, but they still lacked over all flavor too. The dominant flavor was flour, onion, and grease. A few got eaten, but a majority of it unfortunately got tossed along with the batter.

I did not give it five stars for three reasons.I added garlic cloves, cumin, basil, and oregano as per another reviewer. Second, there was not enough egg and therefore the patties fell apart regardless how long I cooked them. I doubled the corn meal and added two eggs. Finally, I split the oil in half and used the difference in butter to make them less oily. The patties are very tasty! I served them with both sour cream and apple sauce. I would, however, only make these for some special occasion as they are fried and absorb too much fat during cooking.

These were delicious!!  My entire family enjoyed them, even the "squash haters"!  I did as some of the others suggested and added a little seasoning,like fresh garlic and garlic powder.  We put a little bit of hot sauce on top when we ate them!  Definitely a keeper!!

I love this recipe. Where has it been lurking on allrecipes all this time. I would have made this years ago. I found it was not that easy to get the patties to stick together. However they cooked wonderfully. I topped them with sour cream and peach salsa. Great way to use up summer produce from the garden...which I will be doing!

I followed the recipe exactly, unusual for me, but I did this time.  The patties turned out pretty good, not too much flavor, though.  But they tasted better after they had cooled a little, and the flavors were a little more evident.  Don't know what I'd do to make them better??  Maybe a little white pepper, to give them a kick?  All in all, they were OK.  Don't know that I'll make them again.  They are a fair amount of work for something that is only pretty good.

Very good!! It's one vegetable my 10 year old son WILL eat, he even asks for seconds!!!  i made a few adjustments. i used flour instead of cornmeal (because i didn't have any) and i added a clove of garlic and they came out great!!! I find that they are best when made very thin because the crispy brown outside is the best part.

I didn't change a thing. I thought they were really good. I ate them with butter rather than sour cream.  I didn't think the batter was runny at all, but I also drained the squash, as the receipe recommended. I didn't add baking powder either as some recommended. I didn't think that was a good recommendation for this recipe. It is great just the way it is, following the instructions to a T. I will be keeping this recipe.

This was ok but a little bland as prepared (I did not do the salt treatment before hand but did sprinkle with salt while cooking). The consistency was great. They stayed in patty form when they were cooking. I added plenty of pepper and then garlic powder. Still kind of bland. Added hot sauce and that helped. These wanted to be good and essentially they were. Just need a little something extra.

delicious - I used 1 sm-med sized butternut squash.  To peel: first boil for 5 min, drain water & cool.

these were so good and easy to make. i reccomend these highley.i made this again and used zucchini along with the squash mixed together. i also used whole wheat flour instead of white . you could not tell the difference. they were delicious. i also used extra virgin olive oil and just cooked on a lower heat. the olive oil gave it such a great flavor. finally a vegetable recipe the kids are sure not to fuss over.

These were a hit with my family.  I put jalapeños in half of the recipe and they were excellent.  Also I put hot sauce in the sour cream and mixed it.

I have made these 3 times.  Once they were terrible because I did not get all of the water out of the squash first.  The other two times they were great.  I use Zatarain's Fish Fry in place of the flour, makes them spicy.  Yum!

We loved these patties.  I also like the fact is uses a lot of squash to make them.  This is helpful to garden growers.  I used sharp cheddar cheese and added more onion.  We top ours with Parmesan cheese as well as sour cream. I also used olive oil to fry our patties in.

Absolutely wonderful as is! Once I cooked the first half I put in just a bit of ground red pepper and a little heat was a nice addition as well.

I was looking for a recipe to use up a lot of squash and this one had 'most' of the ingredients I had on hand. I used about 8 squash and it made 12 patties.    Following a previous example, I used Lawry's season salt, a 1/4 of freeze dried onions (I was out of fresh), one clove garlic, a teaspoon each of cumin, dried parsley, and dried chives.  I added 1 cup shredded mozzarella, 1/4 C feta, and 1/4 parmesan.  I also added 2 finely diced jalapenos.  They came out surprisingly well!

7/10/11 Adding an update....you HAVE to drain the squash or these will not come out right.  Made them again tonight just as the recipe calls for and they were really good.  I also made a coleslaw out of zuchinni and that was good too.

I added green onion to this recipe to give it color and will next time make it with a little green pepper. I love squash so I liked the recipe and so did my dad. My boyfriend, (city boy from Louisville) does not, so you almost have to disregard his opinion. Was a really good fritter. will make again.

I would have ranked this 4.5 stars if half stars were available, but as they are not, I rounded up!  This is a very good recipe to help use up all the yellow squash I grow in the summer.  It has a nice light flavor that is a great side for bbq chicken or ribs.  I added in a little garlic for some extra flavor, then dipped it in hot sauce for some kick.  Thanks for sharing, I will definately make again.

I love this recipe.  I reduce the amounts, guestimate quantities, they always come out delicious.  My favorite way to eat the leftovers is in a wheat tortilla with salsa-nothing else!  Delicious!

Great recipe.  I used 2 large homegrown squash – I don’t think they would’ve equated to 8 mediums, which might have something to do with the fact that I didn’t have an excess moisture issue but I also did the following: I omitted the salt to get the moisture out – I’m too impatient; instead, I nuked the squash and onion for about 2 minutes, put in a colander then with a clean dish towel squished the squash until I wrung out all the wet stuff.  I seasoned the squash “to my taste” with garlic powder, seasoned black pepper and seasoned salt.  I added 2 cups of cheese instead of 1 – the more the merrier in my house and sharp cheddar is definitely the way to go. I made 18 3” patties.  Great served with a lil' sour cream. Next time, I use the griddle instead of a skillet as it would be quicker. A great and different way to eat squash.

I pressed the squash/onion mixture with the back of a serving spoon while it was in the colander to help get more moisture out.  Even doing that, the patties weren't as crispy as I'd hoped.  I did enjoy the mild flavor and thought the corn meal added a nice texture.  Maybe next time I make these I'll actually squeeze the squash dry, just like you would frozen spinach.

These were a great use of extra garden squash! But I found them to be a bit bland as called for in the recipe. I ended up adding quite a bit of extra seasonings like fresh basil, carrots. However, the texture was wonderful and after I made the changes to suit my tastes I was very happy with them.

This is one of my all times favorites. The patties will make an appearance at the Christmas dinner. I've added a little more spices, such as basil, seasoned salt, cumin, cilantro, and of course garlic. Outstanding with sour cream or salsa!

Very good recipe. My daughter said it reminded her of potato pancakes. I agree with the other reviewers that I wish they would have said what size squash or change it to cup measurement. My first try I used yellow and zuccinni squash and with the zuccinni squash being so much bigger, I found out too late I had way to much squash. It turned out still good. Next time I will use hopefully the right amount and it will be even better. Thanks for the recipe.

I didn't use all the salt, so maybe that is where the flavor comes from.  They were flavorless and the texture was unappetizing.  A drawback to this recipe is not having a better measurement for the squash.

I made as is. A busy weeknight and I was looking for a way to get hubby to eat his veggies.  I had all ingredients on hand and it delivered as he went back for more.  Quick, easy and a great twist on my standard squash saute.

Downsized it since I only needed to feed two and had only two squash, worked great!  Family loved it, even the avowed squash-hater said it was good.  DH said to get more squash.  Definitely a keeper.

I only used flour in mine only because I did not have any cornmeal.  I also omitted the cheese.  My patties turned out rather large and I also had to use more than 1 T of oil to cook them.  Next time I will try putting some garlic in them and making them smaller.

Made this tonight. It was very good and easy recipe. Will make again and omit the salt. Will either shred and let drain longer or use a cheese cloth. Way too salty for us.

Flavor was good but I didn’t care for consistency. Crisp outside but a little too soft inside for my liking. But my wife really liked them so I expect to be making again. I think I need to find a way to dry the shredded squash/onion better which I think will firm up the consistency. Easy to add other spices to taste. Thanks for recipe!

My rating for this dish was 1 star, but my dad gave it a 5 so I averaged it out. The biggest problem for me was the overwhelming ONION flavor. I could not get past that and was not able to finish a single patty. Additionally, even excluding that issue, it was not a particularly flavorful recipe and would need a lot if doctoring, if I was to make this again. My dad smothered it in BBQ sauce, so maybe that's the reason he enjoyed them so much. It's a good thought, but this recipe unfortunately didn't fit the bill for me.

One of my favorite recipes! I'll use different cheeses depending on what I have at home. I also mix the onion and squash with salt and let them drain for at least an hour, sometimes more. The salt helps remove the moisture. Making them again this week. Everyone now knows me for my squash patties!!! Delicious!

I love this recipe.  It was easy to do.  No much liquid came out so I pressed with the back of large spoon and it did.  Will try next time with different seasonings added as others have done.  It does make a lot, so for the two of us I will make half the recipe and have leftover for another day.  It is a great way to use the load of summer squash we get, a little different.  It has that fried taste without all the grease.  I used a great non stick pan.  Will make these again.  Great for when company comes, makes plenty!  They grand kids would probably eat this veggie.

Something seems like it was missing in these. I didn't care for the flavor and you have to burn them to get them fully cooked.

First thing my husband said is really? I hate squash. Guess who told me to keep this recipe?!? The only change I made was I squeezed the onions and squash through a towel instead of doing the colander and salt. Make these little guys small and crispy. Love using summer veggies. Thanks!

I was surprised that such a simple dish could be so good!  There are only 2 of us, so I cut the recipe to a third.  Instead of draining the squash and onion in a colander, I placed it between layers of paper towels and pressed the water out, which was very effective.  I also removed the seeds from the squash before grating.  The only other change I made was adding a bit of garlic powder.  No sour cream needed, either -topped with a splash of hot sauce and these were amazing!

I have made these for years but the only difference in mine and this recipe is I don't use cornmeal and add 1 tsp sugar to it. You really do need t drain the squash or your mixture will become very runny. The only exception to that is if you are making a small batch that you put  all directly into the  pan as soon as you are done mixing, otherwise, it gets watery

I followed the recipe, but the mixture was simply too wet for a good result. I ended up adding almost a cup of panko just to get it to the consistency that it would fry in the pan. The onion especially did not dry at all. I also cooked them for much longer than 3 minutes on each side - probably closer to 7 minutes on each side. I would recommend adding a little oil after each batch to help the next batch get crispy. My last batch turned out perfect after I made all the tweaks - they were tasty at least!

This was a great way to get my toddler to eat squash.  I made several changes: used whole wheat pastry flour, added garlic, wheat germ, cumin, coriander, and turmeric.  Also, cooked them in coconut oil.

Because of what I had on hand, I reduced this to 3 servings, used red onion. Added shredded carrots, clove of minced garlic & smoked paprika. 

It took over an hour for the squash, onion and carrot to drain/dry.
Next time I will add green onion to the mix.

These were fantastic. I did not change the recipe one bit, if anything they were a tad on the salty side. I ended up squeezing the squash to get the moisture out since it wasn't draining on it's own. Really great with hot sauce on top-can't wait to make more. What a great way to use the abundance of squash from the garden!

Truly wonderful recipe!  My kids loved it (which is an even bigger bonus), so it makes for a tasty and easy way to get the kids to eat their veggies!  I added some zucchini to the mix, which made it better than ever!  A new and inventive way to eat squash!

These were fantastic! Shared this recipe with a few others and they made them and loved them as well. Very easy to adjust spices according to what you like. I added some garlic powder, onion powder and seasoned salt.

DELISH!!!  I actually made these as a veggie/bread combo for dinner. Made a "pig" out of myself with these things!  I didn't change a thing in the recipe although, I tried them with sour cream, didn't care for it so much.  Will make these again and again!

My boys and husband fought over these patties. The boys thought they were hashbrowns by the looks of them and I never told them there was squash in them! What a hoot! I have a little left to make patties with tomorrow evening. I'm going to put a little garlic and some sort of seasoning in them. We'll see if they are still a hit!

I would maybe use a different type of oil - BUT, my husband absolutely loved these. I only had 2 squash, so I just added 1 more egg & a little more cheese - they turned out super. He was immediately requesting I make these again.

This recipe calls for 1 and 1/2 tablespoons of salt, and it was way too much for both my husband and I. Next time, I will only use 1 and 1/2 teaspoons (or less). My squash were quite large so I used just two. The consistency came out just right with the amount of flour and cornmeal used in the recipe. I also added some chopped green pepper, and another small pepper (of unknown type) from my gardern.

Great change from the ubiquitous, yet tasty, squash casserole.  Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. Just the right amount of cheesiness.  I had to beg for a single patty to reserve for lunch the next day. A big hit with my family.  Thank you, thank you for the recipe.  I'm making it again tonight, by the way, to go along with venison kebabs marinated in the Venison Gyro marinade from this site. Also whipped up a gazpacho from this site, too.  Can't wait for supper!

These were easy to make and we all liked them.  To speed up the process, after 15 mins of letting the grated squash and onions sit with the salt on them, I squeezed the liquid out.  We will definitely be eating these again.

Awesome way to use up summer squash.  I've made these a couple of times, and started making the flour/cornmeal ratio a little more like 50/50, but otherwise, don't mess with the recipe.

FANTASTIC!! So simple to make. My family were standing over me waiting to try and once they tried, they wouldn't leave. The only thing I changed was I used a big spoon and mashed down on the squash/onion mixture to get more of the liquid out. Will most surely be making this one again and again, and again!

I made this with a couple garlic cloves, shook in some basil, oregano, and cumin, but did not include the cheese.  I thought they were mild and ok.  Surprisingly, my veggie-averse husband thought they were great!

These were very good!  We had catfish one night and I was frying hushpuppies and forgot these were supposed to be cooked in the skillet and dropped a TBS. of the mixture into the grease and this is officially the way we eat them now....instead of hushpuppies!!!

I might have done something wrong, but I did not care for these. The flavor was okay, but there was way to much squash, they were very hard to flip when on the griddle because they were falling apart so badly. Sorry, but I won't be making these again!

I hardly give negative reviews, but the flavor of these was not worth the effort. Shredding, mixing, sticky hands, dirty griddle, dirty food processor... ugh...These were messy to make IMO and they tasted like they were nothing but flour mixed with veggies. I did not use cheddar cheese since I didn't have that on hand, but I did use a flavored Jack cheese. I was saddened to waste an expensive locally made cheese on this recipe that had great reviews. I enjoy trying new things, but sadly I will not be making these again.

I give this 5 stars, but bear in mind  that yellow squash is yellow squash and this isn't a miracle cure, but a very good use of this over abundant ingredient none-the-less. I think the best approach is to mix the squash, onion, s+p and let everything sweat for at least 1/2 hour and then drain. You can get more water out using a cloth and pressing out as much as possible. Squash is such a large part water that you really need to take this step or your patties won't really get crispy and cooked all the way through. By the way I had banana peppers in my garden as well. I minced a couple and tossed them in the mix. Topped with hot sauce it packed a little heat, but wasn't overwhelming. I actually forgot to add the cheese the first time and liked those as well.

Excellent simple recipe.  Our garden overfloweth with squash, so I am delighted to have another great way to use it.  I scaled the recipe down to serve six and used two eggs.  Served them with sour cream and salsa.

Very good, very easy to make! I let my squash drain for about an hour (with a sprinkling of salt) and it was not moist at all. The patties stay together well, too. I scaled this recipe for 2 and I got just what I wanted: 2 good sized patties.

better than hash browns for breakfast! I loved them. i used half whole wheat flour and half all purpose and added some garlic powder. after 30 minutes my squash was still really wet so i squeezed out the rest of the liqued. I also used a little bit less salt because my cheese was really salty. I used monteray jack cheese but next time i will try sharp cheddar cheese. Can't wait to try again.

I thought this turned out very well.  I let the shredded squash and onion mix drain overnight in the fridge.  Next time I'd add a little more cheese!  Very good.

Fantastic!!! Made this for our Sunday family dinner.  Everyone was scared at first and only took one--they all came back for seconds and thirds.  All the patties got eaten up!!  I followed the recipe exactly but I added 1 Tsp Old Bay Seaoning as I am addicted to that flavor.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

My 12 year old (pickiest eater alive) not only ate this, but commented the next day that he thought "those squash things" were pretty good!  Endorsement enough for me to make them again. (The non picky eaters in the family all loved them too.)

The best!!  I didn't exactly follow the recipe but found it to be an awesome idea for squash from the garden.  I omitted the onions and only had a dab of cheese, but I only used two squash to feed three people.  I just blotted the shredded squash with a paper towel and threw in a heaping 1/4 cup flour and a loose 1/4 cup corn meal, an egg, salt and pepper, and a little cheddar cheese.  I fried them up in a good amount of hot oil(i made huge patties, eight total)...awesomeness.  A real keeper in my country kitchen.  We will plant squash again next year just to make these!!

Bleh! Waaay too salty. When I added more cornmeal, milk, and cheese to try to cut it, I realized johhny cakes would've tasted much better.

The dog wouldn't even eat this!

This is my new recipe for summer squash!! I used two large squash, seemed to be a perfect amount. Next time I'm going to add a little orange zest and see how that tastes.

Very good! Better than expected actually. I was a little unsure of how these would turn out but since we were looking for ways to use up excess squash from our garden we gave it a try. Pleasantly surprised at how they turned out. The cornmeal is the key ingredient!

This is the most exciting thing I've done with yellow squash. Everyone loves it and I make it weekly since it's growing in the yard! Thank you! Delicious!~

Very good way to use squash.  I used yellow squash and parmesian cheese.  I also added a pinch of red pepper for a little spice.  They did not stick at all in my pan and were perfectly golden brown.  So much easier than frying squash slices which takes so much time and makes a big mess.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was wonderful and different.  Hot sauce got my attention being from Louisiana.  I did change the cheese and did half cheddar and half pepperjack. Didn't need the pepper or hot sauce.  Kind of like fritters.  Mmmmm good!!!!

Good have used a little more spice, but a nice variation from the normal way we squash.

The patties fell apart on the first 2 batches, so I tried to salvage the ingredients by putting the rest in a casserole and baking it--really didn't like the flavor or texture.

My first effort was a disappointment.
The patties stuck to the pan so badly that I only finished cooking half of the mixture and tossed out the rest.
The flavor was good but the cheese might be the reason for the sticking.  I will try again.

A very tasty way to help use up some of the MOUNTAINS of squash form the garden.
