Make sure that you don't confuse the teff flour for teff grain, both of which are available.  The flour is mixed to make the crust and the whole grain is added like the other ingredients.  When doubling the recipe, reduce the water a bit to around 3/4 cup.

I've made it twice now.
I roasted the pepitas, flax and sesame seeds for added zip.
I also made them savory with 1/4 t. each of garlic powder, onion powder and a touch of fresh ground black pepper.
thanks!
I'm going to try sweet version now with rice or sorghum flour instead of teff and play with it.

Very versatile and easy recipe. I made two versions using dark and white teff flours. In neither did I use teff grains but used fonio grains instead, the taste is similar. I used different seeds than written. Where both flours were very good, I found that the brown teff flour had a much nuttier and toastier flavor than the white flour. I used soaked buckwheat groats in the brown teff version and dry buckwheat flakes in the white. The crunch of the whole groats is a plus here. I used sesame seeds and soaked quinoa too. If you keep with the ratios of the main mixture, teff flour+tapioca+water, your additions are infinite and don't interfere with cooking time. I cooked both at the same time, on the same baking sheet in 37 minutes. What a lovely recipe, thank you for sharing it with us.

I have tried two gluten free recipes from this site and both are very good. This cracker is exceptionally crispy. I really like that. The batter is surprisingly loose and I wasn't sure what to expect. It did very well. I wasn't sure about the flavor at first but it is very good. It took a bit for me to be sure. I had to make my own teff flour because I only had the seeds. It worked well in the Bullet.  Great recipe. Will make again.

I've made these three times now and they are my favourite crackers! I added a tablespoon of olive oil to the mix, as well as chia seeds and sliced almonds (along with all other listed ingredients). I baked them at 350 degrees and flipped it over after 25 minutes (cooked for 45 minutes total). Thanks so much for sharing this!!! I am gluten free and have a hard time finding good tasting crackers that are actually healthy! These are delicious!!!

Not sure if I'll make this again.  Even though I greased my containers they stuck like crazy.  Had to chop then out.  Baked then for 40 min. at 375.

These crackers are delightful! I had to substitute potato starch for the tapioca flour, using the same amount. I did find that these cooked much more quickly than I anticipated, so it pays to watch them carefully and perhaps set your timer for about 15 minutes and go from there. The flavor was terrific! That these are fat-free is a real bonus! Since these have no saturated fat and are so easy to whip up, I will be making them often. Thanks for a great recipe!

Thank you.
I made it exactly as described.  It is easy to make.  I added Chia seeds instead of the Teff grains.
Results are very tasty and crunchy, but a little more grey than I would like my foods to be...
Any ideas as to why the crackers turned grey?

I've made these crackers twice...both times they crisped perfectly .
Prepared cookie sheet with coconut oil, added some dried rosemary and cayenne pepper to "batter"
Used less salt as I only sprinkled a pinch on  the unbaked mixture before baking.
Using an offset spatula makes spreading a thin cracker easy!

Super simple recipe that yields tasty results. The instructions didn't note how or when to cut the big slab into cracker shapes, so I just broke it up into bite-sized pieces after it crisped up completely. I had to bake in two stages--one at 40 minutes, till the edges were totally crisp, at which point I broke them off and continued baking the rest of the slab for another 20 minutes or so until all of it was crisp.
