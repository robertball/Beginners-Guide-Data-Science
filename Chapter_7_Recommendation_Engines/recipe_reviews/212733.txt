Wonderful and mildly flavored.  I prefer strong flavors, so may jazz it up next time with some garlic, thyme or Greek seasoning blend.  My husband loved it!

This is the recipe that got me hooked on ground lamb. The burgers are VERY moist and savory. I followed the recipe exactly but I don't see why you couldn't mix it up a bit by putting different herb and soft cheese combos in the center, such as feta cheese with finely chopped fresh rosemary or a spreadable white cheddar with fresh savory. This recipe elevates grilled burgers to HEAVEN! Another idea ~ use naan bread or pitas or fat fresh flour tortillas, the new thin buns work great too.

Very tasty. I filled them with the herb cream cheese- and added a bit of goat cheese as well. I had no watercress, so after removing the burgers, I sauteed some spinach in the pan with remaining burger juices and the little bit of herb cheese that would not fit into the burger. No sandwich rolls around, so served the burgers on top of the spinach.  Well received at my house!

Baaaad-a**! (ok that was pretty lame...) Even my kids loved these. I did not bother to freeze the cream cheese, just spooned some on and spread it out. I used Philadelphia chive and onion cream cheese instead of making my own, and I also forgot to season the lamb at all before making the burgers. Salted the burgers after cooking and they were awesome. So easy and good I am mad I didn't come up with this one myself!

Juicy, delicious burgers! I mixed 1lb of lamb with 1lb of beef to make it cheaper, and could still taste the distinctive lamb flavor. My cream cheese herb mixture remained gooey after some 20 mins in the freezer, but that doesn't really interfere with being able to pack the cream cheese inbetween the patties. I also used Tamari sauce instead of Worcerstershire, and served on regular buns.

These were quite good.  I don't eat lamb often, so the flavor of it is always a little surprising to me (in a good way).  It was delicious with the cream cheese middle.  It was also quite easy to make.
