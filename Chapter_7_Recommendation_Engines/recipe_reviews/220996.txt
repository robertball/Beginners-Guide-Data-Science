This is my 1st attempt on making a pie crust from scratch.. so I followed everything exactly and was kinda nervous at first but it came out really well! Flaky and really light! Chef John never fails to impress! Oh and I had some dough left for half a crust, lolz..

Exceptional.  Very easy instructions.   The addition of the vinegar really makes the crust very flaky.  I will recommend this recipe to all my friends.  The video is very very good.  Just a note, use the metal chopping blade, not the dough blade.

After 50 years (yes, 50) of trying without success to make a decent pie crust, I have finally found this ***wonderful, delicious*** recipe. THANK YOU Chef John. If you were here I would kiss you... on the lips.  ;-)
Watching the video several times before I started helped me a great deal and, as directed, I followed the recipe fanatically, using a scale to measure *exactly* 12 ounces of flour and 1 cup of butter (226 grams). I am so delighted that I no longer suffer from pie-crust paranoia and I can't wait to experiment with new fillings. This first success was a cherry pie with a lattice crust but next week I'll attempt an apple. Interestingly, many people claim that a shortening-based recipe is superior,  but this recipe (and Martha Stewart's recipe that many people adore) prove that butter is a godsend to cooks and bakers everywhere.

Very very easy, indeed.  I ended up with enough for 3 crusts, but I tend to end up with more no matter the recipe--I think maybe my pie pans are small.  I used this crust for the Tarte Aux Moutarde (perfect complement!) and the Tomato Pie I, both of which are on here.  I did have to add a bit more water, but that is going to depend on your humidity anyway; it isn't the recipe's fault.  The crust is very flaky and delicious.  A good complement to savory dishes.  Thanks for the recipe.

I have been baking for a very long time, & pie crusts always made me nervous and were hard to conquer. Until now that is! This recipe is very easy to work with- it rolls out beautifully without breaking apart. And it delicious. This will definitely be my go to recipe from here on out! I partially roll the crusts inside Saran wrap & then transfer to lightly floured surface. Easy as pie!

I made this crust with no food processor...So easy, followed the directions to the letter.  Chilled my steel bowl for extra coldness and mxed everything by hand.  Made two batches, one for my chickent pot pie and the other for apple turnover.  Will post again after making those two dishes.  Thank you, saved me  an easy 10 bucks in buying already made dough.

Wonderful pie crust! I use it for all my crusts from quiche to apple pie. If I need a sweet crust I just add sugar to taste. I don't even refrigerate it, I  just roll it on wax paper and then just flip it over on to the pan, easy! My mother used to tell me "Oh you make such wonderful fillings" now everyone wants my crust recipe too! Thanks Chef John!

I can't believe I messed up this recipe this bad and it still turned out OK!  I only put 1/2 C butter in by mistake - I kept adding ice water thinking the recipe was wrong - nope - I was wrong!  It still turned out pretty good - not as light/flaky as it would had I not been blind as a bat - but still usable.  Used it with the peach berry pie from this site.  I'll use the recipe again - and wear my glasses and I bet it will be fabulous!

INCREDIBLE!  I can't say enough good things about this recipe.  It is the flakiest pie crust I have ever made.  It not only is delicious, it is so easy to work with.  I watched the video first, which is an added plus.  It was so easy to make the dough but the way it handled after refrigeration was outstanding.  After cleaning my food processor, I wished I had made extra dough to freeze.  Next time I will!  Thank you Chef John for another INCREDIBLE recipe!

Easiest pie crust I've ever made. And all done in the food processor! Great flavor, easy to roll out & doesn't rip when you stretch it out.

Made 4 pies and loved the easy way to combine the butter and flour in the food processor.  Video helped me to know when to quit blending. Rolled out easily and was super easy to work the dough.

Oh yes Chef John!  This is the recipe I've used for years, and IT'S PERFECT EVERY TIME!  I just make sure everything is cold, including bowls and utensils, etc.  Definitely freeze 1/2 for another recipe.  
A KEEPER!! :)

I used this recipe when I made Chef John's Caramel Apple Pie. This recipe was so easy and so tasty I don't think I will ever use another crust recipe again! Using the food processor makes it a breeze, and it literally takes less than 5 minutes. I was afraid that the apple juices from my pie would make the crust soggy (as has happened with other crusts) but this crust held up unbelievably well! No sogginess at all, even after cutting a piece and the surrounding exposed crust was sitting in the juice for several hours. It was just the right balance of thick and crisp but soft and flaky... you have to try it to see what I mean. Excellent recipe!

I have to get better at giving pie crusts a nice edge. Mine didn't look very pretty but that's my fault.  This recipe was easy and really good. My food processor isn't big enough to hold the entire volume of this recipe so I had a few issues with that. Also, I bought salted butter by mistake. I was still happy with the flavor though because I was making a savory dish with the crust. In the future I will stick to unsalted butter, especially if making a pie.

Great flavor. This pie crust is perfect as is. The only recommendation I would make is to turn the douh out onto a piece of wax paper, put another one on top, roll the dough between the two pieces, and turn it into the pan from there. Sooooooooo much easier to manipulate!

I love this pie crust.  I made it exactly as written.  The apple cider vinegar was a great addition.  It was very flaky, and great for a pot pie recipe.

I was in the mood for a quiche and had everything on hand except shortening so I found this all-butter recipe and I'm actually going to start making this one instead of my regular shortening recipe from now on. I had to leave out the cider vinegar since I didn't have any and I didn't miss it. It was perfect. Very flaky and buttery. Seemed way more organic than my other recipe. Even the leftovers were still flaky and not soggy. I will add the cider vinegar next time, just out of curiosity, but even without it, we loved this crust. Thank you!

Easy to work with and so easy make in food processor. I used 1 cup white wheat and 1 1/2 cups AP flour.  Other than that, I followed exactly and was happy with the results. Waiting for pie to cool to do the taste test!  The crust was soo good! I had compliments on the crust and the entire pie! This is my crust recipe from now on, and the apple pie! I used Chef Jon's Classic American Apple Pie from his site Food Wishes.

Yes, you must try this. It is the most tender, flakiest pic crust you and make and easy too. Remember to handle the crust lightly after taking it our of the food processor. My family will not let me use any other recipe for pie crust.

I used this crust for this (carmel) apple pie recipe: Allrecipes' Apple Pie By Grandma Ople and it turned out to be the very best pie I've ever made and ever eaten, ever!  Delicious.  Perfect!! It was so good I made all my friends eat it too and they were pretty darn impressed with my culinary skills :)

This is clearly a no fail pie crust. I’ve been using it for the past six years and never has it failed. I use wheat flour and it still comes out nice and flaky. It’s the apple cider vinegar for sure. Leaves the crust very good.

This is the first pie crust I've tried in 30 years.  I've never had any luck with them so just gave up.  Watched the video (great tip about putting cut up butter in freezer) and gave it a try.  Using the food processor made it so easy and it turned out flaky and tender!  I used it on a chicken pot pie and it was delicious.  If I can do it, anyone can.  I thank you Chef John and so does my husband!

I found this recipe very hard to roll. It came out thicker than ones I have used and liked in the past.(Mostly due to my inability to roll it!) I like that it has butter and no shortening in it but I probably won't use this again! Sorry. :(

This is a fool-proof pie crust!!  I logged onto my account, just to give this review.  I was making a chicken pot pie for the first time, for dinner tonight and because of the ease on how to make this pie crust, I figured to give this a shot.  I started w/the food processor but found that it was too small for the job.  I had to cut the butter into the flour mixture manually.  Then, when it was coarse, I transferred it back to the food processor.  Big mistake!  It made the dough a very gummy & doughy consistency!!  I still finished it, as I needed crusts for the chicken pot pie.  However, I was prepared for this to come out to be one of the worst pie crusts in history (not the recipe's fault).  I had trouble shaping it, rolling it out (this is my first try at making a pie crust from scratch) and pre-baking it.  End result=the flakiest pie crust.  EVER!  Hubby and in-laws were dishing out compliments left and right about the crust!  Thank you, Chef John, for this no-fail recipe.  One call out:  I didn't anticipate for the pie to shrink a bit, but this is a small, very minor flaw, and can easily be my own fault.

Thank you for this one! I can't get shortening where I live and this worked great! I made a double batch to make turnovers with some homemade cherry pie filling I needed to use up. It's been 2 years since I've made Pumpkin Pie....looking forward to it, thanks John :)

I'm the pie maker in my extended family and my pie crusts have always been well received. Until this recipe, I always used shortening in my crusts. Well, this recipe has converted me! At our last get-together, everyone kept asking me what I did different with the apple pie, they just adored it! This crust is deceptively simple yet absolutely delicious and super, super easy using the food processor. I've made this crust several times now and I sometimes make it by hand (no food processor) and it comes out great either way. Thanks Chef John!!!!

I gave up making homemade pie crusts years ago because they never rolled right for me.  This recipe is a winner!! First of all it is so easy to mix in the food processor and then rolled out perfectly.  This pie baker is very happy to have found the perfect recipe for a homemade flaky crust..THANK YOU!!!!

This is the best pie crust, hands down! Flaky, tender and tasty.  It is precisely the same one I use, except for using a food processor to mix it, who knew!  Thank you for sharing, Chef John!

Followed the recipe exactly as stated. Made a deep-dish, double crust apple pie using one of Chef John's video apple pie recipes (no link to an online recipe). Delicious.  Crust was flaky and tasty. Had always used an old "standby" pie crust recipe but the food processor made this SO much easier!  Only downside was the crust suffered from refrigeration after the pie was made. It became "sticky" and stuck to the pie plate.  Suggest NOT refrigerating the pie when done. That is how I will handle it next time but this will be my new go-to pie crust!

This was my first homemade crust so I'm no expert but this one sounded easy so I tried it and it was.  Had to add a little more water and pulse a few extra times to get it to come together at the end.   Crust was better than any I've bought from the store and easy enough that I won't be buying any more.

This is a great crust. I do have a problem, though. I find that I cannot reach the consistency as shown in the video using the same amount of water/cider vinegar. I added two teaspoons of water and still didn't reach that "cohesive" blend. I may need to add more water but I want to hear what others say. I live at about 20 feet above sea level and that may make a difference. I will add an additional 1/4 cup water to get the dough to start to gather as a lump rather than using the recipe that leaves it as granules that I press together. It makes a great crust but it makes handling a problem which leads to less than great results visually. Lots of ideas here, but this is the crust I was looking for: tasty, flaky and just the basis of any great recipe. Could use some help here if you have any ideas.

Excellent.  This is just like the recipe I've used for years, with the one simple change of 1 Tablespoon cider vinegar.  I was astonished at the difference that made.  Isn't chemistry wonderful?  I do wish Chef John would always also give instructions for NOT using a food processor, since many people don't have one or don't like to use it for little projects.  I only use mine for big projects like canning.  It's just not worth the bother when making something as simple as a pie crust.  An ordinary hand pastry blender is just as fast and effective, and a whole lot easier to clean up.  Just make sure you get the strong bent-metal kind of pastry blender, not the wimpy wire kind.

When I typed in "easy pie crust" I was resigned to finding a recipe for just an OK pie crust, nothing spectacular.  This was the first recipe that popped up and when I saw it was from Chef John, I knew I didn't need to look any farther.   Chef John is a genius!  And this recipe was no exception.  Buttery and insanely flaky.  And it could NOT have been any easier to make.  It was perfect for my quiche and, with a little sugar added, will be perfect for my Turkey Day pies.  Big hugs to you, John.  I love your taste.

I searched for the perfect pie crust recipe for years. I only want good ingredients and refuse to go with one that uses lard or shortening. This recipe makes a perfect and buttery crust. It is so easy to make and the dough was extremely easy to work with. I used a total of 8 tbsp of iced water. It is the best pie crust I have ever made!

I have made pie crusts using a food processor for years. I decided to try this recipe because it uses butter instead of shortening. It was a crumbly mess.I ended up throwing it away and starting over.

This is by far the best pie crust for chicken pot pie that I have yet to try! I have never in my life been a pie baker until recently. We bought a Showtime Rotisserie (which I very highly recommend!!) and have been looooving the chickens we make now. With one exception... the left over meat. Since no one in our family is really big on sandwiches, the leftovers were going to the dogs. Until I thought... lets try a chicken pot pie. Since then I have been mastering the art of pie crust making! I have tried several from this site!! None have come close the the ease and yumminess of this recipe! It was simply perfect. Tasty and very easy to roll and bake! Thanks again Chef John!

Easy and delicious. I doubled the recipe and put it in the freezer with wax paper between the patties - and it was exactly as good after a week as when fresh. I didn't have a food processor so I just cut the butter into 1/8" pats and mashed it into the dry ingredients by hand, which worked just fine.
I also tried a variation in which I used vegetable margarine instead - don't do this! It made the crust tough and almost impossible to cut!

Love how easy the dough is to roll out, unlike many others which after resting in the refrigerator require decent arm strength. What's really tricky is the slumping of the crust at the edges and shrinkage. Even with a more gradually sloping dish, the crust doesn't have enough structure to stay up the sides and the sad crust slumps down. Made this more than a few times. The only way to succeed is to use way more crust (cannot divide the dough evenly) and prop it up over the top rim quite a bit, which results in a second mini crust.

I don’t have a food processor so I used my stand mixer with the whisk attachment, being careful to not over mix. I did not freeze my butter either- just took it straight out of the fridge and cut it up. I followed the recipe with these slight modifications and it turned out awesome! Best crust recipe! And so easy! Keeper!

First time I made a pie crust in decades. It came out very well.  I weighed the flour, as directed. It was a bit dry overall, so next time will just measure the flour. Since it's a butter crust, I recommend warming up leftover pie for a more tender chew.  Since this is only a crust  recipe,  I had to search other recipes for the filling and baking instructions.

Wow!  I used this Chef John pie crust recipe yesterday when I was making a chicken pot pie.  I did use my Kitchen Aid food processor and it could not be easier to chop that chilled "unsalted" butter into the flour mixture.  I put the wrapped discs into the fridge for about an hour and a half (as the recipe says at least 30 minutes), but I found that the discs of pastry dough were so hard when I took them out to roll them that it was a real feat to roll out both discs to a 10" diameter.    However, the pastry did not break up or crack at all while I made my attempts to roll it out!  I followed Chef John's instruction to a T and measured the flour to 12 ounces on my kitchen scale, which turned out to be a bit more than 2 and 1/2 cups, ( I used pre-sifted, all purpose flour),  and I even weighed the two disc halves and you'd be surprised how they may look even to the eye but they were way off of being even to start out with!  I put the sliced, one cup of unsalted butter in the freezer with my filtered water to chill for about 15 minutes.  I used the egg wash on the lip of the bottom crust and the lip and top of the top crust, just like Chef John illustrated in the video attached to the recipe.  I did fold the edges under to double them like Chef John does and when both double edged edges were together I crimped them like Chef John did which made the edges bake up puffy and golden.  All I can say is, WOW!  The crust puffed up while baking in the oven and the end result was almost

I borrowed my sister’s food processor to make my first pie crust... it was worth it! This recipe was very easy to follow. The only mistake I made was not sprinkling flour on the mat before rolling out the crust. My pie dishes are a bit deeper than normal, so I’m going to add a bit extra flour and butter to stretch it further.

Great pie crust.  I chill my dry ingredients to make certain the butter stays in small pieces.  I also use a traditional tool to cut the butter into the dry ingredients so as not to create heat that happens with a good processor.  This makes for a flakier crust.  And I use Vegan butter instead of dairy butter because I ditched dairy a long time ago.

Chef John does it again. I seek out his recipes because they are consistently good. This one is no exception. I made (all mini pies) blueberry hand pie, egg and ham pie, blueberry pie, and a walnut pie with this crust and still had some left over. I made 2 of the pies in mason jar lids, so I could make a few different ones. This crust came out light and flaky, this is the kind of crust you won’t find left over on the plate. It complements savory and sweet pies, and is super easy to make and work with. Flaky and light. Yummy. I actually made lattice pie top with this... so proud of myself. I will make this again and again... and thanks for the weights on the measurements in the video! Helps a bunch!

This is a delicious and easy pie crust. I think I added a bit more water to get it to come together, which I think has to do with our lack of humidity rather than the recipe. Definitely chill before rolling out, or it will stick to everything, because it is so buttery.
It made a scrumptious crust for a berry pie. Simply fantastic!

6.23.18  Not sure what happened here, but this pie crust was a total disaster.  I followed this recipe to the letter, even measured the amount of flour to 12 ounces (which he said to do in his video).  I refrigerated the dough discs for a couple hours, but it was simply impossible to roll out, wouldn’t hold together AT ALL.  I threw it away, drove up to the grocery store and bought a package of Pillsbury® pie crusts because my peaches were ready to go and I didn't have enough time to make another crust recipe.  Real disappointment, waste of time, and 1 cup of butter.

I followed directions exactly and came out great! My food processor was too small so I made half the recipe twice. next time I might just try to mix by hand.

I only have a 3 cup mini food processor, so I had to do this by hand (mixed with 2 butter knives-lol). And this came out great!! Chef John never fails! I used this pie crust to make pop tarts.

I didn't make any changes and it turned out great! I had a perfect amount of pie crust to make a 9 1/2 inch apple pie. It's sooo flaky and buttery, our whole family loved it. Definitely worth making it instead of a store bought one.

I am one who has consistently struggled with pie crusts all of my life. This one, however, was as simple as.. well, pie.  I followed the recipe to the letter the first time, and realized that in MY dry climate (the desert of Arizona), just a splash more water did the trick. My pie crust turned out BEAUTIFULLY (four times), and this will be my go-to recipe from now on. Thanks, CJ!

I made the dough as the recipe required. I did not prebake my crust but i did chill it and put a sprinkling of sugar on top before i put in my fruit pie filling. 
The flavor is good, note that when chilled after baking, the crust gets very hard. Next time i will leave the pie on the counter.

I don't have a food processor, so I used a pastry cutter. Only changes I made were to cut it in smaller chunks and add it gradually. Turned out great! I've officially conquered my fear of crusts-from-scratch.

divided it in half to whip up a single crust. It still made plenty for a 9 inch pie crust with quite a bit left over. I was able to use my small Cuisinart also so clean up was a breeze. I will go to this recipe again.

LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!  I always hated making pie crust because it was such a pain to cut the butter in. This recipe fixes that! So amazingly simple to make and so amazingly delicious!!! I put my 2 sicks of butter in the freezer for about 30 minutes then did as the recipe said and just pulsed it in processor with the flour. Why have I never thought of this?!? I followed the recipe exactly except I did as others said and added a bit of oil. I used 1 1/2 tsp. of coconut oil. Also, contrary to what a few other people said, you should ALWAYS chill your pastry dough before rolling it out and using it. I chilled mine for about and hour while I prepared the rest of my ingredients for my pie.  I  used my pastry for a from scratch, homemade apple pie. Absolutely beautiful, flaky, delicious crust. This has been added to my favorites page and will be my new go-to crust for all things requiring a crust. Thanks so much for sharing this!!!!!
P.S. When making a double crust pie, you should always brush the top crust with beaten egg whites to get a nice beautiful color.

This was super easy and really delicious! I did most of the mixing by hand using a pastry cutter since I don't have a large food processor, but found that not that difficult.  Using 1/4 of the crust was perfect for 2 "apple hand pies" from Chef John as well, here on AR.  These made the perfect New Year's dinner dessert for us, thank you Chef John!

My first time making pie crust was a success! I was trying to follow the recipe exactly but my mini food processor couldn't handle all the ingredients so I was a 1/2 cup short on flour and only half the liquid. I also only had salted butter on hand so I skipped the salt. It still turned out great! It was easy to handle and tasted great. I made mini turkey pot pies and they were a hit. No more store bought pot pies for my family!

This was my first attempt at making homemade pie crust. Was skeptical about the cider vinegar but turned out perfect!!  This was super easy and super good. I baked at 375 degrees until brown!  I wrap edge of crust with foil for the first 40 min. Then took it off!!

Tastes great, however the dough takes some working and a lot of flouring to roll into the pie crust. However, once it's worked, it bakes beautifully, cuts into accent pieces cleanly, and tastes lovely.

First successful pie crust ever! I love the way this recipe is so specific about how many times to pulse the food processor so the crust doesn't get overworked. I didn't have unsalted butter so I used Irish butter, which is extra creamy and not too salty. Then I just didn't add any salt. I don't know if it makes a difference, but I used unfiltered apple cider vinegar (the "mother"). Absolutely perfect crust. Family loved it!

Perfect crust every time. SOOO easy!! I just made chicken pot pie using this recipe with only 1 stick of butter. I think that I have always only used 1 stick of butter, not a WHOLE cup. I have never had a problem with this ratio. I have always thought of it as being very buttery, almost too rich...I'll try it with two sticks next time just to see how that comes out, too: probably will be too much butter for my taste ;)

Holy cow, does this produce a flaky crust! It was one of the most simple crusts I've ever made, and it was very easy to work with. In the future, I may add a bit more salt and/or some sugar for the flavor, but texturally and taste wise, this is an excellent base recipe. Thanksgiving will now be so much less stressful!!

Recipe tastes very buttery. Great simple recipe. It was late at night and I didn't want to wake everybody so instead of using a food processor I kneaded the dough by hand (squeezing clumps together). Came out perfect. needed 1 or 2 more tbsp of water but that's it.

The texture of this was good. Not really flaky, but it held up well for pot pie.  I had to add an extra tablespoon of cold water to get it to not be so crumbly when I was rolling it out. The pie crust tastes like butter, though, so if you don't love tasting pure butter this won't be for you because it is a strong taste. Good texture, strong butter taste.

It was the easiest pie crust ever, and very, very tasty.  Sometimes the  shortening-based pie crust have a certain after taste to me.  In terms of flavor, this was a more tasty crust compared to shortening-based crust.  The recipe was also perfect in making a very "unsticky" and "easy-to-roll" dough repeatably, and being far more  forgiving to over handling then shortening based pie crusts.  However, sadly, it was not a flaky melt-in-your-mouth crust like you get from shortening-based crusts, and even went so far as to being very solid.

I made this crust without a food processor. I used a whisk (and a lot of arm strength) and stirred and stirred and stirred. I also melted the butter a little bit (10 sec in the micro) to make it easier. It turned out light, flaky, and delicious! Definitely my "go to" pie crust for years to come.

This is an awesome pie crust recipe. It goes together easily and tastes fantastic! I used it for a pumpkin pie and actually WANTED to eat all of the crust.

I made it with dairy-free "butter". Since it tends to get soft faster at room temperature, I froze it before putting it into the food processor.

My helpful hint: roll the dough out between 2 sheets of parchment paper. I peeled one of the pieces off, put it in the pie pan (dough side down), pressed it into place then removed the other piece of paper. It kept my rolling pin clean and also made no flour mess to clean up.

I plan to try it with gluten-free flour today. Thank you for this yummy recipe!

My friend used her shortening recipe that she cherishes and I used this one.  After we made the pie crusts we used the left over dough to make crisps.  We both agreed my crust was flakier.  I had to pulse it several more pulses before it started to come together as a ball and kept it in the refrigerator when working with one half at a time.  I will use a little sweetener the next time I make it as the flavor lacked a  little something, although I am not sure what it needs.

I've always made simple flour, butter, water pie crusts. After watching the video and hearing why the vinegar was added, I decided to incorporate it because I was going to a party and wanted to guarantee everything would turn out perfect. I made an apple and a pumpkin pie. They turn out gorgeous looking. Took them to the party. After dinner, people try to dig into my pies... The crust is hard as a brick. Edges, top, and bottom. I have never had this happen before.

Followed exactly, but just mixed with a pastry blender as I don't own a food processor. Came out nice, didn't get soggy. The vinegar made me nervous as it made the raw dough stinky, but was completely undetectable in the finished pie.

Fantastic! This is exactly for 2 9-inch deep pie crusts (eg quiche). You may need to add a little more water but remember that the more water you add the less flaky and tender it will become after baking. For quiche didn't need to bake the crust blind, baked the quiche once.

This dough was pretty dry and crumbly, and needed extra water.  Otherwise, it was easy to handle and baked up to a nice but rather tough crust.

I don't know what went wrong. I followed the recipe and video exactly, or so I thought, but the mixture came out extremely crumbly. It would not hold together and I could not use it.

The crust tasted just fine. I liked using the food processor to make it - that should have made it simpler but I made 1.5 times the recipe and I had issues when I added the liquid: it leaked out of my 9-cup food processor! So just a warning, I think it's best to make exactly one recipe at a time. Otherwise, method and flavor are good.

This turned out great.  I made a half recipe, and used cold water rather than ice water.  It made enough dough for two 4" glass dishes, each about 1" deep, that I filled with a pear-pie filling (also from a recipe on here), and had enough dough leftover to put a thin layer of crust on top.  So a half recipe basically gave me two pear "pot-pies," which were great.  It might not be the best tasting or flakiest crust I've ever had or made, but given its simplicity, it is super "bang for the buck."

This pie crust was very easy to make. It came out pretty flaky too. But it think it needed some sweetness. Doesn't pie crust usually have sugar in it? Maybe my filling should have been sweeter. I'll try it again with about 1/4 c sugar.

first if you use butter that is salted, then don't add the salt.  That was my first mistake and it was super salty.

I love this recipe. In the summer, I load it up with fresh chopped herbs for a chicken pot pie. It is beautiful. I am generally a pie crust purist, cutting in the shortening with two knives; but this recipe is great for savory fillings.

This was the first time I made a pie crust.  I liked how easy it was.  My whole family loved the apple pie I made.  Tomorrow I'll use the other pie crust to make a sweet potato pie.
It has been some time since my last review of pie crust.  I just want to say that I don't have a food processor, with clean hands I mix the ingredients in the order listed.  They come out great!!!

I love a crust that doesn't have eggs in them.  These were so easy!!!  What I do first is to place the water/vinegar in the freezer to chill while prepping the flour & butter.

This is the best pie crust recipe.  Perfect every time.  I actually replace one cup of the flour with whole wheat flour for a nuttier taste which I love. I will use this crust forever as it is the best I have used in 35 years.

Perfect! Followed directions as noted for a flakey and tender pie crust that was perfect. When using for a savory pie I sprinkle my rolling surface and dust with whole wheat flour. Adds just enough whole wheat goodness without compromising the integrity of the recipe. Thanks Chef John for another winning recipe.

Every pie crust I've ever made has always turned out only so-so, especially because I won't use shortening. Well, after making this for Chef John's Pumpkin Pie and Old Fashioned Coconut Cream Pie, I now know this is my new pie crust recipe! I followed this recipe exact, the only thing I would like to figure out is what timing and temperature is good for it if I'm pre-baking them? Thank you Chef John for another great recipe!

Fantastic recipe and be sure to watch the video, "How To Make Pie Dough" by Chef John. Everything will become clear...make sue to follow it exactly. Weigh the flour if you have a scale...12 oz. 
As always be sure to read the reviews.

Very flaky and easy crust EXCEPT... I would bake the bottom crust alone for about 5-10 minutes before adding the filling. It was incredibly soggy. But the top was amazing, and so easy to make!

I have a terrible love, hate relationship with pie crust lately.  I want a good, easy to work with all butter pie crust.  I have tried so many recipes and had issues with all of them.  This pie crust recipe actually worked for me last night.  I couldn't believe it.  I usually have a problem when it comes to blind baking the crust; it always droops.  Something I did last night worked; I don't know what it was but I am anxious to try again!  I only needed 1 crust so I stored the other in the freezer for later.  Thanks for the video showing how to do it; that was a huge help to me!

Have to say this is my go to pastry, never fails. However I've never been comfortable with volume measures like "cup" so i have converted all the measurements to metric.

THE BEST pie crust recipe. I make Chef John’s pumpkin pie as well and it’s always the first thing to go at gatherings. I’m obsessed with this pie crust because it is perfectly crumbly but enough to hold together while placing it in the pie pan. Keep up the great work Chef John!

I've been in search of this recipe all my baking life. A buttery, light, flaky pie crust to enhance all the hard work that goes into a homemade pie. Look no further everyone. This has a wonderful buttery flavor, and is light and flaky, likely due to the coldness of the butter, refrigerating the dough 30" or more, or perhaps the vinegar. Yum!

This crust is perfect. I went out to buy a food processor to see if the crust would be better than my usual making it by hand. It was! It is flaky and rolls out beautifully. Highly recommend this recipe!

Made this twice and followed the recipe exactly - came out perfect! I rolled the dough very thin and it was large enough for a shallow 9" pie dish, top and bottom crust, but be strategic because there won't be much left over.

Buttery, flaky and delicious. Rolls out nicely and is easy to handle.  Easy to make in the food processor.  A keeper.

I made the pumpkin pie from Chef John Nd pie was amazing but the recommended crust didnt taste as I envisioned. It was not flaky, kind of harder than it should have been. I followed the recipe precisely so not sure what went wrong. I used a food processor.

For a two pie crust it was great.  However, to make a blind crust, there were no directions so far as temperature to cook or time to cook.  It shrank badly as I had to guess at both.

Excellent pie crust! It's super easy to make. when rolling it out, be SURE to use plenty of flour. You'll need to sprinkle your rolling pin and the top of the dough several times. I like to roll my dough out on parchment paper.

Thanks Chef John!  Hear me out - take excess pie dough and roll out very thin. Cut into odd shapes (or not) and dust with cinnamon sugar. Bake until golden brown. You're welcome. haha

omg sooooo flakey, crispy, tender, and flavorful.  every time I make pie I experiment with the crust, but no more. I think the addition of apple cider vinegar does the trick. I did not use the food processor, but my hands. (That’s right, not even a pastry cutter.)  I finally achieved my ideal piecrust. Next time I’ll try the food processor and see if it makes a difference.

I've tried many pie crust recipes, but this is definitely my new favorite and I will be using it from now on!  It was so easy to make using the food processor  and easy to roll out. The taste along with the flakiness was incredible.

I looked good but the baking method did not seem right because you start hot a reduced the temp to 300 to finished. By the time the crust was done the apples were like sauce. Next time 400 til done.

Thank you Chef John! For 40 years, I've made my mom's pie crust, which is not adaptable for a food processor. It is delicious, but as I've aged and developed shoulder problems, I really wanted a food processor recipe. I've tried literally dozens, even those without butter. (I love butter, there's no margarine in my house.) I tried your recipe this weekend, after watching the very helpful video, and I've finally found a tasty, flaky pie crust recipe for my food processor! I've made four pies so far, and will bake more today. (Pictured is my apple pie, which hubby consumed in 24 hours.) I know you were adamant about measurements, and I do weigh ingredients, but I had to add a smidge of additional water to bring it together. I also think it's needs a tad more salt, but that could be my personal taste. That aside, thank you again!

Oh  my . . . this is now my "go-to" pie crust recipe! Very simple directions using a food processor with chopping blade (as opposed to dough blade). I made as is, however did add 2 extra Tbsp of ice water to better adhere the dough. So easy to work with and to roll out. I understand it's a 2-crust recipe, however can see why some reviewers divide it into 3, as it is a bit thick for only 2 crusts . . . but, oh, so yummy! I loved the accompanying video which has good tips for us novice bakers . . . oh, and don't forget the egg wash after assembling your pie!

Tastes pretty good. A little flaky but not really bad. I would make sure and roll it out really thin because it scrunches back up a lot. I cooked it at 400 degrees for 15 min. I will definitely be making this again.

This pie crust was my first attempt at making pie dough and it turned out great! I made it without any changes for my spinach quiche and the crust turned out nice and flaky. I'll be making my own pie dough from now on and will be making all sorts of pies during the holidays. I'm hooked on pies! Thanks!

I absolutely love this pie crust! So delicious. I’ve made it about 20 times now and i think i mastered how to really roll the dough out. Kinda tricky because its a bit crumbly coming out of the frige after sticking it in there to chill. But working it a bit with your hands to get the dough to “soften” a bit is the key. After that, shape it into a flat circle, flour the work surface as well as the top of the dough and use the rolling pin to roll it out and you will see that it is easier to work with. Keep sprinkling flour so that work surface and dough surface does not stick. I use this recipe to make a chicken pot pie using the turkey pot pie recipe on this website. Amazing combo!

I love this crust as it is inexpensive but excellent quality. Sometimes I will add cheddar cheese. Then after I roll out I brush with butter and sprinkle with paprika and kosher salt. It's like a savoury cookie. Thank you, Chef John, for sharing your talent.

Really nice recipe. Did this by hand instead of with a processor and it was extremely delicious. 

made this for your quiche recipe and quichelets the next day. 

will keep this as my go to as the recipe is simple and the crumbly, flakey texture is amazing and better than store bought.

I was surprised how good this was.  It has such a flaky taste.  I used the  recipe for a single crust pie.  I had some left over and my single crust was a little thicker - but I love it.  So yummy.

I have been making pie crust for many years using the old fashioned Crisco method including using a pastry cutter. I have been using a silicon mat to roll out the crust. I have had reasonably good results using this method but it is tedious particularly when making multiple pies. today I tried this recipe using my processor. And as an old dog I learned to roll out my pastry using a wooden board. This recipe rolled out beautifully. I had to use 2 more TBSPs of water. My pie is a savory meat pie so I crimped the edges using a fork as I don't like a thick crust edge for savory pies. It baked up lovely and light looking. I will make again using my kitchen scale. I think this is my go-to crust going forward.

Easy to work with pie dough. Very plyable, be sure to pre-cook  pie dough into pie crust.

I have been looking for a good pie crust recipe for a long time.  Have tried many and some were pretty good but this crust by Chef John is by far the best one yet.  Followed directions and crust turned out perfect.  Will be my go to pie crust. Thanks for another winner Chef John.

DO NOT overwork! The crust should be crumbly when you separate and refrigerate it; not smooth or it will shrink when baking! Only four stars because there is no cooking direction. 350 for 30 mins or so depending on your oven and the filling. Flaky, buttery, the cider vinegar is the secret.

This is my new go-to pie crust. Turns out tender, flaky and chewy every time. The food processor method is so easy. It's important to follow the directions, especially with regard to temperature. I put my measured water and apple cider vinegar together in the freezer for 5-10 minutes before I add to the recipe.

This was a very good crust.  Very light and flakey.  The only thing I would say is that after  I had it in the refrigerator it was a bit hard to roll out.  Otherwise, I loved it and used it for a homemade chicken pot pie recipe.  Will definitely use this again.

I have made hundreds of pie crusts, even posted a video on youtube of my favorite recipe and process. But in the desire to improve my skills I tried this recipe and process, and now use it exclusively. I have not changed it one bit. It works perfectly everytime and produces a wonderful crust, easy to roll out, perfection. Something about Chef John's recipes, they always work as advertised, require minimal hassle, and taste incredible. Thanks!!!!! 

Oh, I thought of adding the review since I am about to make the recipe...again!!!!

I have used Julia child’s recipe for pie crust for over 30 years. Today I was making a quiche and decided to try this recipe because I didn’t have the 2 tablespoons of Crisco in Child’s recipe.I now have a new recipe!  Crust was easy to make , easy to handle, and came out flaky and delicious. I’ve said it before and I’ll probably say it again, I’ve never made one of chef John’s recipe is that didn’t come out perfect.

The recipie is super simple and easy. The only thing I changed was the food processor. I used a pastry blender and it came out pretty well just took longer. The main thing I wished was here that isn’t is how long it cooks for! There are no instructions for after you put the desired filling in the pie crust. I guess I will just have to wing it!

I finally found a pie crust I love. The addition of apple cider vinegar was key. I did add about a tablespoon of sugar since I wanted a sweeter crust. And I found I needed almost 2 tablespoons more water than it called for. But it was easy to work with and the flavor was wonderful. My guests said it was the best pie crust ever.

Flakey and delicious! This was my first time using this crust and it is now my go-to pie crust. I used it for a pumpkin pie. Love the flavor using butter instead of shortening. Browned nicely and was a delicate crust. Looking forward to making more pies with this crust. I received a lot of compliments and was asked for the recipe. Thank you, Chef John.

Easy to follow recipe that needs one minor tweak! I made this and followed it to the letter and it turned out great. However, I realized that I “forgot” to add cinnamon (I didn’t, it wasn’t in the recipe) and that was the only grumble from my family. I made a note on my printed copy so that next time it is 5-Star perfection!

I made this, exactly following the recipe, in my old, cheap Hamilton Beach food processor.  Took about 3 minutes.   It came out perfect.  I used it for Chicken Pot Pie.  The family was wowed.  ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL pie crust: definitely a keeper.

No, there doesn’t need to be separate instructions for use without food processor. It’s common sense. Even if you threw everything together at once, it would still be the best crust recipe.

Easy to follow. I added nutmeg and cinnamon as I rolled it out. Turned out pretty good for my first text.

Excellent a melt in the mouth, flakey delight.  Always used lard or shortening before but found the butter was far superior!

This pie crust is great!  I measured, then weighed my flour.  More so out of curiosity to see what the difference would be.  The measured was slightly less so I added a smidge to get the proper weight.  I divided the portions equally by weight and refrigerated the discs.  Since it was getting late, they actually sat over night.  I made mini hand pies with apple filling, rolling the dough into 4" rounds.  I baked a few, but froze the rest.  The crust was flaky and held up well.  Definitely a keeper!

This is a good and flaky pie crust. I used margarine and cake flour and it still tasted great. However, it gets too sticky at times when rolling out onto a table or countertop, even if dusted with flour. Using a combination of wax paper and flour makes things easier and neater. I made this by hand, it was a bit tedious but it turned out great.

It wasn't all that great. I can't fault the recipe, however. I made a mistake with the cold water and vinegar. BUT I will try it again. The pie and crust held together and everyone thought it was good . . . but I know . . .  I could have be somewhat careful in preparation. No offense Chef John!

So incredibly easy! I was nervous to make a crust from scratch. I always buy the pre-made kind. This was a cinch (I made it with my 6 & 8 year old girls) and so delicious! Thank you Chef John!!

I have made flaky fruit filled pies for years.  However my delicate pastry never stood up to my quiche recipe.  I was very pleased with this recipe.  Liked the taste, the texture and the fact that the crust didn't become a soggy mess under  the quiche filling.  Also noted that it was an absolute pleasure to work with.  I would recommend this recipe to novice bakers.  I will definitely use it for quiche.

It is a good recipe but instead of using a food processor I just  work it with my fingers until it looks like wet sand then add the water and vinegar. Always has worked for me

I made this pie crust for my fly by the wind chicken pot pie and it was great! I have an injured camera, but I will say that I broiled it for a few moments to get a better done crust.

After hearing how hard it is to make pie dough, I was terrified to try.  But Chef John walks you through and it turned out fine!
I made a half batch because I only needed the bottom, and scalloped the edges like in the other video he suggested (by scalloping between two fingers).

I got to the very end and discovered that I could not find my rolling pin.  I used a jar that I have used before... now it looks like a paper thin amoeba the size of my pie pan... Stuck to the plastic.  It is 3:00 am on Thanksgiving morning, and I sure hope the store is open and has pie!

Best pie crust I've ever made.  However, I used salted butter and omitted the salt from the recipe.  It freezes well so I always have some pie dough in my freezer.

This is the best pie crust recipe I have ever made! So flaky and delicious! Do not over process the dough. Refrigeration is a must. Use an egg wash on edges and it bakes up nice and golden! Do try!

I was in such a hurry when I made this that  I forgot to read th directions first.  Hence I put all the ingredients in the food processor & never had the time to chill the dough before using it.  I was still very pleased with how it roled, handled, baked & tasted.  very good crust.  I used it for a chicken pot pie that very very, very good!

Too much salt!  I used it for a turkey pot pie and it was super easy but way too salty.  I would half the salt next time.

Every time I make this dough, I follow the recipe to the tip. I weigh my measurements, I check it over, I make sure that it's correct. But for some reason, mine always cracks and crumbles when  I roll it out, even though the pie crust is supposed to be soft and supple. And even when I refrigerate it for up to 3  hours,  It's still way too soft and will stick to the surface that you roll it out on, even when it's floured like crazy. It's way too hard to work with, and even when you cook it , it is too crumbly and fragile. I have made it 7 times, and it has never worked. I will not be making it again

I don't usually follow a recipe for pie crust, but thought it might be quicker just measuring out and mixing.  It really wasn't.  It came out to wet even though I did not add the full 7T of water,and I had to fool around adding flour.  So, be careful in adding your water so you don't have to fool with it.

This crust is very easy to make. I think it is a little bit too "wet" so add the water sparingly. I'd say half the water and then add the rest of the water slowly. The crust is light; I loved it. However, I use European flour so this must be part of the lightness.

I'm SOOOOOO thrilled to have this recipe, because I refused to buy the store bought crusts, and my previous skills only allowed for graham cracker crusts.  Just follow the recipe, it's that simple.  No changes, no additions, no nothing.  In fact, any time you search for a recipe on this site, put "Chef John" into the search tool - I've used 6 or 7 of his recipes so far, and simply can't improve on any of them.

This is the easiest pie crust to make and it turned out perfectly.  I used the food processor as suggested and it was so quick.  I made it for a chicken pot pie and it was fabulous.  This will be my go to for pie crusts from now on!

Super easy recipe, and I LOVED that I was able to do it in the food processor. Making it by hand previously was usually a failed process. Did this recipe exactly as described, and I was enthralled with how flaky and tasty it was to eat. Making it again this evening for spinach quiche (which is also on this site with feta cheese). YUM!

I have enjoyed baking for decades, but have never had success with any pie crust recipes... until Chef John's.  Honestly, hands down, a perfect pie crust.  Extra bonus is that dough can be frozen for later use. Thank you, Chef John.

I've never made a pie crust before, and my mom doubted I'd manage it this time. I will never buy a premade or roll out pie crust again!! It was super easy and the food processor made it a clean way of making one, and it tastes delicious!!!

This is a great way to make a pie crust! This sounds really snooty, and it is. I chose this recipie because  it called for real butter. I spend summers teaching in Brest, France. The butter in Brittany is unlike any butter anywhere. I brought a pound back with me this year and used it in this crust. It was amazing!

I have tried many pie crust recipes over the years, and this is the one I am finally satisfied with.  The crust is very flaky, and making it in the food processor is an added bonus.  I can whip this up in no time.  I have been using this recipe for a while now, and I wouldn't change a thing.

this was pretty easy to make though I needed to add another tablespoon of water because it was a little dry and I didn't use a food processor.
I haven't made a pie or pastry yet so we will have to wait for the final product.

I followed Chef John's recipe to the letter and the pie crust turned out just as promised...fluffy and crispy! I used half for his quiche Lorraine and half for his caramel applie pie. Both bought out ouhhhs and aaaahs from my family :)

For years I used the store bought pie crust, the kind that's rolled up in the box. It was very convenient.  One day I  noticed "lard" in the ingredient list ! I was upset and sad, as I can't have any pork product in my diet. I turned to AR for a pie crust recipe  and this one is my favorite.  It's so easy to make, good with sweet and savory pies and freezes well.

I have been making homemade pie crust for 30 years without much problem.  I decided to try this recipe since it had butter instead of shortening.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It rolled out wonderfully, didn't stick at all, and tastes like hard cardboard.  The dough was like pizza dough, not pie crust.  It is so hard that we are trying to eat the filling without the crust!  A very big failure that wasted 3 hours of my time...I made 3 pies with this recipe.  Very sad night at our house.

I rarely bake as it terrifies me (I tend to burn cookies and cakes come out too dry), but this pie crust was delicious according to my husband. It was very easy for me to make and much better than store bought. I used it to make a fruit pie with frozen mangoes and mixed berries for my husband's birthday. He was very pleased.

By far the best crust I have ever made. It is very flaky. I used the food processor which is something  I haven't done before. I will be using this recipe from now on.

I am a great baker but my pie crusts are terrible so I have been trying new recipes with unpalatable results. I watched Chef John's how to video and made this recipe and got fabulous, tasty results on the first try. It has wonderful buttery taste with the flaky, crispy texture of a good shorthbread cookie. THANK YOU CHEF JOHN!!!!

A 10 star recipe! I have made all butter crusts before and they all turned out tough. This crust is the flakiest I've ever made. Not to mention it's so easy, not only making it in the processor, but also rolling it out.

Very easy to make! Love the use of the food processor. I used the crusts for our Turkey Pot Pie tonight and received rave reviews. Perfect for a savory dish. I'll be using this come holiday season for pies as well.

I used this for my family's Thanksgiving pumpkin pie and we did not find it to have the flaky crust or wonderful flavor that others reported.  I do not have a food processor, using instead a pastry cutter. I think I am going back to lard.

This recipe deserves a 4 and a half stars really. I used the crust to make chef john's quiche recipe. I loved the flavour!! It was buttery, flaky and so delish! The only problem was the bottom was a little soggy, but I'm sure I could fix that next time by pre-baking it some more. For first time crust maker, this recipe was EASY!!!! A definite keeper. Good work chef john, once again!

I have been married for thirty years and have never been successful in making the perfect pie crust in all those years. I have tried using shortening, oil and butter but they were just never right. The cold ingredients, vinegar and butter in this recipe are perfect and I think the food processor is the key. I will pass this recipe on to my friends and family. Thanks to Chef John I will make this forever! It was perfect for the Chicken Pot Pie that I made last night! Brush with a little half and half and it looks golden brown and delicious!

Ridiculously easy and stunningly delicious. Followed the directions exactly and the results were phenomenal! Made two batches - used three for pies and then used the last crust on a turkey pot pie made with Thanksgiving leftovers. I will never use a store-bought pie crust again!

I wanted to try a different pie crust recipe for my Thanksgiving pies and this was a great recipe. The crust was so flaky and tasty. I will use this recipe again.

I've been trying various butter pie crust recipes for many years & always produced crusts no better than the store bought kind until now.  I'm so happy for this recipe!!!  Your technique is the best!

I just used this pie crust with Mrs. Sigg's Pumpkin pie on this site and it came out wonderful!  I have never been very good at making pie crust, and I am an avid baker, but this recipe makes me look like a pro!  Thanks Chef John!

I have made many pies, actually pride myself on making a good crust, but never had a food processor.  Just bought one and my husband tried this recipe and it was incredible, quick, and easy.... Will use again and again.  Thank you!

I wonder if the flour and/or butter used in the USA are very different from what we use here (Portugal), because it's the second time I try this kind of crust and I've confirmed that adding more than 1 tablespoon of water is too much (I actually made the mistake this time of adding a second one and the dough became all sticky and not workable at all, had to add an absurd amount of flour to fix it). That said, it turned out pretty good.

Just like Grandma used to make hers.  I will use 3/4 cup of butter next time.  The crust was flaky but also rather greasy.

I have been a professional cook for 16+ years.  I just used this recipe, it's flaky, delicious, and easy to work with.  This stuff rolls out easier than any pie crust I have worked with.  This stuff will be appearing at my place of employment soon.  Thanks for sharing it Chef!

Be sure to use a standard sized food processor, I used a smaller size and faced some difficulty, otherwise it came out wonderful!

This was my first attempt at making a homemade pie crust.  To my amazement, it turned out great and tasted very good!  I did have to add more ice water than the recipe called for.  Not sure why and don't really know how many additional tablespoons I added.  I just kept adding until the dough was workable enough to form into a ball.

This works perfectly. I made two pies for the first time for thanksgiving. I used this recipe for the crust and it worked amazingly well. It tasted like a professional crust. It works very well even if you dont have a processor.

Best pie crust I ever made. For me the secret was to not overwork the dough. No hydrogenated fats made it even better.
