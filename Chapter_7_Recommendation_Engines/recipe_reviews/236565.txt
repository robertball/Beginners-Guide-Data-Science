I was actually searching for a recipe to use up an abundance of leftover baked sweet potatoes. I started cooking it a little backwards because i didn't have all of the ingredients and I needed something quick and healthy.  Started with a can of diced tomatoes and added the spices listed.  I used onion powder and a roasted garlic paste I had previously made and keep frozen.   Added 2 very large baked sweets and a drained can of chick peas.  The spices made the dish!   Great flavor; hot but not overly so.  I would have loved to try it over rice or have it with chicken but i had a bowl of it topped with a slightly sweetened plain Greek yogurt.  This is a very versatile recipe I will come back to often!  Fantastic!  Thank you!

I have made this recipe twice now, with and without the tomatoes. This is a very good side dish with Curry Stand Chicken Masala or just over rice on its own. Very easy. My guest loved it. Last night a added 1 seeded and chopped jalepeno pepper to kick it up. The pepper also added some color.

Really good. I read people’s notes of doubling the spices so I increased it by 1.5x and I would agree with the doubling. It was missing something. Used butter instead of ghee because that’s what I had didn’t seem to make a difference. Added peas instead of sweet potato because my guest didn’t like sweet potato and I’m obsessed with peas. Everyone at the table added a lot of salt. But all of that being said I will keep making this!

I made some changes and it came out absolutely delicious ! I will make this dish over and over again. Subbed coconut oil for the vegetable oil, added a little extra ginger, doubled the spices, added 1 cup of crushed tomatoes to the onion garlic ginger spice mixture before adding the water, also added half a can of diced green chilies, used only 1 sweet potato and 3 cans of chick peas. The consistency and flavor is to die for. The coconut oil adds a certain richness.... WOW!!! Try it!

Fantastic! I followed this recipe exactly and it came out to a PERFECT consistency with plenty of flavors! I highly recommend this recipe paired with Tandoori Chicken II and a side of Indian Style Basmati Rice (both on the website). Thanks OP, this dish was welcomed very well by the family!

Followed recipe as written.  Really enjoyed it.  May try it again with chicken (of course it will no longer be vegan, but that's ok).

With a bit of fine tuning this recipe is fabulous. First double the spices and garlic. Substitute vegetable stock for the cup of water for more flavor. Not a fan of sweet potatoes so substituted 3 medium red potatoes, peeled and diced. Cooking: do not cook the garlic first until brown, that makes garlic bitter. Cook the onions first until glazed 10-12 mins, then add the crushed garlic and ginger and cook 2-3 mins. When you add the spices, do not add water if too dry, add olive oil, you do not want to burn the spices. Then add the chick peas and stock. Chick peas are quite hard out of the can, so simmer the chick peas for 10-15 mins until getting soft, then add the potatoes and simmer until cooked. Add some cilantro and a squeeze of lime. After you have added the tomatoes and they have cooked, let the pot cool and sit for a couple of hours. Give the curry time to soak into the potatoes. Then just re-heat to serve. This recipe is just delicious. Serve with basmati rice and naan.

I added some chopped jalapeños  plus threw in some baby spinach leaves along with the tomatoes. Hubby and I both loved it. Will make again.

I concur that the dish was a little mild but I didn't mind because I was making it for my children to eat.    I think it could have simmered longer and allowed spices to infuse a little more...I ate leftovers the next day and it was much more flavorful.  I cooked the sweet potatoes in the microwave to save time, used a can of tomatoes and added half a can of coconut milk near the end.

I liked the ease of this recipe.  I had to cover the pan to let the potatoes steam a bit until they were fork tender.  Served on basmati.

I used fresh sweet potatoes that I baked beforehand and I also cooked dried chickpeas in the slowcooker. This spice mix was amazing, on them!

I used coconut oil as a substitute for ghee and made it for vegan friends. Also I was out of garam masala and used a specialty company's West African inspired curry and added additional cinnamon. I was fairly loose with the proportions and did use more spice than called for. It turned out better than expected, I think I'd add some raisins or prunes the next time it seemed like it would blend nicely.

This is a favorite in our home!  We like lots of flavor so I triple the spices, double the garlic and ginger.  We serve over basmati rice and garnish with cilantro and a squeeze of lime.  Delicious and healthy!

Recipe was good.... The spice was a little week. I adjusted to double the amount. I think n the tempering of spices I roast the dry spice in a separate dry pan to maximize the essential oils within the spices. All and all I would make this again with the small changes

This is a  versatile dish that you can do anything with. I doubled the recipe & prepared everything in one pot. I began with a flavor base, sautéing the onions, garlic, ginger and seasonings.   I added cinnamon and mace (1/4 teaspoon of each) to the the mix as well. Additionally, I added a minced jalapeño, carrots, mini bell peppers and 2 cups of spinach and kale. I used vegetable broth instead of water. It was amazing and tastes even better the next day. 

Enjoy!!

Excellent! Everyone loved it. I only used one sweet potato -- it was quite large, and after dicing  up one, I thought I had enough. I didn't have cilantro, so I left it out. I also used regular butter instead of ghee, and totally forgot about adding the other oil. I will definitely make again.

It was ok after the spices were doubled, but I am probably not going to make it again.

Delicious! Changed it a bit, omitted the tomatoes and instead added a mixture of evaporated milk and cream cheese at the end of cooking as well as some ground cayenne.  Used Garam Masala, Vindaloo Curry, and Ras El Hanout. So good!

So disappointing!  This sounded so tasty and it was completely void of flavor.  I added the chili powder and basically it was just flavorless, but hot.  I really wanted this to be good, but it wasn't.

Followed the recipe except only one large sweet potato and a cup of peas.  Excellent and very healthy.  I only used  1/2 Tbsp. Oil and no butter. Didn't miss the extra fat at all. Flavorful...a keeper.
