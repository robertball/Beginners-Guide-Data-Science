I normally will make recipes as instructed but in this instance I am not a fan of velveeta cheese so I swapped that out for regular cheddar cheese.

This recipe was delicious. The only reason I gave it a 4 rather than a 5 is because I added about 1/2 cup milk before I baked it because it seemed too thick. Other than that, the taste was delightful!

I accidentally left out 1 can of cream of celery. I used 16 oz of noodles. I had no parm, used cheddar instead. I have to say, it was a sooo salty. I will use no salt added peas and omit the salt. Under all that salt, it was pretty good!

I didn't make any changes, next  time I make it I will cut the 
recipe in half. It makes  a lot. Excellent.

I did add milk because I remember we used to back in the olden days lol it’s great , I forgot to get peas at the store so no veggies , I missed them tho , they really add to it . We used to crunch up potato chips on top but it was so salty so I tried your Parm idea Perfect

I love making this dish! It is easy and every time i change something. This time I used cheddar cheese instead. I also added mixed vegetables and a can of cream of chicken along with the cream of mushroom. I’m disabled but I love to cook. This is a very easy to make

I agree with the other critique, this was delish but way too dry! I meant to add the milk but totally forgot and definitely wished I had. The flavor is good. Family loves it. Super simple!!! Will definitely make again WITH milk
