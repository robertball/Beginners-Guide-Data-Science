This has become the family favorite apple pie. The three layers (apple bottom, doughy-cakey middle and granola sugar top) makes this irresistable!!

I wasn't sure what to think of this because I usually don't bake using pre-made ingredients, also the center of this never really looked set while baking. I baked it for almost twice the time and it still looked like it might be underdone in the center. It was so delicious though!
