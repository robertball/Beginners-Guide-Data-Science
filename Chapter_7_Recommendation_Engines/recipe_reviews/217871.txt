Super moist and very delicious. This cake was a hit at our family's Easter dinner. The only thing that I would do different in the future is to chop the rhubarb significantly smaller, maybe even put it through the food processor. Other than that this cake is a real winner.

I make a lot rhubarb desserts in the Summer, but for some reason this dessert just didn't wow us!  Hubby is the only one eating the remainder of the cake.

Great!  Will make it again.  Just had to add about a cup of raspberries as I ran out of rhubarbâ€”??

There is no amount of salt in the recipe?
