This rub was really good.  I decided to try it because it wasn't your run of the mill spice.  It doesn't overwhelm the meat or give it a very strong flavor so I ended up sprinkling the rub over the meat after cooking.  
I sprinkled this on a whole chicken and roasted it.  Even tho the skin was very flavorful, the meat didn't get a lot of the flavor.  Sprinkling the rub over the meat after cooking definitly brought it out tho!  
Think this would be exceptionally good over pork or chicken and grilled.  
FYI. I didn't use 1/2 cup of orange mix.. I only used 2 packs of the instant drink mix and it was Sugar Free.  Turned out very well!

I used this recipe for something we call "poor man's scallops" due to the shape.  First, pound out chicken and cut into strips.  Second, apply rub to chicken.  Third, lay bacon on top and roll up and place on a skewer and bbq till done.  All my guests loved it!!

I was a little disappointed with this one.  I thought the flavor combo just came out odd.

This is a great recipe for kids. Just leave out the "hot". My son who is very picky loves this on pork tenderloin.

Loved it.  I put this on chicken breast.  The sweetness of it is amazing.

I used this on scallops and I think it would be good on chicken. Thanks so much for sharing.
