I added a cup of milk chocolate chips to the batter and reduced the chips on top by half.  It was easy, quick to prepare, and my family loves it.  I'll be taking it to church functions!

The cake turned out really moist.  I only used half a cup of chocolate chips on top.  Hubby took the rest to work, they were all happy to find it doesn't taste as rich as it looks, which is a good thing.  It had just the right amount of sweetness and peanuty taste for us.

One word YUM !!!! Quick easy, this cake is moist, brought it down to my brothers and not only did he have 1 piece not 2 BUT 3. This one is a hit !!!. The only thing I'd do different is less chocolate chips.

My family loves this cake... it's a great one to take to potlucks, etc as it isn't too rich and has a nice peanut butter flavor.  My mom made this exact recipe when we were growing up and I was very happy to find it on here.

I used this recipe for cupcakes and they turned out great! The only change I made was using butter instead of margarine and used splenda instead of sugar and they came out very moist with just the right amount of peanut butter flavor. I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone who loves peanut butter.

I loved the taste of this cake. I cut the recipe in half to make a smaller cake and it turned out great! The peanut butter and chocolate flavors complimented each other nicely. Definitely will make this again.

Very good.  Made this for a family reunion over the weekend, and it went over very well.  My personal feeling is that it could use more peanut butter flavor in the cake part itself, but I don't know how you would do that without altering the texture.  Over all really good!

My family loved the cake.  It was my Father's Day gift.  Instead of chocolate chips I used diced Reeces cups.  Also to ensure it was a moist cake I split the amount of butter into half and used the other half as oil.

INSANELY GOOD. I mean so good I wish I'd not made it! Devoured more than my share. Made as a 2-layer cake with peanut butter frosting. My husband's new favorite cake.

This cake turned out very good and I substitued half the sugar with" Stevia". Its so good I don't think anyone would ever know. I am very pleased and will make this again. It was easy to make and loved the topping.

I really, really wanted to like this cake, but it was very dry and did not have as much peanut butter flavor as I had hoped for. Great concept, though. Thanks!

Delicious! My son requested a peanut butter cake for his Birthday. I found this and made it. He loved it. I added peanut butter morsels and 1/2 cup of flaxseed for omega's. All the kids loved it.

I'll let you know about the stars once I get this cake out of the oven.  It's been in there for almost an hour now.  I'm an experienced baker, and the only changes I made to this recipe were to use 3 duck eggs instead, and a Bundt pan.  Still hasn't set up, so I'm a little unsure about it.  Smells wonderful though!

I made this because of the ingredients I had left over in my cupboard.  I have to agree with the other reviewers that it was bland.  It wasn't bad and it did get eaten, but I doubt I will make it again.

The lower reviews were about lack of flavor so I used fresh ground PB  and it was amazing!  Very sweet though, I will look for a way to reduce the 2 cups of sugar.

Really moist.  The peanut butter flavor really stands out.  I iced my cake the chocolate fudge home made frosting. Also I forgot to add the chocolate chips to the cake mix but it was great without it.   It was delicious.

This was a good cake. I wanted something besides chocolate, which I do love, and this was it. I was kind of afraid it would be gooey, bit it was not. I think my family will really enjoy this cake.. I did chop some peanuts and added to the cake and topping.  Yummy. Thank you

My husband - who is gluten free- loved this.  I used gluten free flour - a combination of brown rice flour and potato starch.  I baked it in a 9x13 pan. It came out very good, a little crumbly, but good.  I think next time I might skip adding the crumble topping  and use vanilla or chocolate frosting instead.

Very good, I used sunflower oil instead of butter, and substituted one cup of all purpose flower for whole wheat flour. It turned out super moist and delicious, and was very easy to make .

Changes I made: Used whole wheat flower; Reduced sugar to 1.5 cups; Used butter instead of margarine; Skipped chocolate chips since I knew I'd glaze it with chocolate. Since I reduced the sugar I should have reduced wet ingredients a little. The cake was very moist but delicious. 

I made 50% more and filled one regular loaf pan and 3 mini loaf pans. I cut the top off to make it flat, turned them upside down, and built a train engine with the big one and one small one, then turned the remaining 2 into a tender & freight car. I used melted chocolate chips with a little dollop of vegetable oil in it (to make it shiny) as the glaze & glue. Added cookies as the wheels and gum drops / candy coated sunflower seeds / M&M type candies as lights and load. I only used organic candies with no artificial colors/flavors. Letter cookies from Trader Joe's were handy for a letter & number. 
None of those things mattered when it came to flavor of course. Well, to the 3-yr-old they probably did!

I had a great deal of trouble with this recipe.  This cake was a flop for me. Possibly I did something wrong. But it was far from edible.
