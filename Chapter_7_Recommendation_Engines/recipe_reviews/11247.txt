To the previous rating.....the amount of cornstarch in the recipe IS CORRECT.  I am originally from Guam and the recipe is called Roskette.  It's a delicate cookie and with the amount of cornstarch, it's melt in your mouth good!!

This is a waste of eggs butter and the fuel it took to make these. they don't melt in your mouth and theres no way they twist into a figure eight. Very BAD.

Turned out well, I made mine in the shape of hearts cause the figures eights kept breaking on me.  Also REALLY important...I think the 4 1/2 cups of cornstarch seemed like it might be incorrect, so I only put approx 4 tbs and they turned out fine, just something to consider, maybe I am wrong.
