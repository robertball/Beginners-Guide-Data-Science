We made it slightly different but it was great!  I didn't have quinoa, I imagine that would give it a nuttier flavor.  Since we used rice I added 2 tbsp of peanut butter and chopped nuts on top.  I also added some tumeric because I am trying to work more into my diet.  Great recipe,  thanks for sharing!
