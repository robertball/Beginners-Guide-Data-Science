yumyum.. was going to make the plain salted ones this weekend but then saw this new recipe. I adore Sriracha so I had to make this, Really delicious. I wish I had more kale to make more.  Only change for me was a little more salt at the end.. I'm a salt fresk

Incredible chips! I probably quadrupled the sriracha because I love the heat. Kale is the perfect medium for the sriracha-lime flavour! It's a great flavour combination

Oh . .  my husband is going to LOVE these with an ice cold beer! I baked these at 275 degrees with my oven set on convection bake. Set the timer for 15 minutes, removed them from the oven and gave them a stir, then back in the over for another 10 minutes. They turned out perfect! Love the unique flavor in these.

Adjusted cooking to 350 degrees for 10-12 minutes. Much faster turnaround when baking multiple batches. Also added  1/2 tsp. Garlic salt per batch. Fantastic balance with the kale flavor.

Will definitely make these again, I just won't eat the whole batch! I did sprinkle with some onion & garlic powder. I cooked these on a pizza pan with holes & cooked very crisp without having to turn them.

Fantastic!  Satisfies the junk salt cravings and super easy to make!  I made the dressing up in a big glass bowl and dumped the kale in there (I did cheat and use the pre-washed pre cut bag stuff) to mix.  I was out of Siracha but the Chili Lime Cholula worked great!!  I finished with pink  fine ground Himalayan Sea Salt (Costco). I ate almost 1 of the pans myself, while it was still warm!  If you put your kale in the dressing bowl, you get more even coverage of all the bits, than if you drizzle it over and toss it. The downside to cheating and using the bag stuff, more rib than you might do yourself, but still tastes great!

This is a great spin on kale chips. It enhances the flavor and gives them zing. I added a little sea salt.

Not bad... But 1) twice 15 minutes is way to long. And 2) I added more sriracha and salt but lesser lemon

Loved it and will definitely make it again!  I used lemon because that is all I had and it turned out delicious.  Definitely a good twist to the kale chip!

I've made two batches of these a week since discovering the recipe. I realized today as I finished the last chip in the bag that this is by far my favorite afternoon snack at work. They are so addicting that I have to portion them out or I'd eat the entire batch in one setting. Each chip is a little different than the one before it and that just adds to the beauty of them for me. Excellent recipe and 5 stars all the way!

Delicious!  Be sure to spread the olive oil/Sriracha mixture evenly or you may get some extra salty/spicy bites.

These are really good.  I've had other kale chips that didn't provide enough flavor and the bitterness of the kale didn't mix well with the other flavors.  These were all sriracha.

The 2nd time I made these I broke off the stem, but didn't remove the part of the stem that veins into the leaf.  I used my hands to spread the Sriracha mix over the leaves and then put them in the dehydrator.  When they were good and crispy, I took them out and ate them as is.  It worked well and it saved me from having to cut them into smaller pieces and individually spread them out on the trays.

These are great!  We made kale and collard green chips and they turned out great.  For the collards we baked them on a cooking rack since they were flat.

very nice, but a little salty, and a little warm for grandkids... makes my imagination wander, though, and can't help thinking how SCAMPI kale or GARLIC-PARMESAN kale chips, etc would taste...!

Had to cut down on the oven time a bit, but delicious and easy! Perfect way to elevate kale chips without extra work.

This is a wonderful base recipe. You can add your own spices or use less sriracha based on your own preferences.  I like spicy, so I add some cayenne, some black pepper, a pinch of sea salt, and some garlic powder.  The cooking time seems off - I baked for 10 minutes, stirred them around, then baked 10 minutes more and they were nice and crispy. I could eat a whole head of kale in one sitting, when it's prepared like this!

Much better then I expected; attempting this I was quite skeptical. Addictive, and very tasty will make again. ;)

We have tried a lot of kale chip recipes and this is our favorite. Perfect amount of spice for this snack.

These were good and everyone I shared them with loved them. The only change I did was using 1 tablespoon of lime juice. I like the little extra tanginess. 
I wll be making these again but i think I will keep them for myself this time.

YUM! I am always a little nervous whenever a recipe calls for Sriracha, so I didn't use a full tablespoon (I may even reduce it a bit more the next time I make this...1/2 T??). They turned out delicious! So glad I have a garden full of kale so I can make this again.

Delicious!  I didn't have lime juice and just added a little extra siracha sauce and it was great!  My kids and husband liked it too.

It's okay. Kale's not my favorite, but with all the stuff on it this is edible. I like the premixed kale salad's you can buy now. Probably stick with those for my vitamins!

Terrific!  I made them just as directed, though with a pinch more salt. Mine were done in  about 15 minutes. With kale growing like hot cakes in the garden, I'll make these again and again! Thanks for a great recipe!

I didn't have any sriracha sauce so I substituted Sambal Oelek (ground fresh chili paste). It came out delicious!

I had wanted to make another recipe from this site which only called for one cup of kale, and decided to use the rest of the huge bunch I had bought for this recipe.  Definitely a great alternative to "regular" kale chips.  Will be making again, for sure.

This was my first attempt at kale chips.  Love Sriracha, so decided on this recipe.  Followed the directions to a T.  They were delicious!  My hubby said they "almost" made him forget about his favorite Jalapeno Kettle Chip :) Thanks for the great recipe.  Will definitely be making again!
