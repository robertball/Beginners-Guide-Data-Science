Loved this....although I made some changes....I sauteed the onion, 2 cloves of minced garlic, and some baby carrots in some evoo. Then I added 2 bunches of broccoli and a large head of cauliflower washed and cut into small pieces, added pepper, crushed thyme and a sprinkle of cayenne(didn't have any curry). I let that cook for about 5-7 minutes, then added the chicken broth(low sodium) and added an extra cup of water with a chicken boullion packet. Let that cook until the veggies were tender and then I whipped it through my food processor making sure I left some chunks for texture. Added that back to the pot, mixed 1% milk with the flour, let that thicken, adjusted the seasonings, and added 1 pk of shredded cheddar and the kernels of 1 leftover corn on the cob shaved off. (It was like I cleaned out the fridge!) What a fabulous soup!!! Nice and thick and rich with so many veggies.....even my 1 year old loved it....will make again and keep in my rotation for the fall/winter!!

I thought this recipe was excellent. My entire family enjoyed it. Like everyone else, I made a few changes to it though.

I initially sauteed the vegetables in oil to soften them. Once tender, I added my "broth."

I added a total of 8 cups of "broth" - well, water, and added two chicken and one vegetable bouillon cubes. That made  this soup go a lot further, and still retained the taste. 

I used two bunches of broccoli, and half a head of cauliflower. I also shredded in two carrots, and added 4 cloves of garlic, minced.

I then used a hand blender in the pot to smooth out the soup. Next time I may leave some chunks to add a little more texture.

Overall, I was very pleased with this soup, and will definitely make it again.

This was fantastic soup. I made it even easier by using frozen broccoli and cauliflower. The curry was a nice touch. I'll definitely put this on a regular rotation! Thanks!

Really good flavor.  I altered slighty since we are vegetarian, used vegetable broth and vegetable bouillon.  Also added some minced garlic and chopped red pepper.  Used 1/2 cup of heavy cream and 1/2 cup milk. Turned out so good!! Thanks

I have made this soup several times now.  The first time I made it as is and the kids loved the cheesyness of it...but hubby and I felt it could have used some more flavor.  Since that first time I have been sauteing the onions with some garlic and diced up carrots and celery.  I add 2 tsp curry powder and a tsp of garam masala to the mixture and stir in together.  Then add the broth and broccoli and cauliflower.  I also like to blend my soup with the immersion blender...so easy!  Once blended, I find that the soup is thick enough and does not need flour to thicken it.  I have used milk, cream, and evaporated milk all with great success. For a nice change I like to use coconut milk...it is really yummy.  I also prefer to put the cheese on the table and let everyone serve their own amount to suit their own tastes.  Overall this recipe is good as is, but for our own personal tastes I would like to add more to it!  Thank you for sharing a recipe that can be tweaked to suit everyone's tastes!!

This was an interesting one.  I love broccoli cheese soups, and I love curry, but I guess I just don't love them together.  I thought it was a wierd combo.  It also didn't get very creamy, although I let it cook awhile, hoping it would thicken.  Then I pureed some of, but it just gave it a wierd flourescent green color.

My husband, who does not like soup, loved this soup!!  I have made twice now in the past couple of weeks as I had an abundance of cauliflower.  The first time according to directions, the second as a vegetarian alternative (no chicken broth or bouillon)  This is delicious - tweaked a bit due to other reviews, specifically blending everything to get a thicker texture of soup.  Will pass along to others and make again and again!  Thank you!

Pretty darn good, I like the combine of the cauliflower/broccoli. I used fat free half and half instead of milk. Came out great. This will be a regular :)

This was good. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers by softening the onions in some butter and I also added chopped carrots. I  coursley chopped the vegetables.  I took out most of the mixture (leaving some chunks) and blended it and then put it all back in the pot.  I used half/half unstead of milk.  Creamy and good.

Very good soup that was enjoyed by all.  Next time I will chop the vegitables in a food processor. Just think the soup will become more smooth and flavorful. Definitely increase the amount of curry for more flavor...thanks for the recipe.

This is a delicious soup! I followed the directions as written but I added extra curry powder and some garam masala spice. I also pureed the soup with a hand blender because I prefer a smooth consistency. My boyfriend took some for lunch the next day and his co-workers were asking for the recipe!

Loved this ... roasted my veggies in the oven with onions and a head of garlic, all drizzled with olive oil.  Pureed with the broth and apple juice, which complements the curry so well.  Left out the flour and milk mixture, as the pureed soup needed no more thickening.  A keeper!

This was the perfect dinner to make on a very cold day! I used vegetable broth instead of chicken and didn't use any boullion. I sauteed the vegetables with a little oil until tender, then put them in a blender with a some of the broth and blended until smooth and creamy. I just poured the blended veggies back into the pan and added the rest of the broth and seasonings then followed the recipe as is. If you are going to end up blending this soup don't worry about chopping the vegetables really fine. Me and my husband really liked this soup we topped off each bowl with more cheese to make it extra good. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a good recipe to use up steamed cauliflower and broccoli leftovers.   I sauteed the onion in a little butter before adding the chicken stock, cauliflower and broccoli. Since everything only then needed to be heated, the recipe took about 20 minutes start to finish.

I loved how quickly this soup came together!  I was lazy and used a 16 oz bag of frozen cauliflower and a 13 oz bag of frozen broccoli instead of fresh.  I also added a dash of chopped garlic and skipped the boullion.  I pureed it using my immersion blender, leaving some larger chunks, and I didn't think it needed the thickener but I added it anyway.  Great without cheese, but I'll try it topped with a handful tonight.  I'm sure it can only make it better.

I made this exactly as written ... I didn't care for it.  So salty I couldn't eat it!! If I ever attempted this again, I would NOT add the bouillon granules. I didn't even add the salt to taste because it was already far too salty.

very good  I  sauteed onions and I added about a cup of extra water when I added the chicken broth.  I also used a hand blender to puree the mixture alittle  before adding the milk and flour.

I really don't like it when people alter a recipe then review it but here we go anyway.  When I found this recipe I was looking for a low-cal soup to use up a head of cauliflower.  I had to alter this to make it low-fat but even with all the changes I made it was totally awesome.   First of all I used fat-free chicken broth, then I cut the flour in half  and used skim milk  Finally I used the weight watchers cheese wedges in place of the high fat cheese.  The results were amazing.  I can only imagine how good the high-fat version would taste.

This was a hit at our dinner party.  I would add more spice as the curry was very subtle and I like a little more flavor.  I also ran some of the soup through the blender in order to make it less chunky.

Delicious soup and easy to make! I wanted a slightly stronger curry flavour so I added another 1/2 teaspoon of curry powder and also added 2 cloves of garlic, but otherwise made no changes. I highly recommend it!

I loved this soup... I am eating it right now and can't get enough actually!  I added a few things like a couple of chopped carrots, a chopped celery stalk and a chopped cooked chicken breast.  I also increased the curry powder to 2 tbsp and added 1 tsp red curry paste.  I added more broth as required... this tastes amazing and is so adaptable I will definitely make it again and again.

Great tasting soup.  I don't have a food processor so the chunks of broccoli and cauliflower were a bit big so I wound up making a puree once they were soft.  I also wanted to put in more broth but accidentally put in a can of cream of chicken, which actually gave it a creamier consistency so I didn't put flour in the milk.  Before I pureed it, my husband was suspicious but he really liked it.  I also softened the onions in a little bit of butter and added some garlic.  A great recipe for getting rid of frozen veggies.

I ended up with a great soup after a few tweaks. I wasn't crazy about the milk/flour slurry being added at the end (hate raw flour taste), so I made a bechamel with butter, the flour, the milk, and the cheese. Frankly, I think this would be better as a cream  soup - maybe with some plain yogurt to emphasize the curry -  and no cheese at all, but it was also good this way. MrB loved it - and it went really nicely with Tomato Bacon Grilled Cheese sandwiches from this site. Thanks for the idea and the recipe! :)

I added 2 carrots which I sautéed with onions  in 1/4 cup of butter before adding the cauliflower and brocoli. I blended everything together at the end and didn’t need the flour cause it was thick already. Served it with bacon on top!

I made this today and the only difference was, I added garlic and 1 extra cup of stock. My husband and son loved. This is a keeper.

Started off making it almost per recipe, then I remembered the reviews that mentioned the garlic and I remembered that is why I bought it.   Tasted it before and it tasted good, just almost a watered down after taste, after the garlic, which I only used 1 clove, it tasted overwhelmingly like garlic, and i like garlic, but i do not think a dish with curry should have such a strong garlic taste.  so i added more salt , pepper, curry seasoning, it was getting better , i decided since i love cheese to add just a bit more, AH do not do that.  just do the recommended amount.  Curry and overly cheesy do not mix well.  :) So I had to start doctoring it up... more curry, more salt and pepper then i realized I didn't add the chicken  bouillon granules, so i added two cubes, and that took care of that watery tasting after taste.   added still a lil more curry and pepper, until it got to the point where i felt tasted acceptable and still not overwhelmingly all curry taste.  We will see what my guests think tomorrow!

I've only just finished making this soup and must say, if everyone enjoys this at dinner as much as I have pre-tasting it, it's going to be a big hit and live up to my good review. 
I followed the recipe as written with no changes. I did use an immersion blender to smooth the texture only a bit but this is a personal preference.
Thanks for sharing!
Post dinner follow-up: Everyone loved it. My son, who ate later, sought me out to say how much he enjoyed this soup. 
So thanks again Sheila. It's a winner!

Do not be fooled by the easiness of this soup. It's AMAZING!! I wish I doubled the recipe. I did not blend the soup as others suggested.  I kept the veggies whole. They were very soft.  I added about 1/2 C half and half instead of the milk and used cornstarch instead of the flour.   This one will be made again. YUMMMMO!!

Oh my goodness, yum!  On another reviewer's recommendation I sauteed the onion in olive oil first, and I also added some carrots to the mix.  My toddler is allergic to dairy so I removed some of the soup for him before adding the milk and cheese, and he went crazy over it.  He pretty much ignored his bread, just stuffed himself with veggie soup.  Win!

Wow, I really do not like Cauliflower and yet my wife brings home another head... Didn't have all of the ingredients so I sub'd dried onion flakes for onion and half and half for milk. Used my own chicken broth and I pureed it. It was fabulous.

Wonderfully delicious soup!  My only change was that I substituted vegetable broth for the chicken broth and I left out the chicken boulillon granules. I've made this numerous times...a keeper for sure!

I am usually one of curry's biggest fans, but I do not think it worked in this dish.  It was way too overpowering - wondering if just a smidge would have been better.

This was a perfect recipe for me since I had leftover Caulifower and Broccoli in the freezer !  Always enjoy making Broccoli soup, but this was great with the cauliflower. 
I used less curry as I didn't want to offend anyone who didn't like the taste and also just sprinkled cheddar cheese on top - made it less rich and caloric !
Will do this one again - thanks for the recipe

Amazing soup!!! Even the kids devoured it!!! I agree that the best side is some crusty baguette bread sliced at an angle drizzle with some olive oil and broil for a few minutes until just browned! Rave reviews~everyone i've ever made it for loves it & begs for the recipe!

I made this today and I think it is fabulous! I did alter it a tiny bit, mostly quantity as my cauliflower was huge! My husband is hunting all day and will be a great warmer upper for him when he get's home. I highly recommend this recipe!

Yum! I used Mascarpone cheese instead of cheddar just for a change. Made it so creamy! I followed the changes by SLJ6 (Aug. 19 '07). Didn't use curry-maybe next time.  Very good!

This soup was phenomonal!  We loved it, and I ate the leftovers eagerly for the next two days.  I only boiled the cauliflower in the broth and steamed the broccoli separately to avoid the broth turning green (which another reviewer complained about) then added it after pureeing some of the broth/cauliflower mixture.  I also steamed some diced carrots with the broccoli, and I used quite a bit more curry since I really love the taste- about 4 tsp.  This was a wonderful soup, thank you!

Delicious!  It would be 5 stars except I had to add an additional cup of milk and an additional cup of water to get a soup texture (as opposed to a stew texture).    I used low sodium, low fat chicken broth, skim milk, reduced fat cheese.  I used a stick blender to make a creamy soup (as opposed to a chunky soup).

Absolutely loved it soup. I always add more veggies.  Sometimes I use half the amount of cheese.  Sometimes I make it with half parmesan and half chedder.  Always a hit!  My 15 year old son wants me to make it (again) for guests coming to dinner.

I expected to like this or I wouldn't have made it, but it really exceeded my expectations.  I had quite a bit of leftover, cooked cauliflower and some uncooked broccoli rabi the I needed to cook.  I started by sauting my onions and brocoli rabi in 1 tbs of butter, when the BR was wilted I transferred the vegetables to a pot of homemade chicken stock along with the cauliflower.  In the pan I used to cook the onions, I made a roux and added the curry powder and when ready added enough half and half to make a slightly thick sauce, which I then added to the soup.  I omitted the bouillon and added freshly ground black pepper.  Delicious!

I made a few modifications to the soup. As other reviewers suggested, I cooked the veggies in garlic and oil before adding the chicken broth. I stuck to sodium free broth, and then added salt to taste at the end. I probably more than doubled the curry powder, and also put in some garam masala. I would have used a food processor on half of the soup, but I don't own one. I think this would have given it a really nice consistency. Otherwise, I great base soup - I'll definitely make it again.   I added a little extra curry powder to up the spice, and put in some

I use this recipe as a base and I think it's delicious.  I boil my vegetables in the broth until soft and then I strain them out, puree them and then add them back to the stock.  Just my preference in texture.  Lovely.

Well, I did this. I sauteed the onion, garlic, broccoli and cauliflower...added the quart of chix broth and let that cook for 15 min. Then I added an entire 15 ounce jar of Tostitos brand Con Queso. Blended it with the immersion blender until smooth. The kids are wolfing it down and served it with chips. Easy lunch!

Didn't think it was great.  Too much cauliflower, and the base or soup part didn't seem hardy enough to support all the vegetables.  Would make thicker and add a meat like shredded chicken.  My kids not too crazy about it either.  Won't make again.

I can't get enough of this soup...quick, easy, and SO GOOD!  Make sure to finely chop the veggies, so it comes out thick.  And don't omit the curry, it is the key ingredient.  Also, good with vegetable broth and bouillon.  Thank you, Tim Perry!

This is REALLY good...I altered it a bit, I added leek and when all the veggies were cooked I whizzed the soup with the hand held mixer until it was smooth and then put the milk and cheese in.  YUM.  We're having it with the roasted garlic cauliflower for dinner and it all smells divine (I've been sneaking bites of soup, too good to wait) :)

Very good. It reminds me of broccoli cheese soup but with a little kick.  I wanted it a little creamier so to get the same consistency as broccoli cheese soup, I added 1/2 cup of flour instead of 1/4 cup.  I also grated a little extra cheese on top because I'm a cheese fanatic and it makes the presentation prettier.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.

My hubby & I loved this!  I didn’t have curry so I put approximately 1 TBSP cayenne.   I also added a handful of cilantro which made it, IMO.  SO GOOD!!  The cheese is the only unhealthy ingredient.

This was really good! I didn't use the bouillon cubes (because I didn't have or thought it was needed) and I added some carrots because i had some. I used an immersion blender to blend coarsely but still left some pieces of the veg. I used vegetarian broth (unsalted) and salted/peppered to taste. This was so tasty. I will definitely make again.

Very good soup! I did add a little extra curry powder for my tastes. I saw that some suggested pureeing for a thicker soup, which I was going to do with half. I ended up really liking the texture of the soup as it was....not too thin or too thick, so I didn't have to take out the blender! For the cheese, I had 7 slices of Velveeta that I wanted to use up, so I used those. It worked well as I halved the recipe. Thanks for sharing  the recipe from your boss, Sheila! I enjoyed it and will make again!

I made this soup and made the following changes to make it vegan - sub veg broth for chicken broth, sub unsweetened almond milk for milk, and used 1/2 cup nutritional yeast in place of cheese. It’s very good and even better the 2nd day. Thanks for the recipe!!

I find everyone's comments so helpful, so I took good advice and then . . . I added frozen carrot strings (they have them), white/yellow corn kernels, and cubed chicken.  I used a box of chicken broth, added the chicken and brought it to a boil. Then set it to simmer. I chopped fresh cauliflower (only used a half head)  and broccoili (two smaller heads) and put them aside. In a large frying pan,  I sauteed in olive oil, garlic, onion, corn, carrots, yellow curry powder (2t), garam masala (2t), thyme, sea salt. After simmering the chicken/broth I added the veggie/curry mix. Then am letting it sit until dinner time without heat.  Mistake: I should've added the broccoli later. It's not a bright green now. 

I seasoned the chicken broth with curry as well. Because the chicken 'eats' up seasoning, I added more curry, salt, garam masala. A second box of broth was necessary, so it has a soupier consistency. I doubt I'll add the cream or flour. It's good as is.

Took some of the advice from other reviews and sautéed the garlic and onion prior to adding. 
I used bacon grease in the sauté tho...Yum!
Also, as we are dairy free and gluten free, I added gluten free flour and rice milk to thicken with a dash of gluten free corn starch. 
Awesome recipe you provided. 
Thanks!

This was very good. I sautéed the broccoli, cauliflower, onions and chopped garlic  with 1/2 stick of butter. After adding the broth,  I cooked it on low for about 15-20 minutes.  I also added cayenne pepper. I used an immersion blender and kept some chunks purposefully. I did not use the milk, flower or bullion granules.  I did add about a half teaspoon of salt. Thanks for posting

I doubled this recipe and made it more Keto friendly and I must say it was delicious! I skipped the milk and flour and used about 1/2 cup of heavy cream (1/4 cup for the recipe as listed), I added 1/2 tsp of minced garlic and I must have missed the boullion cube listed in the recipe since I didn't add it and would have, had I seen it. I honestly didn't miss it and I always think soups need boullion. This was awesome. I ended up making this in my instapot pressure cooker on the soup setting and blending it once it cooled over night. (the blending made it sooooo creamy compared to before)  Soooo good. I would make this again and again. The curry is such a good flavour in this.

Great recipe! I just added more vegetables. Sautéed the onions in butter with two chopped carrots, two stalks of celery and one leek. Doubled the chicken stock and tripled the curry powder. (Had a big head of cauliflower and broccoli.) Also doubled the flour-water mixture but not the cheese. Used extra sharp Cheddar and Gruyere, about three parts to one. With all that stock, I left out the bouillon granules. A couple pulses with the immersion blender and it was silky, curry happiness in a bowl.

Delicious. I  substituted the milk for 1 can of coconut milk. Took 1/4 cup of that milk, mixed with 1/4 cup flour to thicken it up, then i used my immersion blender to purify. It was SUPER delicious, thick and yummy.

So good and so easy to tweak to taste. I made it the first night, then turned it into a Thai soup by adding Thai chilis, coconut milk, basil, and shrimp. This can be a very versatile base for many different combinations.

This is a good and easy soup. I had the broccoli and cauliflower hanging around in my fridge for ages and looked for a recipe use them in. The only thing I did differently was I blitzed the soup till smooth before adding the flour and milk mix and the cheese. Made for a great supper, and I have four more portions for lunches in the week.

I followed the recipe and added onion per the chef footnotes.  Well, I did chop the greens from the cauliflower and added after the garlic. Once cooked, it tasted very fresh and quite nice. I did add some hot curry powder and it was great. My wife added grated swiss and parmesan cheese to her bowl and said delish! Great recipe, thanks!

Oh my this is sooooo yummy. It is just the right flavors and really great textures. I am so glad I followed this recipe exactly because I like the chunkiness of the veggies, but they are soft and fabulous. This will definitely be one of our regular recipes! Thanks for sharing.

This turned out really well! I cut the curry powder in half and added mashed potatoes and a little extra broth. I used the immersion blender to puree about half of the mixture and left the other half chunky.  Would definitely make again.

I added garlic and carrots, also sauted the onion and garlic in olive oil before following the recipe.  The result was creamy and delicious.  not sure why the other reviewers had an issue with consistency.

I'm a neophyte cook, yet this dish came out great! My wife even went back for seconds! Pretty much followed the directions, used garlic salt rather than regular salt. This one is going into my "we'll do this again" book. Thanks!

I upped the curry powder a fair bit to have a really solid curry flavour. That said, it's a good solid soup.

This was so good!  I made it according to the recipe except I added celery since I had some that needed to be used up.  Absolutely delicious.  I don't really notice the curry so if you are a big fan you may want to increase it!

Very tasty...I like spicy soups so I added jalapeno, chipotle and habanero powders and some cumin  along with the curry.  I used gluten-free flour and it worked great. Not sure it even needed the cheese...but then cheese is always good!

I like it but my family did not so much.  They do not like the curry taste.  I did reduce it at first so maybe I should have kept it reduced.  Chop finely....it is better that way..  And be careful to not warm cheese too much.  I would possibly add a bit more broth next time and half the recipe.  It tastes best when right off stove.

just made this soup and it is wonderful. Looked at other reviews and made it vegetarian and added garlic and red pepper.  Perfect on a wet, dreary January evening.
mm good

Very good! Sauteed veggies in olive oil with 3 garlic cloves and 4 tsp curry. Emulsified before adding milk and cheese. Can garnish with chili oil. Makes 4-5 main servings.

It was really good! My husband was being sarcastic about it when I told him I was making it. He was pleasantly surprised at how yummy it was! I will definitely be making this soup again!! I added a little bit more curry.

So tasty and easy! I would recommend using a food processor with all the chopping involved. A subbed Almond milk for regular milk, but otherwise kept everything the same. It was a hit, even with my finicky boyfriend.

Yummy, COMFORT SOUP!  Family loved it! I "tweaked" the recipe because I enjoy caramelized onions and garlic, so I  sautéed the onion, garlic, and for color, added baby carrots  together in EVOO, then added a small splash of white wine and teaspoon ea of cumin, and coriander (cuz I'm not yet fond of curry). Then, I followed all that up in a pot with the rest of the ingredients, and allowed it to simmer until the broccoli and cauliflower were tender. Toasted Garlic NAAN Bread was served on the side.

The second time I made this I did a 2:1 BROCCOLI TO CAULIFLOWER RATIO, DOUBLED THE CURRY AND accidentally had to add swiss because I forgot to buy the cheddar. Wow- the swiss and curry are amazing together. I also cooked onions in butter first

I modified it be carb-friendly.
My teenager and I really liked this version of broccoli soup.  I did not add the flour and milk to thicken.  For us it was thick enough after adding the cheese.

This was good and easy.  I added slivers of carrots, and thyme when cooking the vegetables.  I cooked the onion in butter first, then added celery and garlic, about 4  minutes total, before adding vegetables.  I added a teaspoon of dry mustard with the curry and a little cayenne.  I substituted some of the milk with half and half.  No chicken granules on hand.

Pretty tasty.  I added minced garlic and fresh grated ginger and sauteed them with the onion and curry powder in a couple tablespoons of butter first.  Then added in the broc/cauliflower and stock.  Once cooked I blended for a smoother texture before adding in the milk and cheese.  Will make again!

This is great!  I added cloves of garlic and another cup or so of water.  I used 1 T of curry and I added 2 cans of cannellini beans instead of the flour and milk.  Since I used my immersion blender, I didn't need to chop things small which saved lots of time.  Wonderfully creamy, flavorful soup!!

Wowee this was really good!  But don't bother finely chopping the broccoli and cauliflower.  That's what an immersion blender is for! I roughed chopped both and after they had simmered in the chicken broth for about 20 minutes I used the immersion blender on them.  This was a nice little change from regular broccoli/cauliflower cheese soup. The curry was a nice touch.

I added couscous at the end, took it off the burner, covered and let sit for about 5 minutes. It made the soup hearty, and stretched it a little more.

I have made this recipe now quite a few times and I am always asked to make it again! I add a touch of allspice to highlight the curry, and I usually bump the curry up quite a bit. But it was the first dish I have ever tried with curry in it and have loved curry since then!

Excellent Soup!  I used Patak's curry paste and omitted the cheese (too many calories for me) and it was wonderful.  I added a small jalapeno pepper and sauteed all the veggies first.   A pleasant change.  Two bowls of soup and a lovely pumpernickel bun made a perfect late night supper.  Thanks

Very tasty.  I used water instead of chicken broth and added Spike instead of bouillion cubes, and it still turned out yummy.  I also used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour.  Super easy to make.  I used a food processor to chop the cauliflower/broccoli/onion, so that went very quickly, too.

Great soup! Added chicken, LOTS of curry powder, saute'd the onions and added a little more water. Mine turned out a little thinner than I wanted, but mostly I just wanted to eat rather than wait for it to thicken! It tasted great! Good recipe...it will go in my rotation of soups for sure.

This soup is excellent! I did sautee the broccoli and cauliflower a bit first. Already added to my "soup folder". For those afraid of curry (as was I), don't be. It's a beautiful addition to this soup.

I had a few mushrooms that I had to use so added them too.  I sauteed the sliced mushrooms with the onion before adding to the other veggies cooked in the chicken broth.  (I added the curry to the onion/mushroom mixture and let it saute a bit as well.)  A very pleasant, comforting soup.

This was great.  I didn't change much accept that I added onion powder because I didn't have an onion and I added  a potato.  The curry was a nice addition.

Very good soup. Only change I made was to saute the onion before adding the broth & veggies. Fast & easy to make. Will definitely make this soup again.

Great comfort food. Quick to make and so yummy! I made a few minor changes; I left out the curry powder as I planned to feed it to my toddler (she loved it by the way!) and the bouillon granules. I also only had beef stock on hand so I used a carton of that then added water to it just until my veggies were submerged. At the end I pureed it with my hand blender to make it extra smooth and creamy. It was enjoyed by all. Did I mention that it only took 30 mins in total to prepare? I'll be making this again in a pinch!

My family enjoyed the soup.  However, I made several variations.  First of all I reduced the cauliflower, as others have suggested to 50/50 with the broccoli.  Added some carrots (for color)& celery.  Cut all the vegtables in a food processor which eliminated a lot of chopping and pureed 1/2 of the final soup in a blended.  Lastly, my household is not big on curry so we scratched the curry but added 1/2 cup of sour cream.

This soup didn't seem to have enough flavor.  I ended up adding 2 cloves of garlic to this recipe, and about 1 tsp additional curry powder (2 tsp total).  The texture was thick enough that I didn't add the flour mixture to the soup.  I'd say this recipe was just OK.  I'm not sure if I'll make this again.

I softened the onion in the stockpot before adding the broth and veggies. Also added the curry powder until it was how I wanted. Had it with onion paratha. Good stuff. Thanks!

A great recipe for fall and winter. The white cauliflower in my supermarket was a bit dated, so I bought orange cauliflower (same taste). It turned mostly white during cooking. I didn't have the granules, so I used buillion cubes instead. I sprinkled croutons on top for serving
