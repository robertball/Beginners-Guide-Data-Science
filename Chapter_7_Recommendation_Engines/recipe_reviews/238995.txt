After I made this, I added more honey and some vanilla extract.  Icy and not-so-sweet, this works for a mid-afternoon break, and it has a very pretty color.

Perfect flavor mixture. I even made other batches without the aloe and almond butter. Even won the kids' approvals. Will be making this a lot!
