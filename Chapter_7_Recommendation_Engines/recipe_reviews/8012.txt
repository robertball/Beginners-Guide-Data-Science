This was an amazing recipe.  I altered it a little bit, but it won a cooking contest at a party!

This is one fantastic, easy cake. I didn't, however, buy dried apples, I just peeled the apples, sliced, and cooked over med. heat until they mashed into homemade applesauce (while the cakes were baking). It is super easy, I am glad I have a powerful kitchen-aid, the batter is dough like and would be hard to stir!

I had a request for an apple stack cake and this recipe sounded like exactly what my friend was looking for, however it was not at all what I expected.  The flavor was fine, but this does not bake up like a regular cake - it's more of a shortcake.  Very thick and not very sweet.  Perhaps I did not have enough of the filling to soak into the layers.  That's where the real flavor comes from.  You have to press the dough very evenly into the pan as it does not rise or change shape at all.  If the middle if low, your entire cake will look like a sunken ship.  Again, if this is what I had expected, I might have made more of the filling or used a very juicy strawberry topping.  I might just do that!

I made this for the first time yesterday, and it really was a tasty treat. I added cream/powdered sugar drizzle over the top. It tasted good the day of, but I would agree that letting it sit for 24 hrs. lets the flavors blend nicely.
