this was tasty! i made a few modifications based on the ingredients i had on hand: substituted grapes for strawberries, pecans for walnuts and tomato-basil feta for regular feta.  i also just used a bag of a 7 lettuce blend and used 1/2 raspberry vinagrette and 1/2 balsamic to fight off some of the tartness of the feta.  great way to use some of the pears i had.  delish!

Great combination of ingredients!  Don't skip toasting the walnuts!  I used "Honey Dijon Balsamic Vinaigrette" from this site for the dressing.  The only changes I made were to use all spinach (skipped the romaine) and canned pears.

In the past, I have had variations of this salad with bits of bacon and blue cheese added as well.    I like the idea of adding pears - will definitely try soon - thank you for the recipe!

This was very good. I served it with a grilled pork tenderloin and made a meal out of it.

loved this! I made it exactly to recipe, and it turned out wonderfully. It was such a hit!
I did do a few things slightly different: I didn't use quite as much dressing (not even 1/2 cup total), and I used canned half pears in water. I served it with Rosemary Roasted Pork Tenderloin.

I made this recently for a ladies' luncheon.  I wish I had taken a photograph, because mine looked much better than the photo shown here, which doesn't show any strawberries.  My friends raved over how sensational it looked, and then raved again over how superb it tasted!

We really enjoyed this! I didn't use quite all of the feta cheese. If I anticipate leftovers next time I'll dress it at the table rather than put it in with the lettuce and spinach. The dressing wilted in and it was terrible the day after I made it. Delicious on the table and very pretty!! Definitely a keeper.

I used English walnuts, because that is what I had. Other than that one sub, I followed the recipe.  I haven't combined pears with strawberries before, but everything came together with the balsamic vinaigrette.
