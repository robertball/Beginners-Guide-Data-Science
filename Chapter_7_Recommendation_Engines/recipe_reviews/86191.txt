Gosh, is this ever an overlooked recipe!  This meat-salad-vegetable-and-fruit recipe, all wrapped up into a one-dish meal, is SO delicious and pretty healthy too!  I only had time to marinate the chicken breasts for about 30 minutes, so I pounded them too to ensure that the marinate would soak in well and it did.  The marinade gives such a delicate flavor, yet it's definitely there.  I had never grilled asparagus before and it was fabulous.  For the greens, I used romaine from our garden, mixed with baby spinach, and I tossed in a sprinkling of feta cheese which was lovely.  This dressing is just great and I will use it for other salads.  Thank you, Pam Anderson, for a wonderful recipe!

Both my boyfriend and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I cut each chicken breast into 3 pieces and marinated for about 3 1/2 hours.  I then grilled inside on a George Foreman and both the chicken and asparagus turned out great.  I will definitely make this again.

Adjustments I made were simple. Instead of making the mojo marinade, I bought Goya's Mojo marinade (check in the Spanish sections of your grocery store!). I left about one-fifth of the bottle for the dressing. Next time, I will let them marinate overnight to see if there is a difference; this time they sat for about nine hours. For the asparagus, I lightly drizzled it with olive oil and fresh lemon zest before I put them on the grill to get them nice and hot.


I subsituted the mixed greens for spinach, kept the oranges. For the dressing, I had pineapple-orange-banana fruit juice on hand and filled the mojo bottle to be about half-full. It was a great fruity but fun combination and everyone loved it!

This was pretty good.  I didn't grill the asparagus because it was for a party & I grilled ahead of time.  I steamed it, but it would be better grilled. Next, I used canned mandarin oranges rather than fresh.  The greens part needs some jazzing up.  Next time I will add feta cheese & either spicy pumpkin seeds or carmelized pecans.  The marinade is great, but as a dressing, I thought it was a bit too much orange.  I will probably add more lime juice next time.  Very good summer recipe.  All the women I had over for my patio party LOVED it.  I also made Lemon Posset from this site for dessert & cucumber slices topped with dill seasoned cream cheese mixed with a can of crab meat for an appetizer.

This was okay, but I'm pretty sure it's because I used fresh-squeezed orange juice instead of the concentrate.  Will make this again to taste the difference!

This is so good and summer-y! I used vegetarian "chicken" substitute and tangerines instead of oranges. Everyone loved it!

I use allrecipes.com all the time and this is my first time rating- don't know why I waited. This really was quite delicious and a light option on a hot evening. I did not add quite as much olive oil to make the dressing but other than that I followed exactly--everyone really enjoyed.

you can add what you like( nuts, cheese,etc) but don't change a thing on the basic recipe! I used fresh orange juice because that is what I had on hand..tasted a little weak so I added zest.. also didn't have mint so I added a extract wow! My mouth feel like I had mint candy..all grilled on indoor grill.....next time I will use fresh mint..although the extract was delish! Gonna make this for my girlfriends.......thanks Lisa

This salad can be personalized to almost any taste! 
The vegetarians in our family left off the chicken, but added some feta cheese.
I skipped the asparagus and added goat cheese and walnuts.
My husband tossed in some crumbled bacon.
All five of us loved the dressing! Which really surprised me,  since I was seriously doubting the combination of ingredients.
Baby spinach, romaine & iceberg lettuce, and a handful of red cabbage were our 'greens'.
This will be great for brunch, but also made a satisfying dinner!

Don't be deceived by the not-so-great pics.  Sorry, I had to say it.  This is absolutely a 5-Star.  Will make again and often.  Take your time to marinate and grill and you'll be very happy.

We loved it. Had our neighbor over, and he loved it as well. Very tasty, a good summer-y meal. Light and filling as well.
