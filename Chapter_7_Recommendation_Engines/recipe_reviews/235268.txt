This is a good base recipe. I made two changes. I used mashed potatoes instead of shredded to make the latke. I also left off the sherry vinegar. The potato really balances the sweetness of the pears and goat cheese. This dish was a big hit with my husband, who added bacon. I will definitely make this again.
