Great recipe. I made it for a light, low-price dinner. My only recommendations are 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 2 tsp of chili powder, and a tbsp of Worchestershire sauce. Makes for a great flavor combo.

Great recipe! Added a bit to it. I added 1tbs of Minced Garlic then as Mitchel suggested earlier post, added 1/2 cup Brown Sugar, 2 tbs Chili Powder, 1 tbs Worcestershire Sauce. Very tasty!

I give this a five star for taste but the little hot dogs didn't look cooked.  I think I will slightly cook the hot dogs first and them add them to the sauce
 The flavor was terrific!

I love these wonderful 'go to' football day appetizer! I like mine with a little KICK (pun intended) so I add about 3 teaspoons of lemon pepper! Gives it a great sweet/sour mix and the crowd seems to be pleased!

Made this several times and is always a hit. I also add meatballs to add a little variety.

things are delicious. I added some brown sugar, liquid smoke, chili powder, worcestershire and used Webers BBQ.  The sauce is so thick.
