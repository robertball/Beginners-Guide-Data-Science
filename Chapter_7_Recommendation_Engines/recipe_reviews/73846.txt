I believe this is a classic case of over-complicating a simple idea. Wasabi Peas are not a complex creation: Wasabi + Peas + Roasting/Dehydrating = Yum. 

Never overcomplicate when the simpler idea is better.

I don't understand the poor reviews on this snack... maybe the reviewers were expecting a side dish of soft, cooked peas?? If so, this is NOT a side dish type pea... the peas are cooked until completely dehydrated (thus they are hard and crunchy) and meant to be eaten alone as a snack (they also make great additions to salads).

The prep and cooking is a little long, but these are a great snack, and you can make a bunch and freeze some for later.  You also CANNOT just put wasabi on peas and dehydrate them and get the same thing... you have to add in other ingredients to get a "dough" that will stick to the peas. I skipped the mirepoix part, but followed the rest of the recipe and I thought these were great.  Next time I will add a little more wasabi, as I like my wasabi peas very hot.

This was the most disappointing waste of time and resources - tastes nothing like they should - I followed the recipe to the most minute detail.  Still want to try to make these but they ended up dry, hard, and tasteless.

I wonder if the chef made an error in this recipe. I agree with the previous reviewer. This recipe was a great big disappointment and a waste of a lot of time. I followed the instructions closely and got a pile of tasteless peas.

This recipe is absolutly amazing the peas are delicious & have just the right amount of spice. I highly recommend that you try this amazing snack. I highly recommend that the previous reviewers also try this incredible snack since it's clear they have never made these Wasabi Green Peas before but I know they'll love them when they do.

I made it without the MIREPOIX which I looked up how to make. (It is basically 50% onion and 25 % each of carrot and celery. It is used more in different types of soup stocks as a base.) ....Everything else worked great together. I LOVE the recipe without the Mirepoix mixture. THANKS for sharing it with us!!

I love wasabi peas, but was not crazy about the recipe.  It didnt seem worth the effort when the store bought ones taste much better.  But it is kind of cool to be able to make them for yourself.

I made this a couple of weeks ago as written minus the  Mirepoix. They turned out fine for me except for a couple of things. I did think they needed more wasabi which is  an easy fix but the main problem I had was with the appearance. After so much cook time there was basically no green left in the peas. It looked like a cookie sheet fully of bunny turds. I was talking to a lady at work that makes them all of the time and she suggested a couple of things so I thought I'd try again. She said she never soaks the peas overnight or cooks them for an hour. Instead she basically starts at step 4 in this recipe. She gets the paste together and then gently mixes the freeze dried peas in until they are coated in the paste. She then only bakes them for one hour. I tried again with her method and not only did they come out better but they were way less time consuming. It's hard to give a fair rating on this one. They do work as written but they work better simplified. You be the judge...

DONT MAKE THIS!! 
I saw there were some bad and some good reviews here- and I couldn't find a recipe anywhere else so i thought Id give it a try- how bad can it be? 
... its BAD. And no i wasn't expecting a side dish, I was expecting crunchy spicy snacks..  I followed the recipe exactly, except I added TWICE the amount of wasabi to make it stronger as I saw this was one of the complaints.. 
Its appalling- 
i don't know if its the addition of the tahini or the process of roasting the paste on the peas for 10 mins- (because it was almost tasty raw..) but the final product was completely tasteless and disgusting.  After many wasted hours on this project not to mention all the ingredients.. I threw away the lot!

I went exactly by the recipe. I coated the peas with olive oil before putting on the cookie sheet. perhaps too much oil could screw it up.  I feel recipe perhaps could be more specific . I want to try again but scared and not excited anymore..
