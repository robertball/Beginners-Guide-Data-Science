These taste good, but having lived in Baja and Baja Sur for over two years, I can tell these are not _authentic_ baja-style fish tacos... perhaps they're inspired by the orginal, but there are some weird ingredients in here.  Still, though, they do taste well.

As a companion to this recipe, people may like this one:  http://eauthenticmexicanrecipes.com/taco-recipes/simple-taco-recipe-fried-baja-shrimp-tacos-recipe-tacos-de-camarones-de-baja
It's an authentic Baja shrimp taco recipe, using the exact ingredients you'll find at the taco shops From Cabo all the way up to TJ, and it's delicious.

I used the marinade and then I baked the fish in the marinade. We did not coat the fish with the flour and stuff. It was very good. It had a great flavor combo!!

The coleslaw mix was too heavy with the mayo and sourcream.  The way the fish was prepared was not very flavorful.  It wasn't the way fresh, fish tacos should taste...

This was delicious! Everyone loved it. I'd use a little less salt next time, but my family all said no, keep it the same. I'm the cook, so I get to do what I want, but I wouldn't change anything else.

My husband is very picky about fish tacos. He LOVED it!  I plan on cutting the salt used in half. It was a bit salty for our tastes.

This is a great recipe. I'm not sure why it only has 3 stars. It's delish!! It makes a lot though, since I am cooking for 2 I would cut in 1/2 next time.

I thought 2tbsp of salt was a lot so I just put 1tbsp and it came out perfect. Also, I just pan-seared the fish with about 1tbsp of olive oil- I did not deep fry. Fish was very tasty and got a nice sear in my cast iron skillet. 

And one other thing - for the slaw, I was mixing & adding more slaw mix until I thought the coating for the mayo/SC sauce was thin enough to no be overwhelming. I think I ended up putting a little more than what the recipe called for.

End result was great and hubby loved it too. I will definitely make this again.

These were pretty good. I've never had fish tacos in a restaurant so I can't compare them to anything. I think they were a little too salty but other than that they were okay. There is a lot of chili powder but you can put in as much as you want. I thought the taste was great!

I took others suggestions and used half the chili powder- it could probably use even less.  The fish had great flavor. *UPDATE* I've now made this a few times, and I use about 1/3 chili powder (I don't like spicy at all), I let it marinade at least 3 hours and it makes all the difference in the world if you squeeze fresh lime over the taco after it's all ready.
For the coleslaw I use plain low fat Greek yogurt instead of the mayo and sour cream.  
I have done this both fried and grilled, I prefer it grilled...I sprayed a pan with olive oil and cooked it for just about 2 minutes on each side on medium heat.  
Thanks for such a great fish taco!  Very much worth tweaking to suit individual taste buds!

This recipe has a few steps to it, but the fish tacos were absolutely delicious! I used tilapia in place of the cod, and I didn't have any green onions, other than that I followed the recipe exactly as written. There was an explosion of flavor from the dressing added to the coleslaw! It was really yummy. I had some left over, mixed a bit more sour cream and mayo in it and served it to apply over the tacos if anyone needed more sauce. I have made fish tacos many different ways, from many different recipes, and this one is my new favorite! Will make this over and over again.

Excellent batter. best i have tasted. used half chili powder and salt as suggested. Used beer instead of water for marinade and added lemon. Grilled some pieces of fish. Used Pioneer Woman's cole slaw. The batter is a definite hit!

I thought these were AMAZING! I did cut the chili powder by about a third and used regular sugar because I didn't have any turbinado sugar. Very tasty and the fish had just enough of the tequila flavor. Would definitely make again!

Varied it slightly since I had lettuce not cole slaw, but it was very good.  I cut down on the salt in the marinade.  Served it with a sweet salsa and it was awesome.

I made the slaw by buying the already cut up coleslaw mix and just squeezed fresh lemon juice over the top.  Added a tiny bit of tarter and these were great!  Very fresh!~

I made this tonight for dinner, per previous review, marinated for 2 hours, the fish was very delicious, coleslaw was ok but overall we liked it, will tweak it a bit next time. Will broil it instead of frying it. Good recipe, thanks for sharing. I halved the recipe as it was only the 2 of us. :)very tasty flavor.

Tasty! Even my picky six-year-old stepson loved the fish (I left out the tequila, obviously). The coleslaw dressing was so good, I plan to make it again and use it as a dip for fresh veggies.

I love this dish and have made it more then once!  I make changes as needed based on what I have on hand.  I usually add fresh jalapeños to the marinade with the fish and I don't save any marinade for a bean mixture.  Instead I cook the marinade as is once I have taken the fish out.  We salute the fish without flour.  I serve it with a black bean & corn salad and fresh avocado.

We followed the recipe exactly as stated and received rave reviews from our guests. The fish was crispy on the outside and flakey tender inside, adding the coleslaw as a finishing touch really made the dish.
Yes, we will definitely use this recipe again and again!
