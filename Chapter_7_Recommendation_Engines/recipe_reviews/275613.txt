The flavor was very good. I really liked it a lot. I did have problems keeping the burger together. When I flipped it it fell apart I tried it again with smaller dice and even ground it all up in the food processor.. worked a little better but was still had some damage when flipping. I will try this again with maybe more crumbs.. even when it fell apart, it tasted great!
