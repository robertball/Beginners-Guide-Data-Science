I add a minimum of 3 cloves of garlic smashed and at least 1/2 cup of onion, Greek Oregano and small amount of 
Basil. I also use Kalamata Greek olives. I brush the chicken in olive oil and season with salt and pepper.  Served with a lovely Greek Artichoke and Avocado salad it is a real treat.

This is a pretty dish with lovely flavor.  I rolled and tied the breasts before grilling which worked out very well.

I added fresh chives instead of onion, fresh basil, oregano and a little garlic. I also added a little fresh squeezed lemon juice to the cream cheese. I mixed the spices and chives with the cream cheese and spread this mixture on the chicken. Then I sprinkled the feta, olives and tomato on top.  I drizzled a little olive oil on top before baking.  I didn't have any spinach so left that out but will add next time I make it. I baked it in the oven for about 40 minutes.  I'd like to try breading it next time.  Overall a nice change from what I usually make. I served it with wild rice and steamed asparagus.

Tried this recipe last night and it is excellent.  I didn't have black pitted olives so used my olive tapenade.  Too cold to fire up the bbq so used my indoor grill.  We served it with a mango/avocado/black bean salad and it was WOW. My meat and potatoes husband loved it too.   Thanks

It was the best stuffed breast we've ever had. I prepared as shown, except I added Chive & Onion cream cheese and fresh chopped chives. The breasts were over stuffed So I wrapped them in foil and grilled them 25 minutes. Wrapping them made all those flavored absorb in the chicken and didn't lose any stuffing to the fire.

Great recipe!  The recipe made more stuffing for the chicken than we needed, but we used the extra for a dip for chips and our company loved it!

Excellent recipe!  I pretty much followed it exactly, and my husband said it was the best chicken dish I've made so far.

This didn't turn out too good for me. I think it was my own fault. First of all I used frozen, seasoned chicken breast and tried to flatten them out and fold them over the stuffing. That did not work too well. Second I baked them instead of grilling them. They turned out very mushy. I may try it again but I have to get the chicken crispier. I do not like to grill chicken as it usually dries out for me.

This recipe is delicious! I made it last night exactly how the recipe states. The only thing I would add is some seasoning on the outside of the chicken. Other than that...it was AWESOME!! And there is plenty of left over filling to use for something else.

I added butterflied the breast and then put them individually into a zip lock bag of equal parts EVOO and lemon juice adding Italian seasoning to the juice and let them set up while I was preparing the stuffing ingredients.
