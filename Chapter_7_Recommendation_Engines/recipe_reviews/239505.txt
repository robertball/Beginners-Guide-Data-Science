This is close to the steak marinade we have used for 40 years and it is the very best in my book!  My Our recipe only has 1/4 c kitchen bouquet and 2 tsp beau monde (which can be made with equal parts of seasoned salt and MSG).  I only put the steak on for a brief time as I try to choose a tender cut. The flavor is NOT overpowering, but just a nice enhancement.

Very flavourful. I marinated a steak for about 3 hours and was very happy with the result. To keep it gluten free I used a homemade brown sauce and tamari sauce. Thank you for the recipe.
