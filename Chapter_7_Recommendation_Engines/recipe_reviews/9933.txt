I've got to add a comment to this too. I don't know if she typed out the wrong amount of ingredients but it REALLY didn't work! It crumbled so much that I couldn't even roll it out. I've made pinwheel cookies for many years and this one time I didn't have a recipe so I decided to search onto the internet... Just a word of warning to all that it doesn't work, I ended up trying to "somewhat" press them so I could use cookie cutters on them. Bad, bad recipe!

I've been using this recipe for years and it alway's turns out just fine using these amounts.   I usually just seperate the chocolate and vanilla dough, roll out each layer seperately between two pieces of wax paper, then just flip the vanilla layer on top of the chocolate layer and roll it up in the waxed paper jelly-roll style.   It's really a no-fail recipe as long as  you roll each layer out seperately before putting them together.

Does she really make this recipe? I'm curious as to how this woman forms ANYTHING from a ball of dough containing the exact measurements listed.  I had to manipulate the recipe in order to roll the dough. It was this horribly sticky mass of nothing that eventually formed a big chocolate and vanilla ball of nothing!!

Certainly very pretty to look at. But very bland. Not as sweet as you'd expect cookies to be. I won't make them again.

These cookies were good, but I had a little trouble rolling them into a jelly roll shape. It took me and my friend about 10 minutes just to roll it! All in all, though, it was pretty good, and all of my friends enjoyed it.

I followed this recipe exactly and they turned out great!    I must have sliced them thicker because I only got two dozen, but they are very pretty and unique looking and will add a festive look to my cookie tray.

This recipe overall was pretty good and fairly easy. I added crushed peppermint candy to the non flavored half of the dough to make them chocolate peppermint. The flavors are subtle and the cookie is not too sweet.

I substituted 3T cocoa powder and 1T butter for the unsweetened cocoa square otherwise I used all ingredients and amounts per the recipe. I tolled out the dough between 2 sheets of parchment paper, first the vanilla, then the chocolate - chilled it, assembled the 2 layers , rolled it up tightly . If at any time the dough gets difficult to work with, stick it back in the fridge . Made beautiful pinwheels :)

eating these cookies is kinda like eating floury air. they have no taste what so ever but they were pretty fun to make and they look really nice. i wouldnt feed them to others but if you make them once and take a picture you could pull off being a pretty good chef.
