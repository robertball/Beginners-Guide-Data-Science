I've never been a big fan of meatloaf but I LOVE this recipe!  I don't care for celery and my boyfriend doesn't like onions so I just sauté green and red peppers and chopped up jalapeño peppers (for a little kick) in the ketchup sauce. I also use the whole sauce to mix in with the meat rather than just half of it, along with meat loaf seasoning. All this makes for a very flavorful and moist loaf that you don't really need to put anything on it. Another trick of mine is to use the royal Hawaiian sweet rolls for the bread crumbs. The sweetness of the rolls really compliments the spicy and saltiness. Also tried this recipe with ground turkey, tastes awesome.

Surprisingly good, even tho' I had my doubts about the ketchup, er, "sauce."  I just couldn't do this with ketchup alone so I added a small amount of water and barbecue sauce.  (Dang it was good!) I loved that half the vegetable/sauce mixture went in the meatloaf, the other half reserved to serve with the meatloaf.   The fact that the recipe included all three vegetables I believe are a must in meatloaf appealed to me, however,  after noticing there was no seasoning in the recipe,  I felt compelled to add one of my favorite seasoning blends.  I scaled this down to two servings for a meal for the two of us with no leftovers.  Using just 1/2 pound of ground beef made it impractical to prepare  this as a meatloaf, so I made little muffin meatloaves with it, which made five.  If you add some seasoning, this is a darned fine meatloaf.

Delicious - I guess that's why the classics never die and this is definitely comfort food at it's best! The addition of some veggies was a nice touch. I did add just a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes to give it a little kick and I also added a little dijon mustard to the ketchup to up the flavor a little.  Overall, perfect served with "Garlicky Potatoes" from this site.

Heinz Classic Meatloaf Haiku: "Total fall-apart. Sauce nothing special either. Guess I'm glad we tried!" We love meatloaf, and also love (if there are leftovers), making meatloaf sandwiches. This particular meatloaf totally fell apart, so we ate meat-crumbles w/ the ketchup-ey 1/2 reserved "sauce" over baked potatoes and broccoli. I liked the sauteed veggies that went into the meatloaf, but w/o additional seasoning/spices, this just had very little flavor, and a far cry from a meatloaf texture.

I have made this recipe several times.  Each time I put 1/2 the ketchup/pepper mixture in the meatloaf and then I put the remaining on top of each loaf.  It almost creates a nice glaze on top vs. putting the sauce on after cooking.  Very easy and good meatloaf recipe.

This was really delightful!  Instead of the breadcrumbs I am from the old school that likes the saltine crackers. Moist, flavorful, tender and just all around GOOD!  Served with mashed potatoes and green beans with onion and bacon.  Great meal!!

I made this exactly to the recipe! It turned out wonderful, my husband who is pretty picky- said that I'd be making this again and how it's the best meatloaf he's ever had. I agreed. Yay, thanks for this awesome recipe

Good, although it seemed to have a tendency to fall apart. I think an additional egg and fewer bread crumbs would solve that issue. The sauce is terrific, and the meatloaf itself tasted very good.

After several failed attempts at making my grandmothers meatloaf, I finally turned to this recipe since meatloaf is one of my new husbands favorites. Now our family has a new meatloaf recipe. The flavor was perfect. Next time I adjust the recipe a little so it isn't as crumbly, but it tasted great!!

I can't really say that I love or dislike this recipe because I didn't follow the directions.  For one thing, I mixed up the measurements on the onion and peppers, so it had half the amount of onion (that's entirely on me).  Please be careful of this because it results in a lot less flavor.  I didn't care for the idea of the sauce, so I sauteed the vegetables and put them in the mixture with the ketchup and about a tablespoon of Lea & Perrins. I also left out the celery.  The flavor would have been much better had I used the right amount of onion.  One other thing is that the meatloaf is crumbly.  I don't know what I did wrong.  I had two pounds of meat instead of a pound and a half.  Maybe I should have used two eggs?  I will try this recipe again, only next time I'll be more aware of my measurements.  If done properly, it could be very tasty.

This was very moist and the perfect blend of flavor. My boyfriend had two large helpings and the leftovers went fast. This was good enough to be a signature dish making it again for the second time cant wait love it. I made this again without the Heinz ketchup and it isn't the same it also makes a difference what bread crumbs you use saltine crackers are best or a top of the line bread crumbs none of that granulated crumbs in a can if you do this recipe exactly as stated its awesome any deviation does not work.

I made it like it was posted and it was delicious.  I agree that it isn't a "firm" textured meatloaf...but tasty and delicious.  The firmness might can be addressed with additional bread crumbs or draining the cooked vegetables before adding the ketchup.

The sauce is wonderful. I love that there was no sugar or brown sugar added. I used oats instead of bread crumbs because I didn't have any of those. I also used 2 lbs hamburger and 2 eggs instead of one. Overall a great recipe that even my picky husband and 8 year old twins enjoyed.

This is meatloaf like my grandma made . . . delicious!  We made gluten free bread crumbs to accommodate my son, and spread the other half of the sauce (+ 1 tbs cane sugar) to the top before baking.

Very good recipe. Made a few modifications to enhance a bit and prevent a dry meatloaf. I Used 1lb of ground turkey and 1/2 lb of ground beef, formed a loaf on greased glass baking dish:
-Added 1/2 zucchini, shredded, to meat mixture
-Added 1 tbs of brown sugar to sauce
-Added 1 lb of braided bacon; covered meatloaf with the ½ portion of sauce and bacon after baking for 20 mins. Baked another 40 minutes after adding bacon.  Definitely need to kick on broiler to crisp up bacon at the end. 

Result was a very moist meatloaf that everyone absolutely loved, including my picky eater daughters. Will absolutely make this again. The sauce with the  onion, celery and bell pepper was a nice touch.

Have made this many times.  Last night I made 72 portions!  To save time, still a great result, I make only half the recommended sauce and put all of it in the meatloaf.  Then when the meatloaf is 5 - 7 minutes from being done I remove it from the oven and brush on a glaze of BBQ sauce ( whatever BBQ sauce you favor ) and put it back in the oven for the remaining time.  I do the same change when making one or two for at home.

I saw this recipe and wanted to make it but the sodium count was higher than I like to do. I found Heinz no salt added ketchup and used that for the cup of ketchup that the recipe calls for. The substitution knocked the sodium down considerably so I made the recipe. We loved it and it has gone into my saved favorites section. The sauce that you make is so good. I just spread the sauce on top of the meatloaf after it cooked instead of using as a sauce to spoon over it when served. The meatloaf looked beautiful and tasted great. We also loved the meatloaf sandwiches for lunch the next day.

I've made this as listed, and it's good but not very flavorful. When I remade the recipe, I felt that a few changes made for a 5-star experience:
First, I increased the amount of meat to 2 pounds (because that's how it came packaged, but I felt that this also gave me a better end consistency)-- this also meant increasing the cook time by about 20 minutes. I also increased the veggie and topping mixture by about a third, just based on the size of my veggies. When making the ketchup mixture, I added a bit more black pepper than suggested, plus a teaspoon each of garlic powder and paprika.
Next, with the reserved "topping" mixture, rather than rewarming it to top each slice, I topped the whole loaf with it about halfway through baking-- the sugars in the ketchup and veggies caramelized a bit and made for a delicious "crust."
Last, and I think that this would be the most optional of my steps, instead of a loaf pan, I shaped my loaf by hand and cooked it in a wide cast iron skillet. I really love the way the cast iron gives me a crisp bottom and even heating. As a bonus, I used my boyfriend's "bacon skillet" which is VERY well-seasoned, so cleanup was little more than a scrape and a rinse!
I served this with some steamed veggies and mashed potatoes, and we were in heaven. Nothing beats old-fashioned comfort food.

This meatloaf was very good, but I thought the sauce on the side was a bit too sweet.  The portion of the sauce that was incorporated into the meatloaf did not have a too-sweet effect on the meatloaf itself.  I will make it again, but I might mix in a little tomato sauce with the catsup to tone down the sweetness a bit, or find a less sweet catsup.

This was really good, could be that I tweaked it!  I used pasta sauce not ketchup and added Italian herbs.  It did fall apart, but was good crumbly hot and  cold.  Will definitely do this again.

I added >1 Cup cubed old cheddar cheese. 
I didn't bother  browning the onion - just threw it in with everything else. 
I don't like green peppers so I left it out. 
I also covered the top of the meatloaf generously with ketchup. 
The family and I loved it.

This was delicious, but I made some changes... didn’t have some ingredients. Used grated carrots instead of celery. Added a few cloves of minced garlic to the onions. Used half ground beef and half ground sausage. Didn’t have bread crumbs so I crushed a sleeve of ritz crackers. It turned out great- will make it again!

My go-to meatloaf recipe but I add shredded carrots, originally to add more veggies but now I add it every time because it does something for the texture too.

The sauce was great and the meatloaf was very good.  I followed the suggestion some folks gave by  by substituting some barbecue sauce for the ketchup.  I didn't have fresh celery so I used dried celery flakes, my wife can't eat gluten so I used gluten free bread crumbs and I used about 1 1/2 lbs of ground turkey and 1/2  to 3/4 lb of ground beef.  Everything worked well together and it made a great meatloaf.  I'll definitely try this again.

There have to be as many  ways of making meatloaf as there are kitchens in the USA. But, this one -- really brings back memories of childhood when meatloaf ruled the dinner table.

I tried several meatloaf recipes and this is my favorite.  It taste closer to my mom's meatloaf.  I think she used old bread.  I couldn't find fresh bread crumbs.  So the first time I made this I just shredded some white bread.  It was good except it did fall apart.  The second time I used saltine crackers.  Much better consistency and the taste was the same.  Both times it was a little bland even though I added a tablespoon of Worcestershire.  So when I reheated the leftovers, I topped the loaf with a little KC BBQ sauce.  Great result.  Next time,  I will spread a little BBQ sauce  over the top when I bake the loaf.

Made this recipe after using several others for meatloaf. This is my favorite. My wife said it was the best she's ever had.  I did vary it by using 3/4 lb of freshly ground pork from a pork shoulder.  The rest of the recipe was copied to the letter.

This is a basic recipe which I always use, but I make 2 changes.  I add 1/2 lb of ground pork in place of some of the beef.  Like my mother, I add about 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce.   Both these items produce a flavorful meatloaf.

This is a great recipe for starting your own meat loaf.  I used 3 lb 85% ground beef, 1 lb low-fat ground pork, 1 lb ground veal.  I added 1 tablespoon of sour cream.  I did not cook the vegetables in the skillet before incorporating them into the meat loaf mixture.  The half I kept for the serving sauce, now called tomato gravy, was done in a skillet with all the ingredients and the addition of 1 can of Red Gold Stewed tomatoes.  Okay, the gravy was really good.  I let it reduce about 1/2 before serving it.  Baked my meat loaves in foil loaf pans.  Made 3.  Froze one, ate one for dinner, one for sandwiches.

8.10.16   For us, a pure comfort food meal is meat loaf, mashed potatoes, and peas, and I have a number of meat loaf recipes that I like better than this one.  Thing that I disliked about this recipe is that the slices crumble/fall apart, so I would think more fresh bread crumbs might help.  I’ve always put Heinz® Chili Sauce on the top of a meatloaf, so instead of using all ketchup, I split the sauce between ketchup and chili sauce, which ramped up the flavor just a little bit...I did like the sauce.  This was a little weak in flavor (minced garlic at a minimum would have helped), but it was OK, and leftovers will make good sandwiches (another favorite of ours), but doubtful I’ll make this again.

The flavor was ok and that is why I gave it 2 stars. Otherwise, it just feel apart and didn't have "meatloaf" consistently. And again, it was just okay taste wise. Won't repeat this recipe.
