This is good but be aware that Worcestershire sauce is tradionally made from anchovies and therefore NOT vegetarian... some may not care, but I believe there are veggie worchestershire sauces out there too.

My boyfriend and I were happily surprised (we are NOT vegetarians).  I did some changes, though.  It calls for a crazy amount of rice.  I used maybe a cup of cooked rice.    AND it doesn't tell you when to add the rice.  I blended everything but the rice in my food processor.  Then I mixed the rice by hand in a bowl.  Also, I used one whole egg and one egg white.  I served it on top of mashed potatoes, topped it with onion gravy and french fried onions and mushrooms.  It was awesome.

This is really good,I did change a few things. I left out the package of onion soup as all the ones at the store were either NOT Vegetarian or they had MSG in them. Also I used Vegetarian  Worcestershire sauce. I added onion powder,garlic powder,black pepper and 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour. It's a keeper! Thank you :)

This was great, but I'm glad a previous reviewer mentioned that worcestershire has anchovies.  I checked the bottle in my fridge, and sure enough, not vegetarian.  I seasoned the mix with soy sauce instead.  I also didn't have any wheat germ or oat bran handy, so I substituted rolled oats for both.  Turned out great and was less expensive that way.

Turned out better than expected.. didn't have oat bran or wheat germ, used 1 cup of cooked bulgar wheat instead, cooked the brown rice with 2 cloves of garlic, shredded a very large carrot and added finely diced celery. added sprinkling of sage to each stage.. my dad thought there was lamb in it.. also used regular button mushrooms.. that's what i had on hand

I don't like mushrooms but I made this for my vegetarian husband (and our other guests) for Thanksgiving.  Everyone loved it and some even went back for seconds.  I'll take their word for it that this recipe is five stars.

I loved this tasty treat.  Even my husband, the meat lover, had seconds and even ate leftovers.  This has never happened before with the veggie meals I make.  Thank you so much for the delish dish!  :-)

This is definitely a great recipe!  I made it almost to the letter, other than I had only Shitake mushrooms on hand.
It turned out really yummy... there are a few mods I would do next time: cook the rice in broth, only add 1/2 cup of wheat germ and instead 1.5 cups of oat bran.  Wheat germ is rather bitter.  Also I am thinking of maybe incorporating some brown sugar into the loaf as well.

I served it with the brown sugar glaze on top.

Thanks so much for sharing!

This was very good, though extremely dense. Also, as I did not have my food processor there was a lot of chopping, so plan accordingly. I added a small carrot grated, and think I will add 2 small carrots next time. Used vegetarian worcestershire and rolled oats. I am also going to crumble some of it and try it as a taco filling. Seems like a very flexible recipe. Also will see how it freezes.

It had an interesting nutty flavor but had a crunch texture and was too bland for my taste. I will probably not make this again.

I found this recipe DELICIOUS, but I must point out that Worcestershire sauce is not vegetarian-friendly because it is made with anchovies.

LOVED IT!!!  I made it as close as I could get to the recipe.  I did cut the wheat germ to a 1/2 cup and added 1 1/2 oatmeal since I didn't have oat bran.  I used one pkg of Uncle Ben's Whole Grain cooked rice, added two shredded carrots as suggested, and used 1/4 tsp of Parsley flakes and onion powder plus 1/8 tsp celery seed and paprika.  I, also, added Weber Garlic and Herb Seasoning to taste (before the eggs) in place of the onion soup mix.  I typically don't use it.  Topped it off with BBQ sauce and PERFECT!  I had several meat eaters who were surprised at the wonderful flavor!  Making it again as I enter this!!

Great recipe! I made it vegan by simply subbing soy sauce and using 2 flax eggs (1 tablespoon ground flax seed to 2 1/2 tablespoons water) each. It was delicious!  Oh, and I didn't have wheat germ so I subbed ground oatmeal, also added minced carrots. Thanks for this keeper.

I was so excited to try this recipe! I did choose to make it gluten-free, opting for cooked quinoa in exchange for wheat germ. It held together extremely well, I may even try it in muffin tins as I do with regular meatloaf the second time around. And the texture was spot on! Next time I might also try to roast the red peppers and toast the walnuts to enhance their flavors as well as skip the sage and lessen the amount of onion soup mix used...all just personal preferences. Thanks Penny P. for posting this recipe!

This is a great recipe although I made several changes.  I didn't have oat bran, wheat germ, or onion soup mix so I used onion powder and I ground up some whole oatmeal and used that in place of the oat bran.  I used whole eggs instead of just the whites.  I didn't use Worcestershire sauce.  I also baked it for 45 minutes then slathered a layer of ketchup on top and baked it for another 15 minutes.  It's a very flexible recipe, I've made it a few times and it always comes out great!

I added shredded carrots and more Worcestershire sauce, but I really liked this recipe.  My husband was less impressed, but he ate it for dinner.  Oh well, more leftovers for me!  Thanks!

This was so delicious and amazingly looks like meatloaf! Hubby really loved it! I followed the recipe almost to a T, the only things I did different were, oatmeal instead of oat bran, the whole eggs instead of egg whites, and whole grain mustard instead of prepared mustard. Also couldn't find crimini  mushrooms so I used baby bellas. Outside of doing a good bit of chopping, it was super easy to make! I will be making this again! Thanks for the recipe!

I had two pounds of baby portabella I needed to get used and someone had mentioned making a "meatloaf" with them. I came here looking for some ideas. I found this recipe. Wow! My mouth is so happy with this loaf!  The mushrooms, rice and onion soup mix are a marriage made in heaven.

Some people mentioned Worcestershire sauce having an anchovy base. That I knew, since I am deathly allergic to fish, so I've always used this recipe to replace it:  2 tsp soy sauce, 1/4 tsp lemon  juice, 1/4 tsp sugar and a dash of hot sauce.  It's a quick and easy way to eliminate the fish if you discover it lurking in your sauces.

But I digress. I followed this recipe slavishly but for the above Worcestershire replacement. I will make this again every chance I get, exactly according to the recipe, and my mouth will dance happy dances and sing happy songs each time.

Overall this came out tasty but I did have to make a few swaps & tweaks  in order to make it vegan. Moreover, in the future I will add lentils for enhanced texture  and will add unsweetened applesauce as a binder in lieu of eggs. 
So instead of plain old brown rice, I used brown rice, wild rice, thinly sliced carrots and a few tiny broccoli florets. 
I didn't have oat bran or wheat germ, so instead I used 1/2 cup of cooked kamut hot cereal. 
I also swapped the Worcestershire sauce for liquid coconut aminos. I didn't have sage or mustard so I skipped that.  I just used Italian seasoning and dried basil. Instead of onion soup powder, I used a few dashes of low-sodium Adobo seasoning. 
For the glaze on top of the loaf, I used a mixture of organic ketchup and honey. 
This recipe is a good foundation for a meatless loaf, but a few tweaks are definitely necessary to perfect this dish.

It's been years since I made this, but remember it was the best vegetarian meatloaf ever. I'm dusting off the recipe to make for Easter lunch. This time I will probably use quinoa instead of rice, and quinoa flakes instead of oat bran, add some nutritional yeast. The walnuts give it an added dimension, do NOT leave those out, unless allergic. Oh, and I never use packaged mixes any more, so will leave out the onion soup mix, add garlic and onion powder.

I enjoyed the flavor for the most part, but it did not hold together for me.  It came out of the loaf pan in one nice piece, but when I attempted to make slices it simply crumbled.  I did use one whole egg instead of two whites, and used wheat bran instead of oat.  Perhaps that made the difference so I won't let that texture problem affect my rating.  I may try again with a second egg.

Trying to eat less meat and tried this recipe. I don't really care for mushrooms but I decided to be a little adventureous. I use 2 portabello mushrooms, used onion powder instead of the soup mix, regular yellow mustard was all I had and threw in some flaxseed since I didn't have wheatgerm or bran. I've made it twice and it's a keeper.

I made a wine-based gravy to go with it, yummy!
