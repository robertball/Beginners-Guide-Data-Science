Mmmm- I absolutely loved this!!  The feta was so good!  I used sundried tomato and herb feta.  I totally omitted the extra salt and it was perfect.  I didn't want to open my block of cream cheese for just one tablespoon, so I used 2% fat Greek yogurt instead of the cream cheese.  Unfortunately I am out of panko crumbs so I had to use regular.  I only had to bake about 25 minutes- I think the time listed is too long.  Watch it carefully, as you really don't want to overcook salmon.  We had broccoli, steamed rice, and sliced avocado with this.  Loved it!

This is such a great tasting way to serve salmon.  I've tried it on chicken too, though it isn't as good.  I changed nothing about this recipe.  I make this at least a couple times a month- my husband and I both love it.

*****COMPANY WORTHY*****  This recipe is absolutely divine!  I cut the recipe in half only because I had 2 fillets of salmon.  The creamy feta topping was so rich and decadent on the salmon.  And the panko breadcrumbs added just the right amount of crunch.  You do have to cut back on the cooking time, though.  400 degrees for 25 minutes was PERFECT!

Even though I had to make a few changes due to ingredients on hand, this was very good! I thought I had salmon in the freezer, but it was Mahi mahi. I only had honey mustard and raspberry balsamic vinegar, so I was hesitant to even make it, but decided to go ahead. It turned out really good! I will make it again with the correct ingredients. Thanks for a new fish recipe we all enjoy! One question... I saw cream cheese in the instructions, but not in the ingredients.????

Love this recipe!  Tonight I was out of feta so I substituted crumbled blue cheese and skipped the cream cheese and my husband thought it was even better than the feta version.

Amazing! This is, without a doubt, the best salmon recipe I have ever tried. I used small salmon fillets, so my cooking time differed, but that's the only change I made. We're looking forward to having this again soon! Thank you :)

This was really good, but 35-45 minutes was WAY too long too bake on 400.  I thought it seemed to long and thank goodness I checked it at around 20 min and it was already borderline overcooked.  Salmon is definately better moist, so I would suggest checking in around 15 min.  Otherwise was great.  Used balsamic and was tasty.

Mmmm, this was really good!  I cut the recipe in half since I was not using such a big piece of salmon (smaller pieces).  Did everything as stated but left out the onion powder since I didn't have any.  I did use light feta/cream cheese/mayo, baked about 25 mins or so and did not line my pan with foil, just sprayed instead.  Turned out fantastic - served with brown rice and simple steamed green beans!

We thought that this was good, but WAY too salty.  I used a 1 1/2 lb fillet, 1/2c. panko instead of 1/3c. then baked for 20 minutes.  The fish was was well done, the bread crumbs not crunch- which was a disappointment, but this has a lot of potential.  Next time I'll leave out the salt and cook at a higher temp for less time.  Very worth trying.

We usually eat our salmon naked, and love it just fine that way. After we tried this my boyfriend says to make it this way from now on, very good as written.

Lucky me, I was gifted with a huge piece of fresh caught salmon. I went searching thru my saved recipes and found this one I had saved last summer and hadn't made yet. Well every ingredient required is a pantry staple for me, so no reason to run to the store. I can guarantee, this will not be the last time I make this. The kids loved it and so did I. I did use the panko bread crumbs instead of regular ones also.

Very good.  Though I would prefer it with less dijon mustard, the boyfriend loved it that way.  The taste was strong enough to match the salmon and it was easy and tasty!

It was tasty but I found that the topping made the salmon seem a bit mushy, I can't do mushy salmon.  I possibly did something wrong but it turned me off a bit.  Much prefer salmon on the plank.

This was great. I am not a fan of dijon or balsamic. Tasted great without it! Thanks for sharing. The bread crumb topping makes it extra special.

This was AMaZING! I can't believe how wonderful and tender the fish was. I have made this twice now and both times my husband asks for more!
This second time I made it, I used wasabi mayo to give it a kick! :) thanks so much for the wonderful recipe! Keeper

I'm greek and you'd think that putting feta on my salmon would be something I'd enjoy... Im gonna say that I didnt enjoy it as much- I find that all the ingredients took away from the salmon instead of enhancing the flavour. I would use this recipe if I knew my guest didnt like fish as it takes away the fishy flavour. My man loved it which is why I gave it a 3 whereas I liked it but wouldnt make it again.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was delicious. I wasn't sure what to expect as I didn't want to taste the mixture that is layered over the salmon. I waited until it was done...cooked to perfection...it was a rather thick and lengthy piece of salmon. I let it cook for approximately 50-55 minutes. I couldn't make up mind what to serve with it. In the end, I decided on buttered and herbed pasta and a caesar salad. Hubby thought it was delicious. Thanks for this great recipe.

WOW!!! I have been looking for ways to prepare salmon since I have just started eating it and by far, this is the best recipe I have found. I followed it exactly with the exception of omitting the salt and it was perfect. Thanks so much.

This was awesome! The only change I made was to use garlic salt, instead of regular salt and I was quite liberal with the panko. Even my husband who doesn't like salmon enjoyed this recipe. I will be making this again the next time salmon goes on sale:)

This quickly became one of my favorite salmon recipes.  The topping is creamy and yet crispy at the same time, and the tanginess of the feta and balsamic vinegar really complements the flavor of the fish. Previously, my favorite salmon recipes all had asian flavors, but this one has totally different flavors and works well with more traditional side dishes, so it's easier to plan a menu around it.  It's also really quick and simple to prepare. A definitee 5-star!

I liked it, but thought the coating was too much and too "heavy". I didn't put any salt, as it was salty enough already, and baked for about 20 - 25 minutes only. I don't know if I will try this again sometime, but at least there were no leftovers.

Wow!  This is terrific!  The coating is much thicker than I had imagined it would be -- next time I might cut it in half or just cook more salmon.  My entire family loved this -- even my sometimes picky kids who don't like a lot of "stuff" on their meat/fish.  Thanks for sharing!

I always try out thing on just me and my husband first.  I tried this one and was SO happy with the results I had to call my mother and brag about it.  (My family doesn't think Iknow how to cook).  So the next family gathering I made this and they were AMAZED!  Thanks for a great recipe that was easy and I could  prove to my family that I do all right int he kitchen!

Salmon-tastic! :o)  I didn't have onion powder or paprika so I had to substitute a little "Cajun seasoning" - worked great! Oh, I also checked it after only 18 minutes (tip from a previous review I read - Thanks!) and it was ready!  I didn't over-cook my salmon for once - amazing.  YUMMERS!

Delicious flavors. Everything worked well together. Anything more than 15 minutes @ 400 for salmon is overdone though. I noticed that the salmon was cooking too fast for the bread crumbs to toast so I put the pan on a higher shelf for the last few minutes to get that crust.

YUM!!! I don't even really like fish(pass me the tarter sauce, please), but when my husband caught a salmon I had to find a way to cook it that we both might like. This was perfect! I didn't change a thing about the recipe and I'll definitely use it again.

This was good.  It was too salty, but I think I may have spread the sauce on a little to thick.  I'd try it again though.

I have made this recipes on several occasions for friends and family and they ALWAYS rave about it. It's simple but tastes elegant. Thank you family foodie! I serve it with rice pilaf and garnish it with homemade pico de gallo (believe it or not). It comes together beautifully.

I've made this recipe several times for multiple people and every time it has been LOVED. i changed a few things though. i used a little less mayo and subbed the dijon mustard for "dijonaise" so it was a little creamier. i also never use onion powder and don't add salt. i think the feta makes it salty enough, but I LOVE making this.

I love this recipe. It has just the right ammount of flavor from the feta. My boyfriend is not a big fan of salmon, but he really enjoyed this dish. I have made it twice now, and changed nothing.

YUMMM!! Even my salmon hating husband LOVED this & wants to eat it once a week!! I didn't add the salt, had to sub the cream cheese with sour cream, cooked for about 18 mins., then topped with capers (which my husband says takes it over the top!) This was so amazingly good!! Thank you for such a great recipe!!

This was a very good recipe!  I made it for my husbands birthday dinner and he fell in love.  I didn't put as much salt in as it called for, since feta is so salty to begin with.  I also didn't have balsamic vinegar, so I used red wine vinegar instead and it was still amazing.  Double thumbs up for this one!!!  Definitely a keeper!

I loved this recipe! I also had to change it just a teeny bit. I didn't have balsamic vinegar or the mustard so i used a dash of zesty italian dressing, white vinegar and dry mustard. I can't wait to make this for my fiance.

I followed some tips I saw in the comment section and only did it for 20-25 minutes and the fish was perfectly done for me. I personally don't care for the breadcrumbs but my family liked it and thought it added texture. Overall tasted great, I will make it for myself again but at the times where I make it just for myself I'll omit the breadcrumbs.

This is incredible. I just recently started eating fish. I followed the recipe with the ingredients I had on hand and added a few of my own to make up for the rest. It turned out wonderfully!! I put sliced lemon around the corners to make for a nice finished image for serving. Paired it with pan roasted new potatoes and garlic, sprinkled with feta, and a side of peas.

I had this dish in a restaurant and as soon as I got home I went to this site looking for a recipe. Both my husband and I absolutely loved it. The only ingredient adjustment I would make would be to eliminate the salt as the feta is quite salty itself. When I cook most fish I find that 20 minutes at 400F is perfect. My search is over for the best salmon recipe I have ever had.

Tried this recipe with salmon then tried it with boneless, skinless chicken breast - works equally well with both. On additional attempts at the dish, added chopped walnuts to the panko crumbs, and on another occasion added a dried Italian herb blend. Were welcome additions to the otherwise bland panko crumbs.

My fiance actually made this last night but he followed the recipe exactly (although he did scale it in half). I have to say this was the most delicious salmon I've ever had. It turned out really moist and the crunch from the panko combined with the melty feta was out of this world. This will definitely become lay off our rotation.

We loved the topping in this recipe, and made it almost exactly as written, except that we always use full-fat dairy. The salmon itself was a little dry, however, after cooking just over 20 min. I feel that this was my own fault, however, as I use salmon steaks instead of fillet, which may have made a difference in the cooking time.

I didn't know what to expect, but this recipe was delicious!  Interesting blend of flavors.  We eat salmon often and I wanted a new way to make it.  I followed the recipe exactly and will definitely be making it again!

I made it first for my wife and I. I had to modify the quantity to accommodate smaller portions. We loved it!

I made to fillets as a Thanksgiving alternative for the meat haters. What little that was left was parsed among those that insisted on taking some home.

 It was the hit of the Thanksgiving meal. My sister-in-law insisted I give her the recipe. I gave her the recipe I had printed out for preparing the salmon for Thanksgiving. She told me she made the dish for her office Christmas party and it was the hit of the party. 

There was a slight debate as to whether the salmon should replace traditional Christmas dinner main courses. I will make two large fillets for family and friends. I will be curious to see how the salmon holds up against the traditional roast beef and turkey. I anticipate the salmon will win by a mile.

Wanted to grill but it's been raining so last minute I was searching for a recipe and found this one. Did not have cream cheese but it was  delish without and would probably skip it next time too.

I have tried salmon using 3 different recipes from this site following a fishing trip last weekend. This one wins hands down and I forgot to add some of the seasonings !!!
I can't imagine how good it will be when I do it properly!

Very yummy recipe! I forgot to read the other reviews before making this and should have omitted the salt.  Other that that, I only changed a few other things. I broiled the salmon for the last 5 minutes which gave the topping a nice, slight crunch. I didn't have balsamic vinegar so I just used regular vinegar. I also left out the onion powder and garlic powder. I definitely plan on trying this one again!

I didn't have balsamic vinegar, so I used apple cider vinegar. Also, I did not have onion powder, so I omitted it. I used homemade feta cheese which was really salty, so I should have skipped putting salt in. I thought it was pretty good, but just waaaay too salty.

We loved this and we're not big salmon fans. I mixed up the feta topping earlier and let the flavors marry for a couple of hours before topping the salmon and baking. I used light cream cheese, light mayo and garlic and herb feta cheese. I did not add extra salt nor garlic (since the cheese had a lot of garlic).  We will definitely have again.

Wow - feta and salmon is outstanding!  I used greek yogurt, no mayo, and broiled the salmon a touch at the end just to brown it.  It was a great lunch the next day, too!  (Hint: Only microwave cooked salmon on defrost, just to bring to room temp.)

Very tasty. I made this for my wife and we both really enjoyed it. I agree that the cook time is a little long. Long Brown rice is a great compliment with a good Merlot.

This turned out YUM-MY.  I loved the unexpected Feta flavor.  I was in the same situation as the author--didn't want to whip up one of my three Asian salmon recipes (all of which are very good), and I had extra Feta in my fridge.  I like the fact that there is a big variety of things in this recipe.

I omitted the bread crumbs and used plain yogurt instead of the mayo. It was good but slightly salty. I will make it again minus the salt.
