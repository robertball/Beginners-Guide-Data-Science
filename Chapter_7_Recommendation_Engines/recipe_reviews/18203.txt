I really liked this! My little brother and sister ate it, AND my parents ate it. So, that's a win at my house. I doubled the recipe and added a can of spinach after rinsing and draining it.  It tasted even better the next day!

Well, I didn't really expect much out of this recipe.  I'd used half a can of tomato soup for another recipe and was just looking for a way to use it up.  (And yes, I scaled this to half.)  I could, of course, have just made tomato soup, but what the heck, let's just try something.  It just tasted like basic tomato soup.  It's along the lines of something I sometimes make that has hot dogs and rice in it, but is even easier than this.  It was interesting to try something new, but I can't say I have reason to make it again.

I liked this recipe and it was very economical. I added a dash of garlic salt.

Not really a soup for an adult but I think it is great for kids that already eat tomato soup and hot dogs. Can tomato soup and packaged hot dogs are what they are so if you are expecting something more flavorful, herb-y, and fresh tasting then you are going to have to add it. No brainer in my book. Try having some fun with the hot dogs by making an octopus or a hot dog man to serve on top (see hot dog men recipe on this site). The kiddo's seem to always get a kick out of them.
