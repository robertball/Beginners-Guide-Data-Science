Perfect easy weeknight meal served with a green salad.
I added some onions and garlic because everything is better with onions and garlic!

This was great, and my husband loved it!  I did have to make a few minor substitutions based on what I had on-hand, though.  I used a mixture of sheep sausage and ground bear instead of the ground beef, and cheese slices instead of a blend of shredded cheeses.  I otherwise stuck with the recipe as listed, and it was just fantastic.  Warm, filling, savory, and delicious paired with a salad.

Well who knew that these ingredients would turn out so fantastic? I made as written and it was the perfect amount of flavor.  The only thing that I scaled back on was the cheese. I used about a 1/2 cup for the whole sandwich.

I really liked this!  Yummy and easy.  I keep frozen, browned, ground-beef in 1 pound amounts in baggies in my freezer, so I literally got this done and on the table in no time at all!

04.21.17 ~ This recipe has been in my files for some time.  I cooked up all the meat, but only made the opened face sandwiches for two of us.  My husband used the leftovers like sloppy joes.  He also proceeded to eat the insides of the bread that I had hallowed out.   I am married to the bread king!
It had good flavor, but the onion soup mix made it a tad salty.  I did opt to use the sliced tomato.  This dinner comes together very quickly, making it a good weeknight meal.

My in-laws are from Calgary so i had to try it! And my family liked it quite a bit!  I didn't have celery so i added chopped onion and garlic. I was thinking maybe next time trying it with canned tuna!

I cut back on the celery, added garlic and green bell pepper. I also skipped the tomato.  It was missing some spice and we found that Tony's original Cajun spice was the perfect thing to perk this up. Next time  I'll sprinkle it on top of the beef before adding the cheese. My family loved it
