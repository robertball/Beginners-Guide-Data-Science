I was wondering where the substance of these "bars" would come from because the recipe seemed to contain only a crust and toppings, without a middle.  They were a little thin and the edges of mine were hard and crunchy after they cooled so that we ended up cutting away the edges and eating the ones in the center of the pan.  They had a great taste.   Maybe next time I will make them in a square baking dish instead of a bar pan to make them a little thicker for my preference.

Anything that is chocolate and peanut butter hits the spot.My family loves these cookies. I lost the recipe for a while, but was glad to find it on here again. We make these quite a bit. Yum!

Simple to make and taste pretty good.  These are ideal when you're stressed out but have to come up with a dessert contribution.  I melted my chocolate chips with about a teaspoon of Crisco so it was easy to drizzle.

These bars are so incredible. I was a little skeptical at first because of the fact that there are only 5 ingredients but do not let that fool you! These taste so decadent and rich -- basically heaven in bar form. The sweetened condensed milk makes a delicious caramel and that paired with the peanut butter/chocolate chips is perfect. They ended up much thicker than I expected but I would still probably increase the amount of graham cracker crust and chocolate chips next time just to really make them big :)
