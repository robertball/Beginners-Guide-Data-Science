My family loved it including my 15 mos old.  I used what I had which was one very large pattypan and a yellow squash. Only change I made was to grate the onion in with the squash. These were a hit and I will make them again with zucchini.

I'm growing patty pan in my garden this year and thought I'd try this recipe. It was great! My husband who is not a squash fan ate three!

My husband brought home some pattypan squash that a coworker gave him.  I had never seen them before. So I hunted down a recipe and found this one.  My husband won't eat squash, so since he was out tonight I decided to try this recipe. The pancakes were absolutely delicious!!!

Was pleasantly surprised by this recipe.  As a gardener who is often at a loss for how to use squash up in fairly healthy way, this will be a summer regular.  I made the recipe as written except with a minimal amount of oil and water instead of chicken broth.  I applied a small amount of oil in the frying pan with a paper towel. The cakes did not have as much of a crunch without the frying, but were much healthier.

Great pancakes, easy to follow and make for not so common squash.
