This recipe is terrific, I love it. Changes: I use boneless, skinless chicken breasts and add 2 cloves of crushed garlic to the sauce. I double the sauce but not the onion soup mix, just use one packet. Also, I throw a bunch of chopped onion on the chicken before adding the sauce. I like to take the cover off halfway through cooking so the sauce reduces and thickens.

This was so darn easy. I had some chicken drumsticks to make and had no idea what to do with them when I came across this recipe.  I didn't have enuf ketchup to double it, so I added a 1/2 c. of our favorite bbq sauce; YUMMY and there was lots of sauce too.  I also layered the bottom of the pan with sliced onions... this will DEFINITELY be a keeper in our house!!!

This was very good, but I doubled the sauce and cooked it the second time uncovered! It gave the chicken a crispier skin and was much better.

I LOVED this recipe!! I would give it 10 stars if I could. I wish I had thought to add onions to the bottom of the pan, as Melissa suggested. Will do that next time.
I doubled the ketchup, water and brown sugar; but used only one package of onion soup mix. and the sauce was wonderful on mashed potatoes. Only problem was we ran out of sauce before potatoes; so I will make more sauce next time!

Try this! You won't be sorry. 
I had a package of chicken thighs and a desire to do something different without having to go shopping for additional ingrediants.
 Who doesn't have the five ingrdients needed for Chicken Hurry?
 I prepared as directed except I added crushed fresh garlic and used thighs vs a whole bird.
 My husband and kids loved this recipe.
  There are nights when you want to cook an exquisite meal and then there are nights when you want something fast,easy & delicious.
 This is a keeper, 
  Thanks, Liz

So simple, yet so good!  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  I omitted the sugar (totally not necessary), added 1/2 c. chili sauce, 1/2 c. red wine, and lots of fresh minced garlic.  Also layered bottom of pan with sliced sweet peppers and onions.  My daughter, an aspiring chef, demanded to know what was in the incredible sauce.  When I told her, she didn't believe me.  This is not barbeque sauce.  It's just a plain, simple and good basic recipe.  As with other reviewers, I will double the sauce next time.

This recipe was very good and reminded me of a recipe my mom used to make.  I changed this recipe a little.  I used chicken legs instead of thighs. I doubled the sauce but kept the original amount of brown sugar and only used half the package of onion soup mix.  I also layered the bottom of the pan with sliced onions.  There was only enough sauce to put about a large spoonful over each piece of chicken. I want enough sauce to pour it over and cover the chicken as well as an inch or so in the bottom of the pan. So after spooning the sauce I added water to the bottom of the pan, atleast enough to cover the onions.  It came out really good.  My husband liked it but said it was a little too sweet so next time I think I will omit the brown sugar all together.  I also seasoned the chicken with pepper and garlic powder before putting sauce on it.  This was very easy so I will make it again.

Easy and Good - very very good!  I often do this in the crock pot, then shred the chicken and place it  on a toasted burger bun or kaiser.

Teriffic and easy meal.  I didn't have a whole bird so I used 8 boneless skinless chicken breasts (which is apprx 3lbs) and added 1/2 TBLS minced garlic.  Served over rice and a side of steamed veggies.  Right blend of tastes and now that the school year is starting, a quick meal.  Will make this one again!!

Great and easy to make!  This is definately a man-pleaser. My boyfriend just loved it -- I did too.  I am not a cook at all, so anything that is easy to prepare and tastes good gets 5 stars from me. As it's just the two of us, I usd the same amount of sauce on two big chicken breasts -- it was fab.

Soooo good!  And so easy!  I just put the sauce together, let the chicken sit in it for 8 hours, and threw the whole thing in the oven for 45 min.  Delicious!  The sauce is mouth-watering.  I will make this often.

The family really liked this. I followed suggestions of other readers and added crushed garlic and onions. I used half the amount of sugar called for. Easy to prepare.

Great recipe!  I made mine in a crockpot and it came out excellent. I doubled the sauce (but not the soup mix or sugar) and used 1/2 BBQ, as some others suggested.  After removing the chicken to serve, I poured the sauce into a saucepan and set it to boil.  Meanwhile, I mixed equal parts water & cornstarch and added this to the sauce to thicken it.  Served the chicken with the sauce, corn bread & veggies - yummy & easy!

Loved this! I doubled it and used chicken legs only. I also added sliced onions to it while cooking. I did cook it about 40 mins covered and then 30 uncovered to brown the chicken a bit. After it was done I took the chicken out and put the cooking dish right on the stove and added a little cornstarch and water and made a gravy to put over mashed tatters...YUM! Will be cooking often.

I made this recipes a couple of years ago and never rated it!  OOPS!  It is absolutely the easiest and most fun to play around with; if you don't have all of the exact ingredients, don't worry, the basic recipe will have plates cleared in no time FLAT!  Good One!

I have been making this recipe for a long time. To cut down on the saltiness of the soup, I double the amounts of ketchup, brown sugar and water, but still only use  
1 package of soup. Excellent!

Definitely flavourful. Will probably make again...The sauce on mine got really runny (thinking the fat from the skin on the chicken thighs). But what stuck to the meat was delicious :)

The Chicken Hurry tasted just like the ingredients...a slightly sweet barbeque sauce.  I followed directions exactly and easy to make but probably won't make again.  Sorry.

Absolutely fabulous. I used wings in mine and they came out just great. I also added a few teaspoons of dried herbs to it and wow. I didn't have any onion soup so I used a chicken bouillon cube. If I could have rated it higher I would have.

My husband, who usually eats like a bird, scarfed down two large helpings of this! Definitely a keeper in our house. I followed the recipe as it was, using thighs and served with rice; excellent!

This recipe was....ok. Nothing to rave about.....until i ate it cold out of the fridge!!! (i used skinless boneless chicken thighs). Then it was absolutely irresistable!!! Note: Sauce is too salty. Cut down on the soup mix a lot. DONT double sauce, tho, as u dont want too much of it (it's very strong).

Yummmmy! This is a great recipe for chicken, pork or on top of meatloaf. Very easy and quick to prepare. The chicken really took the flavour of the sauce and the sauce would have been awesome on plain rice or potato. I didn't change a thing, not much to change. I used the whole thing of soup mix and it did not come out overwhelming. I will definitely make this sauce again. I would like to try it on plain chicken breast or pork chops.

This has become a family favorite.  It has also "saved my life" on several busy days because it is so quick, easy and tasty.  I follow the directions exactly and we all love it.  I'm surprised at the reviewers that didn't care for it -- I can't imagine why.

This recipe is just sooo yummy.  My son is a somewhat picky eater and he adores them. I've tried it with different chicken parts and a whole chicken. It's great with or without skin. I'm branching out and going to try it with pork chops. I bet they'll be fantastic.

Followed ingredients exactly but instead of baking this, as per the instructions, I slowly sauteed it in a pan on the stovetop covered with a lid for 20 minutes and then uncovered for 10 minutes more to thicken the sauce (watching carefully so the sauce would not scorch). I was using boneless, skinless thighs flattened out so cooking time was less. Excellent served on rice.

This was fantastic. Easy to make. I Doubled the sauce amounts and used 1 packet of onion soup mix, substituted 2 tablespoons of honey for brown sugar, added 2 cloves of garlic and used bonless chicken thighs. Served over white rice and it was terrific. Cooked 30 minutes covered, remaining 30 minutes cooked uncovered.

I used Leg quarters with this recipe which was great. I just had to lift up the skin and dump some of the sauce in between the skin and the rest on top. I did double the water and ketchup, added garlic and pepper, and only used 2 tablspoon brown sugar. Baked @ 350 1h 1/2 uncovered.

Pretty good stuff, like lots of the other reviews, it was too sweet. I knew I should have cut back on the sugar. I halved the amount of onion soup mix, also added some garlic powder (didnt have any fresh), a couple splashes of red wine, and sprinkles of paprika and red pepper flakes. Also cooked on top of sliced up onions.  Served on top of sticky rice. Yum! Will def make again!

I was in need of something to do with my chicken and found this wonderfully simple recipe. I had all the things on hand  and popped it in the oven and started noodles for dinner. The flavor was really good, sort of like a chicken version of meatloaf. Thank You Mom2112! I will put this in the rotation:)

I tried this recipe for the first time last night with no changes.  I agree with some of the other reviewers - the only plus about this recipe is that it is quick.  I didn't care for the oniony ketchup taste either - the onion soup did not blend well with the ketchup.  It wasn't terrible - but not fantastic either, kind of bland.  I had to throw away the leftovers.  Sorry, as I usually try not to give negative ratings, but I won't be making this one again.

This was good, but nothing to rave about.  The best thing about it was that it was amazingly easy in a pinch. I actually liked it better cold the next day.  To quote my teenaged daughter, "Mom,you've done better things with chicken."  I guess that just about says it all....

chicken dish was delicious, only made a couple of minor changes:  doubled the ketchup and added a squirt of bbq sauce with it to make 1 cup, doubled the water, left brown sugar as is, a little less onion soup mix than whole package.  Used 5 reg skinless boneless chicken breasts.  Served over plain white rice, was delicious!  Everyone enjoyed!  Also, added a bit of black pepper and garlic powder on chicken breasts and put them over a bed of onioins before pouring sauce on top...

Very Good. Love the name of the recipe also. Made it just as the recipe stated but I used boneless chicken breast and only cooked it for 45 minutes. Ten minutes before I removed the tin foil and the sauce thicken.Very tasty and the chicken was fork tender. Already added to my recipe book at home, will make often!!!

Very good, quick and easy. The ketchup taste was a bit much for my taste. Doubled the sauce but used only one package of the dry onion soup mix. Also, added a small chopped onion and two cloves of garlic. Will make again with the addition of a small can of crushed pineapple.

I have a similar recipe except it uses a bottle of Thousand Island salad dressing (or maybe it's Russian dressing??) plus a bottle of chili sauce and a jar of apricot preserves and a packet of French Onion dry soup mix. I mix it together and add my chicken pieces with it and cook it in my crockpot. (you can also use the stove-top)

This was awesome tasting.  Easy to prepare and so juicy.  I made one change though, for the half cup ketchup, I did half ketchup and half Bullseye grilled onion and garlic showdown BBQ sauce.  Super yummy over rice.  Will become a family favourite.

I tried this recipe with chicken thighs and it was finger lickin' good!  I wanted to do something different with country style ribs so I used this recipe.  Doubled up on everything (except the soup) put a hint of garlic powder on the ribs before adding the sauce.  Put the ribs in a single layer and covered them with the sauce.  I covered the baking dish with foil and baked them in a 300 degree oven for 3 hours.  THEY WERE FABULOUS - FALLING OFF THE BONE TENDER AND JUICY!!  I got lots of plans for this sauce!  I think I'm going to try it with pork chops next.

I had hopes for this dish, but none of us liked it. Even with the sugar it managed to be overly salty but still somehow managed to be bland. Besides the overwhelming taste of onion, there was no real flavor.

Taste-wise this is decent, but the sauce tended to be too runny to stick to the meat. To be avoided as a late-night snack (you're mixing ketchup, which is mostly tomatoes and liquid sugar, with more sugar).

I'll give it 5 cause the title says it all.It's nothing elegant but you can't beat the ease.I used boneless/skinless chicken breast which were a little frozen still.350 for 60 min. they were done.

I find this to be even better on skinless chicken thighs.  Amazing!  Serve with rice and the veggie of your choice.

I was gonna follow others suggestions with the onicn and garlic, but decided I should try it as is first. I'm glad I did. It was pretty good. I wasn't expecting a gourmet meal, but for what you put into it, it is decent. (kinda like sweet and sour-would be good with rice.) I will add this: Use tinfoil or parchment paper! What a burnt on mess!!!

So easy and good! I used 6 drumsticks (removed the skin) and followed the recipe, just had to add a splash of white wine to it and cut back on the water.  I also followed what others recommended with adding half an onion sliced thin to the bottom of the dish.  Doesn't taste exactly like a BBQ sauce but boy is it good! You have to try this!

This was pretty good.  I only made minor changes.  I used 6 chicken drumsticks and doubled all the ingredients in the sauce except the onion soup mix...I dipped in and gave it a taste and it did seem just a tad too sweet, so I added 2 tablespoons of worcestershire sauce.  I think that was just what it needed.  I cooked it 30 minutes covered and 30 minutes uncovered, and still wasn't done, so I spooned the sauce over it again and gave it another 30 minutes uncovered. Perfect!  I will probably make this again because it's so easy and tasty.  I wouldn't make it for a dinner party, but definitely something the family wouldn't mind eating occasionally.

8x8 pan was perfect for 3 chicken thighs. Difference was doubling the ingredients except onion mix and added a sprinkling of garlic powder and cooked on top of onion rounds. 3 1/2  - 4, best part is it is easy and moist.

This was pretty good, not sure if I would make again. I changed it a little but nothing too drastic. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of the whole chicken. Also took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the sauce except for the onion soup mix and added some garlic. Also layered bottom of my dish with onion slices. Cooked at 375 for about 45 minutes, uncovering half of the way through. The sauce was way too thick for my liking even before I uncovered it, so  I ended up adding about 1/2 cup more water to it. The chicken turned out nice and juicy, but this stuff really stunk while it was cooking. Maybe that's why I wasn't too fond of it even though it really didn't taste bad.

I make this recipes every week, since hubby loves it so much! 
Changes: Instead of Ketchup, I use Diana's BBQ sauce (whichever flavour I fancy that day!) and only use a 1/2 pack of the onion soup mix!

My first rating ever!  I followed this recipe to the letter, other than adding some marjoram, salt and pepper to the chicken before cooking.  I took it out after one hour as directed but if I ever were to try it again, I'd give it at least another half hour to cook.  

I tried the recipe because it sounded easy, even though I thought it sounded a little bit thin.  Well, it was more than thin -- I couldn't even taste the ketchup/onion mix.

I like quick and easy, but this one I won't keep in my database.

This is a quick and easy recipe (and easy to clean-up) but it was too 'blah'. The chicken had no flavor as the sauce stuck to the skin. Will not make again.

This is so simple - and has great taste.  I use chicken tenders and bake for only 45 minutes - perfect. The smell of the chicken baking is awesome.  Great for those times you want a nice meal without all the strenuous work.  I love to serve this to company - and it's wonderful not being all tuckered out from being in the kitchen all day! Thanks Liz!

I had to double the sauce to cover 3 lbs of chicken. When doubling, I used a little less brown sugar.  Also, I found uncovering the dish half way through baking, and even baking an additional 1/2 hour or so, thickened the sauce beautifully, and made it stick to the chicken pieces better.  I liked it, and it was a hit with my husband (a very picky eater)!

My husband really enjoyed this one.  He's not a big onion fan, but he still liked it.  I didn't line the pan with sliced onions like other reviewers suggested, because of the husband's aversion to onions.  I also halved the amount of onion soup mix and threw in a little extra ketchup.  I didn't alter the amount of brown sugar that the recipe called for, and we didn't find it too sweet at all.  The sauce was delcious over rice.  (I only made one large chicken breast with this recipe for both of us to split.  If you're making more chicken, I would definitely at least double the amount of sauce.)

This recipe was very simple to make and it was a nice change from the usual humdrum chicken recipes.  I plan to make this again.

Welll liked by my family.  I did double the sauce ingredients except the sugar and the onion soup.  I used inexpensive chicken legs and they were tender and moist.  Will definitely make this recipe again.

This was really good, and even better the next day.  I loved the sauce, which I doubled (and am glad I did).  Kids and hubby ate this one up.  Will make again because it was easy and quick.

Very good & oh-so-easy. I made it low carb- using Brown Sugar Twin, Carb Options onion soup mix & LC catsup. Also- boneless chicken breasts- 1 1/2 lbs. & cooked for 45 minutes. Not salty at all.

After reading all the great reviews on this recipe I tried it. This was probably the worst recipe I have ever made. I dont know if I did something wrong because no one could get past the first bite.We ended up throwing it out and ordering pizza.

OH MY GOSH!  This recipe was SO YUMMY!  I have never left a review before, but felt I had to with this one to reassure everyone to FOR SURE make this.  Everyone loved it, would serve it without hesitation to any house guest.  I used chicken thighs.

Great recipe!!  I wasn't in a "hurry" - so I thinly sliced one green pepper and one red pepper and spread them in the baking dish first.  I used three large, boneless, skinless chicken breasts and baked, uncovered for 50 minutes.  I served over white rice.   If you feel the sauce is too salty - you could mix the sauce and peppers with a large amount of white rice - then serve that alongside the chicken.

This is a great recipe! The chicken really takes in the flavor of the sauce. I will definatly be making this again. And I can't wait to try the sauce on other things.

My family really enjoyed this dish! I think next time I will try it in the crockpot. It would also be a great to make for a potluck. I mixed all the ingredients ahead of time and let it sit in the bowl for about 1 hour before I poured it over the chicken. This really gives it the extra flavor.

I made several changes which probably did not help the overall recipe. I used Splenda instead of brown sugar to cut calories. I doubled all sauce ingredients except Onion soup mix and the onion was still overwelming to me. I could not even eat it. My husband thought it was ok.

I have made this with pork chops in the crockpot many, many times and it comes
out perfect every time.  Though the ingredients don't sound that great together,
they really are!  Try it!

Excellent.  My husband and 4 year old boy loved it!  And it was extremely easy to make.  One thing different I did was to remove the cover during the last five minutes and increased the temp to 425.  It made the outer layer of chicken a little 'crisper'.

I only eat dark meat if I have to.  This recipe was so good I went back for a second piece. 
I agree that the sauce needs to be doubled except for the onion soup mix. Also don't pack the brown sugar.

This is my go to recipe when I am running late, in a hurry or just don't know what to do with chicken.  I have no idea why anyone would think it was bland or boring. My family and on occasion company all love it, I serve it with steamed rice and a bright green vegetable.

The sauce taste like something between barbecue and sweet & sour sauce.  My mother thought it had an Italian flavor.  I found the sauce a bit overpowering, but gave it 4 stars for being so easy. My 4 kids did not like this dish very much:o(

5 out the 6 members in my family liked this. 1 teenager didn't care for it b/c of the onion mix.  I doubled the recipe and should not have added the second packet of onion soup. My 7 yr old said it was the "best chix he ever had in his life." I wouldn't go that far. The sauce didn't stick to the chix, so I thickened it w/ a little cornstarch mixed w/ water. I could see how the sauce could be used w/ pork. Remaining sauce can be mixed w/ cooked white or brown rice or served over potatoes. I'd consider it a "week night" way to dress up plain chix, but not something I'd serve to guests.

As many said this was truly very simple to put together at the last minute. I actually followed the suggestions of others and doubled the sauce and included onions and garlic under the chicken before baking it. I was a little disappointed because although the sauce was tasty, it really didn't soak into the drumsticks and thigh pieces even with an overnight marinade. I would season the chicken before adding the mixture next time. I will definitely try it again and make necessary changes. We ate this with Mashed potatoes...nothing to write home about though, like I thought...

I'm giving this 5 stars...the sauce was delicious and was so easy to make :) I did  add a little barbecue sauce to the ketchup and onion soup mixture and I omitted the brown sugar because the barbecue sauce contains brown sugar;) I also took the advice of others and placed the chicken drumsticks that I used for this on a bed of onions. I cooked it for 2 hours and it was fantastic! Really nice recipe to have on hand when you don't feel like going grocery shopping :) Thanks for sharing!!

I have been cooking for 40+ years, and I was extremely pleased with this recipe!  I had less than 2 hours to prepare a dinner for last-minute company (whom I had never met), and this was absolutely perfect.  I served it with an Italian oil and herb pasta and a Ceasar salad. I could only smile at the compliments!

Never used ketchup as a sauce base, but this was good. I added crushed garlic cloves and parsley. I also doubled the recipe according to other reviewer's suggestions. Overall a good, easy, and quick recipe for a weeknight.

This is a very good recipe and quite easy to make. I followed other people's suggestions: I doubled the sauce but only 1 pack of onion soup mix, put chicken on top of bed of onions and garlic and I added ground black pepper. The only suggestion I would make is to marinade the chicken overnight so the flavour would seep into the meat and not just stay on the skin. Next time, I will mix the ketchup with bbq sauce for an extra kick. This recipe is really quite good.

This was very good.  B/F thought it was a bit too sweet, thus the 4 stars.  I didn't add the brown sugar and I did line the bottom of the baking dish with thin sliced yellow onion and fresh sliced mushrooms.  Had 3 large bone-in chicken breasts, removed the skin and sprinkled with s/p then covered with the sauce.  I had to cook mine for about 1 hour 15 minutes but they were super juicy.  I have one breast left over so I will shred that up today and make a yummy salad for lunch.

This is a family favorite.  I usually reduce the ketchup to 1/4 cup, and add 1/4 BBQ sauce for a little extra punch.  The sauce is fantastic on ribs too!

I made a few small changes: First, I used chicken legs instead of a whole chicken cut into pieces. I doubled the sauce recipe and added 2 TSP of worcestershire sauce and 2 TBS of red wine vinegar. This added a little tang to the chicken so that the sweetness of the ketchup and brown sugar wasn't so over powering. My family LOVED it!!

This was pretty good. I thought by the smell of it that there was going to be too much of a ketchup taste, but it was actually very mild. My family likes to eat their chicken with ketchup anyways, so this was a treat for them. Even my 2 year old loved it. I may try to use 1/2 BBQ sauce and 1/2 ketchup next time just to try something new. But we will definitely have this again!!!
UPDATE: I just tried this again and maybe I did something different than the first time, but I hated it this time around. It was a very thick ketchup/onion coating that was kinda gross. I doubt I will try it again.

This was so good and EASY! I actually had everything on-hand (big plus for me). Picky toddler ate it up. It was good cold the next day too.

This was delicious.  We had no leftovers, which is a first in my house.  I used boneless chicken thighs as I had them on hand.  I doubled the sauce (except for brown sugar) and added a dash of worstershire sauce.  Served it with white rice and green beans.  My 3 boys devoured it.  Even my 2 year old had seconds.  Thank you for this easy and quick recipe.

I used cut up chicken with the skin on. It did not get crispy at all,after about 1 1/2 hrs in the oven,without any foil. As the other reviewers had suggested,use boneless,skinless breasts for this dish. I'm not a chicken skin eater,so the sauce was pretty much lost on this dish. The sauce was tasty,however,so I will most likely make it again. I added BBQ sauce and black pepper and some garlic powder.I also added more water than what was called for in the recipe,because the sauce just seemed too thick,and I wanted it to cover all the chicken. Overall good,just use the skinless chicken.

I thought this was excellent and so did my family. I doubled the sauce as per other recommendations, and it came out great. I did not cover the chicken as we like it crispy. Next time I will use just chicken breasts, and also, made rice to go with and it was PERFECT with the sauce...YUM!

The best oven made chicken I ever tasted.  My husband just loves it.  My husband's mom is an excellent cook and when I served this chicken dish - my husband complimented me by saying it was better than his Mom's.

This was very good, the chicken was juicy and tender. I really like this sauce, but hubby doesn't really like so much onion. I may cut the soup in half for less onion flavor.

This sauce was just like BBQ sauce. It had pretty good flavor. I won't make this again unless I go to make BBQ chicken and have run out of sauce in my pantry.

The flavours were good, but I'm not so sure about the "hurry" aspect of this recipe.  It wasn't exactly a super-quick recipe but worth trying.  I used chicken thighs and they were juicy and moist.

Not bad, but not great.  For some reason the sauce didn't break up very well once it was in the oven.  I had to continually add water to the baking dish while it was cooking to break the thickness of sauce on top of the chicken.  I MAY make again, but with a little less onion soup mix and a little more water.  I do have to say though it was VERY easy!

I made this with about 4 lbs. chicken thighs.  The resulting dish was very tasty (but very greasy).  I cooked it covered for 45 minutes, uncovered it and took out all the grease and baked it for 15 more minutes broiling for the last 5 to crisp up the skin.  I'll try next time with boneless skinless breasts to be able to use the sauce over rice.  The meat really does take on the flavor of the sauce.  It's an easy, yummy dinner!

This was very, very good, one I will make again and again. I think that the submitter should change the name though, because I don't think the "Hurry" part is really true. Meals I can make under 30 min. can be called that, but this one does take an hour to make.

This gets high marks for being easy. I used 4 nice-sized breasts. I found this to be a little salty (from the soup I guesss) and the 'gravy' a little watery. I will make this again. Next time I will half the soup (for less salty-ness) and maybe add some flour or wondra.

It was ok.  It is definitely easy to make. I'd probably only cook it again if I was in a pinch (I will probably always have these ingredients on hand) but wouldn't go out of my way to cook this one.

When you are done eating this dish, you will have to go to church and ask for forgiveness.  Sinfully good!! -- If you have extra sauce like I did (I didn't use enough chicken quarters), try it on your baked potato. -- Can't wait to make this one again!

I doctored this a bit. Took the skin off the legs. Used 1/2 can mushrooms and Vegetable soup mix instead of onion.  I also added a couple cloves of minced garlic!  After 45 min. I uncovered, turned and put under the broiler for the remaining 15 min.  The soup mix made a tasty gravy that we put on top of mashed potatoes.  Not a pretty supper, but tasty.  Not for company!

I got this recipe a long time ago but I am just now reviewing it. I love this recipe, as does my husband. He has been requesting at least once a week for the last 8 months. It's quick and easy and the chicken is always juicy and delicious. The flavor really gets inside the chicken and the extra sauce is great served over rice.

My kids loved it! I covered it and cooked it as described, I turned it once and poured
the sauce over it again - then I uncovered it and put it under the broiler! Delicious!

Gross!  This was terrible when I made it and even worse the next day.  My husband prides himself on eating leftovers so we don't waste anything, but after one bite, this went straight to the trash.

This recipe was FAST and EASY....but I wasn't crazy about the taste.  It was good,
and my husband liked it, but not a recipe that I would ask for if I was served this
dish.

So easy, fast and few ingredients!
Did make couple of changes though. Doubled sauce, reduced sugar (only 1/4 cup in doubled recipe),  slightly less onion soup mix (just over 1/2 package), and added 4 cloves of grated fresh garlic. Placed on bed of vegetables...onions, peppers, sliced carrots, mushrooms etc. May also put some cut up potatoes next time. Didn’t have to have vegetables but thought it would be nice addition and could make it a 1 dish meal!

This dish was extremely easy to make and used ingredients that were safe for a severe garlic allergy. However, it lacked flavor. It was a bit bland. My family felt the need to add extra store bought barbecue sauce to try to improve the flavor while I mixed it in with my rice and hot sauce to get some taste out of it.

This was so easy and so delicious.  I did cut up an onion and put in the bottom of the dish.  I seasoned the chicken before I put it on the onions and then did double the sauce but only 1 pack of soup mix and I baked it Uncovered for 60 minutes.  It was perfect.  I prepared it the night before and put it in the fridge and took it out an hour early and popped it in the oven to bake.  It will be a favorite.

Used it on some drumsticks, added some minced garlic, put some of the sauce under the skin as well, it was pretty good and definitely easy.

This is excellent! As others suggested I doubled everything except the sugar and soup mix. I poured it into a  baggie, added the chicken and let it marinate for about a hour.
Uncovered for the second 30 mins to crisp it up.

Prepared it as directed, added 1/2 Tbsp of garlic powder (didn't have fresh garlic available) and it was absolutely delicious! There was enough flavored juice left over to coat the chicken AND spoon over some rice, and that was without doubling the recipe for the sauce!  Will certainly be making this recipe often!

I've been making this for years and I've always loved it. Too bad it's taken straight out of a cookbook that I own and have used so much it's falling apart. Not even a change to it, even the name. Company's coming; Casseroles.

I actually change this recipe, though. I omit the water and add a tablespoon or two of apple cider or white vinegar. Makes it taste much better.

OMG this was so good we licked the pan!!  The only substitution I made was to use an 8oz can of tomato sauce in place of the ketchup, simply because I was out of ketchup (I know!!  How does that happen?!  I had no idea I was out!).  I also seasoned the chicken with a little salt and pepper before adding the sauce since I was using the tomato sauce in place of the ketchup and I was worried that might cause it to lack a little flavor it normally would have had.  Oh lordy was this tasty!!   Will absolutely, positively make again.  Thank you for the super yummy recipe!

This was exactly what I was looking for tonight - EASY, yet yummy. Lined the pan with foil and used two bone-in skinless breast halves, but all the sauce.  Per another reviewer's suggestion, did not cover, and cooked for an hour.  Tender and moist with minimal effort on my part.  Stuck a potato in the oven beside the pan - what could be easier?  Thanks for a great idea!

This was delicious. I also used boneless skinless instead and it did not take the full amount of time to bake since I defrosted the chicken first. I like to have a little extra sauce (so I just used a little less chicken) b/c I like to put it on top off egg noodles.

This recipe was ok but not memorable.  Tasted like ketchup with onion in it but the rice with the sauce made it better.  Would make twice the sauce to make it go further with the rice.  I also used chicken breast strips and I think a bigger breast would work better.

I'm allergic to MSG so I used 2 tbsp beef bouillion (with no msg) and 2 tbsp dried chopped onion instead of the onion soup mix. I also uncovered it for the last 15 minutes. Came out delicious. with just the right amount of sauce to pour over the rice. Even my picky-eating 3-yr-old loved it!

Excellent dish. I used 4 breasts & it turned out great! I would use the sauce as a BBQ sauce on other things...it was that good! I served it to company & everyone raved about it. I had to reprint the recipe for them!

I'd recommend trying chicken breasts, as suggested by others. I cooked cut up chicken pieces, doubled the sauce, also as recommended. It took a few extra minutes, after the chicken pieces were cooked, to extract the fat from the sauce. Breasts would give off less fat. The flavor of the sauce was delicious.

I liked this.  It DOES taste like sweet and sour chicken.  I cut back on both the sugar and onion soup so it wouldn't be so sweet/salty.  It had a nice flavor and my boneless chicken breast tenders came out VERY moist.  I threw some spinach in too to bake and it soaked up the flavor very nicely.  Easy and fast.

This recipe was very easy to make!  I did as several people suggested and doubled the sauce except for the soup mix.  It worked out great.  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts (which pretty much the only chicken I ever buy)and they were very tender.  I give the flavor a 4 because I am not a big fan of onion soup mix but the ketchup and brown sugar made it not so overpowering.  But it was definitely a 5 for being easy to put together!

This was super easy and quite good.  Very flavorful.  I used chicken tenders since it was what I had on hand, and didn't change any other parts of the recipe.  It was just a little too sweet for me (maybe not enough chicken compared to how much sauce was there?), but my husband loved it.  I should have served over rice, as others suggested, that would have been delish!

I think I solved the riddle about the name...maybe "Hurry" is a play on words for ketchup/catch up???  

Anyway, I was a bit skeptical about the dish, especially after I combined the ingredients for the sauce.  I'm not a big ketchup fan (small doses please) but I needed something quick.  I followed the recipe, except I used chicken breast, I only used 1/2 bag of onion soup mix and I seasoned the chicken with garlic salt and freshly ground pepper before placing them in the baking dish.  I baked it on 350 degrees for 35 minutes and served it over white rice.  When my husband first tasted it, he thought it was just okay.  But with the rice, and after savoring the flavor (it's quite flavorful!) he said that it was definitely a keeper.  I'd really only give it 3.5 stars but with his input, it was bumped up to a 4.  I think my hesitance had to do with the fact that I used ketchup and I'm not a huge fan of sweet and sour.  We'll make it again though, when I'm in a crunch.

This recipe cannot receive less than 4 stars because my 10 and 5 year olds LOVED it!  They told my husband "This is GREAT Dad!" and then he informed them that I (their mother!) made it..... they were shocked. :) I made a double recipe (had lots of chicken to use) and added onion (chopped big enough to pick out).  Oh - and I cooked the sauce a little before pouring over the chicken.

The only reason that I gave this 3*'s is because while it was cooking, all I could think of was meatloaf.  I will try this sauce again, but on meatloaf instead.

This was great and really easy.  I thought I had all the ingredients, but it turned out that I didn't have the onion soup mix, so I used ranch dressing mix instead.  It was good, but I'd really like to try it with the onion soup mix.  I did uncover it and put it under the broiler for a few minutes at the end to make the skin bubbly and crispy!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was very good and easy to make.
I was really in a hurry so I used boneless chicken breasts that I halved lengthwise to make them cook faster.  I greased the baking dish with butter put the chicken in and covered it with the sauce made exactly like the recipe.  I might add a dash of garlic powder next time but it's fine as is too.
I baked it 40 minutes at 350 and it came out perfect.
I'm sure this recipe would be great on ribs too and I'll use the sauce the next time I make boneless pork ribs in the oven or crockpot.

This recipe was outstanding! I slow roasted a whole chicken in the oven all day with this sauce on it. I also placed 3 garlic cloves in the cavity. It couldn't have been any better! The sauce was delish! I will be making this one again and again! Thanks a bunch for the super recipe!

I used boneless skinless breasts as that is what I had on hand.  Used sugar twin brown to cut down on calories, but not quite the 1/4 cup called for. I served it with potatoes, but my daughter has requested that I make again with rice...and she's the picky one. Thanks for the great recipe.

It was ok - nothing to write home about - but a bottle of Barbeque sauce tasted better.  My husband asked why I didn't just use it, and ended up dragging some out and dipping it into the sauce.  I won't be making this one again.

I added some minced garlic and baked uncovered for the last 10 minutes.  I didn't like this as well as my husband did.  I guess I expected it to be much better after reading all the other great reviews.  I don't think I'll be making this again unless hubby begs me to.  Sorry....

Great taste! I took off the chicken skin before putting on the sauce, the chicken does not dry out.

This is a great recipe.  My whole family loved it.
No leftovers. This is definitely a keeper. Can't wait to try on ribs. So easy....

This recipe was excellent to serve on chicken tenders and grill on electric grill machine. Very easy and quite popular with my family and guests.

I found this a bit too salty per the recipe.  I made it again, increasing the water to 1 cup and adding 1 cup of rice.

The onion soup mix was a bit too much and made it salty.

This was OK.  I expected more considering all the other reviews,  I may try the sauce as a grilling sauce next time but I wont do it this way again.

Hi,

It was a hit.  The kids were to busy eating to tell me how good it was.

We enjoyed this dish quite a bit. It was a tad sweet for our usual tastes, and I cooked the chicken only 45 minutes. I do plan to prepare this for my family again sometime.

really easy to make!  Even my husband who is a bit picky loved it.  Instead of 1 hr I baked it for 50 minutes - and it's very juicy.
