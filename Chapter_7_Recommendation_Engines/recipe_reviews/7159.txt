Modified for our own taste by using 1c flour, 1c whole wheat flour, 1c apple sauce (instead of ½ apple butter), and added ½c unsweetened coconut.  I also made two batches, one with 1c sugar and one with 1c Spenda as we wanted to see if there was a measurable difference in taste. Both batches were really marvelous!  Splenda seems to really do well as a sugar substitute when baking.  Took them to work thinking I would freeze any leftovers but couldn’t because there weren’t any.  A huge hit in the office although next time I will NOT use muffin liners.  Thanks for the delicious, low-fat, Weight Watcher friendly recipe!

These are fantastic!  Instead of grating the carrots and chopping the apple, I just ran it all through the food processor real quick.  And I used unsweetened applesauce instead of apple butter--much cheaper and also better for you.  Instead of making the topping of chopped nuts and wheat germ, I just added about 1/2 cup chopped nuts to the mix.  I also used baking papers instead of greasing the tins.  They turned out soooo good!  I will make these over and over again, for sure!

This recipe is the best!  I used 1c honey instead of the sugar, and used equal parts whole wheat flour and whole wheat pastry flour instead of the suggested amounts of flour.  I also used an egg substitute instead of eggs and soymilk to make the whole thing vegan - it still tasted superb!!!

I am not great at eating things good for me, but these were OUTSTANDING!  The only changes I made to the recipe was to substitute the oil and apple butter for 1C applesauce and increase the walnuts to 1/2C.  SUPER RECIPE, THANKS A LOT!

I needed a muffin that called for a lot of fruit since I had some of everything on hand and this fit the bill. Made these yesterday and have 3 left! I used 2 overripe bananas for the apple butter and forgot the wheat germ and nuts, but they are still terrific. Kids love them and my husband ate 4 in a sitting.

I made these for Christmas brunch and they were a big hit.  I could not find apple butter in the store, but substituted applesauce without a problem.  My 2-year-old loved them.  One reviewer complained that there wasn't alot of batter, but that is why I enjoyed them.

We love these muffins!  And who can tell they're good for you, too?!  Grating the carrots takes me a while--wish I had a food processor.  Hint: they freeze then toast up in the toaster oven good as new.  YUM!!!

I didn't have apple butter so I used applesauce.  The muffin were still very moist and very appetizing.

These muffins are the best! I made a few changes, not many. I did run the carrots and apple through the food processor as suggested in another review. I was making these for my son who can be picky and figured the less you see the better. I also pureed about 1/2 can of chick peas to add some protein to the recipe for him. You wouldn't even know they were there. I also used pecans and put them, as well as the wheat germ right into the batter instead of on top. I added orange zest and used craisins instead of raisins. They were phenomonal! I will definitely be making them again.

Delicious! I just made these following some of the suggestions of other users and they are great! I used 1 c. whole wheat flour and 1 c. bread flour, added 1/2 c. nuts, 1/2 c. apple sauce, and 1/2 c. homemade apple butter. To make the homemade apple butter I put 1 c. of applesauce on the stove with 1/8 c. brown sugar, 1/8 tsp. cinnamon, 1/8 tsp. pumpkin pie spice and 1/8 tsp. nutmeg. Cook the mixture on a low heat until it darkens, thickens, and reduces by about half. I also added in 1/2 c. of oatmeal to make it more heart healthy and added 1/2 tsp. more baking powder to compensate. Yum! Finally I can have muffins without guilt!

These are really good!  I just had one and I feel healthier already.  I made some minor changes in an effort to make them even more healthy and diet friendly, I used 1 c white flour and 1 cup whole wheat, 1/2 cup splenda and 1/2 cup honey instead of sugar, I had craisins on hand, so I used them instead of raisins, I omitted the oil and added 1 c of unsweetened apple sauce instead of 1/2 c apple butter and last but not least, I didn't bother peeling the apple, just cored it and chopped it up.  I was able to whittle this recipe down to 4 weight watchers points (for the points plus plan).  Yay!  What a great way to start the day, thank you!

These are really good (and def worth the increased prep work).  They are the only thing I have found that I can eat for breakfast and not be hungry until lunch (I toast them and add a little PB for extra protein).  Two recommendations: 1. if you are going to use more Whole wheat flour than the recipe says you should increase some liquid whether it be another egg white or some extra applesauce.  WW Flour has a tendency to be a little drier and needs the extra juice! 2. I put my raisins in the microwave submerged in water for about 1min40sec, then I drain them and add it to the liquid part of the recipe.  This makes them nice and plump! Seriously, great recipe~~

I didn't care for these muffins. There wasn't enough batter. The batter just bound together the fruit and veggies and didn't seem like a muffin.

I've thought about making these every time I look at the healthy cooking collection (which is almost every day) and am so glad I finally made them. They are outstanding!!! I added walnuts and pacans to the mix and baked for about 18 minutes. Used applesauce instead of the apple butter as suggested by other users. They came out nice and moist. I thought I had too much mix so I put some in a bread loaf baking pan and it turned into a nice small loaf.  Definitly sprinkle the toppings on, makes for a nice looking muffin. I will absolutely make these again and again.

What a fantastic muffin!  These seem to be pretty adaptable, too, as I made a few changes and had no problems.  I didn't have enough shredded carrot, so I did a combo of shredded carrot and zucchini (I also shredded the apple, since I already had the food processor out anyway).  I replaced the raisins with dried cranberries and substituted Splenda baking blend for the sugar.  I had every intention of using 1 whole egg and 2 egg whites, but the entire egg fell in when I was trying to separate, so I just used 2 whole eggs.  Finally, I left off the topping, since I'm not a huge fan of nuts and I didn't have the wheat germ.  Thanks for sharing.

Mighty tasty for a healthy muffin. Looks like many of us have the same tweek...sub applesauce for apple butter and oil. I also reduced the sugar to 1 cup and will decrease it again next time. For my topping I combined wheat germ, cinnamon, and a 1/4 tsp of nu-stevia. The kids had no idea there was wheat germ on them. Excellent recipe...thanks for sharing!

These were delicious! The only reason I gave them 4 stars is because they used processed sugar. I substituted the sugar for 1 cup light agave nectar. I used whole wheat flour instead of white flour. I also added ground flaxseed.

These turned out great.  I decreased the raisins and increased the topping just to suit my family's taste, but they would have been great if I'd followed the recipe exactly too.  
The recipe makes a large amount so I made 12 large muffins in a lined muffin tin as directed, then poured the rest of the batter in a mini muffin tin and skipped the nut topping for my 5 year old.  They were perfect for her!  I plan to send these in her lunch box once school starts.
I stored then in a container in the fridge and we ate them for several days.

Im so happy that these are good because they are a bit more work then I was expecting. I kept thinking "These better be good." They are great for us because we are up & out of the house early so these will be a good breakfast. I followed the recipe exactly. Yummy!

These are outstanding.  Perfect amount of batter to other ingredients, pretty healthy, and delicious.  I used a granny smith apple, and the tartness was just what I'd hoped for.  I thought one apple wouldn't be enough, but it was perfect.  This recipe made 6 giant muffins and 3 regular size ones (although it probably could have made 4 had I not filled the cups so full!)  I did bake for 30 minutes since the muffins were large, and they are great.  The only thing I will change is to add 1 cup instead of 1 1/4 cups of sugar next time.  They are just a smidgen too sweet for me.

Mixed the recipe exactly as written the first time and they were WONDERFUL!  So moist and rustic. My daughter made them for a fundraiser and they were a hit. Made mini-muffins the first time for sampling when collecting orders. Yum. When we filled the order w/ standard sized muffins (8 dozen, YIKES!), we did the following: cut the sugar back to 1 cup only (still PLENTY sweet);  soaked the raisins in warm apple juice for about an hour before mixing in. They turned out BEAUTIFULLY! It didn't hurt the feelings of anyone in our house when we were left with about 10 after filling all the orders. These are crazy-good! Just a note, they don't rise a whole lot so we found we could fill the muffin cups (we used the foil "papers") almost to the top without them overflowing. We used a 1/4 c. ice cream scoop and got about 15 muffins per recipe. This is a bit subjective and could change depending on the size apple you use (ours were about baseball size) and whether or not you soak your raisins like we did. Timesaving hint: use your food processor to do the carrots, especially if making multiple batches. If you don't prefer larger apple chunks, the food processor would work for those, too.

These are awesome!  I used 2 whole eggs instead of whites, all white flour, and apple sauce instead of apple butter.  I also omitted the wheat germ and walnuts, so this is highly adaptable to your own tastes and what you have on hand.  The outcome is such a delicious treat, moist, sweet, and I love knowing there is healthy stuff in there!  It was worth the effort of shredding the carrots and apples (I shredded the apples instead of dicing as my children are not fond of chuncks they can identify as healthy things!)

I made a huge batch of these for the staff at my son's school and they all loved them.  I used 1 cup of unsweetened apple sauce instead of the 1/2 cup apple butter and the 1/2 cup of oil.  I also added a few spoon fulls of flax seeds and wheat bran.  They were very moist and tasty...a great recipe=:)

I can't tell you how many, many times i've made this muffin! Each time, a bit different, sometimes adding in flax seeds for crunch, fresh blueberries when in season, sometimes grated zucchini, extra carrots, with apple, without. I'm telling you, nomatter how you tweak this recipe, it STILL ENDS UP FABULOUS!!  How is that possible?! lol.  Also, for healthier options, you really can cut the sugar in half and add in a bit of honey; as well as using all whole wheat flour instead of white flour and it turns out just as good just a bit heavier (which I don't mind!)

MY HUSBAND RAVES ABOUT THESE!!  He calls them his Muffins of Destruction and has shared them with all the guys at work and apparently I'm a little famous for my muffins.  Healthy, rounded, and delicious!  I make the recipe just as is!

Wow, these are great! I had this recipe sitting in my box for over 2 years thinking 'they couldn't be that good' I was totally wrong! These are fabulous! Instead of using raisins, I added 3/4 c walnuts (I don't like raisins:) Next time I'm going to dial down the sugar a smige, but they are GREAT the way they are-Thank you sooo much for sharing this recipe, my picky eater kiddos kept asking for more!

Delicious! Like other reviewers, I skipped apple butter and oil and used 1c. unsweetened apple sauce. I sprinkled crushed almonds for topping as that's what I had on hand. I also used eggbeaters instead of the eggs. Will freeze for easy grab-and-go breakfast.

Really good healthy muffins!  At first I was hesitant to make these muffins because typically, when you make a healthy muffin like this, they are gummy and rubbery.  Not the case with these muffins!  They were super tender and lightly sweet, which was perfect.  They weren't heavy or dry or gummy.  I also made some changes and used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup white whole wheat flour and substituted 1 cup honey in place of the sugar and applesauce for the apple butter.  I will make these again and again and feel good about putting these healthy snacks in my kids' lunchboxes!

These are delish!! I didn't have any apple butter so I just subsituted unsweetend applesauce. Next time I'd try adding even more applesauce and taking away some of the sugar, and dried cranberries are what we used rather than raisins (those were yummy). This is a GREAT recipe!

These were great! I used 1 cup white flour and 1 cup wheat flour and added an extra egg white. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and they were so good! They were moist and very addicting! I will definitely be making these again.

Great starter recipe! I made some changes though to boost the fiber and lower the fat and sugar. I added 1 cup of bran cereal (soaked in 1c of hot water to soften). Used only 1T oil. I used my homemade apple/pumpkin butter (made with Splenda), egg beaters, extra apple, craisins (I don't care for raisins), and used half whole wheat pastry flour and half white and used Splenda Sugar Blend. AMAZING! Will make these over and over! My family won't stay out of them!

This is one of my favorite muffin/bread recipes! They are very moist and tasty. This recipe only works for muffins though.  I tried to make a loaf and even after an hour hour the center did not bake entirely.

Okay, so I don't like to rate things when I change the recipe but I did do things just a smidgen different. I didn't have wheat germ I skipped it, but since it's so healthy I will add it next time. I didn't have apple butter so I skipped the oil and did apple sauce 3/4 cup. And, I only had a granny smith apple, that seemed to tart to me so I added a peach instead. I also added 3 whole eggs, which is less healthy, but I can't stand to waste good food. Because the peach is wetter I needed the full 20 minutes to bake. For healthy muffins these sure are good. So very good! Yummy, good! I will make these again, following exact next time. Doing it just as the recipes calls for could only make it better, as if that's possible.

Awesome!  I added some coconut, substituted 1 cup applesauce for the apple butter and oil, and mixed in the walnuts and wheat germ instead of putting them on top.  My boyfriend ate four in one sitting.

i added a bit of zucchini to the muffins and found that it tasted great. i found that if you dont press the nuts into the mix on the top that they will fall off of the top.

Very good.  I used homemade apple butter as well as applesauce in place of the oil.  I also halved the rasins, added some coconut and some cinnamon chips I hand left over.  Topped with slivered almonds.  Will make again.

If I could rate 6 stars for these muffins I would!  I split the flour 50/50 white/wheat.  Didn't have raisins, but added 1/2 cup unsweetened coconut and 1 cup chopped walnuts to the batter and used 1 cup applesauce in place of the apple butter and oil.  Luckily the recipe makes 18 regular muffins, because they go fast!

Used all whole wheat flour, instead white sugar, I used 1/2 cup agave (I don't care for it being too sweet), used a flax egg (1 tablespoon flaxseed meal with 3 tablespoon water) and yogurt butter instead of vegetable oil.  I don't feel guilty eating these 'cause of all the healthy ingredients in them.

These muffins are wonderful!!  I was intrigued by all of the healthy, hearty ingredients that were included, but was a little unsure of how it would all come together in muffin form.  Wow!  I was hooked with my first taste.  They are satisfying and delicious and I have made them several times already.  My husband loves them too!!

very good the first day. i ate 4 when they came out of the oven! i omitted the raisins, used 2 eggs instead of egg whites and the one egg (too much trouble). i didnt have apple butter so i used 1/2 cup apple sauce and 1/4 cup apple sauce in place of the veggie oil. didnt hav whole wheat flour so i used oatmeal instead, and omitted the walnuts and wheat germ. great recipe altogether but, with the carrots and such, it doesnt look too appetizing after day one. i also added a banana- be careful with adding the banana , b/c even though it tastes great it makes the muffins look undercooked even when its ready :] B/c it is a healthy recipe adn still tastes great, ill give it 4 stars instead of 3 1/2

Fabulous!!! I made these as mini muffins and the whole family loved them - I grated the apple and carrot, omitted raisins (our preference) and just used a basic brown sugar/oat topping instead of the wheat germ and nuts (wanted to keep them nut free so they could go to school for snacks) I loved them since my picky 2 year old loved them & she had no idea she was actually eating carrots & apples - yay!

After reading other reviews, I did the following: 1 c. AP flour 1 c. whole wheat flour 1 c. sugar 1 c. unsweetened applesauce (instead of oil and apple butter) soaked raisins in egg/vanilla/applesauce to puff them up I didn't have wheat germ or walnuts, so I left those out.  These muffins are AMAZING.  I was looking for a healthy snack/breakfast for my 18 month old who is super picky.  He LOVES these...and so do I!!  Very good with a little spreadable honey :)

I've been making these muffins weekly to have for breakfast or a snack. I use all whole wheat flour (2 cups) , and I use 1 cup brown sugar in place of the white sugar. I pour on the cinnamon and nutmeg because I love it.  When I've run out of apple butter, I've used the 3 eggs whole (instead of whites) and doubled the oil -- this makes it turn out fine (although I prefer the apple butter).  This makes a very thick batter, and I usually end up adding a dash or two of milk while I'm mixing it up -- probably due to my own impatience.  I'd like to eventually figure out the amounts I need to either make just 12 or 24 muffins ... I always seem to end up with 15-18 which either tacks on time or wastes batter.

Oh my gosh, delicious...I made these almost exactly as stated, except 1c all-purpose and 1c whole wheat flour, and didn't have any wheat germ.  The only problem I had was that the apple butter mixture didn't seem to be enough to moisten all of the dry ingredients, I stirred as best I could but there was some leftover flour.  Probably making it with 1c applesauce instead, like everyone else has suggested, would take care of this problem.  The batter seemed really really dense so I was nervous, I only got 12 muffins out of it, and it took much longer to bake than stated (maybe 30 minutes), but they came out FABULOUS.  I usually just make muffins for the boyfriend, I'm not a muffin eater myself, but I could eat these every day.  Used golden raisins, which was nice, and I LOVE the crunchy nuts on top.  Moist and tasty and healthy, what's not to love!

Fantastic muffins!!!! I used 1/2 wheat, 1/2 white flour, omitted raisons and mixed 1c walnuts in instead, used 2 whole eggs instead, added 3tb of flax seed, and added a bit of brown sugar to wheat germ for topping instead of walnuts.  So good! my whold family gobbled them, even my husband who usually is weird about "healthy" ingredients.

With applesauce, no oil, 1 c whole wheat and 1 c white flour, 2 eggs and 1 egg white, and reduced sugar slightly - these are good! I think the walnuts add a lot. I wouldn't give them 5 stars, but especially for a healthy treat, nice recipe.

Excellent recipe! The muffins are delicious and exactly what i was looking for. They are a little time consuming but well worth it. i added  about a tsp. of ground flax seed to the topping. Next time i may add a couple tsps. to the batter.  i like the extra boost to an already healthy morning treat. Thanks for sharing Jaclyn.

The perfect muffin - moist, delicious and nutritious and so easy to make!  Taking the advice of the other reviewers, I used 1/2 c apple sauce in lieu of apple butter and omitted the walnuts bec of allergies.  I had wheat germ but totally forgot to put it on, and they turned out just fine w/out it.  I'm going to use just 1c sugar next time as it was a smidgen too sweet for my taste.  Otherwise, this one is a definite keeper!

These are so good!  Even my VERY PICKY children liked them.  I did substitute applesauce for the apple butter and used oat flour instead of whole wheat flour.  (I didn't have the whole wheat on hand)  I didn't know if they were going to be moist because many "healthy" muffins are not but these are extremely moist!  Thanks for posting and all the reviews!

I am obsessed with these muffins! I too used mashed banana instead of apple butter, only 3/4 cup of sugar and blueberry infused cranaisins instead of regular raisins.

I have been making these muffins for over a year and I love love love them. A couple of suggestions: cut back on the sugar...if you have sweet apples and carrots its necessary. Try dried cherries instead of raisins. Add a cup of walnuts into batter. Try pumpkin instead of apple butter. My oven cooks uneven so i made 12 large muffins. the batter does not rise a great deal so there is no over flow. to accomodate the change, i to lowered the temp to 350 and cooked for 35-45 minutes.

Superb! I included 1/2cup oat as well. Mistakenly measured oil for 1/2cup, didn't use apple sauce at all, but used 1/4cup sour cream instead. Lightly mashed strawberries, and only used 1/2cup brown sugar. The result is DELIGHTFUL! 
Also picked up the best tip given by one of the reviewers: to only fold, not 'vigourously' stir. Thank you!

DELICIOUS! I used golden raisins and next time I will use canned pineapple instead of fresh apple. (a little too much crunch for my taste) I also used ripe bananas instead of apple butter as someone suggested. You could use a lot of different ingredients to suit your taste. (coconut, pecans, ground flax seed etc.) They kept well in the frig, as I like COLD sweets. They tasted better every day. Next time I would make them in the eve and refrig. overnight for better flavor.

These muffins are awesome as is.  I made a minor alteration to make pumpkin muffins and wanted to share.  I substituted 15 oz of pureed canned pumpkin for shredded carrots and substituted pumpkin butter for apple butter.  Then I reduced the sugar from 1 and 1/4 cups to just 1 cup.  I did have to increase the cooking time.  But they were the best pumpkin muffins I ever tasted.  By far the most moist; almost sponge cake like.  I also added ground nutmeg and clove.  I love these two spices so I probably added more than what most people would.

Such a great snack for the kids at school. We love this recipe. I use 1 cup applesauce instead of oil and apple butter. I make sure I use Pam on the muffin cups if I don't use oil otherwise they are virtually impossible to get out. I also add half an extra apple and crasins instead of raisins. YUM YUM YUM!

These are my husband's favorite muffins and every time I make them, people ask for the recipe. They keep well in the fridge for about a week. I do tweak them a bit: all WW flour, 3/4c brown sugar, applesauce instead of oil. Great recipe.

Was looking for a healthy baking alternative and LOVED these.  They're hearty and you can taste the apple and carrot!  I looked at a ton of the reviews and here's what I changed: 1) used 1/2 cup oats food processed so they were pretty fine 2) 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour and no white flour 3) used dried cranberries instead of raisins 4) used chopped almonds and put them in the batter 5) used a granny smith apple choppped with the peel on 6) used 3/4 cup light brown sugar (lightly packed) instead of any granulated 7) used 1 cup applesauce (no sugar added) 8) used 1 TBS vegetable oil not 1/4 cup 9) used 1/4 tsp allspice and 1/4 tsp nutmeg 10) did not use apple butter or wheat germ  Baked for about 13 minutes.  Delicious!  And I calculated that each muffin is 166 calories!

This is the first recipe I have rated since I started using this website 5 years ago. I made these a couple days ago and my picky 4 year old LOVED them, by the end of the day he had eaten 7! I love that they are healthy for you and are delicious. I did make a few changes though, I added ground flax seed for the omega-3's, 1 cup of applesauce instead of the oil and apple butter and added the wheat germ to the recipe instead of a topping. My son said I have to make these everyday.I'm glad I got him hooked on something nutritious! This is a keeper :)

These are excellent...I'll be grabbing one every day next week as my on-the-go breakfast!   My only changes were using all whole wheat flour, adding the walnuts to the flour mixture with the other fruit, and skipped the wheat germ.   I don't advise making on a rushed weekday morning unless you have a good food processor...these take a little prep time but are worth it!

These muffins are super yummy and nutritious, too! I did modify a few things. Based on the previous reviews, I used 2 cups whole wheat flour, used brown sugar instead of white and reduced it to 3/4 cup, only used 1 cup of grated carrots (that's all I had), substituted coconut for the raisins, used applesauce instead of apple butter, used mashed bananas instead of oil, and I added 1/3 cup flax seed. Mmmm. Good!

I shared this recipe with my mom, who since has had about 8 requests to share it with others.  Delicious and healthy!  In today's batch I used 1/2 cup of turbinado and 1/2 cup of pureed pineapple for sweetener instead of white sugar.  Not quite as sweet, but lots healthier.  I also frosted them with cream cheese frosting, and they are SOOO yummy!

These are delicious! I have made them a few ways, but each time they are still perfect with two eggs instead of the egg/egg white combination. The most recent batch was the best, in fact for me it rated a perfect score: added fresh grated ginger, reduced sugar to 1 C. (1/2 brown), subbed applesauce for the apple butter and all but one tbsp. of the canola oil (not vegetable oil). Added nuts (1/2 C.) and 1 tbsp wheat germ to mix- skipped topping. Have tried with raisins, but I prefer them without. Also good with cloves instead of ginger-and almonds substituted for walnuts, mixed in and sprinkled on top. Of course, the trick is to stir the mixture as little as possible at the end- if it's very dry (it should be really thick), I add a tiny bit more applesauce.  The batter usually divides nicely into 16 muffins. I spray the pans thoroughly with canola oil, adding water to the two empty cups after filling the others with batter, and the muffins pop right out. In my old electric oven they're ready in 15 minutes, which is still somehow way too long. Sweet (but not too sweet), tender, spicy and moist but hearty. Thanks, JACLYN!

These smelled delicious while baking and taste so yummy!  Used applesauce instead of apple butter and left out the nuts, but otherwise followed the directions.

For those of you who have juicers, this is a great recipe for the leftovers from juicing carrots. That's what inspired me to look for a carrot muffin recipe. I didn't want a cake and didn't want to have to make frosting, so this was perfect. I also substituted most of the oil for plain applesauce and used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar. I didn't have any wheat flour, but added some flax seed. Also, I didn't have walnuts for the topping, so I just added some raw sugar to the wheat germ. Everyone likes them! Oh, and for the tins, honestly I think it's easiest to spray with the "for baking" Pam spray. Zero problems getting them out.

WOW! These were wonderful. I made them into 6 jumbo muffins which took 30 - 35 minutes to bake. The prep work is time consuming but they are well worth the effort!

Delicious. I used all whole wheat flour, substituted 3/4 C. applesauce for the apple butter & oil, used 2 whole eggs instead of 1 egg & 2 whites. I recommend leaving the topping off, it's bland & will fall off anyways making a mess. I made jumbo muffins, cooked for 30 mins but my husband complained they were slightly underdone so I will cook them a few mins longer next time. I got 9 jumbo muffins out of the batter. Grating the carrots took forever, this recipe reminds me I need to buy a food processor. Thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe.  Used up a lot of organic carrots from our local CSA.  I used 1 cup honey and used homemade unsweetened applesauce instead of the apple butter.  They were amazing but I would not use the liners next time they stuck way too much.

If I could give this a 10 star rating, I would! I just used what I had on hand and as one reviewer said, it's a very forgiving recipe. I did 1 cup each whole wheat &white flour,  2 whole eggs,  applesauce instead of apple butter (though I'd like to try that), and 3/4 cup white sugar &1/2 cup brown) I only got 12 muffins, but I tend to make mine large (baked for 25 minutes).
Thank you for a delicious recipe!

These muffins are outstanding.  Like others, I used applesauce and they were very moist and delicious.  Took them to my tennis team match on a Saturday morning and received several compliments.  This recipe is a keeper!

Great muffin.  Very easy and fast to make; will make these on a regular basis for a healthy fast alternative breakfast / snack. I used applesauce in place of the apple butter and peaches in place of the apple (didn't have any apples).  Thank you for sharing this recipe

I have made these muffins many times now! I alternate between making these and the banana crumb (minus the crumb now) pretty much every week. Unfortunately, I have always tweaked the original recipe to my liking. I use 1C wheat flour and 1C all purpose. I use about 1C agave instead of sugar, add 1 teaspoon nutmeg, use 1C applesauce instead of butter, and add wheat germ, flax seed, and walnuts in the batter. They are great breakfast muffins!

Made a batch with 1 cup Splenda instead of sugar.  1 cup applesauce instead of applebutter.  Very good.

The second batch I was interrupted and forgot the sweetener completely.  They were still good.  Think the applesauce and fruit provided enough on their own.  Kids may not like them, but they will make a great (non-sweet) breakfast muffin for me.

Very good, I made a few changes on the second batch, I used egg beaters instead of eggs and used diced pears instead of the apple. I dropped the carrots and nuts and used a cup of honey instead of the sugar. They turned out great. As written its a hit, my tweaks just adjusted it for my family either way you wont go wrong.

Oh my! These are very, very good! My only substitution was to use 1TBSP pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon. I might decrease the sugar just a bit next time to see if I notice a difference (usually I don't!)

Every time I make these people ask for the recipe.  The only change I made was the addition of 3/4 cup shredded coconut.  An absolute favorite.  Freezes very well but rarely last long enough to freeze.  Great for an in-hand healthy breakfast on the go.

OMG! I always figured muffins were just muffins. These are so good I can barely write this without jumping up and getting another one. Except I am SO full. One of these is a meal in itself and filling. I don't change anything. Perfect as is.

GREAT RECIPE!  Moist, flavorful, nutritious and filling. The whole family likes them.  I may use a little less sugar next time, but that's just personal preference.  I used flax seed in place of the wheat germ.  Instead of 1 egg and 2 egg whites I used 2 eggs.  They came out great!!  This recipe is a keeper.

so delicious! left out the nuts and topping and replaced apple butter with apple sauce. I will definitely make these again soon (and try with less sugar- these were delicious so i figure a little less sugar might not hurt flavor and make them more healthful)

Yummy and very easily adjusted for taste.  I always half the sugar and add a bit more of the apple butter or apricot jam.  Besides that it is excellent as is and with more or less of whatever you love!

One of my favorite muffins!  Of course, I had to tweak it just a little bit.  I used half AP and half whole wheat flour, 2 whole eggs instead of the the egg whites, applesauce instead of the apple butter, and 1/2 the raisins to substitute the rest with coconut.  I didn't have any wheat germ, but I mixed 3 T flax seed and mixed in 1/4 chopped walnuts into the mix.  Yum!

I made a few alterations as recommended by other reviewers: 1 cup flour, 1 cup whole wheat flour, 3/4 cup brown sugar, 2 whole eggs, 1 cup applesauce (in place of apple butter) and added toasted wheat germ to batter. In addition, I added 1/2 c. puréed chickpeas (great suggestion by another reviewer- adds protein!) and 1/4 cup buttermilk, and mixed in about 1/2 c toasted sunflower seeds instead of nuts. They turned out just fine, and will be used for quick breakfasts and lunch snacks when school starts!

Great healthy muffin!  I too used two whole eggs, substituted apple sauce for apple butter, used 1 c. each flour, reduced the sugar to 1 c. and reduced the raisins to 1/2 c.  Put the walnuts in the mix and omitted the wheat germ.  Will definately add this to my muffin rotation!

I find that the "healthy" whole wheat muffins tend to be flavorless and so dense that you could use them to cosh someone, but these had a really great light texture and a ton of flavor. My toddler went crazy for them.  I did a couple of minor modifications -- I did half apple butter and half applesauce. I also added some pumpkin pie spices, like ginger and nutmeg. I used butter instead of oil. I left out the wheat germ but I put in a handful of ground flaxseed.  I also put some nuts into the batter. The batter looked a little dry at the end, so I added some extra applesauce. Then I sprinkled a pinch of sugar, some whole flax seeds and some chopped nuts on the top. So good. This recipe is definitely a keeper. I feel like you could easily add lots of other types of fruits or nuts you have on hand.

I used unsweetened applesauce so I didn't cut back on the sugar like some reviewers advised, and it was way too sweet. My raisins (Maid raisins) were pretty sweet by themselves, so it added even more sweetness to the muffins. There was also way too much cinnamon, next time I'll reduce it or omit it altogether. With so many ingredients, it was really a flavor overdose (in a bad way). I used a whole egg instead of 2 egg whites, and used around 1-2tsp less oil, but the muffins were still too greasy to the touch even after 3 days. Taste-wise they were okay. The texture was fairly nice though, very moist. They also had a strong cinnamon aftertaste, which I hate.

Sooo yum!  Maybe my new fave!!!  Doubled recipe made 12 large, and 48 minis.  My changes for double: subed br sugar, used all ww flour, used less oil, 1.5 cups applesauce (for 1 c apple butter), added 1 cup 9-grain, and extra flax seeds, skipped topping, and used food processor to chop apple & carrots.  (seems like a lot of changes, but I change these on all recipes!)

I followed another reviewer's suggestion of 1 C. honey for the sugar, which worked great! Also, I did not have apple butter and trying to get away from veg. oil, so I used (1) can of pumpkin for the both. They turned out very moist and for the most part, they are very healthy. YUMMY! Thankful for a quick grab & go breakfast that is good for you.

Yum!  We got 24 regular sized muffins out of this.  Used unsweetned applesauce (1C) instead of apple butter.  Added the walnuts and wheat germ right in the batter.  To save time - bought a bag of pre-shredded carrots at Trader Joe's - worked great.  Family loves these!

Very good recipe. My two year old devoured. As others suggested I used splenda instead of sugar. Also replaced oil and apple butter with 1 cup of applesauce. I added 1/2 c coconut. I used 1 1/4 c flour and 3/4 c whole wheat flour. I made this with the full cup of raisins like the recipe called for but I really don't like raisins that much so next time I'll decrease the raisins and increase the apples.

Loved this!  I didn't have apple butter, so just used apple sauce and use cran-raisins instead of raisins, and I added about 1/4 brown sugar w/ the topping.  My 8 year old said there was no way she was going to each these, when she way me preparing them.  After they were out of the oven, she came running over "you have to try these - they are so good" Thank you!

Super duper yummy!!  I went on a search to use 'All Day Apple Butter' that I had made (from AR of course) and found this one!  I love making muffins and loaves - all of these ingredients in this recipe appeal to me.  I opted to grate my apple along with my carrot and decided to cut down the sugar - only used 1/2 cup mainly due to the apple butter having a good amount of sweetness.  I didn't think that much sugar was required - I was right!  These were so yummy :)  I also had to leave out the walnut/wheat germ topping, primarily because I can't send them to school with my boys if they have nuts (and was out of the wheat germ!!).  I did add about 1/4 cup of ground flax to the batter as well since I left out the wheat germ.  Excellent muffins!

Many changes to make healthier. Awesome flavor. Some, who do not eat low fat baked goods, may think the texture slightly gummy, but we enjoyed a lot! 1/2 whole wheat/1/2 regular flour. Subbed apple butter w/sweet potato (didn't have). Subbed all oil w/applesauce. Subbed half of sugar w/agave nectar (decrease to 2/3 of sugar amt in recipe). Only half the raisins because I ran out. Seemed like plenty though. Think you can mess around w/this recipe in several ways w/out screwing up too badly. Delicious and pretty healthy!

Picky-eater 2 Yr Old Son APPROVED! 

I replaced raisins with dried cranberries (husband's preference) and apple butter with unsweetened apple sauce (on hand).  I did not make the nut topping but included wheat germ within muffin and reduced sugar, omited salt, etc.  My intention was to freeze the batch but I kept 3 at room temp.  My son not only tried one but ate the whole thing (minus the cranberries he picked out).  AMAZING as he will NOT eat banana or other muffins (yet loves bananas), cupcakes or even his own birthday cake.  I made a healthy version so I don't feel guilty about sugar etc content to use muffin as part of his lunch.  Freezes well and packs easy for travel or babysitter.  Husband & I have yet to try them but plan to take frozen ones to work for quick snack.

I will continue to experiment with variations but am thrilled my son liked them.  I did not even expect him to try a piece.  He'd usually stare at the food then hold it close to his mouth and say "no thanks mom, I eat yogurt or fruit" and wait to see what I offer.  He rarely eats beyond pancakes, waffles, yogurt, fruit, pasta w/ homemade sauce, broth or tomato based soups. 
 Thanks, Jaclyn!

I followed the recipe exactly and think the muffins are fantastic.  I did have to pull them out a few minutes early, but that is my oven.  While the taste and texture are perfect as is, I may play around with this a little bit... only to try to skinny it up a little bit.  But thank you.... these are great and MY KIDS LOVE THEM!

Wow! These are seriously the best muffins I make. I make them healthier by using all whole wheat flour, sucanat instead of sugar (Sucanat is very nutritious...FYI sucanat is sugar BEFORE they process it, therefore it has tons of good stuff for our bodies!), all applesauce instead of oil and apple butter, leave out the walnuts (we just prefer no nuts in our muffins), and 2 whole eggs (we use brown eggs with lots of omega3s). Try these!!! I took them to a women's brunch one weekend and got rave reviews. My husband's family loves them too!

These muffins are fabulous! I used more whole wheat flour than white, substituted applesauce for apple butter, olive oil for veg oil, and craisins for raisins because of a picky 4 year old, and they are so delicious! I'll definitely make a double batch next time. These will go fast. Thanks for the great recipe!

These were FABULOUS!  As many others did, I used 1 cup of whole wheat and 1 cup of all purpose flour.  I also reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup.  I was afraid to use 1 tablespoon of vanilla, figuring it was a typo, so I only used 1 1/2 teaspooons.  I did notice a bit of a bitter aftertaste, so I think it's meant to read 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  They were so good! (other than the slight bitterness, presumably from the vanilla)  I didn't have wheat germ, so I just sprinkled the nuts on, but probably could have used more and mixed them in as others have suggested.

This is the second time I've made these muffins and I've made a few changes. I use 1c brown sugar, apple sauce instead of butter, nutmeg with the cinnamon and I added a banana to the mix! Really great muffins.

Seriously, these muffins are awesome.  I have been making them every weekend since the recipe came to my e-mail inbox.  The more fruit/veg you add, the better these muffins are.  I use 2 carrots, 2 apples, and 1 zucchini (I omit the raisins).  I also never have apple butter, so I use unsweetened applesauce, and just 2 eggs rather than egg whites plus an egg.  I also put blanched slivered almonds on top with the wheat germ, and add 1T of ground flax into the muffin mixture.  Good muffins...

These are definitely my favorite muffins! I used equal parts all-purpose flour and wheat flour and didn't notice a difference from the first time I made these following the recipe exactly. I also omitted the wheat germ and just topped my muffins with chopped walnuts. I will continue to make these!

This is heaven in a muffin cup!  YUMMMMY!  I am having a hard time keeping my hands off of them.  Instead of using 1 1/2 white flour and 1/2 c wheat flour, I used 1 cup if each.  Next time I will probably use even more wheat flour.  Also, I used matchstick carrots instead of grating them.  Works perfect, saves time, and it's a little less clean up!  GREAT recipe--I will use it for years to come.

Without a doubt, my favorite muffin.  I used all applesauce instead of oil or apple butter.  I added some shredded zucchini, shredded granny smith apple, and shredded carrots.  I also used Splenda baking blend instead of the sugar.  They stayed moist in the container for almost a week.  What a great mid-morning snack with my chai!

I absolutely LOVE these!  The food processor makes quick work of the carrots and apples.  Nutrition in disguise.  They get more moist the longer they sit.  I also keep some in the freezer.

Well, I hate carrots but this was very acceptable way for me to eat them. My husband and kids couldn't get enough of those muffins. The only change I made (in a second batch) was shredding carrots instead of grating, less work but tastes the same. Higly recommended recipe!

I'd give this 5 stars, but I messed with it and dislike overrating a recipe that was clearly not the original recipe.  That being said, the muffins I made using this recipe as a base are FABULOUS!  Here are my changes: switched the flour quantities - 1 1/2 c wheat & 1/2 c white, lowered the sugar to 3/4 c and used brown sugar (next time will use raw), cranberries instead of raisins (may try dried cherries next time), 3/4 c apple sauce instead of the 1/2 c apple butter, kept the oil (used olive oil) at 1/4 c since my SIL said her batches with lower oil kept sticking, added 4 T flax, and 1/2 c Bob's Red Mill bran cereal mix.  Didn't do the wheat germ and walnuts - just didn't have 'em.  Next time I will buy full size carrots to use as grating baby carrots is NOT for the fainthearted.  :)  GREAT MUFFINS!  I foresee them frequenting our future.

These were awesome!  I chopped up some baby carrots and put them in my magic bullet with some water.  I then strained the water out- I did the same thing with the apple.  This was much easier than grating.  They turned out great!!  I will make these again and again.

I loved these muffins!!!  I used walnuts inside the batter and used whole wheat flour only as well as flaxseed instead of wheat germ.  They turned out great!  I couldn't stop eating them.  I've made several batches of these muffins and all have been great.  I make tiny alterations each time usually.  These muffins are great with pears as well.  I think golden raisins are much better than regular also!

Oh, my goodness!!!  I can't believe how yummy these are!  I made some changes for my kiddo--blueberries (maybe 1.5 cups) instead of raisins, and no nuts.  I didn't have any wheat germ, but I'd like to try that next time.  I used applesauce instead of the apple butter, too.  I also followed another reviewer's suggestion and used the food processor for the carrots and apple.  We both LOVE them!!!  Thanks for this great recipe.

I make these ALL the time! These are awesome(and the nuts keeps my boyfriend away so I don't have to worry about him sneaking them)   I do make a few changes though to make them healthier. I use 1-1/2 c whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup white flour, 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown, omit raisins - i put in slivered almonds in, instead.. I use 1 c apple sauce for the apple butter, a sprinkle of dried cranberries and add 1/2 c ground flaxseed. **make sure the apple is tart like a granny smith for the flavor! it makes a big difference** Soon i want to try it with pumpkin puree rather than apple sauce.. :)

These are delicious. Using other reviewers suggestions, I used 1 cup of flour, 1 cup of whole wheat flour, 1 cup of apple sauce (instead of ½ of apple butter) and 1 cup of Splenda. I also added a banana, but wish I had mashed it first better before adding it. I baked it for 15, but I think it needed a few more minutes. Overall, amazing.

Excellent! I made some changes but they wouldn't drastically change the recipe. Half wheat/all purpose, half raisins/craisins, 1 c applesauce for butter and oil, 1 c splenda and 1/4 c brown sugar. No walnuts. 1 large carrot yields 1 c shredded. It was very dry so I had to add like 1/4 cup buttermilk at the end.

I have made this recipe many times & it's so good! My daughter loves them & I am happy to know she is getting a healthy snack. I never have apple butter so I just use regular butter. Also, I just skip the wheat germ because I don't keep that in the pantry either.

Absolutely the best, very moist, and oh so flavorful. My husband recently requested these is place of a birthday cake. I use spelt flour, cut the sugar to 1c, add 1/2c chopped sunflower seeds and about 3Tbsp of flax seed meal, and a mixture of dried fruit, instead of all raisins

These were wonderful and beyond my expectations!  I was worried about the way the carrots would cook, seemed like a lot.  I made these to get some healthy stuff in my toddler son and he loved them!  He called them cookies and I didn't tell him otherwise!  I shredded the apple in my food processor rather than chopping it (easy) and I didn't peel it.  I did have to pick a couple of larger pieces of peel out, but otherwise it worked great.  Gets more fiber in!  I also had to bake them a full 20 minutes.  These do take some time to make, but I'm sure I will be making them again.  Use the apple butter if you can find it (jam/jelly aisle), it gives it a yummy "spiced" flavor.  Thank you Jack!

I've made these muffins several times now, each time to share with friends or colleagues. They are always well received and gone in no time. I've consistently cut the sugar by 1/4c and no one's complained.

Made as written
Wow- I don't often think that many recipes are worthy of 5 stars because they generally require so much tweaking but this one EXACTLY as it's written is superb! I finally got around to making these last night for overnight guests to have this morning and these muffins are both beautiful and delicious. The only thing I didn't have was apple butter so used apple sauce and that worked just fine. I usually would have done all the chopping in a food processor but so glad I didn't. Grating the carrots with a box grater resulted in a dryer less pulverized chop which added to the lovely texture- I diced the apple (a mediumish apple about 5 oz) about the same size as the raisins resulting in each muffin having distinguishable apple bites- (chopping too small will cause the apple to disappear) and the apple bites were part of what I liked best.  Mixing /coating the apple, carrots and raisins in the flour first helps keep all the goodies from sinking to the bottom of the muffins- don't skip this step. Hand mix only- just until moist- don't over mix and you'll have a muffin that has your family and guests begging for more!  Thank you so much for a great recipe!

A good recipe that is very versatile according to ones taste and preferences as indicated by the reviews.  I also made changes. Used cranraisins instead of raisins, subbed 1/2 cup honey for the sugar (far too much sugar in original) and home made applesauce (no sugar) for apple butter, oatmeal for the wheat flour, reduced carrots to 1 cup and increased apples (diced) to 2 cups. Used cup liners, turned out great, very moist, lots of flavor and healthy. The second time I made them I cut the apples back to 1 cup and added 1 cup of raspberries. WOW, a nice change.

My family loved this recipe! I love the adaptability of it, for instance, I did not have any apples on hand, but chopped up 1 cup overripe strawberries, 1/2 an orange, then added 3/4c blueberries, then the grated carrots. I also added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp of cloves, 1/2 tsp of ginger for additional spice. I used more wheat flour than white flour (I just reversed the measurements). I only used 1 cup of sugar and applesauce instead of apple butter. For the topping, I did not have wheat germ, but ground flaxseed, so I mixed flaxseed w/cinnamon and smidge of brown sugar w/the chopped walnuts! My three kids each ate 3 of these! I think next time, I will incorporate chia seeds for some added protein into the mix. Thanks for a great start to our hectic morning.

These are great!  My six year old who refuses to eat any carrots ate these happily without being any wiser.  I did pulse the grated carrots in the food processor first to decrease the chance they would be recognized!  I do replace 1 TBSP oil with 3 TBSP milled flax seed (then use 3 TBSP canola oil instead of the 1/4 cup).  I have used both pumpkin and applesauce and the substitute for apple butter since we never have it and either work great.  I have also used honey for at least 1/2 of the sugar and that works great too.  These seem to be very forgiving.

good tasting muffin and love all the nutrition packed in.  Great "on-the-go" breakfast.  while the taste was fabulous as written, for the sake of my waistline I may use less sugar next time.  A tad more labor intensive than some other muffin recipes I frequent but a solid go to breakfast muffin recipe that seems to pack in more nutrients than most.

These came out deliciously!  I used the food processor to chop everything.  I used applesauce instead of the oil and apple butter.  I made them a week ago, and they're still incredibly moist.  My friends loved them, too.

This was a great base. I tweaked it a lot to my taste, I used half whole wheat flour, brown sugar instead of white, 3 eggs, 3/4 cup of applesauce instead of the apple butter and oil, added 1/2 cup nuts to the batter, added about a cup of dried cranberries and, probably the best addition was the zest and juice of two oranges. They are awesome muffins! I did add a small can of crushed pineapple, but that isn't something I would do again, it just didn't seem to add anything to the taste. The orange juice made the batter very wet and I thought it might be a problem, but they baked up just fine and they are not dry and crumbly. This is a keeper!

I love these.  I didn't have wheat flour so I used all white.  I couldn't find wheat germ, but had wheat bran.  To compensate for the lack of wheat in my flour, I doubled the amount of wheat bran the recipe called for.  I used 2 full eggs and 1 egg white.  Added in 2 smashed bananas also.  I also added in 1/2 cup oatmeal. Otherwise everthing else was as written.  These taste like carrot cake.

Followed the recipe almost completely.  The only adjustment made was I put the walnuts within the mixture vs. on top.  Muffins were awesome.  I will definitely be making more in the near future.

Excellent recipe, very forgiving and adaptable!  I used julienned carrots b/c I had them on hand and too lazy to grate more ... no apple butter, used apple sauce and upped the cinnamon by half tsp, added good sprinkling of nutmeg, and also substituted Splenda for white sugar.  YUMMY

Moist and delicious. Slightly sweet (used less sugar). Sprinkled brown sugar and milled flax seed on top of muffins prior to baking. Add this one to your recipe box. Easy.

I will definitely be making these again.  Trimmed some calories by usine Splenda instead of sugar, and 1 c applesauce instead of the apple butter.  Used Egg Beaters, and 1/2 c raisins and 1/2 c. craisins.  Delicious!!!

Very tasty, healthy muffin. I will not put the toasted wheat germ on top again. It just fell off after these were done. I used shredded carrots that I chopped up. I loved the texture of them. My 2, 4, and 6 year olds loved these.

5 stars as far as healthy muffins go... :)  I used all whole wheat white flour, 1 c. honey-no sugar, 2 tsp. cinnamon, 2 whole eggs instead of mixing whole and whites (cause i'm lazy), 1/2 pumpkin puree instead of apple butter, craisins instead of raisins, and 1/4 cup flax seed in place of 2 of the tbsp of oil.  Next time I'm going to take out all the oil and use applesauce instead.  They were still great muffins.  My 3 and 1 year old ate 2 a piece when they first came out of the oven (the muffins that is, my sons were not in the oven).  I love that there's nothing in these that makes me hold back from giving them to my kids.

Sweet enough with only 3/4 cup honey instead of all of that sugar, and the golden raisins I substituted did the trick! I had to use unbleached flour and sprinkled chopped walnuts on top as I didn't have whole wheat flour or wheat germ on hand.

A lot of work for some boring muffins.  I had a muffin by the same name in a nearby coffee shop three days ago.  Their muffin was 10 times better than this one.  I won't be saving the recipe.  It would be better if the walnuts were mixed in.  I didn't like the dry wheat germ on top.

Yum! My kids had fun helping and the whole family loved these muffins! I used only 1/4 cup of sugar and pumpkin butter instead of apple butter (it was what I had in the fridge) and it turned out delicious! The raisins and apples gave the muffin just enough sweetness.

Just made these for the first time and I am already sorry I didn't make a double batch as these are not going to stay around long.  Like many other reviewers, I skipped the apple butter and instead used a cup of homemade applesauce.  Also, I used half of the sugar and didn't miss it at all.  Yummy and healthy!

These are SOOO yummy!!  And I can send one as a "dessert" in my 4-year-old's lunch.  To her, its shaped like a cupcake and tastes quite yummy...so its "dessert"!  (Except that I know it has wheat flour, apples, lots of carrots, walnuts, and wheat germ!)  Definitely a win-win!  THANK YOU FOR THIS RECIPE!  :)

I LOVE these muffins and have made them several times. The problem is they're almost TOO good! I could probably eat all of them myself! The only change I make is to make them a little larger then I will only eat one at a time instead of 2 (or 3 or more!) I haven't made any other changes but I might experiment a bit just to see what I can do with them!
UPDATE: I made these today and my tweaks were to that I used 2 Granny Smith Apples that I did NOT peel and I shredded them like the carrots in the food processor. To compensate for the extra moisture I used 1 cup of wheat flour and only used 1 cup of sugar. Also as suggested, I plumped the raisins in some water in the microwave before adding them. I don't use the topping on mine, I never have wheat germ or walnuts around. Now if I can just not sit here and eat them all...

These are delicious muffins! I adapted the recipe a bit, to use what I had available. I only used white flour, 2 whole eggs instead of 1 egg + 2 egg whites, applesauce instead of apple butter, and I used less sugar than it was called for (about 1/4 cup less, next time I'll reduce the sugar by 1/2 cup ), since I only used apples, not carrots, and my apples were quite sweet. I used toasted almonds instead of walnuts, and put them directly in the dough with the wheat germ. They came out beautiful, tops crunchy, inside soft and light. A keeper! Next time I'll use oats to replace part of the flour for added nutritional value.

Great recipe... Would have given 5 stars but I had to swap the butter and oil for applesauce and I used all WW flour. These were so good, we made them with zucchini and blackberries. My 12 year old son loved them. They were amazing, I can't wait to share them with my gym buddies in the morning! P.S. my son these are a great desert!!! I am adding this because now I have made these with carrot, rasins and apple and we did not like these at all but they were so moist and amazing with zucchini and blackberries!!!

I just made these last night and it was super easy.  I made a few  changes: 1) i used only 1 cup of sugar, 2) i used only all purpose flour, 3) i added about 3/4 cup of french vanilla yogurt.  They came out great and i brought them into work this morning and they are a big hit.  I will be making these again for sure.

I loved these!  My children found them a bit too healthy tasting, but they still ate them.  I substituted brown sugar for white and I think it gave them a richer flavor.  Moist and hearty.

Yum! Ditto to everything all the other reviewers have said! This recipe makes tasty, filling, nutritious muffins for any time of day.  I made the following modifications which others may find helpful: 1) used 1 mashed ripe banana instead of egg 2) used 1/2 c skim milk instead of egg whites, as recommended by another reviewer and 3) live outside the US right now with no access to applesauce or apple butter, so I used pumpkin! Mine was fresh, roasted, but I think any sort of pumpkin butter, pumpkin puree, etc will give you the taste and consistency you are looking for. Wouldn't hurt to add cloves, nutmeg, and allspice for a little more zing.   My only tiny recommendation for improving this recipe is reducing the number of raisins. I like raisins but I think 1/2 to 3/4 a cup would have sufficed.

I made these in paper liners because I'm taking them on an airplane but the liners were a big mistake. Hard to remove! Used honey and applesauce, no sugar.  Next time, I'm putting the wheat germ and walnuts in the mix instead of on top so they don't come off. Fabulous flavor.  My husband loved them!

o-m-g..... when i tasted the batter when i was baking these, I almost DIED.. LITERALLY... IT WAS THAT GOOD... JUST THE BATTER!!!!! IT was the most delightful DELICIOUS batter EVER! So then I baked them (for my grandma for Christmas) I couldn't find apple butter for less then 8 dollars a jar around here, so I ended up using exact amount of apple sauce instead. It was just perfect! They were a HUGE HIT... And the whole batch got eaten by mom and grandma after like a week!!! And they requested more! A PERFECT recipe!

AMAZING!!! I am simply ecstatic about the way this turned out! I am a bit of a health nut, so I substituted one cup of honey for the white sugar and used one cup each of all-purpose flour and whole wheat flour. These muffins received great reviews from all who tried them. Thank you!

These are the best muffins ever!  My picky husband, family, and neighbors love them!  They freeze well, travel well, and are almost just as good several days later as they are fresh out of the oven.  I make mine with applesauce instead of apple butter, to cut down a bit on the sweetness, and I go easy on the sugar.  I also a sprinkle of flax seed, and I mix the wheat germ and walnuts right into the batter, rather than sprinkling on the top.  Store leftovers in the fridge, not on counter, so the fruit doesn't end up turning and giving them a sour smell and taste, if they last that long!

This is an amazing and easy recipe!  I did not have any whole wheat flour, so I substituted an extra 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour instead.  Also, I used a mashed banana for the whole egg and 1/2 cup of milk instead of the 2 egg whites.  The muffins needed to cook for 20 minutes, but they came out moist and delicious!

These muffins are so delicious you almost forget they are healthy! The first time, we did the recipe EXACTLY & they turned out beautifully.  The 2nd time, my husband did 50% wheat flour/ 50% all purpose and substituted applesauce for the apple butter to make it even healthier.  They didn't turn out well. :(  I think it was the applesauce, not the difference in wheat flour that did it.  That was just our experience though.  Others seem to have done the applesauce substitute just fine!  I will say, it definitely takes more than the 15 minutes prep time advertised for these.  It's more like 30 minutes prep time.

These are super yummy! I made a few changes to suit my taste & what I have on hand. I used equal parts all purpose & spelt flower (a variation of wheat flower); I cut the sugar back by 1/2; and I used a mixture of applesauce & apple butter and cut down on the vegetable oil just to make it a bit healthier. They were still pretty sweet though, I may cut the sugar down even more next time.

Excellent recipe! The only changes I made was to put 1 cup AP flour, 1 cup whole wheat flour - and also omit the apple butter and oil and substitute applesauce instead. My boyfriend devoured these muffins, we both loved them. Not too sweet and a great breakfast treat!

I think these are wonderful! With a few adjustments they can be healthy too. I used 1 1/2 cups whole-wheat flour and 1/2 cup of milled flax seed. I added oats to mine as well. I also used 1/2 cup of stevia and 1/4 cup of brown sugar in place of the white sugar.  I didn't use any egg yolk and reduced the oil to about 2 tablespoons.  They were amazing! I have made them several times now and we never get sick of them!

These were sooo good! It's especially nice that it's full of lots of good things for you. In place of the oil I used applesauce, with the 1/2 c. spiced apple butter. Great flavor and texture, moist and filling. I mixed in the walnuts and left out the wheat germ. Next time I may either use all applesauce (no apple butter) or cut down the sugar a bit since they're a tad sweet for my taste. Will be making this again for sure!

Sub a peach instead of an apple!  It becomes so much moister.  Since the peach flavor is also stronger, you can add more healthy items like ground flax seed (which usually tastes like grass) or wheat germ without deterring from the taste!  I also used cranberries instead of raisins and toasted some almonds to go on top.  The crunch is worth it.   I will definitely make again!

Wow!  I love these.  I was looking for a way to use up some carrots.  I made the following alterations:  used all white flour (b/c that's all I had), reduced sugar to 1 cup, used 2 whole eggs (instead of 1 egg + 2 whites), subbed applesauce for apple butter, omitted walnuts.  Still giving 5 stars, b/c my revisions were due to availability and personal preference.  The recipe, I'm sure is OUTSTANDING as written.

This is a very good recipe.   My own adaptation included maple syrup instead of sugar, all whole wheat flour, dried cranberries, and I made 12 larger muffins instead of 18 which came out to 235 calories each. Each muffin includes 60% of the daily recommendation of Vitamin A.   Dry Ingredients: * 2.25 cups whole wheat flour * 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon * 1 tsp nutmeg * 2 teaspoons baking powder * 1/2 teaspoon baking soda * 1/2 teaspoon salt  Wet Ingredients: * .75 cup maple syrup * 2 cups grated carrots * 2 small apples - peeled, cored, and chopped * 1 cup dried cranberries * 2 eggs or equivalent (I used egg replacer) * 1/2 cup apple sauce * 1/4 cup grapeseed oil (or vegetable oil) * 1 tablespoon vanilla extract  Topping: * 2 tablespoons chopped walnuts * 2 tablespoons toasted wheat germ  Combine wet and dry ingredients. Add topping. Bake at 375 for aprox. 22 minutes.  The next time I'll just add the wheat germ in to the recipe and more nuts in the batter too. I find muffin toppings needlessly messy.   Great recipe!

I just took mine out of the oven and I don't know if I didn't add enough sugar but they taste kinda bland :( Since I didn't have sugar I added honey, one cup like some people suggested, but I don't taste the sweetness I just taste the cooked carrots and a few crunchy bites from the almonds I added since I didn't have walnuts. I drizzled honey over them and I'm gonna pop them back in the oven and see what happens. I will try making them again and use brown sugar and white sugar and see how that works out. I gave it a four because it's not their fault I didn't have sugar, or that I didn't add enough honey. What I do like is that they feel very light, I already ate two while writing this review and they keep tasting better :)

These were excellent! I only made a few alterations. I used cinnamon applesauce instead of the apple butter, and craisins instead of raisins, and probably got tired of grating carrot before the recommended amount happened:) I also didn't have wheat germ on hand, but I threw some oatmeal in for added texture. They came out moist and wonderfully textured! I'll definitely make them again!

Delicious. We got apple butter in our CSA box last week and I found this recipe while searching for ways to use it. These are delicious and so healthy! I skipped the nuts since I will be serving these to my toddler, and I used mini muffin tins (baked for 12 minutes). I will feel good about giving these to my 2 year old for breakfast!

So I make this recipe a bunch of different ways depending on what I want to put in them or have on hand.  I have used egg substitute before instead of eggs.  I usually do 1c whole wheat flour and 1c unbleached white flour.  I only use probably 7/8 c of sugar.  Instead of 1/2 c of apple butter and 1/4 c of oil I use 3/4 c of unsweetened apple sauce.  I do like most of the rest of the people on here and put about a cup of whatever nuts I want.  I have used toasted almonds and pecans.  Both taste great.  Here recently I have been putting a quart of blueberries in the recipe with 1 apple, 1 banana and 1/2 cup of raisins.  I don't ever peel the apple and I cut down to about 2 teaspoons of cinnamon.  This is better when you are making it with the blueberries as it lets the blueberry taste a little more prevalent.  Also, to make it easier I buy the matchstick carrots and rough chop them.  I take two of these muffins to work with me everyday for breakfast until they are gone.  They last over a week in the refrigerator.

These are soooo yummy! Just made them and have eaten 2 warm from oven. I topped a few with instant cinnamon oatmeal mixed with butter and it is good. I did use berry applesauce in place of apple butter AND oil. Will for sure make these again.

I just made these and they're fantastic! I made the following adjustments: only 3/4 cup sugar, no raisins, no wheat germ and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I also did half whole wheat and half all-purpose flour, I also added two heaping tablespoons of unsweetened coconut. What really makes this recipe wonderful is the apple butter. My muffins are extremely moist and delicious, and I will definitely be making these again! (I also left them in the oven for about 5 extra minutes)

This recipe is delicious and healthy, just as it is!  The only change I made was that my family doesn't like raisins in bread, so I added a cup of halved cranberries instead.  The result was delicious!  I will definitely make these again.

I have a high fat version of this recipe and I have to say, this one is just as good if not better!  I increased applesause to 1 cup and added just a splash of oil.  Also added some crushed flaxseed and non-sweetened coconut.  DELICIOUS!  Thanks so much!

These were so good, the only reason i gave it four stars is becuase i changed a few things to fit what i had. I used 1/2 cup ground oats instead of wheat flour and 1/2 cup mashed banana instead of apple butter. Otherwise i didnt change a thing and they were very good, especially with the cinnamon flavor.

FANTASTIC MUFFIN! just made these as recipe states, no adjustments other than instead of chopping the apple, i grated it like the carrot so it would more evenly distribute. They are so delicious. I only got 16 which is fine, my husband and I had one each, and i promised a girlfriend some. Will definitely make again, only next time I think I'll sub Splenda for the sugar to cut down more on calories :) thanks so much!!!

These were really good.  I used 1 egg and I used half oil half applesauce.  They were very moist and delicious.  My 7 year old it ate it up and liked it!  I will definitely make these agin.

I added some fresh nutmeg, used applesause instead of apple butter, and topped them with some brown sugar and oatmeal. They were a hit and even the teenagers devoured these muffins.

Wow, these are delicious.  Due to lack of the proper ingredients I used applesauce instead of apple butter and omitted the wheat germ.  I also used 2 whole eggs because I don't like to throw the yoke away, and, contrary to current popular belief, I think the WHOLE egg is good for you.  I used only whole wheat (I ground the equivalent) 2 cups of soft wheat).  This is they type of recipe that will taste great with any minor alterations you make.  I will definitely make these again.

Contains note for making 12 bakery size muffins. Terrific recipe and kudos to Jaclyn. A solid 5 STARS. I made a few tweaks only for my personal taste that I will share with you to acknowledge how easy it is to add your own touches. Instead of raisins (wife hates them), I added crasins. Added 1/2 cup of shedded coconut. Used an entire 8 ounce jar of my home made apple/plum butter. Replaced the veggie oil with 1/4 cup of apple sauce. Cut sugar to 1 cup. Follow all other recipe guidelines and be sure not to overmix! If you do the 12 muffin version change your baking time to 30 minutes, and then let them sit in the pan for 10 minutes on a wire rack before removing from pan. This is one of our favorite things to take hiking. Wrap individually and carry in a hard sided container. Nothing like sitting on a mountain top eating one of these muffins!

These are fabulous!!  I made the following changes based on others' recommendations and my personal preferences:  1 cup each of AP and WW flours, 1 cup sugar, 3 tablespoons of wheat germ, 1 T vanilla, and 1 cup of canned pumpkin instead of apple butter and oil.  The muffins were moist and wonderful, and I got rave reviews!  They also freeze well.  I figured out that they are (as I prepared them) 3 Weight Watchers points per muffin.  And 2 WW points if you omit the nuts.  I will make these again and again!  In fact, I have them in the oven right now, and am going to freeze most of them for Christmas.  :)

Made a HUGE batch of these because they are fantastic for my on-the-go kids. Halved the sugar and substituted half the oil with applesauce. My kids are eating carrots and they don't even know it! I used my food processor to keep the texture to a minimum.

These muffins are WONDERFUL!! I would give this recipe a 10 star rating if I could. Like others, I substituted applesauce for the applebutter, and used Splenda. Might cut back on some of the sugar/Splenda next time. This is the best muffin recipe ever!!!!

These muffins were delicious. I used one half cup white sugar and one half brown sugar. I also used one half apple and one half pear. Next time I might put some pecans in the batter. I will use this recipe often. My thanks to Jack Dickson for sharing it with us.

WOW, I LOVE LOVE LOVE this muffin. I too exchanged the applesause and apple butter, I also didnt add raisins as I dont like them in muffins. Had to grate the carrots by hand but it was WELL worth it.  Oh, I also used one cup white flour and one cup whole wheat., also put only one cup of sugar and it was just right!  Gonna give this to my toddler to help shake up morning breakfasts, thanks SO much Jack Dickson!

These were better than I expected.  Great actually.  My family has made a change and we are trying to eat healthier and these seem to fit the bill great.  I was a little skeptical, but I was surprised as well as my husband who has a new grab and go breakfast in the morning.  I am going to try them with Splenda instead of sugar next time.  I used the new Enova oil this time and it did great.  They freeze well too.  However, they did take a little longer to cook than it specified.  What's great is this recipe is lower in calories,fat, and WW point value than most of the other morning glory muffin recipes that I have found and
they taste great!

Despite my tampering with the recipe, these were awesome! I didn't add the wheat germ, raisins, or the oil, and I substituted the apple butter with applesauce (like it has been suggested), and I used Granny Smith apples. Also, I sprinkled oatmeal on top along with the walnuts to add some unique texture, and it was really good! I was originally concerned that maybe the muffins wouldn't be as moist without the oil, but it came out perfectly!

These muffins are amazing. I didn't have apple butter and used apple sauce which usually makes gross rubbery baked goods but these are delicious. I threw the walnuts into the batter and added a handful of coconut and they still turned out despite my messing with the recipe.

Super moist and really easy. Great recipe! I didn't have raisins on hand, but cranberries gave it the right amount of tart flavor. Plus, the toasty walnuts on top is a nice finish. I will use this one again. Thanks!

Wonderful! I didn't have apple butter so I used applesauce, and I left out the raisins, but other than that, I followed the recipe and they came out great! Wait, I did one thing differently. I stirred in the wheat germ and nuts because I did not read the recipe very carefully. Still thought they were great, and my picky 18-month-old liked them, too. Always a relief to get him to eat some veggies somehow. Next time, I might tweak and reduce the sugar, and add more whole wheat flour / less white flour, as they were plenty sweet enough. Will take another reviewer's advice if I do and add more liquid so they don't get too heavy or dry. Might try adding mashed banana too instead of the oil, but 1/4 cup is really not bad at all for a recipe like this. Thank you so much for sharing!

I've honestly never baked anything more scrumptious.   Of course the amount of apple butter, oil,  and sugar make it slightly less than healthy...  but who cares, this has become a favorite!

Fabulous recipe. I was looking for a 'go to' morning glory muffin recipe and with a few personal modifications, this will be a new favorite! The changes I made were substituting apple sauce for apple butter (I never have apple butter), adding 1/4 cup of wheat germ, lessening the amount of flour to 1 1/4 cups, adding 1/2 cup coconut, and 1 cup of chopped pecans in the batter. Delicious!!!

Delicious. To up the nutritional value, I used 1 Cup Wheat Flour and 1 Cup White, after reading reviews that had done the same. I used 3/4 Agave Nectar instead of the White Sugar so cut out on the processed stuff. They were still sweet and tasty! Love this recipe.

I've made these twice already and they are very good. First time, I cut the sugar down to 1 cup and second time, down to a bit more than 1/2 cup and it tasted just as good. Awesome breakfast muffin!

These muffins are excellent I used 1 cup regular flour and 1 cup whole wheat. Substituted apple sauce for apple butter 1/2 cup eggbeaters for the eggs and splenda instead of sugar. i mixed in the walnuts to the muffin.

While the flavor wasn't overtly sweet, after eating a muffin, I felt the effects of all the white sugar that was used. I will try an alternative sweetener to avoid canceling out the healthy ingredients.

Made these just as the recipes states (only left out the raisins b/c I hate them!) and they are DELISH!!!  Keep them in the fridge so they are really dense and moist.  YUMMY!  5 stars indeed!

These were great!  My kids asked for seconds and I was satisfied after 1.  I made some changes however. I used 1 cup white and 1 cup wheat flour, I only used 1 cup of sugar and 4 pkts of Stevia, I had 1 cup of carrots (minced fine in processor) 1 banana and 1/2 cup of blueberries (put in processor also), for the apple butter I used unsweetened applesauce and I added the wheat germ to the ingredients instead of sprinkling on top. I am not a huge raisin fan so I may omit them next time. These are very filling and yummy!

These are incredible!  I was surprised how moist they are.  I did not have apple butter so I used apple sauce, I also substituted apple sauce for the oil to make it healthier.  I only wish I had double the recipe because I know when my kids get home they will gobble them up very quickly.

Possibly the best muffin I've ever had.  Moist and flavorful.  Substituted only a few things out of necessity... Didn't have WWFlour so I used 2/3 cup Quick Oats.  Substituted Splenda for Sugar. Had only 1/4 cup Apple Butter on hand, so I added 1/4 cup sugar-free Applesauce and an additionl 1/2 tsp Cinnamon.  Omitted the Walnuts and Wheat germ - didn't have 'em in the pantry.  Probably cut the overall calorie count a few points and enjoyed the most AAAAHHHMAZING MUFFINS EVER!  Passing this one on to all my friends..or maybe I won't and keep it my little secret.

These are great breakfast muffins. I make a batch and individually wrap them up and freeze. I sub applesauce for the apple butter and use half wheat flour to regular flour.

Great for a healthy snack or breakfast! I made them with 1 c. white flour and 1 c. whole wheat, 1 c. turbinado sugar instead of white sugar, used only egg substitute, and left off the nuts. Only 175 calories each this way!

AWESOME!  I just ate 3 1/2 of these things.  I love all the healthy ingredients, especially when serving my children!  It was a fun activity to make them together with the kids, so they could see fruits and veggies going into these healthy muffins.  I took other's advice and used applesauce instead of apple butter.  Also, i wanted more nuts on top of the muffins so I did a walnut/pecan combo ~ delish!  THANKS for the recipe!!!  :)  ~Cincy Emily

Very good, and healthy!  I took other reviewer suggestions and used apple sauce instead of oil.  They were very tasty.  My neighbors, who are a very health coscious couple came back for seconds.  My kids weren't big fans though.

I've made these twice in the past month (half batches, since there's only two of us), and they are awesome! So moist and tasty, and sort of healthy. Next time I'd replace the sugar with agave and cut it back a little too. They're delicious as is, but could be healthier and still delicious with a bit less. They're great for breakfast on the run, a sweet snack, or dessert.

These were amazing! I made it once with no changes (except for replacing the apple butter with apple sauce), and next time I plan to omit the raison and add dry cranberries and double the nuts. What a great recipe, Jaclyn! Thanks for sharing :D

My husband, two year old daughter and I loved this recipe. My changes, as suggested ny other reviewers where: 1. Added mixed nuts and toasted wheatgerm to batter and not on top. 2.  Didn't have apple butter to used one small very ripe banana and 1/2 c apple sauce. 3.  Shredded my apples and carrots in a food processor.  My only complaint is that it took 45 minutes to prepare the batter, regardless they are yummy and healthy and my daughter loves them so we will make these again.

These are very tasty muffins. I used matchstick carrots to save time, but I would grate my own carrots next time, as I think it would add to the texture. I also used applesauce in place of apple butter and added about a cup of pumpkin. That gave the muffins a bit of moisture and great flavor. I also used all whole wheat flour, 3 whole eggs and a cup of chopped walnuts. I did not use the wheat germ or nuts on the top. These freeze well and can be warmed up in the microwave for a yummy breakfast treat!

This muffin is a great way to start  the morning.I followed the recipe exactly as described and they turned out beautifully! They're moist, sweet but not overwhelming, the apple-raisin combination is very tasteful and gives the muffin a nice healthy crunch. I would never imagine these muffins being less that 200 calories. If I could find more recipes like this, eating healthy would be a breeze. I'm just starting to take charge of my health and this muffin is a great start, seriously. I just ate half and I plan to devour the other half after lunch. Thanks Jaclyn!!!

This is my third time making muffins with the two previous batches being disastrous and these came out great.  I followed the recipe exactly and my family and friends loved them.  They are a very hearty and satisfying muffin- great for breakfast or as a snack before a workout.  I wonder if I could pour the batter into a small bread pan and make this as a bread?...

I was extremely pleased with how this turned out. Then again, can you really go wrong with anything that uses cinnamon? The raisins give a sweet kick to the muffins to compliment the carrots. Just a savory treat all the way around, and healthy too! I think next time I make these I'm going to try to switch the walnuts with almonds and see how that turns out.

The whole family loved these!  We used muffin liners for less cleanup and they worked fine.  I was a little disappointed that the wheat germ didn't stay on top, so I think next time I will just put it in the mix.  Also recommend using really fresh walnuts.  Mine were a little stale.  Great recipe!  We will make this again and again!

Loved them, even with doing 1 cup white flour and 1 cup wheat flour (trying to use more natural ingredients).  Everything else was the same.  Loved all that cinnamon in them!  And still moist the next day.

I'm so glad I found this recipe.  My family loves these muffins.  I've tried a few different variations of this recipe based on available ingredients in my kitchen and they always turn out well.

These are phenominal! I may reduce sugar next time as they were a bit too sweet for my liking. Everyone who tried these suggested I bake them and sell them.

These are really good.  I purchased carrots already shredded.  I didn't have apple butter so used applesauce in it's place.  When I make these again I'll use half the sugar or may try replacing with nutrasweet.

I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the apple butter and omitted the wheat germ.  Good, but a bit too sweet?  I will reduce sugar next time.

I thought these were ok.. mine actually came out a bit mushy but I think that's because I subbed applesauce for the oil so I can't fault the recipe for that one :)  I might try again.. this time will stick to the recipe!

I ended up using 1/2 regular flour and 1/2 rye flour (really just because I ran out of regular white flour).  They turned out great, and I got at least 24 muffins, rather than the 18 stated in the recipe.

These muffins are perfect when you want to indulge or as a quick post workout snack. I halved the recipe which turned out making twelve perfectly sized muffins. They are a little sweet, next time may use less sugar. I also added 1/2 of a very ripe banana which probably contributed to the sweetness. Delicious with coffee! Thank you for posting this recipe, will definitely make again!

A sneaky way to get some vegetables & fruit into my picky little girls!! Everybody that I shared them with loved them!! I didn't have apple butter so I used 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup cranberry-apple butter. Tasted great!! I also added a little rolled oats to the batter. Very yummy recipe!! Thanks for sharing!!!

These are good, but I would not make them with Splenda if you don't want an artificial sweetener/chemical aftertaste...yuck.  Another review suggested 1c. honey instead of sugar...I want to try that next..more natural.  I did 1c. white flour/1c. wheat flour as well as replacing the oil & apple butter for 1c unsweetened applesauce....those subsitutions worked out great.  Another sub I did was dried cranberries instead of raisins...yum.

Just ate my first one and they are great.  I changed the flour to 1/2 whole oat and 1/2 whole wheat.  I used apple sauce instead of oil and apple butter.  Splenda instead of sugar and craisons instead of raisons.  Did not have wheat germ so I topped with just the nuts.  These changes really reduced the calories but the taste was great.

I doubled this and got 72 mini muffins that baked in 19 minutes. I made it healthier I used 4 cups whole wheat flour, 1 1/4 cups brown sugar, 1 tbsp cinnamon, 1 tbsp pumpkin pie spice, 4 tsps baking powder, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 bag carrots grated, 3 apples with peel grated, 1 cup raisins, 3 eggs, 1 cup homemade sugar free applesauce, 1/3 cup canola oil and 2 tbsps vanilla. Nice fluffy texture, great for lunches and snacks for my boys and the hockey team.

I am not a very good baker...bu tthese turned out GREAT!!  I only made three changes I used apple sauce instead of apple butter, I added frozen blueberries, and I made two round loaves instead of muffins.  I did have to increase the cooking time by 10 minutes, but they turned out sooo yummy.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

These muffins are wonderful! I made a few tweaks to the recipe to suit my own taste: cut sugar back to 1 cup, will probably cut it a bit more next time as these tasted very sweet to me even with 1 cup, and omitted raisins because I forgot! I will add them next time. I sprinkled the tops with rolled oats instead of nuts and wheat germ. They are moist and filling. I can see they are going to disappear quickly, so I'm going to make a second batch to freeze!

I made a few modifications, but those were just to our families taste.  Added coconut, used applesauce, cinnamon and brown sugar for the topping instead.  So moist, so good!  Love this.  Will make again and again!

Going on others' reviews, I used 1c apple sauce instead of the apple butter/oil, and 1c/ea of w.wheat/ap flour, also a mix of brown sugar and honey to sweeten it (I was worried it wouldn't be sweet enough b/c I used less than a cup total, but boy those raisins go a LONG way in adding a natural sugar punch these babies!). I also used 1 XL egg instead of the egg+whites. I used my stick-blender to grate/puree the carrots, which left a few bigger chunks that were a welcome crunch in the muffin. I used a giant 6-muffin tin and baked them for 10mins longer. I'm going to freeze a mess as a MOIST, healthy/cheap replacement for my on-the-go poptart breakfasts!! Super filling as well! *edit* the 2nd time I made these, I forgot to add any sugar at all, and I didn't miss it! They still came out absolutely yummy thanks to the power of chopped apple and raisin-sweetness.

I am rating this recipe a solid 5.  Although I did make some changes to satisfy my tastes, the recipe is a very solid and tasty recipe on it's own.  Don't be afraid to experiment with different fruits, spices, and substitues as I did.  You won't be sorry.  Thanks for sharing!!

This recipe is great. My husband is a picky eater and I was able to sneak all kinds of fruits and vegetables in. I modified the recipe a little. I used 1c. flour and 1c. whole wheat flour, 1c. applesauce, 2 1/2tsp. baking powder and 1tsp. baking soda. This made them very light. I also added some other stuff I had laying around. 1c. shredded sweet potatoe, 1 banana, almonds, and dried cherries.  I also used just 1c. sugar and 1/4c. honey to cut bake some of the sugar. I will be making this recipe again and again.

This is the most forgiving recipe. I made so many substitutions that it is really a new recipe, yet delicious. Thank you, Thank you for a great recipe.

These muffins are out of this world.  I followed the recipe as written except for one thing.  I used about 1 c of all purpose flour and 1 c of whole wheat flour.  (I ran out of the white stuff.)  I will definitely make these again!

This recipe makes a lovely, moist muffin that's packed with flavour and nutrients.  I wouldn't need anything else for breakfast or a hearty snack.  I'm going to serve them to my Bed and Breakfast guests.

I used this recipe for my son's first birthday, and all the kiddos loved their healthy "cupcakes!"  I added coconut, and some craisins since I didn't have enough raisins, and also used half whole wheat, half white flour.  My mother-in-law the baker said they were the best she'd had!  I've since made mini-muffins, this recipe made about 60.

I had three small tubs of no fat yogurt, two vanilla, 1 passionfruit that I needed to use up. I didn't use the oil or apple butter because of this. I also used a mashed, overripe banana. I didn't add raisins or nuts due to family likes. I used less than 1/2 cup of raw sugar, but next time I will use honey. I used less cinnamon, and next time would use a full cup of wholemeal flour, and a full cup of white. Muffin, strawberries and coffee - what a wonderful breakfast! See photo.

Loved them! 
i did make a few small changes - took the sugar down to 1 c, put in equal parts whole wheat flour and white, added 1/2 c of shredded coconut and a mashed banana. i also used apple sauce and sprinkled oatmeal on top instead of wheat germ (it's what i had in my pantry). next time i'll leave out the oil entirely (not needed with the banana and apple sauce) and up the whole wheat flour - i have a two year old and am trying to get healthy foods in her. i also doubled the recipe and made mini muffins out of half the batch (cooking time was about 10 minutes on those). they also freeze very well! thanks for the recipe!

You may think the batter is too thick, but trust the recipe! I was tempted to add some applesauce to the batter after it was all combined, but resisted the urge and I'm glad I did. These muffins were delicious. The only changes I made were to use dried cranberry instead of raisins and I added about a 1/4 c. of flax for additional nutritional benefit. Great, guilt free muffins! Thanks.

These muffins are great! I replaced the raisins with a combo of dried cherries, cranberries and blueberries...very good! I followed the suggestion to only add 1 cup sugar and they are plenty sweet. The only other adjustment I made was to add a smashed banana since I was a bit short on my apple butter. Perfect for breakfast on the go. This is a superb recipe! Thanks for sharing.

Very good muffins! I used one cup of Splenda in place of sugar with great results. I also took another's advice and added about 1/4 cup of crushed pineapple, replaced the apple butter with applesauce, and eliminated the oil. Still very moist and full of flavor! I omitted the nuts and wheat germ (didn't have any.) I also used golden raisins in place of regular. Yummy!

These are my all-time favorite muffins! I bake them every Sunday and freeze them so we have breakfast for the week. My 4-year-old loves them, too. I omit the raisins and nuts (not a fan of either), but there's nothing I would change about this recipe. Thank you!

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I took advantage of substitutions like applesauce instead of butter.  It was wonderful. Made such a huge batch for our family I froze half of recipe and cooked that next week.

This recipe is okay. It has a good flavor, but definitely takes longer than 15- 20 mins to bake. If you make 18 of them, they do not "pop over" and form like a muffin...more like a flat cupcake. Good taste though..may try again as a bread.

WONDERFUL! I was trying to find a morning muffin that was also healthy and not completly white flour. We all loved this one. I didn't add the chopped apple since I have a 19 month old and a 3 year old... I was worried that there would be too many noticeable things in the muffin with the carrots, apples and raisins and they wouldn't eat it. They ate it up so I may add apple next time. I'll definitely make again. Thanks for a great muffin!

Delicious, very moist.  I have also substituted pumpkin butter for the apple butter with pecans instead of walnuts.  Both ways are a favorite in my house.

Great muffins but too much sugar for me. The carrots and apple butter are sweet  too so I only used half a cup of sugar. Added more apples and instead od 1 egg and two egg whites just used 3 eggs ;)

So, so good.  I wanted something healthy I could grab on the go on the way to work and this will def do the trick! I added 1/2 c fresh cranberries and decreased the raisins by half, and used half sugar and half Splenda (instead of all sugar).  They are still sweet enough and the cranberries add a perfect amount of tartness. Love the walnuts on top.

Wonderful recipe! I did not use the apple butter as I do not have any. I substituted in 1/3 cup of oil instead as that was what I had, this was in addition to what was already called for in the recipe. I also added an extra half an apple since I skipped the apple butter. I did not cube my apples, I shredded them as I prefer them that way in this type of muffin. Also, I upped the amount of walnuts and I am so glad I did. The recipe definitely does not call for enough if you enjoy walnuts. Wonderful flavor will be putting this into our rotation. I made mine into mini-bread loaves and cooked about 30 minutes.

These were really good!  Like others suggested I subbed 1cup unsweetened applesauce for the Apple butter and oil. I used whole wheat flour instead of white. I also used craisins instead of raisins. Next time I will probably use a little less sugar as they were really sweet.  I left off the nuts and wheat germ because we didn't have any. It didn't make a bit of difference! Both my kids are very picky eaters (4 and 1) and they loved them, and I didn't feel awful letting them have one!

Very good for a healthier-than-most muffin. This is a very forgiving recipe and can be adapted to what you have on hand. I Followed others advice and used applesauce (1 cup) instead of oil and apple butter. Threw in a few tablespoons each of almond meal, coconut flour, flaxseed and chia instead of the whole wheat flour. Instead of raisins, I had a dried fruit mix of raisins, craisin, dried goji berries, and cherries - plumped them up in a little hot water for a few minutes before adding them. I had pecans instead of walnuts and I just put them in the batter. Would not have minded having a few more tablespoons of them for added crunch. Used coconut sugar (1 cup) and brown sugar (1/4 cup) but could probably cut back to 1 cup sugar next time.

Ridiculously good. Subbed the oil for apple sauce, used a half cup raisins and a half cup cranberries and used all wheat flour. Next time I'm going to reduce the sugar to save some calories, I think they'll still be amazing.

I made these today, having only heard of these muffins on this site and thus never tried them before. So, I have nothing to compare them to. They were an interesting muffin. I liked that they were not overly sweet, which does make them perfect as a morning muffin. On Cooks Country, though, they said that the title came from the name of the restaurant/bakery that created them. I decided to test with 1/2 recipe and got 9 muffins as suggested by doing so. I followed the recipe exactly, except I only had 1/3 cup of raisins for half the recipe so I was a little short. However, there still seemed to be plenty of raisins. I also just used 1 egg, for half the recipe instead of the egg white and egg for ease and to avoid waste. I even liked the topping of wheat germ and walnuts. It was a nice change from the overly sweet sugary toppings on so many muffins. I am going to see how they taste tomorrow. They may be even better.

These muffins are awesome!  Healthy and filling and easy to grab as I walk out the door in the morning. I chose to grate the apple because it seemed easier, but otherwise followed the recipe perfectly and it worked out great.

the first time I tried that recipe, I was a bit uncertain: the batter was so thick, and so full of fruits and veggies, I really did not know how they would turn out.  But they turned out fan-tas-tic!! My two fussy-eaters, teenage boys are crazy about them! The only change I made was using a whole egg instead of two egg whites.  Love them!!

These were the best!! My changes: 1 c. wheat flour and 1 c. all-purpose flour, 1/2 c. Truvia baking sweetener instead of 1 c. sugar, 2 T. Splenda brown sugar instead of 1/4 c. sugar, applesauce instead of apple butter, coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, and baby carrots instead of reg. carrots. These muffins are my new favorite breakfast food!!

These were tasty muffins. The carrots and apples really flavored them. Grating the carrots would take a while, so I recomend putting them through a food processor, buying pre- grated carrots, or blending them in small batches with a bit of water added, straining them, and then reducing the oil in the recipe. Its important to cut the apples into small pieces. I think the topping needed more walnuts in it also. My muffins were done after about 19 minutes and came out very moist. A great nutritious recipe.

I'm having a hard time rating this - I really liked the flavor and want to like this as a whole, but the texture of the carrots really didn't do it for me. If you're okay with grainy textures, the flavor is fabulous.

These are outstanding! So moist and full of healthy ingredients. The only thing I did different was use apple sauce in place of apple butter as I had the apple sauce on hand.

I made these exactly as stated but I added a brown sugar crumble topping because I thought my kids would eat them that way. Nope, I guess they were too healthy for my 2 teenagers. My DD tried them and ate a few but asked me not to make them again. My DS wouldnt try them. My DH didnt like them at all. Well, I thought they were very good the first day but just ok after that. Because of m family's reviews I will not make these again.

This recipe is pretty dang good. I used 1 cup whole wheat and 1 cup all-purpose flour.  I also used 2 eggs instead of the one plus two whites.  Seems like a pretty easy recipe to play around with!

I do half whole wheat flour half all purpose.  I use applesauce in place of the apple butter.  Usually dont' add very many raisins (personal preference) and love the flavor texture I get from adding about 1/2 C coconut.  I also omit the topping just to make it easier and my whole family loves them!

Delicious and nutritious!  I added the wheat germ and walnuts into the mix and they turned out wonderful.  My picky husband and two year old boy can't stop eating them!  I froze some so that they last longer.

I really enjoy making this recipe on a regular basis. The honey and applesauce is a nice switch instead of the all the regular sugar and apple butter.  I'm still working to get 'just the right' amount of each, though.

These are delicious! I did make some changes though: 1 c white, 1 c ww flour, 1/2 c sugar, 1/2 c brown sugar, instead of apple butter I used 1/2 cup apple sauce and 1/2 cup pumpkin puree. I'm sure they're just as good as shared, but I couldn't help myself! Thanks for posting :)

I've found the recipe to top the 'Sunrise' muffins I found in a bakery.  These are perfect as is.  I tried a 2nd batch fairly quickly and had run out of white sugar so used brown sugar to make up differnetce (only 1 cup total was sweet enough). The toasted wheat germ made a difference too - a nice flavor - but definatley should toast. Another suggestion: don't use red deliscious, use a tart or very flavorful apple - well worth it. Whole almonds instead of walnuts were very good.

Oh Wow!  Yummy and healthy.  I used 1/2 cup all- purpose unbleached flour, 1/2 cup whole oats, 1 cup whole wheat, and 1 Tbs wheat gluten (for texture).  I used 1 cup splenda, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup egg whites (from carton) with no whole eggs, 1/2 cup pumpkin butter (because I had it in my pantry, but would also use apple sauce) and instead of the oil I used 1/4 cup mashed ripe banana ( I throw them in the freezer still in peel when they get too ripe, just for this type of recipe). I mixed chopped walnuts in rather than sprinkling on top, I skipped the wheat germ.  I found this recipe because I made something else this weekend requiring shredded carrots and I had decided to process the whole bag of carrots, then seek a recipe to use the remaining shredded carrots.  I rarely keep food in the house, don't shop a lot, but I had all the ingredients I needed at home!  This is going to be my grab and go guilt free breakfast from now on.  Only problem is trying to keep my husband from eating them all as soon as I make them.  GREAT recipe!

I am not sure I can rate these since I did make quite a few changes but my changes were amazing and I couldn't have made them without your recipe. I didn't have apple so I used dried banana, I used cranberries instead of raisins since I don't like raisins, pear butter instead of apple butter since I had just made a batch and I used a little more since I used dried bananas, I also added a 1/4 c apple sauce and mixed 1/2 cup of walnuts in omitting the wheat germ. Thank you for a recipe you can use substitutions with.

these are great and you can easily alter the recipe to suit your own tastes.  I omit the apple butter, add a mashed banana.  I also soak the raisins in the egg mixture (i only use 2 eggs) to plump them up before baking.  Yum!

The changes I made were to substitute 1cup of applesauce for the apple butter and vegetable oil, to use 1/2 craisins and 1/2 raisins, and to use muffin cups.  Next time - I will use ALL craisins and will NOT use muffin cups (they stuck).  I will definitely be making them again!

I have made these several times and love them! My husband, who isn't crazy about muffins, LOVES these, too, and even requests them. I add extra fixings whenever I can - from coconut, to different ground nuts/seed (flax, almond, oat, etc.). This recipe is so forgiving that you can really add almost whatever you want to bulk up its healthy benefits.

Excellent! I took a reviewer's advice and processed the carrot and apple in a food processor.  I also substituted apple butter for applesauce.  Instead of adding wheat germ and walnuts to the top, I pulsed them in a food processor and added them to the mix.  It turned out wonderfully.  I think next time I'll up the whole wheat flour to 1 cup and lower the white flour to 1 cup.  I think the raisins give a nice sweetness so I could possibly lower the sugar to 3/4 cup.  Make them anyway you want...they will turn out great.  Great recipe - very tasty.  My 2 year old loved them as well!

Delicious and moist muffins. I love pumpkin, so used pumpkin butter (found at a farmer's market) instead of apple butter. I also used a food processor for the apple and carrots, equal parts white and whole wheat flour, and doubled the walnuts on top.

Very good! I didn't have wheat germ or nuts on hand, so I just made the muffins without them. Overall I'm very impressed - they are a relatively healthy, very tasty muffins - a nice contrast to what I usually bake ^_^

I like these a lot. They're very tasty. I modified a few things: used half white and half whole-wheat flour; used half white and half brown sugar, and used slightly more of the apple and carrot than the recipe called for. Really good!

Super yummy - 1 year old really liked them.  Substituted the apple butter and oil and used one cup of applesauce and they were very moist and delicious.  Made in mini muffin pans - cook about 11 mins.

These are INCREDIBLE!  I made the following changes based on other reviews:  substitute 1/2 of the sugar with brown sugar, substitute pumpkin for the oil, substitute pecans for walnuts, add 1/2c coconut, and sub flax seed for the wheat germ.  You won't be sorry with this recipe!  Double it right away!

I made these over the weekend and put a couple in a plastic bag next to our coffee maker for my husband to take to work. They must be excellent because I got a call from him a couple of hours later to tell me how delicious they were and how much he appreciated me making them for him (he never calls me from work since he's usually swamped!) The only problem I have is that I now have to make them on a regular basis.... :)

This are amazingly good.  I made a few modifications, some out of necessity.  I had no nuts or raisins, so those were out.  I cut the sugar down by 1/3c. because the apple butter is sweet.  I also used only egg whites, again because that is all I had.  So really, minor modifications but wanted to mention before I say these are FABULOUS.  Truly terrific.  I can't remember ever having such a healthy muffin that tasted every bit as good as the bad-for-you kind.  They are especially good if you put in toaster oven right before eating.  They freeze well (cooked) and thaw out just fine. 
The toasted wheat germ on top is very tasty - smart addition.
THANK YOU for this recipe!  It will be a regular in my morning rotation.

Just made these this morning for my husband's birthday since they have a version of these at a local cafe that we love. These were spectacular! I did 1/2 cup raisins and 1/2 cup shredded coconut, and skipped the walnuts on top since I was being lazy ;-)

Delicious! I would recommend these for any occasion.

Fantastic, I ended up making two more batches after family and even my two year old ate almost all the muffins, even before they cooled. I made some changes:  added mixed fruit applesauce instead of the apple butter,Canola oil instead of vegetable oil, used only whole wheat white flour,splenda instead of sugar,added the wheat germ right to the mix, and I used the kitchenaid shredder attachment to shred the apple and carrots. I chopped the apples and shredded the carrots with a grater the first time and it tasted much better (more smooth and blended) using the kitchenaid shredder.

Better than expected, even given all the rave reviews.  Awesome!  And healthy.  I also used applesauce (unsweetened) instead of apple butter and 1 c. of sugar was enough for them to be slightly sweet.  Also switched the measurements of the whole wheat flour and al-purpose flour.  I added shredded coconut.  Didn't have wheat germ so I used ground flax on top.  Very moist.  You forget they're healthy.  Great with a cup of coffee.  Thanks.

Excellent, excellent recipe.  Like many other readers, I, too, made some modifications to suit what I had available and due to personal tastes.  I added some shredded coconut and a tiny bit of almond extract with the vanilla.  I also replaced the apple butter with rose hip  lekvar (it's Polish) and used half of the sugar.  Oh, and I used almond oil.  The result was fragrant, moist, and hearty muffins that I put in a big baggie and tossed in the freezer so I can pop a couple out every morning for breakfast!  Yum!

Excellent recipe!  I made some small changes - reduced the all purpose flour to 1/2 cup, added 1/2 cup 7 grain flour and a total of 1 cup soft whole wheat flour.  Added chopped dates to the mix and like other users, used unsweetened applesauce instead of apple butter.  I didn't have any muffin tins so I made it into a large loaf.  Very moist and delicious!

Wow! These were delicious! The texture was perfect! They were very moist and I love that 2 cups of carrots are used! Talk about not-so-guilty pleasure! I also tried icing some of the muffins with store bought cream cheese icing and chopped walnuts on top.  Divine!

I really liked this recipe. In place of oil, diced apple and apple butter I used 1 cup of regular apple sauce and 1/2 cup of chunky apple sauce. I also used dried cranberries in place of rasins. It turned out better than I thought. I forgot about the walnuts but the wheat germ was a nice touch. Next time I will try dried blueberries and maybe mix in some flax seeds.

Thanks for the recipe. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I don't like to grate carrots.

YUM!!!  These were GREAT.  I accidently put in almond extract instead of vanilla and the result was amazing!  I substituted the oil for apple sauce and also added two tablespoons of ground flax meal.  The end result was a muffin that was moist, very flavorful, and very healthy !!!

Wonderful recipe!  I used only whole wheat pastry flour.  I also cut the sugar down to a little less than 2/3 cup.  As other reviewers shared, I replaced the apple butter with applesauce.
I grated most of the apple and only chopped about 1/4.
I didn't use the wheat germ, just nuts on top.  
Yummo!

REALLY good with great texture and taste.Did change the sugar to use only one cup and half of that was brown sugar. Did not have enough apple butter so I made up the deficit with applesauce.  Forgot the topping but tasty anyway!  Will certainly make again.

The best muffins I've made in a long time. Using this recipe I made only 12, not 18, and increased the baking time by about 6 minutes.

These are pretty good muffins (I have to admit that I can't seem to find a home-made muffin recipe that I actually like). There was not enough liquid in the batter so I added 1/2 cup applesauce and that did the trick. They came out moist, not greasy. I used 1/2 cup dried cranberries and 1/2 cup raisins, and didn't have wheat germ so I omitted it and just topped with toasted pecans. I made 12 huge muffins so I needed to bake a little longer. My 5 yr old daughter likes them!

These muffins are really good and full of healthy ingredients.  I used sunflower seeds (chopped) instead of walnuts, cut the sugar back to 1 cup and used a Granny Smith apple, all based on other users recommendations.  I had some apple butter that I bought at a local orchard/country store, however, I also noticed that they sell it in the neighbourhood grocery store with the jams, for those of you having a hard time finding it.  This recipe does actually make 18 muffins - which is great as I usually find that I don't get the expected yield.  Thanks for the recipe - I will be making these again for sure!

These take a while to make because of all the ingredient prep time, but it is so worth it.  These are very tasty, healthy muffins.  I like giving them to my toddler as a healthy snack. I've now made them twice.

I have to admit I altered it, but here are my reasons: 1 1/2 cups sugar isn't healthy or necessary if there's fruit in it, and 1 1/2 cups white flour is hardly healthy either. I used 1/4 c sugar, and it was still sweet, although not as sweet as cake. But these are muffins, not cake. I also switched the ratio of white to whole wheat flour. I've found a little white flour keeps it from crumbling, but if you don't mind the crumbling, you could go totally whole wheat. I did what other reviewers suggested by using the food processor for the apples and carrots, but I should have processed my carrots more. The carrot chunks weren't completely cooked, and my picky eaters didn't like the slightly bitter taste of raw carrots. I personally didn't mind it. Oh and for lack of apple butter I used apple sauce as a replacement for that and oil. The texture was soft and springy, and not too wet or too dry. I thought they were delicious!

I subbed applesauce for the apple butter, and all white flour. These were DELICIOUS, tender, light, moist muffins. Full of flavor. I made them in mini muffin tins to freeze for my toddler's breakfasts but found myself eating them too. She loved them, and they froze and reheated perfectly. Thanks for the recipe!

An excellent recipe! Thank you. 

I didn't have apples, apple butter, or raisins. So, I made some changes and it turned out well.

1. Substituted 1/2 brown sugar (instead of white)
2. Added 1/3 cup molasses instead of apple butter
3. Added 2 teaspoons Almond Powder
4. Added small handful of chopped, dried cranberries
5. Added handful of flax seed
6. Added handful of crushed walnuts
7. Added 2 tablespoons wheat bran
8. Skipped the topping at the end

I also chopped my carrots into tiny bits as well as shredding them. It provides nice texture.

My mixture was a bit dry without the apple, apple butter, and raisins so I added about 1/3 cup of water and 2 teaspoons of plain yogurt.

I baked for about 18 minutes. I'll definitely be making this one again.

I was a bit disappointed with this recipe.  I was just under impressed after all the good reviews and I didn't even make any changes to the recipe like some do. My family didn't like them and said they wished I had just made zucchini muffins instead.

We really enjoyed this recipe! I actually had some homemade pumpkin butter in my refrigerator and it worked perfectly in place of the apple butter. The batter was definitely thick, but the grated fruit / veggies gave it the moisture it needed. My husband, 16 year old son, and 14 month old all enjoyed these. I subbed dried cherries for raisins. I also mixed the wheat germ and walnuts into the batter instead of sprinkling on top.

Delicious.  I substituted 1 1/4 cups flour and  1 cup oatmeal for the white and whole wheat flour. I also used 1 1/2 apples and 1 cup of applesauce instead of the apple butter and oil. Instead of raisins I used 1/2 cup of cranberries.  For the eggs I used 2 whole eggs. I kept everything else the same and didn't do the crumble on top.

This  recipe has calls for way too much sugar. Other muffin recipes call for 1/2-3/4 cup sugar for 2 cups flour. This recipe calls for twice that much. There is so much sugar that the muffin tops are sticky. If  I make them again, I'll cut the sugar in half.

These were delicious! Just made a few changes - 1 cup W flour, 1 cup WW flour,  1 cup applesauce instead of apple butter (as suggested by other reviewers), & 3/4 coconut sugar instead of 1 1/4 white sugar. Also added 1/2 cup unsweetened coconut. In future,  I will add 1/2 cup walnuts into batter instead of the topping.

Delicious! I made a few changes - used 3 whole eggs and deleted the oil, used 1/2 C. white sugar, and 3/4 cup dark brown, and added 2 T of chia seeds instead of wheat germ.  These are dense and filling muffins!  They don't rise too much in the oven because there's so many goodies in it, so I filled the muffin cups to just about full and got perfect muffin tops.

Great in freezer! I wrapped them individually in plastic wrap and froze them. You can take one out, pop it in the microwave for 30 seconds and have a fast breakfast or snack. These are a big hit with everyone in my family, including teenagers.

I made these muffins and took some to work and ended up giving the recipe to co workers because they loves them so much. I used splenda instead of sugar and I added some honey as well. I am not a measurer I usually just add a little to taste. I tripled the apples and I processed them with the carrots well more like a sauce than chunks. I think the extra apples helped mask the carrot flavor. I didn't use the wheat germ because I couldn't find it near me. And I wasn't sure if I would like it. I used apple sauce instead of apple butter and oil. And as I said they still turned out great. Oh and I didn't have vanilla extract so I used caramel extract and it didn't seem to hurt the flavor.

Have made this many times now and passed on to friends and family. Never add oil or apple butter but usually add 1/2 cup crushed pineapple or baby food prunes to replace fat. I also just mix wheat germ and walnuts in with the batter.  These muffins are so good and I think flavor gets more intense a day or 2 after baked.

Hearty, healthy and delicious!  These muffins are great for breakfast, but even better for a quick afternoon snack.  I did make them healthier than the original recipe using some suggestions from other cooks.  I replaced half of the flour with Whole wheat, substituted 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup honey for white sugar and substituted plain yogurt for the oil.  I agree that the muffins were very sticky when they were warm but didn't stick to the paper at all after completely cooled.  I will make these again, probably subbing more white flour with oats or flax meal.  Thank you for these fantastic muffins!

This is a wonderful recipe! I believe it's the best muffin recipe I've ever made. They turned out moist and they had great flavor. I did have to modify a bit for what I had in hand - I used 1 cup AP and 1 cup whole wheat flour, 3/4 cup granulated sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, no raisins, and used applesauce instead of the apple butter. Any way you make them - they're a winner!

This is such a great muffin base. I have tweaked it in so many ways and it doesn't disappoint.
My favourite change is to add chopped up (dried) apricots.
I always use whole wheat flour only (in everything). I substitute 1 cup of applesauce instead of the apple butter and oil - healthier, and you'd never know the difference.
Mini muffins take about 12-15 mins (depending on size) and regular muffins took about 17-21 mins (also, depending on how full you fill the muffin tin).

I try to make a different batch of muffins each week for healthy snacks for my family, but this is hands-down the favourite recipe!

Loved it! I cut the sugar back to 1 cup and used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown. Did not use apple. Used two whole eggs and 1 egg white - figured the recipe could use the extra fat and liquid. Added 1/2 cup walnuts to batter. Followed the recipe otherwise, including using a lightly sprayed muffin pan with no liners. I did have to loosen the muffins with a knife a tiny bit, but with a little coaxing I was able to get them out of the pan without damaging any. 

What I really liked about the recipe is that the muffins were beautifully domed and didn't sink or overrun. With the slightly decreased sugar, these were perfect, well, they were perfect with a schmear of butter. :-)

I gave this four stars because I felt there was too much cinnamon, but I am not a huge cinnamon lover. Next time I will reduce to 1 teaspoon cinnamon. I felt they were a bit sweet, even after I reduced the sugar to just one cup. I might try a combination of white and brown sugar or even honey next time. Overall, a very good and healthy muffin. I'll be making this again with some modifications.

I made some incredibly delicious muffins based on this recipe, but did do quite a few tweaks.  As others have said there is way too much sugar--I reduced it to 1 cup and could definitely stand to reduce it more.  I didn't have wheat germ but I used wheat bran and just put it in the batter along with the walnuts.  Instead of apple butter I finely grated one apple and added that (with juice) to the batter, and used about 1/4 cup melted coconut oil as well.  I just used 2 whole eggs instead of 1 egg and 2 whites and 1 cup whole wheat and 1 cup white flour.  I also added a little nutmeg, upped the cinnamon, and left out the raisins.  I only have a 12 muffin tin so mine were quite large.  Will definitely be making them again though!

These are the best muffins I've ever made. Used a food processor for the carrots to save on time, added walnuts in the batter instead of just on top, omitted the raisins, but followed the recipe other than that. Everyone at work was asking for the recipe. Will definitely make again!

Awesome! These turned out really well and were super easy. I used 1 c. honey instead of sugar, 1 c. apple-sauce (unsweetened). I didn't use any apple butter or oil. I don't have a food processor so I just threw 2 cups of carrots with the apple sauce into the blender to speed it up. Took 15 min to prepare and 25 to bake. I will freeze half, and next time, add some protein powder and/or flax seed to make them even healthier.

These are very good.  Made the applesauce substitution like everyone else.  Used an extra egg in place of the whites.  Used 1/2 white whole wheat flour and 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour. Cut the sugar to 3/4 cup because with all the other sweet elements, 1 1/4 cups seemed way over the top.  Shredded carrots, apples and nuts in the food processor for ease.  Baked 25 minutes.  Came out great. I was tempted to add milk because I worried they would be dry but didn't and they're not. Plenty sweet,too.  Will be great toasted too I think.

Very tastey. I used pears instead of apples and applesauce with allspice and pumpkin pie spice instead of apple butter (since thats what I had). I think next time I 'll include some nuts in the batter to bump up the protein. Thanks for sharing!

I tried this recipe today, now that I am looking for healthier ways of eating and/or snacking.  The Recipe texture was wonderful, but a little too much on the sweet side (which surprised me)!  Next time I will try with only 3/4 cup sugar.  Will be a keeper, but needs a little tweaking.

With so many 5 star reviews I was expecting more from this recipe. The ingredients should complement each other and they don't. My husband took one bite and declared them "healthy". (Which is his code word for "it's awful".) I won't be making these or any other version of Morning Glory muffins again.

These are delicious. I didn't do vegetable oil, I did an entire cup of applesauce. No apple butter. I also mashed up a whole rip banana. Didn't have walnuts and crushed almonds. I also didn't do sugar and just used some Agave. Soo good!

This recipie has little flavor and is missing a lot. The traditional Morning Glory muffins also have crushed pineapple and shredded coconut.  Pecans instead of walnuts.  Not one I will be making again.

I have made these numerous times.  I do change up the recipe a bit.  I use half white and half whole wheat flour.  I cut the sugar back to just 1 cup and again use half white and half brown sugar.  I do like the apple butter in the recipe.  Sometimes when I have applesauce in my fridge, I will replace that for the 1/4 cup of oil. Also, depending on what I have on hand, I sometimes replace the toasted wheat germ with milled flax seed. These are a great breakfast muffin and I always double the recipe.  They freeze so well and I can pull out as many as needed and just let thaw.  I recommend that you try these.  I can almost guarantee that you will like them.

This recipe is easy and fast. I did not have apple sauce nor apple butter so I used strawberry butter. Instead of whole weat flour, I used rolled oat and cranberries to substitute the raisins. They were awesome!!!

Delicious, and the kids LOVE these. I also substituted the Apple Butter for unsweetened apple sauce, the sugar for honey and added a few tablespoons of ground Flax Seeds, shredded coconut, halved the raisins and added 1/2 cup dried Cranberries and also used 1 cup Whole Wheat Flour and 1 cup All Purpose. They came out moist and perfect. Such a good recipe!

I love these muffins. After reading several reviews, I did the 1/2 cup of honey instead of sugar. I added 1/2 oats and made sure I added an extra 1/2 tsp. of baking powder as one had suggested. Since I did add the oats, the honey kept the batter moist enough. I used the apple butter. Instead of making the topping, I just added the wheat germ and the nuts to the batter. I also added some cacao chips, but don't overdo it with the chips. Love these and something that my college son will be able to grab quickly as he heads out early.

I really liked these muffins but I made a couple of adjustments to the original recipe.  I used 3/4 cup of sugar instead of 1 1/2 cups.  The sweetness was perfect- the fruit adds a lot of sweetness so you don't miss the sugar at all.
I used applesauce instead of apple butter and I used equal parts whole wheat flour and white flour (1 cup of each). I did not have an apple so I used a Bartlett pear and I left the skin on.  I used a mini muffin tin and filled each tin to the top and baked them for 12 minutes- they were perfect!

Wow Wow!!!! Amazing muffins! Only changes I made, since I didn't have apple butter on hand, I added 1 c. applesauce and didn't add any chopped apples like the recipe called for. Also, added 1-2T. extra of sugar and 1t. extra of cinnamon (to make up for the extra sugar and cinnamon being in apple butter). --For the raisins, I pre-softened them by putting them in a pan with just enough cold water to cover, brought it to a boil, then shut the burner off, and covered with a lid for just a few min. Strain off the water and get as much liquid off the raisins before adding to the dry mixture. I also used a food processor to made the process of grating the carrots quicker (mine was a tiny one, but worked like a charm!). Also, I didn't have wheat germ on hand, so I used flaxseed instead. --Gave one of these muffins to a friend of mine to eat on her way home (got a text before she got home that she LOVED these muffins and HAD to have the recipe!! The muffin was even a day or two old. So, thanks Jaclyn for sharing! **I made these muffins in hopes that I could get my toddler to eat carrots and a bunch of other healthy stuff for him- so far so good :) I will be making these again and AGAIN. P.S. I'm eating one now that's about 3-4 days old and it's STILL super moist and out of this world! My hubby loves these too*

Awesome! I used applesauce instead of apple butter and dried cherries instead of raisins... they were fantastic!

I followed the recipe exactly.  The muffins were very good....sticky, but good.  And sweet enough that perhaps I will cut the sugar down next time and substitue the apple butter and oil for applesauce.  You don't really taste the carrot, just the sweetness of the apple and raisins.

Loved it.  Did as others suggested, used one cup each white and wheat flour, and one cup applesauce instead of apple butter and oil. I also used 2 honey crisp apples since the apples I had were so small.  Yummy!

I made these exactly as written, using all organic ingredients, as I am trying to get my household to go a little more natural and healthy. The amount of sugar really did worry me as I was pouring it in. Now that I have made the recipe, I know to reduce the sugar next time!! I mean the apple butter is pretty sweet/ tart itself. I just think 1 1/4 cup sugar is a little much. Plus you have the sweetness from the chopped up apples and raisins. Overall a good muffin, just would change the amount of sugar. Everything else was great. And oh yea, I bought a bag of carrots that were already shredded so it wasn't a very 'labor intensive' recipe.

These muffins are our new favorite!  They are even better after sitting in tupperware for 1/2 a day.  They seem to get moister.  I did use 1 c. natural applesauce instead of apple butter, 2 whole eggs instead of 1 egg and 2 egg whites, and about 1 cup sugar.  My kids love these!  It's like a salad in a muffin!

These muffins were very good, but I have to admit that I altered the recipe quite a bit since I didn't have some of the ingredients at hand.
I cut the sugar down to almost half, and the muffins were still sweet enough for my taste.
Also didn't have apple butter so used buttermilk. Sustituted half the oil with buttermilk.
Used dried apricots istead of rasins.
Doubled the walnuts.
I think this is a really good basic recipe that can be altered to fit taste and the ingredients at hand.

These taste like something Grandma made.  Homey, moist, full of things that are mostly good for you.  Hubby said they were the best muffin he has ever had (and he doesn't like muffins).  Made as written but added just a sprinkle of cinnamon sugar on top.  Thanks for the recipe.

I didn't have an apple, so I put in an extra 1/2 c. of applesauce....and I didn't have whole wheat flour so I subbed A/P. It still came out really yummy! I will try it exactly as written next time. I gave it 4 stars because I really liked them and they were healthy but no one else in my family seemed to like them as much as I did.

Per other reviewers suggestions, I used 1 cup of wheat flour/ 1 cup white flour, cut sugar down to 1 cup, used egg subst., and1 cup applesauce instead of apple butter and oil.  I also left out the nuts b/c I don't like them.  These were great.  I got exactly 18 muffins.  Next time, I am going to try to cut the sugar more or use honey.

I did not use walnuts.  Next time I will use more of the whole-wheat flour vs white flour and sub splenda for the sugar to make them healthier.  Very good.

Yum! I reduced the sugar quite a bit because we like our muffins less sweet and used apple sauce instead of apple butter. I also cut the cinnamon to 2 tsp. because 1 tb. seemed to be a little much. Didn't have any vanilla extract but the muffins had plenty of flavor. Nice and moist. Next time I might mash up a banana instead of using apple butter, that would be REALLY good. Yum! Thanks Jaclyn for the recipe. :-)

Thought this recipe was excellent and a great way to get in veggies and whole wheat. The only changes I made was to use golden raisons and coconut extract because it was all I had on hand. It made way more than 18 muffins, closer to 25, I'd say. This was a nice bonus as my 2 yr old, hubby and I gobbled them down. Will definitely be making these again!

These muffins are fabulous! I did make some small changes, to be fair to the recipe. I used 1 cup of applesauce instead of the vegetable oil and apple butter. I used some brown sugar and some white sugar. I also used white flour only (because that's all I had). I also added sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds to the batter, and I sprinkled sunflower seeds on the top with the walnuts (I didn't use wheat germ).  These muffins seem like they can be altered quite a bit without losing their deliciousness. I do have a sweet tooth, so while they were perfect for me, they would still be delicious with less sugar. Yummy!

I have been retrieving recipes off this site for a very long time.  I have never once written a review.  I only just joined in order to rate this recipe.  It is absolutely fabulous.  The only change I made was substituting the applebutter for the applesauce, (as others suggested) which I have done before in other recipes and it worked just fine in this one as well.    I ended up with exactly 20 muffins 9 of which were scarfed down in a matter of moments.  The last time I looked (as I went to scarf another down myself) there were just 6 left.  Mind you I made them 3 hours ago.  Without question one of the best recipes I have ever found.  Thanks much for sharing!

A friend brought me a muffin while at work and a week went by and I kept thinking about how good it was. I later asked her for the recipe and here it is! They are very good! She cheated and put chocolate chips in them.

These were really good. It is a good recipe if you want good, healthy, made-from-scratch muffins. I used applesauce instead of apple butter, like most people. I think this has more of a fall/winter spice to it. I would need to be in the mood for the flavor.

I made these the other day and absolutely loved them!!! I did use applesauce instead of apple butter and 3/4 cup of brown sugar instead of 1 1/4 of white like other reviewers suggested. Also, i added extra raisins because i love them and next time I'll add a little more cinnamon. Overall though, these were great! and i love how healthy they are

I only made a couple of modifications (I used two whole eggs instead of the whole egg plus egg whites listed, and I didn't use any wheat germ). These were very good, with a slightly earthy flavor, but they were a bit sweet for me. I think next time I'll try sweetening them with fruit juice rather than sugar, but I'll definitely be making them again and again!

great for breakfast. a little sweet. I'll definitely make them again but maybe with a little less sugar. I might try incorporating a little of the wheat germ into the mix instead of just on top where most of it falls off when you eat them. Thanks for the recipe.

I made these just as stated and I thought these were good and moist. I didn't have wheat germ and walnuts so for looks I put some oats on top. Thanks for sharing.

These were so good.  A lot of work, but worth it.  Next time I'll double...or maybe quadruple the recipe and freeze.  Seriously yummy.  I used all applesauce instead of apple butter and oil.  I didn't have raisins so I used a dried fruit mix.

These were very yummy. Even my family who usually runs in the opposite direction when I make something healthy enjoyed these. I did make a few changes due to preference; I used all whole wheat flour, apple sauce instead of apple butter, only one cup of sugar, and 1/8 a cup of oil. I didn't put the walnuts or wheat germ on only because I didn't have any.

Very moist and so good! I stored the leftovers in the freezer and they were just as good rethawed as fresh! A perfect breakfast muffin because it is actually healthy.  I switched the amounts on the wheat flour and the white flour making the muffin mainly a wheat and I also reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup.

these were very good and nice to have as a grab and go breakfast. I didn't have any apple butter so i used apple sauce (not much of a difference) and left out the raisins (i hate raisins). My only complaint was that they get mushy after about two days even being wrapped up and stored in an airtight container. I ended up having to throw out my last three.

These are excellent!  Very moist and flavorful. I added some flax seed and used more whole wheat flour. Both of my children really enjoyed them and I think it is a pretty decent breakfast, also a good way to sneak in extra veggies.

Good recipe.  I changed a few things though, mostly due to likes/dislikes and what I had on hand.  Like others I took out the apple butter and oil and put in applesauce.  I left out the raisins because my husband doesn't like them.  I put the wheat germ in with the flour, left out the nuts (again nobody likes them) and topped the muffins with brown sugar.  Good recipe!  Thank you!!

Every time I make these they are perfectly moist and yummy! The only changes I made was using honey instead of sugar and equal parts whole wheat flour and white. Thanks for a sweet start!

Yummy!  Since it was my first time making these (or maybe I'm just slow), prep time took a lot more than just the 15 minutes.  But it was well worth it!  The muffins were delicious!

I seriously doubted that these would be very good. They are delicious.  I did make a few adjustments.  I put 1 1/2 tbsp oil in and then  1 1/2 tbsp almond butter in ( i will try 3 tbsp of almond next time) put 3 tbsp of wheat germ in. no raisins or walnuts (nut allergy) I did half white flour and half wheat. 1/3 cup choc chips (this is why I cut out some of the sugar) 1/4 c white sugar 1/2 cu brown sugar. 1 banana, cut out 1/2 cups of the carots. These were plenty sweet!! Loved it going to add oats next time!

These are the best! I left out the wheat germ, used only AP flour, tossed in some coconut and used two whole eggs. Next time I'd like to add some orange zest as one reviewer suggested. These are bakery quality.

I never have good luck with muffins, but these turned out wonderful!  I made a couple of changes only because of ingredients I had on hand. I used only all purpose flour since I had no wheat flour.  I used the carrots I had (about 3/4)cup and two apples instead of one. I ran them through the food processor. I did use the apple butter, which I think made the recipe.  The muffins turned out very moist, and the nutritional value is a plus.  I'll make these again.

I substituted the vegetable oil for applesauce. Also, I made only 12 muffins. Next time I make this, I would like to add some walnuts in the batter and secretly add flaked coconuts because husband despises coconuts. In addition, it took an extra 20 minutes to cook the muffins probably because I used applesauce rather than oil.

Wonderful muffins. My picky 3-year-old asked for third helpings of this. I did make a couple small changes because I know what I like...I'm not fond of wheat germ so I left that off with no problems (just sprinkled walnuts on top) and I used all all-purpose flour because I'm not usually fond of wheat flour in my sweet breads. (This one probably would have worked better than most, but I'll stick with my personal taste.)

This is my new favorite muffin! I halved the recipe and did as follows: Used applesauce instead of apple butter. I also added 1/4 cup Wheat Bran and a TBSP of ground Flax. So tasty and perfectly spiced. The other recipe I had was too bland! Thanks for the recipe!

These were really good, as others suggested and I do quite often. I used half oil and half applesauce. Omitted the raisins and wheat germ(personal preference. They were really moist and not too sweet. The family loved them, reminded us of the ones we used to get at the bakery in Disneyland. Nest time I think I'll replace the apples with pineapples...yummy!

Yum! I made these muffins even healthier by using all wheat flour and adding 1/3 cup flax seeds. I also used 2 apples, omitted the raisins (hate raisins), and added about a cup of toasted chopped walnuts (didn't do the wheat germ/walnut topping). They turned out great. Perfect for breakfast!

Great Recipe!  I had a few alterations.  I only used 1 c. of shredded carrots.  I was shredding baby carrots and it took way too long.  I think it was the right amount though.  Second, I used cinnamon apple sauce instead of apple butter.  I also added 1/4 c. of millet and left out the apples.  I put walnuts and rolled oats instead of wheat germ on the tops.

The muffins were wonderful.  The oats and walnuts on the top really took it up a notch.  The millet gave the muffins a wonderful crunch.  I will make this again.  Next time I will include the apple and I might add just a little bit of brown sugar.

Excellent, I use blueberries instead of raisins (only because I don’t like raisins). However I’m sure they are delicious with raisins as well) very good

Another winner! my family loved these muffins.  I didn't have apple butter and substitued real butter, was a little worried because the ingredients are so different but they still came out great. 

I also topped mine with Pampered Chef Cinnamon sprinkels and finely chopped almonds.

5, 10, 20 stars!  This recipe is delicious.  I've made it a bunch.  The only change I make is subbing applesauce, banana, or pumpkin for the oil and apple butter.  Yum!

Tasty, easy and healthy too!  I got 12 large and 12 mini muffins (mini ones took 15 minutes to bake) from the batter.  Cut the carrots amd apple fine if you're doing mini muffins.  I froze the remaining ones and will let you know how the handle the freezer.

Wow!  I hesitated b/c of the carrots, I didn't think that sounded good, but in my quest to make healthy and quick breakfasts for our morning commute to work and school, I gave these a try - wonderful!  So many recipes aren't quite "healthy" and if they are, they don't have the flavor - this has both!  I will puree the carrots next time b/c my daughter did question the orange color in her muffin.  I lied and told her they were a new kind of apple I bought - that worked for her.  I did not use raisins b/c of preference, had no apple butter, so used apple sauce, and used half the sugar - SO good, can't wait to try these with the apple butter instead.  I made them in a muffin top muffin pan and that made them the perfect size to bite into.   I am so glad to have a healthy AND tasty muffin -I can't wait to try variations.  The recipe is more labor intensive than other muffin recipes, but worth it, and I can always double batch.

There are not enough stars for this recipe!!!  I made these for my son and I who love muffins yesterday.  I didn't know what to expect when I saw how thick the batter was.  But we were in heaven eating these!!!  The thickness of the batter makes the muffins twice as good as thinner batter does.  They taste nutrious and yummy at the same time.  I had some cocunut and added a 1/2 cup and that made them twice as good.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!!

Really good - I added the wheat germ and finely chopped pecans (no walnuts) to the batter.  And I also used applesauce instead of apple butter.  I cut the sugar to 3/4 c but will probably go lower next time and will also add mashed bananas instead of the oil, and maybe some ground flaxseed for extra fiber.

I made these a while ago and recently found the recipe again.  A great muffin!  My 4 young kids love them - even my husband was sneaking them!!  I plan to make them again with lots of different variations.  These muffins are so easy to use different healthy mix-ins for variety!  I did use pumpkin butter instead of apple and I added ground flax seed, and dried cherries.  Again - SO GOOD!!

GREAT!  I love this muffin and the ones I buy are full of calories.  These are a great substitute.  I switched the flour measurements and the next time I'll use just whole wheat pastry flour.  I used a pear instead of an apple b/c that's what I had and I omitted the wheat germ b/c I didn't have any.  I also only added 1 cup of sugar and that was all that I needed. THANK YOU for the recipe.

This muffin recipe is amazing! Very, very good. The only changes I made were to NOT use raisins (yuck!) and I used one egg instead of the two whites. These were very moist, easy to make, and all out awesome.

These were very yummy!  I made a few changes, I used half whole wheat and a pear instead of an apple.  I used craisins instead of raisins, applesauce instead of oil.  I will reduce the amount of sugar next time because it was too sweet.

Really taste great and fills you up too! My oldest 2 DD and I made them for saterday morning breakfast and along with some fruit and milk we were set. One good plus is that the muffin mix looks horrible while your scooping it into the cups...why is that a plus you ask? The kids did not beg me to try it a million times ;)

We LOVED these muffins!  Like the other reviewer, we switched the amounts of whole wheat and regular flour.  We also added a combination of raisins and cranberries.  They are so healthy, but they really don't taste like it!!!

I doubled this recipe so all my values are doubled.  I made some changes due to what I had on hand.  I used 1 cup of apple sauce b/c I didn't have the butter and I reduced sugar to slightly less than 2 cups. half brown, half white. I also used 3 cups WW flour and 1 cup oats.  I grated my apples (mainly b/c I was so excited to use my new food processor :-)  )I gave this 4 stars only b/c I"m not a fan of the oil taste in muffins.  I should have melted butter and used that.

These are wonderful.  They take a little time to make with the fresh carrots and apples but are worth the trouble.  I didn't put the nuts or wheat germ on top thinking my kids may not like that.  Will make again & again!!!  Thanks for sharing.

I am eating a muffin while I write, and I have to say that these are quite lovely. 
I stuck pretty close to the original recipe, but used dried apricots instead of raisins, switched the amount of whole wheat and all purpose flour, applesauce instead of apple butter, and didn't put the nut topping on because I had no nuts on hand.
I would love to try cream cheese icing drizzled on them next time. Because there will be a next time. Yum!

Excellent base recipe. Preferring quick and simple, I substituted 15oz. cans of cooked carrots and a can of applesauce for the fresh carrots, apple and apple butter. I also used Splenda for half of the sugar. The muffins turned out very well, but I will only use 1/2 T of cinnamon next time.

I left out the raisins but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It was alot of prep work, but worth the effort. Very moist, and healthier than many muffin recipes. I did not think the cinnamon was overpowering at all.

Very good, but a little moist.  I think that I would add a bit more flour to dry them out a bit.  I did substitute apple sauce for apple butter like most people suggested.

These muffins were delicious! They came out perfect and I liked the recipe because they weren't at all greasy (but not at all dry, either)like some recipes for Morning Glory Muffins tend to be.

An excellent recipe!  I've also made a couple of changes (applesauce instead of apple butter; dates instead of raisins), but still a hit!

These would be great as is but for my own preference I used all white wheat flour. 1 cup of brown sugar instead of the white. Didn't use the topping just chopped nuts and added in. I usually shake a bit of cinnamon sugar over  my muffins anyway. Have made twice and my coworkers loved them.

OMG! So good. I made them twice and everyone loves them. I did make a couple changes: instead of 1 1/2cups all-purpose & 1/2 cup whole wheat flour I did... 1cup all-purpose flour & 1cup whole wheat flour. I also did 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce & 1/4 sweetened applesauce instead of 1/2 cup unsweetened. So yes I played with the recipe a bit and it was AWESOME! I’m sure it would be just as good if you did follow the recipe (unlike me). But this recipe deserves infinite stars. And you can’t even tell they are healthy. Plus they aren’t oily like the store bought ones (I find the store bought and drive thru ones are more like cake and very oily ??)

These were even better than I hoped! I did make some substitutions because of what was and was not in my pantry. I used all white flour, subbed dried cranberries for the raisins and used canned pumpkin instead of apple butter. Next time I might add a dash of ginger, too . . . but these were gone within 12 hours of leaving the oven, so there's no need to try and improve them! Just delicious!

I made these this morning. I did have to make a few changes due to allergies with a few ingredients. My two kids devoured the whole pan except for a few that I saved to take my picture of. I added 1 banana in place of 1 egg and then used 2/3 cup of applesauce and 1/3 cup of sweetened applesauce I made last year for the apple butter. My hubby said these were the best muffins he’s ever had with carrots and apples and has requested to have me make these more often.

I made some changes to make these even healthier— I used the salt, cinnamon, soda, & baking powder plus:
1/2c whole wheat flour
1/4c ground flax
1/4c chia seeds
1c white flour
1/2c sugar
I chopped the carrots & Granny Smith apple in my blender on ‘chop’ setting and substituted chopped dates for the raisins to compensate for the decrease in sugar. I used 2 whole eggs,  1/4c coconut oil, 1tsp vanilla, and 1/2c peanut butter made from PB2 in place of the apple butter. It made 9 x-large muffins that were moist, flavorful, & froze well. Go forth & eat healthy!

I will add more apple butter or apple sauce. I will double the apple chunks other than that the recipe was great. It is personal preference on the changes. I like the recipe.

Delicious!  Used silicone bake pan, did not have to grease it. Included nuts in batter, did not have wheat germ and used applesauce in place of apple butter. Definitely will make again.

Took longer than the 20 minutes prep time- gathering all the ingredients ( a lot of them)   grate carrots, chop apples etc. but well worth the time.  Moist and tasty.  Will definitely make again.

I used half a cup of extra virgin olive oil and 1 3/4 cups of applesauce and it still came out great! Had to keep it in the oven for 5 minutes extra though.

I made only three changes: I replaced the oil with a half cup creamed butter, I added half a cup of (farely finely) chopped walnuts to the batter, and I only had half a tablespoon of vanilla left in my cabinet :(.
Despite being short on vanilla, and the other changes I made these things were wonderful! 
I had to cook them longer than the recipe, closer to 25-30, but that could just be my oven. 
It’s a lot of measuring, but the end product is delish! Next time I make it I will try to sub the sugar with stevia or brown stevia. It’s a lot of sugar!

These were excellent!  Definitely a keeper.  I substituted apple sauce for apple butter and coconut oil for vegetable oil because that's what I had on hand.  Because the applesauce was sweetened I reduced the sugar to 1 cup.  Someone noted they seemed very thick without batter consistency which is true but don't worry, they cook up excellent.  Made exactly 12 muffins.  I also found the flavour deepened after they sat overnight.

These are really good. My picky two year old loves them. I used 1 cup apple sauce instead of apple butter and skipped the nuts. They are a little dense/moist. I might use 3/4 cup applesauce next time... or maybe I over mixed.... I think the nuts would be good too, but I ran out of time.

Super yummy muffins!!! I’ve made these many times and if I don’t have one or two ingredients I can always substitute them for something else without problems. Coconut and flax are also really good in these muffins!

I was looking for a recipe to use up some apple butter and came across this one.  Wow! These muffins were absolutely delicious and very moist.( I would buy apple butter just to make these!)
 I pretty much followed the recipe except ....I used two whole eggs instead of one whole egg and two egg whites, also I only had white flour on hand so I didn't use any whole wheat flour.  Oh, and I used craisins, just because we prefer them over raisins.  So, no huge changes.
As a side note, using standard muffin tins this made 23 muffins and could have been 24 as a few were a little overly full.

I left the carrots out - simply because I didn't have any - but these were delicious.

Omg these are so moist and delicious!  I made a few changes based off other reviews.  I made my own applesauce on this site and used the homemade applesauce to replace the apple butter and oil.  I also reduced the sugar to  a cup using 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup white.  Next time I'll reduce the sugar a bit more as it can pass for a little less sweetness for us.  This is such a fabulous recipe.  Thank you for sharing!  I will be making this over and over again!

I made it in a large glass pan and topped with sliced almonds instead of walnuts. I also subbed flax seed (about 1/2 cup) for wheat germ and mixed it in the batter instead of putting it on top... turned out SO DELICIOUS! I also put the carrots and apple in a blender with all of the liquid ingredients before mixing in with everything else.

I had my hopes up but was disappointed in this recipe .  Not moist enough and lacked the full flavor I was hoping for. Will not make it again.

This has become a weekly recipe for me. We all love these muffins as a delicious go to snack.  But we also love them as a healthier alternative for dessert. Top a warm muffin with  a little vanilla ice cream...YUM!       I omitted the raisins because none of us like them and used applesauce instead of apple butter just because I always have applesauce on hand.  Even to my pickiest eater these are delicious!

I made these muffins today and they are the BOMB! Yum! Family loved them.  I did reduce the raisins to half a cup and added half a cup unsweetened coconut shreds. I think next time I may reduce the sugar to one cup because the apple butter I used is very sweet. I also mixed in the walnuts and wheat germ so they wouldn't be crumbly when taken in the car for on the go breakfasts. Very moist...almost like carrot cake muffins. Give these a try!

This recipe turned out great!  I didn't have whole wheat flour so used all-purpose flour in the amount of 2 cups.  Substituted applesauce for the apple butter and pecans for the walnuts (not a fan).  I also used the baking raisins which I now buy because they are so much more moist.  This recipe will be my new "go-to for muffins.

I  made these once but with about half the sugar and more nuts.   You can really play with this basic recipe.  I have now made them several times.  I substituted flax meal and chia seed for 2/3 cup of the flour and added more wheat germ.  Also used a small can of crushed pineapple, more applesauce and 1/2 cup coconut sugar for the white sugar. I used 1/2 cup walnuts, too.  These are very dense, filling, and a bit healthier.  They freeze well--if there are any left!

I used matchstick carrots, should have grated carrots for a finer texture especially if you make into mini muffins. Went to 4 stores before I found wheat germ, and really it was not needed. They would have been fine without any topping (wheat germ/walnuts). Made them for my 4 year old, and she is unsure. Will probably try another healthy-ish muffin recipe next time.

These are AMAZING, and not difficult at all.  Great for a crowd or just to have on hand.  I literally can't stop eating them. 

I used pecans instead of walnuts, and flax seed instead of wheat germ--both substitutions were absolutely fine.  Next time, I would use slightly less sugar.  Instead of apple butter and oil, I used 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce.  I also added shredded coconut.  I used two small apples.  I did not use muffin liners and there was no problem with sticking as long as a nonstick spray is used on the tins.

Yummmy! I sprinkled some raisins on top with the nuts and they get a chewy texture. Didn't have wheat germ so I used flax seed. Used apple sauce in place of apple butter. Very hearty and delicious! This recipe is going into my favorites file which only gets my very favorite recipes from this site.

This is a great base recipe and is easily modified. I made quick homemade applesauce (with some accidentally caramelized apples, which actually worked out really well) because I didn't have any apple butter. I used 1 cup of shredded carrots, 1 finely chopped apple,  1/2 cup shredded coconut (sweetened but rinsed), 1/2 cup golden raisins, 1/2  cup dried currants, and 1/2 cup fresh cranberries, halved. I didn't have any wheat germ, so I toasted 3 tbs of chopped walnuts and mixed them directly into the batter. I needed to add another 1/2 cup or so of applesauce because I increased the add-ins so much. I also baked these for about 5 minutes longer than the recipes calls for -- again, I think, because of my add-ins. The muffins came out perfectly, and next time I would add even more cranberries. Thanks so much.

I made a few minor revisions based on my pantry and kid preferences but these are a huge hit with my family. Instead of raisins I used 1/2 cup craisins and 1/2 cup unsweetened shredded coconut. Rather than walnuts in the topping I used pumpkin seeds to make them school safe. Winning recipe!  Thanks for sharing.

Used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup white. Reduced sugar to 1 cup. Used 3 eggs for more protein. Had enough batter for 12 muffins and 12 mini-muffins. Came out great.

This is a great recipe, makes very delicious muffins.  I doubled the recipe (to have some in the freezer) and substituted half applesauce for the oil.  I will make this recipe again but use unsweetened applesauce in place of the apple butter just to reduce calories and keep the high fructose out.  These muffins freeze well and are easily popped into the microwave for a couple of minutes on medium heat for a quick breakfast.

Everyone absolutely loved these!!  I changed it up just a little bit.  I left out the wheat germ.  I also left out the extra egg whites and used 2 whole eggs instead.  Added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp ground ginger.  I used 1/2C raisins partially re-hydrated in 1/4C of Pinot Grigio (about 1 hour). Changed the walnuts to 1/2C chopped Pecans and lightly toasted them.
It will make 8-10 Jumbo muffins, baking 25-30 minutes.

This recipe is great as is or easy to adapt to what you have on hand. I had a soft pear that needed to be used, so I mashed it up and used it in place of the apple butter. I also decreased the sugar to  one cup because pears are pretty sweet. So yummy. I always use two cups whole wheat flour, too, and it works just fine.

This recipe is amazing!!!!  I was looking for a muffin recipe that could get my 19 month old to eat some vegetables.  I love that this muffin is packed with carrots, apples and raisins.  I made it exactly as written, except I substituted apple sauce since I could not find apple butter.  These are a little more work than most other muffins I make, but I used the Cuisinart to grate the carrots, which made it a little quicker.  I see myself making these again and again!  They really fill your house with a delicious aroma!

The first time I made these I made them according to the recipe except that I shredded the apple and used applesauce instead of apple butter.  Since then I have made them several different ways to include adding oatmeal for part of the flour (1 cup ww flour, 1/2 cup AP flour, 1 cup regular or steel cut oats); different fruits/vegetables (zucchini, banana, blueberries, canned pumpkin, chopped dates, crushed/dried pineapple, coconut); using banana, yogurt, applesauce or coconut oil for the vegetable oil; add the wheat germ and nuts to the muffins instead of sprinkling on top; reduced sugar to 1 cup and have used either brown sugar or honey.  This is a pretty versatile and forgiving recipe that you can adjust to your own/family likes.  They are good as written but adjust easily to our own likes.  Definitely a keeper and one I make often for a quick breakfast or snack and a great way to get those picky kids to eat fruits and vegetables.  By reducing the sugar and substituting the oil it reduces the calories by almost 60 calories.

Happened to have some pumpkin butter on hand - was perfect. Used food processor for apple and carrot. Recipe qty was perfect. I made half batch and got 9 cupcakes.

These muffins were surprisingly easy to make.  Instead of two cups of carrots I used one cup of zucchini and one cup of carrots.  Also instead of raisins I used milk chocolate chips.  And after they've cooled from being in the oven I topped them off with butter. I will definitely make these again!

These are absolutely wonderful! All the peeling and shredding is a lot of work but worth it to me. Luckily, my food processor helps with the shredding. I cut the sugar back to a little over 3/4 c and found them to still be extremely sweet. I will cut it back to 1/2 c next time, as I prefer more of the grainy taste. I used 1 c wheat flour and 1 c white and added 3 tbs of flaxseed meal to the batter. They are just so flavorful and fun.

These are awesome!  Made with whole wheat white flour,  applesauce in place of oil, decreased sugar to 3/4 cup  sugarin the raw. I also added 1/2 can of pureed garbanzo beans and a pear with the apple. I added the nuts into the mixture. I left out the raisins but only because I didn't have any. Will make these very often! !

Very yummy.  We grate the apple instead of chopping it, and I have either warmed the raisins in some apple juice and then pureed before adding, or just left them out.  I usually leave out the walnuts because my husband doesn't care for them, but I'm considering food-processing them and then adding them in next time.

I am looking forward to baking these muffins but have a question to the people that suggest using a food processor for the carrots & apples.  Do you use the grate attachment or pulse/chop these ingredients?

These muffins are great. Minor modifications were made because I didn't have wheat germ and only two eggs on hand. I used two whole eggs and added some flax seed, and the remainder of the recipe was exact. I made mini muffins that were moist and delicious and the apples were a great addition. My daughters told me that this was their new favorite muffin.I had to put them away immediately or my family was going to devour them all!

I liked this, and my husband said it's "Good for healthified"--that's high praise from him! They are a little dense since there's not a lot of fat, and they also take more mixing than most muffin recipes. I only had baby carrots, and I really wish I'd followed another suggestion to use a food processor. Doing it by hand took way too long! When I make this in the future, I'll either do that or use full size carrots. BTW, the carrots aren't really detected in the finished product, even though they have the texture of shaved coconut in the raw batter.

I scaled this to 12 muffins. The website calculated most ingredients as needed, but I made a couple more adjustments for that quantity: 1 whole egg plus 1 egg white, 1 whole apple, 1 cup carrots.

Update: I made them again but subbed 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce for the egg whites. This resulted in a moister, more tender muffin. I'll definitely do this in the future! Full size carrots worked better than baby, but it still took so long to shred by hand that I'll probably stick with a food processor from now on.

I liked these a lot, but family members weren't thrilled about the amount 'stuff' vs. the amount of batter. If I make this again I will cut down on the 'stuff'.

I love these! I make them as written, although I confess I add a little brown sugar to the wheat germ/walnut topping to make it more of a strudel topping. It's a perfect little sweet treat for breakfast that makes you feel good about your choices!

I also modified a little. I DID use apple butter but left out the chunks of apple. I also used Splenda instead of sugar. These turned out great!  I put mine in for 15 minutes and they didn't seem cooked enough so I left them in for another 3. When I make them again a think I will  just shut off the heat at 15 and let them continue to cook for a couple more minutes only. They were a tad on the dry side. Great muffin if you like a raisin carrot cake!!

These are AWESOME. Probably the best carrot muffins I'm ever had, and one of the best things I've put in my mouth. The batter is thick, and the muffins themselves are chock full of taste and fun mouth-feel. I made mini-muffins and still cooked them for 13 mins. 
I made them for the guys at work at they disappeared. Not bad for a shop of metal fabricators- especially for something so low in fat.
I added the nuts to the mixture. 
I topped with the wheat germ+some strudel topping I had.

All I could say is AMAZING!! My daughter & hubby loved them.  I didn't have wheat germ so I used almonds and walnuts finely chopped.

Loved these muffins.  Didn't use walnuts or wheat germ and they were awesome.  Make sure to cube apples in very small chunks.

Just made these and eating one right now straight out of the oven - they are delish!!!  Only changes I made were I left out the raisins (family doesn't like them) added 1/3 cup chopped and toasted walnuts in the batter and then to the topping (didn't have any wheat germ) added 1/4 cup quick oats, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 tbls. flour, and 2 tbls. melted butter to the chopped walnuts. I love these muffins just wish I didn't have to dirty everything in the kitchen to make them. LOL

Great recipe and so versatile.  Didn't have apple butter so used pears instead and added some more cinnamon.  Very good!!!  Like dessert - they reminded me of carrot cake muffins! - Update:  this time I substituted applesauce for the apple butter and put in a whole egg instead of the egg white, added a bit of extra cinnamon spice.  Delicious!

I had received a jar of Apple Butter from a local merchant so I made these muffins this afternoon - a perfect way to spend a rainy, windy day.    I ate one while it was still warm with a little smear of cream cheese - amazing and delish!!  The proof that I was right came from my son who declared his sample to be "very good!"   I also messed around with the recipe.  Half and half on the flour, cut back on the cinnamon and added a little ground ginger.  I also went half and half on the raisins (used golden) and added the rest of the cup as craisins.  I omitted the nuts and wheatgerm.  I used foil cups but only had enough batter for a dozen.  Will definitely re-use this recipe and perhaps substitute unsweetened apple sauce for the apple butter, as the muffins are on the sweet tasting side.  I used a Honeycrisp apple so that might have added to the overall sweetness.  This recipe is a keeper.

These were great with a bowl of soup for lunch.  I changed by using applesauce in place of apple butter.  Also used a whole egg in addition to the white.  I needed to add milk for moisture.

I added 1/4  cup of blueberries, 1/2 teaspoon of powdered ginger and orange zest. There were delicious.  Very moist. Will definitely make these again. Used my own apple butter. Best muffins I have made.

These muffins are outrageously good. I followed the recipe with one minor exception. I didn't have raisins on hand, so I used dried currants instead. I was looking for a recipe to use my homemade crabapple butter and this one fit the bill. Next time, I might add walnuts into the batter. I highly recommend.

Made these muffins and had rave reviews...only thing I changed was the amount of sugar.Made it one cup only,with adding the apple butter it was sweet enough and I chopped the apples just a bit smaller.I will definately make these again!

Just finished making these muffins and I have already eaten a few as well as my four year old son.  My husband isn't home yet but hopefully we can hold off long enough for him to enjoy as well.  Thanks for the wonderful muffin recipe!!  YUM!!

I just took this recipe out of the oven 15 minutes ago and these muffins are fantastic. I did not have raisins so I used an equal amount of Craisins. I had to omit the nuts due to a nut allergy, I used 1 tablespoon sugar and 2 tablespoons toasted wheat germ for the topping. The cupcakes are moist and very flavorful. I will be using variations of this recipe often.

I made these muffins this morning and my fiance and I loved them.  I used only white flour, applesauce instead of Apple butter and didn't use the topping. They came out super moist and smelled wonderfully like cinnamon.  I made 12 muffins and 3 mini loaves since I couldn't find my other muffin pan. Will definitely make these again!

I just made these.  Very yummy.  I didn't have apple butter, so I substituted 1/2 peanut butter 1/2 regular butter.  I added extra cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves to spice it up a bit, and I doubled the apples.  Turned out just great. For winging it!  Recipie made 2 dz regular sized muffins.

I used two whole eggs instead of the egg and egg whites.  What a hit! The 4yo wanted to eat the batter without baking it.

I also substitute my homemade applesauce for the cut apple and apple butter just because that's what I have around.  I use the honey wheat germ and don't bother to pretoast it.  Just spoon it over the muffins.  I make the large size muffins so I tend to lower the oven temperate and cook and little longer.  They have a natural sweetness, good hot or cold.

I had to make a few changes - most notable was substituting rhubarb compote for the apple butter.  It took a couple minutes longer to cook but still tasted great.  My wheat germ was dubious so I skipped that.  Also I omitted peeling the apple but just grated it along with the carrot in the food processer; can't tell the difference.

Just made my first batch and they are incredible!  I don't know how the reviewer who didn't have enough batter messed them up, but I had plenty - a dozen reg sized and 2 dozen minis for my macaw - who gave them several "yums" - his highest rating.  I happened to find some really nice zucchini the day before so made them 1/2 carrot & 1/2 zucchini & I also used dried mixed berriess instead of raisins, flax instead of wheat germ and 1/2 white, 1/2 wheat pastry flour.  I did use paper cups - mistake!  The muffins stuck to the paper but the minis popped right out.

Very good, but I changed quite a bit. I had bananas I needed to use up, so I mashed them and substituted it for the oil and apple butter. I also cut out most of the suger, but added some molasses (also needed to use those up) and nutmeg. Will definitely make these again.

sooo good! eating one right now. Followed the recipe except for the apple butter (used 1 c. applesauce). Next time I will halve the oil and use more whole wheat flour vs white flour. They are so moist!

These are to die for. They are super healthy but are almost a no-sacrifice option. I soaked the carrots, raisins, and apples pieces in a bit of water, honey, and vanilla. Next time I will use a bit less sugar and bake for a shorter time. I threw in some chopped pecans. To spruce them up I'll smear some cream cheese on the top and drizzle with raw honey. So amazing, in permanent recipe collection!

Made these muffins today and the only thing I changed was the omission of the wheat germ because I didn't have any.  They are delicious!  So moist and yummy.  I'm bringing a dozen to work to share.

These muffins are absolutely delicious!!  My weekend guests said they were the best muffin they had ever eaten.  A definite keeper.  The only thing I might do differently next time is to go ahead and stir the walnuts and wheatgerm into the batter instead of sprinkling on top.  Some of the topping will fall off when you tilt the muffin and I like a no fuss grab and go and eat in the car breakfast and don't won't to worry about crumb topping falling off the muffin.  Just picky me.  FANTASTIC muffin recipe!!!!!!

I loved this recipe!  Turned out moist and delicious.  I replaced the apple butter with apple sauce, reduced the sugar to 3/4 instead of the requested 1 1/4 cup and replaced the walnuts with shredded coconuts.  All 18 were gone within 24 hours.

Will be making these again soon.  I did add a handfull of blueberries and sub the apple butter with 1/2 c applesauce. Also a tsp of nutmeg, and sub walnuts with almonds. Think the walnuts would be a big plus for me, just didn't have any on hand today.  Thanks, love this one...someone commented that there is very little batter and to much fruit and veggies.  IMO, that's just how i like it

Great for my one-year-old!  These are even better than I thought they would be!  I made them without raisins or walnuts (but still used the wheat germ on top) so I could freeze them for my one-year old.  An easy thing to pack for his lunches at daycare!  The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because the clean-up is a pain - anything that involves the food processor is annoying to me.  Next time I make them, I will make a double batch.

Very good, I cut the recipe in 1/2 and pulsed the carrots in the food processor.  I upped the raisens by a 1/4 c. on the 1/2ed recipe and also still do 1 full egg and then 1 additional full egg instead of just the egg white.  Excellent this way, also used applesauce as others had mentioned vs. applebutter.  For those who wanted more batter the extra egg should help with that.  Also didn't have wheat bran so I made a streusal of flour,butter, brown sugar and pecans.  Excellent!

Delicious and healthy! I used a cup of applesauce instead of apple butter and oil and lowered the sugar to 3/4 of a cup. The cut up apple was a perfect sweetness.  I also used flax seed in the batter instead of wheat germ. I'd love to think of a way to incorporate oatmeal in it.

Followed the directions almost exactly as they were, except I substituted dried cranberries for raisins. The muffins are delicious - moist and very flavorful. A keeper!

This is my absolute favourite muffin recipe. I usually use 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 cup whole wheat. I also usually add another apple to the recipe. And like the other reviews said, I used applesauce instead of apple butter.
Alternatively, you can use mashed banana or creamed coconut in place of the apple butter.

Gave it four stars only because i changed a few things. I used 2 golden appeles, probably a little more carrots than called for and I used a food processor for the apples and carrots as suggested in other reviews. I also didnt have any wheat germ or walnuts. I mixed some brown sugar with pecans for the topping. My whole family loved them.

This is now my go to muffin recipe! My kids gobble them up-- little do they know they are good for them! I have made them with applesauce when I don't have apple butter on hand, they are still good but better with the apple butter. All of the chopping and grating is worth it for these muffins!

no apple butter.  Instead used butter.  No oil.  Instead applesauce.  Was ok.  Husband liked.  I thought it wasn't sweet enough.  It was lacking but I smothered it in peanut butter and it was good.  ^_^

Alterations: 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1 cup flour, food processor for carrots and apples, 1 cup applesauce, no apple butter or oil, topped with nuts. Fantastic for a healthy muffin recipe.

These tasted just like the morning glory muffins I used to buy at Win-Co.  So good.  I substituted pumpkin butter for the apple butter and used the "change servings" calculator to make an even 2 dozen muffins so my quantities were a bit different.  I wound up adding a bit more oil, pumpkin butter, and egg than calculated in order to make it easier to mix.

Substituted the apple butter and butter out by using apple sauce. 
Used almonds and flax seed to sprinkle on top rather than walnuts and wheat germ.
Swapped the sugar amounts (brown and white) and it was too sweet for me. Will cut sugar amounts next time.
Hubby loved them and said he would've never guessed that it had no butter.

I had to make some adjustments due to dietary restrictions and ingredients at hand.  I used 1 cup all purpose flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour, replaced the apple butter and vegetable oil with 1/3 cup pureed pears, cut sugar to 1 cup, used 2 whole eggs instead of 1 egg and egg whites and omitted the nuts.  These were moist and delicious.  I will definitely make these again, but will probably use a little less sugar as the fruit made it sweet enough for us.  I don't think there is any way to go wrong with this recipe.

This is my new favorite muffin!! I love it!! I made a few changes due to other reviews I read. I put 2 cups of all-purpose flour because I had no whole wheat flour. 1 cup sugar instead of 1 1/4 cups, 2 eggs instead of 1 egg and 2 egg whites, 1 cup apple sauce instead of 1/2 cup of apple butter, 1/2 cup walnuts in with the muffin mixture, and oatmeal instead of wheat germ. Baked for 20 mins and they where perfect! So moist and tasty! The mixture I made  up seemed at first really dry but I let it sit for a few minutes and it became a lot better.

Made these muffins for the first time today.  Wow!  The family raved over them!  Like many reviewers I did substitute applesauce for the apple butter, and I used part Splenda and part sugar, also used 2 whole eggs rather than 1 egg and two egg whites.  This is one of those recipes that gives you the opportunity to adjust it your way and it still comes out fabulous!  (If you substitute applesauce for the applebutter, it may need to cook a few minutes longer.) Thank you JACLYN for sharing!!

Deliciously amazing. I modified for less sugar & more protein & allergy needs:
unsweetened applesauce and ground cloves instead of apple butter, splenda brown sugar blend to cut the sugar back, almonds instead of walnuts, whole eggs for more protein than just egg whites, oatmeal instead of whole wheat flour, I didn't have wheat germ, so I put steel cut oats on top

Pretty good. I suppose there is just a little too much going on for me, maybe. I didn't hate them, they were OK, but I wouldn't make them again. It was alot of work for lackluster results.

After reading several reviews and desiring a no refined sugar/whole grain option I made the following adjustments and my kids RAVED.  (I was worried they'd taste "the healthy".):  For the 1 1/2 c. all purpose flour I substituted 1 c. whole wheat pastry and 1/2 c. oat flour.  For the sugar I substituted 1 c. sucanat natural sugar.  I added 1/2 t. of baking powder because of the oat flour.  I used 2 eggs instead of the 1 egg and 2 egg whites.  Per others suggestions I substituted applesauce for the apple butter and olive oil for the vegetable oil.  Totally by accident, I chopped too many walnuts so the topping was very nutty but everyone loved that!  I freeze muffins to put in my kids lunches--thawed by lunch & they love it.  Thanks for adding to my options!

SUPER moist, great recipe!

Great Recipe- just like mom used to make. I did make some adjustments- substituted 1/2 the white sugar for brown sugar for a fuller flavor, and mixed the walnuts right in with everything else. I omitted the wheat germ and sprinkled whole bran on top.

These are crazy delicious! Very moist and worth all the prep. I too substituted applesauce for the apple butter and oil, and I used 1 c of regular flour and 1 c of whole wheat. I also used Craisins instead of raisins. I forgot the last step (the topping) but I never even noticed! Make sure to REALLY grease the pan.

Yummy, cooked just like instructions, but with less oil and sugar. They were still delicious. Next time I will try using with whole wheat flour instead.

I can't say enough about these muffins! We just made them and oh wow...so good. They really remind me of a Scottish Dumpling I grew up on but in muffin form. I did add some chopped canned pineapple too. I got a full tray plus one mini tray of muffins. I also used the applesauce in place of apple butter. Had no raisins but used currants! These were so wonderful and thank you so much for a great recipe. Any way to sneak in a veg is top notch in my books!!

I followed the previous recommendations to reduce the amt of oil to 1/2 cup and substituted brown sugar for amt of sugar called for.  The other alteration I made was in the amt of baking soda.  I hate the aftertaste of too much baking soda in baked goods.  I reduced the amt to 1 teaspoon and added 1 teaspoon of baking powder.  I filled a standard cupcake pan (12) to the top, sprayed the exposed rims with Pam and baked as directed.  The muffins came out picture perfect and none of the tops stuck to the pan.

Good muffins, be careful they do stick in the pan.  I greased my silicone muffin pan and they still needed easing out.  Otherwise pretty good flavor, texture is a little cake like.  Used all whole wheat flour and they were still good.

I made a batch of these this morning and my kids, both boys, ages 6 and 8, agreed that they were good.  I thought they were fantastic!  I think the kids would have liked them more if I had been able to follow the recipe and add the apple.  As it was, I did not have an apple, so I used another cup of grated carrots, which I think is why the boys said they were good but not great.  Next time I'll make sure I have an apple before I start. (P.S. The boys just came in and asked me for another muffin - and promoted them from good to great! :) )

These are the best!  I use craisins instead of raisins.  These are perfect for a breakfast on-the-go, and good to get everyone eating something heathy to start their day.

These were absolutely delicious!  I made them egg-free for my niece with allergies, but they were still very good.  I can only imagine how good they would have been with the richness of the egg!

So tasty! I used Applesauce instead of Apple butter, and that made them just a hair too sweet. Next time, I will use less sugar, and probably use brown sugar. I made a double batch of these, and they were eaten within a week. I have received much praise for this one!

These were very good!  I made some changes to simplify it a bit.  I chopped up a can of carrots (didn't measure, just used the whole can), used two eggs instead of one egg and two egg whites, regular butter with about 1/2 tsp apple pie spice instead of apple butter (didn't have any), and applesauce in place of oil.  I omitten the wheat germ because I couldn't find it in the store.  Even with all the changes, these were very good! I'll definately make these again, next time I'll follow the recipe as written (except for the oil) and they'll be even better!

Delicious, relatively healthy muffins. Like most morning glory muffins, they are more time consuming to make than many other types of muffins, but worth it. I think next time I will cut down on the sugar a bit, maybe to 1 cup, as the raisins and apple add a fair amount of sweetness. Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome muffins!  Modified with 1/2 white 1/2 whole wheat flour.Used Splenda instead of sugar, and apple sauce instead of apple butter. Skipped the wheat germ on top, mixed the walnuts with pinch of cinnamon. Don't have to feel guilty about eating these muffins!

These were soooo delicious! I made them as is, only adding some crushed pineapple and subbing dried cranberries for the raisins and subbing pecans for the walnuts! All the textures are great, and this recipe made two dozen for me. I will definitely be making these again!

Loved these muffins. Replaced the oil with a mashed banana to reduce the fat and sprinkled a little oatmeal and brown sugar on the top. Very moist and even the carrot haters in my family enjoyed them!

These are just delightful!!  I did make some changes based on what I had available in the kitchen.  I didn't have raisens, wheat germ, or walnuts so I replaced that with craisens (left over from holiday cooking), oat bran and pecans...very tasty and the cranberries made it so sweet!!  I used no oil, 3/4 c. apple butter and 1/4 c. applesauce.  I also used two apples instead of one (I felt mine were a bit smallish).  The result was very moist and needed to be baked a bit longer (about 25 minutes due to the higher moisture in the apples).  This is a great recipe... if only I can stop eating more than one at a sitting they would be "healthier".

quite a few ingredients and the texture is sort of chewy like lowfat stuff can be but it is tasty.  I might add pineapple next time and maybe some nuts in it.

My husband and oldest son liked these.  I used almonds instead of walnuts and pumpkin butter instead of apple butter.  My muffins caved in the middle, but this was my fault.  I am going to try making this a quick bread.  I am still in search of a semi healthy breakfast option that everyone will eat!

I loved these muffins, my 10 year old son loved them too.  The only thing we did different, was substituted the sugar with 1 cup of Splenda.  I might also try substituting the apple butter with apple sauce like another reveiw said.  I gave these a 5, but my son said 3.5, so we'll give it an even 4.  Definately making these again.

I used equal parts WWF and all purpose flour, with a few tablespoons of bran mixed in.  Chop apples into small pieces, makes the muffins easier to eat.  I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and it was still pretty sweet.  I added a handful of coconut.  I used equal parts apple butter and unsweetened applesauce.  When my batch of fall apple butter is gone I am sure applesauce will work fine.  I also reduced the oil and will possibly substitute with applesauce next time.  I forgot the nuts but still sprinkled wheat germ on the top.  Great recipe and they freeze well!

Wow, this is a great little breakfast muffin.  I did have to make a few changes because of what I had, but the end result was perfect.  No walnuts, extra apples and raisins.  Cut the sugar down a bit, and used applesauce instead of apple butter.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I followed the "original" recipe and these were yummy!  I made them for my "health nut" boyfriend and he really likes them.  The one thing we both agreed on though was that they were too sweet.  We will try honey next time instead of sugar.

Delicious! I modified it a bit, I used Spleda sugar blend instead of the sugar same measurments, egg substitute instead of the 1 egg and used 1 cup frozen blueberries in place of the raisins. They came out wonderful, so tasty and you cant even tell Spelnda was used. Next time I think I might use applesauce instead of the oil to make it even healthier.

These muffins turned out excellent! This recipe works well when you don't want to go out to the grocery store, because you can modify it so easily. I used 2 c. whole wheat flour instead of the mix. I also reduced the sugar, making it 1/2 c. white and 1/2 c. brown. I only used 1 c. of carrots because that's all I had. I also used 1/2 c. raisins and 1/2 c. Craisins. I used peach butter in place of apple butter. And finally, I did not have wheat germ available, so instead I simply included the 2 tbsp. chopped walnuts in the batter and added 2 tbsp. Quaker oats. They were delicious and perfectly fit 18 muffin cups. They are great for breakfast, healthy, and hearty to boot! Definitely recommend these!

I searched long & hard for apple butter as I really wanted to try these muffins. Eventually found it in the organic section of our grocery store & it was worth the search. The muffins are great, don't be put off by the long list of ingredients.

My husband and I LOVE these muffins. I added flax seed and used Splenda in mine. WOW they are so good. They are very filling so we end up eating on these muffins for a couple of days.
