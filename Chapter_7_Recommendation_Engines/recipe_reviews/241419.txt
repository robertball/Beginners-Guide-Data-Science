I made this recipe (or one exactly like this) just before Thanksgiving 2014.  I made it because it is so similar to the Norwegian Lefse recipe (there is one on this site) that I make and I was curious.  I made it as directed and it tasted very similar to Lefse.  I rolled some of the dough paper thin, like we do for lefse, and it was identical.  Lefse adds a pinch of sugar, for browning, and some cream for a moister dough and also is cooked on a dry griddle. This recipe is a treat and because you don't roll it so thin, it's much easier to make.  I'll make this again!  It's wonderful to eat plain with a little butter or you can spread it with jam.  Try it, it's a wonderfully tender bread.

I make this exact recipe, altho I like abit of green onion and garlic sprinkled in mine. My husband was born and raised in Ireland, and there, they call this farl.  one thing to note, depending on how wet your potatoes are, you should adjust your flour accordingly.this is a great and easy recipe.  Also it's easily tweaked to suit your family's taste. one of my  favorites alterteration... even tho It's not traditional is to add a nice slice of Monterrey jack on top when it's nearly done..so it's all melty... omg. YUM

good recipe for 'tattie ' scones but not enough flour- my mum states that you keep on adding until the potato can't take any more.  In other words until it forms a firm dough.Enjoy with square (Lorne) sausage & plain (Scottish)  bread.

Agreeing with another review here, you cannot use exact measurements for this to work, potatoes are different and some will be more watery than others. Pick a good mashing potato (russet etc) and for ME took more flour. Basically if your dough is still sticking to things, its needs more flour… I also think adding finely chopped onions and a bit of garlic powder adds to the flavor but that is preference..  Oh and you can use “All purpose” flour if that is all you have but as recipe suggests use self rising if possible.

I've made this several times. It's been delicious every time. Like someone else says, the amounts of the ingredients aren't set in stone. It depends on the moisture amount in the potatoes.

Delicious. I may have made them thicker than in the authentic way,  but they were yum.  Some other reviews said they added a lot more flour.  I only added a little more.  I want to taste potatoes not flour.  I added a teaspoon of vegetable stock powder,  chives and a touch of garlic powder.

I read this recipe several times - 4 oz of flour seemed too little.  What I got for the first batch were gigantic, gummy gnocchi.  So I doubled the flour. Not much improved.  I am certain I followed the recipe exactly.  These are like unfortunate potato pancakes when I tried it.
