This recipe was a disaster for me also.  It sounded so good.  If you're looking for a white fudge receipe, pick a different one!

This turned out awful.  Attempted to make this twice and both times it was a disaster.  I really feel that something was left out of the recipe as there is no way that this can ever resemble white fudge!

This recipe didn't work for me either.  I think a step was left out.  My grandmother made a wonderful white fudge when I was a child.  This recipe sounded close to hers, but it turned out horrible.

Sounds like the author meant to write something similar to a "twice cooked" or "no fail" DIVINITY recipe.  Not that the recipe title is necessarily inaccurate; long ago divinity was commonly called "divinity fudge." The amount of water sounds waaay too little (I would guess an amount closer to 1 1/2 cups) and the instructions certainly neglect to mention that the syrup is added to egg whites that have been BEATEN to STIFF PEAKS (as in any recipe for divinity).  So if you would like to achieve something like this recipe's intended result--theoretically, at least--a nougaty white concoction studded with pecans (yum)--I would suggest searching for a twice cooked or no fail divinity recipe.

This ended up being a "trainwreck."  Too bad, since it sounded like a great
non-chocolate candy.  My fault for not reading the reviews first.

with my twist instead of nuts I used 1 cup shredded coconut and 1/2 cup of tested coconut. very good and also a little chewy.
