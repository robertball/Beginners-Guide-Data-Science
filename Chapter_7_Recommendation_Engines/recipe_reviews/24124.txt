Not great, though I sauteed instead of steamed the spinach, drained and dried, and still too much liquid.  Little to no taste.  The best part was the puff pastry. Won't use this one again.

When I tried this I did squeeze out the spinach.  I found the flavor to be really good, and my husband loved it.  Next time I'll add more mushrooms and as suggested in the previous review I'll saute them first. This has a really good flavor and nice presentation for little work.  Thank you Sara!

Way too much liquid in the bottom of the casserole when I took it out of the oven.  If I made it again I would not only drain the spinach, I would squeeze it dry.  I also would saute the mushrooms first to get the liquid out of them as well.  The flavor was good and with these changes I might give it more stars next time.

To thicken this up a bit more I would add mashed potatoes (made thick), probably a cup or so, you could also use the mashed potatoes as a top instead of the puff pastry as well. I use fat free plain greek yogurt in place of sour cream in all of my cooking & it is a great substitute, it is extra thick & creamy!

I like my flavors, and this, to me, was very very bland. I even tried using Cream of Mushroom soup for added flavor instead of sour cream but still it was super 'BLAH'. Won't make again unless I can think of some serious herbs to add.

As written, bland and would have been very watery. I sauted everything and squeezed the spinach dry so it wasnt an issue. This needs seasonings very badly... I added salt and pepper along the way and it wasn't enough.  Onions and garlic would help as well as some spices... and I;d even season the puff pastry
