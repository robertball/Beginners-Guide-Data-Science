I thought this was pretty good, but my husband and family didn't care for it so i probably won't be making this again. My sister advised me to add some sour cream if i would make it again.  It does have potential, i think.

If I ever make this recipe again, I will double the amount of vegetables at least.

Despite my best efforts, my beautiful mold didn't turn out, but the salad was pretty good.  I used sugar free  gelatin and substituted canned pineapple for the olives because I was afraid it might not taste good and I knew my husband would enjoy it better this way.  I also made a dressing from light mayo, light sour cream, and splenda.
I would make this again.

My mom made a version of this we hated as kids.  But I miss my mom and this salad which I now love!  Ingredients are canned pineapple, chopped celery, shredded carrots, walnuts and green olives.  I made a large box of lime Jello with speed set method, then ingredients...chock full.  Jello started setting right away!  I made another batch of jello and added more ingredients to fill to rim!  Hubby thinks it's  vile as he hates olives but I think the olives are what make this divine!  Speed set method is the way to go.
