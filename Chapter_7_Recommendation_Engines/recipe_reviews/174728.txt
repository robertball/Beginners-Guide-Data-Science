This is a good foundation of a Cuban Frita but you are missing some key ingredients... First of all, the Chorizo. Not the soft Mexican kind but the harder Spanish Chorizo. I would add in a good 1/4 lb of Chorizo. You also are missing the Papitas or fried potatoes on top. Just shred a potato, fry it until golden brown and then salt. Serve this on top of the burger with ketchup. I also increase the pimenton to a tablespoon.

This yields a very tasty burger, assuming the whole batch is about 20 oz., 16 oz. meat it makes about 6 (1/4 pounders) not 12  unless you like 1.3 ounce burgers.

This is a very good base recipe but THE best and most important parts of the Frita are missing! The spanish chorizo mixed into the ground meat AND the shredded potatoes! Just these two things alone make a WORLD of a difference to the frita!

Agree with other reviewers... need chorizo and papas. 

Also, these are great on pressed cuban bread!

Really delicious burger.. took the advice of reviewers and topped with the shredded crispy potato.. didn't have Chorizo. I also didn't have enough ground beef so I used more ground pork than beef..Will make this again.. and even try it with the Chrorizo next time

I made these with ground chorizo instead of ground pork and put in extra paprika. With the chorizo, these were extremely salty, so next time I would half the added salt and the forgo the worcestershire completely.

I gave this such a low review because the texture was terrible. It was so soft and mushy despite an extended time on my grill. I would recommend not using the milk (or at least using less).

However, the next day, I cut up the patties, breaded, and fried them and basically made fake croquetas.

I used all ground beef instead but other than that, I stuck closely to the recipe. I found it a little too salty even though I only used 3/4 tsp salt. Maybe the bread crumbs I used is salted. My sure. Anyway, tastes ok.
