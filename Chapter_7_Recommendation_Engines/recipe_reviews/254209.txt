Basing my review on the meatballs alone; I tried them plain and they were great! Love that this recipe uses real bread instead of crumbs.

These meatballs are fantastic! The peppers and cheese made Avery nice addition. I made these for a snack for game day and they were quickly gobbled up. It was just adults, so I used a spicy BBQ sauce and didn't bother with the fancy cutouts. Because the meatballs themselves are so good, in my opinion, they should have less sauce. I'll be making these again for sure!

Really good meatballs with the perfect amount of spices for me. So many different types of cut-outs can be used or nothing at all! Makes a perfect dinner or cute appetizer. I followed the timing recommended in the recipe, and it was spot on.

What fun! I couldn't wait to make these for my kids' Halloween parties. I used ghost, pumpkin, skull, and bat cookie cutters. To make them ahead of time, I didn't bake the bbq sauce onto the meatballs. I made the meatballs the night before, then added the sauce as a dip on the side. I had teens to feed, so I used a spicy bbq sauce. To curb the heat, I served ice cold milk in wine glasses for them. They loved it! Thank you for the recipe!
