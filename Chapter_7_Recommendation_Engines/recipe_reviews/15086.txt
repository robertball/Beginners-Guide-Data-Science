I decided to try these because I was craving something sweet, but didn't feel like going to the store.  I had everything on hand and they were super quick and easy. Will be great this summer when it is too hot to bake.

This recipe is similar to one that I have made for years, but due to health issues I am unable to make this favorite any longer. My son has proclaimed that these have passed the test!! He wrapped up better than half the batch and took them home with him Christmas day!!! Personally, I feel that the recipe doesn't make quite as many as mine, but this recipe is easier to handle. The flavor is almost identical to the one I was using with less work and expense which is always good in my opinion. Overall, this is a keeper and will be on my list of Christmas candy in the future.

I'm single and don't get the opportunity to cook for many people, but I made these one day to take in to work.  Everyone just loved them--there wasn't a single one left on the tray!

2.2.19  I bought a box of cocoa peanut butter puffs at  Aldi which worked perfectly for this recipe.  Certainly is easy enough to make, only wish the clean-up was that easy.  That sticky sugar-peanut butter mixture solidifies on your pot and spoons and is a bit of a challenge to clean, even in very hot water.  However, they do taste good (sort of like caramel), and I thought they were very filling.  Once you mix in the cereal, you need to move quickly because the mixture starts to thicken and set.  Used non-stick Reynolds WrapÂ® and ended up with 23 cookies (almost more like candy).
