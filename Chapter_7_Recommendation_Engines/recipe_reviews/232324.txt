All I can say is “Yum”!  I made this for a spur of the moment bbq with friends and with all of the other side disheartening and appetizers, THIS was what they raved about and wanted the recipe for. I was quite surprised at how good it was myself. Would be good with tortilla chips too!

I substituted zucchini for cucumber, since I didn't have any cukes in the house. I also threw in avocado just before serving, which gave it a perfect touch. Delicious and was loved by all the BBQ party guests!

Hard to rate this...about half the crowd didn’t care for it and the other half liked it. A few thoughts: use half the cilantro / it’s strong. The canned Mexican corn has a weird / tinny taste, so next time I’ll use only frozen or fresh corn. I think it’s worth tinkering with this recipe and trying again.

Couldn't find all the listed ingredients so substituted those as close to the same and added about fourth to half cup Italian dressing. Served for Easter dinner and again for a funeral. Both got wonderful comments and many wanted the recipe. It is now my go-to dish to serve a crowd.

Wonderful recipe will use again and again, I had several relatives over Memorial week end, this was a hit, my Aunt unknowingly to me loved corn salad and said this was the best and wanted to know how I made it
Thank you for sharing

I made this recipe with poblano peppers instead of chipotle peppers and used fresh corn off the cob instead of canned corn. It turned out really great but had to add some salt and pepper to taste. Otherwise we thought it was very refreshing and a great side dish!

I'm not really sure how to rate this one... half of our party really liked this but the other half didnt. I made this as is except used yellow onions instead of red.  I felt like it was missing something though as a dressing/binder.
