I made this punch for New Year's Eve and my sons were saying that Peppermint and Eggnog didn't even sound good, so, when they tried it, they had negative preconceptions and still they loved it and raved! I thought it sounded good and it tasted GREAT! Everyone loved it! It was so refreshing and creamy! Not heavy at all. This is my favorite punch!
I do not use Rum or any alcohol and it is perfect without it!

SOOOooo...GOOD!!!I prepared this punch for this years Christams Eve Party and it went so fast and we just had to make a second batch.  Do you know how hard it is to find a store open late on xmas eve that even sells egg nog?  Well I do and it wasnt easy...LOL.  Next time I will double ingredients the first time around.  Thanks NJMOM for this awesome recipe!

I could not find any peppermint ice cream, so I used vanilla ice cream and added a few drops of peppermint extract while stirring. Couldn't tell the difference. Absolutely delicious. A big hit.

I have made this punch 4 years in a row and it just gets better and better!  The flavors don't sound like they go together, but they do.  With or without the rum, the punch is wonderful!

I made this on Christmas Eve and loved it. It was really a hit, and the first ever punch to be polished off  quickly at our house. There was no left-over dilema with this one.  The Peppermint Ice Cream was pink and quite pretty.

Made this (minus the alcohol) for a church fellowship meal and it was enjoyed so much that my children requested another batch for Christmas Eve dinner. It has a refreshing flavor and looks so pretty in the punch bowl! Lovely pink color, frothy and festive. :)

I made this for a Christmas paraty, and it was a hit! I left out the rum, since there were children and pregnant women, and it still tasted great. I also put all the icecream in the punch bowl, let it soften, then added the other ingredients. Making it again on Christmas!

Loved this recipe. I made this for my family Christmas party. At first, everyone told me that it sounded disgusting and they didn't even want to try it, but they were pretty disappointed when the punchbowl was empty.

I've made this for years and now it is a true family tradition.  WONDERFUL and probably my favorite recipe from this site.I would make it year round if only eggnog was available.  Only suggestion would be to repost under "eggnog punch" so other eggnog lovers can enjoy!  Thank you so much for the recipe!

We served this without the rum at a Christmas party, and everyone loved it! Who would have thought those flavors would go together so well? This will be a new Christmas and New Year's tradition for us.

Super-yummy!! My only downfall was that I made a double batch, not thinking of how it would remain cold for the duration of my party.  Next time I will freeze some ginger ale in advance (either in a ring or in ice cube trays) to float in the punch to help it stay colder for a longer time. I kept the rum on the side and the kids LOVED it too. I will definitely make this again and again.

This punch was really awful.  THe other reviewer who said it was like "pepto bismal" I think that was probably a good descriptions.  I made this punch and almost all of it was left over....

I made this for a holiday party this weekend...and it was a mixed bag.  One person really enjoyed it and drank two or three cups while the rest found that it reminded them of "peppermint maalox".  I didn't think it was wonderful, but I didn't think it was terrible either.  I will probably never make this again.

Served a double batch for a party and was loved by all, even the "guys" who usually drink beer.  I used mint chip ice cream which was green and had mini chips in it, as that was what my store had. I was worried about the chips, but they sank to the bottom of the bowl and were not an issue.

I love this punch, it was a great hit @ Christmas party this year. Made an alcohol and non-alcohol version. Used mint choc chip ice cream in non-alcohol version. Both were fantastic. Will definitely serve again!

I make this in the evenings after my meals. It is great for a special holiday treat. It doesn't have to just be for a party setting! Very good. I actually use mint chocolate chip ice cream and it is just as good.

Everyone loved this!  I couldn't find the peppermint ice cream so I used French vanilla and pushed some soft peppermints into it...they melted into the punch.  I've made it twice this season...an will make it again!

Delicious!  Everyone raved about this.  I'm not a big fan of rum, so I used peppermint schnapps.  Fabulous!

Turned out great - though let me warn you that this is REALLY sweet!  I made half with rum and half without and both were good.  Instead of using a punch bowl, I filled individual wine glasses and then used a cookie scoop to add one round dollop of icecream for garnish.

I made it for an office Christmas party and the entire bowl disappeared!  Next time I would mix it up half at a time due to the size of my punch bowl (and I would add rum for an all adult crowd)

Made this punch without the rum...the grandkids loved it and fortunately left a little for the adults!  Next time, I may make  two batches, using the rum in one of them!!!  This is definitely a keeper!

Being the first time that I tried this. I was really interested the reviews others gave it. I found it so interesting how one person loved and another totally hated it. So, I gave it a try. I and my guest loved it. Yeah it is sweet but it was was controllable with amount of egg nog and ice cream you use. The only slight down side was peppermint ice cream has tiny pieces of peppermint in it.. ... Which sank to the bottom of the cup.
