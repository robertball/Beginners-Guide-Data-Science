These were...interesting. The cookies helped to keep your hands clean while eating them, but didn't add much to the dessert itself. The chocolate pudding part was not very flavorful--it was a little understated next to the chocolate and peanuts. If I tried these again, I might add more cream cheese-maybe even double it. For all the effort (I have two little ones-anything over one step is effort!) I'm not sure I'd do them again. They were good, not great. **Update: Originally rated 3 stars, I had to up this to 4 stars b/c I got so many compliments on them. So better than I thought, but still a lot of work.
