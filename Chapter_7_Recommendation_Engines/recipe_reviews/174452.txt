What a great combination of herbs and spices, all perfectly suited for one another! I haven't used this yet but if the aroma is any indication of how it's going to taste on the chicken breasts that are waiting for it we're in for a fine dinner! (I sheepishly confess that I wimped out on the cayenne pepper to be on the safe side and only used half the amount called for)  Update: Used this on "Baked Lemon Chicken with Mushroom Sauce," which took this recipe from "blah" to sublime.  I know I'm gonna love this stuff.

This was AMAZING! The blend of herbs and spices was Right On! I made 60 servings right off to bat and put the mix in an air tight container. I used this on 2 whole chickens and baked in the oven. I figured if some one did not like the taste then I was safe by just pulling off the skin. Everyone liked it. I can't wait to try it on skinless chicken breasts next.

Wonderful!  I love finding homemade seasoning blends on this site. They're so easy to scale up and keep in an air tight container for future use.  Plus it's stuff I already have but would have never thought to combine and so much cheaper than buying stuff with preservatives in it. Thanks!

Delicious without being overpowering; I placed six chicken breasts in a pyrex baking dish and drizzled them with olive oil.  I put the seasoning blend into a shaker and sprinkled the breasts on both sides.  Popped them into a 350 degree oven for about 45 minutes and they turned out juicy and very tasty.  Great recipe!

I found this searching for "poultry seasoning" and figured chicken=poultry so I could make this work :)  I used this as poultry seasoning in "Cornell Chicken Marinade" and like the bit of flavor I was able to detect through the overpowering vinegar taste.  I have some left over I'm looking forward to using as a dry rub to let it shine on it's own!

other than the boullion granules, it is an excellent rub to use on chicken to have put on and sealed in a sealer bag for a few hours or overnight before smoking. To eat that evening.  Not cured, but mmmm   mmmmm tasty.  thank you.  like this rub. and adding the rosemary is a real bonus, goes well with pork loin also. minus the granules.   the granules are good for the backing or frying.  mmmmm chili?  mmmm have to try that one.  sounds good.

Excellent!  You will never have bland chicken again using this recipe!  I used it in the "Baked Lemon Chicken with Mushroom Sauce" recipe from this site as well (thanks for the suggestion Naples34102!).  It went fantastic in that recipe.  I think it would also be great just to rub some chicken breasts with the seasoning, and sautee them in some olive oil - add some sides and you've got a great meal!

This spice rub has a lovely flavour, but even with 1/3 the salt is way too salty on baked chicken breast! Cut the salt to 1/4 tsp and it would be perfect!

My family loves this recipe.  We omit the cayenne and chicken bouillion and half the black pepper.  Add 1/8 tumeric.  Family friendly.   Don't even need time to marinate. Just rub and grill.

I tried this last night on some chicken that I fried up and put into a spinach and romaine salad...it was so good!  My husband is not a salad person, but with the chicken added in, he said he loved it.  Instead of putting in the cayenne pepper, I just used 1/2 tsp black pepper. I skipped the salt, and just put in more chicken bullion and used garlic salt.

Excellent, and not just for chicken!  Don't  know what I'd do without it.  Perfect blend of ingredients in just the right proportions.  I've grown to automatically reach for it in the spice cabinet!

Made exactly as is, but using the salt from a package for pretzels.  (Not sure what's different about sea salt other than it's coarse.)  It was very good, but not really what I expected.  There's a lot of "Italian" type stuff in it, but the tiny bit of cumin and cayenne came through making a spicer vs herbier sort of flavor.  But good.  And of course, how can you really get any easier?  I stored it away to keep for my don't-feel-like-it nights (which seem to be a lot anymore).  I rubbed it on boneless chicken breasts -- first time pan fried them, and second time broiled them.  The fried was definitely better, though I did go a little overboard with the stuff that first time.

I love this blend! I've used this on whole chickens, thighs, drumsticks, and breasts...it's AMAZING, whether grilled, baked or in the crockpot. I usually double the recipe and store it in a jar. It reminds me of Grill Mates Chicken Seasoning Blend but it has no preservatives and costs a fraction of the price. I can't say enough good things about this recipe...thank you so much, Patrick!

Great seasoning recipe!  I mixed this up and marinated boneless skinless chicken breasts with this mixture and olive oil to coat.  We grilled the chicken breasts but I think this would be great with roasted chicken too.  I definitely tasted the celery seed which was different and I liked it.  Thanks for a great seasoning recipe Patrick.

Excellent! I've been fixing the "Swiss Cheese Casserole II" for awhile and each time, have tried different seasoning for the chicken. (The original recipe for that dish is rather bland.) FINALLY - this did it! It was a perfect blend of spice and herbs to ramp up the dish considerably. I didn't have dry mustard powder and used celery salt instead of celery seed but still - it came out fantastic! The small amount of cayenne red pepper gave it a nice little kick. (My husband is pretty anti-hot spice anything, so if he wasn't bothered, I figured I'm good. lol) I used this recipe to season 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts (2 of them were smallish, the 3rd was larger) and simply placed the seasoning in a large bowl and dipped the chicken in it, rubbed it on both sides, and then placed in a baker to make the rest of the Swiss Chicken Casserole recipe. Very tasty! This is now the way I'll be making that recipe from now on. Thanks, Patrick!

I think this is really tasty, but it can be hard to tell behind all the pepper. I like some heat, so that was enjoyable, but I think maybe it masked the other flavors a bit too much for my taste. I even left out the cayenne when I made a triple batch in a jar to keep in my spice cabinet...and the black pepper was still really powerful, and I'm someone who likes pepper. So I'll definitely keep making this so that I have it on hand for soups or baked chicken dishes, but I think in the future I will halve the black pepper and continue leaving out the cayenne (and if I want a little heat, I'll just sprinkle some in separately). Great seasoning for chicken...thanks, Patrick!

This was excellent.  I did not include salt or bullion granules as I am on a low sodium diet.  The flavor was still rich with the cayenne adding just the right warmth.  I used this as a dry rub on chicken breasts I pan fried in preparation for inclusion in a shepherds pie.  I added about 1 1/2 tsp of blend to the pie gravy.  Wonderful.  Great way to spice up a gravy.

As my friend put it, "It's like Bam! and then you taste the chicken." It is very strong at firts but its not horrible. I love the mixture of the herbs. Something different and I like it. The first time I made it I used everything. And my family who is not really into spicyish dishes didnt really care at first. So the second time I made it, I left out the dry mustard powder and the cayenne pepper. It tasted just a little different but still great!

This is my favorite seasoning mix! Better than any other I've ever had, even the fancy expensive brands. I use it on chicken, pork, tilapia, salmon, shrimp...any meat or fish. The only substitution I make is using celery salt instead of the sea salt and celery seed. I multiply the recipe and put it in a shaker for daily use.

A nice blend of flavors for chicken or other poultry. It tastes earthy and spicy all at the same time. I mixed up the spice blend and then put the chicken on the George Foremann grill which made this recipe so easy and quick. I was afraid that after reading reviews that it might be too spicy for my three year old, but it wasn't at all. He ate his piece of chicken and wanted more so I think he liked it! This isn't too spicy, just enough to give the chicken a little bit of a kick without being overpowering. I will be making this again because of the ease of preparation and the quick cooking time. Great for a weeknight meal. Thanks for the recipe, Patrick!

We really liked this seasoning...no sugar, not too much salt, and really tasty.  I fixed it tonight for the first time, and it was yummy.  I did read the reviews, and added some tumeric.  Just delicious.  Thanks, Patrick

This was so tasty, I was really impressed! I wanted to coat my chopped up chicken Breasts in it and then fry it so I added a splash of soy sauce and olive oil to wet it up a bit. Also didn't have mustard powder so used a bit of mustard but it was sooooo tasty!

As is the recipe is wonderful!  Changes I like to make are omitting the chicken bouillon and using *smoked* paprika.

This was GREAT. My boyfriend LOVED it and told me I need to use this mixture from now on. I did leave out the parsley,  because I am not a fan. Definitely keeping this recipe for future use... And a huge plus because I already had all of these spices on hand.

Used it in crock pot chicken, and potatoes with a can of cream of chicken soup. It was the best. Used it to BBQ with....EXCELLENT FLAVOR. Baked chicken with it... It is very tasty.

This is a wonderful combination of flavor with just your own touch of heat. Had all ingredients on hand as I make my own combo for chicken, but I also like this one very much. Might play with some of the ingredients in the future but this is a great recipe.

I tried this tonight even though I didn't have all the ingredients! I didn't have mustard powder (I used mustard seed,) paprika, celery seed, cumin, cayenne pepper, or the chicken bouillon. I actually used a tiny bit of seasoning salt instead of sea salt. It was really good! The heat factor was still there too!

This smelled wonderful while it was cooking, but I really didn't care for the chicken once it was done. My husband thought it was great, however, and that is why it's getting a high rating!

I coated boneless chicken with this mixture, let it sit for a couple of hours, then grilled it, sliced it and served on lettuce with tomato and ranch dressing. It was like a restaurant salad, very delicious spice mixture. I will definitely make this again.

WOW!!  I was impressed with this one!  I used the full recipe to liberally season a 4.5 lb. whole chicken and it was very flavorful.  I'm going to make more to keep on hand, because I can see using this often.  Thank you Patrick!

I've made this blend a couple of times in the past.  I love using it on roasted boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  It adds a wonderful flavor that isn't overpowering.

I start this blend with 1/4 cup dried chicken bouillon powder( the kind with no MSG) , I follow the recipe  exactly.  I put the rosemary, thyme and celery seed in my mortar and grind with pestle until rosemary is broken up and celery seed are very aromatic.  Then I put it all in a shaker bottle to use at will.
My family loves this on roasted vegetables, chicken, crostini, everything. Thank you for this great recipe.

WOW By far the best chicken seasoning I have ever tasted! I don't have the celery salt, left out the cayenne (for the kids) and didn't have bullion cubes so I seasoned the 2 chicken breasts, then halved  and simmered them in chicken broth in a large skillet. Took about 20 mins on a med-low heat and EVERYONE raved!! This will be my new go-to for chicken!

This is a delicious seasoning blend. I've used this quite a bit. Instead of using chicken bouillon, I've been using poultry seasoning. I also use smoked paprika instead of the regular paprika.

this is a great recipe, I have been using it for about a year now. I've never added the celery seed or the cayenne, but it's still amazing without it. I always make my chicken like this, usually with a side of sweet potatoes or yams. The savory chicken and the sweetness of the potatoes make a perfect combination.

This was decent. A little bland, but good nonetheless. I'm not sure my use of this gave it the justice it deserved tho.... I used Patrick's blend to season my slow cooker chicken pot pie stew (GourmetSoy) in place of the spices that recipe called for. I feared an over-salted stew otherwise (GourmetSoy's recipe called for SIX chicken boullion cubes and ONE T EACH of garlic / celery salt - whoa!). I am looking forward to trying this on roasted chicken so that the flavor really has a chance to shine thru! Thanks for sharing, Patrick! :-)

I have the pickiest eaters in my home. God forbid if I have an onion in something. I have prepared this twice.  I used olive oil the first time to baste. The second time I tried butter. The olive oil was the absolute best. I love the flavor, use a mortar and pestle for a bit, and then I add to the chicken. I have increased the cooking temp to 400 degrees as we like our chicken a little more brown. This is superb!!!

This is just way too salty.

Let me ask you - when you say, "sea salt", do you mean course grind or fine grind? Lots of "sea salt" (maybe most in typical grocery stores!) is *fine grind*. You need to specify this. This is important. There are lots of people here who are clearly using fine grind sea salt.

And if that's really what you meant - you really meant to say "1 1/2 tsp of fine grind sea salt", then your recipe is way too salty. Seriously.

This is the best seasoning I have ever had. I used the recipe exactly as written. It is so good on grilled chicken as well as cooking chicken on the stove top. My family asks for this all the time "could you do make the chicken with that great seasoning?"

I use this spice blend for a full roast chicken but I think it's Better for smaller pieces so you can enjoy the full flavours on the chicken.  Very tasty nonetheless.

I might start liking chicken. I cooked it on the stove top using a grill press so the chicken tasted great and stayed moist. I don't add as much cayenne pepper because I'm a wiennie with spices. I also didn't add the bouillon cube part. I am going to make a large amount of this recipe for my pantry so at any time I can do a "shake and bake" quickly.

I thought the dry mix was very good.  I left out the bullion since I didn’t have it.  Next time I will apply more generously for extra flavor.

Bought one of those slow roasted chickens from the grocery store that everybody loves and then cooked one of our own using this blend. Guests said the one we cooked was way better.

I agree. It tastes like turkey dinner yum!

Like Jen, I left out the sea salt and used celery salt instead of celery seed.  Was making a sheet pan dinner so sprinkled on veggies, as well as chicken.  It was delicious!   This will be my go-to seasoning.

Great spice. Not too spicy but with just enough kick. My kids and hubs loved it. A little bit on the salty side. Probably put a 1/4 less

Great seasoning mix! I omitted the salt since I had to use celery salt instead of celery seed. I also halved the black pepper. I doubled the recipe and seasoned 4 pounds of chicken with it. I am going to make 36 servings and put it in an empty spice jar.

This was LIT!!! I loved it. I only used 1tsp of salt because I saw other reviewers say the full amount was too much, and I also didn’t use the chicken bouillon (rubbin some chicken dust on a chicken breast seemed a lil weird for me lol). I drizzled a lil olive oil on chicken breast and then rubbed in the seasoning to coat it - wow so good also tasted great on my roasted carrots

This is great, but a little spicy and a tad too salty.  Next time I will either cut or omit the cayenne and cut the salt.

I didn't have the dried rosemary of celery, but it was still absolutely delicious and - as the author says - it has *just* the right amount of heat. I'll be grabbing the remaining ingredients and making it again for sure!

I didn't have any rosemary or bouillon and I used celery salt instead of celery seed. I used this to season a stew and found it to be just right. Will be using this again.

I cut the salt to 1/2 teaspoon and it was still too salty. And the combination of spices overpowered the chicken breast I was cooking. The recipe called for "coating" the stuffed chicken breasts. If I ever use this recipe again, I will "sprinkle" the meat with it.

Practically perfect! I can see how some people may think it's too salty, but we loved it! I didn't add the rosemary because I am NOT a fan. The cayenne pepper gave it just the right touch! Will definitely be making this in large batches.

The depth and flavors of this spice blend was beyond compare!   However; I didn't read other reviews before I made it.  I should have cut the salt to 1/4 teaspoon to 1/2 teaspoon max.  As written, it was way to salty! I fixed the chicken with Moroccan style veggies and rice! Perfection as paired with less salt.

I used this seasoning mix like a steak rub on steaks and pork tenderloin. It was much better than store bought premixed rub or seasoning. I now keep it pre made in a jar for when I need it!

Great, made as is...doubled the recipe so I could fill an empty chicken spice bottle. I will be taking it with me when I travel as I always get self catering accommodation!

My go-to chicken seasoning. I'm a heat wimp and always cut way back on the cayenne.

Balanced and delicious! I did reduce the salt (can always be added). Simply sprinkled on chicken breasts and baked in oven the first time. Will use next to season some chicken breasts in slow cooker. Used a tiny amount of Great Flavors Chicken directly to the meat in place of the granules as granules contain corn which we avoid. Because corn is in so many store bought seasonings, I appreciate the simplicity and wholesomeness of this combination! Will make more and store in a spice container. Thank you, Patrick!

Great stuff! Doubled everything except the heat (cayenne and paprika) and omitted celery seed only because I didn't have it. I always use a smoked paprika too. Def a keeper!!!!

It's good. I made this with NO salt because I usually brine my chicken so adding salt would taste terrible.

I have to say I'll make this next time with little or no paprika. The amount of paprika in this overpowers the recipe and this comes off like any other adobo / paprika based seasoning. I'd rather let the mustard and celery shine on this one.

Left out the boullion and reduced the salt to our taste level.  Seasoned a couple boneless, skinless chicken breasts, then pan fried in olive oil and sliced to eat a salad. Great flavor!

I had everything but the chicken bouillon, and it was a great seasoning for grilled chicken! I did salt and pepper the chicken a little before I added the seasoning. I will make this again, and will probably leave the bouillon out. I don't think it was needed.

Smells amazing in the oven, and tasted great! Only thing I personally did not like is I detected a faint hint of ramen noodle flavoring. I've detested ramen since I lived off it for months straight in college. I suspect it is a attributable to the bouillon. Next time I make this, I'm going to try leaving out the bouillon. Absolutely recommend it though!

This was fantastic.  Perfect combination of flavors.  No one overpowering the others.  Blends perfectly.  I'll be using this from now on for any chicken that calls for seasoning.

Very good recipe!  My husband gave it a 2 thumbs up.  I couldn't find my mustard, so I had to leave it out.  I will have it for the next time.  Thank you Patrick!

This is a real staple of seasoning to use on chicken. The taste is great, even my picky two yr old gobbled it down. Of course, I omitted the cayenne pepper but other than that, great. Thanks for sharing!

UNBELIEVABLE!  Yes, there are lots of ingredients, but as mentioned we all have them in out spice cabinet.  It was extremely easy to make and the flavoring was outstanding.  If you are looking for a quick ( 30 mins) dish to make this is it.  Husbands, if you are looking to make an impression on your wives in the kitchen this could do it.

I made a spicy version and a 'kid' version by sticking to the recipe on one, and leaving out the cayenne and pepper on the second.  There were no leftovers.  I didn't have mustard powder or celery seed, so I substituted crushed mustard seeds and celery salt (due to the celery salt I only added 1 1/4 sea salt).  I baked 14 chicken thighs (boneless) for 30min at 350 degrees, both sides seasoned.  AMAZING. :)
