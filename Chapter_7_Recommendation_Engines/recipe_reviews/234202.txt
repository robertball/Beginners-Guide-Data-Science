This was great! I made a few changes, I subsituted 1 cup large oats (more texture), vanilla and I added 1/3 cup water (to compensate for the large oats). I did't add the trail mix, fruit or Nutella. Just plain for me. Served with milk and berries on the side. I will make this again.

Very yummy, my 2 year old loved it and couldn't get enough. I used vanilla instead of maple extract, and added a bit more cinnamon. Also used salted cashews instead of trail mix and frozen fruit because I didn't have any fresh. It's very good by itself and with a spoonful of Nutella :)

Fantastic! I was concerned that the brown sugar would be too much along with the sweetness of the Nutella, but it was well-balanced with the tart berries. I did use salted trail mix because we like a good balance of sweet-savory in my household.
