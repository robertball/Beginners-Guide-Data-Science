I was impressed with how much this tastes like English muffins and so easy to make. I froze one for later use.

This English Muffin Bread is a great recipe for breakfast.  This is an easy recipe to make. You can not go wrong baking this bread. The bread only took 20 minutes to bake. I toasted the bread and ate it with butter and preserves.  I will definitely make this bread again.
