Well. It's not a pizza, is it? What it is is a fun way to get the sort of flavors you would get on a peperoni pizza in a pasta casserole type of dish. Which is quite enjoyable, actually. The recipe provides a nice base for your own experiments. And I do suggest you experiment, otherwise the result might be quite bland (depending on the kind of marinara sauce you're using). I had to use regular pasta because kluski weren't available, but I can't imagine it makes too much of a difference.
I added some chopped onions to the sauce, as well as some garlic, a splash of Worcestershire Sauce and some red pepper flakes to give it some zing. You may also want to add some salt and a pinch of sugar to the sauce. Will likely use fresh mushrooms instead of canned next time. I love using the slow cooker, but this would work just as well in the oven (which would probably give the cheese a nice crust). Overall it's comfort food for when you can't decide between pizza and pasta or if you find making lasagna too complicated. Tastes as you would expect it to; (literally) make of it what you will with your own variations.

I made a double batch of this for a family get together and thought for sure I'd made way too much. It filled my large slow cooker to the top, but it was such a hit there wasn't any left over. 

The only changes i made were to decrease the amount of mushrooms because we're not keen on those. I also used half ground beef and half pork sausage for an extra depth of flavor. 

My family loved it and I'm planning to make it again next week.

I liked this.. used turkey pepperoni and a lean ground beef. I did cut back on the amount of noodles and I am glad I did.  I think this could use even fewer noodles or more sauce. The ground beef was rather bland in an otherwise tasty dish so I would suggest seasoning the beef before you add it to the crockpot.  Regarding the cooking method.. next time I will just put it in the oven and bake for 30-40 minutes. I don't think the crockpot cooking added much to it

Turned out great! I had to substitute wide egg noodles because Kluski noodles are no where to be found in my area. Other than that, I made it as described. Because it turned out so well, I'm definitely making this again. Next Time however I will try it with an Italian Sausage beef mix instead of beef only.

I made this for our annual "cookie day" lunch and everyone loved it!  It's the perfect taste combination of pizza and pasta.  It was very easy to put together and throw into the crock pot for an hour and a half.  I will definitely be making this again.

This was easy and good! All three regularly reticent men were vocally appreciative! we used moose meat, and it was that much better. this recipe made a lot though - filled one layer in both of my casserole dishes, plus made 12 cupcake-sized lunch packers. (I didn't grease first, just put a bit of cheese on the bottom - baked at 350 for 15 minutes, and let coo completely before removing to a freezer bag.)
