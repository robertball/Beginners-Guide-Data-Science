Oh, my freakin' WORD!!!!! What a fabulous flavor! This takes chicken over the edge of extraordinary taste. I would have never thought in a gazillion years of using yogurt as a marinade vehicle, but it's nothing short of genius. Maybe this hyperbole is owed, in part at least, to the wonderful fresh herbs I grow. One of the fringe benefits of living in Florida - they grow like weeds, so there's always plenty to be used. I only had straight feta, so laced it liberally with fresh minced basil from the garden and a spoon of tomato paste.  It lent a lovely, light  salmon-pink blush to the chicken. Added chopped fresh rosemary, oregano and parsley leaves which, together with the basil, punctuated the pinkish marinade profusely with flecks of bright green. I was going to add some crushed garlic, but knowing that garlic is such an assertive  flavor that can tend to take over, I wanted to give this a shot first [almost, that is, since I didn't have the basil and sun dried tomato feta] as written. So I stuck to the ingredients in the recipe, and was richly rewarded. No garlic needed, and the verdict is I don't even want to add it in subsequent efforts. I found the lemon flavor to be the perfect foil for the yogurt, and it played off the oregano masterfully. We're not big pepper people, so I substituted mushrooms on the skewers.  Thank you for an absolutely stupendous recipe. Edited: Subbed lime zest and juice for the lemon - spectacular!

We also did not make kabobs but put boneless, skinless chicken breasts into a freezer bag with all ingredients - used fresh rosemary and added a heaping tablespoon of garlic and kept all other ingredients the same.  When we were ready to grill the chicken we pulled it out of the freezer and let it thaw during the day...grilled the breasts and served them over brown basmati rice, sprinkling feta over all.  It really had an awesome pungent flavor that we loved!  Thanks for the recipe!

I did not make kabobs, but instead used the marinade (minus the feta) to coat chicken breats. Then I baked them. The yogurt kept the chicken amazingly moist! The spices and lemon were perfect. I also stuffed the breasts with some feta, and 15 minutes before pulling it from the oven I sprinkled feta on top. Delicious!!!

Flavor was good, but it definitely had some texture issues.  I may try this again cutting down on the marinade time

These were delicious! My husband said he didn't really taste the marinade, but I noticed a difference. We served with Mediterranean Greek salad found on this site and Pita Wedges and Tzatziki Sauce (from this site). Delicious Meal and got many comments.

After upping the spice content a bit with extra oregano, garlic, and lots of fresh rosemary, this recipe turned out great.  My family loved it.  I also added a bit more salt, as the yogurt can be pretty sour.  The yogurt makes the chicken incredibly moist, but be very careful not to overcook the chicken on the grill or it can get pretty dry.

The chicken was very well cooked and really retained the flavor of the marinade. I only added one tablespoon of lemon juice and it was still really lemony. I also added garlic and I thought it really added to the flavor. The one complaint I would make is that there was too much feta.

these were very good.  Marinated for almost 24 hours.  used 1 tsp. oregano and 1 tsp. basil.  Other ingredients the same except for 1 extra clove of garlic.  Skewered w/mushrooms, fresh pearl onions, sweet red and green peppers.  Present nicely.  Very tender.  thanks for this recipe.  I think I prefer the marinade for Hawaiian chicken kabobs a bit better and more tender.

My boyfriend and I greatly enjoyed this recipe.  I don't have a grater, so I had to leave out the lemon zest.  I never would have thought to add feta to a marinade, but it was delicious.  We might try adding a little garlic next time because we like it, but the recipe was wonderful without it too.  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent as an appetizer using chicken tenderloins. Also, I stripped fresh rosemary branches of all their leaves except the last 3 inches, using them as skewers.  For presentation, I used the stripped leaves as a bed of greenery, placing the skewers on top and garnishing with red onion rings and lemon slices.  Huge hit at the party!

One of my family's favorite recipes.  I don't make kabobs, just grilled chicken breasts.  Outstanding paired with coconut curried rice and green bean and feta salad.

We loved this! So tangy and flavorful. I used Greek yogurt (natch), only 1 tsp. oregano and 1/2 tsp. rosemary. This was just the right flavor for us. The red onion and green pepper went perfectly and made for a very colorful kabob.

Very tasty.  I didn't have chicken breast, so I used thigh meat and just grilled them without kabobing them.  Will make again.

Terrific Recipe. Chicken was so moist and the flavor was great.  Even my wife who hates chicken cooked on grill loved it.  I did substitute Vanilla Yogurt for the regular Yogurt and Lime juice for the Lemon Juice.   Very Very good.  If you like chicken and any kind of cheese you should try this recipe.

I love kabobs and I think I have tried everyone on this site. This is one of my favorties! It goes really will with pita pizzas. I also like to marinate the veggies with the meat and I add in mushrooms.

Try this recipe with chicken thighs rather than chicken breasts and just grill, don't make them into kabobs.  You can roast the peppers and onion on the grill as well - WAAAAAAY tastier!!!

This was a great marinade!  I made the marinade as instructed, and then put the chicken pieces in a ziploc container for about 6 hours, mixing them a couple of times throughout the day.  The kabobs I made using red onion, green and red bell peppers, and mushrooms.  Once cooked, I let them sit for a few minutes, then removed them from the skewers into a large serving bowl -- everyone had seconds!  I will use the marinade for chicken in the future for sure!

This dish has been made a few times in our home and every single time we cannot believe how delicious it turns out.  I add the sundried tomatoes with fresh basil to the feta and also use fresh oregano and rosemary as it is plentiful in our garden from June until October.  I marinade all day but have done it shorter.  This is my very favourity Chicken Kabob recipe.  Thanx Katplusgoll ...

Overall, this recipe was good.  Kids and family liked it.  However, I do think the yogurt and lemon juice changed the texture of the chicken breast and made it a bit "mushy".  It maybe better for dark meat.  Also, it was a bit bland; next time, I will add some paprika and garlic and a bit more salt.

Excellent!  Used regular organic greek yogurt and added tomato paste and basil like other reviewers suggested and marinated overnight.  I then seasoned roughly chopped red onion, mushrooms and green peppers with salt and steak seasoning and skewered them with the chicken and grilled on the BBQ.  Turned out fantastic!

Other than broiling instead of grilling, I made these exactly to recipe, and they were wonderful.  I'm a professional and not too many things WOW me, but when these popped up in my mailbox, I was looking for something for a luncheon for 15, and these fit the bill.  Congratulations on your fabulous featured recipe, and thanks for posting!

The inner kabob chicken pieces were moist, but the ends got dried out. I don't think I'm a huge fan of the flavor or using yogurt as a marinade.

Excellent.  Served with greek style potatoes fron this site.  I am not sure which we liked better the potatoes or chicken.  Make sure not to over marinate the chicken or it will have a weird texture.  Next time will try putting marinade in blender as another reviewer suggested. We will definetly be making again.

Wow! This was a big hit! I never realized what yogurt could do to chicken. This was incredibly moist, tender, and juicy with just the right amount of herbs and spices.  I opted to use fat free plain greek yogurt along with fat free feta cheese and chopped sun-dried tomatoes and fresh basil.  I couldn't resist adding a little fresh minced garlic and a couple of sprigs of fresh rosemary. I threw everything into a ziploc bag (minus the veggies) and let the chicken marinate for three hours.  I skewered the veggies separate from the chicken as they cook at different rates.  Overall, very tasty!

Absolutely delicious. I substituted whole mushrooms for the green peppers and served warm pita wedges and cool tzatziki on the side. Perfect warm weather meal!

This is an awesome recipe!!!  I added fresh dill to the marinade and marinaded the chicken for about 18 hrs.  I didn't have a grill so I cooked them in the oven at 350 - took awhile, nearly an hour.  They were wonderful and definitely have a nice Greek flavor.

I didn't have the proper ingredients to follow this recipe to the letter, but stuck as close a possible. I marinated overnight. This was an amazing recipe. Great base to branch off of. We grilled over charcoal and the flavor was divine, the chicken extremely moist. Definitely a keeper.

Who would have thought using yogurt in a marinade? This was excellent. I made two minor changes which were so minor that they had no impact on the rating. First is that I threaded my meat and veggies on separate skewers so that I could control the cooking time on each. I prefer my veggies crisp tender and knew they would be overcooked for my liking if kept on as long as the chicken. The other change is that I added fresh mushrooms with my onion and bell peppers simply for the fact I had them on hand and I liked the idea of adding another texture to the finished dish. The feta did seem to get lost in the marinade so my one suggestion is to save it until the end and crumble it over the cooked chicken. This was an excellent recipe with tons of flavor. Thanks for sharing!

Another great recipe!  One of my pregnancy cravings has been greek food, I just can't get enough.  I figured I should try and make my own since we were spending a fortune at the Greek House here in town.  haha  This recipe hit the spot, I marinated my chicken all day and added garlic to the marinade.  I used plain greek yogurt instead of the fat free yogurt.  The chicken was so moist and flavorful.  I served it with the greek roasted potatoes from this site and some garlic green beans.  This recipe satisfied my craving!!  I will be making it again!

Didn't make kabobs, but the marinade was perfect for just cooking thinly sliced chicken breast on the stovetop.  I only had time to let it marinate for 2 hours, so I'm assuming it would be even better if left for longer.  I served it with roasted grape tomatoes, sundried tomatoes, and steamed green beans on the side.  I've been cooking for less than a year, so I'm still new at it, but my husband said this was "Absolutely Delicious!!" I agree :)  Thanks for the recipe!

Amazing.  By far the best mariande we've tried on grilled chicken.  We didn't have the flavored feta, but added dried basil from our spice rack to give it a similar flavor.  We didn't have pita breads, so I heated some tortillas and had a great Greek taco!  We let our chicken sit in the yogurt mixture for about 6 hours, and I think the chicken soaked up the flavor wonderfully!

Made this as written on the grill last night for dinner. Excellent!! Chicken kabobs were very moist and tender. Yes it has a different flavor- a bit tangy, but the wife and I thought they were great. Will make this again.

The chicken came out so moist! i left it overnight and it cooked up really fast the next day. I followed the recipe but i did not have the feta with the tomatoes and basil so I just used fresh basil with the feta. Ever since I tried this recipe, I have been a fan of using yogurt for marinating. I still can not believe I had not used it before =)

Incredible flavor, especially when served with lemon/olive oil basmati rice.  Authentic-tasting recipe for those people who love Mediterranean style foods.  I used Greek yogurt instead of plain and kept some aside for dipping.  My husband declared it the best meal he'd had in months.

These were a big hit at our house. They were fragrant and tender and my family gobbled them up. Used more chicken (almost a pound and a half), but the same amount of marinade. Sealed it in a zipper bag to marinate and there was plenty of marinade. Thanks for the great recipe. My daughter asked if we could have this every night for dinner!

This was so good!  My husband always complains that kabobs don't have enough flavor but thought this recipe was wonderful.  I didn't have feta cheese with basil and sundried tomatoes, but I did have each of those ingredients.  So, I used 1/3 cup feta, about 1/3 cup sundried tomatoes and apprx 1 Tbs basil.  I set some of the extra marinade aside in a separate container to serve with the kabobs after they were cooked b/c I always like to dip.  Anyway, it worked out great!  We were loving it and plan to make it again!

This was really good. Got thumbs up from everyone at the table. Very tender and flavorful. I opted out on adding the pepper and onion and put them in a Greek salad instead. I would like however, to figure out how much the feta cheese contributes to the recipe, as most of it gets thrown out with the marinade, which is a waste. I might experiment a bit with it to see how the feta can be used more efficiently in this recipe, and how much it matters; if it's the yogurt alone that makes the marinade, then simply adding a sundried tomato/basil seasoning instead may be enough.

This was a great recipe! I would never have put these ingredients together, but they really worked. I added a little bit of white wine and some minced garlic and shallots that I had on hand from another recipe. I left out the lemon zest, but I should have added it to give it a stronger lemon flavor. I sprinkled on some extra rosemary and oregano before I put it on the grill. The feta and yogurt coated the chicken and kept it moist, but I should have oiled the grill more before I cooked it. The chicken stuck a bit. I grilled some shrimp also and served everything with some couscous.

This should be called "lemon chicken kabobs". That was ALL I tasted! I might try making it again with quite a bit less lemon juice. I even had more chicken than it called for. Sorry!

I found and printed this recipe back in 2004.  I've made it several times and love it!  I just put all the marinade ingredients in a Ziploc bag and add the chicken and veggies to marinate.  I add tomatoes as well.  Instead of doing skewers, I just put everything in a grill basket, put on the grill and turning periodically, grill all together.  It seems to hold some of the marinade this way and cook in more flavor.  I typically serve with/over rice.  It's good to read more reviews (there were only 5 when I printed the recipe-LOL).  I'm having a party in a week and this is on the menu-- am going to try adding mushrooms and garlic.  Enjoy!

So tender and delicious.  I only marinated it for 2 hours - not overnight, and it already had so much flavor.  I can't imagine it tasting better if I marinated it overnight, because it was already to die for.  I added a little bit of olive oil and a couple tablespoons of yellow mustard to the marinade and I am so glad I did!! Definitely try to add a little mustard - it gives the chicken that extra flavor!

I was honestly surprised how well these came out. Chicken cooked perfectly and was moist and delicious. Flavor was great. They were a big hit at our bbq. I'm reviewing this now as I prepare to make it for the 2nd time. Definitely a keeper.

Family favorite... We cut the chicken in small bite size pieces and it absorbed the flavors very well.  BBQ and keep the stove off.  We doubled the recipe and will enjoy again the next day.  Easy recipe for the children to make.

I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand, so I just marinated the chicken in juice from one lemon, lemon zest, two garlic cloves (minced), dried oregano, salt, pepper, extra virgin olive oil and 8 oz of fat free greek yogurt. I only had time to marinate for 2 hours and it was still amazingly delicious and moist.

This dish was amazing.  I made it for a bbq over the summer.  Didn't want the plain hamburgers/dogs....  I made extra sause and used it as an appetizer with pita pieces... yummy

very very good.  The most moist chicken I ever made.  I let them sit overnight and that definately helped.  I brushed the remaining marinade over the chicken as it was cooking to give it extra flavor.  My guests all want the recipe.  I added grape tomatoes to the kabob.

Wow! These are EXCELLENT!!! My fiance and I hung around home this holiday weekend (we're saving for a wedding, so no out of town trips for us). We hadn't grilled all weekend, nor had I prepared a meal (I like to spend time in the kitchen when I have time). This was the best of both worlds - I got to try a new recipe and my fiance got to grill! I pretty much followed katplusgoll's directions to the letter execept for two substitutions (because it was all the store had  available). First, I subbed Mediterranean feta for the sun-dried tomato & basil variety (this blend also included chopped black olives) and second, I subbed a 5 oz. container of plain Greek yogurt for the 8 oz. container of regular yogurt called for. Neither were big enough changes to make a noticeable difference, IMHO. I also prepped everything this morning and allowed my chicken to marinate 5-6 hours. I think this contributed to the tender texture (and boy was it tender!). Oh, and I used red bell pepper instead of a green one (personal preference). Altough these turned out really well, I do think next time I'll blend all marinade ingredients to incorporate the feta (great idea, Starlet!) and save some of the marinade for a dipping sauce (as is, I had a lot left, but I tossed it since my chx. marinated in it). Served alongside Cat Lady Cyndi's herbed Greek potatoes with feta and a warm loaf of rosemary olive bread (from my grocer's bakery), this was an AWESOME summer meal. Thanks for sharing, katplusgoll! :-)

I was looking for a great greek marinade and this is it!  I used it on boneless, skinless chicken breasts, marinated them overnight and cooked them on the grill. I served the chicken along side Orzo with Parmesan and Basil from this site + a vegetable and it was a fantastic meal. The family loved it.

I thought this recipe was great! The chicken was flavorful and fantastic. If people find it bland, I think it's because they didn't marinate long enough.

Fantastic marinade - very tasty.  I used boneless dark meat sections and it turned out moist and delicious.  I don't like green peppers so I substituted zucchini on the skewers.  I'll definitely make this one again.

Excellent. I can't imagine how anyone could say these didn't have any flavor; the meat was *very* flavorful to us! Loved the combination of flavors and the lemon was just the right amount... it was there, but didn't overpower anything else. The only change I made was to omit the onion wedges from the kabobs out of personal preference. Thank you!

I made this with several changes. I used garlic & herb feta instead of sundried tomato feta, cut the lemon juice to 1 tb, and added a dash of basil & garlic salt. I also marinated it overnight and used the thin cut boneless breast filets as they cook faster and you get more flavor on them since they're thinner. They came out fabulous. Soft, juicy, and full of flavor. This one's a keeper.

This was delicious...I made extra "yogurt marinade" and served it on the side as a dipping sauce for the chicken. I also added a lot of garlic to the marinade. Served with a tomato/onion/cucumber salad (marinated in olive oil, lemon, and spices) and grilled pita bread with hummus.

Loved this! Finally a kabob recipe that is different.  Great with just a Greek salad.  We did find that we needed to separate the chicken pieces from each other to get the middle ones done before the end ones were overcooked- but that was our fault.  Thanks for sharing this one.  We will be making it forever.

I thought theses were really good. My husband like them, but said to cut back on the lemon. I think it had the perfect amount of lemon, but I will cut back next time to please everyone. It could be because I marinated overnight? Really good recipe. Thanks

These were very good- a nice change of pace from the usual plain or teriyaki kabobs. The flavors were perfect for a hot summer night. The texture was a little funny....  but easy to overlook.

Absolutely wonderful!!! Thanks so much for sharing this incredible receipe! It's great for the BBQ and the summer months. I will definitely be making this again. The only thing I will change is the marinating. I suggest the Greek Chicken Kabobs be marinated 6-8 hours for tenderness. Thanks again!

These were great!  After I grilled them I took them off the kabob and put them in a baking pan, and briefly  broiled them with a little Feta cheese and black pepper on top.  They were great!  I pared them with Greek honey balls for desert. Yum!

Super-tasty and healthy! I'm starting to make an effort to cook more, and this recipe was a great start because it tasted great but was easy to prepare. I like a bit more spice in my food, so at the last minute I decided to sprinkle some paprika into the marinade. That worked pretty well, but I think I'll try chili powder next time instead. I also didn't have lemons or lemon juice so I substituted lemon pepper seasoning, which worked pretty well. My family ate this rolled up in flatbread with some fresh spinach. Mom raved about it and told all of her friends in Facebook how good it was.

We thought these were really good. Served alongside a greek salad, pita bread and tzatziki sauce. YUM! Great healthy meal. Side note: we have tried this both grilled and baked. Grilled is definitely more what we are looking for, as if you bake this it becomes very soupy. (FYI, for those curious.)

This is the best chicken I've ever had. I was looking for something similar to what i had in a greek restaurant while on vacation in long beach, but this was even better!! This is a recipe I will be making again and again.

Yum! Made these for our 4th of July cookout and they were a hit.  A bit messy to assemble but that was part of the fun. :)  I'm not sure how much feta flavor came from marinating and it's not as if it stuck to the kabobs so next time I'll take another reviewers advice and blend/process the marinade to incorporate the feta better.  We used zuchinni instead of the peppers and onions.  Also served Greek Orzo Salad from this site.  Dinner was delicious and I'll be making this again.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, katplusgoll!

Excellent flavor! I marinated the chicken overnight and used Greek yogurt.  The meat wasn't tough as all, as other's mentioned, maybe it's the different type of yogurt.  Next time I'll just grill whole breasts instead of kebabs and will also puree the marinade as other's suggested.  Lastly, I will try setting aside some of the blended marinade (before adding the chicken) to save for dipping. Thanks for sharing, very delicious!

This was WONDERFUL!!  I must admit, did not have high expectations as I have marinated in a yogurt based marinade before and found the chicken doesn't usually pick up the taste.  Not the case with this one!  It was fabulous.  My extremely finicky 10 yr old who just about cries or whines EVERY night at dinner (I am not exaggerrating) even ate it and said it was good!  My only regret is that I mindlessly put the skewers on the grill without oiling it or at least spraying olive oil on the kabobs themselves and I ended up losing half the chicken as it was stuck to the grill.  I can't wait to make this for company!  BTW, my 6 yr old and I enjoyed dipping the chicken in tzatiki sauce :o)

Absolutely delicious. We loved these, I followed the recipe as is and marinated them for about 5 hours and added mushrooms to the kabobs. My husband bbqed them on a veggie grill screen to help with holding in the sauce.

I, like others, feared that this would be bland, but I trusted the reviews and the recipe and went sans-garlic.  It was fantastic.  And healthy, which is wonderful!  The feta cheese was the kicker.  I didn't have oregano or sun dried tomatoes, but I used canned roasted red peppers in place of the tomatoes and they were delicious.  Used fresh basil and dried rosemary.  Served as chicken breasts and just grilled the green pepper straight on the grill.  It was juicy and very tasty.  Will make again.

Delicious...I didn't have the basil/sundried tomato feta so used the garlic/herb feta instead and used fresh rosemary in place of dried.  Great flavour.   Served this with Greek potatoes and grilled vegetables.  Everyone raved about it.

Wow, these kabobs are good!  I made the mistake of cutting some of the pieced of chicken too big, I would suggest cutting them into 1 to 1 1/2 inch cubes.  I also use the marinade on chicken to make chicken gyros.

Fabulous recipe!  Added a red pepper to the skewers.  Served with rice, pita bread, and a feta sauce I made using feta, olive oil, a little lemon juice, and garlic powder (put in mini food processor)!

This chicken was so delicious and my gang including visiting extended family all loved it. The yogurt kept the chicken so moist and with the addition of my usual garlic and onion powders, it was very flavorful. Quick, easy and so yummy! Thank you!

AMAZING dish!!!  Came together rather easily, and tasted wonderful even though I only marinated it 2 hours.  I did run the marinade through the blender before pouring it over chicken and HIGHLY recommend doing this as it incorporated the feta flavor in better than I think it would've had I left it chunky.  Made this with ARs Spinach and Rice (Spanakorizo) and it was a terrific Greek dinner.  Definately a keeper!

This was really good! I used a little bit of the marinade for dipping sauce. Yummy! I just used regular feta, but I bet it would be better with the sun dried tomato.

I looooovvve this recipe.  It reminds me of a recipe from when I was a child and we ate at a greek restaurant in Michigan.  It has wonderful flavor and tastes better the longer it marinates.  I reserved some of the marinade so that I could baste the chicken as it cooked.  Excellent recipe!

Very moist and tender. So good. Next time I would add garlic and cut back a bit on the lemon juice. But all in all very tasty.

This recipe was not a success for me. The chicken was very bland. The meat did come out nice and moist, though. This could be an appealing dish for people who do not like spicy food, but it just wasn't for me. I won't be making it again.

This was an absolute success!  As others have done, I substituted mushrooms for zucchini, and I added red peppers as well as green peppers - to add colour and taste!  The idea of feta with kabobs is fabulous - I will definitely be making this again...and soon!

So good and so easy! Perfect summer grill food. I used red pepper instead of green, as I like grilled red peppers better. I also added mushrooms to the kabobs, as corks on each end. The marinade was very good. Next time I might rub the left over marinade on the vegetables, because there was so much left and it was so tasty, almost a shame to throw away  My husband (who does most of the cooking) was very impressed with me. This is a sure keeper!

We really enjoyed this!  I followed the recipe exactly and the chicken came off the grill moist and tender with a delicate lemon flavor.  I added fresh baby portabellas and thick slices of zucchini to the kabobs, also.  Served with a greek salad and grilled corn on the cob.  Very good!

I was planning a dinner for our parish priest this past weekend.  I wanted a greek theme.  This marinade is truly awesome.  It was so good that my husband even commented on how good the meal was! I marinated both chicken and lamb (for kabobs)using this recipe and I kept the meat in the fridge, overnight, in freezer baggies.  The meat was so tender!  Some of the best lamb I've ever eaten (and mediterranean food is my favorite) Thank you, thank you, thank you for submitting this recipe.

YUMMM! Our grill wasn't working when I made this, so I broiled them. I knew it would be good b/c it smelled and looked so good when fixing it, but I wasn't prepared for how awesome this was. I served with Peppy's Pita Bread and Tzatziki Sauce II from the site. I want more!

This is an absolutely wonderful recipe. I've made it 3 times and it's no fluke-every time it comes out just as good as the last time. Have served it to company and it was gobbled up. I serve it with some Uncle Ben's chicken flavored rice and some tzatziki sauce and it is out of this world! Could probably be served in a pita and would be equally as good. Very flavorful.

Perfect summertime dinner. Wow the yogurt marinade made the chicken delicious! People were raving at my outdoor evening Mediterrean mean. I served with warm pita and hummus so folks could put their kabob items right into a pita to make a gyro. Also served a cold orzo pasta made with mint and feta. 

This has become my go-to for a winning summer meal!

I didn't skewer, but put on grill pan. Served with grilled red onion, hummus, kalamata olives, diced tomatoes and tzatziki sauce.  Put all of this on small flour tortillas, so so good

I made this recipe exactly as instructed and had a hard time with the “marinade.” Not really a marinade in my opinion but more of a paste. Very messy operation both in preparation and on the grill itself. Flavor was so-so but nothing to rave about.

This is by far the best chicken marinade I have ever had to date.  It is moist and flavorful and doesn't seem to burn like some on the bbq.  We used this recipe for boneless breasts not skewers and it works beautifully.  The leftovers are even betters and we haven't anything we couldn't put it in yet.  My husband has made this twice now without burning or drying out the chicken so its a definite keeper...

It was a good start. I thought it needed a little more flavor AND defiantly salt. Garlic was a good addition.

I wasn't impressed. I made exactly as written and I thought it was bland and a waste of good feta. The feta flavor was barely perceptible, the yogurt flavor was overwhelming, and you couldn't taste the herbs at all. We might have over grilled them slightly, so I'll forgive the dry texture, but I won't be making this marinade again.

I hardly ever give 5 star ratings, but this is some of the best chicken I have ever had. I marinated mine for about 12 hours and served with tzatziki sauce and Greek potatoes (which I also found on this website) Delicious!

Made just a couple changes - used half yogurt and half sour cream to cut the 'tang' that some find objectionable andsed fresh herbs vs dried.  Made this for a progressive dinner party.  Also left off the onions and peppers and grilled them separately as we also made grilled Mediterranean beef skewers with a different marinade so served the veggies with both meats.  Guests LOVED the chicken!! I would definitely make this again.  We don't care for green peppers so used red, yellow and orange - so much better!

Outstanding! I used about 3/4 cup of Olive oil instead of yogurt and feta - because I didn't have available. I made oven roasted vegetables. My family loved this. Will definitely make again.

What an authentic Greek, fresh tasting, delicious recipe. At first I thought, what an unusual way to marinade chicken. But, it resulted in a moist, tender, full of flavor dish. Served with taziki sauce and Greek salad also from this site. Made pita sandwiches with the left overs. Tasted like an authentic gyro sandwich. Delicious!

Wonderful and delicious chicken! 
I added about 2 cloves of crushed garlic and a bit of garlic powder ( we love garlic!).  Marinated for 4 hrs. It was Bbq'd on the grill and savoured by all!!  Be very attentive to NOT overcook the chicken.  It will dry out if you leave it too long on the grill. .  The chicken was tasty, succulent, moist and bursting with flavour. 
Added zucchini, tomato and onion to the skewers.  
Will certainly do again.

Who would have thought that yogurt and feta cheese would make a good chicken marinade? But this was fantastic! The chicken turned out so most and tender and flavorful. The mixture of onions and tomatoes and chickens on the skewers gave the most wonderful tastes! This is definitely one to save!

The boyfriend loved it and said he wouldn't change a thing. I, however, did make a few minor changes.  actually did increase the amount of salt a bit and omitted rosemary (didn't have any). Also increased the thyme a bit. I marinated for three hours and I wouldn't do it more than that because you run the risk of the "mushy" texture others mentioned. I will be making this again, thanks for sharing!

I will make this again but  will eliminate the vegetables as they served no purpose other than to add color so my rating is three stars and my advice is to reduce lemon and skewer only the chicken.

I made this for Labor Day and was expecting something really wonderful based on the reviews.  I only had time to marinate for 2 hours and maybe that was the problem.  At any rate, while the chicken was tender, I didn't think it was anything to write home about.

Amazingly delicious!  The flavors were wonderful.  The only thing I did differently was I marinaded the peppers and onions in the marinade with the chicken...delish.  We only let it marinade for 1h and 30 min and it was still amazing.

Just thought these were ok....  Made as written except used fresh herbs from my garden.  I will admit the chicken was moist but I was hoping for a bit more flavor.  Thanks for sharing, glad I tried them.

This is fabulous.  I used chicken thighs because I find they and more tender.

Loved this.  Chicken was perfect.  We actually put strips of steak in the marinade too and it all came out great.  We put the grilled meats and veggies on a bed of lettuce and added diced tomatoes, feta cheese and tzatziki sauce.  Yummy!

We had these while on a camping trip, marinated them for 1 full day before grilling (not necessary, but made the prep work much easier for camping)!  The chicken is melt in your mouth delicious!!  Thank you for sharing!

The best chicken marinade ever!!  I have made this for several parties and everyone asks for the recipe. A few times I made a slight adjustment - instead of plain greek yogurt - I make taziki and use that.  It comes out so tender and juicy.  I also only use about 4 oz of the taziki mixture - I found that if the chicken is saturated it can become a mushy texture after cooking.

WOW!!! What an absolutely amazing recipe. So easy and delicious! A bit tedious but very much worth the work. I didn't have lemon zest or lemon juice so I excluded them and used basil instead of rosemary. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a T and could not have been more happy with the results. This was my first time making shishkabobs and my first time using a grill...meaning the recipe is easy enough for all levels of cooks! I added pineapple chunks to the skewers, which caramelized on the grill and added a perfect amount of sweetness. I served with oven-baked red potatoes. Thank you for this!!

These were fantastic, the yogurt really added moisture to the chicken. I couldn't find sundried tomato/basil feta so I used plain feta and threw SD tomato and fresh basil into the marinade. Marinated it for about 4 hours. Next time I'll make try for 6 hours since I liked the flavor so much. I bought pre-cut veggie skewers at Whole Foods and interspersed the chicken on those. Will definitely make this again and again.

Awesome! I liked them on the kabobs, but they were a little messy to assemble.  So I might just marinate the whole chicken breasts and grill them alone next time.

I actually used this recipe for grilled chicken breasts on the bone instead of kabobs and it was delicious. Marinated overnight and it came out super moist. Very tasty with the pieces of feta cheese melted and crusty on the chicken from grilling. Excellent!

I really wanted to like this since I love all the flavors but it just didn't work for me.  Peopel either loved it or thought it was bland.  I followed the recipe and I am on the bland side. I never have luck with kabobs so I was  took another reviewers suggestion and just grilled the meat and veggies separate and then I was going to skewer them.  I noticed a lot of the marinade and yummy stuff fell into the grill so I baked the second batch.  Those were better because the cheese and  tomato and all stayed on and I just served them another night over rice.  The grilled ones were  bland.Hope others have better luck with it.  I am always glad to try a new recipe so thanks for posting.

This just didn't "do it" for me.  By the time I made the mariade & cucumber dipping sauce (from this site), it was time consuming and the end product just wasn't worth the effort.

It was good but I doubt I will make it again.  For all the ingredients involved it seemed to have little effect on the taste of the chicken.  Don't get me wrong, it was good, just not worth the effort and expense for us.

Loved these! I could only find garlic and herb feta cheese, so I just went with that. I thought these were very flavorful, but I did marinate them overnight, so that may be the key. The chicken came out moist, tender and juicy. I will be making these again for sure! Thanks for sharing. :)

The marinade was great but we didn't think the flavors absorbed into the chicken much. However, I had extra sauce left and served it with fresh vegetables and that was a hit! Great dipping sauce idea.

I love this recipe!  I serve the kabobs over rice with a red Thai curry sauce, and Tzatziki sauce.  I also grilled them on a George Forman grill for about 12 minutes turning every few minutes to brown on all sides. Wonderful!

My biggest complaint is - ever since I made this recipe, none of my other dinners are requested! These kabobs are loaded with flavor! I serve them with some whole grain pita and a recipe I found for greek fries (basically roasted potatoes with lemon juice and seasonings on them). What a great way to enjoy a guilt-free meal!

My husband raved about this chicken, served with greek olives, feta, fresh onions, pita bread - grilled lightly and hummus.  He asked for it special again! So I am whipping it up and letting boneless chicken breasts marinate for about an hour.   This is good stuff!

Made 2 batches - one with a little over a pound of chicken and one with about a pound of lamb.  Doubled the marinade and put in separate containers.  Served on a bed of couscous.  Outstanding!

Rather than do this as kabobs, I essentially baked it.  Maybe that was my problem or I measured wrong because the taste was all wrong.  The zest and feta made it a bit too bitter. (I'm giving the other reviewers the benefit of doubt.)  A day later and I'm still trying to decide whether to try and salvage or toss it.  This recipe is not a keeper for me.

Nice tasty kebabs and very easy prep items. They were full of flavour on their own and the chicken was so tender it was awesome.I used 1.5lbs of chicken since the amount of marinade I had, could handle it.It made 8 long kebabs  and all 7 adults and 3 kids enjoyed them.Recipe is a keeper thanks.

This was pretty good.  I think I would have personally liked more lemon flavor.  I should have marinated it for longer too.

Flavorful and moist chicken!  I served on pita bread with tzatziki sauce, tomatoes and shredded lettuce.  Guests loved it!  This shows up regularly in our grilling rotation!

The texture was terrible. It tasted like mushy chicken. The flavor was okay.

I really liked the yogurt marinade.  Added the feta at the end instead of in the marinade & I liked how that tasted.  Also, this works well with pork.

Excellent chicken, if a bit dry.  Flavors were wonderful - not at all spicy, just very flavorful.  I grilled these on a broiler rack, since I did not have a grill available.

Definitely marinate for those three hours at least - I marinated overnight and would have gone longer if I could.  Will use this again!

Loved this!  I did without the lemon zest.  Can't wait to take to our next BBQ.

We didn't care for this as the chicken was so tender that it bordered on mushy.  Obviously, I'm going against the flow here as everyone else loves it.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe very much!  I was concerned that the flavors might be overpowering together but I was wrong - the kabobs tasted terrific (and the marinade was super easy to make).  This one is definitely a keeper - I'll be making them all summer long!  Thanks for such a tasty recipe!

Thought it was good, but not great.  I marinated whole boneless breasts overnight and grilled them.  I didn't want to make kabobs.  I guess I thought the feta taste would be stronger.  I'm sure when I cut it up and put it in my salad, it'll be good.  Would I make again?  Probably not but glad I finally tried it.

This is a very fine receipe. The feta cheese marinate lingers in the final product. A flavor my wife and I love. I would recommend this to everyone for a taste treat.

Had a cookout and everyone loved these.  I marinated the chicken overnight.  Try making the Tzatziki I recipe as a dipping sauce.  You don't need it...unless you love sauces as I do!
