I'm giving this recipe 3.5 stars...it was good, but after sitting in the fridge for a few hours, it was extremely dry. We did enjoy the combination of flavors, but had I known how dry it was gonna be, I would've made more dressing. I made the 'Caesar Salad Supreme' dressing from this site and it was wonderful in this, there just wasn't enough, and I added more than called for (maybe I was supposed to use more of a vinegarette-type caesar dressing and that was the issue???). I may try to play around w/ this more, b/c, like I said, it was good, just dry...Thanks for sharing. :)

Five stars because it was super easy to make, it tastes how you would expect, and it looks great! Lots of flavor from the Caesar dressing and pepperoni. Fresh broccoli gives it a nice crunch making the overall texture of this pasta salad superb.

This pasta salad is so easy and yummy... Even my 15 year old liked it! I did change the pepperoni to salami, and I used gluten-free noodles.

It is good, I just finished and it's still warm.  I followed it as written, except I used a 12 microwaveable bag of broccoli. I don't like uncooked broccoli. I used turkey pepperoni for the first time (not a fan but ok in a mix) and 3/4  cup of Paul Newman lite Cesar dressing (nice and peppery) bc of reviews it was dry.  Its good now and if I'll add some more dressing tomorrow.

I made this with bow-tie pasta and used parmesan cheese instead of mozzarella, made it for a get together and had a lot of compliments on it!

Great recipe.  I do with Italian dressing and add it when ready to serve. Sometimes split the batch and do with different dressings.

My family loved it. I would just make a lighter dressing. The Caesar dressing is too heavy and dries out horribly when you put it in the fridge overnight.
