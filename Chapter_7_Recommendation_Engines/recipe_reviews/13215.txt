I prefer a thicker creamier soup. It was ok but not great. I added some heavy cream to help it along. I will not make this again there are easier and better recipes out there.

This recipe was quick and easy.  I used chicken broth rather than plain water.  My husband and I couldn't believe there was this much flavor without any milk or cream.  Delicious...

I made many changes to this recipe to make it pallatable.  I used 3 leeks and did not add any onions.  I browned the leeks and rice in 2 Tbsp of olive oil.  I then cooked this mixture for 30 mins.  I also added less water to the soup and added 1 vegetable bouillon cube for each two cups of water.

At first the recipe was confusing. Once figured out was okay. Excellent soup! We used brown rice. Even the children liked it. Thank you.

Asparagus was on sale at the local supermarket and I made this soup tonight. Family thought it was "the bomb" asking if there was cream in it! Only thing I left out was the lemon juice and I replaced the rice b y 2 medium potatoes.

A great recipe.  The rice makes it thick and it has a creamy texture even though there is no milk or cream in it, which I prefer.  I didn't strain the soup but blended it with a stick blender until smooth and thick.  This keeps all the fibre in it.  I also used chicken stock instead of water for extra flavour.  Husband even enjoyed it chilled as a summer soup with a sprinkle of parmesan cheese.

my husband loves this soup!  i put 1  whole lemon's juice and added more rice for a thicker consistency.  turned out perfect!  also this is great because i am lactose intolerant and this soup tastes creamy and delicious.

This is the best asparagus recipe I have ever made!  It was easy to prepare and delicious.  All ingredients, leek greens and asparagus ends, were used to make a rich veggie broth.  I used organic basmati rice which made a smooth delicate density.  I would use a fine white pepper rather than black pepper.  Very filling and tasty.  Guests loved it!
