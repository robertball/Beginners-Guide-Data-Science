This is gooooood, and I'm surprised! I hate, hate, hate dried out no flavor poultry  burgers and admittedly  really afraid of the end temp being 160 degrees... but determined to followed the directions exact since I planned to review ... baby!...  The spices did the trick! I made them thick and in my cast iron to 160 mark. I can even say they came out almost juicy...  I served the guac on the side and we enjoyed every bite with a side salad, felt healthy and satisfied! Try this one they are really good.

I love this recipe! However when making it I added one egg. My father used to own a hamburger place where he used to create his own patties. He said the egg helps the meat not to break or crack during the time is being cooked on the saucepan. Thanks for your recipe!

Awesome! I bought a 1 pound package of ground chicken, so I just used that instead of 1-1/2 pound, but kept everything else the same. I mixed these up the day before, formed them and put them into the fridge to allow the flavors to blend before cooking them tonight (this also firmed them up a bit). These had a great explosion of flavor that we all loved. I also used homemade guacamole, and hubby had salsa on his b/c he doesn't care for guac. These were a hit at dinner tonight...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

A hit with the entire family! As most reviewers I used a 1lb package of ground chicken and got 4 nice thick patties. Omitted the jalapeno since the kidlet was eating it but added in some ancho chili powder instead. Not being a huge cumin fan I'll reduce it a bit in the future. I did sprinkle in some garlic & onion powders as well as some ground pepper too. Next time I'll be sure to buy another package of ground chicken...we polished off all 4 patties! It's the time of year they're roasting the Hatch chiles here in Colorado so next time there will a roasted chile on my burger! Loved everything about this burger; even grilling them in the rain!

You couldn't get burgers like these in a restaurant. These were hands down the best chicken burgers Ive had. Everyone loved them. The only thing I changed was I didn't use jalepeno because my mom doesn't like spicy I did not mix any cilantro in with the chicken just put some on top after they were done for those who didn't like it I used less then half the onion called for and I used regular salt instead of kosher. Everything else I followed exactly as the recipe said. Delicious! Thank you so much for the recipe.

I used this as a base and added and subtracted for what I had on hand and what we like. I used the cheese and some seasonings. Also added cooked bacon.

Followed the recipe almost exactly. Only Had 1lb ground chicken on hand and we left out the jalapeños. Grilled them on our stove top grill. They were absolutely fantastic. Already added into the monthly rotation.

Very good. Used only 1 lb of ground chicken and got 3 burgers. Directions don't say where to use the onions I mixed in with the meat and it cooked up without any raw onion flavor.

No beef with this burger! Simply amazing! So moist and flavorful! I only used 1/2 a jalapeno pepper and the heat level was just right for us. The cooking time did take a little longer than specified just keep checking it with an instant read thermometer.

The fat from the shredded cheese in the ground chicken is what makes this super moist. I did not add the onion although it calls for it since it was not mentioned in the instructions and I actually forgot about it. Next time I would cut back a bit on the cumin so it doesnt taste so much like taco meat. I did add some lime zest to the meat which gave it an extra kick. Overall it was ok but 5 stars for the awesome idea to add shredded cheddar for moistness even though you dont really taste the cheese in the meat.

Excellent. The whole family loved including the picky kids. I excluded the jalapeños inside the burgers and let those who wanted them add the peppers as a topping to their burger. I also cooked them in my grill pan instead of the outdoor grill. I will definitely make these again. Also my grocer only sells the ground chicken in one pound increments so I used two pounds of meat and just eye-balled the cheese onion and seasoning. I made 8 patties with the two pounds of meat.

I didn't have any cumin or jalapeños on hand so my patties (and my guac) were missing these favours and the result was still so so tasty. The frozen ground chicken i had came in a 1lb pack and that amount produced four thick patties which cooked perfectly at medium-high on my grill for 4-5 min each side. Will probably make ahead and give a few hours to set in the fridge next time but this is a repeat make for sure.

These were very good. I omitted the jalapeño because we don't like spicy and used Mexican cheese blend for the shredded cheddar cheese. I made them slider size and served them on whole wheat slider buns. My 4 year old didn't like the way it looked so I put ketchup on his instead of guacamole and he ate every drop. Will definitely make again.

Wow! These were fantastic! I made them in a skillet rather than on the grill and put the lid on partway through cooking. The flavors are amazing together. So good! We will make these frequently.

Fantastic burgers well worth it. O used pretzel burger buns and they were lovely. One minor error on recipe it does not mention to use onions but I assumed they went into the mix.

My kids loved this and now ask me to make them these burgers over any other kind (including ground beef). I did grind my own chicken using thighs and breasts. I also seasoned the meat thoroughly. I used my guacamole recipe (which is out of the Rick Bayless Every Day mexican cookbook). We toasted our buns. They were divine!!!

I loved these burgers! i added a little bit more cheese and split the mixture into two so that i added the jalepeno in one and not in the other since my partner does not like heat. Extremely moist and tasty burgers.

These were outstanding!! as others have advised I cut back on the cumin not quite a full tsp. next time I will cut back a tad more. My boyfriend was a little nervous about making them but he loved them too & unlike hamburgers these heat up great in the microwave a big plus in my book.

It was too wet. I had to put it on aluminum foil to keep it from falling through the grates. The flavor was very middle of the road. I like the idea of putting cheese in it but would probably add bread crumbs next time.

This is the first time I have used ground chicken in a burger without the addition of another protein added to it. We LOVED these! They were juicy & all the flavors worked perfectly together! I made them as sliders instead of full sized hamburgers and cooked them in a heavy skillet but other than that made exactly as the recipe stated. Huge hit with my family and I will be making these again.

I really liked these! My 9 yr old didn't like the idea of avocado on a burger but my husband and I really liked them. I cut back the onion and cilantro and left out the sliced cheese. I used 2lbs of chicken and made 8 sliders.

Very good!!  My family loved it!  My only note is maybe a bit less cumin. It was a tad strong. Otherwise so flavorful and yummy. I also made a roasted jalapeño sauce to go on top (seeded, oven roasted jalapeños with salt, pepper and lime blended with a little olive oil). It was a very good pair for this sandwich.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!! Followed recipe exactly as stated - EXCEPT for the cheese (I have dairy allergy) so instead of mixing IN the cheese I made burgers & then melted cheese on top for those who wanted it. My husband (beef lover & very skeptical when it comes to any substitutes) loves this! He couldn t believe how good this chicken burger is. I m not a huge fan of cilantro - but did use it as instructed and so happy that I did bc it adds a whole new dimension of flavor!

Will definitely be making this again! I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut the cumin and half. I only had chili peppers on hand so used 2 in place of the jalapeno it wasn't super spicy but added a nice kick. It was not dry at all. I only had shredded cheddar so i used that in the mix and topped with american cheese instead of cheddar which i think may have been too oily. Got rave reviews from the fam! This one is a keeper:)

These were pretty awesome. We followed the recipe however used turkey instead of chicken because its what we had on hand. It was still spectacular. I would highly recommend that you put the onion in with the mixture even though the recipe doesn't say to. Gives it that much more flavor. My kids loved it as well and couldn't believe that there were two jalapeños in it (lol). They are different but really good can't wait to have them again.

This is hands-down the best burger I've ever had - including beef burgers!

Made as is but too cold to grill. Would be even better in the grill

This turned out so great!! I followed the recipe almost completely (I only have a George Foreman grill) but it turned out so good!!! Great combo of flavor and the texture was awesome I was skeptical as it was my first time making a chicken burger. I already know this be a go-to for the summer!!

Always make turkey burgers and this was first chicken burger and we loved them. Seasonings make them so delicious. BBQ sauce and guac on top is outstanding. This recipe is a keeper.

Wow! These are awesome! To be honest, we didn’t have high hopes because we LOVE (beef) burgers. We thought ground chicken might be dry and bland. Not the case at all. These are excellent. The spices, lime juice, jalapeño, and guacamole come together to make a really flavorful chicken burger. Never thought I’d say that, but it’s true. Very good! Try this...you will not be disappointed. Thanks for the recipe!
