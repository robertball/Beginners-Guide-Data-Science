Excellent!!! These definitely come out fluffy!!! I used melted butter for the shortening and accidently doubled the sugar. I doubled the recipe and it fed four, not eight like it should have. Since I only had four to feed, it was okay. I had hoped for leftovers but there were none. This recipe is very quick to throw together. Unlike other reviewers, I did not see the need to sift the flour. I did use a whisk to stir the flour mixture and I also used the whisk to stir when I added the liquid ingredients. The batter comes out very thick and is a little difficult to spread. I debated adding more milk, but decided to leave it as is. I was glad I did. The pancakes came out very light and fluffy. I would suggest cooking these at a medium low heat. If you cook them at too high of a heat, they will get very brown on the outside, but the inside will not be done. Slower cooking will yield great results!!!! Definitely a keeper recipe!!! UPDATE: I have continued to make these wonderful pancakes but have been bothered by the amount of shortening. I decided to use 1/4 cup butter and then increased the low-fat milk by 1/4 cup. They still came out wonderful. I have tried thinning the batter, but find the pancakes do not come out as fluffy. They also taste great with blueberries. As mentioned above, cooking these slowly at a lower heat produces the best results. I find it best to cook just one pancake in the first batch. Once the pancake has browned well, you know your griddle is ready.

I don't understand how people can mess up this recipe and claim they followed ingredients and instructions accurately.  These are simple ingredients and do not vary from many other pancake recipes out there!  Sometimes I think people like to complain JUST to complain.  Anyway, my review of this recipe is that the pancakes were excellent!  They fluffed up after I turned them, browned nicely in my griddle, and my daughter loved them.  Great, easy recipe that (most) people can follow.  Thanks!

This recipe has been a staple in our family.  The only thing I change though is that I sift the flour and I add one more egg.  You need to seperate the eggs.  Yolk can get combined with all the other ingredients.  After all the ingredients are mixed.  Whip the whites of the eggs until they foam up and fold that into the mix a little at a time.  You will have the best pancakes ever!!!  Also pair this with the apple syrup recipe along with the crumbly recipe and throw a little wipping cream on top and you have the supreme daddy of all pancakes!!!

This recipe is good!  The pancakes are very fluffy.  I used vegetable oil instead of shortening and they turned out great.

I finally found it!! Eureka - sp? - anyway - tried so many recipes - even read about different techniques - all motivated by the fact that I knew a pancake house flap jack was only a few tweaks away - and here it is - shortening - can't believe I didn't figure it out considering I make and sell biscuits - so here's my approach: lactose intolerant so used soymilk with some lemon juice (mock buttermilk: 1cup milk:1 Tbsp lemon juice or vinegar-let rest for 5-10 min.) - cut shortening into dry mix 'till coarse - not too fine - whisk egg into wet - add to dry - JUST A FEW STROKES will mix - I finally realize how crucial this is and how those lumps and seemingly unmixed portions you just can't stand not blending actually affect the tenderness (and your pancakes won't be lumpy like you think) - ok - the last - i let the batter sit on the counter (probably should have put in fridge) for about an hour - until i saw lots of little bubbles - those bubbles are the key to your incredibly fluffy pancake - when you pour your batter into the pan DON'T mix - you want as many of those little bubbles as possible - this is why letting batter sit  even overnight makes such great pancakes - the air bubbles form and create super fluffy cakes!!

SO GOOD...These are my family's favorite, loved by 3 picky teens and a 3 year old who has never liked pancakes before. These are wonderful! I made minor adjustments: as written this recipe gets 4 stars, after I did some minor "tweaking" it became a 5 star pancake recipe. I changed the shortening to margarine, increased the sugar to 2.5 tablespoons, increased the baking powder to 2.5 teaspoons, added a teaspoon of vanilla, and a dash of cinnamon. I ususally cook my cakes @ 350 on my griddle, but for these I turned it down to 300. They turned out beautiful, light, fluffy, and delicious!


*Upped the baking powder to 3 t and subst. whole wheat for 1/2 of the flour without anyone noticing a difference in flavor :)

Great for making big pancakes. We used canola oil in place of the shortening, and they turned out really well.

Thanks for this addition!  My kids wanted hotcakes for breakfast and out of pre-mix, it was a delight to find this recipe. I followed the directions as is and think next time I'll try some suggestions from other reviewers (applesauce or canola oil).  I also added about an 1/8 c. additional milk to thin the batter just a bit.  ***NOTE***  Let the batter stand for about 5 minutes to activate all the ingredients. UPDATE:  Since writing this review, I've made these for my kids a few more times.. here's what I've found..  One time I used Canola Oil and didn't care for the taste. Another, I left the batter thicker and added bananas (we really liked that one) and most recently I got to thinking... if this was an "old family favorite", they probably didn't "melt" the shortening, so I cut it into the dry ingredients (after I had sifted them together) and followed the rest of the recipe.

Simple and super tasty.  I followed the recipe as written except I used canola oil instead of the shortening.  They browned and fluffed perfectly.  The recipe is the perfect size for two people (2 pancakes each).  It really does go nicely with a fresh fruit topping and some whipped creme.  This will definitely be replacing bisquick in our house.

Super easy recipe!  Great tasting pancakes!  If I use whole wheat flour I increase the milk by 1/8 to 1/4 cup.

Family enjoyed these pancakes.  Did made a few changes, first by doubling the recipe to feed my family of 5.  Secondly, I used butter instead of shortening and did not double that amount, keeping it a 1/4 cup.  These are great with fresh berries and powdered sugar, and, of course, with maple syrup.  YUM!

It was really easy to make yet super yummy! I am so glad that I will never have to buy another pancake mix again. The ingredients are stuff I already have in the house so it will be no problem to make them on any raining morning. My daughter said it was so fluffy and as a okay pancake lover myself, I agree with her 100%.

The flavor on these is outstanding, and they cook up really tender, with nice crisp edges.  I found them difficult to flip, though, since they were so delicate, but the result is wirth it, even if they do splat a bit.

This recipe makes the perfect amount, not too much. The taste was great. I subbed butter for margarine since I don't buy that stuff. I softened the butter in the microwave and whisked it into the batter. It was a tad lumpy but in the end it melted into the batter when cooking.

Solid pancake recipe, we enjoyed it. No way in heck this would serve 4, unless it's maybe 4 two-year olds. It was just me and my brother eating and he asked where the rest of the pancakes were! I would suggest warming the milk a bit, or at least letting it come to room temp. As soon as I added the pretty cold milk, the shortening was no longer melted, it firmed right back up. No big deal though, I went ahead and added it to the dry ingredients and it all worked out ok.

Hmm. They definitely weren't fluffy but that could be my fault. I used butter instead of shortening and half and half instead of milk. Tasted great...just more crepe-like than pancake-ish.

Very tasty! Make sure to mix the dry ingreds with a fork very well before adding the wet. I got a bite of baking powder and it was not good! Shifting would be good also. These are very good!

These are pretty perfect. I'll add a little bit of cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter sometimes.

I am not in love with pancakes, but I will definitely make these again. I substituted unsalted butter for the shortening, and used almond milk (since I am allergic to regular milk). The butter did not stay melted so the liquid mixture was an interesting consistency. I mixed it with the dry stuff anyway and the pancakes still turned out great. I doubled the batch thinking four pancakes would not be enough, but it made more than I thought. ( 11 med sized pancakes total)

Made these yesterday for breeakfast because I wanted pancakes but had not mix. They came out great! The batter was a little thicker than I was expecting but the pancakes came out fluffy and yummy. I added  cinnamon and vanilla and topped with powdered sugar instead of syrup. Delish :)

I tried this recipe. The pancakes came out fluffy, but I didn’t like how they taste at all! The recipe has far too much baking soda, what makes them quite bitter. It’s a don’t!

I made these pancakes for dinner tonight and it just didn't live up the the reviews.  There was so much shortening (I used butter) I could have squeezed it back out of the cakes when they were done cooking and it left quite a greasy mess on my griddle.  I also didn't really get anything fluffy either.  I hope it was me and not the recipe because the reviews were so great and I was sad not to take part in enjoying some wonderful, fluffy pancakes.

This was a good recipe! It was easy and the pancakes came out fluffy! I did add a little vanilla and instead of shortening I added melted butter/margarine. :)

These were great! I was worried, because as usual, I screwed up the recipe a bit-I chose to use butter instead of shortening, and I microwaved it in a glass cup, it wasn't boiling or anything, but reasonably hot and melted, then I added the milk and the egg into it.  The cold ingredients turned the butter cold too, and it formed little chunks of butter.  I didn't want to stir it to death, and that wouldn't have helped anyway because the butter was cold so I just  cooked them like that.  The batter looked like cottage cheese, so I was doubtful, but other than being a tad on the greasy side due to all the butter melting on the grill as it cooked, they tasted delicious, and were quite fluffy!  I love recipes where even if you screw up, they turn out great!! Can't wait for next time:)

VERY fluffy!  Only I didn't find as much flavor as I would have liked, and I did add vanilla extract.  You know, maybe substitute a quarter cup of flour and use a quarter cup of powered buttermilk. Still, I will make again, love the fluffiness and texture of these pancakes!

Truly the best scratch pancake batter I've ever made!  An absolute keeper.  It's got all the right ingredients and proportions, so it makes a good base to experiment with.  I used self rising flour (and omitted the baking powder), and used 1/4 heavy cream and 1/2 cup of milk, and 2 tablespoons of malted milk powder.  Also, as another reviewer suggested, I used unsalted butter instead of shortening.  I'll be passing this recipe down to my children and grandchildren!  P.S.:  The ad-libs are not attempt to re-write the recipe; just to make the point that if you don't have a certain ingredient in your pantry or fridge (BUMMER!), or if you just want to play around substitions can work out fabulously!

I've made these several times now, and it's the only pancake recipe I use anymore. Very versatile; this morning I used butter because I didn't have any shortening, and I added a teaspoon of cinnamon and a half teaspoon of vanilla extract. They practically melted in your mouth! Thanks for the great recipe.

Quick and easy. Substitute applesauce for the shortening to save a few calories and add a little apple flavor.

This is, by far, the best pancake recipe I've found on here. The ONLY adjustment I made was adding more milk, because I found the batter to be a little to thick to cook right as is. Otherwise........these are tasty, and SUPER fluffy and delicious!

A little more work than a mix, but soooo much better. I have made this twice. The 1st time I used white vinegar, the 2nd time I used apple cider vinegar. I really couldn't see any difference in taste, but the white vinegar seemed to make the pancakes rise a bit higher. I'll take them either way. Light, fluffy and tender. They are almost good enough to eat without any syrup.

I made these pancakes for Christmas morning breakfast. If you like a sweet pancake then this is for you. I substitued melted butter instead of shortening and added a drop of vanilla. Yes the batter was pretty thick, but I left as is and used an icecream scoop to drop batter on the griddle.  If the temp is right, the batter will spread on its own and the pancakes come out perfectly round and fluffy! Hubby enjoyed his Christmas Breakfast!

Worked well with rice milk.  Also worked well halving the shortening to 1/4 c and adding 1/4 c rice milk instead as indicated by another reviewer.

These are my favorite pancakes on this site. I have made these twice once with melted butter and once with vegetable oil.  They were FLUFFY when I used the oil and not so much with the butter.  But the flavor really didn't change.

I love this recipe. I changed it a bit to make it allergy friendly for my son and it turned out great! I skipped the egg and used 1 cup instead of 3/4 cup milk. I also used soy milk instead too. The flavor was so great and they were still fluffy!

I followed the other recipe that replaced the shortening with butter and used 1 cup milk. I have a glass top oven and I kept the heat at about 3-3.5. I also used vegetable oil to cover my Staub pan. This is the easiest and tastiest recipe out there!

These pancakes are tasty and fluffy!  I did make them with shortening. The only changes I made were to double the sugar (to 2 tbsp) and add a splash of vanilla (~1 tsp). Will definitely make these again, especially since I've got a tub of shortening that I don't want to go to waste!

Simple to make and tastes great.  Subbed whole wheat flour and canola oil, and refrigerated for 1 hour.  Added blueberries as well.  The pancakes came out very fluffy - 5/5.

These came out wonderful even though I botched them. I tried remembering the amounts of ingredients in my head (not one of my talents) by the time I made it to my kitchen neither I nor my 6 yr old remembered it right, I put too 2 tsp sugar, 2 tsp baking soda, 1  1/2 cups milk and just poured in some oil -may 1/4 cup. They still came out tasty, you reaaaally can't mess these up! Yummy!

Made these this morning, definitely more fluffy than the mix I was using.  Kids enjoyed them.  Easy to mix/make all staple ingredients.  Thank you!

DELICIOUS!   I added a 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and a tablespoon of cardamom powder.  It was sensational.

Best Recipe I've found.   I will not lose this anytime soon.   My kids can taste the difference.  I've tried other recipes and they always have a complaint.  One complaint is the weird after taste you get with baking powder.  This recipe calls for baking powder, but you don't get the weird baking powder taste like you do with other recipes.  This recipe uses simple ingredients and makes nice and tasty, fluffy pancakes.  Here's a great tip I tried out today.  When you have company over people eat at different times.  So to help keep pancakes warm use that thing that keeps tortillas warm (don't know what it's called)  They kept the pancakes warm for almost an hour!  No one had to use the microwave at all.  Love this recipe.  The search is over!  Breakfast is served!

These were very good pancakes. Great flavor, easy to prepare and they do not require buttermilk, which is nice if you do not keep it on hand. I found that if I cooked them a bit more slowly, they were more fluffy. Very good.

Ok, but too sweet for me. I like syrup on my pancakes so I generally don't like the actual pancake to be sweet. I think I will try this recipe again and  decrease the sugar.

Very very good considered that I've always used pancake mix. Follows recipe except that I used melted butter and pancakes turn out really soft, fluffy and YUM. My hubby & kid loved it. Will be my main pancake recipe from now. Thanks!

This is really good.  I made a few of the changes and doubled the recipe (which I recommend for a family of 4).  I used butter instead of shortening, 2 1/2 tbls of sugar, vanilla and cinnamon.  Yum!

Only change I made was I used butter in place of the shortening.  SO GOOD!  I couldn't believe how thick they were and they looked like they were going to be really heavy.  I was pleasantly surprised at how light and fluffy these were. I used a ladle to get them onto the griddle so my batch only made 7 pancakes, but for only the 3 of us it was perfect amount. This will be a staple in our house and no more box mixes! For those who say the batter is thick, let it be thick.  Makes for thicker pancakes.  Just be sure to cook at about a medium heat so they cook all the way through and not burn.

I've been looking for the perfect pancake recipe on this site--I think I've found it!  I used margarine in place of shortening and omitted the salt.  I made mini pancakes (about two tablespoons of batter each) and they were fluffy, melt-in-your mouth, and cooked to a beautiful golden brown.  I added butterscotch chips to half the batch and suggest it.  I don't typically like pancakes (usually make them for my family), but I LOVE this recipe in terms of taste, texture, and presentation.  5 stars!

These were great pancakes!  The batter was a little thick so we added about 1/4 cup of extra milk, plus a little vanilla.  I also used butter flavored shortening since I had some to use up.   My kids loved them, and this is such an easy recipe I will use it again for sure!

The best pancakes.  Only changes I made was to sift the dry ingredients, wet ingredients at room temp., added a tsp. of vanilla, and used butter instead of shortening.  Great, light, and fluffy!

These turned out great! I added in a little vanilla. Next time I use less salt though. I liked the texture and how nice they cut, they didn't turn rubbery like box mixes do. For now on, I'll make my own.

A great recipe! :) As others suggested, I also used 1/4 cup of margarine instead of shortening. 

I combined the flour, sugar, baking powder,salt, milk, shortening first and I added an egg at the end.  

The pancakes were very good. I will definitely make this again :)

These are super-fluffy and a fantastic base pancake. I used whole wheat flour, added 1/4 cup more milk, and used butter instead of shortening. To spice things up, I also added a bunch of nutmeg and cinnamon, and sliced up an apple in the batter. With a little maple syrup on top, these were a decadent treat!

Spur of the moment decision to have pancakes for dinner last night, and needed a simple recipe where I had all the ingredients on hand.  This was perfect and definitely lived up to its name - the pancakes turned out perfectly fluffy!  The only change I made was to sub. 2 Tbsp. veg. oil for the shortening, as others suggested.  Only did that because I never have shortening.  I mixed up the batter, hubby did the cooking, and our somewhat picky 2 year old gobbled his up.  FYI I doubled the recipe, and it made 7 plate- size pancakes.  will definitely keep this recipe on hand and may experiment in the future, adding chocolate chips, blueberries, or just plain with warm syrup!  Yum!  Thanks for the post.

Simple and easy recipe with ingredients that are readily on hand.  The pancakes turned out light, fluffy, and tasty but were not extraordinary.  I replaced the shortening with vegetable oil.  I would probably use this recipe again.

WOW, super fluffy pancakes from scratch. Hungry Jack has just lost my business. I substituted buttermilk for the milk, and vegetable oil for the melted shortening, and they were incredible. Very nice topped off with strawberries and whip cream.

I used Butter Flavored Crisco sticks instead of plain shortening...tasted great and we didn't need to use butter on top of the pancakes! (Hey, we can save calories in lots of little places, kind of like drinking Diet Coke with a Big Mac and Fries)

Just as promised, these are quick and easy, and it made a small amount.  This recipe made 6 4-1/2" pancakes that were fluffy and delicious.  I used about 1 Tbs. of oil instead of 1/4 c. melted shortening.

These pancakes come out tasting great and are extremely simply to make. I also just used melted butter for the shortening. Only problem with this is the servings say 4 but it really only feeds about 2 people. I guess just depends on how big you make the pancakes. Just double up for more guest. Great recipe thanks!

These are wonderful! Fluffy, and delicious with nice crispy outer edges.. I used whole wheat flour and coconut oil and they absolutely melt in your mouth. However, this recipe made about 4 average sized pancakes and my 2 and 3 year old ate ALL of them So I suggest doubling if you are feeding more than 1-2 people. This will be my 'go to' recipe for pancakes from now on. Thank you!

simple and easy, just what I was looking for.  I find the simplest recipes for pancakes the easiest to work with.  They are the most versatile and I can do whatever I want with them, adding any spice or fruit to the mix I want.  I ground oatmeal and used it instead of flour and used peanut oil instead of shortening.  Then added cinnamon and nutmeg.

Very fluffy, filling, and tasted wonderful! I substituted melted butter for shortening as others suggested. I also used whole wheat flour rather than white flour - and it turned out great!

These were so easy and great tasting!  I was out of all-purpose flour, so I subbed self-rising.  Because of this, I used less than a teaspoon of baking powder.  I increased the sugar slightly.  I used salted butter instead of shortening, so I, also, omitted the salt.  After I mixed the wet and dry ingredients, the batter seemed a little thick, so a added another splash of milk.  The final result was light, fluffy, and delicious pancakes!

I doubled the recipe and switched out butter for shortening and added another 1/4 cup of milk like Mary Domaz suggested. They were easy to make, cooked fast, evenly, and everyone liked them. They are very fluffy and taste great! I fed 4, but had some leftovers. It really depends on how big you make them and how much each person eats. This is my new go-to pancake recipe!

I love this recipe.  Doesn't require as much ingredients as other recipes and comes out great.  I live outside the US so can't get the usual box pancake mixes (Aunt J) I grew up with but with this recipe I see no need for those any more.  I had no shortening so like a lot of others, substituted that with butter.  Also sprinkled a few (8 or so) blueberries on top of the pancake when cooking and chopped up a bunch of strawberries to eat with.  Perfect way to start out the day!

To be honest these didn't really blow me away :( I followed the instructions to the letter and the batter looked great. It made 10 palm sized pancakes. However, I could taste the baking powder (it did seem a lot for the amount of flour) and despite the large amount of baking powder, they didn't rise as much as my usual recipe. They actually tasted like a basic thick batter, nothing special (unless you like that baking powder after taste).

Great recipe, easy and tastes wonderful!  I used crisco butter shortening like I use in my cookies.  Don't stress but you can't get all the lumps out but it is ok.  Pancakes don't turn out lumpy, shortening melts and pancakes turn out perfect!  I did add a touch of brown sugar to our batter.  This recipe is now my go to for our Pancakes!

I make these pancake often they are the best! I use butter instead of shortening and I use self rising flour, which is the trick to make them as fluffy as clouds. These go over real big in our house, and pancake breakfast's. Love this recipe.

Good stuff - I doubled the recipe and doubled the sugar, added a tsp. of cinnamon and vanilla and used butter in place of the shortening.  These are almost as good as Fluffy Pancakes by kris.

Made this according to original recipe. Found the batter to be very thick, so I added in the extra 1/4C of milk and then cooked them. They turned out almost perfect. I made a second batch with the vanilla suggested by others and this was the missing piece. These ones (still with the additional milk) were perfect.  So 4 stars for recipe as it is. If you up the milk to 1C and add vanilla, its 5 stars!

I loved this pancakes!! Just made them with my hubby alongside his awesome pepperjack omelets! YUM! I used the veggie oil instead of shortening and 1% milk made them very easy to pour w/o taking away from the fluffy factor. I also added a pinch of nutmeg & cinnamon(which I do to all my pancakes mixes) and we made to nice sized waffles instead of pancakes!! These are going in my book!!

Wonderful pancakes! I took the advice from others and substituted butter for the shortening and did 1 c milk instead of 3/4. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla. Quick, easy, very delicious!! :)

This was yummy! I doubled the recipe, added a splash of vanilla to the egg mixture, added some cinnamon and brown sugar to the flour mixture and yum! The only thing I changed was I used vegetable oil instead of shortening. And for the doubled recipe, I would add a little less flour, but other than that, these were fluffy and delicious!

These pancakes are delicious but a little too fluffy. I usually cut the baking powder by 1/2 tsp. They are a favorite in our house on the weekends!

These were by far the best pancakes I've ever ate in my entire life. I looking for a scratch recipe for pancakes when I found this one. While I enjoy Bisquick as much as the next busy mom, we were out (or most everything). I was hoping that pancakes were as simple as a figured they were and when I lucked across this recipe I discovered I was right. There was nothing in this that the standard cook doesn't have in their cabinets/fridge on a daily basis. I was thrilled with the texture and flavor of these. I might never return to boxed mixes! I did make one addition. I've for years been adding a teaspoon or two of vanilla to my pancake mixes. After mixing the batter per directions and tasting it, I did decide to amp up the sugar (by more than a little) and continue with my vanilla addition. Still they were amazing. My kids had 4 apiece and my very picky husband at 6! Kudos to the good food!

This was a very easy recipe to follow, and it taste great. The pancakes were very fluffy. I subbed butter for the margarine and used soy milk instead of regular and added a bit of vanilla. Also had to add a little more milk than the recipe called for, but overall my family enjoyed them.
Thanks for the recipe

FYI...this recipe only yields about 5 pancakes. I substitute cinnamon applesauce (4 tbsps.) for shortening for an added flavor and it's better for you! Yum!

I liked this recipe. We substituted real butter for the shortening. It was a quick recipe with common ingredients so this is a recipe that will go in my recipe book. The taste is not spectacular but it is good for a quick pancake recipe.

Great recipe--one of the few that our kitchen had all the ingredients for. I made it for my mom and I, and it was perfect for two people. Delicious, light and fluffy pancakes. I cooked it on medium low heat and they turned out great!

Yes they are very fluffy pancakes but all of that baking powder gave the pancakes a bitter taste.

This recipe is perfect and so simple!  My husband swears I make the absolute best pancakes, thanks to the recipe.  If we eat pancakes anywhere else--a friend's house or a restaurant--he always whispers to me, "But yours are so much better!"  When I double the recipe I have to be careful the consistency of the batter is right.  So, I would make the original several times before doubling it, so you'll know what your looking for.  It's delish!!

EXCELLENT! As a couple reviewers have mentioned, I don't know how anyone could screw this recipe up, since it's so easy. I don't normally have shortening on hand, so I used melted butter instead, and my pancakes still came out fluffy. I did add a little bit of vanilla, but that's just because I love the stuff. Great flavor--I ate one right after I took it off the griddle. I'm definitely keeping this recipe--thanks!

Holy cow, what a great recipe. Made it just the way they did and did not change anything. Nice to see a recipe that does not cost an arm and leg to make. I will toss out the old pancake recipe and use this recipe from now on. thank you for sharing.

FLUFFY? I don't think so......could have done better with a mix. Batter was runny, should have been my first clue. This recipe says 4 servings, I don't think so again! I gave this 2 stars because of the flavor. Would I make these again? NO!

After trying a different recipe every weekend for the past 2 months I have to say I'm satisfied with this one.  I (like others) added a tsp of vanilla and a little more sugar and they came out perfect.  Great basic recipe!!

Great basic recipe! Very versatile and fluffy, browned well too. I cut back a little on the sugar and substituted a dash of pure maple syrup as well as a dash of vanilla extract. Uoi can also use lemon juice or extract to sour your milk if you don't want to use vinegar. I added chocolate chips to the last half of the batch, and I imagine you could add lots of other things as well. Pumpkin, oats, fruit, among other things. As other people have mentioned, this made about 7 average pancakes. Not quite enough to serve three people. But perfect for one or two!

Great pancakes, and very easy to make.  Only 4 stars, b/c did add a bit more sugar to them.  I think they would be missing something without it, but still a great recipe!

Hubby loved these and they were good but I would use butter in place of shortening. Maybe it was just me but I could taste the shortening.

Easy and delicious recipe for fluffy pancakes. Even my picky eating Boyfriend enjoyed these! I used melted butter instead of shortening, just because I like the flavor of buttered pancakes lol. Wonderful recipe.

I substituted oil for shortening and cut the amount in half.  I made up for the lack of liquid with milk and vanilla.   It was delicious and we were happy with the result but the amount was tiny.  The recipe says it yields enough for 4 people, but it only makes about 4 small pancakes.

The second time I made this I used melted butter and while they toast up to an incredible brown color...I'm left with more baking soda flavor than I'd like.

Any tips on getting rid of that?

I have never used shortening with pancakes and never will!  Even on the lowest setting they burned on the outside and didn't cook on the inside.  I've been making pancakes a long time and never had this problem.  I don't complain just to complain.  I followed the recipe exactly and ended up throwing out the entire thing!  I had to waist food, but they just were not good.

i have searched for a years for the perfect fluffy pancake recipe, and this is IT!! made as directed, except substituted melted butter for the shortening. mixed all dry ing together, whisked, then mixed all wet ing together, whisked, THEN mixed these together, just till moistened. made a very light, fluffy pancake. we always add fresh blueberries from my parents farm to them, yummy! one thing i may do differently next time is sift the flour, as i had a few lumps in my pancakes, but other than that, a great recipe as written!

These pancakes are awesome! They are so light and fluffy and flavorful that my daughter eats them without syrup. We now keep a batch in the freezer for those busy mornings when homemade pancakes just aren't on the menu. 30 seconds in the mic. and they're good as gold. Thanks for the great recipe!

*****
Addition: 1/12/2010-  Here we are still using this recipe and it is as good as ever.  I do not use the shortening but use 2 TBL veg. oil and 1/8C applesauce.  Still good as gold. My daughter is still eating them for breakfast and loving every bite!

Excellent exactly as written.  I double the recipe for our family of four.  I've made them 52 times...every Saturday morning for one year!  Mine are always perfect when I measure carefully (we don't like them as much when I reduce the salt) and cook them on my cheap, old (but fantastic) Presto griddle at 315°.  315° is a low-medium heat, but I find the pancakes turn out better when cooked at this lower heat.    I sometimes replace half of the white flour with whole wheat flour.  I prefer the slightly chewier texture, but my husband and kids like the all-white ones better.  Thank you Eugene for sharing your family recipe!  We are grateful that it's become our family recipe too!

Very good. I decided to change up my pancake recipe and try something other than the Cinnamon Griddle Cakes. ;) I doubled this and used buttermilk. I made no other changes. We all loved these light and fluffy pancakes. I served them with crisp bacon and Cinnamon Cream Syrup, which is also from this site.

Definitely a keeper!  Simple, basic, and perfect for a one-person household.  This recipe truly does serve two.  I've substitute 1/8 cup Canola oil and thought it tasted perfect.  The baking powder really amps up the fluffiness.

I don't ever have shortening, so I did what the everyone else did: used 1 cup of milk in place of 3/4c and 2 tbsp. oil for shortening. These are awesome.

These were very fluffy and texture was good.  I think they might have been a little plain had I not added a little vanilla.  I also only used 1/4 tsp salt, as we watch salt here and I don't think they needed the salt.  To the posters that thought these were to 'SALTY', you might want to check your "baking soda" for the expire date, if its old it will make things taste salty.  My fav way to top, peanut butter, bananas and syrup.

These are the best Pancakes ever! I don't really know what shortening is so instead of replacing it with anything I just left it out and it tasted excellent anyway, I tried once replacing shortening with butter but it tastes better when you just leave the ingredient all together.

Thanks so much for the recipe! I make it every morning.

These were the best pancakes from scratch ever. I didn't have shortening so i used butter instead. I didn't melt the butter all the way and left little chunks of butter in the batter. it melted as they cooked. It was good. And I added vanilla.

This recipe was alright.  Not the best, but I'll probably use it again.  Substitutions: 1) used veg oil 2) added vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, & blueberries.  Husband said they were good.  Definitely cook on Low-Med heat.  Thanks!

These were OK, but honestly they reminded me of pancakes you make with Bisquick.  They were very thick and cakey.  I prefer light spongy pancakes so I won't be making this again.

These came out super both times I made them.  I didn't have shortening so I used canola oil instead and that worked great.  Also, my daughter has serious egg allergies so I used Ener-G's egg replacer and this turned this into into an egg-free pancake recipe that our whole family could eat!

SOO easy!  I won't ever buy quick mix pancakes.  I put everything into my food processor and it's done!  From start to finish, I have freshly made pancakes in 15mins.  My 5 year old asks for them all the time!  I use oil for the shortening and makes it even easier!

This was a great and EASY recipe.  I did make a few adjustments... I only used 1 1/2 tsp. of baking powder because I don't like the bitter taste and i used melted butter instead of oil.(I did heat the milk slightly so the butter wouldn't "clump" as another person said when the melted butter hits the cold milk)  Next time i will double the recipe...it only made 7 med/small sized pancakes which was only enough for my son and his best friend (they're 10!! and love pancakes)

Not my favorite pancakes.  My kids didn't really like them either.  I guess we don't like "fluffy" pancakes.  I thought that they were heavy and doughy.  Next time I'll look for a thin pancake recipe.  As an experienced cook, I knew enough to let the melted shortening cool a little.  If you are not so experienced, make sure the shortening is cool.  Otherwise, it will solidify when you add the milk or cook the eggs if you add them first.

This is my new pancake standby.  Really yummy with brown sugar instead of white, and a few tablespoons of wheat germ.  Next time I might try whole wheat pastry flour.  Easy and lovely, especially with a few berries on top. ;-)

Excellent.  I added a half a teaspoon of vanilla extract, but otherwise kept the recipe as is.  Really good.

With a few small additions these were by far the best pancakes I've made!

I used melted butter, added some cinnamon, vanilla extract and a little almond extract. The batter is very thick, but don't let this scare you - it comes out perfect. Did not make four servings though- more like three. If you have big appetites or larger family double the recipe. Even hubby who rarely eats pancakes not only devoured them but wanted more.

These were so good they only needed a small amount of maple syrup. I usually add a little butter to the syrup and heat it in the microwave for 20-30 seconds to make it nice and warm. This will be the only recipe I use from now on with the changes I made.

the best pancakes ever. I've made these about a dozen times now. I usually use vegetable oil instead of melted shortening, comes out the same just easier.

We made this for supper tonight and it was delicious! I tripled the recipe and it made more than enough for 2 teen boys my 7yo daughter, hubby and I. I Followed recipe exactly but did sift the dry ingredients and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon. I also added 1 capfull of vanilla to the wet ingredients. Dropped some blueberries on top before flipping as well.  They were great, nice and fluffy and not dry at all. Still have plenty left for breakfast in the morning too!
 
edit: Mar 9, 2008: Crisco butter flavored shortening make s these extra yummy ;)

This is a great recipe. I made about 20 servings and my family can't get enough.
I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon powder for the sweet aroma.

Very easy, foolproof pancakes.  Followed recipe exactly using butter for the melted shortening.  I thought they were absolutely fabulous.  Other adults felt too thick (they are thin pancake fans). When it isn't just me & the kids I increase the milk to 1c otherwise the thick, spread the batter pancakes are what we love!  Either way they are light and fluffy, definitely not heavy and "cakey".  I would add that if anyone tried these and they weren't fluffy then maybe their baking powder might be too old?

turned out pretty fluffy.  I liked it.  Things I did differently: added a teaspoon of cinnamon, sustituted butter for shortening, and added two tablespoons of oil.  Would definitely make again.

I normally use a box mix, but my little boy had a friend sleep over last night and this morning they wanted pancakes. Of course I didn't have any box mix in my pantry so I quick went on allrecipes to find a recipe. I didn't taste them but the boys thought they were great. They cooked up nice and fluffy. I didn't have any shortning so I used some vegetable oil and I also added a little pure vanilla extract into the mix. I like the idea that the recipe was already broken down and I got 4 good size pancakes which is what I needed.

This is a great Base pancake recipe.  I have made these based on recipe (except I use real butter instead of shortening) and they are fluffy and easy to make!  I recommend adding vanilla and a little extra milk.  I often mix in extra ingredient such as nuts, fresh fruit, flax meal, wheat germ and use whole wheat flour making a more nutritious pancake!  I love this recipe...you can "play" with it and add your own touches or follow it exactly and they turn out great everytime! Thanks for sharing!

Very simple!  I took the advise of one poster who said it would taste better with butter/margarine and I used 1/8 c melted butter and 1/8 c melted shortening.  That's the only thing I changed.  Vanilla, cinnamon, or your fav. fruit topping would spruce this up, but sometimes plain old pancakes are just as good!

Wow!  I didn't have any shortening on hand, so I used margarine as one other reviewer suggested, and they still turned out great!  I made the first four plain and topped them with fresh strawberries and cream, then made the second four (the second four came out really big and could've easily been six) with chocolate chips for my son, who adores them.  So much better than Bisquick.  Thanks!

Super easy and my husband LOVED them! :)
(I'm updating this review on 7/6/07...My hubby and I have made this a tradition on Sunday nights.  I've made them over and over and over again and just last night (I must have been in a hurry) I totally forgot the shortening!  I was nervous about it, but they actually turned out just fine!  I mean...shortening definitely helps, but for a lighter version, use less or none at all! :)

I wanted something to have on hand for these summer days when all the seem to kids crawl out of bed at different times, so
I scaled this recipe to 24 servings, prepared them, and tossed them all in freezer bags to be frozen 'til ready to eat. I got about 48 pancakes out of this recipe, using 1/4 c. serving size. The only change I made was to have used applesauce in place of the shortening. I also made a smaller batch using applebutter instead and those also came out very well. Good recipe. Thanks!

Delicious!  I doubled the recipe- added a mashed banana to the wet ingredients, subbed melted butter for the shortening and stirred blueberries into the final batter.  I let the batter sit for about 10 minutes before I made the pancakes.  They were WONDERFUL- not the kind of pancakes that make your belly feel bloated and gross all day!  Light and fluffy and DELICIOUS!  Next time, I'm going to sub buttermilk for the regular milk in this recipe and I think I'll have the pancakes that my grandma made for us when we were little!  YUM!  I don't feel like a pancake failure anymore!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

First of all let me say that I haven't eaten pancakes for YEARS as they make me feel bloated and gross. Ick!
I made these and ate 4 for them! They don't give that nasty full feeling. They taste great and I, unfortunately, could eat them every day.

Very easy, extremely fluffy.  Can be a little dry, but tastes great.  I added syrup to the liquids, as well as cinnamon, nutmeg and extra sugar to the dry.  I make these every weekend.

I tried these pancakes when I ran out of the mix I usually use and they were wonderful! Needless to say, I don't buy boxed mix anymore. I used margarine in place of the shortening and add a little liquid vanilla hazelnut coffee creamer in place of about 1/4 cup of the milk and my family loved it. Also, I got a really smooth consistency by adding the melted margarine after mixing all the other ingredients together.

I loved this recipe!!! I am a teenager, and i love making these pancakes. Sometimes when i use this recipe, i thin the batter out using milk, so the pancakes don't come out so thick and fluffy. Most of the time though, i like the batter thick and fluffy. Thanks so much for the recipe!!! :D

These wonderful pancakes were fluffy and filling. These are my family's favorite. Thank you for sharing your recipe. (I didn't have shortening, so after some investigation on a suitable substitution [google search], I used butter.)

I have made this recipe a few times now. Everytime it comes out great! I don't change a thing (except for maybe 1 tsp of vanilla). But it is great and I love it! ^_^

One of the best homemade pancake recipes on here. I used butter rather than shortening (as all I had was lard, and don't care much for the taste) and they came out all right. The only thing I found was that the salt stands out a little too much. Next time I might use less, or add a little more sugar.

while i agree that this recipe only feeds 2 adults in our house, we really like it.  we have a baby with food allergies, so rice milk, coconut oil for the shortening and half a banana (plus tblsp water) for the egg were all substituted and the recipe worked perfectly.  thanks!

These are amazing. I love how they are not too sweet and they fluff up really nice. They also turn out every time I make them. I make them for my daycare and they always ask for thirds :)

This turned out perfect! like a few others, I used veg oil instead of shortening. Also, I thought it looked too thick, so added extra milk. DON'T. Although they're fine with the extra, they're perfect without!

These were absolutely great! They had a smooth golden texture on both sides (something I haven't gotten with other recipes since I use a nonstick pan instead of a griddle). I modified it a bit: since I had self-rising flour, I only used 1tsp of baking powder. I also replaced the shortening (we don't have it where I live) with melter butter.  I also only used 1 tbsp of sugar since I was going to use Nutella and it was going to be too sweet.  And last, I added a tsp of vanilla extract.  Absolutely delicious!

I don't often make pancakes from a homemade recipe, more of a bisquick girl on that. But I enjoyed how quickly these were made and hot off the griddle in no time. Made Mickey Mouse shapes. They raised real well: always let the batter sit a few minutes before pouring.

I've been looking for a good pancake recipe for a while now... and I found it.  I used melted butter in place of the shortening, but did everything else as instructed.  The pancakes were nice and fluffy and they were delicious.  Only feedback would be that I needed to feed four and the recipe said four, but I think 1.5 x the recipe would have been more what I needed because we were a little short.  The batter is really thick so they take a while to cook, but are well worth the wait.

This is a fabulous recipe for people with limited time! Had pancakes up on the table in just 10 minutes after finding this gem! Used self raising flour instead of flour, salt and baking powder and they turned out just perfect! Though I had to add a little bit more milk to get the consistency right. A+ Recipe!

Following the recipe yields great pancakes, I used canola oil instead of butter or shortening and they were very good. However the site would not let me update the servings so I literally doubled the recipe.  This made them less fluffy and they were not as tasty. I will stick to only 4 servings and keep true to the recipe..

I made these this morning for  my husband and 3 yo grand daughter.  They both really enjoyed them.  Of course as usual for me I substituted at least 1/2 the flour with white whole wheat flour. I always use the white whole wheat that way, my family doesn't even realize they are getting whole wheat.

these were really great!  however...when i got done mixing...the batter was more dough-like than batter.  i added more milk and i also added a dash of vanilla extract.  i have to say these were the BEST pancakes i've ever made!  perfectly fluffy!

Thanks a lot for this recipe. I have tried a lot of pancake recipes on this site and others and this is by far the best one, out of roughly 30 different ones.   I use margarine instead cause I live in Sweden and we dont have shortening, works great! :D really fluffly.

I followed the recipe exact, but used vegetable oil instead of the shortening, and I added vanilla and cinn. These did not fluff up, but other than that they were ok. Looking for more of a fluff.

I will be using this again.  I followed the recipe exact and found that the shortning did solidify which I felt made the cakes burn easily so I  will be warming up the milk next time.  Happy cooking!

Great Recipe! And i always use soymilk or almond milk as a substitute--comes out great!  We've been using white rice flour alot and it also worked great as a sub, along with organic sugar.  To spice it up a bit, we added some nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla extract, and at the end placed in some unsweetened coconut flakes. YUM!

Note that you need to warm your milk before mixing it with the melted shortening.  Otherwise the shortening will solidify in the cold milk leaving you with a big lumpy mess you will  have to microwave to melt again.

I was so happy to be making homemade pancakes, and I followed the recipe to the tee, and it came out very thin, not sweet at all, and this makes at best  none  sweet crepes, but Pancakes not so much. To help understand what I am saying, it was really heavy, way too buttery and flat... no puff nothing.. well i hope this will be helpful.

Really great recipe when you want to serve pancakes and you don't have buttermilk around.  I could not use melted shortening (it just didnt seem right!) so I used canola oil and it was fabulous.  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla.  I didnt have all purpose flour so i used bread flour and they were really fluffy and yummy.  I also thinned it out a bit with extra milk as needed.

This was exactly was I as looking for.  I did change to 1/4 cup melted butter and added 1/2 tsp vanilla..  Let it rest for 5 min I think makes a big difference before cooking I folded it with a spatula and added blueberries.  Cooked on Med heat.

This has become staple in our home.  We live very rural and raise 80% of our own foods.  Using mainly organic ingredients, you can add many things to these.  We don't use shortening, but butter.  Fresh or frozen blueberries, strawberries, loganberries, etc.  Carob chips are a favorite weekend treat as well.  We do not use canola oil to cook anymore. We use a little rice oil in the bottom of the griddle for cooking.  I normally quadruple the  amount so that some go into the freezer for the kids on cold mornings before school.  To fluff them even more, use duck eggs instead of chicken.  They come out even more rich like a dessert.

Fluffy and aesthetically appealing pancakes, but I could tell that these were made with shortening.  Just think of the difference of eating bread and crisco and not bread and butter.

The batter turns out way thicker than what I'm used to. The first pancake *poured* into a griddle preheated at a low heat browned on the outside long before it cooked on the inside. I added about another 1/4 cup of milk to the remaining batter which made it much easier to work with and they were still light, fluffy and tasty :)

From the mouth of the kids (who are eating these as I type) "Awesome", "Everyone should eat these", "Best pancakes ever".  Used butter as my shortening and these turned out wonderful.

I will never buy the box mix ever....After trying this recipe. I followed just as it said but, added 1/4 c of margarine did not have butter or oil. I also added a TSP of old fashioned oats and another of walnuts. Delicioso... I put a dash more of milk.

Great stuff!  Definitely heed the poster who suggested substituting milk for half of the butter, you'll never miss all that extra fat.  Vanilla is a great adddition also.  Thanks for the recipe!

These pancakes are definately flu-ffy! They came out 'As thick as a slice of bread', my dad said. The only adjustments I made were to add a teaspoon of vanilla and use canola oil (about 1/4 cup) instead of shortening. I poured a splash more of milk in to thin it out, but these pancakes were perfect slathered with some peanut butter, maple syrup, and washed down with a glass of milk! :)

i have been trying several different pancake recipes from this site to see if one can replace our tried-and-true bisquick sunday morning tradition.  sad to say, this will not be the recipe to do it.  the texture was "ok" at best, and the taste was just very bland.  maybe some vanilla would cure this?  anyway i won't make these again, back to bisquick for us.

I've made this pancake recipe twice now and they have seriously been some of the best pancakes I've ever had or made. It's such a simple recipe to mix together.  The only thing that I've added to it is a tiny splash of vanilla, which I think has been a great addition.   The other thing I did last time was I warmed the milk while melting the shortening. I did it the second time because the shortening seemed to clump up from the cold milk. But the second time I was worried that I was starting to cook the batter before it was in the pan. Maybe the third time I'll get it right.

FANTASTIC recipe! The only change I made was butter instead of shortening. They were so good

I changed the recipe but I used those general amounts of dry and wet. I used marg, soy milk and whole wheat flour and added chocolate chips. Next time I would add oats for some of the flour but they are really good and easy. Thanks!

These were pretty good. The batter was really thick, but I think the pancakes still came out fluffy. I wasn't completely wowed by the recipe, so I'm gunna keep looking for better recipes. Nonetheless, I would make this again.

This is a family favorite. Perfect no matter the size you make them or the topping. It's often asked for dinner too! Also, I multiply this recipe by 3 (sometimes more) and  freeze the leftovers, even after heating in the microwave they taste fresh and the boys love them.

These were great - fluffy as promised, with a great taste. My only (small) complaint was that they didn't seem to keep very long. The first ones I made were sort of rubbery by the time I finished cooking all of them. Other than that they were great. My family loved them. I used a 1/4 measuring cup to measure out each pancake and found that this was a pretty generous recipe - it definitely made more than 8 good-sized pancakes.

Good recipe; however, the pancakes really weren't fluffy.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding 1 tsp of vanilla as others had suggested.  I will continue looking for another pancake recipe that yields fluffier pancakes.

My family absolutely loves this recipe. For years, I made nothing but Bisquick pancakes. No more! I sometimes add bananas, vanilla, and walnuts to give my children a bit more variety but they love them plain too. I usually double the recipe (sometimes triple) because the recipe, as is, doesn't seem to make enough. If there are leftovers, I freeze them so my children can heat them up for the next morning. Absolutely fantastic pancakes!!

A great pancake recipe! I made a double batch for my family of five. But I could easily have done a triple. 4 out of 5 got two medium pancakes each. I don't understand why there is shortening in the mix. It doesn't affect the flavor much.

These were so light and fluffy.  We cut down the butter (shortening) by 1/4 and will try to cut down another  1/4 next time.  Absolutely delicious (especially  with a few added chocolate chips).

These were good pancakes; the recipe is very similar to the one in Betty Crocker's cookbook.  I too added a full cup of milk and 2 tbsp canola oil.  They came out very well.  Try this variation.

I forgot the shortening and these were still the BEST pancakes EVER!  Light, fluffy, each one was about 1/2" thick and tasted great.  I didn't miss the shortening, so I'm not going to add it next time, either!  Thank you so much for this recipe.

These were probably the best pancakes I've ever made! Thanks for the recipe! I tripled the recipe, and I used 1 part margarine + 2 parts shortening, for the fat. I took the advice of another reviewer, and cut the shortening/margarine into the flour (I didn't melt it). I also added 1 tsp. vanilla. So yummy, and very fluffy. I also followed another reviewer, and cooked them slowly, on a 300 degree electric griddle. I will surely be making these again! :)

I made this a few months ago...not really what I was looking for..Mine tasted too floury and didn't really fluff up. I think I would need to play around with maybe adding more flavoring to it.

This is way better than any boxed pancake mix I have made.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and used butter instead of shortening and added a dash of cinnamon and splash of vanilla.  I let the batter sit for about 10 minutes before putting them on the griddle.  A great way to start the day!

These pancakes are the perfect texture, very fluffy! I tripled the recipe to make them for 3 hungry guys and myself, and it made eight large pancakes plus I had enough mix left over for about two more. I found the taste a little bit bland for my liking so I used an extra tbsp sugar and about a tsp of cinnamon. I also used melted low fat margarine instead of shortening, which turned out fine. Overall this is an excellent recipe.

This recipe is awesome! I've finally mastered the art of pancake-making because of this recipe. I didn't change anything except that I added a little bit more sugar and fresh blueberries! The secret to making them golden, though, is to have it on a really low temp and let it brown slowly. It takes like 4 mins each pancake but definitely worth the presentation!

Yummy!  I made these as stated the first time, and they were perfect.  I made them again today and was feeling lazy, so I subbed in oil for the shortening and they were still just as awesome. ^_^  Thanks!

These were very good. I did have to add a bit more flour for ours.  Some people prefer their pancakes thin, some thick, so it's really a matter of preference.  I let the batter sit for about ten minutes in the fridge before I made them, and I think that made a huge difference as far as fluffiness.

These pancakes were great.  I made a few changes to them. I used whole wheat pastry flour, 2.5 tsp baking powder, 1 cup milk, and 1 tsp vanilla.  This is a good base recipe that I cannot wait to try different things with.  I will try to use vanilla yogurt next time (I use the yogurt instead of buttermilk in cake recipes).

People are being far too generous with these pancakes. Yes the pancakes were fluffy as advertised, they tasted pretty good, and the recipe itself was also easy to follow and quick to prepare. Unfortunately the pancakes taste just like the pancakes made from a box mix(like Aunt Jemima). I don't mean to be rude or anything, but I'm not searching the internet trying different pancake recipes  just so I can end up with something that I could have made in half the time and ingredients by using the premade mix in my pantry.

I made these tonight for dinner using buttermilk and whole wheat flour. They were so fluffy and very delicious. I have a family of four with a couple big eaters so I had to double the recipe. Next time, I will triple it to have more to stock in the fridge. They are SO easy! If you are new to pancake making you will find this recipe pretty easy. I did sub oil for shortening. I can't tell if it were to make a difference b/c I have only made them this way. I didn't have any shortening. I never use that stuff! I also added a drop or two of vanilla because that's how my dad always made them.    
The batter was thick because of the buttermilk. I used a little extra buttermilk and then thinned the batter a TINY bit using a couple teaspoons of water. The buttermilk gives them a more homestyle, old fashioned flavor! These were fabulous!

We love this recipe, but we've tweaked it a bit...instead of shortening we use butter- MUCH better tasting and also add a Tbsp of vanilla.

I thought the recipe was ok. Mine were flat flat and were browning pretty quick, even on a number 1 setting on the gridle. I only added 1 teaspoon of vanilla to the recipe so that should not have made them go flat. Sorry i'll look for another.

These were very easy to make when you have little time. I used self-rising flour since I didn't have any baking powder. They turned out very fluffy. The kids loved them. I will most definately make theses every Sunday morning.

WOW!!  Thanks for not keeping this recipe in the family!!  These were great!!  I usually use Bisquick; we have pancake lunch every Sunday; and I was out of pancake mix!! I didn't want to run to the store just for pancake mix and thought I would look up a recipe for them.  I have never made pancakes from scratch; and I must say; too easy; my family loved them!  Thick batter; fluffy pancakes!  I used shortening as the recipe called; but I see other members say it's great with a butter/margarine sub.  I think I will try that next time just for kicks!  Again; thanks for the recipe; I WILL NEVER BUY PANCAKE MIX AGAIN!

Followed recipe as is except used margarine because I didn't have any shortening.  Made these a couple times - they are delicious!  Definitely light and fluffy and have a good texture.  Just made these as ginger pancakes (added 1/2 tbsp EACH of cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger).  I've also paired the original recipe and the ginger one with a banana lemon sauce - an awesome alternative to maple!

The best pancake recipe I've ever tried.  My son requested REAL homemade pancakes for "Pancake Day", Shrove Tuesday.  He was not disappointed! They were delicious and fluffy. I took the advice of another reviewer and used melted unsalted butter in place of the shortening and used a touch more milk to thin out the batter a bit.  It's nice to have a pancake recipe that does not call for buttermilk, as it is not something you always have in the fridge! Delicious!

Really nice pancakes.  The only thing I changed was using butter instead of shortening and that gave it a really nice flavor.  Will be using again and again!  Cheaper than store-ready mix!

It's taken me 4 years of being married to find a good pancake recipe that I don't have to cut in half (and somehow ruin). It makes just enough for my husband and I. I use butter instead of shortening (same amount) and my husband loves these!

I am 37 weeks pregnant, and had a sudden craving for pancakes. I have never had any clue how to make them from scratch, and we were out of Bisquick. I saw all the great reviews, and gave this a shot. I did switch out buttermilk for the milk and added a bit extra. THESE WERE FABULOUS!! I will NEVER make pancakes with a mix again! They were so easy, so tasty, and I was sitting and eating within ten minutes. Thank you!!

I wanted to rate this recipe 3.5 stars. It cooked and browned perfectly into a dense pancake, but it tasted rather ordinary. I guess after all the raving reviews, I was expecting to be blown away. I would add some flavouring (vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg) next time. One more thing: I couldn't understand how the orignial recipe (1 cup of flour) can feed 4. My husband and I aren't big eaters, and it barely fed 2 of us!

This is a great pancake recipe. I substituted melted butter for the shortening and that gave it a fantastic flavour. I also sifted in the dry ingredients to avoid lumps

I'm sorry to rate this a only three stars, but I didn't care for these.  They are too heavy for my taste.  My favorite pancake recipe is: 1 Cup  self-rising flour, 1 Cup milk, 1 T. sugar.  Ligh and Fluffy.  You can play with and adjust flour/milk for thicker/thinner pancakes.

My wife wanted pancakes tonight and I found this recipe to be extra nice.  I added some chopped walnuts and found that I needed a full cup of milk.  The pancakes turned out light, fluffy and delicious. And the great part is it was easy as pie!

Sis & I love this recipe! It's so easy to make, and it tastes wonderful! I've made this over and over again. Failproof recipe. 

PS: I had my butter turned clumpy once when  I added it to the milk mixture, but still went ahead with the whole recipe anyway, and my pancakes taste pretty good too!

I used brown sugar, whole wheat pastry flour, and added about 1t. vanilla.  They were amazingly light and fluffy - I can't imagine how light they would have been with white flour!  The batter seemed too thick, but I used it anyway and it turned out great!

I doubled this recipe for myself and my three young children and they devoured them.  I am not a fan of pancakes but since Dad is out of town I caved to their demands and was pleasantly surprised.  I've tried many recipes over the years and  tried the mixes and never liked them much.  If done right these are indeed very light and fluffy and are now the standard in our home.  For even more lightness I may try club soda next time in place of milk......

This was sooooo good.  I usually like yeast pancakes, and we didn't have time, so I quickly ran online and saw this recipe and thought we'd give it a shot.  I might like these more than I like the yeast pancakes!  Delicious.  The only thing I changed was to use melted butter instead of shortening.  Delicious!  Will be a breakfast favorite!

Fast, easy and very tasty.
I added a bit of mapke syrup as part of the liquid, and melted butter instead of shortening. I think this is a very good basic recipe that  could be varied in many ways.
So much better than mixes.

I had not had pancakes in a long, long time, so I went searching for a recipe and decided on this one.  They were wonderful!  One bite and my dad made a loud, "Mmmmmm!"  I added a few chocolate chips to my daughter's and she loves them, too.  Really enjoyed these pancakes and will definitely make them again.  Thanks so much, Eugene.

Followed the recipe exactly as given - except added a small splash of vanilla.  I liked how these cooked up with a just a touch of crust on the outside and perfect fluff on the inside. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

These were delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except added a tad of vanilla.  I used canola oil for the shortening.  Wonderfully light and fluffy.  Quick easy!  I might play around with some different types of whole grain flours next time I make these.  It is the best recipe I've ever had for pancakes.

These were great pancakes.  I followed the recipie exactly except added a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg, and doubled the sugar.  The batter seemed a bit thick, and the shortening and milk mixed together made the shortening sort of coagulate.  HOWEVER - I wanted to try as written so I tried them 'as is.'  They were great!  Light and fluffy, not too heavy and browned nicely.  So, don't second guess and give it a try.  Will make this a regular in our house.

For a basic traditional pancake recipe I give it 5 stars.  Consistency was just how I like it, not too thin or cakey.  I did use hard marg out of convenience and added a little vanilla just cause I like it. The wet to dry ratio in this recipe was perfect and so easy to do.  Will make again and again.

Great pancakes. This made 8 beautiful pancakes. I had to add a spoonful of water as they were just too thick to pour onto the griddle. Nice flavor, not too eggy, not too floury. I used 2% milk, and they turned out nicely. I'll use this again. Thanks Eugene, these were so easy and turned out great!

I will never make the box kind again! My husband rarely wants pancakes, but since making this recipe, he has requested them several times. Maybe its all the butter, but these are melt in your mouth good.  A new staple in our home and I pretty much have the recipe memorized by now its so easy.

added 1 an extra Tbsp of sugar, added 1/2 tsp vanilla, and decreased the salt to only 1/4 tsp.  Tasted a lot better!  These puffed up nice, but I had trouble with the melted shortening clumping up when the cooler ingredients were mixed together (they weren't even that cool).  Otherwise, these turned out nice.

Fantastick flapjacks!  I followed some suggestions and reduced the amount of milk a little and added vanilla.  I really was amazed at how nicely they turned out.  The recipe ingredients listed are enough to make pancakes for 2 adults (possibly with leftovers).  I made the mistake of doubting the amount that would come out and doubled the recipe....needless to say we had LOTS extra!  I probably won't add the nutmeg next time though, as suggested from other reveiws.

OMG!!  This was so good!  I did 8x the recipe (because we have 10 ppl in our fam and the kids always have friends sleep over on Fridays) and used sour milk instead of regular milk and melted 1 cup of real butter instead of the shortening (I'm just not a shortening fan).  When I mixed the wet stuff, I added the beaten eggs into the somewhat cooled butter, then mixed that into the sour milk, then poured into the dry ingredients.  I used an electric mixer and added ~1 TBSP of vanilla at the end.  Per other reviews, I spread this out on the griddle and cooked over medium/low.  These disappeared faster than I could cook them.  They are so light and fluffy... I hate to admit, but I ate 8!  This will be our staple pancake recipe from now on!  Thanks SO MUCH!!

A good basic recipe that will allow for lots of experimentation. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that I found I had to follow some of the other recommendations to improve these pancakes (i.e. more milk, vanilla, etc).

i love these pancakes!!  after making them a few times, each time a little differently, i found the perfect combination: first, i added 1/2 cup of buttermilk.  i seperated the eggs and whipped the whites until they formed soft peaks and added them in at the end.  i only used 3 tbs. shortening.  i then put the batter in a warm microwave for about 20 minutes to help the baking powder do its job (to "warm" the microwave, turn it on for 1 minute, and then put the batter in it).

The only change I made was to use 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil instead of the shortening.  Also used non-stick spray on the pan.  I also left out the salt.  They were, just as it says, very fluffy and very good and easy to make.  I have actually never made pancakes from scratch(!) but will now never buy pre-made boxed pancake mix.  Thanks for the recipe.

i replaced the shortening for melted butter and added a capful of vanilla extract. everyone in the house gave these a thumbs up! i will probably never get the box mix again! i love the fluffiness of the pancakes, and they taste better than the box mix kind.

Hi, made these this morning and they are the tops.  I doubled the recipe so I put 1/2 tsp. of vanilla and instead of two whole eggs, I used 4 egg whites.  I mixed everything together and beat the egg whites separately and then mixed it in.  Tastes wonderful.  We really enjoyed these.  A keeper for me.  Thanks for posting.  Airama

I made this for the third time and all I can say is YUMMMY!  This time I used a carnation fat free canned milk.  And it made these pancakes very thick (I'm talking about 1/4 inch!).  I made 2 batches.  ONe original and the second with 2 mashed bananas for my little boy.  He loved it yet again.  THANKS!

This was fast and easy (just what i like in the morning) i loved this recipe due to the fact  that i can use my sons rice milk instead of reg. milk he has milk allergies. i also used his "butter" and the other children could not tell the difference. i doubled the recipe so it was also a quick morning breakfast and also so my allergy son could take some to day care to have when the other kids have pancakes. i will be printing this recipe out to give to the day care provider thank you

Wonderful pancakes! I will never buy pancake mix again! Family loves these! The only thing I changed was, like some other reviewers suggested, I substituted oil for the shortening. Perfect pancakes every time!

We tried these and loved them. I added 2 tsp. vanilla to the mix. Next time I make them I will substitute applesauce for the shortning, and maybe some diced apples. I don't think we'll use the mix anymore!!

We used this recipe for Christmas breakfast and was so pleased with the results. The recipe is easy and just enough for the two of us. The only changes I made was to add 1/4 tsp. vanilla extract to the batter, and used vegetable oil for the melted shortening.

I was craving pancakes when I woke up this morning and was bummed when I didn't have any pancake mix.  I hopped online and found this, and who needs Bisquick with easy recipes like this?  Great pancakes!

Perfect pancakes: light and slightly crispy!  I changed the oil to veg. oil and added blueberries or chocolate chips to some and some plain.  Having a good griddle is key to good pancakes.

I followed this recipe exactly, measured perfectly, and heated my griddle acurately. For some reason, the pancakes did not cook all the way through! If I turned up the heat theu were burned and gooey. I think I will just stick with the store mix.

This is a great recipe if you want to whip up some pancakes real quick in the morning. I followed the recipe exactly and it was just enough for two of us (and some bacon + eggs on the side). This is probably the first time i made nice fluffy pancakes

The texture is good, but it really lacked flavor. Even after adding 1tsp vanilla there was a flour aftertaste. I would use butter, add more sugar, and increase vanilla next time.

These are the best pancakes I've ever made! The first few came out not so good but because I had the flame too high but once I put it on low they came out perfect! This one is a definitely a keeper!

These pancakes are EXCELLENT.  I have gotten many compliments when making these.  I use Canola oil in place of the melted shortening and I whip my egg white and fold in as the last step.  This seems to make the pancakes LIGHTER.  I have also substituted homemade applesauce for the oil just to reduce our fat intake.  They still turn out very good and moist.  After finding this recipe, it is the only one I use.  Thank You for sharing!!

This recipe was great, but I had to add another 1/4 cup of milk (1 cup altogether) to get these to cook! Otherwise they just sat on the griddle and made pancakes about 1/2 inch thick that never got done all the way.

These pancakes were some of the BEST pancakes I have ever tasted! If you have a large family I would suggest doubling or tripling this recipe. I had to make silver-dollar sized pancakes just to have enough for 3 hungry people. But these are truely AWESOME pancakes!!!!

I substituted the shortening for 1/4 applesauce and my picky 3 year old ate 2 1/2 pancakes. I had two for myself. Made just the right amount for the two of us!

Nothing phenomenal, but a great basic pancake recipe that  I will be sure to use time and time again. I made mine half whole wheat and half with white flour, to make them sliiiiiightly more healthy and they worked out great!

Yum!! This pancake recipe is delicious! However, I made a few changes! I substituted melted butter for the shortening. And I only added 2 jumbo eggs, so if you have large eggs, I suggest using 3. I dont have Vanilla, so next time I'll add a Tablespoon or so. Also, when making pancakes, make sure to oil or butter your pan a little bit. I only added about 2 teaspoons of baking powder. I also added about 2-3 T. extra. However, this is for 16 servings. I added some caramel syrup and apple sauce recipe... its delicious! Better than Aunt Jemima's mix!!! :) I made this Cinnamon Apple Syrup recipe: http://allrecipes.com//Recipe/cinnamon-apple-syrup/Detail.aspx . Trust me, you wont be sorry! These pancakes, taste like perfectly sweet, light, and fluffy clouds. You can use strawberry syrup, choco syrup, top with ice-cream, whip cream, your choice! Thank you so mcuh for this recipe! I saved it, I'll be making this more often!!! (=

These are amazing! I made them exactly the way the recipe gives.. and they are so YUMMY!!  Probably the best pancakes I had for a while! I think though, next time I will add a teaspoon of vanilla to the recipe. Maybe try different creations, my kido was asking for chocolate chip pancakes! Definetely, this is a good base to some yummy pancake creations!

For those with allergies:  I switched the sugar for honey, I switched the milk for almond milk, I switched the shortening with olive oil.    Still turned out great.  Thinking one could also do an egg sub and this would still be good.

Excellent as is! I added vanilla extract, blueberries and peach cobbler filling to the batter. It was more than an extra special brunch for my visiting in-laws. They haven't stopped raving about them yet!

These were fantastic!  The best pancakes I can remember having-- let alone made from scratch.  I followed the recipe exactly but was out of milk, so I substituted with 3/4 cup mixture of water and plain yogurt.  They cooked up perfectly and the taste was great!! I cooked them in grape seed oil and topped them off with honey, thanks for an excellent recipe!  Definitely won't be using pre-packaged mix again :).

I am a dad and this is the first time I try making pancakes without using the "all in the box". My daughters liked what I did but I am sure I missed something or did something wrong because the pancakes were not as fluffy as I thought they would be, but they were pretty good. Thanks!

Excellent and fast. Doubled recipe and added 1tsp of Vanilla and more milk (about 1/4cup) as it was too thick.  Topped with blueberries and whipped cream.  Yum.

I was sort of disappointed with this recipe.  I followed the recipe correctly, and the batter was more like dough and was not pourable.  I had to scoop it out with my hands, and the batter was pretty sticky.  The pancakes always turned out burned on both sides.  The recipe only makes 7 or 8 silver dollar sized pancakes, but they are very thick.  It would be 2 stars, but they were pretty good despite the burning.  But, overall, you will be more pleased choosing another recipe.

there was nothing fluffy about these pancakes.  i felt i should be adding corn to them instead of syrup.  this was not at all what i was expecting.  mine came out dense.  good for what they were, but NOT fluffy.

I use this recipe all the time now. A good stand-by. My batter often comes out too thick so I either start with less flour or just add more milk as needed. It's tricky though because I try not to over stir.

Just made these this morning, and doubled up the recipe, we have a family of 6, and the boys like their pancakes to be big :), they were soooo yummy! not sure why anyone on here is having any kinds of problems with them. The batter was thick, very thick, but they turned out, light and fluffy. If they are cooking on the outside before the inside? thats not the batter..thats your temperature, your pan is too hot! I put my pan at med/low and I take oil on a napkin and wipe around the inside of the pan. Not one of them bunred, an all were cooked through. Light, fluffy, sweet, very very good melt in your mouth.

I used butter instead of shortening and they turn out great my hubby wasnt sure if they were going to be as good as the box mix but once he gave the first bite he couldnt believe that this turn out to be the best pancakes he has ever had.This will be my favorite pancake recipe from now on. thanks for sharing.

Yummy and easy!  Way better than the store bought batter, I added blueberries and it sweetened them up.  Next time I will add vanilla to them and it will make them even more delicious!

WOW! These were great and I will be using this recipe from now on. They tatse just like the diner's pancakes. The only change I made was #1 I sifted the flour and #2 since I doubled the recipe I did 1/4 melted shortening and 1/4 applesauce. I didn't want 1/2 cup of fat in my pancakes. Next time I will try adding a bit more applesauce and less shortening/butter and see how that turns out. But over all these were great! My hubby who is the pancake maker in our house couldn't believe how great these were.

Not sure why some of the negative feedback.  I followed the basic recipe and then added some bananas and some chocolate chips and they turned out aweomse.  My picky 5 year old even liked them.  I also got 8 pancakes from this recipe.

I really like the "Good Old Fashion Pancakes" recipe from this site, but it makes too many pancakes. I wanted a similar recipe with out converting the measurements and this is it. I used 1 1/2 Tbsp un-salted butter instead of shortening and added 1 tsp vanilla. They were sooooo fluffy and yummy!   Thanks for submitting this recipe Eugene. It's the best!!

These are the BEST pancakes I have EVER ate in my life!  They come out super fluffy!  They do need an extra 1/4 cup of milk.  The batter is too thick otherwise.  These are my new go to pancakes.  No more boxed pancake for us!

My husband loves pancakes so I have tried many recipes. This recipe is very easy to prepare and makes the best pancakes. I'm not a huge fan of pancakes but even I love these.  As some others mentioned, I also use butter instead of shortening, about 2 tablespoons melted in the microwave. I use salted butter so I reduced the amount of salt by half. If I happen to have half&half or heavy cream, I use about 1/4 cup of that and reduce the milk accordingly. Needs just a tad more than 3/4 cup of the cream/milk mixture to make the batter the right consistency. You'll know. The added cream makes the pancakes even more awesome.

We loved these- they taste just like diner pancakes! I too, doubled the recipe and used butter in place of the shortning. They browned beautifully. I added blueberries to some and they were out of this world! This was just as easy as mix pancakes and so much better!

Loved it!  I can somehow always screw up pancakes.  But not this one.  I did exchange butter for the shortening and I added some almond extract.  I also added some strawberries to half the batch. Mmmm...

Wow, these were incredible. I really like how it doesn't call for a lot of sugar or vanilla. Pancakes should be minimally flavored so the syrup can do it's job.. sweetening!  These were really good. Thanks for the great recipe!

I had to add a little bit of extra milk to the batter because it was a little too thick. Other than that, these were great. My puppy enjoyed the burnt and undercooked pancakes so everything worked out!!

This was a good pancake recipe. The only problem I had was it needed an extra 1/4 cup of milk. Without it, the batter was very thick.

OK basic pancake recipe. I have made these pancakes several times now and they are always flat - not fluffy at all. I've downgraded my rating to only OK. Not sure what the problem is, really. Also, not very rich tasting, in my opinion (too sweet, not savory enough - for me, at least).

these are the best hotcakes i have ever made. just tweaked the recipe a little. used melted margarine instead of shortening and whipped up the egg white and folded in. also 1/2 tsp of vanilla essence.  doesn't make many. depends on how big you make them but very important to cook over a low heat so it cooks through.

A very, very good pancake recipe, but it's not the BEST I've ever had so it gets a "4".  Sifted flour and whisked all ingredients, cooked slowly and the result was great!

As is this recipe is 4 stars. But if you want a 10 star absolutely the best pancake - do what I did: halve the salt, add 1/4 tsp. vanilla and OMIT the egg! That's right - NO egg! I did this by mistake and the pancakes were the fluffiest, dreamiest, died and went to heaven kind of pancake! I had to make another batch (because the recipe really only yields 3-4 pancakes) and this time I added egg and they were thinner, and chewier in texture. Still ok, but man - if you want melt in your mouth FLUFFY pancakes - forget the egg! :)

These were a huge hit. I used whole wheat flour and added chocolate chips and strawberries to the batter. Very moist and sweet; no need for syrup.

Not the best pancakes I've ever had. I replaced the shortening with margerine like others had suggested and thought they were a bit too buttery. Probably won't make again.

The name of these pancakes fit them well. I used butter instead of shortening and skim milk and they still turned out perfectly. Yummy buttery taste! Be sure to cook slowly on medium  to low-med heat, b/c the pancake batter is thick and you want them to cook thoroughly through the middle.

I made these for the daycare kids, doubled the recipe, used oil instead of melted shortening, and powdered milk instead of whole milk.  The kids raved about them, they are great, even with the substitutions.

Very good! My only issue is the fact that the mixture is sssooo thick that it`s really hard to spread. I had to use a spoon to spread it, but worked out good in the end anyways :)

This is a great basic recipe!  Yummy and fluffy!  I use melted, cooled butter instead of shortening. My favourite flavour is bananas and cinnamon!  The only complaint is it really doesn't make the quantity it claims.

Best home recipe I've found to date.  Not quite as 'fluffy' as restaurant cakes, but very very good.  Try this one out.

We were not crazy about this recipe as it stands.  I made it exactly as stated using butter flavored Crisco for shortening.  We thought they resembled pancakes out of a boxed mix and didn't have the flavor and texture or homemade pancakes.

Followed recipe exactly and they were not fluffy and didn't taste good. I will try to make them again and edit my review if next time they come out good, but for now they are not!

This recipe is just excellent, producing truly fluffy pancakes. It even forgave me for forgetting to melt the shortening first. To make up for my error, I just used a handmixer to blend the ingredients well.

These are SO GOOD! For the last few months, since I got a griddle, I've been searching for the perfect pancake recipe for our family. I tried this today making a few modifications (3/4 cup whole wheat flour, 1/4 cup white; butter instead of shortening; extra 1/4 cup water) and my family LOVED it. It's a keeper.

I wouldn't say this recipe was fluffy.  They were very moist from the shortening, but dense.

I love this recipe.  I use oil instead of shortening.  And I find that the pancakes are even lighter and fluffier if I don't press on the pancake after turning.  I would recommend this.

These pancakes were delicious...perfectly light and fluffy.  I only had skim plus in the house so I used a half of a cup of that along with a 1/4 cup of heavy cream.  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These were the thickest fluffiest pancakes I've ever had!  I will add vanilla next time though, or add more sugar. No more bisquick pancakes for my family! No sir!

Very good pancakes!  I thought the batter was way too thick but I made one anyway and it was 1/2" thick, but light, fluffy, crispy and delicious.  I thinned the batter anyway to make it easier to work with.  I see no need to look for other pancake recipes.

Very yummy! My husband loved these b/c he said they didn't have a flour taste to them. I used butter instead of the shortening and you'll need to double the recipe b/c it really only makes 4 decent sized pancakes.

I had a guest over and ran out of my normal pancake mix. I had all the ingredients for this recipe and it turned out excellent!  I never knew it was so easy to make homemade pancakes.  I added chocolate chips - yummy!  Next time I'll try it with wheat flour.  Thanks for the recipe!

I just made these tonight.  They are very good and quite fluffy.
However, I followed the directions (except for the shortening, came out fine) and I have to say, they amounted to about 2 medium-sized pancakes (no big deal though, that's how much I eat anyways).
But, I did notice that they tasted pretty egg'y - more so than they should have in my opinion. 
Next time I'll mess around with the quantities of ingredients a little more.  :)  

edit: I realized I may have put ingredients in the wrong order... I'll try this again sometime and see if there's a difference

I have always made pancakes with this recipe and I will never go back to box again. My husband actually says that if we divorce then I have to give him this recipe. I do reccomand a half of teaspoon of vanilla to give it a bit of flavor.

Love it!  Definitely fluffy!  I usually make a double recipe and freeze the leftovers - just pop them in the toaster for an instant brekkie on weekday.  WAY better than a frozen pancake and much more economical.  Thanks Eugene!

Make this almost everyday for breakfast. Very easy and quick to prepare. I never use milk, just water instead. I also added 2 tsp sugar to batter, sprinkles a little chopped raisins and walnuts while cooking, and eat the pancake as is, no syrup or additional butter. Using teflon pan is great because no oil is needed. And they are still fluffy pancakes. Yum!

I love buttermilk pancakes, but don't often have buttermilk in my refrigerator.  So glad to find a quick and easy and good recipe using sweet milk.  I did add some vanilla like many other reviewers and used melted butter for the shortening.  This recipe as written made about five 1/4 cup pancakes.

These are the best pancakes.  The mix is thick and it is best that way.  They come out really fluffy as the recipes says.  I added some vanilla and an extra tBS. of sugar.  Next time I will try them with some blueberries.

These really are the perfect pancake! They are fluffy and easy to make.  They also are a great base recipe.  They are slightly sweet, which I absolutely love.  This is my go to pancake recipe now!

The recipe says 3/4 cup milk, but I had to put in about 1.5 cups milk to get the batter thin enough to make it manageable. With that said, it was a delicious recipe, and very simple, which is good when it comes to pancakes, in my book.

These are wonderful pancakes. They are light and fluffy and so easy to make. We added a cup of fresh blueberries and they were the best ever! I'm not a huge fan of pancakes but these are really awesome!

Really good pancakes! They had nice flavor and didn't taste like flour. (How most of my homemade ones turn out) I followed recipe exactly. Only thing I did differently was to let the batter rest for about 1/2 hour before scooping it out onto the griddle. Soft, Fluffy, and delish!

These are the BEST pancakes ever!!  They are true to the name and are fluffy. I have never been a pancake fan because they often tend to be doughy.  We have this recipe stashed in a couple different places around the house so we can always find it.

Yummy. The perfect texture. I used butter instead of the oil and added some vanilla. We ate ours with butter on top.

I liked finding this fluffy pancake recipe, especially since it doesn't call for buttermilk - which I almost never have around the house.  using butter definitely makes them tastier.  I also use 1/3 white, 1/3 whole wheat, 1/3 corn meal for a really yummy multigrain pancake.  thanks!

I have a trusty pancake recipe that I've used for the past few years, and we thought they were the best ever. I must say, this recipe outdoes my trusty old one! These were light and fluffy...perfection! I doubled the recipe and added pure vanilla & milk chocolate chips. I topped with buttermilk syrup from this site. Pure delight! I'll definitely be making again. Thanks for sharing!

My new favorite pancakes!!! I did make two changes: I used my healthy butter, Earth Balance, instead of shortening, and I had to substitute 1/2 and 1/2 for the milk because I was out. YUM YUM YUM, and the family loved them!!!

We LOVE these pancakes!!!  We always double the recipe (I am feeding 4 kids here!)  I always use butter for these, not shortening.  I am about to make a batch of them right now, and I am going to try using buttermilk since I saw that some other reviewers did this.  I can't wait to try them!

Excellent! I changed the Crisco for butter and I also added about 1 to 2 tbsp of vanilla. We love the extra sweetness. I do recomend for a family of 4 to double the recipie though.

These are the best pancakes I have tried from this site so far. The measurements in my opinion were perfect for a good textured batter. The pancakes spread easily and were the perfect thickness. Taste was good too, only addition I made to the batter was adding in a splash of vanilla to the shortening (I used evoo based margarine)/egg/milk mixture before adding to the flour. I ate mine with a yogurt honey sauce (1/2 cup of yogurt + 3 tablespoons of honey + 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract and blend that in a food processor till everything is mixed together, sprinkled some cinnamon on the sauce before pouring it on the pancakes). I topped the pancakes off with strawberries and bananas, will definitley make this again.

Amazing!! I followed the recipe, and a suggestion about not adding hot shortening to cold milk- I warmed the milk a bit... but I forgot to set the eggs out to warm a bit before making. So I had a piece of cooked egg. Not the worst thing that ever happened! Anyway, pancakes were fluffy, light, and delicious! They went together and cooked so fast and easy!! Woo hoo!!!

This is my "go to" pancake recipe.  As other's have suggested, I doubled the recipe...but only added 1 egg and 1/2 tsp salt.  I make pancakes often for my daycare kids and this is what I do to have them on hand every time:  I mix the dry ingredients together in a covered Tupperware container and shake to mix ingredients.  I put that in the cupboard to have on hand until I need it.  Sometimes I will I add 1/3 cup veg. oil instead of the melted shortening, but if I want a little flavor and have the time, I will substitute melted butter or margarine instead.  After I have used the pancake mix, I mix up another batch so I'm ready for next time.

These are the best pancakes I've ever eaten.  I shook a fairly liberal amount of cinnamon into the batter, and it was fantastic.  I might try folding some chopped apples in next time.

as a basic simple recipe it is great. i love all the suggestions for add ins and substitutions. that makes a great recipe...adaptablity.  some times ppl forget that cooking and baking require the head of a scientist(like not putting cold milk or eggs into melted shortening    thus causing lumps of shortening) and the soul of an artist.

I always relied on my box of Aunt Jemima whenever i wanted pancakes. These were my 1st attempt at pancakes from scratch and i was NOT disappointed! These were really good. Do not thin out the batter, unless you like thin rubbery pancakes. Thats the secret: A thicker batter results in "fluffy" pancakes. I too took the advice of others and used melted butter instead of shortening.

The only substitution I made was I used margarine instead of shortening. We also doubled the recipe for my family of 5, after reading reviews about recipe size.  I used a large ladle to measure out the batter.  We had leftovers after my husband and three little girls ate them (and Daddy had 5 and daughter had 6!).  These were tasty pancakes, but I wouldn't describe them as FLUFFY.  Still looking for "the" pancake recipe.

These pancakes are perfect!  So fluffy and yummy.  I add some wheat germ and I think it just makes them even tastier.

These were average at best. I followed the directions exactly but they were really really bland and flavourless and a bit crumbly. I wouldn't make them again. I grew up on buttermilk pancakes, maybe that's the difference.

These are very good and easy to make. I make them up a couple times a week for my little boys and they gobble them right up. They soak up the syrup and taste yummy!

My girls didn't care for these, my 9 year old said they were tasteless, hubby ate them and didn't complain. I did add some vanilla extract, the texture was nice, and they rose nicely on the griddle. Probably won't make again. Thanks anyway.

The title of this recipe isn't lying! I found this recipe in my Taste of Home cookbook and, without reading reviews online, decided to try it out. I ended up with 8 small-medium sized pancakes- but that's okay b/c it was only me and my husband and the pancakes come out quite thick. As usual, I doused mine in butter and syrup, while the hubby ate them plain. I received no complaints!

These were great; everything you want in a recipe - easy, fast, cheap and delicious.  I added honey and cinnamon to the batter and also threw in some blueberries.  A family pleaser!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Yum. Does not serve 4 though! I doubled the recipe and it fed 3 of us with 2 pancakes left over. I am still looking for something a little less dense but these are good anyway. Definitely better than the box mix. I added chocolate chips to the last bit of batter and made a few that way. We at them for breakfast yesterday and now my toddler is eating a beanut butter and chocolate chip pancake sandwich for a "special" lunch.

Bye-bye Bisquick. I've (finally) found my pancake recipe! I followed the recipe exactly and really enjoyed the flavor and texture of these pancakes. Just to try it out, I might replace the milk with buttermilk next time. But they're also perfect as is.

I tried this to see if I could improve on the "from scratch" recipe that I normally use, and this honestly wasn't that great.  The shortening formed small lumps and grossed me out when biting into the pancakes.

The pancakes turned out absolutely great! Really fluffy, however I replaced the milk with buttermilk to give the pancakes more flavour and I found that I needed about 2 1/4 cups of the buttermilk because without it, the batter was just a bit too thick. Also, I personally prefer my pancakes a bit sweet so next time, I would use an extra tablespoon of sugar because one teaspoon of sugar from the original recipe did not give much taste to the pancakes. But everything else, I would keep it the same and I will be keeping this recipe with me from now!

I made these twice.  The second time, I added 1/2 tsp vanilla, halved the salt and doubled the sugar, and got much better results.

Wonderful!  I liked these better than the "Good Old Fashioned Pancakes" recipe on this site.  I added 1/4- 1/2 tsp baking soda, a capful of Almond extract, and oil instead of shortening (couldn't bring myself to use a hydrogenated fat).  They taste awsome!  The texture is so light and fluffy.  Only problem is they didn't brown up.  This will be my new pancake recipe from now on!

These turned out great.  I didn't have any shortening so I just used vegetable oil instead and it worked.  Nice flavor and texture.  The only hard part is getting the griddle temp right, so they are nice and golden on the outside and cooked all they way through since they are a bit thicker.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Dec-2007: Yum! I ran out of Bisquick and have NEVER made pancakes from scratch in my life. They were delicious - I only wish I had doubled the recipe to make more! Like others, I used melted butter instead of shortening, and I also decreased the baking powder to 1.5 teaspoons. I also increased the milk to 1 cup to make them a little less dense. Thanks for a great recipe - I guess I don't need to buy more Bisquick! I'm going to premix the dry ingredients so I can make these whenever I want!
UPDATE Jan. 2010: I am still making these 2 years later! The only change I'm making is doubling the recipe. I don't even add the additional milk anymore, I follow the recipe exactly.

I love making pancakes from scratch, but, this recipe is just so darn good, it's incredible. I did follow the tips given by bestcooker.  The buttermilk gave it a wonderful "tang" in contrast with the syrup. You have to try these-with the buttermilk. I also reduced the fat like bestcooker said. We will only make these in the future. Thanks both of you for a great pancake recipe.

Oh my goodness! These pancakes are so easy and so good. I did use butter instead of shortening. The results were wonderful! I will be cooking these up again and again. This recipe is so easy. I let my kids do the mix and they were so proud of their fluffy, yummy pancakes! I would give these pancakes 10 stars, but it will only let me give 5 stars. Two thumbs up!!!!

I don't usually review recipes but this one deserves it.  I used 2% milk because that was all that i had and "i can't believe its not butter" sweet cream buttermilk butter instead of the shortening and they were wonderful.  This recipe has the perfect title because they were truly fluffy pancakes.

I had lost the tried and true pancake recipe that I've used for two decades and every new recipe I tried tasted like baking powder, or was heavy and bland. Not this one! This recipe was wonderful, and easy for the kids to make when I'm not home. Thanks for sharing.

I have never made homemade pancakes assuming that it was alot of work. Boy was I wrong this recipe was very simple and tasted fantastic. The pancakes were very light and fluffy. My 16 year old and 3 year old nephew enjoyed them very much. I doubled the recipe, cooked and froze some for early morning breakfasts during the school week. Instead of using oil I used margarine. for a little food fun for the kids I also took half of the mixture after it was made and added three teaspoons of peanut butter to the batter, melted some strawberry preserves to pour over top instead of syrup after they were cooked and the boys really had feast. Thanks soooooooo much for this recipe.  Because of you I am now saying bye-bye to boxed pancake mixes.

This recipe makes very fluffy pancakes that are also very tasty! Sometimes I will add vanilla extract for a little extract flavor, but this is really not necessary. Thanks for the recipe.

3.5 stars.  Added cinnamon for some flavor.  Had to dump first batch of liquids because the melted shortening reacted with the milk and eggs and I ended up with lots of waxen-like little clumps in milk.  I must have had the shortening too warm and the milk cool.  Remade it with 2t oil instead and worked better.  Still nothing to write home about, prefer the boxed mixes.

Tasty.  I added vanilla this time.  I will play around with adding extras but it is a great base.  I agree with another review that it is much better than premixed recipes.

Best recipe for pancakes I've found. I did add more milk because it was too thick for me and a little bit of maple extract.

These are AWESOME! 
I too ran into the no Bisquick crisis on a Sunday morning as hubby came home asking for pancakes. 

I made this recipe, also substituting melted butter for shortening. 

Made 2 other changes. Added some vanilla extract and some Nestle Quick Powder (chocolate and Vanilla) to add a hint of sweetness to it. 
Family LOVED it! 

Even got the 17 month old twins to stay still and eat them. 

This is going to be passed down in our family for SURE!

I was out of the usual pancake mix, so i tried this out for my sons breakfast.  It was easy and delicious. I did use margarine instead of shortening, because we were out of shortening, but it turned out wonderful, My sons breakfast of champions.

These really are very fluffy, and very tasty.  Got rave reviews from DH and kids.  I've tried this recipe twice.  The second time I added half whole-wheat flour and the texture was still excellent, and I didn't feel quite as much like I was eating a dessert.  Thanks!

This was my first time making pancakes from scratch and I was very pleased with the results. Though I did add an extra egg and a splash of vanilla, I still give this 5 stars because I'm sure it was a good recipe before I changed it.

My British husband LOVES these pancakes. He first had pancakes in the states made with Bisquik. We moved back to England and I can't find anything even close to Bisquik. So I went searching for an easy "homemade Bisquik" recipe. Made a few changes to make this a little more healthy and even easier. Changed to 3/4 cup white flour and 1/4 cup wholemeal flour. I mixed all the dry ingredients together 4-5 times and store in a air-tight container. When hubby wants pancakes, I just scoop out 1 1/4 cups of the dry mix and add the rest of the ingredients. I add a little vanilla and a drop of maple syrup. Stir in a handful of blueberries, raspberries, etc. They come out perfect every time!

These pancakes were wonderful.  They live up to their name very fluffy and very yummy. In place of shortening(gross) I used melted unsalted butter and made a blueberry topping.  will be adding this recipe to my collection!!

I really loved these but they were not fluffy they were like a thick crepe which I thought was wonderful. I used self rising flour in place of the flour salt and paking powder and used melter butter in place of the shortening...Perfect I will use this recipe every time I make pancakes

Fluffed up nicely, taste left a little to be desired - bit of a baking powder twinge to it. Using butter in place of a straight shortening might richen the flavor some. I would use this recipe again with a tweak or two.

Great and Easy Recipe.  I used real butter because I didn't have any shortning.  I also added a tsp of vanilla. Wonderful flavor...Will make this instead of box mix from now on.  Most of the ingredients are staples in my kitchen.

I normally make buttermilk pancakes but tried this recipe because I didn't have any buttermilk on hand. I used butter flavored Crisco since I didn't have regular. I also added 1/2 tsp vanilla. To me, these tasted like a box mix - not light and fluffy but heavy. I may try again without adjusting the recipe, but these were not good.

Easy, wonderful recipe.  I think that folding in the egg whites really made the pancakes quite fluffy.  I would definitely make again.

I decided to make breakfast for dinner tonight and I used this recipe.  These were the BEST pancakes I have ever had.  My son never eats all of his pancakes but he asked for seconds tonight.  My whole family loved them.  The only thing that I did different was add about a half cap of vanilla.  Thanks for the great recipe.

These were incredible!  Light, fluffy, and has a melt-in-your-mouth smoothness! I did do substitute most of the ingredients (using whole wheat flour, Splenda, olive oil), and added a splash of vanilla, as well as add more milk to get a "batter" consistency.  Even with changes, these were wonderful. No more packaged mix for me!

Everything seemed to be right except the shortening. WAY too much shortening, I put 1/2 cup, and that seemed to be too much. Had to add more flour...
Sorry, this one's not for me.

These are wonderful and super easy. I had to add about 1/4 cup more milk than the recipe called for. I made about five medium size pancakes from the recipe. They were very light and fluffy and delicious. I added fresh berries and it was very good that way, the underlying pancake was good to.

This recipe was sooo easy. I've always been one to buy the ready-made pancake mix at the grocery store. However, after trying this recipe, NEVER AGAIN!!! My boyfriend just looooved these too. They were so light!!!

I found this recipe because I was out of Bisquick and wanted pancakes.  The only thing I did differently was add about 1/4 cup more milk, since it was a little thick.  The pancakes turned out dull and floury/baking powdery.  Not a good batch, and DEFINITELY not fluffy.  Guess I shouldn't have added the extra milk.....

The texture of the pancakes turned out really well, fluffy & spongy on the inside & crisp on the outside.

Great pancakes! My family loved these. If your baking powder is fresh, they get very fluffy. I have made these several times, and they are good with or without vanilla.

This recipe was AWESOME!!  They were the fluffiest pancakes I have ever made and the best i've made from scratch.  We use 1 cup of milk then also half whole wheat half unbleached all purpose flour.  Our toddler twins gobble these up!  They also freeze VERY well!

Great pancake recipe! My family loved them, my 8 year old daughter ate SEVEN of them! I did add a bit more milk to it because the batter was thicker than I wanted it, but it was still thick enough to have nice thick, fluffy pancakes. I added a little more sugar as well.

This recipe was terrific.  I substituted canola oil in for the shortening and they came out wonderful.  I even use a container now to store the pre-mixed dry ingredients so I can use it like a box mix, only so much better

So easy to make and they taste great!!!  This is the only time I have ever made homemade pancakes and I doubt I will ever use a box mix again!  I also add chocolate chips for a sweeter taste.

I found this recipe to be very bland.  I even added vanilla extract to give it more flavor.  Also, the recipe says it makes 4 servings.  By 4 servings, I did not realize it only made 4 pancakes.

These were good...and they definitely turned out to be fluffy.  I used a strawberry sauce as a topper but would suggest adding cinnamon to the batter if just eating plain.  Thanks for the recipe.

Loved these - very easy to make and got rave reviews. I doubled the recipe, and it made about 12 4-5 inch pancakes (enough for 4 people to be more than full). I added a bit more milk than called for, a tsp. of vanilla to the wet ingredients, and a dash of cinnamon to the dry. They were great, and will definitely be made again!

These were good.  I thought the texture was a bit course or grainy, and I wasn't sure I liked the butter being in the batter- I think I'd try them again but use a little bit of plain canola oil in place of the butter.  Otherwise, they were nice and fluffy and very easy.  Not quite a stand-in for my usual from-scratch recipe, though.

Great pancakes! I will say that had I not done some things to the cooking pancakes while cooking, such as flattening them out slightly, they might not have turned out, but I am so glad I did what I did, because these pancakes are pretty good! I will have to make them again soon!

I guess it was my cooking because I seem to have followed the recipe to a T but they came out awful!!  I read many reviews and was sure this would turn out great as these recipes usually do.  The first pancake I tried was horrible!!  Tasted like cardboard so I added more milk and some water.  Still the taste was gross, my boyfriend told me to buy the box kind.  Dont know what I did wrong!!

I made this using 1/2 whole wheat flour, 1/2 all-purpose, which I think was a heinous mistake. They may have been a bit healthier, but they certainly did not taste delicious. Stick to the recipe, and they'll be just right.

My mom used to make pancakes from scratch for us every Sunday. I just got married and thought it might be fun to start this tradition with my husband. He however likes the pancakes from a box, so I got up early today to surprise him with real pancakes and decided to give this recipe a try. I thought they were great, very fluffy and my husband was very happy with them. I did however have to add about half a cup of milk and 1 teaspoon of vanilla or I would have given it five stars. I also added blueberry's to half of the mix they were delicious. Thanx for the great recipe, mom would be proud.

These were great!  I cook almost completely from scratch and have been looking for a very fluffy pancake mix.  These were great!  I did have to cut the salt in half because my husband has high blood pressure.

I have to admit, I usually don't like pancakes, but I live with two guys that do.  This recipe makes THE BEST pancakes I've had.  I put a touch mor emilk in, used margerine instead of shortning, and put 1 tsp of vanilla in it, and they came out delicious.  Thank you!

This is the second time I made it. I used melted butter instead of shortening, added a teaspoon of vanilla and a bit more milk. I managed to make 4 pancakes from the batter which is just good for 2 adults. I added some frozen fruit heated in a bubbly sugar syrup. A keeper especially I don't like instant mixing.

We've made this recipe, substituting the shortening with real butter, and use it at least once a weekend.  This recipe makes restaurant quality pancakes that are a REAL winner in our house!!  I sometimes add crushed walnuts and/or blueberries or chocolate chips.  YUM!

Decent pancakes. We were definitely full, especially since I used whole wheat flour. I'll probably keep looking for the "ultimate" pancake though.

Great recipe, perfect as a base. I added about 2 TBSP more of milk because it was a little too thick. I added chocolate chips to the kids pancakes and they licked the plates clean! I can't wait to add some vanilla and cinnamon next time. A keeper, this replaces my recipe from an old Better Home and Gardens cookbook!

The opinion among the seven us varied from 1 to 5. The hubby did not like the texture, preferring a more elastic pancake that withstands syrup saturation without crumbling. I, however, found the texture to be fine, but only drizzle syrup. The taste is good, perhaps a 4. The children all loved it.

Yummy! The recipe was quite similar to one I had used from the BH&G cookbook... only double the baking powder. They really were super fluffy! Don't use shortening, so we used 2 T of oil. Used Pam in the pan. Came out great. Fed 1 adult, 1 preschooler, and a toddler. Everybody wanted more.

I followed the recipe exactly and I added about 3 tbsp of eggo syrup into the batter. My pancakes were light and  crispy. They were not dry. When you add the melted shortening with cold milk, you will see little lumps, that's fine. After you cook the pancake those lumps will go away. This recipe is the one I am sticking with from this site. My 2 yr old actually asked for more. EXCELLENT!!

My kids and I loved this recipe.  We added a tad more milk at another reviewer's suggestion as well as a touch of cinnamon extract.  My husband didn't really care for these, but he doesn't like fluffy pancakes so we don't even try to keep him happy ;-)

Wow, these pancakes and fluffy and taste great even though I made them wheat-free, gluten-free, & dairy-free!! Instead of using 1cup flour, I substituted 3/4 cup of white rice flour, 1/4 cup of potato starch, 1/4 tsp of guar gum, and 1/4 tsp. vanilla extract. I used plain rice milk instead of milk. I used 2 tbsp. vegetable oil instead of shortening as per other people's reviews. I hope these alterations to the recipe help others who have a similar restricive diet. Thanks for the recipe :)

My mom taught me this recipe when I was eight years young - a true family favorite if there ever was one!  I do use 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in place of the melted shortening, as well as add a little extra milk should the batter get a little thick before I pour it on the griddle.  Not to worry, that shouldn't undermine the fluffiness (unless you add TOO much milk of course).  Above all, a superb concoction that remains in my repertoire after 28 years - Thanks, Eugene.

These turned out pretty good. They are fluffy. I had to add a bit more milk to thin the batter. I would make them again if I didn't have a box mix.

Oh, I forgot to add. I replaced the shortening with Crisco (sunflower oil), and they were still good. However, I find that my pancakes never turn out well when I fry them with butter. Replacing the shortening with butter is okay, but somehow greasing the pan with butter is never a good idea for me.

In pursuit of a thicker pancake than we seem to get from our household recipe book, we tried this out. My fiance ogled the batter apprenhensively, noting it looked more like muffin mix than pancake batter. These did not spread well but cooked through nicely. And they were fluffy as promised, but the taste, even with the added vanilla, was blah. Our search continues.

Very good recipe.  My kids eat them up!!

If you use shorting, make sure it cools before adding it to your egg mixture or you will have scrambled eggs as I did!
Good Luck and Thanks for the recipe!

Great pancakes! I added some vanilla, oat flakes, and cinammon like previous recommendations and substituted butter for the shortening. I also made a few with walnuts and chocolate chips. These were all delicious!

When we realized we were out of pancake mix, I looked here for a saving grace and found this one. GREAT simple pancakes, nothing fancy, and my 9yo LOVED them.

These are definitely fluffy.  I doubled the recipe and added more milk, as the batter was too thick for the pancakes to spread properly.  I also added a splash of vanilla.  I just sent the recipe to my sister, who loves pancakes.  I'm sure she'll enjoy these.

Out of this world...these are super easy to make...don't waste your money on the pancake mix...I used melted unsalted butter as the shortening...one thing I added was one cap full (water bottle size) on vanilla extract...I't is definately worth the try!

Very good. I added a touch of vanilla, and used butter instead of shortening. This recipe makes thick pancakes.

Like many others I ran out of pancake mix.  I promised my daycare kids pancakes so I used this recipe, substituting half the flour with whole wheat and using canola oil as was suggested.  They weren't as fluffy as they might have been, but the kids just gobbled them right up.  Next time to make them even healtheir I may substitue half the oil with applesauce.

I used vegetable oil like some other reviews suggested.  These are awesome pancakes.  I will never buy Aunt Jemima pancake mix again.  Thank you for this recipe!  Breakfast for dinner is always a favorite here and I look forward to making these everytime.

Very good, everyone loved it.  I used Golden Crisco in place of shortening and a splash of vanilla.  Also noted to expect a very thick batter.  I didnt think it would turn out but they were great, very fluffy.  Would make again.

This recipe is just as good, if not better than boxed pancake mixes.  I followed the user comments and subsituted margarine (for the shortening).  This recipe produces very fluffy, great pancakes.  My only issue with them is that it only makes four decent-sized pancakes. Have made these twice since find the recipe 3 days ago.  I don't know if I'll ever go back to the box.

Made these this morning.  Hubby got to go into work a little later and my son got up early, so I decided to treat us all to a "real" breakfast this morning.  These were delicious and I didn't change a thing.  Thanks for the post.

Yum! My husband and children loved this recipe. I doubled the recipe and decreased the sugar a little bit. It was very easy and delicious.
