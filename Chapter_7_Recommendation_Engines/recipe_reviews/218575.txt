I am the recipe submitter and would like to point out that the original way it was written called for grated Oaxacan cheese. If it's unavailable in your part of the country, Monterey Jack is a reasonable substitute. I hope you enjoy it.

I’m unsure why this recipe is getting such good reviews. I used to live in Mexico and this recipe isn’t really authentic at all plus it is very bland.  

After making it once exactly as written, I made it a 2nd time with the following changes:
- Substitute jalapeno pepper for Serrano, and use 3-4 serrano peppers.
-Boil raw, bone in chicken breasts with just enough water to cover chicken, a tsp of chicken bouillon per cup of water, few garlic cloves minced, ½ onion
-Once chicken is no longer pink, take out of broth and set aside.  Meanwhile - 
- Sautee tomatillos, Serrano peppers, 3 garlic cloves, ½ medium onion in pan with 1/3-1/4 cup chicken broth you have from cooking your chicken.  After the tomatoes have turned slightly brown on all sides, puree in blender with 1 tsp of oregano.

Once sauce is pureed to the consistency you like, take chicken off bone and spoon sauce over chicken. Since the chicken broth will be salty from the boullion, I let each person salt according to their own taste. I like to top with cilantro, queso fresco, lettuce, and a bit of lime juice.  I eat it with fresh corn tortillas so it is almost more like enchiladas but it tastes much better than the original recipe.

This is yet another Terrific chicken dish that can be made fast and inexpensively. The cilantro is so fresh tasting and the tartness from the tomatillos is a great flavor combo. Pinto beans. Mexican rice completed dinner. Avon congrats on a winner winner chicken dinner! Thank you so much:) much love to You, Patty

Soo very good!! I couldn't find Oaxacan cheese, so had to use Jack, maybe added a touch more garlic. Will make many times! Thanks Avon. Looking forward to leftovers. Delicious!!! UPDATE! I have since found Oaxacan cheese at our little Mexican market. I like it better than the Jack if you can find it!

This is AWESOME!! I love this mole. I have never tried a green mole but it was delicious and the combination of the cooked and raw mole were such great compliments to each other ! I also left the seeds from the jalapenos in for a little extra kick. Thanks for sharing this recipe, its going to become a new regular recipe here. Just wanted to add another note, I used my left over to make enchiladas and they were awesome! I shredded the chicken and kept the cooked sauce with the shredded chicken. Filled the tortillas with the mixture, topped them with the raw mole and then cheese and baked them! Ahhh Heaven :)

I have had this recipe since Avon first shared it, just waiting until I was able to get fresh tomatillo and Oaxacan cheese at the same time.  I finally succeeded and we enjoyed this yesterday.  I used bone in breasts and thighs.  I love how the salsa changes subly between cooked and uncooked.  Great recipe, Avon, thanks for sharing.

This was a pleasant surprise for me.  I really don't enjoy chicken in Mexican food but I decided to jump in and try this even if the Hubs was the only one to eat it.  I have never worked with tomatillos before but have a Hispanic produce stand readily available and they weren't too hard to come by.  Too bad they don't carry the cheese because I absolutely could not find the Oaxacan Cheese.  Anyway I loved this dish!  The best part of it is the contrast between the cooked and fresh verde mole.  I used a shredded Mexican blend cheese and halved the recipe with 3 chicken tenderloins.  There was more than enough verde mole for that much chicken and probably will be enjoyed on chips.  Hubs said it is a keeper!  Thanks Avon for the recipe and for opening my eyes to what I might have missed out on!

Man, I hate to rain on a parade, but DH and I both thought this dish to be quite bland.  But the leftovers, mixed with refried beans and rice (that I served with dinner) made a pretty tasty burrito.

Followed the recipe to the T and it was perfect as is. I knew my blender was going on me and it finally petered out on this recipe but thankfully bigger chunks don't bother us at all. This was the first recipe I used with the tomatillos  from my garden (the ONLY thing that has survived this heat in my garden) and I couldn't be more pleased. Thanks Avon!

well Avon you never disappoint. The dish was very tasty, did I sub, well of course. I can't find tomatillos so I read that a sub would be salsa verde (that was still Greek to me) so I found a recipe on here, Mexican salsa verde and I had all the ingredients. I used celery in place of cilantro-sorry had to-and I served it with ww pasta topped with salsa, avacado, some of the sauce from the chicken, black olives and bit of shredded cheese. So good. I wanted more but had to leave the kitchen. Good thing I took pics so I could hop on the computer to review this and refrain from seconds. Will make again, Gitano says I should be able to find canned tomatillos, I might try that but the fresh sub was good too

This contains a great salsa verde recipe.  We love the brightness of cilantro and lime.  I found the cooking time to be a little long.  My chicken was done after 25 minutes.  It reminded the entire family of enchiladas verdes, and I think corn tortillas would be a great accompaniment.

If this recipe had included the crucial step of sauteing the tomatillos with onion, garlic, peppers and some broth (as suggested in the review by rianna) then this would get five stars. We did as that review suggested and the result was fantastic but that step is really key!

My husband and I also thought it was very bland.  We didn't serve it alongside Mexican rice, maybe that would have helped.  It also might be better leaving the jalapeno seeds in for extra heat and using Mexican cheese.  We couldn't bring ourselves to eat the leftovers, but as one of the reviewers suggested, I bet it would have been good with some refried beans & rice in a burrito.

The very best thing I've ever cooked. Absolutely delicious! I halved the recipe and it turned out great. I didn't change anything. I thought there would be a ton of prep (chopping, etc.) involved, but using a blender/food processor made it so quick and easy. I served it with rice and refried beans.

Wonderful recipe! As other reviewers mentioned, I loved the contrast between the uncooked tomatillo sauce and the cooked. I was hesitant about it as I have only eaten cooked tomatillos in our own homemade salsa verde, but it was excellent. We used one serrano instead of the jalepenos as it was all we had, and I used grated queso ano cheese which turned out excellent as well. Very tasty! Leftovers in a tortilla as an enchilada is just as good as the original!

This was easily a five-star recipe :)  I've been making chile verde for awhile, and I never thought to keep part of the sauce uncooked.  What a difference!  The flavors and colors seem more vibrant this way.  I'll definitely be using this method whenever a recipe calls for a tomatillo sauce.

Just a side note, I used one mid-sized habanero instead of the serranos (I didn't have any on hand), and it turned out fine.

Have made this recipe several times now, LOVE the sauce. Only changes I made due to personal preference was to boil my chicken breast with s&p and a bay leaf before frying and I add 3-5 Serrano peppers for extra heat. Serve with Mexican WHITE rice with poblano rajas in it & green salad. And definitely make EXTRA sauce for enchiladas, meat marinade, or eggs the next day, it's THAT good!
