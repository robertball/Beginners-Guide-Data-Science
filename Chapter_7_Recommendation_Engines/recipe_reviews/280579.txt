It is berry season right now where we live and I had a large piece of grilled salmon leftover from dinner a few nights ago.  This was the perfect summertime recipe.  I added a small amount of fresh cucumber and tomato from our garden.  This was refreshing and filling.  The sweet flavors of the berries with the tanginess of the dressing was super good.  I would make this again!  If you aren't salmon lovers, I believe this would be very good with leftover grilled boneless chicken too!

This was certainly a different tasting salad!! And definitely good for me. It's a dish that will take a bit of getting used to but I know I'll keep making it. Perhaps some slightly over rippened pineapple chunks would add some sweetness.

I used smoked salmon because that's what I had.  This is a wonderful lunch/dinner meal.  Quick and very easy.

Few modifications
1.  Season the salmon 
2. Added some mini seasoned shrimp
3. Added pears 
4. Used Champaign salad dressing instead - perfect combo.

My wife  and daughter loved it!  Also added a few slivered almonds that I had around.
Will think about offering a different dressing--liked the champagne dressing idea someone else posted.
