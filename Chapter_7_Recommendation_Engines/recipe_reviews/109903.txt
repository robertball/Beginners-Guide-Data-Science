I made this for my husband who loves rice cake and he loved it! The texture was better when it cooled off and I added some nuts (peacant & almond)and will add walnuts next time. I also didn't put any white sugar, put less brown sugar than suggested (about a half cup less) it was still sweet enough. also little less milk.

I would suggest making this recipe in half, it makes quite a lot, yummy while hot. sweet and chewy with a hint of coconut.

i made this for my sons class project on china, a picture would have been nice. i dont know if it turned out right. It is like a soft carmel, or a hard sticky jelly with a crispy crust on top. a little plain, lightly sweet, very sticky.

I usually make steamed Chinese cakes but wanted to try this. The crispy edges are so yummy that I always want to steal the corner pieces for myself ! For a half recipe, I used an 8" square pan. The gao rises a fair bit but then deflates rapidly when out of the oven, creating the nice crackly 'crust' on top.  I've made this recipe using reduced and substitute sugars as well as the original recipe--both ways are fine. BTW you can always steam this as originally intended. :)

I love these bake version than the traditional steam method. It's so easy and fast. How ever, I did omit the white sugar and it is sweet enough for me. I also find its easier to use scissors to cut it into bite size. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Best baked gau ever! 
I would definitely make again! 
Would recommend cutting with kitchen scissors or a really sharp knife to get perfect edges!

This is the first time I made this type of mocha. I took it to a small party and it was GONE. Everyone loves it.
