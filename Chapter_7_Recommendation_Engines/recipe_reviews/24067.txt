After experimenting with this recipe a few times, and reading the tips from other reviewers, I think I have it down.  Here is what I have come up with to make the recipe easier to work with.  For starters, I mix everything in my kitchen aid mixer.  I find that I need 1/2 cup less sugar then the recipe calls for to get the perfect consistancy.  When the "dough" is combined well I roll it out on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and put it in the freezer for about 1/2 hour.  (NOTE: If you are going to do patties it is actually easier to leave them at room temperature to harden up because the frozen dough reacts too quickly with the hot melted chocolate and breaks down very easily.  The room temperature dough does not react as quickly and therefore does not break down very fast.) Another problem I ran into was getting the chocolate mixture to be the correct consistancy.  I found it was easier to work with if it is more liquid like - done by adding a very small amount of milk or cream.  Once the chocolate is the correct consistancy I brushed it onto the rolled peppermint mixture and returned it to the freezer.  I then applied a second coat after the chocolate had set and again returned it to the freezer.  Flip it over and repeat.  Once the whole thing is set it is very easy to cut it into squares or even to use a round cookie cutter to make circular shapes.  The candy is to die for and worth all the work involved in its creation.

This was a great recipe! I used peppermint oil instead of peppermint extract, and the first time I made this, I thought that they were the same thing.  But now that I've learned that oil is about 100 times stronger than extract, I've made it again and it tastes heavenly.  If you ever use peppermint oil, three drops is plenty!

Will definitely make again!  But here's a tip: freeze the patties first before dipping them in the chocolate and don't make them much wider than your fork.  I had problems with them becoming soft when dipping them in the heated chocolate.  A few fell apart.

I used a combination of this recipe and the Eagle Brand one summitted here, as I wanted to use a whole can of condensed milk.  This makes a lot of patties!  This combination of condensed milk and powdered sugar is just the best!  It makes a fantastic dough which is really easy to manipulate.  Rather than form them into balls individually, I roll out the dough and cut out the patties with a cookie cutter.  You can stick to rounds or use something pretty like a heart.  I definitely recommend following the suggestion to freeze before dipping in chocolate.  I'll never buy peppermint patties from the store again - these are great and far cheaper!

I changed it a little and It made it SOOO easy and much cleaner! I simply put a little chocolate on the bottom of a cupcake liner and then put in the peppermint patty (after I froze them for 5min) then added a little more chocolate. Froze again for 5mins. They came right out of the liners and all had pretty designs! I used the renolds foil cupcake liners, they seemed to work better than regular cupcake liners!

These are the BEST! I've been making these for 5 years now and have given them away in gift baskets along with the recipe on a nicely decorated recipe card for Christmas. What a HIT!  They are so light and refreshing for an after dinner sweet. Served best directly from the freezer.  Also a couple of tips...when kneading the dough use powdered sugar on the silpat or countertop NOT corn starch and do not cut the sugar as it changes the consistency and makes it much harder to dip successfully.  When the chocolate starts to get lumpy from cooling reheat and add a little more shortening until smooth again.  I find it easier to dip "frozen" patties with tongs rather than forks, just don't submerge patties for too long and you can always cool and double dip for better coverage.  These goodies are worth their weight in gold so don't get discouraged or give up! :)

The patties themselves (w/out chocolate) were excellent! May I suggest to make smaller, rather than larger patties. If they are large they won't dry enough on the outside and will break when you hold them for more than a few seconds. 

My reccomendation : Instead of dipping these (they melt in the pot), freeze them, and then brush  the melted chocolate onto them with a basting or pastry brush.  Then, flip and repeat when dry

JUST like York patties.  Great texture.  I added extra peppermint extract...almost a whole teaspoon more.  Gave it the perfect strength.  Also had a TOUCH of almond extract in it...people like that.  
Tip:  make the patties really small like only an inch when flattened.  Better in smaller doses.  Also, add paraffin to chocolate for sheen.  
Freeze after.  Best served "frozen"
The peppermint mixture WILL NOT FREEZE.  So don't bother trying to get it to for easier dipping.  Use a slotten spatula for dipping.  

LOVE THEM

Easy & delicious!!!  I will definitely be making this again.   I used a whole can of condensed milk, 1 tablespoon & I don't really know how much confectioner's sugar. :-)  I just kept adding it until it got too stiff to stir.  I powdered the counter with the sugar and kneaded it adding more as necessary. I patted it out to about 1/4 inch thickness & used a dose cup from children's OTC medicine to cut out little rounds.  It worked perfect and made the dipping easier.

I have made this recipie as christmas gifts for the past two years - everyone loves them!  They keep in the fridge or freezer for a long time - so they can be made ahead of time.  I found using an electric fondue pot to keep the chocolate melted while doing the dipping works really well - just make sure you keep the setting on low!

Tried a similar recipe out of a cookbook, with a few variations: added a few teaspoons of butter to the sugar, added a tsp. of vanilla, and chilled the patties in the freezer for a few minutes (this made them easier to dip); a great activity to share with kids, and the results are wonderful!

These are very good! I followed the suggestion of the other reviewer and froze them for about an hour, and I didn't make them very big, it made them easier to coat with the chocolate. 
Great recipe!

The only reason I gave it four stars was because the mint was very sweet. The second batch I made I cut the powdered sugar back to 3 cups and it was perfect. Otherwise, great recipe, it reminded me of the York peppermint patties!

Oh my goodness!  I've never made candy before and I am proud to say these came out wonderfully.  I used a candy mold, so I made them slightly different.  I filled the mold up 1/3 of the way with three different kinds of chocolate to see which one would go best with the filling (dark chocolate was by far the best).  I brushed the chocolate up the sides and put in the fridge to harden.  I put a small ball of the filling into the truffle and topped with more melted chocolate.  I left out the shortening (personal preference).  These were amazing and I will definitely use these as additional Xmas gifts later this month!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

These are just like York peppermint patties.  I went ahead and used the entire 14.5 oz. can of condensed milk and just added a half t. of extra extract and extra sugar slowly until it seemed the right consistency.  I might have added too much because the "dough" was a little dry and difficult to roll into balls.  I used the bottom of a glass to flatten.  Some of them cracked around the edges when flattened, making them not smooth circles, again, maybe because I used too much sugar.  I made a double boiler to melt the chocolate and used some parafin to thin it out instead of shortening.  I used a fork to dip and scraped the bottom of the fork against the bowl as I took it out.  This kept them neat.  I used another reviewer's suggestion of pushing the bottom of the fork lightly atop each patty after dipping to create the York "grooves" on the top.  This made about 80 patties.  Using the parafin I had extra chocolate leftover which I put in a jar in the fridge to use for my next dipping project.  YUM!

VERY GOOD! Tastes just like a York Peppermint Patty!  I only used 2 3/4 cups of confectioner's sugar because it started to get too dry and crumbly.  I used a cookie scoop to form the balls so they would all be the same size.  Be careful not to press them too thin as it would take more chocolate to cover and taste too chocolaty.  I froze them prior to covering with chocolate.  Placed in a tin and put in the refrigerator, they are going to be a welcome treat.  Thank you PATTY STOCKTON for sharing your recipe.

These are awesome! I used LorAnn peppermint flavoring oil and it took 12 drops to get the mint strength about the same as a York. I started by mixing 4 drops in with the sweetened condensed milk, added the powdered sugar, kneaded and then tested. Added 4 more drops, kneaded again, etc. I used a better quality chocolate instead of chocolate chips. This recipe made 4 dozen patties, each about the size of a half dollar.

If you plan on making these, set aside the better part of your day, because they are a project.  But it's worth it!  I dyed my dough green, which looked cute.  Keeping them frozen is a necessity; I took them out from the freezer one at a time as I was dipping them and didn't run into any problems.  Oh, and if you're ill-prepared like me and run out of wax paper in the middle, switch one of your cereals into a zippered bag and use the bag that they come in.

I truly am not sure what I am doing wrong here. I used peppermint extract and followed the recipe exactly. I found that the consistency was very watered down and thin. I thought hmmm, let me just put in more powdered sugar to make it thicker. I ended up putting another 2 cups in. Still feeling something wasn't right I still went with it. Taking the advice of others I placed in the freezer hoping that it would firm up. It did a little but was still soft to where you could put your finger impression in it. After looking at the bottle of extract I saw it had over 80% alcohol in it so it wasn't going to set up in the freezer. I did like the way it smelled up my house . Maybe with peppermint oil this time. Hmmm very dissapointed. Didn't even get to use my chocolate!

Excellent candy!  Note:  one of the reviews suggested using cream or milk if thinning is needed. Tried this and whole batch of chocolate solidified (even over double boiler). Luckily had enough chocolate to complete the batch. Used a bit more shortening and all was perfect!!  Thanks so much.

These taste just like the real thing! I mixed the dough in my Kitchenaid, and like another reviewer, cut the sugar to 3 1/2 cups. This turned out to be a mistake. The dough was fine to handle, but after coating with chocolate and sitting at room temp, they are too soft. My bad. The next time I make them (and there will definitely be a next time!), I will use the full 4 cups of sugar. I will also make them a little smaller,  they would be easier to manage when coating with chocolate. Very easy to make and very, very good!

Soooo good. I used 3 1/2 cups of powdered sugar, 2 tsps. mint extract, with a dash of almond extract. Instead of patties, rolled into smaller than marble sized balls. Put on waxed paper, froze, then dipped one at a time in choc. Can also drizzle choc. on balls, but the dipped do look alot nicer, if  giving away. Good project to do in front of t.v. when you're not in a hurry.

These were so easy to make:) I had to make my own condensed milk, and I used mint extract, it was what I thought was peppermint. I also used vanilla and chocolate bark to coat. On the white Patties, I sprinkled them with green sprinkles. So cute!! My kids love them!! Ps. Vanilla or chocolate bark is much easier to coat candies with than chocolate chips. Learned from experience:)

I just finished a batch of the filling right now and tasted it.  The peppermint flavor is not as strong as I would like it to be.  (I used McCormick pure peppermint extract).  I could also still taste the sweetened condensed milk which isn't a flavor that I'd like in this candy.  Next time around, I would increase the peppermint extract to 2 teaspoons.

I used this recipe and added food coloring to make red/green ones that were half dipped in chocolate.  I ended up making the patties too big and they cracked when I dipped them in chocolate.  However, they were absolutely DELICIOUS!  My friends who don't judge the appearance of holiday treats just loved them :)  I will have to try again and make them smaller!

These seem to get easier every time I make them! I let mine dry for about 3 hours and that seemed to prevent them falling apart when dipping. I added a large chunk of Copha (shortening) instead of butter to get the chocolate thin enough. I have also made these with strawberry essence and coconut extract. Always a hit!

This recipes is so easy and delicious. I did freeze the patties as some reviewers had mentioned, however I only did that for about an hour or so, and mostly to keep them from spreading more and sticking to the cookie sheet since the dough is not completely stiff. I also dusted my hands with confectioners sugar while flattening the patties to help from sticking to the sheet, also, even though the dough is not really sticky. After that hour in the freezer to keep shape, I took them out, flipped them, and continued to flip them occasionally for the next 24 hours. Perfect results. They dried out enough that when they are broken in half, they make that same sound as York. No issues with the chocolate melting the patty as some other reviewers had stated, either. I melted chocolate in the microwave on the defrost setting, added a bit of shortening and wax to make it smooth, give them a nice sheen, and make sure they don't melt on contact with fingers. Will make again, probably tonight, since there's no way these are going to last until Christmas!

Easy and delicious. A tip for dipping: Use spoons. If you pass the patty between two spoons, you can easily coat each patty in chocolate without it falling apart. I used large dinner spoons - worked like a charm!

Just made these for Fathers Day and they were great!  We live in England so we can't get peppermint patties and these were an admirable substitute.  
A few changes...I melted a broken up bar of dark chocolate in the microwave with a few teaspoons of butter to get a good consistence for dipping.  Also, after making the patties, I let them rest if the refrigerator for a few hours before dipping them in the chocolate with a fork.  Had no problems with them falling apart.  Also, used peppermint oil instead of extract because I felt that the extract did not provide enough of a strong peppermint flavor.  Only use a few drop of the oil, however, as it is very strong.  
Overall, everyone was very pleased with the results.

These taste great, but I found it time consuming and frustrating to dip them in the chocolate.  The chocolate was so thick that I had to add quite a bit more shortening.  I first tried adding cream like one of the other reviewers said, but that made it worse.  I don't think that if I had tried to dip them withough freezing them it would have worked at all.  The flavor, however, was great!

There are some steps missing somewhere.  They stuck to the wax paper.  The chocolate was not thin enough to dip the patties.  When I attempted to dip the patties they melted.  I was very disapointed.

These are great.  Easy and taste just like the boughten ones.  Everyone loves them.  Can anyone tell me how they stored these patties. I want to make some ahead of time for Christmas and I wasn't sure if they need to be put in the fridge or just stored in a container. If you can help with this please let me know.

It took forever for the patties to "dry" and you really need to use parchment paper because they stick to the wax paper.  They had to dry overnight and then the chocolate mixture was too thick.  I thinned it a little bit but they were still falling apart and I have no idea if they will ever set up without having to keep them stored in the freezer.  What good is that?  I read the "what to drink" suggestions at the side and think you should skip making the candy and just drink the port!

The patties came out beautifully and taste really yummy. I thought I was being smart using white chocolate with green food color to decorate the top but the white chocolate really takes away from the peppermint flavor so next time I'll just use mint choco chips.

I ran out of powdered sugar, so the dough was stiff, but not as stiff as it should have been. So, the patties didn't harden at room temp., so I drizzled them with chocolate and froze them.  So tasty!

Great!  The boys in the family loved them, not diet food though!  Very sweet, I made my own peppermint extract by boiling some minced peppermint and draining off liquid into my mix.  Worked well.

Spectacular!! Beautiful and elegant, tasted just like the real thing, right down to the texture of the mint filling. The only difference is that you can pile on as much chocolate as you like. They take a while to cool and don't let the patties dry out too long or they'll get hard. I didn't have any semi-sweet chocolate, so instead, I melted a bag of bittersweet (60% cacao) and 2 oz. unsweetened bakers chocolate and 2 tbsp white sugar. It worked out well but next time I might try mixing in a little milk.

I followed the recipe, but as suggested I added an extra teaspoon of peppermint extract and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract.  Delicious!  I rolled-out the confection/dough as you would pie crust to aprox 1/4"-3/8" thickness and used a round cookie cutter and cut-out circles (slightly larger than a US quarter).  Froze the dough cut-outs for aprox 2 hours and dipped in chocolate.  I used chocolate chips with paraffin to coat.  I also made my own dipping tool out of large stainless steel paperclips.  The tool looks like one of those wire dippers you get to dip Easter eggs.  I made the circle on the end the same diameter of my dough cut-outs and held the candy secure with a toothpick in my other hand.  Everything worked perfectly!

I am crazy for mint chocolate anything. The consistency of my dough was perfect, but it wasn't nearly minty enough! I added more extract after tasting it, but I feel like I could've doubled the extract entirely and been happy. Maybe I just reaaally like mint. :P I'd definitely try the other reviewer's tips because I had little success dipping the patties directly into the chocolate. I ended up using a spoon to 'paint' the chocolate onto one side, flip it over, and 'paint' the other side.

I found this recipe almost 10 years ago and have made it every Christmas since. I do sometimes have to play with the amount of sugar vs.condensed milk, but I love this recipe. Smaller patties work perfect for dipping because they don't break. I can't handle the store patties as I feel like I'm eating toothpaste, and I love that I can control how much peppermint goes into this.

Have already rated this before and left comments but had to share! Over the weekend I tried this recipe with orange and cherry extracts....oh my goodness!!! So yummy! Raspberry is next on my list! I had to use more orange extract than what the recipe calls for (add a little at a time until you get the taste you want) and also added food coloring before adding sugar. They came out fabulous and everyone I've given samples to LOVES them!!

I just made these today and they are amazing!  I used the suggestions to reduce the powdered sugar by 1/2 cup and add an additional teaspoon of peppermint.  The main thing I changed on my own is that I actually rolled them out and used my small biscuit cutter to make them all uniform in size.  Worked perfectly!  I just had to put a little extra p.s. on the waxed paper first. I will definitely make these again.  I actually think they are better than York!

The taste is amazing but I'm deducting some star points for the recipe technique. Oh my goodness did I ever have a time getting a single patty coated with chocolate without a complete breakdown/melting of the patty. Finally had success spooning chocolate on the patties, letting it set, and flipping to cover the other side. 

Also did a batch with cinnamon extract. Very yummy.

These do taste just like a peppermint patty, but dipping them wasn't all that easy. The heat from the chocolate "melted" the patties.

I read all of the reviews and I agree that brushing on the chocolate is much easier than attempting to dip them!  They were awesome though and well worth the effort.  Everyone raved about them and they have quickly become a Christmas tradition for me!!

I have made several batches of this recipe over the last few years, they are delicious. Due to these being somewhat time consuming, when I do my Christmas baking, I usually make these first. For some reason, this year I didn't. Boy, am I glad I didn't. I made the Peppermint Bark yesterday and when I chopped/ground up my candy canes in my food processor, I saved the very fine/powdery part of the candy canes and melted them in my chocolates for my bark. Well, I still had a little bit of that powder left over and decided to sprinkle some of it on top of a few of my peppermint patties...HEAVEN!!!

I have made these twice and they are always a hit. This time, I forgot that the recipe included condensed milk, so I found a substitute: http://www.cooks.com/rec/view/0,183,151170-244199,00.html (make the full substitute amount, but start with the 3/4 cup as the peppermint patties call for and add additional as needed for consistency). Note also that the substitute is a darker color than condensed milk, so the filling won't be bright white. I like the taste better with condensed milk, but this is still good. 

For the chocolate, the first time I used store-bought prefab dipping/candy chocolate, which was fine. This time, I used a full bag of Ghirardelli’s bittersweet chocolate chips which tastes really good and doesn't have all the extra stuff in it. If time allowed, I might consider double dipping the chocolate to get a thicker shell.

Finally, I immersed the creams in the chocolate and then set them on a wire rack over the chocolate bowl to let the excess drip off for a few seconds (10-15 seconds) before moving them to a sheet of parchment paper to set up.

These are really good, no doubt; but they are way to technical. I made them a while ago, they were gone so fast! So, i love them, but only after they were made. -- I'm looking for another recipe; Everyone keeps changing this one and it's confusing me now trying to remember what I did.

2 things I do remember: They took a long time to dry (don't forget to flip them 1/2 way, whenever that is). & I unintentionally used just 1 layer of chocolate.
I just started sampling & asking for advice (lol). My family & friends said they were great the way they were. ... I hate adding more & more shortening to my chocolate. yuck. (Next melting, I'll use milk to thin, like a review suggested.)

My lesson: these are really good, I think they take unnecessary work, & one might save some trouble & dipping if your chocolate is really thick. =)

These did not work out very well. Someone in the comments suggested using cream or milk to thin out the chocolate, it immediately seized up on me.  They white part stuck to the wax paper and dried before I could get them all dipped.  Dipping was very difficult.  I am not much of a candy maker, so not sure if I'll attempt these again.  I had made them for my husband who was overseas and I vacuum sealed them and they were hard as a rock when they got there.

Everyone raved about these and begged me for this recipe. It is my absolute favourite! I put more peppermint than called for, as I like mine SUPER minty. Also, I am lazy and I just roll them into balls - small ones. I find they are easier to dip in chocolate that way.

Delicious recipe. I used 1 can store brand milk (300mL) and tinted the patties green. 3C chocolate chips was way to much for me. I brushed the chocolate on one side, put them in the fridge, and then brushed the other side with chocolate topping them with crushed candy cane. I kept the chocolate warm with my fondue set - it worked great! I will definitely make this recipe again - it takes a long time to make, but it is worth it!

WOW!!!!  These taste exactly like, if not better than a real peppermint patties!!!!  I was concerned that 1 1/2 teaspoons of peppermint would be a little to strong, but it was perfect.  I did a mixture of brushing on the chocolate and spooning on the chocolate.  Both worked well.  To make the spooned on chocolate look decorative, a few min after putting on the chocolate, tap it with a fork once and it puts a very nice design on the top.  I think next time I will make them a one bite size.    Thank You for a great recipe.

I ended up only using three cups of the sugar and followed the suggestion of brushing on the chocolate instead of dipping it. I also added a splash of milk to the chocolate mix.

Not sure if this has already been mentioned ... but I use the peppermint patty part of this recipe to fill chocolates. I use melting wafers to coat a mold. That goes in the freezer and then it is very easy to squish a pat of the peppermint patty in the mold and top with more melted chocolate.  I think that dark melting wafers (I buy bulk at the grocery store)would work really well if you wanted to make dip the patties like the recipe suggests.  Melting wafers are fairly fool-proof :)

Very easy to make and very tasty. I added the confectioner's sugar until I came to what I thought was the right consistency, which wasn't the same as the recipe (it was less.) Rolled the "dough" out and used heart-shaped cookie cutters, then froze them on a cookie sheet until I was ready to dip them in chocolate. I found dipping only half of the mint was good enough because the chocolate became overwhelming if I did the whole mint. These will become a staple in my holiday baking (actually, year round baking) because I now realize it's easier, cheaper and just plain yummier to make your own than to buy the commercial ones in the store.

They were good, but a total mess.  After much trial and error, though, I did manage a few presentable ones for Christmas cookie plates to give away.  Hope it goes smoother this year!

These were so tasty! I made them just bigger than quarters - which means I had over 100 of them. The size worked well because they didn't fall apart in the chocolate since they fit on the fork. To anyone who hasn't ever dipped things in chocolate, might I suggest reading up on it first. I did not know that a single drop of water could ruin the melted choclate and worse, I added some butter to get the hardened chocolate back to a normal consistency. I had no clue why my patties weren't hardening after being dipped. They had to stay in the freezer until we ate them up!

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 for appearance not taste. The taste was great, although I will use 3.5 instead of 4 cups of conf. sugar next time for an even creamier middle. I had no probelms with the middle falling apart. I just put them in the freezer for about an hour, and they held together perfect. The chocolate didn't look as nice as I wanted it too after dipping - it did not have a smooth finish to it. Not a big deal, really, but when given as gifts you want them to look perfect. I will surely make these again with noted changes! Yummy

I will make a couple of changes the next time I make these. First, use less icing sugar (maybe 3 1/2 cups - I needed to add more condensed milk). I also needed more chocolate, maybe 4 cups. Second, use parchment paper instead of waxed paper - it doesn't stick. It was easier to get them off the paper when they were cold, so I put them in the freezer for about 1/2 an hour. Wait for the chocolate to be almost cooled - it needs to be runny still. Instead of a fork, I used small tongs (the ones that are like a triangle), and drop the pattties into the chocolate, flip them over them take them out. Very good recipe - will make again for Christmas!

These are fantastic!  I followed the recipe as written, only added a half cup less of icing sugar.  Letting them air dry works great.  Used a fork to dip in the chocolate.

These were great. I put crunched up candy canes on top. I made different sizes & thicknesses... I'd suggest going thicker vs. thinner.

These are a lot of work but are soooo good! I make them as written. The only difference is we serve them right out of the freezer. Chocolate is all crunchy and the center stays a wonderful texture. Resist the urge to make them too thick. They are much better on the thin side!

Wonderful recipe!  We made these for the Holidays and they went quickly. Everyone raved about them and couldn't believe I'd made them myself! I added a bit extra peppermint extract and took the advice of others and froze the patties first before dipping.  (Also, it really does help make the dipping easier if you make smaller patties.)  I highly recommend this recipe!

I've tried, and failed, at this recipe 3 times. Problem #1 - I tried freezing the patties as others suggested, but the condensation from the frozen patties made the chocolate seize up. Problem #2 - The chocolate was way too thick for dipping. Problem #3 - When I tried just letting them dry out, they fell apart when I dipped them in the chocolate. The chocolate got all lumpy and gross. I don't understand what I'm doing wrong!  Help! I want to love this recipe!

Amazing!  People I give these patties to, often come back willing to PAY for more!  I use real organic peppermint oil (about $7 for 2  oz--not extract) and it turns out much better.  I use about 4 & 1/2 tsp of oil.  The mint oil I use is diluted with sunflower oil so if you try my suggestion, make sure you don't use too much! (incase your oil is more pure than mine)

For mixing in the oil, I find it works well to mix 1 cup of powdered sugar with the condensed milk, then thoroughly mix-in the oil, and then mix in the rest of the sugar.

I thought these were delicious!
I gradually added in the powdered sugar after 3 cups.
I ended up using about 3 1/2 cups
I did not use shortening but I did use about 1 tablespoon of corn syrup to help with any dryness.

I also used dark chocolate and about 1/10 of a bar of Paraffin Gulf Wax to help chocolate melt to my preferred consistency and prevent melting (come time to eat) too rapidly.


I formed patties on wax paper. 
Placed a toothpick in each patty.
Froze for 23-30 mins and when chocolate was nice and melted I dipped each patty and re-froze.
:)

I love thias recipe...  Big hit with my family at the holidays. The one thing i changed is to let them dry on parchment paper rather wax paper. They do not stick to the parchment when you have to flip them and they dried better on there as well.

These peppermint patties are amazing! The dough wouldn't set on its own, so I froze the patties for a few minutes prior to dipping. No problems afterwards with the patties crumbling in the chocolate.

Wonderful recipe. Try the suggestion of using damp hands to roll the balls but, not too damp. Big help! Also, instead of air dry the flaten discs were placed in the freezer about 20 minutes.  I only took a few out at a time to dip in chocolate. As another person suggested let the chocolate cool a few minutes before dipping. This worked perfectly. You can use a tad bit more of shorting to loosen the mix if necessary. Hershey Special Dark Chips were used. Yummy!!

After a few snaffus, the end result was great.  I read many of the reviews, so I knew to chill the mint before trying to dip it in the chocolate.  But no ones mentioned in the previous reviews that the choc chips gave them any trouble.  Mine came out TERRIBLE.  The chips melted with the shortening resulted in a goopey, grainy mess.  I threw the chocolate away, went back to the grocery store and bought the melting chocolate (almond bark chocolate) that I use to dip pretzels and such.  I microwaved it and it worked fine.  I won 2nd place at a cooking contest party!  They really are delicious if you skip the chips and shortening and stick with good ole' melting chocolate.  Everyone loved them!

These are great.  Only need 3.5 cups of the sugar.  Makes so many!  But I noticed that they get stale a little quicker than I liked (and I did wrap them in candy foils).

Taste is good but I found the dipping didn't work at all. I had to freeze them for a half hour - an hour first and them they worked fine. This could be because my pepermint dough was on the soft side but I wouldn't change that because the softer dough made for goeier tastier patties. ( i didnt use anywhere close to the amount of sugar)

Wow these are really good!  They taste better than the York Peppermint Patties.  I did use a whole can of sweetened condensed milk.  It was about 1 1/4 cups.  I just adjusted the sugar.  I didn't measure, just kept adding and mixing until it was not sticky.  I added 1 TBS of peppermint extract.  Others said it wasn't enough peppermint.  Mine are perfect!  I formed them into patties, let it sit overnight.  Don't make the patties too big.  Then I dipped half in chocolate and let it set chocolate side up. To speed up the process, I put the tray in the freezer, then dipped again.  I used dark chocolate.  MMMMMM....

I thought this would come out more like fondant or marzipan.  It definately took more than two hours to harden, try 24-36.  I could have possibly added more powdered sugar or lessened the milk (?).  I also felt the peppermint flavor was too strong.  One dram, or maybe less, would have probably been sufficient.

I made these patties as a last minute addition to my holiday treats and boy am I glad I did. They are heavenly and really easy to make. In addition to the peppermint extract,I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and I only needed 3 cups of powdered sugar.
In my opinion,these taste a whole lot better than the national brand we all know.

Delicious!!  They tasted just like peppermint patties.  The texture was softer though, which made them silkier, but they melted very quickly.

My five year old son and I made these yesterday.  After reading the reviews, I really was skeptical about how they would turn out.  We followed the recipe exactly, but put the patties into the freezer as some reviews had said.  We also made one-inch patties with a cutter after rolling out the dough.  So easy, not messy and it only took us an hour!  Fantastic recipe!

These are delicious!  First of all- when I make these again (and I say when, because I will!) I'm going to experiment with the s.c. milk to confectioner sugar ratio. Based on how mine turned out (I followed the recipe exactly) I think you could use considerably less s.c. milk, but it's just a theory. Also, rather than heating the chocolate in a pan I used a bain marie (double boiler) which made life so much easier- I didn't have to worry about the chocolate getting funky, burnt, or any of the other things that could happen- plus I was able to have nicely melted chocolate for the entire time it took me to coat the patties. 

I think tweaking the  'dough' will make a big difference in how these set up. As the recipe calls for, my patties were falling apart and melting before I could do anything. I had to keep them in the freezer at all times, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing- I think I may prefer them frozen. (Seriously, they are so good frozen!)

I bought a little circle fondant cutter so they were the size of the mini York patties and rolled the dough out flat before cutting. The size was perfect because where my dough was a bit thick, the taste was off (too much creamy center for how much chocolate it took to coat them)- so don't make them too huge unless you can get them really flat for multiple bites.

All in all- deeelish! It was very time consuming (for me) and messy but definitely worth the effort. Practice makes perfect so I'll keep trying!

I also followed the suggestion and froze it before dipping.  I had to keep returning the patties to the frezer as they thawed as they were very hard to work with if were not frozen.  It took more time that I would have liked but they were good at any rate.

My little boy and I made these as a gift basket item for his teachers at school.  I absolutely loved the taste, but I struggled with the dipping process.  We opted to call ours "ugly but fantastic".  We sprinkled some with ground up peppermint candies, added red food coloring to the filling , and even dipped some in white chocolate.  The teachers loved them - what was left of them after my children and husband got through with them, that is!!!

The thinner patties didn't work out well at all.  They disintegrated as soon as they were put in the chocolate.  I did as others suggested and put them in the freezer but they still were flimsy.  Thankfully I made larger ones that held their shape, but I can't  say I'm a fan.

I find that using semi-sweet and unsweetened bars of baking chocolate makes for a better contrast in flavors.

Also, whenever I make these, I do NOT use peppermint EXTRACT, as that makes for too WEAK a peppermint flavor, in my judgment. Instead, I substitute peppermint OIL, which is stronger; LorAnn Oils provides me with my supplies of THAT. Mine are thus so strong they have the capability to knock you off your noodle with their peppermint flavor!

I have been making these for awhile now.  I use about 6 cups of powered sugar, 14 oz can of condensed milk and 3.5 tsp of peppermint extract.  I use the small pampered chef scoop.  I spray it with PAM first and then start using it. I scoop a little ball onto wax paper and then press lightly to form a disc.  Works great.  Makes 5 dozen using this size.  I also freeze the dough first.

I didn't read the reviews before I started making these and probably should. Most recipes tell you to freeze the dough, but I liked this because you just rolled them into a ball, cut them and put them in the fridge for a few hours to dry out.  That part worked really well.  The part I was a novice to was handling chocolate.  Simply melting chocolate chips in the microwave or in a double boiler will result in a chocolate that is too thick for dipping.  You have to add either crisco or butter a tablespoon at a time, and keep beating it while the fat melts.  It will first be gloppy but as the fat melts, it will thin and become smooth.  Keep adding fat until the chocolate is dippable consistency. My first dozen were thick chocolate bombs.  By the end, it was able to just dip a skiff of chocolate onto the dried out peppermint wafer.  This recipe made a lot of patties.  Maybe next time I'll halve it.  They are good, but the chocolate is tricky until you get the hang of it.

love this recipe.  The only change I made is let them harden for 1-2hrs than freeze for 1 hr than drunk into the chocolate.   I have taken a picture to compare the difference.  when frozen and dipped the chocolate becomes a solid quicker.

Oh my, this is a great recipe!   I have made 5 times in the last week!!   I used a good quality peppermint extract (not oil),  I think that is important! I used 2 teaspoons instead of 1 1/2 teas. But I like peppermint!  I tried rolling and cutting out and also rolling the dough into balls and  flattening with a glass.  Either works.  BUT, you need to  keep dipping the glass or cookie cutter into powdered sugar each time you press!   I let dry a few minutes on parchment lined cookie sheets.  I brushed the tops and sides with melted chocolate using a silicon pastry brush.  Put into refrigerator for a few minutes, flipped,covered bottoms with chocolate, put back into refrigerator and then stored in containers in refrigerator.   So good!!

Great recipe.  I've made these for years during the holidays. Not difficult but time-consuming...still worth it.  I've been wanting to try to change up the flavor of the filling.  Has anyone tried other flavors?  Vanilla, orange, coffee, Irish creme?  If so, how did it work out?

Mine are still setting but it took over a kg of sugar to get it thick enough to form patties...did I do something wrong?

Everyone loved these. Reduced the sugar per top reviewer suggestion and it was still plenty sweet. I overheated the chocolate the first time even though I was using a double boiler. It curdled, hardened and  was useless for dipping, but that was the mistake of a novice. Next try I stirred while heating & it turned out fine.

We didn't make any changes except made extra to use up whole can of milk.  But, this recipe is way too sweet.  It needs more in it than just sugar on top of sugar flavoured with peppermint.

Super easy. Make smaller balls because when the chocolate touches the peppermint balls in warms up a little and spreads.

Tastes good but impossible to get the chocolate to cover the mint without the mint melting and deforming. They looked terrible per the recipe so i salvaged them by partially dipping them in chocolate.

I was looking for something easy and since this had very few ingredients I made the assumptions it wouldn't be too difficult. Hardest part was dipping. When frozen they don't fall apart but they look horrendous they kept sticking to the fork which made it really difficult.Taste-wise not bad, very sweet and the flavor of the sugar and milk was over-powering.

Wonderfully easy to make and delicious.  I prefer using Dark Chocolate Chips rather than Semi-Sweet.  I also needed to increase the portions for the Chocolate Coating as I ended up with thicker chocolate.

Okay, I had a hard time rating these because the flavor is AMAZING, but I had to deviate so far from the instructions to make these work, but in the end, I think taste is more important, so I went with 5 stars. The flavor is truly FANTASTIC! Better than York's. I made these for my husband for Valentines Day this past holiday and he loved them so much that he has asked for them nearly every week or two since, and said that he can't even eat York's anymore! Haha. But anyway, this is what I did. I used all of the same ingredients (except I used butter instead of shortening) and followed the same instructions all the way up until the "turning once" part. I was not able to turn them, even after 1 hours and 20 minutes, because they were still not hard enough. So I just left them. Then, after that, I halved the chocolate/"shortening" mix and melted that down over a double boiler, but I had to add a little bit of milk to make them melt (I'm sure cream would be better, but I didn't have it and the milk still worked and tasted great). As for how much milk, I just eye-balled. Maybe 3 tablespoons or so? Anyway, once that melted, I just poured it over the patties and made it as nice and circular as I could. I put them in the fridge, where they need to sit for at least an hour. Then I get them back out, flip them over (which worked fine once they were cold), then repeated the process. I'd let them harden another hour at least, cut off the excess chocolate, put in a pretty container...done!

These are good, I made them for St. Valentine's day for my husband. They are very yummy, but next time I'll make them smaller than my smallest cookie scoop. These are very soft and difficult to dip in the chocolate, but worth the effort. I froze mine over night before I dipped them, but it didn't greatly help.

I loved this recipe! Simple, but great. I didn't stick to the measurements exactly since I wanted to use the whole can of sweetened condensed milk, but you want to eyeball the addition of the confectioners' sugar anyway--keep adding it until the "dough" is no longer sticky. Will definitely make these again, and maybe more adventurously so... the dough can easily be molded into fun shapes!

This is a very nice recipe.  One reviewer suggested using 3 1/2 cups powdered sugar instead of the stated 4 cups in the recipe.  I used a stand mixer to incorporate the ingredients, but added 1/4 cup more powdered sugar, as it is still a bit tacky to handle.  You can chill them for 10 or 15 minutes prior to dipping them in the chocolate.  I would suggest the melted chocolate be at room temperature; otherwise, the patties will disentegrate.  You can also use a two-tine fork to dip the patties (find them at Michaels where they have baking supplies), which I found more useful than household forks.

I must have made them thinner because I got twice as much out of the batter. I ended up using a lot more shortening to thin the chocolate to dipping consistency. I loved them and so did everyone I gave them to for Christmas.

Outstanding. I did not freeze the dough and wish I had....definitely would have been easier to dip in chocolate. We added an extra teaspoon of peppermint fir the second batch, and an extra tablespoon of the condensed milk. The result was a flavor and consistency more like the name brand peppermint patty.  We figured these at a cookie exchange and the crowd loved them.

Better than York! I also recommend freezing on a sheet pan and coating one side at a time in chocolate with pastry brush.

Fantastic and easy to use recipe. They are beyond yummy.

Tips: Coat hands in icing sugar, roll into balls,pat into patties, place on cookie sheet with wax paper sprinkled with icing sugar.  Freeze for 15-20min
Tips: For chocolate I use 2 cups choc chips, 1/3 cup grated parrafin wax. Heat in double boiler. Dip patties into melted choc using a teaspoon and place back on pan and back into freezer for another 20 minutes or so.  Place into container of your choice with wax paper inbetween each layer for easy removal....and easy it will be when your family finds where they are!!!!  Thanks for the Great Recipe!! Kim C

I wish I could give this 10 stars!  These are INCREDIBLE!!!  They take a little time to make, but they aren't difficult to work with.  I followed the recipe exactly, although I gave up measuring the sugar...I just slowly added more until it got to the consistency I wanted.  Other than that, I followed it as written, and am completely in love with this candy!  I highly recommend these :)

These taste way better than the ones you buy in the store and so easy to make (just time consuming). Next time, I think I'll try dark chocolate and I'll use a higher quality chocolate. I scorched the chips somehow so they came out pretty ugly. I suggest a double-boiler to avoid that.

My husband loves these! I would definitely follow the advice to chill the patties for a bit before you dip them. The only other challenge for me was that the chocolate coating came out really thick. I guess that's not a real negative for most people :)

I just made this today and it was delicious! I failed miserably with the chocolate because I've never done this kind of thing before. I ended up somehow making it chunky and the patties melted as I was trying to dip them. So I just gave up and spread the chocolate on top of the patties and just let it set that way. Still turned out yummy, just not pretty.

This was harder than it looked.  I finally gave up after doing half of the batch and made rocky road out of the rest of it.  That turned out great!  The patties tasted good but I couldn't get them to dip without melting.  I froze them for an hour before I tried.  Any suggestions?  Or is it just practice!

This were amazing! I made a trial batch just in case I can't make them. They turned out great! I only made enough for 15 but ended up getting 21, and they were pretty large. I thought that the filling tasted like a mint Oreo. Yummy! But all in all it turned out great! They were gone by the next morning. I will definitely be making these next week for my Goodie baskets!  Oh I also use more shortening in the melted Chocolate, I found that it made it shiny.

So easy to make and taste just like the ones bought in the store.  Had to refrigerate them to get them to completely harden after dipping in chocolate.  Ended up being a huge hit for Christmas last year and they are on my list to make this year.

I use to make these for family around christmas time but lost my recipe. This was just like mine and was easy to make. i always colored my filling green and instead of dipping the mints into chocolate would drizzle chocolate over them. That was just easier for me.

I'm not a huge PP fan, but my wife is so i figured i would make these for her for a surprise.  Well lets say I love peppermint patties now!!  Everyone loved them, i almost had to beat the kids off with a wooden spoon to keep them from swipping all the dough.

They are great!  This was my first experience dipping anything into chocolate and I think I should have made them thicker and smaller because they began to melt once I dipped them into the chocolate.  So I ended up brushing on the chocolate and they came out good, not professional looking but who cares as long as they taste good and were presentable, but kids and hubby didn't care and loved them.  I ended up freezing them once I put the chocolate coating on and are pulled out of the freezer as they are eaten.  Still gave it five stars because they were delicious.

These are really good. And it makes alot.I used the whole can of milk, put a little more extract [1\2 tsp?] and about a cup or so more sugar. I was doing heaping TBSP's. after awhile to get the right texture. I made mine small, dime size, then flattened. I just let them air dry. By the time I was done making and flattening, and melting chocolate, I started at the beggining of my mints to start dunking, I just dropped one in [so the bottom had chocolate] picked up with a fork, used a spoon to pour choco. on top of mint, then tapped the side of my pan to tap off extra chocolate, dried on parchment paper. Excellent. Will make again.

These were easy and yummy!  My centers dried just right. (Don't make them too thin or they'll fall apart when you pick them up off the waxed paper.)  I had children helping me dip them, so they weren't pretty, but tasted good!  Just don't leave the center in the chocolate pot for long--it melts quickly!

These turned out great.  It was cold out when I made them, in the low 20's so I stuck them outside to dry and chill a little before dipping them.  This worked oput great because it gave them some extra stiffness when dipping them in the chocolate.  I had a hard time getting the chocolate chips to melt so I melted wafer chocolates in a double boiler instead.

My family just loved these. I loved the fact that it was simple to do although a little messy with the chocolate. Great recipe!

I have made these patties three years in a row and still haven't mastered the dipping process. I have tried refrigeration, freezing, letting them harden and still nothing works. They do have a great taste and my mom loves em (shes a mint freak). In fact she's the reason I kept trying, but I have to say, I love you mom, but I'm giving up on this one.

I just was not very pleased with this recipe.  After letting the patties set out they became very dry and the taste was not good at all.  I hope others have better luck with this recipe.  I know,I will not bother with it again.

Yay!  These taste so good!  However, they are such a pain to make!  You must freeze the patties before you dip them, because if you do not, they start to melt and break apart.  Unlike other reviewers, I could not dip them, even after freezing.  Instead, I laid use a butter knife to "frost" them- one side first, and then I went back and did the other side (since the first side had dried by then.)  Also, I used about 1/4 cup less of sugar than called for, and the consistency of the dough before they dried was perfect- they flattened slightly to form perfectly rounded patties- no need for me to bother patting them out.  Also, if you want to cheat, and get the taste without the traditional pattie look, you could always "frost" one side and and leave the other one white, making elegant black and white cookies instead, with the same amazing flavor.

Unbelievably easy.  I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and froze the patties before dipping them.
