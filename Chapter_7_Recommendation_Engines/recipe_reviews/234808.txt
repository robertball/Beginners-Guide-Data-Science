I used cracked wheat berries, 1 C. shredded apple in place of the dried and used 3 T. maple syrup + 1 T. honey in place of sugar. The texture is excellent, crunchy and chewy as expected. The techniques used to cook the grains are spot-on, it came out perfect. I grated a little bit of nutmeg into mine. I will be making this again!

This was fantastic. 
I replaced the cup of oats with a cup of cooked hulled barley.
Replaced the nuts with mixed roasted nuts.
Also, cut the sugar in half.
Cut up a banana instead of the dried apples. Definitely making this again.
