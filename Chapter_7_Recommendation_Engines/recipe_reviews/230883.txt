These were not my families idea of a brownie, they like the traditional fudge, chewy brownie. The flavor was good but not the texture. They decided because of the texture these were chocolate bread. I did make some small alterations. I used half oil, half applesauce and doubled the cocoa powder. The amount of cocoa powder in this recipe is considerably less than other similar brownie recipes and did not seem right.

Loved it! They were so gooey and chewy, although they took a little longer in the oven than I expected. Can't wait to make these again!

These brownies were not at all what I expected. Totally disappointed. Not worth the effort.

These were not my idea of a brownie. I followed this recipe to a tee. The chocolate was very underwhelming. I did have to cook mine approx. 10 minutes longer and they still didn't seem quite done in the middle. It was very sweet.
