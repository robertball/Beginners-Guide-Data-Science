This is a wonderfully rich and moist cake with so many possibilities for "tinkering." Can substitute all or part of the water for coffee, chocolate milk, or any number of liqueurs -- Frangelico, Amaretto, Bailey's, Kahlua, Chambord, etc. Or add a little extract for a different dimension of flavor...peppermint, almond, raspberry, coconut. Top with powdered sugar,  Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site, or drizzle on melted chocolate. Eliminate the chocolate chips, or use different flavored chips. Heck, you could even use a different flavor cake mix or pudding  mix and play with that too! You could make this recipe with so many flavor combinations or variations that you'd never make the same cake twice!

Look no further for an amazing, easy cake recipe! This was by far the most delicious, rich cake I have ever made.
I've made it twice and received rave reviews both times. For an easy chocolate glaze, melt 2 T butter, melt 2/3 cup of chocolate chips, 
mix together with 2T corn syrup and drizzle over the cake. I also used confectioner's sugar on top to pretty it up, and dotted with chocolate mini-morsels.
You've gotta try cake this to believe it.

I changed this recipe to include 1/3 cup of Kahlua instead of the water, which makes it just a little bit more decadent.

This light, rich cake can be completely decadent with a chocolate frosting, or just delicious with a powdered sugar glaze.  I  have made in a 9x13 and just baked for 35-40 minutes, and it comes out beautifully too.

I used less chocolate chips the second time and it came out much less gooey and we ended up liking it a whole lot more. The first time it just seemed way, way too gooey.

This was ok.  It was easy to make, but did not come out as good as I expected.  The inside of the cake was good, but the outside was very hard and crunchy.

Do not wait for the inserted knife or toothpick to come out clean.  With all these chocolate chips....it never will!

I baked this cake for my office, brought the cake in the morning and it was gone before lunch time. I made a slight change, instead of water I used milk and substitute sourcream with plain yogurt. Yet the cake turn out to be very rich and moist.

This is fabulous! Wanted to share my tip for chocolate cakes. Instead of "grease and flour" use "grease and cocoa powder".  It works the same, tastes great and you don't run the risk of having white marks on that lovely chocolate cake

When making this cake, the batter was very thick and had an almost gummy consistency. It was so thick the beaters on my hand held mixer could barely move and the mixer ended up over-heating and turned off! I was tempted to add more liquid because of this but stuck with the recipe as written due to all the good reviews, and the cake turned out delicious. I just wanted to share this for newer bakers like me so no one is put off by the thick batter.

Very good! I make alot of cakes of variation  using cake mixes...thanks to that awesome cake mix doctor!! What a great book! This recipe was very simple, and came out awesome. I added just a cup of chocolate chips and used white chocolate pudding mix as that is what I had on hand. It was delish! I warmed up store bought creamy white chocolate and poured it over the top. YUM YUM! Everyone was raving about this cake - what a chef they kept saying...I will never let them know otherwise!!!

My mother in law has been making this cake for years, under the label of "Death By Chocolate Cake".  When it is done, we always melt some chocolate frosting and drizzle it on.  It is excellent warm from the oven, but personally, I love it best the next day.

I made cupcakes out of this recipe cooked 350 for 20 minutes. These were out of this world! I frosted them with a chocolate mouse frosting.

rich and chocolaty! i used a fudge cake mix and fudge pudding mix. i think i might use butter instead of oil next time for a more brownie-like flavor. at the last minute i decided to portion into cupcakes, and got 24. my kids just devoured these. and even though i'm not a big fan of chocolate cake, these were moist and tasty little morsels. definitely will make them again.

I used chocolate fudge pudding, 1/2 c. of chopped peanuts and chocolate-peanut butter swirl chips.(Using the peanut butter swirl chips insured that I would not wreck my diet and have any--not a fan of peanut butter. LOL.) Easy enough for my kids to help make, came together lickety-split. I whipped up a chocolate ganache and drizzled it over the top. My husband in one night ate 1/3 of the cake, with a little for the boys. Hit! Not only did it give my kids and I something to do, my family loved it. Keeper! NOTE: Want to make it a little less likely for your chocolate chips to sink, toss your chips in a little of the cake mix. Then, gently stir them in. Wa-la.

I have a question - I remember this as a bundt, but I am wondering if anyone has tried it as cupcakes or as 9" round layers? I'd like it to retain it's texture and richness, but in different forms.   My first bf's (late) mom used to make this for us and I loved it! I could not remember her recipe until I saw this, so I will be making it soon. I thought she used actual butter instead of the oil. Does anyone know if it would be the same quantity? And should it be melted? If I knew then what I know now, I'd have hung out in the kitchen with her instead of hanging out with him!

Wonderful chocolate cake! Followed directions exactly, and it was very easy. I used someone else's tip for an easy chocolate glaze: melt 2 T butter, melt 2/3 cup of chocolate chips, mix together with 2T corn syrup and drizzle over the cake. Thanks!

I made this for our church bake sale.  I cooked it in my regular baking pan and then (when it was cool) transferred it to a disposable pan.  I had to cut a sliver off for it to fit, to was able to "sample" it this morning.  Delicious! Moist!  Chocolate chips did not seem to sink to the bottom.  After reading other reviews, I used only 1 cup chocolate chips, and milk instead of water.  The Betty Crocker Devils Food cake mix was a "pudding added" mix; no problems with it (as some others had mentioned).  I baked it in a 9 x 13 pan for 35 to 40 minutes (as another reviewer suggested).  I dusted it with powdered sugar, but the sliver I tasted was good enough not to really need any frosting or topping.  Great recipe!  I will make this again.  I also used parchment paper in the pan.  I let the cake cool on a rack (in the pan) for 10 minutes, then pulled the cake (using the parchment paper) out of the pan onto the rack.  When the cake was completely cooled, I transferred it to the disposable pan, again using the parchment paper to steady the cake.  Using the parchment paper also allows me to skip the grease / flour instructions.

I have made this twice now.  The first time I made it exactly as written - Excellent!  The second time I lightened it up with sugar-free chocolate pudding, light sour cream, half the chocolate chips, and applesauce instead of oil- still Excellent!  The lighter version stayed moist and tasted like a brownie, but not quite sweet enough.  Next time I will add 1/2 c. Splenda.  Thanks for submitting this awesome recipe.

Tasted yummy. I just used cake mix with pudding in it and used chocolate milk instead of water. The chocolate chips sunk to the bottom and stuck to the plate. But, still tasted yummy!

This recipe is so decadent and moist!  This is definitely a keeper.  Here are the substitutions that I made that were still good ~ instead of sour cream I used fat free plain yogurt; instead of oil I used applesauce, and I used Sugar Free/Fat Free Instant Choc. Pudding Mix. The cake was still gooey and chocolaty ~ which is what my guests loved.  On the cooking time I only needed to cook mine for 45 minutes.  (NOTE--I couldn't find 3.9 ounce package of instant chocolate pudding mix so I used one large and one small box.)  For the topping I took the advice of another person and used the recipe for “Satiny Chocolate Glaze”.  This was also good – but if I do that another time I would probably use more white chocolate than it called for and less butter.  After everything cooled I served this with fresh strawberries and a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Enjoy!

Very good! I used only 1 cup of chocolate chips and baked for about 55 minutes. The cake was kind of giggly when it was out of the oven but settled and got a bit harder as it cooled. I poured satin glaze (3/4 cup of chocolate chips, 3 tbsp butter, 1 tbsp light corn syrup, optional 1/4 tsb vanilla) over it and served for a party. Big hit and we ate leftovers the next day VERY happily. :) Will make again if I don't feel like making cake from scratch.

Very good.  I used mint chocolate chips and yogurt instead of sour cream.  My only complaint is it expanded enough that it ran out of my pan.  I was just a little messy in the oven other than that it tasted really good!  This is a very think batter.  Don't let it scare you.  It is still a fluffy cake.

I was looking for a cake recipe that would go well with ice cream and hot fudge kind of like the hot fudge cake that a local restaurant serves. The brownie in the name got me. I didn't quite want a brownie, but didn't quite want a cake either. This worked out perfectly. I used milk chocolate chip instead of semi sweet because I really don't prefer the bitter taste of semi sweet chocolate. I served this fresh out of the oven and topped it with vanilla ice cream and then finished it off with the Hot Fudge Sauce recipe from this site. I highly recommend both recipes. I hope this helps:)

This is THE absolute most wonderful chocolate cake- EVER!  I followed the recipe exactly except that we used a larger box of chocolate pudding.    The cake is incredibly moist and is thicker in texture than a regular cake- making it more like a brownie.  I love the chocolate chips in it.  The cake is simply wonderful and I plan to make it again for a family gathering!

A real winner!  I made this for Christmas Eve dinner and it was a big hit. As someone else suggested, I melted some chocolate frosting for a glaze and topped that with mini chocolate chips.  It looked beautiful on a white plate.  Try this cake, you won't be disappointed!!!!!

I made this for my husband who doesn't like his food too rich and he loved it!  Chocolate lovers will enjoy every morsel!  I drizzled "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" recipe from another user and it worked perfectly!  Thank you for sharing!

Very good recipe though it didnt come out whole when i took it out of the oven. It might have been that i didnt leave it to cool long enough.  Anyway, it tasted great!

WOW!!! This is seriously chocolatey chocolate cake!!!! It's like death by choclate. Which some people (such as my little brother) would like. So I made it for his 8th birthday. And I used about a half a cup of mini chocolate chips in place of the semi-sweet because it was too sweet and gooey when I used the 2 cups of semi-sweet the time before. I also melted some caned chocolate icimg and spooned that over it like a chocolate glaze. That was realy good! I've also tried brushing a clear glaze over it made with powdered sugar,milk and a little vanilla. That tasted great!! This cake took about 5 minutes than the recipe said, but when you stick a knife or a toothpick in it ,it never comes out clean! It's probably because of the chocolat chips. So the best way to tell is to use a butter knife and if the melted chocolate make just streaks on the butter knife it's done. I hope this review is helpful. Try some of these icing ideas!(:
Over all this cake rocked for the serious chocolate eaters.

I made this cake into cupcakes for Halloween and they were perfect.  The cupcakes are deep, dark,and rich in both chocolate flavor and color.  They are perfectly moist and baked up beautifully.  I have made about 6 dozen cupcakes for this holiday so far, and these have been the favorites.  Can't wait to try it as a cake, also.

I've been making this for a few years now.  Haven't meet a single person yet who doesn't love it.  I usually follow the ingredients to the 'T', but the way I prepare it - just throw all ingredients (minus chocolate chips) in a bowl together, then mix, then add the chocolate chips and throw it in the oven.  Comes out perfect every time!!!

This cake is awesome! I was ready for it to be dry, but it is moist and oh so flavorful! The first time I made it I didn't have chocolate pudding so I used vanilla and it was still great. I made today with chocolate pudding and waiting for the results when it cools...I frosted with a chocolate glaze. Do not hesitate...its easy and I think the sour cream is what makes this so yummy and moist!

This cake was amazing. I used some changes from other reviews. The most important one is to find a cake mix without the pudding already in it, which was actually hard. Duncan Hines was the only brand I could find. I added a tsp of vanilla and used half the chocolate chips that were called for. I drizzled the cake with white buter cream frosting and also melted some semisweet chocolate, dipped some fresh strawberries for the garnish.

I actually have made this recipe before, it was titled Chocolate Chocolate Chip Cake.  I like to call it BonBon Cake because it is GOOD GOOD!!  I have also used a white cake mix, vanilla pudding and butterscotch chips, but you have to be sure to coat the butterscotch chips with flour as they sink to the bottom of the pan!

Cake is VERY good! Extremely easy to make. The only thing I changed was I added only about 3/4 to a cup of white chocolate chips. My husband has a massive sweet tooth and ate this in about three days. I made the cake a few weeks later replacing the chocolate pudding with french vanilla, which I recommend just sticking with the chocolate. As for icing, all I did was melt some regular store bought icing in the microwave for a few seconds and drizzled it over the cake. I highly recommend this cake for a transition into beginning baking. I can't wait for the holidays when I make this, thinking about doing green frosting and crushed candy canes topping!

I made this in September for my boyfriend's birthday and it turned out excellent - as you can see in my picture, I decorated it with chocolate syrup and walnuts in syrup ice cream topping, as these are sticky and will stay put! (just be careful to let them drip a bit before placing them on the cake, as the syrup they're in will run...unless of course you like that!) The only thing I would tweak the next time would be to omit 1/2 cup of the choc chips...I think that took the cake juuuuust over the "too rich" threshold...Either way, thanks for a great recipe!

This is a delicious cake recipe.  The only thing I changed was the yogurt.  I did not have plain yogurt on hand, so I used a container of Yoplait Boston Creme Pie flavored yogurt.  It was amazing!

This is by far the best chocolate cake I've ever had or made! I am usually a stickler for making everything from scratch so when a friend of mine made this and I asked for the recipe I was shocked to find out it was a cake mix. I usually make mine for a holiday treat and add a little mint extract to the chocolate glaze....tastes like a peppermint patty!

Out of this world! I used 1 1/4 cups of mini chips and 1 c. of chopped walnuts. I thought my husband was having a seizure he loved this sooo much. I drizzled the whole thing with melted white chocolate and served warm with vanilla bean ice cream. Perfect after a cook out!

I've made this as a Bundt cake and as cupcakes. It's best to simply follow the "box" bake time vs trying to use a toothpick to test. (Bundt will usually take 50 to 60 minutes.) I've learned to limit chips to one cup for perfect, moist consistency. Easy as "box cake" to make and tastes like I spent all afternoon. Rave reviews from friends every time.

Made exactly as stated except I used 1/4 cup veg oil and 1/4 butter (for a more brownie like consistency) and light sour cream.  I made these into cupcakes- baked in paper liners at 350 for 18 minutes- perfection.  I ended up with 27 perfectly sized cupcakes.  I stirred the choc chips with a little dry cake mix before mixing in to keep them from sinking to the bottom- not sure it was necessary but they sure didn't sink so I will probably do that again.  I am so glad I didn't cut the choc chips in half because they were great in these!  Warning- the batter does get very thick and having to mix it for 4 minutes ended up blowing out my mixer!  UGH!  I guess it was worth it because these were just so tasty.  I frosted them with Rich Chocolate Frosting from this site and will do the same again next time.  Best served cold.

I frosted this cake with chocolate mouse.  It was heavenly!  I also made this in a 9 inch spring form pan and lowered the oven temp to 325 and cooked it for about an hour until set.  Turned out great and beautiful presentation

How is it that I haven't commented on this yet?! My dear friend, Debi, introduced me to this cake a few years ago and it's one of my absolute favorites!  Have made it in my 9 x 13 pan as well as bundt; I'll make it into cupcakes one of these days.  AMAZING chocolate cake!!!!!

This recipe was easy and delicious. The only change I made was I used a half cup of strong coffee instead of water. I also used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze recipe from this site. It doesn't get any better than this!!!

You'll need flour to "grease & flour the pan," too!  THIS IS DELICIOUS! I'm not a huge fan of chocolate cakes, but my boyfriend had a taste for one and this recipe probably made the best chocolate cake I've ever eaten in my life! I couldn't afford a Bundt cake pan at the time, so I bought 2 medium sized 9-inch disposable casserole pans from Walmart for $2. This ended up working even better because I was able to make him a cake and I have one to take home to my mom tomorrow! I used a Duncan Hines Devil's Food Cake mix and I topped it with Betty Crocker Triple Chocolate Fudge Chip Frosting and it is delicious!!!! I'll never make another chocolate cake again! And it was pretty inexpensive, too--I spent about $9 on everything except the vegetable oil since I already had some here.

I would recommend this cake to any chocolate lover!  It was so delicious and rich.  The only change I made was to top it with Tunisianswife's "Easy Chocolate Bundt Cake Glaze."  It was such a hit that it is being requested at every family get-together!  A definite must try!!

This cake was good. With all the great reviews you  would think it was out of this world and it really wasn't. Good cake but it is was it is. A boxed cake mix doctored up. I did replace the chocolate chips for peanut butter chips and glazed it with peanut butter glaze from this site. That glaze is what made the cake.

This cake is amazing! I actually substituted all of the sour cream (lactose intolerant) and half the oil for applesauce, and it turned out wonderful! No one could even tell there was any applesauce, and it was soooo rich. I used a chocolate glaze recipe from allrecipes also over the top. I did not have a bundt pan, but worked well in a 9 by 13.

Ooh la la! So good!!! Made this as a "welcome home" treat for my fiance (he was gone all last week on business). He liked it, so I'm happy. :) This is basically a slight variation of Susan Feiler's Chocolate Lovers' Favorite Cake. The main differences are that Susan's version calls for all butter instead of oil/water, uses 1 cup less sour cream, 1 additional egg and extract. I must admit, I like ECHOSZERO's cake much better! If you want a comparison, think of a molten chocolate cake (but be sure to serve warm for the AWESOME effect!). Served (warm) with a drizzle of caramel sauce and a scoop of fudge ripple ice cream, this was DECADENT and reminded me of the cake Ruths Chris Steak House serves for $10!!! I've snuck a piece of this each night so far this week lol! I really didn't find that I needed to make any alterations, other than substituting chocolate fudge pudding for plain chocolate (just my preference) and I did add ~ 2 T of reserved cake mix to my chocolate chips to help prevent them from sinking to the bottom on my bundt pan (thank's for the idea Lambchop!). I can't WAIT to try this with  mint, peanut butter or raspberry baking chips or maybe even with Kahlua, Amaretto or Chambord... yum, yum! Heck, I think I'll try using individual bundt pans for my next dinner party (why not???). Thanks for sharing! This will forever be my weak indulgence. :-)

I don't like to leave a negative review, but I have very mixed emotions about this cake.  The actual texture was wonderful, light and airy but it was the taste that I was not impressed with it at all.  All I could taste was the oil which also left a terrible aftertaste.  Don't think I will be making this again, if I do it will need some serious tweaking!!

Very good. Will probably use fudge cake mix next time instead of the dark chocolate I used this time. Made exactly as stated, except used half the amount of choc chips and used the mini ones like someone else suggested. Cooked for 50 min. It was very thick when mixing which took a little extra time, but it was worth it. Will make again.

Wonderful cake!  Very moist and over the top chocolate!  I only used 1 cup of chocolate chips.  I think 2 cups would have been way too much.

Awesome. Doesn't need a thing. Next time I will try greasing the pan with the baking spray with flour instead of greasing and flouring the bundt pan. After turning out the cake there was a residue from the grease and flour on the surface of the dark cake. The cake is so good by itself I don't want to frost it just to cover a cosmetic problem.

YUM!!! I made this today for a family barbeque and everyone loved it! I served it with a simple glaze of powdered sugar and water. Since I was short on cooking time, I increased the oven temp to 365 degrees and took it out of the oven at 45 minutes. It had plenty of time to cool and was super moist and delicious! Thanks for a simple and delicious recipe!

Really good and easy, stays moist for days.  Is very close to cake like brownies.  I decreased chips to 1.5 cups and did not use any glaze but next time will try a glaze.

WOW...very, very good.  The only chocolate cake I will chose to make from now on.  I like easy, and I would even do this rather than JUST a box mix.  Excellent with 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips.

My husband really liked this cake, and said it did taste like brownies.  I will definately make it again, since my brownies never seem to set.  This is also a very pretty cake, I sprinkled powdered sugar on mine and a few people thought it was store bought!

This cake is delicious!  It is so easy.  I usually can tell a cake mix cake, but this would have stumped me.  It is very moist.  I made it for my Bunco Group and they (and my hubby) loved it!

I use Sugar Free Chocolate Pudding, Greek Yogurt, and 1 cup strong brewed coffee in place of some of the cake ingredients and I use Sugar Free Chocolate Frosting to frost cake....you can also substitute Sugar Free Chocolate Cake Mix in place of the regular one.   The cake still turns out very rich and moist.

I was skeptical about this recipe since it use cake mix but after reading all the  reviews I decided to give it a try...and I regret it.  I always prepare my cake from scratch and now I remember why.

I make this cake all the time! Got the recipe out of my Cake Doctor Cook Book. I also do many variations with this recipe using other cake mixes and puddings that would match the cake. Lemon cake mix zest of 1 lemon and Lemon pudding make a great lemon pound cake minus the choc chips of course and when it comes out of the oven I squeeze fresh lemon juice of half a lemon and let it cool completely and dust it with powdered sugar.

Excellent cake! I originally made this for a social at work, but after my sons tasted it, they requested it for their special birthday cakes! So easy, moist, and chocolately. Definitely a keeper to make again & again!

I left out pudding because my cake already had it and used coffee for the 1/2 of water. I also used regular chocolate chips because that is what I had on hand.  Mine was done in 38 mins! Best the 2nd day or longer.

I tested 4 chocolate cake recipes with similar ingredients at the same time and this cake was one of the better ones. I also recommend the Too Much Chocolate Cake recipe. And the Chocolate Lovers Favorite Cake recipe if you like a hint of almond flavor. I sprinkle my chocolate cakes with powdered sugar after it has cooled, no need for frosting.

I love this cake!  I have used triple chocolate chip and dark chocolate mixes and frostings with this cake and it is wonderful and dark.  I also put a white chocolate drizzle on the top which makes an exceptional showing for this cake.

Too Much Chocolate Cake on this site has the SAME recipe but ADDS 1/2 CUP MORE OF OIL AND 5.9 oz chocolate pudding. That recipe has over 1500 5 star reviews-Maybe the extra's help.

This was pretty good.  I made it in a silicone bundt pan and it took longer to bake and may have over baked a little. I did not want to do that (over bake it) but it didn't seem done.  I made the satiny chocolate glaze and I think that really made it! It looked very presentable too! It was moist and very chocolaty.  I used mini choc. chips. I am a frosting or icing girl so that's the reason for 4 stars I definitely recommend the choc. satiny glaze !    Thanks

Very chocolatey & good.  Glazed with Satiny Chocolate Glaze on top and skim coated sides with the glaze. Then added almond slivers on top of the cake. Looked like a professionally made cake.

Amazingly moist cake with a full, rich flavour.  I used Devil's Food cake mix and pistachio pudding mix--turned into a yummy chocolately and nutty combo!  I baked it in a 9x13 baking dish (because I don't own a Bundt pan) for 35 min and it was cooked perfectly.  Instead of frosting the cake I drizzled it with a caramel sauce recipe I got from this site. I can't wait to make it again and experiment with other cake mix and pudding flavours!

This was a fun recipe!  I put white chocolate chips and peanut butter chips in it instead of the chocolate chips and it was great!  I also frosted it with melted white chocolate.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

WOW! I made this for my mother's 40th birthday and everyone could not get enough of this cake! I got compliments all throughout the night, people wanted to take slices home and everyone wanted seconds and thirds. This is a cake that can sell! The chocolate chips don't melt at all in the cake and it tastes just like a brownie cake. Instead of icing I used melted chocolate chips on the top and drizzled it with Hersheys chocolate syrup. Beautiful and delicious. I will keep this recipe for a very long time.

Excellent recipe! Baked as two 9" rounds about 35 minutes.  I used strong coffee in place of the water.  Per other reviewers I only added 1 cup mini chocolate chips. I frosted this (it was a birthday cake for my daughter) with chocolate coffee buttercream frosting.  Gone by the next day.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This cake is amazing! If your craving chocolate, make this! It's very rich so you won't need a very big piece. It even good without a whole lot of icing. Powder sugar would work just fine. I will make it again. I might even serve it with some fresh strawberries. Skies the limited on the variations you can do. From different cake flavors, different flavored chips, to different instant pudding or put extracts in too.

This was a great cake.  It had the texture more like a chocolate pound cake.  I used espresso shots instead of the water, fat free sourcream, and sugar free pudding.  I took it to work and ALL my partners LOVED it!!

This cake was a hit. I made it for Christmas. I had to leave dinner to catch a plane (I ate a piece of cake though, and it was moist and chocolaty), but my sister told me it got rave reviews. Even my little nephew who doesn't like chocolate ate the cake. She told me the cake was eaten up when I asked her about it another day. I didn't have sour cream, so I used a substitute I found on the web that used buttermilk and butter (sorry I can't remember it exactly at this moment). And as always with baked goods, I added plenty of vanilla! I don't think I added 2 cups of chocolate chips though, but the cake was chocolaty enough. I also made like a ganache topping for the cake. I will make this cake again.

This was fantastic! I had to make it 9X13 because I took this into work for easter. I also used half the chocolate chips (personal preference). I topped it with chocolate icing. My coworkers are very picky eaters and this was gone in less than seven minutes. I already have several requests to make this again!

Used chocolate fudge pudding, canola oil rather than vegetable oil (more neutral taste), brewed coffee instead of water, 1 cup semisweet and 1 cup milk chocolate chips, and added hazelnut and vanilla extracts just before stirring in the chips. Greased my bundt pan with shortening, sifted 1 cup flour with 1 cup cocoa, and used this to dust the greased pan. Let the cake cool in the pan a full hour before trying to unmold. Popped out intact and with a beautiful dark color, no white residue. Took longer to bake (about 70 minutes), oven temp was correct per my thermometer. Will melt the chips next time before adding, didn't care for the lumps that much. Will report back how this works. Very rich cake!12/29/07 UPDATE: Melting chips produced a finer cake, but now I am wondering if a can of chocolate syrup wouldn't work just as well.

Sorry, I really wanted to like it, tried it again the next day, but unfortunately, it just still was no where near the reviews for me.  My husband (said) he liked it, that is why I have it the 3 stars.

Excellent. Everyone here loved it.
I halved the recipe and made it in an 8 in cake pan and baked for 30 min.
I also made some low fat changes: I used fat free plain yogurt instead of sour cream and apple sauce instead of oil.  It worked great.

This cake was FABULOUS just as it is written. I was surprised at how fluffy it got after mixing. It really made for a moist and fluffy cake. I loved the gooey chocolate chips... it was delicious served warm-- only because we couldn't wait to eat it! We just melted 2 Tbsp. bittersweet chocolate with 1 Tbsp. butter and drizzled that over the top. Chocolate perfection!

This is a very good cake!! I only had Vanilla pudding mix so I used it as well as only 1 1/2 cups of Chocolate chips and it still came out great. It does require the full hour to bake and I allowed it to cool in the pan for almost 30 min. I made this Sun. and today is Wed. and the 1 slice that is left is still moist. It slices nice and held together well for the lunch boxes. Great with a side of Vanilla icecream or a big glass of milk.

Super chocolatey, rich and gooy.  Used egg beaters (always do), light sour cream and light butter (what I had) and it was almost too rich.  Baked beautifully in 54 minutes and topped with Satiny Chocolate Glaze.  We all said it was too rich but kept eating away.  Definitely a special occasion cake for a chocoholic.

This cake was very good. I only used 1 cup of chocolate chips, and I use 1/4 cup of kahlua and 1/4 cup of water instead of 1/2 cup water. I drizzled it with Kahlua glaze (2 cups confectioners sugar, 2 tbs Kahlua, 2 tbs water), and covered it with Heath toffee bits. It was delicious and I got many compliments.

Very yummy. Nice and moist and fairly easy to prepare.  I made this for Mother's day, and it was eaten by everyone, they really seemed to like it.  The top brownie layer is crunchy so it gives the cake a nice variety.  I used just plain chocolate frosting from the store and it was still awesome.  I plan on making it again in a week.

Not impressed. Followed recipe exactly and the cake was no better than preparing cake mix as usual. Only difference was that it was a little dry and not as tender.

Rich and decadent - chocolate yumminess in every bite!!  I only had a chocolate fudge cake mix (not the devil's food cake called for), but I know you could easily switch up the pudding mix, chocolate chips to vary your cake based on what flavour you want!  Regardless, it was divine!  I used Peanut Butter Glaze from this site to drizzle over top and it was SUPERB!

What a HUGE success. I fixed as stated and there was not a piece left. I was amazed at how this cake tasted. My husband looked at it and said "You didn't make that". He was shocked that I could make something that looked as beautiful as that cake did. I think he learned not to doubt my cooking techniques.

I made this for a co-workers birthday and it turned out fantastic. I did not have sour cream so I just omitted it. I did use 1 1/4 cup of milk instead of the water and sour cream. I also put the satiny chocolate glaze on it and it gobbled up. It is quite like the bundt cake you buy at Costco. Also, heads up there is this exact recipe on the side of a duncan hines devil's food cake box!

Wow!  This was a great big hit.  As another reviewer's suggestion, I used the shiny chocolate glaze, which was perfect.  I roasted pecans, chopped and sprinkled on top. Instead of using water in the cake mix, I used coffee and I also put a little instant coffee in the glaze.  It was absolutely delicious.  I brought some into work today and they all went crazy (even though it was almost 3 days old...it was still yummy).  Thank you for this recipe!

This is very good - very moist and brownie-like. I followed the recipe, except used 1-1/2 cups mini chips instead of 2c regular and vanilla pudding instead of chocolate, which turned out fine. I topped it with caramel, chocolate ganache, and chopped macadamias. Excellent! Thanks for the recipe!

Easy & decadent!  Very rich, and definitely needs a big scoop of ice cream with it.  Make sure you serve this slightly warm (microwave each slice for 15 secs) so the chocolate chips are gooey. 2nd time I used 1/2 c of milk in place of water, turned out fabulous.

Too bad we can only pick 5 stars to rate this.. my family gave it 100 out of 10!  It is so rich and decadent.  Needs no icing, just a bit of vanilla ice cream.  A definite repeat in my house.

A very rich chocolate taste.  I topped the cake with 'Satiny Chocolate Glaze' from this site and additional chocolate chips.  My cake was a bit dryer than I usually like (I baked 50 minutes).  Next time I will shave 5 minutes off the bake time.  I think this recipe would make great double chocolate muffins.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!! It is fabulous. I have made it several times and now people specifically request it. I am quickly turning into the baker in my family =) Its so moist and the amount of chocolate is perfect. Anytime I require a chocolate recipe I use this one...cupcakes, bundt cakes, layered cakes. Superb!

Worked great as cupcakes...made 33.  You only need to fill the cups about halfway.  I didn't use but about 1 cup of chocolate chips.

This is an excellent, moist cake...Instead of oil, I substitute applesauce...cutting the fat, but makes it just as moist.

This cake was so yummy! I did add a glaze. I microwaved vanilla frost for about 15 seconds and drizzled it over the cake( got the hit from the cake box). It turn out great.

I love this cake!!! It was so easy to make and very tasty.  I have to warn everyone that it is very very chocolately, but no too sweet.  Will definitely bake again.

This tastes like a creamy brownie.  I loved this cake and my rediculously picky family loved it too.  I dusted the top with powdered sugar to enhance the appearance.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this along with Amy's Marvelous Marbled Cheesecake for my sorority sisters and their dates for our Valentine's Day Philanthropy Event. It was beyond fantastic! Many people asked for the recipe!  It made the event that much better and my time and effort worth it! I made sure to give credit to you on the printouts I made for them :) Thanks for sharing!

Just baked this cake to take for thanksgiving dinner and it looks wonderful.  I tasted the batter and it was awesome good and I tasted a few crumbs from the cake and it was rich and moist and chocolatey.  Mind you, I'm not a girl crazy about chocolate cake.  I did this at my family's request.  These are the adjustments I made based on the suggestions from the reviews:
1. Duncan Hines devil's food cake mix
2. Exact amount of pudding mix and eggs
3. Light sour cream
4. 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup melted pure butter
5. Chocolate milk (whole milk) instead of water
6. 1 cup of mini chocolate chips instead of 2 cups
7. 1/2 tsp almond flavor
8.  Stir chips in a little bit of the cake mix to prevent chips from sinking
9.  Dust cocoa powder in pan
10. Since I only had a small bundt pan, I used part of the batter to make 5 cupcakes and the rest of the batter in the bundt pan so that the batter would not spill over.
11.  Cupcakes were done in about 20 minutes
12.  Cake was done in about 50 minutes
13.  I cooked in a 325 degree oven
The house smells like the holidays and I can't wait to slice it up after dinner.  Enjoy!

I made this as instructed, and topped it with homemade dobash frosting. It was great, but better the next day. Next time, I'll do as others suggest and substitute the water for coffee or other flavoring.

This is a quick and simple chocolate cake that is delightful.  It had good texture, very moist and everyone enjoyed it. I made this into four small bundt cakes and dusted with powdered sugar.  Next time, I plan to use left over coffee instead of the water to enhance the chocolate flavor.

Yummy! Easy but really thick to mix. I didn't have chocolate chips so I took the advice of another review and added 1 cup peanut butter chips. I put a white buttery almond drizzle on when still a little warm. We loved it! It didn't look like the picture though....

This is my wife's new favorite cake. I read other reviews for this recipe and cut down on chocolate chips (which seems like a sin against humanity) to 1 and 1/3 cup and couldn't have been more pleased. So easy, even my 5 year old son helped.

Very good recipe. One can do so many things with this. Peanut butter or raspberry or white chocolate chips. I went with a dark chocolate morsel with a dark chocolate fudge box cake mix. Iced it with dark chocolate icing. Cake turned out good. It got way better after setting for many hours. Gooey, but not sickening sweet. Thanks for a wonderful recipe for chocolate cake !!

I did not care for this recipe. Not only does this not taste as good as it looks, its actually a lot dryer than expected despite making it a second time and adding an extra 1/4 cup of oil and 1/4 cup of sour cream. Would not make again.

Great cake!!!! Just dumped everything in and cooked for 50 minutes.  Perfect.  I heated up canned icing and drizzled over cake.  Wonderful with vanilla ice cream.  Next time I'll try it with peanut butter chips like one reviewer stated

This cake was AWESOME!  My fiance was an ice cream cake for his birthday and I wasn't sure what kind of cake would do well in the freezer - I'm so glad I took a shot with this one!  I used devil's food cake and devil's food pudding mix and traded peanut butter chips for the chocolate chips.  I baked this in two 8" layer pans and it took about 35 minutes.  I spread a layer of softened vanilla ice cream between the cakes after they were completely cooled and then frosted the whole thing with Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting and decorated it with mini Reese's cups.  Very decadent, but my fiance absolutely loved it and the cake didn't get dry or rock hard in the freezer!

Pretty good cake...I used only a cup of chocolate chips and dusted it with powdered sugar when it cooled.  I used chocolate fudge cake mix because that's what I had in the cupboard.

I used mini chocolate chips thinking that they would melt into the cake but that didn't happen.  I actually only had 1 1/2 cups of mini so I had to use some regular.  I got rave reviews from my family but I think I would cut down the amount of chips by half.  I used sugar free pudding (the larger one) because that's what I had.

I added a few tablespoons of Chambord which gave this cake a subtle raspberry flavor.  Cake was amazing!!!

Hands down, my favorite chocolate cake of all time!!! I made this for my wonderful Mother-in-love for her birthday, she loved it, took the rest of the cake home with her. I thought my husband was going to trip her to get it back. I will make him one of his own. Extremely easy to make.

I love this cake and so does everybody I serve it to.  I get comments from people who don't even like chocolate that they love this cake.  I use chocolate fudge cake mix and put it in a 9x13 inch pan and ice it with fudgey frosting. YUM!!!  Also, I don't always add choc. chips.  So moist and so good!!!

I made this recipe for a dinner party on Saturday night. It was big hit, especially with my husband! The batter is quite thick when it's mixing but don't worry.... it tastes double chocolate YUMMY. Thanks for sharing.

Fabulous, moist, delicious and decadent. I added half the amount of chips and drizzled melted vanilla frosting over the top,then topped it with colorful sprinkles and it was a hit!  I loved the way the top got a bit hard like a brownie or muffin top...This is a definite keeper!

I was a little skeptical since I am not a chocolate cake lover, but this cake is FANTASTIC!  Very moist and chocolatey without being overly sweet.  As the name implies, it reminds me of a gooey brownie.  I added the glaze that another reviewer suggested and the whole family gobbled it up!

This was very good, but not really worth the calories to me.
I used a swiss chocolate cake mix because it was all that I had, perhaps using a devils food cake mix would make it more rich and chocolatey. At 50 minutes it was still quite gooey so I left it in for another then and it was very fluffy and not gooey at all at that point.
I expected a dense cake and this was very fluffy and spongey. I also cut back the chocolate chips to one cup, then added a glaze with 2/3 cup melted chocolate chips with 2 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons corn syrup.

So good and I didn't find gooey at all.  I used a peppermint glaze with crushed candy canes on top.  Looked fantastic and tasted like a peppermint patty.

Very moist, very rich, excellent for that sweet tooth!!  I followed it exactly and turned out wonderful.  I baked it for 55 minutes but next time I am going to cut 5 minutes from the baking time.  The only reason being, the outside of the cake was a little more crunchy than I would have liked but I did not put any icing on it.  If I had iced it I am sure that would not have been so crisp.  It did not overall affect the end product, it was just a preference of mine.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

When I decided to try this cake I realized I only had a German choc. cake mix and white chocolate instant pudding. Guess what, it worked beautifully and a bit lighter than devils food.   I am not a big chocolate lover but our friends are.

This is by far the best chocolate cake I've ever made or even had.  I get requests for it all the time.  It's very similar to Creative Cakery Cakes especially if you top it with slightly melted store bought cream cheese frosting.  Wow!  I am making it today for my daughters 2nd birthday.  If you like chocolate this is the cake for you!

Fantastic cake!!  I used non-fat sour cream because it's what I had, but I don't think it made a difference.  I also topped it with powdered sugar.  Yummy!!!

This is a good cake. I drizzled store bought vanilla frosting on top and filled the center of the bundt cake with strawberries. I wasn't fond of it the first day because I thought it was too rich but I put it in the refrigerator and the next day it was great. Even my husband, who is not a chocolate lover, liked it.

This is the best chocolate cake I have ever had. I don't bake much and this was my first experience with a bundt pan but it came out amazing. I have made this cake twice and used milk chocolate the second time. My family like it better that way, it was less rich. Another tip it taste even better the next day. This one will go in the recipe box as a keeper.

This recipe is absolutely amazing. I made if for my family and they LOVED it. It is very intense and extremely rich. It has the most chocolate per square inch of any cake we've ever had. Kudos and thanks for sharing.

This is the old triple chocolate cake recipe, which has so many variations. You can sub a liqueur or coffee for the water and vary the chips. I have used mint chocolate and chocolate raspberry chips. Adding in other ingredients does help take away that boxed mix taste, but this is still just a box mix. There are so many simple one-bowl cake recipes that produce a deep, rich, moist cake that you don't even need to bother with a mix.

Very quick and easy, however, I didn't think it had the brownie taste many people talked about, but still very delicious and very chocolately.  It was a bit gooey inside, but I think that's cause we cut it about 45 minutes after it came out of the oven.  I also baked it for just over a hour.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this cake for my coworker's birthday, and everyone absolutely loved it!  I drizzled chocolate syrup on the top of the cake and then sprinkled powdered sugar on top to dress it up a bit.  I will definitely make this cake again and may substitute white chocolate or peanut butter chips for the chocolate chips.  Thanks again for the recipe!

I brought this to a BBQ over the weekend and received rave reviews!  Definitely a must-try for the chocolate lover.  I followed the recipe exactly (it was easy and turned out perfect) and glazed the cake with a glaze of semi-sweet chocolate, butter, and light corn syrup - but it would have been fine with no glaze or icing of any sort.  It was moist, delicious, and decadent - I will be bringing this to many a potluck, picnic and party!

I followed the recipe and cake came out nice and moist and very tasty!  Only change was that I used cocoa powder instead of flour in preparing the Bundt pan.

Wow was this cake delicious!  It was so chocolaty and moist.  I brought it to a BBQ happy hour.  I had so many compliments.  One correction would be that cake mixes do not come in 18.25 oz.  Just pick up one of the 15.25 standard boxes and 1 small package of the pudding mix.  Can you just imagine this with French vanilla ice cream

I have made this many times. People love it. It is so moist. I have changed it up using lemon cake mix and lemon pie filling it tastes so fresh. I also used lemon chips. If you can’t get them use vanilla chips..

This cake is so good!!  My whole family loved it!!  I made this with kahlua instead of water and I sprinkled powdered sugar on top.  I also made this in a 13 x 9 pan instead of as a bundt cake and baked it for 41 minuets. This cake was so moist and so delicious!!  I will definitely be making this again!!

Made exactly as written except I cooked it for a few minutes less. It was moist, dense and wonderful! My coffee gang loved it! I did use Chocolate Ganache for topping from this site. Simple & delicious.
 
The ganache recipe, the only thing different was, used semi 
9 oz. semi sweet chocolate. Don't like bitter chocolate.Did not use the optional liquor in the cake mix part. Quick & easy topping & excellent!

I've made this cake several times and call it my famous chocolate cake! I bake it in a spring form pan, and when it's done baking I remove the outer ring of the pan, let it cool for 5-10 minutes, then start putting chocolate fudge icing on it. I do it while it's still warm so the icing gets melty and drippy and easy to spread. Once covered I put it right in the fridge so the icing hardens. When it's fully chilled after a few hours the cake looks like a giant thin mint! It is incredibly moist and rich, and the best chocolate cake I think I've ever had. I've also used gluten free cake mix with success, you almost couldn't tell it wasn't the same. But that might depend on the brand of mix you buy. Highly recommended!

I also used coffee instead of water and chocolate fudge pudding..I used 1 1/2 cups of p.butter choc. Chips. Layered the cake mix then chips then cake mix then more chips on top of cake. Then added powered conf sugar on top..Easter dinner dessert. Everyone loved it right of the oven n as leftover...

Baked for 50 min. I did add two packages of instant pudding since it was 3.9 oz and it was the dense consistency of a brownie and so delicious! Topped it with chocolate buttercream frosting for a birthday cake

I use chocolate fudge cake mix and chocolate fudge pudding. Also I use 3/4 cup oil. For me what works best is I pour half the batter in sprayed bundt pan, then sprinkle a good milk chocolate chips (like ghiaradeli? all around the center on top of batter and top with rest of batter. I microwave a small ch. fudge frosting for about 25 seconds then drizzle over cooled cake. When I bring this to any party or function it is a big hit! Thanks ....try it once....you'll taste for yourself!! Yum!

I made this cake after searching for a "brownie cake" at the request of my sister for her birthday.The whole family devoured it and raved about how it was the best cake they have ever had. And get this, I didnt have time to make an icing, so I simple topped it with cool whip before serving. Its that good! I did NOT have a priblem with choc chips sinking, so just follow the directions as listed and you shouldnt either. Its simply divine! I promise! Oh and the only modification was I used coconut oil in place
 of veg oil. Better tasting and much healthier.

This is the same recipe that is in The Cake Doctor (it's called Darn Good Chocolate Cake).  The only difference is she says to bake for only 45-50 min.  Mine took 48, any longer and it would be dry.  I used a simple sugar glaze on top.  I also used 1/2 c. sour cream and 1/2 c. soy milk and only 1 c. chocolate chips.  It was delicious.

I have been making this cake for the last year or so with RAVE reviews from anyone who tastes it. It is great with only one cup chips, and frosted with store bought chocolate as soon as it is done, then served warm!

I have been using this recipe for a couple years now and it never fails to please a crowd!  I recenly used it for birthday cupcakes and swirled them with ganache frosting, they were divine!  I baked them for 25 minutes and they came out perfectly.

I substituted about 1/3 cup applesauce for the oil. I also used a tube pan and sprinkled about 3/4 cup of milk chocolate chips on top as well as 1/4 cup toffee-chocolate chips. Baked for 50 minutes it had great texture. I will also try it topped with coconut for a "mounds" experience.

My husband's favorite now! I used 1/2 mint chocolate chips, and that was just right. I only baked it 50 minutes and it was just right. Topped with some powdered sugar and then the "Satiny Chocolate Glaze."

Even though I followed the instructions exactly, I found this cake to be uninspired at best. The texture was extremely dense, and the cake had a certain 'artificial' aftertaste....even though I used high-quality Duncan Hines mix and Jello brand pudding.
Although the glaze was good, the cake seemed like it needed something lighter to break up the overpowering chocolate and very heavy texture. IF I was ever to make it again (which I would NOT) I'd do it as a layer cake with a mousse frosting or something light between the layers. Next time, I'd rather just make a pan of delicious brownies!

This was so yummy it was ridiculous.  Everyone loved it.  I smothered it in a chocolate chocolate chip frosting.  One of my guests called the next day and said she wishes she had taken me up on sending a piece home with her.  She found herself craving the cake in the middle of the night!

I made this for company over the weekend and it was a hit!  I used a plain chocolate cake mix rather than the devil's cake mix and still turned out moist and delicous and was great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!

My husband loves chocolate and it's tough to find something rich enough to satisfy his sweet tooth. This cake sure takes care of that problem. He likes the wedding cake icing on the cake, but the kids and I like it with no icing. This is also great served warm with vanilla ice cream.

Great recipe, very chocolate-y and very easy to make.  I bought the pourable frosting and poured it over when it was done and cooled a little.  Everyone loved it.  Thank you!

Very easy and good. Sometimes I don't add the morsels but instead melt them, along with a little butter and powdered sugar, and make a glaze for the top. This is always a good standby recipe when you need a dessert quickly; most ingredients are on hand. Also, for next day enjoyment I like to heat my slice up just  a tad in the microwave to soften the morsels. Yum!

This cake is a chocolate lovers dream!  I made a lighter version by substituting applesauce for half of the oil and egg beaters for half of the eggs.  I also used fat free sour cream.  It was very moist and very yummy!

I made this for my husband's birthday party.  The 2 cups of choc chips make it very moist.  I used a canned cream cheese frosting.  Everyone loved it and a couple people asked for the recipe.  I'll definitely make this again!!

I just tried this cake yesterday - wonderful!  It is very moist and not too rich.  I am not wild about too much chocolate in a chocolate cake, so I used mini chocolate chips and only put in abut 1 cup.  Everyone loved this cake.  Simple and delicious!

thought this cake was awesome.  my husband loved it and asked if i would make it again.  if you have a craving for chocolate this cake will do it.  The only thing i did differently was to use a 12 cup pan instead of a 10.  it worked just fine.

Very rich, fabulous cake. I put a few chocolates (Frango and Hershey's Kisses/Hugs) in the warm cake and it was a nice touch. No need for frosting.

Wow - chocolately and moist.  Yum!  Very similiar to Chocolate Lovers Cake on this site.  Both are definite 5 start recipes.  I used the Chocolate Glaze I recipe on this site to drizzle over the cake - perfect touch.

This cake was very moist.  I was expecting it to have more of a brownie texture, but it's just a very chocolatey cake.  It was very good anyhow.

This is our new favorite chocolate cake! Easy to whip up, too. I followed the recipe exactly, using mini-morsels and baking the entire 60 minutes.  Super moist the next day, never gooey. I would take this cake anywhere!

I made this twice in one week.  My whole family loved it!  I recommend drizzling the cake with chocolate syrup and heating it up.  A scoop of vanilla ice cream and it's perfect.
