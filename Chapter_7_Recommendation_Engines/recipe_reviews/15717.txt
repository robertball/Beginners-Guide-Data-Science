Be sure to leave this dip to chill, so that the flavors will blend. It's not half as good if you don't!

What a great dip! It was the hit of the party. Everyone wanted the recipe. Easy to make. The other reviewer must not have made it right. I used a white onion to grate in and boy, what a great 'oniony' flavor. The anchovie paste was such a surprise, it must be the key to the grea flavor!

Everyone has their own personal likes and dislikes so I can't say that this recipe is disgusting or not addicting for someone who likes cream cheese. To each their own, I say.  I have been making an anchovy dip for 30 years that I use for steak, preferably steak fondue.  It includes all of the ingredients mentioned but only 1-8 oz pkg cream cheese, up to 2 tablespoons anchovy paste (your preference), 1 tablespoon chives, 1 tablespoon minced onion (I prefer green onion with their tops), 1 clove minced garlic, a teaspoon lemon juice and a teaspoon of Worcestershire.  There's no particular order, just mix it up and let it chill to combine their wonderful flavors.  This is a fun recipe in that you can add olives, pimento, chopped artichokes, etc.  I'm getting ready to make bacon wrapped stuffed jalapeno poppers with it.  I'll bet it will be great but steak, in my opinion, is the best use of this dip by far.  Oh, and also don't be afraid to use the paste, that is what makes the flavor so perfect and I would never eat anchovies any other way.

This came out so DISGUSTING. I am not exactly sure what it was supposed to taste like, but it came out REALLY gross. My boyfriend thought that it was some kind of bad joke. We didn't eat any of it.

This tastes like cream cheese with onions.  No different from anything you could get in a store.  Not a lick-clean recipe for us.

I DOUBLED the amount of anchovy paste, DOUBLED the grated onion and DOUBLED the garlic, chilled for 12 hours and this was still a pretty bland dip. Not bad, but in no way ADDICTING! I pretty much had a full bowl left by the end of the party!

This recipe calls for garlic powder, but it doesn't say when to put it in and the recipe also says to add anchovy paste, but that's not in the ingredients.

Kind of bland, but I may have been too shy with the anchovy paste.  It was not very popular at a recent party

This dip is delicious!  My 4 year old son has been enjoying it with potato chips, and he keeps saying how good it is.  I will definitely be making this dip again!

This is amazing.  I found this recipe a few years ago and have made it more times then I can count!  Unfortunately I developed an allergy to onion a year ago and can't eat this anymore.  I've been meaning to try it with garlic or asafetida.

I don't know what everyone has been doing! This dip is crazy addicting. I've made it 10+ times now for family get togethers, and every time I see people scraping the bowl! I have one secret, I use fresh garlic straight from my food processor and leave the dip in the fridge overnight. This dip has been delicious with chips, pretzels, grain crackers, rice crackers, veggies, and I always make extra for when I make my turkey party wraps. If you want to be daring, add cheese as a topping. I've had success with fresh parmesan! If you didn't like it the first time, give it another go with fresh garlic and make sure it is mixed very well. The recipe says to whip the final ingredients with a fork, but I always use my electric hand mixer. When you get it right, it will have your friends and relatives gathered around the food table.

I made this as written but in the end did add extra anchovy paste as others mentioned. I used green onions for my onions to give it some color. I served it with potato chips which made it a bit too salty for me and I think it would be better dipped with veggies but my husband loved it just as it was. To me it tasted like a really creamy French Onion Dip. My husband already asked if I wanted him to pick up some more cream cheese so it looks like I will be making this one often.

I made this and took the advice of other reviewers and added the green onion and fresh minced garlic. After letting the flavors meld for 2 hrs, it was great!! Served it with crackers. For those that find this bland, put spices in that you would like, I happen to love cream cheese so this was perfect for me, if you arent a fan, try less or add more garlic etc but be sure to let the flavors "marry" for a bit in the fridge. Will be making this again over and over. Thank you for sharing the recipe!!

This is fantastic.  First time I folled the recipe exactly and loved it.  The second time I made it I used Fat Free Greek Yogurt minus the mild and I still love it.  It is on my list to make again and again when I need a dip for chips or veggies.  Very tasty!!

Can't wait to try this with the addition of the anchovy. My first memory of this chip dip is at least 42 years ago. My Grandma from Milwaukee had this at every holiday at her house.  She is the one who taught me that "double dipping" was not acceptable.  She caught me when I was 7 or 8 years old and the dip was thrown out.........never double dipped again (at least not when grandma was looking!!!)

So I made this Christmas Eve to eat for Christmas Day. When I asked my husband to buy the anchovy paste he made a face and asked what it was for. Haven't told anyone what's in the dip and people are eating up! Made it per the recipe but added a smidge more milk and used green onions. Toasted a baguette and sliced it. Happy faces here!
