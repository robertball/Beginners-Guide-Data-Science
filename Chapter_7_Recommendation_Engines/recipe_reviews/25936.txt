Easy to prepare and lots of flavor. I cooked the onion, celery, and carrot in a bit of olive oil before adding the other ingredients. This was a comfort food for sure, it reminded me of my Grandma's vegetable soup, something I haven't had since before 2001 when she passed. Thank you so much for a great recipe and an easy weeknight dinner.

This recipe was excellent!  My husband made me promise that I would make it all winter long.  I did add paprika, onion & garlic powder and FLOUR to thicken it up and it was perfect.  I followed certain reviews that said to use stewed tomatoes and I also added potatoes.  Thanks so much!

This is FANTASTIC!  Very filling, and very delicious.  I added a half cup of instant brown rice, and a little paprika.  This is the best soup I've ever had - I will DEFINITELY be making this again.  Thanks!!

This has a wonderful flavor, but I wouldn't call it a stew.  I used cream of celery condensed soup instead of celery, to give it a thicker broth.  Next time I will used diced canned tomatoes instead of whole.  Overall, fantastic recipe.

I just made this, it was so fantastic!  I   sauted the onions before hand, added the zucchini later than everything else, and cut up the tomatoes (next time I'll used pre-cut ones) but other than that I kept the recipe the same.  It was great, I'm totally making it again!

I made this recipe on a camping trip with about 8 familes--about about 23 kids!  It was easy to do on the campstoves and everyone--kids included--enjoyed it!

first try I found this a bit wet and dull .. okay for the boiled veggie type.  
Second try I added 
1/2 tsp paprika; 1/2 tsp chili flakes; 4 cloves garlic; pinch of fresh thyme & pinch fresh rosemary. Reduced broth to 4 cups and added a bit of corn starch to thicken at the end.  Served over cheddar tea biscuits .. awesome.

pretty good, i added a few extra veggies, but that's nothing new.  Made extra and stored it in the freezer, which was great for a quick lunch a few weeks later!

Absolutely DELICOUS!! It's summer but look forward to curling up in a blanket with this soup/stew in the winter! Hubby loves it! Changed the recipe a bit, didn't use peas, used Jersey white corn off the cob. For the tomato portion I used a can of diced tomatoes and a can of crushed tomatoes. put tons of veggies in, peppers (red, green & yellow), doubled if not tripled the recipe so as to have leftovers! Added some sirachi (sp?) hot sauce and a dash of worchester (sp?) sauce. Also added two cloves of crushed garlic + some italian seasoning + a little bit of olive oil. Heaven in a bowl! Thanks!

My Grandmother was a wonderful, willfull, and wild woman and I loved her dearly. she could make, as the saying goes in my family, "soup out of air" and it'd be delicious every time and maybe a tad different every time too, she never measured a thing, she used what she had on hand. and seasoning was last and considered by who was eating it! Spicy for this one, extra sage for that one, She was a wizard at the perfect meal! and this recipe reminds me of one of her soups, sometimes the simplest things are the best. I've noticed some reviews where the recipe was labled bland - all soups, in my opinion, need to start that way. Whats bland for one isnt bland for another. you know what you like and you know what you dont. if you're making a soup or stew that calls for basil - and you don't like basil, you don't put it in. This recipe allows for personal tastes to rule the stew so to speak and it's a perfectly balanced, delicious stew (over mashed potatoes! YUMMMMY) I add a bit of cajun seasoning, parsley and some black pepper...so good.. I think i'm going to go have a 'lil bit now! :)

But only 4 cups of chicken broth otherwise it would be soup and it still was pretty tasty soup.  Added a diced potato,a bit of Italian Seasoning and paprika as per previous reviewers and the only NON FRESH veggie was the cup of frozen peas.

Oh my gosh, this is good!  So flavorful.  My husband went crazy over this recipe.  I thickened the sauce with a little flour to make it more "stew like" rather than soup and it was wonderful.  Will definitely make it again.

Yummy! I didn't make any changes and used pre-cooked chicken strips from Trader Joes that I cubed myself. Beware, this is more of a soup than a stew though.

This was so quick and easy to make - like other posters, I changed the vegies a bit, added some cabbage, omitted the peas and zuchini, thickened the sauce a little and served it with rice; my kids gobbled this up and asked for more - wonderful quick dish for a cold winter night!

This is one of the BEST soups I've ever had!!  The second time I made it I modified it a little to suit my taste:  I sauteed the carrots, onion & celery in a little EVOO before adding 2 1/2 cups of chicken broth reserved from boiling the chicken breasts.  I used 1 can of diced tomatoes and 1 (6oz.) can of tomato paste, to thicken it up a little bit.  And I seasoned with 2 tsp. of dry Italian dressing mix, 1 1/2 tsp. coarse-ground black pepper, 1/2 tsp. salt.  I added one more 16 oz. can of chicken broth.  I used frozen corn & omitted the peas (they got a little mushy on the original version).  I really enjoyed the quartered sliced zucchini (but would also try it with frozen green beans in place of the zucchini). REALLY TASTY! (I think the 2 tsp. of dry Italian ("Good Seasons") dressing mix was the flavor key to me!!

Very tasty.  I did saute the onions, celery and carrots in some olive oil first, as suggested.  And I think it could use a touch more seasoning the next time I make it.  I served it over white rice, and everyone had seconds and thirds.

I cooked the onions carrots and celery in some olive oil.  Instead of the whole tomatoes I added one cup of diced tomatoes and one cup of diced tomatoes with mild green chili's.  My husband loved it.  Try it and enjoy, it is not hot!  It was delicious, I have made it according to the recipe also and it was great also!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was great!  Lots of veggies and the smell is wonderful.  I thought it was just a little bland.  I added a packet of Italian seasoning and thickened it with some sour cream at the end.  Love it!

This is a basic recipe with lots of room for customizations. This is the first soup I ever made and it was a HIT! I omitted the celery, added mushrooms, baked the chicken breasts beforehand with roasted red pepper & garlic seasoning, and added a bay leaf, paprika, and Italian seasoning to the soup while it simmered. Overall - excellent.

This was great but I imagine would have been a bit bland without some seasonings. Don't get me wrong, I love the flavors of veggies mingling but I needed a little extra so I added in about 1 tsp each of dried basil, parsley, oregano, garlic powder, black pepper, and Mortons lite salt (I just eyed it so it could have been more). I also added cabbage to the mix, used fat free reduced sodium chicken broth and added in a bit more chicken than called for (3 breasts). I'm also not sure why it doesn't say to dice the whole tomatoes, but I did anyway because I wanted to be able to easily eat them. I drained the liquid into the pot, then dumped the whole tomatoes in a bowl to catch the juice as I cut them. This added just enough juice to cover the mix. Love this low cal dish and will definitely be making it again!

Absolutely delicious!  I sauteed the onions, carrots and celery before adding the rest of the ingredients.  As one review mentioned, I will use diced tomatoes next time instead of whole tomatoes as that is the only vegetable that remains chunky in the stew.  Enjoy!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe--it is definitely a soup not a stew. I only gave it 4 stars because I added a lot of spices to kick it up a notch. As written it would be too bland for us. It is really a great alternative to the normal chicken soup!

Very Good! I served it over mashed potatos. I was suprised that the recipe didnt ask for any seasoning. I added oregano, garlic powder, salt, & pepper. I thickened it up with some corn starch. I also left out the zuccuni. We enjoyed it.

As mentioned before this is more a soup than a stew but it was very good nonetheless.  I used only 4 cups of broth and that was plenty, added a bit of sugar, seasoned with garlic powder, salt, pepper and Italian seasonings, and thickened with cornstarch.

Great recipe, low calorie and my wife loves it. I cooked this a couple of times and the last time it turned out more like stew. I added brown rice as Kellilah suggested and cooked in a crock pot for 5 hours.

This was a great soup! I doubled the recipe, and 30 minutes was still plenty of time to get the veggies tender. Very filling and 111 calories earns it a place in my recipe box.

This was a tasty and easy recipe. I did add a little creole seasoning (about 1 tsp) and used my hand blender to thicken it a bit before serving.

I have been making a version of this for easily 30 years.  My version calls for stewed tomatoes, Italian seasoning & adding in some variety of small or thin pasta at the end. No peas, no zucchini. My definition of stew is thick; what I make is a soup. I do saute chicken & veggies in a bit of oil before adding tomatoes and broth just because I'm not crazy about boiled food. I made this version because I didn't have the stewed tomatoes on hand for mine. My family did not care for it. It is quick & easy, just really missed the stewed tomato flavor.

This is one of the easiest recipes and can be used as a chicken shepherd's pie with the addition of a mashed potato crust on top. Saute the veggies first and to thicken it a bit, you can add a jar of chicken gravy or a roux. Delish!

I made this but used boneless thighs as I believe there is MORE FLAVOR in the dark meat.  Will  a little corn starch next time to thicken up the juices.  Yummy!

We loved this :) I made some slight alterations. I used cut up chicken thighs (because its what I had), threw in some flour and condensed soup to thicken it and used 1 1/2 cans of stewed tomatoes instead of fresh. Thanks Sal! I don't even really like soup/stews and this was great! I'm sure it will be a regular for our family.

I cooked the chicken in the onions and garlic first in the soup pot. I then added the remaining ingredients adding parsnips and mushrooms to the list.  I also added Mrs. Dash seasonings (husband has to watch salt intake) while it was simmering. I also finished with a dollop of sour cream in each bowl when serving. Served it with bread and everyone loved it!

I tried to add potatoes to give it something more, and I didn't want to use noodles.  It was not a good idea.  My husband said that I should have used rice, yellow saffron rice or white rice, just to give it more body.  Other than my mistake this is a good stew.

Great recipe, but not really a stew. I added green beans, seasoned the chicken heavily while cooking it, and used canned diced tomatoes instead of whole ones, and it came out wonderfully. Will definitely make again.

i love it! didn't have celery, probably would've added a bit of zest, but doesn't matter. very flavorful. i'd say comfort food level. added a bit of elbow macaroni for some carbs. it was a tiny bit watery so i just had it simmer without the lid so it would thicken up a bit. lovely!

I had to make a number of changes. I added 1/2 cup of parmasan cheese at the end, as well as adding garlic and basil.

This was a great recipe. I added ham chunks along with the chicken and it turned out wonderful.

Since I first tried this recipe, my family has asked me to make it every week! I have adapted it a bit by adding 1 tsp each of garlic powder, chili powder, and paprika. I also add about 1/2 cup of sour cream, heated up, before serving. This recipe is now a menu staple! Thank you sal!

This recipe is quite bland for my taste and that's even after adding extra chicken bouillon and other spices to liven it up.  It's missing flavor.

Overall, its a great recipe.  The kids love it.  We've made it a number of times.  We add an premixed Italian seasoning mix (usually about a teaspoon or so) and we add 2 cups of rice.  We also sauté one or two cloves of garlic and an onion as well.

Really good! Most stew recipes are made with beef but too much beef is boring. Chicken stew adds creativity. I think it is the zucchini that makes it so good.

Warm, comforting and healthy.  I too sauteed the onion, celery carrots in olive oil.  (Also added a chopped green pepper to the mix as I need to use it).  Used 2 cans of undrained diced tomatoes, additional seasonings and loved it.  Very forgiving recipe.   I also used chicken from a rotissare.

I added tons of spices ... cream of celery soup instead of celery ... made cheesey easy drop biscuits increased amount of chicken ... I bought one of those rotisserie chickens ... used the breast and a bit of the dark meat as well ... will use the rest for sandwiches tomorrow evening for din din ... I will serve over white rice ... it tastes good but a little 'sweet' for my tastes ... peas and corn and carrots ... all sweet ... but it is so darn easy ... I strongly suggest making it when you are tired of cooking and just tired with little time.  Go for it!!!  But add lots of yummies, otherwise, it will definitely be too bland.

A great soup/stew - healthy, filling.  I added a little Orzo, paprika and sambal for a slight kick.  Made plenty of extra and it is tasting even better the next day.

Very good, I added paprika and next time I'm going to try rice. It is more of a soup than a stew and I used diced tomatoes as well. Will def make again.

As others have said, this was more like a soup than a stew but it was still quite nice.  I like the base idea but next time I will change the vegetable to suit my tastes.

Ehh . . . looks pretty but needs some tweaking. I used fresh corn off the cob and a can of stewed tomatoes and cooked about an hour. I also started by sauteeing the onions and some garlic, then adding everything else. After finishing and tasting, I goosed it up with Tony Chachere's and some herbs. Maybe more vegs and more seasoning?

I wasn't all that impressed with this soup.  It was okay, but nothing near as good as I had expected.  The chicken just didn't seem to add much flavor.  I may play around with it some more and make it again.

This recipe was great! Very easy to prepare and loaded with vegetables. I added a yellow bell pepper since I didn’t have any courgette at hand and a little salt and pepper towards the end. I will most definitely be making this again.

This was amazing!  I improvised by cooking the diced chicken breast in my Dutch oven on stovetop with butter and better than bullion chicken flavor-added all other ingredients to Dutch oven and cooked on low in covered Dutch oven and we were practically weeping as we ate this.  It’s divine.  When I was prepping I couldn’t imagine how robust and hearty this would be.  If one eats carbs, you couldn’t go wrong with buttery biscuits served with this dish.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but I think my version is a bit better.

I knew it was going to be too watery using the recommended amount of chicken broth so I only used 2/3rds of what was called for. 

Secondly, I used diced canned tomatoes instead of whole.

Third, I added in some potatoes and at the end I put in some rice to suck up all the moisture.  This gave it much more of a stew consistency.  

When I ate it I shook in a few drops of franks red hot sauce for some added flavour and a bit of kick. 

Enjoy

I loved this recipe. I changed very little (and really, just to suit my family's tastes, nothing drastic), but it is a bit watery. To solve that, either add some cream cheese or some Parmesan cheese. Either will thicken it up just the right amount and add an extra bit of flavor that complements this dish perfectly!

We really didn't like this at all. The stew had no flavor to it no matter how I doctored it up. It was also more like a soup, than a stew. I won't be making it again.

After I cooked the chicken, I put everything into the crock pot, along with 3/4 cup of white rice, and then put on high setting for an hour and ate it. We liked it-- I would make it again. Served with honey biscuts. DId not add zucchini or peas.

We had this for dinner and LOVED it!  I cooked the onion, celery and zucchini in a little bit of olive oil before adding the other ingredients.  I also added a can of rotel tomatoes, fresh cilantro, garlic powder, salt,and pepper for a bit more flavor.  It was definitely and healthy and tasty option that will go on the menu rotation at our house!

We had this for lunch on Satuday. I wouldn't say it was great, just okay. I might make up a big batch for canning, but without the celery. I didn't care for the crunch or flavor of it. I also added some herbs, because I knew I wouldn't like it without. I added a bit of fresh red bell pepper because I really like the taste. Also if I make it again I'll try to thicken the broth, because I did find it more soup like, as other reviewers had commented.

Bland.  I was disappointed in the recipe. Thought it very bland (although I did add a little salt and pepper to try to help).  My son didn't like; my teen-age daughter said, "Mom, it tastes like something is missing".  Following on another reader's suggestion, and not wanting to waste the batch, I added a can of cream of celery soup and simmered a few minutes more, but it still didn't have a memorable flavor.  Perhaps if recipe had used various seasonings the broth would have been more flavorful.  My husband was out of town last night but I will ask him to try the soup when he returns tonight and if he thinks any differently than the rest of our family I will edit the post.

We liked this, including my 5 year old.  Served it over a little rice.  I saved some of the broth...probably a bit over a cup, and put to the side...then added the veggies.  Also added cream of chicken and cream of mushroom to make it thicker.  Boiled the celery and onion with the chicken before reserving the broth for later.  It made more than we'll need by far.  Froze half of it for a later day within the next month or two.  Added salt, pepper, and garlic powder as well.  Tasted good!

This is delicious and easy. Simple food is often the best. A soup/stew like this on a winter afternoon is great. I gave it 4 stars because I did think a couple steps were missing. First, I sauteed the onions and celery in a little light butter first to soften them before adding everything else. Second, I did not have zucchini so I used green beans instead. For my family's taste, I know that was more appealing. I added a cup of instant rice at the end to thicken it up and make it less soup-like. Finally, there were no seasonings for this. My preference is always herbes de provence. Gives almost everything a lovely finishing taste. Since we're all watching, I used fat free stock and the result is a yummy soup that is very light. Thanks for the recipe!!!
