I used buttermilk instead of regular milk and melted butter instead of vegetable oil. I had a 4 oz. can of mild diced chilies, I used half of that can in place of the canned whole jalapeno peppers. I could not find my mini muffin tins, I made 12 full sized muffins instead. Baked at 350*, they were done in just under 20 minutes. Very good cornbread recipe--very moist, lightly sweet, nice texture. We all really liked them.

I didn't have great success with this recipe, but I'm rating four stars anyway as I think some of the issues I had were mine = ) ...so consider this review just sharing my experience.  The garlic was way too strong.  I use granulated garlic, which I thought was the same as garlic powder, but maybe not; maybe this was the problem.  Also, the cheese that was exposed on top of the muffins kinda burned by the time the muffins started to brown.  Again, that could be me:  my oven.  But I really had a problem with the instructions.  The description, the blurb at the top, says 'makes 3 dozen mini', as does the serving size.  The ingredients say, for 1 T butter and 3 T cornmeal, used to prep the pans, 'divided'.  Then Step 4 says 'brush 18 mini muffin cups'.  I noticed that there were no instructions to use two pans, or bake one pan two times, but I, not being much of a baker, thot that the 1 cup flour would not yield enough to make 36, so I just prepped the pan for the 18.  I ended up making 48. Granted, mini muffin tins may vary in size, but given the inconsistencies in the instructions, I think there was a failure in editing or proofreading.  Not from the submitter, but from AR. This was kind of a mess as I like to mix the wet and dry ingredients and get them into the oven as soon as possible, because this is when the leavening starts working.  More experienced bakers probably would have known better, but not me!!

I used jarred sliced jalapenos with seeds and some juice and followed directions. these smell terrific! the burn at the end melted my throat. I would cut back on the heat, I am a wuss about spicy food. the wife and daughters went YEHAW on these. I did make 12 large muffins and baked at 425 maybe 18 minutes. I did sub half and half  for half the cow-juice. the vanilla is the secret ingredient here. perfect with any bland main course... soup, stew or a veggie dinner. thanks for posting, 5 thumbs high!

I made these almost exactly as listed, except I had no vegetable oil on hand, only butter. I cut this recipe in half just to try them out. I really am enjoying them. They aren't too sweet or too spicy or too cheesey. I love the texture. I'm going to make these again for an upcoming pot luck. It won't matter to me if anyone else likes them, because I'll get to take them home. LOL. THANKS SO MUCH FOR SHARING.

I didn't have cheddar so I used the cheese I had and it was fine, also don't have mini-muffin pans so I made regular sized ones and baked for 17 minutes. I am saving this recipe!

I HATE when people write reviews and substitute.  But I'm going to!  In addition to the Jalapenos, I added a drained jar of diced pimentos and substituted a can of creamed corn for the milk.  (I also just added a little milk to taste for moisture, maybe 1/4 cup.)

Look beautiful and taste great.  Make sure you cook long enough to get a little crunch on the bottom of the muffins.  Goes great with Guy Fieri  from Food Network's "Dragon's Breath Chili".  Google it!

A little too garlicky for my tastebuds. Reduce garlic to half a teaspoon for the ideal amount.

A nice, easy base recipe.  I modified quite a bit to add flavor and still just okay.  Used half and half instead of milk, a Fresno chili instead of a jalapeño and added a can of creamed corn and whole kernel corn (moist and texture!) and sprinkled tops with chives.  Green onion mixed in would help and will top with honey.  Didn't care much for the corn meal coating.

Wow these muffins were addictive!! They were moist, spicy, and sweet and didn't crumble when I put butter on them.  I didn't have canned jalapeños on hand so I used one fresh jalapeno with the seeds and the spiciness was just right!
