I have made this recipe many times now and after tweaking with ingredients, I think I finally found perfection! I found that I had to increase/decrease some ingredients: I cut the sugar by 1/2C, increased the Poppyseeds to a 1/4C and I used 1/2C of real lemon Juice instead of the extracts as it has more flavour. I also put the rind of a lemon into the batter.(I also always mix my ingredients by wet then mix dry into it) I baked mine in a bundt pan for 1 hour & 10 min. It baked beautifully and turned a nice golden colour! Instead of the glaze I sifted Icing sugar on top.  It was very pretty and tasted nice too.

Good recipe, but please use REAL LEMON JUICE.  The extract doesn't impart any lemon flavor.  I use a full 1/2 cup of lemon juice (the bottled juice is perfect for this), 3 teaspoons of poppy seed and buttermilk instead of regular milk.  The buttermilk improves the texture of the bread, creating a lighter, fluffier version.  If you like your bread a little denser, than stick with regular milk.  I baked mine in 2 loaf pans instead of three.  For the Glaze: 1/4 cup orange juice, 4-5 tablepsoons powdered sugar.  Don't use original recipe for the glaze, it's way too sweet.  Always use powdered sugar when making a glaze for ANYTHING. (3 star for original recipe, 5 stars for alterations.  Great base recipe though)

My whole neighborhood raves about this one!  Personally, I like bigger loaves so I use this recipe and pour it into 2 standard bread loaf pans (I personally really like the silicone ones for this recipe too) and I just have to keep checking with a toothpick in the center to make sure they're done after about 1 hour 10 minutes.  Also, it helps to microwave the OJ cocktail at the end before applying to the hot loaf right as it comes out of the oven....otherwise you'll never get the sugar to dissolve in 1/4C of OJ!!  

Added 8/11/07 - OK I have made this recipe about 30 times by this point and I can say each time I tried cutting back the oil, it came out dry and excessively dark on the sides.  Now I actually increase the oil slightly and the milk as well by maybe 1/4C each, and I have dropped the temp to 325.  For Jumbo sized Muffins this recipe will make exactly one dozen and you MUST increase the oil to 1 1/2C and the Milk to 1 3/4C and bake for 50 min at 325.  For bread, I don't do the 3 loaves, I pour it all into 2 pans and just bake it a little longer, checking with a toothpick.  Oh - I also increase the vanilla and lemon extract to 2 tsp each.  with the glaze hot and completely melted after heating in the microwave, I use a pastry brush and paint it on top, not once, but twice!  Enjoy...

Excellent!  I like this type of bread very lemony and very moist, so I added the juice and zest of one lemon to the batter, in addition to the lemon extract.  I divided the glaze into two parts.  The first I used the 1/4 cup orange juice, the juice of one lemon and 1/3 cup sugar.  I poked holes in the top of the bread and poured the glaze on top.  Once the bread was cool, I made a simple powdered sugar glaze of about 1-1/4 cup powdered sugar, 1-1/2 Tbsp. water and 1/2 tsp lemon extract.  I was attempting to make the bread like what I always get at Caribou Coffee.  It came out soooo good.  Very lemony and moist and the frosting on top is a nice treat!  I found that this recipe only made two loaves of bread, and I baked them for 55 minutes.

I've always believed  the real fruit gives better flavor than extract, so I omitted the lemon extract and used the rind of 1 lemon, extracted the juice and added the milk to fill 1 1/2 cups. This gave the cake a delicate lemon flavor, just right for my family's taste.  If strong lemon taste is desired, use 2 lemons. I've also tried making an all-orange version using the rind of the orange in the cake and the juice for the glaze.  Still good but the lemon-inside orange-outside contrast was more interesting.  Lastly, make this cake in a 12-cup bundt pan.  The cake comes out large, and if baked to golden perfection, it turns out so pretty!  Lastly, because other people said they had problems with the cake sticking to the bottom of the pan, I use a brush to put on the glaze.

Wonderful bread!!!  Made it last night and didn't use the glaze as I was freezing two of the three loaves for the holidays.  It was still great! Wish I had followed one reviewers advice, however, and only made two loaves.  My three are not as high as I would like.

Yummy! I did a few changes. Cut sugar to 2 cups. Cut the vanilla to 1 tsp. Cut the oil to just 1/2 cup (saves on calories). Used juice of 1 lemon plus enough milk to make 1 1/2 cups. Plus added the zest of 1 lemon. These came out so delicious and moist! I made 12 muffins and 1 loaf. Loaf took about 65 mins and the muffins took about 25 mins. I added poppy seeds to the loaf only and left them out of the muffins for my kids. This is a keeper for us! Thank you!

I make this bread every Christmas for family and friends and they love it! The only thing I do differently is omit the almond extract and use only the lemon extract in the bread and add 2 TBSP of melted butter and lemon extract to the topping. It is best poured over loaves when warm. My friends love it so much that they give me big bottles of poppyseeds for my birthday!! :-)

I've made this recipe several times and have made the following tweaks which have received rave reviews:  Zest and juice 2 lemons.  Add the juice and half of the zest to the milk.  Make 24 muffins instead of bread.  Instead of the sugar glaze, make a classic (but slightly thick) confectioner's sugar, milk glaze; adding the remaining zest and a touch of lemon extract or additional lemon juice.

The secret to wow is this -- put some lemon curd in a pastry bag and squirt it into the center of each of the muffins using a bismark filling tip.  Fill until the muffins bulge slightly, when you remove the tip, you should have a small yellow circular "center".  Now, put the white confectioner's sugar glaze in a piping bag with a plain round tip.  Pipe the glaze on to create diasy-like flower petals.

Awesome results, looks very impressive on a bake sale table.  Everybody loves them.  With the injection of lemon curd you get the perfect amount of lemon flavor and you get lemon in every bite.

You've got to try this at least once.

This bread was WONDERFUL, it really hit the spot. I was out of orange juice so I didn't use the glaze and it was still delicious! It didn't make as much as the recipe said it only filled two 8x5s but still very good!!

in response to the first post-  don't add both lemon juice and buttermilk.  They are both acidic and will dull the effect of the baking powder.  Instead, add the lemon juice (I'd use only 1/3 cup) to plain milk (the amount originally suggested) in a measuring cup.  This is the old fashioned way to create "sour milk", which will yeild you a very moist, rich cake.

This is quite possibly the best scratch made cake that has come out of my oven.  I baked it in a bundt pan for a little under and hour and it was really, really delicious.  I followed the advice of juicing and zesting two lemons into a large measuring cup and pouring the milk in to equal 1 1/2 cups.  Let it sit for 5 minutes to get a little funky (like buttermilk) and added the oil and eggs  to the same cup.  It seemed that there were mixed reviews on the icing so I looked at some other recipes similar to this one and came up with this concoction: juice and zest from one lemon, about a cup of powdered sugar (depends on how much juice you get out of the lemon), a tbl of melted butter, and a tbl of water.  Don't be scared by the watery glaze!!  It is meant to soak into the bread like a simple syrup, NOT pour over the sides in thick lovely mounds.  I also poked the top of the cake with a toothpick (after I turned it out to cool) all over the place to facilitate the "soak."  I was left with a really nice crunchy, sugary layer on the outside of the cake and an uncredibly moist, tender, pleasingly dense cake on the inside with lemon everywhere!  No extracts or artificial flavorings in this cake and it was absolutely fantastic.

Not sure what went wrong with this recipe or if I made it the way it was supposed to be.  I reduced the sugar 1/4 cup and the oil 1/8 cup.  This cake had an off taste to it.  I think it had way too much oil.  I used real lemon juice instead of extract.  The cake had a play dough like taste to it.  The consistency was dense.  No one in the house liked it.  I made it because I had no lemons or butter defrosted and I believed the reviews.  But it was awful.  I went to Martha stewart on line and got a different recipe with  real lemon juice and butter which was a winner.  Have used many recipes off here and this one was the worst so far.

I didn't actually eat this bread, but I made it for other people.  They loved it, and ate it as a dessert.  I did though, taste the top of the bread, which has an orange type glaze, and it was wonderful.  I could eat that all day long.

This was absolutely delicious.  That being said, I did make quite a few changes to the recipe, as enumerated below.  - I used two regular loaf pans, and cooked at only 325 degrees, for the same length of time   - increased poppy seeds to 2 1/2 tablespoons - used buttermilk instead of regular milk - added zest (I just used zest from one lemon) - increased lemon juice in bread to 1/4 cup - decreased sugar to 2 1/4 cups  - for the glaze, I used powdered sugar instead of regular sugar.  Then I used the listed amount of orange juice, but increased the lemon juice to about 1 tbs and used somewhere between a quarter and a half cup of powdered sugar, until I got the desired consistency and sweetness.  - in preparing the ingredients, I mixed all the dry ingredients in one bowl, and the wet ones in another (mixing those at a low speed only as much as absolutely necessary) - I then combined the two taking care to only mix them for a short time, just enough to get rid of any big dry clumps.  This prevents your batter from getting rubbery and keeps your bread fluffy and moist.  Like I said, I made a lot of changes, but this was the best lemon poppy seed bread I have ever had.  It was distinctly lemon in flavor (not overly sweet like so many lemon desserts, but still sweet enough), and the texture was perfect: melt in your mouth fluffy and light.

I made this tonight and it was moist and flavorful.  I took some of the suggestions and substitute 1/2c. applesauce fro 1/2 c. oil, used lemon juice instead of extract and substituted 1/2 of the white flour with wheat flour.  Definately a keeper

This turned out really nicely!  I did make a couple changes. First, I used REAL lemon. Don't like extract! I squeezed the juice from 2 lemons which ended up being about 1/3 cup of juice probably. Then grated the rind from both lemons and added that. I also increased the amount of poppy seeds to about 1/3 cup. I didn't bother withe the glaze. And I decided to use 2 large loaf pans instead of 3. Turned out great! :)

This is overall a good recipe! I would suggest as many others have to add much more lemon to this recipe. Even adding 1/2 cup or more of fresh lemon juice and the zest from the lemon still leaves a mellow lemon taste. This is also a bit more of a dense bread.  Doon't skip the orange juice topping, it is excellent! I poked holes in the top of my jumbo muffins (baked at 325 for 30 minutes) and poured the orange juice topping on. This would also be great with vanilla glaze from this site.

Love this bread, and my husband raved about it.  Took the advice of previous reviewers and made a few changes: used 1/2 cup of lemon juice instead of extract, and used confectioners' sugar for the glaze.  Also, I used 1/2 cup applesauce as a substitute for 1/2 cup of the oil.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Oh YUM!!!  I made 1 loaf (60 mins of baking) & 12 muffins (25 mins of baking) from the batter.  After reading all the reviews, these are the changes I made...I used 3 Tablespoons of poppy seeds, in addition to the lemon extract, I added the juice & zest from one fresh lemon.  I cut the sugar to 2 cups in the batter & to 1/2 cup in the glaze, and cut the oil to 1 cup.  I microwaved the OJ to help dissolve the sugar.  These muffins were SO moist and delicious!!!!!!

This was very good!  I made two loaves instead of three (and added 5 min of baking time), and one loaf was gone in only a few hours! I followed some of the others' suggestions by squeezing some lemon juice and adding enough milk to it to make 1 1/2 c. I still added some lemon extract (a little less than 1 t because I ran out). I also added more poppy seeds and reduced the sugar to 2 c.  Delicious! I will definitely make it again!

Wonderful! I didn't have lemon extract so I substituted a little lemon zest and fresh lemon juice. Turned out amazing. Thanks!

I followed this recipe exactly except substituted one cup of whole wheat flour for one of the cups of white flour. This is a wonderful/yummy bread. I made 2 large loafs instead of three. I also used toothpicks to poke holes through them right before I poured the glaze on them. MMMMM!

Great recipe, but I feel it can be improved. I added the zest of one lemon and the juice of two lemons (I decreased the amount of milk to make up for the extra liquid) and doubled the amount of poppy seeds. The natural lemon flavor, in my opinion, makes a better bread than the extract alone. I also used the lemon and vanilla extract called for in the recipe and 1/2 tsp. of almond extract. Also, definitely use confectioner's sugar rather than granulated sugar in the glaze and heat the OJ up in the microwave to assist with melting the sugar. I used a bundt pan sprayed with cooking spray w/flour on 325 for exactly one hour, and the bread was perfectly done. My oven is a little hotter than most, so 340 would probably work in a normal oven. I let the bread sit in the pan for 10 minutes then dumped it onto a cooling rack and glazed it. After it cooled, I wrapped the bread in plastic wrap and let it sit out at room temp. overnight. It is incredible this morning!!!

Very good.  We made 2 loaves out of the bread instead of 3.  I put the glaze on one and not the other.  Everyone liked both of them but some liked the added crunch of the one with the glaze better.  I read a bunch of review first and did some things differently according to the reviews. I used real lemons instead of the lemon extract.  I put in the juice of 2 lemons and added it to the milk so that the total of the 2 combined was 1 1/2 cups.  I used 2 tbs. poppy seeds.  For the icing I used the orange juice, some lemon juice and enough powdered sugar to make it the right consistency.  I poked holes in the top of the bread on poured it on.

There are lots of conflicting reviews on this recipe, so I read them all and tried to make the most common (sense) adjustments before baking. First, some facts: 1) The base recipe is really more of a cake than a bread, 2) This recipe makes two (not three!) loafs, and 3) Use lemon juice, not lemon extract to get the zesty burst of lemon flavor.

The Batter: Added ½ cup of lemon juice instead of extract.  Increased oil to 1 and ¼ cup for a moist cake. Left the sugar and the poppy seeds at the original recipe. I was surprised how many people said it was too sweet. Not so for me! Be sure to taste your batter to get it to your liking.  Next time I will bake at 325. The sides were done before the middle and got a little too crusty.

White Sugar Glaze: I let the cake cool for 10 minutes as recommended, then made a ¼ cup lemon juice, 1/3 cup white sugar glaze (microwaved to melt it down).  I cut holes in the cake, infused it, and coated the top too. This gave the cake a tangy tartness.

Powdered Sugar Glaze:  When cooled, I made a 1 ¼ cup powdered sugar, 3 tablespoons milk glaze to spread on top.  This was the sweetness it needed. Until I added the glaze, I felt it wasn't sweet enough.

All in all, good recipe. The cake was tasty (maybe a tad too dense), the white sugar glaze was tart, and the powdered sugar glaze gave it sweetness. I love lemon and wanted to make something springy, so this fit the bill.  I will be thinking about how to make this recipe a bit less dense next time.

Yummy lemon poppy seed bread.... I took advice from the other reviewers and used real lemon juice in addition to the extract... which gave it great flavor.. I did add a little extra baking powder to counter act the acidity and ensure that this bread would bake up nicely, which it did... I also added extra poppy seeds... I made mine in two normal sized bread pans instead of the 8x4... turned out great

This recipe is very easy and delicious.  I did take some other reviewers advice and used real lemon juice ( in the bottle) and I used  1/4 cup of  real lemon juice.  I made it in 3 loaf pans and it was perfect.  I used regular sugar in the glaze, I microwaved the orange juice first to help the sugar dissolve thanks to another reviewer.  I also added more real lemon juice to taste to the glaze. Definitely a keeper!

Delicious-- this is becoming a family staple, hands down. I did make some changes, however.  I don't like things too sweet, so I cut out a cup of sugar in the batter-- it was still plenty sweet for even my sugar-loving father. I also upped the poppy seeds to two tablespoons.   For the glaze, I combined the juice and zest of one lemon with enough water to bring the liquid up to a quarter cup and then about a half-cup of sugar, maybe a little less. It was quite thin, so I added some arrow-root to thicken it; in the future I'll probably lessen the amount of water I add, but I'm posting it as I made it because it was perfect in terms of sweet-and-sour blend.   I baked it in a bundt pan for about an hour, and then poured the glaze over. It was perfect.

I have made this bread for Christmas gifts and family consumption for many years (12+)  My recipe calls for 3 Tbsp. of Poppyseed 1 1/2 cups of oil and instead of lemon it has 1 1/2 tsp. of 3 different flavorings (vanilla, almond, and butter)  The glaze has 1/2 tsp of the same 3 flavorings with the sugar & orange juice.  
This is quick to make because you can just dump all the ingredients into your mixer and let them combine.  I always put a sheet of wax or parchment paper in the bottom of my pans and always make 2 regular loaves.  My family would send me home if I failed to bring this to Thanksgiving and Christmas get togethers.

This went over well. Its not a favorite but still well liked. I made a few changes based on previous reviews. Increased the poppy seeds to almost a 1/4 cup. Used 1/2 lemon juice instead of lemon extract n the cake and decreased the milk to 1 cup. Decreased the oil to 1 cup and used half oil and half applesauce. Added 1 T lemon zest and 1/2 tsp. baking soda to cake batter. Baked in Bundt pan @ 325 degrees for 1 hour 15 minutes. Decreased sugar to 2 cups. Came out great and didn't stick to the pan at all. Probably make again the next time we're in the mood for lemon-poppyseed flavored something:)

Tried this recipe today.  Followed other's suggestions of using 1/2 cup of lemon juice, but I also put in the extract.  Very good.  Made one loaf and 8 mini loaves.  I baked the mini loaves for about 45 minutes and the regular loaf for 65 minutes.  Both of us liked it; I'm giving it 4 stars because I would not have liked it as much without the lemon juice; we like lots of flavor in our sweet breads.  I did not make the glaze, however.

This bread was a Christmas tradition growing up at my house, It was always the gift for the neighbors. My recipe and this one are almost identicle. A few differences, I use almond extract instead of lemon, also add 1 /12 tsp of buter extract. When making the glaze use frozen orange juice concentrate, this makes the glaze a much better consitancy.

I thought this came out pretty well.  It is moist and the texture feels light even though the recipe calls for a lot of oil.  My one complaint is that it wasn't lemony enough for me.  In addition to the extract, I added the juice of one whole lemon and still it wasn't as noticeable as I normally like.  My only other complaint was the glaze.  I would have preferred a powdered sugar icing instead...this one was more like a syrup that you pour over to seep into the bread.  If you like the idea of the syrup, I would advise poking a few holes in your bread with a toothpick to facilitate the syrup absorbing into the bread.  If I made this again, I may skip the syrup all together and opt for an icing.  

I made this into 16 mini-bundts and one large loaf.  I don't think there is enough batter for 3 loafs though...

I used the zest of 2 lemons in the bread and added more lemon extract.  I would add more poppy seeds the next time but there were still enough.  I did make the glaze and used the lemon juice from the 2 lemons and added the zest of a tangerine I had hanging around with 1/4 orange extract.  This made a very nice glaze.  The bread is sweet with the glaze; more like a dessert bread but none the less it is delicious.  The lemon juice helped cut down a bit on the sweetness by using it in the glaze.  This is a very nice gift to give away.  I made 2 loaves; the stated recipe if making 3 loaves would be very thin I think.  Had to bake about 65 minutes by making it into two loaves.  Would definitely make again by making the above modifications.  Great way to get rid of lemons that are kind of hanging around.  I didn't really have problems with the sticking.  I brushed on the glaze and ran around with a knife several times and used a pancake turner to help lift it out.

Panic attack!!! I thought this was in my ~allrecipes recipe box~ and couldn't find my printed version but some how lucked out!  I have made this recipe at least a dozen times and always is a hit no matter if it's a loaf, muffins, or mini muffins...still haven't tried the glaze because as soon as they come out of the oven, everyone has there hand out!  Easy and Yummy!

I made this into 24 mini muffins and 12 regular size muffins. This is very sweet, almost too sweet for me, but you can definitely taste the lemon (I used lemon juice, about 2.5 t). Also, the muffins turned out nice and soft, not soggy. All in all, a good lemon bread.

I was looking through the pictures and noticed that some breads looked more dense than others and others were lighter and fluffier. I believe this is a quick bread recipe and meant to be thick (which us how we prefer it)however if you prefer a more coffee cake like consistency then pull out your old mixer and beat your wet ingredients into your dry ingredients. It will add air to your batter giving it a cake like texture. Also, use coconut oil to prepare your pans. It will keep your bread from getting too dark on the sides and the bonus is its healthier. Thanks for the recipe!

Very average.  Used real lemon juice.  Substituted lemon juice for orange juice, and added lemon zest.  Still didn't have much lemon flavour and was very fluffy.  Was looking for more of a pound cake texture to this.  This recipe was more cake-like.

I substituted apple sauce for part of the oil and halved the recipe but used 2 eggs rather than "1 1/2"... the result was very dense. I wouldn't recommend making the changes. 

I added lemon zest and lemon juice as well in addition the the extract and it was 'just' lemon-y enough... so for those that like lemon, follow the other user's advice on using zest and juice too. 

Because I changed it I used it's average star rating at the time I tried the recipe opposed to rating my results.

I wasn't sure what to expect since lemon breads can all differ greatly; this was definitely more of a sweet, dessert, pound cake-like bread and it had wonderful flavor! In addition to the ingredients listed, I added a couple splashes of real lemon juice and the rind of one lemon. I did not make the glaze recipe that came with it but made my own out of the juice of one lemon, vanilla, and powdered sugar and that glaze was a perfect compliment. To prevent it from sticking to the pan, I buttered and then floured the pan and I had no problem with it sticking. I cut the recipe in half and made one large loaf, which took a good hour and 20ish minutes to cook.

I love quick breads like this, but mine did not turn out well.  I subbed lemon juice & lemon peel for the extract.  This had hardly any flavor.  I checked the tiny 3 loaves at 55 mins & they tested done.  But after the glaze & cooling they look & feel like they aren't cooked through. The glaze recipe is way off too.  These are going in the trash.

I halved the recipe and made into muffins. Got 12 regular and 12 mini. The taste was great although there wasn't quite enough lemon flavor for me (maybe because I used lemon juice instead of extract?) and it could have used a bit more poppy seeds but I think those are due to personal preference. Thanks for the recipe!

Gorgeous texture, beautifully moist - Easy to make. It was a little too sweet for my liking, next time I'm going to cut the sugar down a bit.

I made this recipe last night and it turned out AMAZING, sooooo delicious. Perfect amount of flavour and moistness.  I did make some minor changes, I cut the sugar down to 2 cups, instead of the lemon extract I used lemon juice and also used lemon zest to give it that extra boost.  I put a little more poppyseeds and opted out of the icing, the loaf on its own is amazing.  I also made two loafs instead of three.  I would suggest this recipe to any of my family or friends, and it is one that is going in the recipe book!  Enjoy!

This recipe is a winner!!! I will definitely be keeping this is my recipe box. However, I did make a few changes. 1. I used fresh squeezed lemon juice and the lemon zest of 1 lemon instead of the extract.  2. I added a bit extra vanilla extract. 3. I made two loaves, not 3.  The bread came out light and fluffy and very delicious!!! I only had minor problem with the bread sticking. I generously sprayed my pyrex pants with olive oil cooking spray, and I let the loaves stay in the pan for an hour. Only a little bit of the bread (on the bottom only) stuck to the pan.  I did not make the topping bc I am freezing the bread.   Thanks for the recipe!!!

This is very much like my favorite lemon poppy seed bread recipe that I've misplaced. I added 1 1/2 tsp of almond extract to the bread mix and 1/2 tsp to the glaze. Just like I remembered, very flavorful!

Excellent bread! Very tasty. The glaze in this recipe is made with white sugar which makes it clear. I think I will try powdered sugar next time for the classic white glaze.

My advice is to brush the glaze on with a pastry brush so it doesn't overpower the more subtle bread. Other than that, this is perfect the way it is.

My husband and I did not care for this recipe.  He said it wasn't lemony enough, even though I added an additional 1/2 cup lemon juice.  It baked up nicely but the flavor was too mild.  I didn't make the glaze so maybe that would have made it taste better.

I made this without the glaze and it was so good. I doubled the lemon extract to get a really nice lemon flavour. I also baked it at 325 F. I think next I will use only 2 loaf pans because it really didn't rise too much. I will definately make this again.

This bread was delicious. I have made it with and without the glaze. It is great either way. I receive rave reviews every time I make this bread. Most people think it is a cake since it is so moist. People tell me it is the best lemon bread they have ever had. Thanks for the recipe.

I love this recipe.  I've made it several
times.  I added 2T poppy seeds and cut out the 1/8C oil.  I baked it for 40-45 minutes in 5x3" tins and got seven small loaves.

After reading the other reviews I used fresh lemon juice and lemon zest in place of the lemon essence.  The lemon juice worked great but the zest, I found, was too overpowering.  Trying to be healthy I substituted apple sauce for the oil and cut back on the sugar. The texture of the bread was dense and moist but I thought it was really yummy like that, after the initial taste of the zest!  I also used the glaze but used fresh lemon juice in place of the orange juice because I didn't have any.  I think if I ever want to make this for people other than my family I will try the original recipe.

This is a really great recipe. I tried it a couple times and I only had a problem with the glaze. The first time I tried putting it on, the sugar didn't melt. I'm not sure if it is supposed to be like that or not. The second time I made it I cooked the glaze just long enough to make the sugar melt so that when you took a bite it wasn't gritty. As long as you don't drench the cake in the glaze it isn't too sweet, its just right.

I went with others and added a total of 3 TBLSP of poppy seeds.  I increased the oil to 1 1/4 cup.  I also omitted the extract and used the juice and zest of 2 lemons instead.  It was wonderful!!  With the changes, you will love it!

Ahhhhh this is so good, ate it till I was ill and then ate more, even fiance who said "I don't like lemony baked goods" couldn't put it down.  I made one giganto loaf, and upped the poppy seeds to a few heaping tablespoons.  Also soaked the seeds in buttermilk for 2 hrs before starting.  Thanks for the outstanding recipe!!!

I have made this bread in several forms - large loaves, mini loaves (makes about 4) and muffins (24 regular-size).  I have never used the glaze because the bread itself is sweet and moist enough.  The most outstanding feature of this recipe is the batter itself.  My husband called it "the best batter ever...it's like a batter milkshake!"

This was a huge hit- and easy to make. I also didn't think it needed the glaze- it was sweet/savory enough. I added more poppy seeds than what was in the recipe, and it turned out great.

Followed the recipe exactly and used lemon extract - I personally didn't really care for this - way too strong of a lemon flavor - I'm going back to my old recipe that uses yellow cake mix instead...way better.

This is the first lemon poppy seed bread recipe I've ever bothered to try because the others all seemed off somehow.  So, I was skeptical at first because this one seemed almost too perfect.  And, wow.... it really is!  There really are NO changes to be made to this recipe.  I followed it exactly the first three times I've made it and it is just wonderful.  I even swapped out some of the flour (the fourth time) for whole wheat and it was still a beautiful treat.  Thanks for sharing this one :)

This was really dense and a lot more like a cake than a bread. We were really not big fans of this recipe, it seemed like it had too much oil in it to be a bread.

I used wheat flour and I'm not sure if that was the reason I did not find it to be lemony enough! Next time I would also use more poppy seeds than recommended.

After reading other reviews, I decided to half recipe and make only one loaf.  I followed recipe except that I only added one egg and I used freshly squeezed lemon juice and zest.  I added orange glaze as it came out of oven (after poking a few holes.)  It was wonderful!  The only problem I had was that it stuck to my loaf pan even though I liberally oiled it.  Next time I will line pan with parchment paper.  I even made lemon icing to use once it cooled but didn't need it with the orange glaze.  Go ahead and try it!

Turned out poorly - good flavor and taste, but the texture was all wrong - too dense and as if I didn't put enough flour in.  Followed the recipe exactly, so I don't know what happened there.

This is a super easy recipe.  I made it for the girls at work and they raved about it.  I got mixed reviews on whether it was lemony enough.  Some thought it was, others didn't.  My personal choice would be more lemon but to be fair, I didn't use the icing/glaze so that might have made a difference.

This is very good, but I changed it up a bit by using carrot juice instead of orange juice.  Carrot juice is sweet and adds a nice bright yellow color to this bread.  I also added a bit more poppy seeds.

Soooo tasty!  I cut back on the oil just a touch and added some lemon juice for extra kick.  Make sure to heat the orange juice when making the glaze so its nice and smooth.  This one is a keeper.

Next time i will use real lemon juice and more poppy seeds. Other than that, it was great. Don't forget if you make muffins, the cooking time is reduced.

this bread was delicous. the only thing i changed was i used a cup of oil, and then added a 1/4 cut of apple sauce, i also left out the glaze because i cant handle anything too sweet. But i made a sliced almond crumb topping instead: 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 1/2 cup of flour, 2-3 table spoons of meltd butter, 1/2 cup to a cup of sliced almonds- depending on prefrence. i also left out the extract because i didnt have it, but i added 1/2 cup lemon juice and the rind of 2 lemons and it was perfect. Tasted fabulous.

Doubled the recipe, used the juice on 2 lemons and a splash of lemon extract. Used a little extra poppy seeds. My husband loved it. It is his favorite. The lemon flavor was just right according to him. Use buttermilk if you can. Super moist.

The bread was OK, but I won't make it again.  I followed the recipe exactly, but was disappointed.  I had hoped for a better result.  The bread was very heavy--almost gooey, and the lemon flavor wasn't strong enough.  Some of my friends who tried it liked the sweetness of it, but most said they preferred more tart lemon flavor and a lighter bread/cake.

I'm giving this four because the flavor was good but it's not a perfect recipe. First off it's more like a cake or pound cake then bread- but we knew that from the amount of sugar. Secondly it only makes 2 loaves not three. Third I found the edges to be a little dark by the time the middle was done(just like in the current picture). Delicious but it's only called bread because of the loaf pan.

I made a half recipe just to try it.  As with other "bakers", I tweaked the recipe a bit; used juice and zest of a large lemon, 7 oz. Greek yogurt, and added 1/4 teas. baking soda.  I still used the flavoring of both the lemon and vanilla.  The aroma is amazing while it's baking, and tastes even better.  A true keeper for my collection.  Next time I will try making muffins and not using the syrup.

A very good recipe for quick and easy Lemon Poppy Bread.  I took advice from MommyFromSeattle and used buttermilk, real lemon juice and extra poppy seeds.  Also, I substituted tangerine for orange juice, and it turned out nice!

Just made this recipe - without the glaze - and it tastes delicious.  I cut the recipe by thirds, intending to only make 1 loaf.  It worked out okay, texture-wise, but the loaf is only about 2 inches tall.  So next time I would probably make 2/3 of the recipe so that the loaf is taller. I'll definitely make this again and next time I'll be sure to have some orange juice on-hand so I can try the glaze.

I took several suggestions from other postings and made the following changes.  I used 1/2 c. of fresh lemon juice and the zest from one lemon, 1 c. of milk, used 3 T. of poppy seeds, decreased the oil to just over 3/4 c., and cut the sugar to just 2 c.  I did not use a glaze at all, and I think the lemon flavor is just right!  Good dense texture (which I like in a bread), and not too crumbly or too sweet.  I made these 2 days ago, and it is better today than yesterday.  This would be a good base to add blueberries or raspberries to in place of the poppy seeds!  I may try that next time.  Overall, very good.

Everyone loves this! I've been asked a dozen times for the recipe. I took the advice of other reviewers and decreased the oil to about 3/4 cup, and added zest & juice from one lemon. My first batch was too dark on the bottom and sides, so I decreased the temp to 325 degrees and baked two loaves for an hour. Delicious!

Liked the fact the recipe called for oil - makes for a moist loaf.  I didn't use the glaze, the lemon flavour wasn't noticable.  Next time will try the real lemon juice with the zest as suggested previously.  Is super easy to whip up.

I used an extra tablespoon of poppyseeds - and I used lemon juice instead of the orange juice for the topping.  I ended up baking one large loaf - it came out moist and very flavourful - everyone loved it! Mmm...

I made this bread and it is delicious! Heeding the advice of other reviewers, I omitted the lemon extract and used the zest of two lemons and the juice of two and a half (because my lemons were very small). I also upped the poppyseeds to four rounded tablespoons, but only because I'm a poppyseed freak. I baked mine in a 9-inch round pan for about an hour and 10 minutes. I also didn't make the glaze because the cake is sweet enough without it. In future, I may cut down on the sugar if I want to make the glaze.

My only complaint is that the texture is quite heavy, though that may be my own fault for cutting a slice while it was still steaming hot (I couldn't help it, it smelt SO good!). The next time I make this, I may:

a: let it cool completely before cutting into it.

b: try cutting the oil in half as one reviewer suggested and mixing it only until the batter just comes together, like a muffin.

Either way though, it's still a fantastic recipe, kudos to you, Margie, and thanks for sharing!

This is really good.  I increased the lemon extract to 2 tsp, and it had a nice lemon flavor without being overpowering.  I would only use the glaze if you were serving this for dessert.  Fantastic recipe, and very easy to make.

It was really good and moist. I think i should have let the topping cool a bit more, so that it had thickened. Otherwise its all good. :)

Since my son fell in love with the lemon poppy seed bread at Caribou, I have wanted to find a recipe to make at home to satisfy his taste for it.  This bread definitely fits the bill.  I've only made it once and I made it exactly as the recipe states.  It gets a big ol' thumbs up from my son and myself.  The only thing I'm not a huge fan of is the glaze as it is in the recipe.  (The glaze is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars).  I'll probably experiment with other glazes next time I make it.  But the bread itself is great and has just the right amount of lemon flavor for our palettes.  As for quantity, I made the amount of batter that came up for the recipe but made one loaf and 12 muffins with it instead of the 3 loaves.  Seemed to come out just right.  The muffins were ready after about 35 minutes and the loaf took the whole 55 minutes.

The best I have tried, simply delicious every time!  Only change I make is doubling the seeds.

This was a delicious, lemony poppy seed bread. I'm a bit disappointed in the glaze, hence the 4 stars. I added 1/2 C lemon juice and some lemon rind to the batter. Anyway---quite tasty, and I'll be making it again!

My breads came out amazing, however, o had to make changes, which is why I'm not giving this recipe 5 stars. Real lemon, and extra poppy seeds in the bread and real lemon in the glaze. Extract tastes like cheap candy. I refuse to use it

I am just starting to bake, I love lemon poppy seed bread so I tried this. I didn't have lemon extract, but I have a lemon tree that is overflowing, so I replaced the extract with 3 Tbsp of lemon zest and I am very happy with the results. This is a wonderful bread, I made it in small pans and gave it as gifts.

Made this recipe as muffins and they were yummy!  I used a little less sugar and applesauce instead of oil which may explain why they were a little flatter and chewy, but the flavor was wonderful ( I also used the juice and rind of 1 1/2 lemons instead of extract.) will definitely make again!

I was not sure why the recipe called for baking in 3 - 8x4 pans but I followed the recipe and think they could have been baked in two 8x4 pans or a Bundt pan. It's good but next time I will double the poppy seeds, add fresh lemon juice, and bake in a bundt pan.  The sides of the bread clung to the pan and rose faster than the center as it baked - I'm not quite sure why it did that.  Perhaps the pans should be dusted with flour as well. I omitted the glaze this time. Overall it's good :)

I can't tell you how may times I have made this, since finding it on here. We prefer muffins to loaves, so I put all the batter into muffin tins, and cook for 25 min.  I have never used the glaze on these. They are so good as is. I like mine to puff up a bit more, so I add a little extra baking powder, but everything else stays the same. These are so good if you haven't tried them, it's worth the "risk."

Made as written and was looking forward to eating it for breakfast the next day.  Wow! So much sugar, I honestly got dizzy from a very small piece.  Don't eat this on an empty stomach.  I should have read the other review about cutting the sugar.  I threw out the whole batch, and I think I'll try again with less sweet this time.

I was actually very underwhelmed with this recipe.  I have a great convection oven and I actually baked this by ten minutes less than what was asked.  It came out dry and not very good.  The flavor itself was okay, but I would keep looking for another recipe if you want something worth making again.

This bread was pretty good but it definenetly needed more lemon in it. I added more then it said so and i could still hardely taste the recipe. It also didnt rise as much as i had hoped so it was a little bit flat. Overall this is a pretty good recipe.

This lemon poppy seed bread was great! Best i've ever tasted and i got so many compliments on it. I just made a couple changes. I was out of vanilla extract so i used almond extract. I also squeezed half of a large lemon into the cake batter before i poured it into the pans. For the icing, i also used almond extract and  i squeezed another half lemon into the mix. It was great!

I give this bread 3 stars with the additions of the lemon zest and some of the fresh lemon juice added.  THE GLAZE IS WAY TO SWEET!No need for extra calories and sweetness. Will try another recipe.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I made 12 large muffins and one loaf (cook muffins less time).  I made them as part of a brunch today and everyone loved them.  The glaze is a fantastic finishing touch!

Make sure that you use real lemon extract!  I didn't have any, so I tried to just use lemon juice--the flavor didn't come through at all.

Very easy to make.  This makes a very light, lemony cake.  I was looking for something a little more dense with a stronger lemon flavor, but this is an excellent recipe if you like your cake lighter in consistency.

Oh my gosh! How could anyone not give this five stars? I love the topping! Everyone keeps asking me to make it again. I just used a very large loaf pan and baked until toothpick came out clean - app. 1 hour. 10 min.

Very quick and easy to make.  This recipe makes only 2 loaves not 3, unless you want really tiny loaves.  I added some lemon zest to this recipe.  It turned out good but not lemony enough for me.  I may have to play a bit with the recipe, it was missing something.  I didn't make the glaze for the top so that may have something to do with it. I would definitely make again though! Thanks.

Very good. I will probably add more lemon extract from now on (as suggested in other reviews). I omitted the glaze and it was fine. I didn't think this was as good as the boxed mix I had been using, but my teenagers disagree with me!

Fabulous! Moist and very lemony! I added fresh lemon zest and omitted the glaze. Increased the lemon extract to 2 tsp and kept the vanilla at 1 1/2 tsp, per suggestions. Wonderful, thank you!!

I made half this recipe with 2 eggs and 1 cup of sugar. I left out the salt and lemon extract and used a fresh lemon. I included the lemon zest and lemon juice (full recipe measurement) in the mix. I baked this for an hour. For the glaze, I squeezed the rest of the juice out of my lemon.

Tasted great with the tweaks recommended by others to use buttermilk and the rind and juice of 1 lemon.  Just cut back on the lemon extract.  Next time, I’ll add more poppy seeds.

I'd say this makes 2 loafs. my husband loves it - it's dense without the poundcake buttery-ness.

The cake tastes great, but I have tried baking it in different size loaf pans with it burning each time.  I just baked a cake prior, so I know the oven is calibrated, I don’t understand why.

Absolute WINNER! I’ve made this poppy seed bread recipe many times over the last 5 years. It has continually impressed. Lots of friends and family look forward to it every year come Christmas time. I follow the recipe exactly. No need to add or subtract a thing. 

Gearing up to make 12 loaves this weekend! Hoping it will be a big success yet again!

As someone else mentioned, the texture is very off. Trying to eat it is impossible as it melts into a mushy, play dough like texture.

Made it the same as the except I used real lemon juice and zest from the lemons instead of the lemon extract, and it’s amazingly delicious. Also, instead of orange juice you could use a little bit of the lemon juice or water or milk for the glaze, and I also add almond extract to it. Such a good flavor combo.

I went rogue on this one and it didn't quite turn out- the taste was fine but it didn't rise and had a very dense, almost rubbery texture. I scaled everything down to make one loaf (7 servings instead of 20). I didn't have lemon extract so I used the zest and juice of 2 lemons. The fresh squeezed lemon juice equaled about 1/3 cup and I added about equal amounts of whole milk. I'm guessing that the ratio of lemon juice to milk(fat) was wrong, and also that I should have used a little bit more of the baking powder than the automatically adjusted amounts allowed for.  If making this for the first time, I strongly suggest following the recipe as written!

Made with olive oil and vegetable oil instead of softened butter. Also added half a cup of ricotta cheese and reduced the sugar to 3/4cup.

I couldn't eat this. I found it super dense and despite the toothpick coming out clean, it looked and felt undercooked.  The taste wasn't that great either. The only reason I'm giving it 2 star is because my 6yo loves it. Sadly most of this ended in the trash - I wasn't giving the 6yo 2 whole loaves after all.

Easy to follow and turned out great! I couldn't find lemon extract, so we added about 3+tbs of lemon zest and a little juice. Next time I am going to try adding 5tbs of zest. It was nice and lemon flavored, but a little subtle.

The bread was very flavorful without the lemon extract being over-powering  and artificial tasting.  I may try adding real lemon zest  the next time I make it.  Also, I heated the glaze just enough to dissolve the sugar.

The cake part was good, but I would halve the sugar next time. The icing was nothing like the photo and was way too sugary. I would make the cake part again with reduced sugar and either not ice it or find a different icing.

I made 2 separate batches of this bread over the weekend.  I followed a suggestion from the reviews below.  Although it tastes good, the bread was flat.  Unfortunately, I won't make this one again.

Man, this is good.  I made 3 loaves and had to cook them an hour.  Also, for the glaze I microwaved the OJ to dissolve the sugar.  And, I brushed on the glaze on the loaves twice rather than dumping it on the bread. It was perfect, making the outside a little crunchy and tangy.

3 stars but I didn't make as directed. Used half oil, half applesauce. Zested and squeezed a lemon - cut down on milk by amount of lemon (it curdles the milk).  Made 2/3 the recipe since only had 2 eggs - only made 1 loaf.  Took over an hour.  Made glaze of bottled lemon juice in place of oj. The glaze was lemony but bread wasn't unfortunately.

Made the bread combining the recommendation of less sugar, real lemon juice and buttermilk. Bread was a hit at my work potluck although i thought it was a bit heavy and dense.

Very good. I also followed other recommendations- 
I increased to 3 tablespoons of poppy seeds;
decreased to 2 cups sugar;
decreased to 1 cup oil;
increased to 2 teaspoons vanilla;
used 1/2 cup lemon juice instead of extract.

My glaze was warmed OJ with powdered sugar, no extract.

And, I baked it in a bundt pan at 350 for ~1hr 15mins and just kept a eye on it.

Fabulous! Easy!  I made this into minimuffins (10mins at 350). Recipe made 60 minimuffins. Only variations, I tripled poppyseeds (personal preference) and glazed the muffins with powdered sugar and fresh lemon juice. Thanks for sharing, delicious!  Friends gave them rave reviews.

I just made this, one pan with poppy seed's and one without. Dense is an understatement, it was like the consistency of thick brownies when it was done. I don't know what I did but  I ended up with two half loaves, definitely not enough for 3. I thought it would be the same size as a regular loaf of banana bread but it was 1/2 the size. 

Very disappointed, I ended up throwing it out.

My husband is a big fan of lemon poppy seed. I made one big loaf and 3 mini loaves. I ended up freezing them so my husband could have slices of it throughout the week for breakfast. It freezes really well.

WOW this bread is good! We made a half recipe and baked a dozen muffins for about 16 minutes. Also used buttermilk and about 1/4 c. or lemon juice. Drizzled on the icing recipe from one reviewer- 1/4 c. orange juice, lemon extract and 5 tbsp. powdered sugar. They were moist, dense, sweet, and cake- like. Thanks for the great recipe!

My husband and I both thought this was delicious! So moist and way more like cake then bread:). I did not use the glaze, I didn't have orange juice on hand but it was still very moist and great without it. I had a problem getting it out of the pans (I used 2) and small part of the bottom was stuck but that was probably me not the recipe.

Delicious!  I made 12 muffins and 2 loaves but I think I should have just put the loaves batter all in one.  The 2 were just too thin.  I used 1 squeezed lemon for the batter instead of the lemon extract.  I cooked the muffins for about 27 mins and the loaves for 45 but I think the loaves cooked a bit too long.  I would cut it down by at least 5 mins unless I do 1 loaf instead of the two.

Very easy to make! I made a few changes. Per many people's advice, I added more poppy seeds (almost 3 tablespoons total) and rather than use lemon extract, I used the zest and juice of one real lemon. I am a huge fan of lemon poppy seed anything but didn't think it was quite lemony enough, will add the juice of two lemons next time. I used whole meal flour and cut the oil in half (that was planty, I was glad I'd cut the oil!) and used olive oil instead. Also, I used Splenda instead of sugar which was fine for the bread but made the glaze sticky like glue. Will keep working on the glaze. Everyone loved this recipie and will make it again!!

I didn't think the batter would be enough for three loaves as stated so I poured it into two. Didn't want three thin loaves. Well, it seemed that the outside cooked faster than the inside when the tester came out a tad sticky. But, I let it cool and when I sliced into the loaves they were moist, dense and flavorful. I wished I tried the glaze but my hubby said it was fine the way it was. Sweet enough already. Looked beautiful piled high in two loaf pans. I might try it again in three, but I'm not sure since these were fine.

Great moist loaf. I usually increase poppy seeds a bit, and add a tbsp lemon juice to the batter, and forgo the glaze. Yum!
