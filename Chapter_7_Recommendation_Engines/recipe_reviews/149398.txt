This is the first time I have ever had homemade syrup. We thought it was pretty good.I might even try adding a little butter next time.The first thing my 8 year old said was "that was awesome give me some more."It was a nice change from the same old boring maple syrup...since I doubled the recipe (to make sure there was plenty) I put the remaining syrup in an empty syrup bottle and placed it in the fridge. That seemed to work fine then you just microwave it for 10-20 seconds to warm it up the next time.

This was really good.  Like another reviewer, the rating is only 4 because of the "gloop" factor...  it was a little stringy and had to be spread over pancakes a little...  The flavor was really tasty, but will try without the flour next time.  I added just a touch of butter as this cooked to give it some richness but otherwise followed the recipe.  Big thank you to whichever reviewer suggested putting this in coffee...  it really did give it that cinnamon dolce flavor my husband loves from the coffee place.

I made this exactly according to the recipe and it turned out perfectly. I am in Italy, so it is difficult (or impossible) to find alot of the ingredients we use in America for cooking. This recipe was basic and simple, and it was delicious. It was particularly sweet, but if you are a sweet tooth (like my boyfriend) you will love it. We had this on pancakes, dutch babies, and i even put a little in the frying pan when I was frying up breakfast sausages and they came out with a salty/sweet flavor (sort of like the pre-packaged maple flavored sausages back home) - delicious!

I added a pinch of salt that I always add to anything sweet, added less white and more brown sugar, and a 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract because it always enhances the aroma for me. I am glad someone had an idea for a syrup that doesn't contain high fructose corn syrup.Very nice indeed!

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because we enjoyed it very much.  I wanted to make waffles, but had no maple syrup.  Keep in mind that it's very sweet, so you don't have to use too much. It kept well in the refrigerator too.

This is a quick and easy recipe.  I left the stove for a about 20 seconds while the mixture was over the heat and it started to harden quickly to the bottom of the pan!  Don't leave while preparing.  My kids really liked it!

this recipe was great :) I used all brown sugar to make it darker.  Not too cinnamon-y, just right.

Amazing! So much better than store bought syrup and no high fructose corn syrup. I let it cool and put it in an old syrup bottle. It does not need to be refrigerated - another plus over other homemade recipes I've tried.

I ran out of store bought syrup, and found this recipe.  It was delicious on our french toast!  Thank you so much for the recipe; we will never eat store bought syrup again.

Good syrup! Made this to go with Waffles I (OneShyOfABunch) because I was looking for somethig a little different than the "usual" maple syrup. What a pleasant surpirse! This DOES taste like the gooey filling of a cinnamon roll!!! As Inhbp recommended, I too allowed everything to come to a rolling boil before timing. I left my pot alone for a few minutes, then whisked for a couple of minutes, then left for a couple of minutes, etc. until I achieved the consistency desired (it took a while tho...). I had no issues with my syrup sticking or hardening, but I did use non-stick cookware. I think next time I'll add a little butter as many reviewers suggest that this adds richness and improves the syrup's consistency / reduces stickiness (although as I mentioned before, I had no issues with the latter even without it). Thanks for sharing such an easy recipe, A.S.G. Not only is this yummy, it also uses basic ingredients any well-stocked pantry should have on hand. This is no substitute for the "real" deal, but it's darn good anyways. :) I can't WAIT to try this on pumpkin or gingerbread waffles or even pancakes for that matter! :-)

This is definitely a great tasting alternative to regular syrup. Although, ours turned out super thick and as someone else described -- "gloopy." My husband and I liked it enough to make it again, but we will for sure try some of the other reviewers' suggestions for changes, such as cornstarch instead of flour.

I took other reviewers advice and added a half tablespoon of butter right after I took it off the stove. My husband took one bite and announced we would never buy syrup at the store again!

Woo hoo! I'm the 100th reviewer. I loved this recipe and it was easy to customize when I didn't have regular table (maple) syrup. I made 3 recipes off of this recipe. The 1st was this one. I doubled the recipe because of company but added 1/2 tsp more cinnamon to the double batch...love cinnamon. It was so delish! Then making strawberry syrup & French Vanilla Butter syrup too. yum yum yummmm!! TY

Yummy and so easy! I replaced the white sugar with splenda to reduce the calories. This is so tasty on pancakes, and I also put in my oatmeal. I love to make food for my family that is so good, and free of toxic preservatives.

This syrup went wonderfully with pancakes and bananas, topped with whipped cream and a dash of nutmeg. It was very easy to make, and it has kept pretty well in my fridge for about a week. If you combine the leftovers with some milk and heat it up, then add it to strong coffee, you get a Cinnamon Dolce Latte!
The only downside is the texture once it's been in the fridge long enough to get really cold. It has the consistency of an egg white. So eat it all while it's hot!

I made this syrup today and it was wonderful! It was so delicious that it made my husband and I feel to eat pancakes all day! I made some changes though....I doubled the cinnamon, added alittle butter and a pinch of salt ( as recommended by several reviewers.) Thanks to this site I no longer use store bought pancake mixes and now I can proudly say that I would no longer buy store bought syrup! Thanks!

As is, the flavor was good but pretty one-dimensional.  It just tasted sweet... very very sweet.  I added butter to mellow that, and with the butter I would rate it as 5 stars.

We have made cinnamon syrup for years.  I lost my original recipe so have been winging it and it just hasn't been that great.  So I found this one and it is even better than the original one I had.  Perfect!  We had this with crepes, but usually have cinnamon syrup on pancakes.

I followed this recipe exactly and hated it. it wasn't necessarily gross i was able to eat what i had put on my french toast, but it was really really bland!! mayeb it's just opinon, or maybe im just use to another homemade recipe for peanut butter pancake syrup that is FULL of flavor, btu this was so lacking for me, not sure why it went so well for everyone else.

Rich, spicy syrup.  Perfect for pumpkin pancakes and waffles, but we also put this on our apple butter spice cake, and it was delicious.

I made this exactly as written the first time and it turned out beautifully.  Not "gloopy" at all.  I did take it off of the heat as soon as it began to look syrupy - which was not long at a boil - maybe 4 minutes.  It was really really sweet - next time I'll add salt to the mixture.

Very easy and delicious. It's a lot sweeter than your typical maple syrup. Goes perfectly with the "Pumpkin Pie French Toast Recipe" on here.

Went well with pumpkin pancakes. I only used 1 tablespoon of flour and the consistency of the syrup was perfect for my tastes.

Note: I have also tried 1/2 tablespoon of flour, but that wasn't quite enough.

It's a keeper! I just used half the flour, but probably could've used all. You just have to watch it closely. I also added a tablespoon butter when I took it off the heat as other reviewers suggested because I do the same for my peanut butter fudge and it makes all the difference in the smoothness of the texture. Don't worry if it looks like the butter is globbing up, it melts out and stirs in eventually. We served these over pumpkin pankcakes and everyone LOVED it!

Just ran out of a bottle of brand named syrup and decided to not waste my money on something that is rather sweet but still tasteless.

This syrup is awesome on ANYTHING. I'm planning on making it for my daycare since I can use it without kids being allergic to it. I kept the old syrup bottle and doubled the recipe, exactly 750mL's. I DID use cornstarch instead of flour and I added at the end 2 tbsp of butter to deepen the color and it became even better.

I took an extra step and added 1/2 cup chopped pecans that I had toasted in a frying pan with 1 tablespoon of butter... Yum!  Gave a nice touch of crunch  :)   I didn't add the pecans until after the syrup had started to thicken slightly.  My family loved it, too!

This was good over french toast.  We love cinnamon so I increased the amount to 1 tsp.  This thickened really fast - it was thick almost as soon as it came to a boil.

Incredible! The perfect syrup for pancakes but also works great for sweetening up tons of other things. Try it in sweet potato casserole, topping off apple crumb cake, or other recipes that call for cinnamon.

I poured this syrup over the Mom's Applesauce Pancakes recipe.  It was an excellent combination.  I went with a previous suggestion to not use the flour.  Didn't miss it.  The syrup had great consistency.  Very healthy alternative to commercial syrup.

Ever tried Starbucks Caramel Apple Cider? This is part of the recipe! Just buy freshly pressed Apple cider, normally located in your produce department. Make this recipe, mix it into your Apple cider and add a little Salted Caramel coffee syrup, heat to your desired degree, top with whipped cream and wah-la. Its great to mix altogether in the crock pot on high with a few cinnamon sticks for a fall or winter gathering. Want to spike it? Add caramel vodka ;-).

This recipe is great! Although I did tweak it a little.  I used cornstarch in place of the flour, almond extract in place of the vanilla extract. I was looking for a banana topping recipe for pancakes, without much luck.  I found this one and decided to just add bananas at the end after I removed it from the heat.  I added three bananas, cut in half lengthwise, and then quartered. It was wonderful. I brought this to a Mardi Gras pancake brunch at our church, and it was a hit! Thank you for a great recipe.

Living in Africa means expensive and not so good syrup, so I had hoped this would work.  It is EXCELLENT.  The whole house smelled like cinnamon rolls, and I owe a big thank you to the reviewer who suggested stiring this into coffee.  It tasted like a cinnamon carmel latte.

Made to serve over pancakes this morning.  Took one reviewers suggestion and used cornstarch instead of flour; otherwise followed directions as written.  It was wonderful!!    I had some leftover; so I heated in microwave on medium for a short time and served over some pear and apple slices as part of our lunch.  Equally as good.  Will double the recipe next time.  Definitely a keeper at this house.  Thanks so much for sharing, A.S.G.

Great flavor!  I used 1 1/2 T. flour and the thickness was good.  I might use corn starch just to make it clear rather than cloudy.  Loved the taste though!

Whole family loved it.  I followed other people's feedback and used only 1 TBS of flour and added 1 TBS of butter.  It was awesome and a great consistancy.  Will be making in the future, for sure!

Myself, I can't eat sweet things like that so I stick to low sugar items. Thanks so much for an added fav to my recipe box!

Wonderful syrup! I made this for another recipe here called Pumpkin Pie French Toast and the combo was fabulous! I didn't use white sugar because of diabetes in our house but used Stevia Cup for Cup instead. It turned out a little too sweet but still very yummy!

This was AWESOME!  After having a "Cinna-Stack" at IHOP, I found this recipe and had to make my own homemade version!  This was thin enough to be the only syrup you need with some super fluffy pancakes and really turns breakfast into sweet treat!  I acutally stored the excess in a plastic squeeze bottle in the fridge and it lasted a few weeks just fine.  I always make sure I have some on hand now because pancakes without it just aren't the same!

Awesome Syrup! It came out thicker than a regular store bought syrup, But I like the consistency. I made it to complement ricotta cheese pancakes, and it was great. I am sure it would be great for anything... Thanks! :)
UPDATE: This syrup was in my fridge for about a month! And it is still good! I just had to mix it well with a spoon, and its the same consistency as before!

Flavor was good.  Maybe a  little too cinnamony but still very good.  Was excellent when first made and used on pankcakes but after sitting and cooling it did clump up and was not as appealing.  Warmed it and it was okay.  Will definitely make again.

Flavor was great! I messed up by cooking on too high of a heat which carmelized the syrup. It was great as an apple dip while it was hot, but was gritty the next day when I heated it up. Next time I will boil it on a much lower heat.

I give this 4.5 stars, as it was good and easy to make!  I used 1/2 tsp orange extract instead of vanilla and next time will only use 1-1/2 TBLS flour, as it came out a little too thick for me.  Had this on top of gingerbread waffles with chopped pecans, very good!

Cinnamon Syrup   	 	 I followed the recipe exact. Then I added small diced apple pieces while it was heating. Then I put really thin slices of apple on my french toast topping it with the cinnamon syrup with apple bits! It was excellent.... thanks for the thought. :)

Delish!!! I love that this syrup is  made from ingredients that most people have readily available in their pantries.  It keeps well in a sealed container, and is a much cheaper & tastier alternative to buying maple syrup, which is really expensive where I live.

Such an easy and tasty syrup! We love it! This time I stirred in 1/8 tsp. almond extract after I removed it from the heat, and a couple of shakes of salt. It was fabulous! I only boil it for about 5 minutes so it doesn't get too thick.

The first time I made this, the syrup was decent but not great. The second time I made it, I scaled it to 6 servings and added a teaspoon of butter.  That gave it a richer taste that was definitely better!  Keep in mind that it will thicken as it cools, so stop cooking when it's still a little thin.  If it coats the back of the spoon pretty well, it's probably ready.
Update: This is a good base recipe for lemon syrup! I used all white sugar, replaced half the water with lemon juice, and subbed lemon extract for vanilla. Delicious!

I used this more as a base recipe when I really wanted waffles but really didn't want to go to the store to buy syrup. In addition to the cinnamon, I added cloves, nutmeg, cardamom, and ginger for more of a pumpkin spice type of flavor. It still tasted a little flat, though, so I added maybe a scant tablespoon of butter to it, which made it perfect. It turned out a bit too thick, so I thinned it with a bit of water. These were great on the waffles, but I think it'd also be great on apple desserts or even coffee or tea.

Maybe some of the "gloopy" results are that the recipe doesn't really state what temp the syrup should be cooked at.  I cooked mine over medium, and turned off the heat as soon as the rolling boil covered the surface.  It resulted in a really nice texture - not too thin or thick.  I added about 1T of butter to finish it, and because it was so sweet I mixed in a couple pinches of salt which really woke up the flavor.  This is definitely my go-to over store-bought, non-maple syrup.  I will still reach for pure maple syrup for most stacks of pancakes, but this is a nice alternative, and would be extra good on pumpkin pancakes or french toast.

Excellent .  No changes , except  I  used1 tbs flour and added 1 tabsp. of butter mixed  in  just  before  serving  as others  suggested.  Husband said we don't need to buy anymore of that "store  bought stuff  ".  Kiddos literally licked the plate. I made it  3 times   because  everyone  wanted  seconds and there were  five eating.  

The last time  I  made  it  I  used  only brown  sugar.  Seemed even more smoother to me. I don't know  why  some said  it  was  globby or crunchy.  But it may have to  do  with  temperature  and  cooking  time. You  will  want  to  cook this  over  medium  low to medium  heat . Once you  see it boil, turn it  to medium low. Stir  often. Thickens quick.  Thickens more when cooling.   

Also, I used a fork to thoroughly wisk ingredients  in pot before  I began  rolling  boil.  Hope this  helps.  This  is  an  awesome  recipe. Thanks  for  sharing .

Great substitute for REAL maple syrup.  I ran out of the real stuff from my family's maple sugar bush and will not use the chemical laden fake stuff.  This is almost as good as the real thing and so much better than the artificial maple syrup and no chemicals or artificial flavors.  My family liked it.  In fact I don't think the kids even noticed it wasn't the real thing until I told them.

This is delicious.  My daughter said, "OOO Mom, I don't like syrup".  Then when she smelled it cooking she was like, "UMMM, think I might try me some of that stuff you are cooking".  LOL.  It was a big hit with daughter and grand daughters.

This is really good but the flour gives it a weird consistency specially when it cools down it's like thick jelly not syrup and i have to heat it every time before i use. I recommend not using flour it's way better.

Used all brown sugar minus a half cup and used 1Tb corn starch in place of flour and added 1.5Tb butter after taking off burner. Kids loved it and said, it tastes like cinnamon rolls. So easy that Tweens and teens have no problem making on their own.  Triple recipe if you want to use more than once. Thank you

The flavor was good, simple to make. Next time I will not add flour/cornstarch. It ended up looking more like a glaze rather than syrup.

This is a very tasty recipe! Would have given it 5 stars if not for the strange consistency but it did taste great.  Had it with waffles but didn't quite have enough so we spread this on them and the drizzled a little maple syrup (homemade) on top also and the combination of the two was delicious!

This am I made the syrup and successfully made it with Splenda white and brown; no problem.  I would like for it to have been a little clearer so may use corn starch next time.  Did not like the cinnamon so will omit that and go to another recipe with maple flvaoring but will still use the Splenda.  Just wanted everyone to know it can be done sugar-free.

Excellent recipe. I followed other suggestions and used cornflour rather than AP flour. Also, I am lucky enough to have several cinnamon trees in my yard so scraped some bark and placed a 2 inch piece in pot while syrup was cooking.  Also added extra ground cinnamonand large dab of butter. This is a keeper!!!  Thank you

Very quick easy and delicious! Reminds me of the middle of a cinnamon roll but not quite as cinnamoney. ( I know it's not a word! lol) We also made one of the pancake recipes to go with it on a whim... Yum-o!

Loved it! Simple and yummy. Followed directions and it turned out perfectly. I took it off the heat as soon as it turned from light brown to dark brown. I love how it almost has a foamy texture. It's different and perfect when you don't have maple extract.

It was ok.  Boiling it for the suggested time I found it poured to thick. May try again to make a little thinner, but I'll probably try another recipe first.

I have a tendency to burn my pots and pans so I melted this really slow on low and then increased the temp until it was a rolling boil. Perfect! Served with Finnish Kropser (Baked Pancakes).

I created an account on allrecipes because of this recipe. I loved it! I live in Haiti and syrup is very expensive at the grocery store.

This syrup is delicious and easy to make.  I especially liked having syrup that wasn't maple flavored. I put more cinnamon than the recipe called for, and it was fine. The consistency was perfect, and I didn't have any issues with it hardening or sticking to the pan. I'll store the left overs in a glass jar in the fridge and heat it by putting the jar in hot water. I can't wait to try it in coffee!

I LOVE homemade syrups, and this is one of my new favorites. If you reduce the cook time a bit, you don't wind up with the goopiness reported by other reviewers, just watch it carefully. I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out PERFECTLY. Oh my stars. SO. GOOD.

Pretty yummy.  My dad makes a homemade syrup that's pretty thin which my kids wanted to duplicate, so we used only 1 Tbsp of flour.  I thought the consistency was right on, although I might add a little butter next time both for the flavor and the texture.

Yummy Stuff! Reminds me a little of the IHOP pancake syrup on the 'cinna Cakes'!! I live in Austria, so I am unable to get these delicious variations of syrups and pancakes at restaurants, so I make everything myself! Happy I found this one! Thanks for Sharing!

Great syrup. I tried the corn starch instead of flour...makes more sense to me in a syrup, for some reason. I also added a few shakes of salt, and 1 1/2 T. butter. This puts Aunt Jamima to shame!

I added 2 TBS butter and doubled the cinnamon. We will never buy maple syrup again. It's like licking the filling out of a cinnamon roll. The butter helps the consistency so it's not gloopy, like some people complained.

This was just OK for me.  It seemed too watered down in taste.  I prefer the Cinnamon Cream Syrup on this site.  Much more flavor.

Try this on the Pumpkin Pancakes from this sight - you'll be soooo glad you did.  It highlights the pumpkin flavor beautifully.  It is very thick, but I like it as is.  Still, if you're concerned about spread-ability, go ahead and reduce the flower.  If you're using it on pumpkin pancakes you can also add a little nutmeg and/or ginger powder.  I use 1/4 tsp nutmeg and just sprinkle ginger in.

I made this to go with Veronica's Apple Pancakes and it was so delicious and very easy to make. It would also be good over some vanilla ice cream, waffles, French toast or crepes.

This syrup was just ok for us, i even added a tbl. of butter.  While it has a nice cinnamon flavor, it would serve better as a glaze for a coffee cake than a syrup for pancakes. It tasted exactly like the syrup that is at the bottom of baked apples.  I would like to try it again with maple extract,  to see if that would make it a syrup for us.

I made this syrup today for the first time and it came out wonderfully! I stirred everything together then turned on the heat. Once it got to a rolling boil, I left it for about four minutes. I poured the syrup out and left it while making the pancakes. Wonderful! It is however a bit thick, so I would cut off some flour next time.

Not bad! I let my 11 year old make this while my ten year old made the pancakes. Very nice flavor. Not thick at all though.

*Note: I just made this for the second time. I multiplied the ingredients by 4 and it made enough syrup to fill one and half standard syrup bottles.

I gave this four stars only because I tried some of the suggestions that others mentioned. Instead of flour I used 2 Tbls of corn starch mixed with 2Tbls cold water and added during the boiling point.  I also added about 1 Tbls butter at the very end.  It was very delicious.

Good and easy to make. It was the perfect match for the apple-cinnamon pancakes I was making. My husband usually passes on the homemade syrups I've tried but he loved this one.

This was a quick fix when I made pancakes and ran out of syrup. Surprisingly it wasn't sickenly sweet. I guess I cooked it just right because it was the perfect consistency.  If it's too thick then it must have been cooked too long.

Extremely easy and turned out delicious.  Once it came to a rolling boil, I cooked this over medium heat while I made a pancake batter (which took a while!) to ensure that it would be nice and thick.  It turned out perfectly, and I never had trouble with it sticking or burning (I used a non-stick saucepan).

This is an easy alternative to maple syrup. My family love it.  I served it on gingerbread waffles (from this web site) but it would be great on any kind of waffles.  It would be good on apple pie a la mode also.

I've made this syrup several times and it is quick and easy.  Everybody loves it.  I even made it for breakfast after my daughter's slumber party and several of the mom's called for the recipe because their kids raved about it.  The only reason I give it a four is because it becomes very thick and slightly goopy.  But the kids like to spread it on their pancake. And the flavor is awesome.

This is the first time I tried making homemade syrup, and this recipe was simple and easy to follow.  I thought this syrup was good, I cut down a little on the cinnamon because I am not a huge cinnamon fan.  I still prefer real maple syrup, but this is a nice recipe to have when there is no maple syrup around!

We all loved it!!! I realized  I was out of syrup when I mixed up the pancake batter *party foul* I cut the recipe in half since we were trying it out and there were only 3 of us. It was the perfect amount for  a 10-12 pancakes amount of batter. The kids were disappointed when we were out of batter. 
We'll be using this again...soon.

I have been making this recipe for several years, my family loves it and there is seldom any left over.  This recipe also makes a delicious vanilla syrup - just omit the cinnamon and add an additional 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of vanilla.

I thought it was really good on the pancakes I made and put peanut butter on. The texture to me was perfect it came out just like regular syrup. However the flavor was a bit weird kind of too sweet but lacking something. Even with that being said I would make this again.

This is ok in flavor, but too thick for pancake syrup. I think the flour could be cut in half.

This came together fast, good in a pinch if you run out of syrup. I did not add the vanilla extract until I took it off the heat so it would not boil off, I also added some Butter extract to give more flavour. My sons enjoyed it over Apple Pancakes for Shrove Tuesday. I would add some butter next time.

I thought this came out great as written. Saving it for further use. Thank you for sharing this recipe.  Have to really watch it when it’s boiling, boil it too long and you’ll probably end up with a taffy candy instead of syrup.

My 16 year old found this recipe and makes it to go with the pumpkin pancake recipe from this site. It is delicious and smells so good when it's cooking! I even freeze it and the pancakes (separately) in single portions for my daughter who is at college to use. She says they are just like they were made that day.

This was more of a sweet "gravy" than a syrup, then again maybe I'm too used to that fake maple syrup everyone grew up with. It wasn't that it was not tasty it just wasn't my thing.

This was a great base for syrup, I double the recipe, I used cornstarch in place of the flour, added more cinnamon and a tablespoon of butter. It is the only syrup I plan on making.

I subsitute 1/2 cup of brown sugar  for 1/2 cup of white sugar to get more of the flavor out of the brown sugar while still using white sugar. The syrup is a little goopy but tastes phenomenal. If you're a heavy flavor person, you're going to want to add a looooot more cinnamon. I also added a sprinkling of clove and ginger to mine but that's my own personal preference. It came out wonderful and I poured it over sweet potatoes waffles!

wanted French toast, but had no syrup.   found this and had all the needed ingredients.   I did alter a little.  some complaints were it was too thick.  I added a couple tablespoons of milk, cut the flour to 1 1/2 tablespoon and put a tablespoon of butter in.  it became really smooth.   even when cold it is the perfect syrup consistency.   we put it on top of vanilla ice cream for dessert.   we are all hooked.

Super easy recipe. Great on French toast! The consistency is perfect as long as you constantly stir and keep checking it.  I kept taking small spoonfuls and putting it in another cup and cool a bit to check the consistency. Otherwise it's difficult to tell. And if you boil it too long, it will get too thick.

sooooo good. I added nutmeg and clove because I love them, and it was delicious. I cooked the syrup sliiiightly to long so it came out a touch gloopy but that was my bad. I saved the remainder in a syrup bottle and was a bit nervous but I just had it again about a month and a half later and it's just as good as it was the day of.

I've tried several recipes for cinnamon syrup and this is the one I always go back to. With a few minor modifications its excellent. My family likes a strong cinnamon flavor so first I boil the water for a few minutes with a few cinnamon sticks in there and then double the ground cinnamon. It's excellent!

I've been wanting to make a simple syrup for my iced coffee and was pleasantly surprised by this recipe! I did omit the flour as others suggested and added a pinch of salt. I can see my family using this stuff for endless recipes! (And it made my house smell great!)

This is the first time I've ever made a syrup because I was always too afraid I would burn the syrup or it would come out too watery. This recipe is so easy and the syrup consistency is perfect! I stirred it constantly and added about 1 T of butter. I also  doubled the amount of cinnamon and the flavor was great! It is definitely a sweet syrup but it worked perfect on the French toast I served it with. Definitely a 5 star rating for me!

I loved this recipe. This was my first time making homage syrup and it turned out great! I add more cinnamon than it said but it didn't look like that would be enough. I was right. The amount I put in was enough. I love cinnamon, so I added more so the cinnamon would have a bold flavor, so it depends on how bold you want the cinnamon flavor to be.

Ran out of store bought syrup this morning so jumped on the computer to see if I could make some. This was simple and delicious. I don't think I'll be buying syrup again when it is so easy to make your own. Made banana pancakes and this cinnamon syrup was fantastic with them.

I followed this recipe to a T and it came out great! I am currently overseas in Africa with my hubby, so we have to get creative every now and then since lots of items can't be purchased here (syrup being one of them). After letting the syrup boil, I chopped up an apple and tossed it in to cook. It was sooo good!! The syrup was thick and reminded me of cinnamon roll icing! My hubby loved it so much that I now have to make this syrup every weekend! Thanks!

My guy made this to accompany our 10 Grain Pancakes (Bob's Red Mill), and it was a huge hit. Cinnamon flavor was good without being overpowering, and reminded a couple of our kids of cinnamon rolls. Even our somewhat picky eater raved!

So yummy!! I pretty much spread it on our pancakes bc it was too thick to drizzle. My boys, 2 & 4, loved it too. Now I'm wondering how do I store it?? No refrigeration needed??

Crazy good!   I used cornstarch instead of flour like someone else did.  I only used 1 tablespoon and it was a little thin, so I'm going to up it to 1 and 1/2 TB next time.  Great recipe!

We enjoyed this syrup very much.  Because other complained of their syrup being too thick, I used only 1 tablespoon of flour and it was just right.  But my plan was to thin it with a bit of maple syrup, but it wasn't necessary.  I also added 1 tablespoon of butter per other reviewer's suggestions.  We used this syrup on Veronica's Apple Pancakes also on this site.  A great Fall breakfast!

This recipe was perfect, I used it to make Starbucks' Caramel Apple Spice drink at home. I would suggest it to anyone who loves hot apple cider. 

16oz Apple Juice 
2 Tablespoons of this syrup 
1 Tablespoon of Caramel Syrup 
=Absolute Fall Perfection.

Great syrup, a must try!  I followed the directions exactly except for the flour, I used 2T corn starch instead as some people suggested.  It was a little hard to spread for me, but the taste was great.  My boyfriend called it "addictive" and it definitely saved my not so great homemade pancakes LOL.

This syrup has a great flavor. I had read the other reviews about it being thick so I made sure to cook to the runny consistency of maple syrup. After cooling for 10 minutes as the recipe states it was about the consistency of bought pancake syrup but a much better flavor.

This was sooo good. I was out of regular syrup and needed to find a recipe that did not need maple flavoring. My kids all loved it including my child who normally hates syrup. Some people seemed to have trouble with it getting too thick. It thickens a little while it sits so, if anything, cook it until the consistency is a little thinner than normal table syrup.

I tired this recipe after I'd made a batch of GORGEOUS pancakes and much to my dismay, I looked in the cabinet and saw.... NO SYRUP!  This recipe was fantastic!  I had everything I needed to whip up a good-sized batch and I'm not sure how I'll ever be able to go back to store bought syrup again.

My family loved this syrup!! The only change I made was to use sugar in the raw, rather than white sugar. I love the way cinnamon makes my kitchen smell...especially this time of year! Thanks for sharing.

My roommate and I had this with some banana pancakes and they were amazing. Planning on using the leftovers in a berry glaze pie. I used about a tbsp more sugar than called for and about 1/4 tsp more cinnamon.

I live in Turkey and pancakes is not a standard thing here. Pancake syrup is imported and a bottle of Aunt Jemima's is 22 dollars. Prepared this syrup the instant I saw. Added 2 tablespoons of butter. Everyone loved it. Not too sweet and really good cinnamon flavor.

This was okay.  I think the vanilla was a bit overpowering.  Cut back the amount of vanilla and increase the cinnamon.

This is a fantastic recipe for homemade syrup.  We prefer it without the cinnamon and it still turns out wonderful.  This is a weekend regular recipe for us to use for pancakes.  Thanks for sharing!

This syrup is really good! My son and I ate this with french toast and I have to say, I may never eat maple syrup on french toash again! Yes, it's sweet, but what syrup isn't? I was also pleased that I could easily split the recipe in half so that I didn't have to make quite as much for just 2 of us.

This was my first time actually making syrup! This syrup was really easy to make and it tasted good it was just a little bit too thick for me. Really dark and thick and over masked the flavor of the pumpkin waffles i made it with. I probably won't make this again but if you like thick syrup you'll definitely like it. I LOVED the cinnamon flavor to it.

Great, easy and simple syrup recipe. I added my own flavour by substituting it with Maple tea by infusing the tea leaves into it. It gave the syrup the maple flavour I was craving.

The think I like most about this recipe is that I can usually whip it up from things I already have on hand.  This is what prompted me to make it in the first place.  Now, it is so easy, tasty, and convenient, it's the only syrup we use for breakfast

This is pretty good. I was surprised at how it tasted. I am a real maple syrup girl so for me to like anything but that on my pancakes is amazing.I used this on pumpkin pancakes and it was great.  It does get thick as it cools but I just reheated it. Thanks!
