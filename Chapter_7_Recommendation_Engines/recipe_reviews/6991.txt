This recipe yields a good quality bread with relatively little time commitment. Although my all-time favorite rosemary focaccia recipe is the "Acme Herb Slab" this is an excellent substitute if you do not have hours/days to commit to the craft. It yields a soft bread with a lightly crisp crust and tender crumb. I added 1 tsp garlic powder and 1/4 tsp black pepper along with double the fresh rosemary. It smelled wonderful in the oven and looked professional when baked. The uses of this bread are plenty...pizza crust, breadsticks, sandwich bread, etc. I work as a professional baker and am something of a bead snob, but I was impressed by the results of this recipe.:-)

This is a wonderful recipe, but when I punched down the dough, I added Italian spice and parm to it so it was in the bread. This prevented the spices from darkening on top. I serve it with a plate of balsamic vinegar and olive oil for dipping...mmmm! I recommend this to everyone.

One thing: you can use a glass or metal bowl to mix this bread, doesn't really have to be stoneware. This is a good, basic focaccia.

I didn't have the olive oil, I didn't let it raise twice & I didn't use the rosemary on top - used garlic & italian seasoning.  IT WAS GREAT!!! My mind is spinning with the things I can use this recipe for - bread sticks that taste like Monical's for one!! Great Jack!

It was great!  As I always recommend, it doesn't hurt to add a little REAL garlic to both the dough and the topping.  I serve with garlic butter.  In a small skillet, heat 2 tbs olive oil over medium heat. Add 3 cloves of garlic, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1 tsp pepper and cook, sizzling gently for about 2 min., stirring occasionally. The garlic should soften and become fragrant but not brown. Put 1/4 cup unsalted butter in a small bowl and pour the oil and garlic over it. Blend until smooth enough to spread evenly.

This focaccia is truly delicious.  I topped it with white cheddar and chopped jalapenos.  The "hot water in a cold oven" trick seems to be the key to getting it really tender and moist.  I left the water in the oven even as focaccia was baking.

I was searching for a recipe to make the same delicious focaccia that they serve with ceasar salad in the restaurants, and this recipes FAR exceeded my expectations. Truly delicious!  I used dried rosemary and added it to the flour mixture right from the start along with an italian spice mix and a couple cloves of crushed garlic, this made the bread very flavourful and aromatic! Yummy! My 3 year old even loves it!

Wonderful, impressive, easy.  It will help you win friends and influence people.  This is a delicious appetizer or snack when you top it with caramelized red onions and crumbled Gorgonzola cheese.

The first 2 times I made this with instant yeast & both times were excellent. However, the 3rd time I used active dry yeast. I had to wait longer for the yeast to activate & rise. In addition, I had to add an extra 1/2 cup of both bread & all purpose flour. Definitely recommend instant yeast over active dry yeast for keep it simple & to cut time. Regardless, my family really enjoys this bread!

I didn't have bread flour, so I just used AP flour and it turned out fine. I also only had dried rosemary. I added some garlic powder in the dough, and pressed in the rosemary so it wouldn't burn. We had it with penne and marinara and it was a great addition to an otherwise kind of boring meal. The bread was very soft inside with a light crust outside. Other than the ingredient swaps, I made it exactly as prescribed, and I will definitely make it again soon. Maybe use it for a pizza dough next time?

I have a personal recipe for focaccia, but it takes some time to make and decided to try this when I seen it. I never have instant yeast in the house, so I made it with active dry yeast. I mixed it in with the sugar and water and let it sit for about ten minutes. the outcome of the focaccia I made was very soft. I believe it was from using the active dry and proofing it first, but I actually liked the different texture. I don't normally have fresh rosemary so I subbed 1/2 the amount of dry, with about 3 scant teaspoons, and chopped it well. I have a jelly roll pan which seemed to be the perfect size for this. When done I cut it into 8 pieces and then cut them in half diagonally. Thanks, for the really quick recipe for a flavorful bread.

excellent!  Make sure and use milk instead of water; traditionally, Italian breads use milk for their liquid.

This is the BEST focaccia - I made it tonight and it was devoured within minutes :D Very easy to make, tastes SO good and has the perfect focaccia texture. I sprinkled a little sea salt over the top of the bread before baking it and it was AMAZING. This one will be on my weekly bread-baking list from now on!!!

Really good recipe. I altered it a little by combining crushed fresh garlic to top and put on a little more parmesan cheese. My family gobbled it up!

Followed the recipe except I used all purpose flour. It was very easy and had a really nice texture. Next time I might add garlic or try some different herbs.

This was very good!  I started it in my breadmaker (just because I was too busy to hand mix and knead it). I know that focaccia starts with a rather wet dough, but it was still TOO wet, so I added 3 TBL of each type of flour to the machine during the knead cycle.  The first rise on my machine lasts for an hour, which was unnecessary - it had doubled within 30 minutes.  Followed the rest of the recipe exactly, and it was gobbled up by my family.  The kids had it as "bread", DH and I used it for grilled veggie sandwiches...YUMMMY!!  Next time, however, I will try forming it on a pizza peel, then slide it onto a preheated baking stone, as the bottom crust was too soft and very pale.  I think the pan of hot water under the baking sheet prevented even browning.  But it was very tasty....leftovers for me today!  YAY!

This turned out really well. It was a tad too salty for me...I think next time I'll use 1 1/2 t salt. I also omitted the Parmesan to make it vegan and sprinkled the top with sea salt, Italian seasoning and freshly ground pepper. Great recipe! It's easy to modify.

This turned out really good.  I forgot to add any olive oil to the dough itself but it was still very good.  I brushed mine with a mixture of olive oil and a little butter, kosher salt, dried Italian herbs, and parmesan cheese.  I am going to make it again tonight and try it as a pizza dough!

This was incredibly good! I followed the directions to a T except for mixing a bit of the parmesan & rosemary into the dough itself along with the flour & salt so I could have flavor throughout the bread. I am not too keen on the rectangular sort of shape it made so I think next time I will split the dough & pat it into 2 round cake pans so that I get Panera-shaped focaccia. So good and so easy too!

I really liked this bread.  I followed the recipe as closely as I could.  I didn't have bread flour, so I used all purpose with about half the vital wheat gluten I would normally use to make bread.  I only had dried rosemary.  I think it turned out very well.  I used my large pizza stone to bake it on and the bottom didn't brown at all.  I'm not sure if that's supposed to happen.  But all in all it's very good.

This was so delish!  Very light and chewy.  I didn't use the rosemary b/c I didn't have any and I used mozzerella instead of the parmesan.  It came out so good.

I am a high school student, and my friends are my food critics... they aren't hard to please, but they defintley liked it! I made a half recipe, and substituted all porpose flour for bread flour, and when i let the bread rise the first time, i let it rise in the oven on the warm setting (this way, the recipe only took 1hr.) I waited until the bread was 1//2 way done cooking before putting on the topping, and it seemed to work well. I topped it with: crushed garlic, italian herb, onions, parmesan, and chopped pine nuts. I have another foccacia recipe that i usually use, and i cant decide which i like better. I also forgot to change the recipe for high altitude, but it worked any ways. I only had to cook it for 15 minutes.

Taste is OK. 375 is too low however, after 30 minutes it wasn't close to being cooked. I would suggest more 425-450. I would definitely add some roasted garlic on top.

I goofed and added the parmesan cheese and fresh rosemary as I was mixing the dough, but it turned out wonderful!  My only change was I used brown sugar instead of white.

Excellent!  I used active dry yeast which I proofed in the warm water and 1 t of sugar before adding to dry ingredients and remaining 2 t of sugar.  I also sprinkled with garlic salt in addition to the Parmesan and rosemary before baking.  This is delish!  I cannot stop eating it!  Thanks Jaclyn for this easy and wonderful recipe.

This was delicious!  I had never made focaccia before so was a bit nervous, but it turned out great.  The only thing I changed was reducing the rosemary and Parmesan. 1 tbsp. of each was enough for me, but that is just preference.

This was a great recipe, I was a little skeptical because of how wet the dough was, but it turned out really great.  I used a garlic/herb spice mix and Parmesan on the bread instead of rosemary.

wwwwwooooooooooooooooowwwwww!!!!!!!! OMG!! This was fantastic. So, so, good. Thankyou for submitting this recipe. I have a bread machine, so I make yeast recipes quite often and I KNOW by sight and touch when a dough reaches "soft" - it's when it all comes together and feels like a cloud, so it took about 5 minutes in the machine, then I put it in an oiled bowl, let it double, punched it down, spread it out with oily fingers and spread dried rosemary, garlic salt and parmesan. The garlic salt made sure there was lots of flavour. Next time I would use half garlic powder/ half garlic salt. The tray of boiling water beneath makes this so delicious. I added the salt to the dough last so it wouldn't kill the yeast and used bread flour and all purpose like the recipe says. The texture of the cooked dough was incredible!!! I will be making this for Xmas lunch to go with the meal with a nice ranch sauce.

Excellent recipe!!  I did the dough in the bread machine too, on the dough setting, and used regular all purpose flour.  I used 2 tbsp italian seasoning,(instead of rosemary) 1 tsp garlic powder, and 2 tbsp parm cheese.  We taste tested it against the focaccia I had just bought at the farmers market....this recipe won!! Hands down!  Just excellent!

Good bread Jack!  The dough was rather unruley, but it turned out good.  I added the rosemary, along with some Italian seasonings into the bread as well.  One question...are ya supposed to remove the pan of water before baking?  I didn't & it did come out fine, but I thought it to be odd.  Thanks for the recipe, I too am going to try this as a pizza crust.  ;)

Very good.  Didin't add parm to make it for vegan friends, will if it's just us in the future.  Only problem was it really didn't rise well, either the first or second times.  My yeast are getting older, maybe that was the problem.  I will definitely make again.  Went well with bruschetta and pesto dips, or on its own..  Update:  made again just as above and it rose great, since I found out my water had been too hot and killed my yeast.  Turned down the water heater after I found that our

Delicious focaccia! I didn't use the parmesan because I didn't have any left but it didn't matter. This was do good with the chowder I made to go with it. I will probably make this to go with all my soups.

This is a good basic recipe. Next time, I'll definitely be adding more flavoring into the dough and as a topping.  Following this recipe has been very easy. I used all all purpose flour, didn't have any bread flour on hand. Topped with salt and italian seasoning.  I had to add it about 3 tbsp of flour to stop the dough from being too sticky. It still felt sticky so rubbed about 1/2 tsp of olive oil on my palms while kneading, this helped a lot.  I didn't do the hot water pan for the second rising.  The finished product looks very nice, and is a good basic bread. It's tastes very good too as a base for more flavorful toppings, sandwich fillings etc.

A Big Hit with the Family!!!  Added some basil, oregano and garlic to the dough.  Made in breadmaker on dough cycle.  Had to add about 1/2c more flour.  Quickly formed into a flattened ball, stretched and flattened it on an oiled pan (my Wilton cookies sheet). Then put on some rosemary, salt and parm.

Really enjoy this one.  I did not have bread flour on hand and had to use all normal flour.  I made sure to not make the dough too stiff givin that I did not have the flour mix.  I also gave my yeast a bit longer to activate - 15 minutes.  I also added in my seasonings when I punched down.  You can flavor this any way you like.  GREAT Bread!

My search for a great recipe for soft billowy tender foccacia is now over!  I wanted to duplicate the texture of the inch high rounds of soft foccacia you find at the market.  I didn't push the dough into the corners of the 15x11 pan but rather rough shaped it into a large high oval before the final rise and it turned out a beautiful loaf.  If you are looking for foccacia with a crisp crust and a chewy interior, this probably isn't the recipe you want.  Great recipe - thanks!

Good recipe!  I didn't follow step one of the directions though.  I used a plastic bowl (my tired-and-true dollar store bowl, lol!) and proofed the yeast w/sugar and all that jazz before doing the flours.  I used bread flour as specified, but instead of the all-purpose, used whole wheat.  I left the pan of water in the oven when I baked the focaccia.  Cut into long strips and served with Cheesiest Potato Soup.

This bread was great! I omitted the cheese and sprinkled garlic salt on top. This was my first time making bread ever and it was EASY! I made sandwiches using sliced fresh mozzerella, fresh basil, tomato and a basalmic Italian dressing.

This recipe was delicious and so easy.  I served it hot-out-of-the-oven as one of my appetizers for Christmas eve dinner.  My family loved the taste, texture and flavour.  I did make a few substitutions: I used 3 cups all-purpose flour, omitted the cheese, and sprinkled dried rosemary and coarse sea salt on top.  I will definitely be making it again.

This was wonderful - i used basil & oregano on top, not rosemary, and i didn't have trouble with it burning/browning.  i also left the pan of water in the oven while it baked, and the texture was amazing.  and a stoneware bowl wasn't necessary, but i think making a well helped with mixing.  great bread! thanks.

The second time I made this I added plenty of extra rosemary and parmesan in to the dough before kneading it and putting on the baking sheet.  It tasted even better.  My husband and I love dipping it in a mixture of balsamic vinegar, olive oil and pepper.

I decreased the water to 1 cup, baked for an additional 10 mintues (I am at a high altitude) and drizzled on an additional tablespoon of olive oil after it came out of the oven.  It tastes just like the rosemary focaccia that Whole Foods sells for $5.  This is a keeper.

I went to make this bread, and found I was out of rosemary, so I kneaded in some leftover basil pesto, and WOW!  This is a good focaccia!  I made sandwiches with Madeline spinach on top, chicken strips, tomato and lettuce on bottom and grilled!  Again, a good bread for a great sandwich!

Delicious with or without the herbs. I heartily recommend this recipe as an alternative to French bread or breadsticks with any pasta or soup.

This recipe has become a standard in my home.  I use it so often, I no longer need to read the recipe. 
Recipe works well for one deep crust pizza, or halved for two medium crusts.

Couldn't be easier; proof the yeast, then toss everything in the food processor and pulse a few times until dough starts to form a ball. I had to add a few tablespoons of water. 

After letting it rise for about 1-1/2 hours, I rolled it onto a somewhat oblong size, put it on a baking sheet, used my fingertips to create dimples, then brushed on some olive oil, sprinkled with sea salt and shredded Parmagiana Reggiano cheese and baked for 8-10 minutes. 

It was devoured quickly !

I've made focaccia before, other recipes, more complicated, intriciate, TEDIOUS recipes, but this one trumps them all.  I just made it again to accompany baked ziti with sausage and meatballs, and?  IT'S A WEDNESDAY!  As there are only two of us, I make this and freeze it...comes in handy for snacks with cheese or dipping into olive oil with herbs or as a makeshift pizza crust.  I used regular flour and put some dried rosemary in the dough, simple and amazing. The flavor and texture are awesome, thank you for sharing!

i lived in Italy for 2 years and I am married to a man from the country, so I have been looking for a good recipe to make us focaccia. Other ones on this site are too heavy and bread like- this is great! I added some sea salt on the top before baking. I am going to make this again and again- perhaps with olives or sliced tomatoes. YUM.
It does take a long time to make it, but if you follow the directions, it turns out light, airy and just like focaccia - but Way better than what you will buy in a store in the US. 
I didnt have bread flour so i just used all purpose flour (and it was bleached. oops) - but it was great. Maybe its even better with cake flour.

This is my favorite focaccia recipe. It's so easy that anytime I have a craving, it's so simple to whip up! This recipe has unleashed my desire to make more bread at home. I've made this for my family full of picky eaters for Christmas and they all loved it. I've made a few different variations. like using minced onions, and I usually steep herbs in the olive oil before adding it to my dough. Most recently, I've used half white whole wheat flour for a healthier twist.

Really didn't care for this. I followed it exactly and thought it was really bland. I would add a LOT more spices, or maybe it would work as a pizza crust.

everyone loved it (family). but the next time I prepare the dough, I wouldn't aim to let it rise twice. And that direction of "hot water in a pan underneath" never seems to work out. Parmesan was an awesome aromatic and flavorful addition to the bread's top.

This dough was really sticky.  I followed the recipe but I kept having to add more and more flour... so much that I thought I had done something wrong.  But maybe this is just how bread making is... I am a novice.  Once I got the dough to the right consistency, I followed the recipe except I added some oregano, parsley and sage.... I also worked the spices and cheese into the dough as well as on top.  The bread was really delicious.  I'll make again with the knowledge that perhaps more flour that what is called for is necessary.

A great base recipe for creating whatever type of focaccia you want!  Today was the first time I made it and I used some fresh minced garlic and dried parsley, and some fresh grated parmesan cheese in the dough.  Then I sprinkled some salt on the top before baking.  Next time I will try something else!  I think I will use it for a sandwich tomorrow.

The best focaccia bread I've ever had.  It is really easy to make.  For the topping I used sliced black olives, sliced tomatoes, minced garlic, dried parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning (no rosemary on hand) and some really good olive oil. Amazing.

This is one of the best Focaccia recipes that we have found. We use it for pizzas as well as regular bread. One of our favorites: garlic chicken pizza and put garlic salt/italian seasoning into the dough as we were mixing it. Top with an alfredo sauce, fresh squash, tomatoes, chicken and garlic. Delish!

It's time to start trying some of the recipes I keep saving to my recipe box and this one didn't disappoint.  I did need to add close to a 1/2 cup of flour to the dough.  After reading reviews, I happened on one written by GRANNYLOOHOO who sauteed some onions to drizzle on top of the dough; I followed in her footsteps and they were an excellent addition, so thank you for that tip!  This is great served fresh out of the oven, sprinkled with a little garlic salt. Thank you for posting this recipe!

Great bread!! Putting a steaming tray of water in a cold oven definitely makes this bread soft and moist (t was a huge hit with my family) only problem is you need two ovens -- one needs to be heating up while the bread rises in the other one, otherwise you waste half an hour waiting for the oven to heat and the bread over-proves.

This recipe is absolutely amazing. I did however, make one change. I took out the salt and put in a packet of italian salad dressing mix. It added just the right amount of seasoning and zing. It was absolutely amazing. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.

This was good but I think the seasonings should be added with the dry ingredients so the flavor is all over instead of just the top.  I will try that next time.  It is excellent with balsamic vinegar and olive oil.  Mmmmmm.

I put the ingredients for the dough in my bread machine and set it for the dough cycle.  Then I minced shallots, garlic, rosemary and thyme and mixed together with grated Pecorino Romano cheese and some olive oil.  I spread this mixture on top of the dough and let it rise for about 30 minutes before baking.  It was very flavorful and people at my church potluck loved it.  I will be making this again and again.  I loved it.

I make this all the time.  It was a very impressive contribution to a fancy July 4th BBQ I went to.  No one could believe I made it myself.

I've done tons of variations with the toppings. My family's favorite is my pizza version, topped with crushed tomato, oregano and mozzarella.

Fantastic basic recipe that can be tweaked in all sorts of ways!!  This last time I added 1 teaspoon onion powder, 2 teaspoons garlic powder, 1 oz finely grated Parmesan cheese and 1 to 2 tablespoons freshly chopped rosemary to the dough.  I also heated the olive oil and steeped some fresh rosemary to put on the top of the bread along with the cheese.  I do like a little kosher salt on the top as well.  I'll make this recipe over and over again tweaking it to match my meal.

I've now also substituted the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour and the recipe works just as well.

The texture of this bread came out perfect! I think I might have used the wrong cheese though (I used parm. reggiano) because the taste was a little too pungent for me.

This was my first bread making attempt and it was so easy and it came out pefectly. I should have read recipe better because I was cooking when I read the "put it in cold oven" part, but I called my mom she said no problem put it in your dishwasher with a bowl of hot water worked wonderfully.

Loved this for not only the flavor and versatility but for the fact that you can use regular active dry yeast with success; the only difference being the method of prep.  Bloom the active dry yeast in sugar/water first then add the oil, flour and salt.  Used Kosher salt to enhance the flavor, added dehydrated onion to the dough, replaced 1 cup w.w. flour, and added 3 tbsp. gluten.  Infused 1 clove crushed garlic in EVOO while bread was rising and brushed on w/pastry brush.  Dried rosemary and basil, and fresh grated parm.  Don't take the pan of water out of the oven while baking; this will give that nice crispy crust to the loaf.  makes alot and can be made into bread sticks for dipping, or for making a nice sandwich.  This would be great for making your favorite panini sandwich!  thanks for a super quick recipe when you don't have all the fixings for a pizza.

I really love this recipe. The main thing I do different is put the herbs and cheese in to the flour mix first thing which bakes the flavors in. I also put a little more on top but it's the baking inside I find best.

Very good, easy focaccia bread.  I added 3 cloves of chopped garlic to the dough.  Next time I will add the rosemary to the dough for even better flavor.

This is an excellent base recipe for soft foccaccia.  The water in the oven makes ALL the difference.  I made it twice and the second time I put most of the toppings in the bread itself (especially the cheese) because it got so dark on top.  I also added a lot of fresh black pepper!!

We loved this bread! I think it's my new favorite. I used my bread machine to mix the dough and set it at the dough setting (I added an additional tbsp of rosemary to the dough ingredients). Then I took it out and finised it off according to the rest of the directions. I also sprinkled some sea salt on top. After I baked it, I cut the bread in strips and dipped in olive oil and balsamic vinegar. It was the best!!!

A nice and impressive recipe. Personly, I would like putting some sausages on the bread and I think is more delicious. For the dough, I followed every amounts of the ingredient, and the result was good. Thanks for this perfect Focaccia recipe.

This is the first recipe that I have ever written a review.  

The Focaccia was delicious and super easy to make for a beginner. I followed the recipe exactly minus decreasing the yield (smaller household).  I was really worried about changing the quality of the recipe when I decreased the size.  

It turned out great :)!

This was ah-ma-zing. I've never tried it before but decided to do panini's last night and thought this bread would be perfect. It was! Super easy to make, about 2 hours from start to finish and beautifully soft and chewy and worked great for the pressed sandwiches. The rosemary gave a nice hint of flavor and worked perfectly for our purposes. I will definitely make this again! :)

These are easy to make, however, gets very dry very quickly. I used another recipe on this site, Josie's rosemary bread, and they were more moist and flavorful. However, this focaccia recipe is great for pizza dough, simple enough to make, adn good for one sitting. If you keep for more than 1 day, it gets very dry and crumbly.

I halved this recipe and made the 7 serving version.  It made the perfect amount for 2 sandwiches.  I did not have fresh rosemary, so I used half the amount of dried rosemary.  I also baked it with the pan full of water in the oven.  I will probably make it thicker next time for my sandwiches.  It was done in 20 mins. This is the only recipe I'll ever use for focaccia.

Really good! It seemed to take about twice as long to rise both times than it said it should, but maybe it was because it was really cold here the day I made it. None the less it was delish and my whole family loved it...especially my 16 month old son. He wouldn't put his piece down.

I really liked this but tweaked it quite a bit to my taste. I used fresh oregano, basil, garlic and onion powder, parm cheese, and a little salt as toppings. Without these, it just would be boring. But it is a good base recipe. As a new bread baker, I really think this is a doable recipe.

Turned out great. My kids absolutely love them. I did make a few changes though. I sauteed red and white onions with garlic and tomato and topped it off with  mozzarella and baked till melted. It was Excellent.

You know I liked this well enough. My husband used it for leftover tri tip sandwiches the day I made it. I thought it could have been a bit moister. Next time I'll definitely cook it for five minutes less. But it is super easy and the taste was fine. Just not outstanding. A good recipe though and I made it as written.

Awesome!!! This made a wonderful focaccia to go with our lasagna dinner and also made a great pizza crust!!  I used my kitchen aid mixer to do the hard work - let the yeast bloom with water and sugar in bowl, add oil and then flour and salt, then knead with dough hook (the standard no fail - speed 2 for 2 minutes).  It was really light and on the inside and crispy (but not hard) on the outside.  The flavor was great too.  I too had to had a bit more flour, but the dough was still a little stickier than others i have worked with.  Added some garlic powder for flavor (since it was going with an italian dinner).  Will be making again and again - my husband (the pizza man) claimed he would give up take out/delivery pizza for that crust.  That in and of itself is a HUGE compliment.

This was very easy and tasty. You might want to up the salt and herbs though. It needed a little dipping sauce to jazz it up.

The rosemary and Parmesan are sprinkled on top of the dough, but there wasn't much flavor integral to the dough itself.  The recipe wasn't clear if I needed to account for the time it took for my oven to preheat, and as a result I undercooked the bread.

This bread is excellent!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was, like many reviewers, I mixed the rosemary and some of the parmesan into the dough, which I think is preferable.  Great texture, and very easy.  I sprinkled a little kosher salt over the top.

This is great!  I added some garlic into the dough like several reviews suggested.  I didn't have fresh rosemary so I used 2 tsp dried instead and added some fresh basil as well.  It was awesome!  I will definately be making this again...and it truly is easy!

Pretty good.  The only change I made was to use garlic salt instead of regualr salt and I would highly recomend it.

This was pretty good, but not quite what I was hoping for. It had a very yeasty taste to me, which I felt was a little too strong. Maybe I should have let it rise more before baking? I added a little garlic powder to the dough, and then garlic powder, sea salt, and just a little rosemary to the top. As well as parmesan and mozzarella cheese. I'll definately make this again, but I'll be playing around with it to try to make it more my taste. Less yeast, more olive oil maybe... but thanks for the great base recipe!!

This is a really, really easy recipe.  Not problems with this one.  I do however, use a whole lot more parmesan cheese and rosemary in the recipe, adding the rosemary and parmesan to the bread itself as well as for the topping.  Also, I sprinkle some salt crystals over the top too.  Everybody who tries this bread absolutely loves it.  Have to double the recipe every time as it all goes!

Far easier than any foccacia recipe we have tried and just as tasty.  

I agree that adding the garlic to the dough from the beginning makes a more flavorful bread.  We topped ours with marjoram, basil, and rosemary before cooking.

This was absolutely fantastic!  I omitted the parmesan and added three cloves of finely chopped garlic, which made the recipe 100% vegan-friendly and much tastier.  My two friends and I ended up standing around the cooling rack and ate the entire thing in 10 minutes!

I change up the seasoning used, since I don't like rosemary.  I've used kosher salt, garlic powder and "Italian seasoning".  It turns out perfect every time!

This bread was okay, a little to doughy for me, it didn't get light and fluffy, it was pretty dense and doughy.

This turned out beautifully.  Added a tiny sprinkle of kosher salt over the top of the bread with the parmesan and rosemary.  Better than most focaccia I've ever had in restaurants.

I have made this in a few variations.  I have used wheat flour. I have put cheese in the bread. and I have put chunks of roasted garlic in the bread.  A 1/2 - 1 cup of cheese makes this bread rich but a little doughy.

This was a great hit at my dinner party.  And it really is EASY.  I added minced garlic, minced fresh rosemary and thyme to the flour mixture, used all-purpose for all of the flour, put rosemary, thyme and parmesan on top -  I oiled the board and my hands with olive oil to work the dough, floured the dough just a little while handling it and was careful not to over knead.  It was really perfect.

Really, really good!  This reminds me of Pizza Hut's deep dish pizza crust.  In fact, I may use it for pizza crust in the future.  I baked it in a jellyroll pan and it was plenty thick.  This is delicious dipped in olive oil with a splash of balsamic vinegar and a grind of black pepper.

This recipe was awesome.  It was so good we did not wait for dinner and ate it straight away at 4pm.  I read all the reviews first and I put 1 tsp each of garlic powder, thyme, oregano, marjoram, sage and 1 Tbs of fresh basil as I had no dried.  I used a plasic container and put all the herbs, and flour in it.  I used 2 cups plain flour and 1 cup Wholemeal flour.  In a small metal bowl I had put 7g dried yeast and warm water, salt and sugar and covered with clingwrap for about 10mins.  I then added to flour mixture and used a bread hook with mixer.  This recipe was just like it said it would be.  It had a beautiful crust on the outside and soft on the inside.  I can't belive that I made this, thanks James and everyone else for reviews

This recipe was awesome! I've never made focaccia, and this turned out perfect and delicous... I even scaled the recipe down to 2/3 and it came out great, which sometimes doesn't happen with yeast-dough recipes. Because I was craving a cheesey-oniony fix, I decided to go a different route with the seasonings than the recipe called for, but I can tell that if I had just followed it exactly, the bread would have been great, too. What I did first with spicing the dough up was add two thinly sliced garlic cloves and a heavy pinch of each of rosemary, thyme, basil and oregano into the "well", after the yeast had activated, then mixed as per the directions. Then when it was time shape the dough and poke the holes, I I topped the round with sauteed onion slices, a generous sprinkling of emmental cheese and a bit of dried basil for color. I followed the rest of the recipes directions and the bread was simply to die for! My husband and I had some with spaghetti, but I wound up finishing the whole round up all by myself the next day... it was just so good. And, I think the pan of water in the oven was the ticket to duplicating restaurant-style focaccia perfection! Thanks for sharing this super easy and very versatile recipe!!!

Really delicious! I used cheddar cheese instead of parmesan as I didn't have any. It rose might more than I was expecting, but that wasn't a problem. We ate most of it standing around the cooling rack!

I didn’t have cake flour and had to use 3 cups of all-purpose flour – I don’t know if this makes a big difference? And I used a good ol' plastic bowl and an electric mixer. I also mixed, as suggested by many, 2 teaspoons Italian Seasoning into the dough and added some salt to the rosemary and Parmesan cheese topping. 
However – the dough didn’t rise very well either time (even with the hot water pan) but while the Focaccia was baking it sure did. The bread came out a little bit too high for my taste which didn’t give it the typical texture and makes it – as others comment – a bit bland. The flatter edges were just perfect and very tasty, though.
My guests gobbled it down in no time so I will definitely make this again, this time I will probably roll the dough thinner than the suggested 1/2 inch.

This was fantastic, and suprisingly easy to make, as long as you put aside enough time.  But it turned out beautiful and tasted delicious with the Spaghetti dinner we had.

This was really good and easy.  I added garlic and fried onions.  I think it might have been a little plain without them.

I made this according to the recipe and it was perfect. It was tasty and soft with a tender crust and wonderful texture.  Fun to make, too!  OK, I didn't follow the recipe *exactly*.  I made it with my mixer and a dough hook, liquid ingredients in first, wait for the yeast to work a bit, then add combined dry ingredients cup by cup.  THe dough forms, the hook kneeds it (I only let this happen briefly..15 sec or so.) I kneeded it a bit more on the floured surface and finished the recipe.  Fun!

Absolutely Wonderful! (not sure if it's a "true" focaccia as it's very light and fluffy however I don't care =)  ) I've made this about 4 times now and each time it's fantastic, I experiment with the flour ratios as well, once with 1c whole wheat to 2 c all purpose, then again w/ 2 c bread flour to 1 c all purpose, each gives a little bit of a different texture but works just fine. My favorite so far is to make it into a "pull apart" bread by dividing the dough into 1/4 c balls before the second rising, dipping them into a cheese mixture & arranging them in a 9" round cake pan, brought this to work and it was a big hit! Thanks for the recipe!

This was fast and easy, and a great accompaniment to the sauce I made for dinner. I needed more time for the dough to rise both times. I sprinkled on garlic powder and onion powder before baking along with the rosemary and shredded (not grated) Parmesan. It always amazes me that I made a loaf of bread from scratch!

I thought this was somewhat bland even with the addition of 1 tsp. garlic powder and 1 tsp. herbes de provence.  Just not quite the texture I was after either.  I'll keep trying new focaccia recipes.

This did not rise as much as I had hoped (it did not rise at all in the oven before baking, and I left it in there with the pan of hot water just as instructed).. see photo.  I did everything exactly according to the recipe.  I left the pan of water in the oven while it baked; don't know if this made a difference, but the recipe does not specify otherwise.  I really wanted to rate this a 3 because of the disappointment of a flat focaccia, but the flavor was still just so good that I will rate it 4 stars knowing that I'll give it one more chance- maybe it will rise better next time.

I have to admit I didn't follow the recipe to the T. No olive oil so used vegetable oil. Added 1 tsp each of dried dill, dried oregano and fresh rosemary (what little I had growing in a pot). I found the water was too much or was my conversion wrong - 375mils? Anyway I added a little more flour until dough was workable. After the first rising, flattened dough into a square cake pan for a second rising, rubbed some oil on dough and put it to bake. Great smell when baking due to herbs and garlic since I did not use cheese. Good basic recipe. Thanks

i just realized that i never reviewed and rated this recipe and it is one of my ABSOLUTE favorites!!  i've never made a "complicated" bread before (just sweet, quick breads), so i was very apprehensive, but the reviews convinced me to try and lo and behold, it turned out great!  wonderful flavor and we froze a bunch of pieces and they still taste good defrosted after about two months.  we slice it and make tomato, basil, mozzarella sandwiches.  seriously, it's one of my favorite meals, lol!  anyway, try it, even if you're nervous -- it's worth it!

Faaaabulous recipe! I followed instructions pretty well as written, with one exception: I added Rosemary, garlic powder, and fresh grated parmesan to dough, and sprinkled more fresh parmesan on top. 
Only small problem I had - the bottom didn't brown enough, so I removed the pan of hot water (carefully), slipped the loaf out of the pan, baked about 10 more minutes,
Used as bun for hamburgers - outstanding.  I'm going to make up a bunch of hamburger patties into squares just to accommodate this bread.
Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious! I went out on a limb and made this for my mother's bday with no trial runs. eek! It came out excellent!! I am planning on making this again next week. I thought there might be a touch too much salt because it was difficult to spread out nicely, but I finally forced it. Next time I will put the rosemary in before the first kneading instead of the punching down because it didn't get distributed much. On top I put the oil, rosemary, parmesean, and sea salt. I didn't care much for the parmesan though. What an easy, yummy bread!

FANTASTIC! Fabulous! Love this focaccia!  Mixed rosemary and garlic powder in with the dry, for added flavor.  Took my time letting it rise and set, my actual total time was 5 hours, (but thats because I had to make the roasted garlic and sweet peppers to go with it!)  This one's a winner!

This is a 10-star recipe.  I too added the rosemary and cheese to the dry ingredients and sprinkled additional cheese on top.  I couldn't believe how big the loaf turned out and thought that we would never be able to finish it all.  Between 6 people and a bowl of infused olive oil, the loaf was gone.

Excellent recipe! Light, fluffy and delicious. Came out perfectly. I added crushed garlic and the rosemary right to the dough after its first rise, and sprinkled parmesean on top. A great base recipe to add many other spices and ingredients to it. Thank you for sharing it!

I'm so happy to be able to make this now! This was delicious. I doubled the parmesean and just added it and the rosemary right into the dough, so it was blended throughout. Left the pan in the oven, and the time called for to bake the bread, starting from a cold oven, was just right. Thanks Jack!

This bread is really good.  I didn't use rosemary, I used basil, oregano, and fresh garlic.  I also used romano on the top, it has a better flavor than parmasean.  I mixed a bit of the basil oregano and garlic into the bread at the end, it turned out very nicely.  The garlic on the top roasted very well!  I left the water in during baking, and this bread freezes very well.

For a homemade recipe this is the best we've had so far. Easy to make, fluffy on the inside and a slight crisp to the crust. I would play around with the topping next time to add more flavor. If I could I'd give it 4.5 stars.

I LOVE THIS!!! I used a stand mixer. Worked great. Also used active dry yeast rather than instant. Proofed for 10 minutes with the sugar. Also worked great. I’m gonna be making this a lot.

I also flattened the rosemary with a rolling pin between parchment paper, stripped the rosemary and added it to the olive oil. I kept about a tbsp or two more of olive oil/rosemary mix to brush on the bread as it cooled on the rack.

Deliciously easy bread recipe! It comes out fluffy on the inside with a slightly salty, thin herbed crust. The only change I made was with the rosemary. I only had dried rosemary, so I mixed in about a tablespoon of water with the rosemary to re-hydrate it before sprinkling it over the dough. Even though rosemary is the traditional herb of choice for focaccia, basil, oregano, and parsley are a few herbs that would also work well. As a bonus, this bread works as a wonderful sandwich bread that has plenty of flavor in of itself. I will definitely make this again!

It is really bad. The taste and the smell is terrible when I took it out from oven. The onion makes the bread so wet and soft. The taste is so disgusting.

Worked great. I was trying to imitate a focaccia I had in Venice and this was pretty close.  It's a great blank slate.  I can't wait to try it with garlic, or more olive oil or butter  or tomatoes.

Great low fuss recipe! No need to worry about starters and prepping anything a day early.  You can make this bread mid-morning and have a great fresh bread by lunchtime.  This recipe is a good base for just about anything, add sautéed onions and sun dried tomatoes, or cheese and jalapeños for something with a little heat. It's an all around great recipe to use as is, or build upon.  Enjoy!

This was a very easy recipe and the bread was great.  I made mine in a cast iron skillet and it turned out perfectly.  I warmed the skillet in the oven slightly before putting the bread in it for the final rise.

My parents love when I make it and keep demanding that I make it when friends come over. I added other herbs when toped it like basil and parsley because I didn't have any Rosemary. Also I put it in a casserole dish instead of a cookie tray and that made it better because it turned out thicker. Great recipe

Not only does this recipe make a nice focaccia bread, it doubles as a nice pizza crust in a hurry. The second rise gets the dough thick and hardy, which is perfect for my hefty pizza toppings that tend to make more delicate doughs wilt under the weight.

This recipe was superb. for some reason, it didn't seem to rise very well for me, which concerned me at first. But when the bread came out, it was PERFECT.  My whole family loved it and it was all gone in one meal--dipped in olive oil, dressing, garlic butter, and soup. I took out the rosemary and added minced garlic and some basil. 5 stars!

My first time to make focaccia bread and I'm glad I finally did.  The texture was wonderful.  In addition to the rosemary on top, I added some fresh chopped basil and thyme.  The flavor was delicious.  Thank you for sharing your recipe JACLYN.

This was the easiest bread I have ever made! I just whisked all dry ingredients together in a mixer bowl, then added the water and olive oil. I combined the ingredients and then kneaded on a full size mixer for about 6-7 minutes, then let it rise. Soooo easy, and it really had a good taste and texture.

The focaccia puffs up quite a bit while baking. Mine ended up too thick for a panini but the flavor was GREAT. Next time, I'll just roll them out thinner.

Just finished making this bread and am working on not eating it all in one sitting so I will have some left for our dinner tonight. I found that I needed at least a cup more of flour than what is specified in the recipe, however this still results in a dough that is quite soft.  For those like me who make a lot of "normal" bread requiring a well kneaded elasticy dough, resist and follow the recipe to leave the dough soft and a wee bit sticky.  Will definitely bake this again.

I used my bread machine for the dough mix and first rise and aside from having to add a bit more flour, I followed this recipe exactly and it was wonderful.  I will make this again and again - thank you for sharing this recipe.

We really enjoyed this bread. I suggest adding a little garlic powder and half of the rosemary to the flour mixture. Then sprinkle the rest of the rosemary on top with the parmesan.

As a Focaccia lover, but not willing to spend the 3 or 4 bucks the store tags it, this is a real winner with me!  I've made this several times now, and have since started mixing cheese into the dough.  Grated asiago, parmesan, pecorino, etc.  This makes excellent sandwiches also, with smoked turkey, brie, tangy sauces, the sky's the limit!  Thanks!

I guess I had expected one thing and gotten another. It was large and dense, I didn't like it that much but my friends enjoyed it.

This was a pretty good recipe. I followed the recipe as written since this was my first time making bread. I'm a big foccacia fan and this recipe was fairly tasty. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because nothing compares to the foccacia bread served at Ryan's in Honolulu. Will definitely make the recipe again.

This was yummy and very easy! It would also be wonderful with garlic and melted butter.

I wished the bread had more yeasty-quality, but good all the same.  Will make again, but will probably let it rise differently.  Husband loved it as a sandwich bread the next day!

Very nice Focaccia! I had some herbs I needed to use up: rosemary, thyme, oregano, and marjoram. It turned out beautiful!

This recipe was very easy. I listened to others and added rosemary and parmesan into the dough. I used fresh rosemary and parmesan from kraft's green can. I proofed the yeast separatly first, then added it to the other ingredients. The bread rose perfectly both times. The flavor is really delicious. I will be making this again.

INCREDIBLE EDIBLE! We have been trying variations of this one because the base recipe is so stable. Our most recent version - we added one tablespoon of blended italian seasonings and two three tablespoons of sundried tomato/garlic puree directly into the well just before we started mixing with the wooden spoon. Also topped it with two more tablespoons of this mix and a little grated parmasean! WOW!

Awesome bread!  I didn't have fresh rosemary so I used dried.  I also added some garlic and onion powder.  Very very good!

Very tasty. Rose nicely, even though I didn't put it in a cold oven with a pan of water. I will try that next time and maybe add some herbs right to the dough as well. Parmesan doesn't melt like some might expect it too (such as mozza or cheddar) it browns, but you need to add it on before you bake so it will stick to the top.

AMAZING. I can't believe how well this turned out! I'm a poor college student, so I added  1 small clove of garlic, dried parsley and dried thyme to the dough. I also sprikled a mixture of dried thyme, cheap parmesean from the "green can", and a parm/moz "Italian" shredded cheese mixture on top.

Turned out great! I ate half...

Delicious use of all that fresh rosemary in the garden.  It disappeared too fast.  Easy to make.

Was good, but didn't look as nice as I'd hoped. The cheese sprikled on top browned rather than melting and it gave it a sort of overcooked look.  Bread was good tasting, will probably try another focaccia recipe next time.

Pretty good, although a little bland compaired to some focaccia that I've had. I didn't use the Parm. cheese. Instead I sauted an onion with a couple tblsp of olive oil, and used that for my topping instead. Served it with tzatziki which gave it a little pow.

My first try at making focaccia and it was a success.  I drizzled a little extra olive oil and sprinkled some kosher salt on top.  I was out of parmesan but it still tasted wonderful.

Oh--yummmmm! Made this for Father's Day along with manicotti and dh was in heaven (he ate more of this than he did the manicotti and he LOVES maniccoti!). I made garlic butter to dip bread slices into. I even enjoyed a slice after it had been cool for a few hours-still very yummy! I hope to try this as a pizza crust, and I think it would be yummy as a cheese bread stick (liek they serve at some pizza places :) Thanks for the terrific recipe-Im stuffed!

Amazing, fabulous, delicious!  Dough was very sticky, but well worth the hassle.  I folded in half of the rosemary after the first rising and added some fresh basil that I had on hand. I left the pan of water in the oven, I thought it may add to the chewy-softness of it.  I will definitely be making this again and again.

This is delish!  I made the dough in my bread machine.  The only problem I had was it ran over my round pizza stone after rising and baking.
Next time I will put in on a cookie sheet.
Will make again for sure!  Thanks Jack!
