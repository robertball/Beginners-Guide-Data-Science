This was excellent! I did need to add some lime juice to the marinade ingredients to get it to pulse in the magic bullet and I'm glad I did. The extra tartness was a nice touch. I'm not a huge fan of tilapia but sure had no trouble scarfing this up. The only change I would make next time is to use corn tortilla's instead of flour.

I made so many substitutions!  But, I was really looking for something to help me with the process.  I did not have tequila so just used olive oil as the base in the food processor.  I had some adobe chili that was super spicy from another recipe. They were still wonderful!  I may try to make with tequila the next time!  I would definitely recommend!
