I'm an old Greek girl and this recipe is the real deal, baybeez. This is exactly what my mother and my Aunt Helen used to make for Sunday dinners. Smelled like it and tasted like it. I was a little (no, a lot) confused by reviews that said "too much olive oil". Here's my take: Don't use cheap olive oil. Ever. You can get amazing California EVOO for less than $10. You can get great EVOO from Crete for the same price. Everyday EVOO... check reviews and make a decision.  Respectfully submitted.

I've made this a couple of times for the family, and my wife has continually declared it her favorite dish.  The only change I've made is using skinless chicken breast tenders instead of skin-on thighs.  In order to avoid the chicken drying out, prepare as described, but cook just the potatoes for the first 20-25 minutes.  Then pull the pan out of the oven, place the chicken on the pan, making sure to recoat it in the marinade, and cook for the remaining 20 minutes.  It comes out juicy and flavorful every time.

Used boneless/skinless thighs and let the chicken and potatoes marinate for 30-45 minutes. No other changes. It was delicious! Served with a side salad of fresh heirloom tomatoes, cucumber, kalamata olives, feta cheese, fresh garden basil, and homemade balsamic vinaigrette.

Chef John, my hero, strikes again.  This is restaurant-quality.  Absolutely delicious as is.  Just one question:  4 lb of chicken for 4 servings?  I would think that 4 lb of chicken thighs should serve at least 8 and very generously at that.

Another great recipe from Chef John. I made this recipe and boy was it good. The only thing for me personally, I would cut the olive oil down some as with the skin on the chicken it was a little on the
slippery side for me. Will be on the rotation list.

Yum! Too much olive oil? Au contraire! Marinated the chicken for a a couple hours in the oil/ lemon mixture. Turned twice during baking. Did not broil but baked a few extra minutes until chicken skin was crispy. Just wonderful!

Held back about 1/4 cup of the oil from the marinade, per another reviewer's suggestion and even then it was too oily.  The lemon flavor was nice in the chicken, but is rather strong in the potatoes so some of the kids were put off.  Chicken was very moist.  I ended up having to cook longer than the instructions and turn on the broiler on the chicken to crisp up the skins.  I drained out the excess marinade in order to even get the potatoes mildly crispy under the broiler.  Maybe it was the 2/3 cup of broth that made the liquid ratio out of balance, but I was very dissatisfied with the consistency of the potato ( 1/2 mush, 1/2 just right).  I read and re-read the recipe several times thinking I had missed a step or gotten something wrong.  Wouldn't make again, but was ok for a dinner night.

This was soooooo good!  The video was really helpful, and now that I know how to make this, I'll certainly be making this again soon.  I'll probably reduce the olive oil slightly.  I also think this dinner and the extra marinade, once cooked, would also be amazing paired with asparagus, artichokes, or brussel sprouts.

I used boneless skinless chicken breast and cut the recipe in half (just the  2 of us and I don't like chicken with bones or thighs).  Super tasty and delicious

This recipe was great! We always use chicken thighs and my hisband said this was the best so far. Since I am all for 1 pot cooking, this was perfect! 
My alterations: boneless chicken thighs, carrots, mushrooms, mini potatoes, extra lemon, baked in 40 min with a quick re- baste after the first 20 min.

Made it a bit different, as I had to leave and the family wouldn't be home to eat for another hour. Put  2 tbs EVOO in the bottom of a glass casserole dish. Sliced potatoes 1/2 thick. Put  those on the bottom of the dish. Chicken on top and poured marinade over the chicken. Baked at 400 for 45 minutes. Potatoes were nicely browning, as was the chicken skin. Turned the oven off and when the family got home, everything was cooked and still fairly hot. Didn't have rosemary or fresh oregano. Family liked it and the kids are rather picky.

Most lovely for the lemon lover and the potatoes were AWESOME!!!  Lends itself well to many side dishes.  :)  Obviously Chef John picked thighs for a reason and they work in this dish, no chicken breasts!

I've made this dish 3 or 4 times now and it's just perfect. You don't need to change a thing. The chicken comes out golden brown with crispy skin and moist, tender meat. The potatoes are rich, creamy and delicious. I love this one so much I'm making it again this week. This one gets all the stars!

I kept the recipe as is but used 4 large skin on thighs. It was delicious! I used yellow potatoes and loved how they soaked up the flavor of the marinade.  I let the chicken marinade for a few hours and I think that definitely made the dish. The skin was good too and I'm defiantly not a skin person. The skin was crispy but the chicken itself was juicy and tender. A definite keeper.

Chef John, amazing!  I made this tonight for dinner and added roasted asparagus as a side.  The chicken was tender, and you are right, the potatoes were too yummy for words.  I followed your recipe exactly, no alterations and this one is going on my "make at least twice a month" list.  I love cooking something new every day so for anything to be put on my list of more than once a month, is very high praise.

Wow, this was awesome. Only had 4 thighs but kept all the other ingredients the same. For extra flavor we marinated all the ingredients first before putting it in the pan to bake!! I would definitely cut back on the oil next time.

We had enough juice that the extra broth was not needed to deglaze the pan. It could be that I used a smaller pan to keep all the ingredients close to each other. The juice/broth was the best. Need bread next time. I just love lemon:)

Really delicious. kids and hubby gobbled it up. I used half the olive oil, next time I'll use 1/8 cup.  And try a little grated parmigiano-reggiano on the potatoes before you broil them.

I love this recipe! I made it exactly as written (I am another one of those How Can You Give it Stars When You Changed Stuff people). My husband and I both loved it and he is a picky eater. He said several times that I need to keep it on the rotation and then asked me to make it again two days later.  He has never done that before.

Followed the recipe and it turned out great.  The video was very helpful.  Family love it.  Place the roasting pan closer to the top heating elements to ensure crispy skin on the chicken thigh.  Potato wedges were very good and full of flavour.  Will definitely make it again.

This was my first time making this recipe and I loved it. I normally don't like thighs so I was unsure about even trying it. I was not disappointed!  I prepared it an evening my young nieces slept over and did not expect them to even want to try it but they loved it too! I will definitely make this again very soon!

We loved the crispy skin!  Next time I will cut the oil in half, but perfect otherwise.  It would be easy to add any other vegetables you have on hand.

Oh this was so good tonight! I didn’t change a thing and I’ll make this again for sure. So I need to get a larger roasting pan because I think my 8 bone-in thighs were a little crowded in the pan with the potatoes and they swam in the marinade. I had to use my turkey baster to remove some of the marinade halfway through the cooking time.  I think I’ll reserve some marinade next time for asparagus and then throw them in the pan during the last ten min.  Husband loved it too. Thanks Chef!!

This is delicious! And really easy! I made this on the stovetop since it was only for 4 of us.  I used less olive oil than called for (1 Tsp. aprox.), but added 1 Tsp. butter.  I used a little less than 2 pounds of skinless chicken thighs and did not need to add chicken broth (which I did not had anyways).  I also left the skin on the potatoes, which btw were the best part for us, incredibly tasty!  Thank you Chef John!

WOW! This was absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe  exactly as written except I used boneless skinless chicken thighs, only because we don't like chicken skin. Was worried the chicken would dry out but it was VERY moist!  I think the trick was not to flatten the thighs, but keep them sort of folded, if that makes sense. Strongly recommend serving with your favorite Tzatziki sauce, that was the topper.  Next time I'll make the chicken to serve in pitas with Tzatziki, chopped cucumber and tomatoes. Will skip the usual red onion only because they don't agree with me. Thanks again Chef John for another fantastic recipe!

Yummy yummy. This is easy and delicious. Chef John never fails and this is a fool proof dish. I omitted the potatoes simply because mine were growing too many eyes. I cooked some rice and removed the chicken halfway through, put the rice in the bottom of the baking dish, placed the chicken on top and finished it off. The rice was amazing and soaked up all of the juices from the chicken. I think I'll just have to make it this way from now on! So good! Thanks Chef John!

This was an excellent dish! I did not do step 6 because I was ready to eat it when it came out of the oven. My whole house LOVED it!! Will make again for sure. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I made this and it was wonderful, especially the potatoes. I will make it again with some carrots as just a vegetable dish, maybe using a little less olive oil. I did marinate the chicken and potatoes for a couple of hours in the fridge.

We love the lemon flavor and have made this numerous times with  the  5 lb value pack of chicken thighs with the following changes.   I  increased the adjusted measurements for 5 pounds of chicken to 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon of kosher salt, Greek oregano, dried rosemary and ground black pepper.  We substituted 1/4 teaspoon of chili seasoning dark roasted for cayenne pepper and increased the minced garlic cloves to 10 and increased the fresh lemon juice to 1 cup.  Additionally  1 lemon squeezed at the end with rosemary and Greek oregano.

With all the chickens in a tray, first pour 1 tablespoon of lemon juice under the skin of each chicken thigh.  Then season each chicken under the skin with a pinch of  the dry herbs. Add the remainder of the 1 cup lemon juice with the olive oil and minced garlic cloves to the chicken and potatoes. Season the top of the chicken and the bottom of the chicken with the remainder of the herbs.   Add some of the minced garlic under each chicken skin.

After you transfer the chicken and potatoes to the roasting pan, drizzle the chicken broth,  add the remainder of the marinade, then squeeze 1 lemon over the chicken and potatoes.  Add additional Greek oregano and dried rosemary over the top so that the chicken and potatoes are speckled.  Follow the rest of the recipe for a great lemon chicken that disappears quickly.  Thank you Chef John for a recipe that is a huge hit with my teen daughter, husband,  mother-in-law and me.

I loved this recipe for Greek Lemon Chicken.  I followed the recipe but added more lemon and it turned out great.  Also, I didn’t have to put the potatoes under the broiler to brown them.  My oven was set on 425 degrees and the potatoes and chicken browned very nicely.  I will make this again and for other people.  Thank you Chef John.

Excellent. I was only cooking 2 bone in chicken breasts so it was a smaller amount but it was very good. I used Meyer lemons, too.  I'll definitely make it again.

I didn't have any oregano or rosemary on hand - so I used an herbal blend that contained both + thyme etc., -   I used bone-in skin on chicken breasts because my mum (who I was making this for) prefers the breast meat . . cooked for a bit less time as they were breasts vs. thighs - didn't bother with the final steps of broiling or straining the broth - didn't need to.  Everything was roasted nicely together and the juices were great spooned over the chicken.  Definitely will make again.

Loved it & followed the recipe exactly as it is.   Didn't find it too oily.  There's enough lemon juice and chicken stock to cut through the oil.

I've made this twice, the first time it was beyond wonderful, the second time I doubled the recipe and in my opinion I made too much for one dish and the proportions were off in terms of making it in two different dishes. 
It is a fantastic recipe, definitely recommend! 
My friends and family loved it and I would make again.

Delicious! I had huge potatoes, but still put in 3.  I was happy I did, because all that flavorful fat made an excelllent coating for the potatoes.  I'd say instead of reducing the added fat in the recipe, add more potatoes (or other veggies you like.)

This was good, but I made a LOT of changes!  For starters, I used half skinless chicken breasts, cut into 3 pieces each.  I also only used 1 T. each of the basil and oregano, and sprinkled a poultry seasoning with paprika and garlic instead of the lemon herb seasoning.  I didn't have green beans, but used asparagus instead, which we prefer.  The chicken and potatoes were done in 30 minutes and I had to roast the asparagus separately. This tells me that the temp could be lowered, maybe to 375 with skinless chicken.  It still was quite yummy!

Ugh, I love Chef John’s recipes! This one was another hit. Followed the recipe to a T (I trust his recipes enough to never alter them:) and it was deeelicious! I did, however, put the potatoes at the bottom of the roasting pan and placed the chicken and marinade over top of them. No leftovers!

I only give 5 stars when the recipe didn't need any modifications and it was delicious enough to become an instant regular dish in our home. This recipe definitely fits this criteria.

This was a fantastic recipe. Made exactly as written. The sauce was quite tasty, and caramelizing the potatoes  really added a great touch. Will be keeping this in the rotation.

Made this on the weekend, straight by the book and it was fantastic.  The only thing I deviated was to marinate it longer cause I really wanted those flavors to come out.  It was so easy, tasted amazing and the marinade will be amazing on other chicken or pork, like a tenderloin.   I was a little apprehensive about marinating raw chicken with potatoes but I figured if everyone has said they did it, it was safe to do.  thank you Chef John for an amazing recipe.  I'd rate it 10 stars if I could!!!

This dish is so good!  I had boneless skinless chicken thighs and used those but otherwise didn't change a thing.  Even my pickiest little one liked it

This dish is the best meal I have made in a while. I tried to include a picture but I guess it was too big. I live in Arizona so I have lots of fresh squeezed lemon juice. I added carrots to this recipe, 2 extra potatoes and I did make some basmati rice because I knew I would love the sauce on rice. I couldn't fit everything in one pan but no big deal. Ridiculously delicious. Just a big party in the mouth!

The flavor that comes out in this dish was amazing.  The seasonings and zesty lemon flavor did not get lost in the marinade at the bottom of the pan!  I didn't make the dish with potatoes, just the chicken.  Sooooo good.

I was skeptical because chicken and potatoes can be bland.  I like spicier foods.  OMG..this was great!!  Very flavorfull.  Only modification that I made was to add a little grated lemon zest.

This was divine. I used extra potatoes, so the cooking time increased a bit, but followed the recipe. The only thing I left out was caramelizing the potatoes at the end, but I'll do that next time.  Oh, I bought fresh rosemary and totally forgot to add it at the end as well! But....this stuff is seriously delicious. As always,  thank you to the Chef for yet another great recipe.

OMG if you haven’t tried this, YOU’RE MISSING OUT! As others have said, it’s not too much EVOO, just use good quality ;) Only thing I did different was to add more potatoes because, as Chef John said in his video, they’re the best part! I tried to make enough for leftovers, but my boyfriend and I loved it so much that we finished it! Keeping this one in rotation

I decided to grill instead of bake the chicken & it turned out great.  I did add a little bit of white wine to the marinade.

This was restaurant quality. I cut the olive oil in half and used chicken breasts to save calories. Otherwise didn’t change a thing. I can’t thank Chef John enough for all of his delicious recipes.

We made this and loved it! We doubled the recipe, and rather than use chicken broth, we just added a little more olive oil and citrus, and it was more than enough to keep the chicken and potatoes well basted. The small portion of leftovers didn't stand a chance the next day

We really liked this recipe.  Reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that I felt 1/2 C. lemon juice was too much, so I reduced it to 1/4 C. and it was just right for our taste buds.  Thanks for an easy, tasty recipe!

Our new convection oven runs hot. The next time, we'd cook at 400 degrees and probably double the sauce. 

Way too much food for 2 people. Any suggestions on re-heating? 

This is a truly great recipe.

This was a bit hit with my family. I messed up and put in more cayenne than what was called for.  If you like a little kick, this is the way to go. I will definitely be making this again.

The potatoes weren't cooked long enough, had to put them back in the oven.  Almost tempted to partial boil them first, if I make this recipe again.

I wanted to try this because it was different than what I am used to. It's very lemony/tart. My family liked it more than I did. I might make it again but with less lemon juice and more broth.

This is really really good!! I used boneless chicken so that reduced the cooking time for the chicken and potatoes.  So when I pulled the chicken out the potatoes weren't close to being done.  BUT my husband suggested that I put them in the air fryer and WOW! They came out crispy, browned and soft on the inside.  Just so good with the marinade and then the crispy potatoes.  So good the next day!

all the garlic burns to a crisp when backed in this dish in the oven @425.  there is also too much salt in this recipe. the lemon juice is probably enough for that purpose.

We loved this recipe; the only change we made was to use chicken tenders rather than chicken thighs just because that's our personal preference. It was easy to make, and the chicken was tender and flavorful. We would definitely make this one again.

Made this with no changes and the flavor was fantastic. Since some people didn't have good luck, here is exactly what I used: bone in chicken thighs, peeled russet potatoes cut into about 1 inch cubes, 1/2 cup freshly squeezed meyer lemon juice, 1/2 cup good quality EVOO, dried herbs. I baked this in a roasting pan at 425 degrees for a total of 55 minutes. The family loved it.

Absolutely fantastic. Juicy on the inside with a nice crisp skin. I do take liberties with all recipes, they are idea springboards for me. I generally add other herbs from my garden, like tarragon and thyme (depends what is on hand), in addition to the absolutely necessary oregano and rosemary. If I have the time I also let it marinate for a few hours. The cayenne gives it just a little kick without being overly hot. Works great with skin on breasts as well. No one in the family is a big potato eater so I’ve never put them in, but works just great with brown rice on the side, it also leaves a bit more juices to serve on the side. When I’m searching for recipes and I see a Chef John version, that’s the one I go to, his stuff never lets me down.

There's nothing like this recipe!! The sauce is to absolutely die for. I had like 4.4 lbs of chicken so I did a slightly heaping scoop (Instead of a leveled measurement) of the salt and seasonings and added one extra garlic clove but kept the same lemon juice / olive oil ratio. I used baby yellow potatoes which I halved. Only "differences" I made was I used a little garlic powder when seasoning the chicken and I didn't remove the chicken at the end. I turned the oven all the way up and let the skins of both the chicken and potatoes crisp up for a couple minutes then removed the pan from the oven. I'd like to try marinating the chicken for a few hours next time and see how that turns out! I have no complains about this recipe at all!

I have made this several times.  Once I even substituted lamb shoulder blade steaks for the chicken and it was amazing.  I am on a low salt diet so I use a fraction of the salt and you can't tell because it's so flavorful.  I also use baby gold potatoes and cut them in half.  I do try to marinate the chicken and potatoes in the lemon/oil/herb mixture for at least 30 minutes to increase the flavor.  I made this for company and they raved about it too.  I usually serve it with a salad or green beans.

The chicken didn't get to flavorful. The potatoes didn't cook all the way. It just didn't turn out at all. The work that went into making it just really wasn't worth it.

I'm late to the party here.. but this chicken dish is delicious! 

Here are my notes and adjustments:

I had intended to use whole leg parts, however I purchase groceries from an online delivery service, and neglected to notice the package said, "boneless." Oops. It's high quality, "air chilled" Bell & Evans brand, w/ skin on, so I plowed ahead hoping for the best. It turned out great! The split meat allowed the marinade to penetrate the meat as well as just the skin. I placed the chicken in a loose roll inside the pan, so meat was still "inside," while tucking skin under. I've never used this cut, and just prayed. The chicken really firms up so nicely in these rolled up packages, with juicy marinade inside and plenty of nice crispy skin on the exterior. Bravo!

I took the chicken out of the package and let it sit, uncovered, in the fridge (in a bowl) overnight. My main concern was the "too much liquid" phenomenon I've encountered in the past, many commentators discussed, and just ruins a dish! The "air chilled," no injected fluids, high quality, kind makes all the difference, imo. In addition, even though it was going to get soaked in a marinade, air drying it a bit more was useful. When I was ready for the marinade, I combined everything—except the lemon juice. I didn't want the lemon's acid to affect the texture, so I let it sit with oil, herbs, salt and pepper in the fridge for a few more hours.

At cooking time I let the chicken come to room temp while I preheated the ov

I've been an avid Allrecipes fan for over 5 years and this is by far the best chicken recipe I have come across! The seasoning is perfect, the directions are simple, and the taste is amazing. The only comment I have, I've never had to cook or broil the potatoes past the time it takes to cook the chicken. As long as the potatoes are small and not large it will cook perfectly with the chicken. 

Tip: Although this is probably pretty obvious, letting the chicken sit in the marinade for at least a few hours (or even overnight) just adds to the amazing flavor!

This was really delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and used leg quarters, which required extra time in the oven, and it was yummy. The whole family loved this dish. Next time I'm adding more potatoes because they were the first thing gone!

Followed the instructions and it came out great. The only things I changed were adding some lemon slices on top of the chicken for a little extra flavor, and adding some chopped asparagus for the last 20 - 25 minutes for a one pan dinner. Will definitely make again.

Very good dish. I've made it twice and we really enjoyed it. I agree that the olive oil needs to be cut back otherwise it tends to be too oily.

didn't have a roasting pan, so made in ceramic dishes. Also, used skinless/boneless chicken. cooked first for ~20 mins, took out and cooked for maybe ~10-15 more, judging by taste. Also, added dried rosemary, onion/garlic powder and spicy chipotle powder. Served with side of mushrooms and onions with cayenne pepper and garlic powder

Delicious!  I like to add carrots, peppers and more garlic and onion to the roast.  To make sure that the chicken doesn’t dry out, I cook it on a separate pan and take it out a little early.  This is a family favorite.

The taste wasn't bad, but a lot of work in my opinion. I used 4 pounds of boneless and skinless thighs. Next time, I will use only about 1/4 c. of olive oil.   Also, way too salty. If I make it again, I'll use less salt and/or less chicken broth. Turning the thighs and potatoes, and then broiling the potatoes separately and straining the juices were all too time consuming. I am definitely going to  omit the straining part. I was really looking for a simple, throw-in-the -oven meal. This was not was I was looking for... Update, just looked at the Nutrition Fact. Never making this again!

Cooked as directed. I had to add 25-30 minutes to my baking time for the potatoes to be done. I liked the carmelizing of the potatoes. Don’t skip the broiling part at the end. Good tasting meal.

My family devoured it!  I have a super picky 12 year old that turns her nose up at everything.  She had 2 pieces of chicken and tried the potatoes, which was a win!  I will definitely add this into the rotation.

I tried this recipe and I served it with couscous. The taste was amazing and the preparation time was very short. This is an excellent dish for the evenings that I am tired and want to spend the least time possible in the kitchen

Easy to put together and tasty. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I would have perhaps baked it for another 5-10 min.  in the oven. The total 45 min wasn't quite enough in my oven; the meat was still a little pink inside.  I used 4 thighs and halved the amounts of the other ingredients. I will make again.

This recipe is fantastic!! Oh my the smell while cooking was incredible! I only had boneless skinless chicken breasts, & bottled lemon juice to use with the rest of the ingredients. I used small whole potatoes which cooked very well but next time I think I’d use regular sized potatoes and quarter them so the marinade cooks into them as well. I can’t wait to heat up the leftovers!! Can’t wait to try this one for my friends!!

Made it with boneless, skin on thighs and breasts and it was amazing. I’ve shared it with 3 other people already and am making it again this week. This time I’m making extra for leftovers.

Easy,  quick, and delicious---it ticks all the boxes!  I used drumsticks (what the hubby came home with) and threw in an extra potato and it was fantastic with some steamed broccoli.  Will definitely make again.

Made it. My only negative feedback is that it took well more than 10 minutes to prep this for the oven. Probably closer to 20-25 all told. But... the food is delicious and easy to make.

I’ll definitely be making this again. I added brussel sprouts to the potatoes which was a fantastic idea, but next time I’ll probably cook the veggies separately with less liquid.

I’ve been looking for a recipe for this dish .....had it years ago at a tiny Greek cafe in a converted gas station here in Rockport Tx. ...owners were Greek  who retired , and moved away.......this tastes every bit as good as the original ....And even my nephew and husband who usually eat white meat scarfed it down!     Didn’t change a thing!!  Thanks!!

I love Greek lemon potatoes and hoped this recipe would infuse the chicken with the same flavour.  Overall, it was ok but very oily.  I like olive oil and appreciate its role in Greek food but it overwhelmed this dish.

Quite simply one of the best dishes I have made or even tasted in the last 5 years.  I had boneless skinless chicken breasts so that is  the only substitution, and I haven't ever tasted another dish like this. Just make this.

Delicious ! Going on our rotation! I didn’t have a key ingredient of lemon juice on hand but we aren’t fans of the tartness anyways and it worked out perfect for us! I used 6 small fairly thin skinless chicken thighs and cut boomer gold potatoes into 1/4’s - the recipe still suited quite well as it was. I used 1/3 cup of olive oil and 1/3 cup chicken broth. I sprinkled some garlic powder, onion powder and some Mrs Dash to the marinade mix. Perfecto !

I was expecting more of a lemon flavor. I wasn't really impressed with all the great reviews it didn't quite live up to my expectations. I will probably not make again.

Great recipe, but wanted to suggest a few changes that others might find helpful, especially if using skin-on chicken.
A broiler can be used throughout, not just at the end for potato browning:  store-bought chicken legs usually are not well-trimmed of skin/fat, which will brown/render nicely over approx. 30 minutes, usually less.
Others have questioned using so much olive oil - this technique will reduce the need for that.
Since broiling is faster than baking, it's helpful to boil the potatoes until still FORK-FIRM beforehand:  they will be fully cooked along with the chicken after broiling.
If lemons are unavailable, store lemon juice along with one large chicken bullion cube/water also forms a good marinade, which will cook-down.  For the amount of chicken called for here, a finely chopped large onion (or scallions) and full garlic bulb was used.
The cooked onion/garlic and herbs don't need to be 'strained' before serving - along with the cooked-down lemon juice/chicken fat - they form the base of a great dressing/sauce for the chicken & potatoes.

Will definitely make again. Used half the lemon juice and added lemon zest. Broiled chicken with potatoes as the skinless thighs needed more browning.

I made this for my family one time when my son and daughter-in-law  visited me, and he makes it for himself once a week now. I made extra marinade and poured it over fettucine noodles.  It was difficult for him to stop eating it.   He absolutely loves it!

It was fantastic. I used bottled lemon juice and it was still great, but I'll definitely go for actual lemons next time. Not sure what people are talking about when they say this is too much olive oil, the fat and acid of the lemon were the perfect complement to the crispy chicken skin and starch.

I used boneless skinless thighs and I roasted some brussel sprouts and baby carrots right along with the rest of the meal.  I also mixed, tossed, and cooked in the same bakeware to save on clean up.  I would definitely make again.

I never give recipes five stars, but I really loved this one! Prep work was not too involved and the results were delicious! The only changes I made were as follows: I added cornstarch and water to the pan drippings while simmering on the stove; I broiled the chicken and potatoes together for about 7 minutes to crisp up the skin on the thighs; and I garnished with chopped fresh parsley, as that is what I had on hand.

I made it and I love it. However, I made an alteration that I regret. I removed the skin from the chicken prior to cooking. This made the chicken too dry. However, this was entirely my fault and does not reflect on the recipe. I will definitely be making it again, skin on.

Very easy to make with a simple yet flavoful taste. I found that the potatoes were crispy enough without the extra 3 minutes on the broil setting by that''s just a personal preference.

Very good!  Watched the video first and followed the recipe closely. Was only making for two, so it was a bit of an experiment to get the quantities right- some adjusting was required.  Overall  the lemon/garlic/oregano flavours were excellent and a real hit with my guy!!  Will be part of the regular rotation.

My family absolutely loved this!  It was so easy to make, it will definitely be a new staple.  The only thing I did differently was omit the rosemary, because we are not fond of that flavour.  Oh, I also removed the skin from half of the chicken as my husband is trying to eat healthier. I was worried that it would be dry but it wasn't at all. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Make this at least twice a month. So easy and delicious! It's my 1 and a half  year olds favourite and mine as well. Everyone I make it for wants the recipe. Also freezes great. I use boneless skinless chicken thighs and add green beans.

Used boneless, skinless thighs (only 4 of them, not 4 lbs), and just sort of eye-balled the seasonings given the reduction in chicken. Because I used boneless meat, the cook time was lower, but I did everything else pretty much in-line with the recipe (didn't need to add extra chicken broth in the end and didn't bother straining the juice--I just spooned it on the chicken and potatoes straight from the pan). Turned out awesome; very, very flavorful. I will definitely make this again.

SOO GOOD. I marinated chicken&veg all day. i used half the lemon since its all I had and added more garlic. I used baby potatoes and didn't feel the need to broil them. I didnt deglaze the pan, I totally forgot but there was quite a bit of oil in the pan after anyways. the chicken was so amazing!!! next time I will cut back on the lemon and oil but that's just me. will be making this all the time!!

Made a perfect dinner! A little tart but that was to be expected (I mean it does have lemon in the name). I used chicken breast and more potatoes but all of the times still worked perfectly; however, I did leave the chicken on the pan with the potatoes for the broil to brown the tops a bit. Overall, very yummy, healthy, and EASY!

I followed this recipe as written with the exception of adding cauliflower. I also marinated the chicken in the fridge for two hours before cooking like Chef John mentioned in his video and others have suggested in their reviews. This was so delicious. The thighs were so tender they fell off the bone and the caramelized potatoes and cauliflower were a perfect pairing. The family loved it.

When I make this again, and I will, I will marinate the chicken in the marinade for a few hours before cooking the chicken.  I also think that skinless thighs will be how I make it next, since the skin on the thighs did not crisp up at all and I just ended up pulling all the skin off before eating anyway.

We had company so I doubled the recipe. I did not make any changes except with the final sauce. I simply strained the pan juices with fat separater and served on the side in a gravy boat.  I also served with the tzatziki sauce (recipe found on this website). It was awesome! Everyone  asked for the recipe.

This was really delicious!!!  Made a huge batch of it for some elderly neighbors as well as my family.  They all loved it!  Added some more lemon juice to my taste ( I LOVE lemon) and added a little wondra flour to the sauce once out of the oven to make a little more of a gravy than a sauce.  I only took away a star because of the fat and calorie content (due to all of the olive oil).... not because of the flavor.  Will try to cut down on that a bit next time.

Followed this recipe to the letter and it turned out amazing.  The cayenne pepper can be skipped.  The other spices are stronger and easily overpower the cayenne.  This is one recipe I would make over and over again.

Followed recipe as is, and here are my comments after making it a second time to be sure I'm on point:

FIRST:  make it clear up front that part of the chicken stock goes into the marinade, and part of it goes into the finishing product!!  (I decided 1/4 c. then 1/2 c made sense)

SECOND:  If you want flavor to really get into the meat and potatoes, I highly recommend you let it sit in the marinade for 1-3 hours.  Then let come to almost room temp.  Then roast.


THIRD   IMO the presentation is weak - it needs color, so I recommend adding 2 or 3 cut up carrots, or something you like.

Bonus:  I tried a gravy out of the reserve chicken stock and juices drained from the roasting process.  (1 T butter + 1 T flour or corn starch cooked for 3 min.  Then add the stock and reserve juices.  Cook 3-4 min.  Then add over chichen & potatoes serving dish.)

Great recipe! I got a bunch of lemons from my brother’s lemon tree and was looking for a recipe to use them. Both the chicken and potatoes came out with great flavor. My husband and kids really enjoyed it. There’s definitely a lemon flavor but just the right amount.

Yum! I made this with all drumsticks, followed the recipe exactly, and it was great. I love that it has really simple directions and was prepped quickly. The thing that took the longest was peeling the potatoes! I'll be making this again, and the only thing I might do differently is leave the potatoes in the oven a bit longer to get them softer. Thanks for sharing!

This was a different take on chicken for us.  My family enjoyed.  It really gave the potatoes a nice flavor too.

My family loved this recipe.  They get sick of eating chicken, but this has a nice twist. I made with boneless, skinless thighs, and it turned out great.  For four people we cut the chicken in half and did the same amount of potatoes that was in the recipe.

I made this for a big family gathering, although I did not have rosemary or enough lemons the dish was the talk of the party! I used ginger instead of black pepper and it was just as good and the fragrance was amazing.I will definitely be making this again

loved it!  I used EVOO and it was not too oily.  I also soaked overnight, so don't know if that helped absorb the oil.  All in all, it came out perfect!

LOVE! LOVE! LOVE IT! I've made this recipe several times, and it has never failed. I've used whole chickens (and even a Turkey one time) and this recipe is fantastic every single time. My mother asks for it all the time, and will get excited if I have everything for it. It's definitely a go-to comfort dish for her when life has been ruff, and can be easy on the wallet when strapped for cash ??????

Absolutely delicious. I halved the recipe and broiled both the potatoes and chicken at the end. I also used Yukon gold potatoes unpeeled and quartered. I did not add any broth at the end. The juices were fine as is. We will make this often.

It was delicious, made it following the recipe to a T. Added some cauliflower florets for extra veggies. My oven is a little slow so it took 15 minutes extra time.

My husband said it's the best lemon chicken I've ever made, raved about it the whole time he was eating it. The only change I made was to omit the cayenne pepper ('cuz I'm a sissy when it come to heat), and I used boneless/skinless chicken tenders 'cuz that's what I had. Gonna have to make it part of the rotation!

Made this recipe for 5 people and the whole family loved it. Wasn't too lemony for someone not a fan of lemon. Loved the sauce for dipping bread in! We made 1 1/2 of this recipe, used a little less oil and broiled the chicken with the potatoes at the end. Will definitely make again.

Another great recipe from Chef John!  I followed the recipe exactly, just thickened the sauce a bit at the end and removed a bunch of the oil from the top. The only thing I would change is to use less oil.  Great taste!!

I broiled slightly longer at the end (5 mins or so), everything got a nice crisp, also left the chicken in while broiling. Squeezed another half lemon directly over everything once complete. My Greek fiancé was beyond impressed, definite crowd pleaser!

Love this recipe...I am not a Rosemary fan so I substituted Thyme and fresh chopped Parsley. I did not add Cayenne pepper either, instead I used Sweet PAprika, but otherwise followed the recipe. I came out LUSCIOUS and tasted just like my Sicilian Grandmother's, so this is truly a keeper. Thanks for posting the video.

Followed the recipe fairly closely, except that I didn't feel the need to heat the sauce up on the stove.  I felt that it thickened enough under the broiler.

Used 4 lbs boneless, because that's what I had. 3 Russets ended up being way too many and I ended up with a lot of extra juice as well. It all barely fit in my glass roasting pan. The chicken cooked all the way through but the potatoes ended up a bit undercooked. I thought I was compensating for the chicken difference by cooking the whole thing for 10 minutes the second time, instead of 20, but I definitely should've broiled the potatoes longer. Will definitely try to perfect this in the future.

Excellent flavors. I realized that my chicken stock had gone bad so I made it without that, and it was still very good. After chicken browned, I covered it so that it could create some juice on its own.  I'll make it again using the stock. Used less oil and it was more than enough.  I marinated and browned the potatoes separately without the addition of the lemon juice, then added them at the end when I covered it.  It's a keeper.

Made this AMAZING recipe! Fallowed the ingredients to a  T : 4lbs of chicken = 4-5 legs. Had to cook them a little longer though since the skin wasn't crispy enough. Will make this again! thank you for sharing this delicious meal!

Followed this recipe to the T! My family devoured it! My parents own and operate a Greek/American diner and I was craving this, we were home all day Sunday and I said what the hey, maybe it will taste like my parents chicken..oooh it did not disappoint! And the potatoes,  th caramelized outside and were so creamy and flavorful inside..the kids now want this meal as our holiday meal! Amazing!!!

1st of all , there must be a typo about the number or servings in this recipe and the amount of potatoes ?! 4 lb. of chicken thighs makes a lot more than 4 servings .. And just 3 potatoes to go with the 4 lb. of chicken ? Unless, these potatoes are huge, the submitter probably meant 3 lb. of potatoes .. Anyway, I halved the recipe using 2 lb B S chicken thighs ( needed to be used ) and 1 1/2 lb. of potatoes.I marinated the chicken and potatoes for 2 H. I followed the recipe for the 1st 45 minutes of baking, and just broiled the whole casserole for couple of minutes and served with some of the pan juices on top. Both the chicken and the potatoes were tender end very flavorful. I served with buttered carrots and some dinner rolls.

Guys! This recipe is IT! It is delicious (like truly, a step above), simple, can be made easily and inexpensively for large crowds, and authentic. This is exactly how I remember Greek food tasting when I was there. This recipe is all the yes.

I spatchcocked a whole chicken and seasoned inside and out and roasted it over the potatoes. Amazing flavor!  Served it once as a family meal and took a complete roasting pan to a neighbor that was recovering from an injury. It was loved by all. Made it a second time for my parents and it was better than going to a restaurant they said. So rich in flavor.

Delicious! I had skinless and boneless chicken thighs, so I only baked the chicken for 30 minutes and then removed it from the pan. The potatoes were roasted for an additional 15 minutes. I did let the chicken thighs marinate for about 45 minutes  and then covered the potatoes with the marinade before roasting. Thanks for a great recipe!

Soooo good. Family loved it. I used four thighs, not four lbs — so I should have used a lot less salt, but it was still delicious. I also used less broth, after juicing the lemon, I tossed the halves in the pan to bake with the chicken and potatoes (Yukon Gold.)

I’ve made this twice now and will add it to my dinner rotation.   Recipe is good as is with no changes.  I did add some red onions last time because my husband loves onions.  Also the red onions added color to the dish.  Next time I will probably add some fresh green beans.

I made this tonight and my husband who is a foodie thought it was restaurant quality.

 I used 1/3 of a cup of olive oil (as several recommended) and cut up baby potatoes instead of russet potatoes. I put it all under the broiler for 3 minutes at the end and it was amazing. I will definitely be making this every few weeks.

I really like this recipe. I've made it with both thighs and chicken legs and they turn out great.  I usually add garlic powder because sometimes I don't have fresh and it works well. Best of all, I make this in my toaster oven and it doesn't warm up the house on a hot summer day.

Thanks for the recipe :)

Made it today and it ohmyso yummy! I omitted the cayenne pepper as my husband is not a fan of spicy food. Also i advice letting the chicken marinate in the fridge over night it makes all the difference. All in all this recipe is a keeper!

I've made this several times and it's always a hit. I agree with some of the other reviewers that there's more oil than necessary. Last time, I also added a can of artichoke hearts (halved): they added a nice contrast and really pick up the lemon.

I had to change out the potatoes for something else since we have a diabetic in the house. I opted for Kubocha (sp?) squash.  Cooked everything exactly as written... ok, ok, I used chicken breasts and cooked at 375 for 30 minutes, but everything else was the same.  Really nice!

I made this for guests tonight and everyone raved about it!  I cut up one whole chicken and cut up two potatoes per person.  I also added brussel sprouts.  I followed the marinade exactly as written.  This is so amazing.  It will not disappoint!  This will be my new go-to meal for dinner guests.

Great recipe. Made with chicken drumsticks and yellow potatoes because that’s what I had on hand. It was delicious and even my picky eater liked it!  Will definitely do this again. Thanks Chef John!

This was delicious!!  I did make a few changes.  Used the ingredients as the recipe called for exactly, noting that 1/2 cup of lemon juice equals three fresh lemons. I marinated the chicken overnight in the olive oil and seasonings mixture.  Potatoes were cut in smaller slices and did not remove the chicken as instructed at the end and also cooked an extra hour.

Love this dish so much...even my daughter eats it without any “reminders” to eat LOL.  I don’t like dark meat or meat on the bone, so I substituted a pound of boneless, cubed chicken breast.  Used coarse salt instead of Kosher, and used 3 tsp granulated garlic instead of six cloves minced garlic.  All other ingredients were used as outlined.  Cooked per directions, then scooped out cubed potatoes and nuked in microwave for 4 minutes, as they were still firm, but chicken was cooked just right.  The potatoes were moist and perfect after the microwave (just how I like my Greek potatoes).  This could be a quick, easy, nutritious weeknight meal...definitely will be on my rotation!

I liked it. My wife loved it! I thought it was a bit too lemony.  I put all the ingredients in a 5 gallon freezer bag and shook it, then stuck it in the fridge for 2 hours. This is cleaner and easier than using bowls. I also used a big, deep cookie sheet for baking because my  baking dishes can’ t go under the broiler.  Then I poured the juices into a saucepan and stirred. (There wasn’t much to scrape off the baking sheet.  It went well with steamed asparagus. I will make again, maybe for company.

I didn’t have chicken stock, so I substituted veggie stock. Still turned out delicious! Added some extra time to crisp up the chicken after removing it from the pan.

I have made this several time & it's now one of my favourites. I don't measure the lemon juice or olive oil (I'm used to mls rather than cups!) & put in more chicken stock than it says, and I've swapped the cayenne for smoked paprika, but it always turns out delicious. I also use Cyprus potatoes, don't know how they compare to the recommended type but they are amazing in this dish.

Perfect! I did use chicken breasts (all I had) and cut like tenders. Everything else was done as stated in the recipe and I was impressed! I will definitely try with thighs next, I actually bought some for this purpose, lol! So good!

We throughly enjoyed this! I made this exactly as written, just cooked it a little longer as my chicken thighs were huge. I couldn't complete step #6 as there was a pool of oil left,  I'll use less next time. Thanks for another excellent recipe, Chef John.

Delicioso. Todas las recetas del Chef John son una garantia de exito. Este pollo es muy sencillo. Yo en lo particular lo dejo marinar casi 6 horas. No hago ningun cambio y las dos veces que lo he preparado ha sido del agrado de toda la familia

It was good except for being way too oily.  Next time I'll reduce it to about 3 Tbsp of olive oil.  Good flavor otherwise!

Very easy with little prep time needed.  I used a sheet pan  which made it hard to ensure juices didn't come over the side after the 20 minute initial cooking period where you moved the chicken and potato around in the juices.  I used more garlic than recipe called for - all said, recipe was really easy and everyone enjoyed it.

I followed this exactly and used the entire amount of chicken specified and it is perfect!  I did however have to split between 2 smaller roasters as it makes more than I anticipated (oh my, leftovers :)  and they needed proper space. Yes its a generous bit of oil but necessary to brown properly and balances the absorption of the lemon in the spuddies. MMMMM

Maybe it's just that I have high expectations of Chef John's recipes, but I found this to be okay, but a little underwhelming. I'm cooking for just me, so I halved the recipe and planned on eating the other half for tomorrow's dinner. Which may be why the skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs I used turned out a bit dry and the only liquid in the bottom of the pan at the end of the cooking time was grease. My oven is calibrated, and I used a heavy 9" aluminum cake pan so that everything would be as tightly packed as it was in Chef John's roasting pan. Or maybe it's just that the smaller volume of food takes less time to cook? That sounds plausible. Next time, I'll drop the temperature to 400 degrees, and keep the cooking times the same, but watch it more closely during the second roasting. But Chef John was definitely right about the potatoes. They were absolutely the best part.

I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and Yukon Gold potatoes. Also I skipped the step of deglazing the pan with broth. Still a tasty easy meal and I will make again.

The skin on and bone in chicken is pretty greasy on its own, so I cut back on the olive oil. I also add extra lemon because I am a lemon fanatic.  LOVE this recipe!!

This dish is going to become my go-to when hosting a big crowd. I marinated everything in the morning and then popped it into the oven for roasting and BAM...moist, delicious, lemony and garlicky chicken that wowed all my guests (even the littlest/most pickiest).

Yummy!!!  Made it once following directions.  Turned out great.  Second time, I added green beans, garbanzo beans, onions, and bell peppers.  It was scrumptious.

Excellent recipe. I used a mix of chicken parts - breasts, drumsticks, and thighs to please different family members. All came out perfectly using the recipe as written.

I found that two 12 in pans worked better for me. Chicken in one, potatoes in the other. The potatoes come out very lemony, so I might experiment with adding them to the chicken later next time I try this recipe. I will definitely make it again though!

I didn't have rosemary so I used dill seed only on the potatoes. The potatoes I half instead of quartered. I made a gravy from the juices in pan and poured over chicken. The lemon flavor came through in the chicken. I enjoyed the meal and would do it this way again.

Absolutely delicious and easy.  I don't care for thighs and I was making it for two people.  I used two bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts and used two potatoes, albeit they were huge.  The olive oil quantity was fine but the lemon was very strong on the potatoes, and I LOVE lemon flavor.  Will definitely make again!  Roasted a pan of sliced zucchini (2) and one sliced onion tossed in olive oil and herbs to accompany the dish.  Perfect compliment.

I did use chicken breast but pounded them. I also put into a Dutch oven with a lid. Place cabbage on the bottom to not brown anything yet. (With lid in) Took out after 30 minutes. Removed cabbage. Tossed chicken and potatoes. Cooked uncover for another 15. Flipping amazing. Followed everything else including the olive oil. After. I whipped up a couple eggs with small amount of chicken broth, added some flour then slowing whipped into drippings. Lemon sauce anyone? :)

I liked it a lot and my guests raved about it, but I got carried away with the chicken and then added too much liquid trying to compensate! (Or so I thought...) Next time, I'm sticking to the recipe even if I don't have exactly 4lb of chicken. I think the end result will be much improved. Also, perhaps some fresher herbs than the dried ones I had on hand.

Being Greek, I grew up with this recipe but using a whole roast chicken. This is even better because the parts get nice and crispy skin and the potatoes are and always have been my favorite way to eat potatoes. We also do this with a leg of lamb at Easter, right down to the lemon but we stick slivers of garlic all over the lamb. and then surround with the potatoes and roast. DELICIOUS!

Even though I am Greek by marriage I have been making  "Chicken and Potatoes in the oven" for 2 0 years.  This is a great recipe and one that I can use when someone asks (because I make it after watching Gia GIa for years not because there is a recipe)  However no Greek I have meet uses Rosemary so I left that out and our  traditional dish calls for Cinnamon which I did add. Feel free to call me for tips Chef Jon - I share ;-))

I like the taste of this chicken dish. I had to use drumsticks because the grocery store I went to didn’t have any more chicken thighs. Will make again. Very delicious!

This dish was just okay for us. The chicken was very good but next time I would rather use skinless chicken thighs and continuously bast the chicken as it is cooking. We did not love the greasy lemon flavoured potatoes. These would be better roasted separately on the side with a light coating of garlic butter/oil. I made Greek salad as a side dish (the best part of the whole meal).

As others have said, I found it a little oily.  The only change I made was using 1 teaspoon of salt as oppose to tablespoon; it was plenty salty! Family loved it.

Delicious recipe.  Think you could cut back a little on olive oil and chicken broth, as there is plenty of liquid in the dish. I also crisped the potaoes on a separate sheet pan because the high oil content in the baking pan could easily catch fire or smoke heavily. Really good, though!

I used carrots,  green beans, and potatoes. I also used 4 lbs of skinless, boneless thighs.  It was amazing.  Lots of flavor,  not overly lemon.  The hubby said this should be a repeat recipe.  Delicious!!

Made without any changes.  Did not have as lemony a taste as I would have liked.  I suspect it will if I marinate the chicken next time.  Was also good as left overs.

I cooked it longer than the recipe called for.  About an hour and ten minutes in all.  It still looked raw in the original time given for the recipe.  We really liked it.  Very good spice to it.

it's easy, but I will brown the chicken and potatoes next time.  sauce didn't thicken at all, so was kind of soupy.

This has become to one of my go to recipes. It holds up as leftovers too. I have to appeal to a 9 year olds palate so I don’t use red pepper flakes and cut down a little on the lemon juice. To reduce calories a little I cut down on the EVOO and it’s still good. I also use boneless skinless chicken breast. So delicious every time.

Wow! Such a good recipe with readily available ingredients.  I had to drain off the extra juices after the chicken was cooked to caramelize the potatoes, but it was delicious.

Immediately had requests for another make. I used red potatoes, and should have used more. There was plenty of sauce, but I could see holding some oil back. I also think I might take the skin off the next time. It was easy to make and very tasty.

Very good. First time around the potatoes needed a bit longer and the chicken was perfect. The second time, potatoes were perfect but the chicken was dry. I left the chicken broil with the potatoes to brown them more but left them in for 10 minutes. Just too long.

This was delicious!  My husband took one bite and said it was awesome, and he wants me to make it again very soon.  I made the recipe as directed, but I misread the ingredients and put in some thyme.  It just gave the chicken and potatoes more flavor.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs as I didn't have any regular ones.  It cut back on the baking time by about 15 minutes.  We loved the lemony flavor of the potatoes.  It's definitely a new family favorite!

This will become a family favorite. It was easy. It was delicious. I did sub the russet potatos with the small more colorful heirloom potatos. I am looking forward to making this for a large group of family during the holidays.

I love this recipe and have made it several times now! It is quick and easy to make, and requires no marination time! I omit the rosemary (not a fan) and use Yukon Gold potatoes and a whole cut-up chicken (rather than thighs). That way, people can grab whatever piece they prefer at serving time. I do find that I have to increase the cook time (close to one hour total), but the results are delicious and I love that you get a chicken and side dish cooked in one pan, saving oven space and time!

I've made many of Chef Johns recipes and this is one of my favorites. I've used both thighs and breasts and other than adjusting cooking time a little, both are great. The chicken and potatoes really absorb the flavor. I made this the first time when my sister, her husband, and my mother were visiting, they loved it and mom told me that my sister had made it repeatedly in the next several weeks. Really good, no changes.

This was delicious.  I did only half the recipe but used the full amount of seasoning.  I found that cooking it at 425 for a total of 45 minutes, I did not need to broil anything at the end.  It was beautifully brown.  Next time I think I would marinate the chicken thighs in the seasonings, lemon juice, olive oil and garlic the night before in the fridge and then add the potatoes shortly before cooking and mix it all together then.  This is definitely a keeper.

I tried halving the recipe and also used a glass baking dish instead of my roasting pan. Chicken didn't brown as well and potatoes were too done. Next time I will follow the recipe exactly! However, despite my mistakes, this was a keeper! Delicious, and my husband called it "awesome"!

Chef John really hit it out of the ballpark with this recipe.   A couple of years ago our favorite Greek restaurant closed and I have been missing the taste of their lemony Greek potatoes every since.  Pairing it with the chicken is perfect.

This had a very good flavor but I wonder if it would have better to eliminate the chicken broth for more of an oven roasted potato as opposed to them simmering in liquid, hence a boiled effect.  Placing them under the broiler is a must but that only carmelized the tops.  I used boneless skinless thighs and they turned out good.  I reduced the cooking time by 5-10 minutes.  I also cut the potatoes smaller to ensure they would be cooked through as I knew the overall cooking time would be shorter due to using boneless.

This is very tasty. It's pretty easy to make, but don't be fooled by the 10-minute prep time. Like most every recipe on this site, the prep time is severely understated. There is no way you're going to fresh squeeze 1/2 cup of lemon juice, peel and quarter 3-russet potatoes,  measure out 5-spices, create the marinade, and put it all together in  a pan in 10-minutes. Not even close.

Agreed about the oil. I cut it down before even reading the reviews of others. Also used fresh Rosemary (I have 4 different kinds in the garden). Also turned the potatoes at the end and did the other side under the broiler. 
Great dish.

This was a hit! I did change a few things based on other reviews. I used half as much oil and salt, and did not use the broth. I did not brown the chicken thighs. I sliced red potatoes about 1" and layered in bottom of large casserole dish. Topped with sliced onions. Topped with the thighs. Combined all the marinade ingredients, then brushed the thighs generously until all marinade used. Baked uncovered at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. Lowered to 375 degrees and put on timed bake for 45 minutes since I had to run out for an hour. Came back to the house smelling wonderful and dinner baked and still warm in the oven. Served with fresh green beans. Less clean up this way. Highly recommend!

I make this a lot; especially when guests come over. Sometimes I leave out the Cayenne pepper. But otherwise, I make it just like the directions.

Used cauliflower florets instead of potatoes (no carb diet), and added a giant sliced onion and a big red bell pepper, both on the bottom of the pan. The changes worked fine. The chicken took longer--about 35 minutes, but then, it was a big bird. I'll make it again.

We were out of lemon juice so used lime juice instead. We also used drum sticks. It was a very good and super easy one dish meal.

I prepped this in the morning, and then put it in the oven when I got out of work at 5:00, and by 6:00, dinner was ready! It was delicious, and the potatoes were really that star here (like Chef John mentions in his video). Really yummy! I served this with a Greek cucumber and tomato salad. Everyone enjoyed it!

This was good, not spectacular.  I used boneless breasts which may have made a difference.  Since my chicken was small and thin roasted it at 400 degrees which was perfect. I did not deglaze the pan with broth as I didn't want to open a can of broth for that small amount plus the brown bits didn't look that good anyway.  The chicken had a subtle lemon flavor which we liked, but didn't notice it on the potatoes.  I haven't decided whether I will make it again.  It was pretty easy.

Followed the recipe exactly as written and it was excellent! My 4 year old ate 2 whole pieces of the chicken.
The only thing I did different was to make a gravy using the pan drippings.
Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing.

Very easy.  Great flavor.  Chicken is moist and potatoes are a very nice compliment.  These are ingredients everyone has on hand.  I used fresh herbs from my small herb garden which I think added to the flavor even more.  My kids raved at this dish.

I was skeptical about this one because of all the lemon.  Was I pleasantly surprised at how flavorful and delicious this was!  The lemon did not overpower this at all.  My only change was that I added 1/3 cup of chicken broth instead of the recommended 2/3.  I found even that to be too much - it was  too liquidy when I pulled it out of the oven.  Next time, I may only add 1/4 cup of broth.  I served with Greek Green Beans.

Loved this!  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts because that was what I had on hand.  To make it a true one pan meal, i also tossed in some fresh green beans. They provided a nice crunch!  Will definitely make again!

DELICIOUS! I did reduce the oil but not by much. I, like some other reviewers did not feel there was a need to add more broth at the end. There were plenty of juices in the pan. Make sure to use thighs (bone in or boneless it doesn't matter) as they are so flavourful!

I followed this recipe for the marinade, but used it on a whole chicken with potatoes that I baked in my NuWave oven. I used fresh lemons, and then zested some of the lemon into the marinade. The remaining lemon peels were stuffed into the chicken cavity. In the NuWave oven, it took 30 minutes of baking at 375 degrees on each side on the 1" rack for a 5 1/2 pound chicken. 

Initially brushed the chicken and potatoes with the marinade, turned the chicken breast side up after 30 minutes and turned some of the potato quarters. The poured the rest of the marinade over everything. After 15 minutes, I basted everything with the juices in the bottom of the pan. When the chicken was done, I roasted the potatoes a couple of minutes more for browning and crisping. 

Then I poured the juices at the bottom of the pan into a gravy separator to strain out chunks, and let some of the oils raise to the top. This was poured into a gravy boat to pour over the chicken and potatoes as needed. 

I thought the dinner turned out very well, but expected more of a lemony, spicy flavor. Even so, I think it turned out better than any Greek chicken I have had in most restaurants. To make this a "one-dish" meal, I could have added onion and carrots to the oven for baking, but I ran out of space in my oven.

I made it according to the recipe but let the chicken marinade for a couple of hours before popping it in the oven.   We really liked the chicken, I would give it a 5 but we weren't crazy about the taters.  Next time I will omit the potato's and make rice or pasta with it.   Very tasty.  I think it would work with shrimp as well.  I may cut back on the olive oil too.

This is a simple, tasty meal in a pan.  Thanks, Chef John!  I added a bag of fresh spinach at the end, just because it was in my frig and I wanted to use it. It was excellent.

Don't we all need more recipes that are easy, inexpensive, and delicious? My husband has a tendency to whine if served chicken with skin and bone, but he had three pieces of this.

This is my second time making it and results are delicious!  I  didn't have quite enough dark meat chicken, so I cooked 2 skinless boneless breast fillets plus my 4 large chicken thighs. Used same amount of spices, stock and oil, so threw in extra potatoes (yukon gold).
As expected, breast meat reached 165° much faster, then the thighs took longer to cook through near the bone, but  I wouldn't change a thing, especially broiling the potatoes and marinade after removing the chicken.  I agree with Chef John, the potatoes may be my favorite part! Yum!! =0)
Note:  With 1 thigh and  half a breast each, I ended up with just enough  to feed 4 hungry adults.  Many compliments!

Super simple and turns out delicious every time. I make this at least once a week and even on a busy day its quick to throw together and put in the oven. 
I add quartered onions along with the potatoes. Bake some lemon halves to scoop out and eat with the chicken. I generally do Asparagus instead of green beans. You just can't go wrong with this recipe.

Excellent recipe.  I halved it for the two of us, using bottled lemon juice and garlic powder because we were out of fresh and used bit more cayenne.  We both agreed it,s a keeper.  Thanks, Chef John. (If you watch the video, you,ll  see Chef John actually used thighs and drumsticks and it looked like less than four pounds.).

This was delicious!  Thanks Chef John!  This was just as good if not better than the chicken and potatoes my Greek friends have made for me!  I followed the directions as written.  Some had said maybe it was too much olive oil.  I found that the amount of olive oil was perfect, however I did use almost 5 lbs of chicken instead of 4 like the recipe says, so perhaps I would have cut down on the olive oil otherwise.

Just made this for the first time and it is really good, and really easy.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and will change only 1 thing the next time I make this - I will not use thighs (they cook very fast and weren't as tender as I expected). I will try chicken breast OR just cover the pan so the thighs will steam for the first 20min +/-, then let everything brown.  The potatoes though, just amazing.

I made it for dinner tonight. I fallow the directions but I cut the recipe in half except for the potatoes, and skinned the chicken and used fresh rosemary as I did not have dry. It was a hit we all liked it and most definitely I will be making it again I also broiled the chicken for 5 minutes before I took it out and kept the potatoes in the broiler for another 5 minutes , very good, Thank you for posting this recipe.

Because my husband loves lemons I was generous with the lemon juice, but cut back on the olive oil. I eyeballed it, but I would say I put in about 1/4 c. Of oil. 
I also used boneless skinless chicken breasts which I tenderized. 
The dish came out beautiful! Lovely color, lots of flavor. This will definitely be added to our dinner rotation.

This is easy and taste great! I didn't use 4 lbs of chicken so I cut back on the oil a little bit. I added Brussel sprouts to the potatoes an chicken and they turned out awesome. Just a note the lemon is strong and you absolutely must love lemon to enjoy the lemon potatoes. I think that is how the Greeks make it I've tasted it that way in the Greek restaurants. So don't say it's too lemony that is how it is supposed to be.

I made the dish with two very minor changes. I used creamers instead of russets because I had a huge bag on hand and I marinated the chicken in the mixture. It was delicious! I have four boys and rarely serve a meal everyone likes and they all liked this as did my husband. It's a keeper.

I was questioning the amount of lemon juice and olive oil, but I made it exactly as written except cut the salt in half ( I'm on a low sodium diet).  It was absolutely delicious!  I'm so glad I didn't decrease the amount of lemon juice....it was perfect.  I will make this regularly.  Thanks Chef John!

This was a tasty dish!  Prepared as directed using boneless chicken thighs but didn't finish off with deglazing the pan b/c it wasn't very crusty on the bottom but full of juice that I poured over the chicken.  The potatoes are the best!  broiled for just a few minutes to brown before serving.

my very picky husband looooved it.  Made it again at the end of the same week.  Followed the recipe exactly,  wouldn't change a thing, but may add some green beans to the mix just for fun.

Very good my husband and 13 yr old son enjoyed it. I added black Kalamata  olives and feta cheese. I didn't have rosemary so I substituted with basil.  As side  dishes I roasted peppers and had toasted pita bread and hummus.

I tried this tonight.  Followed the recipe exactly, even after reading some reviews.  It was amazing!  So flavorful.  I used organic chicken breasts and added fresh asparagus to the pan for the last 15 mins.  I made an easy tzatziki sauce to accompany the dish.  5 stars!  I will use this recipe often.

The flavor was wonderful and my whole family was quite surprised because I am NOT the cook in our family. I will make this again and I will use about half of the lemon and oil or add more chicken and potatoes. It was almost too lemony for our taste but still delicious!

Great recipe! I used a 1.5lb package of boneless chicken thighs and adjusted the rest accordingly. I used 5 small/medium Yukon gold potatoes and did not find that I had too many potatoes. Next time I might decrease the oil just a little bit. My husband loved it, and thought the lemon was just right.

Absolutely delicious! Tender and lemony tasty chicken and oh so delectable potatoes. Halved the recipe for the two of us and had leftovers for lunch, otherwise followed the recipe to a T. Don't skip browning the potatoes under the broiler or making the "u jus." Served with steamed green and yellow beans, and carrots. On my list to prepare for company.

This is the easiest and best recipe for chicken and veggies.  I added carrots and thinly sliced onions (I added them with the potatoes) and it's even more wonderful than with just potatoes.  I've made this a few times. It's great for entertaining because it all comes out of the oven at the same time.  I made it with bone-in chicken breasts because that's what I had on hand, but I think any chicken pieces will work fine (just adjust the cooking time to the right kind/size of chicken).

Outstanding flavor! Simple enough to make during a weeknight but delicious enough to serve to company.  I just used a blend of dry Italian seasonings and some chicken bullion mixed with water bc that is all I had on hand. Will be making this again and again! Thanks Chef John!

This was absolutely delicious!  I used chicken leg quarters that came out so moist and flavorful.  The potatoes were just as delicious.  I did cut down on the amount of olive oil, but everything else stayed the same.  All in all a fantastic meal that was very inexpensive to make.  This meal reminded me of my favorite Greek restaurant back in Chicago.

Amazing! Another one of Chef Johns recipes  I will be adding to my rotation. Only thing I modified was to cut back the oregano and rosemary and also the olive oil. I tossed fresh french cut green beans while caramelizing the potatoes to add some veg to the dish and topped with lemon slices and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese to finish it off. Deeeelish!

Most flavorful chicken ever. I wish I would've had extra leftovers. I followed ingredients just not the exact cooking. I used chicken tenders 1 lb. oven at 350, and no potatoes bc I forgot to buy. I cut recipe down to "1" serving which was 1lb. Baked for about 30 mins until correct temperature. Served over rice. No ingredient overpowered another. It was delicious. I will make again.

Really tasty and quick. I didn't need the full 40 minutes for the chicken. I would keep your eye on the thighs and make you best judgement on timing.

Husband loved it, I thought it was borderline gross. Should have gone with my gut and discarded the marinade so the chicken & potatoes could roast instead of swimming in juice.

Delicious! I only used 2.5 lbs boneless skinless thighs but kept the marinade amount the same. As other reviewers mentioned, I cut the oil in half and only had 1 lemon so used the juice of that. I added baby carrots, onions would have been a good addition too. It was a hit with the whole family, thanks!

This is a great dish.  Working dad who tries to cook for his family, well this is a great meal easy to make and wait.  My teenage boys are now proclaiming it as there favorite meal.  The potatoes turned out really well toasting them at the end gave them an extra pop.  Chicken was moist and tasty.  I can't wait to make it again.

This turned out to be the best chicken I ever made.  And definitely tasted greek (I am half greek).  I am not the best cook and don't have a lot of experience but this turned out great.  I didn't have rosemary so I used a little thyme.  I made 10 chicken thighs so had to increase the recipe.  I also made a separate pan of the potatoes because they didn't all fit on the pan with the chicken.  I used disposable aluminum pans and the juice from two fresh lemons.  I had to leave it in the oven for about 70 minutes to get the chicken skin browned.  I served it with a french baguette.  My daughter's family loved it, even most of the kids who are very picky.  Thank you Chef John.

We love this recipe! I usually make it once a week, exactly as written. It's best with chicken thighs, but also good with boneless breasts or whatever you have. I appreciate that you just need to adjust the recipe based on how many pounds of chicken you have to get the proper seasoning amounts (ex 1 serving = 1 pound). Thank you!

wowee kazowee, is this freakin amazing!!! now, I absolutely adore chef john and his recipes, but this was not really in our comfort zone- we're not really lemon lovers and usually the chicken dishes I make involve some kind of sweet sauce and/or cheese, bacon or breading. but I wanted to try something different and thighs were on sale, so I went for it, and am I glad I did! I also tried something else new for me...I actually FOLLOWED THE RECIPE, almost to a tee. again, so glad I did, it was PERFECT and one of the BEST things I've ever made! only change was that I used skinless (bone in) thighs bc that's what I had, and baby Yukon's bc we love them. the only complaint was that there were not nearly enough potatoes... they were so delicious we were fighting over them! and so simple, too! thanx chef john, as always, delectable.

Sooo good. I love Greek food. Potatoes didn't brown despite leaving it in the broiler twice as long as stated. But still very good. I seasoned the chicken under the skin also. Think this may have added to the flavor. Also juices at the end seemed a bit oily so I didnt use it. Otherwise cooked as stated. Will definately make this again. This is Greek diner worthy.

It turned out fantastic! I only used half the amount of chicken (there is only 3 of us, one of which is a toddler) but kept marinade the same. I marinated for about an hour. Since I cut down on chicken,  I did not add chicken broth while cooking. Marinade kept chicken moist & tender but allowed skin to crisp up. Had no issues carmelizing potatoes either. Everyone loved it-will definitely make again!

I'd make it again. I'd add more lemon next time. Used boneless skinless chicken breasts, but next time I will try w/thighs w/ skin on - or even a whole chick cut up.  To keep it simple, I just put it all together in my lasagna dish. Roasted brussels sprouts as a side. Hubby liked it too.

Really nice recipe.  Fun and easy to make, great flavors and the potatoes come out so nice in a very old school kind of way.  Your family will really like this dish that is such a nice change from the 'same ole, same ole'.

I made this with skinless boneless chicken breasts and chicken thighs. I took the chicken breasts out after the first 20min. The chicken thighs and potatoes continued to cook as instructed. Everything was very very good!

2nd time making it: Used half the oil as suggested in other reviews and it was still awesome!

Absolutely Fabulous!  A new family hit!  Made it exactly  to recipe first time, second time shorted the olive oil a bit and marinated the chicken and spuds all day.  My daughter subbed chicken legs to please her kids and it was still wonderful! Tastes just like "Stephos" on Davie in Vancouver! Yum Yum Yum!

This is an elegant dish. I made it just as the recipe said. It was easy and made the kitchen smell wonderful. The chicken was very moist and the leftovers made a nice wrap the following day.

Great recipe; Chef John's so right about making it every week--it's my go-to chicken recipe, always a huge hit in my house. Must remember to buy cucumbers for the tzatziki sauce, though

This was outstanding. I wound up with too much liquid at the end tho, maybe too much oil or chicken fat. but it was still awesome. served it with wilted spinach and a nice Chardonnay .

This is a wonderful recipe. The only changes I made were to not use the chicken broth because the chicken I used was frozen and I find that there is always extra water in frozen chicken. I also added lemon zest since I was using fresh lemons for the lemon juice. I will be making this dish again!

This recipe is super delicious.  I've made it twice now and it has turned out exceptionally each time.  I let the potatoes and chicken sit in the marinade for about an hour, maybe less, while I made other things and I think that really enhanced the flavor.  I also cooked it in my oven using the convection roasting option which I think really enhances the process making the skin nice and crispy and the potatoes a lovely brown color.  I followed the recipe as it's written except right before cooking I sprinkled a little more dried rosemary and oregano on top of each chicken thigh, dried parsley on all of the potatoes and then lightly salted the entire tray.  My boyfriend who HATES all things lemon will make himself sick eating two plates of this dish and then beg to take it for lunch the next day at work.  Don't be scared of the lemon juice... it makes the dish delicious.

SO SO  GOOD EASY This was excellent. I did not use skin and bone in thighs, and would do that again. Flavor was great but
for us  I think I can cut everything. Less oil and Lemon juice
for sure. Watch the cayenne. Good but watch it. The broiling 
stage of potatoes so good. Served with spaghetti squash.
Could be company meal. Iloveit

Used skin on, bone in chicken breasts as that's what I had on hand. All came out moist and juicy, sauce was YUMMY, really liked the lemon flavor on the potatoes, skimmed off the oil from the sauce before thickening.

Great recipe and pretty simple to make! My husband said "this recipe is good, you should save the recipe." Lots of flavor :) FYI I used avocado oil instead of olive oil (avocado oil does not have much flavor so oil choice here should not adjust flavor) Using fresh lemon is key and did not skimp on the garlic ;)

We really enjoyed this, but I made it without the broth... The lemon and oil was enough marinade for the portion size I made. Also I thought it was a bit heavy on the garlic, so I would reduce that next time. All in all though a great recipe.

Loved it. Easy to make. I used small yellow potatoes instead of cutting up a russet. I do agree with the reviewers who suggested reducing the olive oil amount.  I will cut it by half next time. Will make this over and over again!

The best thing I've made in a while. Amazing recipe. The only thing I did differently was my chicken wasn't as brown as I liked so I broiled it as well when the potatoes broiled.

I loved this recipe! I only changed a few things. I did not have any lemons  so I used 1/2 cup of fresh squeezed orange juice. I also omitted the cayenne pepper. I used leg/thigh  quarters  and baked on 425 for about an hour. The potatoes melted in your mouth and the chicken was mouth watering. Very, very good. Thanks!

Delicious! My husband and 9 year old daughter cleaned their plates and asked for seconds. Followed recipe as written except substituted mixed potatos because it was all I had and used a little less olive oil because I ran out. Family asked to put it in the rotation, which is saying something when you can get everyone to agree!

Excellent! I only had chicken breast but forged ahead anyway. The seasoning and cooking methods gave me very tender moist chicken dinner. It was so good that we went right out and bought thighs and we're having that tonite.

I really liked this dish! I thought it might be too much olive oil and nearly held back but decided to go all in with 1/2 cup and I'm glad I did because it was delicious.

Delicious!  I used thighs so I reduced the oil to 1/4 cup which was perfect because of the amount of fat the thighs produced during cooking.  The chicken browned perfectly.  I used Yukon Gold potatoes and left the skin on.  It look a little longer than 3 minutes on broil for the potatoes to brown and crisp, but they turned out perfect as well.  Served it with some fresh green beans.  We eat a lot of chicken breast, which we love, but the thighs are a yummy way of mixing things up!

Wonderful dish. Changed the recipe to 3 lbs and didn'the add the chicken broth and it turned out great. The potatoes were roasted brown so I didn't need to broil them at all. Great tasting dish. Roasted carrots and Brussel sprouts in a separate pan.

Made exactly as written.  Easy to make and very tasty. Had to cook 1 hour to get nicely browned. Next time would half the olive oil.  My husband loved it.

I made this with bone in chicken breast. Followed the recipe with the following exceptions.  Used half the oil and baked for 1 hour at 375 degrees.  Also, thicken the drippings. It was delicious a definite keeper.

Easy and delicious!  I added some sweet potatoes to the mix and will definitely add more next time.  Without another side, more veggies roasting with the chicken will be a great way to boost the meal.

I LOVED the flavor the chicken had from this recipe, I added carrots as well as potatoes, I used less oil about 1/3 of of a cup will definitely use even less next time, was just a little too much for our taste.  Definitely will try this again!

Moist Awesome! I added carrots and it took a while longer to cook but WELL worth it! Another winner Chef John! Thanks! Do Not as others did and put refrigerator for an hour or so a head of time. If you do it takes twice the amount of time to cook it. Cook right away! Yummy! And always add carrots.

I've made this a few times and have perfected it, to our liking. Added a couple of extra garlic cloves, a large quartered onion and more potatoes. I turned the chicken over and browned the underside under the broiler then removed the chicken, crushed the potatoes a little with a potato masher and broiled for a few minutes. Delicious!!

Best roasted chicken I have ever made. Sometimes I don't add the potatoes and other times I add extra. I only add a splash of oil since I use chicken thighs and there is so much fat in the thighs. I serve this with steamed vegetables.

I love this recipe, I usually leave the skin on the potatoes, and use granulated garlic powder to save time.  I cook covered with foil, spraying the foil with olive oil spray first for about an hour depending on the types of pcs, then turn pcs and cook uncovered for 15-25 mins until brown to my liking.

This was really yummy. I made it with foster farms thighs. The marinade was on the chicken and taters for about 4 hours.

The intensity of the aroma out of the oven is far more intense than the flavor imparted to the chicken.  That's a good thing, because I was worried it would be overwhelmed with spice.

I overcooked the thighs - because they are soooooo fatty.  It took longer than the specifications to cook.  Finally turned the heat to 475 on convection to get the skins of the chicken as well as the taters to brown. 

The remaining pan materials were loosened up with canned chicken stock and defatted before pouring on the plates.

Flavor was intense and balanced.  Delicious.  Great job again Chef John!

My wife does not like potatoes and chicken thighs. She does now. Probably the best greek chicken and potatoes that i,ve had. Excellent.

Made this for the family last night.  Final product was delicious.  I'll be sure to make this again.
One thing I didn't like was dealing with the bones in the chicken.  Could this be made with boneless thighs?

So amazingly good!!! I don't have a roaster so I opted for a cake pan - too much liquid (my fault, I should have known when I added it) and so I drained off most of it after 40 minutes and then broiled to crisp the chicken. Then I finished the recipe as stated. Everything was caramelized and delicious. Next time I might use a sheet pan and will have extra lemons to finish - by next time meaning next week!
