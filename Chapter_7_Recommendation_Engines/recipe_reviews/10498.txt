Excellent Cookie to use up the Bran Flake crumbs no one wants.  I didn't use shortening - used butter instead for the flavor - and used raisins instead of peanuts.  I also used half whole wheat flour since my flour is always mixed! Yummy, and Chewey

I used Corn Flakes rather than Bran Flakes because that's what I had.  I dropped them by the tbs, not tsp and I got 24 cookies. Took 19 minutes of bake time but that could have been because they were bigger. Not very sweet but rather hard to just eat one. Matter of fact, I ate 4!

I also used half white, half wheat flour. I used butter, but the cookies spread too much, so next time I'll use shortening. The cookies also got hard very quickly in storage, but can be softened up quickly in the microwave. These are yummy cookies with a hint of peanut brittle taste that no one guessed were healthier than regular!
