I thought this was a great dish, but I do believe the recipe needs to be altered.  Two tablespoons of liquid did not seem nearly enough to cook something in the crockpot.  I used 1/3 cup of both syrup (I also had the lite kind) and soy sauce  I added a big squirt of honey and a few shakes of worcestershire sauce as well.  I used 1 teaspoon of each of the spices, used onion powder and fresh garlic as that is what I had on hand.  I was late starting this (about 1 pm) so I turned the crockpot on high.  It's a good thing I was home because it only took about 3 1/2 hours to cook.  I think 9 hours (even on low) would have been way too long, but I did use boneless country style ribs.  Overall a delicious recipe and I will make it again!

To those of you who find the sauce to thin, I have a tip for you when using your slow cookers! Place a 2 or 3 layers of paper towels over your slow cooker, then put the lid on. The paper towels will capture the moisture. I use this trick every time I make something that I don't want the sauce to get thin. Hope this helps! Many blessings to all!

I love this recipe. I have made it 4 to 5 times now, and have finally gotten it to the point where I think it is absolutely perfect. I use boneless ribs, which make less liquid in the slow cooker. I also double the maple syrup, since I use the sugar free type. I find that if I do it this way, when the time is up, I can pull the lid off of the slow cooker and the meat pulls apart beautifully. Also, if I want to switch it up a bit, adding a bottle of my favorite barbecue suace tastes great too. My fiancee loves this recipe and requests it often.

I made 2 pounds of Country Style pork ribs, doubled the soy sauce and maple syrup (to ensure those flavors wouldn’t be lost in the meat juices), lightly peppered the ribs instead of adding pepper to the sauce, and turned the ribs several times during cooking.  The sauce turned out very thin, more like a marinade or broth than a clinging or spreadable sauce; but that was expected and the ribs were very tender and flavorful just from being cooked in it.  My husband, who had never eaten ribs that weren’t slathered in BBQ sauce before, enjoyed these and I will be making this recipe again.  What a perfect combination; the convenience of the slow cooker for me and a main dish that my family likes.  Thanks.

I didn't have dried onion so I diced about half an onion and used that instead.  The only other change I made was to add a little minced garlic.  Very yummy.  I scaled the recipe to 6 servings and was worried that there would not be enough liquid to cook the ribs in.  The fat in the ribs rendered down and the ribs ended up all but covered in liquid.  I cooked on low for about 6 hours and the ribs were falling apart when we went to eat.  My family enjoyed it, a nice change from BBQ ribs.  I don't understand the reviewers who added BBQ sauce.  Why not just use a BBQ recipe to begin with?  I thought there was lots of flavor in this recipe.  For a better/stronger maple taste I would suggest using REAL maple syrup.  I will use this recipe again for sure!!

This was delicious! However, I did make a few changes. I doubled the sauce, adding one extra tablespoon of maple syrup (since I didn't have real maple syrup as other posters suggested) - and I made the sauce the night before and refrigerated until ready to use the next morning. I used boneless pork ribs, and marinated 2 hours in before turning my crock pot on. The family loved - every bit was gone. I did heat up some Montgomery Inn barbecue sauce for dipping. Scrumptous!

I first tried this recipe a couple of months ago, wanting to experiment with something other than chicken or beef (my dad thinks these are the only meats there are). This recipe is one of my family's favorites now, even my dad's.  It is extremely easy to put together, and always turns out spectacular!  I've read that some of you reviewers don't care for the flavor or found it not flavorful enough--try scaling the recipe to the amount of meat you have (look at the pounds on the package).  I make extra and freeze for later.  Delicious!!!!!

Increased the spices to 1 tsp and maple syrup and soy sauce to 1/3 cup (per other suggestions) and this was WONDERFUL

Thanks for such a great recipe!

My husband & I love this recipe. I added 1/2 a bottle of barbecue sauce along with all the other ingredients & slow cooked it for the full 9 hours. Needless to say the meat fell right off the bone. Delicious! This recipe is going to be used very often in my house. Thanks!

This recipe worked great for me and the sauce was just thick enough to coat the ribs.  My husband loved it . . .and he's really picky!

Not bad at all. Considering how easy it is, we'll probably have it again. I made it exactly according to the recipe, except that I had accidentally used too many ribs so I poured an extra tbsp or two of soy sauce and syrup over the top before cooking. Not too exciting, maybe trying something a little spicy would be nice -- a little extra ginger? -- but not bad as is.

I always use pure maple syrup.  You can throw all sorts of things in here.  Worcestershire, garlic chips, diced onion...I didn't have enough cinnamon tonight so I'm trying some nutmeg and cardamom.  One thing I recommend though is to go nuts with the ingredients if you want more flavour.  The first time I tried this recipe I found it tasty, but a bit dry.  Now I freepour the maple syrup, soy, etc. and shake a couple teaspoons of each of the spices to ramp it up.  I don't think you can really go wrong with this recipe and I love that it's all real ingredients and not manufactured sauce with a bunch of preservatives and things I can't pronounce.  Winner every time!

I used one minced, small onion and seasoned the ribs with pepper before topping with the sauce and let sit overnight.  Baked at 300 degrees for a little over 3 hours, covered except for the last 30-45 minutes, and this was absolutely delicious.  Tender and flavorful.  Note: this is not a barbecue ribs recipe, it will not taste like barbecue.

Followed directions except couldn't find the ginger. We don't like ginger anyway. Doubled and doubled again for the ribs I had. Excellent flavor, no BBQ flavor at all. Wonderful almost fall off the bone. Great smell and taste with rice on the side to accept the sauce. Definately try this for a different flavor.

Tasted good but unless the ribs were sitting in the marinade they were sickly pale. I put them on the grill for 20 minutes and basted them to get them a a darker color.

Pretty tasty. The sauce is kind of thin but it tastes delicious over white rice. I definately added more of the liquid ingredients. My husband and two year old loved the ribs.

I was looking for a different way to make a package of country ribs I bought on sale and came across this recipe.  I loved how this one sounded and it smelled delicious while cooking, but the flavor was just OK.  I may try it again but cut the soy sauce down to about 1/2 tsp. or so and increase the maple syrup to maybe 2 Tbl.  I used 100% pure maple syrup as we have a friend who makes it and that's all I ever have - and I recommend using the real stuff.  I used the left-over pork for fajitas the next night.  I liked them in that better than I did the first night we had them.

The meat turned out very tender - just perfect actually, but the flavor of the meat was not to our liking.  We had to smother it in BBQ sauce to cover the flavors of the cooked seasonings.

This recpie was ok. My husband loved it, I thought it turned out dry. I added extra liquid to this in the form of doubeling up the amount of maple syrup but in the end I don't think there is enough liquid to really make the ribs come out moist after the long cooking time. I thought the flavor was a bit bland as well. Overall I would probably add some more seasoning and liquid when I try it again.

The seasonings were as simple as can be to put together and pour over top of the ribs.  The result?  Meh.  The meat was definitely fall-off-the-bone tender and easy to shred for eating.  However, as far as flavor, there wasn't much of it.  It is rather bland and could use some pep.  Maybe some dry mustard or teriyaki sauce?   I do think that a lot can be done with it for use in other dishes, however.

This is fantastic! It's a hit every time and so easy to make for a crowd. I use gluten-free soy sauce for those who have a wheat intolerance or are celiac. The best part of this recipe is that it's a cinch to jazz it up if you want to, maybe add a bit of red chile pepper flakes for some heat. Thanks for posting!

Good flavor, but definitely needs more liquid. I more than doubled the soy sauce and syrup, and I even used fresh onion, thinly sliced, which gave off liquid as it cooked down - even so, the liquid cooked down to nothing leaving the pork a little dry. I'll try again, using more soy and syrup, and possibly adding some stock to keep the juices bubbling.

Did not care for the allspice in this recipe.  The ribs were tender, though.  I used the left-overs for pulled pork but added bottled BBQ sauce to hide the taste of the allspice.

This was awesome!!!  I'm not a big pork eater but this sounded so good and I knew my hubby would love it.  It was incredible!!  Had it for 2 day's dinner.  I happened to have real maple syrup on hand and I used boneless country ribs.  Sauce was not too thin, and I took the advice of some others here, adding more liquid and spice.  Will definitely be making again!  To die for.

I didn't try, but husband really liked it.  Had to add a lot more of the liquid ingredients to keep it from burning.  The number of hours on low setting is also way too long.

OMG!!!! What a great recipe.  I was concerned that the recipe did not call for any liquids, but I had faith.  The slow cooker was half filled with the juices by the 6th hour.  Thank you, definately will be doing this one on a regular basis!  WOW!

I loved this recipe, but I had to make changes to it. Firstly if you're looking for a bbq style recipe this is not it! I am not sure why the bbq keeps getting added when the taste is not even remotely close. They're great in their own right! I tried this because I wanted something that DIDN'T taste like bbq. I had 3 1/2 pounds of ribs so I obviously doubled the recipe. I also just used regular syrup from the cabinets! There was plenty of sauce for it to cook in. The sauce was perfect. It was thin, but I loved it like that. I don't think all sauces need to be gooped onto food. I actually put the sauce in a ramekin and dipped the pork in it, delish! I also used fresh onion way better in my opinion, and I actually marinaded it the night before, with a dry rub with all the spices plus brown sugar and syrup. I also went ahead and made the sauce the night before. Put it in the next day and it took about 7 hours on low and they were fall off the bone perfect. I definitely think the suggested 10 hours would leave it dry as a rock! Will be making again, thanks!

My husband is a rib fanatic being from Nebraska- "Go Huskers!" He told his family these were the best ribs he's ever had. I did use regular syrup as I didn't have maple on hand but they were wonderful!

Wow! That was a great recipe! I made it for the first time this evening, (well for 6 hours in my slow cooker), and it was a big hit in my house! Both my husband and my son loved them, and can't wait for me to make them again! The meat just fell off the bones! (I used the bone-in country ribs). I used a lot of the maple syrup and seasoning mixture, a lot more than it said. I also cooked 3 packages of the ribs, so I would guess about 5 pounds of ribs. I mixed up the mixture and then used a basting brush and made sure that every rib was covered with the mixture. The ribs made a lot of liquid, and that was great as this is what made them so moist! This is a new favorite in my house, a recipe that I will be adding to my list of regular menus that I rotate through. Just wonderful! Thank you so much for posting this recipe! How great to be able to make such great ribs without using a grill or cooking in an oven. I was able to go do all the errands I needed to this afternoon, and came home to a wonderful dinner. I want to also add that I cooked the ribs on high for about 4 hours, and then changed it to low for the final two hours. Simply scrumptious!

I chopped some of it up and mixed it with fried onions, peppers, mushrooms and seasoned salt & pepper, then served it on toasted sandwich rolls with cheese....delicious.  The meat is also good with barbeque sauce and would work well in mexican dishes.

These were good but needed a litte more kick to the sauce.  I skimmed some of the fat from the sauce and thickened it with a little cornstarch before serving.  I served them over rice and with lime wedges to squeeze over, and my husband liked them a lot.

Awesome recipe. The only change I made, I had around 2 lbs of ribs, but there was still plenty of flavor on them. Did not take as long as recipe suggests; I had to use my big crock because of the length of the ribs, and did Low for maybe 4 hours and then held it on Keep Warm til dinner. It was awesome :) Thank you Kimber for sharing.

This recipe couldn't have been easier and couldn't have been more tasty. The pork was juicy and delicious. Nice to have a different flavor other than barbeque for the pork. Served it with an apple/sweet potato casserole and cranberry sauce. No leftovers!

My hubby loved this recipe. The smell while cooking is to die for but the best part is eating these ribs, sooooo yummy.  I ran out of time to use my slow cooker so I had to use the pressure cooker. I added 1/3 cup of water and cooked for 35 minutes. This worked well when in a hurry but will use slow cooker the first chance I get.

These were sooo good! I think that 9 hours is too long though. I wouldn't go any longer than 7. Mine were a little burnt. The meat was so tender and loved the sweetness... we served it with rice.

I tried these for dinner this past week and was very disappointed.  I would have given them one star except that I suspect some of my disappointment was due to cook-error and not necessarily a bad recipe.  I will say, though, that the amount of liquid in the slow cooker did not seem like enough to adequately cook the meat and leave it juicy.

I think the first issue we had was that my husband bought boneless country style ribs.  And then I set my slow cooker on low for 9 hours.  After 9 hours the cooker switches over to "warm" and, in this case, stayed there for another two hours.  I have a feeling that "warm" on my slow cooker is "low" on everyone else's.  

Overall, though, the meat was incredibly dry and flavorless.  Again, whether this is due to the recipe, the fact that they were boneless, or the amount of time they spent in the slow cooker I don't know.  I do know, though, that I prefer recipes that are as error-proof as possible and this certainly isn't one of them.

Made this yesterday for my husband's birthday dinner and he loved it. It took maybe 5 minutes to put together and then I forgot about it for 7 hrs. The only thing I did differently (as was suggested by another reviewer) was to brown the ribs before putting them in the crock pot. Thanks for sharing.

This was a great recipe! I did double the recipe but pretty much used it as submitted with the exception that I used fresh onion and the dried onion. I also added about one tsp cloves (pork just seems to need cloves) I didn't think there seemed to be enough liquid so added about 2 TBS bourbon. I made this on Christmas Eve and the bourbon made it feel like it was really special. Served it with a mix of mashed sweet potatoes and yams. A hit with everyone. Will definetly do again!

I was a bit skeptical. Was there enough liquid? Would they be tender enough? Not to worry. I just cooked up 2 pounds of the most amazing baby back ribs using this recipe pretty much as is. (I added a cup of a commercial BBQ sauce.) Very tasty.

These were the best ribs ever!!  I'm not a big rib eater, but my husband is, so I tried these out and now I cannot get enough.  The sauce was perfect.  I did increase to the 1/3 cup also of the syrup & soy sauce, just so we had extra to dip in.  Try them, you'll love them!!!!

We got hungry from the sell of the ribs cooking! Our 15 yr old and 10 yr old loved this! We made sandwiches with the leftovers and it was still delicious. I did use an altered recipe that added more flavor. Great slow cooker choice!

This recipe was very bland and the sauce was way too thin. Even a friend of mine used the same recipe and had the same negative results. This recipe needs major modifications.

My family and I enjoyed these ribs very much.  They are different-the more we ate them the more we enjoyed. I combined all ingredients in my food processor (except for the ribs of course).  I used fresh garlic and onion instead of the dried.  I layered the ribs and sauce.  I certainly will make this again!!

Pass on this one.  I will call it tender, but it lacked flavor.  I doctored it up per the other reviews but it was just "fair".

This was a great recipe that tasted like one I fix in the oven with apples or pears and apple juice.  I might add some fruit to the slow cooker for the last hour or so (sliced pears or apples) and if I wanted a gravy (not necessary!) I could take the drippings and make a cornstarch gravy.  Thanks, my family loved it!

Oh My God, These were soooo good, my family couldn't stop eating them until they were gone. My brother tried some (and he doesn't like ANYTHING.) He loved them. They are so easy to make, that even I couldn't mess it up. 
Great job = 5 star
P.S. I also used 1/3 cup soy sause and 1/3 cuo maple syrup.

This was sooooo good! I cheated by using pumkin pie spice, also used fresh garlic and onion. I had lots of juice. I made this with homemade mac & cheese and stewed tomatoes. I put some of the juice in my stewd tomatoes. Took this to work as a thank you to my co-workers. NO leftovers! Everyone wanted the recipe! I will make this again. Next time I will make a beef roast using this recipe. I can not thank you enough.

I made these last night & woke up to the best smell this a.m. I didn't read any of the reviews beforehand. The combination of spices sounded good so I thought I'd try it. I had plenty of juice & the ribs fell off the bones. They are very, very good. Now that I have made them I read some of the suggestions. The only thing I would do differently, I think, is to double the syrup to give it a bit more of a sweet taste. I didn't have regular maple syrup - only lite. Other than that I think they're perfect.

This was a very strange recipe to make. I followed it just like it said. It had such a sweet smell cooking that I never thought that it would end up tasting good, but it did. It wasn't what we were expecting but it is a nice change from everything being smothered in BBQ sauce!!

If you like very flavorful food, this is NOT the recipe for you.  I had to add BBQ sauce to give this dish any flavor (Bull's Eye is a great sauce).  Next time, I will just make this with the BBQ sauce.

These ribs turned out great - they fell right off of the bone.  I took the suggestion of adding barbeque sauce (I like lots of sauce), and added 1 clove minced garlic, a few minced fresh mushrooms, and some diced red pepper, and garlic powder.  The sauce was wonderful, and so easy!  This will definitely be a winter recipe staple.

I thought these lacked a little in flavor even though I doubled up on the spices and used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  The ribs turned out  tender and juicy though.

I am not sure if I did anything wrong, but I ended up with alot of liquid from the ribs, which watered down the taste quite a bit.  My husband liked the ribs but I wasn't too crazy about them.

Great recipie, plus fast and easy! The issue I think some of you are having is that recipies generally use the real ingredient, ie the maple syrup. Real maple syrup does not come in lite, diet etc, and cooks completely differently. Something like using powdered eggs or egg substitute vs fresh eggs when baking a cake. All of the artificial ( flavored corn syrup etc) versions absorb and dry quicker than real maple syrup. Being a native Vermonters, there is never artificial here, not to mention artificial makes hubby deathly sick!!

Incredible flavor combo! I ran out of soy sauce so I added some worcheshire sauce and maybe doubled the maple syrup. I think this would be taken over the top with a punch of liquid smoke. The tip about putting paper towels under the lid of the crock pot really worked! Thanks!! Favorite pork recipe I've found yet.

Delicious.  These turned out fantastic and I used the advice of another who said to layer sheets of paper towel across the top and under the lid of the slow cooker.  This created a non-watery sauce for pouring on top of the ribs before serving.

Very easy, very yummy. Cooked 1.5lbs boneless in the crockpot on low for 5.5 hrs and it was very tender. My husband loved it, I'll be making this one again. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

My family and I loved it! It falls off the bone and is very juicy. I was worried there was not enough liquid at first but the fat renders down. Also, because at first there isn't a lot of liquid the pot seared some of the edges of the meat. It was great!

Awesome blend of flavors!  Following other reviewer's advice, I increased the amount of maple syrup and soy sauce to 1/3 c. each.  I've made it with this blend of spices and instead with Chinese Five Spice - both were equally tasty.  Usually use a lean pork roast instead of ribs, then shred it and mix in with the sauce - YUM.

I like so many others, found the flavors to be a bit bland. I used used bone in country style. I slow cooked them on my stove top for a little over 3 hours. That was all it needed. The sauce was extremely thin, so instead of using a commercial bbq sauce like a lot of reviewers had done, I mixed honey, minced garlic, a squirt of ketchup, a few dashes of woresteshire and a few pinches of brown sugar and places the tender cooked ribs on a cookie sheet. I glazed them with the pre-mixed sauce and put them in the oven for a bit... delish!

The ribs were tender but I found even with all the spices and maple syrup, they still were missing something.  The flavor was too blah.  Will probably not make them again.

This was a great recipe.  My husband wasn't crazy when I told him we were going to have Western Ribs but after his second helping I knew it was a hit.  I did make a few changes, and followed some of the other suggestions.  I had about 2 1/2 lbs of meat so I adjusted the sauce using the suggested 1/3 cup.  I used about 1 tsp of the the seasonings.  I put a rub on the meat of Garlic and Black Pepper before I put them in the slow cooker.  I also added 1/2 a teaspoon of chili powder for a little kick.  And I also added 1 table spoon of Teryaki sauce.  This was very YUMMY!  I served it with spinach and Garlic and Cream Cheese Mashed potatoes.  I will make this again for sure!

I did not have ribs so I used 4 pork chops, and followed a reviewers advise to use 1/3 cup for the liquids.  Then I doubled the recipe and added carrots and let it all simmer.  The only change that I would make is to double everything except for the onions and the cinnamon. Used a little corn starch to thicken the juices and served it all over rice.  Amazing!  We all loved it and will make again!

Very good! I used 1/3 cup of the maple syrup and soy sauce when I did mine. Even my picky husband liked them and gave the thumbs up for making them again. I thought the flavor was good but it is somewhat mild so if you're looking for bold or spicy go elsewhere.

They were delicious but took forever to cook all the way through. I only had 3 ribs in the slow cooker, but after 7 hours it still wasn't completely done. It looked done on the outside--nice and brown, meat falling off the bone--but the meat was still bloody near the bone. So I took it all out--meat and sauce--and cooked it on the stove. I let it boil and then covered it and let it simmer for about 15 minutes.

These ribs tasted pretty good.  I think using the mixture as a marinade and then grilling or broiling would taste better and have a better texture.

I made this recipe on friday as it's a busy day for me and I wanted to try it for some time. What a dissappointment. These ribs were flavorless. I will say they were fall off the bone tender but without flavor it was a very boring dinner. I did what others suggested by adding 1/3 cup of soy sauce and maple syrup but it was just not what I had hoped for. I could taste the spices somewhat but it was very blah. I won't be making this one again.

I'd rate this at about 3.5 stars.  Unlike others - I had no issue with not enough liquid and I trimmed the pork very well(but I did use 2T each syrup and soy sauce) - .  I had enough liquid that I added a little cornstarch to make it a gravy and served it over rice.  I'll absolutely make this again.

I should have stopped cooking it at 5-6 hours, instead of the full time.  It was tasty, but a little dry.

Oh, boy.  I was really surprised at how badly this turned out.  I adore all of the ingredients and thought this sounded like a winner of a recipe, but when everything was combined,  the 'warm' spices were simply overwhelming.   I followed the recipe to the letter, even wondering if the 1/4 tsp. of each spice would be enough to taste...  Taste it I COULD.  Like pumpkin pie smeared on ribs!  Thanks for the post anyway.

I am glad this has received great reviews, but when I got home tonight, mine was burnt to an unrecognizable point.  Not enough liquid is my guess.  The combo sounds good, but when I put something in the crock-pot, I want to be sure that it doesn't require constant supervision.  I didn't feel this way (nor does the smell of my home attest to this conclusion).  Sorry, but it didn't work for me.  In fact, I set the crock-pot to cook at low temperature for only four hours and then it sat at a warming/sustaining temperature for another four; well within the 7-9 hours allotted.

Overall, a fairly good recipe. It was 
-15 degrees the day I had planned to grill our country style ribs, so I ended up making this recipe so I could stay inside (&warm!). 
The meat was so tender it fell off the bone, but I did add about 6 cloves of garlic to the crock pot during cooking to give it more flavor which worked well (if you like garlic...). I served them with a little Mr. Yoshida's teriaki sauce for dipping instead of the juice in the crock pot which was tasty. Thanks for the recipe!

I followed recipe with one exception, I doubled the maple syrup because I only had lite.  I was good, I did not add BBQ sauce but did thicken the sauce in slow cooker and poured over ribs.  This was the first time I had ever made country style ribs and it was a sucess.

This was good! But it did not taste like maple so right before I served it I drizzled just a litlle warmed maple surup over it. Then it was fantastic!

Sooo good, I would give this 5 stars just for the way it smells when youre throwing it together. I like using boneless pork strips, other than that wouldnt change a thing! Check it after 7 hours and I think it would be fine. So good served with some baked sweet potatoes, corn bread and a salad.

We use boneless country style ribs and add 1/2 bottle of BBQ sauce to this recipe.  We don't cook them until they fall apart (more like 4-5 hours on low) and then grill them for a few minutes on our gas grill.  They make wonderful sandwiches or just serve like BBQ'd pork chops with your favorite side dishes.  This is one of our favorites, and we have never had a problem with lack of taste as other reviewers have.

I used 2lbs of boneless ribs so I used a whole cup of each the maple syrup and the low sodium soy sauce. I used 1 tablespoon of each spice and added about 1/3 cup of honey and a heaping table spoon of molasses. After a couple hours in the crock pot I added whatever bbg sauce (not a sweet kind) to cut the sweetness to my liking. The final product had a great tangy taste. Turned into absolutely delicious pulled pork!!!My boyfriend says it's his favorite version of pulled pork so far! Will definitely make again.

This was amazing!!... with a few adaptations. I excluded the allspice and replaced it with 1/2 cup bbq sauce. I also followed the advice of putting a few paper napkins over the slow cooker, then putting the lid on (to thicken the sauce). Also, mine was fully cooked and falling off the bone in 5 hours. Would make this again!

I went by recipe, but i really don't care for the cinammon, so i tweeked it with a few dashes of worcestershire, a squirt or two of mustard, ketchup and 1 tbs apple cider vinegar. I plan to make it again, with less cinammon and add honey.

This was sooo delicious! I used boneless country pork style ribs and they were amazing. I didnt have dried minced onion so I used fresh and I dont use soy sauce because I eat paleo so I used Tamari with no taste differences.  This recipe is a keeper!

A very easy and tasty dinner done in the crockpot; my wife and I both enjoyed it. One note - make sure to use high quality maple syrup. It makes a difference, and using a lower quality couls effect the overall taste. Definately a keeper.

According to my husband, "this has a mild but delectable taste"! LOL! I didn't have any onion or allspice. I had 6 pounds of ribs but I only doubled the recipe since I only had 2 tablespoons of soy sauce left. It's the end of the month; what can I say? It was good. Hubby says it's a keeper. It is great to have a maple flavoured recipe. I get tired of BBQ sauce all the time. Thanks!

The meat turned out really tender and the sauce was good, it was just soooo thin (like almost broth consistency).  We ended up having to use our refridgerated BBQ sauce to pour over the ribs  on our plates, if we had used the sauce in the crockpot it would have been like a soup.  The ingredients did give a nice flavor for the meat to cook in, but in the end our store bought BBQ sauce was what we tasted.  I didn't know if thickening it with flour or cornstartch would have helped (I would have had to use alot)

These are very good.  A different taste than you typically get with ribs (having grown up on BBQ)-- much more subtle. Some might find the flavor a little bland and need a little more seasoning, but with good ribs, it lets the flavor of the meat through!

I made this earlier in the week and everyone ate it all. My son rated it "double thumbs up". I am making again today. I did double the sauce ingredients because i had more ribs. Flavors aren't overwhelming and i might try adding some BBQ sauce when on the plate. Very easy to do as i mix the sauce right in the crockpot and you don't have to brown/sear the meat.
I made this again, but should have tripled the liquid 'cause it was too dry. Otherwise it was very good.

The flavor of this recipe was great, it was super easy, everyone like it, & I'd make it again. I didn't have a slow cooker, but it didn't matter. Cooking time was about 3.5hrs maybe less. I doubled the sauce, & added about 1/4c of bbq sauce & 1/2c water. So tender & the whole house smelled so good during cooking. Really tasty!

This was very good. I added alittle more soy sauce and cooked one hour longer. Everyone at dinner really enjoyed. I cooked wide egg noodles and put meat on top with wheat biscuits.

I made this recipe not expecting too much because it was so easy but I was fooled.  The meat was falling off the bones and it was tasty and gave enough juice to use over noodles or rice.  I'll make this again and again.

Love this recipe! So simple, yet so delicious. But, I did make some changes. I followed others advice, used 1/3 cup of maple syrup and soy sauce, but I also added 2 cups of beef broth, so that the meat was completely covered. This eliminated the dryness experienced with my first two tries on this recipe, but retained the fall-off-the-bone tenderness. Also, the broth didn't dillute the flavors, as the 2 cups of water did on try #2. This is now a family favorite!

I thought this recipe turned out good. It was a nice change from the usual way I woiuld make country style ribs by just drenching the meat in BBQ sauce and letting it simmer all day.

The only change I made was to first add some BBQ sauce at the bottom of the Crock Pot in order to provide a little more liquid. I also used a fresh onion instead of dry.

After it was done the sauce tasted great and the ribs were tender with great flavor.

I'd definately make this again!

This was delicious! The only change I made was Worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce.  I used boneless pork ribs and I did it on High for three hours.
I must admit that the others scared me so I added more syrup on the top. They even "browned" on the parts touching the crockpot. p.s. mine is the original old model crockpot.

I love country style ribs, and i love using my slow cooker. This recipe was so delicious. It's quite sweet though so for people that don't like their hot food sweet, you might not want to try it. My family and i loved it. The ribs came out so tender. I served it over rice. MMM MMM Good!!

The house smelled great when I came home.  I was super excited to eat this delicious smelling dish.

Alas, I was held up and came home later than expected.  The ribs cooked for an hour more (darn professor!) than the recipe stated.  

However, if the ruined version of this recipe is an indicator, the meat is super tender (too much so after an extra hour, but I bet it's great when cooked properly!), and very flavorful.  

This was also a super easy recipe to put together.

Thanks for posting!

These didn't look very appetizing, so I took them out of the juice and baked for 1/2 hour with Masterpiece barbeque sauce. They were very tender and my family loved the flavor. The slow cooking and the combination of flavors was wonderful. However, without the  barbeque sauce to give them some life - I don't think I could have gotten my family to eat them. It's now a favorite.

I don't know what I could have done different as I followed the recipe to a 'T' but the flavor was terrible. The meat was falling apart which was the only good thing. My husband and two kids who love country style ribs wouldn't touch it.

The combination of flavors in this recipe was strange to say the least.  The cinnimon and allspice scent while cooking in the crockpot was overpowering, and the taste was not much better.  I thought I'd try this recipe because I love ribs, but my hubby does not like anything with BBQ sauce, so thought this would fit us both.  Definately not!!  The only thing good about this recipe, in my opinion was that after 9 hours in the crockpot, the meat was very tender.  Sorry!

Yes, the sauce was "thin," but so what? I'm not sure this sauce is supposed to be thick!  It was tasty, and this recipe made plenty of sauce just as it was written. Reminded me a lot of something mom would have made.  I don't do much cooking, but I could see myself making this again.

I LOVE this recipe! As others before me I make more sauce with it. I but the family pack of country style ribs which is usually about 4 lbs. increasing the maple syrup to 2/3 cup and doubling every other ingredient makes plenty of sauce. And I usually dice an onion instead of using dried onion. Sits in the crockpot on low 12 hrs or so until we get home from work. DELICIOUS!!!!

This was excellent!  Love the taste of the sauce!  Used the ingredients listed.  If you're looking for a "BBQ" sauce taste, best off just buying some BBQ sauce and dumping over the ribs.  But I was looking for something "different" instead of the same old bbq tasting ribs.  This was defiantly a whole different taste and I loved it!!!  More of a sweet/savory sauce.  I really enjoyed the taste, so I added a little bit of corn starch to thicken the sauce so it would stick to the meat!  Delicious!!!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!!!  It is a keeper!!!!

Loved this! I did however, follow the reviews that said to increase spices to a teaspoon and the syrup and soy sauce to 1/4 cup.  I had very thick , meaty southern style ribs and they  took only 7 hours to cook to perfection.  Once cooked, I brought the juices to a boil and thickened a little with corn starch, then poured over the ribs and cooked noodles.  Hubby loved these and he's really not crazy about ribs (I am!).  Easy prep, great on the palate, easy clean-up...can't ask for more than that!! Thanks for sharing!!

This is not very good.  It has burnt notes and the meat gets very dry.  I would not waste good ribs on this.  I am being generous with a one star.

I don't know what happened. I followed the recipe even though it seemed odd not to add liquid to the slow cooker.  The meat came out extremely dry.  We liked the flavor of the spices, but it was so dry we couldn't eat it.

This was absolutely fantastic. My 13 year old daughter loved these ribs. I put my country style ribs in the crockpot over night. I did add more syrup and worschestire sauce than the recipe called for. I was skeptical of making ribs with syrup; but it was so juicy and tasty. I absolutely love this recipe. This will be a staple in our house!! I made the ribs in my crockpot overnight, took them out in the morning before work, placed ribs in a corning ware covered in aluminum foil in the fridge, and reheated for dinner after work. Very pleased!!

I have made this 20+ times. It is very easy and tastes good. It is a solid 4+ star for taste but I gave it 5 because it is also easy to make and hard to mess up.  

The multiple reviews that say to increase the sauce I agree with. The biggest thing I have done to help the taste is to mix the spices (except for the mixed onion which I add as recomended)  in a shaker and  add them lightly before cooking and then lightly or to taste just before eating. I don't get real worried about perfectly matching the amount with the recipe as it seems to be very forgiving.

We didn't care for the cinnamon and allspice flavors with the meat. I added BBQ sauce when I served it, which improved the flavor, but I won't make this again.

I used boneless ribs, about double the amount (so doubled everything else) but while the meat turned out very tender, I found it somewhat bland.  Maybe because the meat was all meat and no bone, it generated a lot of liquid and maybe diluted the spices; we ended up topping it with bbq sauce.

I am not really a cook but I tried to make this recipe and the pitiful amount of liquid certainly did not look like the photo on the recipe page. So I added a cup of broth. The second time I made it I didn't add the broth. I waited the allotted time (7 hours) but the sauce was much too done. Maybe my slow cooker is too fast but next time I will go for 4 to 5 hours.

Very tasty but you do have to add more syrup and soy sauce, whichever you prefer.   I agree that it doesn't have to cook for 8 hours on high, 4 hours on high is sufficient.

I made this twice... the first time, I looked at the amount of meat, and the amount of sauce and thought nope....that is never gonna work for me! So I added our favorite bbq sauce. just enough to cover the meat and it was good. The second time I added a cup of bbq sauce to the recipe mixture added it to the meat and let it simmer. IT was a hit!

I too was worried that there was no liquid in the crockpot at the beginning of cooking --  but the meat releases its own juice.

Smelled great in the crockpot. Tasted pretty good. I did add extra syrup, soy sauce, worcestershire, doubled spices because I had 2-1/2 pounds of ribs. Still too much liquid. I would add cayenne and something to thicken the sauce. Will probably try again and adjust considerably. A good place to start.

I deviated a bit from the recipe, but the base is good.  I left out cinnamon (for some reason cinnamon and meat together just seems weird) and added some honey, Worcestershire, and sweet chili sauce.  The cooking time is too long.  I did them on low for four hours and that was beyond plenty.  So do yourself a favor and don't set them on low for an entire work day, because you will come home to some burnt pork. I also think that meat should always be seasoned, so I seasoned mine before I put it in the crock pot.

No taste to the sauce by the end of cooking.  But the meat was tender and we just dipped it in bottled BBQ sauce.

This recipe is super easy and super delicious.  Made just a few changes...used 1/3 cup of the Maple Syrup and Soy Sauce and add some Worcheshire Sauce.  I used fresh garlic in lieu of garlic powder and added 2-3 tbsp of honey.  I had boneless country style ribs and cooked it on low for about 4 hours.  So very delicious!!!

Thanks to everyone's reviews, these turned out amazing. I'll always cook country ribs this way.
I added 1 cup BBQ sauce to the recipe.
I used the paper towel under the slow cooker lid which is a trick I learned here by another reviewer (thank you). It was soaking wet when I got home from work. Cooked the ribs for 9 hrs low then my slow cooker turns to warm. The ribs looked dry/overcooked but they were amazing. Fell off the bone and were tender and still juicy. The sauce was amazing and had infused itself into the meat. Yum!

This is decent.  Gives the ribs a nice flavor though a bit dry.  Not sure if it is the recipe or what, but I didn't get that "fall off the bone" type of meat.  My 17-month-old ate it though so it couldn't be that bad.

The pork was incredibly tender and the flavor was great! I ended up doubling the recipe, and then added a 1/3 cup water to dilute the soy sauce. I was concerned the pork would be too salty otherwise, and that there wouldn't be enough liquid in the pot while we were at work all day.

I went along with some of the notes below, 2lbs ribs, and doubled all of the rest. Used the papertowels at the beginning, but with how quickly the meat cooked on low, I had to add some more ingredients and 1/2 cup water. But meat turned out wonderful, great flavors, and is a keeper!

I made this recipe as is with the exception of a couple things.  I had 3 pounds of Ribs, so doubled all of the spices, except the minced onion I only used about 2 1/2 tablespoons.  I used 1/2 cup of syrup, and yes I just used my regular pancake syrup that I had in the fridge.  I then used 1/4 cup of soy and 1/4 cup of teriyaki.I put the ribs in about 11:30 on high for about 4 hours, then on low for the last 2 and they turned out PERFECT.  We had a couple over and everyone LOVED them.  They completely fell apart, were very juicy and moist and flavorful.

This recipe is definitely a keeper! The meat became so tender that it could be easily pulled apart. I threw in some carrots towards the end so I used more liquids than the recipe suggested, and the whole thing was delicious.

Mild flavoring but nice..it didn't over-power the pork flavor. Something different than the usual pork in barbecue sauce. It didn't create a sauce that was thick that clings to the meat like BBQ sauce, which I was actually hoping for.  But..it was o.k.

As per the suggestion of other reviewers, I increased both the maple syrup and the soy sauce to 1/3 cup each. Other than that, I followed the recipe. Nobody disliked it, but nobody was wowed by it either.

I made this the time last night for my daughter and her husband. I followed the recipe, doubling the maple syrup & soy sauce (made 4 lbs of pork ribs). The meat fell off the bones, but was dry and practically tasteless. Would use BBQ sauce the next time !!

I, and some of my co-workers loved this. I kind of overdid it on the soy sauce. I added a little more of soy and let it cook a little too long. It was still delicious, but too salty (probably of the overdose of soy sauce and a little overcooking). Most of my mechanics ate it just the way it was and loved it. A couple guys decided to rinse off the extra sauce under the sink, and both gave me a thumbs up after finishing the meal. 
Will try again, but will lower the amount of soy next time.
One extra thing,....I used beef instead of pork ribs.

Made this the other day for my husband who is strictly a grilled rib man, he loved it and so did I! Great flavor. I took the advice of another poster and used 1/3 cup syrup & soy sauce, as the recipe just didn't seem like enough liquid. Came out great - will make again.

Very yummy recipe.  I too followed others advice and increased the soy sauce and maple syrup (I used 1/3 cup of each).  I used the low sodium soy sauce  which was great because it added the right amount of sodium to the ribs.  Prior to cooking the ribs, I used all of the dry ingredients as a dry rub and added some chopped onions since I didn't have onion powder.  I let it sit for about an hour and I think it added to the flavors.  One thing though, I set the cooker for 10 hours so it would cook extra slow while I was away.  Good thing I came home early because the ribs were done by the time I got home which was 4 hours after I started cooking them (they were probably done in 3.5 hours).  The meat was literally falling off.  It was the right amount of sweet, not too sweet which was good.  Next time I think I really need to be home to check them (sort of defeats the whole leave it for several hours concept) but I will definitely make them again.

I have lost my dry rub recipe and I'm trying to find a replacement.  This sounded pretty good, but I think I'll go back to dry rubs.  Too messy - although ribs are kinda supposed to be messy, huh?

I can't currently have tomatoes so I was really excited about this recipe but I really didn't care for the flavor.  I used real maple syrup, marinated the meat and doubled the sauce as others had suggested.

We were not thrilled with this recipe, needs something to bring a bit of juice but then you would need to increase all the other ingredients as not to dilute spices.

I didn't love it, I didn't hate it. I thought it was pretty good, but I probably won't make it again. I'm looking for the perfect recipe for country ribs...still looking. Thanks!

A real dissapointment.  I didn't taste much maple at all.  All I got was spiced ribs with not much juice.  I added a bbq sauce and brown sugar glaze (basted on and then broiled) to save them.

It was good - and I enjoyed it - but I am not so sure I enjoyed SOOOOO much that I would make it again.I think it needed more sauce to give the side (rice or whatever) some flavoring as well.

This recipe is fast and easy to prepare. There is no browning of the meat, yet the end result has the ribs looking appetizingly dark. My husband and I both enjoyed it, and I will make it again.

These were okay.  I probably won't make them again simply because I prefer ribs with barbeque sauce.  I followed the recipe exactly and the ribs were tender, but a little dried out on the ends.  They were not bad once you added some barbeque sauce to dip them in.

This recipe was just OK to me.  After reading other reviewer's comments, I marinated the meat in the spices and maple for about 5 hours prior to cooking it.  It was still a bit bland for my liking.  The meat came out tender, but that really can't be attributed to this recipe.  That is the case with all meat that you slow cook for 7 or 8 hours.  I put maple on it after it was cooked as well, but that still only "kicked it up" a small notch.

This was great. Good change from Bar-B-Q Sauce. Husband loved them. Do not change or alter the recipe. Slow cooking I think is the key to the flavor.

These were excellent!!! I doubled the recipie to accomodate my extra ribs.  I didn't have real maple syrup so I used regular instead...it was very sweet, but no one in my house complained about that!!!  I also didn't have enough dried onion, so I used 3/4 fresh chopped instead.  We will be enjoying this one again!

My family really enjoyed these ribs.  We all loved the flavor.  My husband always wants me to make these ribs.  I actually do add a bottle of barbeque sauce.  I haven't tried it without the barbeque sauce. After adding the barbeque sauce I rate this a 5 star recipe.

These were 'ok'. I didn't care for the sweetness of the maple syrup. Although the meat did come out very tender and juicy. My family didn't care too much for these..

I probably shouldn't rate this recipe at all because the only things I followed were using ribs (boneless, country-style) and the fact that it was cooked in a Crock Pot.  I seared the ribs first, put them in the crock and covered them with some homemade barbecue sauce that I'd canned last year.  Covered and cooked for about 7 1/2 hours.  Ribs were extremely tender, and I'll definitely use this method again.  I might even follow the recipe!

These were pretty good.  I added a bottle of barbeque sauce as suggested by someone previously.  Cooked in the crock-pot, they were falling off the bone.  Pretty good, but not spectacular.  Definitely easy.

This was my first dish made with the crock pot and I am now a believer in its wonders and in this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The combination of the spices was perfect.   By the time I woke up the next morning, my husband had already devoured the left-overs.  I will make this again. (Only draw back to making it every day is that I am watching my cholestorol...it was slightly greasy...I believe this is just the nature of pork.)

This was ok but the flavor didn't really get into the pork. I'm going to try it again b/c maybe I just had more pork than the recipe called for, when you did taste it it was good but next time I'll probably double the recipe and see if there is a difference.. the smells that go through your kitchen are wonderful!

I followed the recipe exactly and it seemed to lack flavor.  BF put them on the grill after the slowcooker and that improved them somewhat - along with a with a liberal splash of BBQ sauce.

This was just OK. The flavor of the maple didn't come through at all, which was disappointing. Maybe add more syrup? I did like cooking them in the crock pot. They turned out very tender.

This recipe was just "OK".  The meat was tender and fell off the bone, but there was not much flavor.  I "might" make this one again, but if I do, I will need to add more spices to give it some flavor.

An OK recipe for an easy, week night meal.  I used fresh garlic and ginger and doubled the amounts but the meat still did not pick up as much flavor as I would have wished.

So easy to make! I used boneless pork country style ribs and they were very tender after 7.5 hours. I expected more flavor from the seasonings but they were still pretty good. My husband and five-year-old really liked this recipe and it's a great way to make ribs.
