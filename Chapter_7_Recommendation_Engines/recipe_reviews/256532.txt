Only substitution I made was to use the frozen 3-pepper and onion blend because itâ€™s what I had on hand. Easy and great recipe!

I think adding the Creole seasoning added a lot to this dish. I wouldn't change a thing on this recipe.

This was super easy and very tasty,  The Creole seasoning really added a nice zip.
