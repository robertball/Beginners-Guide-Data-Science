I used this as a helper when making chile con queso yesterday.  I tend not to follow recipes exactly, so... I didn't add the onion.  I saute√©d the tomato as suggested.  My cheese was Mexican.. but was called Queso for Quesadillas.  I like things spicy, but since I made this for a work function, I used pepper jack and my Quesadilla cheese had chiles in it also.  It was really good.  Will definitely use this idea again.  The only thing I wonder is how to make it not so shiny, glossy, gluey... That is not what I remember from restaurants.  In any case, very good!

I didn't want to bother with the onions, tomatoes and peppers so I just added some picante sauce to the melted cheese.  It turned out great!!

First let me say for those who tried this and found that the cheese separated and was oily - I think I figured out the problem there.  

First, heat the milk you use to thin the queso, don't use cold-from-the-fridge milk.  I learned this last year making mashed potatoes and it makes a HUGE difference.  I made this recipe twice in 48 hours - the first time I heated the milk and the cheese melted perfectly, the second time I used cold milk and the cheese immediately started to look grainy.  

Second - make sure you don't overheat it, this will also cause the cheese to break down and the fat/oil will rise to the surface.  Unfortunately, I used cold milk AND overcooked the 2nd batch so it was a visual disaster, but everyone still loved it.  

If you have trouble finding Asadero cheese (I couldn't find any) you can use queso fresco but make sure it's not too crumbly.  I got mine at a local Mexican market and it was a tad like string cheese so it melted into stretchy, creamy goodness with chiles in it. I also threw in a jalapeno with the other veggies for an extra kick.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was quite stringy still from the shredded cheese, and hardened on our burritos... Perhaps it needed more milk? I stirred the cheese in for about half an hour and it was not getting melted down enough no matter how much I stirred... I might try this again, but add more milk next time.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was oily and it seperated.  The taste was pretty bland.  I think I'll follow the advice of playing with it to make it better.

Yum! I'm one of those who struggles with getting the cheese to blend into sauces (I'm sure it has something to do with realizing what a good melting temp should be...., at least, I'm pretty sure....). With this recipe, I had the same problem, but this time, I didn't give up.  The flavor of the glumpy mess was too good to give up on, so I simply got out my hand blender wand and gave the mess a whirl.  Sure enough, success!  --- It wasn't quite as smooth as I would have wanted (again, probably a temp issue), but I simply warmed the smoothed out sauce slowly until it became much smoother.  As per the suggestion of the user who used picante instead of veggies, we substituted salsa verde.  Also, in the end, we decided that using extra milk and salsa verde made for a lower fat version of the same thing.  At first, the change seemed a bad idea - after all, we were used to a lot more cheese clinging to our tortillas, but with a second thought, it seemed just fine - more a state of mind than anything, it seems - and from that point we simply enjoyed it.  THEN IT OCCURRED TO US THAT, WITH EXTRA MILK, THIS CLEARLY WOULD MAKE A GREAT CHEESE SAUCE FOR ENCHILADAS...... SUPER YUM!  Thanks for a great recipe, and a clue as to how to alter it into more great things..... Queso asadero rocks!  This German didn't know just how much more meltable it is until now, but I'm sure glad to know now, finally!

Thanks for this authentic recipe.Sounds  just like what my favorite Mexican restaurant in Westchester, NY serves over their seafood dish. Will be trying it next time we cook mexican style sea food.

I was more excited with the idea than the end result.  I added more milk to make it more sauce-like in texture.  It was good, but not as good as I was hoping.  We threw it on some nachos with refried beans and sour cream.

The flavors were good, but the cheese never fully melted and never became smooth like real authentic con queso. Next time I would let melt for longer time.

This recipe did not work for me.  I ended up with a stringy glob of cheese in a pool of liquid.  I cooked and stirred for some time trying to incorporate the liquid into the cheese but I was unsuccessful.

This is queso is very mild in flavor, and in my opinion the 1/4 c. milk is too much. I had to simmer it down for 10 minutes so it would thicken up. Thanks for posting Melony1976 :)

I tried this recipe, for the cheese just use white American cheese, cut it in chunks and melt it with some milk, no need for the oil. If you like it hot use some jalapeno juice and diced jalapeno.  A trick I learned to keep it creamy is to add a can of cream of mushroom soup, it may sound gross but you will never know it is in there. I whole can with about 2 lbs of cheese. You can add what ever you like,
tomatoes, onion, chili peppers, or a can of rotel.

I love this dip!  I made it as is and it was delicious.  For the shredded chicken, i took two frozen chicken breasts, and added them to a pot of water - to the water I added some cumin, corriander, garlic salt, salt and pepper, emeril seasoning, 3 dried red peppers, and chicken boullion powder.  The chicken was so flavorful!  This recipe was awesome as is, but the last time we made it we tried refried instead of black beans and that turned out delicious as well.  Def will be making this one for yrs to come.

So good and I love that it uses real cheese and not Velveeta. If your cheese is not melting right make sure you are shredding the cheese yourself and not buying pre-shredded cheese. Store bought shredded cheese is coated so it does't stick together so it's ok as a topping but not so good for making cheese sauce or dips.

This is to be eaten as soon as it is ready. Don't think about slow cookers.
This is what you get in American Mexican restaurants when you order queso most of the time.  It will separate if left too long. I give it a 4 because it was exactly what I expected for a queso base. If you want to reduce the oil content, drain the oil from the veg.  The cheese will release oil also which is the main reason to eat when originally combined.  If you think it's bland, salt or spice.  I found it needed more spice and a small amount of salt.  But the recipe did say season to taste.

I had to add a lot more cheese and milk to make it look anything like queso.  It never became creamy at all, but stayed stringy.  I did not have fresh asadero so I had to use the pre-bagged stuff from Kroger.

I thought this was great! I only used what I had on hand, so I ended up using some shredded Mexican cheese which wasn't all white and shredded cheddar. I also didn't have that many chili peppers so used the banana peppers from the farmers market I recently wen to. I doubled the milk and cheese amounts as well as added sausage. Fantastic!

This is not authentic chile con Queso...more like a  fundido.  Original recipe did include Velveeta and originated as  TexMex "cuisine".  Many variations including adding  breakfast sausage.
Velveeta eliminates the problems of  oily  "other" cheese that breaks down and ends up being tossed.

The flavor was good, but as others have mentioned, the cheese and milk never blended together.  I think I'll try it again, but next time I will add two tablespoons of flour to the vegetable/oil mixture before mixing in the milk and cheese.  Hopefully that will remedy the separated, messy glob I was left with.

I will certainly make this again. Made it for a poker party and everyone loved this chile con queso.
