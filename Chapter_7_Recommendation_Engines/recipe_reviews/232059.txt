Left the recipe just as it was.  When I finished I carved out a loaf of Italian Round Bread and put the Egg Appetizer inside.  Carved up another loaf for scooping and dipping.  Was gone inside 10 minutes and I used 3 dozen eggs!  Was absolutely delicious - a keeper!

I added a few spices to the egg mixture (onion powder, garlic powder, dill weed, fresh ground pepper, salt, sprinkle of paprika) but other than that I kept to the recipe. I served half of this with Townhouse crackers and stuffed the other half in celery. This was a little too mayonnaise-y for us but we still ate every bit of it. Great base recipe--I can already see the variations on additions.

This dip was amazing and people devoured it before all others!  I served it with a sliced baguette but any lightly seasoned cracker would be great too.  The only thing I added was a little salt and pepper and about 1/3 cup of bacon bits because that's how I do my regular deviled eggs. This one is a hit!

Simple to make, delicious to eat. I served it with Club crackers, went over pretty well. I did chop only the 5 egg whites, the rest was blended in.  I made it how I usually make deviled eggs, so I added in some sweet pickle relish instead of the vinegar. Added a few spices as well as salt and pepper. Would definitely make again.

This is easy to whip up and good. It's something different to try if you like deviled eggs or egg salad. I added a bit more hot sauce than called for and some black pepper. When I first tried it right after mixing, I thought it had too much white wine vinegar, but after sitting in the fridge a bit, the taste was just right.  I served with torn Hawaiian bread rolls and pita crackers.

It was good and I will make it again, with a slight reduction of the vinegar. Thank you for your submission.

A friend brought this to a girls get together. Very tasty, and healthier than some dips. Looking forward to making it .

I made this for Easter brunch. It was very tasty and I will make it again but I would reduce the sauce. It was just a little too watery for my family and I.  But it was very yummy and will be made again.

Excellent recipe—or idea, actually. I added more mustard and a little sriracha along with a sprinkle of za’atar. The group devoured it. Served with pretzel crisps.

just made this for a Thanksgiving appetizer. great idea! best thing I did was mix the mayonnaise and other items before I blended the eggs. every family has there own deviled eggs recipe. so I made mine then followed the rest. Amazing! I served it in a bread bowl with cucumber, celery, carrots, and bread bits on the side!

When the whites of my deviled egg recipe were not fit for company I tried this recipe. Instead of crackers or bread, I piped the egg onto cucumber slices  Garnished them with bacon and chives. Some of them I garnished with salmon fish eggs and also chives. I used scant 3/4 cup of mayo instead of the full cup in the recipe. I wanted the egg mixture to hold its shape. This recipe turned out amazing and my guests love it.

I plan to revise and start with a cream cheese /half and half base.  soften cheese in microwave heating it through.  Add finely chopped spinach and egg mixture  (a tad garlic and onion pwder).   No chunks of egg white reserved.   Dump in a hollowed out bread bowl and bake covered with foil.   Yuuummy warm comfort dip...serve with bread bowl chunks.
I also think crunchy onions would be delicious texture, especially if I skip the bread and bake in casserole.

This turned out pretty well ! At a large family party everyone was asking about it and it went pretty quickly. However, next time I would use less mayo as it was a little too soupy and I would add more hot sauce for some extra kick. But, otherwise very good and I'll make it again!

I've made this recipe three times now, and it is just so good! As written, it's a bit too mayonnaise-y for our taste, so I reduce the mayo to 2/3 cup, and I blend 7 eggs and leave 5 chopped. I follow the recipe otherwise. Simple and so tasty!
