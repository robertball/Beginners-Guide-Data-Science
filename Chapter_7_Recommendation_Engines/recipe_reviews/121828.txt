I have my own bread pudding recipe but I use this custard recipe. It's great!! I think bread pudding is not complete w/o custard and this is the PERFECT custard to fit any bread pudding. Thanks for sharing.

Very good bread pudding! I loved the texture of it. I used 3 big potato rolls (sliced in half & torn into 1/2" pieces) instead of bread slices, omitted the raisins & the sauce, (I used a sherry sauce recipe given to me by a friend on my cooking forum....Cooking Friends)& baked it in an 8" by 8" pyrex dish. Hubby loved the sauce & proclaimed it the best bread pudding he'd ever had. Thansk for a wonderful recipe!

I found this to be an excellent recipe just as it is.  Simple and good.  I was lazy, however, and used canned lemon pie filling instead of the sauce and it worked great.

my husband has always said he did not like bread pudding.  I made this (without the raisins) and he loved it.  I found out that his mother had baked a much drier version and he had stayed away from it until now.  My friend (who is 79 years old) and I (who love bread pudding) are ecstatic with this recipe.  When I tell her I am making it, she is here with spoon and bowl in hand.

One of the best homemade bread puddings I have made yet!  I added a little more cinnamon and when I made the sauce I sauted up an apple then added 1 cup of milk instead of the water.  Turned out delicious.  More fattening i'm sure, but oh well.  Great recipe!

This recipe was perfect for what I wanted. I was looking for a simple, tasty bread pudding like the one my mom used to make. This was easy, I had all the ingredients on hand, and it only took about 5 minutes of prep work. The recipe was not overly custardy, but I don't like my bread pudding too custardy anyway. The taste was good old-fashioned. I used skim milk and brown sugar and I baked it in a 9x9 baking dish (I think the 11" dish called for in the recipe would make the bread pudding a little too thin). I didn't make the sauce, just served it with a dollop of whipped cream. It was not out-of-this world fabulous, but it was comfy and delicious like something straight out of mom's kitchen.

My husband is always asking me for bread pudding. I found this recipe and gave it a try and he loved it. I wasn't to crazy for the custard part but he ate it for a couple of nights and said it was still delicious.

This was a very simple and good bread pudding. I made the sauce and everyone liked it but it was VERY rich so next time i think i will only put about a tsp. or so on each serving. Over all very good!

This review is for the sauce only - I have a recipe for white chocolate bread pudding and needed a good vanilla sauce. I made the one in this recipe and substituted milk for the water, as another reviewer suggested and added 1/2 tsp immitation rum. It is absolutely delicious and couldn't be simpler to make!

I did not make the sauce as we like our bread pudding without the fancy sauces. I also didn't use any raisins for the same reason. The only other change I made was to use evaporated milk as I didn't want to use the last of the milk on hand. We really enjoyed it, Several years ago I had a great recipe that made an 8 x 8 pan that we loved and lost the recipe. We don't do alot of dessert but I will make this again.

This was really, really good.  I doubled the recipe and used an 11 x 17 baking dish.  Followed the recipe exactly other than I threw in an extra 2t of cinnamon.  The sauce was awesome.  I just threw everything in a saucepan, brought it to a boil for a minute or two and lightly drizzled over the top.  My family loved it.

Oh... My... Gosh!  This was SO good.  I had a package of Sara Lee dinner rolls that I needed to do something with (I ended up using 9 of the rolls).  The only change I made with the bread pudding itself was I used only 2/3 C. Sugar.  For the sauce, I used brown sugar (for more "caramely" taste) & I used milk instead of water.  It is so wonderful when warm!!

This is a quick and easy recipe to do when I'm pressed for time.  It turns out so well, I now have to make a double batch.  For a healthy twist, we add fresh berries to the custard.

My husband and I liked it very much. I didn't make the sauce, I figured it would be too rich. Next time I will leave the raisins out.

I have one change to this recipe...  Add about 3/4 to a cup of chocolate chips to the mixture before baking.  I like milk chocolate, but I am sure semi-sweet would be good too.
The sauce is a must, but I cut down the butter and sugar a little

The best and easiest bread pudding. I make it all the time and it is always a hit. Plus it is very affordable (cheap!) but tastes top of the line. It is great served cold or fresh and hot!

This was DELICIOUS bread pudding. Everyone LOVED it. The sauce was great; it really made the dish. I actually forgot to put the butter in with the bread...when I realized it I pulled it out of the oven and poured it on top. It turned out fine.  I will DEFINITELY make this many, many more times. THAN YOU for this amazing recipe!!!

I found the pudding a bit dry, but I may have cooked longer than I should have.  At Denver's high altitude that is easy to do.  I must say though that the sauce recipe is just great.  I made a German Marble Cake from a recipe on Allrecipes.com and only used 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup Frangelico.  Great on both the pudding and the cake.
