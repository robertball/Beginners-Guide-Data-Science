I thought this was a great base recipe. I did limit the amount of oil and sprinkled some coarse salt on top prior to heating. Sliced olives blended well for our taste with the cheese. Next time I'll try some tomatoes in oil, capers, and maybe a bit of ham for a really heavy buffet type of bread.

This bread was well liked at a party I had, however I would use more motza and less Romano...it tends to burn before the bread is done. I also cut up some green onion and mixed that in....was very yummy! Ooops! I almost forgot... I used a loaf of frech bread.

This was a great recipe!! We had it with Salads and wings one night for dinner and a movie! I changed a few things around though. I chopped up some roasted red peppers and mushrooms and put them on top of mozzarella cheese. Then I sprinkled a little bit of EVOO on top followed by some grated parmesean cheese and garlic salt. Enjoy! :)

I was surprised that this one did not get the rave reviews I had expected from my taste testers.  I think the idea is good but I may have executed it differently.  Its basically cheesy garlic bread and I would not serve it as an appetizer, but perhaps an accompaniment to a pasta or soup dish.

This was actually really good! Next time I will add in some mozzarella cheese too just for the gooey-ness factor. All in all, this had great flavor and we all enjoyed it! Thanks for sharing. :)
