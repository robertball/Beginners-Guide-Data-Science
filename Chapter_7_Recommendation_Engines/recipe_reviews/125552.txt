Excellent!  I made this tonight in my slow cooker with the pork chunks, red potatoes, onions, baby carrots, and apple (didn't have the squash).  It turned out super tender and SO tasty.

Delicious! I doubled it for big family gathering, put it in 5 qt. pan. Didn't have room to double potatoes and apples, but still great. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe! I added apple cider in addition to/instead of chicken broth and a few dashes soy sauce. I increased salt a bit, added garlic and onion powders in addition to the fresh garlic & onion. The sage and rosemary really complement this dish well! Make sure you use very fresh spices, as is the case with any recipe. I also used beef chuck roast since I didn't have pork handy and it was awesome. I look forward to trying it with pork. I also used fresh butternut squash, peeled with vegetable peeler and cubed, since that's all I had on hand. Yummers! Oh, and since I like the meat very tender, I simmered the meat with liquids/spices about an hour before adding veggies, then simmered another 1/2 hour. Adding the veggies long after the meat was an excellent idea and helped veggies retain their pretty color and shapes. I cut carrots on the bias for oval shapes instead of cubing, but either would be pretty.

This stew was delicious!  After sauteeing the onion and garlic w/ the pork, I threw in the carrots, potatoes and some mushrooms and sauteed it for a bit longer.  Then I poured in one cup of the chicken broth and scraped up all the brown bits before putting it all in the cooker w/ the rest of the broth and spices.  I skipped the butternut squash, only because I didn't have any.  Would love to try it next time though.  At the end I mixed 2 tbsps of flour and a bit of cold water and stirred that in at the end.  It made a savory gravy!  Mmm, I'm going back for more....

My entire family, iincluding my in-laws loved this. I made due with what I had. I pre-heated the pork as suggested, added the broth, onion, rosemary, sage, 2 cubed apples, baby carrots, red pepper, garlic, mushroom and green peppers. Threw it all in the slow cooker and left it for 4 hours. I ended up having to added a little flour and a can of mushroom soup at the end to thicken it a little but it was delicious.

What a wonderful recipe.  I did, however, make some changes.  I used parsnips and turnips instead of butternut squash and potatoes.  And it gave it a lot more flavor.  I also thickened it at the end with flour/milk.  A wonderful blend of flavors.

I used fresh squash and left out the carrots because I didn't have any.Used a combination of  Braeburn and Granny Smith apples and left the peels on my potatos cause I like em that way! got mixed reviews from the kids, most gave it a 3.5, none HATED it. I thought it got better and better the more I ate. I am thinking it will be even better tomorrow. Thanks for the great recipe.

I didn't have any sage or rosemary, so I just seasoned mine with salt and pepper.  I added a little apple cider to the pot, and some chopped celery.  I really wanted to try one of the 'dinner in a pumpkin' recipes from this site, but I thought the flavors of this stew would go better with the pumpkin than any of the ones in those recipes.  I made the stew the night before and simmered it on low for about 1 hour.  The next day I used this stew to bake in my pumpkin, and it turned out delicious.  I left out the squash and scraped the pumpkin meat into the stew when serving.

My family really enjoyed this stew. The flavor of the butternut and the spices was amazing. And its a recipe you can add to or subtract from and make your own! We loved it!! Thanks!

I tried it with chicken breast instead of pork and it turned out well.  I put everything in the slow cooker without any precooking.  I also used fresh squash instead of frozen.  I liked it but next time I'll try pork for more flavor.
Made it a second time with pork and it was ok.  I used fresh butternut squash and added some corn but I still think it needs more flavor.

Yum! I will make this again, and that's saying a lot for me! I used fresh butternut squash and fresh rosemary and I left out the carrots (personal preference). I don't know if I tasted any sweetness from the apple like other people mentioned (I forgot to pay attention, I was too hungry!), but anyways it was good. I made a half recipe and it worked out great.

Always try recipe exactly as printed first before any adjustments. First time to post review.  This stew was just "so so"  A little bland.  next time will peel the apples, recipe did not say to do so, and skin was objectionable.  Also will cook potatoes and carrots a while and add squash and apples only for about 10 min,  Squash and apples were  mushy. Good flavor, but needed salt.

I was leary when I started, but this dish is AWESOME!! As per other reviewers I cooked the pork for 45 minutes for added tenderness  Hint:  If using fresh butternut squash, wrap it in plastic wrap, jab it with a large meat fork, then nuke it on high for about 5-7 minutes. Let cool a little then cut up.  It is much easier to deal with.  I also added a few frozen peas at the end just for a little bit more color.

Absolutely delicious!  The apples really round out the flavor of the stew.  Don't leave them out.  I doubled the spices and added a little flour to thicken it.  The perfect thing for a cold winter day.

This was really good!  I made it in the slow cooker and used chicken instead of pork (I hate pork, but liked the sound of this recipe).  I also used fresh herbs because, completely unintentionally, I had fresh rosemary and fresh sage on hand.  I served it with sour dough rolls warmed in the oven.  This was very good and tasted very light.  Don’t skimp on the apple.  It adds a hint of sweetness.  Thanks for sharing!  I really enjoyed this!

This was a hit at our house.  My husband follows a paleo lifestyle and we strive to feed our children that way too.  This got "5 stars" from him and we'll definately be making it again.  I like some of the others suggestions of using parsnip and mushroom, too.  The recipe is great on it's own, but I think I'll include them next time.

I'm giving this 5 stars because I think it has the basis for a really good recipe, but it is ripe for variations.  I used boneless country-style spareribs, cubed, so of course it needed to cook a bit longer.  I used Hubbard squash because it was on sale..couldn't find any squash in the freezer section.  Two cups of red potatoes rather than russet. Had to giggle at the review that said they didn't care for the stew because they didn't like rosemary.  1/4 ts rosemary?  Really.  I used about 2 ts fresh rosemary and one ts fresh sage; more salt and lots of fresh ground black pepper.  It's what my family calls "homely" food.  Not a great looker, but mighty tasty.  I think it will be better tomorrow.

Excellent and easy soup.  I substituted parsnips for the potatoes.  I was going to use turnips too as another reviewer suggested, but there were no good ones at the store.  This is great comfort food and good leftover.  This recipe made a lot!  So we kept enjoying for a few days.

Very tasty dish.  I made a few changes that help a lot.  First, put the potatoes in when you add the broth instead of in the last step.  They need as much time as possible.  Second, I browned the meat separately then took it out of the pan and cooked the onions, adding the garlic for the last minute or so before adding them all to the broth.  This way, the meat and the garlic don't overcook.  I also threw in a little pureed chipotle to give it a little zest.  I roasted my own butternut squash to add a depth of flavor from the carmelization.  All in all an excellent melding of tastes.

Pork is not my specialty!! But this recipe sounded great... AND IT WAS! I did tweak it a bit using fresh rosemary sprig instead of dried, 1 yam & 1 red potato and pumpkin instead of butternut squash cause that's what I had. I also added two cups apple cider, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 2 Tbsp of Dark brown sugar. My hunny loved it and said it was to go in the "Favorites" list! THANKS

I thought at first I did not know what I was getting myself into.  But as I put it together it was beautiful. There were nine family members that I had to feed.  But let me tell you that pot was empty, seconds & thirds.  It is a great dish.  I just added extra than the ingredients asked for.  GOOD!!!

This was good, but you definitely need to put the apples in only for the last 5 minutes, otherwise they are mush.  I tried a little after it was done and I could taste the apples.  However, when I served it the next day, the apples just took on the taste of the stew.  It was good both times, but I liked the apple flavor of the first day better.

The amount of prep involved isn't worth it. It lacks something and is very mushy. Even with doubled spices---it just tastes like chicken broth and sage. It's not bad per se. But not worth the time involved with all the chopping.

This recipe turned out so good. Ways I changed it: I used chicken instead of pork. I cooked the chicken, garlic and onions for an hour (instead of 20 minutes) to make sure it was nice and tender. I added about 3x the amount of sage and rosemary. I also added garlic powder. Instead of 2 potatoes, I used one potato and 1 yam. I also added 2 stalks of celery. I used fresh butternut squash, instead of frozen. Added the squash and apples in just the last 5 min. so they were just tender. We loved it!!

I really love this. It even improves with freezing. Instead of squash you can use swede. Absolute topper.

I was looking for a simple pork stew recipe with lots of vegetables and was very happy to find this one.  It was very tasty and the apples really did complement it well.  I left out the squash and sage as I didn't have any, and used golden delicious apples instead of MacIntosh (again, because they were what I had on hand).  I also used cornstarch and water, as others mentioned, to thicken it up a bit.  My husband and I both loved it, although I thought it could have maybe used a wee bit more seasoning.  I think I will definitely try it with the squash next time, and possibly some other vegetables and spices (maybe some fresh parsley and thyme and some sea salt and fresh ground black pepper).  It is a keeper though.

A potentially good stew ruined by the inclusion of apple, in my opinion.  Strange combination of tastes.

I used one apple and it was amazing!  I followed the recipe as written but added sweet potatoes and parsnips (because I wanted to use some leftover ones in the fridge).  I also added a little flour mixed with water at the end to thicken the sauce.  Seriously, this recipe is perfect and my guests raved about it!

Loved this recipe as is but added some apple cider as some suggested.  I think that the recipe could use extra chicken stock as it seemed very full with pork and veg and not enough liquid.  Perhaps thickening may make it more stew like also.  I will add kale or other hearty greens next time.  I think that would add some color and extra nutrition punch.   Overall, a great stew.  It was cold and rainy here in Syracuse today.  This fit the bill with toasted garlic bread.  YUM!  Thanks for sharing CariCat.

The family loved this! I used the recipe as a guideline for making a stew out of leftover pork loin. I didn't have chicken broth or white potatoes, so I started by sauteeing garlic and onion, adding 3 cups of water and the herbs (used more of the herbs than called for in the recipe). Then I added the leftover pork, a small amount of leftover roasted squash, apples, sweet potatoes, carrots, and a dash of ginger. I squeezed a little lemon juice in it just before serving to lift the flavors a bit. Delicious, and even tastier the next day! I'll try it again, starting from scratch this time, as I was pleased with the combination of textures and flavors.

I made some changes only because I forgot the recipe and I was going off memory.  I cooked the onion with butter and shut off flame when onion was soft.  I then added a handful of flour.  The mixture was sticky.  I then boiled broth (same pan) and reduced heat to let vegetables & apple cook/simmer.  (I was using leftover pork so I skipped that part)  I also added celery for color and a few shakes of red pepper flakes for a bite.  I will make this again & think it's better than beef stew... in my opinion.  Thanks.

This was very good!  I used the slow cooker; however, I cooked it a bit too long - I would suggest 3 hours tops because my apples disinigrated.  My husband likes beef stew better.

I think sometimes it's the mood a person is in that determines whether you like a dish.....or not.  DH thought this was good but I did not like it at all.  The apples just didn't work with it for me.  I added some sour cream at the end of the cooking time and even THAT didn't save it for me.

I made this stew and it was awesome. I added 2 pinches of cinnamon and red pepper flakes to the recipe and it turned out great. I also used 1 yam and 1 regular potato and it worked perfectly.

I really loved the flavor of this, but the last 20 minutes was too long - my squash was a bit mushy and the apples were practically falling apart.  I think next time I will not cook it as long and add the apples last - they didn't need that long to cook.

We love this one. I've made it the last three autumns in the slow cooker and we freeze the leftovers, but it's gone by spring and we talk about it all summer. I do use fresh squash rather than frozen. Oh, and I replace the potatoes with sweet potatoes. Yum!

I followed this recipe as written, including the potatoes and carrots, and found it to be a wonderful addition to my recipe book.  We loved the flavor that the apples added.  The only thing that I will change for next time is that I will use unpeeled redskin potatoes (instead of peeled Idaho whites) and add some fresh ground pepper. I served with some fresh, hot dinner rolls.  The broth was an excellent "dipper". Definately a keeper!

I loved this! Savory and sweet. I didn't have the squash- but it was still very tasty. Substituted red onion for a little more punch, then 1c apple cider 2c chicken broth to really bring out that spicy and sweet flavor. Came out a little thin, so I added a corn starch slurry. Definitely will serve up to company before the winter is over!

Really just average.  I added 1/2 tsp of pepper, worcestshire sauce & more salt.  That seemed to compensate for the lacking flavor.  I also stirred in some milk and a couple tablespoons of flour at the end like others suggested to thicken it up.  Those things brought the recipe up to a 4 star but as it is written it is definitely only a 3.

I was not sure about this but tried it and loved it. I don't really like apples in anything other than pie. My husband did not even know there were apples in it. It just gave it such a good taste. Will make again :)

Great!

Followed the recipe up to adding sage and potaotes.
Used a bag of frozen butternut squash w/sage ravioli.
Did not have apples but did use the carrots.

Delicious!

Great recipe!  I added bacon/pork belly and doubled the herbs/spices.  I started by cooking up some diced bacon (about 12 ounces).  I then removed the bacon, drained off most of the grease to use in cooking the pork.  I lightly seasoned the pork with some Applewood seasoning.  The combination of bacon and the applewood seasoning added a great amount of flavor.  At the end I added a little flour to thicken up the sauce.  It was a little salty, so I recommend cutting out the added salt since there is plenty of salt in chicken stock, bacon and the applewood seasoning I used.

I liked this recipe but it needed more broth.  I used another full cup and it worked out great.  But after it cooled there was no broth left.  So I would add 2 extra cups of broth if you like it more stew like.

The great reviews here led to me making the stew. I followed the recipe and it turned out kind of bland compared to other pork stews that I have made. So I added some allspice and fresh ground nutmeg to this one which made it hold up better.

very good. i made it mostly as written; used fresh squash and fuji apples, 'cause that's what i had on hand. the 40 minute cooking time is way too short - a minimum of two hours would be more accurate. otherwise, it was good enough that my daughter who doesn't eat pork, and her boyfriend, who doesn't eat fruit and meat together, both polished off their bowlfuls. this made 8 servings, which comes out to 7 pts on ww, for anyone who is interested.

I followed the recipe didn't use potatoes or carrots but had to add cornstarch to thicken as it was more like a soup when done. It was very yummy and the leftovers the next day were SUPERB!! Stew always tastes better the second day! - in my opinion.

Wonderful fall soup/stew. I do prefer using one apple, rather than two. Think it adds just the right touch of sweetness for me. Easy and quick to fix and smells heavenly as it's cooking. A new favorite!!

I followed the slow cooker recipe and it was bland. I tried to doctor it up a bit......juice was good after adding lots more spices, my pork was good (I used center cut chops bc that is what I had) The veggies were soft and mushy. I took the meat out and froze the juice to add to soups. Won't make this again.

Very good, followed recipe for crock pot version.  Next time going to add a little extra brown sugar or some apple juice to replace some of the broth to emphasize a little more of the sweetness... the apples didn't make as much difference in sweetness as I was hoping for.  Still, nice change from the normal beef stew I make!

So, can I give this 10 stars? Great recipe! I followed the spice measurments exactly. Be sure to do that because the amounts were perfect! My husband loved this. I did add some rutabaga because it is awesome with pork. You can also add turnips and/or parsnips and it would be great. My husband loved this stew. Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

Love it, but I find that the apples, especially Macs, just go to mush.  I used dried (dehydrated) apple rings instead and they held together and looked really nice. (Always like ways to use up the apples from my backyard tree.)

Normally love pork and apple stuff, but I didn't like this. The flavors didn't work for me. Granted, I didn't use sage. But, I did add lots of salt and a little sour cream to my bowl, and that helped a little.

I have made this twice now and I love it.  It is very comforting and makes me feel happy!  I think I stayed pretty much to the recipe although I did use fresh squash.  I have made it stove top and in the slow-cooker and it came out delicious both ways.  Last time, the squash started turning brown (still tasted good) so I may try adding them just a bit later on next time.

Very nice taste.  I used green beans instead of squash since that's what I had.  It would have been better with the sweetness of squash.  I was concerned that there was not enough liquid, and it was definitely more veggies and meat than broth.  The broth was thin, but squash might have thickened it.  I also just used poultry seasoning instead of the individual spices.  My 4 year old LOVED it.  I will make again.  Great way to use leftover pork.

Great flavor and love all the ingredients but I wish this was more of a stew broth instead of a soup. Will try again and thicken the broth.

I used what I had and improvised for our food preferences.I only gave this four stars because I tweeked it so much. The spices are excellent.   Omitted apples and squash and just did potatoes and carrots. The rosemary and sage are what makes this stew! I substituted a little basil for lack of bay leaf and it was delicious.     I did think it needed about 1c more of liquid. I added 1.5 Tbsp of cornstarch to thicken it some.    Will make it again!

This is an unusual and tasty stew.  I haven't tasted anything quite like it. The recipe makes a lot of stew - consider halving.  The timing of cooking the ingredients is off in the recipe.  The challenge is to cook the ingredients so that they all become tender at the same time.  Another reviewer suggested a good order.  I tried my own but my timing was off since the butternut squash turned to mush.  Maybe that was the intent of the recipe, because ut added creaminess, but i think it would be better as a distinct ingredient.  Timing may be crucial to the perfect execution of this recipe.

This was fantastic, i loved the unique flavor of this stew. The only change i made was using summer squash instead of butternut squash. My husband can't stand butternut squash - i would have liked to try it according to the recipe but he woudln't try it that way. I loved the seasoning and the apple taste in this. Thank you so much!

This was so good and so good for you!  I used yams instead of the squash.  I also added a little bit of apple cider. Everyone loved it.  I can't wait to try the leftovers tomorrow.

Awsome stew!  My family loved it. I did substitute 2 sweet potatoes for the squash.  I also more than doubled the rosemary and sage.  Used dry white wine to simmer the meat, garlic, and onion before adding the chicken broth. My son declared this his favorite soup that he could eat every day. :-)

I made this last night and it was GREAT!  The flavors were so complementary of eachother.  I used fresh butternut squash, the potatoes, and carrots for more substance.  But because I added the extra veggies, I used 4 cups of chicken broth, otherwise there wouldn't have been enough liquid. I simmered the pork chunks in the flavored broth for about 45 minutes and by the time the soup was done, the meat was so tender!  The apples do add a nice unexpected flavor to the soup!  I highly recommend making this delicious soup.  My meat-and-potatoes husband said that he'd like this one again...and that says alot!

Nice stew! I didn't have any butternut squash so I used about 5 potatos instead.  I did make this in my slow cooker and cooked on low for about 3 hours and on high for 2 hours.  I doubled the spices and also added a lot of pepper.  I think next time I'd add salt and pepper to the pork while I'm browning it.  Can't wait to try it again when I have the squash.  Make sure you do use a nice tart apple.  I only had Fuji on hand and could hardly taste them.

This was very good, better than we expected.  We didn't end up using quite as much butternut squash or potato as it called for, it seemed like there was enough in the pot so we stopped chopping.  We also used fresh rosemary from our garden instead of dried.  We all felt that it needed extra salt and pepper but otherwise it was delicious and hearty and perfect for a cold fall day.

My wife does not care for cooked carrots or squash so I added extra potato and mushrooms. It was not as attractive as it would have been with the more colorful ingredients, but it was delicious.

Very good stew.  I am making it for the second time tonight.  I always add some corn to the mixture and instead of apple, I add about 1/4 cup of good quality apricot preserves.  Yummy!

This stew was pretty good!  I made a couple of changes.  I used a copy cat recipe of Prudhommes Poultry Magic on the meat when I browned it and then salt & pepper to taste later.  I also 
used sweet potato instead of white. I hate Macintosh apples so i used Galas that I had in the fridge.  I cooked it a little longer than 20 mins after adding the potatoes, squash & carrots. I'll be eating the leftovers today and think it will taste even better!  Thanks for a stew that's a change from the usual.

This is a good basic stew recipe.  My husband & I gave it 4 stars, but my son only 3.  I added some white wine because I always put wine in stew, and increased the seasonings.  The pork came out very tender (I used tenderloin cut into chunks).  In addition to the veggies in the recipe, I added some  parsnip and turnip because I had them on hand.  I also added some flour at the end like other reviewers suggested.

Really interesting combination of ingredients, but I have to agree with previous reviews, that it would need some more spices. And it took me quite long to cut all the vegetables and the pumpkin. Anyway it tasted interesting but as a tip to the others: Add more spices and maybe get someone to help you with the preparations! :)

Great soup. I dredged the pork in some flour before browning. For us, one apple (fuji) was enough sweetness, though I did include a japanese yam instead of potatoes, carrots, and fresh butternut squash. All those could have contributed to sweetness. I did add kale near the end which I love for the addition of color, nutrition & texture. I left it in the slow cooker on high accidentally for 4-5 hours and it still came out fine. (phew!) I might up the amount of stock next time to have a little more soup to stuff ratio.

Ate with quinoa on the side.

I loved this recipe!  I was expecting a decent flavor and just picked this as something to do with some of the massive butternut squash I had purchased.  The sauce was so flavorful (even though I forgot the garlic, which I'll probably leave out in the future too).  I'll definitely be making this again!

I'm so sorry; but, I hated this.  To be fair, I Rosemary is not my favorite herb and I have only ever had butternut squash mashed with butter and sugar.  I made this exactly as written in the crock pot.  I think if I omitted the rosemary and squash and added a bit of something else and thickened the broth to compensate for the missing...oh never-mind.  That's too much work to re-write a recipe.  This just did not make the cut for us.

Just finished my first bowl and i love the clean flavors of the vegetable which allow the pork to shine thru.
I doubled everything but the pork.

Pretty good.  Made as written, except I cooked the pork for 45 minutes before adding the vegetables to make it more tender.

Made it to the T.  Had fresh squash, so I baked it first then added to pot.  It needed a lot more seasonings!! I just added to taste.  Family really liked it.  A nice change from beef stew.

I added sweet potatoes (along with some regular) and it came out great - everyone loved it.

Wonderful flavor and versitility. Great recipe for inexpensive cuts of pork and as long as they are cut into small pieces.  Cooks up fast and very tender.  Don't leave out the apple at the very end and I added whatever was in the refrigerator.  Great way to get the family to eat sweet potatoes, butternut squash and, yes, brussel sprouts.  Since I like a thicker stew, added Wondra at the end and seasoned with Kitchen Bouquet for a rich, brown color.

I followed the recipe exactly.  Was fabulous!  I wasn't sure if everyone would like b/c everyone doesn't love squash, but everyone devoured it!

Great recipe! I did not put in potato or carrots. I did use half apple juice/chicken broth..I replaced that with hominy. (What I had on hand) followed the recipe otherwise and thickened at the end. Yum!

I had wondered about the apple chunks in this, but made it as posted, and I should have realized that the apples would cook right down to basically liquid, just as if you were making apple sauce.  Although I was almost hovering over the slow cooker, thinking, "There's no way this is enough liquid", it ended up certainly being enough liquid, and this was a big hit at home.  Great pork stew, although I used fresh squash and swore never to do that again, given that I had never had the unfortunate experience of trying to cut and peel one before.  Great, great, stick to your ribs, perfect for a stormy day at home stew!  :o)

Excellent Stew. I took the advice or a previous reviewer and let the pork cook in the just the liquid portion of the recipe for a little over an hour. This made the pork melt in your mouth tender. I added an extra half cup of water to compensate for the extra cooking. I chopped fresh sage leaves and added a generous portions at least 10 leaves. The taste of the fresh sage and the apples was outstanding. I cooked all the vegetables for 20 min as the recipe calls for. I did however use fresh butternut squash andadded the squash about 15 min before the recipe was done instead of 20 min. I also added a little bit of cornstarch dissolved in cold water to thicken it especially since I added extra water. Instead of putting potatoes in the stew I served it with a side of roasted garlic mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes complimented the stew as it gave you something to eat the gravy with. I will definitely make this again.

Yum!  I followed this nearly exactly - I only added heavier spices (fresh rosemary from the garden, more garlic and sage, 3 bay leaves).  I trimmed the fat from the pork before cooking, used fresh butternut squash, used gala apples that I peeled first and extra carrots and potatoes.  Everyone loved it!  The apples cook down so much, you never feel as if you are biting into an apple - it just adds a flavor that is perfect.  I cooked this in the crock pot.  Next time I'll add the squash later so it stays a bit firmer.  A Keeper!!

WOW This was awesome. My husband says this is the new favorite stew recipe! I had trouble finding the right apple, so I used Fuji. I did find that I need to add the squash & the apples very late, or they got mushy, but still was good.

Not a bad stew, it is comfort food but lacks alot of flavor & I just hate to add a ton of salt to gain that flavor back. I did add the potatoes which I suggest omitting as they just add extra starch.  Do add the carrots - they add color & flavor and you could even add a little chopped parsley for color. I wouldn't make again, sorry.

I made this last night and thought it came out great. I skipped the apples,  added sliced baby bella mushrooms and I used fresh butternut squash instead of frozen.  I also sprinkled the pork with salt, pepper and flour before cooking. Served over rice. Definitely a keeper!!

This was really good; I've never had pork in a stew before.  I used fresh butternut squash, which was good, but I used a different kind of apple which almost disintegrated during cooking.  Next time I will use a different kind.

I was surprised by how much I liked this, because it's a bit outside my comfort zone.  That having been said, it was a little bland.  (And I'm usually heavy-handed with my spices, so it probably would've been even blander had I been precise with my spice measuring.)  Otherwise, very good!

Not bad but won't make again. I doubled the spices and still kind of bland. I peeled the apples which I was glad of. Just not spectacular - a chickeny version of a hearty beef stew.  Pork was tender though. I made it simmering long and slow on stove top in dutch oven. Will stick to my beef stew for more taste.

I made this a couple of days ago but didn't get to have for dinner until last night. It was a really tasty, healthy dinner. My family & I really enjoyed it. I increased the recipe a little since I had a larger cut of meat & used a whole box of chicken broth,etc. When I reheated, I tasted & decided to add about a t. of brown sugar & also grated in a small amt. of nutmeg & sprinkled a little cinnamon. I would definitely make this again. It was good as the recipe was written, but just added my own touches at the end. I also think, as with any soup, it helped the flavors to blend by having it the second day (although this was due to an unexpected circumstance). I loved having something that was this good & also so full of healthy vegetables, fiber & lean meat!

Great recipe!  I didn't have the squash but I added everything else.  I was a little nervous about the apples and how the kids would like it but they didn't seem to mind!  I added a little thickening agent to it in the end too make it a little thicker and it was lovely!  I'll definatley make it again!

This is a delicious healthy one pot meal.  It's comforting and is a huge variation from the usual pork dishes I make.  I used low-sodium chicken broth so I would imagine it would be even better with regular broth.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This had good flavor! I used fresh cubed squash, leeks instead of onion. It seemed like it was missing something, though. Maybe I will add a chopped bitter green next time.

I made this recipe in the crockpot and was rather disappointed in it. The flavor was bland and it just didn't seem like a cohesive dish. Reheated some the next day in the skillet and added additional seasonings to spice it up a bit, served it over couscous and it was much better. I doubt I would make it again though.

We really wanted to like this, but unfortunately, this one just didn't make it in our house.  I used the slow cooker method, and included the optional carrots and potatoes.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  Despite having lots of good ingredients, the result was disappointing.  I'm not sure why, and I'm not sure how it could have been improved.  I know I'm in the minority here, but for us, this one isn't a keeper.

This is my 4th time making this and it has become a family favorite! I do use frozen squash as it was easier to find the first time I made it and have found it much easier to use. The first time I made this, I was looking for recipes to use a smoked pork roast I had smoked the day before. I cubed it, and it was spectacular in this stew! The 2nd time I made it I used fresh pork and we all liked it best with the smoked pork roast! So, last night while smoking baby back ribs for dinner, I went ahead and smoked another pork roast and am heading into the kitchen to prepare this wonderful recipe again! THANK YOU!!

Had little to no flavor. I was very disappointed. Then I added a lot more spices, some mushrooms, celery and spinach, and it was edible the next day. I was so disappointed.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was delicious!  I pretty much followed the recipe. I just added a little extra potato and squash because I like it. A couple reviews said it was a tad bland, so in addition to the spices it called for, I threw in a couple pinches of Allspice as well.   It was the perfect comfort soup for cold dreary weather with just a hint of sweetness. If I could give it more stars, I would!  ??

Big hit with the family! It was like having a breath of Autumn in the middle of a hot, humid Florida August! I made this in a crockpot, because I love slow cooking, and smelling this cook all day in the house was amazing! I made a few changes, mostly because of what I had on-hand, and my family's preferences. I used 2 Yukon Gold potatoes, I cup carrots, 1 cup parsnips (my husband loves them), I small sweet onion, garlic,  I was lucky to have frozen butternut squash in the freezer, and I had 2 Ambrosia apples. I upped the spices considerably. I probably doubled or even tripled the sage and the rosemary. I also added white pepper. I used all 3 cups of chicken broth. I started the recipe off by dusting the pork with salt, pepper, and flour, and browning the meat in a little olive oil. After removing the meat, I threw in the onion and fresh garlic and cooked until translucent. I added some of the chicken broth and deglazed the pan, throwing it all into the crockpot over the meat. I then added the rest of the broth, and all the veggies except the squash and the apples. I cooked on high for an hour, then turned down to low. After about 4 hours, I added the butternut squash (I didn't want it to get too disintegrated, my crockpot cooks pretty hot).  About an hour before it was done, I put in the 2 peeled and sliced apples, and 1/2 cup apple cider.  I didn't find that I needed to add any flour or cornstarch, probably because I browned the meat in flour first. This dish smelled amazing

Delicious! I made it in a crockpot over the course of the day. I wish I had added another apple or even two, but everyone in the house loved this. I'll definitely be making it again this winter.

I cooked the pork in my pressure cooker and then added the vegetables and turned it to low. Next time I will watch the cooking time as my pork shredded so much, there were barely any chunks of meat, the flavor was better the next day.

This recipe is very adaptable.  I had leftover rotisserie chicken and used that instead of the pork.  I also added cauliflower and beet greens that I had on hand.  The rest I did as written, and it was wonderful.  Even my husband liked it, and he's not big on squash or fruit cooked in main meals.  I will definitely make this again!

Good flavour. The meat was great after simmering it for 20 min, however the potatoes do NOT take 20 min to cook and I only cut them very small. I turned the heat up a little and of course, the meat toughened... frustrating.

I made according to the directions except for 3 things.  I doubled the amount of rosemary & sage.  I used cubed rutabaga instead of potato, and, instead of 3 c. of chocken broth, I used 2 c. chicken broth and 1 1/2 c. of riesling wine.  I'm quite pleased with the result and can't wait to share it with my family.

This was exceptional, used fresh squash as I could not find cubed frozen. Think the key is good spices, I use penzys. This had great texture and wonderful flavor and was quick and easy. My boyfriend and brother both picky chowed it down. for sure a keeper.

We loved this recipe!  It's now in my personal favorites.  In all fairness, I added the kitchen sink (leftovers that would compliment this dish)  The butternut squash adds so much to this soup, love it, love it!

So good! Especially in the fall/winter. I used all veggies listed. It was very hearty and flavorful. I didn't have any rosemary, but used fresh and dried sage, and added garlic powder, s&p. Everyone like it!

Great recipe! I was searching for a pork stew recipe and found this one. I just happened to have a butternut squash too. I made the recipe pretty much as written, adding salt and pepper to the meat when browning it, added herb de provence instead of rosemary (it is in it). I steamed the potatoes and squash and served them with it. I used Pink Lady apples and put them in 10 minutes before it was done. I added the carrots with the onion and garlic plus added chopped turnip, celery root and parsnip (had a stew mix of veggies at home already). Considered thickening the broth but we decided not to and I am glad it was so lovely. My husband wasn't sure he would like it, but he was pleasantly surprised he said and ate a huge bowl and took a huge box of it to work the next day. Thanks for the lovely recipe.

I wasn't wowed by this recipe.  It was fair, certainly edible, but I wouldn't go out of my way to make it again.  That said, given the number of people who seemed to love this recipe I'd suggest making it.  Maybe you will be one of the ones who absolutely loves it.

This is a very tasty stew. I followed recipe, but next time I will change the cooking order. I will boil potatoes and carrots for a few minutes and then add the squash. While those are simmering, I will cook pork and add the pork and apples at the end. The apples disintegrated when I cooked them as the recipe is written and the potatoes and carrots were not completely done. Great recipe!

This stew was very tasty, and we really enjoyed it. I used yellow squash, and Braeburn apples. I don't know how it tastes with Butternut squash and McKintosh apples, but you can't get much better than this. Thanks for a really good recipe!

Loved this recipe!  I did add the carrots and one large potato, so I used and extra cup of broth.  I would like to try sweet potatoes and parsnips in it as others did - those would taste great too.  Thanks for a great recipe.

this was very good.  i didn't use the sage (didn't have any) and i used sweet potatoes instead of the squash.  i am sure i used more than 1/4 tsp. of the rosemary.  i put it into my loose tea holder.  i used a granny smith apple, as other said the macintosh was too sweet.  i think as a personal preference, the granny smith worked great.  i also put in some parsnips.  family wasn't overwhelmed with this, but i liked it.  so majority rules i suppose.  to bad, it was very good.  def. worth the try for the rest of you!

Ouch-what a fiasco! I used 2 fresh yams and used the crockpot (low 3 hours) and it turned into mush with carrot and pork lumps. I think it was too much liquid for the crockpot version.I hadn't peeled the yams so I fished out the peels and finished smashing with a wooden spoon. In order to pretend I was making stoup (stew soup) I added in 1T pico pica, 1 tsp cumin, 1/4 C chardonnay, 2 oz. pimentos and 4 oz green chile. I now have a pretty orange thick pork soup.

Stir fry vegetables until almost crispy prior to adding chicken broth.  Add three T. flour for a heartier stew.

I really enjoyed this stew, and I don't usually enjoy stew very much.

We loved this recipe.  The only change I made was to add 2 tbs of honey at the end for a slightly sweeter finish.  It was great and so easy!

This was absolutely delicious!  The apples provided just a tinge of sweetness.  My hubby absolutely loved this!  I used leftover pork roast, so I did not add that to the skillet since it didn't need to be cooked anymore.  After simmering, the pork totally fell apart and absorbed all the broth.  I've added another 3 cups of broth.  That was my fault.  I'll follow the recipe starting with raw pork next time.

I would give it a 5 star rating however I didn't have apples or squash so I substituted pitted prunes.  It made a nice brown rich gravy.  Will make it again with the apples and squash next time.

My husband told me it was the best bowl of soup he's ever had!  I personally don't like the texture of the apples but they really add something to the flavor so I wouldn't omit them, but maybe cut them smaller next time.

I used leftover pork tenderloin, cooked my onion in the same stockpot I planned on cooking the stew in (who wants to wash an extra pot?), & used sweet potatoes instead of butternut squash. I did add some frozen carrot slices & it needed a healthy sprinkle of salt & pepper. On the first bite, I thought this was really good but I grew tired of it quickly. Hubby liked every last bite so maybe it was just me (why I gave it the four stars). Thansk for the recipe, CariCat!

I used this recipe to use up some leftover pork loin. I just added the pork when I added the potatoes and apples. It turned out excellent! (The pork was better in the stew than when I originally cooked it.) Thanks for the great recipe!
