This recipe was amazing. My family loved it.  I am telling people that it was an old family recipe. It was great.  We used Cointreau for the orange liqueur, and the end result was addictive and amazing!

Yummy! Instead of honey, I used agave syrup - about half what the recipe called for. This is a keeper.
