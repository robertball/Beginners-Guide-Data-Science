Excellent taste.  Not too oily, which most pasta salads are. Left out the broccoli and onions-subbed sour cream for the mayo instead (due to texture issues).  You won't regret making this salad, and I don't even like black eyed peas that much. Oh also good with fresh sliced avocado as well.

Awesome !!! I thought of leaving the black eyed peas out at first, I did not & they gave it a unique & hearty taste. I highly recommend this, It's my famous pasta salad for family get togethers.

Very good way to use up left over king crab leg meat. Definitely let it sit in the refrigerator for awhile before serving. I suggest making it earlier in the day if you are serving it for dinner. The flavor is very simple. I served it on top of lettuce that was tossed with balsamic vinaigrette. If you eat it plain, you may want to season it up. I sprinkled “Emeril’s Original essence” on top of it when I ate it the next day.

Great salad!  I have never thought of putting black-eyed peas in a pasta salad before.  Next time I think I will try chicken in it.  Thanks for the new wonderful recipe.

Excellent as written!  We really enjoyed this salad.  I made it this morning for tomorrow evenings side, but wound up eating quite a bit for dinner tonight.  Just the salad, that was it.  Very filling.  Very good taste.  This is a total keeper and will be made over and over again!  Thank you for the post.

My new favorite pasta salad recipe!  I added black olives and just a little more dressing mixture.  You could do so much with this as your base.

Made this for a Memorial Day cookout and it went over very well.  Followed the recipe exactly and all enjoyed.  Very colorful dish and it complemented a picnic/cookout type gathering quite well.

I just realized I did not write a review for this salad.  Its a perfect summer salad or something to do with left over black eye peas in winter.  I plan on using this with my leftovers after New Years Day Meal.

The colors were pretty (I used yellow bell pepper instead of green) but it came out bland.  I had to dump a lot of salt on it to enjoy.
Maybe some fresh chopped herbs would zest it up.

Great salad.  I have made this many times and the only change I make is with the proportions.  I add less pasta and more broccoli.  I add the crab last and fold it in gently to avoid pulverizing it.

I made this one per recipe except for using imitation crab.  I really liked this one and it was well liked by others too.  My wife does not like a pasta salad that is too saucy, she thought this one was about right.
