Hi all...I'm the submitter of this recipe.  This recipe works best with CUT okra.  It is a little gooey/wet after microwaving and though you drain it on paper towels, it is still a little damp which helps the cornmeal/panko mixture stick.  I hope this helps.  Happy Eatting!

Being a southern gal, I'm a big fan of okra.  I thought this recipe was really good.  My only complaint was that it was a bit dry.  I didn't have the panko bread crumbs so I used plain, I'm not sure if that would make a difference or not.  I'm definitely going to try this again tweaking the oven and such.  It's definitely worth keeping a playing around with.

Pretty good. I used chopped okra. I melted a little bit of butter on the okra after it microwaved (I don't use cooking spray), and I had no problem with the crumbs sticking. The crumbs could use more seasoning. Thanks for sharing!

I really do like okra, but I had such a problem with the panko crumbs sticking to these with just the non-stick spray that they had me wanting to pull my hair out! I'm giving this a 2 star review because my okra hating husband said that I managed to get the slime out of them. I think if I were to attempt making these again, I would roll them in flour, then dip in an egg-wash and then roll in straight cornmeal. In my opinion, it was a waste of my panko crumbs. Thank you for submitting the recipe, I really did want to like it.

Such a tasty, healthy way to prepare okra. I also make this without the cornmeal and bread crumbs. Just a light coat of olive oil, salt and pepper is good. My family prefers this recipe, however. Thank you for sharing it with us.

We love this recipe and have it quite often.  I lightly coat the okra with olive oil before placing in the bag -- I like this better than the cooking spray.  Also use seasoning salt instead of garlic salt.  

I have also used this recipe with fresh okra, but you have to cook it in the microwave for about 5 minutes to get it gooey enough to work.

Great snack, and I felt guilt free eating the last few okra of the season from my grandma's garden.

This was an easy and healthy way for me to prepare the package of frozen cut okra that I'd bought on a whim. I used this recipe as a basic template. In a ziploc baggie, I mixed about 1 or 1.5 c almond meal, a heavy dosage of creole seasoning, dried onions, salt and pepper. I nuked the frozen okra, added it to the ziploc (without any butter spray or oils), then shook it all together. Poured it out onto a cookie sheet and baked at 375 for 20 minutes. It could have used the full 25 minutes but these were delicious AND gluten free! My husband dipped his in ranch. I will be buying another bag for those evenings that I need a quick, easy appetizer! Thank you for helping me put okra in my arsenal!

This just didn't work for me.  I usually like anything okra, but maybe I'm just too used to real fried okra to enjoy this.  As I was eating it, I wished I had just heated up the frozen okra and eaten it plane.  Wouldn't make this again.

This is a wonderful recipe if you love fried okra but need to be mindful of your health. It still has flavor and crunch! Thank you for submitting this recipe.

Very good! Even my kids liked it!! I used spray I Can't Believe It's Not Butter and not butter flavored cooking spray. Will definitely make again. Served as a side with Grilled Shrimp Scampi (search for it on this site!) and grilled asparagus. Thanks for the recipe!!

I used Stillwells frozen breaded okra.  I put olive oil on the pan and I cooked it at 400 degrees for 15 minutes and turned it over part way through.  It turned out good.

I can’t stand okra unless it’s breaded. It’s so slimy. So I found this recipe and I didn’t have to throw the okra away. It came out delicious!
I didn’t have any corn meal so I used ground oats instead. They came out perfect! I read one of the reviews and the reviewer commented that she had trouble with the cornmeal not sticking to the okra. With the ground oats- I had no problem with it coating the okra. I will definitely make this again.

I used fresh okra, spray on olive oil, added some cajun spice and some minced dried onions. It is tasty, next time I might flour and egg it before I toss it into the cornmeal and panko mix.  I like a heavier coating. I  baked it on parchment paper at 380' for 30 mins.  I love to read the reviews and adapt with what sounds good.

The concept was great, and it's possible that trying to cook it in a toaster oven (because it's too hot to use the regular oven) was my problem. But I resorted to pan frying the okra because it just wasn't cooking. I will not make this recipe again.

My husband and son really liked this version of "Fried Okra" - and my son is a very picky eater.  I adapted it as follows:

1) used fresh okra and cooked it in the microwave for 5 minutes before coating.

2) used a coating of 1/3 c. cornmeal, 1/8 c. flour and added 3/4 t seasoned salt, 3/4 t. garlic salt, 1/8 t. pepper and 1/8 t. paprika.  Next time I might add another 1/2 t. regular salt as well.

3)I sprayed the okra with Olive Oil before baking, but did so after I'd placed them on the baking sheet, not before I coated them with the cornmeal mixture.  4)  I baked them at 400 degrees for about 10 minutes, then flipped and baked another 10-15 minutes.   I used non-stick foil on a baking sheet to keep cleanup easy.

Tasted very similar to my mom's fried Okra but much healthier.

As a southern girl, I was a bit skeptical trying an "oven fried" version of one of my all-time favorite southern foods. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at how this recipe turned out. I subbed seasoning salt for the garlic salt and olive oil for the cooking spray, though.
