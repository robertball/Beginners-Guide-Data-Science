this recipe is great!  i used more salt and substituted margerine for shortening.  also, i did not use baking powder.  One time i made w/ baking powder, and all the other times without... i liked the taste and texture of the tortillas without the baking powder.  I rolled out the dough paper thin.. and then i placed a bowl on top and cut around the bowl... so all of my tortillas were the same perfect circles.  Tortillas came out soft and tasty! They look store-bought, but taste much better! I have made them many many times and everyone always loves them.

***FOR NON-CRUNCHY TORTILLAS, PLACE COOKED TORTILLAS IN A PLASTIC BAG. IT GETS MOISTURE BACK IN IT AND WILL MAKE THEM SOFT AND PLIABLE. ALSO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T OVER COOK THEM.*** I've made tortillas before and I would have to say that these turned out very good. I made Bacon 'n' Egg Wraps with the tortillas and my husband was amazed at the ease and speed of making such a wonderful breakfast. ***MODIFICATION*** I substituted the shortening with equal amounts of butter. Tortilla recipe would make 6 servings. ***UPDATE*** To make tortilla bowls for taco salad, I placed uncooked tortillas on top of a ball of aluminum foil. Make sure you spray the ball with PAM so it doesn't stick. Cook for 400 degrees for about 10-15 minutes, depending how big the tortillas are. This makes healthier non-fried bowls.

I did it! I made tortillas! Thanks for posting this recipe, I thought it was very difficult to make tortillas. I added extra tablespoon or so of shortening....till cornmeal consistency.
I let the dough rest an hour. 
They turned out wonderful!
Definitely worth it.

After trying other recipes (Authentic Mexican Tortillas and Mexican Whole Wheat Flour Tortillas) I can say this one is the one I like best.  It is low in fat but tastes great!  It is easy to make and if you let it rest at least 1 hour it rolls out thin and holds together like the ones you buy at the store.  I took the advice of other reviewers and used very hot water and was careful to not overcook them.  That is very important to be sure they are soft enough to fold.  It only takes about 10-15 seconds per side.  I also like 10-12 inch tortillas so I only made 7 out of the recipe so they would be big enough for soft tacos for my teen age boys.  
With the price of store tortillas going up so much this is a great way to go!

As per some of the other reviews, I was anticipating a horrible ordeal making these, but it turned out to be quite the contrary. 
I used very hot water, and added about 2 tbsp. extra. Wasn't sure if I had the texture of the dough right as there was no mention of that in the recipe. They rolled out quite easily and I was able to make them quite thin. Overall, I thought they were great, and will make them again.

Excellent tortillas!! These were a snap to throw together and tasted great. I made 8 large tortillas instead of 12 smaller ones because we like to really stuff them. They rolled out nicely and really thin. Didn't need much bench four but it's a dry day out today. Foe those of you having trouble rolling them out. You need to really let them rest. Flour has a lot of gluten and when you mix it the gluten strands get tight. That is why should also take care not to over knead the dough either. Let it rest for at least 20 min. before rolling and another 20 min. before cooking. This will give you a great tortilla. I usually roll them early in the day and cook them up right before eating. Perfect.

My mother makes home-made tortillas and she never had a recipe for it. I looked here and made these tortillas, they were gone in one day(I had ever doubled the batch!)

Let me just say I am not Mexican. I don't have any beautiful stories about my grandma rolling out tortillas, 20 dozen at a time. And actualy, I like store bought tortillas. My mom always bought tortillas from the grocery store, I've always bought tortillas from the grocery store, and my 3-year old son loves to snack on a good old Mission-brand tortilla plain. Recently we moved to Switzerland and store bought tortillas are about $6 or $7 for a bag of 5! I was looking for a recipe in hopes that they wouldn't be too different than the store bought tortillas I have grown up on. These are perfect, sure I made my adjustments (more fat, mmm)and they ended up looking more like ameobas than circles. But they were great and close to store bought, just a little better. My son still loves to snack on these plain and we can do everything we did with the good ole' mission brand.

I had a lot of trouble rolling the dough into rounds...  It was good, but I think I'll try store-bought tortillas next time.

Thank you for the measurments.  I make them all the time but never had a reciepe... Yahoo.. I do now and it worked out fine.  Tips that Iwould recommend it making sure your water is very hot I use boiling hot and use a fork to stir till my hands can tolerate the heat.  Then knead dough and I use a plastic wrap the ball and clean up the mess I have made. Get my pan ready approx 20 min later I pinch the dough and make a round ball and press to a flat disk then roll from the center out it should come out round and even on edges.  Try to get the same amount of dough each time for consitant tortilla.  Now it is hard to find a small roller but those are the best approx 8 inches long and 1" diameter.  Don't cook too long look at resturants or store bought see they are not real brown... Now if you want to increase taste use lard....

Super recipe - didn't have to change a thing. For people who are having a hard time rolling these out, you might want to knead these for a bit to get the dough to a nice, silky consistency. I covered and kept them for about half and hour instead of 15 minutes. The finished tortillas were so good and they were not crispy at all. Used these with the Pico de gallo chicken quesadillas recipe from this site. Yummy! Having the leftovers for lunch today :)Almost forgot to mention - I substituted butter for the lard.

These had a very nice flavor, much better even than the preservative-free "homestyle" tortillas you get at Whole Foods. You do need to let the dough rest for quite a while, at least 30 minutes, to allow the gluten to relax before rolling them. I also found they needed just a bit more water, but I think this depends on the brand of flour you use. I used King Arthur, which does seem to absorb more liquid than others I've tried.

These are great! Loved the flavor and the texture. I didn't really measure the shortening, I just put a few spoonfuls in. To make a uniform shape I rolled the dough balls out and then used a saucepan lid to cut them into perfect circles. With the leftover dough I just made one odd shaped one! For me this recipe made six 7 inch tortillas and the one smaller odd shaped tortilla. Will definitely use this recipe again! Thanks!

Thanks for providing measurements.  My mom was a "pinch of this, handful of that" type of cook, so I never had a consistent recipe.
A couple of suggestions:  Once the dough comes together, pinch them off in to equal-sized balls.  Rub a small amount of oil on them, then place in an oiled bowl.  If you have a gas stove, place the covered bowl in the oven (don't turn on the oven) and let sit as described.  The oil prevents the dough from getting too sticky, and the warmth makes them lighter in texture (almost like rising bread) and more pliable.
Make sure that you also flour the rolling pin to prevent the masa from sticking.  You may also need to gently stretch the margins of each tortilla prior to cooking, as they tenf to shrink a little.
Again, great recipe!  My non-Hispanic friends are drooling already!

I did one batch with a few changes: I used the 2 cups flour, about ½ tsp salt, ½ tsp baking powder, 4 or 5 TBS lard, and more like 5/8 cup of water. I used the food processor to mix the ingredients, and I let the big ball of dough rest for maybe 45 minutes. I also let the small dough balls (I made 8) rest for maybe 15 minutes before rolling out. They weren't very pretty, but they tasted great! The first side cooked for about 45 seconds, the second for maybe 30 seconds. To reheat and soften them up, I popped two at a time in the microwave with damp paper towels around and between them for 15 seconds. Excellent and tasty! Thanks for sharing, Teresa!

These tortillas are wonderful! My only complaint is that it didn't make too many. I cut them in 12 like the recipe called for, but they were a little on the small side (we were using the for burritos, and we like to stuff our burritos.) so I only got 6 tortillas out of this recipe. And like someone else mentioned: Put them immediately into a plastic bag. Any kind of plastic bag will do as long as it doesn't have holes it in. This will keep the steam in and keep the tortillas soft and flexible. Every tortilla recipe I tried came out hard and they would break when you try to fold them, I almost gave up on home made tortillas until I read that tip, so I'd like to give a BIG thank you to the review who mentioned the plastic bag technique.

This was a fun recipe to try.  My arms got sore from rolling out the dough - but they were really delicious.  I made chicken fahitas in them.  Next time I'll double the recipe and save some for breakfast burritos!

This is a great recipe for a beginner or someone who just needs a quick batch of tasty tortillas.  However, I used 1/3 C. of lard.  The texture is great and the taste is pretty good.  Much better than the store bought.  Seems like there's something still missing.  Maybe I need more salt?  They don't quite taste like the ones my old tia's use to make, but still is a great recipe!

This was such an easy recipe to prepare. I had to use quite a bit more shortening (I used lard) than what was called for. I am not sure how much I used but I would guess 1/3C. This made the most delicate dough. Wonderful recipe. I would recommend this recipe.

I LOVED them, no exaggeration. This was a very basic tortilla and yet they were better than any store-bought brand I've even bought. I halved the recipe and made TWELVE mini tortillas... and they tasted great; made some great chicken fajitas with them! Next time, I'll add garlic powder and white pepper for more flavor. I recommend these to anyone who wants to try the real deal and not the store-bought with 10 unnecessary ingredients.

These were very easy to make and tasted good. My biggest complaint is the quantity. I managed to get 8 small tortillas out of this. And only by rolling them paper thin. Next time I'm either making it into 6 or doing a recipe and a half. I have no idea how the original recipe writer managed to get 12!

Really good! I doubled the shortening and the salt and the water too. I also used half whole wheat flour. This only made about 4 normal size tortillas, though, so double or triple for a larger group. Delicious and so easy!

I love these tortillas. I make them, use the ones I need, and freeze the rest. I love having fresh tortillas in the morning.

Awesome recipe!  My 4 year old loved them plain.  I loved the fact that these had little shortening in them to make it more healthy!

Very good, added 2T shortening as other reviewers suggested, and had to end up adding extra water also to make it the right dough-y consistency.

I don't know what I did, but these weren't that good. They tasted alright but the dough was really dry and I had to add extra water to get the dough to pull together and they were tough to roll out. They weren't flexible (lucky for me I was making quesadillas so they didn't have to wrap around anything. And I rolled them very thin but they got a little thicker while cooking. I don't think I'll even try this one again. It was more work than it's worth.

These were perfect, I changed one thing just because I didn't want oil in them like store bought ones. So I replaced the oil with 1tsp of xanthan gum.

I just made these for lunch and they were very good.  I took other reviewers suggestions and added more shortening (somewhere between 1/4 and 1/3 cup total) and boiling water (close to 3/4 cup).  I used half whole wheat and half all purpose flour.  Next time I'll use less whole wheat.  We really liked them. I never thought I would make tortillas, but these were easy to do.  If I had more time I would have kneaded the dough longer and let it rest longer - next time. Thanks for the recipe.

The best tortilla recipe I've found so far.  We had absolutely no problem rolling them out nor did we have to add additional flour (today, anyways = grin - who knows about tomorrow).  Made 7 2oz balls which were juuuuuuust about fine for smaller burritos.  Only change would be to perhaps drop salt a bit as ours came out rather salty.  We did use scalding hot water, mixed, separated into balls, then let rest for 30 minutes before rolling.  Outstanding and thank you so much for recipe.

These came out great. Fairly crisp (The thinner the crisper I'm guessing) although some were a bit softer and those seemed to be the slightly thicker ones. I made these for ground chicken tacos and they were a hit! No need to run to the store - the rolling may take a bit of time but it sure was deliciously worth it! :)

Great simple base recipe. Very helpful instructions.  I substituted 1.5 cups whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup flax for some flavour!

These were easy to make, but they were really hard and dry. I have another recipe I tried yesterday with just flour, olive oil, salt and water that I liked better - I'm just using that from now on.

Good, although a little hard to roll out though. Heat has to be turned down 1/3 the way through or they burn too quickly,.

We have had a blizzard here and are pretty much out of groceries, so I thought I would try these. They definitely taste better than store bought, but not as soft as some other made from scratch. I didn't have shortening so I used butter instead. Also, I used kosher salt and they were super salty. I think I will try them again with shortening and hot water like another member suggested. Even though they weren't excellent they were still pretty good and not too much work, my kids even helped.

My Grandma used to make tortillas daily.  She would roll & flip them so quickly -she was amazing!!!  Her tortillas were delicious, thin, soft and PERFECTLY round.  Well I probably have about twenty years before mine even come close to hers but this is a start!  My mom never measures when she makes hers but we made some together and figured these are pretty darn close!  When I rolled these thin they turned out like crackers.  Rolled slightly thicker, they stayed soft. My Grandma always divided her dough, then let it rest for about 30 minutes & always cooked them on a cast iron comal.  They're best fresh but if there are any left, we wrap the stack in a paper towel and put them in a plastic bag.  Just zap each tortilla in the microwave for about 10 seconds when you're ready to eat it.

I thought there were horrible! Took the dough 1 cup of water to even start to come together. When I put them on my tortilla press they came out like chips. It was a horrible experiance. The dough was hard as a rock after 5 minutes of sitting out. Even the "just add water" kind was better then this. Won't make again this way.

These are great but i had to make them twice the first batch did not have enough water, so they were hard and craking and i surely could not bend them, i threw that batch out and tried again, this time i added water until the dough formed a ball but was almost to the sticky stage but if you get to the sticky stage add more flour, i formed little balls and I let them rest for 30 mins, you should be able to roll out the dough without any cracks forming along the edges and it not be sticky, when  cooked they were perfect i was able to bend them and they are going to be perfect in tonight dinner.  Good luck all

These turned out perfectly, and they were my first attempt at tortillas. BUT HOLY COW, ROLLING THIN TORTILLAS IS EXHAUSTING!  We rolled them extremely thinly, because we needed them to be large enough for our recipe ("Addictive Sweet Potato Burritos").  Once we got them rolled out (worked fine, but is tiring) and cooked in a cast-iron pan, they were divine to work with. They were crispy, but were still maleable enough to fill to the brim and roll. 
I give this recipe an A+, but, man, rolling is a lot of work!

Ok. I was a bit intimidated to begin with, but this was fairly easy to make. I accidentally put 2 tbsp shortening and also left out the baking powder per someone's recommendation. I put everything but the water in the food processor to mix it together. I heated the water in the microwave so it was VERY hot. When the other stuff seemed sufficiently mixed I started pouring the water in a little at a time while it mixed. After about 1/2 to 3/4 of a cup of water it started to ball up and I knew it was done. I just shut it off, pulled out the ball and then put it on the counter to rest. Taste was pretty good, but I think I will tinker a little with it. Thanks for a great recipe!

My first ever homemade tortillas.  These were great!  I don't like the taste of store bought tortillas...they taste good, but have an unpleasant aftertaste.

I have to confess that I used margarine instead of shortening because I was craving tortillas and didn't have any shortening.  They turned out great!!

These tortillas tasted great!  My only regret was not doubling the recipe.  Because this is my first time ever making tortillas, mine weren't very pretty.  They definetly weren't nice round circles!  I'll work on that each and every time I make them as I plan on making these often.

I love home made tortillas. I substitute Armour Lard for the shortening and they come out perfect every time! If you have a tortilla (mine is terra cotta), put the tortillas in it as soon as you cook them, it will hold the warmth & moisture. I store the leftovers in a zip-loc after dinner...they stay very moist this way.

Simple.  Yummy.  NO PRESERVATIVES!  Rolled them out between plastic wrap, and placed them immediately after cooking into a plastic bag.  I'm not a fan of plastic, but I got the results I was hoping for.  Mission Tortillas can chalk off another customer!

wow!  No more store bought, preservative laden tortillas for me.  I make this as written for company, but when its just me and my daughter, I use whole grain flour, a couple tbl spoons of ground flax and wheat germ.  So much cheaper and tastier than the ones at the store.  Eating so healthy is the only way I can maintain my "skinny" weight.  Thanks for making it so easy for me!

This was the first time I've ever made my own tortillas, but they turned out great!  By the time I had used all the dough, I had the process down pretty good.  I did have to turn the heat down to medium though, because they tried to scorch on the higher setting.  My daughter loved helping me cook these!

These are simply brilliant! I was craving a tortilla tonight but I was low on money, so purchasing was not in mind. I found this recipe and it saved me money and saved me from my craving! I wrapped my tortillas in plastic bags then in a towel to keep them nice and moist since they were quite crispy. I also took a plate and used that to cut my tortilla's in nice circles! 

Thanks for this lovely recipe!!

Great recipe, first time I ever made flat bread and turn out great.  Needed to double the recipe to make big enough tortillas for the kids to fill but turned out really well. A couple were dry but I think it came down to the storage prior to serving. I used a damp t-towel and most were fine. I also cook them on an electic crepe cooker and they were fine. No complaints from the kids...score 1 to Dad!

We love these tortillas!  Please keep in mind (according to one of my hispanic friends), tortilla making is a learned skill.  The more of these I make, the better they are.  Things that make them easier to make: use very hot water; you may need more water than the recipe calls for, I find a nice soft dough (but not sticky) works best for me; I use more shortening than called for; it took time for me to get nice round tortilla - don't expect store-bought round; double the recipe and finally, when cooking, I keep the cooked tortillas covered with foil - they are always nice and soft.

They are a little too salty and there's no way you'll be able to make 12 .

I followed the recipe exactly, but my tortillas were dry, hard to roll out, and after cooking them they tasted like a cracker.  For me it will be better to keep buying them from the store.

I have been making these for several months now.  My family is so spoiled, I will never be able to buy tortillas at the store again!  When we use these to make quesadillas in our panini maker, we will throw some plain tortillas in the panini maker until crisp.....they turn out like a cracker/pita chip and they don't stick around long enough to find out how amazing they would actually be with a dip.  Tonight the tortillas will be used for baked chimichangas.  I have no doubt they will be perfect for that as well!  Thank you so much for the recipe!

These turned out great! It was my first time succesfully making tortillas. My hubby said they tasted better than store-bought. They did not turn out perfect, but it was my own fault and not the recipes. I did not add enough water at first, and the dough was REALLY tough, but after letting it rest for about 20 min, it was rollable, and a little less like rubber. I would advise you to add plenty of water, and then a little flour at a time to even it out. Cooking time was not listed, and after my first two tortillas came out like crackers, I learned my lesson. If you place the tortilla in and flip it every 5 secs or so JUST until the dough turns from the yellow-like dough to white, (but before the brown spots heat up) and you put them in a large baggie lined with two paper towels, they turn out GREAT! Practice makes perfect, so I will DEFINATELY use this recipe again!

--> Update: Tried again, and without a flaw! These are SOO much better than storebought! I learned the tricks: use very warm water, and even on a low heat it's only a few seconds on each side, and roll them THIN :-) Don't second guess the cooking time, it's really all it needs is a little heat! P.S. Nonstick pan is best way to go!

Instead of shortening, I used 3:1 parts butter and honey -- the honey definitely made the recipe.

Wow, I am so impressed by these tortillas.  I tripled the recipe, which made 13 huge burrito sized tortillas.  I won't use another recipe.  Did have to add a little more water than suggested.

I was really intimidated by the thought of making my own tortillas but my husband wanted them so I made them and it ended up being very simple. I actually made them last night and we ate them all and then I made them again today for the leftover filling for lunch. The first time I accidently only added 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp baking powder and they still turned out fine but I think the texture was better today with the full amt of salt and baking powder. I too had to add extra water - almost double and I also used a little more than double the shortening in order to get my flour to the right consistency. Today it took me about 45 minutes from start to finish - including the 15 min resting time with my two year old "helping" and making the rest of lunch. Definately worth it. When rolling the dough, I found that it was easiest for me to flatten it into discs, roll it a bit and then pick it up with my hands and sorta let it stretch pizza dough style- which i have never done before and there was no tossing involved but it gave the tortillas a better shape than just rolling. Also last night I let the dough rest for over an hour and this was unnecessary as it was just as easy to handle today after only 15 min of rest. Thank you for the great recipe!

I've tried a few different recipes for tortillas and I like these the best.  They were light and fluffy and had good flavor.  They were very soft and flexible.  I used some suggestions by other reviewers and made sure I used the hottest water I could get out of my tap and I made sure I didn't cook them to long. Maybe only 30-35 seconds per side.

I liked these enough to make them my regular recipe. This recipe doesn't make many (and we like our tortillas a little larger to hold fillings) so next time I will double or possibly triple the recipe. Overall this was an easy recipe my daughter helped me make and they were soft and yummy! Oh, and I don't have a cast iron skillet but they worked just fine in my non-stick skillet. *****UPDATE: These are even great with all purpose white flour - in fact, we liked them better.

After having disaster with Whole Wheat Wraps from this site I was hesitant to try another tortilla recipe. But I decided to give this recipe a shot after reading the good reviews  As others suggested, I added 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp salt and made the dough in my food processor. I let the dough rest for 25 minutes. The dough was like a play dough texture. The shaping was the hardest part and none of mine were round but just as tasty or even better than store bought ones.

As I have never made tortillas and didn't have the first clue about making them I faced a bit of a dilemma with this recipe. Did I follow the advice of the majority of reviewers and leave out the baking powder and up the fat or did I do what I usually like to do and follow the recipe as is. In the end I went with the recipe as written. I had no idea what tortilla dough looks like but I was a bit worried that this was going to break when I rolled it but I soldiered on and am glad I did. I may know nothing about making tortillas but I do know about eating them and these were good . I still think I may try them again with reviewers suggestions though. Thanks for giving me a learning experience.

I give this recipe four stars because it gave me a great place to start. I adjusted the crisco to about 1/4 cup, and used 3/4 cups water, other than that I followed the instructions. These are great, I will make these often.

Just a note if using a press/rolling pin if you press between wax paper it stops the problem of sticking and the paper is reusable as well.

I made the following changes:

I'm just learning the art of tortilla making, so my rating could be a bit unfair to the recipe.  This is the second one I've tried and I'm very happy with the taste - fresh tortillas are amazing.  I have a lot of trouble rolling them out, even though I add extra liquid and let the dough rest.  I probably need a smaller rolling pin, etc and I'll be able to roll them out thinner, which I think makes them a lot better.  Thanks for the recipe!!

These tasted all right, but no matter how hard I rolled or how much I  stretched the dough, I could not get one to a 7" diameter, and they were much thicker than commercial tortillas when cooked. Maybe more water, or another tablespoon of shortening would make the dough more pliable. At least my family found my first effort edible!

They tasted good but I wasn't able to get them thin enough for my liking even with a press or rolling them. I'll try a little more water next time.

These are great!  I thought they were kind of small, so next time, I'll plan better.  Regardless, they taste great!  Also, my husband and I cut them up and deep fried them for tortilla chips which were also fabulous!

These are wonderful! I will leave out the baking powder next time as it is completely unnecessary. I added tomato and basil to mine.  I might add a little wheat flour to them next time. I made spur of the moment burritos for my husband. I will be making this again!

The best tortillas ever!  These are a little harder to roll out!  They are totally worth the work!  I had to use more water than it called for.  I also doubled the batch and made the same amount a single batch would make.  First time I made these, they didn't last long enough for my husband to come home from work!

These were great and super easy to make. I tried to make then a little healthier and used EVOO instead of shortening and whole wheat flour.

This recipe worked well. I believe this takes some practice though. The first batch turned out a bit tough and floury, but I would attribute that to my skill and not this recipe. The second batched turned out much better. However, some toritillas were tougher than others. So, inconsistent throughout the batch. I give this recipe 4 stars as I think it is the right mix of ingredients. One needs to enhance their skills at handling the dough to get the right result.

I was expecting tortillas to be much harder to make. This recipe was super easy, very few ingredients which make them tons and tons cheaper than the grocery store. The only change I made was to use half whole wheat flour and half all purpose. I also needed quite a bit more water but that probably had to do with the flour switch. I only ended up with 7 or so, so next time I'll double or triple the recipe. Awesome!

These were perfect texture and taste. I used them to make enchiladas and they came out soft but sturdy even after baking in sauce. I will definately cut into fewer pieces before rolling out for a larger tortilla next time.

Would definitely cut down on the salt.  I used 1 Tbsp unsalted butter instead of shortening.  Had to roll extremely thin to get tortillas that were somewhat pliable.  Will probably try a different recipe next time or cheat and buy the uncooked tortillas from Costco!

I was looking for recipes like the soft tortillas you get at mexican restaurants. These were good, but not quite it. I am not sure why mine were a little on the crispy side, even though I barely cooked them. They were kind of dry. Maybe if I steamed them after cooking? It was fun to make these with my sister though.

Fantastic! I made two batches that each made 12 med burito/fajita size tortillas.  I needed to add another 1/4cup of water, but that may be because of the whole wheat flour I had to use because I was low on the regular stuff. To anyone complaining of dryness, you must use a damp kitchen towel to store just cooked tortillas no matter their size or thickness...I'm not sure of any recipe for tortillas that would not require you to do so.  I was able to roll my tortillas out very thin: once I got the hang of it, I could roll one out as the other was cooking. Also, for a little more flavor on my second batch, I substituted the salt for ham soup base...yummy!  Thank you for the recipe, I doubt I will ever buy store bought again!

Very good!  I used them to make burritos.  I wish I would of tested one before being made into a burrite.  I only got 6 tortillas from this recipe, I tried to get 12, but they were too little.  Before making them again, I am going to get a tortilla press.  Thanks for the recipe!

They were dry and crunchy and tasted too floury.  Even after cooling for a bit, they never got soft.  My son wouldn't take more than a bite and my husband wasn't at all impressed.  I won't be making this again.

Yippee!! Much better than other tortilla recipes I've tried. The dough actually allows you to roll it thin which is essential. I think the most helpful instruction was to get the flour/ shortening to the texture of cornmeal. Way to spell it out! I also used warm water as another reviewer suggested and found the dough very pliable and strechy. My life has been seriously lacking Mexican food since I moved to Europe 4 years ago... not anymore!! Now if I could just find some masa harina over here to try corn tortillas... doubtful.

I didn't know I could make a tortilla! Yeah! I will say, doing 12 pieces never got to 7 inches for me, so I will do less next time. (update, I did 6 pieces - MUCH BETTER!) The flour and shortening never really got to the consitency described, but that was ok. It all still worked. The only change the the recipe for me was I warmed up the water. Again, mine were small and came out more like soft shells for tacos. No prob though, we had it with rice, refried beans, salsa, and cheese. Yummy and Fun for the family!

These are wonderful. Turned out perfect. My only change was to warm the water a little. The first two were mis-shapen so slowed down and made into round disc shapes first before rolling thin. Fast and easy.

I roll these onto a surface sprayed with a mist of oil and with a rolling pin misted as well.  This keeps them just right for the cooking!

Super easy and turned out nicely. Mine came out thin and kind of delicate. I didn't use hot water, uh was I supposed to? The dough was really sticky when I made 6 little balls of it, but I floured my hands well and the rolling pin too and they turned out just like I get at a local taqueria! My first homemade tortillas... so simple. The taste was decent too, but not anything wow. I used White Wings flour as it's recommended for tortilla making. I cut this in half and got 6 tortillas just as stated. To keep these warm and make them soft, I put them in my tortilla keeper as soon as they are done and put the lid on, by the time you have cooked the last one, the others are all still warm and very soft and pliable too. Thanks Teresa for sharing this, I really enjoyed trying these. UPDATE: Second time around I made the full recipe. I used the hottest tap water and it did take more than the given amount to get the dough to ball up. Somehow I got 13 tortillas out of this? They weren't 7 inches, only 6. I have trouble getting them circular as mine are a bit lopsided as you can see in the pic, but they were almost as good as my favorite taqueria's so who cares?

This recipe is awesome!  I have never made tortillas before, and it was an easy yummy recipe!  I used 1/4 cup shortening as recommended by other users and they turned out great.  My husband said no more need to buy store bought tortillas!

Great recipe! TIP: If you want the tortillas to puff up and brown when cooking (They are supposed to puff up a little, like when you fry them) and not become crunchy when cooling make sure you have the griddle preheated enough. Otherwise they come out sort of dense. Also,  do make sure the water is hot.

Okay so I tried to make this recipie with 1/2 Wheat flour and 1/2 white flour! Sorry I was just trying to be healthy. They were very difficult to roll out and get them round. The taste was okay, a little doughy.  I am thinking that I should have used more baking soda because the wheat flour is heavier that white. I might try these again with just white flour like the recipie called for. ;)

Not enough shortening! It needs at least 3 times as much. In order to make good tortillas the water must be as hot as you can stand it. I would never make this recipe again.

I had to add about 1/2 cup more water, way too dry as is. After doing that they came out really great! One tip, you need to have a glass dinner plate set inside a plastic grocery bag. As you make the tortillas place them on the plate and reclose the bag. This steams the tortillas and you wont have the "hockey puck" effect. For those making tortillas for the first time, dont worry if they are a little stiff, as they steam they will soften up nicely(if you didnt overcook them) Just cook until you see the brown/black small spots appear and pop them into the bag. AS you cook you will notice that the ones on the bottom have already begun to soften!Just made a second batch...used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 white flour, came out really great(still have to add extra water).

Very delicious and easy to make recipe. Although, my dough was dry and needed an additional 4 tablespoons of water, it came out great. This was only my second time making homemade tortillas. I used a different recipe the first time, but I decided to try this one based on the reviews. This was definetely better. They were very soft, chewy, and had great flavor. My husband loved them and so did my girls! Thanks for posting.

Tonight I realized that I forgot to buy tortillas at the store so I decided to try to make them, and I'm so glad that I did. The flavor is nothing like store bought tortillas, it's amazing! I could not be happier with how they turned out.

These turned out really well. I doubled the recipe for my family of 7 and there were no leftovers. I did add more shortening, till it resembled coarse crumbs and did not need the full 2 cups water. Perhaps the extra shortening changed the consistency, but the dough ended up like pie dough. It was easy to handle and worked well for our soft tacos, although I ended up eating mine with a fork. It still tasted good and I will be making these again!

So easy! I had no trouble and these rolled out perfectly. I used 2 additional tsp of water and the dough was just right. The high humidity here called for extra bench flour when rolling but warm, fresh tortillas are worth a little mess! I'll be skipping those chewy store bought things from now on.

The consistency after being cooked was right, but they did not taste very good.  I made them in a pinch when I found myself out of tortillas for fish tacos.  Next time will make a trip to the store, would not make again.

I doubled the recipe and added a tsp of sugar. Mixed it all up in my stand mixer with dough hook. Didn't need to floor the counter to roll them out. Excellent recipe.

These were good, easy to roll, but had floury  taste, still not bad. Another thing, this recipe needs some adjustment, use less flour or more liquid, 3/4-1 c water not 1/2 for sure, more oil. I would not say they are better than mission tortillas. I will tweak this recipe or try another one next time, and with vegetable oil instead of crisco.

I used butter instead of shortening and made sure the water was very hot.  I probably rolled too much and added too much flour, but they still came out beautifully and remain soft after 3 days.  I don't think I'll be buying grocery store tortillas again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I recently read the list of ingredients on store-bought tortillas and was horrified, so I decided to make my own.  I chose this recipe based on the ratings and reviews.  It was easy, fast, and fun, and the tortillas are delicious.  I used lard instead of shortening, and had to add an extra tablespoon to get the required cornmeal consistency.  Dividing my dough into twelve rounds made for small, roughly 4" tortillas.  I'm also not practiced at rolling so they came out in odd shapes.  I fried one at a time, so with that small amount of practice by the end I had two good-sized, round ones I was proud of.  I ate my very first hot, homemade tortilla with jam.  Very tasty!

These are great! Didn't change a thing (wait...did use butter instead of shortening) and will definitely be making these instead of store bought from now on. SUPER SIMPLE! My two daughters, 11 and 14 had a blast making these and rolling them out. I think they have great flavor and depending on how they were rolled out...either resembled "gordita" type bread or regular flour tortillas. Both my girls did a batch each. One made 9 tortillas and the other made 7. (the batch that made 7 were thicker and more like the gordita type bread) Yummy! Thanks for sharing the recipe! :)

Although I made changes I will still rate this 5 stars. After reading some reviews I reduced the baking powder to 1/2 t and increased the shortening to 2T. I also used 1/2c wheat and 1 & 1/2 AP. I will use this recipe again and use all AP flour and increase the salt a tad. I did use very hot water and let the dough rest 1 hour. It handled, rolled and cooked well. My yield was 7 8" + 1 6" and thanks to whom ever suggested using a pot lid to shape them.

I am having a very hard time getting the dough to stop sticking. It's so sticky it's impossible to knead. I tried waiting an additional 15 minutes with no luck. Then I tried adding more flour. I added almost an extra 1/2 C of flour. Still nothing.

Worked perfectly. Had no problems. Only thing different I would mention is add an extra 1/4 of a cup of water total to get the right texture for the dough.

I was disappointed that I wasn't able to use my new tortilla press (from Amazon) with this recipe, but rolling it out paper thin was easy with a rolling pin. I did substitute the shortening with Blue Bonnet Light Margerine Spread and it worked very well.

These were great! The only problem I had was making them round (which they definitely weren't) but that's more user error than the recipe. :) My 4-year-old loved them, so we'll be making this often! Thank you.

It was different than what I thought, but easier to make than I thought.  I rolled my dough out paper thin, but when it cooked up it had alot more bread on the inside.  Not sure if that was supposed to happen or not.  It tasted very good otherwise, but it's kinda like a wrap, not a tortilla.  I will make again.

This was the first time I ever made tortillas from scratch and I feel very proud of my creations!  This was very easy, but there was no way I was getting 12 tortillas that could have any kind of filling in them!  I made 7-8 medium sized tortillas, and the only complaint I have is that they were pretty crunchy and stiff. I wish the instructions said to roll them out SUPER THIN, and gave hints for keeping them soft.  Next time I will double the recipe and try putting them in a plastic bag to get soft.  THANKS for the great recipe though!

Good recipe for flour tortillas but I used hot water instead and rolled them out real thin to create a softer tortilla. Thanks.

Taste great!!!  Made these tonight for our fajitas.  My daughter & I loved them; much better than store bought.  Hubby not home, but sure he will feel the same way.  I used 1/2 tsp. salt & baking powder, and about 1/4 cup shortening.

Great recipe! This was the first time I made tortillas and I loved them! So much better than store bought tortillas. I did have to use more water than the recipe called for.  I don't know if this is an altitude thing since I live in a pretty high altitude but I used about 1/4 cup more hot water. I also used 2 TBL shortening instead of 1.  It made 10 tortillas for me. I think the trick is rolling them very very very thin. That way you will get more out of the recipe. Thanks!

Excellent recipe! Reminds me of the tortillas my grandma makes. I didn't follow the recipe exactly, I used it as a guideline. Then, instead of measuring everything exactly, I just measured it out in my hand and guessed so I may have been a bit more or a bit less on ingredients but it wouldn't have been by much. And they came out perfect!

I probably messed this up since everyone else seems to love these. I used King Arthur's white whole wheat flour.  I halfed the recipe but wasn't able to make 6 tortillas, I made 2 that were about 10".  Didn't taste good to me, but I'd like to try them again with regular white flour and maybe use a cast iron skillet instead of nonstick.

Since I live in the country side in Japan, it is hard to get tortillas. I have to drive more than an hour to get them. So I decided to make them myself. I took some advises here: used 3 tbs of shortening and let them rest more than an hour. The result came very good. it was easy to roll the dough. Didn't stick to hands and a rolling stick at all, though I used enough flour when I rolled them. I thought they tasted better than tortillas from shops. However, the tortillas became hard a minute later I finished baking...

Yum!  I suggest making eight rather than twelve with this recipe.  Even when I got them as flat as they would go, they were still very small.

I love home made tortillas and this was a good recipe. I did use lard instead of shorting and i cooked them in a non stick pan on medhigh to high for about 5sec on each side then put them in a zip lock that had a moist paper towel in it imediatly until i was ready to serve.

These were really good!  I didn't end up cooking them very long because after the first one (I let it get bubbly like the recipe states) I could tell they would be too crunchy to roll up for the burritos I was making.  I also used half whole wheat flour and they were perfect!  Thanks for an easy tortilla recipe!

These were pretty good and surprisingly easy to make. I had to use about double the shortening to get the right consistency, and a tiny bit more water. Next time I will try and sub butter or margarine as I try to avoid using shortening as much as possible. I found the dough quite easy to roll out. They don't stay soft long though...unless there is a way to store them that I am not aware of.

I was able to get 12 tortillas but they were much too small. I probably should have just made 6 instead. Next time I'll make a double batch. TIP: I substituted 1/2 cup of the regular flour with wheat flour. It gave it a fantastic flavor but I had to add more water to make the dough firm enough.

This was my first attempt at making tortillas. The only hard part was rolling that very small amount of dough into 7 inch circles. However,it didn't stick to the counter at all! I ended up making only 8, the result being very chewy, with a good taste. I may make them again.

Awesome!!!  Very easy and very tasty.  When I pulled my store bought tortillas out of the fridge, I realized they had long since expired so I made this recipe at the last minute.  My husband absolutely loved them and didn't leave room for dessert!  I didn't make it to 12 tortillas.  I made 10 instead.  Our family is small so it was perfect.  I don't think I'll use store bought again unless absolutely necessary.

My attempt did not turn out well at all. They were hard and would not Ben. When I tried to tear a piece off they crumbled. I threw them away. Maybe for someone who knows what they are doing but definitely not for a beginner.

Who knew making tortillas was so easy. I did need to substitute the shortening with butter since my crisco had gone bad. They turned out great. It is just a bit time consuming since I was rolling and grilling just one tortilla at a time  but the process is very simple to do and everyone liked them.

It turned out more like naan. Maybe I need a tortilla press. But oh well. The family was full from just one quesadilla.  It was super delicious. My kids couldn’t stop telling me how delicious it was and that mommy was a great cook. Lol. Thanks!

These were so easy! I’ve tried many different flour tortilla recipes  and this is by far the best, every one turned out great. I followed the recipe exactly and doubled it. It did need extra water- approx 1/2 cup extra water for a double batch.

this recipe is great for a starter. I modified it a bit. I found that you need about twice as much shortening for the dough to form right.

I had a blast making this recipe... but I suck at it. they came out kinda crunchy...but they did not taste bad at all... I will try this again soon. I have so many questions. are you supposed to roll it out paper thin? how long are you supposed to work it? or is this like pie crust where you're supposed to barely touch it? anyway, I was laughing at myself so hard trying to make it all work.

I substituted 3 tablespoons margarine instead of the shortening, it worked great.

These were easy and pretty good, but took a while.  I used butter and had to add a bit more.  I also had to add a bit more water.  The rolling out was my least favorite part and took the longest.  I had made refried beans from scratch yesterday, so as soon as the tortillas were done, I made myself a burrito.  Pretty good!

I will never go back to store bought tortillas! We have been using this recipe in our house for a year now and thought I had better add a review! These are so simple and absolutely delicious! I make it exactly as the recipe says and they turn out fabulous everytime.

You need twice as much water to get it to come together and then you still have an extremely HARD dough rock. Go look at some  real Spanish people making tortillas and you wont ever see what this recipe ends up looking like come the end. Terrible waste of ingredients  and time.

These tasted wonderful, but I could not get them round at all, so I had great tasting tortillas shaped like the continent Africa!  Great flavor and texture, so I'll just have to practice rolling them out.

I followed the recipe exactly. Growing up I had watched my nana make them numerous times without a book in sight. They turned out great everytime. I tried this one with doubts they would compare. I was wrong. Tasted so close to hers. I will definitely be making these again. The only change I will make is to double the recipe.

Not bad, got rave reviews from the family, but I expected them to be softer and not quite so dry. Maybe they'll moisten up a bit more when reheating in my new tortilla keeper. I will definitely make these again and add more water. The half cup wasn't enough. Maybe I' lo use less flour rolling out too.... absolutely worth trying again!!!!

I omitted the baking powder the second time I made these and used butter because I don't have shortening. They turned out well both ways, but my preference is w/o the powder.

Wasn't anything to brag about,  but they worked. Mine had excess flour that I couldn't get rid of,  not a big deal.  Kids ate them so I'd use them in a pinch, but think I'll stick to buying them.

I made this exactly to the recipe. I doubled it. The dough was a bit dry. I added a bit more water to moisten it and let them sit on and under moist towels. I kneaded them slightly. I also use hot water. I have a recipe for thick chewy tortillas that is more of a Texas/Native American recipe that I love. These aren't as chewy as I had hoped for. Still great though! I like to add cilantro and jalapenos to my tortilla mix too, makes them very good.

Made as directed. Used baking powder without aluminuim (I think regular baking powder has a bitter after-taste). I will never use store-bought again.

I did everything accordingly except I wanted mine big so I only made eight. Some were on the thick side, some were on the thin side. Some burned and some were perfect. Some were round and some were not. Careful on getting too much loose flour on your skillet cause it creates a chalky burn likeness on your tortilla. I just wiped my skillet over the the sink with a paper towel and continued. I didnt use hot water like some reviews suggested and I gave them ,as said, only fifteen minutes with a wet towel before rolling out. Great recipe! I will keep practicing so I can show this recipe off.

Perfect tortillas. My technique needs some work but they taste great. Almost as good as grandmas.

This recipe was super simple and tasted great! My husband's mom makes tortillas regularly and my husband said they tasted like hers.  I need to make them a little thinner next time because they came out a little thick, other than that super yummy!

I've tried making tortillas a couple of times, now. This recipe was better than the last one (which some described as pie crust pancakes), but these were still a bit to stiff

These were incredibly thick. I kept cutting it and then rolling it out again and it kept popping back. Even my tortilla press was of little use. Despite the fact that they were a lot thicker and had a small diameter, the taste was good.

Made this last night and they turned out great. My menu was fajitas with all the fixings and wanted to attempt homemade tortillas. Boyfriend loves fajitas and was so impressed that I don't think I could ever go back to store bought. Fresh is always best! **Will admit that rolling out the dough was tough and I had to request his assistance for the last ones. I made 8 perfectly shaped tortillas and 2 oddly shaped testers. Thanks for the recipe.

These were very good - I used half whole wheat flour.  However, I think tortillas are just one of those things that are easier to buy.

We had middle school girls in our after-school program make these, and they came out really really good!  I think they had a little trouble pressing them the right amount (they were thick), but a tortilla press would've been really helpful for that...  The flavor was really good!

I just want to know how to keep the tortillas soft.  The recipe worked ok, I guess, but they got too crisp too fast, and broke when we tried to eat them. I put them in a plastic bag as they came off the griddle, with a damp tea towel inside the bag, and that didn't work.  Help?  Any suggestions?

Just made 'em for the first time ever. I think they might have turned out just fine. Used no baking powder, hot water and extra shortening. :)

Wow!  I just made this and they turned out great.  They taste better than the ones from the grocery.  I too added more shortening, and I found it easier to roll all the dough out and use a bowl to cut perfect circles out.  Then, to get them thin enough, I rolled each circle out until I could see the grain of my rolling surface through the dough.  Perfect!

This is a good recipe but I only had real success with it when I  let the dough rest for about 3 hours. That was the only way these tortillas went  puffy with brown spots.  And you definitely need to use hot water.

Never made tortillas before, so had no basis for comparison. Made this in my food processor so handling hot boiling water was not a problem.. had to add more water though. Rolling out thinly was also not a problem, however, being the novice that I am, getting the round shape was. Tasty and easy. Thank you for posting.

I had a hard time for some reason getting them to be a perfect round, but other than that they were pretty easy to make, and were very tasty! I'll try again using a bowl to cut them. Thanks for the recipe!
