Wow, this recipe was quite a task. I have always focused on American style breads with a quick rise, because of the bit of sugar, or just a shorter yeast development. I started the "poolish" in the refridgerator the night before in a bowl covered with a wet towel for the full 15 hours. I brought it to room temp. still covered for about 3 hours the next day. I had thought about using the Kitchen-Aid mixer, but I am glad I didn't because I got a good idea for how the dough was supposed to look and feel. I shaped one of the loaves as suggested and used a well floured coil bread basket mold for the other one. I thought the bread turned out very well in taste and appearance. I did have to bake it though for 40 minutes. When I sliced it, it had a soft center and crunchy crust and bottom from the corn meal. It was absolutely delicious! I have developed a new found appreciation for "artisan" style breads from this recipe. I just wonder what novel the bread recipe came from now?

Great recipe!  Thanks violet!  I've made several breads before that have used a sponge starter, but this is the best (and easiest) I've tried so far.  This will be my go to recipe for french bread.   I think using whole wheat flour for the sponge added a lot in flavor.  I had to add about 1/2-1 cup more flour to prevent sticking.  I added another 1/2 tsp salt because of this.  I was also in a hurry so I shaped the bread after kneading and then baked after the loaves had proofed.  About 5 minutes before they were done, I brushed the loaves with olive oil (since we like a more chewy than crunchy crust).  Even though it did not have the additional rise, the flavor of the bread was still well developed, had an excellent crumb, and wonderful chewy crust.  I made 3 loaves instead of 2 so that they would fit on my pan.  A trick for great crusty bread, make steam in your oven.  Before preheating the oven, place a metal pie plate or other type of pan on the bottom rack.  After the oven is preheated and you've put the loaves in, pour about 1/2 cup of water into the preheated pan and quickly close the oven, do this again about 10-15 minutes later.

The quantity of warm water shown in the Ingredients for the poolish (1/2 cup)  disagrees with the amount listed in Directions (3/4 cup). To achieve a "thick batter" I opted for the 3/4 cup of warm water. Right or wrong the end result was two very toothsome loaves of bread.

Amazing bread!  Perfectly spongey chewy texture.  Love love love.
After reading others' reviews, and having taken some official college baking courses, here are my tips:
You can simplify the shaping and raising steps.  When shaping your loaves, flatten out your ball gently.  Then roll up from the bottom, tight like a sleeping bag, squeezing out any bubbles as you go.  Pull the ends even as you go, too, so it rolls like a jelly roll, not a croissant.  Pinch the seam tightly..  Also, you don't need a baking cloth.  At step 6 just place your loaves on your baking sheet and let them rise there.  No need for an awkward transfer.
For a tougher chewier crust, brush it lightly with water before baking and a few times during.  Also, you could place an oven-safe pan of boiling water in your oven to create steam, or carefully flick or spray water onto the hot pan during baking, creating steam.

I love this bread.  The poolish makes all the difference  in getting a more aromatic, fermented flavor that you find in french loaves from the better bread bakeries.  I make the poolish just before I go to bed the night before I wan't to make bread.  I just cover it with plastic wrap and leave it on the kitchen counter until I need it.  It's quick and easy.   . I occasionally use just a few drops of wine vinegar in the remaining water for finishing the dough, no more than 1/8 tsp, to give the bread a touch of sour dough flavor.  When I do that, I add a tsp of honey or brown sugar to proof the yeast.  It's not enough to add sweetness, it's just for proofing and both maybe add a little something-something to the flavor, nothing you can really put your finger on, though!  Either way, this is the best recipe for a simply made french bread I've seen here so far.

Violet - Thank you so much for posting your recipe. This bread is exactly what I have been trying to achieve - great sour taste (but not too sour) and excellent chew. It bakes very large loaves so other bakers might want to try making 3 baguettes rather than 2. I made the recipe with the poolish ingredients as written 1/2 cup of water to 3/4 cup of wheat flour.

This was my first time making a poolish and an artisan-type bread.  I loved the chewy-crisp crust and the texture of the bread.  I didn't see the reasoning behind doing the second rise (step 6) on a floured cloth and then transferring to the baking sheet later, so I just did the last rise on a lightly olive oiled baking sheet.  The damp cloth stuck a little to the top of my generously floured loaf, so it deflated a little bit even though I tried to gently remove it.  Another reviewer had this same problem and I think it would be worse to try to do the last rise on the floured cloth and try to move it without collapsing the bread a little right before you intend to bake it.  I look forward to practicing a little more with this recipe.

Excellent! I will continue to make this again and again. Light, airy inside, perfectly crunchy outside; it's my go-to dough. I don't do any of the 'resting' times, because I think they're a waste of time. It makes a big batch, and I can get 6-8 small loaves out of it (I store the extras in the fridge in plastic, and provided they don't mold, they only get better with age.) This is also what I use for homemade pizza crust, and it is the BEST! If I want to be healthier, I make it with half whole wheat flour, and it's still delicious, though it isn't as light and airy, and it has a slightly bitter taste to it, we love it still. Also makes great bagels!

This is my favorite kind of bread: just flour, yeast, water, and salt. The staff must’ve fixed the instructions the previous reviewer mentioned; even so, I used ¾ cup water because I like a thinner poolish. I mixed the dough in my Kitchenaid for at least 15 minutes; it’s a very loose dough. Somewhere, I have a baguette pan, but couldn’t find it when I was ready to shape the loaves. So, I had some shaping disasters. One loaf was too long for my baking stone, so the ends fell off and hit the oven rack; the other loaf wasn’t floured well enough and kind of stuck to my towel, so it had some puckering on the surface. (Hence, no pretty pictures!) The taste is very good, though.

This recipe makes two gorgeous country breads with great flavor and chew.  It does take some time but it is so worth the wait.   I followed the recipe exactly including the manual kneading which can be a workout.   Although I refrigerated the sponge overnight, next time I will develop the sponge even longer to develop more flavor.

This bread is fantastic! It took me longer to make - about 7 hours, even with the minimum rising/waiting times.  It was only the second time I've ever made bread, though, and so I'm a bit of a slow kneader.  I would definitely recommend it - my family ate both loaves within a day and a half, and my grandmother begged me to make her more.  I'm making it again this week!!

Although these loaves are quite labor-intensive, they are soooo worth it!!  My husband absolutely ???LOVES??? it, saying they look like the loaves people pay $5 for from the bakery section :)  Mine turned out to be a bit free-form since there was no way to "gently transfer the risen loaves to a baking sheet" without them stretching, but I just patted them back into shape and went with it!  Thanks for sharing this...I'll definitely be making this bread again!

These came out perfect on the first try! 

I don't know for sure if this made a difference, but I followed another reader's advice and put a pan of water in the bottom of the oven. 

I also took another reader's advice and divided the dough into three portions so they would fit into my baking pans.   
As a result, the loaves only took about 20 minutes but were beautifully crusty and had a nice texture.
(Too bad my camera wasn't working; I would have loved to submit a photo!)
My 11 year old son and his friend polished off an entire loaf almost immediately after they came out of the oven. 
This recipe will definitely be used again!

thank you so much for sharing this. It is comparatively easy for a french bread, very flavorful, and just turned out perfect. this is going in my treasure box. I made it for our harvest festival and it was a huge success.

Great recipe. I've used this about 5 times now and I've been successful every time. I've lately tweaked the recipe a little, substituting 4 egg whites (beaten) for 1/2 cup of the water, and this seems to give the bread a little more strength and flavor.

I gave this recipe five stars because the texture of the inside and outside is wonderful. The flavor is a little flat though. Some of the other reviewers suggested adding honey--I think that would improve the taste.

I've been searching for a good traditional-style French country bread recipe for a long time and have always ended up disappointed. Many are too sweet or too flavourless or take too long to prepare, and almost all end up having a crumb that is far too much like soft white American-style bread with nothing of the airy, chewey, je ne sais quoi texture of "real" French bread. But with this recipe, finally, I think I've found a winner!

I halved the recipe because I only wanted to make one boule, and I also mixed in a dollop of natural yogurt with the poolish sponge to inoculate it with some lactobacillus so the end result would have a slightly sourdough-like flavour. I also left it way too late to start on the recipe so I ended up having to let the dough, rather than the poolish, prove overnight in the fridge at step 4. I dusted with a mix of flour and wheat germ, and I also cooked the boule on a pizza-stone with a small dish of water on the oven's bottom shelf to help give it a nice crunchy crust. Turned out great!

This is a great recipe. If you plan ahead & make your sponge before you go to bed, you can have a fairly quickly made bread the next day. I got up at 5, mixed the rest of the flour & ingredients and went back to bed. When I get up at 8, it was ready to be formed into loaves to rise for the last time. I had hot, fresh bread for Sunday lunch.

Definitely worth the wait.  I used whole wheat flour and it was amazing!  I couldn't wait to get home from work today and eat some more.  I'll definitely be making this again and again.

If I could give this recipe another 5 stars I would. I've not baked bread in 20 years. For whatever reason I was in the mood one day.  I found this recipe and became a baking star with my hubby. Each time I bake it my skills improve!  Love it!

I LOVE this recipe. It is the best crispy, toasty bread recipe I've ever found. It makes excellent crunchy toast, which is excellent for bruschetta. It is so tasty that when I made it for my parents, my Dad began requesting it instead of my Mom's home recipes! Ouch, sorry Mom! This bread does take some time, so you really do have to dedicate a Saturday or Sunday to it. To save time, and washing up, I don't follow all of the directions.  I use only one bowl from start to finish (including poolish), and don't half it until I form the actual baguettes. I also use canola oil and saran wrap instead of the wet cloths at the final rising stage (works like a charm). Hope these tips help, folks!

The recipe turned out very nicely.  The instructions though left me guessing in a few places, particularly the part about putting flour on a towel and making seams in the bread.  But, what I got in the end was quite tasty!  Also, I would add the salt earlier next time.  In spite of kneading quite a bit, I ended up with some salty spots.

This is a pretty good french bread recipe, however to get a nice crust like the picture you have to cook it at a very high temperature. What I did was after I formed the loaf shapes, i left it overnight in the fridge, covered with an oiled sheet of plastic wrap, and then in the morning, I preheated the oven to 425 F and  put a pan of water in the bottom. Next I sprayed the first loaf with a bit of water, which is also important for getting a good crust, and put it in the oven for 15 minutes, and sprayed it with water after 10 minutes. After that I cranked up the temperature to 525 F and sprayed the loaf every 5 minutes, until the crust was a nice golden brown. After that I cooked the second loaf the same way.

This has become my standard bread. I make a batch every week. I use a variety of different amendments such as: substituting 2 cups of whole wheat flour, or rye flour, adding wheat grains that have been pre-soaked in hot water,  or even a hodge-podge of seeds (pumpkin, buckwheat, sunflour, etc.). It's very versatile. I make mine into small sandwich rolls using about 100g of dough. It will make about a dozen and they are they perfect size for sandwiches.

I made this bread twice, and the 2nd time was received to more acclaim. I added a teaspoon of local honey and a dash of olive oil to the poolish. Makes a difference.

Works every time,  Made this a dozen times. I have also aged the pool-ish for an extra day. Changed the flavor a little bit but nothing extraordinary.. I use my kitchen aid dough hook and it still looks like bakery bread. When I'm out of cornmeal I use oats on my pizza stone. I've also done this in loaf pans to make a taller loaf, I love it comes out great.

Very heavy bread. Very labor intensive too.  Lots of kneading, rising, kneading, rising....all for a heavy bread with not much flavor at all.

This bread is simply amazing!  It is a labor of love, that is for sure, but it is not difficult, just time consuming.  But, if you read the recipe thoroughly before you begin, and you know what you are getting yourself into, you can plan accordingly.  I kneaded this by hand, and feel like I got a pretty good workout haha!  If you do it this way, I highly suggest you set your kitchen timer, as it takes quite a bit longer than your brain will guesstimate! I think this bread is well worth the time and effort- it is just about the perfect bread :)  Thanks for a great recipe violet!

This is the first bread that I've made that turned out successfully and I think its because the steps were laid out very comprehensively. Its actually NOT a lot of work, considering you can mix the poolish the night before you make the loafs as well as NOT that many ingredients. The hardest part was mixing the 6 cups of unbleached flour in -I swear if I get arthritis in 50 years it'll be because of this bread. but its worth it! Fresh out of the oven, the smell is heavenly and the crackling sound it makes when you first cut into it is divine. My husband said it was restaurant quality good. I served it beside Daube de boeuf provencal, and it soaked up the stews juices really well. If I could get my hands on a whole wheat version -then it would just be too good to be true.

Love it. I've made this 4 times now. I add extra wheat, by way of  wheat germ, I double the Kosher Salt, and a bit extra yeast. Also, I add a Tbsp. of brown sugar to the sponge, and leave it at room temp for 15 hours. This time I'm going to bake it as a round loaf on a stone. We'll see!

Thank you for this recipe, I just love it...I kept  step by step the recipe and outcome is just perfect. I'm from Europe so I can say it tastes somewhere between Focaccia and french country bread.  I'm going to use it more often.

This is exactly what I was looking for! Just like the artisan "pane"  bread I buy in the store. Great on its own or for sandwiches and paninis. For the quantity the recipe calls for I about broke my kitchenaid mixer so will do completely by hand next time.  I followed the recipe in transferring and flipping the bread before baking and definitely deflated the bread a little, don't think that's necessary so will skip next time.  Besides the kneading not that much more time then most breads, this is my go to recipe now!

This is a great recipe. I'm use to making Pan Cubano, which is a lot less work, but still uses a sponge. This is my new favorite bread to make though. My family gobbled up both loaves in a few days the first time I made it! My family keeps saying how good it is, and I had to make it again because my girlfriend wants to try it, which is why I'm rating your recipe at 5 in the morning!

I halved the recipe to make just one loaf and now I wish I had made two.  I used white WW in my poolish, which I ended up fermenting for about 30 hours due to circumstances.  I just added a little more water and flour (about 1/8 cup each) when I realized I couldn't use it until the 2nd day.  It just gave that much more flavor to the bread.  The proportions are spot on and the dough is a pleasure to work with.  Thanks, violet!

alothough time consuming, this bread is GREAT, my daughter loves this type of bread for sandwiches, made into "sandwich size" loaves, wonderful, and should last for several weeks, froze them in "week size" freezer bags......worth the effort.

Turned out good, not as brown on the crust as I would have liked, but that is operator error. I also used a steam method to get a crunchy crust. I let the sponge ferment for 18 hours or so in the refrigerator and it turned out well.

If you have never had good results with baking bread (as I have not), this is probably not the recipe to turn that around for you. Not sure where I went wrong in this process because the instructions do seem well-written. It's probably my technique and if you are already good at baking bread, you might like this.

Would give it five stars for the process but I'm giving it only 4.
After adding all of the flour (weighed), the dough was very wet
and the time and temperature seem off.  Will make again but change a few things next time.

AWESOME!!!  Will absolutely make again in the future.  I might do as another reviewer suggested and add a dollop of plain yogurt to make it a bit more "sourdough-ish".   This will be added to my Thanksgiving menu, for sure!

I made a double batch. I froze 1/2 after step 1 (not made yet). The loaves that I did make, were beautiful & huge!  I wasn't expecting them to come out as well as it did because I skimped on each of the rising times AND I didn't have any whole wheat flour (subbed all purpose flour). Beautiful loaves. I did have to bake the loaves about  40 minutes. The insides were very good but not as flakey as I had hoped, probably due to skimping on rise times and subbing AP flour.

This turned out great! I will definitely be using this recipe repeatedly! I chose to let the sponge sit at room temp overnight. I should have been a bit more careful measuring water in the next stage, since I added too much I wound up having to add nearly 2 extra cups of flour to get proper consistency. Despite this rookie error, the recipe turned out well. The one thing I might do differently next time would be to add just a tad more salt.

These kinds of breads are the only kind I make, nothing can take their place, you might want to invest in a pizza paddle and with parchment paper its an easy slide into the oven.

Nice bread, crusty outside, very nice sponge inside. I have never made a poolish before but it made the difference. I followed the instruction up to the rise process where the dough is wrapped in a towel, my timing was off, fell asleep and everything sat until 7 am but it turned out well. I have made this two times and both times it turned out great. Thanks !

First time bread maker here and it was a breeze.  It was time consuming but well worth the effort.  My family loves it, I love it and my friends love it! Have shared this recipe numerous times already.

Definitely a labor of love here, but the results are worth the effort.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, and I had fabulous bread as a result. I won't lie, this is a lot of work and time, but it is also a little Zen. You labor, follow the steps, set your mind free to wander.  I had fun, but it isn't a recipe I will make every week. But I definitely will make it again and again.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Fantastic bread!  The minute I bit into it I was in heaven. Yes it's a long process that should probably be planned into your day, but the end result is worth every minute. I have a bread machine, so this is the first bread I've made by hand in a long time and it was very satisfying. The crust is just crunchy enough and the crumb really did remind of the bread I tasted in France.  I've now made it for a second time and this time I'm sharing with extended family. Can't wait to see their reaction, LOL

This was the first bread I've made with a poolish. I had been intimidated by the idea of making slow-rise yeasted bread by hand, and I thought I'd need a better-equipped kitchen to make French bread that looks and tastes as good as what comes from the bakery. Fortunately, I was wrong! This bread came out airy with a satisfyingly crunchy crust. I tossed half a cup of cold water onto the bottom of my electric oven when I put the loaves in--I've read that steam is essential to a good thick crust. I ended up letting the poolish mature in the refrigerator for about 20 hours and return to room temperature next to the burners I was cooking with. The result was a well-developed yeasty, fermented flavor. What book is this recipe from??

The time is worth it, and using actual bread flour helps as well! IT stinks up the house real pretty and makes a delicious bread.

I love this recipe easy and really moist inside with a crusty crust the only thing I did different is a egg and water wash on the crust so it would brown up nice and golden other then that it is awesome
