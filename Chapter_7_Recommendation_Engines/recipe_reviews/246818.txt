I made this pound cake in a bundt pan.  Took just under an hour set at 325. I only added a cup of white sugar and would increase to 1.5 cups (no sweeteners) next time. I also used the same amount of vanilla and almond extract 1.5tsp). A versatile moist cake - eat as is or add a fruit or lemon glaze, or dust with powdered sugar.

I used all white sugar, no Splenda.  It was really good and my family liked it.
The cooking directions were a bit weird, since there was no change in temperature and no instructions to cover the cake after the initial time.  I cooked mine for 50 minutes and it was just fine.

8.10.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/246818/better-than-starbucks-blueberry-pound-cake/ ... I haven't had or even seen this at Starbucks.  Mine doesn't look like the photo or taste like pound cake.  It's good, but not pound cake; too buttery & light.  The photos look like cake..  Strange.  'Only change was reducing sugar to 1 1/3c & regular ole salt to 1t.  Oh, I used 2c fresh berries; half margarine, half butter.  That shouldn't be a big deal.  Mystery!  I baked at 350 for 20 minutes & 325 for 25.  It's so moist it'll need to be eaten quickly or refrigerated.  A firm when set lemon drizzle on top would be nice for looks.  S liked.

didnt use splenda and increased white sugar to 1 and 1/4 cups. I also eyeballed the blueberries. Yummy, more like a crumb cake but the bomb!
