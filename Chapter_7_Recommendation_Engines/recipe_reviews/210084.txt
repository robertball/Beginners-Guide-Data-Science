This really is the best recipe for home made chocolate syrup. I’m sure it’ll taste richer with milk vs. water (save heavy cream for fudge sauce). To refill a Hershey’s bottle, scale up recipe to 24 servings=1½ pint=3 cups=24oz.

REVIEW SUMMARY:
TOO THIN?
Be patient. It only thickens after it’s chilled.

IN A HURRY?
For immediate use, thicken with one of the following:
1) (as suggested already) heat sugar with water until sugar dissolves, then add cocoa, or
2) reduce water from 1½ to just 1 cup, 
3) for each 1 cup of syrup, mix cocoa with:
(a) 1 tbs cornstarch or (b) 1 tsp unflavored gelatin or (c) ½ tsp xanthan gum (that’s what’s in the original Hershey’s syrup). if using (a) let boil for 1 more minute or it won’t thicken.

TO MAKE SUGAR FREE
substitute ¾ c agave nectar for each 1c sugar and reduce recipe liquid by 1/3c.

TO EXTEND SHELF LIFE, add ½ tsp citric acid to each 1 cup syrup and stir well.

I made this pretty much out of frustration because my favorite sugar free chocolate syrup is almost four bucks a bottle. I read through some of the reviews on what worked for others and rolled with it. I used Splenda sugar substitute. I did see that this didn't thicken as others had mentioned but I divided it into Ball jars and let it sit in the fridge overnight and when I checked on it this morning, it was fine. And better than the bottled kind even. I did think it was a bit sweet so I might cut back on the Splenda for next time and maybe use a fat free condensed milk to make it a little richer but I'm pretty impressed with the recipe as is. Thanks for sharing and saving me almost three bucks!

This was an excellent recipe.  However, my syrup never began to thicken.  I probably should have combined the cocoa powder and sugar together first prior to placing it in water.  So, I added a tiny bit of water to 1.5 tablespoons of cornstarch to dissolve the cornstarch and poured it in.  Let it boil lightly for about a minute and then removed it from the heat and added the vanilla.  Perfect consistency.

This recipe was very easy to follow and took no time at all. Since my husband doesn't like chocolate, I replaced the cocoa powder and sugar with lentils and carrots. I also took out the vanilla extract and instead added some celery, garlic and vinegar. It was the best chocolate syrup my husband ever tasted, will try again.

This is fantastic!  It's a hot day today, in southern California. And what do you know? I'm craving some chocolate milk--problem was, I didn't have any syrup. So I open up google and type in "chocolate syrup recipe". And this came up. :P  I scaled it down to fit 4 servings, as opposed to the original 16. I read the reviews, and saw how people had trouble with thickening it. I knew that boiling equal parts sugar and water creates a simple syrup, so I boiled the water and sugar until the sugar was completely dissolved. THEN, I added in the cocoa powder (Hershey's brand). Once that was completely dissolved, it began to thicken very nicely. Then proceed to put in that dash of salt, mix, then add the vanilla.  Mine was a little bit too thick, but was perfect since it mixed well with the cold milk. Tiny, itty bitty chunks of the chocolate mix settled at the bottom.  This recipe is absolutely superb.

After finding out that Hershey's syrup has high fructose corn syrup in it, I knew I would never buy it again. This is a delicious recipe for a very similar type chocolate syrup. My husband and son are very happy with it!

I made this simply because I rarely use chocolate syrup (in fact, I don't think I've EVER bought a jar myself) and I needed it for a recipe.  I wanted to be able to make a smaller portion and not have that jar going to waste.  (I scaled it down.)  What I did like about it was that it seemed to have more of the dark chocolate taste instead of being so sweet.  However, I don't know what effect that had on the recipe I was trying to make.  (I used the rest up on ice cream.)  And it never thickened.  Cook time, 5 minutes?  I stood there and stood there and stood there, stirring and stirring.  It never really did a thing.  I didn't want to end up with burnt chocolate flavor so I just gave up and took it off the stove.  Tossed it in the fridge to use the next day and that's when it thickened up.  Would've saved a lot of time (and my feet and arm) had I not tried getting it to thicken on the stove like it was supposed to.

This is GREAT! My husband is a Hershey's snob. He refuses to use any other syrup except Hershey's on his ice cream. When he tasted this, he was amazed. He now loves this and even went and bought a special squeeze bottle to pour and store each batch! I love being able to control the sugar, too.

Technology has made me lazy, so I didn't cook this on the stove. I whisked all the ingredients together in a 4-cup Pyrex bowl, microwaved it for about 3 minutes, whisked again, microwaved for another two minutes, and took it out and whisked again.

The end product was thin just as everybody else said. But when I poured it into bottles, the leftover liquid in the Pyrex bowl cooled off and thickened up just fine.

The only drawback to this recipe was that it made me feel like an idiot for buying Hershey's for $3...and Torani for$6.

I do not like the 'commercial' syrup as to me it leaves a strong aftertaste. I loved this one. I made a double batch and gave a jar to my neighbors to enjoy. The double batch filled up about 2 jam jars.

This tastes exactly like "Hersheys Syrup." I can not believe I ever purchased it when I had the ingredients in my cubard and it takes about 5 minutes to make! It is a little less thick than the stuff in a bottle, but it also isn't made with corn syrup and the vanilla gave it that nice home made touch. I made 1/3 of it to try out the recipe and was able to cook it in a little pot. When cooled I poured it into an empty maple syrup bottle. I plan to use like the store bought syrup for  chocolate milk or ice-cream. Thanks, Zen K.!

I have never even been a fan of Hershey's chocolate syrup.  This syrup is freakin' amazing though!  I like to pour it in my coffee, add some half and half, mix it up, and top it all off with whipped cream.  Or, sometimes, I just take the jar of chocolate syrup out of the fridge and take a big spoonful to get my chocolate fix.

Even after adding 1 1/2 tsp of Cornstarch, this was still really thin. Next time I may reduce sugar by half, and use sweetened condensed milk instead.

Yum! I whisked the sugar, cocoa and salt together before adding the water, and I cooked over a slightly higher heat (more like medium) and let it come just to a boil. As it cooled slightly it was the exact same consistency as Hershey's Syrup, but it has the deep, dark chocolatey flavor as their Special Dark Syrup in the can, though not quite as thick as that.  I think I could have used less cocoa, maybe 3/4 cup, as my daughter commented after her first taste of it (straight up) that it was "too chocolatey", meaning it had more of a dark chocolate taste - I love that, she'd rather have it less intense.  In chocolate milk, though, it's perfect!

i admit to being a choco-holic.. that said, i'm picky about how chocolate "anything" tastes.  I'm trying to teach my children about preservatives being so bad and that we are now making as much as we can at home.   my children and myself are in love with this chocolate syrup!  it's great on everything and i'm thankful for finding this recipe.  this time, i made a double recipe, so i can share it with friends.  I'll never buy store bought chocolate syrup again as this is so so so much better!**updating***  i have found that using powdered sugar  makes this much thicker.  try it, you might also like it.  :)

This is absolutely delicious! I followed others' suggestions to reduce water to 1 cup and incorporate sugar and water first, bring to simmer and then reduce a bit, whisking in the cocoa powder, salt and finally vanilla. I ALSO added cinnamon since I am serving at a Tex Mex themed dinner and wanted that special something. Put in the freezer for about 1 hour to flash chill, and it thickened right up. Will never buy Hershey's syrup again...so easy and good!

Excellent!  For all those complaining it didn't thicken up - this is chocolate SYRUP not fudge sauce.  I've been looking for a syrup recipe and this is perfect - not a big fan of fudge sauce - always too thick!  After refrigerating overnight - the syrup had the PERFECT thickness to it - thanks!

This is my favorite chocolate syrup recipe ever! So much better than any store bought chocolate syrup. The only thing I do different is I bring it to a boil and boil it for a minute or so. Don't worry about it not being thick enough after you cook it, after it cools in the fridge it is perfect. I love using this syrup in chocolate malts....yum! Thanks for the great and easy recipe!!!

I normally have a very strict rule about NOT reviewing a recipe unless I make it EXACTLY as the author wrote it (a real pet-peeve of mine!)...but, I'm making an exception this time, and here's why:  I *almost* didn't try this recipe because of several revews claiming that it doesn't "thicken." But, I was desperately in need of some chocolate syrup, so I made a half-batch (just in case it didn't go well!), and afterward I decided that I MUST write a review because it would've been a shame to have NOT satisfied my chocolate craving because of misleading reviews!
Here's what I did that differs from the original instructions:  1) I only made a HALF batch, and 2) Per other reviewers' suggestion, I mixed the water and sugar together, heated until the sugar was completely dissolved, THEN added the cocoa powder and salt (and vanilla at the end).  
I don't know if the sugar-and-water-together part is what makes the thickening-difference, but after I added the cocoa powder (which was a GENERIC brand, by the way), and the mixture started simmering, it seemed to have thickened enough that I was satisfied, so I stopped there. I'm not EXACTLY sure how long that took, but it was not more than 5-7 minutes.  
This mixture DOES thicken slightly more after a good while in the refrigerator but is still "pourable" (like Hershey's syrup), even after a night in the fridge. I also did not find this to be too bitter. NOTE: if you're looking for FUDGE sauce, that is a DIFFERENT recipe altogether. :)

Very good!  A lot of people suggest using corn syrup in place of some of the sugar to help chocolate sauce thicken - I suggest using agave nectar as a better alternative.  I just made this using 1/2 c. granulated sugar and the rest agave.  I added only about 1 T. water and I forgot the salt (although I would have added it had I remembered).  This turned out wonderfully thick and much closer to the actual store bought syrup, but not loaded with all the extra stuff they put in there.  Next time I will try eliminating all sugar and using only agave.  I have no doubts that it will work even better!  (Note: agave is sweeter than sugar so either increase the amount of cocoa powder or reduce the amount of agave to compensate).

1st let me say that I absolutely LOVE chocolate, and typically stay away from chocolate syrup because it just lacks true chocolate flavor. BUT I needed some for a recipe, found this one and whipped it up in about 20 mins (cooked longer to get it thicker)- this stuff is AWESOME! The flavor is great because I was able to use high quality cocoa, double strength vanilla, and pure cane sugar. I will definitely be making this again! This is not the syrup you buy in the store, it's much much better!

Easy and delicious, although mine tasted more like hot fudge sauce than Hershey's chocolate syrup - perhaps due to my cocoa powder (gourmet).  Only complaint is that we were unable to use it to flavor chocolate milk - it never ended up tasting chocolately no matter how much we added.  But as a sauce topping ice cream, brownies, whatever, it is amazing and definitely preferable to store bought.

Excellant! after reading the reviews I decided to reduce the water to 1 cup and also added a scant tablespoon of cornstartch. Mixed the dry ingredients together well then slowly added the water whisking till smooth then I heated it to a low boil, reduced the heat to a simmer and continued to cook it for about 5 minutes all the while stiring till the back of a spoon coated well. Cooled and when refridgerated it thickend to a perfect consistency. Remember this is syrup not fudge sauce. I added chocolate extract instead of vanilla and the flavor of this syrup is deep and rich with chocolate. So much better than commercial chocolate syrup which I will never buy again.

I mixed all dry ingredients together along with two tablespoons of cornstarch (I used 1/4 tsp of salt). Let it come up to a simmer to thicken, took it off the stove and stirred in the vanilla. Delicious...Hershys who?

This recipe is EXCELLENT! For those of you who can't get this to thicken up, I found a very easy way to get it to thicken up just like Hershey's Syrup from the store!  Simply reduce the water from 1 1/2 cup to just 1 cup.  Refrigerate overnight, and it is beautifully thick!!!

This syrup is delicious! I love being able to control the sweetness; I used a mixture of stevia and agave nectar for a naturally low-cal syrup.

using brown sugar makes the syrup much thicker, richer and sweeter as well. Especially if you mix the sugar and water first, let the sugar dissolve halfway and then add the cocoa powder.

My family loved this chocolate sauce! My 5 year old even said it's better than Hershey's. They all love chocolate milk, but after reading the 2" long ingredient list in the name brand stuff, I was compelled to find my own recipe. Mine started off thin, after letting it sit and cool before putting it in a bottle, it came out exactly like Hershey's. Let it cool before saying it's too thin! :)

This is a good recipe but the ratio of sugar to water is wrong. When making a simple syrup the water should be half the amount of the sugar. In this case only 3/4 cups of water. Also, if you add 2 tbs. of corn syrup this will help it thicken after it is cooled in the refrigerator. And the cocoa powder and salt should only be added after the sugar and water has boiled. Then add the cocoa powder and salt, bring to a lite quick boil and then add the vanilla. After adding the vanilla, take off the heat as soon as it starts to reboil.

I have always enjoyed making my own chocolate syrup, as it's so much cheaper than buying even a generic brand! I do like to keep mine in the store bottle though, as it makes it less messy to use (and looks so much nicer in the fridge).  While I was making it, I had a hard time getting it to thicken. I eventually gave up after 40 minutes and just poured it into the bottle and stuck it in the fridge, hoping for the best. It didn't get as thick as syrup normally does, though it did get thicker than the liquid it had been.  I know I'll give it another shot to see if it might have been my stove being wonky again (it's been known to do that!) but the flavour was spot on, despite the runny texture. Since I use it for drinks and shakes anyways, it wasn't as much of an issue as if using it for other purposes.

I tried this recipe on New Year's Eve last minute to go along with the Flourless Chocolate Cake II Recipe. The sauce is wonderful, everyone loved it and I have been using it to drown my ice cream in. I am a real chocoholic and this sauce is just perfect. I followed the recipe exactly and it thickened just like it said, it just takes some time of continous whisking / stirring (10 mins). Highly recommend this sauce. It is so easy to make. Thank you!

I made this the first time using 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup Splenda; it was excellent both on ice cream and in warm milk.  Then I tried all Splenda; my mother actually prefers that version in her warm milk, although on ice cream it hardens to chocolate pieces.  I refrigerate the syrup, so the Splenda version thickened as much as the sugar version.  My brother has already asked for the recipe.

I love this recipe!  It's so easy, although it does take forever to boil on low heat - I eventually turned the heat up to medium.  It is rather thin when warm, but when refrigerated it's a bit thicker (still not as thick as a hot fudge sauce, though).  I made this to use in my chocolate intrigue cake, and used the leftovers to top vanilla ice cream.  So much better than Hershey's syrup (which I had to boycott, since it now contains high fructose corn syrup).

It never got to a syrupy state even after i added tablespoons of cornstarch. It did taste good and it serves its purpose however, so 3 stars is adequate I believe.

Excellent taste as written!  The only issue I had was that it took much longer than 5 minutes -- probably 20 in my case to thicken up.  Consistency was perfect.

This syrup is so delicious.  We made chocolate milk, put it on our ice-cream and drizzled it on our chocolate waffles.  
I would have given it all five stars but the cooking time was way off.  I think next time I will follow the advice of someone that posted here and cooked the sugar and water first then added the chocolate.   
So long corn syrup Hershey's.

Every bit as good as Hershey's and cheaper - I buy cocoa in bulk so it's a great buy.  Great over icecream or in milk for hot chocolate or for any recipe calling for chocolate syrup. Note that It does not store as long as store bought.

I should have read the reviews first. (Note I have not completely finished this but my baby is waking)I can't get this to thicken!! I don't have cornstarch on hand so after about 30 minutes of wisking I decide to start adding things. I added flour which added thickness to the taste but not the syrup is still watery so I tried more sugar and nothing. Now I am just going to let it simmer while I tend to my baby and see what happens. If it turns out I'll post another comment saying so:) but definitely going to try something else next time

Love this!!I have made this multiple times. The key is to heat the sugar, water and salt until the mixture is clear. Then whisk in the cocoa powder. Bring it to a boil and continue to boil, whisking constantly for 5 minutes. I  also add a tsp of butter with the vanilla. Way better than the stuff you buy and cheaper!!! Thanks for a great recipe!!

This never seems to fully thicken, even in the fridge, but it tastes great anyway. I cut back the sugar a bit to get a darker flavor. Yum!

This was good, but I think in the future I will stick to recipes that require melted chocolate rather than powder. Even after dissolving and simmering, the syrup has a bit of a grainy texture. I was looking for something a little smoother and richer for use in mochas and other coffee drinks.

Mine turned out a bit runnier than the store-bought kind, but it still does the trick for making chocolate milk and for putting on ice cream!  Delicious!

I had a very fussy toddler on my hands who would not drink anything but "choco" milk and I had no syrup on hand.  I whipped up half a batch and amazed myself with how good this is.  I cooked it until it coated the spoon, stirring constantly, and removed from the heat when it started to smell cooked.  I reansferred it to a clean glass jar and allowed it to cool.  It was perfect for flavoring milk and I am thinking it may thicken up after a while in the fridge.  Thanks Zen K, this is great.

This was pretty good. It intensely dark chocolatey, so a little goes a long way. This recipe make a lot, so unless you use gobs of chocolate syrup on a regular basis, I'd suggest scaling down the recipe.

Great recipe! I ran out of chocolate syrup and wanted to make a coffee drink, this fit the bill! It makes a good amount too- i have 2 squirt bottles of it!  Mine is pretty thin though, it didn't thicken, but whatever, it's yummy!

MUCH better than commercial chocolate syrup, and no artificial ingredients like HFCS. It's delicious for chocolate milk or on ice cream. I used half "extra dark" cocoa and half regular, and added a half teaspoon of instant espresso powder.

So easy! Excellent, I used the simple syrup method from another user (heat the sugar and water until sugar dissolves, then add cocoa) worked great. I love that I can show my children what is in their food, and waste less plastic by buying the container in the grocery store. Thank you Zen K!

The quality of cocoa powder makes all the difference in this recipe.  I rated it 4 instead of 5 simply because the timing is off, I think.  I have had to simmer it for quite some time to get it to thicken properly.  Out of 4 batches, 2 thickened well... the other two were too thin; only good for chocolate milk, not for ice cream topping.

This was a good recipe, don't get me wrong.  But I do think the mixture needs to cook a bit longer after it begins to simmer & I am a huge dark chocolate fan, but this was a bit too cocoa-y for me.  Maybe i'm just fussy though because everyone else seems to love it:)  Thanks Zen K

I am so happy to have found this recipe.  My son loves chocolate milk, and I hate putting all of those artificial ingredients in his body.  Although, I would prefer he not drink chocolate milk at all, at least this is better than that.  Easily made with ingredients that I always have on hand.  Can't thank you enough!

A great recipe for homemade chocolate syrup. Like other reviewers, I had trouble getting it to thicken while cooking it on the stove. I found that removing it from heat and sticking it in a jar in the refrigerator helped a lot. Once it cooled it resembled Hershey's syrup both in taste and texture.

I'm not a fan of chocolate syrup, but my daughter likes to use it for chocolate milk.  When I ran out of it, I decided to give this recipe a try.  It was super fast, easy and inexpensive to make and my daughter loves it.

Awesome!  I made it with Splenda instead of sugar for my 6-year-old's chocolate milk.  It was a little thin with only Splenda so I'm thinking 1/4 cup sugar and 1 1/4 cups of Splenda would thicken it nicely.  Great recipe!

Very similar to the "real" thing you can buy at the grocery store. The consistency is perfect for anything you may want to use it and not overly sweet like the commercial stuff. Would definitely make it this again many more times as I may need it.

Great recipe! I did make one adjustment. I put the pot on medium heat and stirred constantly until it began to bubble. Then I followed the rest of the directions. It gets a little thicker as it cools, but this is the same consistency as Hershey syrup for chocolate milk so you don't want it very thick. My kids like it much more than store bought! It reminds me of the taste of Hershey syrup from when I was a child - before high fructose corn syrup became the main ingredient! Thanks for sharing this with us!

I love milk. I love chocolate. I love chocolate milk. I don't love having high fructose corn syrup and food dye #whatever unnecessarily in what I drink and eat. This homemade chocolate syrup tastes richer and better than any store bought kind. And I know exactly what is in it!

This chocolate syrup is great!  It was great on ice cream, cheesecake and in coffee!  It was very easy to make and costs much less than buying premade chocolate syrup in the store.  I boiled the sugar and water together for a while first and then added the rest of the ingredients and simmered for about a half hour. It was thin but thickened up to the consistency of store bought chocolate syrup after being in the refrigerator for a while.  I will never buy the store bought kind again!

I just made this, and I didn't know making chocolate syrup at home was so easy. I only used one cup of water. I also used half a cup of special dark cocoa powder and half a cup of regular cocoa powder. I let this come to a rapid boil while continually whisking, and I let it boil for approxomately 5-7 minutes. When it was finished it was thin, but I let it cool to room temperature then I refrigerated it. It is the perfect consistency and smooth texture.

A little thin, but served its purpose.  Was pleased to find a recipe using what I had on hand.

Oh man, so bad - yet so good! Sweet, but delish. I made it in the microwave & let it sit overnight in the fridge. It was the perfect consistency. I did use a bit less water  and a very good quality cocoa that I buy at mysagespice.com. Delish!!

I liked the syrup but it was a bit too bitter.  We tried it in milk and it was still too bitter for everyone in my family.  I added an extra 1/2 c of sugar and it was just right.

My husband brought home ice cream and I was desperately craving chocolate syrup, but we had none. I decided to whip this up real quick and I was pleasantly surprised. I only made 1/4 batch but it still made quite a bit. It's a little too dark chocolate for MY taste, but I will still probably make again (maybe i will try with milk chocolate chips instead of cocoa powder)

It had a nice flavor but unfortunately it never thickened up. I cooked it awhile on the stove but i didn't want to burn the chocolate. I read that other reviewers stated it thickened up overnight in the frigde. That didn't happen with mine. Oh well I think i'll try adding some cornstarch with the cocoa like another reviewer suggested.

This turned out good in the end, I had some trouble getting it thick enough to use right away so I added some corn starch which really helped.

You will never go back to the bottle! I cut the recipe in half and it worked very well. I kept it on a medium heat and would stir it ccasionally. Perhaps the one reviewer expected fudge-like consistency. It does thicken to a dangerously delicious consistency after it sits in the fridge. I always appreciate the reviews and this one was worth a few words.

I cut this recipe in half. I thought this was too strong of a cocoa flavor so I added about a half cup more sugar. The extra sugar tamed the flavor  of the chocolate much better. Then I took half the syrup and added about 1/2 cup peanut butter and it was quite tasty over ice cream. So now the only dilemma is whether to have the chocolate syrup or the peanut butter chocolate syrup both were good. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This was very good.  We added some milk chocolate chips to cut the cocoa powder flavor.  It didn't get quite as thick as I would have liked, but it was quick, easy, and saved a trip to the store.

Very good!  Kids loved it.  Works best if you have a nice squeeze bottle to put it in.  I accidentally added more vanilla than I cared for but it was still good.  I will make sure to add the right amount next time :)  Thank you for the recipe!

We LOVED this!!!! It is AMAZING!!! We tried it in cow milk and soy milk and it was wonderful! I have never really liked chocolate syrup from the store because to me it doesn't taste like actual chocolate but this stuff it great! Even hubby, how is a huge Hershey's Syrup fan, likes this, so it is a keeper!

We are trying to avoid high fructose corn syrup.  I made this as listed.  It is so quick and easy to make. Really came out great tasting.  It thickened up more in the refrigerator.  We really like this, and plan to keep making it.  Cheaper, better tasting than the commercial stuff, too.

First, let me say: I have made this exactly as written a number of times, and it is always 5-star worthy. It’s my go-to recipe! That said, I have a variation that I highly recommend. I wanted to make some today and realized too late I was almost out of cocoa powder. I was about 1/4 cup short, so I just went ahead with the recipe, then after removing it from the heat (I didn’t let it thicken completely), I added about a cup of dark chocolate chips to compensate for my lack of cocoa. OH MY STARS! I may make it this way intentionally from now on. AMAZING!!!

A good, easy basic chocolate sauce. I am sure this is the one my mum made when I was a kid. 
NOTE TO ETwinkprs
You took out the sugar and cocoa and used lentils and carrots instead and you took out the vanilla and used celery, garlic and vinegar. In other words, you made an entirely different recipe. I don't know what you call it but I, personally, would never call it chocolate anything. Not in my wildest imagination could I ever put that combo over ice cream.

Made this two times. I scanned the reviews and it looked good! First time I made it it was really runny... Tasted good though. The second time I made it the exact same thing happened. :( Followed the directions exactly both times. Will search for another recipe! :)

This is really good, and so easy to make. I let it simmer for a good 5 minutes, and that seemed to help the flavors blend together. It is pretty runny when it's hot, but it does thicken up after being refrigerated. Thanks for the recipe!!

This is a good syrup recipe!  If it's too thin for you try this:  Combine all the ingredients in the saucepan as stated and keep whisking constantly over medium-high heat for a long time.  The sauce will literally start to rise out of the saucepan.  Once that happens remove from heat and add vanilla extract.  You can also try almond extract, orange extract or peppermint extract for some interesting flavor variations.

This is amazing! It is darker than Hersheys, and I LOVE dark chocolate! One tiny thing I have to say, though, is that it tastes kind of like flour. Just a little. It might be the cocoa powder that I use. Still amazing!

I followed the recipe exactly and added a can of sweetened condensed milk. This made the recipe more "fudgie"! Loved it!

I just recently tried this recipe, and it turned out better than I could have imagined! I have two toddler boys who absolutely love chocolate milk, so this recipe is very useful. I already had all the ingredients needed so I made it the minute I found the recipe! I doubt I'll be purchasing any from the store anymore. My sons loved it  also so it's definatley a winner!

The sauce tastes good, I just had to add a tablespoon of cornstarch and bring it to a boil in order to achieve the right consistency. Without cornstarch, it is way too thin.

When my husband read the ingredients list on the side of a bottle of store-bought chocolate syrup, he was insulted when he discovered that there was nearly no cocoa or chocolate in it at all. That's when I went hunting and came upon this recipe. Pondering the ingredients, I went to my pantry and found some organic, tinned coconut milk in and thought I'd try that as a substitute for the water--and WOW! The fam was crazy about it! I'll never make this with water. If I'm out of coconut milk I'll use skim milk. Just that much more complexion to the taste.

Even good when we have used sucanat (the least processed raw sugar we know of).  The taste is modified a little by that, but I personally like that flavor change.  More than that, the added minerals help keep me from having to deal with increased auto-immune flare-ups (mine are relatively mild when I watch how much of this kind of thing I enjoy, especially when I avoid white sugar and white flour, corn and potatoes - at least for the most part.....).

Easy to make and tastes good.  Does not thicken on stove top.  I cooked mine for at least 15 minutes.  Boiled it more than once, nothing.  It cooled and thickened in the frig.  If you cool on counter and stir ever few minutes you can avoid the top skimming over.

Had a craving for Chocolate Milk, and was dismayed when the Hershey's Syrup bottle was dry.  Googled "Chocolate Syrup Recipe" and ran into this.  Had all ingredients except Vanilla.  Substituted Almond Extract instead.  OMG!  Best Chocolate Syrup EVER!!  Re-filled the Hershey bottle will do so many more times.  Ten stars!

This recipe worked very well for me. I simmered it over medium heat instead of low, but whisked it constantly. I used it warm initially, but found it to be even better and thicker after a day in the fridge.

We love this stuff!  We, also, are trying to get away from high fructose corn syrup and this recipe was perfect for us.  I followed the other suggestions and reduced the water by 1/4 to 1/2 a cup.  Thanks for the recipe!

I wasn't sure if we would like this, so I halved the recipe. Otherwise made it just as written. Excellent! I will probably never buy Hershey's syrup or NesQuik again. This will save a lot of money for for this chocolate milk-loving household. Haven't tried it on ice cream yet, but I'm sure it will be great on that as well. Not too sweet, either, which is a plus! Also, to me, this was the same consistency as regular chocolate syrup after cooking & cooling. It does take some boring stirring time before it actually gets to bubbling & thickening, but I expected that.

I've used this recipe several times now. I liked it from the start, but with experience, it turns out better each time.
The first time I used a very dark unsweetened cocoa powder. While I liked it, other's thought it to be too much, "dark." They also complained that it was too thin. So I used a regular unsweetened cocoa powder and while my critics liked the flavor better, they still preferred the canned stuff from the store. They thought this was still too runny, "...or something." 
Tonight was the fourth try. I boiled it over a low heat while stirring constantly (used "regular," unsweetened cocoa) for about 5 minutes or so. The sauce was started to thicken at about 3 or 3 1/2 minutes and I kept it going just a little longer from there. It turned out absolutely perfect to all. No more of the store bought for my house! (BTW, chocolate milk is what my household uses a chocolate syrup for.)
This recipe is terrific! Thank you so much.

I was having a chocolate fix but didn't want the fuss and bother of my usual recipe.  This was quick, easy, and took me all of 5 minutes from cabinet to ice cream (well, maybe 6 to 6 1/2 minutes).  Either way, it was delicious.  Thank you so much for recipe.

I used 2 cups Splenda, and may use more next time.  It definitely thickened up.  Also, you need to use more per serving to get the chocolatey taste - like 1/4 C syrup in milk. Still, this tastes better than ANY sugar-free chocolate syrup from the store.

Great recipe. Was able to convert it to a fudge sauce by decreasing the whole milk and adding a little over a tablespoon of salted butter. Simmered it for about 10 min.  Turned out to be a delicious thick hot fudge sauce without using cream. I love versatile recipes!

This recipe is good, only problem being that it didn't really thicken. I increased heat after a few minutes hoping it would thicken which it didn't, so i added a mixture of flour/water(i was out of cornstarch). Very yummy though, perfect balance of chocolate and sugar. Tasted great over the "Fluffy Pancakes" from this website. Mmm!

Awesome!  We ran out of Hershey's and I found this thinking there must be a recipe for this somewhere.  On a whim, threw this together and it's GREAT. I will never buy from the store again!  I did bring to a boil quickly and stirred rapidly with a whisk, it was thickened in no time.  I would strongly recommend!  I may try adding a little instant coffee granules next time for a mocha flavor.

I used half regular sugar and half sugar twin to lighten it up.  It was very sweet. I would reduce the amount of sugar twin next time.  I also noticed that it did not thicken alot; but, it still worked well for my purposes (lite iced mocha). I would make it again.

Very nice recipe.  I halved for my purposes today and added a tablespoon instant espresso powder.  I also added a tablespoon of ClearJell thickener (from King Arthur Flour) to get the texture I wanted as I think it would have been too thin otherwise.  And I used a minimally processed cane sugar instead of white sugar.  It turned out perfectly and far superior to Hershey's.  Thanks for the recipe!  So easy and so good...

I was a Hershey's Syrup snob until I tried this recipe... THE BEST!!  After reading some of the reviews, I was a little worried that this was going to have a dark chocolate taste... I cannot stand dark chocolate so I was thinking I would need to add more sugar if that was the case.  That being said... if you like the original Hershey's Syrup, make this recipe EXACTLY as stated!  I followed every ingredient and step of this recipe and it not only tasted like my favorite chocolate syrup, it was so much better!  The true test for me was trying it in milk and that was what sold me!  My husband and kids loved it too!   Winner all around!  This is also fantastic on ice cream.  For as simple and cheap as it is to make (not to mention simple ingredients and no high fructose corn syrup) this is now my go-to chocolate syrup, so happy I found this recipe!

Great syrup! I made this with Splenda for sugar-free chocolate milk. It mixes great with the milk, especially since it isn't very thick. Thanks for the recipe!

This does taste just like Hershey's syrup. I had no idea it was so simple to make. Thank you - this is great! I'm gonna try adding fruit flavors, and/or less sugar or dark cocoa for a more bittersweet flavor.

This was the perfect ratio.  Excellent chocolate syrup to use in chocolate milk, ice cream and coffee.

Delicious! I am not a fan of Hershey's syrup, but I love this stuff. I followed directions as written. I ended up whisking it over low heat for about 15 minutes. As others have written, it thickened up overnight in the fridge. It is now slightly runnier than Hershey's syrup. I made a mocha with it and it was so good!

This is exactly what I was looking for!  I used the ingredients listed, but followed the cooking instructions for another "chocolate sauce" recipe from this site:  bring to boil over medium heat and boil for 1 minute.  After being refrigerated, the consistency was about what I wanted.  Kind of like what Hershey's syrup used to be before they started using so much corn syrup.  I used Penzey's natural cocoa.

Today was my first time making this syrup and I wish I'd read some of the reviews first, like I normaly do. Oh well...I too had to simmer the syrup for about 20 min. before it showed any signs of thickening. Any ideas as to how to thicken it without boiling it forever and being able to use it the same evening or is it a must to leave in fridge overnight? I'd appreciate any help as hubby's a huge chocolate user. (He's not huge, just his taste for chocolate sauce:)

This turned out a bit too thick for me, maybe I cooked it too long? I added a bit of milk to thin it out so that was fine, but it was grainy in texture, I'm a bit disappointed!

Loved this recipe!  I did not pay attention to the cooking time - knowing how pudding and fudge thickens I brought it slowly to a rolling boil, and when it thickened, I decided I was done - it doesn't take long though

Short and to the point - Good Recipe :)
If you like a few more details: This is good - thickened up beautifully (so the reviewers saying it didn’t would probably benefit from learning how simple syrups are made - that would clear up any issues they’re having). In short - the directions make it sound like everything goes in up front - and it Can, but working on low heat will take a very, very, very long time. That said - it may be tastier - never knock low and slow - but you may want a slow cooker to ‘low and slow’ it. It doesn’t necessarily have to be low and slow though if you understand simple syrups and chocolate. The sugar and water, if brought to a good simmer Before adding the chocolate, will only take a few minutes to thicken. Then you turn down the heat, let the bubbles slow down - now add your cocoa powder and stir for 5 minutes. I’ve made it twice. I don’t like it quite as much as the store bought Yet. I think I didn’t wait long enough with either batch for the simple syrup to come down to a lower temperature. I taste slightly burnt notes - those are On Me, so I’m not knocking the recipe for it. Even with that - the flavor is still really good - which is why I’m still giving it a 5 star.  I’m pretty sure I’m going to be tweaking this for a bit. That said - I think I’ll get there. Also, this is flexible, if you want to be a little creative. You can add cinnamon (1/2 tsp when adding the cocoa), or hazelnut, or maple, or mint extract when you turn off the heat. All tas

Just made this. I get chocolate cravings. I made a glass of chocolate milk. So good. Can’t wait for my iced coffee with this. By the way while making it I kinda remember mom making this. We’d put over ice cream.

I made the recipe exactly as written.  Followed the advice of other reviewers who refrigerated the syrup, and it was perfect consistency.  Thicker and tastier than Hershey syrup, and a plus to be able to control the sugar and avoid corn syrup. Thank you!

I also mixed the water & sugar first (which other reviews suggested). Brought it to a simmer & once the sugar was almost dissolved I the slowly added the unsweetened cocoa powder & salt while constantly whisking. When it was slightly bubbling & thickened, I removed it from the heat & whisked in the vanilla. My son said it made delicious chocolate milk. 
I am going to try the sugar substitute version next time. Thank you Zen K.

I love it! I've made it several times and it's our favorite ice cream topping. The only difference is I start in out on a higher heat, and bring it up to a boil before dropping it to low. It comes out a little thicker and richer.

I had no problem with thickening.  I put the sugar and water and salt in the pan.  Stirred  a few seconds until it was all dissolved and added the cocoa.  Stirred till all lumps were gone added vanilla.  This set up so fast I thought I might have pudding.  I think I added the wrong cocoa though.  I used extra dark.  Hmmm.  A little to much chocolate flavor.  I tried some on ice cream and it tasted good to me but hubby would like regular cocoa next time.

bring to a boil at medium high to high depending on your burner. then reduce to medium to medium high so it will simmer, not warm but little bubbles stirring constantly.  it takes heat to make it thicken.  i've never used corn starch in any syrups as the boiled sugar and water make it thick.  the cocoa powder also helps it to thicken.  you can test the thickening on the back of a wooden spoon like custards.  drag your finger through and the liquid shouldn't immediately fill in the space.  also, it will thicken more when cooled.  i make a lot of syrups.

This was AWESOME!!! I made this to put in milk for chocolate milk, and it was kind of thin, so I used more than normal; it wasn’t needed! To make it taste good, make the milk the same color as if you used store bought.

Made it several times but was always just a touch runny - i added a teaspoon of corn starch to the dry so it would be a bit thicker. Worked like a charm

Perfect! It was watery after I was done making it so I put it in the fridge and it got thicker. I also used Hershey Cocoa Powder so it was even BETTER!

Super easy and delightful with common ingredients. Only thing to maybe complain about is that it settles faster in chocolate milk than store bought syrups.

I didn't make any changes. I'm 55 and on my way around the kitchen (I can, hunt, fish & despise boxed foods) I think there may be a touch too much water, which I suppose could be cooked down a little more. although that could burn the chocolate. I'm fine with it it's just a little bitter in a little runny

Cut the recipe in half, added 1/2 teaspoon of corn starch, 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon, and replaced 1/4 cup of brewed coffee instead of all the 3/4 cup of water suggested = (1/4 cup coffee, 1/2 cup water) Remember I divided recipe in half.  Rich flavor and so much better than store bought. Decadent on yogurt, only need less than a tablespoon.  Rich flavor of chocolate for sure.

Fast to make, good flavor, more convenient than running to the store, better ingredients...what's not to like? Today I made as written but added 1 tsp instant espresso powder - not to give it a coffee flavor, but to enhance the chocolatiness. :)  This is a keeper.

This is seriously good syrup!  Thick, creamy, intense chocolate flavor.   For those who said it was too thin: cook it on medium-low heat for as long as it takes to get it as think as you like.  Just stir every once in a while.

I cooked it at 3 (out of 9) on an electric stove in a glass pot.  I'm sure a metal pot would work even better.  Couldn't have been easier and it came out perfect!

Love it! I used 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup heavy cream. Dissolved sugar over med heat. Then gradually added the cocoa mixing well. Allowed to come to simmer stirring constantly. Removed from heat and added 1/2 cup heavy cream and vanilla. Tossed the pan in freezer for 15 minutes then poured into a jar and stored in fridge.

Its like chocolate water.... not enjoyable on its own, but mixed with something.  I'd try cutting back the water to 1 cup or 3/4 cup.

What to do when you have vanilla ice cream and no more syrup? Make your own!  This wasn't as thick as I was expecting it to be. Funny to claim it's better then Hershey's, when I used Hershey coco powder, but it is good!

Turned out perfect, everyone who's tasted it has raved about it.  Never buying pre-made again.  It never seizes up, always runny and ready for pouring.  Tastes delicious.

Great basic recipe. After reading other comments, I decided to use less liquid. I used 1/2 c milk and 3/4 c cream. Thickened wonderfully.
Yes, water would have had less fat, but my way was delicious!!

I think this is the best chocolate syrup! Yep, its better than Hershey's and when you use artificial sugar ( I use Truvia), the calories are practically nothing and amounts to 0 WW Smartpoints. I didn't change or add anything, its perfect the way it is here. Make a batch and see for yourself.

Taste and consistency like the canned syrup which I always used for milkshakes and is no longer available. One can make it thinner if the taste or sonsistency of bottled is preferred.

I substituted milk for the water, and brought the mixture to a boil to melt the sugar. Then I simmered it over low heat for about 7 minutes before stirring in the vanilla. It was slightly thin when done cooking, but thickened upon cooling. So delicious.

This was absolutely fantastic! I made an ice box cake and added swirls of this syrup over the whipped cream. Yum!!! Excellent ratings from friends. ??

Same recipe I’ve been using for years, with a slightly different cooking instruction. Good recipe. Better than Hershey’s.

I use organic sugar (all recipes I use less cause it’s so much sweeter) and I used organic cocoa powder.  I used only 3/4 cup of that
At the end I thicked it with some arrowroot powder (yes organic). The powder is so silky I wasn’t worried - omg.  It helped thicken it slowly.  Can’t wait til it cools off!!! Completely
Ummmm yeah. I can’t wait.  I hear the milk calling my name in the fridge. Bye y’all.  If I don’t edit this.  Then I know I’m in heaven lo

Love this recipe! Family can't tell the difference between this recipe and the store bought Hershey's Syrup. The only change I made was adding cornstarch to thicken it up

Absolutely delicious and yummy in every way! My family doesn’t use white sugar so I substituted raw sugar for it and I used Hershey’s Special Dark 100% Cocoa powder. This is a perfect alternative to the yucky syrups laden with high fructose corn syrup.

Very tasty and easy to make, tastes better than Hershey's chocolate syrup. Not too sweet either. Also, I substituted the water with milk instead to make it more creamy and cut the recipe in half, which made about a cup. Would make again!

Not the bet not the worst.  There were several changes that I made to this after making it several times with varying levels of success.  First, I combined the sugar, cocoa, and salt in the pan before adding the water. After the water was in the pan, I brought it to a boil and then lowered it to a simmer to reduce on low heat for a good 25 minutes. Worked like a charm!

Just made this for the 2nd time, and while the result is especially delicious, I feel like I'm doing something wrong.  I could whisk that pot for hours on end at low heat, and the mixture NEVER thickens or starts to simmer.  I end up having to crank it up to medium or just a little higher before it finally does simmer.  (I'm using an electric glass cooktop stove... does that make a difference?  I don't know!)

On my 2nd attempt, I did add 1 1/2 tsp of cornstarch as recommended by other reviews, and that did thicken it up a bit, but not to the consistency of Hershey's syrup... but then, it's still not completely cool yet, so it may get better.

Also, I ran out of regular cocoa powder and had to substitute 1/4 c of "Special Dark" cocoa powder on the 2nd attempt.  Still very delicious, but I recommend sticking with the recipe on that one... 1st batch was definitely better.  My kids were absolutely blown away by how good it was, and begged me to make more!  Definitely better than Hershey's.  I'll never buy the store-bought stuff again.

I made it the way it was written. I have mixed feelings about it. The taste is very good beer t it is very thin.  Great for some cooking, chocolate milk, hot chocolate but a bit disappointing as an ice cream topper.

So delicious!  My first batch I used regular cocoa, and it reminded me of the classic Hershey’s syrup in the brown can. Major nostalgia. I just made another batch today and used extra-dark cocoa. I also boiled the water and sugar for one minute, then added the salt and cocoa. I let that simmer for about five minutes before adding the vanilla. It sat covered for about an hour while we ate dinner. Warmed it just a bit and had it on brownie sundaes—divine!!  So rich and chocolaty. This is so easy and inexpensive to make. I love it!

First of all, I see a lot of comments about the syrup not thickening up. I honestly feel that is because they are expecting this to happen in the 5 minutes of cooking time that is stated. Unless my brand new stove is broken, this will not thicken in 5 minutes of cooking time on "low" heat. I actually turned the heat to a higher "low" setting during cooking & I was still standing at the stove, whisking/stirring after almost an hour. With that being said, I will probably try more of a medium heat setting the next time I make this. And there WILL be a next time. Even though it took so long to cook, it DID thicken once it was heated through & getting warmer. Mine never did get to a simmer. But, despite that, I took it off the heat, added the vanilla, & basically forgot about it. Once it was completely cooled, I ended up with a nice thick, chocolatey sauce. I can not wait to use it. It is delicious! I will definitely use this recipe over the years to come.

I have made this syrup several times now and it makes  the best chocolate milk. It's so delicious that it gets finished really fast. Great recipe. I don't add vanilla just to keep it as natural as  possible and the syrup is perfect.

To make this recipe uniquely my own, I add a full pinch of cinnamon for flavor, a small pinch of nutmeg for warmth, and a tiny pinch of cayenne pepper to nibble around the edge of the tongue. You can also add a few drops of orange  flavoring, peppermint flavoring, or any of your other favorites for special occasions, or personal indulgence.

The recipe does not specify how long it takes to thicken and I think we didn't cook it long enough.  Our was still pretty thin when we removed ir from the heat after about 10 minutes.  Love the fact that it doesn't contain HFC like the store bought brands. Very good flavor and we'll do a little experimenting with this one to thicken it a bit more.

Dissolve the sugar in water (simple syrup ratio: 2 parts sugar to 1 part water). Heat this mixture to 230 degrees F (syrup stage). Don't let it get much hotter than this or your syrup will harden into concrete as it cools. Add cocoa, etc. and complete recipe. This will give a nice syrup-y consistency.

I've made this several times, and I like it better than the Hershey's version because it doesn't have the same bitterness. I do follow another reviewer's suggestion to dissolve the sugar before adding the cocoa powder, then salt, and finally vanilla after removing from the heat.

I love making this syrup. It is pretty thin once it's cooked up, but overnight in the fridge fixes that. I tend to prepare it just a tiny bit differently; mix the dry ingredients with a whisk, then add in the water and whisk until smooth, before putting it in the heat. While it's cooking, use a wooden spoon to stir constantly, you can feel it thickening just slightly. I had a 21 oz bottle to refill, and as written, it was too much. I'll cut back next time, just so I don't have a mess again. Overall, a good replacement for the typical bottled brand.

This recipe is excellent for those wishing to avoid high fructose corn syrup.  Tastes better than store bought syrups! One note, it thickens at the bottom of the container as it sits in the fridge, stir well before each use.

I  found a recipe somewhere that is exactly like this one except it calls for 1 Cup of water instead of 1 1/2 Cups. I have been using that recipe with great success for some time now. I also add 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon but we are a Mexican household and love the chocolate/cinnamon combo.

Didn't thicken up for me...even when it came to a slow boil for a short time.  I think I'll use milk instead of water next time, as suggested by others.  Taste  great though.

I cut the recipe in half and found that the sauce wasn't thickening on low heat so I carefully turned it up the low-medium after 5-10 minutes of continuous whisking. I carefully stirred and whisked to ensure it wouldn't burn and it helped to thicken up the sauce a bit. It is incredibly delicious!

This chocolate sauce is delicious and easy. It's just the like the chocolate sauce my Swedish grandmother used to make -- a bit runny but simple and tasty. I didn't have her recipe (I'm sure it was never written down) - so I'm thrilled to find this one!

I loved this recipe and you just have to let the syrup simmer longer and then it thickens just tiny little bit as it sits after its done on the stove it begins to thicken more. I would recommend letting this sit overnight in the fridge, or if you need if right away just wrap some wet paper towels around the container it's in and then place it in the freezer for about 10-20 minutes and it will be ready to go!

This chocolate syrup turned out amazing! I added a little more than a dash of salt because I feel like salt really compliments chocolate. I also used 1/4 cup of brewed coffee then 1 1/4 cups of water instead of the full 1 1/2 cups of water the recipe calls for. The coffee adds a deep richness that I really enjoy.

It was really good! I reduced the water slightly and it thickened with no problems.  My daughter loved the homemade chocolate milk I made for her, this mom got huge points!!

Great flavor & easy to make. I also added a little corn starch to help it thicken.

It's perfect. Slightly thickens in the fridge. Makes a fair bit.  Followed another poster's idea and nuked for 3 minutes.. stirred.. nuked for 2 minutes.. stirred.. then added vanilla. Next time I'm trying milk and going for a fudge sauce!

This is a perfect recipe. Housebound with a sick child who wanted nothing more than Hershey's chocolate milk, I turned to this recipe in desperation. I will never purchase the stuff in the brown bottle again, when it is so simple to make this without questionable ingredients. The only sugar I had on hand was that brown "raw" stuff that comes in large crystals. It worked great. Thanks, Greek Lover Boy, for the xanthan gum suggestion.

I made this syrup to go with crepes . My brothers loved it. It worked great with crepes because of how thin the consistency was.  It was really rich ( I halved the sugar amount, to focus more on the cocoa taste.) Overall I recommend this to anybody baking crepes.

This is a super easy syrup to make. I've made it with the vanilla extract and substituting almond extract and both ways were delicious.

My seven year old and I made this....just cooked and stirred it a bit longer and it thickened perfectly to a syrupy consistency.  Thanks. Her four older siblings will be surprised with delicious chocolate milk when they get home!

This recipe is the bomb!! Followed it exactly! We've been buying Hershey's for over 20 years and this recipe is so much tastier!! I'm so happy I found it! Thought it was too thin the first day, but the second day it was a perfect consistency!! Never buying Hershey's again!

Had to add custard powder, corn starch, chocolate chips & milk. But at least it's starting to thicken up. Before adding all these extra ingredients, it was as thin as water!

I made this with only 1 cup of water, less sugar and a little less cocoa powder; I let it boil for a few minutes until it thickened nicely. Used it over waffles this morning since I ran out of chocolate syrup and I've to say, it tasted much better than the ones you get at the store!

I love this chocolate syrup! I have been making it since my 13 year old was in Pre-K.  He had behavioral issues and I had read about how artificial flavors, colors, and preservatives contribute to ADD & ADHD like behaviors. I got an all natural cookbook and this recipe was in it. (Side note: when I cut out the artificial stuff he had a 180* turn around in behavior, no meds) I have not stuck to the no artificial stuff as he has gotten older, but will always use this recipe. I will still not allow artificial vanilla or any FDC color if it can be avoided. The other thing about this sauce is when it says to let it thicken, don't expect it to thicken much. It's more like a thin chocolate gravy than the chocolate sauce you're used to getting at the store.

I've made this a few times now. Milk makes is a little creamier but it's pretty darn good with just the water. 

It will also have a longer shelf life without using the milk and my diary free friends love it! 

Spice it up with a little cinnamon for some Spanish hot cocoa 

It thickens as it cools but you can also reduce it down a bit by cooking it longer

This recipe could not be easier and it tastes much better than Hershey's syrup!  Now I just can't bring myself to pay for the store bought stuff. Followed the directions exactly, no need to change a thing.

I absolutely love this chocolate syrup! It is so easy to make and since it uses just a few basic ingredients, I always have them on hand and can make it any time I get a hankering for chocolate syrup. :) It's not super thick, but neither is Hershey's syrup. (And I actually don't like Hershey's -- this is MUCH better.) If you're looking for something thick, then it's best to try one of the hot fudge recipes.

After reading some reviewers complain about the lack of viscosity I started with boiling the sugar and water down for about 10 minutes or so and then added the rest of the ingredients off the heat. I stirred it thoroughly to make sure the cocoa was completely incorporated. NO PROBLEMS AT ALL. This was absolutely amazing!!! I was looking for a healthier alternative to all the junky high-fructose products out there. This  met my expectations and THEN some. I completely agree that it's better then Hershey's. I'm even contemplating jarring up a batch for Christmas gifts! Great recipe!

This is the same recipe that was in my recipe box over 40 years ago, from my aunt. Worked then, works now. I can't imagine why several people had difficulty with it thickening. It just takes patience, a good 20 -30 minutes on low heat. I started out by whisking constantly and once the pot started a nice slow boil, I whisked every few minutes. I also used my pot watcher gadget to keep it from boiling over. You can get one on Amazon - A MUST for all things simmered.

I love this recipe!! I really like knowing what's going into the food I feed my family and with 2 little kids who love chocolate milk, I really don't need to worry about preservation... It doesn't last that long in our house. I scale back the water to 1 cup to make it a little thicker, but otherwise I follow the recipe as is. Enjoy!!

I’m trying to reduce my sugar intake so I substituted about 1/3 of the sugar with stevia in the raw. I find artificial sweeteners have an odd aftertaste but it’s not as noticeable if you use at least 1/2 real sugar (I’ve also developed allergies to most sugar substitutes now). The only thing I would recommend is once everything is about melted & mixed well, crank up the heat & BOIL it while stirring constantly for several minutes to thicken. Simmering makes it more fudgey, boiling makes it more syrupy. Simmering also takes a LOT longer.

I love this recipe. I will usually make it with raw sugar and Hershey dark chocolate cocoa powder (it's hard to get some cocoa with flavornoids, so I make do). I do have a problem trying to understand the calories. So it's 16 serving, which is 85 calories.. But what is considered a serving via this recipe?

Delicious!  Amazing over ice cream! Couldn't be easier to make.  Plenty thick for syrup...but bring to a boil for a minute or two. Must try...wow your friends and family!

My son wanted chocolate milk, and since we never buy chocolate syrup, thought I would check allrecipes for a recipe for it. And bingo, found this, made a 2/3 batch and voila...syrup for chocolate milk and mochas. One thing I did different...I added the chocolate powder and sugar to my container first, then added boiling hot water to the mix and stirred. Too many lumps, so I grabbed the whisk and whisked it. Used immediately in milk, and my son gave it a thumbs up. I have it in the fridge now to cool, but tasting the mocha I made with it makes this a winner.

This is great!  My grandsons were skeptical at first when I told them I made it but are big fans now.  I do add a bit of cornstarch which just helped to thicken it. Otherwise it is perfect and taste is a ten!  The boys have ice cream with chocolate syrup every day they are with me at 3 p.m.

This recipe is great! My parents and little cousins all loved it, but I find the sauce to be too thin so I added 4 tablespoons of cornstarch and ended up with just the right consistency.

So good,and so simple.  I did add 1/2 tsp of xanthan gum to thicken.  Made with cane sugar to avoid GMO beet sugar.

AWESOME!!!  Made some of the modifications others noted.  Dissolved 1 cup organic granulated sugar and 1/2 cup organic powdered sugar in 1.5 cups of distilled water on low heat.  Then added 1.5 cups of organic cacao powder and turned heat to medium.  As soon as it began to boil I took it off the flame (gas stove).  I then stirred in the 1 tsp organic Vanilla extract and 1/8 tsp pink himalayan salt.  I also added only 3 drops of the liquid vanilla creme stevia.  I let it cool and then poured it into a glass jar and set it in the refrigerator.  Even before placing it in the refrigerator I found it to be the perfect consistency for making chocolate milk.  After refrigeration it was thicker and would be perfect for topping ice cream.  The taste was awesome!  My only regret is not even thinking about making my own chocolate syrup sooner.  This recipe yielded a far superior syrup at only a fraction of the cost of organic chocolate syrups in the store!  I had xanthan gum ready to add to the recipe, but it was not needed. Thank you to everyone for such a wonderful recipe!!

this is a great recipe but it takes a lot longer than 5 minutes cook time to go from low to simmering. your low setting must be blazing.

Err'body loved it over vanilla ice cream.  Followed fellow users advice to melt sugar in water (I used a little less than asked for of milk) before adding cocoa.  Perfecto consistency.

Perfect. No changes needed, that's for sure!
My Husband said, if I hadn't told him that the chocolate milk I served was made with this homemade chocolate syrup, he wouldn't have known the difference from Hershey's! 
He LOVED it, and I do, too!!!

This is so easy to make and delicious. Note: syrup thickens while cooling. 
Some one that rated this recipe said hers didn't thicken so she added a cornstarch slurie. No need.??

I will never buy chocolate syrup at the grocery store again! I was out and my daughter drinks milk much better with a little chocolate in it, so I decided to try my hand at making my own, and came across this recipe. It's amazing, I might not be able to share with her! Velvety and smooth and delicious

This is an awesome recipe! Seriously I ran out of syrup one day and decided since I have cocoa powder on hand at all times I'd try to make my own. Looked up a recipe and decided to go with this one. I did add 1/2 cup more sugar since I used the unsweetened dark cocoa powder. It took a bit longer than I thought it would, but it thickened up nicely. I was able to almost completely refill my bottle of store bought syrup with this recipe. This is actually better than the Hershey's syrup! This has earned it's spot in my recipe book!

This is a fab, yummy SYRUP, not a sauce. This is wonderful chocolate flavour to satisfy your craving. We put it in milk, hot or cold, fantastic on any fruit, custard, pudding and on and on. This is good for people with allergies to wheat as there is no thickener. Love it.

Really is better than store bought!  Probably because it's made without chemicals :) I used turbinado sugar and hershey's special dark cocoa powder.  I never measure vanilla, and always go heavy with it, so probably used more like a tbsp or two; also used about 1 tsp of sea salt (instead of a "dash").  I think I will experiment with a "raw" version now using raw honey instead of simple syrup and raw cacao powder instead of cocoa.

We went to the store to get stuff for brownie Sundays but forgot the syrup! Fear not though because we found this recipe! Haha it whipped up quick and I've got it cooling in a mason jar as I type this. It tastes good so far but maybe a tad bitter, thanks for the save on our deserts!

I love this recipe. Sooooo easy anyone can do it and there's no excuse to buy the chemical cocktail from the store called chocolate syrup. The only suggestion I have is to strain it into whatever container you're storing it in. I sift my cocoa and simmer a good long time and always end up with a few "bits" in the bottom. Also, know your cocoa! I used a blend of natural and "Dutched" cocoa that is excellent but very strong. If don't have a good quality cocoa powder it will effect the end result so take some of the negative reviews with a grain of salt :-)

This is simple and great, but I used 2 to 1 whipping cream and water, stirred all together before heating, and added a tablespoon of cinnamon - it'll make you wanna lick the pot! So smooth and creamy!

I made with 1c water, 1c sugar, 1c cocoa powder and added vanilla & salt unchanged. Combined water & sugar first to make syrup then added remaining ingredients. Left on counter to cool down and syrup thickened after a few hours.

After reading this recipe and reviews I decided to try it! I used slightly less cocoa 3/4 instead of a full cup and it was great! I forgot my vanilla at first but it was still good even without the vanilla. This is one of my new fav homemade cheats I will never pay 3.00-4.00 for a bottle of store bought ever again!!!

What do we do if the cocoa we're using has already been sweetened? I'm going to try this next month but I don't really have a clear view on my ingredients. I wouldn't want my syrup to be too sweet. Nonetheless, I'm glad I found this. If all else fails, I'll just wing it next month when I make it :)

I just made this and It was really good. I used Dutch Cocoa powder and I was concerned about all the sugar in the recipe so I used 1 cup opposed to 1 1/2 .. It's still way too sweet so next time I think I'll try using just half to 3/4 of a cup. I read people's comments saying it didn't thicken properly, mine turned out fine. I followed the instructions and waited for a simmer on low heat then removed it. Just be patient

Very good recipe.. I used cornstarch to thicken. Not overly sweet, great on ice cream or in my sugar free shakes. I substituted stevia for sugar. I Keep it in refrigerator in squeeze bottle with cap.

Ok, I'll admit it is a little bit thinner than the "store bought" varieties. However, it doesn't have High Fructose Corn Syrup or those artificial additives that large companies like Hershey, etc. use! So, yes, there are trade offs to be made when you make something homemade that you are used to getting commercially! But to address the issue of thickness, it could be the ingredients used, ie. cheaper brand cocoa powder or lack of stirring during the simmering, etc. I let mine cool down completely outside the fridge & then put it into an old chocolate syrup bottle I had saved just for this purpose & put it into the fridge. Also, I didn't feel that it made too much either as it filled up that 22oz. bottle perfectly. I was disappointed that it didn't fill up 2 bottles for the amount of cocoa powder it called for. Overall we like the syrup very much & I will make it again & again.

Perfect!  I use a little less sugar than is suggested because I'm trying to reduce my sweet tooth and also sometimes I mix 1/2 sugar 1/2 splenda.  But everything here is perfect!

I made this today and it turned out great.  I took the advice of one commenter that suggested dissolving the sugar in water before adding the cocoa.  Yes, it is thin right now though most comments indicate it will thicken slightly as it cools.  This is a great alternative to Hersheys, cheaper and has no preservatives.

Perfect, perfect, perfect. Super easy and no artificial ingredients. It's just like the name brand, only the chocolate taste is more true. I used dark cocoa powder and slowly brought the syrup to a boil, whisking the whole time. Just wonderful!

I liked the ease of this recipe and it stores quite well.  My daughter really enjoyed the taste and used it almost daily to make chocolate milk.  My husband commented that there was no fake aftertaste like you get with a store bought chocolate sauce.

This is a very easy recipe! I have tried it twice and both times it has turned out awesome. I highly suggest it for beginners. Just make sure you put it on a very, very low tempurature for about two hours and stir aleast every 5 min.

Delicious! I made this syrup to drizzle over a mint chocolate chip cheesecake that I made (I modified Chantel's New York Cheesecake from this site) and it was great. Not grainy at all, which apparently is an issue for some people who have attempted homemade chocolate syrup.

My 5-year old has a small glass of chocolate milk every morning. I usually buy a club-size bottle of nesquick from costco, but had run out one morning and found this recipe. He downed his chocolate milk faster than ever before, and the next morning asked if he could have the "good chocolate milk, like the one you gave me yesterday". I'll never spend $13 on a bottle of nesquick again...and can feel good that I am in control of the quality of the ingredients going into it.

I cut the recipe in half and made a few changes. I used chocolate milk instead of water. I also reduced the sugar and used brown sugar instead of white. When thick remove from heat and stir in 1 tsp of butter. It was excellent, I could not stop eating it
I put it over homemade fruit cocktail.

Divine chocolate sauce. Though a little dark, still excellent. If you want it thick instead of runny, you will need to cook for at least an hour.

Excellent. Remember that this is a syrup, not a sauce so it's gonna have the expected consistency. Still a winner with my 8, 7 & 5 yr. old kids. Definetly will make this on a regular basis.

My syrup mixture was too thin, even taking into account that this is a syrup not fudge sauce. I didn't expect it to be really thick but mine is too thin. I'm still giving it 4 stars though because the flavor is good and I think the thinness is my fault. Next time I will simmer the sugar mix longer and add the cocoa at the end. I probably didn't cook it long enough for fear of burning the chocolate.
