Made these biscotti today.  They were flavorful, but the baking temperature 375 degrees, is too high. The ends of the loaves and the edges were very brown, nearly burned. Next time I'll bake the biscotti the way I've baked other biscotti recipes. Bake loaves at 350 for 30 minutes. Cool on rack for 10 minutes then cut into 1/2 inch slices with sharp knife. Place cut biscotti on the baking sheet and return to hot oven for another 15 minutes. Turn biscotti over.  Turn off oven and place biscotti back into the oven until golden brown.

My mother is a biscotti lover, so for her birthday this year I found this recipe and made them. They were a hit! I made them again for Mother's Day. Now I keep getting questioned when I'm making them again. I don't think she's going back to store bought. ;-) The one thing I changed the second time I made them was instead of 2 tsp vanilla extract, I used 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp almond extract, and 1/2 tsp anise extract. Going to experiment with dried blueberries, and cranberries, and other nuts eventually.

Wonderful!  Easy and very tasty!  This recipe has gone into our must save and make every year section!  To the reviewer who commented on the cooking temp: one should always adjust to their own oven and keep an eye on the baked goods.  For the reviewer who asked about the Amaretto, it cannot be tasted in the dough.  It enhances the taste of the cherries and that's about it.  I do agree adding a little almond flavoring would be interesting to test.  Thanks PJ's Kitchen for a wonderful recipe!

used pistachios, because i had a bunch of them, and i added about 4 oz. of chopped dark chocolate. i love that the dried cherries are left whole - it gives them a wonderful texture.

Made it exactly as recipe called for. 375 was a little too high and bottom of biscotti dough got very dark. Taste is phenomenal, will make again but adjust temp.

I make this all the time especially when I have to travel to bring gifts (recently took to Japan). They hold up beautifully. I strongly recommend putting half almond and half vanilla extract so that the taste comes through. I am also generous with the cherry juice/amaretto liquid. One thing I do before baking is mark my cuts on the loaf so that when it is baked the slicing is regular, on a proper angle. I lower the temperature to 200 and let them back in oven for a longer crisp. They are addictive. Served with Vinsanto, a regional sweet wine of Florence, you are transported back to a sidewalk cafe. Enjoy these again and again.
