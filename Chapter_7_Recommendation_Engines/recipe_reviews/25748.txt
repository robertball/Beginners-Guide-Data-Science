I didn't have beef consomme in the house, but then remembered that I still had the sauce left over from the French Dip recipe I had made the night before. It was a great sauce so I figured it would help to make a great soup. I'm happy to say that my family said it was the best onion soup they'd ever had.

Delicious. My husband isn't much of a broth person, adds crackers and bread to anything to thicken it into gloop and he loved this. Made it twice now, added some fresh ground pepper and garlic powder the second time and it turned out amazing.

Definitely need to cook the onions at least a full half hour to get them tender.  Also I didn't have consumme so I just used extra broth and it turned out great.

My first review. I love this recipe and have been using it for a long time. I added some rosemary sprigs, a minced garlic clove, and 1 tablespoon of Worcester sauce. Fish out the rosemary sprigs before serving. Very nice and easy french onion soup.

Followed this recipe very precisely. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. What I would change?

1. Caramelizing the onions! I feel like this could have added a depth to the broth that was lacking.
2. Adding fresh garlic and Worcestershire sauce to add some complexity to the again, lacking broth. 
3. Toasting the French bread (maybe even season the bread first with butter/garlic/Parmesan) before so it doesn't turn into to a slimy/mushy mess within minutes of dipping your spoon in for the first taste. 

I may try another recipe that is a bit more complex next time because I love French Onion soup enough that I only think it's fair to move on. Sorry, but I am breaking up with this recipe.

Great...made it a few times now. Really easy version: Skip the bread and the oven step. Just mix in some cheese when you put it in the serving bowl. Don't need to add any salt and pepper....tasty enough!

This turned out pretty good but using all beef stock made it a bit too strong in beef flavor. It's onion soup after all and you want to taste that. I prefer a mix of chicken and beef stock but I still liked this. Thanks for sharing. :o)
