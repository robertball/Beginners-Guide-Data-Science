PERFECT!  I put the beans in the crock-pot (instead of baking) and dumped all the ingredients in.  I used 'real bacon' bits from the salad isle and served with ham rather than add the ham in with the cooking.  I used these at a Christmas Kids Party - There wasn't anything left!  Just as good as those Southern Baked Beans - if you like the sweet taste, you'll love these!

I used ketchup instead of the diced tomatoes, prepared mustard (not the dry) and omitted the ham. I think the bacon was enough for a side dish!Sometimes I cut the molasses by half as well. Delicious results. Thanks for the post, Diane.

Quicker than starting from scratch. These are delicious and easy. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and they were still wonderful.

I made this reciped as a side for a Mother's Day dinner and everyone loved it. I made it the day before and baked it for the first hour, then baked it the rest of the way the day of the dinner. (I'd use a little less sugar next time.) ;-)
Yum! Yum!

These baked beans were my contribution to my dad's 90th birthday celebration this past Saturday.  They really made a hit all around.  Dad said they were the only thing he had seconds on. I am not a baked bean fan, but these were excellent. I just might make them for myself sometime, cutting the recipe, of course.  I used a little over a cup of diced ham instead of the 1/2 C.

So good! As I am a vegetarian, I left out the bacon and it turned our so yummy! This is really a great recipe. A tip for vegetarians is to use crispy fried onions bought in the asian section of the supermarket and sprinkle on top of the beans when ready. This is always what I use instead of bacon.

OMG ! I just took these out of the oven while company is here and they came running to the kitchen. The smell in the house is incredible. When seeing canned baked beans I was not to excited as I like to cook from scratch. Try this recipe people ! You will never go back to the from scratch recipe. I used what I had in the pantry, ketchup instead of the tomatoes, spicy brown mustard instead of the yellow, honey instead of molasses. No onion and no bacon! Even with all those changes they are fantastic! I used all of the brown sugar and normally do not like real sweet beans but these are an exception. The best I have ever made Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I'm a beginner but, I made these and those who had the nerve to try them said they were really good (probably just being nice =). )  I thought they were good but I like most anything.  I simply like to eat.

YUM!!!  These are so great I won't ever go back to canned baked beans!  They are definitely worth the effort.  To make them extra special, I even add left over brisket or slow cooked beef.  It adds even more flavor!

The second best baked beans I have ever had! (the first best are from my boyfriends grandmother and her recipe is very similar) I made 4 times this recipe for a party- half in the oven and half in the slow cooker. The beans from the oven turned out WAY better. They were alot thicker. My boyfriends grandmother even complimented me on them :)

Sorry but for me these were not edible because they were way too sweet.  I think they would be fine with 1/4 cup brown sugar.  This recipe has potential and I will try it with the revision.  Sorry.

This is a very good recipe, but it is missing something to give it the pop it needs to be the best.  I would decrease the amount of mustard also.

My family doesn't eat tomatoes or onions. So other than that everything was in it and turned out pretty good. They weren't the favorite at the party but they were almost completely gone at the end of it.

Made these up on the fly today. I omitted the salt and subbed black pepper, subbed ketchup for the tomatoes and omitted the ham. Everyone loved these! Thanks for the post.

Normally I make baked beans from scratch, but tried this recipe due to lack of time...it was delish!! I had chorizo so I added this and omitted the bacon. I didn't pre cook the onions either. Just put everything together and baked it. Definitely a keeper!

Awesome!  I love the semi-homemade aspect of this recipe; So simple, but wonderful taste.  I did sub honey for the molasses, just cause that's what I had on hand and I omitted the salt, as I thought the bacon would add enough.  Used Costco's maple bacon, which is surprisingly superior to standard bacon, and it really added to the over all flavor.  Oh, and I used spicy brown mustard instead of plain yellow mustard which I think added a nice depth, rather than a tangy zip you might get from yellow.  Mixed it all up in the crock pot dish, covered, and left in the frige overnight, then just put it on low for a few hours the day of.  This will be a permanent addition to my BBQ repertiore!

Unbelievably good. I was a bit of a skeptic approaching this since the main ingredient is canned baked beans. It seemed like culinary cheating, but it all worked out great! I will add I didn't use the molasses, since I didn't have it. But I did use all the other suggested ingredients and this was simply awesome!! You really have to let it cook for the duration, which is a long time, but it makes all the flavors meld better. Thanks for this. This will definitely be a repeat recipe in our home.

I made these and they were really good, my husband really liked them they were a bit too sweet for me.  I did read the previous reviews and only used 1/2 a cup of sugar but they still seemed too sweet!

These are by far the VERY BEST baked beans I've had!  My Aunt has been the "Queen of Baked Beans" in our family forever - my mother (her sister) just asked me to bring these to our family reunion after having them once at a bbq - and my Aunt gave me the nod to go ahead! I followed the recipe to a "T" and wouldn't change a thing!  You'll want extra for the next day, I suggest you squirrel some away before you serve or they'll be gone! Thank you for sharing!

I took these to a outing last night and they went over wonderful.  A five star recipe. The only reason for the four star is that I used tomato sauce instead of tomatoes. Next time I might cut back on the brown sugar. I thought they were a little sweet, but others thought they were wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe.

My wife really liked this. I used a pound of pork saugage and omited the bacon. I also used 2 cans of great nothern beans a can of butter beans and a can of lima beans, all drained and rinsed. I used a quart of stewed tomatoes in lieu of the diced tomatoes.

Delicious, family loved it.  Baked for  45 minutes on 425.  Used ketchup vs tomatoes.  And put 4 slices of uncooked bacon on top.  Turned down to 350 and baked another half an hour.

I initially cut the brown sugar to 1/2 cup & it tasted fine. Used 1/2 cup tomato sauce, because that is all I had. The only meat I added was 1# browned breakfast sausage. These were fantastic!! Def will be cooking these again. Oh...I made them in the crock pot. Perfect.

Our new family favorite!  Of course I made a few of my own changes (seems to be a trend on this site??). As shown in my picture, I used Bush Original Baked Beans, add 1 can of drained Hunts Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes (instead of the 1/2 cup), Alaga Syrup rather than molasses, only 1/2 T of powdered mustard, and 8 slices of bacon diced. For everything else I followed the recipe.  It was DELICIOUS!

This is a good recipe but it comes out very sweet! I would reduce the amount of sugar. Our local grocery store has really good baked beans but I thought I would try to make my own. With all the time this takes I think it's worth it to just buy them from the store.

These are the easist, yummiest beans I have ever made. My dad swears he has the best recipe, but I think once he trys these he'll change his mind! I always leave out the tomatoes, and sometimes use bacon pieces (not bits) instead of slices. This recipe is a family favorite!

better than mom's home-made!! I used Bush's Boston baked as well as Bourbon beans to start with. I used ready-made real bacon bits. I loosely measured the ingredients, and added a larger amount of molasses for that deep-browned taste. I put these in a slow cooker for a couple of hours, but they didn't thicken, so transferred them to a bean crock and convection-cooked them with no lid for the last hr. Next time, I would start them the night before, or early morn. and cook all day if using crock-pot. Alternatively, if using a bean crock I would allow for at least 3 or 4 hours in a med.(300*)oven. They do thicken nicely as they cool and they are even better as 2nd or 3rd day leftovers...if they last that long!!!!!!!!!

Wonderful!  I used bakes beans flavored with brown sugar.  I left out molasses, dry mustard and cooked ham - the bacon was enough flavor.  I added 4 stalks of chopped celery and 2 minced garlic cloves.  I cooked the bacon, onion, galic and celery in a big pot for about 10 minutes... then added the beans, tomatoes, mustard and salt.  Let simeer for about 1 hour and they were fantastic!  Will definitely make again.

This is a great sweeter version of baked beans.  So when I am taking these to a gathering with more younger guests, I use this recipe and it is always  hit.  The ham is a great surprise and I like that the bacon is in the recipe.  I have always disliked the full strip of bacon on top of the baked beans.  The recipe doesn't specify on packed or loose brown sugar so I did NOT pack it and it is plenty sweet.

Good recipe.  I only used 1/2 a cup of brown sugar.  That was more than sweet enough.  I also added in a some cut up onion.

I put everything in the crockpot.  Bacon tends to be too chewy in the crockpot so I used ham instead.

Took these to a pot luck and they were a huge hit. Even better cold from the fridge the next day. Have been trying to find a recipe that could mimic the beans my mom used to make - these are very close! Definitely a keeper.

When I made this recipe, my beans became too dry.  I had to reduce the amount of oven time.

These were very delicious.  I made it for my daughter's Baptism and people kept commenting on how great they were.  I didn't add the ham just added extra bacon because I'm not a big ham fan.  The only thing I would change would be to drain off some of the liquid from the beans.  I found them a little "watery".  I put them in the crockpot after they were fully cooked and it worked out awesome.  Other than that I would follow the recipe to the T.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good recipe.  I made a double batch for my husband's suprise birthday party - got it prepped in the morning and set the oven timer to come on before we got home.  Everyone loved it. Reheated well the next day too.
