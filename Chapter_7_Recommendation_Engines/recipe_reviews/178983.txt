With additions this is a wonderful meal...   I add a can of milk right away.. Very important! First though, I use olive oil.. and put the ham and tablespoon of minced garlic in a frying pan to brown.. then i start adding the rest of ingredients.. After all in in the pan.. I use tsp. of black pepper.. and 1/2 tsp of onion powder.. This is everyones fave that way.. I sometimes add more milk as well.. I like more creamy then sticky. Very good!

This recipe as published by Campbell's is very dry as is.  I made this in the past, and added 1 cup of sour cream, pepper and 1/2 tsp. poultry seasoning.  That made a world of difference.

I added garlic powder to this recipe, used 1/3 of an onion (because I made it for the kids) and put goldfish crackers on top.  It was a big hit.

Amazing!!!  And so tasty!!  My kids and parents all loved it.  I used only 1 cup of cheese, a cup of milk and 2 onions.  I substituted whole wheat rotini for the egg noodles and baked it all together for 15 min.  Absolutely delicious.

Very good, super easy!  I used mozzarella instead of cheddar, just because.  I also added frozen peas.  Kids loved it, adults too.

I was disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly, except for using less onion, and it was so sticky and thick I had to add milk. It was way too salty- and that was it as far as flavor. I will not make this again.

I altered this recipe too and it was awesome.  I cooked onion and ham in garlic and olive oil.  I added 3/4 a can of whipping cream and half can milk.  Put it all in a casserole dish and sprinkled with butter & bread crumb topping and baked in a 400 degree till brown and bubbly.

At the end I added milk because the dish came out very thick, the milk smoothed it out and I would definitely add that again.

I imagine kids would LOVE this. Won't make it just for myself again, but quick, tasty, and easy for picky eaters! But a little bland for my taste.

I made this pretty much as is, and it was, as others have commented, rather bland.  I added garlic powder and pepper liberally, and milk to make it creamier, but it still wasn't very tasty.  I wonder if adding some vegetables would help it; or possibly some other kind of soup (cheddar, maybe?).  Anyway, I might make this again, trying a few things to make it more palatable.

This recipe is not that good as written. I could see it being a hit with young kids but you definitely need to add 1/2 cup - 1 cup milk. I also only added half of the cooked noodles. 5 cups would've been way too much even with the addition of milk. I probably wouldn't make this again. I made it thinking the hubby would like it. He ate without complaint but then he tossed the leftovers without saying anything. If you half the noodles, add milk and some other spices I would rate this recipe a 3.

I made this tonight and it came out delish.  I don't really follow measurements too much.  I used 1 can cream of broccoli and on can of the cream of mush.  LOTS of ham and two onions.  Big hit.

This was good. I added a cup of milk as it was too sticky. Not sure if I will make again as it didn't really blow my socks off but it was nice and filling and the kids were satisfied.

This is easy and that what type of cooking I like.  The Children raved about it!  They have asked for it again that is why I am back on the site to pull it again.  THe one thing I did do to change the recipe is that I added spinich ( one package frozen ).  I wish I could take credit for this but I read someone elses posting here and theey were right.  I tasted it before without the spinich and it was missing a little something but once the spinich was added ooooo la la.

Eh. The kids didn't like the taste of the cheese sauce with the cream of mushroom soup and I wasn't crazy about the egg noodles. I think in the future we will stick to more traditional mac and cheese recipes and throw some ham into those if desired.

My husband absolutely loved this dish...I added garlic to the onion and ham, and near the end added some fresh mushrooms, and some chopped up red pepper.  I didn't have egg noodles, so I used linguine noodles...I new approach to Alfredo...Great recipe!

Definitely need a can of milk with this recipe.  I added onion powder, garlic powder, and some steamed broccoli.  It was good.  Maybe something I would make twice a year not a staple.

I used cream of bacon instead of cream of mushroom a cup of whole milk.  I also added garlic and garlic salt and baked it for 20 minutes with cheddar cheese and Italian breadcrumbs on top.  Turned out awesome!!

When made with the changes listed it is fantastic.  It should be rewriten so that it is clear that the first step is to sautee onions and garlic with the left over ham.  Then add soup and milk and cheeze. Super yummy and fast. My new go to recipe for left over ham.

Super easy, no fuss dinner!  I chose this to use up leftover Christmas ham and the kids LOVED it!  Grown ups too!  TIP: I added 3/4c milk because it is too thick otherwise.

This is a staple in our house.  I've been making it for years and years and we just love it.  I always use at least 1 1/2 cans soup, sometimes two, depending how much I feel I need to make it creamy and rich.  I also saute my ham and onion in margarine instead of oil.  I'm a seasoning fiend but just don't feel the need to add anything extra to this.  The cheese, ham and onion all provide enough flavor.  Thank you for passing on a wonderful recipe for others to enjoy!

I added milk too, and it was a good thing. I don't know if I'll make this again unless I have a ham leftovers that I just need to get rid of easily. Definitely won't go out of my way to make it.
