This recipe must be missing a liquid ingredient.  When I mixed everything together it was too dry to even form a dough.  I tried adding 2 eggs, but the finished cookies were very dry and spongy.

Not worth the effort. The dried cranberries added nothing but a strange texture.

By looking at this recipe and hearing reviews of being dry.  I decided to add an egg and some butter. Heres what I did:

In one bowl I mixed 1 1/2 c flour with 2t ginger and 1/2t cinnamon.  Also added 1/2t baking soda and 1/8t sea salt.  In a separate bowl I mixed together 1 T honey, 5T apple butter and 1/3c brown sugar(or coconut sugar)with 1 egg and 1/4c butter.  Then I added the 1t vanilla and zest of 2 oranges.  Then mix the dry and wet ingredients together.  Then stir in 1/3c + 1 or 2T of rolled oats.  Then bake on greased cookie sheets for 11-13 minutes.

The ginger and orange flavor are amazing!
