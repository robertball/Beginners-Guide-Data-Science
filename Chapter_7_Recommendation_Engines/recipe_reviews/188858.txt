My family loved this!  My husband made this with our little ones, so that tells you how easy it is to make!  He didn't bother cutting it in hearts since it's not currently Valentine's day. :)  thanks for a fun recipe!

Very gourmet at home! I chose to add a dollop of whipped cream. I could also see a raspberry coulis as a garnish as well. Thanks for sharing!
