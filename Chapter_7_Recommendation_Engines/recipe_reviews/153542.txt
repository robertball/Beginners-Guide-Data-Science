It came out really good. I didn't have any turkey so i used chicken instead. Also i added some more cheese, but make sure that you don't add to much because it gets really sticky.

This was just "ok" I will admit I didn't follow the recipe exactly - I didn't have egg noodles (just used normal macaroni noodles) and I added some spices (S&P, Garlic and Onion).
