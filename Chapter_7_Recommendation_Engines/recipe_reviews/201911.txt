Made this for the first time today.  We had company who are health conscious people, and they loved that it was simple yet had such wonderful flavor.  We as host also thought that this side was spectacular and can compliment many main dishes.  I will be making this regularly, and especially now that our tomatoes have have started to ripen on the vine!  Thanks for the recipe  Apricot20

You cannot go wrong with this salad.  A wonderful twist on Italian Caprese Insalata.  I always make the standard but now will add this to my repertoire.  Thanks for the idea!

What really makes this recipe is the addition of olives and let it sit at room temp for the full 15 mins before consuming...Tough to do because it looks so good but it does make a difference.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is the perfect example of eating vegetables in season and using the best ingredients you can afford!  Here in NJ, it's not tomato season yet but, once our tomatoes come in, we eat this salad with and without the cheese every day!  And, if you can, splurge on some really good olive oil--a little goes a long way!

This recipe is the perfect example that if you have fresh ingredients, you donâ€™t need endless steps and/or ingredients to make something delicious.  This is simply delightful and I'll be making this often with the tomatoes from the garden.

This is great, I love the Kalamata olives, they give a nice salty touch.  I drizzle of balsamic would be really good too, thanks!

This is so easy and elegant looking.  I used a variety of tomatoes as well (heirloom)which added more color.

Made this salad to go with a meatloaf dinner and we both enjoyed it very much. Nice fresh taste and nice and light. I did splash it with a little balsamic vinegar because tomatoes are not in season and they were not as flavorful as fresh ripe summer tomatoes.

I bet this is so good with fresh tomatoes.  I wanted something different for dinner tonight.  I used hot house tomatoes and it was still very good.  I had to put it away because I kept picking at it.  Not sure if it will keep for tomorrow's lunch but I'm willing to try.  Simple but divine.
