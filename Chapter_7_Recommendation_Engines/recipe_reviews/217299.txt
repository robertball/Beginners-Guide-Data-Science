This has some of my favorite salad ingredients. The only minus is the way too tart dressing. I added 1 tablespoon of splenda to cut the tartness and that really helped. Very good with the corrected dressing.

This was great! I made this for a dinner party and even my picky eaters went for seconds. I didn't have have sherry vinegar so used a mix of red wine and balsamic and scallions instead of shallots. But I think the best part about the salad was the goat cheese so don't leave that out.

This is a solid recipe.  Definitly get the mini beets, when I transferred this to the shopping list it defaulted to medium sized beets adn they were to big.  Also toss the salad and the beets separately and the beets won't stain the lettuce leaves.

Quick and easy.  You can do the beets a day ahead if you want to.  If you can't find baby beets, use one bunch of beets and cut them into quarters.  The mint really makes the salad!
