This was so easy to make and a great way to use left over lasagna ingredients!  I had extra lasagna noodles already made so I skipped the step with the water.  Also used spicy Italian pork sausage, loved the spice flavor I got BC this recipe is a one skillet meal!  Did I mention it was one skillet.  Easy clean up.  Will make again!
