I LOVED this recipe!  I used it at a special dinner last year and it got rave reviews.  I lost my printed copy and I was afraid I wouldn't find it again, but here it is!  I strongly recommend it.  :)

I liked it, my husband hated it. I would have preferred the pearl onions to be more tender - maybe I didn't cook it long enough. Hubby would like to try it without peanuts and cheese on top. I'll report back how it goes!

Fabulous family recipe, onions are soft and creamy and the peanut taste is fabulous!!!  The crumb topping gives it just the right bit of crunch. Even people who do not like onions love this!
