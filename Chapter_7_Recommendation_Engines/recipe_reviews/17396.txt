Forget all the other carrot cake recipes -- this is absolutely THE BEST !!  Have made this cake at least 20 times in the past year and everyone has raved about it.  Make it for birthdays at work (at least once a month) and recently for two baby showers.  Everyone thought it was bakery-made.  Was just asked to make it for a home wedding reception too (increased the recipe to 48 servings).  Couldn't be easier because of the carrot baby food -- no more shredding carrots.  What makes it even better is the frosting.  Used a combination of whipped cream and cream cheese (look in the frosting recipe section), and its not as heavy as cream cheese alone and it decorates and freezes well too.  If you had 10 stars, I'd give it 20!!!

Fantastic recipe - I couldn't stop eating it. Admittedly, I made a number of changes:
- Replaced half the flour with whole wheat (nutty flavor and better texture)
- Made my own mashed carrots by boiling carrots and blending the pieces
- Added some fresh, nonmashed, uncooked carrots - adds a LOT to the flavor
- Replaced about half of the oil with applesauce (homemade, I just peeled and blended some apples)
- Used fresh pineapple (or, I would suggest, get the canned pineapple rings and cut them up yourself - it was really nice to have small chunks of pineapple to bite into
- Jumbo raisins from Trader Joe's - absolutely FABULOUS to bite into!
- I also added a bit of nutmeg and ginger to balance the cinnamon

When I made this cake I put in all the ingredients in a bowl, mix it all together. I first tasted the mix from the bowl as I have sense I was a kid, and let me tell you it was the best thing I have ever tasted. I greased my pan put the mix in and baked it.
When it came out it was even better, moist, and rich, I njoy the carrot baby food taste in the cake it made the whole cake so delouses I have never had a carrot cake made with baby food. Again it  very good and out of this world my Compliments .

Excellent cake. Truthfully I only tried this recipe because I was curious that the rating for it was only one star but the review that went with the rating seemed very complimentary - thus piqued I took the recipe to the proof - my three teen age sons - and it passed with flying colors!

A very different spin on the old stand by carrot cake. Nice touch with the pineapple!   UPDATE: I took this recipe and minus the pineapple, nuts, raisins. Cut it by a serving of 18 and put in a jelly roll pan. Made a carrot cake roll with my fav cream cheese frostings.

Great basic recipe!  I cut back on the oil to just one cup. I added on half cup of applesauce. I also added 1 cup of shredded carrots. This cake was so very moist and flavorful. I left out the nuts  and coconut as the youngsters dislke them. Awesome, awesome, awesome!

This cake was an hit at my house. The cake was so moist and had great flavor. I also tried it with the whipped cream chesse frosting. My husband was making fun of the baby food but when he tasted it he said that he did not care what it had in it I had to make it again. Both of my sons came back for seconds and they just loved it. This is a must keep recipe for me!!!

I used this recipe to make carrot cake cupcakes for Easter and they were a hit! I used two jars of baby food and three small, grated carrots. I also used extra-moist "baking raisins" that I found in my grocery store. Those were the only modifications. This made 24 large cupcakes (bake for 25-30 minutes at 350 degrees). I frosted with the whipped cream cream cheese icing and there were none left. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I made this exactly as instructed, except I omitted the raisins and put the nuts on top of the icing.  I made it for Easter and it was a great hit - the best compliment of all - my nephew said it was better than his mom's!

Delicious! Very easy and moist. This is the first homemade carrot cake I have made and it turned out wonderful. I grated 1 carrot into the batter for looks and texture and also added a little ginger, per other reviewers. Frosted with "cream cheese frosting II" from this site. I will definitely make again!

This is very close to the recipe that my grandma used to use when I was little.  I'm so glad to be able to make it now also.  My mom and dad went crazy when they found out I made this and had to come over for some.  It really is one of the best carrot cake recipes out there.  Thanks for sharing!

Easy and delicious!  I used 2 9-inch round pans instead of 9x13 and just kept an eye on it for when it would spring back.

Oh my goodness this was great. I used this recipe in my foods 1 class and it worked so well. My students were shocked that it had baby food in it. They ate it up. I had faculty come up and ask for the recipe as well. Didn't change a thing Great recipe will definitely use again and again.

I really liked this.  It was my first attempt at carrot cake and it was pretty easy.  I did add about a cup of shredded carrots from my garden too.  It was a little dense for my taste.  Got to figure out how to solve that.

Admittedly, I tinkered.  Left out raisins, used less nuts and big pineapple chunks.  Used 2 jars babyfood, and 4 oz of grated carrots.  And a large springform pan.  My first thought was that this was WAY too runny (I wondered if it was the babyfood...it was very liquid and ran out of the jar).  I added in a bit of flour at the end.  I also had to cook it closer to an hour and 10 minutes.  When the toothpick was clean enough to indicate a done middle, the outside was a bit more well done than I like.  BUT, this was still a GREAT recipe.  It wasn't sickeningly sweet, and was a great balance for a typical cream cheese frosting.  My mother in law RAVED.  I will be making this again.  But will use ALL grated carrots.  It is still super easy with a Magic Bullet.  Thanks a lot!  :)
