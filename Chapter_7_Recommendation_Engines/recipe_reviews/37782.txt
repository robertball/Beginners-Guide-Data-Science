Quand nous faisons ceci, nous substituons les fragments de pomme de terre pour la céréale. La céréale le fait mauvais. L'essayer avec les fragments de pomme de terre. Il est merveilleux. 

(When we make this, we substitute potato chips for the cereal. The cereal makes it bad. Try it with the potato chips. It is wonderful.)

This is one of my favorite recipes and I have used it for years.  My family ALL like it, and it is a great dish to take for church dinners, etc.  It can be made ahead and frozen.  When I make it for just the two of us,I divide it into two or three portions, cook one and freeze the others.

Excellent & easy potatoes! I reduced the cornflake topping by half, which WAS very good but next time, I'll try it with potato chips or no topping at all (just to try it and see how it goes).

This is a very good recipe! I took it to a potluck dinner and it was all gone by the end! Not only does it taste great, but it also smells good!

Was not as creamy as I would have liked. Maybe add one more can of soup?

Good and easy...I used a 1/2 of onions instead of 1 cup and it was great.

Easy and Flexible. Loved it with sausage instead of onions and cream of mushroom soup.

This was really good. I used Ritz crackers on top, b/c I didn't have the cereal, and added a packet of ranch dressing mix, b/c I like the tangy-ness it gives. Yummy!!

I don't really care for frozen potatoes, so I made fresh hash browns. This was very good.

This recipe wasn't very good.  I added bacon-flavored breakfast sausage, which I think helped.  I took other's advice and used potatoe chips instead of corn flakes.  My boyfriend thought the taste of cream of chicken was too odd, and that maybe I should have used cream of celery soup instead.  If I ever make it again, which is doubtful, I would try the celery soup.  The dish tastes like something you would find at one of those cheap all-you-can-eat buffet places.  It is quick and easy, though.
