So easy and yet so good - the classics never die! This was perfect to throw together for a quick and easy weeknight meal.  I used a store bought coleslaw and didn't bother combining it with the dressing but rather drizzled a little dressing over top before pressing the sandwiches back together and served it with additional dressing on the side if needed.  This was delicious served with kettle cooked chips and a dill pickle on the side!

It's so nice to find out that we are not the only ones who user coleslaw instead of sauerkraut.  Usually we use rye, pumpernickel or sour dough bread.  The pretzel rolls were a great change.
