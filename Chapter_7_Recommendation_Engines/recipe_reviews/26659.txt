This recipe was really tasty and easy. I made the marinade, put the steak tips in a crock pot poured over the marinade and cooked for 5 hours. The tips were falling apart and the marinade made a great flavor. I served over egg noodles. I will definately make this again. Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious!  Have tried this MANY times, and it is wonderful, especially when cooked over charcoal with mesquite wood chips.  You can actually reduce the recipe by half (but keep 2 lbs of beef) and put the tips into a zippered freezer bag.  Then you can make a whole bunch and freeze what you're not ready to cook yet.  Also, the type of salad dressing and barbecue sauce make a big difference!  Try with your favorite brands first, and then go from there.  I've found some salad dressings to be too salty.  Finally, add 1 tsp of meat tenderizer to shorten the marinade time and make the beef deliciously tender.

I converted this into a crockpot recipe by making about 2/3 of the marinade, but cutting the Wor. sauce way down, to only about a teaspoon (because of the salt) and adding about 1/4 cup water.  I used some round steaks and poured the sauce over them, added a small sliced red onion and a small bag of baby carrots.  Cooked everything all day on low.  Thickened the liquid at the end with a flour/water slurry, and served this with Garlic Red Mashed Potatoes and toasted Challah bread and butter.  Good and really easy!

Easy and delicious! I cut the recipe in half for a pound of sirloin. I used Kraft light italian dressing and Bull's Eye BBQ sauce. I didn't have garlic pepper seasoning so I used minced garlic and a couple dashes of Montreal Steak seasoning. I poked the steak a few times with a fork and placed everything into a ziploc bag and let it marinate all day. I turned it a few times during the marinating process. I definitely recommend marinating longer than an hour for optimum results.

I found a package of Sirloin Broil in my freezer last night. I had no idea what Sirloin Broil even was, let alone what to do with it! So, I typed in Sirloin Broil in the ingredient browser and read through the recipes. I came across this one and oh my goodness I am so glad I did!! Simple ingredients worked magic on the steaks. I lessened the amount of ingredients used only because the steaks I had weren't very big. I threw the marinade in a ziptop bag as well as a touch of meat tenderizer because I wasn't sure what cut of meat I was working with, tossed in my steaks, squished it all around, and set it in the fridge. When I got home from work 8 hours later, took the steaks out of the fridge, let it rest on the counter for about a half hour to come to room temperature and threw 'em on the grill. This recipe is outstanding, and it will be a favorite in my household!! Thank you so much for sharing your recipe :)

I wasn't sure what sirloin tips were so I bought 2 beautiful sirloin steaks (2.5lbs) for this recipe, then cut them into kabob pieces myself.  We marinated the chunks overnight (made the recipe as written, except I subbed 1t garlic powder and 1t pepper for the garlic pepper, plus I added 1t of meat tenderizer per Zipporah) and grilled them along with Unbelievable Chicken Marinade kabobs for our first family BBQ.  Everyone raved!!  My father-in-law even asked for both recipes... a definite first!  So easy!!

This was pretty good; I would probably make it again. 
 I can't understand how some reviewers can rate a recipe (especially poorly) when they didn't follow the recipe and/or directions! This recipe doesn't say anything about a crockpot... Shesh.

We made this last night on the grill.  It was pretty good but I found the marinade didn't penetrate the steaks much and I let it marinade at least 4 hours.  Since we liked the overall flavor, next time I will just reserve a little of the marinade to use as a dipping sauce.  Thanks for the recipe!

We thought this was pretty good.  I didn't have garlic pepper, so used 1/2 tsp of granulated garlic and 1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper.  Served with Roasted New Potatoes & Sugar Snap Peas with Mint, each from this website.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Deanna!

LOVE IT!! Absolutely delicious! I did exactly what the recipe said plus I added 1/4 cup of honey. I marinated it over night. My husband bbq it for about 10 minutes than brought it inside and popped it in the oven at 325 for about 10 more minuets. It was SO juicy and delicious!! We also had grilled some walla walla sweet onions! Next time I have company, this is what I am making! I will use this recipe again and again!

So easy!  It really adds an interesting, delicious flavor to steaks and chicken.  I don't have garlic pepper seasoning, so I add minced garlic and freshly ground pepper to my marinade.  I will never have another naked steak on the grill again!

My very picky beau LOVED his steak with this marinate.  It was simple and used everyday ingredients.  I used some very thinly sliced round sirloin steaks, put them in a ziplock with the marinate to soak all day and broiled them for five minutes!  Perfect!!!  He requested that I flag this recipe for safe keeping!

I followed the actual recipe with my favorite brands except I didn't have the garlic pepper. So I used 1 tsp. Garlic Salt and 1/2 tsp. black pepper. This recipe had a fire/sweet taste, and was delicious!  I marinated for 6 hours, and the sirloin steak that I cut up turned out so amazing. I didn't grill, I seared them on top of the stove.
I kept half of the prepared sauce out, separate for gravy for the homemade mashed potatoes.  Heated it on top of the stove just like gravy, perfect! Added grilled pineapple, creamed corn and crusty french bread. Final results are in the picture, of course I had to sprinkle it with pepper too when I'm done, love that stuff. This recipe turned out amazing! I will use again and again.
*Favorite Brands used: Kraft: Zesty Italian & Sweet Baby Ray's for the BBQ Sauce

Favorite! This recipe reminds me SO MUCH of a place I used to purchase tips from in Medord, MA (Bob's on Main St.). This marinade makes the most tender tips from a very inexpensive cut of meat. Great with rice pilaf and a spring mix salad!

We didn't love this - the flavor of the marinade totally overpowered the flavor of the sirloin tips.  I think I would prefer this with either the bbq sauce OR the italian dressing but not both.

Um ... Wow ... this is good.  Made exactly as written.  I thought it would be above average, but this is great.  The BBQ sauce really makes this.  Don't use the cheap stuff.  This blended nice.  EDIT:  THIS TIME used a better cut of meat (NY strip)  This is only second to the "Montreal Steak Marinade" that is on the side of the bottle of Seasoning.

We didn't like this.  Mostly it tasted like a wierd bbq sauce.  Maybe it was just the style of bbq sauce that I used, but I won't be making this again.  I really think that the success or failure of this depends on the bbq sauce that you use.

I was totally disappointed in this recipe. It didn't tenderize the meat at all (I used a fair cut of tenderloin) and it masked the flavor. I think this is for the people who like to douse their steaks in A-1.

I thought this was a very good marinade, however, I like mine a little spicier, so I added some cayenne pepper as well to boost the flavor. Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful! This recipe changed my taste in steak. I don't have a grill, so instead I pan fried the steaks, slowly adding marinade.

This marinade is wonderful! I have tried others, but this is the best. Works well with all types of beef. I marinade whatever beef I plan on cooking about 3-4 hours in this mixture, then I grill it, you don't even need steak sauce! Thanks!

This recipe is amazing!  My husband absolutely adores it.  He even dips his bread in the marinade, and sops it up off his plate after he's done eating!  We have made this recipe many times, and it's one of our favorites.  Thanks!

Awesome recipe.  I used Italian red wine vinegar in place of the italian dressing and for the BBQ sauce I used  Jack Daniels hickory brown sugar.

I can't wait to make this for company and not tell them what I did!  I didn't use garlic pepper (I don't care for pepper) but I did add garlic powder.  Oh yeah, I used this on tri tip.  I over cooked the meat and yet it was still tender!!!  I have extra marinaded and plan on trying it with chicken! :)  Thanks again! *Update. cut tri tip in half while marinating.  I left it whole today and even after 8 hrs it wasn't long enough.  I think 24 would would be great!  I don't think you can over marinate!

This marinade was ok. I made it according to the recipe but like others cooked it in a slow cooker. The meat turned out tender and moist. I found the marinade to be a little too sweet for me. I think I might try this again but add some chili pepper sauce and/or crushed red peppers and cut back on the bar b que sauce or use a different kind that has some kick.

GREAT FLAVOR!  I was leery about using BBQ sauce in a marinade, but after reading the other reviews; I decided to try it. Glad I did!  I used a bold and spicy BBQ sauce with a robust Italian dressing.  I marinated  a whole sirloin tip steak for seven hours.  This allowed the flavor to go through the meat and yet not overpower the natural flavor of the steak.  I’m anxious to try different BBQ sauces and Italian dressings to see what other flavors I’ll get.  I only made half the amount of marinade and it was plenty.

OMG, this was a BIG hit at my house tonight-- my extremely picky husband raved about it, and I really loved it too.  It will be my go-to marinade from now on!    Please note that I cut the recipe in half because I was cooking for only my husband and me-- and I wasn't making steak tips-- I did two 8 oz. steaks, and had plenty of marinade.    I did make a couple of changes (though I'm sure it's fantastic exactly as written!).  I cut the worcestershire down by 75% because I am limiting my sodium; and I didn't have garlic pepper seasoning, so I used a heaping teaspoon of minced garlic and 1/8 tsp black pepper.  Marinated for 24 hours and on the grill they went.  No need to even put steak sauce on the table when you serve steaks marinated in this.  Tender, juicy and flavorful!!!  I can't wait to try it on chicken :)

I loved this recipe.  I used Wish Bone fat free Italian dressing and Jack Daniels original No. 7 recipe barbecue sauce. The Marinade was great and would be just as good on chicken too.   My boyfriend did not care for this, but he doesnt tend to like marinaded steak.

It seemed odd to combine Italian dressing with BBQ sauce, but this is a wonderful recipe!  It has such a unique flavor and my dinner guests just loved it!  I added papaya to act as a tenderizer and I don't think it affected the flavor of the recipe.  Very delicious!

Pretty easy marinade to put together. I added in some ketchup to balance the other flavors and make it not so strong. I marinated a tri tip roast cut into large wedges overnight. Then, I cut them into bite size cubes and marinated for a couple more hours. Next time, I'll marinate the cubes overnight to take advantage of the good marinade flavor.

Wow this is a great recipe.  I used this marinade on a 2 lb. boneless sirloin tip roast.  Allowed to marinate all day.  Roasted with tatters and carrots.  I poured the marinade in the bottom of the pan and added a little water.  Used come of the juice on top of the roast.  Yummy.  Will be making again.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

this marinaded 2 days. i had some tough sirloin steaks. they were frozen and i cut them more like slivers and made rice and cooked over medium heat with a small amount of veggie oil with the sauce. it was wonderful. tasted like terrayaki beef jerky but much moister. i served with an asian salad and not enough rice. 2 lbs of steak  and 1 cup of rice was not enough...no leftovers for just 2 folks. try it.

A great marinade with readily available refridgerator items.  I quartered this recipe, perfect for two smallish strip steaks.  I marinated overnight & the steaks were tender and very flavorful.  I'll use this recipe many more times, thanks!

My daughter mixed some of this up a couple days ago to marinade some round steaks I was going to grill.  The steaks sat in the marinade for two full days before grilling.  The flavor was very good, but it could have used a little salt.  My younger daughter usually insists on having steak sauce for her steaks, but she ate 1-1/2 steaks with this marinade without once asking if we had any steak sauce (we didn't).  I'll use this again, adding 1 tsp of salt next time.  I can't wait to try it on chicken!  Thanks for sharing!

In place of Italian dressing I used Vidalia Onion Vinegarette.  For garlic pepper I used garlic salt with black pepper.  Followed the directions otherwise, and it was phenominal!  Thank you very much for the idea.

Used a fat free Italian dressing. Really good marinade. Also cooked down as a good sauce.

This was sooo good! I used it on some fast fry steak that was VERY thin. I was only able to marinade it for 3 hours, and it was still delicious! I didn't have, nor have I heard of garlic pepper, so I used minced garlic/ground pepper like another person said. My husband and I are not big red meat eaters, but we could have eaten more easily!!!!

This was only okay for me.  I marinaded the steak overnight but the flavors were still a little bit bland.  I might attempt this recipe again but possibly add a tbsp. of sugar or honey to the marinade.

It's good and unique.. not BBQ but not your run of the mill marinade.  I've made this twice, cutting the recipe by half.  My marinade times have only been a little over an hour, and they still turn out flavorful.

Psst... I add 1/2 tbsp of Italian dressing mix/seasoning to the marinade, and I season the steaks with the Montreal steak seasoning.  Make sure to let your steaks come to room temp before throwing them on the grill.

This is my second time using this marinade. I made these tips for guest and they were blown away! So was I! So tender and delicious. The only thing this recipe needs is a few added spices. I used spicy McCormick. It was absolutely perfect.

Oh my goodness!  It was *so* good...we ended up broiling the steaks (top sirloin thin cut) for about 15-20 minutes total.  I was only able to marinate for 1.5 hours, and still felt the flavors absorbed enough to notice.  I served it with cooked orange squash, and mushroom-flavored couscous (from a box).  The three dishes made an excellent meal.

We use this marinade all the time.. It makes the steak tips taste sooooo good.. The longer you marinade them the better they taste.. So put them in early in the morning or even the night before you plan to have them..

Very good, I used the slow cooker and used only 1/3 c worch sauce, added 1/4 c water, no garlic pepper powder so I added 2 tsp garlic powder and 1 tsp black pepper, also added 1/2 green pepper, 1 onion and 2 carrots, put on low and cooked all day.

I made this a couple of nights ago for my husband...he loved it, as did I. I'm planning to use it for a "Welcome Home" BBQ for my brother-in-law who is returning home from Iraq in July! I used chuck strips...they seem to have more flavor. I also feel that the BBQ sauce you use is very important to the outcome of this recipe. Thanks for a keeper!

Okay this was amazing.  But garlic pepper?  I don't have that on hand so I substituted about a tsp. of garlic powder.  I used tri tip cut into small pieces and it turned out so flavorful.  I will definitely make this one again.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe. UPDATE:  I've made this more times than I can count now.  I even have the garlic pepper now but I think it is equally good with the substitutions.  Love this recipe.

This marinade is so easy and so tasty.  I marinated a tri-tip roast and roasted it in the oven.  My husband ate every last bite and he's extremely picky.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  YUM!

I was looking for a recipe that tasted like one I had had before, and this wasnt it, but it was still good!  It is missing something, though, and I'm not sure what.  I may try adding ketchup next time.  Thanks!  I'll make this one again.

I quadrupled this recipe and used it to marinate 9 pounds of tip roast sliced into steaks.  It was fantastic.  Very flavorful and juicy.

I also added some habanero sauce to a portion for those who like spicier food (including me) and it was even better.

Enjoyed it tremendously,  marinated the meat for 24 hours, skewered with sweet onion, pineapple, red and yellow pepper as well as mini portobello's, put them on the coals and grilled until done.  Side dish were basmati rice pilaf and grilled asparagus.   Great meal,  excellent marinade.  Only grievance,  sodium.  I'm going to come up with a way to make it a far more cardiac-friendly recipe without sacrificing phenomenal tatse.  Anyone who has such a recipe already, please feel free to message or email me.

Super yummy. Pretty much fool proof. I didn't measure liquid ingred's exactly. Added a ton of dry spices ei paprika reg and smoked, chili powder, onion and garlic powder, cayenne, chinese 5 spice, italian herbs, pepper, lemon pepper, and grilling spice mix. Probably could never duplicate exactly but the base is so good you can spice it up any way you like. Great marinade and/or sauce.

I followed the recipe exactly as in, at first we were going to grill but then it got rainy so I tossed it all in the crock pot and just let it go all day on low.  It tasted amazing!  I put the steak tips over egg noodles but really would be good over rice or with any side.  Cant wait to try it on the grill I def think it will be equally amazing!

Because I find our steak meat is inconsistently tender, I throw the meat and marinade in a crockpot for about 5-6 hours.  Then preheat grill on high and put tips on grill for about 1 minute each side just to sear.  Yummy and tender.  Also, quality bbq sauce is a must.  I also use Newman's Own Lite Italian dressing.  It is the lowest in sodium that I can find (260mg/serving)

I LOVED this. It's perfection. I used creamy Italian and only 2 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce, put it in my slow cooker and WHOA BUDDY. This even has my 11 month old wanting more. It's amazing. I'll be lucky if there are any leftovers!

I didn't have time to marinade the steaks so I just combined the ing. in the pan & cooked them slowly with onions. Also didn't have garlic pepper so just used steak seasoning. Very good! We will definitely use this again.

Great recipe, I modified it by using oil & vinegar instead of bottled dressing.  I then added corn starch at the end to thicken the sauce.

This is a good recipe, my family didn't really like it because it tastes like it should be on chicken instead of steak, maybe I will try that sometime.

I've been making steak tips for YEARS - tried numerous marinades.  

This is the BEST recipe I have ever used - 

My family flipped out there wasn't one steak tip left over after dinner.

I used 3 1/4 lbs of steak tips- and didn't adjust the other ingredients at all. 

Therefore, if the flavor was as fabulous as it was- I think it's ok to use more meet less marinade ( I believe some of the other reviews I read stated the same thing ) 

Another keeper !

I LOVE this Recipe, I make it at least once a week. The only change I do is instead of garlic-pepper seasoning, I use 1 clove fresh garlic and a teaspoon of steak spice. Also, I usually half everything, as this recipe makes a lot.

This was really good!! I halved the recipe & I didn't have any garlic pepper seasoning so I used regular garlic powder & ground pepper. It was very good & a nice change to the usual BBQ sauce!

Followed recipe exactly with Ken's lite northern italian dressing, Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce (reg) and separate garlic powder and pepper (about 1/2 tsp of each since I did not have garlic pepper blend), marinated 2 lbs sirloin steak tips overnight after pricking them with a fork, and the whole family loved them off the grill tonight served with rice pilaf and steamed broccoli. This one is a keeper - thanks for sharing!

I am still cooking this and seems to be tough.  Marinated for 6 hours.  I did poke it with a fork before also.  Anything I can do to tenderize more.  Smells and looks good.  two stars so far.

Previous times when I've tried to make tip steaks they have turned out tough and flavourless.  This is the first piece of steak in my life that I've enjoyed eating.  I don't love meat but this was absolutely phenomenal flavour. I highly recommend (and my husband does too!).

I have made this repeatedly for my family and friends.  I have bought the steak tips, made the marinade and frozen.  Defrosted and just grilled them last week after about 6-7 weeks in the freezer and they were excellent.  The Italian dressing in the recipe adds oil so they don't stick to the grill.  I enjoy a stronger BBQ flavor, so I baste one side of the steak with additional sauce as they cook.  Excellent recipe!

I used round steaks and I didn't think about marinading this, so I put all the ingredients in a pot on the stove and covered it and let it simmer for 1-2 hours. I also added some liquid smoke to bring out the flavor as well as some meat tenderizer. The meat was juicy and tender and tasted great!

Tons of flavour in this one!  I used Bulls Eye BBQ sauce and garlic powder/pepper instead of the seasoning.  I also added a tablespoon of hot sauce. Edit: I used this on chicken tonight and it was awesome!

My tips came out so tender and flavorful!  I added some meat tenderizer to the marinade and marinaded overnight.  The result was amazing tips.  I used 3.5 lbs of tips and it seemed to be plenty to coat all of them. I will be using this recipe all summer long!

This marinade is really quite good. Everyone loves it, and has become a family favorite. Looking forward to using it this summer. The only thing I did differently was sometimes we like to change it up so we tried different dressings. We change the dressing to the what ever oil base dressing we have or like. We've tried Newman's garllic,italian and balsamic. They all seem to work. It's good with all pork,beef and chicken just like the original recipe. One other change we have made was to 
change the Worcestershire sauce to A1 Sauce and the flavor was amazing. A big thank you to Domenici::))

This marinade was great!  My family loved it!  My steaks got about 4 hours in the marinade and they were perfect.  I think if you left them too long, the flavor might get a little too strong.  At 4 hours, it was wonderful!  I actually didn't change a thing with this one!!  Thanks for sharing!!!

Pretty darn good.  I admit- after reading reviews, I did more of a 60/40 blend- less bbq to italian- cause from experience I know bbq sauce can overpower.  I used good seasonings italian dressing and plain bbq sauce- no smoky, honey or anything like that- cause I think you could end up with a weird flavor.  I marinated overnight- and I think I could have let it sit longer- Im really into flavored meat.  But it was still good- and different- not the same ol same ol.

I wasn't sure how well the combination of bbq sauce and italian dressing would be but it tastes GREAT!
My family loves this marinade. I have made it many times. I use open pit original bbq sauce because it is mild and doesn't overpower ther other ingredients.
I often use this on sirloin, just let it marinate overnight and it is oh so yummy.

I have made this several times.  Great recipe as it is.  I do recommend that you half the recipe, otherwise you will have alot of waste, especially if you only do 1 lb as the recipe call for.  I usually do close to 2 lbs. 

I also think a spicy bbq sauce over a sweet one makes it better.  I use Famous Dave's Rich and Sassy.

This was very very good. Steaks came out tender and juicy. I used balsamic vinegarette instead of Italian dressing and it was delicious.

The family results are in, and this is the new marinade I'll be using from now on.  Even my daughter, who hates steak, gave it a try and enjoyed it!  I served the tips with caramelized onions and garlic/lemon sauteed mushrooms on the side.  A real keeper~~thanks!

Good taste but I used a sweet BBQ sauce and it carmelized, making the steak taste a little burnt.  I'd use a smoky BBQ sauce next time.

Very good.  Big hit with everyone in the family, including the fussy 5 year old.  I halved the marinade recipe and still had plenty left to boil to serve with the tips after cooking.  You can use lemon pepper in place of half the garlic pepper for a little extra punch of flavor.

Thought this was a little too sweet for beef, but I will definitely try again with chicken this time.  Good recipe, I guess I'm just not a huge fan of "sweeter" marinades on beef.  Bring on the salt for me.

I was looking for a good beef marinade that was light on the bbq sauce flavor.  I saw this one, and decided to give it a test drive.  I followed the directions exactly as written. The flavor was wonderful! It will be a regular for our family.  Thanks!

Nothing spectacular. I almost gave it 3 stars but had to give it 4 because it was a convenient recipe. It called for ingredients that I always have on hand. I was hopeful when I read the reviews but it wasn't a big hit at the table. I used it with chicken breast and grilled them - maybe it would have been better with beef.

this was delicious. I used a london broil, cut it into cubes and sauted them. Then took them out, reduced the liquid, added some port wine and a tablespoon of butter. Used that over the steak cubes and roasted potatoes. This is definitely on our do-again list!

Very good marinade.  I did let my steak marinate overnight and pierced it with a fork.  Wasn't as flavorful as I'd like but I kept some sauce on the side to dip it in so that helped.

I can't say the BBQ was overpowering, like other users have said. This WAS so good on the grill! Let it marinade the full-time, however.

A great marinade. I was going to give it 5 stars but think you could slightly reduce the BBQ sauce so it won't overpower the other ingredients. I will make again with reduced BBQ sauce.  I agree to let the meat marinate overnight, if possible, or you can freeze your meat in it, cook it later.

This elegant and easy marinade has, after a long search, found a place at the top of my list.  I've used it on several cuts of beef - it's great with London Broil.

This marinade can be easily punched up to suit individual tastes (I like to toss is some crushed red pepper), but it great used just as presented.

Terrific Marinade!  We used it on chicken breasts (marinaded for 2 hours) and was great.  We are looking forward to trying it on beef.  Thanks for a great marinade recipe.  It is a family favorite after just one use!

I can't wait to make this again!  I think it will be just as good on chicken or pork chops as it was on sirloin steak.

I used KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce and made italian dressing from a mix and substituted equal parts garlic powder and black pepper for the garlic pepper.

This marinade is soooooo good!  My husband said it was the best steak tip dinner he ever had.  Now we have them once a week.  I didn't have any garlic pepper so I used equal parts garlic powder and black pepper.  Delicious!!  Oh, and I used Good Seasons Italian dressing (it makes one cup exactly when you prepare it).

This was excellent.  Mixed up my own Italian Dressing (olive oil, cider vinegar, sugar, oregano (lots), italian seasoning, black pepper, salt, garlic powder, onion powder).  I used Bull's Eye BBQ sauce and like another reviewer found the marinade a bit too sweet when the sauce carmelized in cooking.  (The marinade had tasted fine when I mixed it.)  Next time I'll use a bit less BBQ sauce or lower the sugar amount in my italian dressing.  

Still, this was a wonderful marinade.  Used it to marinate the meat for shish kabobs.

My whole family loved the steaks I made with this recipe! It really had nice flavor without being over-powering.  I have used it on T-bones and Top Sirloin. I didn't have a garlic/pepper blend so I used a few good shakes of regular black pepper and a dash of garlic powder.  I also used Bullseye BBQ sauce (unlike a previous review using Bullseye, I didn't find it too sweet. Maybe it was the dressing that was used?) Thank you for an easy to make great-tasting marinade!

I used Nadia's substitution's and left it for 72-96 hours before grilling sirloin strips. Unbeleivable taste and flavor. Very easy to make.

Thought this was very good.  I broiled some steaks after marinating in this for about 5 hours.  I was happy to find a marinade that did not include soy sauce in the ingredients.  I will use this again but for broiling I might add just a little liquid smoke.

Pretty good, but came out VERY sweet, probably because I used Bullseye barbecue sauce.  I will definitely try this again with a bbq sauce that isn't quite so sweet.

I made per the recipe, except cooked in a cast iron skillet instead of grilling. It was overpowering in the flavor from the sauce.

I tried this for my family and it didn't go over well. It seems to be too tangy for our taste. Will have to do a lot of trial and error to get the right taste for us.

Tried this for a marinade for sirloin tips and veggies to grill on a skewer. Didn't have Italian dressing so used some lime vinaigrette dressing instead. Amazing! This would be a good steak sauce for dipping as well. Next time will save some aside before marinating.

Oh dear, we tried this using the slow cooker as one of the reviews stated. It was terrible! Salty and the flavors were overpowering for a steak. I should have known better than to use bbq sauce on steak, but I figured all of the reviews couldn't be wrong. Maybe I went wrong with the slow cooker, but this was a cheap marinade that cheapened the meat. (These are my family's words.) I wouldn't even give this sirloin to my dog.

Updated review: The marinade is fantastic.  The trick is to cook the meat low and slow and let it soak up all the marinade while cooking.

I liked the marinade a lot but the tips I cooked were not at all moist.  That may have been user error in cooking though.  def will try the marinade on a different cut in the future.

It’s recipes like this that I love the most because it’s not a recipe that would ever hit my radar and then  it turns out to be an amazing 5 Star recipe!   I was looking for a steak marinade and chose this particular recipe because I had an old bottle of Italian dressing and BBQ sauce that needed used.    I did not have garlic pepper, so I used a blend of garlic powder and ground pepper.  Much to my surprise, this had a wonder teriyaki flavor that lead me to the idea of threading on kabobs with onions, peppers, mushrooms, and pineapple.   This one is going in the keeper file and one that I look forward to serving at my next BBQ.

We LOVED it. I actually didn't have any Italian dressing so it's probably very different. But honestly I'd omit it again because it was so good.

I grilled them on Satuday afternoon almost 48 hrs later and WOW where they good. Savory and sweet. I made no changes other than to triple the recipie. Try this one you wont be sorry.

My wife said it was good, I did not like this at all. I am giving it 3 stars because so many have loved it and I have seen mention of having the right dressing and the right BBQ sauce, maybe I didn't. Either way, I will not make again, I cannot see there being a big enough difference to make it worth trying again. It is very edible I've just had many better marinades. (cooked steak tips over charcoal - medium). I would recommend cutting the recipe in half and only marinate a few tips, to try it out the first time. If you like it, your in. If not you have saved the ingredients and the steak.

This marinade is absolutely delicious and so easy! I used slightly less Worcestershire so it wouldn't be overly salty and let it marinate for about four hours. Perfection! My very picky husband also loved this.

moist and delish.  broiled it in my over a minute too long though.  a minute less each side would have made a perfect medium.  I think it turned out medium well, still good though.

This was easy to make, but it was just okay. I like my steak to have a little bit more flavor to it. Normally, I just put on montreal steak spice and throw it on the grill. My husband wanted to marinate them, so I tried this one.

Good recipe. I used it for about 3 pounds of beef and then only used 1/4 cup of Worcestershire. I used the original 3/4 at first, but found that it was far too salty. As for the bbq sauce, I used a favorite honey bbq one and it gave a great twist. I also used the Italian Restaurant-Style Dressing by Barb, found on this site, for the Italian dressing and it was superb. I would recommed that anyone doing this recipe, poke thier beef with a fork over the entire piece of meat front and back before marinating to ensure the flavor sets in.

Excellent! My hubs and I have been making and eating steak tips for years, and this is absolutely right up there with the best marinades we've tried. I believe Domenici when he says it took many experiments for this one. Thanks for sharing!

Great, but make sure you marinade it for at least 8 hours to get the wonderful flavors.

I didn't care for this marinade.  The bbq sauce was over-powering and made the steak really really sweet.  I used a no-name bbq sauce so maybe it's better with a more expensive brand.  My son who puts bbq on everything enjoying it!

GREAT!  I had a round roast to use and marinaded it in this sauce for about 45 minutes.  I saved some of the marinade for basting as well.  The next day, I put the steak and the rest of the marinade into the slow cooker to make pulled, bbq beef.  The beef cooking in the marinade all day was wonderful!

Excellent marinade. I used it with Boneless Pork Chops and let it marinate in the refrigerator for 8 hours in a zip top bag then grilled the chops over a charcoal fire.  A big thumbs up from the whole family.

Used Hunt's Original BBQ sauce and Kraft Free Italian Dressing.  Marinated for 5-6 hours.  You could definitely taste the Worcestershire Sauce more than anything else.  So, if you don't like Worcestershire Sauce, you need to decrease the amount.  I like this marinade better than a strictly Italian dressing marinade but it's still missing something.  Would make again but won't make it to impress anyone.

Yes, made twice now. First time as stated. Great! Modified second time. Nope. Wonderful as is. Don't need steak sauce. Tastes better as leftovers.

I rarely cook steak, so I tried this recipe for my family. We LOVED it! I added a little meat tenderizer. Leftovers made the best steak salad ever.

Never thought I'd put BBQ sauce on a steak.  Wow!  I'm not much of a steak marinade fan - excuse me, wasn't.  I am now.  I'm preparing it tonight for the 3rd time.  Will repeat often.  PS - I had one friend who prefers pork.  I did 2 pork steaks - another WOW!

I did not have garlic pepper, so I substituted garlic salt and added freshly ground pepper. I used a london broil and cut it into 3 pieces before marinating for 8 hours. This was wonderful! The marinade is tasty and tangy and just delicious! I will try it next time with the garlic pepper.

The only change I made in the marinade was due to not having garlic pepper.  I replaced it with 1/2 tsp minced garlic and 1/2 tsp Montreal Steak Spice.  Our steaks marinaded for 5 hours.  The flavor so so good and reminiscent of traditional BBQ that there were no leftovers!

Easy to make and doesn't call for exotic ingredients. I prepared the night before and let marinade in the fridge overnight.  It really tenderized the sirloins I had.   Delicious.

This is a really good marinade!  I love worcestershire sauce, so I didn't think it was too strong (as some of the reviews indicate).  I used sirloin tip steaks, which I cut into smaller pieces.  They only took about 4 minutes per side on the grill to get well done.  I didn't have garlic pepper, so I used minced garlic and black pepper.  I would cut the marinade ingredients in half next time, as I had a lot left over.  I'll definitely make this recipe again, though I may try it on pork or chicken next.

This marinade makes any meat taste good.  I have used this for steak, salmon, and chicken.  Makes the meat moist and delicious.  I have even marinaded the meat for only 15 minutes before and it still was OK.  But definitely recommend marinade as long as you can.

1/11/2020 - 1/2 the recipe is plenty for 2 pounds of meat!  Again 5 stars - very good, easy and would recommend tenderizing the meat and marinating for 4 or more hours!

7/4/2006 - Excellent!  Used the fresh garlic and ground pepper the others suggested - marinated probably 20 hours.  Meat was very tender, excellent flavor without being overpowering.  My husband and my parents all said it was terrific!  Will definitely use again!

My husband thought it tasted alright, my kids liked it just as much as plain steak, I thought it left something to be desired because there just wasn't enough flavor for me. Will probably not make it again as is.

This is amazing. This makes a cheap cut of meat taste good. You can tweak the amounts of ingredients to suit your taste, but I think it is fine as written. This marinade helps me eat more plain meat which is great for dieting. Thank you.

I didn't have a large cut of tri tip, so I 1/2 the ingredients. Used 2 tea of Worchestehire.  Also added 1/2 c ketchup and 2 t of hot sauce to jazz it up a bit.  Marinated for 3 hours. We loved it! Thanks for the recipe!
It's a keeper hubby said!!

My hubby and I cannot get over how AWESOME this recipe is!!  The meat was very tender and tasted restaurant quality!  I made steaks last night and they turned out so great that we made them again for dinner tonight!!  We used sirloin steak from Sam's (cooked in a skillet on the stove) and it was so good.  The first night, I marinaded the steaks for about 6hrs and this time 4hrs and they came out consistantly good.  Our steaks tonight were a little thicker and tasted even better, so you may want to make sure you have a thicker steak.  We will be using this recipe very often!!  Thanks for sharing it!

Awesome recipe!  I cut the BBQ sauce to 1/2c and added 1/2c ketchup to adjust for my boyfriend's hate of bbq sauce.  We loved it!  Highly recommend trying this one.....

If Less is More, sometimes More is ... too much. I marinaded the steak overnight -- and the result was waaaay over-Worcestershire-sauced meat. Overpowered all the other flavors. Sorry.

Fabulous marinade!  I think we're going to try this one on a pot roast when it gets a bit cooler.  This was fantastic.

Wonderful!  Had a dozen people over for a party, marinated ribeyes (only about 4 hours) and grilled.  I doctor everything, but this didn't need it!  (I did use garlic powder and fresh ground pepper in lieu of "garlic pepper seasoning")  Everybody raved!

Very simple to make and super yummy! We didn't marinate in it, but we could imagine how wonderful it would taste if you marinated it overnight! Also used garlic powder as I've never heard of garlic pepper, and then added salt and pepper.

Absoultely incredible marinade! The best we have ever had. Better than any restaurant. We used strip loin steaks and followed the marinade recipe exactly using Open Pit Mesquite BBQ sauce. Marinated the meat for about 30 hours and cooked the steaks over an open fire.(we were camping at the time). To die for!!!!!!!!!!!!

Excellent! I used a garlic herb vinegarette dressing instead of the italian and left out the garlic. I also put a pinch of pepper in. Wonderful marinade! Will use again, thanks for sharing.

I was looking for a recipe to use for steaks that called for ingredients I had on hand, this was perfect! I marinated ribeyes for an hour and then broiled. My husband who usually cooks our steaks was impressed so I was happy. :) Will definitely make again. Can't wait til warm weather to try grilling with this recipe!

Followed recipe and used it for steak tips that were then grilled. Would make again and, in fact, it has has peaked an interest in marinades. Usually just use BBQ sauce last few minutes of grilling.

This marinade has an excellent flavor.  I cut sirloin into bite-sized pieces and marinated for about 11 hours before grilling.  This gave it time for the flavor to really soak in.  The meat wasn't as tender as I would have liked, however, this may be due to the quality of the meat not the marinade.

I've made this twice now, and while we all liked it, we all agreed that it's too sweet, even though the BBQ sauce I use is a little spicy.  I will make it again for sure, but I"ll be using less BBQ sauce next time.  Used garlic powder instead of the garlic pepper, since I don't know what that is.

Delicious marinade! I did not have Italian dressing so I used what I had on hand, Yasou Greek dressing...it was absolutely scrumptious! Fiancee' thought I figured out the marinade from a restaurant that makes our favorite tips! Of course I adjusted the grill time due to the size of my tips so they came out medium rare. Highly recommend this easy marinade!

Marinade was too overpowering for the steak, I honestly couldn't finish it. May work out better if I brown the meat and then roast it in the oven for awhile instead of just grilling, so I may try this again later at some point.

I've made this repeatedly since first making it. By far, it is the best steak tip marinade I have ever made. There is a famous place nearby called NewBridge Cafe (in Chelsea MA) where the steak tips are legendary. People are always going online and trying together to figure out what the recipe is. THIS RECIPE is as close as anything I've tried before. One caveat: if you've never made garlic pepper before, it's more than just garlic powder and black pepper. Look for a more extensive recipe for garlic pepper if that's the only one you see. Oh, and most importantly, it makes a difference how long you let the beef marinade. I marinade for three days. Sumptuous!

I loved this recipe!  Very easy to put together. I almost never make things as written because I use what I have in my kitchen. My only changes were the type of dressing I used- I had a roasted red pepper vinaigrette, and I used the barbecue sauce in my fridge. (KC Masterpiece) And because of unforeseen reasons my meat marinated for two days! I think this was a big plus because the flavor was incredible! My husband really liked it.  I will definitely make this again!

We loved the flavor of the marinade!  I made this recipe for my sister's birthday dinner, and used Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory & Brown Sugar sauce.  Since I was feeding a small crowd, I made 2 batches of the sauce - one to marinade, and one for pouring over after the steak was grilled. I marinaded for about 5 hours. The issue I had was with the meat. I bought sirloin steak tips, but in the end they were very tough. Since I don't fix steak very often, was it the cut of meat, the grilling time, or something else?  Next time I will try a different cut of meat, I think. We are also planning on trying this on chicken.

This is my "go-to" steak marinade! Family and company love it and it makes a lot so I usually put the extra in a glass jar container in the frig. It keeps well and is great for the next grilled or broiled steak dinner!

Great simple marinade! We use it on everything - chicken, pork chops, steak.  Use it whether we grill or cook in the oven.

All I can say is EXCELLENT! I made exact recipe using Robusto Italian dressing & Sweet Baby Rays bbq sauce & I marinated boneless chicken breasts & thighs in the fridge for about 4 hours. Cooked on hot grill about 5 minutes/side. I boiled the leftover marinade & spooned it over the cooked chicken. It was absolutely excellent. Will definitely make again & will definitely try with steak.

Probably one of the best marinades I've seen yet. I omitted the garlic seasoning only because I didn't have it. I also cut the Italian dressing in half because I used zesty. Very basic yet packed full of flavor.

I marinated the steak tips overnight and then had them in the slow cooker for 5.50 hours yesterday for dinner and it was delicious! I used Zesty Italian dressing and Sweet Baby Ray's original barbecue sauce and the flavor of everything together was very good! 
 I loved how I had extra marinade to drizzle on the mashed potatoes and the asparagus. Two thumbs up and will definitely be making again!

I did not like this at all. I marinated the meat  for 4 hours and still the meat was tough.  I wanted to use the marinade as gravy, but it was too overpowering, it  just tasted like vinegar?, and I made by own beef stock and gravy. I cooked the beef a little longer with the beef stock hoping to tenderize it a little more.  I will not be making this again.

I  made it exactly as written and it was good - but I don't think I would make it again. The main flavor that came through was the BBQ sauce so that's pretty much what the meat tasted like. I didn't really get the other flavors coming through.  Also, it made twice as much marinade as I needed for 2 lbs of meat.

This recipe was very good. I made as instructed except I cut everything in 1/2 and I used 2 cheap sirloins I had frozen. I let it marinate for about 2 & 1/2 hours and it had a lot of flavor I also wrapped the side in bacon, mmm mmm good. Next time I will marinate longer and maybe add some fresh garlic. Btw: I used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce.

I Love this marinade. it's easy and the longer you marinate it the better.
I cut up chunks of sirloin steaks and leave them in the refrigerator overnight .
I have used this many times..
A Big hit with family & friends

I tried this on a small piece of the end of a tenderloin.  I marinated the meat for about 1 hour.  I didn't have garlic pepper seasoning so I used garlic powder.  I also subbed red wine for half the Italian dressing.  It really wasn't what I was looking for and I don't think the end result could be tasted on the meat.  I may try this again, especially if I find the garlic pepper seasoning.  Thanks.

Best steak marinade ever. I use it on all my steaks now and if I don't have an ingredient and cook a steak without it the taste is definitely not the same. Thanks for sharing!
we didn't have any Italian dressing or garlic pepper  so we used red wine vinaigrette and Montreal steak seasoning  it made our steaks melt in your mouth amazing.

OUTSTANDING! I make the full recipe but only use half to marinade up to 3lbs of sirloin in a ziplock bag. I bottle the remaining half to use next time. The only thing I change is adding meat tenderizer as other reviews have suggested. Thanks, DOMENICI for sharing!!

Omg! This is about the 5th time I am using this recipe.  The only difference is that I use it on pork instead of beef.  This recipe is absolutely amazing, and if you cant grill then cook it on the stove top on a pan with all the marinade until it is absorbed.. Not light but it is completely tasteful... Yummy yummy..!!

OMG.. I have been using this site for years and came across some awesome recipes.. but..WOW!!!! USE this! I did wish bone robust italian and kraft hickory bbq.  I generously sprinkled seasoned meat tenderizer on and i used garlic powder and pepper instead of the garlic pepper. Put everything in a ziplock, kneaded it so everything was distributed into the mean, refrigerated for about an hour..give or take. LICK YOUR FINGERS DELICIOUS! Thank You!

I changed the dressing to Red Wine Vinagrette and used the broiler instead of the girl and it came out pretty awesome.  My husband and my 19 moth old daughter loved it.

For some reason, Costco is the only store in my area that sells steak tips. I'm not sure why because they are a delicious alternative to regular steaks and less expensive, too. In the past I have cooked them by grilling them, basting with our favorite jarred BBQ sauce. THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER! The marinade is delicious and makes the steak tips so tender. I made the recipe exactly as written and found it delicious without needing any modifications. Just beware that the recipe is high in sodium (I am conscious of this now that I am cooking for someone on a sodium-restricted diet). When I can pull it off, I put the marinade and the steak tips in a container overnight. If I only have a couple hours, the steak tips will still be very good, just not as tender. This recipe is a big hit with my extended family. This past vacation, steak tips with this marinade were requested twice in a 2-week recipe rotation. I would add that I did try cooking steak tips and this marinade in the crock pot and I did not like the outcome as much--just my family's personal preference. Thank you, Deanna.

First time I ever tried marinating sirloin tips and this was super yummy!  My family really loved it and I was impressed myself.  I followed the recipe exactly and let the tips sit for about 36 hours before cooking.  Great flavor and so good!

I thought this was great!  I used fat free Wishbone Italian dressing, Jack Daniels barbeque sauce, 1 clove of garlic and spicy steak seasoning.  I had two pounds of steak tips and marinated them for a few hours.  I broiled instead of grilled and will be cooking these again!

I'm not good in the kitchen and practically never cook, but decided I needed to start.  I followed the directions exactly, and that's probably my downfall, but it came out quite bland.  Maybe I did something wrong.

I marinated chicken for about 20 hours (hectic work schedules, it was yesterday or nothing).  The chicken was juicy and had a good flavor, but lacked some sort of zip.  Since I'm not a fan of hot/spicy additions, I'll have to find some other way to add some flavor.  But I believe I'll make this again.

So good and even better the next day. Served with buttered egg noodles. Next time I will have to experiment with the BBQ sauce because all I had was Jack Daniel's BBQ Sauce and it came out.....just like a Jack Daniel's Steak.

I didn't really care for it.  I followed the recipe to a T and marinated it over night.  Still, the taste was a little bland...not worth the midnight run I made to the store for ingredients...

THE BEST EVER!  We loved this marinade.  We had company over and everyone loved it.  Some even wished they could eat the marinade with a spoon.  I used it on Carne Asada and it turned out great.

We tend to marinate our boneless pork chops in this when cooking on the gril!

I found this a little too strongly flavored by the Worchestershire Sauce.  My husband, on the other hand, thought this was a very good marinade.  I will probably make it again, but tinker with the amounts.

This marinade was good and easy to put together.  I didn't have garlic pepper so I substituted it for a mixture of garlic powder and black pepper.  I marinated my steaks all day and they turned out well.

Very good marinade.  I let the steak marinate almost 24 hours before cooking them indoors on a cast iron grill on the stove top.  I think the Worcestershire was a little too much for us, and I will cut back on that the next time, probably by about half.  Boyfriend, who's the steak lover, really liked this!

I reduce the recipe by 1/2 and it still turned out delicious.  This was a very tangy marinade and I'll definitely make it again.

This was very easy to make and I love that the ingredients are ones I normally have on hand.  Next time I will marinate longer (I only had about 3 hours) and will use a better cut of meat.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks!

The day got away from me, again, so I was only able to marinate the beef for 3 hours.  The beef still came out very flavorful and tender.  I did cut the recipe in half for 2 pounds of steak tips, and used fresh garlic and freshly ground pepper for the garlic pepper seasoning.  I will try this on chicken breasts next.  Quick to throw together and delectable!

Great recipe! Simple and easy.  Used half the marinade as suggested by previous cooks. It was more than enough. Also used black pepper and garlic powder instead of seasoning.

#1 steak marinade!!! A definite keeper!  I cut the recipe in half and followed some other reviewers advice and used 1/2 garlic powder and 1/2 black pepper.  It's tangy, sweet, and a little spicy.  Easy to kick up the heat by adding red pepper flakes or hot sauce.  This is also good as a steak sauce.  Thanks a bunch!!!

I cut this in half - there was still plenty of marinade for our three steaks! I also didn't have garlic pepper, but garlic powder and fresh-ground pepper did the trick. My husband was thrilled with this, so I know it was great!

I actually use this for chicken. I rub Montreal chicken seasoning on it, throw it on the charcoal BBQ, and baste the chicken with this sauce. It's fantastic!! Really slop the sauce on and use as much as you want to. You'll be glad you did!

It was a very good marinade.  BBQ sauce with a kick!  Since I didn't have garlic pepper, I used 1/2 garlic granuales and 1/2 pepper.  Worked well.

This marinade was so awesome! It is so easy to remember because the amounts are simple. These are ingredients that are usually kept in the house anyway. I marinated mine for 3 hours and broiled it...I will remember this forever! Thanks!

Good though not my favorite. I think I will add some hot sauce to spice it up. I like my marinades spicy and this one could use a kick in the pants.

This marinade was just ok, but I didnt think that it was spectacular and I probably would not make it again.  I  marinated my steaks over night so they were quite flavorful, but unfortunately the flavor that we tasted the most was the Wosterchire sauce.

Wow - I loved this marinade! I marinaded really thin sirloin tip steak for an hour and then broiled it for 3 minutes each side.  Then I used fresh avocado, sprouts, tomato, lettuce and provolone cheese and made wraps! Can't wait to try it on other cuts of meat.  Thanks for sharing!

Yum, yum, yum!!  I used this marinade for a London Broil, and marinaded it about 24 hours.  Very tasty!  I suggest you halve the ingredients though... had too much marinade, and felt like a waste of my Italian Dressing & BBQ sauce.  Half the ingredients is plenty!  Definately a keeper!

Maybe it was the type of BBQ sauce &/or salad dsg, but this was just o.k..
Let it marinate all day and broiled the steak tips.  The BBQ sauce flavor seemed to be too pronounced.

This is a GREAT marinade. I was a little unsure, with the BBQ sce and the Italian dressing, but truly, when I smelled it all put together, it was excellent.  It smelled so good marinating the top sirloin steaks I used! I marinated them for about an hour and a half, and they could have been done longer, but the time was sufficient. The only thing I may add next time is a little more salt. Oh, also, I used Bulls Eye BBQ and Bernsteins Light Cheese Fantastico dressing. This marinade has the perfect amount of sweet and tangy, and did not overwhelm the beef taste. I may add a little salt next time, but otherwise, will make as directed.

WHOA I'm in love with these.  I added more worcestershire about 3/4 c. and used Jack Daniels BBQ Sauce along with adding the other ingredients as well as cracked pepper, garlic and onion powder, meat tenderizer.  I only had 40 minutes to marinade and these were amazing just what I was looking for.

This was ok. My husband liked it better than I did. I have to say I think I missed the saltiness from the soy sauce marinades I usually use. It was an easy marinade and I may try it on chicken sometime.

I used garlic salt instead of pepper.  Relatives liked this so much, they took the recipe back to the Carolinas with them!  Have made this several times now, and used either fat-free or "light" Italian dressing.  Very, Very good!

Excellent marinade.  I let it sit for quite a while.  I used the wrong cut of meat - it had a terrible "vein" of very tough gristle running thru it, but I'm bad at chosing cuts of meat.  Will use again with a different cut.
