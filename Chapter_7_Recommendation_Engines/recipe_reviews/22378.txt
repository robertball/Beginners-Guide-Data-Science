This is my second time making this cake and it is wonderfully delicious. Both times I decreased both sugars by 1/4 cup and it was sweet enough. I also added 1 cup of walnuts. The first time I made the cake I cut back on the apples because it seemed like so much but didn't take into account that the apples would cook down so the second time I actually added more. Also, the second time around, I added another 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. Although it was great the first time I thought it lacked the spice you get with apple pie. Came out great both ways but I will stick to how I made it the second time.

The recipe called for too much sugar. I reduced the white sugar to half a cup and added a cup of walnuts. It turned out great after my modifications.

I made these in muffin tin instead and this recipe yielded 24 cupcake sized muffins with baking time of 20 minutes. You will have to fill the papercups all the way as the batter doesn't rise much.

This cake is excellent.  I made it precisely as written, and it's wonderful.  Didn't let it cool the whole 60 minutes, 'tho, because the kids were clamoring for dessert.  I allowed the pan to cool for 15 minutes, until I could see that the outside edge was separating from the pan.  Ran a knife around the tube, and it came right out.  Cut it immediately with a serrated knife, and they're eating it right up, warm from the oven.  Yummy!

This cake is simple and very good. I cut the sugar in half and chopped the apples instead of grating them - received lots of compliments on the cake.

Canâ€™t go wrong with this!  Absolutely amazing!  I used a mixture of apples and cut them into cubes.  my apples were small so i thought i wouldn't have enough, but actually i left some out!  it ended up being about 6-7 cups.  Very moist with a "crunchy" outside.

This cake was way better than I expected.  I used 11 cups of shredded apples.  I only had half a stick of butter, so I used half a stick of butter and one of those little 4 oz applesauce containers.  It was light and moist.  Yum!

A great way to use up an overabundance of apples with other staple ingredients; making this extra simple.  I only had golden and red delicious apples of smaller to medium size and it was plenty.  I just threw them into the food processor and left a few larger bits.  Left the skins on for added color and fiber.  Only additions were 1/2 tsp. black walnut extract and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, 1/4 tsp. clove.  I agree with other reviewers as to the ease of not sticking.  This was the easiest cake I ever got out of a bundt pan!  I only tasted the  remaining moist coating left inside the pan but it tasted wonderful.

I usually read through several reviews before I choose a recipe. i sort by "most helpful" and it really makes a difference. I gave it 4 stars because I made quite a few modifications. With my changes, it is 5 star.

I started out with adding one extra teaspoon of cinnamon,  a few dashes of nutmeg and a few dashes of cloves. I like a nice, flavorful cake. The recipe calls for 2 tsp of vanilla and I used one tablespoon.  I cut the sugar in half and it was still very sweet. If I had used the full amount it would have been inedible. 

As far as the apples go, I waited until the batter was completely mixed before preparing the apples. Otherwise they get brown.  I diced 4 and shredded three. The shredded apples just disappear into the cake, and I wanted some texture so the diced bits worked out well. It also avoided that  issue of the cake being too soggy. If you choose to shred all of them, drain some but not all of the juice out. Some juice is needed to moisten the batter. 

The smell when baking filled the house with wonderful autumn like aromas. 

The cake came out wonderful. I dusted it with a little confectioner's sugar and served it with vanilla ice cream on the side. In my opinion it didn't need any icing or frosting. This cake would also be great with some walnuts and raisins added to the batter if you like them.

Will definitely make it again with my modifications.

Very good recipe. I haved the sugar (like all American recipes - sugar content is waaay to much. It can be even lowered some more) and also substituted with honey. This would also benefit from some walnuts. Other than that - a great, moist / firm texture. I *will* try this again.

This is a wonderful tasting cake.  Nice and moist, just the right sweetness.. does not really need powdered sugar sprinkled on it.  Expect a heavy bundt cake.....but extremely delicious. Hubby loved it. I will definitely be making this cake again.  Oh and I added about 1/2 cup of raisins, and 1 cup chopped walnuts. mmmm mmmm good!

Very moist cake.  I decreased the sugar by 1/4 cup each and only added 5 apples chopped very tiny. I did not cook for the entire 60 minutes....I also added 'Caramel Frosting I'.  It was very good and I would make it again.

I made this cake for a friend's 30th birthday.  It's delicious!  I added more cinnamon and nutmeg, chopped 2 of the apples because my hand was tired of shredding, used whole wheat flour and added about a cup of chopped walnuts. I topped it with Caramel Frosting VI from this site, and then made fall leaves out of gum paste, and sprinkled them all over the cake before the frosting set. The cake was moist and dense.  People kept sneaking "just a little bit more" all night long, and one person hid a piece so he could have some on his flight home.

Oops -- Made a mistake in my earlier review.  Subsituted applesauce for the BUTTER, not for the sugars.  Then cut back on the sugar by 1/2 c as noted in other reviews.

I love this cake -- great texture and so delicious!  I reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup and added one cup of toasted, chopped walnuts. I also reduced the cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp. and added 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg.  The apples I used were slightly over ripe and I think this added more flavor to the recipe.

Decrease both sugars by at least a 1/4 cup but perferably by half.  Increase cinnamon by another half teaspoon.  Serve with a cinnamon cream cheese glaze.

If you've ever had the Tastefully Simple apple cake and loved it, you're gonna love this!!  I threw my apples in the food processor so some pieces were small and some larger (about 1/4"), and I think the 8" square pan is the way to go.

Ymmy cake! I cut the sugar like everyone suggested (to 1.5 cups) and still found it very sweet... (don't get me wrong! Its delicious! but it could be cut more if you're counting calories) Easy to make... the hardest part is peeling/coring/shredding the apples!

This cake is delish! So moist! I only made 1/2 the recipe and put it in a small bundt pan. I used 1/2 whole wheat flour, cut out the brown sugar and used only 1/2 cup of white sugar. It was very sweet with only 1/2 the sugar, I would never use the full amount of sugar. I did not shred the apples, just left them sliced. It was great, I will definitely make it again!

I just made this and was pleased with the result. I always like to follow a recipe precisely as listed the first time I make it, so I did shred all of the apples. I wish I had chopped half of them instead- the shredded ones kind of melt into the cake (maybe a firmer apple would have worked better? I used Macouns). Also, I think you definitely need to drain the apples- after reading the last review, I did drain mine and the cake was still super moist. The flavor was great and everyone loved it- I dusted it with confectioner's sugar but agree that a caramel icing would be ideal. A great fall treat!

Delicious! Very moist. It's easy to make. I think this cake would also taste good with some chopped walnuts. I'm going to try that next time. It's a great cake as is though.

This is a really good way to use apples or zuchinni. I only had 3 apples so I used applesauce  for the rest of the amount. The cake is very dense and moist. It was a hit.

Truly Easy!  Truly Tasty!  Remarkably moist and flavorful.  We substituted the vanilla with Coconut Rum, and also added a cup of chopped walnuts---after we mixed the batter we decided that those alterations would be delicious--and believe me--this cake is EXCELLENT!  We cut it about an hour after it had backed so it was still slightly warm and it was great--I just had a piece(a day later)--and when cooled the apple flavor really comes out well!  I loved it--and already have the reciped printed out so I dont loose this one-a real keeper!

I really only  take  time  to rate and review recipes on here  that were  really great or  really not-so great (  thinking  this may help others  decide on trying  or skipping the  recipe) and this apple cake was  supreme. My hubby has  a luncheon at  work and  everyone  loved  this  cake. SO much better than  bundts  from a cake  mix.
*Note-  I do  recommend  using a cream cheese or  caramel glaze on this cake, it  makes  it  even better :)

I diced my apples instead of shredding them like another reviewer and really enjoyed the "chunks" of apples.  Also used 1t cinnamon and 1t of nutmeg (ran out of cinnamon) which was nice.  This was a really, really easy and delicious cake.  I wanted to find a different/unique apple recipe that wasn't apple pie.  This works!

Very moist and delicious.  Took one hour prep time.  I decreased white sugar to 1/2 cup, decreased cinnamon to 1 1/2 t., added dash of nutmeg, and added walnuts.  Next time, I might decrease apples - it was that moist.  My husband loved it.

My 4 y.o. loved it but the 7 y.o. hated it. I suspect reducing the amount of cinnamon would have helped in the later case. It was easy to make and tasted nice but seems to have a huge amount of sugar in it.

Made this for a church dinner because I had all he ingredients on hand and didn't want to go to the store for anything else.  Very good and moist.  This is now the only apple cake I'll make.

I have a history with any sort of baked goods with apple in it. They invariably stick to the pan no matter how well I grease and flour it. This cake has to be the first one that didn't. That in itself makes it a success for me. The fact that it was beautifully moist, tasted terrific and disappeared in no time was a bonus. A very big thankyou jillybeans.

This is a moist cake. This recipe gets all 5 stars because everyone loved it as is and no one said it was 'too sweet'. I just didn't grate the apples, I only chopped them. I am making a note to myself that the apples should be large. We all loved the brown sugar sauce which I did change just a bit as I had no brandy... I put butterscotch schnapps and it was good.

This cake was ok, unfortunately the week before I made a different apple cake recipe that was really good, so this one just didn't measure up to that one is all.  I did follow the exact directions and it came out nice, I just won't make it again.

Yummy. I used 9 apples. 2 of the apples I chopped up while I grated the rest. I did strain the grated apples to remove some of the excess moisture. I did cut the white sugar to 1/2 cup, added 1/2 t nutmeg, and made a carmel icing to put over the cake. The flavor was good.

This was fantastic!  I made it for my father-in-law's birthday and it went over very well.  Got lots of compliments that it was such a wonderful fall dessert!  I added 1 cup of chopped walnuts and added a 1/2 cup of Craisins.  I glazed it with Caramel Frosting I by MaryKaye (tripling the butter, milk and brown sugar in that recipe) and it was awesome!  Can't wait to make it again.

This recipe is superb. The only thing I did was to use 8 apples, and I chopped 3 of them into chunks and grated the rest.
I get the feeling from reading some of these reviews that a lot of people are using tasteless apples like golden delicious for this recipe. Don't!!! You need an apple with flavour for this cake. 

I will be making this lots. It was like sinking into a mountain of toffee apple goodness

This was AWESOME!!! Even my apple-hating husband loved it. Nuts would be a great addition. It is very moist and goes well with a glaze. I made a half recipe and it baked very nicely in an 8" round cake pan.

Loved this cake!!! However I added a pinch of nutmeg, reduced the butter just a bit and plan to reduce the cinnamon just a wee bit next time. Very easy and delicious. Makes the house smell great too.

VERY moist.  Great recipe to use up my remaining apples.  Unfortunately, it didn't get totally devoured before lunch when I brought it into work.  So it's good, but I've had bigger hits.

Because I only chopped the apples and used whole wheat flour, I added about 1/3 cup sour cream to moisten the batter more. I also added a cup of walnuts with the 7 chopped apples. 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar was enough. It all turned out wonderful.

for some reason - I used home made almond meal instead of flour - decreased sugars by 1/2 - used the eggs but separated them and blended in the beat egg whites at the end - and to my disbelief it turned out wonderful - maybe the rum whipped cream did it.

I cut the sugar down as others advised. Also used oil instead of butter. The cake came out of the pan perfectly.  If I make again I would cut back on the baking soda as it left a bit of an aftertaste.  2 1/4 tsps is a large amount.

Just finished baking this cake.  I changed two things.  I used 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I'm type 1 diabetic so cutting sugar out or down in a recipe is important.  I also used about 4 cups chopped apples.  With the reduction in sugar and chunks of apples, this cake is delicious!  Perfect mix of sweet and spice for the fall.  I will be making this one again!

Fantastic as was.  Was worried about the amount of apples.  I used large apples, reduced to 6 but 7 would've been okay.  Bowl full of apples...which I used the food processor on, because grating was taking forever.  For those who thought too sweet, wonder what apples they chose.  I picked 4 granny smith and 2 galas.  No reason to add lemon for fear of apples turning brown...the cake is brown....Kept everything as is and my country boyfriend who was longing for an apple cake he remembered from long ago sliced into and devoured before dinner.  He thought glaze would be even better but settled for the powdered sugar which I added after.  Cooking time was perfect and the cake popped out with no issues.

Makes a very dense, moist cake, not overly apple-y though...I would NOT recommend letting it cool for the hour in the pan, mine totally stuck despite being properly buttered and floured...it just set in there and wouldnt spring loose.

Great cake!  It dissappeard in a day at my house.  The only thing I would suggest is make sure there are no apple chunks - make sure it's just grated bits.  I found the little chunks that I threw in mushy.

This is a great cake that doesn't need icing.  3-4 chopped/shredded apples are plenty.  I use Crisco spray on my bundt pan and have never had a problem with it sticking.  Serve with whipped cream.

Very yummy! It takes a long time to peel, core, and grate all those apples, but this is such a good cake, it's worth it. It's super moist and has excellent flavor. I did not have any problems with soggy cake as other reviewers mentioned. I made sure to fold in the apple really well and distribute it evenly throughout the batter. I think that helped.

UGH!  So I did as suggested by everyone (shred half, chop half).  A quarter of my cake is totally soggy while the rest is fine.  When shredding the apples, maybe they should be drained?  I am totally disappointed in how this cake turned out...it was supposed to be a 'welcome to the office' thing - but it can't be served.

This was very moist, and excellent with the caramel frosting.  Note:  The caramel frosting doesn't last as long as the cake.

I didn't have a bundt pan on hand, so I baked this in two glass dishes instead.  Because of the pan substitution, I should have reduced the temp to 300, as the cake browned before it cooked all the way.  I also grated all the apples, but will rough chop half next time I make it, so there is more texture (was very similar to carrot cake, as one reviewer wrote) to the end result.

This was a wonderful cake. I decreased the amounts of both sugars by 1/4 cup and added a little extra cinnamon and also nutmeg. I did use the called for amount of apples but roungh chopped the last 2. Definitly will be made again and soon.

Wow, I'm wondering if I did something wrong here, because everyone else is raving!  Mine was moist to the point of mushiness.  It tasted good, but was more like a bread pudding.  I put it back in the pan (an adventure in itself!) and baked it a little longer to dry it out a little last night, but this morning it appeared to be mushy again!  I'll have to try a piece when I get home from work.

This was good and very moist, but tasted a lot like zuccini breads that I've had. I guess I was expecting something more. I think some chopped walnuts in the cake and the addition of a glaze over the top would make this 5 stars

This was a great cake.  I added apple pie filling instead  because that's what i had around and it still turned out wonderful.  I advise that people use real apples though because I had to cook it a little longer than I wanted to. I also added cream cheese frosting.  It was delicious!!
