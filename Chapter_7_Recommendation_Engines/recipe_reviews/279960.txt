Really good!  I used twice the chicken and more chilies.  I didn’t have pork rinds so I just put more cheddar cheese on top and it made a real nice topping.  I think next time I’ll use some sour cream in the chicken mixture or maybe in with the eggs mixture.  And I did use heavy cream instead of milk to make it more keto friendly.  This one’s a keeper!

Was very good.  I used leftover chicken thighs with cutup bacon so was a bit greasy.  Cut chili powder down a bit, still has a nice kick to it.  Will make again.

Perfect!  I added 1 can of black beans with the chicken,  and I didn't have pork rinds so used crushed up tortilla chips.  Will make this again!!

This was a big hit, even for people who "don't like casseroles".  I would use a little less chili powder next time, as the flavor seemed really strong.  Maybe a little more cumin to balance the flavors better?  Great weeknight dish.

Wow, loved it. Served on a bed of cabbage/coleslaw, with avocado slices and sour cream then drizzled cilantro lime sauce. Recipe could be doubled for large family or potluck dinner.

YUMMMM!!!, but I am "one of those" who had to modify because of ingredients on hand (not because I'm chef-ier than you :
- used a pound of ground beef (browned with the onion)
- had only one can of diced chiles (didn't miss the other can at all)
- added an extra egg to account for the extra meat.

I made this for  my brother and his wife who is suffering from seven fractured vertebrae and she called raving about it!  I am eating Keto and thought it was one of the best I’ve had in ages!

Quick to put together, and very tasty! I increased the amount of pork rinds and reduced the milk the second time I made it, and liked it better that way.

This was easy and  was very good. I added very small broccoli florets. Will definitely make again.
