I prepared this for a 4th of July cookout and it was FABULOUS!  I even had sparklers (thanks to my niece) to light as "candles" before we sliced it!!  YUMMO!!  The only thing I'd suggest doing (for looks as well as taste) is cook the blueberries a little bit - the gelatin layer with the blueberries was a little stiffer than the strawberry layer.  Cutting an uncooked blueberry is gold in the center and a little strange looking (to me anyway)!  But everyone raved on how festive it looked and it tastes just like a strawberry/blueberry shortcake in an all-in-one pan!

I also made this recipe layering the cake and whipped topping, except for the fruit I used store bought rasberries, thawed and mixed with orange juice. Then mixed a pack of gel. The tartness of the orange juice with the sweet of the cake was soo good.  You may not need to use the gel unless you don't plan on serving right away. I found the weight of the mold itself held the cake together just fine as long as it was served right away.

even though i used the exact amount of ingredients given in the recipe, i had to leave out a few layers or i would have run out of ingredients. i ended up with strawberry- cake- cream- blueberry- cake... the blueberries sort of disappeared in the cream and those two layers somehow turned out as one- but it was still all very good in the end.
