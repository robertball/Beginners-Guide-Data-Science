I submitted this recipe a few years ago.  The amount of bacon should really be 1 lb.  The amount listed is way to much. It really is quite good.  Freezes well too.

Spices were odd. Needs more egg. I also don't understand why they want you to use flour. It was not necesarry and made the bacon weird. I added an egg, used half and half, and put in some onion, slat and pepper- came out much better.

Very very good! I used 2 2.5oz pkgs. of store brand precooked bacon. I used store brand swiss cheese and this was really good, but it needed a tad more taste so next time I will use an aged swiss or fontina cheese. Hubby suggested we add cubed potatoes, green peppers,  onion, and mushrooms too or other cheeses to change this up and make this again often. Both my husband and I liked this a lot but my teen, who is my typically my adventurous eater and rarely turns his nose up at anything, didn't care for this at all. Great with a side of hashbrowns and toast. Thanks for this recipe, we had a wonderful meal!

I cut the bacon as suggested.  In place of the extra bacon I added about a cup of fresh mushrooms, sliced.  And added one more egg because my pie plate was a little larger than called for. Everyone loved it.

I think this was so tasty!  It was my first time making quiche and I followed the recipe pretty closely, but I didn't have any swiss cheese!  So I substituted some chedder/mozzarella blend and it was great.  I did use 3 eggs and a DEEP dish pie crust.  It was filled to the brim.  Leaked out a little!  I'd definitely stick to the 3 eggs!  I didn't flour coat the bacon either.  Cooked just fine without it.  Try this!!  It really is delicious!

You could reduce the amount of bacon and still have a tasty quiche.

I didn't dredge the bacon in flour.  I used fat free half and half in place of evaporated milk for a richer flavor.  I added a can of french style green beans drained well for some veggies.  Yum!!!!

This recipe was modified: My hubby, 11 yr. old son (even his freinds!) & I have been loving different kinds quiche for a long time. I used some leftover ham, instead of bacon, from X-Mas dinner (5) eggs instead of (3), and  a couple shakes of hot sauce instead the mustard and we loved it! I  thought the evaporated milk was a good idea. I've been using cottage cheese for a different texture but the milk was better. This is so relative to the cooks taste. Now if I just could learn a good pie crust!

I made it this morning.  I omitted the crust and just used a pie plate sprayed with Pam.  I used cubed cheddar and spinkled a little green onion on top.  Excellent!  Don't forget to add the mustard - so good!  Thanks for sharing.

I followed this recipe exactly, because we LOVE bacon in our family. However, it really is too much bacon. I suggest only 1lb. of bacon or definitely increase the egg mixture. I would certainly make this one again.

This was absolutely amazing! I only used a pound of bacon, and skipped the flour but other than that, it was an awesome recipe I used to impress the inlaws on Christmas Eve :) Thanks Erin!

I used 2 slices of bacon that I microwaved and crumbled in the bottom of the crust with 5 slices deli-thin aged swiss cheese.  Reduced the evaporated milk to 6 ounces, added 6 ounces 1% milk, and  one more  egg.  No flour on the bacon.  Very good, and the small amount of bacon was sufficient to flavor the quiche and not overpower the subtlety of the eggs, milk and cheese.

The ingredients are a little too much because I almost always overfill the pie crust. However it tastes wonderful and I make it all the time.

This was a very yummy quiche recipe, although the cooking time resulted in an over-browned (almost burnt) top. My oven always requires the longer cooking time in a recipe, so I did not think to shorten the time or cover the top with foil to prevent the over-browning. The flavor was great, though! Even my kids loved it. I used turkey bacon to make it a bit healthier.

This is a wonderful recipe with a little adjustments on my end.  Here is what I did:  Omit flour, less bacon, less nutmeg but more spicy brown mustard, added onions, salt, pepper and then topped it off with butterkase cheese and pushed it down in the milk mixture.  I was a little skeptical of using nutmeg since it's a strong spice but the mustard and nutmeg go hand in hand.  This was a hit recipe at my house.  Oh the butterkase cheese is a very creamy cheese with an absolute wonderful taste.  It left the top part of my quiche creamy on top while the swiss blended well with the milk and egg mixture.

First quiche I've ever made,  used about 1/2 lb bacon - 6or7 strips worth , less flour, and less milk along with julienned swiss slices. Now use it as my go to quiche recipe and alter it depending on what I have.  I've done ham and broccoli, bacon tomato etc.  the flour does a nice job holding ingredients in place and absorbing moisture from added ingredients. Sometimes use 5 eggs based on filling quantity,  never more than 1 cup milk or half n half,  just enough flour to dust add ins and cut down baking time. Usually do 35 to 40 minutes at 375 or so . Thanks for getting me started on quiches!  Super easy

DELICIOUS!!! I did take others advice and only used 1 pound of bacon and did not coat the bacon in flour (no reason to) But otherwise the quiche was gone in minutes and I had to make another one right away!

yum. I used 5 small/mediumish EB eggs, 1 cup of VIT D milk, 1/2 tsp of ground mustard and the 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. only pre baked the crust for 4 mins because I knew it would remedy the exposed crust overcooking issue- it turned out brown and tasty , not burnt. no foil necessary. used 1 lb. of low sodium bacon that I microwaved to get rid of the grease. you can microwave bacon on 3 or 4 paper towels for a minute per slice ( 5 at a time ) and it comes out perfectly crispy and not greasy. I only used about a tsp of flour to toss the bacon in. this turned out beautiful with a nice puffy, lightly browned top at 45 mins at 375*. I also used about 5 slices of swiss that I sliced thin instead of shredded and it came out with nice noticeable melted cheese areas. once it was done I put a light sprinkiling of Mexican cheese blend on top and put it back in for 2 minutes then let it sit for ten. so.. so good. this is the recipe I was after. I tried the one on here with the cup of cottage cheese in it first. too bad I had to waste those ingredients. gave that one to my neighbor =D

Loved this -- but like most others, I added 2 more eggs for a deep dish pie.  Since it was my 1st time making it, I followed the recipe -- but alas -- reviewers were right again:  I'm not sure why the flour!  I used just a little and it it was totally unnecessary.  I used a great Swiss blend cheese and plenty of it -- but the quiche was still a little bland.  Next time, I'll add onions and/or mushrooms, etc.

I made this for our Christmas brunch and it was very good. However, there was floured bacon on top that did not cook into the pie.  I see no need for the flour because you don't need it as a thickening agent. Because my family likes bacon, I did use all the recipe called for.  The next time I make this I will not use the flour and will instead, put all the bacon on the bottom.  I also added an extra egg since mine were rather small.

I usually make this with ham instead only because its faster and my love of bacon makes me want to savor bacon on its own!     I've made this numerous times over the years sub in whatever meat or veggies you desire it turns out great!  I would recommend deep pie dish as it is very full pie plate!  I skipped the flour option when i used bacon ....just made sure to drain/paper towel grease off bacon first.

I made this recipe with ham, rather than bacon.  Cut down on the calories and it was absolutely delicious.  I used baby swiss this time.  I think that the next time I make this, I'll use a sharper swiss or even a sharper kind of cheese.  I also added quite a bit of black pepper and salt.  I think I'll cut out half of the evaporated milk and use an extra egg next time, to cut down on the sweetness.

A very good and easy recipe. I only used 9oz of bacon and that was plenty for me. I also used smoked cheddar cheese instead of Swiss because I love smoked cheddar cheese.. I will use this again.

made a few changes, omitted the mustard, only used a little more than a pound of bacon, and added a layer of cooked hash browns to it. HUGE hit!
