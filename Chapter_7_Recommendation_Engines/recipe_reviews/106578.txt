We are avid campers....and cook with the pie makers often. Another version of this is to add thinly sliced onion, shaved ham and shredded cheese. After you have your bred in the pie maker, you have to pat a little well in the center of one side of the bread, and crack your egg in the well. You can use cooked and crumbled sausage and or bacon. We make BBQ pies, pizza, what ever you want. they are easy to do and no clean up. ENJOY!

No need for the campfire here! My husband practially lives on these for breakfast and this was easy to put together.  I simply toasted and buttered the bread and cooked my egg in the microwave. I added some cooked sausage and grilled it to let the cheese melt inside.  Great for "breakfast on the go".

What I love about the sandwich makers is that ANY recipe tastes good. My twist on this sandwich is that I put bacon on the outsides of the bread so that it cooks up all crispy and wonderful with your egg and cheese inside. Make sure you flip too. That's the key... YUMMMMY!

A little tricky to make sure that the egg cooks all the way, but other than that, very tasty!

This was the best breakfast sandwich ever...of course now we want to cook every sandwich in the hobo cooker.  We can't wait to try different variations on future camping trips or maybe just in the firepit in the backyard.  Oh only one piece of advice...when it says "turn frequently" ...turn it frequently...I burned my first sandwich beyond recognition and had to start all over.

These were great camping!  We added thinly sliced red onion and green pepper to the sandwich.  Yum, yum!  The only thing we forgot was the butter, which will make them even better next time!

I just made these at home, although I longed to cook these with a hobo toaster over a campfire. These are great little breakfast sandwiches that can easily be made in your own kitchen. We usually add a slice of canadien bacon or 2 slices of bacon or sausage patties. Thanks for the post.

No campfire so I tried it on the Foreman grill.  The second time I skipped the cheese and butter which you can totally get away with on a Foreman for some reason.  It reminded me of sort of a reverse french toast, so we dipped in syrup.  YUM & FUN for breakfast.

It was ok. We decided that the idea was good, but needed work. We are going to try dipping the bread french toast syle, adding some ham/canadian bacon and maybe pre cooked scrambled eggs.

Very Delicious! I toasted the bread slices separately while i scrambled the egg, then cooked the whole sandwich grilled cheese style for a few minutes. Quick and easy!
