The McCormicks Jerk Seasoning used in this recipie is simply D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!  Mixed along with the other seasonings just kicks it up to even another level!  After seasoning chicken I let marinate and then I browned the chicken legs and wings and then slowly simmered on stove top, was very good like this and chicken was super tender and it made its own gravy for my rice.  Yum!

i used the jamaican jerk seasoning, and this made a wonderfully flavorful meal when served with my family's favorite recipe for jamaican rice and peas(which are actually red beans). my sisters thought it was too strongly spiced for them but i enjoyed the flavor-punch.

I used straight-from-Jamaica "Juliana" jerk seasoning, doubling the seasonings for 3 chicken breasts.  Probably piled it on too much because it was hot!  But really good too.  Next time, I'll ease up on the jerk seasoning a bit. :-) And I think I might try OJ concentrate for deeper flavor.

My husband & I were a bit disappointed with this recipe.  (We're still looking for that authentic Jamaican Jerk Sauce we had while traveling to Jamacia!)

Very good and very easy.. recipe is a keeper. For leftovers I plan on adding the chicken to a salad or with tortillas and maybe a lime sauce for fun.  I did double the recipe though and still barely had enough for 3 breasts...

I used Walkerswood Jerk Seasoning instead, i thought it was a bit too hot for my liking although my husband did enjoy it very much.

THIS WAS VERY GOOD...THE ONLY THING I CHANGED WAS NOT USING ALLSPICE ONLY BECAUSE I DIDNT HAVE ANY. THIS IS A DEFINITE KEEPER.
