10 Star!!!  I make these every day in my cafe for customers who can't get enough of them.  Here are some tips to make them AMAZING!  I like my squares to have a "crispy" texture rather than dry and loose, so I use a full 1 cup of BUTTER.  I then melt it in the microwave until it is just past the really mushy stage.  some will actually be melted completely. Remember, if your mix is dry in the bowl, it will be dry on your date squares!  Mix the dry ingredients with the butter as instructed.  However, after placing half the mixture in your pan, bake it for 15 minutes or until golden brown!  This makes them easy to cut and they hold together much better than regular bars.  No need to dice the dates, but do have a "squeeze" of each one quick to ensure there aren't any pits in them!  Dates are sweet already.  So if you just want to taste the dates, omit the brown sugar that is called for in the date mixture.  Just add your water and lemon juice.  Remove your pan from the oven and you can spread your dates over top right away.  Crumble the rest of your mixture over top making sure your entire mixture is mixed with the butter really well.  Bake until a golden brown.   THESE FREEZE PERFECTLY!  I wrap 6 in plastic wrap really well and use within a week so I'm not sure how long you can leave them in the freezer for.  Lastly, DOUBLE THE RECIPE!  Put it in a 9x13 or 10x14 pan and share with your friends.  This is an awesome recipe!!!  Thanks so much Michelle.

Wow, good recipe. I halved the sugar in the crust and put none in the filling (dates are so sweet anyway), used ½ c whole-wheat flour + ½ c all-purpose, and substituted ¼ c applesauce for some of the butter. Turned out beautiful, delicious (even better the next day) and almost guilt-free.

Update: baking the bottom layer before adding the dates/top layer works nicely!
These were great as is.  Moist, flavorful, and easy.  I might bake the bottom layer of crust for 5-10 minutes next time to firm it up a bit, but other than that, yum!

Great recipe just as its written!...just thought i would suggest cutting dates with scissors rather than trying to chop the sticky things.  My mom kept kitchen scissors just for this job and it was my job as a lil girl to snip up the dates.

Just when I thought this recipe couldn't get any better, I made it with really fresh medjool dates instead of the dry store bought ones I normally use. It was absolutely incredible!! If you can use the fresh medjool dates, I highly recommend it!

The ingredients list says all-purpose flour, and the instructions say pastry flour, so I wasn't sure which to use! I ended up using all purpose, and they turned out ok.
The second time I made this, I found that they were nicer with a little bit more of a filling and less of a "crust" (I just used 1 cup each of flour and rolled oats). 
Nice recipe, though!

These are great.  I substituted 1/2 of the butter for applesauce, and leaving in that little bit of butter left them crunchy yet lower in fat.  I also left out the sugar in the date filling as they were plenty sweet on their own.  This is somewhat unlike other date square recipes as I found that the filling was soft and creamy (probably due to leaving out the sugar). Will make again.

Would give 5 stars but made too many changes ...NO salt, NO baking soda, NO sugar with dates (added vanilla extract instead of lemon juice), HALF the sugar in flour/oat mix AND MELTED THE BUTTER with part OIL to equal 1/2 cup and it held together beautifully. YUM.

These are to die for, but omit the 1/3 c. brown sugar...dates are sugary sweet anyway; the extra sugar would be overpowering. These are addictive!

Chopping the dates was the hardest part in this recipe, but it was worth it. The results were very good - rich and not-too-sweet, similar to the ones I enjoy from Starbucks. I translated 3/4 pounds of dates to around 2 cups, and added chopped pecans on top of the crust. Mine didn't hold together all that well, but great eaten with a spoon and a cup of tea.

These are really good, almost like my Grama used to make. I only gave it 4stars because It needs a couple changes. Next time I will double the date filling (no sugar to the dates, they are sweet enough on their own) And double the pan size. I found these had too much crust for my taste, so instead of down sizing the crust I will up the filling and make a larger pan, because let's face it, you will always want more.

Update: I wanted to make a healthy batch for myself, so I used Splenda brown sugar blend, and it worked fantastic. I also subbed 1/2 the butter for applesauce, now I should really know better, usually anything with this type of crust you shouldn't use applesauce, but there were reviews stating they used applesauce and they loved it. NO!!! Do not use apple sauce, the crust is completely nasty then, it is too chewy and just wrong. Some times you just can't give up the bad butter that makes everything taste so good, and this is one of those times.

Very similar to a recipe from my Mom. If you like really sweet date squares, add the brown sugar to the dates, otherwise, leave it out as they are naturally sweet on their own. Don't bother dicing dates - put them in the saucepan and cook a little longer if needed but they soften up nicely and it saves a whole lot of time. You might need to add a touch more water and watch them that they don't burn. Only other comment is that I add in a bit more oats and mix the crumble by hands till you get your preferred consistency. The crumble made according to recipe is a bit buttery so I added about an additional 1/2 cup of oats. Very good and thanks. I had to make it as soon as I saw the recipe pop up on the "daily".

Oh my goodness these were amazing.  Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe.  This will be a regular thing in my house.  After I cut the squares I froze them and micro'd them when I was in the mood for a treat.  They heat well in the micro.

Date squares are one of my favorites and this is the first time I attempted to make them. Somehow I always thought dates would be too hard to work with to have any kind of success. I read alot of the reviews and incorporated many of the suggestions into my personal preference.   I don't care for too much base or topping, so I had extra left over; I just froze it for my next batch. The suggestion to bake the base for 15 min before adding the filling was the best idea!!    The sweetness to the filling is just as I like  and I added vanilla for good measure. These are even better the next day once the flavors have blended together. Thanks for this great recipe Michelle.

I make this every week for my children to have as muesli bars. There would be a riot if I did not. the recipie is fine as is, however I routinely make the following alterations and its sublime
1. Add 1/2 cup toasted slivered almonds, 1 cup coconut flakes and 2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds to the crumble. Cut the sugar in the crumble by half (or double everything in the recipe but the sugar)
2. Add butter until the crumble is 'Crumbly' then divide your mixture in half. Add an egg-white (or two) to the half you will use as a base then if required more butter to make it 'mushy' bake this for 10-20 minutes until golden, this ensures your bars will never fall apart.
3. The date mix can be substituted for any dried fruit, I have also found I can mix canned fruit and dried fruit, and even fresh fruit and jam. As long as I have a wet but not runny spreadable consistency. The children beg for pear and raspberry, apricot and ginger, date and sultana, and love hunting the market for new flavor combinations. I tend to cut the sugar in the fruit layer as much as possible. I always saucepan cook it until I have a nice tasting mixture with the right consistency.
4. After spreading with the crumble and re baking I let them cool and then cut them into muesli bar size slices and store in the freezer for the children to take and put in their daily lunchboxes. They tell me they could make a fortune on selling them, but they don't care to give them up.

This recipe helped me recreate a comforting memory of my own grandmother's date squares. I made only one minor adjustment, and that was a dash of vanilla extract (I went overboard) into the dates as I stewed them. They created a very gooey and rich bar, which may be too decadent for some tastes. Next time I try this I'll elect to use slightly less sugar, but otherwise this is a very simple and delicious recipe that any novice baker could easily take on. I am very happy with how they came out.

NOTE ABOUT DATES: I had to pit my own dates, and I discovered a few had some sort of insect eggs and even a dead bug inside them and had to be discarded. It's not uncommon to find a few in a batch that have been infiltrated by pests, so BE SURE TO CHECK BEFORE YOU DICE.

these are the dates squares i was looking for soo bad!! finally i found them!! yey!! they are sooo prfect!! i agree, DO NOT add sugar to the dates, they are too sweet! the only changes i did were, first, i divided sugar into 3/4 splenda (white original splenda)  and 1/4 brown sugar they came out perfectly! also instead of 2 teaspoons of lemon juice i divided it into 1 tsp lemon juice and 1 tsp vanilla! they are sooo deliciouslyy addictive! i totaly recommend it and i will be doing this recipie over and over again!!! 10 stars!!! I used all purpose flower, it works perfectly too! because my pan was a little bit larger i had to make more crust, i wont agree to the reviewer who said more filling would be better, i think the amount of filling is perfect for the amount of crust! they held soo perfect! i just loved this recipe.

We didn't care for these even though we love dates. There was WAY too much crumb mixture. I could have used half for the crust and the crumb top. The filling was boring and the whole bar was very crumbly. I was going to throw them out, but my husband said that he would eat them if he go desperate. Sorry....

yes 10 stars indeed. although I did use cranberries and followed the advice of other reviews for the crispier crust. These bars only lasted a day and a half in our house, it is like something from Starbucks.

These are AWESOME! I wanted to make a healthier version so I substituted the pastry flour for whole wheat, and halved the sugar in the crust, completely left it out of the filling (dates are sweet anyway) and used 1 cup applesauce instead of butter. Also I only used 8 ounces of dates because that's all I had on hand and just squeezed half a lemon into the filling mixture. I added maybe a tablespoon of kairo syrup to the filling, to help it thicken. I don't know if it would have tasted better if I hadn't altered the recipe, but these tasted amazing the way I made them!! And they were super duper easy.

Fantastic!  I too baked the crust.  I baked it too long.  I would suggest only 5 or 10 minutes.  Instead of lemon I use vanilla....love it best that way.

Very good recipe. I doubled the recipe and it turned out great, use a very large pan or you will end up with rearly thick squares.

Great Recipe.   Made as listed.  Just the right amount of sweet.  

Next time I will use a 9 x 13 so the crust will be thinner and more like store bought texture, but would not change the flavor one bit.

Really enjoyed this simple recipe.  Followed Lorrie recommendation and worked out perfect.  I used date paste Majool that I seasoned with cinnamon, nutmeg, and cardamon. No sugar added to date mix.  Be sure to add cinnamon to the oat/flour mix. Oh and Allpurpose flour works fine.

Absolutely delicious!  Changes I made based on reviews and personal preference: 1) For the 3/4 C butter, I used 1/4 C butter, 1/4 C coconut oil and 1/4 C applesauce. I melted before adding to my dry mix.  . 2) Used whole wheat flour, worked great.   . 3) Halved the sugar in the crust and omitted it entirely from the dates. Can't imagine adding it--would be WAY too sweet.  . 4) Added some cloves, cinnamon and allspice to the date mix, which gave a spicy Fall flavor. May leave them out next time as it masked the date flavor.   . 5) Precooked the bottom crust for 15 min, no problems with mine falling apart.  . Thanks for such a lovely recipe!

Real winner in my household. Instead of dicing the dates, went ahead and cooked them, then gently processed with an immersion blender (the wand ones), until a thick, slightly chunky puree. Was easy and spread nicely in the pan. May be able to use a standard blender or food processor.

I found this recipe about a year ago and have made it at least 25 times.  It is absolutely wonderful and has a good fiber content.  The only thing I do differently is that I don't add any additional sugar to the date filling as the dates are sweet enough. Thank you so much for posting this recipe!

In Canada, we have a Bulk Barn, where you can find chopped dates.  You can buy just what you need and no extra work.

I did as one reviewer suggested and only used 1 cup of oats and flour and this turned out FAHBULOUS!  If you really pat the topping down into the pan, I found it held together fine.

So good.  I just LOVE date bars, and this was my first attempt at making them.  Delicious!

I've prepared this recipe 6 times and used the the exact ingredients every time. I wouldn't change a thing. My wife tells me her mother use to make them and they were not as mushy. I'm sure this is not a complaint though. I have trouble keeping some for me. She eats most of them and gives some to her co-workers bragging my ability. GREAT RECIPE it's a keeper.

Made these for my parents and they LOVED them.  I used vanilla instead of lemon juice.  I actually goofed on the recipe and used 1 cup of butter so to make up for it I added 1/2 cup extra rolled oats.  They couldn't tell so why should I? ;)  If you like date squares then use this recipe.

OMG these are great and i changed 2 things
I didn't add any sugar to the dates 
I also pre-baked the first layer so that it wouldn't crumble as much.
Love it thank you so much for sharing.

I felt there was too much sugar in the crumble for my taste. Will make this recipe again but will cut the sugar in the crumble by a third or half.

I liked the flavor and texture of these, but I found there was WAY too much crust/crumb mix.  Instead of having these as nice finger desserts, they will have to be served in a bowl b/c they are very thick and huge.  Next time I will make them in a 9x13 so they turn out smaller.

I have made this recipe a few times in the past - but I should make it more. It's a winner and my husband LOVES them. I do make some changes as suggested in the reviews. 1 cup of orange juice instead of water, 1 tsp. lemon juice and dates cuts up with scissors (much easier this way). I did NOT add brown sugar to the date mixture either - like many reviews explained, dates are naturally sweet! I did not use pastry flour as I did not have any - regular flour worked just as good. I do not even know what the difference is? Melted 3/4 cup butter and added this to the oat / flour / brown sugar dry mixture. Either combine with your fingers or a wooden spoon. Baked the bottom part of the dry mixture in a 350 degree oven for 15 minutes, then added the date mixture, spreading evenly. Finished off with the rest of the dry crumbly, buttery mixture on the top. Bake in 350 degree oven for 25 mins, let cool, cut and serve. It's excellent,  they are sooooooooooooooooo (groan...Mmm ... oooOOOAAAOOOooo) mouth- wateringly delicious.

Good recipe! I did make a few changes. Halved sugar in crumble and none in dates. And I used coffee instead of water to make the filling.

 I found the crumble very dry, next time I will melt the butter first or use a little extra. i had quick-cooking oats which I think made it drier so no fault to your recipe!

These were excellent and easy to prepare. I was surprised at how easy it was to make the date filling. I didn't add sugar to it as other reviewers suggested, and thank goodness; they were just perfect. This recipe is versatile where the date filling could be substituted for a different fruit mix like dried apricots, or something similar.

These were pretty good. Not the best date squares I have ever had, but not bad either. Chopping the dates is somewhat time consuming, but the rest of the recipe is very little work. I would make these again as part of a dessert tray. Thanks!

Very, very good.  I used whole medjool dates that I pitted and diced and used spelt flour in place of pastry flour.  I also used both lemon juice and vanilla in the dates.  My mom and I used to make these from a boxed mix when I was a kid, and we loved them.  These are even better than what I remember.  Thanks for bringing back the memories!

The combination and quanities makes this recipe "just like mom's", but the pan size is too small.  There is too much crust for a 9" square pan.  The crust just falls apart.  A 9 1/2" X 13 1/2" is a better size.

There are so many issues with this recipe that I couldn't give it a good review.  First off, it doesn't say that you should use parchment paper on the bottom.  Secondly, it doesn't say to let the date mixture cool before filling it on to the first layer. Thirdly, it doesn't say to cooked the bottom layer for 10 minutes first, but you need to. Fourthly, it doesn't say to put the date mixture in a food processor to chop up that irritating date skin, but it does help quit a bit and improves the texture.

I baked these up with some changes. I added pecans and took the tip from Lorrie about baking the bottom crust in the oven for 15 minutes. (I actually baked mine about 17 minutes.)  I pulsed my flour, oats, pecans and other dry ingredients in a food processor with chilled butter. ( I didn't read Lorrie's tip of softening butter until this step was complete but the bottom turned out perfectly solid). I wish I would have skipped adding the brown sugar to the dates! They don't need sugar and I do think it diminishes the dates' flavor profile.
 Next time I will increase the dates to one pound. I added vanilla to my dates after cooking.  I did microwave my remaining oat mixture a little bit to soften the butter before adding to the pan. All in all, we liked the finished product.

Sooo delicious and I especially loved the crust. So moist and melts in your mouth. I reduced the sweetness by using only 3/4 cup brown sugar for crust and 1/4 cup in the filling and was still super sweet. Next time I may halve the sugar.

I also did not use sugar with the dates. I used apple sauce, butter & coconut oil. It seems to hold the oats together(coconut oil). I also baked the bottom layer first.
Thank-you very much for the basics, I just added my own touch.

This was an excellent recipe with just a few changes taken from previous reviews!  I used melted butter in the crust and baked the bottom before adding the filling.  I did not use brown sugar in the filling.  Really really good! I love the crunch you get from using the melted butter.  This is definitely a keeper!

This is a delicious recipe! I've never made date slice before and this was a great one for me to experiment with. I made a few adjustments as I went along..
- added 1/2 Cup of dessicated coconut to the base mixture.
- only used 1 dessert spoon of brown sugar in the filling and added 1/2 cup of chopped dried apricots. I also added lemon zest to the filling mixture as well as the juice. 
- I crumbled the mixture on top so it didn't cover the filling as a whole, and added chopped walnuts and coconut to this mix too. 
I'll definitely be making this again - it was a hit with the flatmates :-)

Very good.  I prefer recipes that use more oatmeal than flour, but they make a messy square, where this recipe is better for serving.  Could use less sugar in dates.

Mine came out a little bit dry, but that's because I used less butter and also mixed with apple sauce. But it was still delicious! Used 9" square pan and they only lasted 1 day. I added no extra sugar for the date mixture and added 1 t of vanilla. I will try again with orange zest, etc.

Sensational! I used the tips that others spoke of, particularly the one about the butter being mushy and sort of melted. A pastry chef friend of mine has asked me to make her a batch!!!!

I added a full cup of butter as Lorrie suggested and baked the base for 15 minutes before adding the date filling. They cut well and taste great! If you like dates you should try this recipe. Thanks Michelle for posting this great recipe.

Tried this recipe today.  They turned out great!  As a few other reviews mentioned the sugar in the dates, I did not add it either.  If you have a very sweet tooth, by all means add it.  I only had an 8x8 pan so I had to bake them  about 30 minutes but really enjoyed the result.  If they start to get browner than you like, just place a piece of foil over them to slow/stop the browning. I would recommend this to anyone,

I followed the recipe exactly, it turned out wonderful, I ended up making two smaller pans lined with parchment paper (disposable tins, easier to take places if need be)  I got the best praise ever.. the words we all want to hear "Wow better than Mom's!" lol thank you!!

oatmeal, brown sugar and butter are my baking trifecta so this recipe did not disappoint. I did increase the butter from 3/4 c to 1 full cup and added only a couple of tablespoons of brown sugar to the date filling as extra sweetening is not needed.

These were very good. Although after reading the reviews I took the advice of using less sugar. I doubled the recipe, filling a 9x11 pan, and only added 1 c of brown sugar to the crust. The date filling turned out sweet enough without the br sug.  I'll be making these again and again!

These should be called Amazing Squares.  They are excellent, very delicate and rich in flavor.  The only thing I would recommend is, after heating the dates I pureed them when they cooled and then spread them on the base.  This is the only date squares I make now, it is a keeper.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Great recipe, I used all purpose flour, and it tasted great.  I used chopped dates bought from the bulk store.  They worked out just fine.  No messy prep.  Worth the little extra cost, with no change in taste.

This is a fabulous recipe! Exactly what I was looking for. The squares set nicely and held together.  As per some reviews, I packed down the crust very well and baked the crust for 6 mins - while the dates were cooking. I also didn't add the sugar to the dates because the dates I bought were "honey dates" and quite sweet as they are. I packed down the topping, too, the best I could, and the result was great!

absolutely delicious! Other than chopping up sticky dates, this was the easiest recipe and was extremely tasty!! I tried baking the bottom layer of "crumble" first and i did help make a more solid crust.

This is the best data square recipe I have ever found.  As others, I eliminated the sugar in the dates.  I also used melted butter - took some of the work out of mixing.  Fast and easy to prepare.

Great texture and flavour! For anyone with some Mincemeat-Raisin pie mixture left over in the jar/fridge...use it instead of the dates or with them to the same measures. Cheers!

These are so delicious and really easy to make, unlike some viewers thought. The only extra work is chopping the dates, so how hard could that be! I baked them in a 8X8 in. Pyrex pan. Everyone loved them! Next time, I will try them with orange juice instead, including the zest, cuz my mom said they would be even better. Thanks a lot for sharing the recipe, it was awesome!

I made a batch of these for my mom because she loves date squares.  They were FANTASTIC!!  The whole family thinks they're a big hit.  The only change I made was to add a 1/4 cup more butter to the crust, a suggestion by another rater.  Try this one!!

Like many other users, I omitted the sugar from the date mixture, used only all-purpose flour, and pre-baked the bottom crust for 8 minutes.  Absolutely amazing. Another tip: they MUST cool completely before you eat them. The flavors develop and they will not fall apart.  5 stars.

These bars are really good. I did bake the bottom crust for 10 minutes before spreading the date filling. I also added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts to the filling. Otherwise followed the recipe.

This was delicious. Made it for my seniors group that I volunteer with. I try to make them things that they baked themselves or that were popular when they were younger. We call this matrimonial cake in Canada. I have never found a reason why. I baked the bottom as recommended and left out the extra sugar and it was perfect. Thanks for sharing.

I cut the sugar by 1/4 from both filling and crust simply b/c dates are so sweet normally, I also had to cook it about 20 minutes longer but it is a keeper. I'm going to try figs in it next!

Excellent recipe! I replaced the water, lemon and brown sugar with orange juice, and then cooked the dates in it in the microwave. Yummy!

You can make it better and here's how...
 3 cups of oats for thicker base and top, 1 cup of flour instead of 1 1/2, one cup of melted butter, also add coconut and walnuts to your liking.  Bake for 40 minutes.  Add dark rum to the dates as well.  People rave about them.

Great recipe. I wanted 9X13 pan so I increased flour and oats to 1/34 cup, butter to just under a cup, skipped the sugar in the dates but added 1/2 cup more water, 1/3 cup  candied fruit, 1/3 cup currents, 1/3 raisins  and some orange zest. I call them Improve   date squares!
Use your imagination and what you have in the pantry when it's snowing and you don't want to go out.  That's how recipe's are made!

Very good! Like another commenter I used a full cup of butter, did not add sugar to the date mix, and baked the bottom layer for about 5 minutes before completing the squares. These turned out so good!

My mother's favourite recipe was misplaced when she moved and so, I was looking for a replacement. This recipe was the highest rated and rightly so. The date squares are delicious. 

The only change that I made was to increase the amount of water - The dates that I bought were in a package which was a little over a pound.

Out of nostalgia I made this recipe for myself not expecting the boys (11,14, 16) to like them. To my surprise they not only liked them they loved them and the entire pan of goodies disappeared in no time. Enjoy I did !!

Awesome !! 2nd year trying this recipe. First time found it too much crust. So I tried again,, but instead of decreasing oatmeal and flour.. I keep it all the same,,, but just added a larger pkg of dates into a 9 X 13 pan. I also added some almond extract. No sugar in dates as others said,, as well as baking bottom crust for 5-10 mins before adding filling. With my minor adjustments it is the most perfect date square yet,, my "only" recipe for this now. Thanx so much !! Keeper !!

Turned out great! Date squares are my favourite and you have to try really really hard to make a bad batch. 
Things I did because I can
-no brown sugar with the date layer*** dates are natures sugar
-added chopped pecans for a crunch
- doubled amounts of lemon juice with fresh sqeazed lime, you can really taste it
Things I will try next time
-less sugar in the crust
- give a higher oats vs flour ratio, it didn't seem look right
-cook for 30 minutes, 25 isn't enough to give the crumble layer texture. Maybe it's my oven...

This was way too sweet. I had to cut the sugar by more than half. There is also too much of the crumb mix and not enough dates. I loved the recipe initially but I realize that I always had to adjust the ingredients for it to come out to my liking.

Rich and delicious!! Only made a couple of minor changes. Adding brandy was a real treat.
I used all-purpose flour without a problem.
Didn’t have lemon, but added a tsp. of vanilla. I used 8 oz. of chopped dates and 8 oz. of Craisins. Replaced half cup of water with good brandy. Added a bit extra liquid, because I had a tad extra fruit. You could do without the 1/3 C. brown sugar in the filling.
Baked the bottom crumb layer at 350 for about 7 minutes, per other reviewers, then added the fruit and top crumb layer and baked another 25 min. Thanks, Michele -- will be making this one again.

very good! and that's coming from one who isn't a fan of dates! 

I happened to have some dates in the cupboard that I really wanted to get rid of, and this is the best way! :) even my hubbie didn't mind them.  They freeze well, I 1/2 the batch in the freezer to have later.

Love these squares - I have already made them several times. Per other suggestions, cut sugar in half, skipped it altogether in dates, used 1 cup of butter, added one more lemon's juice to the date mixture, pre-baked the lower crust for 15 min, sprinkled dates with sesame seeds. Thank you so much for such a wonderful recipe!

This is delicious! The crust is crunchy and crumbly and the filling is super sweet. After reading some of the reviews I made some changes to this recipe. Instead of pastry flour I used 1/2 of a cup of all-purpose flour and 1/2 of a cup of wheat flour. I cut the brown sugar down to 1/2 of a cup as well. I also used a 1/2 cup of butter and added in a little less than 1/4 of a cup of olive oil.
   For the date filling, I omitted the brown sugar and increased the water to about 2 cups as it kept evaporating. To make the filling chunk-free I pureed it in a blender. Then I added vanilla extract and cinnamon, instead of lemon juice. This is a great recipe that can easily be adapted to make it healthier!

I haven’t a clue how many cups of dates are in 3/4 lb. and having bought the dates in bulk at an Asian market and not owning a scale, I added just enough chopped dates to reach the top of the water in the pan – approximately 2 cups.  I followed other reviewers’ advice and omitted the brown sugar in the date mixture which I cooked on low until they were thick and had a jam consistency.  Overall, it was a good dessert bar but I would have preferred less sugar in the crumb mixture.  They were very sweet but good.

I don't like date squares but I made these for my husband.  He said they were the best date squares he had ever eaten.  Plus, I fed them to his father and other men, and they all said they were the best they have ever tried.

I followed some of the other viewers suggestions. I added more butter and baked the bottom crust for 10 minutes or so. I omitted the salt and baking soda since pastry flour was used. Also the butter was unsalted (always should be unless otherwise stated but I don't always have it on hand). I did add a tablespoon of brown sugar to dates but really don't need it. Very easy recipe and after the adjustments, turned out yummy!

I think this is probably an excellent recipe as it was beautiful, the crust and topping was delicious, and the date filling was a nice consistency and very moist.  I'm just realizing though that I don't particularly like dates.  I imagine that if you do like dates this is what you would be looking for.  I might try this with an apricot filling and if I do I'll update this review.

Good recipe, but too sugary. I didn't add any brown sugar into the date mixture and next time I make it I'll use 1/2 of brown sugar in the dough mixture.

Delicious! Also economical and easy to make. I reduced the sugar by about a third, and used only 1/2 cup of butter and it worked great. I also used a 9x13 pan because I don't have a 9x9, and that was no problem either. Thanks!

Awesome Recipe! Followed recipe directly as written and it came out so Good! Thanks for sharing! Only Substitution made was I used Splenda brown sugar instead of regular due to having a diabetic in the family.

I am rating these 3 stars because to me they were WHY too sweet!  I probably would add maybe 1/4 cup brown sugar next time and thats it!  Also they were a bit too oily!  I love dates so i wanted to try these...i will make again without adding all the butter and sugar next time.

I didn't change a thing and they are wonderful. I bought the 1 lb 'chunk' of dates. I didn't need to chop anything. Just simmered them until they were soft (added water as needed) and then mashed the dates right in the pot.

These are delicious.  I have made them twice.  Too sweet??  What is that?  I made them exactly as directed except the second time I omitted the soda from the crust.  Also cook the bottom layer first in the oven and they will firm up.  350 degrees for 10 minutes.  Oh yeah, I almost forgot, I added about one cup chopped pecans to the date filling after removing from heat.  I love them!

Excellent way to get the kids some more fiber in their diets! I ommitted the additional sugar called for with the dates, and it was sweet enough. Also cut back on the butter, using applesauce instead. Great recipe!

I love this, I made the recipe exactly like it said except i didn't do a thing to my dates. I bought them in a sqare pkg so once they came apart and cooked down I was pleased with the little hunks of dates. Anyway, I suppose omitting sugar is a good idea since it iss really sweet. I'll definitely try that next time.

Great date squares.  I used spelt flour and added ground flaxseed to make them a little healthy.  I think next time I would add more dates too. Thanks for posting this recipe!

THESE WERE AWESOME! My mom used to make these as I was growing up and she's not sure where her recipe is. This is very close to the ones she made. My daughter even asks me to make them :) I also omitted the brown sugar out of the date filling and it was yummy. Thanks for sharing!

Yummmy!!!!!!  The only thing I did differently was to omit some of the brown sugar.  I didn't add any sugar to the date mix, and only used 1/2 cup sugar in the flour mix.  It came out delicious!  Next time I just go by the advice of some of the other reviewers and use some applesauce to replace some of the butter, and maybe even omit the brown sugar altogether (or maybe just 1/4 cup or so)  Very delicious.  Will make again!! A+

This is a great recipe, one of my husband's favorites. I use the packaged dates and prepare them just like the recipe states (plus 1/2 t cinnamon), only I puree them after they cook for awhile. I have tried following others' suggestion of using orange juice instead of water and my husband hated it. I thought the orange flavor overpowered the dates. Last time I made it, I had broken my 9" pan so I used the 8" and it still turned out great.

The kids ask for these weekly.  I separate the bottom layer into another bowl and add a little more butter then prss it down hard for a stronger bottom crust.

Very, very good!  Until recently, I didn't even think I liked dates, until I tried (relatively) fresh ones.  And those dates made awesome date squares with this recipe.  I didn't add the extra 1/3 cup sugar to the dates and I dotted the top crust with extra butter.  My boyfriend, also not a fan of dates, loves them!  Yay for Michelle's Gramma!

I haven't try this recipe yet, but I have a recipe almost exactly like this, also from my grandmother! It's really interesting to see a similar recipe.

The recipe from my grandmother is more plain, with no spices. And, we use ghee, instead of butter. There would be a good taste of salt in the oat layer, so that it balances the sweetness from the dates layer. The ladies in my family have been making these for years, and everyone loves them!

oops I forgot to add that I doubled the recipe when I made them so when I say .5-1 cup less sugar, thats from 2 cups. Either way the date squares are good. I cant believe I doubled the recipe and ate all of them myself in 3 days. augh.

Hubby gave them five stars.  Found that the top oatmeal layer was very crumbly until the next day. Not sure if the amount of dates I used was correct as I didn't read through the recipe carefully enough before I started (oops) and I don't have a kitchen scale and also think in metric, so I did some quick mental conversions.  Anyway, the date layer was pretty thick, but that's a good thing.

These are EXCELLENT!  I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 pan, so they were a tad thick, but the were really really good.  The filling is so incredibly tasty, and the crumb is just delicious!  Everyone who had one loved them, and this will definitely be my date square recipe from now on!  I cannot even express how divine they are!!!

Although my husband said these date squares didn't come close to his grandmother's, my co-workers gave them two thumbs up.  Next time I will follow some of the other suggestions and use a larger pan to make thinner squares as well as use oj in place of the water and see if the ole' hubby likes them any better!

I also followed someone's suggestion and used orange juice instead of the water. I reduced the amount of flour and oats. They came out perfect!

Everyone LOVES these! I've had more people than I can count ask me for the recipe or compliment me on them. I have adjusted it by adding more brown sugar to the filling just to make it a bit sweeter. But definitely a winner!

I made a double recipe in a 13 X 9, and we thought these turned out like breakfast bars (yuck).  However, even given that I made them a bit too thick, I still wouldn't try these again.  The date filling wasn't sweet enough, and the pastry wasn't interesting.  You win some, lose some!

I make these all the time now. Great cookies. I add much more lemon juice than in the recipe, something like 2 tbsp. I also rub in just a wee bit more butter into the topping mixture. That keeps it together and makes it really moist too

Delicious. I doubled and followed advice to bake first layer and omit sugar from date mixture. Sprinkled powdered sugar to serve which made them prettier.

I have made this recipe a few times and my husband is always asking me to make them again. He takes them to his retired fellows' coffee group and they love them. I did make a couple of changes. I feel that the dates are sweet enough without the addition of brown sugar to the date mixture. The other change I made was because I didn't have any lemons, almond flavour or vanilla on hand but I did have some rum which I had used for my Christmas cakes. They were yummy with the rum. I have since made them with the lemon juice and they are still great.

Fantastic date squares. This right here is the REAL DEAL! A pleasant explosion of flavours in your mouth.  I've never tasted anything as authentic as this before - certainly restaurant quality. The crust tastes like superior quality shortbread. 

I read some reviews, so I cut the the sugar in the crumb mixture by half, and added only 1 tablespoon of sugar to the date mixture, and it was still sweet enough. 

Thank you for sharing this fabulous recipe Mai. Oh, if your Gramma has more fantastic recipes such as this, please keep them coming. Lol

Made this with my son. It was a bit sticky when we ate it and therefore a bit messy for a toddler. He loves dates though and we are always looking for more to make with dates.

Great recipe. Only modification I made is to increase the butter as suggested and baked the crust. I also added a bit of lemon zest to the dates since I had fresh lemons. Btw I only had somewhat dried out dates that were quite hard. I added a bit more water and cooked them longer until the date filling was smooth and thic k. It worked well

Made this recipe today.  It was great.  As one reader suggested add another 1/4 c. butter and I did.  I did cut back on the brown sugar in the crumb mixture.  Only used 3/4 c.  then in the filling only used 1/4 c.  I found it sweet enough on both parts.  Also I added 1 tsp. vanilla.  So that is the changes I made.  Not many just a tweek.  I will make again.

Omg! These are so delicious, but I did tweak the recipe a little. I used half the brown sugar cause dates are sweet enough. I used 1 cup melted butter. I didn’t bother chopping dates cause they simmered down and I used a fork to mash them a little. Once off the stove I added a splash of vanilla. I sprinkled unsweetened coconut on top of first layer and baked for 15 minutes to crisp up, then put the rest all together. Cooled in fridge before cutting, then fixed myself a nice cup of coffee and sat back and enjoyed. Hope you get to enjoy too cause there’s no more left here lol

Easy to follow.  Great taste the we remember growing up.  The twist was pastry flower so we went with regular all purpose with a bit of  cornstarch as sub.

Turn out all good, and kd-approved!

Delicious recipe.  I had to add additional water to the dates because it was too difficult to spread over the oatmeal base.  Other than that, perfect and delicious!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I actually used TWO square pans for this recipe, which made them thinner and crispier.     They freeze well too, and they are not rock hard when taken out of the freezer.

"Gramma's Date Squares" held together nicely. I subbed the butter with VEGAN BECEL (dairy free) and increased the amount to 1 cup to make the crust hold together better. These were very sweet for my taste, and if I were to make them again strictly for myself I would reduce the sugar by at least half; however, they are perfect for company as is. Thank you Mai Forrester for sharing your recipe.

This was my first time making date squares, so I was a little worried to try it out on company but it was upper easy and tasted just like I remember!  Lots of yummy dates and easy to double the batch (which you should, cause they’re so good).

It was okay... I read the review and made a couple adjustment. I used a whole coupe of butter, baked the bottom crust for 15 minuets first, skipped the extra sugar in the dates, and I added crushed pecans to the top crust for added protein, oh and I used Splenda brown sugar. So I made a lot of changes. Maybe if I would have stocked to the original recipe it would have been better. It was really sweet but was missing something.

I never made these as I have my own recipe. Why would you add 1/3 of cup of brown sugar in the dates, as dates are overly sweet in the first place, that's odd to me.

I used orange juice and orange zest with the dates

I thought the dough part was a bit on the dry side

I will make it again with a few more tweaks including doubling the dates filling

Used Moroccan Vanilla and Rogers Oatmeal porridge which contains flax seed and wheat germ. Froze them in small portions and have them with my coffee in the morning. OMG they are good!

I have always hated date squares, I’d rather you poke me in the eye than make me eat one. But my hubby loves them.  So I finally decided to make some, and use up the pound of dried up dates he bought a year ago and forgot about .  Of course they needed to be sampled, and are they ever good!  I followed the suggestions from the owner of the bakery that makes these every day!  Bravo! Thanks for your hints!

Not enough butter to keep the crusts together. I even took it out of the oven early as the top was getting burnt. :/ Temperature was lower as I am higher elevation. But the centre was great, hence the 2 stars!

This was very good. The only negative was the date layer is too sweet. Next time I will only add a touch of sugar. I also added cinnamon, as it was a bit bland for my taste. Thanks for the recipe.

Outstanding! Wouldn't' change a thing. The only suggestion I'd make is make sure your pan is well greased (I used coconut oil) and pat down well the top layer of oat mixture. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing. This recipe is THE best!

Saddest date squares ever...where are the dates. A real recipe from grandma in my box of classics suggest 2 cups of chopped dates for the same size pan. Hint of Dates is what this recipe should be called.

It was so wonderful , though I made some changes, I used only half cup of sugar in the crust, added full cup of butter, & NO sugar to the date mixture, I added cardimom powder to the dates mixture, I added walnuts to the upper layer of crumble,  it took it to another level .. yummy

First time making date squares and this recipe was simple and easy to modify. I reduced the sugar in dough and omitted completely in date/water mix.  At first these squares seemed crumbly but hardened and were easy to hold when completely cooled.  Highly recommend recipe.

Doubled it. Froze it (I couldn't resist and kept stealing pieces from the freezer-delicious straight from the freezer). Served it thawed and all loved it. I compromised and used half the amount of brown sugar in with the dates.

Made in a 8x8 pan so that the squares would be thicker. Cooked the bottom layer for about 8 minutes to make it a little crispy before I put the date layer on top of it.

A great recipe. Just like my Grandmas too.  I used lemon juice instead of a fresh lemon.  Usually I add about a cupful of raisins, (or even dried cranberries). To supplement the filling and add variety totes old Favorite.  Kate *****

Nikki and Adam loved these.  Will make again.  2nd time added too much butter so had to add more oats and flour.  Next time don't make bottom crust so thick..

Made them a 2nd time and followed 1st reviewed.  Used 1 cup butter, cut sugar in half in crust and In dates. Browned base for 15 mins. Think I put 1 lb dates instead of 3/4 lbs.  awaiting results

Oh boy oh boy! Well, I bought a bag of dates thinking I liked dates (all the while, I was thinking of figs. I have a small child...brain no worky sometimes) - a big bag at costco. So, I came here and found this recipe to make for tomorrow's company. Delicious. My changes: 1. I doubled the butter; 2. I did not add brown sugar to the date mixture and 3. i baked the bottom layer for 15 minutes prior to adding the top two layers. So good - the butter flavor really comes through - the topping and bottom have a great consistency. I read some reviews where salt and baking soda were omitted - I would NOT omit the salt, you just need that little hit of salt and the texture of the mixture is very very good. I want to make this with apples and berries and all sorts of mixed fruits!

Simple & quick to whip up!  I added about a teaspoon of fresh squeezed orange juice for a tangy zest, or you can also zest the peel right in....love these!!!

Easy to make, but a little too sweet.  Agree with others that sugar in dates needs to be removed or reduced.  Otherwise, very nice.

I have made this many times and I love love love it.  It reminds me of the date squares I bought at lunch in the high school cafeteria.  I always get compliments on them and they always want me to give them more when I make the next batch.  I add a little more lemon to taste.  This is my favourite recipe.

These are delicious cookies!  I think the person who said there was too much oatmeal crust, didn't follow the recipe correctly.  Make sure to use a FULL  1 1/2 cups (12 oz.) of whole dates, then chop them up. Cook the date mixture until very thick.  Also pat down the bottom and the top crust to compact it.  Mine turned out perfectly!!

Great recipe! Worked perfectly with suggestions made previously: melt butter,  bake base for 15 minutes and double the recipe! Could not go wrong!
For Christmas I cut back a little on the dates and added a pkg of cranberries. Another great success.

This recipe is so  good that I made three pans of squares to have on hand for Christmas. The base stays together with out crumbling. I added raisins to the dates and it gave a little different taste. Excellent recipe.

I love a simple date square, this is a good one. To our taste, I double the prepared date filling. I also pat the bottom layer firm and bake for 10 minutes. When cooled it is a better base and makes the square easier to cut.  I also just regular flour and they turn out just great. I also, as another review use vanillia instead of lemon, just a smoother flavour

Mine are in the oven right now! I omitted most of the brown sugar in the filling and instead added 1 tbsp with a dash or two of vanilla. I added 1/2 tsp of baking soda to the filling also. Instead of using 3/4 cup of butter I filled the measuring cup with a 50/50 mix of butter, and unsweetened applesauce. Also plan on baking for about 55 minutes at 350 degrees because 20 minutes is not nearly long enough. I am baking in glass but lining with parchmemt paper would have been a great idea!!

I put 1/2 the oat mixture in the bottom and cooked it at 350 for 5-8 minutes.  I used 1 and 1/2 cups of chopped dates , a bit less than 1 cup of water and I only put 1 tbsp of brown sugar in with the dates cause they are sweet anyway. Make sure there is enough butter to make the oats stick together.

1 cup butter instead of 3/4 co
1/4 co chopped pecans to top crumbs
Pressed bottom later firmly and baked for 15 min. Then added filling and crumbs. I made a fig filling, but this could have many other fillings and be delicious

These are very good.  I was excited to find this recipe because my mom used to make date bars all the time when I was little but she didn't have the recipe anymore.  I see that a lot of people omit the brown sugar for the filling.  Though dates are very sweet,  I left the brown sugar in the filling because it adds to the flavor profile, not just the sweetness.  I think the recipe is great as is :)

My family loves date squares or matrimonial cake.  Whatever you call it they love it! 
I took the advice of others and baked the base for a few minutes and then placed the filling and top layer of crumbs. Made a big difference in the 'sturdiness' of the bar.
I did not add sugar to the filling but added cold coffee instead of water. 
Good recipe! I will definitely make it again.

I will make this recipe again, and again, and again...  After putting half of the crumble in the pan, I baked it at 350 degrees for fifteen minutes. For the filling instead of the full cup of water I added 1/4 cup of orange juice and 3/4 cup water and did not add any sugar to the date mixture. The date squares turned out perfectly and reminded me of time spent with my Grandma as a young girl making date squares in her kitchen

very good recipe I followed the other reviews suggestions to add a full cup of butter on the crumble and baking it 15mins. i think the crumble would be much more deliscious if there was a  bit of cinnamon flavor to it as well. I'll definitely make this again but i would put cinnamon on the crust all in all. this is delicious. thank you

I'll definitely make again, but I did change recipe. I had no dates, so I used Craisins(dried cranberries, and instead of water I used orange juice. They were even better than date squares, and I love date squares. I served with vanilla ice cream and Canadian maple syrup drizzled over top. Perfect, not too sweet no sour taste from cranberries either.

This is a definite make-again. I have always loved date squares but this is the first time I've made them.  Based on other reviewers' suggestions, I made the following modifications:
slightly reduced flour to 1  1/4 cup to make crust a bit more moist/less crumbly; omitted sugar from filling - I found it plenty sweet without any extra; doubled the filling (the crust-to-filling ratio seems very high in the original recipe) and baked in two square pans; packed crust and baked for 10 min prior to adding the filling (for structural integrity!); simply cut dates in half with scissors instead of dicing. Delicious!

I was not sure what to expect but these are surprisingly delicious!  Having never used or eaten dates before, I bought a large container for a different recipe.  I went looking for a way to use some of them up & came across this recipe.  So glad I did, absolutely love them!  I doubled the recipe & put it in a 9x13 pan.  I was short of brown sugar,  so substituted the rest as white sugar with a little maple syrup.  Additionally, I didn't have enough  rolled oats so substituted steel cut for the rest.  The result is really good!  I will try again with the correct ingredients but have no doubt that it will still be delicious!

Delicious! I took advice of others and added 1 cup total of butter for the crumble mixture, and baked the bottom layer for about 8 minutes so it held together perfectly when cut. I just added about a tablespoon of brown sugar in the date filling, and added a tsp of vanilla when I took it off the heat.

I make these bars all the time and my family loves them. Don't have pastry flour? No problem. Just measure out your all purpose flour (for this recipe, that would be 1 1/2 cups). Now remove 3 tablespoons of the flour and replace with 3 tablespoons of corn starch. Use a whisk to mix thoroughly, then proceed with recipe. I love this recipe.

I made the recipe with a few changes.  I doubled the ingredients listed and chopped about 1 cup of walnuts in my food processor to add to 2/3 of the dough I saved for the bottom. That left 1/3 of the dough to make a topping.  I spread the dough out in a  12X16 baking pan.  I cooked it in a preheated 375 degree oven  for 15 minutes (Others had recommended baking the bottom layer a little bit before adding the dates and the top layer.)   I cooked down the dates with lemon juice and added the brown sugar.  I put the cooked date mixture into my food processor and whipped the dates to a creamy, spreadable consistency.  I spread this on top of the baked layer while both were still warm.  I added about 1/2 cup extra brown sugar, 1 TBL cinnamon and 1 TBL vanilla to the remaining dough along with a little more melted butter to make a "streusel" topping  to add to the top of the dates and returned the pan to the oven for 20 minutes longer.  I let the pan cool and cut into small squares to serve in  small candy-type paper cups.  I did drizzle some lemon-flavored icing over the top of the pieces.  OMG!  YUM! (Angie Fort Wayne)

I like to read suggestions and then make a combo recipe of my own...I used 1 cup butter, and added a teaspoon of vanilla extract....I put vanilla in everything. For the filling I left out the extra sugar, but used 1/2 c water and 1/2 c orange juice, next time I would double the filling, but I love a thick date centre! thanks for the recipe and reviews!

Good stuff. I added some vanilla essence to the date mixture. Not sure about the baking soda, I may put less or none at all the next time.
I used 1/2 cup melted butter and 1/2 a cup of pure coconut oil.
I also cut down the sugar by half in the flour and added cinnamon, sweetened coconut and more oats.
Used more dates than called for and put 1/8 cup of brown sugar.

These are the best, I use this as a base, omit the 1/3 c. brown sugar...dates are sweet enough with out the extra sugar.  Extra lemon extra dates,  the more filling the better!

I used half dates and half figs,threw in some dried apricots (all chopped) and only about a Tbsp of Cane sugar. About 3/4 of the sugar in the crust. This is great recipe as is but very good with my extras thrown in. 
I have revised my rendition again. I rehydrate dried apricots and use one third apricots, one third dates, one third figs. The water from rehydrating the apricots is my cup of water. no sugar in filling and three quarters sugar in oatmeal.

These are FANTASTIC -- they remind me of the ones my Dad used to make while I was growing!  Only giving 4 instead of 5 stars because I made a few modifications, without which I think they would have been too sweet, and ratio of date filling to crumb mixture might have been off for my taste.  1) I eliminated the brown sugar in the dates -- already so sweet, 2) substituted vanilla for the lemon juice, 3) used 1 lb of dates instead of 3/4 lb, 4) baked in an 8x8 pan instead of 9x9 so that they are thicker.  With these changes, this recipe is a keeper!!

This was great!  I was looking for a good date square recipe to use up dates in the fridge. My mom always made awesome ones, but was faster to look here than call her.  I ended up using an 8X8 pan since that is what we have, and they are super tall.  I didn't think I'd like that, but I do! I added pecans into the crumble and it was awesome to have that tasty crunch included.  I might reduce sugar next time, but they aren't overly sweet.

These are wonderful. Having made Date squares before and knowing they can come out dry. I did follow one reviewers suggestion to increase butter and bake first layer. Also I did not put sugar in with the dates.

So disappointed...I just made this recipe and it's all crumbly and falling apart... didn't hold together at all. It was very buttery and sweet tasting but it was the fact that it all falls apart and the top of the squares completely fell off each one that was the most upsetting...the flavour was ok but what a mess. Won't use this recipe again.

Very tasty! I omitted the sugar from the date filling, and could have put less in the crust. I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9 x 13 pan, but this was too small, as it rises quite a bit. Like another reviewer suggested, I baked the crust for 15 minutes before putting the filling and topping on. Delicious.

Made this last night and it was a huge hit! I didn't have pastry flour so I had to substitute with corn starch & all purpose. I also substituted with vanilla extract. I took my dates, sugar, water, extract, & salt and placed al items in the vitamin until it was chopped well. My kids swear they don't like dates, so I thought I would make it have a smoother texture. They loved it!

The end result was somewhat soft. I even left it in the oven for 30 minutes, hoping it will get harder. Maybe less butter next time. It tastes very good, except the added brown sugar to the mix makes the topping sweet. Dates are sweet enough already. I would add some cinnamon next time.

My hubby says they're just like mom used to make! I made a few minor changes also - a little less sugar in the filling and some chopped pecans to only the top layer. The bars were still sweet, but with a subtle nutty flavor on top. The best of both worlds at my house!

Love this recipe, only changes I made were I used a full pound of dates and made two 7x7 pans so the crust was thinner but still thick enough to provide full base and topping. Tastes just like the ones my grandmother used to make.

Yum! I would follow the advice of others that said to add extra butter so that the mixture is not as dry and loose. Other than that, it was a 5 star recipe!

Make sure to use real butter and old-fashioned rolled oats, not quick oats. Husbeast LOVES these, and brags about them at work.

LOVED this recipe, and so did my whole family.  Not sure what kind of dates I used, as they were left here by a party guest and I didn't want them to go to waste (enter finding this recipe).  I did bake the crust part for 15 minutes before adding the filling and topping as other reviewers suggested (thanks guys!), and I used a whole cup of semi-melted butter, but think it would have done fine with only 3/4 cup butter, and without the sugar added to the dates.  They were very sticky and sweet as is.  To quote Rachel Ray:  YUM-O

This is the perfect date square recipe! I have been making these for years and they are always a favorite, even among friends who have never liked date squares in the past. I buy pre-pitted mashed dates and it makes them SO easy to make! I've also made a vegan version by substituting the butter for coconut oil and they still turned out fabulously!

I used a bread pan since I only had enough medjool dates to make half of this recipe. Too bad I didn't go to the grocery store to get more dates for this great recipe.  Based on other reviews, I added more butter and baked the bottom layer. The bars held together

These were really yummy.  They were gooey and satisfying and a great balance of sweet from dates and nutty from oatmeal.

There are just like the ones my mother used to make. I increases the filling by 25% as I prefer more filling and less crust. One thing I discovered was how much the flavour and texture was enhanced by serving them warm. Add a scoop of vanilla ice cream and it becomes a heavenly desert! This is now one of our favourites and I will be making this for friends who are coming to dinner this weekend.

Doubled the recipe (had a few less dates on hand), used 1C butter/normal batch (So 2 C for a double batch) & baked in a 9x13 pan.
Baked crust first while dates were cooking.
Did not dice dates...cooked them whole, then blended briefly.

One thing I did in place of a portion of the water to be added to the dates, I added 1/3 cup of Amaretto and 2/3 cup of water!  OMG the flavor! 

Altogether, great recipe!  So easy and a great addition to Holiday sweets!

I just made these date squares, followed the recipe with out any substitutes or changes and I have to say the date filling is way to sweet.  Even the children said it was too sweet!   I think the next time I make these I will not add any sugar to the date filling and put only 1 cup of flour as some suggested.

Made these tonight, and they are very sweet and delicious. I highly suggest reading Lorrie's review before making these.

I doubled the recipe and used a larger pan. I pre-baked the bottom oatmeal crumb layer for about 20 minutes before adding the date mixture. I used half the brown sugar in the date mixture and it was plenty sweet.

I used Hadley's Medjool dates in the recipe. Very large, sweet and super moist. Spray the knife with "Pam" or coat with oil before chopping dates, and no mess!

When cooking the dates, I substituted brewed coffee for half the water. You can't taste the coffee, but I think it adds a deeper layer of richness.

My husband hates dates but wants me to save a few of these for him.

Making the changes above and allowing to cool completely in the pan makes the bars very easy to cut and serve.

So glad to have discovered this recipe!

Great recipe , followed Lorrie's tips.  Wow that's a lot of butter. Instead of lemon juice to the cooking Parnoosh dates, I added juice of an orange and zest.  Also added chopped walnuts to topping.

I loved this recipe. I've been looking for a good date bar and this is it! I didn't have pastry flour and used all-purpose and it tasted just fine. Other than that, I left the recipe as is and love, love, love it!

These are very good.  I baked mine in a 7x11-inch glass baking dish and found the ratio of crust to filling to be just fine.  I did bake the bottom crust for 10 minutes before layering on the date mixture and top crust and didn't have any problems with crumbling.  Followed one reviewer's idea of cooking the dates in OJ (since I had some extra) -- won't do that again.

These ended up being way too sweet, despite the fact that I omitted the 1/3 cup brown sugar in the filling mixture.   ~Dissapointed. =(

Very good recipe but I did make a few changes.  I didn't add sugar or lemon juice to the dates and didn't both cutting them.  The filling still turned out perfect. I added an egg to two thirds of the crust/topping ingredients then pressed this into the bottom of the pan, then just sprinkled the remaining third on top.  Although they turned out tasty, the top was too loose and shook off while you ate.  I might add more butter to the recipe to help it hold together better next time. Overall, quite good.

Excellent flavor!  I substituted vanilla for the lemon, but I am sure that it would be great either way.

These squares had a good taste however very crumbly.  When I want a square I don't expect to have to put it in a bowl and eat it with a spoon.  If I could figure out how to make them less crumbly then they would be great because the taste is there.  maybe I will serve this with Ice cream over top and eat it out of a bowl!

This was sooooo good.  I happened to find some aluminum pans at the grocery that were slightly smaller than 9 X 13 but larger than 9X9 and the thickness was perfect.  Based on how mine came out, I would think that the 9X9 would be too thick.  I followed other reviewers advice and baked the bottom layer for 10 minutes before putting on the dates and top layer.  I also used the packaged pre-chopped dates to save time.  They already had sugar added to them so I didn't bother adding the brown sugar to the filling.  The recipe was so easy and delicious.  They held together nicely and were moist and sweet and flakey.

I couldn't find my Grandmother's recipe for date squares, but this one turned out to be exactly like the one I was looking for!  Most and not too sweet, these melt in your mouth goodies are a great desert, and as a health freak, I like the fact that they aren't too bad for you! I omitted the sugar in the date filling, and it definitely didn't need it! I also substituted some of the butter with a lighter non-hydrogenated margarine.  Other than that, the recipe was perfect :)

This is almost just like the one my grandma makes! LOVE IT! Only difference is she uses raisins instead of dates and vanilla instead of lemon juice. Awesome! Oh, and her recipe was called Matrimonial Cake.

I love these date bars - they are on the sweet side, so reducing the sugar in the date mixture was an appreciated comment from a number of reviewers.  I make these for picnics in the summer and they're always well received.

Delish!  Absolutely divine while they are still warm and gooey.   My subs: 1/3 of all-purpose flour with whole-wheat flour, halved brown sugar in crust, no brown sugar in filling, and cut out 2 Tbsp of the butter. I used the prior recommendation of 2 c. dates which came out just right.  I also pre-baked the crust while the filling cooked.

I thought it was very easy to make.  I used whole dates and as there were simmering in the water used my sissors snipping the dates as they softened.  No need to chop date prior to putting them in the water.  I too will reduce the sugar in the dates.

These squares are SO yummy, but they require A LOT of work.  I don't make them often for this reason, but they are really like traditional date squares.  Worth a try, but you may not make them often.

These are really delicious.  I follow the recipe exactly only I leave the lemon juice out if we don't have it and I've never noticed the different.  It works fine if you halve it too.  My whole family loves these!

At Christmas my mom used to make filled date cookies. I was craving them but was too lazy to roll out the dough, etc. and this recipe had the same basic ingredients. SO glad I tried it! Tastes great and so much easier than mom's way! (She's asked me for the recipe!)
