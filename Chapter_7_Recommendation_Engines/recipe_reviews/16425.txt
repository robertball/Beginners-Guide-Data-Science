My friends enjoyed this pie a lot.  When making it, I ran into a couple of problems.  The 9" shell I used was too small!  I had so much pumpkin filling left over.  So, I grabbed more cream cheese, and made another 9" pie and 12 little tarts.  This allowed me to use up all the pumpkin mix.  I also found that it was best to let the cheesecake part sit for a little bit before pouring the pumpkin over top.  One comment I received from my friends was that the topping was really sweet.  Might try cutting back on the sugar next time.  Other than that, great recipe!

Hubby loves his pumpkin pie...so I decided to try another recipe other than my regular.  This turned out very good.  We both liked this...I actually liked this one more than the other one I had been using.  Hubby still likes the other one better, hence the 4 star rating.
Will make again....with the family and see what they think.
Thanks for the post.

This is delicious and has a great appearance.  I don't know why more people haven't tried this.  Maybe the ingredients or steps seem overwhelming, but it really is easy and fast.  I used a ready-made crust and mixed each filling layer in my food processor.  I brought it to work to share with my co-workers and everyone loves it.  It's delicious and the topping adds so much flavor and texture.  I am making another one tonight to share with family.  Thank you for a really easy and delicious recipe that looks much harder than it actually is.

This was a delicious pie!  I divided the entire recipe between two pre-made frozen 9" pie shells.  This gave the perfect amount to each pie, and allowed both of the pies to cook evenly.  The only thing I would change on this pie is the amount of topping.  I thought that it was a little heavy.  Next time I make it, I will probably cut the topping amount in 1/2. Thanks a lot for sharing!

I tried this recipe for a family Thanksgiving dinner.  It was a great success.  The recipe is easy (I used a purchased pie shell), easy (used a food processor to mix each layer), and delicious.

My preparation time from gathering the ingredients to putting it in the oven was probably 15 minutes. Easy and delicious.

This was a fun pie to make.  I used a  extra -serving graham cracker crust(pre-made) . I can see how you could easily make 2 pies with this recipe if you were using a regular crust.  I love the taste of graham cracker with cheese cake, so I substituted that in place of a regular pie crust.  I also added a little more sugar to the cream cheese mixture.  The  pie turn out beautifully.  The topping could easily  be cut in half. I would recommend shortening the broiling for the topping.  I almost burned mine after 1 1/2 minutes.  Keep a close eye on it!  I put it in the refrigerator to chill after cooling.  I think you will be impressed with the taste and presentation of this yummy pie.  It has a gourmet appeal to it when completed and it really doesn't take a lot of effort.  Thanks for sharing such a special recipe.

This is the best pumpkin pie we ever had! Everyone in my family loved it. It was so good my husband was braging about it to evryone and my father in law called me asking me to make them one too because he heared it was so delicious. I made my own grham cracker crust and pre baked it. I feared it would be too hard by the time the pie was done baking, but it was perfect and kept the nice crunch for a couple of days (we finished if by the second day). I put the pie in the refrigeratore before adding the pumpkin filling, so the cheese cake will harden and won't float up. I would definitly make this one again and again

I made this for the first time several years ago, and it's now a staple on our holiday table. I will be making it this year with a sugar substitute for the diabetics in our family - they are always missing out on the "fun" foods and I find that Splenda works well in custards and cheesecakes.

I havent baked in a while as I'm diabetic, and I've never really been a fan of Pumpkin pie, but I saw this recipe and gave it a shot.  To begin with, I was using a deep dish 9 in plate and thought that it might need more than the recipe called for.  I did move up the servings to 10, made my own graham cracker crust and that was the perfect ratio to go to.  Now a few changes... I did not use real eggs, preferring to use EggBeaters instead.  I did use Splenda instead of sugar and I used Smart Balance for the pecan topping, but used butter for the cheese layer and I did cut back on the Splenda for the pumpkin section as I had read that some reviewers had said the pumpkin was too sweet, so I cut it back by a quarter. I also adjusted the time to 75 minutes rather than the recommended 65 mins. All in all, I think it came out fantastic.  One other thing I did was when I did the broil of the topping I just took out the rack on my double oven as the top oven is not that tall to get the pie 5 inches from the broiler and placed the pie on the floor of the top oven.  It worked out fabulously and it did take three minutes on the dot in the broiler... I watched it every second it was in there through the window not wanting to have all my work ruined by this critical step.  I will definitely make this again.

Very good! The only thing I do different is add 1 1/2 tsp pumpkin Pie spice in place of the cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg-which is essentially the same thing.  Also I use salted butter and leave out the pinch of salt.  I only needed to broil for a lil over a minute.  Also cover the edge of your pie crust with either foil or a protector because it will burn.  Also wanted to add that if you don't have the evaporated milk- you can use sweetened condensed milk and leave out the sugar in the pumpkin layer.  Very good pie, always a crowd pleaser!

This was just ok.  I made several different pumpkin pie recipes for Thanksgiving this year all from this site.  Everyone agreed that this was good, definately not a bad pie, but was the least favorite of the ones I made. The one that everyone raved about was the Brown Family's Favorite Pumpkin Pie recipe from this site.

This was delicious.  I used a graham cracker crust as another reviewer suggested.  My condensed milk had gone bad, so I was forced to use sweetened condensed milk (and so I didn't add sugar into the pumpkin mix).   The topping was delicious.  This is a keeper.

I made this for Thanksgiving.  It got mixed reviews. My husband and mom liked it. I didn't care for it. The cream cheese portion wasn't sweet enough for me. My husband suggested it may be better on a graham cracker crust. We omitted pecan topping because no one likes them in our family.

I liked this pie.  Looks very nice when finished.  The amount of filling requires a deep dish pie pan. For the pumpkin layer, I scalded milk on the stove and spiced the milk (to infuse the spice) instead of using evaporated milk.  Then I added the eggs to the milk and made a light custard before adding the pumpkin.  For the cream cheese layer, I whipped the cheese with lots of sugar and then folded in the beaten egg (whipping the egg with the cheese can overdue the egg). I poured the cream cheese into the pan crust and let the cheese layer set a little before adding the pumpkin layer.  Since the pie is so thick, I needed to tent the top with foil near the end of the bake (to get the filling to bake completely without cracking/burning the top).  For the topping, I creamed the butter with the sugar and added some maple syrup for taste.

This was one of the best pumpkin pies that I have ever made!  I will be making this a Thanksgiving "must have" from now on.  My hubby loved it!  I followed the recipe exactly (which I seldom do!) and as others have stated, there is a lot of pumpkin filling, so I just didn't use it all.  Fantastic recipe!

I made this as a custard rather than the pie crust and it was a hit.  The cream cheese and pumpkin marbled; I tried to layer it, but was not successful.  The recipe was delicious and I will make it again.  I did use more spices and if you like sweet custard, firmly pack the brown sugar and add a bit more white sugar.

I love this recipe.  I've made is several times and always get praise.  I don't really change very much, except I alsdo add 1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice, and I finely chop the pecans (I think this makes the top layer ever better).  The pumpkin part is too much to fill the pie shell, so I usually fill two small ramakins with whats left.

Eh. The recipe was not accurate and didnt warn you to chill the cheesecake before adding the pumpkin pie or else it would not come out even or that there is too much pumpkin. It didnt taste like a cheesecake to me. It was very quick and easy. I would make it again with many alterations.

The BEST pumpkin pie I've had in a really really long time. I made this for Thanksgiving and took it to a friends house, and then for Christmas I took this recipe home to my sister and she loved it! Neither of are cooks or bakers but it was so easy and we started mixing matching with different pie crusts in no time. Definite family hit. THANKS!

Tried this recipe out a couple days ago for Thanksgiving. It got rave reviews from my visiting family. I'll be making this one every Thanksgiving.

I'll make browns family favorite next time.  This was ok.  I was expecting the cream cheese bottom to be like cheesecake, but it was more like custard.  The strusel topping liquified overnight, so the top was wet.  All around, it tasted ok, the consistency was good and it was pretty when you cut it, but otherwise unimpressive.

Made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it! Left off the pecan layer (since we already had pecan pie) and it was fabulous. Not too sweet, great pumpkin flavor. Took another reviewer's suggestion and froze the cheesecake layer for approx. 30 min before pouring the pumpkin mixture on top.  Wonderful!

delicious, but the cheese layer floated to the top.  i used fresh pureed pumpkin and it was quite thin and maybe was the cause.
