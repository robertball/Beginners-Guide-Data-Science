The cooke seams to taste delicious, but it does not (well excluding the chocolate kiss) the dough does not taste at all good, it is hard and tasteless.

Rich and chocolatey cookies! I made some with the frosting and chocolate kisses, but also left some unfrosted and they were just as tasty. This recipe is a keeper!

They spread when baked.  Needed to add more flour and refrigerated longer to make sure they did not spread.  They are a great looking cookie and taste good, too.
