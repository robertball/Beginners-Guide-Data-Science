It's really tiresome to read "reviews" by people who haven't tried a dish because they think it has too many calories, fat or whatever. The food police need to learn that if they don't like the nutritional values, they are perfectly free to NOT make a recipe, but they have no business giving a recipe they have not even tried a poor rating.

I halved this recipe and still had a half full 9x13 dish (with about 4-5 servings worth). I only used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup since I halved it, otherwise followed instructions and ingredients. We all really enjoyed these!! I think next time I would add a little salt and some pepper to the layers of potatoes for a little more flavor, but the cheese and soup amount was great and I really liked the creaminess from them!

love love love this recipe, i make it all the time. no way does it take 10 mins to prep though. if u are slicing the potatoes and grating cheese by hand, closer to 25-30 mins and with 3 layers of potato it needs to cook closer to 1 hour 15 mins to 1 hour 30 mins. with all that being said....i still love it!!

Very good and easy recipe!  I used two cans of fat free cream of chicken soup because that is what I always have on hand and 2% shredded cheddar cheese with red potatoes and the family loved it.  The only issue I had was that my prep time and cook time were way longer then you have in the recipe.  It was 30 minutes prep and two hours cooking...the cooking time may have something to do with the red potatoes not sure, I did cut them very thin.  Overall I will totally make this easy and pretty healthy recipe again!!

These are by far the best scalloped potatoes we have ever eaten.  We did add some cubed left-over ham in each layer.  I have made many recipes "the old-fashioned way" and am removing all of my other recipes from my files.  Too good to make any other way and so easy!!

This is the best!!! Only thing that I changed was to use russet potatoes, as that's  what I had, and adding about 3/4 cup milk to the mix. I also always use reduced sodium cream  of mushroom soup. Soooo goooood!!!!!!!

Great cheesy dish. As others have suggested, the prep and cooking time are understated. I used 3 potatoes, one can of mushroom soup and halved the rest of the ingredients. I added more liquid which got absorbed. I would serve this again.

I made this recipe for Easter dinner.  The sauce was great but I needed to cook the potatoes close to 1 hour 45 mins.   With this being my first time with the recipe it threw of my ham and other sides.  outside of the cook time discrepancy I will definitely does this one again

I have made this, and will make it again. I cubed a ham steak to mix in, and served with a veggie and apple sauce. The soup gives it a much creamier texture than the thin, runny, milky way my mom made them!
