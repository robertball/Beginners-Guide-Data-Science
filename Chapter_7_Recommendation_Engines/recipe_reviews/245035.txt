This is a good basis for a sauce but it seemed unfinished to me...  it's sweet and not very complex in flavour, which is good and a great start.   If you feel comfortable experimenting to amend to your own tastes I recommend using this as a base and flavouring up to your desire.

I remade adding in half a container of chopped mushrooms, lots more nutmeg and ginger (I did taste test until it tasted right), then I added chopped Italian sausage as others had suggested.  I would have added some red pepper flakes too if kids weren't at the table.

I'll probably continue experimenting with this recipe until I find exactly how I want to tweakmit.

I added ricotta to half the mixture and stuffed manicotti, then poured the sauce over and topped with Parma

Nice recipe, just what I always wanted. I seen the tip you could use any kind of pasta, I tried fettuccine-gluten free! I also substituted the heavy cream for home made Pumpkin Seed Milk, it needed alittle thickening so warmed a few tablespoons of the milk to 1 tablespoon cornstarch. Sooo perfect.  I plan on making it again.

This was a quick and easy recipe. The onions, garlic, and salt bring the most flavor to this recipe so next time I will try to add some additional spices, maybe curry. I added chicken for protein and it was yummy.  Will try with Italian sausage in the future as well. It was nice to have a break from tomato-based sauces.

A very delicate sauce with a hint of sweetness.  I added some extra Parmigiano Reggiano to the sauce itself to help thicken it. The parsley adds a fresh flavor that we enjoyed. Thank you for the recipe.
