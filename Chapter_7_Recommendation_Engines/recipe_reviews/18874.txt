Having owned an Italian restaurant/Pizzeria at one time, I can tell you: NO ITALIAN WOULD BE CAUGHT DEAD USING CHEDDAR CHEESE....AND NEVER, NEVER IN CALZONE.  ONLY PURE RICOTTA CHEESE!  Use one and one half cups of ricotta mixed with dash of pepper, salt, Italian sausage (or pepperoni is acceptable), one egg and dash of parsley and grated parmesan cheese.  For those of you who don't want to be bothered making dough from scratch....buy the frozen bread dough.  Just as good!

This was a good recipe. It does need a few adjustments.  The recipe should state that the yeast should proof first.  I dissolved the sugar in the water with the yeast and let it sit for ten minutes.  I didn't use the same toppings, I used ground ham, spinach, a little mozarella, mushrooms and of course ricotta, which makes a "real Italian Calzone, and for a little extra yum, a dash or two of Italian dressing, but the dough was great for calzone.  Very chewy and beautiful coloring.  I made 4 calzones out of this but cut them in half, so next time I will make 8 small ones.  Also it took only 20 minutes when I used my pizza stone, so time should be adjusted for the size of individual servings.

I tried halving the recipe, as so many thought these were quite large, and made mini calzones for appitizers. I also added some green pepper and olives. Delish! My only change would be to prick the tops with a fork before baking, as they all exploded a bit!!Thanks for the recipe!!

I absolutely love these, I make 'em every week. Instead of egg I brush the dough with olive oil, to me it makes a better crust for a calzone. I also use Mozzerella instead of Chedder.

Outstanding!  Despite having a lot of cooking experience, I had never made pizza dough from scratch or a homemade calzone before tonight.  

What I did differently:
Dough: slightly more yeast (Hodgson Mill All Natural Active Dry Yeast which was a 5/16 oz. pack); divided in four; rolled to 9" cirlcles

Filling: used Italian 4-cheese blend; mixed and chilled cheeses, but not toppings; topped with different approximately 1 1/2 cups combined diced pepperoni, diced ham, canned mushrooms, canned and drained diced tomatoes, diced onions, and diced green peppers.

Hints: use a lightly floured silicone baking mat - this lets you easily fold half the dough over the filling and transfer to baking sheet; use a small roller for small dough formations; spread your cheese down the middle and work toward one side of the round, adding toppings in the same manner; leave at least a half inch margin on side with filling; lightly brush that half's edge with some of the beaten egg to make sealing the edges easy; serve with a dipping sauce (like "Way Easy Pizza Sauce/Bread Stick Dip" also featured on allrecipes.com - see my review for how I doctored that to fit my tastes and better match my alterations to this calzone recipe).

Bottom Line:  This was really easy and worth the time required.  Adapt to your own taste, keeping in mind the total volume of the filling.

Excellent recipe. Very easy if you let your bread machine do the work. I set mine on dough cycle thru 2nd rise. Instead of Cheddar, I use a blend of Mozzarella and Romano, add green onions and black olives. Yummy! Thanks for sharing this great recipe, Jenny. It has become a favorite of my friends and family!

I'll echo other reviewers in esteeming this dough recipe - it cooks to perfection - & that you can fill to your liking.  My filling consisted of 1 cooked/cubed chic breast, oregano, cheddar & mozz cheeses, salt, pepper, garlic powder and I went ahead & put sauce on the INSIDE - sorry!   The recipe made what I consider 4 large, very stuffed calzones.   I guess I overstuffed but they turned out delicious and didn't overflow.  Thanks for this idea!

To quote my husband, "This is the best calzone I've  ever had!"  I used Italian seasoning instead of the basil and cheddar and mozzarella instead of just chedder.  I was very pleased to find this recipe because it's so hard to find a true Italian Calzone in my area.  THANKS SO MUCH FOR SHARING!

These turned out great!  I used honey in place of sugar and didn't need all the flour that was called for.  I pricked the tops of the calzones with a fork before baking and brushed olive oil on top instead of eggs.  I also made 4 medium calzones instead of 2 large ones and I baked them on a pizza stone.  They turned out nice and cripsy!  I will for sure make these again.

This was a very good recipe.  This was the first time I'd ever made any sort of dough from scratch, and it turned out great.

Instead of making 2 huge calzones, I cut the dough into smaller pieces and made 8 individual ones.  I also modified the contents and I put sauce on the inside.  It was excellent.

"Wow!!!! Great!" Those were the reactions I got from my family in between bites. These were delicious, really.  To save time and effort, I used the dough hook on my mixer to knead the dough. This is a great (& fast) way to avoid having to add extra flour (as many mentioned having to do). I didn't add any extra flour and only lightly floured the surface I rolled it out on. For any yeast dough, it is better to avoid adding lots more flour, b/c this can produce a dry dough. For perfect circles, use a bowl to cut out the shape you want. I took the advice of another reviewer and brushed my calzones with olive oil in place of egg. I made 6 calzones- 4 smaller & 2 medium/large ones. I think they cook better when they are smaller and they only needed around 15 minutes. I thin those who said theirs came out hard, overcooked them. Even my larger ones didn't need more than 15 minutes. I also took the advice of many readers & packed them full with stuffing, so mine were not at all flat as in the picture, but rather looked more like large ravioli. For a vegetarian/kosher version, mix about 1 cup of ricotta w/ 1 cup of mozzerela and some chopped cooked broccoli. Thank you for this wonderful recipe & goodbye Sbarro's...

These were great! Sooo easy and extremely yummy! I use many different fillings when making them; whatever I have in my fridge at the time. I never leave out the ricotta though. And sometimes I substitute mozzarella cheese for the cheddar. My dough and filling makes 4 large calzones.

I am italian , I live in Italy and I am a cook. The real calzone is just mozzarella tomato and fresh basil. Thist one is a type of calzone made close to Naples. Not cheddar at all.. No one in Italy uses or know the cheddar.just mozzarella ricotta salame and egg....

If you want cheddar in your calzone, put it in there - cheddar is just a suggestion! Just a quick tip: Heat your oven to 200 degrees while you're preparing the dough then shut the oven off. Cover your prepared dough with a damp towel and place it in the oven on/in a bake-safe container for the time directed.

I make these often using frozen pizza dough, substituting the proper cheeses (ricotta and mozzarella cheese, maybe some fontina and parmesan, but never cheddar) sometimes substituting prosciutto for the mushrooms or pepperoni.  Delicioso!

VERY good! While I consider myself fierce competition in the kitchen, I lack confidence when it comes to baking (pretty much anything to do with yeast!). To my surprise, this was MUCH easier to prepare than I thought it would be!!! My only (minor) hiccup was with my dough (mine was pretty sticky and in need of additional flour). NOTE: If you own a bread machine, allow it to do most of the work for you. Select your machine's dough / pizza dough cycle, medium loaf size. When it's ready, deflate your dough and continue on! HANDY TIPS: Mrsdi is correct. REAL calzones DO NOT contain cheddar cheese! Keeping that in mind, I followed her lead closely but also made some personal changes to suit my / our tastes. Instead of cheddar, I subbed shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese. I also decreased the pepperoni by HALF and added 1/4 c. of browned (mild) Italian sausage instead. I then added 1/4 t red pepper flakes, 1/2 t garlic powder, 3/4 t salt, a dash of pepper / parsley, a couple T of grated Parmesan cheese and an egg to bind everything together. I filled my calzones generously, leaving a half inch margin that I "sealed" with beaten egg (this helps the calzone "stick" together). I brushed my calzones with egg (no EVOO for me) and proceeded as directed. FANTASTIC! My hubs HATES ricotta and even he enjoyed these. :) If I can win over my picky husband, I know I did good lol! Jarred pizza sauce worked great for dunking. Thanks SO much for sharing your recipe, Jenny! :-)

A few changes as per others' suggestions.  I used mozzerella and ricotta, omitted the cheddar.  Also, I used sliced rather than diced pepperoni, and I sealed the calzones with some of the egg, which turned out perfectly.  The dough was to die for and the whole thing really hit the spot, great recipe!

These were awesome!  Instead of making into two large calzones, I made it into five smaller ones (although the "smaller" ones would be a good adult size portion).  The kids had their friends over, so I cut them in half and each kid had only a half a calzone.  I served them with exquisite pizza sauce from this site, which I had in the freezer from the last time we made homemade pizzas.  I also sprinkled some parmesan cheese on top of the egg wash. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  I will definately be making these again.

OH MY GOODNESS! Are these the BEST or what! I've made them 3 times now and I have not once been disappointed. The recipe should probably just give a rough amount of filling that you can choose yourself because I think most people choose their own filling anyway. I used fresh mushrooms, pepperoni, pineapple, and basil. On 2 of the occasions I made these, I didn't have ricotta around so I used a small container of cottage cheese mixed with some honey (to help make up for that loss of sweetness in the ricotta) and half an egg. By doing that I had the other half to spread over the over outside of the calzone before baking. Thanks for sharing!

As mrsdi said no Italian would use cheddar cheese in a recipe instead of Mozzarella. My parents too had a pizzeria, of course they were italian, and ricotta was utmost in our calzones. Fresh, natural and whole only. It was great as was this recipe.

These are so good....though I did make a few changes.  I made the dough in the bread machine then divided it into thirds.  I substituted shredded Mozzarella for the Cheddar and omitted the mushrooms.  Oh, and I baked them on a preheated pizza stone.  I served them with Exquisite Pizza Sauce for dipping.  Our younger son told me I should open a restaurant because his calzone was the best he's ever had.

I live in Italy and found this recipe to be more American than Italian BUT my very American kids loved it. There is no yellow cheese here so I used Asiago and Ricotta as well as salamino instead of pepperoni. Great recipe for kid sleep overs.

This got a 5 star rating from the hubby (he'd give more stars if he could).  I read many of the other reviews for suggestions; here is what I did.  Made the dough as instructed, replacing 1 cup of the all-purpose flour with whole wheat instead--did it in the breadmaker on the dough cycle.  I refrigerated the dough for 4 hours before using, and it still worked great (brought up to room temp for an hour).  I rolled the dough out into 4 smaller calzones--which were still huge.  I packed the little suckers right full of mushrooms, onions, ground beef, ricotta, mozzarella, diced tomatoes, feta, ham and pancetta--folded over the dough, pushed the edges together to make a seam, cut a slit into the top of each calzone and pushed the air out gently by pushing on the tops of the calzones before baking.  Brushed egg white onto the dough - made the dough crispy and gave it a nice golden colour.  Baked as directed.  These were fantastic and I will definitely make them again!

Made this tonight - and even my picky 4 1/2 yr old ate his!  The dough was super easy to make, and tasted great.  I think I may add some italian seasoning to it next time..and there will be a next time!  I used mozz in place of the cheddar & served w/ the easy pizza sauce III recipe from this site, w/ cindy18lou's mods. Super good - the only problem I can see is that there aren't any leftovers for tomorrow!  UPDATE: Doubled the recipe w/ no trouble.  I've found that the thinner you roll the dough, the better  - almost to the point where it is about to tear.

I divided into 8 pieces, still quite large, will try 12 or 16 next time to make it more of a snack size.  I used spinach, ricotta cheese, pepperoni, garlic, Italian seasoning and mozzarella cheese for my filling.  Baked for 25 minutes at 350 degrees. Really nice!

This is an excellent recipe... with a few changes. You should replace the cheddar with buffalo mozzarella, and use fresh basil  (torn by hand). Cook on a pizza stone, if you have one, as this will help to crisp the crust. And, if you have a well-calibrated oven, crank up the temperature by 5 degrees. Don't forget to preheat your oven at least 20 minutes before baking. Oh, one more thing, brush the tops of the calzones with olive oil.
And don't forget to have your favorite tomato sauce on the side... It's a great little slice of Italy.

Delicious, great recipe! After brushing the top with the egg, I sprinkle on a little garlic salt for a little extra!

Really good!  I would definitely add more than 1 1/2 cups of the ricotta, but a full 15oz container was a bit too much for my taste.  In step (1), use a medium mixing bowl, not the small bowl the recipe recommends because it will have to accomodate 2 1/2 cups of flour and then some.  When it comes time to fill the calzones, start with the rolled out dough on the cookie sheet because transferring the delicate vessels is difficult.  Very good dough!

This was so so.  The crust was pretty tough, and the fillings run out when you cut into it.  Probably will look for another Calzone recipe.  Sorry

1st try: 4 stars.  I split the dough recipe in half and froze the other half and made two calzones (each being a quarter of the recipe).  They came out too crispy b/c I rolled the dough out too thin and baked them for 30 minutes. 2nd try: 5 stars.  This time the crust wasn't as thin and they were only baked for 20 minutes.  Also, even though this was only half the dough recipe, we still made the full filling recipe.  Perfect!  Absolutely loved it.

I thought these were excellent!!!  I also made some changes though.  To save time, I used Pillsbury Hot Roll Mix (boxed) and followed the pizza crust recipe on the side of the box.  I also used mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar.  Not only did they taste great but with the egg brushed on before baking they looked like they came out of a magazine.

This was my first time making calzones, and also my first time making any kind of yeast bread. These were really good!  I had a bit of trouble with the dough being too sticky, so I added 1/4 c. of flour.  It was still really sticking to my floured hands and working surface.  I decided I'd liberally oil my hands and surface - that made working with the dough MUCH easier.  I like the fact that you can really play around with the fillings.  I used about 2 c. Mozarella instead of the Cheddar, and mixed with the ricotta, basil, and some chopped pepperoni and mushrooms.  Also, instead of making two huge calzones (and they really would have been enormous), I was able to make 7 individual ones.  I took another reviewers suggestion and paired these with the Exquisite Pizza Sauce from this website.  We topped our calzones with the sauce, and ate up!  My only complaint besides the sticky dough was the time involded in preparing these.  I work fulltime and have a 1-1/2 year old and a 3 year old, so I normally don't pick a recipe for dinner that takes more than about an hour from beginning to end.  However, we all really did enjoy these, so I'd probably make them again on a weekend, when things aren't so hectic!!  Thanks for the delicious recipe Jenny!

made these this past week and my family just loved them!  So delicious.  The reason for the 4 star rating is because I did not use the pizza dough recipe listed here, but used my own instead.  You just can't beat it so why change right? So I cannot comment on the pizza dough part.  But for a tip, I did add dry italian spices and garlic powder to my dough as I was making it and the flavor was perfect for the calzones! Just throw them in while the dough is still fairly wet.

Only other changes I made where as some other reviews suggested.  I made 8 individual sized calzones.  My kids do not like mushrooms and I'm not a huge pepperoni fan, so I made half with just the cheeses and pepperoni and the other with  the cheeses, mushrooms and onions!  I too did not use cheddar but used freshly grated parmesan and used the whole container of ricotta.  Half a cup was just not enough for me.  

These also freeze and reheat well so you can make a double batch and freeze the extras!  I will be doing that next time.  Wonderful recipe!  Thanks for submitting

These turned out really good. I tried brushing them with olive oil instead of the egg, but realized I should have done the egg to begin with. The olive oil makes it look dry, the egg on the other hand adds a nice golden color. Also, next time I will use less ricotta and more mozzarella (which I used instead of the cheddar). My husband loved them. Will make again

I am Italian and I have never heard of Cheddar cheese being used in a Calzone.  Mozzarella and ricotta, yes.  I thought I would try this anyway.  Just for me, I repeat, just for me, the Cheddar cheese does not work.  I love cheddar, as a cheese, but it is out of place in a true Calzone.  Sorry.  JMO.  It was far too slimy and greasy. A calzone cheese should be creamy.  JMO.  Perhaps if the portions were altered, it would work better.  But I do not think I will try this recipe again.

This crust was to DIE for!!  I don't know what makes it so yummy but it was perfect!  As for the filling, I was sketchy not using sauce since we are a sauce-loving family, but it was perfect!  I offered warmed pasta sauce as a side.

Wow, I made these for the first time over a year ago--having NEVER used yeast and they turned out so yummy!  My husband is Italian and loves pizza and we both thought these calzones were better than the ones we have eaten in restaurants.  I followed the directions on the yeast package to "proof" the yeast and used ALL of a 15oz. package of Ricotta as suggested by others.  I tried both Cheddar and Mozarella independently and each were really good.  This one is a keeper!

As the dad,I have tried this recipe twice now, and as the regular cook in the kitchen in my home, my two disabled children are requesting this meal on a regular basis. Thank you. You have 5 Yums Up from my home.

I use my own alterations to keep it different each time: Alfredo instead of Pizza/Spaghetti Sauce, Mozzarella instead of Cheddar (preferred), Broccoli, toasted Garlic cloves, Baby Portobella Mushrooms, and Italian Sausage. I have even used ground (Wild Game)Turkey with fresh oregano and basil I grow on my window sill.

Ohh, MY GOODNESS!!  This is a mighty fine recipe and I'll be making it again and again.  I like it better than any pizza I've ever made at home.  I've never made a calzone and didn't know that it had ricotta.  That was my favorite part of this recipe.  I used pizza dough from Publix (BOGO free this week) and used a little more ricotta than called for.  I used Sargento's Pizza Cheese instead of the cheddar.  I did add some salt, pepper and garlic salt to the cheese mixture.  I also layered very thinly sliced mushrooms and a pile of fresh baby spinach on the filling before closing it up.  Oh my, you talk about great flavor and cutting the pepperoni up into tiny pieces really was perfect.  Like I said, I'll be making this again and it's so versatile as long as you use the same cheesy mixture.  The fillings could be of your choosing.. hamburger, ham, sausage, vegetarian.. put some onions, peppers and more inside.  Thank you so much Jenny for posting this fantastic recipe.

It was only my second time making dough (the first dough was a fail, by the way) and it came out perfectly!  I waited for the yeast to bubble with such anticipation... it was a success on my second attempt.  

I split the dough into 4 and the calzones where huge!  I can't imagine making only 2 with all of that dough.  I fill them with 1/2 c ricotta, 1.5 c shredded mozzarella, left over homemade meatballs, chopped up spinach, basil, black pepper and Italian seasoning.  Like others, I painted on oil before placing in the oven instead of the egg.  
My boyfriend rated this a "great" meal, which meals a whole lot coming from him!  I will definitely be making this again and changing up the fillings (or not).

I made the dough in my bread machine...came out great! Very easy to work with. However, the taste of the ricotta was a bit strange to me. I'm used to it in lasagna but not in a calzone. I paired with exquisite pizza sauce.

These were so much easier to make than I anticipated.  The dough came out beautiful and was so easy to work with.  They baked up a golden brown and tasted so good.  I did use cottage cheese (didn't have any ricotta), and after brushing the dough with egg, I sprinkled with garlic salt and parmesan cheese.  Wonderful snack/lunch idea!

Fantastic- this came out perfect. The dough was just the right texture and flavor. The crust was crispy with just the right balance of sweet and savory. I followed the dough instructions to the letter and modified the fillings to suit. Hawaiian style will be my next try (pineapple/ham) and then meatballs...

To make this easier and faster, I used store bought pizza dough. I thought it even tasted better this way!

This recipe was good, not great.  I threw the recipe away.  It was too much work for two little reward.  I prefer calzones very cheesy.  The bread was good.  I used half whole wheat flour in one recipe and it came out good.  I also made one batch with my own ingredients--broc., red peppers, spinach, and mushrooms.  It was good, but again not cheesy and juicy enough for me.

Definitely must add your personal favorite ingredients for stuffing.  Also, make four smaller individual calzones instead of two HUGE ones!!  I will be making this again...

This recipe was so delicious! While I was preparing it, I kept thinking, this had better be worth it (it does take a little time/work)! And believe me, it was! I will be making this again very soon, so good!!!

Very easy to make and very tasty.  The dough took very little time and don't forget to proof the yeast first in the warm water 110 degrees and the sugar.  I added a little homemade pesto to the filling as well.

Oh my Calhonzy ! Cheddar cheese ? Not unless I want to get whacked at my home. Other wise it's a  good recipe and the dough works good. I cut in fourth's roll out the little balls and fill with with good Italian sausage, mozzarella and Ricotta. and follow the rest of the recipe. No pepperoni, however, which in Italian is a "pepper", no such sausage in Italy. But when in America do as the Americans.

I made four of these for my  family and it was pretty good. I did the recipe for the crust as directed, but it did come out a little too hard. I modified the inside (I have a VERY picky family) but doing a layer of pepperoni, sprinkle of basil, thick layer of Mozzarella shredded cheese, another layer of pepperoni, and another sprinkle of basil, then fold. And pizza sauce for dipping. YUM! I think I'd make this again, maybe add some mushrooms, ham, sausage, etc. The only thing that I really didn't like was the overly crunchy crust, so if you like it a little more moist don't leave it in for the full 30 minutes.

I basically only used the dough portion of this recipe and we loved it! I made the dough in the bread machine and that worked out very well. I did a one filled w/ steak, onions, mushrooms, ricotta, provolone and mozzarella, and the other filled w/ a mixture of cooked spinach, onions, garlic and pepperoni, ricotta, provolone and mozzarella. Both were a hit! I brushed them w/ olive oil before baking instead of the egg. I will be using this dough recipe again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Very good! I omitted the cheddar and replaced that with a shredded Italian cheese blend.  (Family preference) and added some dried thyme, oregano, and garlic powder.  This is my first time working with this kind of dough and I didn't realized how big it would roll out to! I will be making this again

This recipe is easy and delish! The dough is perfect for the calzone. I switched out the cheddar for mozzerella cheese with the ricotta. You could fill the dough with anything you want, though. Keep in mind that these get HUGE when they cook so what looks like a small calzone will be mammoth when it's done. This is a great meal for any night but would also impress guests!

The calzone dough was amazing!  (easy to work w/ & a nice consistency)  I threw all the dough ingredients in my bread machine & let it do the work.  I brushed EVOO over them before baking.  (no egg)  I will be making regularly!!!  Next time I will try the filling.  This time I tried the new cooking creme from Phillidelphia Cream Cheese in the Savory Garlic Flavor (recipe on top of pkg)

They were okay - need to roll thinner next time. Also, tried olive oil per another review, but will try egg next time.

This crust was the perfect texture! It seemed just a teensy bit bland... maybe next time I'll skip the egg wash and brush the crusts with butter when they're out of the oven. Since I cook for one, I made eight smaller calzones, and partially baked them before freezing. I can't wait for dinner tomorrow!

This recipe came out fine, actually quite tasty....but only because after I realized the dough was not salvagable-- we ran out and got some Pillsbury pizza crust. Not sure if I did something wrong or what but that dough was fubar.

This was my first ever calzone attempt (I'm a newlywed), and I was SO happy with how easy and cheap this was to make. And the pay off was awesome- totally delicious. I wasn't too big on the basil flavoring that probably gives it its authentic italian taste; I used a pinch of a regular Italian Spice that you can find at any old grocery store. Also, the recipe calls for cheddar and my husband really liked it...but for you picky people out there like me, mozzerella might give you more of a classic pizza flavor. Love this recipe- we just had it 2 nights ago and I'm planning to make it next week already!

I'm giving this five stars, not as a calzone, but as a pizza crust! I searched forever to find the perfect crust and here it is.  It makes up quickly, no proofing of the yeast, and it stretches out nice and soft.  Here are pizza making tips: make the pizza on parchment paper and slide the whole paper and pizza onto the preheated pizza stone, then when cooked, slide the whole thing off onto a cookie sheet. Done.  Also, try tomato paste straight out of the jar instead of sauce.  If your pizza gets too wet, it's gross.  The paste gives a lot of tomato flavor without any wetness.  Give it a try!

I took some of the others' advice and these were a revelation. Let's see I:  -proofed the yeast -pricked the dough (no explosions) -used Italian spice -brushed with olive oil before baking -didn't use cheddar, I mixed fresh parm, ricotta, mozz, pepperoni and threw in an egg to keep it firm  I have a family of 5 including a teenager so I doubled the recipe. I got 10 medium sized calzones, one large one and an extra that I filled with apple pie filling. Next time I won't double!  We used 3 cheese marinara to dip and my family has found something they seem to like even better than pizza. I echo the thoughts that the crust was fantastic. Thanks for posting!

This is a very good recipe, although I did make modifications, as did many others.  First, I made four calzones instead of two.  I also upped the ricotta by a LOT, using 1/2 cup PER CALZONE, for a total of 2 cups in the whole recipes.  I made a couple vegetarian and a couple with pepperoni, and served sauce on the side.  I will make this again and again, I am sure.

Great calzone recipe! Made it several times, each time was delicious! After you add the yeast to the water you have to let it proof (let it get foamy) for 5-10 min otherwise it won't rise properly. I tried olive oil instead of the egg wash before baking and it didn't get hard and shiny like with the egg which wasn't as pretty. I also sprinkled italian seasoning over the egg wash, which looked beautiful. Also, once the calzones were assembled I got distracted and let them sit for a while before putting them in the oven, which caused the crust to rise even more and get very bready! Not as good! You can pretty much any filling in this. I like to add the cheese last so it will melt over the other fillings. Makes 2 GIANT calzones!

This is a fantastic dough recipe just by itself.  However, this does not make enough for 8 servings.  It makes 2 mid sized calzones.  I did again and scaled to 12 servings for 2 large calzone.  Worked beautifully in my bread machine on the dough cycle.  For the filling I substituted seasoned baked chicken, mozzarella and parmesan,and added some pesto to this mixture.  I've also done with pizza sauce but we prefered the pesto or no sauce at all.  The addition of the ricotta to the filling is wonderful!  Will definitely make often.

I had to add a second review because this time I followed the recipe except for the mushrooms, we used onions instead---boy was this good!!!  I will continue to use this recipe and try different fillings, maybe chicken and brocolli next--my husband loved it!-----First review-->


I thought this recipe was very good-however I made a few changes because I did not have everything on hand.  I followed the dough recipe without changes and thought it came out great.  I used some buffalo chicken sausage with pineapple, onions, peppers, mozarella and a spoonful of cottage cheese (you can't even taste it).  I egg washed the top and topped with some garlic salt, garlic powder and pepper...with a bit more shredded mozarella--came out gorgeous!  We also used our favorite tomato sauce to dip the calzone in-my husband loved it!  This recipe is so versatile--have fun with it.
Thanks for sharing Jenny.....

I can't give this review enough stars.  I made small calzones, using a round sandwhich cutter.  I made my own changes (ofcourse), I used 1 lb. hot turkey sausage ~ but still added about 1/4 cup pepperoni, added garlic, used cottage cheese instead of ricotta & increased the cheese by about 1/2 cup.  They were so delicious & we ate all of them in one night.

These were good. I did proof the yeast first.  They could have used more filling.  I used a mix of Mozz with the cheddar and I will use more next time. I also will also put some sauce into them.  (I know that's not a Calzone but that's how we like them.)  thanks for the recipe.  I will make them again.

These are the best! Better than pizzas! I doubled the recipe since I was cooking for a lot of people. I made smaller calzones, but they were still quite large. With a doubled recipe, I made 7 calzones, and my nephews made 2 small pizzas with extra dough. I stuffed them directly on a parchment-lined cookie sheet so I wouldn't have to transfer them. I used mozzarella & parmesan cheese with the ricotta along with Italian sausage, pepperoni, sauteed red onion with green & red bell peppers plus lots of fresh basil. Be sure to stuff them real good cause they grow! Thank you very much for this recipe.

my husband really liked these.  I didn't do pepperoni, added mozz. cheese instead of cheddar, and added spinach and feta to the mixture.  very tasty and versatile.  Used dried basil, as I didn't have fresh.

My boyfriend could not believe that I made the crust for these. It turned out so well! I added extra cheese and used fresh basil. I diced the mushrooms and added diced red pepper as well. I have also used this crust recipe and filled it with ham and cheese and served it with a honey mustard sauce for dipping. So many things you can do with this recipe. Wonderful.

Good!  I used one cup of whole wheat flour in the crust.  I doubled the ricotta and used 1/4 cup red onions instead of mushrooms.  I made 4 calzones instead of 2.  I also brushed the tops with olive oil instead of egg.  Served with Trader Joe's organic marinara sauce for dipping.

These were fantastic...my husband's new favorite meal.

I used 2 cups of shredded mozzarella instead of cheddar, and substituted 1 diced green pepper, and half of a red onion diced instead of the mushrooms.
Because of this it made more filling, and I only used half of it and saved the rest for another meal. Making just 2 calzones does make particularly huge ones--my husband who can eat alot ate his whole one and I made it through half of mine. I made another batch of dough a few days later to finish up the rest of the filling and made 4 instead of 2, and they cooked a little faster. We did dip them in marinara sauce at the table which was great, and I might try adding some diced tomatoes next time, but they were delicious the way they were!
**oh yeah, and I also sprinkled the tops with a little some rosemary and fresh ground pepper before cooking which was a nice touch.

Fabulous!  I used mozerella instead of cheddar.  I didn't have ricotta so I just mashed up some cottage cheese.  There is a lot of basil in it but it works.  Also, the bread is wonderful. I made sure I kneaded it for the 5 minutes and it rose quickly in the window where it was warm. My boyfriend said, "I really, really, really like this".  I'll make this again!

Wow!  I loved this recipe.  I made some changes to make it healthier, though.  I used whole-wheat flour instead of all-purpose and honey instead of white sugar.  I also left out the mushrooms (don't like them) and substituted a package of frozen spinach (thawed) for the ricotta.  The calzones baked up fluffy and delicious.  I would recommend dividing the dough into four pieces instead of two so that you end up with nicer leftovers.  I will definitely make this again!

The bread portion of these turned out great.  This is the first time I've ever used egg to create the golden brown glaze during baking.  They looked gorgeous.  Next time I will probably double the recipe.  I made four smaller calzones instead of the two large called for in the recipe.  Though the smaller calzones were still good, forming larger calzones would emphasize the stuffing more so than the breading, which some might prefer.  Obviously, make sure you like ricotta cheese.  Dipping the calzones in sauce rather than including it in the stuffing was OK, but I prefer the approach of including sauce in the stuffing.  I will find a recipe that uses that approach next time I make calzones.  All in all, these were very good - but not five-star.

Yummy!  I rolled the dough into four 8" circles but could have definitely doubled the filling amount.  I also added sauteed peppers, onions and garlic and 1/2 cup of spaghetti sauce.  I used the cheddar and thought it was delicious, but next time I think I'll use both cheddar and mozza.  Very filling and teenager friendly!

This has to be one of the easiest calzone recipes I've ever tried, and it was delicious!  I substituted spinach and mushrooms sauteed with garlic (be sure to drain it well!) for the pepperoni, etc. and, of course, used mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar, and it was a big hit with a bowl of chix. soup one night for dinner.  I served the second one on Superbowl Sunday with a bunch of other appetizers and it was a big hit then, too!  The dough is a real winner!

The calzone bread was not good at all - it didn't come out soft-ish like restaurant calzones - it was hard and plain and not tasty at all.

Absolutly mouth watering!!  I purchased a small jar of spaghetti sauce for
dipping and entire recipe tasted wonderful.  I do wonder, however, whether 
everyone has noticed that the recipe directions describe making 2 calzones
while the ingredients are actually scaled for 8.  I can only assume that is why 
some people had such extra large calzones!!

This was a great recipe for Calzone Dough.  I love to cook but baking is something a bit scary to me.  This dough was so easy and used things I always have in my house.  The dough almost tripled in size so quickly too.  I stuffed my calzones with Spinach, Chicken and Mushrooms and just amazed my boyfriend!
I will tell everyone about these!!

very yummy!  It's really easy with a Kitchen-Aid mixer to do all the kneading! :)  My husband and 3 year old loved it!  It's gonna end up being a "company dish" that we make when we have couples over for dinner.

t was actually quite dense and a little dry in my opinion.I admit to using a little bit too much flour in the kneading process which could have attributed to the dryness but if the dough wasn't so darn sticky in the first place I wouldn't have had to resort to the flour.Maybe I just stink at dough.

MMMMMM!  I made these with only one substitution-- mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar. These taste so similar to a family restaurant I used to frequent made. They would pour a home made meat sauce all over the top and a mound to Parmesan! Ill try that next time and save 15 bucks!

Reviewing the dough only. It was pretty good.  The family all gave it a thumbs up, kids and grown ups both.  It's enough for a good meal for family of 4 but it is not a huge recipe, which is the impression I got from some other reviews. We made up our own fillings. Everyone pick your own. It was fun for the kids.

Made the dough exactly as written and it turned out perfectly chewy and crusty and crispy...mmmm! For the filling I used sweet peppers (red, yellow, and orange), onions, green onions, diced salami and pepperoni (simply because I had all of it on hand and it needed to be used up). Also threw in some goat cheese along with mozza, jalapeno cheddar and old cheddar. It was delicious! Thank you for sharing.
PS: My stepkids said cucumber salad dressing went really well as a dip on the side with the calzones. I didn't try it, but putting it out there if someone else is adventurous enough!

This was such a great recipe, and very easy and quick to make.  I made the dough in my bread machine and it came out perfect.  I omitted the ricotta cheese because my family does not care for it, and replaced the cheddar cheese with mozzarella.  I also sprinkled some garlic power and parmesan cheese on the top before baking.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This recipe is real real good. I like to sprinkle cheese on it and sing the Lady and the Tramp song whilst eating them.

AWESOME. The dough was so easy to work with and came out crispy on the bottom. (I used olive oil to grease the bottom of my baking sheet). I changed the stuffing, I put Kraft Italian 5 cheese blend, pizza sauce, garlic and basil. Will be making them again, for sure!

Great dough recipe, but I sectioned the dough in 3, instead of 2, and it still made huge calzones. I stuffed them with sauteed onions, ground turkey, rotel, ms dash, minced garlic (all cooked together), then added shredded mozzarello cheese. Delicious!

Wonderful recipe. I changed a little bit and still worked great. I really like using whole wheat whenever possible, so I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cup of white flour. I also used a chicken, broccoli, and mushroom filling. Sure 5 stars. I'll be making this recipe often.

I enjoyed this recipe very much.  I do make this recipe into 6 or 8 small calzones instead.  I also add a little parmesan cheese and garlic salt on top before baking to add a little someting.  I have also used sausage and pepperoni combo  and a ham and cheese inside and it is very tasty!  Great for sending with kids for a school lunch.

Great recipe to use as a spring board to add ingredients for anyones taste.  I used a pound of Italian ground sausage, browned and a cup of chopped spinach in ours.   I did not use the cheddar or pepperoni.  
After reading all the suggestions, I divided my dough into 4's and made individual servings and I served it with marina sauce for dipping.

very good. I made the dough rise twice and then filled it with a dry turkish sausage, ricotta, mix of cheddar, provolone, mozz. and parm cheese. I mixed a little water with the egg and beat that to brush on top and it came out very good. My hubby, brother and father in law loved it! This is very versatile and you can pretty much make any mixture to put in it...i think i will try chicken and spinach next! I also used a yeast for pizza dough from fleishman's yeasts. Thank you!!!!

These have a lot of promise, though I think that they require a lot more attempts before I make really great ones. I made my first ones mostly with ricotta, but I think it would be better with 1/2 ricotta, 1/2 mozz and maybe only a full cup in total. More pepporoni and mushrooms! And for some reason it's hard to make enough with given recipe, so I scaled it to 10.

I only used the dough recipe, didn't use the filling, I used this for the BBQ Chicken Calzone on here. This was super easy to do I've only ever made dough a few times and it hasn't turned out, but this did! Even whe was mucking around with the yeast! I only gave it 4 stars however because it really needs extra seasoning or something, probably garlic!!!!

Fantastic!! This is very good dough to make a calzone. If you prefer more filling than dough, make sure to roll out your dough as thin as possible because it will rise some in the oven and come out thicker than it went in. Thanks for the recipe Jenny!

This recipe is a winner-winner-winner! Definitely the best calzone I've ever had, and the family said the same.  I didn't have ricotta cheese, and people had advised against cheddar, so I used cottage cheese, Parmesan, and mozzarella.   Also, I added a clove of garlic, oregano, black olives, and Italian seasoning to the filling. I split the dough into 8 mini-calzones as others had suggested, and that worked GREAT.  Highly recommended!!!! I will definitely make this over and over.

I was very disappointed in this calzone. The crust was a bit tough and flavorless- my husband said it tasted similar to a plain cracker. I agree. The filling was the worst for me. I did not like the taste or the thick texture of the ricotta. I ended up taking most of the filling out of mine and eating it with the sauce on the side. If it weren't for the sauce it would have been awful. I also couldn't taste the pepperoni at all due to the strong "flavor" of the ricotta. Ugh :/

This is a great recipe!  I knew enough to let the yeast activate a bit. I didn't have pepperoni so I used sausage instead.  Added black olives along with the mushrooms and used fresh basil instead of dried. Lots of filling so I loaded them up with about a cup of the mix.  They turned out not only tasty, but very pretty too! I ended up with about 8 personal size calzones (about the size of a half of a salad plate) The crust was just right.

I came across this recipe right after Thanksgiving and, of course, had lots of leftovers!  I used cut-up turkey, stuffing, and shredded cheddar for the filling and turkey gravy to dip them in.  Turned out pretty good!  The crust recipe was very easy and tasted great!

super good!  i halved the dough recipe and it STILL made a ton!  way too much for just me and my husband.  i also adjusted the filling by adding mozzarella cheese to.  i even used low fat/fat free cheese and it was still super good!  will definitely make this again!

This is and excellent recipe!  In fact, I'm throwing out my old recipe for pizza dough and using this on from now on.  The dough was simple to make and very easy to work with.  I spread a little olive oil and fresh minced garlic over the crust(after rolling it out), then filled the calzones with, ricotta, mozzerella cheese, pepperoni, banana peppers, and black olives.

These were excellent. We used Pesto in the dough for a really great taste. Covered with sauce and was it good :)

I'm originally from NJ and have never had a real Italian calzone with an American invented cheese, being the cheddar.  That being said I substituted the cheddar cheese for 8 oz low moisture mozzarella cheese and 8 oz of Italian Blend.  I also added some oregano in addition to the basil.  For the filling I just used sweet Italian sausage.  Instead of pressing the seam shut with a fork roll the ends after you close the so that is kind of looks like a pizza crust, this pretty much takes away the possibility of the calzone leaking from missing an area with the fork.  All in all it is a good recipe, just needed some tweaking.

This was great!!! absolutely delicious!!! I had trouble getting the dough to rise so after the 40 minutes I popped the bowl with the dough in an oven heated to 200 degrees for about another 30-40 minutes with the door opened slightly. it then doubled in size. I brushed with olive oil too. but all and all this a fantastic recipe. pretty easy too!

Not a favorite with my family or a friend we invited over to taste test the recipe.  It looked good on the plate, but it didn't do much for the palate.  The crust was too thin and crispy.  The filling was unexciting and flimsy.  It just didn't have good texture or flavor for our preference in a calzone.  We go for something more hearty and flavorful.

Yummy!!!! My whole family loved these, I will make them again!
I used ready made pizza dough to safe time, added some extra cheese (I used gouda) and more ricotta, and put olive oil on top, instead of egg like to last reviewer said.
Wonderful!!!

This was a very good calzone, but I don't understand the cheddar cheese.  I did change it to mozzerella.  I also used basil leaves instead of dried.  Next time, though, I will use less of the ricotta and more of the mozz.  We like it ooey gooey cheesy!

These were so good!  We have looked all over for a recipe like this.  Both my husband and myself dislike the soggy versions that we seem to always get in restaurants.  This was easy to make and better than eating out.  I made the dough in my bread machine on the dough cycle and it turned out perfectly.

Wonderful recipe!  This was my first time making calzones and they turned out fabulous!  I used fresh mushrooms, ricotta and cheddar cheese for the filling.  The basil leaves added the perfect touch.  I folded one of the calzones (used the fork to press together the edges), poked it with a fork a few times and that one burst.  The other one I folded the ends and sides up to the center and that worked beautifully.  I liked the olive oil brush idea instead of the egg brush.  These tasted amazing.  I served them with pizza sauce and added a few mushrooms to the sauce.  I may add sausage next time.  The possibilities are endless.  Thanks so much for sharing!  30 minutes was perfect for the amount of time to bake-delicious!!!

Wow! I loved these. I did make a few adjustments. I doubled the yeast/dough mixture. I also used garlic olive oil which gave the dough a nice garlic flavor. I also mixed mozarella, parmesan, and cheddar into the ricotta blend. I used pepperoni in some and italian sausage in others. I also added some fresh mushrooms, onions and black olives in some (the kids don't like them). I also added a little sphagetti sauce to each one. When I rolled out the dough I decided to make them all a little thicker based on what my family likes.This gave them a wonderful thick crust. I made individual ones instead of two big ones. This way the family could have what they wanted in each of theirs. Don't forget to brush these with the egg...it makes them perfect. I also sprinkled a little bit of garlic powder on them before baking! These were a huge hit in my family. They were gone in a heart beat. I made a second batch today and I am freezing them so the family can have them whenever they want! Thank you for a no fail easy recipe! Awesome!

This recipe will make 4 large calzones.  I followed the recipe and ended up with 2 that were larger than dinner plates and there was too much crust for the amount of filling.  Next time I will divide the dough into 4 parts and add 1 tsp of garlic powder to the dough as it was just a smidge bland.

The BEST calzone!  We loved this!  I was kind of nervous about using cheddar cheese instead of Mozzarella.  We used Cheddar anyway and the combination was absolutely delicious.  We used just the Hunts origional spaghetti sauce and a few cloves of garlic for the dipping sauce and it was perfect. MMmmmmm

Very good Italian meal. The dough made for a good crust, but I played around with the filling. I used 1/2 LB each sweet/spicy italian sausage, green and red peppers, mushrooms, mozzarella, romano, and parmesan cheeses. I also used 15 oz of ricotta which made extra filling that I will use for stuffed shells to make and freeze for another meal. Will definitely be making this again!

I combined this recipe with the Garlic Parmesan Chicken recipe and it was outstanding. I cooked the garlic chicken while the dough was rising then used the chicken parm as the filling.

Very good calzones. I made 4 instead of 2, and they were big enough to cover a whole plate (see pic). I used italian seasoning instead of basil and mozarella instead of cheddar. Next time i will reduce the amount of ricotta cheese cause i'm not a huge ricotta fan. I served these with marinara sauce.

Ok, this was my first time making dough and it was fairly easy and VERY tasty.  I did "proof" my yeast, as several reviewers recommended. I also modified the filling slightly by adding sauteed mushrooms and spinach, more pepperoni than called for and some garlic, as well as fresh basil. I made 4 medium sized calzones,but I think that the next time I make this I will make 6 smaller ones. I baked mine on my pizza stone and it took 30 minutes for them to brown. While mine, didnt look pretty (I think that will get better with time and practice) they definitely tasted good. I made "exquisite pizza sauce" as an accompaniment.

This was delicious. Even with regular ole' spaghetti sauce. It is labor intensive but worth it. My first time making bread from scratch with yeast and all and it was not nearly as scary as I thought. I would make it into 4 instead of 2. DELICIOUS!

These were quite tasty and very easy.  The only thing I did differently was to add sausage to the filling.  Warning-these things are huge!!  I will probably make 4 instead of 2 next time.  There is no way I could finish one!

This recipe was pretty good. I followed the recipe exactly as it says. I thought the dough came out OK. I will try a store bought pizza dough next time. The filling was good although, we could have used a bit more. My family liked it. Overall, I think this is good. I don't think I am saving it in my personal collection.

Absolutely Perfect! FANTASTIC Recipe. The dough is soo easy! I was so proud of myself! Just like the restaurants! I used more of the same ingredients in the recipe and it filled them well. I used a whole container of ricotta, about a cup of pepperoni and a little extra mushrooms. I would change the types of filling in this one, since mushrooms and pepp. don't really mix. I don't recommend the cheddar and riccotta, but an interesting taste! TRY IT! Makes the "boys" happy!

I made these for my husband and he thought they were great.  I only made one and still had leftovers (they're huge!).  I think I'll take the advice of one person and make smaller ones next time, and also use a little more ricotta.  They needed a little more filling.  Could use garlic, too.  But all in all, this is a super recipe.  Thanks!

These were great! I used chicken instead of pepperoni, because I think it tastes better and is more healthy. There wasn't enough flour in this recipe though, I had just the amount that it called for and ended up having to use a heap of cornmeal. However, I think this was a good thing, the dough turned out nice and crusty. Thanks for the recipe!

These were great - I stuffed them with what I had on hand: ricotta, fresh mozz, roasted red peppers, and pepperoni.  The dough was very easy to work with - I actually halfed the recipe and made two very nicely sized calzones.

Excellent! I ended up using Mozzerella cheese instead of cheddar and then used canadian bacon and pineapple and ricotta cheese. I think you could use any kind of toppings with this recipe. I will make this again forsure!

Thanks for the recipe.  My family and friends loved them.  I made the calzones smaller in size for a party.  Bake perfectly.  I am definitely making the calzones again and again.

These were truly terrific!  I had never made any sort of dough before, but other than adding some extra flour (it was far FAR too sticky with just what the recipe called for) it turned out wonderful.

In addition to the cheese the recipe calls for, I added some parmesan and some extra mozzerella cheese and it had a very good cheesy flavor combo.

The husband doesn't like hardly any "toppings" so I left his calzone with just pepperoni and mushrooms.  After making both calzones as the directions indicated, I sprinkled some chopped green pepper, chopped onion, and sliced black olives on top of my cheesy filling before rolling.  I'm glad I sprinkled it on top because it sunk into the cheese as it baked and I had veggies all throughout (I think if I'd mixed it into the cheese mixture, the veggies would've sunk to the bottom).

The calzones were excellent, and there was enough for dinner one night, and then lunch the next day at work.  I wouldn't scale the recipe back at all unless making it for one person or not wanting any leftovers.  (The leftovers did make an excellent lunch for hubby and I!)

THESE WERE DELICIOUS!!! I can't express how wonderful these were in this review, but it's only been a week and a half and we've had them twice...And we're thinking about having them again soon!  I used Sausage, Pepperoni, Onions, Peppers, and Mushrooms, along with a little bit of cheddar and Mozzarella, and the Ricotta - THEY WERE SOOO YUMMY!!!

These calzones were so good. I doubled the recipe so i could freeze half of them. I just cook the ones i was going to freeze for half the time, and when I reheated them, they were as good as before. Thanks Jenny

These were very fun to make. It was my first time ever making dough. I used pizza blend cheese instead of just cheddar. Next time I will definitly double the filling there was not nearly enough. I will make these again with that change!

This was a good calzone.  The dough part was definitely faster than my bread machine, which was a plus.  Next time, I wouldn't use so much basil.  It kind of overpowers everything else.  We also like lots of toppings on our pizza, extra cheese, etc. and I will definitely use more toppings.

The crust for these calzones is absolutely perfect, however, we are vegetarians so I modified the filling.  I used red onion, artichoke, green olives, and fresh spinach.  I used a whole container of ricotta, 2 oz of feta, about half a cup of mozzarella and cheddar.  I came out fabulous!  Don't modify the crust, but definitely play with the filling!

very good recipe, but next time would make many little calzones instead of two big ones.  They would be easier to eat that way I think.

This recipe was not that good. I am not sure if they were suppose to be hard, but I cooked them for 10 minutes less than the recipe called for and they were as hard as a rock. Also, they were very dry (even after adding some sauce). It would be a good idea for our "new" cooks out there, to remind them to proof the yeast before adding to the flour.

This is a review for the dough alone, as I only use ricotta and mozzarella in mine (with onions, peppers, etc), but you do you. This is the best calzone dough I've found. I've made it dozens of times now and it's always a hit. Ignore the reviews complaining about the cheddar or anything else, those types are always "fun" (guess what guy, I put sugar in my *sauce* sometimes too!).

I made this with my high school cooking class and the students liked it. I had to turn down the hot air convection oven to 350. They got brown quickly. We also want to try different cheeses and filling next time. Also, we let the yeast and water and sugar foam for 10 minutes. I'm not sure about the egg wash. It tasted a bit like scrambled eggs. Next time I'll try olive oil or garlic butter.

I tweaked it by switching out cheddar for mozzarella cheese. My kids like the sauce inside but it does make it softer inside and a little mushy. Next time I will stuff it with cheese and veggies  (or meat for my non-vegetarian friends) and then dip in sauce. I like the idea of brushing with olive oil and then  sprinkle it with Parmesan cheese to bake.

I have to agree wtih those who said no to cheddar.  It just made the filling oily and separated.  I'll find a different recipe.

This recipe is a family favorite.  Lots of teenage boys at our house so I usually double the recipe and make 6 good sized calzones.  A doubled recipe of dough works well in my bread maker on the dough setting. If the boys aren't able to eat the entire calzone, they love taking what is left over for lunch the next day.  2 cups of mozzarella (for a single batch) and more toppings choices are the standard here as well as italian seasoning instead of the dried basil, with everyone adding in what ever ingredients they prefer. We make veggie versions as well as the meat eater favorites. Don't forget your favorite sauce!

I followed the recipe exactly, other than cutting 2 slits in each calzone with a serrated knife in order to release steam. It was good, especially with "Exquisite Pizza Sauce from this site, but 1/2 cup of each filling was barely enough to detect when eating. I recommend using a cup of each filling, even if it means you have to omit one in order to make it fit. The dough was a little "bready" for my husband's taste, but I probably let it rise too much since it wasn't supposed to be completely doubled. My son and I liked it that way, though!

Ok, I admit it. I totally cheated. I used frozen premade pizza dough. But in my defense, how many people have time to make dough from scratch for a weeknight dinner? If I did that, we'd be eating after bedtime.  That all being said, these were GREAT.

Not bad, although I mostly just followed the dough recipe. The dough came out of my bread-maker extremely sticky; I use olive oil on my hands and counter-top surface and pressed the dough into a rough circle with my hands. For the filling I used only ricotta cheese, seasoned with salt+pepper+dried basil, then sprinkled on chopped mushrooms and peppers and laid on slices of pepperoni. The bread did cook up beautifully, browning nicely under the egg wash, and with great texture. The filling wasn't impressive, nor was it enough for this much bread, so that needs work!

This was a fun recipe. Added some parmesan to the dough and split it into 6 mini calzones. The filling was good too, substituted ground Italian sausage for pepperoni. The kids had a blast making these and we cooked them on the grill.

This dough is amazing.. soft and light.. I will never have to shop for calzones again!  Impossible to find any good ones I wanted to try to make them at home and this recipe delivered!  I made as directed but I think I will mix the cheeses & spice together and put it in and then layer the toppings like I would a pizza.  I also used Italian seasoning instead of basil as I didn't have any.  We wanted a few smaller ones so we made this into 4.. worked great!  Thanks for sharing.. will be using this for years to come!

I used this recipe as a guideline.  I purchased ready made dough from Trader Joe's.  Stuffing: Provolone, mozzarella cheeses and sour creme, mixed with cooked mushrooms, onion, garlic and ground Italian sausage.  Very good.

Rating only the bread mixture as I completely changed the inside to our individual taste so each one was very different. Very easy to make. Only thing I would change is to turn it into 4 calzones instead of just 2. Trying to move them to the pan with them being as big as they were was a complete nightmare. Will be making again.

I have tried a similar recipe and I like to use mozzarella cheese instead of Cheddar Cheese because it tastes better and it isn't so greasy.

I love the recipe. It depends on who is eating(husband, younger son, grandsons) on how big I make them. My son is not a fan of ricotta so I started experimenting with different fillings.  Everything from ham and cheese to pizza filling. I generally double or triple the dough and instead of 2 large calzones I make a bunch of smaller ones. I take the extras and after cooking them I allow them to cool, wrap in waxed paper and place them in a gallon size freezer baggie. They are wonderful for a quick lunch or if chaos makes supper a hassle, I can heat up a bunch for dinner.  Just popped in the microwave in the waxed paper or put in a preheated oven until nice and hot. This dough has so much potential for different types of sandwiches, you can add practically anything for a great lunch or dinner. I'll try chicken and vegetables with a light sauce next time.

I did not make the dough. Instead, I purchased fresh ready made from my local grocery store. Also, I used mozzarella cheese instead of the cheddar since so many seemed to think it was the wrong cheese for calzones. The result was delicious.

The recipe is not bad, first time making calzone. I gave it four stars because I think the recipe needs to be tweaked a little. I would not roll the dough thin, also if you have a baking stone or a vented pizza baking pan I would use that. I would try the recipe one more time.

I have made the calzone once and it was tasty. I used turkey pepperoni, mushroom, bell pepper, ricotta and parm cheese. It was yummy. 

I have used the dough twice to make a breakfast calzone with egg, cheese and sausage. Amazing. The dough is very versatile.

I loved this recipe...tried it for the first time tonight and my family loved it, even kids, which I thought would be picky(they do not like ricotta). YAY!!! They liked ricotta!!!I used pizza cheese & mozerella instead of cheddar, fresh basil instead of dried, & I was in a rush so used frozen bread dough(had that thawing while I was out running erands.)  I put pepperoni, portabella mushrooms and onion in mine. So wonderful, thank you!

Loved this recipe, but am giving it 4 stars because I changed it a bit.  Didn't have the time to do homemade dough, so I bought frozen bread dough as suggested and it worked great.  I also took the advise to mix the ricotta with egg, parmesan cheese, parsley, and pepper.  I used pepperoni, italian sausage, and mushrooms and everyone loved it.  I have a big family and it's rare that everyone agrees.  This is a keeper!!

AWESOME dough! Filling can obviously vary as much as you want. I now have another alternative to sandwiches to send in my kids lunches... will definitely use these every week or two to give them a break from sandwiches... after making them for supper the night before, so that I can have a few!

This was excellent. I was looking for a recipe for the calzone crust and this one turned out wonderfully.  It was a great texture, nice and thin instead of bready, and browned nicely when baked.  I didn't follow the recipe exactly for the filling, so will just stick to a simple review of the crust.

I thought these turned out great! I really liked the dough. I just gave it a 4 because I made a few changes based on other reviews. I did add a little sauce to the inside, and used mozzarella instead. I also brushed it with olive oil and sprinkled with garlic salt. Will make the dough again.

I cut this recipe in half and it made 2 medium sized calzones...enough to feed 2 people.  For half recipe I added 1/4 cup pizza sauce, 1/4 cup canned mushrooms, 1/4 cup bk olives & used mozzerella instead of cheddar.  I think this would be awesome with sausage.  It was done baking at 20 mins.

I am really only reviewing the dough, as I went a less "traditional" route with the filling. The dough was absolutely perfect! I kept everything exactly as written and it was easy to work with and baked up wonderful. For fillings, I did regular pizza sauce, a mozzarella/cheddar blend, sliced olives, pepperoni, ground beef, and mushrooms. These were a HUGE hit with my kids, who really enjoyed putting in their own toppings in their "pizza pockets." I'll definitely be making these again and again!

Made this twice in two weeks.  First of all, each time i made these, I divided the dough into four smaller calzones.  Very easy and you can use so many fillings!  I did one with just pepperoni (served with spaghetti sauce for dipping) and one with buffalo chicken(added 1/2 c chicken and 1/2 c hot sauce) and one with meatballs(used 1/2 c quartered meatballs and 1/2 c spaghetti sauce with some additional for dipping)!!!  I did add sauce obviously to the buffalo chicken and meatball calzones, but they were good and I would do it again.  I also used mozzarella cheese for all three.  So good!!  Can't wait to make these again.

I made smaller sized calzones to serve as appetizers and it was a huge hit! Everyone loved the way the dough crisped on the out outside and soft and moist inside. I substituted the cheddar with mozzarella and added a link of hot italian sausage (cooked and crumbled). This recipe is a definite keeper.

nice change. good flavor.i mae 4 of them i wish i would have added more stuffing. it doesnt look like they will even close with all that stuffing but when you cook them it doesnt look like nearly enough. i used mozzerela instead of cheddar of course. i didnt use mushrooms but next time i think ill make it with sausage. i always have a hard time with any dough i make coming out to crunchy, i dont know what im doing wrong there!

WOW! Can't say enough about this dough! I love making pizza's at home and have always bought the fresh dough from our local bakery. I end of fighting with it most of the time, so I decided to try this one. I accidently bought the rapid rise yeast and panicked for a moment since the last time I used yeast was in home economics in 7th grade! Anyways, just added the yeast to the dry ingredients. I used the hook attachment on my mixer and it turned out perfect. I only needed 2 cups of flour. I still let it rise for about 30-40 minutes, but only because I wasn't ready to make them yet. The dough was so easy to work with! I stuck the the recipe except for swapping out an Italian blend cheese for the chedder and I doubled the mushrooms (we love mushrooms!) and sauteed them in garlic and olive oil. It was awesome! They turned out beautiful and enormous! One of my calzones ended up busting at the seams, I will try the egg wash next time to seal the edges. I only had to cook them for about 20 minutes and they were perfect. I will not be fighting with store dough anymore!!!

My family really loved these yummy calzones. The only reason I left 4 stars is because I modified the recipe by subbing mozarella for the cheddar. I would definitely make these again. Fun for cooking night with the kids!

Overall good recipe, but no self respecting Italian would use Cheddar cheese! Ricotta should be doubled and Mozzarella and/or even Provolone should be used instead of Cheddar. Also, have fun with substitutes/additions to the pepperoni and mushrooms.

I bought the ready mix dough and I disregarded the cheddar for Mozzarella. They turned out beautiful and tasted awesome.

This recipe does not need any adjustments as far as the dough is concerned.  Dough made exactly as the directions say, is quick and easy!  It's a pretty good dough.  It made 1 large one, 2 medium ones, and 1 small calzones.  If you want to take the time and make real good dough, do so with another recipe but this is meant to be a quick and easy one! Now, cheddar cheese in a calzone?  Never.  I used a 15oz container of ricotta and sliced a large fresh mozzarella ball.  I layered the ricotta down, then the veggies/meat items, and the mozzie on top of that.  I omitted the egg, so I brushed the top with garlic butter after it came out of the oven.  They still baked at the same temp for the same time.  Served them with tomato sauce.  It's pretty good!

fantastic!! I did change up the filling a bit... for the kids I did mozzarella cheese, mini pepperonis and pizza sauce. for myself I did mozzarella cheese, tomatoes, black olives and chicken cooked with a bit of garlic. I made the dough according split it up to make four HUGE calzones. everyone walked away full and everyone gave it a two thumbs up. I will definitely be making these again soon! :)

great recipe!  the greatest was the crust which i made as recipe said to, the rest..which is the filling.. the possibilities are endless!  oh and i definitely subbed mozzarella for the cheddar!   i would use cheddar only sparingly if AT ALL.  i also added shredded Parmesan cheese but the rest was as is.  and sooooooooo goood    will make many more times, the hardest part was the crust but it was worth it!!

Wonderful recipe. I never made dough before, and these came out amazing. They looked perfect and tasted just as good as ordering from a pizza shop. I, like many reviewers, tweaked the filling to my preference. I will be making these over and over again!!

I loved these.... I used refrigerated pizza dough.  I also made my favorite toppings: pepperoni, bacon, mushrooms, and ham, and I added ricotta and mozzerella.  I made a mess overstuffing, but they went down great!  What's with the Cheddar in this recipe?  I omitted that of course!  Thanks for sharing!

These were so awesome! The crust was exceptional & the filling can be adapted to any taste. I halved the recipe, which made two good-sized calzones for me & my husband. This was my first time making anything like this, and it was very easy. Definitely a keeper.

I have made calzones before and these are the best I've tried.  I made exactly as is with the exception of adding italian seasoning to the toppings.  You can be versatile with the cheeses and toppings.  Next time I will try sausage, sauteed green peppers, onions and black olives.

Oh my, were these ever fantastic! This is one of the best recipes I'm made from this site. They took forever, but worth every second. A couple small changes - I added a little extra ricotta to the filling because I had some left over and I also replaced half the chedder with mozzarella. For the dough, I replaced one cup of the flour with whole wheat.  A lot of people used the dough and made their own filling, but I strongly suggest everyone give this filling a try, it is delicious!

Great base recipes. 1st time to make calzones. I made 6 calzones out of this. Next time I will add more salt, maybe some dried herbs or some parmesan cheese to the dough. I took the advice of others: proofed the yeast. No cheddar cheese. I used a little bit of ground mild italian sausage. Next time I make this: jazz up the dough, more ground sausage, less or no ricotta, tons more fresh mozzarella balls.

Awesome! My husband LOVES when I make these. I usually make a double-sized batch of the dough and freeze it to have on hand whenever we want.  Also a fun thing is I divide the basic insides (chicken, cheeses) into individual bowls so we can add what we like separately (mushrooms for me, pesto for him).  They are VERY big, though. I keep making them earlier and earlier so we can eat half of ours for dinner and the other half as a late night snack! I gave the recipe to my mom to cook for her, dad, and my younger brother and told her to just divide in 3, don't make more.  Overall, a wonderful recipe!

A good recipe.  I liked having no sauce inside, it was great to have it on the side for dipping instead.  I had never made homemade pizza crust before, and although I had some problems with it sticking as I kneaded, this recipe is simple enough for anyone to do.  I did change a few things... I proofed the yeast first as someone suggested, I used 1 c ricotta 1 c mozzerella for the cheese, and I added 1/2 c or so Italian sausage to the pepperoni and mushrooms.  I also used Grandma's Garden Italian Seasoning instead of plain basil.  I would make this again.

Very tasty! My boyfriend keeps asking me to make them again. The dough is much more manageable than other pizza dough recipes I've made.

I don't think the dough turned out quite right for this recipe.  It was probably my inexperience but I will try again.  Also, I would say increase the amount of dough that you make.  I had a hard time closing the calzones up with the amount of dough to filling ratio with the given recipe.

great! the whole house liked them! I only wish I would have made more! I did add different ingredients inside. I used pepperoni, green peppers, fresh mushrooms, tomatos, mozz cheese and colby/jack cheese. they browned perfectly, and the kids really liked dipping them into sauce.

I've been using this recipe for a few years now and the kids love it! When I roll out my dough I cut it into 8 squares, fill them and fold the dough over. Each kid has their own calzone. They are so very tasty.

Dough was tasty; although, pretty sticky to work with so I was generous with additional flour.  I used 1 cup moz and 1/2 cup of cheddar and did everything else as written.  I have to say 1 T of dried basil is entirely TOO much!  I cannot believe no one mentioned this in other reviews.  I would cut it back to a teaspoon or less - otherwise it is just too overpowering.

These turned out amazing! I used half cheddar and half mozzarella chesses, and I think a few more mushrooms than called for, but other than that I stuck to the recipe. We dipped them in homemade pizza sauce. The kids loved them.

Turned out great. Differences were adding basil to dough. I let the bread rise for 3 hours. I used fresh mozzarella instead of ricotta and cheddar. For the stuffing I used pepperoni, fresh mushrooms, red onions, roasted red pepper, and spinach. Delicious! And the sauce was on the side. I plan to make many more of these.

This calzone turns out really nice. The first time I made it I put mozzarella cheese in it (all i had) instead of the cheddar, the second time I stuck with the recipe and it tasted better. Wait till the crust is golden brown, this tastes good! We made a couple of adjustments to the recipe by adding black olives, sausage. I will use this recipe again...I think it would be easy to manipulate the inside contents if you want to make a vegi calzone or greek. The breading is what earns this calzone 5 stars from me! Thankyou

Not one of my favorite recipes.  The taste wasn't bad but wasn't the best.  The dough is a little hard to knead very sticky.  I would recomend sticking it in the fridge for a bit before kneading.  Or flour it to the hilt!  Just so you can work with it.  Probably won't be making again.

These turned out so yummy! We took these over to a friends house and baked them fresh there. I doubled the recipe and divided the dough into 10 balls. My plan was to roll the dough out into circles here at our house and place the dough in between layers of wax paper to transport them. TIP: Never ever ever put yeast breads on wax paper! It sticks horribly no matter what you do.  Other than that they were delicious. I got compliments all night. Thanks Jenny

The crust is excellent!  I love it.  I add garlic powder and italian herb to the bread sometimes.  The recipe works on dough cycle in my bread machine, which makes it super easy.  Try sprinkling w/ cornmeal &/or parmesan topping before baking.

Excellent dish!  My family loved it!  I made the dough per instructions, used ham and sausage for the meat and used pesto instead of just basil.  The egg made a beautiful crust.  Don't skip it!

Yummy!  Love the crust for these.  Next time I would double the ricotta and add more pepperoni.  I used mozzarella, cheddar and an Italian blend of cheese.  I would also instead of combining the ricotta and the cheeses and everything, I think I will combine the pepperoni and ricotta, but leave the cheese and mushrooms to add on top.  it was a little hard to spread out onto the dough.  I will not add as much basil either.  This was very good dipped in a tomato sauce/parmesan cheese/Italian seasoning sauce.  Will definitely make this again... maybe not every week, but maybe every other!

These were really good!  I put all the ingredients in the bread machine on the dough setting.  Then divided into two and rolled flat to fill.  We filled with pepperoni, mozzarella, spinach and sun-dried tomatoes and used marinara for dipping sauce.  Next time I'll fill with only pepperoni and cheese but will definitely make again!

Incredible!!  The dough was crispy and tasted wonderful.  These are large calzones - although I added a lot of stuffing to mine.  I followed the dough recipe exactly and stuffed them with roasted chicken, broccoli, sauteed red onion and garlic, basil, mozzarella, parmesan, romano and cheddar.  Delicious!!  We may have these twice this week as I am already dreaming up new filling combos.  Thanks!!

These were easy to make and delicious.  I added Olives, green pepper and Italian sausage.  I also took the advice about making smaller portions and divided mine into 8 small calzones.  And they were still big enough to satisfy for dinner. Served mine with some red sauce.  I will definately make these again.

Not what I was thinking it would be...
The crust had a very strong flavor that overpowered my 'toppings.' I don't recommend salami/pepperoni. I added egg to my ricotta mixture to give more substance to the filling - my husband and I liked the texture. Pizza sauce on the side was a necessity.

This was a good recipe.  I am giving it only four stars because something called "Italian" and then using Cheddar cheese, it not "Italian".  I used Mozzarella instead, I added more Ricotta, since calzones are cheese based.  The dough was great though.  Then I added whatever people wanted, I did this instead of make your own Pizza night.  Remember folks, no "Cheddar" in "Italian" calzones.  "American" calzones maybe...

These were very good, I used sausage, quite a bit more than a half cup and I would suggest browning the mushrooms first to let some of the moisture out.  I shaped into 4 calzones and I did sprinkle the top with garlic powder after brushing with egg. I also added onion to my filling.  Great flavor!  I forgot to mention I used the dough cycle of my bread machine for the dough and just added according to specs on machine.

This review is for the dough as I made my own filling (spinach, ricotta and mozzarella).  The dough was easy to make and relatively easy to work with.  After the calzones came out of the oven they were a bit hard, but they softened up to the right texture after a couple of minutes.  A couple exploded on me but nothing too serious.  All in all a good recipe.

These were great! We put in green peppers instead of mushrooms, and it was fabulous. Next time I think I'll stuff it with more veggies.

I doubled the dough and made 4 large calzones.  The filling however I did my own thing with so this review is just for the dough.  It turned out lovely.

This was my first attempt at calzones.  They were good, but we could not even taste the mushrooms or pepperoni.  Next time I will add more of these items.

This was a delicious recipe!  I added some diced red peppers, diced ham, and used mozzarella cheese.  I made 8 small calzones instead of 2 big ones.  The crust was beautiful and even my kids loved them!  We will definitely be making these again.  It will be fun to experiment with different fillings.

I've made this recipe several times now and usually double the recipe to feed my family.  We like them better than ordering out pizza because everyone gets their own personal one with the fillings that they like.  They're great as leftovers too.

Very, very good. I used my own fillings, but used this for the dough. It was easy to work with and tasted wonderful. I did have to add a little more flour than the recipe called for, probably between 1/4 and 1/2 cup, but the dough turned out very well.

Dough is great to work with.  I made 5 calzones out of this recipe.  Check your yeast date, if it's old proof the yeast.  You can find an article of proofing yeast on this website.

Delicious! I make these all the time, but unlike the picture, mine are overstuffed and fat! The key to making this even more awesome is a great dipping sauce. Use your best spaghetti sauce! Also, the dough is really great and can be used for any other calzone recipe of all sizes. Thanks!

Very easy and tasty.  I didn't have pepperoni so mine were plain, but next time I want to add that or salami or seasoned ground beef.  I did change up the cheese and used ricotta, cheddar, mozzerella, and parmesan.  Makes 4 good size calzones.  I actually have enough dough leftover to make one more.  So, if you increase your filling, it would make 5 calzones.

This was really good.  I made a few changes, instead of ricotta cheese I used cottage cheese, I also used mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar cheese and added some sliced green bell peppers.  This is a great recipe and I will make again!  Thanks for sharing:)

It was good, it was faster then the normal "pizza dough" I usually make but my husband likes it a bit more chewy. I would make it again because I thought it was good especially because it didn't take me as long.

Never thought they would taste as good made at home, but now when I crave them i don't even have to get out of the house to get a good calzone.

I made this, made it again, and now I'm making it again. My husband, who is a food snob, said these were the best calzones he's ever had. I did put the sauce inside. And I put whatever else inside. The crust is what I really needed, and this was it! I'm so glad. And it was easy. Thank goodness!

I've never made calzones before and these were easy to make and easily the best calzones I've ever tasted.  The possibilities on fillings are endless and the crust is phenomenal.  I intend to use the crust recipe for pizza in the future as another reviewer suggested.  If you like calzones, make THIS recipe!

Wow, wow, wow.  These were sooo good.  I halfed the recipe because my husband and I were the only ones eating them.  I like a little extra ricotta cheese, so I put just a little more.  The chunked up pepperoni was a great change to sliced.  They baked up golsen brown and the perfect size.  The next day I gave my sister the recipe, which she tried and said that the next time she wants to impress a guy with dinner she's making these!  Easy to customize with your favorite veggies and cheeses.

This was fantastic.  The crust was so authentic!  I now use the crust recipe for pizza, and strombolli as well!  My husband is from Italy, so I omitted the things that weren't really Italian or else he wouldn't eat these (the cheddar cheese and pepperoni) and substituted with mozzarella and italian sausage and, added lots of veggies, like green peppers and onions. I alsospread a thin layer of sauce inside the calzone before baking.  This is recipe is definately worth keeping

thanks for making me look like a pro in the kitchen!!  presentation was absolutely beautiful!  Adjustments:  I used cooked bacon instead of pepperoni, and i added spinach and onions.  I used Swiss (and whatever else we had on hand) instead of Cheddar and I cut down on all cheese by half (for a more healthy meal).  marinara sauce on the side definately adds something.

Goooooood stuff. Added some spinach, and took a marinara sauce recipe from this site so we'd have something to dip it in. Very good.

These are GREAT calzones!!! I add italian sausage and chopped olives into the mix, and it tastes great! I also double the dough, and mix cinnamon and sugar in with half of it and make dessert calzones by adding apple pie filling. SOOOOOOO good!!!

This recipe is great! Beautiful presentation and very tasty! I used bread flour the first time and it turned out wonderful. Since I've used all-purpose with excellent results. My husband and children love it. This has become our new weekly staple.

To be fair, I used this recipe only for the dough, and filled the calzones with my family's preferred toppings, but that doesn't detract from the fact that this is an excellent dough recipe. Baked up crisp and golden, nice and chewy and soft inside.

GREAT recipe!
I substituted bread flour for the all-purpose flour.  I also added dried spices to the dough for added flavor.  It was easy, and very tasty.

This was very good!  The only modification I made was to use mozzarella instead of cheddar and my family loved it.  I think next time I will take others advice and add a little italian type seasonings.  All in all an excellent dinner!

If you are not comfortable or don't have time to deal with the dough making process, try using your bread machines dough function or thaw frozen bread dough which can be purchased at store. Both work well with recipe. However if using frozen dough allow enough time for thawing. You can find instructions on the packaging.

This is a great recipe.  I'm not very good at making dough that turns out well, but this recipe must be foolproof, because the end result was perfect.  I'm a vegetarian, so I just omitted the pepperoni, and if you don't have basil, just sub another Italian-ish seasoning.  And don't worry...you can sub any of your favorite shredded cheese for the ricotta cheese (finely shredded works really well).  So overall...I recommend this recipe for sure!

This is an excellent recipe.  It is a lot of work but well worth it.  I add some italian sausage and just use slightly less pepperoni.  This combination might be too meaty for some, but we love it.  Also, definitely mozzerella instead of cheddar.  When served with Exquisite Pizza Sauce, it is our favorite meal.

My husband made these and they were delish!  I must say that one calzone would have been plenty for the two of us.  They were VERY large.  This was also his first attempt at a yeast bread and it came out perfect.  I was very impressed!  Good recipe, great instruction!  Thanks!

This is a very good basic recipe.  I used salami, mushrooms, olives, green onions, pepperoni and mozzarella instead, but did use the basil which was excellent.  Instead of mixing the insides together I layered it- ricotta, then mozzarella, then toppings mixed with basil and more mozzarella.  They were very thick but I had enough dough to stretch over all the toppings.  Dough recipe was very easy.
Will definitely make again!

For some reason, this didn't taste like I was hoping it to. I think I messed up somehow on the dough, because it became a huge mess. I also didn't like the ricotta cheese filling. I thought it was little bland. I may try to make this again in the future.

I hope the "Calzone Police" aren't reading this because I do prefer my calzones with some sauce on the inside. I browned up sausage with onion and garlic, pulsed it thru the food processor, returned it to the skillet and added about a half a cup of tomato sauce just to give it some color and flavor and for a bit of a kick, I used pepper jack cheese. My calzones looked nothing like the picture as mine were big and fat and very yummy. Thanks so much Jenny, my family loved these!

This recipe is amazing!  I've never made calzones before, but I've eaten plenty of them, and these were the best I've ever had.. my boyfriend (who is really picky) said the same thing.

I read the reviews of the recipe before getting started, and I used a lot of the tips previous reviewers offered, such as mixing sugar in with the yeast and the warm water and making four smaller calzones instead of two huge ones.  I also used mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar and I used a LOT more flour than two and a half cups.

All in all, a really great recipe and I'll be making them again really soon!

i made this calzone recipe's dough for the ham & swiss stromboli (also on this website) as that recipe called for store bought dough & i wanted to make a homemade crust. on a healthy note, i substituted 1 c. all~purpose flour with whole wheat flour. the softness & elasticity of this dough makes it a breeze to work with. thanks jenny!

The dough recipe is great - it is easy to work with and rises perfectly.  I just like ricotta, mozzerella, and hame in mine, so I changed that part quite a bit.  I've also used the dough for pizza and that works well.

Great crust! I used totally different fillings. I took canned tomatoe paste and added fresh basil, oregano and garlic and brushed one half of the dough with the sauce. I then added my own toppings; chicken, onions, mushrooms, peppers, black olives and mozzerella cheese. I brushed the edges with egg as well to help seal together. This worked great! Thanks for the recipe.

Really great recipe. My husband is picky and he said this was the best new recipe I'd made in a very long time!  I did as many of the other reviewers said, and added a 15 oz carton of ricotta, and also cut the chedder in half and replaced the other half with mozzarella. Very easy and tasty. I sprinkled a little garlic powder in my filling mixture too. I think the dough is very easy to work with and tasty too!

I'm not an Italian so I actually put the sauce inside the calzone! These are SO good, I make then at least once a week, I added oregano and basil to the dough and it just adds a little 'something'!  Our friends love coming over for dinner, especially when they know I'll be serving these delicious calzones, thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was okay.  As others have said, I don't know what is up with the ricotta cheese, but it seems AWFULLY skimpy.  I used quite a bit more for these.  And they were not great, not bad.

These were good, but we prefer sauce inside of our calzones to us that is "real". So I added sauce, some pepperoni, ham, canadian bacon,grond beef, sausageand  parma,mozz,prov cheese.  We didn't use the egg but instead used a bit of olive oil and it turned out perfect.

These were very good.  I substituted Hot sausage for the peperoni and they were delicious.  I thought the big calzones were much tastier than making the individual calzones.  My 4 kids and husband all enjoyed them very much.  Did substitute mozz. chesse for the cheddar.

I, like lots of other people, made changes in the filling (mozzarella, more ricotta, etc.), but the dough was absolutely incredible!  Thanks for a great recipe! 

P.S.  Has anyone tried the dough as pizza dough?  If so, did it work out or was it too flimsy?

Not worth the work?? Yeah whatever! These were awesome! If you plan ahead a little, these make for a great lunch or dinner! I made 2: one plump full with extra pepperoni (for my boyfriend) and the second has very little pepperoni and extra veggies (green peppers/mushrooms = for me)! I didn't bother mixing the filling ingrediants, rather, just added what filling I wanted and sprinkled the basil between cheese "layers" (a little less than 1/2 TBLS per calazone).  I think Italian seasoning might work well if your out of basil.  Either way, dipped in pizza sauce...hmmm good! Will make these again. No Wait! I'll have to double the recipe when I make these again! Thanks Jenny!

Fabulous recipe! I have made this several times, and it is always easy and delicious. Be sure to let the yeast dissolve in the water for about 5 minutes. Also, the calzones are VERY big, so make plenty of room! Double the recipe for lots of leftovers.

This was delicious! I also made several (about 5) smaller calzones, and added leftover Italian sausage, ricotta, mozzarella and spinach to the filling (took out the pepperoni and cheddar). Hubby & preschooler loved it, too!

This is a great kid friendly recipe.  We left out the mushrooms and substituted Mozzarella and it was fine...My only mistake was honoring the request for Black olives inside...YUCK, they are too watery and oozed all over.  Other than looking bad, They tasted awesome.  I made some "miniature calzones" for my toddler and he loved dipping them in sauce.  This is a "keeper".

I have never made any pizza dough.  Wasn't aware of how sticky the dough would be.  Maybe it was just me, but I had a pretty big mess.   But I think the overall result was worth it.  It tasted great!

This recipe is excellent! We did not use the ricotta cheese and we put the sauce inside and they were delicious!! Just remember to follow the directions and the yeast package to make sure it is active. EXCELLENT!

Great recipe, fairly quick and tasted wonderful. However, since I'm new at this, my dough came out incredibly elastic when raw and very tough right out of the oven. Although when they cooled down a bit it softened up considerably. Very good, my wife loved it!

Crust was a bit tough.  Believe a blend of cheese with some mozzarella would be better.  Next time I will cook at 350 for a longer period to make sure center is warm.

These are the best calzones I have ever tried.  I made them for a Sunday dinner and the whole family complimented me on them.  The real calzone lovers said these are the best calzones!  Even better that in the best Italian restraunts.  The crust and filling were perfect.

This did not turn out for me. The crust didn't brown and the bottom of calzone was soggy. My very Italian husband begged me to find another recipe.

These are the best calzones I have ever had.  I love the enormous size.  I must say I don't cook much but mine came out perfect!  I made them for a friend and had to make more the next day!!!  Now we just need a recipe for the dipping sauce.

It took a little while, but they were really good!  I even doubled the recipe and it worked just fine, although I only needed one egg and one TBSP. of basil.  It would be a good recipe to play around with the contents too.

Personal preference, Maybe.  The crust was easy to make and tasty but the filling not so much.  I did not care for the ricota in the filling.  This was my first try at making a calzone so I followed the recipe to the letter.  I will look for another before I try again.

I make this often and pretend it I a diet food. I use turkey pepperoni, part skim ricotta and Mozzarella. I use these in healthier (bigger) amounts than what the recipe says. That is kind of skimpy. I also use fresh basil,torn. Good basic recipe. Except the cheddar!

There are 5 adults in our house, so I always make more servings. I did 16 I believe. I filled mine with spicy breakfast sausage, ham, and the various cheeses. Had extra sauce on the side to dip the calzone in. My family loved them-Very tasty, filling, great texture. Will be a meal I add into our meal rotation. 
Because of the extra servings, there were extras on hand for lunch the next day. They heated up well and tasted great the next day.

By far my favorite calzone recipe. It tastes better than the calzones in restaurants. We always add in olives, spinach, garlic and it’s one of our favorite mid week meals.

Made one with sliced deli roast beef and the riccota mixed with mozzarella cheese with a beef gravy dip. Used canned pizza dough (mine wouldn't rise) and it worked fine.

This recipe is awesome! The dough recipe is perfect and light; not thick, heavy and bready. I made the dough in my bread machine. Just follow bread machine standard by placing all wet ingredients in first then dry. I poked vents in the top of the calzones to let out the moisture from the mushrooms and brushed the top with olive oil and added some Sicilian blend seasoning I had on hand.

Really easy with most of the ingredients already on hand.   Not a big mushroom fan so remember to double the pepperoni to keep the protein portions right.   Also made a version with sausage/onions/peppers.   My family loves these - I make 8 small ones vs. 2 large ones.

Great Calzone!  I didn't make the dough.  Too much work for me.  I made your filling and added a bit of Parmesan cheese and a little olive oil and black olives and it was delicious!!
Yummy!

I wanted a real calzone recipe because the folded over pizza we get called calzone is NOT the same. This sounds exactly like what I had except the spinach. I'll be adding the spinach! :)

1st yes I did make changes. I add mozzarella to give it that stringing cheese action and used dry Italian herbs because that what I had. I also used turkey pepperoni and add these roasted tomatoes i got from the olive bar because I was making these for a tomato festival. These were a hit and I will be making them again.

Had higher hopes for this recipe. Calzones we enjoyed in Rome had much lighter crust.

Just because something is different doesn't mean it can't be good. I agree that ricotta and mozzarella are "traditional", but - think about it - those are two of the most tasteless cheeses ever invented. I tried this just for a change and was surprised at how tasty it was. That doesn't mean I'll abandon my ricotta and mozzarella calzones, but I also like trying new things. This works well and has a much stronger cheesy flavor - for a change.

While I love making this recipe, I made the adjustment of not adding regular cheese and just using ricotta as per one reviewers comment. I've only made it that way and it's a family favourite. I have just figured out that if I pan fry the mushrooms first, they release all their moisture before baking and don't make the bottoms all soggy.

This is the first time I made these and I was not disappointed.  I did use pizza yeast and did let it rise a bit although the directions say you don't have to.  I sautéed mushrooms, onions and spinach and added to the ricotta cheese mix with the pepperoni.  I served with a marinara on the side and they were soooooo good.  They were a hit in the house and fun to make so I will definitely make these again.  I didn't get a picture, they were eaten too quickly!

The dough is perfection-- soft but bakes with a moderate exterior crispness.  However, the filling is too dry and bland for me. I like sauce inside as it picks up the flavors of the other ingredients.  I used a very thin layer of ricotta/basil on the bottom, then did a light layer of sauce, and then topped it with chopped canadian bacon, kalamata olive and onion.  I topped that with shredded mozarella and parmesan and brushed the top crust with olive oil.  It was fantastic.  Even if those fillings aren't to your taste, in the original recipe, rather than cheddar, I would try a great italian cheese- fontina, for example, mixed with fresh mozarella and some parmesan.

I had a pre-made pizza dough which made this a Super Quick dinner. I also thought it could be dry, so I put a tiny amount of sauce on the dough under the filling. I combined ricotta cheese, about 1/4 cup Cheddar and 1 1/4 cup Mozzerella and chopped Salami and Pepperoni.  The egg wash made it look restaurant perfect. Will definitely make this again!

I made this today for lunch. My family loved them, I doubled the recipe so we would have plenty. I had to make my own ricotta cheese ( forgot to pick up at the store ). I added a few onions and colored peppers and some garlic. Loved the simple concept of the recipe. Thanks for the recipe.

This was my first attempt at homemade calzones, it was by request for my sons 18th birthday. I used a bread machine for the dough which came out perfect! I added a bit of italian seasoning and garlic salt to the dough which was a plus. Also I omitted the cheddar and replaced it with fresh grated mozzarella. We used black olives and marinated cherry tomatoes for the "toppings".  Overall it came out great, the only issue I had was that the first one I assembled was ruined, probably because I rolled the dough out too thin. I chalked it up to a learning experience, and the other three came out perfect! I would highly recommend this recipe and will be making it again soon!

Made this Fantastic  recipe many times now. I double the dough recipe and make two with the filling suggested and make two in a  meat version. My meat version is 1lb hamburger, 1/2 pound mild or sweet sausage, 1/2 yellow onion. Cook meat and onion together  and  then add 1 cup spaghetti sauce. and salt to taste. Simmer for a few minutes.  This is for people who can't have cheese!

It is OK. The first couple of times the filling leaked, so I was able to fix that by letting the dough rise longer, at least an hour, then sealed it very firmly. I also added crushed red peppers into the dough. I also used bread flour, makes it soft and chewey.

I'm rating this mostly for the crust. I altered the filling a bit, but I liked the texture of the crust very much. It came together quickly by hand and was ready to use within the hour. I will probably make it again.

I followed a couple recommendations from the reviews.   I switch up the cheeses.   I used the whole container of ricotta and a cup of mozzarella no cheddar.    And instead of the parsley I used Italian spice 1.5 tablespoon to be exact.  And I switched the egg wash and used olive oil instead.        This is going in my frequent meal book.   Absolutely wonderful.   We also used a Marinara sauce we made from our garden this summer.   I believe it was a recipe my wife got from all recipe as well.      It was perfection.   Thanks for this recipe.

Delicious!  The kids love it too.  We also like to add olives.  I followed the advice of others and used mozzarella cheese.   Instead of making the pizza dough I was able to find a local grocery store whose bakery makes fresh dough regularly and you can get it in the refrigerated area of the store.  This significantly cuts the time of creating this wonderful dish.

Have you used both mozzarella and ricotta and cheddar and ricotta. I would say cheddar and ricotta is MUCH better. Go by the recipe. Can't go wrong!  My kids love this too. I used pepperoni slices and they work just as well - just have to separate them a little so they are spread out in mixture. Loved this and will make next time with other ingredients like spinach and mushrooms.

I "cheated" in that I used pre-made dough I acquired at Safeway. (That's another story -- but ask at the bakery counter.) Used wonderful Pepperoni from delidirect.com. Otherwise followed the recipe. (I did "paint" the dough on both sides with olive oil prior to adding the filling.) Did not need the sauce as the result was unbelievably good!

I used the basic dough recipe and it was so, so.  The second time I added Oregano and Dried sweet Basil and it was better. Forget about the filling.  There are as many different ingredient combinations as there are people in the world.  It's like making Pizza, everyone has their own toppings.  FYI  Italians don't use cheddar cheese...so this isn't really "authentic", but the dough is nice, if you add a couple of spices.

Proof your yeast. Couple Tbs pizza sauce with the mixture inside too. No way cheddar go Ricotta.  Top with sprinkles of Parmesan. 30 minutes on pizza stone perfect. Next time I'd flip calzone for last 8-10 mins.

Great recipe! The instructions we're easy to follow and produced a great result. I used Italian sausage and mozzarella instead of pepperoni and ricotta...and added fresh basil. I skimped on the cheese...thinking the recipe called for too much...but next time I'll listen as mine could have been a little cheesier. I also added a bit more yeast as I saw in another comment and it worked like a charm.

I couldn't find the right cheese, I live in Japan and  cheese is rather hard to find at a good price,  so I used cottage cheese that didn't have much liquid to it. It tasted amazing and I'm going to make it again!

I like to make the dough the night before and leave it to rise on the fridge.  That way, we can make a quick weeknight meal.  These are a nice alternative to pizza.

My daughter in law made this for us. The bread was so light and fluffy and did not overwhelm  the ingredients.  She put everything but the kitchen sink  in them. My husband was still talking about them as he was falling asleep muttering (That was the best cal zone I have ever had.  Better than any restaurant.

This is a wonderful recipe very easy I thought I would mess up the crust but I didn"t . One suggestion make them smaller. 6 would be nice and big enough to handle. Let these sit for 5-10 minutes to cool and set a bit. I did add 1\2 cup of red sauce .Don't be afaid to use different filling ingredience . served with a salad. Yum Yum

I use this dough recipe every time I make calzones.  I switch up the fillings, but I always use this dough.  It's easy to make, bakes nicely, and has a good taste and texture.

Subbed in whole wheat flour for half of the AP with beautiful results. I also subbed mozz for the cheddar. Next time we'll use Italian sausage, as the adults were underwhelmed with the pepperoni. Definitely need to prick the tops with a fork or create a vent, as they did explode the filling a bit. Everyone loved them, including my very picky 4yo. I broke it into 4 calzones, but it could easily have been 6 or 8. Overall, a good recipe that needs only a little tweaking :)

This was just okay, I subbed pre-made pizza dough from our local bakery. I used mozzarella cheese, I am not a fan of cheddar in Italian food. I think it needed more, but it's definitely adaptable from this basic recipe. I think next time I will omit the ricotta, or add less, and add more meat like italian sausage, fresh basil leaves, spinach, etc.

I think this is a great recipe. I found it very easy to make and very easy to modify the filling. I agree with another reviewer that adding a dash or two of pepper and using mozzarella cheese is better, but it's all what appeals to the individual cook - isn't that the great thing about calzone? This makes 4 large calzone. I let kids build their own by mixing the cheeses with basil and pepper and then having an assortment of other items they could add. A note of caution to not overfill them or put much liquid in the filling; both may cause breaks in the sealed edges.

As others said, this is really bready crust, like thick pizza dough, i will therefore roll much thinner next time if i ever make it again.  The filling was 'way tweaked' by me.  I added 6 oz. fressh chopped spinach. . . .15 or so oz. of ricotta. . .more parmesean than recommended.  Overall, just test your filling.  Add maragoram (sp?) and basil (smaller amt) and other seasonings.  I think you could add anything, even sauce.  I did.  Overall, an okay basic recipe that needs a lot of tweaking. I used colby jack because i found the flavor to enhance the otherwise bland filling.  Just add up teh amt of filling, and figure how much you need and then change it to your liking.  I added sauteed onion as well.  Crust was very hard but perhaps i should've known to use a cheap white flour for softer texture?. . .i used whole grain white flour.   Use another recipe or tweak this one

The dough is delicious but it makes two HUGE calzones. Be careful not to roll the dough out too thin either.... Tomato Lava ooze. Oh yea and we cheated and put the red sauce inside... I like it that way.

The crust was awesome!! I did change it up a bit. I used shredded mozzarella, a very small bit (about a tablespoon per calzone) of my own homemade pizza sauce, cream cheese slathered on the dough ( I didn't have ricotta on hand), chopped fresh spinach, chopped ham, onion, & green peppers. It was PERFECT!! I divided the dough into 4 pieces so my family could request different ingredients for each of their calzones. I was lucky to even get a taste!! I am only giving 4 stars because I didn't follow the recipe exactly as is. Just b/c I've never heard of authentic Italian calzone recipes using cheddar.

I used fresh pizza dough that I get pre-made from the store. Also, I wouldn't THINK of using cheddar cheese, so I used mozzarella. The only other changes I made was adding some garlic and sprinkling the filling with Parmesan cheese. Everyone loved it. Next time I may sprinkle the crust with garlic and parmesan. Definately a keeper!

I agree with "mrsdi's" review about the cheddar cheese. I've never ever seen a calzone made in this fashion. I omitted the cheddar and added just the ricotta with the parsley, salt and pepper with sausage and it was truly awesome after the omission.

There was way too much seasoning in these so I am going to try it again only this time with some pizza sauce and pepperoni. Also, the recipe I made said it made 4 servings but in my family it was really 3 servings. My husband can eat one all by himself.

I made these as described with ingredients, but instead made 8 smaller pockets so they could be taken as leftovers (since there are only 2 people in my household.) I consider myself a novice cook with the only knowledge gleamed from this website and reviews from other users. These came out so yummy. The outside was firm but still soft and chewy inside. We would have liked to have more "stuff" inside, so in the future we plan to add more cheese, some additional veggies, and try different meats. We had a jar of pizza sauce in the cabinet already, so we used that to dip into. It was great fresh made and re-heated well the next day. As long as you have about an hour and a half to make a dinner, this is fabulous and a fun choice. We will make these at our next party and allow guest to pick from a variety of "pizza toppings" and let them make their own calzone! Friends are looking forward to it already.

I have made this soooo many times!  I add a few things, but legit, this is my go to meal. I use the dough as per the recipe, put in a half a pound of ground pork or pork sausage, some pepperoni, ricotta, cheddar, and mozzerella. (and whatever is in the recipe) Do an egg wash over the top, and some toasted sesame seeds.... I can not emphasize enough the toasted sesame seeds.....MAGIC.

This is an incredible recipe. I followed everyone elses suggestions and used the recipe for the dough- then made a ricotta/mozzarella mix for the inside with pepperoni. 

This one goes in the permanent family recipe box! SO GOOD!

The calzones I made I'd give five stars, but I did stray from the recipe for the filling. (I also proofed the yeast in the sugar and water for five minutes before adding oil, etc.) I used a 16 oz tub of low-fat ricotta (all I had was low-fat), about 2/3 cup freshly grated parmesan, pepperoni, and fresh herbs. I would love to try adding mozzarella, which I didn't have, especially because I didn't have enough filling for my last calzone. I made eight and each was a good size, perfect for a quick lunch. Other reviewers have noted that the bake time was too long but even with my smaller calzones they took about 25 minutes. And as per others' recommendations, I made the Exquisite Pizza Sauce for dipping and it was excellent. To illustrate how wonderful these are: after taking them out of the oven, I cut one in half and ate it, set the other half with the rest and planned on eating it later. Two hours go by and I return to find every single one is gone, including my half. ;( I suppose I'll have to make more!

I like this version better than those with the sauce in it. The dough doesn't get too soggy this way. Great calzones!

I agree with mrsdi...no cheddar cheese.  I used Ricotta and Mozzarella because I love the stringy texture of the cheese.  I also used salami, bell peppers, onions with the pepperoni.  Adding some red pepper flakes makes this recipe absolutely delicious.

I was a little disappointed with this recipe.  Based on the other reviews I thought it would be a little tastier.  As suggested, I followed the dough recipe but used the bread machine - found there was a lot of dough; made four very large calzones.  I tried the suggested filling for two of the calzones and added some extra ingredients to the other two.  Also used the Italian seasoning instead of basil and mozza not cheddar as suggested.  Next time I would make calzones even smaller/thinner and cook for 30 minutes, probably try adding some parmesan.

These looked really awesome when they came out of the oven, but the taste was just ok. The ricotta mixed in with the bread dough and cheddar so I didn't get that melty, cheesyness that I wanted. The bread dough looked great, but just tasted kind of bland.

This was a very good recipe.  I used extra ricotta, and also chopped up fresh mozzarella and added some shredded parmesan (instead of cheddar, which i didn't think fit the Italian theme!). They came out very well and I will make them again sometime!

We really liked this a lot. I used mozarella rather than cheddar. You can alter fillings to whatever you like. I'd like to try chicken and spinach too. Fun to make too!

I made this for my fiance and my father and both were impressed that it was "from scratch". It was quite simple to make, but didn't taste or look like it. I didn't follow the directions for the filling, using just shredded mozzarella and pepperoni as filling with a jarred sauce for dip. It was fantastic and I will certainly make this again.

A solid recipe.  As many have, I added sliced garlic to the mix and some finely chopped, fried bacon.  I used a premade pizza dough from the store so I can't speak as to the quality of the dough recipe, but the filling was plenty tasty.

A good meal. I added a bit of spinach and Canadian bacon to ours also I used Italian instead of basil as recommended by some users. I made 1 and 1/2 portions so we could have some as left overs for lunch ;) yummy!

This is absolutely AMAZING!  We love it.  I do divide the dough to make individual calzones (8 of them).  I also leave out the mushrooms.  When the calzones are about 5 minutes from being done, I spread a spoonful of spaghetti sauce on top of each one and I put mozzarella cheese on top, too.  Then I put it back in for the remaining 5 minutes or until the cheese is all melted.  I do still set out a bowl of sauce to dip in, too.  This recipe is easy and fun.  You can VERY easily change out the ingredients inside for whatever you prefer, but I don't recommend putting really juicy ingredients inside, because that could affect the dough.  Also, if you make it with the filling they suggest, you could easily prepare the filling the day before if you will be short on time on the day you serve it.  Just store the filling in the fridge.

Five stars!! These were great. I let it rise twice...the first before filling and again after.Super light crust!! You can really just pick whatever filling you like. We did one with Italian sub coldcuts (ham/cappy/pepperoni/salami) and provalone cheese and the other with veggies, cheddar, basil oregano and garlic. It will be back soon...... I too agree that Mozzella would be more authentic Italian than cheddar. As it happened what I had in the fridge today were provalone and cheddar........so that is what went in it. The cheddar was quite good with the veggies though.

these were easy and delicious! this was my first time making bread and making calzones. i only used the dough part of the recipe and i made 4 plate sized calzones instead of 2 big ones. i filled them with different things for the different people eating them. the calzone shell was yummy. i used my kitchenaid mixer's dough hook (for the first time) and it was really easy. just threw it all in the mixing bowl and let the hook do the work! i needed to use lots of flour when i rolled it out because it was pretty sticky.

Very good considering this was my first time at making homemade calzones.  Next time, I'll make 4 smaller ones as they were HUGE; I saved what I didn't eat for lunch tomorrow.  I also think I'd like more cheese filling.  I used mushrooms, onions, and diced tomatoes and instead of basil, used italian seasoning and garlic powder.  Adding additional types of cheeses suits this well - I chose mozzarella, parmesan, and the ricotta.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Our family loves this recipe. I make 8 smaller calzones with each recipe so that family members can include their own favorite fillings. These work GREAT for my daughter's school lunches. I add ricotta, mozz cheese, thinly sliced turkey pepperoni, and a little italian seasoning. I make a double-batch and freeze them individually wrapped in press and seal. They reheat in 30 seconds in school microwaves without getting mushy. Much cheaper than hot pockets! They also make easy afterschool snacks.

These were pretty darn good! I used pepperoni and hamburger seasoned with "Itailian Style Sauage" and "Jay's Signature Pizza Crust". I will make these again!

This was good. The kids liked them well enough. Maybe a bit plain and I even used Italian sausage.

These are super easy to make and taste great. You can pretty much  fill them with anything + cheese. I like to make 8 small ones. They're very fulfilling

These were great! I forgot the salt the first time, and somehow the were still pretty good. I made them again (with salt) and if you roll them out really thin, they make a lot and you still have a wonderful crust. I was told these were the best calzones the person had ever had!

Wonderful dough that baked up nicely! I doubled the oil in the recipe since I didn't want to risk dry calzones. I filled the calzones with japanese style curry instead. Delicious when fresh~ Gets rather dry and chewy the next day.

i didnt make the dough this time. i didnt have enough time, so i bought a pre made ball of pizza dough from my grocery store. i used alot more cheese then called for. used about a pound of ricotta and a prolly 3/4 lb of mozz that i grated my self. i added an egg to the cheese mix. i didnt brush the calzones with anything before i baked them, but when they came out of the oven i brushed them with garlic butter and sprinkled with parm cheese. i made 3 large calzones. plain cheese, pepperoni, and ground beef w/ onions.

these were good...i made a few substitutions because i was trying to use up some odds and ends...ended up putting in carmelized onions, bacon, a little bit of chopped up left over chicken, garlic, basil, mozzarella, and ricotta...i'm anxious to try it as written...i like those ingredients too...just didn't have them on hand.  and because i used about 2/3 whole wheat flour, i added a little more sugar.

Sooooo good, I wish I could give this six stars!  The dough recipe is fabulous.  I have found that taking them out RIGHT when they turn golden brown is key, if you leave them in too long the calzones are harder to cut into ( but still delicious).  They are also pretty big, so if you're just making this for two make sure you bring your appetite!  Thank you for the awesome recipe!

We really enjoyed this recipe. I made 8 small calzones instead of 2 large ones because my children all like different things in theirs. I did ham/mozzarella/ricotta in some and added broccoli and mushrooms to others. They turned out really good.

Fantastic!  Made the dough and filling the day before to save time and refridgerated it overnight.  I made four calzones, baked on my pizza stone, and served with homemade pizza sauce.

This was amazing! We did have to look up how to make the dough as this was a bit vague- i.e. proofing and such. We also used cheddar and mozzarella cheese and WAY less than what was suggested--our calzones were bursting as it is, since I'm not a fan of ricotta. We picked our own inside ingredients, pineapple and black olives.  Overall the recipe was amazing, and I just copied it into our kitchen cookbook! Thanks!

I did not make the crust, but used the filling for an idea for my cooking classes.  I used frozen pizza crust and let it thaw overnight.  It worked great and is a heck of lot less work.  These are 12 and 13 year olds working with this recipe.  I did not add that much basil.  That sounded like just too much for me and I'm Italian.  It was a huge hit with the sample I made!

We have calzone night with our friends every now and again. I usually set up a 'calzone bar' so everyone can put what they want in them. This time I used this recipe. I had never tried them with the ricotta. Instead of the pepperoni, I used a pound of ground sausage and I used a mix of cheddar cheese with mozarella. I doubled the crust recipe and made 7 large single calzones with 3 mini pizzas for the kids. YummMM!!!!!!

This was good and I loved the crust but mine was very hard after baking. I think I over stuffed it. I just used sausage and the cheeses and it could have used more cheese. I also baked mine on a stone until lightly browned and it was just so hard. I guess next time i will follow exact and see what happens.

I am only rating/reviewing the crust because I made my own filling (spicy sicilian chicken with roasted bell peppers, onions, tomatoes, and a combo of ricotta, mozzarella, and cheddar cheese.. YUM)

The crust was pretty good but I realized I misread the recipe. The number of servings says 8 so I assumed the dough would make 8 calzones. I ended up making 6 decent sized calzones and I thought they were too thin and didn't hold the filling well. Now that I read the recipe more carefully, I realize I was only supposed to make 2. So I guess my review can't be considered very accurate, but for what it's worth, even though they were thin, these did taste great and the dough was very easy to work with. I'm sure that if I had made them thicker, I would've given this 5 stars. Also, I opted to put the sauce inside, but I wouldn't advise it. It takes away from the taste of the filling by making it too saucy, so follow the recipe and keep the filling dry!

I make lots of recipes but rarely review them. this one is worth the review!  great, and great-looking crust. filling could have used a little more spice, next time i'll try some basil and some italian seasoning mixed with the cheese.  also i'd divide into 4 or 6 smaller calzones.  made 2 large ones, even my husband could only eat half!  thanks for the recipe!!!!!

Loved the bread for this but next time I make this I'm going to add a lot more cheese.

These turned out superbly.  Instead of using cheddar cheese, I used mozzarella with the ricotta for the inside.  From the advise from some users, I used Olive Oil instead of eggs, and used some of my own toppings.  Also, I divided the dough by thirds instead of halves, because they were so large.  Tasted great and the guests loved them.

Perhaps this is a case of different expectations, but I found the crust to be sub-par. It almost tasted like a pie crust, while I was expecting something far lighter and almost bread like.

This was a hit!  My husband actually made these for dinner (and he's not a recipe follower at all)-they came out great.  We made the dough exactly as described and then added in our own favorite calzone ingredients.  This is going into the family favorites recipe box! :)

My husband and I love these! He asks me to make them all the time.  I use spicy italian chicken sausage, mozzerella, mushrooms and fresh basil plus a little bit of store bought pizza sauce since I like sauce in my calzones.  The dough is a great recipe and very versatile, use whatever you want on the inside, but brushing them with egg is a must!! Gives the perfect crispy, golden color every calzone should have. Thanks for a great recipe.

My only complaint is that I wish the dough was more doughier.  Crusty and crunchy is good but with not with italian calzones.  I tried to be pseudo healthy here and used part skim ricotta - i wouldn't recommend this, go for the gold instead!  i also stuffed mine more, adding swiss cheese, ham and a little ground beef.  Ok so mine was more like a sandwich...though it was delicious!  this also made mine look a lot bigger and not as flat.  I would recommend, after the brush of egg, to sprinkle some oregano, basil and mozzerella cheese over the top.  I think the main thing with calzone and stromboli recipes is to find one that fits your preference of dough, and stuff them according to your liking.  When I was growing up, the only calzones I ever heard of were strickly ricotta and other cheeses - I didn't even know you could stuff with meats!  I agree with whomever made the recipe that an authentic calzone does not have sauce inside.  :)

Fantastic! I omitted the mushrooms (cuz my kids don't like them) and added diced ham.  Like another reviewer, I substituted mozzarella for the cheddar and used Italian Seasoning for the basil, as well as using olive oil versus the egg wash.  

These really were fantastic!  My kids LOVED them!

This is the first time I've made calzones, but I'm pleased by how simple it was. This is a good, basic recipe, and I definitely feel confident in experimenting with the fillings next time so each of my kids can have their favorite variety.

My ONLY suggestion would be that the filling is super rich and creamy, but a little bland. We were dipping in seasoned marinara sauce, so that added a lot of flavor. Maybe more in the calzone itself would have been overkill?

I think next time I may add a dash of Italian seasoning to the filling mix and skip the sauce.

Excellent flavor! As suggested by another reviewer, I brushed the top of the dough with olive oil instead of egg.  I heaped in more ricotta than called for (can you ever have too much cheese?)  Great results!

I was a little nervous since I have never made calzones before, but these turned out great!  I had to make a couple alterations because I didn't have all the ingredients available.  I used brown sugar instead of white sugar, and mozzerella cheese instead of ricotta.  I also put butter on top instead of the egg.  I'm definitely going to make this again, but next time I'll properly prepare for these.

The mixture for the ingredients to go inside the calzone was perfect- just the right amount of everything.
The dough did not work out well. It was just way too thin to hold the inner parts of the calzone. I will make this again, only with the cheese mixture but without this dough recipe.

This was great. I did change a couple of things. I did not use chedder, I used mozzarella instead, and olive oil on top instead of egg. Also use a pizza stone if you have one, the bottom will cook more even.

These are very good.  Both my husband and I were curious to see how the flavors work together and we were pleasantly surprised.  Definitely not the usual American fare, that is for sure.  I have used the dough many times for other calzone recipes and it handles beautifully.

I made these exactly as the recipe states & they are pretty good!  The dough is fantastic & easy to work with.  The filling wasn't as good as I had expected but it is my personal taste.  I will make these again but use mozzerella & parmesian instead of the cheddar & not use nearly as much basil - the basil flavor is too overwhelming for me.  I would also suggest a bit of oregano.  
This is an EXCELLENT basic recipe that has so much potential!

Absolutely great taste!!  I never thought I'd attempt my own dough but it was easy and I loved it!  I took a few hints and let the yeast sit with the sugar for 10 min., I also used ricotta, red pepper and ham.  I might try garlic butter on the crust instead of egg next time.  Thanks!

Loved this recipe but make SURE you use the dough as soon as it rises and you roll it out.  I waited an hour before cooking it after I filled it and everything and it DOUBLED in size...it was very bready but I can tell it would have been great if I would have put it in the oven right after I made it.  Used the BBQ Chicken Calzone filling and it was fantastic.

Great recipe!  My hesitation in making calzones is that I didn't want the crust to get soggy on the bottom -- this recipe took care of that problem perfectly by not including the sauce inside.  Nice and filling and easy!

I used this recipe just for the dough and it was fantastic! I made 4 calzones instead of 2 large. The family added what toppings they liked and we served the sauce on the side. These came out beautifully and were an instant HIT. Easy, Customizable and Fun - we will definitely make these often.

I've never made the dough. I usually thaw frozen bread dough and divide it. Great filling, overall wonderful dinner. Be careful not to overfill the calzones, since the filling will spill out and may burn.

Nice clean simple recipe that was enjoyed by both my kids (4 and 2) and husband. I did make some substitutions however, including mozza for cheddar; broccoli for mushrooms and I added small bits of pepperoni. This is so wonderful as you can change the inside ingredients any time you like or with whatever is on hand.

This was a breeze to make.  the dough come out perfect.  It made the best crust!!  I made two sets (doubled recipe) the first i put the filling listed here and it was good, although next time i will add a ton of spinach and no pepperoni.  The second i filled with provalone and italian cold cuts.  I sent the 4 off with my husband for the 'guys' and only a small piece of one came back.  It was a huge hit!  It is just to simple not to make again, all i can think of is different ways to stuff it!  thank you

I did everything just like it said, except forgot about brushing it with egg.  I love the dough, it is sooo easy to work with.

Basically I just use this recipe for the dough, which is GREAT! But then everyone in my family gets to add whatever kind of cheese and toppings they like. Everyone loved them, but the first time I made them everyone was a little weirded out by the fact their was no sauce on the calzone itself. But once they started eating, they got over it, I served some to dip in.

I only made the crust for this recipe - so I can't comment on the filling. The crust was great, crispy, soft, chewy... absolutely lovely. I will be adding it to my "go to" recipe file.

This was an ok recipe.  The dough seemed a bit 'yeasty' for me and maybe a tad salty. But it did roll out nicely and cooked well. Thanks for the recipe.  :)

This was a great recipe! I used a provologne/mozzarella/cheddar mix because I wanted it more pizza like and it was really good. I also added olives and sun dried tomatoes. A keeper for our family!

Outstanding.  Easy to make, but does take a little time.  Only alterations I've made to this wonderful recipe is I add about 1.5-2 times the amount of ricotta and cheese.  I also blend mozzarella, cheddar and parmesean, and add in cooked sausage on one, and pepperoni on the other.  My whole family, even the little ones, love Calzone Night!!

The dough turned out great.  The filling...was okay.  I will make again but add some homegrown tomatoes or something to provide some juice and zing.  Family preferred the BBQ chicken ones.  Made breadsticks last night from the dough and those were fabulous!!

I needed to add about 1/4 cup of extra flour to the dough while kneading because it was so sticky. I split the dough to make 4 calzones, and used frozen red pepper (fresh that was frozen leftover) and onions in addition to the called-for filling ingredients (excluding the mushrooms). 1 tablespoon of basil was overwhelming, (i cut it to 2 tsps basil + 1 tsp oregano but was still too dominating. I am someone who normally cannot have enough spices in my food! (i may have read the recipe wrong, maybe it was only sposed to be 1 tsp.) DEFININATELY do the egg wash if you make these! It makes them beautiful. I sprinkled the tops with garlic salt & basil before baking & after brushing with the egg, then served with spaghetti sauce in cute little cups for dipping.
My Italian husband  requested they be made again :)

delicious! we make this all the time. We use mozzarello cheese instead of cheddar. I sometimes use chopped ham too. Excellent dinner idea. Reheats well for leftovers.

When making these I was curious why no seasoning was added to the cheese/veggie mixture.  After making them I see why...they are delicious without it!  Yummy!  Thanks so much!

These are great for a home dinner or you can pack and take to the park or beach - just wrap in tinfoil and take the dipping sauce! I add grated parm and shredded chesse as well.  So yummy!

Very good.  My husband and I don't eat pepporoni, so I sauteed the mushrooms with some spinach instead.  I may have also neglected to seal mine well, b/c the filling "escaped" out through the seams. (Either that or I overstuffed).  But they were still delicious.

Yummy.  I made 4 smaller calzones instead of 2 big ones.  The smaller calzones were a good size.  My boyfriend ate 2 of the little ones and I informed him that he just ate 4 servings as per the recipe! I added a little sauce to them and used mozzarella instead of riccota.  I also roasted some eggplant and added diced onion and cooked broccoli.  Will definitely make again.

This was the first time I tried making homemade dough, and it was very easy! Don't let that scare you off. We made several kinds of calzones, but our favorite was stuffed with orange and yellow bell pepper, Italian sausage and pepperoni. Experiment with different varieties when you make this - and make enough to freeze... these make a wonderful day-after lunch!

These were ok, but not as flavorful as I had expected. I used italian sausage instead of pepperoni. I tasted them with and without sauce, and the sauce improved the taste, but only slightly. Sorry, but thanks anyway for the recipe.

Great Recipe! Just made it tonight, I didn't use diced pepperoni and it didn't matter, however next time I'll use mozzarella or a pizza cheese mix instead of cheddar.

These are really good,great way to use up ricotta cheese leftovers. I made it with cheddar and also with swiss cheese, and we like it better with swiss because we could not taste cheddar that much. I think mozzarella would be great too. Excellent recipe.Thanks

This was really good! Husband and I had fun making them. However next time will try Mozzarella instead. The cheddar seemed a little greasy. Also will cut back on the basil was a little intense for my taste. Will be a keeper thanks!

My family loves this recipe.  We use only mozzarella (cheddar is greasy and I don't like the flavor for Italian recipes).  I also throw in mushrooms.  All of the dicing is done with my food processor.  Bake on a pizza stone.

We LOVED this.  I didn't have mushrooms, but we put diced red pepper and diced turkey pepperoni in it.  It came out picture-perfect as a result of having been painted with the egg.  We dipped it in pizza sauce.  It was worth the bit of extra work it required to make.   Can't wait to try with lots of different fillings!

Wonderful calzones.  The dough tasted great.  Instead of mushrooms, we used mozzerella cheese, ricatta cheese, chedder, some parmesian, pepperonni, and spinach.  The spinach went very well with it.

I have tried making calzones in the past, but this recipe was by far the best calzone recipe I've tried. It was quick and tasty. It was also very nice to put into lunches the next day without wondering if sauce was going to get on everything.

This was soooo yummy.   The family just loved it.  I made 4 calzones rather than 2, used old cheddar, green peppers, hot peppers and diced fresh tomatoes.  I spyaed the tops with cooking spray for some crispness.  Yummy, can't wait to try them again!!!

I made these for co-workers and they were great, I used mozzerella cheese in place of ricotta since no one cares for ricotta cheese and they were great.  Thanks so much for the post.

This recipe was decent, And I will defintly try again, just my first time making my own dough, and I don't think it came out just right. Plus I do not have a rolling pin, so my soup can improvision was'nt the best either(see pics) lol. I just used cooked sausage, ricotta, mozzerella,peppers and onions for my fillings. Very filling.

I made this for my family lastnight and everyone, including my four-year-old, loved it.  Instead of making the dough in the recipe, I bought a pre-made dough from my local bakery.  Next time I will make a little more stuffing because I had some extra room in the calzones.  Very good.

This was my first time making my own dough and it turned out great.  I did proof the yeast first as someone suggested.  I made 4 calzones and varied my filling (pepperoni, fresh spinach, green peppers).  They each turned out great.  I will be making these again!

Great recipe!  I did change one thing, rather than use cheddar cheese, we used mozzarella.  Also, I added black olives and made one with pizza sauce in it and one without (picky husband!)  Either way, fabulous!

Thanks alot Jenny,  My husband loves this bread so much that it has taken place of my homemade pizza dough.  Its amazing how many different ingredients can go inside a calzone we are having alot of fun trying new things with this bread recipe.  I've even made fruit filling for them and added a little more sugar to the bread.  Everything we have tried turns out great.  This is a fabulous recipe

We love these! My kids love calzones and picking what they want inside. They are a fun meal. They're worth the extra little bit of effort. I've even used leftover spaghetti sauce I made and it was delicious. These are very good.

I was really skeptical of my ability to make this. I've never made anything with yeast before. The crust was surpisingly easy though and came out tasting great. The only complaints about this recipe is the stuffing. I prefer precooked and seasoned chicken, broccoli and mushrooms w/o ricotta. Even still, this recipe is easy enough and good enough to make again.

Wonderfully versatile! I love this recipe - we have some picky eaters and it was easy to please everyone by dividing the filling and adding different things to each. The kids had a four cheese calzone (ricotta, cheddar, mozerella and parmesan) with pepperoni, and the adults added the vegetables! I like the fact that every time I make it, it can be different. It's also nice to serve with several sauces to add to the versatility. No one can hate this one!

Wonderful!  I have to admit that I cheated and used spaghetti sauce from a jar, along with mozzarella, chopped bell pepper, mushrooms, and pepperoni instead of the filling suggested.  These tasted like the ones you get at Italian restaurants!  The beaten egg brushed on the tops made them really beautiful. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I made the filling with mozarella cheese and McCormick's Pizza Seasoning Grinder and pepperoni. It was delicious. 5 of us ate all of it and would have eaten more, so I'm not sure why others had too much and we could have easily eaten more. We're pigs I guess. I made Exquisite pizza sauce from this site to go with it. I had doubters, as I usually make calzones with everything on the inside but I know that I prefer this now and they might as well get used to it since I'm the one cooking and you get what the cook likes around here. This was excellent and we'll be adding it to the rotation. Thanks!

I add chopped onion and green pepper to the filling of this wonderful calzone. My husband wouldn't mind if I made this once a week-it deserves the 5 star rating that it has!

This was a big hit with my family.  I did think that there could have been at least twice the filling in each of the Calzones.  Next time  - I am doubling the filling for sure!  We will have this again and again!

I have followed this exactly quite a few times.  I have doubled it in the past for guests and probably could do without that (they are HUGE!).  I prefer more ricotta and I let anyone put in their own extras.  They bake great and taste wonderful.  I really reccomend rolling out the dough a lot to make it a bit flatter as if not, it is a TON of carbs.

The bread was great, but I wasn't as impressed with the filling.  Maybe I don't know what "real" calzones are like, but I didn't care for the ricotta cheese in the filling.  It gave it almost a scrambled egg like texture.  I will use the recipe again only omitting the ricotta and adding more shredded cheese.

Great recipe - really fast and easy to make.  I did change a few things: I substituted italian sausage for pepperoni and used pre-made pizza dough.

I love this!!  We have made a lot of changes though for our family preferences.  We use sausage, mozarella, and red pepper.  Often, if I am in a hurry, I just buy pre-made pizza dough for the calzone, and it has turned out just fine.  I appreciated the advice to use more ricotta cheese, I found this to be a good suggestion.

I was disappointed with these. I followed the recipe exactly, but the crust was rock hard on top, and they puffed up like pasties - nothing like the picture. The filling was ok but nothing exceptional. I very much doubt I'll make them again.

Delicious!  I made a few adjustments to the filling, I used mozza & ched. cheeses, no ricotta.  I used black forest ham lunch meat, fried onions & mushrooms, no basil leaves.  The only complaint I got was there wasn't enough filling.  I made the dough exactly as recipe called and wouldn't change a thing.  Next time I will use ricotta cheese just out of curiosity.  This is a keeper, thank you Jenny!

These were very yummy!  I killed the yeast (or something), so I spread the filling onto a pizza crust, topped it with sauce, and then added a little bit more cheese and pepperoni.  Delicious!  I was so filling I could only eat one piece.  I can't wait to try this again, and hopefully I will get the dough right!

I thought this was a great recipe to make with my 3 year old but the dough turned out a little chewy.  Next time I will double the filling.  Did use mozzerella like everyone else and the exquisite pizza sauce.

These calzones are delicious! I have made these twice now and I love them. They're incredibly easy to prepare and incredible tasting. I used regular ricotta cheese the first time and low fat the second time and you couldn't tell the difference between the two. I made these for my super picky father and he basically inhaled his! ;) This has definitely found a spot in my "top recipes" collection. Thanks so much for sharing!!

Wow...so good!  I cut the recipe in half and got two medium sized calzones, I left out the pepperoni and added chopped broccoli instead, and I added a little mozzarella inside too.  I topped it with Exquisite Pizza Sauce and it was fabulous.  Not to mention how EASY it was to make, raised up perfectly, the dough was so easy to work with, and it baked up just right.  I'm definitely making this again!

It was my first time making calzones, and I was very impressed with these! They turned out great. Apart from letting the dough rise, they don't take that long to make. The crust turned out perfect, not too soft or too hard. In mine, I put zucchinis, tomatoes, mushrooms, vegetarian pepperoni, and mozzarella. Next time, I will add some ricotta. I will definitely keep this recipe closeby, and make them again and again!

My husband LOVED this recipe.  The calzones I made were enormous (3 times fatter than in the picture) and I had to save half for later.  He, on the other hand, didn't save even a bite.  If overeating is any indication of a fine recipe, then you will know this one is the best. Try using less riccotta and more mozzarella (instead of weird cheddar).  Stuff it with spinach, onion, broccoli, garlic, and anything else you like!  Thanks Jenny!

Great recipe!  I used mozarella instead of cheddar, and sprinkled garlic powder on the filling before closing up the calzone (I use garlic OFTEN!)  The next time I make them, I'll roll the dough a little bit thicker as mine was too thin for my family's tastes.
