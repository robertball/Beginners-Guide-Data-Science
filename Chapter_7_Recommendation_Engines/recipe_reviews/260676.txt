This was good! There are a couple of things I will do differently next time. The sausage needs doubled in my opinion which also means you wouldn't even need the butter the recipe calls. You can save yourself a step and an extra dirty dish too by just leaving the sausage in the skillet while making the gravy. Lastly, you need to plan on a little more time in the oven. 10 minutes worked perfectly for me. This is a good recipe and one I will make for guests.
