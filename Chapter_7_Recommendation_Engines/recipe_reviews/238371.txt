I like this recipe. when I made the dough I found out the dough was to soft to put into 1 inch balls as the directions tells you so, my solution was to put the dough in a plastic container and put it in the fridge and let it sit over night. When I pulled it out this morning it was settled like I thought it would. I put the dough into 1 inch balls and put them in the freezer for about a half an hour. Melting the chocolate was easy but I ran into problems on the way, when I dipped the dough into the chocolate some of the dough fell off into the chocolate. the first few balls turned out beautifully the others not so much but they taste delicious.

My nephew, Joseph, absolutely loves these so much he couldn't stop eating them, as we were making them!  I love them, too. You can't fail with this recipe.
