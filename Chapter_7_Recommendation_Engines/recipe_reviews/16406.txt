LOVED THIS RECIPE!!!  Just before the chicken was done frying, I added a pkg of frozen stir fry veggies (which finished cooking after adding the sauce mix).  Served over white rice and chow mein noodles.  GREAT STUFF!! And soooo easy to make.  The hardest part was cutting up the chicken!  thanks for sharing this recipe!  Don't add too much flour or cornstarch...you need enough sauce to saturate the rice (if you serve over rice).

This was a great base recipe, and with just a few tweaks it quickly became a five-star meal! I skipped the zest and the salt and toned down the garlic for personal preference. When I started, I cooked some spaghetti noodles and set those aside. Along with the bean sprouts, I added broccoli, red pepper, and a small can of mandarin oranges, juice and all (you can also use the mandarin juice to mix with the flour when you thicken the sauce). Then threw in some extra (low-salt)soy sauce to balance out the extra juice. Stirred in the spaghetti noodles and served. We added the cashews and chow mein noodles at our plates so they wouldn't get soggy with any leftovers. Next time I think I will also add carrots, snap peas, and mushrooms. It was so fast and easy that this is getting added to our meal rotation!

Very good! Better than take out and was just as fast. Used instant rice to serve with it, and added cubed green peppers and pineapple, and used a little of the pineapple juice too for taste. skipped the salt and orange rind and added some of the pineapple juice and found that this made the saltiness disappear completely and gave the sauce just what it needed.

This recipe was very good.  I changed it a little bit, adding about 1/8 tsp ground ginger, and 1 Tbsp Orange Marmalade.  I also served it over white rice and added broccoli instead of bean sprouts.  It tasted similar to Orange Chicken you get from chinese restaurants without the breading on the chicken.  Maybe next time I will add a little red pepper flakes to give it a little heat.  Will definitely make this again.

A little too salty, but cut the salt, in half, and this is really good.  I prefer to use cornstarch rather than flour to thicken - Half as much cornstarch is the ratio to use.  Good over hot cooked rice.

My hubby is crazy for this!  We serve over brown rice and use carrots, peppers, and broccoli instead of the sprouts.  You can make any # of modifications to this one and never go wrong!

I thought this was just great (and a great substitute for the store-bought, high-calorie, fastfood version with this name). I added 1 tsp of corn starch to the bowl holding the orange juice mixture and threw in some chunks of onion and green and red peppers. The sauce coats the chicken nicely.  This is a keeper.  I made a vegetable lo mein on the side and added mandarin oranges for additional color to the plate.  Yum!

I have never made anything this good!  It was easy to make, mostly prep time, and it came out tasting fantastic.  I also added some frozen stir fry veggies and they went well with the dish.  You won't be dissapointed by this one!

My family loved it, I used corn strach to thicken and added a little more zest. Great with rice, and so easy!

With a few additions this is awesome! I added some large-diced celery, a can of water chestnuts and some broccoli florets that I pre-steamed a bit.. THE SAUCE:  definitely bland and too salty so I followed the recipe except left out the salt, doubled the brown sugar and then added 2 Tbsp. of honey, 1 Tbsp orange marmalade and 1/2 tsp (to taste) of red pepper flakes and 1 1/2 tsps finely minced fresh ginger. I also stirred 2 tsps. of cornstarch into the sauce BEFORE adding to the skillet INSTEAD of using the flour. THEN TO MAKE IT THE BEST----top with some chopped CASHEWS right before serving! This sauce came out awesome!  You'll love it!
Second time to make it I was in a hurry.  Still added 1/4 cup orange marmalade and some grated ginger and some hot pepper flakes to the sauce but added no veggies just like in the recipe.  I did serve over rice and sprinkle with peanuts.

A wonderful change from the usual stir fry! My husband has a cholesterol problem and this dish was perfect. You can easily use less chicken and not miss it. Not only that but you can add nearly any vegies to it. I added a little pineapple, celery, broccoli, green pepper and red for a beautiful splash of color. Even my youngest said it was good and she views any new dish with suspicion. And use a little orange zest. You don't have to use as much as it says but it makes a difference even if you just use a little. We will make this again. YUM!

Geez, this was great! I cut the soy sauce by about half and instead of using orange juice I put a peeled and seeded orange in my blender. The pulp cooked down and then BAM the fresh orange really came out. I'm adding this to the recipe box for sure.

I decided to try to follow the recipe as close as possible the first time, against my instincts. I really should have gone with my gut. 1/4 cup is WAY too much soy sauce. The sauce basically tasted like soy sauce to me. I could barely even taste the orange. I do think it will be good with modification though, and I will try it again.

Yum, this recipe is wonderful.  My husband actually said "if Panda Express tasted like this we'd eat there more often!"  :-)  I made some modifications:  I used two large chix breast that I boiled and cubed a head of time.  I added frozen veggies to this recipe in which I started to "stir fry" while the sauce was cooking up on another burner.  I doubled the sauce.  I omitted the salt, and mixed my soy sauce with a bit of water (less sodium).  I used sesame oil rather than veggie oil in which I fully recommend when making anything Asian.  The order in which I cooked this was:  Boil and cube chix ahead of time, in a small pot mix sauce together and bring to a simmer, add flour until desired consistency.  In the meantime start to stir fry veggies in large pan.  Just before sauce is ready add chix and noodles to veggies.  Then add sauce.  Stir fry for 2-3 mins.  ENJOY!

I added about 4 tablespoons of orange marmalade, used squeezed orange juice and zest, added cashews, used yellow, red and orange peppers but will probably add frozen peas. I also used orange juice with corn starch to thicken the sauce.

Good, easy recipe.  Added green, red, and yellow pepper once chicken was cooked.  I could really taste the orange flavor - husband couldn't tell.  Omitted the 1 tsp salt - seriously, with 1/4 cup of soy sauce, you don't need more salt.  Omitted bean sprouts (blegh).  Served over brown rice.  Will make again.

I thought this was great.  I made the sauce and marinated the chicken in it for a couple hours.  Then strained the sauce into a pan and reduced it until it was thicker.  I cooked the chicken in my wok, then mixed in frozen veggies and poured the sauce over it.  I let it simmer for a while and served over Jasmine rice.  I will definitely make this again!

i tried this recipe and it was pretty good.the sauce had a good tang to it from the orange,but the soy sauce adds a little more salt than i like in my stir-fry.if anyone tries it try adding less soy sauce than the recipe calls for.just my opinion.

The recipe was very very salty.. I had a hard time finishing it because it was so salty.  I would recommend cutting back on the soy sauce and salt.

This was a really excellent chicken recipe!  The strong orange and garlic flavors really permeated the chicken.  I served this dish with rice and broccoli and everyone raved about it.  I will probably use just the marinade for other recipes, even as a salad dressing!

Easy to prepare and tasted nice. I did coat the cubed chicken in some flour prior to stir-frying it. I also added a frozen bag of stir fry veggies when I added the sauce to the chicken. I cooked for about 4-5 minutes then thickened sauce with a little cornstarch and water.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did make some changes......1/2 of the chicken, added lots of colored peppers, celery, onion and carrott and 1 t. minced jalepeno pepper and plenty of mushrooms.  We omitted the bean sprouts and the chow mein noodles and served it over rice.  I will be making it again.

Tastes interesting and yummy. I would add some more of the orange juice to get that tang, though I made it without the zest, which might make up for that. Also toss in whatever veggies you want. I don't have or want a husband so I won't say if he liked it or not. I also do not have or eat children.

Yummy!  I skipped the salt and orange rind, and added red peppers, baby corn, pea pods and carrots.  Also used 1 Tsbp. corn starch instead of flour.  My husband and I loved it!  A great, healthy meal - and it looked very impressive!

I would have really loved this recipe given the fact that it would have put less salt.  I found the recipe extremely salty.  I would put less salt since there is 1/4 cup of soy sauce for future uses.

My hubby and I really loved this stir fry - I didn't take away any stars from the rating because I think it's all about the sauce!  The only change we made there was add some ground ginger, but I know it would have been just as good without it.  Instead of the bean sprouts and chow main noodles I used a bag of frozen stir fry veggie mix and brown rice - fabulous!

So easy to make! I used fresh orange juice (from juicer) but you can just store bought. I grated finely a tsp of ginger, freshly grated finely 1 Tbsp orange zest, and added 5 garlic cloves coarsely chopped. I first cooked the chicken thigh pieces (dipped in egg white, and then in corn flour mixed with garlic powder coating the chicken). keeps it more tender and moist and sauce sticks to the chicken better with this coating. 

Veg used: carrots, cauliflower, onion peas. Yum!

Next time: I might add a tsp of chili flakes for some heat!

This was absolutely DELICIOUS! I took a fresh orange from my fridge, and juiced it. But unfortunately, the orange juice ran out. So I decided to put 1/4 cup cranberry juice in to make up for the shortage of orange juice. This made it turn out amazing! I also used half the amount of salt called for, and put in 1 head of broccoli. DEFINITELY will make again! :)

EXCELLENT MEAL!!!! Absolutely amazing.  I went with suggestions from other users and skipped the orange zest and additional salt, added a small can of mandarin oranges and crushed pepper flakes and used green and red peppers instead of bean sprouts.  It was perfect.  The mandarins added an amazing sweetness, the pepper gave it the spiciness I love.  I will be making this again very soon!

I was looking forward to this recipe because my boys are crazy about Panda Express Orange Chicken.  Maybe I had excessive expectations because of prior reviews, but I was underwhelmed by this recipe.  So were my boys.  I made it exactly as described.  Something just wasn't great.  Sorry.

This was great!  I made as is, but with 1/2 the soy sauce and no added salt.  It had lots of flavor and my family liked it.  I added some frozen stir-fry veggies as well, and served with brown rice.

I made this mainly for the sauce since I used veggies I had on hand. I made the sauce as is, except omitted the orange zest and I added the flour to the mixture. I cooked the chunks of chicken first in the oil and then drained and set aside. Then I added my chopped veggies (diced onions, red and green bell pepper, carrots and celery) and when they were al dente, I added the garlic, cooked for a minute and added the juice mixture. It thickened nicely and then put the chicken back in. Reheated everything and poured over brown rice. We LOVED it.  You could put any veggies in it you want and it would be awesome. Thanks Kelly.

I was so upset with this! I was quite excited to make this for dinner last night. I love orange anything and everything. I was craving a stirfry and wanted something different. I looked at various recipes and reviews and chose this one. I followed the instructions and was suprememly disapointed. What a waste of time and ingredients. I had to load on the cayenne pepper to mask the flavour.

I loved this recipe! I did have to modify it a bit though. I breaded the chicken, added water chestnuts, ginger, and bell peppers, and to keep my breading crispy made the sauce seperate. I also added more orange juice as I had no zest to make it more orangey. Just had to cook down the sauce a bit more.

This orange chicken has EXCELLENT flavor, better than all but the best Chinese restaurants- and we are picky about our orange chicken! I would suggest making about double the sauce- if you want to eat it with rice or something the sauce runs a little short.

Loved this recipe! Thought the taste was wonderful and did not find the soy sauce overpowering like some of the reviews said. My friend suggested browning the chicken a little more or breading it. Also I used cornstarch like some reviewers said (1 tab) but I like a thicker sauce so I think next time I'll just add flour (I'm used to using flour, not corn starch) and just add more until it gets to my liking. The only other thing was that I used lemon zest instead of orange zest. It's what i had on hand and it tasted fine. :)

Winner Winner Chicken Dinner Added some frozen veggie oriental mix, a bit of onion, ginger, zested a whole orange and it was great.  This recipe is a keeper. Didn't bother to lessen the salt because the OJ was so sweet plus I added a lot of veggies and beansprouts so it worked out great without becoming bland. Oh and I used chicken thighs.

We loved this recipe! I thought the bean sprouts wasn't enough of a meal so I added red & green peppers, onions and shredded carrots to make a meal with rice! Also, we thought adding a few pineapples to the stir fry would have made a great taste! Enjoy!

This was a great recipe!  Made it for my roommate and some friends and all loved it.  It was a little salty so next time all cut back on the salt or use light soy sauce.  Also, I added green onions on top instead of bean sprouts.

My mom and I tried this recipe two weeks ago-it's excellent!  The chow mein noodles make an interesting addition to the dish.  We added more veggies when we made the stir fry- a can of baby corn, and about 3 or 4 cups of cooked broccoli.  The second time we made it, we added a tablespoon of cornstarch to the sauce instead of the flour, and it thickened very nicely.

I try out new recipies all the time living in a dorm room with three other guys.  So I look for easiness, few ingredience, and something that my roomates, who are very picky, will like.  Everyone agreed that I should make this at least once or twice a month, and a girl that my roomate had over was really impressed.

I thought this was a pretty good stir fry.  I left out the zest because I didn't want it to be too "orangy."  The juice gave it the flavor without it being overpowering.  I also added broccoli and water chestnuts and served it over rice.  My family liked it, except for my 2 year old.  I didn't think it was too salty, I actually added extra soy sauce to mine.  I also used cornstarch to thicken.

I found this to be a very refreshing change of pace.
I did add a litle whipping cream to thicken the broth and simmered down to my desired consistency.
I have only served to adults at this point therefore can not rate child acceptance.

This was delish!! Thank you!!!  I did leave out the salt and I like my chow mein with onions and celery, so I added 2 onions and 3 stalks of celery and a tablespoon of fresh minced ginger, and this was great!!!  This was fast and easy to prepare.  I would give this ten stars if I could.

Great base! I used no salt, added teriyaki, used 4 cloves of garlic, and skipped the zest. Also, instead of vegetable oil, I used sesame oil, and then added broccoli, carrots, white onion and mushroom. I also served it on a bed of rice instead of noodles.

I always use low sodium soy sauce, and I cut the salt in this recipe to 1/2 tsp. or less.  Otherwise really simple to make.  I added a package of stir fry veggies from the produce department (worth the expense to me for the convenience), to the chicken once it was cooked.

This was really bad.   I'm glad I didn't put in the chicken I got at Whole Foods.   I added some freshly grated ginger as someone else recommended.  I sauteed brocolli and the mung beans - it was completely inedible.

Great! Easy to make, might've been even better had I felt up to zesting an orange and had bean sprouts on hand.  We used broccoli and green pepper instead, and I added a little ginger since that's often in orange chicken.

The sauce for this is great!  I made a few changes that turned out great. For vegetables I added broccoli, green beans and green peppers.  I didn't have any bean spouts, so skipped them.

This was very good, and I made some additions. I added roasted veggies (onion, bell pepper, and carrot slices) and a bit of fresh diced mango at the end. The orange flavor was not as strong as I thought it would be when it was cooking, but it still had a nice taste, almost like teriyaki. I served it over brown rice. Everyone seemed to like it!

Very good recipe!  I didn't have any orange juice, so I squeezed three oranges.  I used about half of the lemon zest (I forgot to grate the orange peels before they went into the garbage disposal.)  I did not have any bean sprouts, so I substituted broccoli.  I also added yellow peppers and onions to the dish at the end.  It was great!  I will be making this again.  Next time, I will add pineapple as well.  Very versatile dish.

Great Recipe!  The sauce was one of the best I have made for a stir fry.  I didn't have orange zest.  I stir-fryed broccoli, mushroom, and sliced carrot in sesame oil over high heat for about 2-3 minutes.  I took the vegies out of the pan followed the rest of  the recipe directions adding the vegetables with the chicken at the end.  With the added vegies I would make more sauce.  I also made white rice to go with the meal instead of noodles.  Delicious!  Next time I'm going to cook more vegies, more sauce, and less chicken.

Well that was delicious!!!  I had 3 lbs of chicken to get rid of and I was TIRED of chicken.  This was refreshing and tasty! I tripled the recipe to account for all of my chicken and the 5 adults I was feeding.  I grated maybe 1 TBSPN of zest, I juiced 7 oranges, cut out the salt, used low sodium soy sauce and 5 TBSPN of cornstarch to replace the flour.  Served over rice, it was perfect!! I did not have bean sprouts, but they would add a delicious crunch.

Good dish -- skipped the bean sprouts and chow mein noodles, decreased soy sauce to about 1/5 cup, and added bell peppers and onions.  Served with brown rice.

Very simple, quick, and delicious meal!  I added a bag of frozen oriental veggies, a can of baby corn, and a can of mushrooms.   The orange flavor was good and not too overpowering.  Served over rice.  Will definitely make again!

this was an awesome dish! easy and delicious. i made a few minor adjustments. soy souce has a high content of sodium so i substituted it with oyster sauce and instead of using orange juice i used the mandarin orange juice and crushed the mandarin oranges into the mix. and i fried the chicken in pure sesame oil to give it a little taste also adding in garlic, ginger root, and sweet red peppers, mushrooms and green onions! served on hot sticky rice! fast and easy. the sauce was PERFECT! add a lil coarse pepper and you are set!

Ended up tasting good, but it needed a lot of tweaking.  I ended up adding in grated fresh ginger, twice the garlic, a splash of wine, and finally two tablespoons sugar which made it into a yummy orange sweet-and-sour kind of sauce. Delicious!  Added half a diced sweet red pepper and about four cups of chopped-up broccoli.  If anything I would add more vegetables next time, there was still a lot of chicken.

Very Good, my only complaint was there wasn't enough!  I added a little ginger to the sauce, just because I love it. I also used fresh noodles that I pan fried, because that was what I had.

It was just okay. There is something about orange juice and soy sauce that just sets me the wrong way. I found it better to add some cayenne to the sauce mix and I served it with garlic chili sauce on the side at the table.

I thought this was quite good and not very difficult to make.  I did not use any orange zest or salt.  In addition, I used corn starch instead of flour, added a bag of steam fresh asian veggies, and used spaghetti noodles.  Even my 7 year old son likes it.

This was very good but without these adjustments it's not as filling or as good. I used half the chicken, but added a cup of combined shredded carrots and broccoli. I also doubled the sauce otherwise their wouldn't have been enough for the 4 of us. I served on top of rice instead of noodles and it tasted better. With these additions it was very good and even my picky daughter enjoyed it.

This was pretty good but, of course, I changed it for our tastes.  I added 1 tblsp ginger paste, 1 tsp red pepper flakes and I forgot to buy fresh garlic at the store so I used 1-2 tsp garlic powder.  I did add the 1 tsp salt but would omit that next time as it was just a squeak too salty for us.  I topped this over rice noodles with honey roasted peanuts and coconut flakes.  Very Good!

This was quite good. I added strips of red pepper in the sauce, no sprouts no noodles only because I didn't bother to go to the store for them. Served it over Jasmine rice, will make it again. Thanks

I agree with many of the other reviewers, a quick and easy dish, the only draw back is it's a little too salty.  Next time I'll cut the salt in half and add some veggies.

I loved the recipe! The only thing that I didn't like was that it was a bit too salty. I'd reduce the soy sauce. And I added sliced carrots and scallions into the sauce mix. After the chicken was cooked with the sauce mix, I also added in a few boiled broccoli. With a few sprinkle of grated ginger, it came out perfect! Reduce the amount of oil when cooking the chicken since it's too much. Ended up using all the flour to thicken and topped everything on white fluffy rice =]

This dinner was VERY easy to make.  I halved the chicken to have double the sauce to serve over rice instead of the chow mein noodles to lessen the fat content of the dish.  I also used fresh squeezed orange juice (I didn't want my orange to go to waste after zesting it) for a quarter cup and regular OJ for the remaining 3/4.  I ended up using all the flour as well to get to the desired thickness of the sauce - and used a whisk instead of the spoon I had been using.  It was easy and perfect.

I made this at the last minute one night. I added fresh chopped onion and red bell pepper to the oil before the meat, and added a can of chunked pineapple to the orange sauce mixture. I have 3 boys and one of whom is VERY picky...he asked if we can have this orange chick every Monday! It was a hit in this house!
I used a box of instant fried rice instead of chow mein noodles and it was just as good as any asian place around here! Thanks!!

I made this dish, but with a little twist of my own. I added a half stalk of celery (chopped up) for every piece of chicken used, and also added a handful of cashews, and served over a bed of white rice...it was outstanding.

I thought this recipe was great! I did use some left over pork from a cranberry-orange flavored roast that I had instead of the chicken. I might add just a touch less garlic next time.

I was really surprised at how little of the orange flavor came through on this. I used fresh orange juice. If I make this again maybe I will try it with concentrate o.j. instead. It is good though and the chicken is nice and moist, so I will still give it four stars.  I used 1 tablespoon of cornstarch instead of the flour, because I like the results of cornstarch better in my clear sauces.

I did not like the taste of the sauce at all. I believe it needs less soy sauce and the cup of orange  juice was too acidity for me. I won't make this again but for people who like an zang taste for your chicken, you will like it.

Everyone in my family thought this was way too salty. And I love salt, but it had way too much. I will try it again some time, because I think with less salt it could be a very good dish. Thanks any way.

I was disappointed in this recipe after reading all the rave reviews.  It was just okay.  Not enough orange flavor for me.  Probably won't make it again.

Great dish.  Made with fried rice.  One person said it had too much orange flavor another person said it needed more orange flavor. I like the strong orange flavor it is after all orange chicken.  I added Chinese pea pods.  I could not find the sprouts.  It was a nice color and added some extra crunch.

I didn't add salt, enough in the soy sauce, and I halved the soy sauce and used more orange juice. I don't care for a lot of soy sauce. I also used corn starch instead of flour, just because it's easier for me. This tasted GREAT. I love stir fries and had some fresh oranges on hand. I will make this over and over.

Good overall. Went over well with the family. I was expecting a more prominent orange taste but this dish is light and subtle. 
I will try again with a few added tweaks.

I made the sauce first, following the recipe exaclty and it was AWFUL,I tasted it before cooking it first. The soy sauce and sugar completely destroyed the flavour of the oranges and adding extra salt is ridiculous seeing as soy sauce is so salty anyways, so I made it again, using the required orange juice , no peel, I used 1 inch of ginger instead , finely grated , which really complemented the orange, added NO salt , 1 tsp of brown sugar and a 1/8 cup of soy sauce , delicious :) def worth making but with serious adjustments .

I followed the recipe but used 1/2 c OJ and 2 minneolas squeezed to make 1 cup of OJ. I did not use any sprouts or noodles but served with rice.  I also threw in chopped broccoli when the sauce boiled and covered for about 3 minutes.  I think leaving out the salt would be fine but it didn't taste too salty.

Very good!  Add 1/8tsp ginger to orange juice sauce mixture.  Did not use bean sprouts or chow mein noodles. Made with fresh julianne carrots, sweet red pepper, and brocolli steamed prior to adding to cooked chicken. I added crushed red pepper to my serving for extra spice and flavor. Served over rice. Great tasting healthy meal and easy to prepare.

Tasty recipe.  I doubled the sauce (but kept the salt at the regular amount).  I also substituted the chow mein noodles and used brown rice instead.  I didn't have orange zest so I skipped it.  I added fresh zucchini, red peppers, and green peppers.  First, I sauted olive oil, 1 tsp. minced ginger, and the onions for about 3-5 minutes in a hot pan.  Next I added the chicken and cooked for about 5 minutes.  Afterwards, I added the sauce and some cornstarch instead of the flour.  I added a little more brown sugar to taste. Serve with brown rice and presto: delicious dinner. : )

This is wonderful. The only change I made was to add 1/2 tsp fresh grated ginger. After the chicken was done and the sauce boiling, I added about half of the flour and stirred until thick. Then I tossed in 1/2 of a medium sized green pepper, sliced thin, and quickly stir-fried it for one minute. Served it over sticky rice. NO LEFTOVERS.

This made a YUMMY dinner...even better than take-out! I used fresh squeezed orange juice, which really gave the chicken nice flavor.  I steamed broccoli and baby carrots while the chicken cooked, and added it at the end (instead of bean sprouts).

This is agreat recipe, even when you forget to add some things to it like I did. I forgot the garlic, brown sugar, salt, zest and bean sprouts.(did not need the salt) I did add sliced carrots and sweet bell pepper. Pineapple chunks with the chicken and the sauce would have been great too. This is a recipe you just can't go wrong with. I served this over Basmatic Rice.

Very tasty sauce that takes 2 minutes to make. I didn't have bean sprouts or chow mein noodles, but I did toss the chicken with frozen green beans, sliced green and red pepper and some orzo. It was delicious!

Superb! We thickened ours with cornstarch (not sure how much, just kept adding 1/2 teaspoons at a time until we got it how we wanted it) and just used soy sauce and orange juice for the sauce.

It was a little "orangey" for me so I am adding extra sugar and some cayanne to it. I also left out the lemon zest and used cornstarch instead of flour. Really liked it but am trying to love it.

I made this exactly as written and did not care for it.  I really wanted to like it because it sounded delicious and it was rated so highly.  I didn't think the sauce was sweet enough to counter the soy sauce taste.

lacked flavor.  even after making it and adding extra zest, freshly grated ginger, the fresh juice from the zested orange,green and yellow sqash, mushrooms, chives, and bean sporuts.  I couldnt imagine this with out teh additions.  I also marinated the chicken in the sauce before i cooked it.  this helped to keep some of the flavor.

Yummy! I nixed a tablespoon of the oil, used 1/4 less o.j. and soy sauce (less sugar and salt) and used splenda blend brown sugar for a lighter option. Also threw in some toasted sesame seeds for extra flavor. Really good!

I'm rating this 4 stars because I made a few adjustments based on other reviewers' comments.  First of all, I did not add any salt.  However I did add 1 tablespoon pineapple juice and 1/2 teaspoon ginger powder to the sauce.  When the chicken was almost done cooking, I added a bag of frozen veggies, a little green onion, sesame seeds, almonds, and water chestnuts.  It turned out delish, I would not change a thing!

Little too salty.I'd cut the soy sauce back some. It also needs a little kick. I added 1/4 t.red pepper flakes and 1 t.orange marmalade also some broccoli, water chestnuts and some green onion sliced to 1/2 inch pieces.

This was a super easy recipe to follow and I had all the ingredients on hand. I added an onion while cooking the chicken and at the very end I added a small package of snow peas. This dish along with a side of rice was quick and filling for the whole family.

I made this tonight for my fiancee and I and we both really liked it (I opted to use the sprouts in it). It seemed a little odd to serve it over chow mein noodles, though it was still tasty. Next time I make it I'll probably serve it over white rice with the chow mein noodles sprinkled on top.

I made as directed except for I added 1 tablespoon cornstarch to the cold mixture before adding to the chicken and omited the flour. I also added an entire large green pepper and some small yellow and red peppers to the sauted chicken when it was almost finished right before adding the soy mixture. For the Soy sauce mixture I used lower sodium, used honey and a pinch of brown sugar. It turned out really good and I will make it again, and maybe mix it up again next time. I agree with the other reviewers who said it was a base recipe that you can "spice" up on your own

My family LOVES this recipe!  I've tweaked it a bit to match our needs.  Instead of brown sugar I use sucanat.  I also add fresh ginger root.  When sauteeing the chicken try to add extra fresh garlic and ginger to the chicken, it flavors it better!  If you've not tried it before, use your kitchen shears to cut the chicken...you'll never use your knife for cutting chicken again!!  Also, when adding the orange sauce add fresh veggies like carrots, broccoli, sugar peas, etc.  My boys especially like it when I add waterchestnuts and baby corn!  If you steam your rice (we like jasmine) while you're doing the stir fry it only takes about 35 minutes total time to cook it!

Pretty yummy.  You can really taste the orange in this recipe.  Overall, I thought it was good, but perhaps not my favorite orange chicken recipe.

Delicious! We used low sodium soy sauce, and I'm sure that cut down the salty flavor others have mentioned. Could probably use some other sort of vegetable on the side or mixed in.

I marinated beef strips in the soy sauce and a splash of OJ.  I followed the rest of the recipe, but with less salt.  I added snap peas and cashews instead of sprouts!!  I also just added a pinch of flour.  I served this warm over thin asian noodels.  My family loved it!  I will make this again!

You, my friend, are excellent.

I have never had an orange-flavored stir-fry, and it is fantastic.  Not that it's relevant to anyone else, but I could get find all of these ingredients in rural China, so I'd say it's at least somewhat authentic.  Due to the aforementioned ingredient difficulty, I substituted white sugar for brown and a tablespoon of rice flour for two tablespoons of all-purpose flour. I was forced to substitute fish for chicken, which produced interesting and delicious results, but I think it would have been better if I had chicken and wheat flour readily availible.  Still, definitely the best thing I've ever cooked in a wok.

I didn't have crispy chow mein noodles, but that seems to be more of an accent than anything else.  White rice worked well in its stead.

I created a login name on allrecipes just to get on and say how awesome this recipe is! I just got a new wok, and I wanted to try to make chinese food - I've always loved chinese food.  This little white girl made some dern good orange chicken! I live in a dorm, and several people came and ate it, it was awesome stuff.  I threw in some bamboo, water chestnuts, peas, carrots and broccoli, as well as just a little ginger and nutmeg in the sauce.  If you add lots of vegetables, you might want to double or 1.5 the sauce.  This is an awesome recipe! You know how chinese food leftovers smell so unique the next day? This smells like that! I'm eating leftovers for breakfast right now.  Yay orange chicken! Thanks Kelly.

By the way, if you want to try something different from rice, run to the asian supermarket and pick up some Japanese somen noodles, they're thin short wheat flour noodles, a big packet of them is 60 cents.  Throw some soy sauce in the water you're cooking them in when you get started, and a little oil to help prevent sticking.  These noodles are good man!

This is a great recipe that I will make again for sure. I did add lots of extra orange zest which I think made a big difference. In the future I will probably add more ingredients to it. I think it will try adding mushrooms, cilantro, and green onions next time. It tasted good but I felt like it could be improved upon with more ingredients.

This is excellent!!!  I didn't really do a quick stir-fry, I let my chicken simmer in the sauce.  Thickened it to a nice glaze, threw some chow mein noodles on a platter and poured the chicken and sauce on top!!!!  Very nice presentation, and very tasty too!  Fiance suggested serving with rice next time, which I think I'm going to do!  Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe, Kelly!

This was okay...not the best I've had...lacking in a little flavor.  I added veggies and cut back on the soy sauce, but it could have used a little extra seasoning of some sort.  I'm not sure if I'll make it again.

My boyfriend and I love it. We made some changes to it, and it was really good. We substituted broccoli and peas instead of the bean sprouts and used less salt in it. Next time we are gonna make more of the sauce to put over the rice. I can't wait to make it again.

I changed a few things. After the notes by others that it was salty, I skipped the salt, used low sodium soy sauce (1/4 cup), added 1/8 cup teriyaki sauce, two cloves of grated garlic and some crushed red pepper flakes. Instead of adding a thickener, I allowed the sauce to cook down on its own (about 10 minutes) with 1/2 cup cashews which infused the flavors into the chicken. I served it over a bed of brown rice with edamame.

This is a nice recipe.  I mixed the sauce up in the morning and just put it in the fridge.  I cooked the meat in a wok and added the sauce.  I then transferred it to a skillet so I could use the wok to make fried rice.  I omitted the salt because the soy sauce is salty enough for us, but did add the optional bean sprouts.  Right before serving, I added a little Wondra® to thicken the sauce, rather than flour.  Served this over 'Fried Rice II' from AR and spring rolls.

Really great recipe - I used freshly squeezed juice from blood oranges and it turned out even better.  Simple ingredients that really yielded a delicious and healthy dinner.  I also used the same amount of sauce with only 2 chicken breasts so that we had more sauce to enjoy with rice.  Highly recommend - it was really easy and I had all of the ingredients at home to make it.  Next time I think I'll try the chow mein noodles.

I thought this recipe was a good basic for a healthy version because the chicken was not fried.  However, I would suggest adding a heated spice like Chili sauce for more of a punch.  I also substituted corn starch instead of flour.

I made this last week, and I ended up putting too much orange zest but it still turned out good. I used rice vermicelli noodles, next time I will try it with less zest (because I did the whole orange Oops) I also added some steamed  veggies in it and chow noodles.

This will make a good base, but as it stands it's kind of meh. I didn't have an orange, so I left out the orange zest, but otherwise made the sauce as stated. For my taste, the result was too sweet and lacking some zing. Next time, I'll probably cut the brown sugar in half, use less orange juice, and add some red pepper flakes, maybe ginger too.

Great recipe! Soooo delicious!  Used green pepper and pineapple chunks instead of bean sprouts...they are listed as optional anyway.  If you like bean sprouts, then I'm sure it would still be 5 stars.  Also, I used pineapple juice from the can of pineapple instead of orange juice, but I still think it would've been 5 stars with OJ!  Did everything else according to the recipe.  Think it would be great over rice and garnished with cashews. Oh, I almost forgot...reduced salt content to 1/2 teaspoon.  Kept everything the same, even the zest.  That's all the changes, I swear! ;-)

I made this a while ago and hadn't seen it until it popped up in my in box. I always  make this with cubed boneless, skinless chicken thighs  instead of chicken breasts because they're tender, moist and flavorful--never dry. I occasionally add a bit of powdered ginger to this recipe; if I think ahead, I chop up candied ginger in small pieces--about a tablespoon--and add that. It makes it really yummy! I have also chopped up about 3 tablespoons of dried apricots and added it to this, along with the candied ginger and the flavor was really enhanced by it.

My husband LOVED this.  He said it is on par with any restaurant orange chicken.  I am giving this recipe 5 stars because if I made it as written, it would be great.  However, I did slightly modify the recipe for my own preference.  As some other readers, I added a bag of stir fry veggies at the same time that I added the sauce.  I used corn starch instead of flour for thickening, and I took some readers advice and omitted the salt.  This was a GRAVE mistake.  Even though we tried the sauce beforehand, we found that the sauce lacked salt when we sat down to eat.  In our own bowls we added more soy sauce to add salt and to cut some of the sweetness.  My husband also added siracha as he loves heat.  We will definitely make this again but with more soy sauce.

With a few tweaks this recipe is fantastic! After reading a few reviews and following my own taste I decided to omit the salt as suggested and am happy I did. I also added 1/2 tsp of ground ginger and 1/8 of a tsp of red pepper flakes, and coated the pieces of chicken with corn starch before frying. This recipe is easily tailored to your specific taste, which always makes a great recipe. I used my own combo of veggies too, broccoli, a julienne of carrots and cabbage, snow peas, and yellow bell pepper all served over a bed of brown rice. My husband said it was better than take out!
**** note: I did not need to add flour since I coated the chicken pieces in corn starch before cooking them. If I wanted it to be thicker I would have used more corn starch, not flour.

I enjoyed this quite a bit, but the sauce was a bit strong and I didn't care for the amount of soy sauce.  For what it's worth, I fixed it for guests and they seemed more pleased with it than I was, so maybe it's just me.

Great recipe! I doubled the sauce mix and used corn starch instead of flour. I also added a bag of frozen stir fry veggie mix to add some green. Great served over rice! My picky boyfriend really enjoyed this dish!

Used juice of 2 oranges, some papaya juice and the juice from mandarin oranges (is all I had). Put remainder of juice in container with flour and shake to combine then added at end with sliced celery, carrots, onions and also tenderized chicken then cut in strips added toasted whole almonds. Easy.

I had high hopes and was let down. It was missing something. I used sesame oil instead of veg., and added green onions. I thought it could have only made it better. I served with basmati rice instead of the noodles. Maybe adding ginger is the key - I meant to and forgot and it did seem like it would have helped. Anyway, I will not try again.

This recipe is delicious! It's very simple to customize it any way you want. I used steak cubes, red and green pepper, garlic powder, teriyaki sauce, pineapple, carrot, celery, there's probably more ingredients, i just can't remember them all.. great recipe, i highly reccomend it!

I omitted the orange zest as I usually tend to do in recipes, but I think it caused this dish to lack something...The chicken was tasty and moist but tasted only mildly of orange. Next time I'll add the zest and may come back to rate this 5 stars.

Strong orange flavor, and hubby didn't care for that. I personally loved it but he wouldn't eat it. The only change I made was not putting in the orange zest as I didn't have any on hand. Plus I used olive oil insted of veg. oil to saute the chicken. To bad he didn't enjoy it because I would've made this again.

I added yellow onion to this stir fry and used red pepper instead of bean sprouts to add color.  And since I was serving this over rice, I made twice as much sauce (as I usually do with stir fry recipes).  It was tasty enough to be a keeper recipe to make again - but next time with the chow mein noodles!

My boyfriend selected and made this one... He added veggies (and mushrooms) and a splash of riesling. I loved it, but I think it would be even better with a bit of spicy-ness to it!

Pretty good. Didn't have bean sprouts on hand, but it still turned out orange-y. I'm sure having the bean sprouts would have helped the liquid not seem so...juicy. I added the 2 T. flour and it thickened, but certainly not the way you think of from a Chinese take-out. I served on top of fried rice, and it turned out pretty good.

I've made this several times and even served it to guests with great reviews.  I reduced the amount of soy sauce as others had recommended.  One time I did do it exactly as listed and there was too much soy sauce.  Now when I make it I use only 1/2 as much soy sauce.  I also double the garlic and add chopped green onions at the very end of cooking.  I also doubled the brown sugar and did away with the flour.  I just cooked the sauce a while until it reduced a little and thickened up on it's own.  Then I threw in the chicken again.  Very, very good!

Great Recipe!! My son loved it and ate all the left-over's that where going to be my lunch.  As mentioned in other reviews, be ready for a strong ogange flavor. I followed the recipe exactly, except for one thing. I added the flour first for about two minutes to make a roux. I then added the orange mixture and brought it to a boil. The sauce thickened up great and I served it over steamed rice.

I really liked this chicken and sauce.  I served it with rice and Costco stir-fry. I accidently used pineapple-orange juice but it was still great.  I will try it with orange next time.  I thought the citrus flavor was a good change up from other stirfrys.  While this won't be a weekly recipe I will definitely make it again. I'd like to experiment with adding onions and ginger.

Eh...I didn't like the flavor very much.  As described by my husband, the sauce had a strange flavor.  I added flour and corn starch to thicken but it was still pretty thin.  Disappointing!

Hate to be the opposition here but I didn't like this at all. Too orangey sweet, which may be the point, not sure, but not my taste. I've made a lot of orange juice based recipes and this one was one of the lesser.

This was very good! Make sure your not expecting it to taste like the big chain restaurant's orange chicken.  This much different, but very tasty and satisfying. I cooked the chicken in much less oil and served it over basmati rice.

Especially good the 2nd day.  I like the sauce a little thicker, so used about half flour/half corn starch to thicken.  Also marinated the meat in soy sauce for a while before cooking and used only 1/4t of salt.  Didn't have orange zest or fresh juice, but it turned out fine with partially-diluted orange juice concentrate. Thanks!

We loved it!!!  Very quick and easy to make.  The orange flavor is very strong but we loved it.  I will definetely make again.  Next time will add a bit of cayenne pepper as we like it hot.  Also will add some vegi's.  We used reduced sodium soy sauce and left out the teaspoon of salt.

I wasn't thrilled with it because I tasted all of the individual flavors instead of just one flavor. All five of my kids ate it though,even my oh so picky self-proclaimed " I hate chicken" 15 year old.So maybe it was just me.I like that fact that it isn't breaded.I would only make it again if my children asked me too.I topped mine with chopped almonds and omitted the chow mein noodles...the almonds added a tastier flavor.

This was a flavorful and tasty dish.  I did without the chow mein and stirred in noodles.  Next time I make this I would recommend placing the chicken on top of a veg stir fry using the same sause as its base.

GOOD QUICK and EASY my favoite words when it comes to cooking. I cooked this dish for four 5 year olds and they devoured it and had seconds. I serverd it over rice. It could have used some spicing up and some veggies but we loved it just the same. It took no time at all to prepare even with 4 kids running around the house. We will make this again.

I found this recipe way too salty.  If I made again I would delete the extra teaspoon of salt and increase the brown sugar.  We like it alittle sweeter.  The chow main noodles were a fun touch.

This was OK.  I didn't like the taste of the sauce very much. Maybe needed more salt, or some sweet chili sauce.  The stir fry could have used more vegetables, maybe onion, red pepper and snow peas.  Plain rice would have been nicer than the chow mein.

Well, I halved all the ingredients in this recipe except for the brown sugar, it was pretty good.  I also added about 1 tsp of chili flakes and instead of the flour (I don't like the taste of uncooked flour), I mixed about 1 tsp of cornstarch with 2 tbsp (approx) of orange juice and whisked that into the sauce - was quite good.  My DH enjoyed it more than I (I would have rated 3 stars), so we went with 4 :)

this recipe was not very good and i do not recommend it. it has a very strong soy sauce flavor. i was looking for something that tastes more like the resturant. thats ok though, it was fun to experiment with and i ended up finding an excellent recipe on this website for general taos chicken, which tastes so much better!

We had oranges left over from Christmas so I looked for a recipe with orange juice and chicken. I added fresh ginger and doubled the liquid, I left the sprouts out. The flavor was wonderful, the only complaint was the sauce was a little thin. Also served it with rice instead of chow mein.

I couldn't believe when I saw the bad reviews this recipe got!  The only thing that makes sense is that those people didn't make it right.  The orange zest added just the right amount of zing.  I cooked some red peppers with the chicken and that made the texture better.  I also decided next time I'd add cashews.  My husband said this was definitely a keeper (I've tried some online recipes that were not) and he can't wait to have it again!  And it was so easy.  I didn't even have to go to the store to get any special ingredients.

I perfer my old standby stirfry compared to this. I even added other ingredients to this but still won't make again. I added red pepper flakes, fresh grated ginger, lots of stir fry veggies (mushrooms, bean sprouts, brocolli etc). If you want a really good orange stirfry recipe try "Crispy Orange Beef" subimitted by BEC. It is absolutely FANTASTIC.

Delicious! I live in Japan in the middle of nowhere and couldn't get a hold of chow mein noodles, but it was just as good served over plain rice.  I added a bit of ginger to the sauce and a little more garlic, I also tossed the chicken in flour before frying to make it a little crisp on the outside.  Reminded me of the Orange chicken I used to get at the Chinese restaurants back home.  This will definitely be a regular on our table.

I used the sauce as a base recipe and added a few extra things - lemon pepper, red pepper flakes, a bit more garlic, some ginger, etc. It was incredible! This made incredibly tasty orange chicken. Thanks so much for the recipe!

This is really easy to prepare.  We added cut pineapple and served it over a bed of rice.  So many dishes miss out on the flavor.  This one kept its strong orange flavor.  Will become a regular in our house.

My boyfriend and I both made this dish together.  He is a huge orange chicken fan and always orders it when we go to a Chinese restaurant.  I on the other hand am not very fond of orange chicken but I gave this recipe a try.  We did not have a tool for grating the orange zest off of the orange peel, so we were unable to use any zest when preparing this.  I have a strong feeling that the orange zest would have added a much stronger orange flavor to the dish.  I visited my mom later on and she showed me her tool for grating orange zest and showed me how to use it and told me that this is where all the orange flavor is because its where the flavorful oils are.  All of us could smell the orange scent that was coming out when she was grating the orange peel.  When we make this recipe in the future, we will make sure we use the orange zest and will probably use an extra amount of it.  The recipe is overall good, but I'm sure there is something that can make it better.

The sauce for this recipe was nice.  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts.  Now all I need to do is find a recipe that includes coating for the chicken (like in restaurants).

This was a disapointment, the chicken was quite bland and yet overwhelming with orange flavor at the same time. I think I will keep searching.

Might make it again but would omit the zest and maybe cut the juice back by adding chicken broth. Everyone felt it was too much orange and the zest gave it a slightly bitter taste.

I made it with shredded carrots and broccoli instead of beans sprouts. I hand squeezed the juice. The sauce was less sweet than restaurant or store bought sauces. Everyone preferred it!

At first it felt strange mixing soy sauce and orange juice together as I haven't used oranges in cooking before. But it turned out really good! Instead of bean sprouts I just added a can of chow mein vegetables p, that had bean sprouts in them. I also added a little green pepper and served it over some generic instant noodles.

After reading other reviews I made the sauce exactly as the recipe stated. The change I made was to add stir fry veggies and serve with rice. I did not use the bean sprouts or chow mein noodles as my family prefers rice. It was really yummy!

Made this as per the recipe. Was awesome and everyone in the family enjoyed it. If you aren't a huge fan of Soy you could reduce it a little. I suggest making it as per this recipe. Then making any minor adjustments to your taste. You won't be disappointed.

I was excited about making this recipe and got so much disappointment. Taste was SO orange-y.

Everyone loved this dish. I lightly floured the chicken and cooked separately. Stir fried frozen vegetables and cooked sauce in pan then combined everything. Served on rice. Kids devoured it.

Very salty. I only added half the recommended salt but it was still mouth-burningly salty.  If I did this recipe again, I would add more orange juice, much less soy sauce, and no extra salt.

We found this a little bland, but I didn't add the salt. Next time will add something to heat it up a little - maybe some red pepper flakes.

I decided to try this recipe last night, a little change from my regular stir fry where I only use soy sauce.  Followed the recipe but used low sodium soy sauce and omitted the salt.  I added frozen mixed veggies in and I think next time I will use fresh as the water in them did water down the sauce which had a real fresh taste.  Put it on rice.  My daughter saw me add the orange juice and said mom why did you do that.  When she tried it she actually liked it.  I told her from now on she is out of the kitchen when I cook so she doesn't know what is in it...

I would rate this 5 stars, except we didn't follow it exactly.   I didn't have orange zest or fresh garlic, so I omitted the zest, and used 3/8 tsp. of garlic powder.  I used coconut oil as well because it is healthier.  I added 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes for some heat, and they gave the perfect touch!  We loved the flavors, but it tasted nothing like the restaurant Fried Orange Chicken that we love.  Nice and quick, though, and delicious served over rice!  Next time I will use less soy sauce, and omit the salt, because the end product was quite salty.   Overall, and good recipe that I plan on making again!

Very easy to make, very delicious to eat! The only change I made was I used the cornstarch slurry that was suggested in the video rather than using flour to thicken. I will definitely make this recipe again and again!

Too much soy sauce and not enough orange.  I added more B.Sugar to try to counteract the soy.  Would not make it again.

Great! For a healthy orange chicken this rocked! No bottled sauce mixtures needed. I added tablespoon of Penzey's orange peel (likes dried zest). After I put the sauce in the pan with chicken I added chopped baby carrots & snow peas then put lid on. After about 5 mins the sauce had thickened slightly and the veggies were crisp tender. Served it all over jasmine rice & sprinkle with chopped scallion & sesame seeds. Will make this again!!

I used the sauce ingredients as a base for my own stir fry.  I omitted chicken breast, flour, and bean sprouts.  I added some grated ginger into the sauce and marinated tofu for 1 hour.  Save the marinating sauce, and fry just the tofu.  While frying the tofu i chopped all the fresh vegies:  4 medium carrots, 2 stalks celery, 1/2 leek including green parts, 1/2 red pepper.  When the tofu is done, transfer it back into marinade and fry vegies until desired crispness.  Add 3 TB cornstarch into marinade and stir marinade, tofu, 1 small can mandarine oranges including liquid, and 1 small can of water chestnuts drained into frying pan along with vegies.  Bring to boil for 2 minutes to thicken sauce, and serve over rice.  I think the leeks were a must to give this stir fry a special flavor!  I think the ratios given for the sauce were delicious and will follow them again.

I was so disappointed. It may have been my fault or it may have been the recipe's fault but it was WAY too salty. I do want to try it again and try to take out the heavy salt flavor. I could taste the orange flavor but the slt overpowered it it ws hard to enjoy. I will give it another try someday.

Made this recipe as written except for the orange zest and used low-sodium soy sauce.  For first taste test, it was way too orangy and tart.  I added another tablespoon of brown sugar, which helped a little.  I left it that way and served it.  While I was eating it, determined it was way too salty even with the low-sodium soy sauce. If I make it again, will omit the salt and cut the orange juice to 1/2 cup.  The overall recipe needs tweaking.

It simply isn't very good.  The soy sauce overpowers the recipe which is bland otherwise.  There are other Orange Chicken Stir Fry recipes on this site that are much better.

As the recipe is written we gave it 4 stars.  We thought the color (visual) appeal was boring and the flavor was good, but not fantastic.   

However, once in our bowls we added a little bit, maybe 1/2 t of Thai sweet chili sauce.   That made it 5 stars.   It brought out the orange flavor and gave it a bit of kick.

We also served it over brown rice and used the crunchy noodles as a garnishment.

Delicious! We gobbled it up. Just a couple of adjustments. I added cornstarch mixed in cold water to thicken it instead of flour. I didn't use bean sprouts, can't stand them. I also added cashews, that made it great! Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious and so easy to make. I served it over white rice rather than over the chow mein noodles and I omitted the sprouts. This will be one of my go-to recipes from now on. My two year old said he loved it and that is a big deal since he doesn't eat much!

Too salty and too much orange flavor. There was also something else a little off about this recipe, but I can't quite put my finger on it. Probably won't try again.

Used dark meat, added hot pepper, 1/2 the juice, and no salt. Good meal.

Loved the recipe, but thought was missing something so I added some Sambal Olelek and it was awesome!  The heat was a great counterpoint to the sweetness.  Also cut the orange used for zest and added to stir fry.  Threw in some extra firm tofu and left out the crispy chow mein noodles.

I followed the recipe and agree with a lot of other reviewers, way too salty and too much soy sauce. I did like the orange flavor that came through. I ate a serving and threw the rest away. If I make it again I will not add add any salt and use only a 1/4 of the soy sauce (or less). I think adding chunks of pineapple sounds good. The crispy noodles got soggy real fast so next time will be with brown rice (healthier) and no bean sprouts which were limp as well. Stir fry veggies and pineapple. I know this changes it a lot but it just was not good as is.

I made a vegetarian version of this using Quorn "Tenders" (beleive me, the Tenders aren't the problem with this recipe, I use them all the time.) I left out the salt, the soy sauce already makes this salty. I added a package of frozen organic broccoli flowerets. Adding the flour to the mixture in this manner doesn't work, it lumps. It would be better to mix the flour with the oj, or coat the "chicken" with it. We ate it for dinner, but not the leftovers (something that never happens at my house.)

So-so. Definitely don't add the tsp of salt though. Needs the color of the mixed veggies to give it a little zip - it's very bland looking otherwise.! I was hoping it would have the orange "glaze" type sauce but it definitely wasn't that.

Love this and so did my husband.  I added baby corn and snow peas.  I put it over chow mein noodles and hubby put it over rice.  I don't cook with salt and I use reduced sodium soya, still tasted lovely.  I like the zest from the orange.

I used this recipe for the sauce ingredients. I added a couple teaspoons of chili paste with garlic (Lan Chi brand) because everybody in our house wants some spice in their stir fry, and the orange flavor still came out. It smoothed out the chili paste and gave the whole dish a delicious richness. I'll be using this again. I did omit the salt. Sprouts sound like a perfect addition and next time I'll have them on hand as well as the other vegetables I used (broccoli, celery, red bell pepper and mushrooms). Thanks for a versatile recipe.

Not being a fan of soy sauce I should have cut the soy down to maybe 2 tbsp. I found it to be too much and made the dish salty. however it was still good. I will try it again with less soy sauce.

Making it tonight, the sauce is so nice!  I didn't add the extra salt as with the soy (I use Ketjap Manis) and the lovely orange flavour, no extra salt was needed.  I also did not use the Chinese noodles, instead made some white rice to serve it over and I added the bean sprouts and some water chestnuts for the crunch texture.  I also added on the side some Conimex Kroepoek for that lovely crunch and flavour.  Excellent!  Thank you!!!!

I liked this recipe, i made a few changes that tweaked it to my tasting. I added ground Ginger and red pepper flakes. I also added baby corn and water chestnuts. I also added chopped frozed peas and carrots for color. I also added the orange zest from an entire naval orange so it came to about 2 tablespoons. Delicious!

Made a couple of changes: used an actual orange- squeezed the juice out of it and got the zest. It made it taste so fresh & delicious, rather then packaged orange juice. Also, did not thicken the sauce, it was good as is, for us. Added ginger made a big delicious difference :) Played with the amount of brown sugar a little- ended-up adding less then this recipe calls for. At first, whn tasted the sauce wasn't impressed with flavor, but once it cooked out, it turned out DELICIOUS!! My teenager who is a picky eater LOVED IT & so did hubby & baby too. I did not use sprouts- used a package of frozen broccoli instead & served over rice pilaf. Awesome!

Very tasty! Next time I make it I think that I will add sliced celery and carrots as well as 1/4 tsp. of grated fresh ginger. I served mine over cooked brown rice, which I believe is healthier than the chow mein noodles. I also will double the recipe, as this was enough for only my husband and I, no leftovers!

Was surprised by how disappointed the whole family was in this dish since it got great reviews. To each their own, I guess! Followed the recipe reasonably closely to be able to rate it, we did not like it at all, will not make again.

Really enjoyed this recipe. I did how ever put a twist on it. Instead of using chicken I used firm tofu, broccoli, and king oyster mushrooms. Didn't even miss the chicken. Added a little bit more flour to thicken than suggeted.

Loved this recipe-- but needs a sodium reduction(!) so....  I made the following changes-- I used 1 tbsp. of harrisa flavored EVOO with 2 tbsp. of EVOO.  Cut salt to 1/2 tsp and used low sodium soy sauce.  Instead of bean sprouts I added fresh sugar snap peas (in pod) and sliced portabellas and allowed to steam.  I served over long grain and wild rice (do not use the flavor packet!)  This recipe is definitely worthy of an encore!!

Recipe was quite good with some modifications i.e. no salt, reduced soy sauce to about a tablespoon, and added oyster sauce.
Added tofu, bean sprouts, & carrots & served over white rice.

The flavor of the orange zest was way too strong.  I'm trying to find a healthier alternative to Panda Express Orange Chicken.  This isn't it.

yukie! This could've been great, except I followed the directions exactly. NO salt or zest, half the soy sauce and a half orange juice/the other half water.
the orange taste is overpowering and its way too salty :( disappointed i wasted the chicken!

This recipe was really yummy!  I make this dish just as the recipe called for but I added some sauteed green peppers to the chicken.  Turned out great!

Yummy sauce. Like others I added veggies and used cornstarch in the sauce instead of flour.

I made this for dinner tonight and I had some extar kids over for dinner.  Two of the kids are very picky eaters but I am happy to say everyone cleaned their plates.  I took the advice of adding some ginger and so red pepper and it was so good.  I will make this again for dinner it was so quick and easy as well.

My husband and I both really liked this served over brown rice. I couldn't get it quite as thick as I would have liked and next time I will add more orange zest. We'll be making this again.

I cut the recipe down to 2, and used a half a pound of sliced steak instead of chicken.  I was looking for an orange beef recipe, but wasnt liking what I found. I used more orange zest, probably about 2 tablespoons, left out the salt since i used soy sauce, added sliced red onion, and I used cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  Served with white rice, total hit! Thanks!

Overall, I liked this recipe.  I served it over rice, left out the shoots, and added green, red, and yellow peppers, carrots, onion and broccoli.  I also used low sodium soy sauce.

I thought this recipe was very bland (I even added a ton of veggies) and agree with the other reviewers that something was 'not right' about it, like it tasted off. I will stick with my original orange stir fry recipe.

I was searching for a stir fry recipe that didn't require wine or sherry, as i had none...  This was perfect..  I was short on orange juice, so I topped off the cup with apple juice.  I also used low-sodium soy sauce.  I had no oranges, so no orange zest, I added a little ginger instead.  I also used a bag of frozen broccoli stir fry mix, there was plenty of sauce for everything..  It was delicious, even my toddler cleaned her plate.

I made this using whole oranges I had put in the blender. The sauce worked well with the chicken but doesn't taste too hot with ramen noodles--not that it's designed to go with ramen. I would make this again, this time maybe serving it with just pain old rice.

It's an easy recipe which I love. I did add a little more orange zest than the recipe calls for since alot of reviews said there wasn't as much orange flavor as they were expecting. I also took the advice of another review and reduced the sauce to a more gooey consistency before adding in the thickener. I'll definitely make this again.

I served it over rice without the bean sprouts.  We liked it.  Not terribly exciting.  But our 2 year old who is very picky ate every bite on her plate.  We'll make it again.

This was yummy. I added carrots, onions and broccoli to this and served it over udon noodles instead of chow mein to reduce fat content. I would have liked a more pronounced orange flavor so I will play with the orange rind and juice next time. This came together very fast. Thank you for the recipe.

This was just okay - it seems to be missing something.  I kept tasting the sauce and adding more brown sugar, more red pepper flakes, even a little rice wine vinegar and some ginger.  I even added about a half cup of good orange marmalade.  It still seemed to be lacking in flavor.  I was expecting more intense orange flavor.  I too sauted bell pepper, celery and onion with the chicken, and added propbably twice as much garlic as called for.  I used corn starch to thicken the sauce, as a little will go a long way.  I will try again as we all love take-out orange chicken.

I really like the unique orange flavor of this recipe but I followed some of the suggestions and used less soya sauce (2 tbsp)and used a frozen stir fry veggie mix (instead of the sprouts) and served it with rice. I also added a handful of almonds which adds a nice texture.
