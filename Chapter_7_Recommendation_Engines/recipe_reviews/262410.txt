The waffles turned out really tough. They were bland, tough, and burned easily. They were so bad that , my teenaged brother didn't like them. I think that my lack of cake flour, or that I let them sit in the oven for a while. I don't think that I'll make this ever agian. Ever.

I was searching online for recipes using sour cream since I had an overabundance. Both my husband & I enjoyed the waffles. The texture was just right. I would make them again.

Extremely bland as this recipe didn't have any added salt. Once I added 1 tsp. of salt it was fine, nothing special.

I made it today and it was delicious! It's soft and has good flavor. The sour cream gave it a hint of tanginess and it has the perfect sweetness. 
I did make a few changes. I added 1 tbsp of oil. I used about 1/3 cup of milk. 
 The batter will be thick. I used an ice cream scooper to pour the Batter to the waffle maker and spread the batter out

These waffles were good, they had a very nice texture, but i felt there were missing something.  I added a half teaspoon of salt to the recipe and the flavor was much improved!
