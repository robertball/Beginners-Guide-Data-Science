These are wonderful!  Instead of making these as a burger, I rolled them into little meatballs, and served with whole wheat pasta, asparagus and a little extra virgin olive oil, and everyone gave them rave reviews!  Will definately make again!

FABULOUS!! Moist, juicy and full of taste.  I sauteed the chopped chiles, onion and garlic in about 1 tsp olive oil just to soften before adding to meat.  Used chiles from the garden that have just a touch of heat (not even sure what kind they are),so I also added a couple of dashes of hot (habanero) sauce, which gave the burgers just the right kick. I had about 1.5 to 2 lbs of meat so I just sort of estimated the proportions of everything else. Also omitted the ginger (didn't have & not crazy about)and reduced the cumin as per other reviewers.  Served them topped with pepper jack cheese on whole wheat buns with garden-fresh corn on the cob and sauteed zucchini.  SUPER yummy!

I use this recipe regularly when my boyfriend and I are trying to cut fat.  I use the ingredients as listed, but increase the worchestershire because I like it!  I've found that the smaller you chop the onion, pepper and cilantro, the less likely they are to fall apart.

These were SO good.  I did not alter the amount of cumin, and they were great.  I did add extra garlic and cilantro - just because I love both ingredients.  I substituted the green chiles with chipotle peppers instead and added a tablespoon of the canning sauce because I prefer that smokey flavor.  I also went half and half on the soy and worcestershire sauce.  I will be making these again very soon!

The first time I made these, I knew they had potential, but I was overwhelmed by the paprika and red onion. Made them again last night and reduced the paprika to 1 1/2 Tbsp, and red onion to 3/4 cup. PERFECT! Left my husband and brother both speechless (which doesn't happen often, believe me!)

this was awesome.  my husband absolutely loved these.  i cut the cumin in half and i only had sweet paprika so i used that and i used a little more worcestershire sauce than the recipe called for and i also used the chili pepers in the can from old el paso. i also topped with a tbs of shredded mexican cheese.  my husband and i are on weight watchers and this recipe was full of flavor.  thank you food_diva.

These are soooo good and didn't even taste like a turkey burger - I would however cut the amount of cumin in half next time.  I can't wait to try this with ground beef!

Made a few minor changes, like I don't like chili peppers and will add some red pepper powder if I wanna keep it spiced up, but mostly left as is.  First time I discovered they burned fairly easily grilling them, so next time I just fried them in a pan.  Not-burned these are great! :-)  I liked the spiciness cause it's the only way to give turkey umph.  Just put on a bun with a bit of mayo and loved it.  Will make again.

I made half the recipe as is, and changed the other half to suit other tastes (mostly mine!).  The original received rave reviews, but I liked the less spicy version I made omitting the ginger, paprika, cumin and replacing Worcestershire sauce with fresh-squeezed lime juice.  I thought they held together nicely, considering there wasn't the usual binding ingredients like bread crumbs and egg.  Will make both versions again (this weekend, in fact!)

We really loved these! They made such delicious meal! We serverd them with melted cheddar cheese & salsa on top (no bun). Will definitely make again.

These were pretty good. I sauted onion and jalepeno before adding to meat mixture, otherwise followed recipe as stated. Did not have problems at all with crumbling. Try the Jenny-O brand. It tolds together very well.

Hands down, this is the ultimate turkey burger! I've now made this recipe about a million times. For an even spicier version, I sometimes use diced habanero peppers (warning: HOT!) and omit the soy sauce in favor of more worchestire. Also if you'd like to freeze these patties, simply go to your grocer and pick up some freezer paper, and they last quite a while and are great for an easy quick supper.

These are excellent and very flavorful without being over the top. I added just a wee bit more ginger and garlic and also added some chopped green onion for a little more "freshness". They were a huge hit!  If you buy the 1.3lb packages of ground turkey, you can get 8 burgers that are 3/4 cup in size. It makes it really easy to portion the burgers so they're all the same size if you do it that way. Just be gentle when forming the patties so you don't overwork the meat and make it tough.  These are FABULOUS with a "Rooster sauce" mayo and grilled pineapple on a potato bread roll. That combo is amazing.  For the Rooster sauce mayo, combine about 4 parts mayo with 1 part Sriracha chili sauce (or to taste) and add some lime zest and a good squeeze of lime juice.

followed the directions as written.  LOVED the spicyness to these burgers.  I put all the ingredients in a food processor and then mixed it with the turkey for a burger w/o veggie chunks.  Saved on tons of chopping time.  Freeze patties for about an hour.  Makes grilling a lot easier as they don't fall apart.

Made these as sliders for my Super Bowl party and they were great!  I used pickled jalepeno slices instead of the fresh green chile peppers and they worked well.  I will make this again for sure!

Definitely an improvement on the standard turkey burger, but the resulting taste wasn't quite worth the extra work, in my opinion.

Super good! I cut the serving size to 4 but made 6 burgers from that ingredient list and they were so tasty. Halved the cumin, cut out the cilantro as we didn't have any, added a dash of oregano and basil and about 1/8 cup of rolled oats. Didn't find them too sticky  and the consistency was really nice.

Super duper yummy! These turkey burgers are awesome. However they weren't spicy, but it was something I did. Nevertheless, they were awesome and the flavors were amazing. My husband loved them as much as I did. Instead of green chile I used jalapano peppers. ;-)))

This was excellent! I am eating clean in 2010 and this fit the bill. Normally I find turkey burgers dry and not very tasty but these had a kick and were delicious. I served them with a fat free yogurt-cilantro sauce from this site.

I've never eaten a Turkey burger before so I may not be the best judge. This being said, the flavors did not tap dance on my tounge as other reviewers described.

My husband and I love these turkey burgers and crave them almost weekly.  I serve mine with whole wheat buns, guacamole, and a pepper jack cheese.  Delicious!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This is my first turkey burger and it was very good!  I didn't have any cumin, but otherwise i followed it exactly and it turned out great- mediumly spicy and very flavourful.  I served on a bun with mayo and "cucumbers sunomo" also from this site.  The cucumbers were great on it, and very easy.  I recommend this recipe!

WOW!!  Have never had a turkey burger...these were outstanding. Very moist and so flavorful! Mine held together fine, was concerned about them being cooked all the way through so might have cooked them a little too long, but they were still very good. They were bursting with flavor, which is a good thing when you are counting carbs..need additional flavor!! LOL  I froze the remaining meat in individual bags to we have three more meals of these delightful burgers!!  YUM!

Every bite was full of flavor! We didn't even need toppings because the burger is so tasty by itself. We will be entertaining friends with this recipe.

First I must say that I did not use the hot pepper in this because I had my kids friends over for dinner and I didn't want the burgers to be too spicy for them. That being said, I can not wait to make these again with the chile pepper! These were absolutely wonderful and when I make them again with the spicy in them, they will be over the top! I sauteed the garlic, ginger and onion before mixing with the meat and I'd probably do that again next time. I also cooked these in a cast iron pan because my grill was out of gas. Thanks FOOD_DIVA for this delicious recipe!

These were some of the best turkey burgers I've had. Not dry at all! VERY flavorful. My hubby couldn't stop talking about how good the house smelled while they were cooking. We grilled them in our cast-iron grill pan and halved the recipe as my turkey came in a 1 lb pkg. These were a tad mushy before cooking but I just portioned them out into round balls and froze them for about 15 mins and they were good to form into patties and smack on the grill. Will definitely make these again.

This was REALLY good. It was very moist and had a fantastic gourmet flavor. I did add green peppers to it. I didn't add the cilantro (didn't have any) and I only put jalopeno peppers (kids don't like spicy) on mine when I ate it, along with lettuce, tomato, & miracle whip lite. I made several and put them on wax paper to seperate and froze them in freezer paper so as I want one I can thaw and cook easily. Also cooked some on stove using Pam Spray. Good healthy burger!

This was very very good. I did not use cilantro(was out) and didn't have ginger. I did sautee the onion,garlic cloves, peppers, and added thinly diced mushrooms to put into the mixture. Definately a Keeper. Thanks!! Very easy to make also and boyfriend said this was the best turkey burger ever, who needs red meat when you can have this. WILL MAKE AGAIN!

I really liked the recipe after I tweaked it a bit.  I changed the measurements of all the ingredients and left out the salt because I used regular soy sauce.  I also left out the cumin since I wanted to make it more an Asian inspired burger.
One thing I added which I feel made it more like a Thai burger is along with the chopped cilantro is that I added mint.  Love that combo! 
I also added a bit of canola oil and a beaten egg.  I feel that this made them hold together and come out very moist.

What a joy to find a flavorful "burger" I could make for my husband who is on a low sodium diet. Took out the soy sauce and salt-used more Worchester. I had Jalapeno peppers and used them--accidentally forgot the cilantro but had no problem with them holding together--wonder if the moisture and texture of the leaves could make them crumbly?  Fun to see hubby smile when many low Na foods are so bland !

My husband did not really care for these at all. He had one for dinner and said "how many more of these do I have to eat," knowing that I made 8 and frozen some for later meals. It was a lot of work, so I was very disappointed.

Great recipe. Nice and spicy... just how I like my food. Though it could have been spicer. I would call it more of a 'zing' then spicy, if I had to choose. The only thing I recommend is reducing the amount of cumin, because it was a little too much and the extra teaspoon of salt was not necessary, expecially when adding soy sauce and garlic. Otherwise, everything was wonderful. I recommend this recipe to anyone who would like to 'zing' up a boring old turkey burger

I scaled this to 1.25 lbs of turkey ("5" servings). I wasn't wild about this. It was good, but I've made better turkey burgers. I used ground ginger and dried cilantro, and regular dijon mustard. I only had regular soy sauce, so I left out the additional salt. This was definitely spicy with the jalepeno I used! Next time, I'd leave out the ginger and definitely use the low sodium soy sauce, but still leave out the additional salt. I might make this again. I cooked these by broiling them (don't have a grill, sadly), and ate them on whole wheat buns.

My search is over for the best turkey burger!  Followed the directions but omited the chile peppers (do not like) and fresh ginger root (had none.)  I also used 1 tsp of cumin instead of 1 tbsp. per the advice of other reviewers and kept the rest of the ingredients as written.  Everyone loved them.  A winner for sure.  Thanks food diva.

These burgers are packed with flavor. I added about 10 oz of defrosted frozen spinach for more nutrition and color. The spices need to be adjusted - and usually lessened (1 T. of pepper or 3 T. of paprika for example, would make these burger inedible). Great in a pita with some tehina or hummus.

These were exceptional. I used poblano peppers and slightly sauteed the garlic, onion, ginger and poblano in a tablespoon of canola oil. I used my George Foreman grill and froze half. I did not place on bun and served with roasted corn off the cob and brown rice. Great, healthy meal.

Delicious! I love turkey burgers as a healthier option to beef. This is a terrific flavor combination with the turkey.

Mine did come out a little on the salty side-- with all of the spices, I don't think the salt is really necessary. I'll leave it out entirely next time.

Good! Not as fantastic as I was expecting with all the ingredients, but way better than a regular Turkey bruger. If someone does not enjoy spicy food, it may be a bit overwehlming with all the flavors for them, cut down on the spice.

I cut the cumin and it was still the overwhelming flavor, but overall this is a great burger!  Thanks so much!

Excellent recipe! I substituted some of the paprika with chili powder and the worcestershire sauce with ketchup. Makes delicious burgers that leave a tasty low burn in the back of your mouth.

This is delicious! I followed the direction exactly except for the peppers, I added red pepper flakes. Then I served it on toasted wheat bread with spiced mustand, sauteed mushrooms, red onion slice, lettuce, tomato and cheese. AMAZING and definetly will be a regular at dinner around my house.

These were definitely spicey.  Don't get me wrong, I love a spicey burger, but I thought the spice was a little bit too much in this one.  It seemed like too much heat, and not enough flavor.  I'll make this again, but I'll probably cut back a bit on all of the spices.

These were very good and flavorful. I used chipotle mayo on them and put shredded mozzerella cheese in the center and on top instead of spices. I really enjoyed these!

I had saved this recipe to my recipe box today thinking I would use it another time. This afternoon we went to my mother in law's to swim and decided to grill out last minute. Hence, we did not have all the ingredients like ginger, chilis nor cilantro. But I did use fresh jalepenos from the garden and white onion. I used regular mustard instead of dry and did not add cumin because I dont care for it. Instead I added a tablespoon of Emeril's Essence and a few dashes of hot sauce (Red Devil to be exact). I topped my burger with 1/2 a slice of cheese and had a side of grilled zuchinni and french fries. We really enjoyed the burgers, they had tons of flavor. Next time I will make sure I have all the ingredients on hand, Im sure they will be even better!!!

These surely had a kick to them. The spice soo lingered through out every bite. I liked it very much, I ate this with out the bun, while my daughter ate it with...I'd make again. In this batch we made 5 huge monster size burgers to fit the huge hamburger buns that I bought, and the Better Burger sauce recipe was used to cool down the slight heat. Excellent twist on a Turkey burger.

This is not a good recipe.  Too many competing spices so that the flavor lacks definition.  Still feel kind of sick from it.  I won't be making them again.

wasn't really that spicy (and I added more chilies than called for).  It tasted like a bunch of paprika (not surprisingly).  I was really hoping that the other flavors would be more prominent or at least that it would be spicy!  There are better spicy turkey burger recipes on this site.

We make these a lot and love all the ingredients. 4 stars is because we have to adjust the liquid ingredients or the burgers are too wet and fall apart during grilling; we also omit the salt.

Delicious!!  We love turkey burgers so I was quite happy to stumble upon this recipe and loved the great mix of ingredients.  I did make a few small changes only due to a lack of a couple ingredients.  Unfortunately I didn't have any chile peppers and thought I had a jalapeno, but had to make due with red pepper flakes and a few good shakes of hot sauce!  We do not care at all for cilantro, so I used fresh basil.  I opted to not add the salt due to the soy sauce, which I did reduce a bit and upped the worcestershire to make the 1/4 cup.  All in all tasty and delicous, glad I made extras to freeze!

These were a great change to the ordinary turkey burger. They do have a hard time staying togetether, so I might add an egg next time.

These burgers were so flavorful that they didn't need condiments.  The only thing I might change next time is the amount of cumin to give it a little less of a mexican flavor next time, but otherwise these were great!

Just made these and they were awesome (reduced cumin and salt like reviewers suggested, otherwise no changes).  Hubby said to give 5 stars!  You MUST try with a little lowfat shredded cheese and some BBQ sauce...wow.  Fan-tas-tic.  Will have again for sure, thanks for the keeper!

Wasn't too crazy about these.  I reduced the cumin to 1 tsp as others suggested.  Also used can of diced green chiles.  They were pretty spicy -- too spicy for the kids.

These were very good!  I substituted a 4 oz. can of diced green chiles for the fresh chiles, used 2 tbs. dried cilantro instead of the fresh, and about a half tsp. of ground ginger intead of fresh.  Other than that I followed the recipe verbatim and it came out great.  My grill ran out of gas before I flipped the burgers, so I finished them in the oven on a broiler pan and they were still great.

These were so good Food_Diva!  I left out the soy sauce and dry mustard and added some Montreal Steak Seasoning and chopped bell pepper.  I inteded to serve these with crispy turkey bacon, but forgot.  I ate mine with a slice of pepper jack cheese and fell in love.  Thanks again for this delicious recipe.

These were great.  I think next time I might leave out the salt as the soy sauce adds enough, and felt they were just a tad bit too salty . Otherwise excellent recipe.

Really good flavor. We used ground beef instead of turkey. Cut back slightly on the paprika but otherwise kept things about the same. We had misgivings about the amount of ground black pepper and ground cumin, but it turned out to be just the right amount. Cooked these on the stove in a frying pan. We will definitely make this recipe again.

5 stars for taste. 4 stars for solidity. They were crumbling a little on the grill when I was checking to see if they cooked all the way through. But, now that I know how long they take on MY grill, I won't have to cut in and cause them to crumble more than they already do.

The taste was amazing. A perfect Tex-Mex flavor. I felt like I was eating something fattening, but they were very healthy. I added lettuce, low-fat cheddar, onion, ketchup and mustard and they still tasted great!

Since making this last summer it is not a staple on our menu.  Everyone loves it, perfect spice.  Sometimes they fall apart a bit, so you need to take care while grilling (flip once).  But so delicious.

These may be one of the top 3 turkey burger recipes I've ever had. They were moist, flavorful and delicious. I am the only one in my family of 5 that will eat turkey burgers so I wrapped the leftover (uncooked) patties in plastic wrap, slid them into a freezer bag and put them in the freezer. They can then be made after thawing or frozen. Thanks for sharing!

I've been trying to cut the calories but with summer comin, balancing my love of bikini's with my love of good grill food is difficult.  i thought i'd try this spin on the turkey burger and it was absolutely delicious.  i cook quite alot and tend to play with recipies but i love having a really great one to start off with.  this was amazing the way the recipe states and i've made it for many family and friends and they all love them too.  just took a little bit a of tweeking to come up with my very own custom version which is constantly in demand from me at all BBq's but i couldn't have got there without this recipe... a definate MUST TRY

Everyone in the family LOVED these - even the ones who aren't big fans of turkey burgers.  They're definitely not boring or flat tasting the way some turkey burgers can be.  I used mixed dark and white turkey meat so they were not at all dry.  You could probably get by with omitting the salt since the soy sauce is plenty salty - even the low sodium variety.  I'll make these again for sure!

My husband is always leery of Turkey Burgers but he said I could make these anytime! I always follow the  directions the first time around and then tweak a recipe. I asked hubby what he would change about these or add and he said NOTHING!! A first I might add, since he is picky! Will definitely be making these again!

I just made this tonight and it is very good. I had two issues in the blending process however.. It was not very firm and the patties were difficult to form and the cumin is very potent and I will probably cut in half next time.. Great taste!

Delicious! I really wasn't expecting to like these as much as I did. I thought the soy sauce would be overpowering, but it really blended nicely with all the other flavors. I did cut down on the garlic and omitted the salt. Really good. Thank you! :)

Excellent!! My husband made a blue cheese hamburger for himself and I wanted something healthy...he was so jealous. I went easy on the cumin and the soy sauce (no extra salt needed) they came out perfect. Topped it with avocado, this recipe is a keeper.

Love this recipe!  I made it as written and they were really moist--and bursting with flavor.  You have to really like cumin for this one (I do).  I diced the veggies very, very small and the burgers held together just fine.  If you don't have low-sodium soy sauce on hand and plan on using regular, I would recommend cutting back on the salt amount.  I made mini burgers with mine and topped them with a little cheddar because that's all I had on hand.  Will definitely make again!  Thanks!

It looks like we are in the minority on this one, but these just weren't good at all. I followed the recipe. I think it was the cilantro that threw off the taste becuase everything else is pretty standard. I def. won't be making this again.

Very VERY good! Way better than hamburgers, in my opinion. I would rather eat these any day.  I followed the recipe minus the ginger, just because I was unsure how that would taste. Definitely try this if you are looking to make some tasty burgers with a kick!

Absolutely delicious!  I was looking for a way to add some flavor to plain turkey burgers, and I came across this recipe.  I didn't have chile peppers, so I added some crushed red pepper and chili chiptole spice that I love.  Fantastic...I made them twice in one week!

My wife doesn't eat red meat, so I've eaten a ton of turkey burgers over the past ten years. This recipe would give any burger a run for it's money. It has an excellent taste, just the right kick and stays together very nicely. My only deviation from the original recipe involves the black pepper - I knocked it down from a tablespoon to a teaspoon. I've made these 3 or 4 times this year and I'm fixing to make them again tonight. Happy Summer!

Decent turkey burger to bring in a different flavor to the traditional burger. I halved the recipe and still got 5 good sized burgers. Will definitely make again.

Very simple to make and very very good!  Only difference I made was I used ground Ginger instead of fresh because it was all I had on hand.  Like others suggested, I also topped ours with pepper jack cheese.  Another good topper is some good home made chow chow if you have it. Thanks for the recipe!

*update**  I am now on a new super strict diet and this is a recipe I chose to make...after forgetting I had made it before.  I had to go without the bun, but did top with some fat free cheddar, and sliced avacado in place of mayo.  A little dijon mustard to top and perfect!  These are very good.  Nice flavor!  Will def make again!

We're not big cumin fans, so that may have been the problem, but with ground turkey so expensive I won't be trying this again.

These are OK. Not great. Made 5 burgers for my bf and I last Sat., expecting leftovers for this week (I scaled all ingredients b/c I could only find a 1.25 lb. pkg. of turkey at the store). These had a 'meatloaf' texture that me and my bf weren't particularly fond of (not an appropriate texture for burgers IMHO).... I think these were also too spicy - not 'hot,' just too many flavors competing all at once). Since it has was threatening rain, I grilled these up on my Crate & Barrel griddle (i.e. the side with grilling grooves). Topped my burger w/ pepperjack cheese, Cajun mayo, Boston bibb lettuce, tomato & red onion slices (bf's w/ just mayo) and served on fresh whole wheat kaiser buns. To make cajun mayo, simply mix 1/2 c. mayonnaise with 1 tsp. Cajun seasoning, or to taste. I got this idea from the recipe for Tex-Mex Burgers w/ Cajun Mayo (Sarah Stephan). Try pairing these w/ Corn and Black Bean Salad by Jodi T. as the two complement each other quite nicely. Thanks for sharing :)

I used ground ginger and dried cilantro but these were delicious anyway!  They weren't too spicy which was good because my toddler was able to eat some.

These burgers are great! I used a jalapeno as other readers had suggested. I used the whole thing--seeds and all and it was perfect. I love things spicy. I will be making these again soon!

I saw the look on my husband's face when he saw ground turkey but he didn't say anything.  I thought maybe he wouldn't even try them, but he did and he raved, and raved over them and wants them again tomorrow night. I used one large jalapeno with seeds instead of chile peppers, everything else the same.  Used the George Foreman grill and served with  mango/coconut pepper sauce found in the condiment section of Publix.  Amazing burgers!

OK, when I told the 4 carnivores in my house I was grilling turkey burgers, they were not excited at all. This recipe changed their minds, the DH and 3 teenage boys loved them! They now ask when we have burgers, if we are having the spicy turkey burgers, and are disappointed if we arent. Great spicy recipe!

I really enjoyed this recipe. Like another reviewer i made as pan-fried meatballs. Also, i eliminated the chile pepper and used a teaspoon of red pepper flakes. In the pan after I removed the cooked meatballs I added a few more teaspoons of olive oil and sauteed zucchini and yellow squash. I served over whole wheat linguine. Delish!

Wow, talk about souped up Turkey!! They are so packed w/ flavor and so yummy, I wish I had bought more ground turkey when it was on sale. I added only 1/2 of a jalapeno pepper, seeds and all because I did not have a chile pepper. Added  1 egg and 1/2 of a fresh lime, squeezed. Also sauted the onion and pepper b4 adding. Was worried about too much paprika, so I added only 1 T. They are sooooo good. I just dipped them in flour and fried them on the stove in olive oil. I got 6 large burgers.Ate them w/ spelt pasta and broccoli florets. Next time I would like to make small meatballs & serve w/ pasta and veggies.

The 3 stars is for the texture of the burger.  I love that.  The recipes calls for lean turkey but I did not know if that was breast meat.  So I uses 1/2 breast meat and 1/2 lean turkey.  I did not want a fatty burger!  BUT I did not love the flavor; SO spicy and I love spicy.  I will make the burger this I love the texture but I would delete the ginger and tone down the spicy.  I want to taste the turkey and the spices only.

This was a wonderful recipe.  The burgers were healthy, juicy, and best of all yummy!! My only variatios were that I could not find any Chilie peppers, so I substitued it for a jelpeno pepper, and I only put in 1/2 a small red onion, which I chopped very fine.  This turkey burger was so good, I didn't need to add anyhting else but a tomato on top.

Great burgers, lots of flavour. I only used half the garlic as it sounded like rather a lot (not that I don't love garlic, I just had an important meeting the next day!) and they tasted great. I've got a batch waiting in the freezer for a rainy day.

This is one of the best burger recipes I have encountered in a really long time! Without a bun, it is weight watchers friendly and with one, you have to be careful with sides and toppings.  We topped ours tonight with tomato, cheddar cheese, and onion.  I made a sauce for a topping made of ketchup,mayo,and thai chili sauce.  It was amazing.  I barely changed the recipe aside from halving it, adding an egg, and a few additional splashes of worcestershire sauce.  Excellent recipe! I have already hidden the leftovers to insure I get them for lunch!

My fiance and I have never had a turkey burger before, and these were awesome! I cut the recipe in half and made the patties up ahead of time so they were able to dry out just a tad before grilling. I added lettuce, a slice of red onion and a slice of provolone cheese on the bun. I dipped mine in mayo (and added a couple bananna peppers on the side), and my fiance dipped his in thousand Island. I want to make these again this weekend!

My husband is Lebanese and absolutely loved the flavor of these burgers - very similar to arabic flavored meat dishes.  However, I personaly do not like very spicy foods so used only half the amounts called for of chile pepper, black pepper, paprika, dry mustard, and cumin. I also used only 1/4 tsp ground ginger root.  Just right for all of us.  Will definitely make again soon.

These were great.  Husband said they should replace ALL burgers.  I did reduce the cumin a little and only used half the soy sauce.  I also estimated all ingredients.  Next time I may omit the soy sauce.

Delicious!  When I looked at the list of ingredients, I thought holy cow, that's a lot of spices.  I was afraid it would be overpowering, but I decided to trust the reviews, and I'm glad I did!  These turkey burgers have a very complex, smoky flavor.  I fried them in a pan until they were crispy on the oustide and still juicy on the inside, we put them on whole wheat buns with lettuce, tomato, red onion, and spicy mayo and topped with some cheese and gobbled them up.  For anyone who's worried, they aren't spicy at all.

This recipe was terrific.  I made a couple of changes.  I left out the soy sauce and ginger and served these with melted pepper jack cheese.  Instead of buns we used thin sliced french bread and toasted them like a patty melt. Yum.  Will definately make these again.  My family loved them.

Fantastic!  These are the only burger recipe I will use from now on, it`s that good.  Plus healthy too.
Did not have ginger, dry mustard and cumin, so omitted them from the patties but did not notice the absence.  Anyway, we add mustard as a burger condiment so that makes up for the lack of dry mustard powder in the meat.  Omitted cilantro as well, but that is just a personal preference.  Overall, this recipe is highly recommended!

These were good!!!!!...but wow were they big....I mean this is a huge burger...it's a quarter pounder. (or so it it supposed to be...but the next time I make these (with the recipe adjusted for 4 servings) I will divide the meat up into much smaller burgers. Anyway. I left out the fresh ginger, chile peppers, and cilantro. I upped the garlic, onion, and the Worcestershire sauce (I was substituting it for soy sauce). I also cut back a bit on the paprika. These would also make good meatballs, I think. and I think I'll try that the next time I make this recipe.

Very, very good!  We like it hot, so instead of green chili peppers, we cut up about 3/4 of a can of Chilpolte Chili peppers in adobe sauce and blended them in.  Nice smoky, hot, variety of flavors!  Thanks for sharing!

We followed this recipe to a "T", except we changed the serving size to 4.  It wasn't spicy at all and really pretty bland.  We make a similar turkey burger, but we add lots of chili powder, crushed red pepper infused olive oil, garlic powder, and the ingredients listed in this recipe (minus ginger) and ours is great.  Wanted to try this recipe because of the ratings.  We'll stick with our version!

I can't eat beef, but this is an excellent substitue to the beef burger.  A little more work, but I make a big batch and freeze them so they're ready for fast and summery meals...

Snaps for Food_Diva! What a great way to eat turkey burgers. As always I read the reviews and followed the advice of others. I used less cumin and salt. I added onion powder and dijon mustard because thats what I had and they were delicious. It was the perfect spice and the kids thought they tasted like tacos. Will definitely make these again!!!

Yummy. So easy and very tasty. I had everything on hand. I used ground ginger(powder) and onion powder instead of diced onion as my 10 year old can pick out the smallest diced onion, lol. He loved it! They were quite soft (raw) so I grilled them on my George Forman with fantastic results in less than 10 minutes. Thanks!

These were good.  IF I ever make these again I would cut the cumin in half as it was a little over powering, otherwise they were fairly good, my beef eating husband thought they were great the best turkey burger recipe I have found yet but I am still searching for the one!

I was being very BOLD to serve turkey (sissy) burgers to my guys.  But they love these and have requested them more than once in the past couple of months.  The recipe is perfect as is, I left out the peppers for my little ones and with nothing else omitted, they are perfect for kids who "don't like spicy" -- they are just very zesty and flavorful without the peppers.  I grilled on HIGH, 5 minutes each side and they were perfect this time.  The first time they were a little overdone.

Very flavorful and different, but a bit too spicy for my taste. Next time I'll reduce the cumin slightly.  Instead of the fresh green chile peppers, I used a can of diced.

These did not look like they would hold together on the grill but did so perfectly. Grilled for 5 minutes each side. Topped with cheddar cheese, mayo and dill relish.  Moist and delicious.

The only real change was that I cut this in half since we are now empty nesters.  Otherwise I used pretty much everything the recipe calls for. I didn't have hot pepper so I used a big hunking teaspoon of pickled  hoagie peppers. If you like flavor,  use the same amount of meat and double the spice. If you are a regular  week day cook, you'll eyeball it. Don't skimp..... Life is better spicy. Make it spicy and flavorful.

These were very flavorful, moist burgers. I will definitely make them again but without the added salt. The family loved them but thought they were a little too salty. I think the soy sauce has enough salt for the recipe.

Really good flavour but I found them a bit dry, albeit still good for turkey burgers. I may have over cooked them a bit so I will try less time when I make them next, which will be very soon!

I really liked this recipe, but I'm giving it four stars because there is way to much soy sauce. You can half it. Also, I know this is a preference, but I would useThai chilis and up the amount to give a a good kick. I used six and it was good! But I like hot things!

Goes really well with some tomato, spinach and mayo!

Loved it. The burgers have great flavor and are easy to make. Since I didn't have the green chili pepper I just used some hot peppers in a jar I had in the fridge. Worked just as well. Also added a little hot sauce as a topping. Yum!

I was looking for something to jazz up a package of ground turkey that was about to expire.  WOW!  This was awesome! The whole family loved them! I followed the advice of some of the other reviews and reduced the cumin by half, but otherwise followed the recipe. I grilled fresh pineapple slices to put on top. I will be  making these again and again.

Very good!  A nice change from a regular turkey burger.  I left out the cilantro since I didn't have any and used white onions and canned chilis that I had on hand.  My husband loved them!

These turned out moist and very flavorful. I substituted 1.5 teaspoon yellow mustard for dry mustard and 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper for the green chile. Next time I think I'll add more cayenne pepper to kick up the heat. I may also use ground ginger next time, because the minced fresh ginger wasn't spread out enough in the meat mixture. Just by accident, I only used 1.5 tablespoons of cilantro, and I love cilantro. So it turned out as just a subtle flavor in the burger.
This recipe's a keeper for sure!

This was a big hit-- loved the great taste for a burger!  I used Mexi-bells for the peppers ingredient, will probably try something a little hotter (jalapeno) next time for a little extra kick.

Excellent turkey burgers! Love the fresh jalapeno peppers incorporated into meat. Not too hot, just right! With a thick slice of cheddar cheese melted on top, crisp lettuce and fresh sliced tomato this was wonderful! I think a nice chipotle mayo slathered on a toasted bun would be fabulous!

Love these! I  sauté the onions, garlic, and chiles before adding to the turkey mixture but aside from that I keep to the recipe as written. I top with pepperjack cheese and serve with multigrain tortilla chips and guacamole. Good stuff.

EXCELLENT! My husband is a real picky eater and not interested in turkey burgers but HE LOVED THESE.  I only had enough ground turkey for 6 burgers so I made adjustments accordingly.  I had a jalapeno pepper and seeded and diced it. It thought it might still be too hot so I rinsed the diced pepper in water.  It turned out great.  I probably could have left the heat in. Oh - and just because I am trying to add tumeric to things for its health benefits, I did add a bit of tumeric.

Ground turkey has always been so blah and bland, but these burgers were FABULOUS!  Made exactly as written - so much flavor.  My husband and 9 year-old daughter were amazed by how good these were.  Will make again and again.

We have made these a few times now and they are delicious every time!  Followed the recipe exactly.  I top with provolone cheese, lettuce, pico de gallo and chipotle mayo (see recipe on this site) and put it on a Kaiser bun and it is one amazing burger!

I didn't really care for this recipe.  I found the spices to be a little over-powering for a burger.  It tasted more like a taco.  My boyfriend really liked it though.

Made these and got rave reviews. I ran out of soy sauce so used a little more worsteshire, added a little panko bread crumbs and a couple dahses of cayenne for heat. I also didn't have any green chiles or ginger but it came out great. I have a curry herb plant and I added a few sprigs of that. Yum.

Besides making the first batch a little, uhm, "spicy" these are AWESOME! We didn't have buns and are trying to be healthy, so we used bib lettuce leaves and 1/2 cup rice per serving. Wrapping these into lettuce wraps were awesome. My husband has been begging me for them all day. I actually just came back to get the recipe again! Time to get cookin!

I make these burger quite often with one change. I use ground chicken. The change was purely accidental.my husband bought chicken instead of turkey.The difference is amazing ground chicken is moist and tender a change from turkey/ground beef. I am making them this weekend as sliders with Hawaiian bread dinner rolls and a mango pineapple salsa.....Yum

Wow! Toned down spicyness by reducing peppers to one, using 1/2 onion, and using 1 tsp pepper.  Also did not have dry mustard, so substituted 2 Tbsp regular mustard. It was still spicy that way, but not so hot your mouth was burning. Served in wheat buns with fresh tomato and spinach.

These were amazing!!  I used a chipotle pepper because that was the only kind I had in the house, and they were wonderful.  I made them into meatballs, but next time I'll do the burgers as you suggested.  I'll probably top then with pepper jack cheese or something.  Yum!

These were yummy and were very moist!  I omitted the mustard, added an egg, more Worchestershire sauce, less paprika, crushed red pepper instead of the green chili peppers, and used a white onion instead of the red onion.  I cooked the burgers with a tablespoon of canola oil in a skillet on the stove and added additional onions to the pan.

This recipe is great! Given I don't love turkey burgers and I hate the crunch of onions and veggies, I was amazed at how much I loved this burger! I didn't use cilantro, and definitely don't think it's needed if you don't liked it. Only one warning--my friend was chopping the chili peppers and then touched her eye, and her entire face and eye became inflamed.

We enjoyed this recipe. I substitued canned chopped green chilies and omitted the cilantro as we don't like the flavor. We always eat our burgers without the bun and this was very tasty. Will keep and fix again.

These were delicious!   I was a little concerned, as I'd never made turkey burgers before, and love beef burgers, but they turned out wonderful...and healthier...excellent combination! :)  I used a can of green chili's, because that's what I had on hand, and added some shredded cheese into the mix, as I like the moisture and how it helps hold burgers together...but other than that, followed the recipe exactly.  With it we had corn on the cob, a macaroni salad recipe that I found here and watermelon.  Very tasty and we'll definitely be grilling these again!

These were very good burgers! They had good flavor and some spice but were not too hot. The cumin was a little stronger than we care for, so I think I will cut back on it next time. Overall, we thought these were delicious and we will definitely be making them again.

These were incredibly flavorful and tasty!  Cooked easily on my G. Foreman grill, and the only difference I made was replacing the diced chili peppers with 1 jalapeno pepper diced.

These are burgers with FLAVOR!  I followed previous reviewers' advise and put in 1 1/2 Tbsp of paprika and 1 *small* onion!  I served them with slices of creamy avocado instead of cheese and it was the best combination ever!  I'll definitely be making these again!

Pretty good.  I'd cook this again.  Much better than store bought frozen turkey burgers.  Added avocado and mango salsa to the burgers.

This is a nice combination of spices!  Provolone & lettuce topped it off nicely.  I sauteed the garlic, fresh ginger, onion chives & red pepper then added to the meat & spices to form patties.  To keep it healthy I made a side of sauteed fresh green beans & mushrooms.

I would rate this a "pretty good". There were just so many flavors happening here. I ate it plain so perhaps bread would have balanced out the flavor a bit. It was good, but not great for me.

This burger is AMAZING. I only had a pound of turkey, but didn't decrease the spices very much. I used a little less liquid (soy & worcestershire) and a little less of the paprika. I also didn't have any green chiles, so I used some pickled jalapeños I had in the fridge. Topped with provolone and spicy may. Perfect. Can't wait to make them again!

I recently tried this recipe, since I've been trying to find alternatives to red meat.  Everyone LOVED it!  I enjoyed it, but would definitely add more spices next time to spice it up even more. Maybe red pepper or red pepper flakes. Also- it was kinda gooey and messy compared to hamburger when I was making the patties.  I added some seasoned croutons that I crushed up, which seemed to help. *I did learn that not all ground turkey is healthy, as in low fat.  Even the packages that appeared to be a leaner type were super high in fat.  Once I paid attention to the different types I found one that was significantly lower in fat..like 3.5 grams a serving.  Anyway, good recipe..Thanks!  I will make again!

My family loved these tasy burgers. I increased the ginger because we like the taste. I also mixed in an egg to hold them together. My husband grilled them and said they cooked up with less fuss than regular burgers. This recipe will become one of our regulars.

These were pretty good, the meat was too soft to BBQ, so we cooked them on the stove. I sauteed the onions, but not the peppers (next time i will) The only think i would change is using less soy sauce i think that's what made the meat so soft.

Easy, flavorful recipe for turkey burgers.  Halfed recipe and used 1/2 fresh jalapeno in place of chilis. Moist burgers, held together fine. Very good!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good and flavorful.  So, I accidentally swapped measurements on the soy sauce and worchestire sauce, Delicious!  Next time I'll pay attention and then i'll see what I like better. Yum!

finally! the turkey burger recipe that i have been looking for. DELICIOUS. i was out of paprika and powdered mustard, ginger and green chilis, but added three dashes of tabasco instead (i did not want this too spicy becuase children were going to be eating them also). the flavor and consistency were delicious and eaten by all. I look forward to trying the recipe again as listed and again by replacing the green chilis with jalapenos becuase i think both are going to be great. thank you for finally satisfying my need for an easy and tasty turkey burger recipe.

So I was a little worried about the cumin and paprika, and I actually accidentally put 2 tbls of cumin versus the paprika! but I did my best to salvage it. I used half ground turkey and half ground chicken, because I'm not a huge fan of turkey... these turned out great! I couldn't get over how juicy they were! And talk about a kick! I think I will only use 1 chili pepper next time, but I thought the myriad of flavors was awesome. I was missing tomato on the bun, and only had lettuce and onion, with Mayo must. and catchup.Thought the tomato would have cooled it off a bit, but I will totally make this one again!

These were really yummy!  I agree that they are not super spicy which was fine with me since I am not a huge spice fan.  I loved the taste with the cilantro.  I froze some patties to grill in the future.

OK. Personally I didn't think it was spicy as said. Because of the ground cumin in it, it had an aroma like curry it overpowered the other spices. 1 Tbsp of cumin is too much in a recipe. Better to use less or dashes of it it would of been fine. My family didn't care much about it, maybe next time I'll use dashes of cumin.

This was the best turkey burger I've ever had.  I did not have any green chiles so I substituted green pepper.  It was not spicy at all...just really flavorful.  I also lessened the amount of cumin down to 1 teaspoon.  My kids loved it too.  I will definetely make this again.  I'll buy chiles to try it as it is written.

This was really good.  I made 1/2 of this recipe with one pound of ground turkey.  this made 4 good sized burgers.  Based on some of the comments that the burgers tended to fall apart, I mixed in an egg, too.

The best burgers of ANY KIND i've ever eaten. We like to wrap them in bacon and top them with various cheeses. Blue cheese was our most recent favorite.

Yummy! I left out the green chile peppers, paprika, and dry mustard.  It was spicy enough without those ingredents. I did add a little chipotle spice and halfed the recipe. I will make these again.

i thought these were wonderful. The only concern is that if you are looking for an alternative meat because of fat, turkey is definately not the answer. But they were tasty and have made serveral times!! Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is great!  I upped the jalapeno and cilantro, which really added a lot of kick.  Then I topped it with cheese and a cilantro & lime mayo.  Delicious!

Tasty for a turkey burger. I was missing some ingrediants so I used shallots in place of onions and grey poupon in place of the dry mustard. It was more wet than I wanted so I added some bread crumbs. The burgers tasted more like meatballs than burgers but they were good. I cut up the leftovers the next day and fried them with onions and eggs and served them with toast. It was wonderful!

Wow! This has got to be the best turkey burger I've had. The seasonings were out of this world and the fresh cilantro exploded with flavor in every bite. I grilled it and added a slice of Provalone then placed it on an onion burger bun with Chipotle mayo.

This has to be one of the most flavorful (I wouldn't say spicy) turkey burgers I have ever made.  Only flaw is they fall apart easily so I am going to have to work on that with bread crumbs or more yogurt or something.  But they were great the ones that stayed together and the ones that crumbled turned into a topper for salad the next day!  Thanks for the recipe!
EXCELLENT!

Mu husband DOES NOT like turkey burgers and he said these were actually very good.  I held back on the spices a bit and will go full throttle next time.  I also used canned green chiles instead of fresh which didn't give them enough kick. This recipe has real potential and I will definately make again playing around with the ingredients.

These burgers turned out very tasty and flavorful. However because there are so many ingredients which blend into one, makes me wonder if all are completely necessary. Still very good.

These are excellent!  They are moist and yummy with a kick!  I used canned diced green chilis - call me lazy.  I highly recommend this recipe.

These were amazing. I had a BBQ last night for 20 people (adults) and everyone raved about them. They disappeared quickly. I was concerned that the recipe might be too spicy but they were just right. This recipe will become a regular for us.
