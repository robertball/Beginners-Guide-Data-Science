The first time I made this recipe I thought that the flavour was rather bland. The recipe needed a lot more flavour for my tastes. I have made some changes that I think add more flavour. I now really enjoy the recipe. To start, I heat about 1 tbsp. of sesame oil, 1 tbsp of minced gingeroot and 1 tbsp. of minced garlic in pan. Then I cooked chicken until no longer pink. I then added the veggies and cook for about 3 minutes. I then add coconut milk, 1 tbsp. lime juice, 2 1/2 tsp. of thai green curry paste, 1/2 tsp. cumin, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, and 1 tsp. chili powder. I also serve it with a garnish of sesame seeds or chopped cashews. The sauce is still rather thin but I still enjoy it over jasmine rice.

When I read this recipe I thought "Hmmm...no salt???" I knew it would be too bland for me if I made it that way. I'm all about high blood pressure (just kidding) ;) Anyway, I added about a tsp of salt to the chicken and curry powder as well as a little cayenne pepper. As I sauteed the chicken I added about two tsp of fish sauce (what is Thai food without fish sauce??) I didn't have any jasmine rice on hand so I used short grain sticky rice and oh my goodness...the way that coconut sauce melds with the rice is pure ambrosia! I also wouldn't say this is a lower fat recipe, if you use a can of regular coconut milk as the recipe states it is nearly pure fat! 12 grams per serving to be exact...but we live once, and I personally wouldn't substitute low fat coconut milk in this recipe...so I'm all about clogging my arteries as well LOL but who cares, this was DELICIOUS! Thank you!

I forgot to mention in my previous review - Try sauteeing the chicken in a tablespoon of sesame oil along with a few chopped garlic cloves and some fresh chopped ginger root ... tastes great!

i knew from the ingredients list and the other reviews this was going to be bland if i didnt do something about it. so, taking a bit of everyone elses advice, i used a normal brown onion - chopped into slices and sauted in normal and sesame oil. i also added two minced cloves of garlic. i then added the chicken, browned it for a moment, then i added 2 tablespoons of curry powder and 2 teaspoons of garam marsala. i added a tin of coconut cream, snow peas, asparagus and very thinly julieneed carrots and let the whole lot simmer gently whilst i cooked the rice - i use basmalti because it is extrodinarily low carb. i threw in a pinch of salt whist cooking and then salted lightly once i served.

FANTASTIC!

use this recipe like a base and go wild. it really is that good. yes its a thin sauce, but i like it like that.

This is horrible.  The sauce is so incredibly bland. I tried following other's suggestions of spices to add but it was still terrible. I feel bad that I wasted the money on the groceries.

I agree with "KANDIYOHIV," this recipe is incredibly bland. Maybe I'm just used to eating more Thai dishes because I live in NYC and there are lots of great Thai restuarants, but this is NOT how Thai food should taste. There was no flavor in the broth other than a light hint of curry powder from the chicken. The veggies didn't have any flavor to soak up so they didn't taste like anything. Overall, very bland, but if you don't usually eat flavorful Thai food maybe this recipe is for you. Is it very simple to make so that's why it gets 2 stars instead of 1.

what a wonderfully romantic addition to a romantic day on the beach... a glass of wine... chicken curry.. watching the sun set from the Patio...mmmm

The addition of salt, garam masala and full fat coconut milk do the trick... cilantro and lemon grass really kick it up... lemon sorbet with a Tbl of Vodka for dessert..mmmm

Delicious!  I varied the vegetables for what I had, but it's definitely a favourite new recipe.  I love the use of asparagus.

This is a good starter recipe but needs more to make it taste like a Thai dish. I added about 1 1/2 T fresh minced ginger, 3 minced garlic cloves, 1 chopped piece of lemongrass, Â½ - 1 t cayenne pepper, 2 T fish sauce, and a handful of leftover mushrooms. After it was cooked I added Sriracha to my bowl for more spice. It satisfied my craving for Thai food!

this was pretty good for a weeknight dinner. I did add twice as much curry powder, a T of fish sauce, and some sliced yellow onions. I tossed those all with the chicken, and then sauteed the mixture. I also used light coconut milk. Yum and easy

Loved this but made some modifications to suit my taste. Sauteed my chicken in sesame oil and a clove of minced garlic then I added the carrot, 1/2 cup asparagus (its all I had), green onion and about 1 cup of chopped cauliflower. Cooked that and then added the coconut milk, some fish sauce, cashews, salt and a ton of red pepper flakes for heat. Mmm, good.

A tasty meal!  I had to spice it up a lot (tripled the curry powder, added some cayenne and fish sauce) but the end result was well-liked by my family.

This recipe was excellent, but I used pretty much every suggested addition (i.e. garlic, extra curry, cumin, ginger, salt, etc.), and included one of my own--a nice, heavy sprinkling of cinnamon when the sauce was simmering.  It gave it just that extra something that made it wonderful and aromatic.  I added probably close to 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, but I also doubled every ingredient in the sauce recipe except for the coconut milk, and the consistency turned out just right, plus we had plenty of yummy leftovers for the next day.  Otherwise I think there would be far too much sauce for the amount of rice it suggests cooking.  All in all, if you pay attention to the reviews and follow the suggestions, you will not be disappointed.

I found this to be really tasty and easy. I used probably double the curry called for, and added probably close to the same amount of chili powder. I didn't have the exact vegetables on hand, but I had planned on leaving the asparagus out anyway since I don't like it. Instead, I used some frozen stirfry-style veggies that I had, which contained pea pods, red peppers, babycorn, carrots and bamboo shoots. I did have fresh green onions to use, however.  I used regular white rice instead of jasmine, since to me, jasmine rice tastes like drinking perfume. ;) Overall, I loved this recipe and will definitely make it again.

This recipe is quite good, we made a couple of minor changes. We steamed the asparagus, pea pods and carrots, otherwise they were just too hard. Also julienned the snow peas, and it was great.

As is this recipe is NOT good and had to be raised from the dead pretty quickly.  I didn't realize how bland it was until the end when I tossed in the coconut milk.   MY Quick mods - fish sauce, sugar, cyan.  However, even with the changes i still would not recommend this one.  There has got to be better ones out there.

I made this as directed and found that it didn't have the flavor I craved.  My humble opinion is that this recipe needs to up the curry powder, add ginger, fresh garlic and maybe some red chili powder if you like heat (which I like I little).  Not a terrible dish, but a bit too bland for me.

Needs more flavor.  Ummm A LOT MORE flavor.  When I tasted it on the stove I had to do a double check of the recipe cause it was just that bland. Good news is a little garlic salt can go a long way.

This is so bland, its ideas are good but just no flavor especially for Thai food. I even tried to spice it up like someone else recommended and it just wasn't there. Sorry.

Very Good. I recommend sprucing it up some, because it is somewhat bland without. I tried to incorporate several other reviews: Use 1 whole brown onion in addition to the green onion (sautÃ©ed in sesame oil), add about a tsp of salt, 2 Tbsp of curry (instead of just one), 3 thick slices of ginger root if you have any (let cook with rice), and 1 clove of garlic. I cooked the rice in coconut milk as well as added more coconut milk to the hot stovetop mixture. A hint: reduce water by 8oz (1 cup) and cook the rice in the coconut milk and remaining water.

We were looking for something different and this is certainly it.  I was confused right away because the ingredient list said curry paste but cooking instructions said curry powder. I bought the paste just for this recipe and we loved the flavor. Also, unless jasmine rice cooks up different, I used 1 1/3 cup dry basmati rice and made a big bowl of rice pudding with the leftover rice. My 11 year old hated it and he is usually pretty open minded with my cooking.

This dish is *delicious*, looks great and is *incredibly* easy to make. I've made it twice in the last week to 'great applause' and am looking forward to serving it to friends this weekend.  I love recipes like this, - try it - you won't be disappointed.......

This dish was great taking into account others' suggestions.  I agree with adding more spice to the chicken (masala or tumeric) plus lots of ginger and garlic... also using fish oil to cook it with.  I wanted the sauce to be thicker in the end so I also added cornstarch, and allowed it to simmer for another 15 min. on low heat to let the flavors blend.

wow, this is going to be one of my stand-by meals. I really liked this. I bought curry powder (a decent brand) at the grocery store. I used broccoli, carrots and green onions. I added currents at the end along with the juice of 1/2 a lime. It needed salt, so I added that to taste. This was a snap and one of those recipes that is really easy to remember. watch tasteslikefood.com and I'll eventually post a picture there.

I agree with the person that says this is a good base recipe.  I added salt and minced garlic to the chicken with the initial curry powder.  With the coconut milk, I added some chili powder and some more curry powder.  It would have been very bland without the extra additions.  I have to say that my son and VERY picky teenage daughter liked it (my son loved it).

This was really good. One thing that a lot of people forget is that most Asian food does taste "bland" compared to many others. What I loved about this dish was the simplicity in it that enabled me to taste each and every ingredient. I did add 1 tsp of salt, 1 tsp of cumin, and a dash of cayenne pepper to the curry and chicken. This was for personal preference - I like my dishes to have a little kick to them. It was DELICIOUS though!

This recipe has a lot of potential...but it lacks the spice and flavor you usually find in Thai food. With some modifications, however, it could be a great dish

Very easy recipe to make, though it lacks a lot of flavor.  I added some "Thai Sweet Chili Sauce" and it quickly became 100% better.  Gets only 3 stars due to the lack of flavor without the chili sauce.  Will definately be making this one over and over again.

I cooked this as the main dish for my family for a celebration, and everyone LOVED it. I made a few changes, such as I added garam masala with the spices, and used cayenne to really give it some kick. I made a large amount, so I added everything to taste, but I think I ended up using alot of curry also.

Good recipe. I used baby carrots instead of shredded carrots, and used only half of the coconut milk. Also added chili powder to give it a kick. It turned out pretty well.

Good recipe, but regular curry powder doesn't make this taste anything like a Thai curry.  Regular curry powder is, from my experience, more of an Indian curry flavor.  My husband and I ate a yellow curry dish at a Thai restaurant just a few days before making this recipe, and it was nothing like the dish we made at home.  Even though it was not much of a Thai curry, though, it was still good!

I thought this was very yummy.  I used a bit more curry powder (hot madras) and used green beans, carrot slices, red peppers, and potatoes like a dish in the thai restaurant I like does.  My husband thought it was good, but said there was something missing.  It was fairly healthy with the lite coconut milk and veggies.  Easy to make especially since you don't have to marinate ahead of time.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was okay. I think it has a lot of potential, though. I would use less rice. I would also use more/different vegetables: broccoli florets, red pepper and, perhaps, baby carrots instead of shredded carrot (which did nothing for flavour nor presentation). The delicate flavour of aspragus was overshadowed by the curry so I will omit it next time (especially since asparagus isn't cheap). Lastly, I would use non-lite coconut milk. I had a can of lite coconut milk and I think it has less flavour. It might be worth the calories to use the real stuff. I look forward to trying this recipe again (with some modifications). We really enjoyed the chicken. It was very moist.

Was browsing for a fun new jasmine rice recipe.  Boy , did I ever find it!! This "dish" has it all! It's a meal-in-one and fit for the most elegant dinner party.  The coconut milk adds such a flavorful addition to all the veggies.  5 stars!!

The recipe was very quick and easy, but as written is very bland.  I would add ginger, garlic, and more curry to kick it up a notch.  It's a good start for an easy thai dish.

This is not to my liking as is.  Super bland.  I hated to waste the whole thing so I added smoked paprika, tandoori seasoning, lemon juice (I didn't have lime or I would have used that), ginger, cayenne pepper.  I kept on tasting and adding.  This made it edible but I'll not be making this again.  I was thrilled to find an easy coconut milk recipe but there is no such thing!  It takes time and lots of ingredients to develop the exotic flavors of good Thai food.

Step 2 should be prepare vegetables because that took about 10 minutes for me. I added about a teaspoon of Tabasco to spice it up a bit but otherwise I didn't change the recipe. I really don't know why people are saying this is bland as it was quite good even with not very fresh ingredients.

Loved this dish!  My family is vegetarian so the only thing I did differently was replace real chicken with frozen "Quorn" chicken breast substitute.  The whole family loved it!  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was a disappointment. The dish is attempting to be a curry dish but the sauce is way to thin and the flavor is way to blnd to be considered a thai dish. However, it was quick and easy.

Great recipe...despite what everyone else thinks, I decided to go ahead and try this one out.  Granted, I wasn't expecting all that much out of it, but it was easier than most Thai recipes I had tried, and much better tasting as well!  I also recommend doubling the curry to 2 tablespoons.  THIS IS A REPEAT RECIPE!

I was somewhat disappointed with this recipe. I was hoping that the ease of it would mean it's our new "Thai recipe" that I've been looking for. But there simply was not a lot of flavor. I also used only a 1/2 tsp of curry paste instead of 1 tblspn of curry powder, since that would be way too spicy for me. I don't know what you could do to flavor this up, but I would just recommend another recipe.

We didn't think this recipe was very good.  Very bland tasting.  Not sure what it needed.  The chicken meat was tender though, just no thai flavoring.

This recipe was SOOOO easy, and was Really good, I did add more curry than the recipe called for, and followed the advice of another, and added some garam masala...but overall this recipe was GREAT!!!  Will make it again.

I doubled the curry as well, also added about 1/2 as much chili powder. for veggies, added broccoli, bamboo shoots, subbed baby carrots for the shredded, and added baby corn. needed more curry, or maybe less coconut milk. it was a decent quick meal tho.

I liked this; however, I doctored it up quite a bit. I precooked the vegetables on some medium heat in some chicken broth before adding the chicken...I was afraid of too-crunchy vegetables. Incidentally, I had no green onions and just chopped up a regular brown onion I had in the pantry. It was fine. I also added some chili pepper and some red chili flakes to the curry powder for an extra kick. Salting to taste is a must. And I merely served it over sticky white rice which turned out just fine. My husband liked all the new and unusual tastes, textures and spices. Good recipe to mix things up!

Great simple and healthy dish for anytime of the year.   I added salt,  pepper to taste but recipe is a great base for those who like to wonder off the main road.

Such a horrid and irreparable disaster of a dish. However, we added cumin, salt, ginger, garlic, sesame oil, beef, pasta, a whole live chicken, a dash of clams, cats, and lots of vodka. The previous recipe had some nutrients. Now we're ready for the Michelin man to come give us a star!

We love curry but straight away, we realized it needed something more.  A touch of salt, cayenne pepper, cumin, black pepper, and dropped some cranberries into the coconut milk.  It was definitely spiced up and balanced with the jasmine rice.

The recipe is a start, but you need to add some kick to it....Being very familiar with Thai cooking, I used yellow round onion in hot oil with a few drops of sesame oil.  A couple cloves of mince garlic an about a teaspoon of minced ginger was thrown in when browning the chicken.   The I added more curry to spice it up a bit and used sliced bamboo shoots in addition to the carrots and snow peas.  This needs sea salt both in browning the chicken and a little at serving time.  Garnished it with Cilantro and Green Onions at serving time as well.  The family loved it...   A side note,  your imagination can enhance any recipe to your taste.   I will make this again.

Not bad once garlic and cilantro were added.  A bit bland otherwise.  I used peas instead of snow peas. Kids didn't exactly love it.

Very average. Too spicy even with a mild curry. I added the ginger and garlic and found it still wasn't very good. No one liked in my family liked this. I won't make it again.

The sauce is very bland and too thin. As advised in the previous reviews, I add garlic and ginger. I also added sesame oil and additional curry powder to toss the chicken in. After trying to reduce, I added a small amount of cornstarch. Still scant flavor. Finally added Thai chili sweet sauce and that made it eatable. Will not make again but will make a green or red curry instead.

Pretty good! I didn't use asparagus or sugar snap peas (frozen peas instead).  I then added water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, fresh mushrooms, a little honey and salt/pepper.  The salt brought out the curry and coconut milk flavors nicely.  Good recipe!  Will use it again!

This was definitely bland.  I added more curry, salt, garlic, and corn starch, but it was still lacking.  The suggestions from other reviewers are very helpful!  It may be time to update the recipe.  Still, it is better-than-average, but definitely not restaurant quality without tweeking.

Good for a quick dinner, but no real coconut flavor. I added a fourth teaspoon of cayenne, and almost-cooked the  vegetables before adding them so they'd be done.

This recipie is extremly easy. The key to the taste is getting the right chili powder..I suggest going to an indian/chinese ethnic store to find the right chili powder. To make this recipie simple buy a simply ready made stir fry mix!

This was really bland.  It needed a lot of salt and something else that we couldn't figure out.
