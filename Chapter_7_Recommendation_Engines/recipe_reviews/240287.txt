I was a little hesitant to try this because It had so few ratings but I made this for my husband last night and he really loved it. The only thing I did differently was I cooked the sauce and chicken together instead of taking out the chicken and pouring the sauce later. I think it allowed the chicken to absorb more of the flavor. Anyway, give it a try because this is a winner!

This recipe has been a classic and is very simple to make. This recipe incorporates all the proper flavors , the white wine being a very nice touch for the sauce. Haven't changed a thing, comes out perfect every time! However sometimes for faster cooking I will use chicken tenders vs chicken breasts.

I made this recipe without dredging the chicken in flour (as I was looking to make a grain free dish).  I sauteed seasoned chicken tenderloins in coconut oil.
I served it over baked spaghetti squash with a little shredded parmesan on top. Both my husband and I found the sauce to be too lemony and/or tart.  However, it was a good base. I will make it again, but next time I will probably cut the lemon in half, decrease the capers and add some butter (which perhaps I was missing because I didn't cook the chicken in butter).
Thanks for sharing this.

My hubby's new favorite dish!! He LoVES the chicken piccata from macaroni grill but he craves this version even more!! Made a few tweaks though to perfect it... when coating the chicken I scrambled up to eggs to soak them in first then placed them moist chicken in a Ziploc bag with the flour, added 1/2 cup Parmesan, 2 tbsp of seasoned salt, and a cup of panko bread crumbs. Once the chicken was done and set aside, I let some mushrooms saut√© right before adding in the rest of the sauce ingredients. To the sauce I added 1/4 cup heavy whipping cream, a touch of the liquid from the caper jar, and a dash of corn starch to thicken it up a bit..... Turned out AMAZIINNGGGGg!!! Thanks for the great recipe!!

I only used one chicken breast and I still have leftovers.  So Yummy!!!  I took that one breast and cut it into 4  thin fillets.  Had no flour so I used Bisquick, worked fine.  Added extra artichokes because I love them so.  Served over orzo and I cooked the parsley since I don't like it fresh.  Will use this recipe again and again...so good.

I tried this recipe tonight. Followed the recipe. My boyfriend and I thought it was way too tart. If you are going to try this recipe I would cut the lemon and capers back significantly.

Very easy and tasty!  I used breast tenders instead of half breasts because they cook fast and brown nicely without needing to be pounded, and I also used Alto del Carmen pisco brandy instead of white wine, because that is what I had on hand.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter and it was perfect.

This came out really well. The chicken was moist and the leftovers were just as good. I added quite a few capers and extra lemon because we like that tart flavor.  I served this over riced cauliflower which was outstanding!

This recipe was so quick and easy. The hardest part was hammering the chicken. I think I'll make this more often.
This will be forwarded to my son. He doesn't cook much, but it's easy, it's quick, and the end results will impress his company.

This has become one of my favorite chicken recipes because it's fast, easy, and tastes great.  Pounding the breasts nice and thin is important and can be done well ahead of time and placed in the fridge between sheets of  waxed paper.  Do not overcook.  Excellent with hot buttered noodles and a fresh green vegetable.

Made this but left out the olive oil, and used 2 Tbspoons butter. I pounded the chicken breast halves between a couple sheets of freezer paper, using a kitchen mallet that was my mom's. It was easy, quick and delicious! I served it with herbed thyme, rosemary and oregano artisan bread from the store, instead of pasta. I'll make this again!

Very easy.  The chicken was moist, but I thought it could have used a little more zing.  I might also thicken the sauce with some corn starch next time.

This was a quick and easy dinner, but I didn‚Äôt  really care for it. I thought it was very bitter and I ended up putting 5 or 6 drops of stevia sweetener in it before serving. Maybe it was the wine...I used what I had open - Pinot Grigio. There are two other chicken piccata recipes on the site that are much better. Since I‚Äôm trying to eat lower carb, I served it over spaghetti squash (as pictured) which ended up being a good idea.

I make this all the time for my vegetarian boyfriend, using Quorn brand or Gardein brand imitation chicken cutlets. This is his favorite dish in the world, and I like it because it is fast and easy. Except for the substitution of plant-based protein for chicken (and note that the imitation chicken does not get pounded flat), the recipe can be made just as it is.

So wanted a recipe for Piccata with capers that used chicken and not veal. I loved this!  I only used two large chicken breast halves. Same amount of flour, butter and olive oil. I cut the wine 1/4 cup, 1/8 cup lemon juice, 1 tablespoon capers, 1 tablespoon garlic. I added 1 teaspoon paprika  and 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon fresh ground pepper to the flour. 
Turned out incredibly well. Will make this over again.
Reminds me of my German experience.

The only change I made was that I added Parmesan cheese to the flour before dredging.

Absolutely delicious!  Tasted like it was from a restaurant, which doesn't happen often with my cooking.  Will make this again and again.

Delicious and easy. Used chicken tenders, served with mashed potatoes and green beans. Should do 3x sauce next time.

I was hesitant to try the recipe because of the few ratings. It is elegant, easy, and inexpensive. I cut the lemon juice by half, used smaller chicken breasts and cut them in smaller pieces,  I tripled the sauce and cooked the chicken in the sauce. Just before serving, I added corn starch to thicken the sauce. Of course I doubled the capers. : )  This recipe is better the next day as leftovers.

I hadn't cooked in an extremely long time, I figured it was about time. I had most of the ingredients which was convenient, it was extremely easy, fast, and tasted equally amazing as it smelled.

I added more wine to deglaze the pan so the sauce wouldn't be too tart, per other reviewers' comments. Using chicken tenders, the meat cooked evenly and in smaller portions which made sharing with the kids easier. We enjoyed this recipe and will make it again.

Yummy! I made this for company and put it over spaghetti squash, like one of the reviewers mentioned- delicious! The lemon makes the dish taste nice and light and the wine compliments it beautifully. I will definitely be making this again!

This is a great recipe.  I like that it goes together so quickly.  Great for a weeknight meal, but fancy enough for company.  We love the taste of capers, it combines beautifully with the sauce and chicken.  The chicken came out tender and moist. Served with mashed potatoes and green beans. Thank you Sandra1980!

This is ok but tastes very pickled. Need to double or even triple sauce.

Very good. Made as written, as I think every review should be based on the recipe as is. Really enjoyed it, wouldn't change a thing!

Will make again.  Fairly simple for a working parent to prepare.  I used frozen chicken tenders (a cheat) and after defrosting tenderized them between two sheets of waxed paper with a mallet.  

I didn't have white wine and used white wine vinegar instead.  The sauce was quite tart so I may cut the lemon next time.

Not quite as good as Chef John's Quick Chicken Piccata. Not sure why. Recipes are very similar. With the size of supermarket breasts these days, I had to double the sauce ingredients just to have enough. I would have cut the breasts in half had I thought of it. They were enormous. It would have fed a minimum of six people with leftovers.

Came out delicious. I usually go for the veal picata when I can find it on a menu out to eat... this matched my favorite (but with chicken of course) and was easy enough to make.
