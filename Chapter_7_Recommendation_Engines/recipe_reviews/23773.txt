Quiche Supreme indeed.  This has become a weekend brunch staple for me.  I have made the recipe several times, with many variations on veggies, meat, and cheese and have never been disappointed.  Its very versatile.  However, two things I think are key to the flavor are the tarragon, and the small splash of vinegar.  I usually double the tarragon because it adds so much flavor to the quiche.  For meat, I've used ham, Jimmy Dean sage sausage, bacon, and leftover rib roast.  For cheese, I've used cheddar, jalapeno, feta, and monterey jack/colby.  I always use fresh mushrooms instead of canned and shallots instead of onions is  a great improvement too.

This recipe is foolproof but Clarke's Quiche recipe from this site is WAY better. This one is rather flavourless in comparison - check out Clark's! You can still substitute anything, but the sour cream/spice/cheeses in Clark's make it an incredible quiche.

This was fantastic!  I halved the recipie (made just 1 quiche for my husband & I).  I also used fresh veggies (mushrooms, g. peppers, onions, zucchini) & ground sausage instead of the ham.  Was super tasty!  Thanks!

Excellent!  I made this for the first time I hosted Easter brunch and it was a hit!  I used Jimmy Dean Sausage, and red and orange bell peppers instead of the green... gave it a little more color and I just like red peppers much more than green.  I also replaced the onions with shallots as another reviewer suggested and used fresh garlic and mushrooms (I added them to the cooked sausage and saute all the vegetable etc together in one pan)  I agree that the tarragon and nutmeg really add the wonderful flavor to this quiche!  Thought I'd freeze the second quiche but it was eaten before it made it to the freezer.  Will make this again and again I'm sure!

I didn't have exactly what the recipe calls for but my substitutions were perfectly fine. This recipe is flexible. A good tip is to sautee your ingredients till they are pretty "dry"...not oily. I put fresh sliced tomatoes on top before baking and it came out pretty.

My family loves quiche and this has quickly become our #1 recipe.  I use the base and vary my "add ins".  I will say that I use one cup of half&half and one cup of whipping cream and it seems to have a better consistency.

Awesome, awesome, awesome! My boyfriend and coworkers thought this was the best quiche they had ever had, and this was my first attempt at a quiche! Woohoo! I did substitute cooked sausage for the ham, which everyone said was a good change. I also cooked the veggies in with the sausage to give flavor. I substituted fres mushrooms for canned because I prefer to use fresh ingredients when I can. Thanks so much for the recipe! I will definitely make this again!

Excellent!  My daughter ate a second piece and my mother-in-law (that is nothing short of a chef) even told me it was delicious, then asked if I bought it.

I made this for my friends daughters brunch the day of her wedding.  My 21 year old son has me make this as often as I can.  It's the best quiche I have ever had.  I don't like eggs, but this is GREAT.

I really can't say enough good things about this recipe.  It gives you a great creamy base and you can make changes to include your favorite meat/veggie combinations.  I've made the recipe as written and also tried it with sausage and zucchini, which are great.  The one change I do recommend is using fresh mushrooms rather than canned.  Be sure to use the "deep dish" pie crusts, or you will have leftover filling.  I love that the recipe makes 2 quiches - I often freeze one to heat up for a quick dinner on a busy weeknight.

The eggs to cream ratio was perfect making a really smooth quiche, used roasted red bell peppers instead of green and added roasted eggplant.  the mix was awesome, took to work with raves!

This is not only easy and delicious, it is also a very forgiving recipe. I forgot the vinegar and realized I had to parsley at the last second. I skipped the mushrooms as well. Didn't matter. You can't go wrong with ham, eggs, and cheese.

Yummy.  I did use fresh mushrooms, shallots and fresh garlic like some other reviewers recommended.   I also used a lot more peppers to increase the veggie content.  Very good - will definitely make again.

We altered the recipe a little bit just because I forgot to pick up a pie crust so we used bisquick which made it's own crust and it turned out tasty. The ingredients of the quiche really went well together and everyone really enjoyed it. It was nice that it made two also since now we have a frozen quiche to pull out some night for a good quick dinner.

While this was delicious I changed it up a bit to suit the taste of my family. First of all I always use fresh ingredients it at all possible so instead of canned mushroom I used fresh and sautéed them, the bell pepper and onion with minced garlic, ruling out the need garlic powder. I double the bell pepper, made sure the onion was small and sweet.  Using a little green, red and yellow pepper is very pleasing to the eye as well as the palet. I left out the vinegar, tarragon and parsley and I grated Fresh nutmeg. I always use fresh nutmeg. That and fresh veggies makes a huge difference. It was a big hit with these changes. Yummy. Oh, I and serve it with a medium salsa.

This is very good quiche and easy to make. I followed the recipe as listed, just leaving out the bell pepper and mushrooms. I might try going a bit heavier on the herbs and spices next time, but my family loved it just the way it is.

This is my husband's favorite thing that I've ever made....so it's become a staple in our household.  I've never had any complaints when serving to guests either!  I use sausage instead of ham and fresh mushrooms.  I like the Marie Callender's frozen pie shells.  They hold together nicely.

This is a great quiche recipe, baked up nice and pretty with a mild flavor that even my picky two year old would eat. I'll probably up the spices a bit next time, but overall a nice recipe!

It was wonderful! I used Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage instead of ham and just cooked it with the onions and other stuff. It was easy to follow and the amount of eggs was just perfect. The quiche was nice and thick and very hearty.  This is my new quiche recipe for life! My family loved it.

Very tasty.  Great consistency.  The ratio of egg to sausage was perfect!  I used half & half instead of heavy cream.  Also used fresh-from-our-farm sausage and eggs.  The sausage was great.  I may play around with cutting 1/2 'n 1/2 with milk to decrease calories so we can enjoy it more often (we have tons of eggs from the chickens).  We'll see what happens.

This was very good! I have two teenage boys that made it a point to tell me to make it again exactly like I did and not change anything about it. This has never come out of their mouths before. I used Marie Callender's frozen deep dish pie crusts which really made this delicious.

I tried this to see if I wanted to serve it to company on Thanksgiving morning.  My family loved it and we will definately have it for the holidays!  I used sausage instead of ham like Carol suggested.

Quite good! I eliminated the mushrooms and substituted bacon crumbles for the ham and added more red and green pepper and onion. Next time I'll throw in some broccoli as well. Really good!

This really is great, although considering there is more cream and cheese in this than egg, it's understandable.  ;)  This is definitely a guilty pleasure quiche and not meant for all of the time, but it was a wonderful addition to our Christmas party a few weeks ago and everyone left requesting the recipe.  I froze the other pie and we'll have it for Christmas breakfast.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used real mushrooms and fresh garlic.  I was skeptical that so few eggs (3 per pie) would actually fill the pie dishes so I actually added one more for good measure, but had WAY too much filling for my 2 deep dish pie crusts.  I'm fairly sure I would have had too much without the extra egg too, but the extra filling made wonderful breakfast sandwiches a couple of days later.  Great recipe and oh so creamy!

This turned out good, unfortunately the Tenderflake crust went soggy on the bottom :( (to no fault of the recipe)  I used fresh mushrooms and extra bell pepper which maybe the juices from the veggies made the crust soggy?  Otherwise the filling was really yummy.  Mine took about 1.5hrs to cook through and get a nice light brown top.  Will probably try this again and experiment with different veggies & cheeses.  I also used 5% cream to try and cut down on some of the calories & fat.

This is fabulous!  We just ate this.  The photo here is my own that I posted to facebook.  It's fabulous!  I used half and half instead of heavy cream and red peppers instead of green.  Delicious, it's a keeper.

Really good!  Took longer to cook than 1 hour (doesn't it always?).  Great flavors, sans mushrooms for personal preference.

This is a really great quiche. I used 6 oz. ham and 6oz. fried bacon. We froze the second quiche for later and look forward to having it.   We served it with Potato Bacon Chowder (found on allrecipes) Spinach Salad With Warm Bacon Dressing and Slices of French Bread. YUMMMMIE!  I like it so much I am sharing left overs with my mom,sister,and Bro-n-law. They gotta try it.  Thanks Prissycat

Great recipe! I shared this tonight with my family. I don't cook all that much and had a taste for quiche. I used the Jimmy Dean sausage. I would add more veggies esp. broccoli next time, but this came out PERFECT! Thanks!

The great thing about quiche is its versatility. You can use your favorite veggies and meat, or no meat at all. Also, different cheeses work well. I liked the flavor combination resulting from these spices. I included the vinegar. For the Monterey Jack portion of cheese, I used a combo of MJ and Colby. I didn't have any tarragon and couldn't  find any in our small town, so that was left out. I put in a good amount of finely chopped broccoli. My husband and I both really liked this. With him taking lunches everyday, the second quiche never made it to the freezer! Reheats well in the microwave. Thank you for this fine recipe.

This was fantastic!!! Best quiche I've ever made n I've made many. One reviewer said Clark's quiche was better. .I disagree. Clark's is good, Quiche Supreme is GREAT. Here are the small changes I made...instead of a regular onion I chopped one bunch of green onions used green part only,no bulbs and 1 shallot, instead of tbsp Bell pepper I finely chopped a whole red pepper. And instead of canned mushrooms I used 8 oz fresh n chopped them into small pieces. The rest of the ingredients I did the same. In the past I have been afraid to try unfamiliar flavors...this combination of season ings was new to me but ABSOLUTE PERFECTION...I even used the vinegar, Apple Cider Vinegar. Your family will love this recipe

Awesome recipe!  I used fresh mushrooms and added cooked asparagus.  Also used sausage crumbles with the ham.  So delicious!  Silly me, though.  When reading the recipe, I thought it was for one pie shell, so I doubled the recipe.  Luckily, I was making homemade pie crusts in 9-inch deep-dish pie plates (which are deeper than the store-bought ones), so all of the filling just barely fit.  Baked at 375 for about 70 minutes.  Perfection!  (Note:  When doubling the recipe, 1 tsp of salt was just right.)

Nice flavor, tweaked the recipe a bit to my taste.. left out green pepper, They're Too flavorful!  Hubby liked it also. Easy to make, most ingredients I think would already be in the kitchen.

Great result! My husband and I were very happy with it. We both went back for second helpings. The only thing I changed is that I used cheddar instead of swiss.

I substituted gueryere cheese for the cheddar because I like a little tangy flavor. Also, I'd plan on checking the pie after 45 minutes. Mine needed another 20-minutes and a 20-minutes rest to firm up the middle.

This was super easy to make.  I made just one quiche and it was awesome.  The only thing I changed was sautéing fresh chopped garlic with fresh portobello mushrooms.  I also added a dollop of sour cream.  Yum! Great basic recipe.  I intend to hold onto this recipe and experiment with other veggies and proteins!

We had this on Christmas morning and it was a huge hit.  Used fresh ingredients and I increased the batch by half again for all of the ingredients so my deep dish pie pans were nicely filled.  I believe this will be a Christmas morning tradition.

Followed the recipe but just added a little extra green pepper and made one of them with a gluten free crust and one crust-less and they turned out awesome!! Not sure that I'd classify it as a quiche since there's only 3 eggs in one pie. Has a nice creamy cheesy consistency and we'll be making this again soon!

I made this quiche crust less.  I used milk instead of cream and shredded zucchini instead of green pepper b/c that's what I had on hand.  I felt that the bake time was off, possibly b/c of my changes.  I thought that it needed some garlic & maybe a bit of roasted red pepper to pull it together.  Will def. make again!

I LOVE this recipe.  I usually make two and freeze one.  I took one on a road trip during our spring break vacation and it was perfect for the little condo we were in.  Saves the effort of having to make breakfast everyday.

I only made one quiche instead of two and made a few changes to the recipe to make it healthier and more flavorful. It turned out amazingly tasty! Instead of the can of mushrooms I used a cup of sliced portabello mushrooms, I only used one cup of fat free mild cheddar cheese, one cup of fat free sour cream, 2 full eggs + the equivalent of two eggs in only egg whites, 4 oz of low sodium cubed ham, no vinegar, no terragon, added a pinch of dill, 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes, a pinch of salt and 2 cups of spinach. Tasty and healthy! It was a success with my husband!

I've never made quiche before, but this recipe was so easy and SO good! Everyone in the house raved about this! Only a couple of changes made- I used half and half because that's what I had and added spinach to the  sautéed onion, garlic,& mushrooms.
Before I pre-baked the pie crust, I added dry beans to the bottom, to keep crust from bubbling.
Great recipe, thank you! I'll use this for a long time!

I call this my "clean out the frig" recipe.  Prebaked one crust last night (halved the recipe) and chopped the veggies.  Baked it all this morning.  55 minutes was perfect.  I had leftovers in the frig-half a bell pepper, half an onion, a small roma tomato and several packages of different cheeses with small amounts that needed to be used soon.  Not much of a meat eater but it was absolutely delicious.  Had for breakfast and again for lunch with salsa.  Perfect!!!  Thanks for sharing.  Will cook many times in the future with whatever I need to use up.

This is the first quiche recipe that I made. I've made it twice. It turned out great both times. The only part of the recipe that I changed, was the seasoning. I only had salt, pepper, and nutmeg on hand. I added marjoram. I served it to my family at a brunch event and it was gobbled up by adults and kids. It is amazing as leftovers. Also - baked it and let it sit on the stove for about 2 hours to cool/wait for the the rest of the meal to finish baking (served with fruit salad and potatoes). It was great cooled. I highly recommend!

I wanted to make a quiche for dinner, not to freeze so I did change this recipe slightly. I did not prebake my crust.  I used milk instead of cream and added fresh broccoli.  It came out VERY tasty.

My husband loved this and I plan on making it a lot.  I did use whole, sliced mushrooms rather than canned and I used low-fat Monterey Jack cheese rather than Colby Jack.  I also increased the amount of green pepper.  Excellent recipe.

I made this for our 4 of July meal!  We loved it.  I did use shallots in place of onion, fresh mushrooms in place of canned and measured 1/8 tsp. of the nutmeg, garlic powder and parsley and increased the tarragon to 1/4 tsp. after reading a review.  It was yummy and I will make again!

Made this yesterday and everybody loved it. Will say that if you're only feeding a few people, cut recipe in half and only make one.

I added a generous “pinch” of spices and the flavor was phenomenal! The filling came out just a tad bit too runny for my liking so I will use just a little less cream next time but otherwise this was fantastic considering it was my first time ever making quiche.

Didn't have half n half or cream or mushrooms, so I used half of a can of condensed cream of mushroom soup with a splash of almond milk. Skipped adding salt as there was plenty in the soup and cheese. Worked great!

I am not understanding when recipe calls for 1 9 in.piecrusts and under directions it says to divide filling into 2 pie crusts.
I find that confusing to say the least.

Family loved this.  Followed recipe, with one change. Used Pillsbury pie crusts.  Also, checked and removed from oven after 45 mins.   Refrigerated for travel and warmed in oven before serving.    Great flavor and texture.

I love it, but I use spinach instead of green pepper. I sauté onion and fresh mushrooms, not canned, and sometimes a little bacon. Add spinach last, Don’t sauté it.

This was a real crowd pleaser. I halfed the recipe and only made one pie and it went so fast I wished I had made both. Probably will add some bacon next time.

Delicious will make again I decided to add 2 more eggs and reduce the cream by half so it wouldn’t be too loose or soft. I actually used milk instead. I think it was perfect. How you like the texture of your quiche dictates how much eggs versus milk or cream to use. I loved that this recipe made extra for the next day. Will make again.

Great recipe, made one for brunch and popped the other in the freezer for another lunch.   Changes I made:  used 10 oz cheese, used half pack of frozen spinach-dried, used one cup of diced ham, used one cup whipping cream and one cup of 1 percent milk, sauteed fresh mushrooms that I sliced thin instead of canned mushrooms.

What a fabulous recipe!!  A definite go-to for a delicious base recipe to add the veggies and/or meats to your tastes!

I used an extra egg, 4 strips of bacon and less of the ham (still 6 oz. of meat), added a bit of sauteed spinach, a whole can of mushrooms and then used 1/2 cup heavy cream and 1/2 cup of half-and-half.  The rest was as written!  

Also, it didn't require 55 minutes - it was ready to remove from the oven in 45 minutes and allowing to rest for 10 minutes outside the oven and it turned out PERFECT!!  Reheats beautifully, too!!  Enjoying a slice for breakfast!

We loved it without any changes.  I think the next time  I would try it with half and half instead of heavy cream so it's not so rich-reason for 4 stars.

Simply Divine!! best I have had :  ) I did not have 2 Cups cream so I used 1 c cream & 1\2 c sour cream & 1\2 c half n half, 
I think the little pinches of spices make this great + the vinegar, I added some leftover home fries cut up also. I had to stop myself from tasting it, I could have ate  half of it easy. 
Oh I did not add tarragon, I am not too familiar with that spice,

Great easy Quiche.  The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly.  Turned out great.  I have made it many times since and sometimes I wing it.  As long as you get the eggs, cream, cheese and tarragon you can't go wrong.  I like tarragon quite a bit so now I put a full teaspoon in.  This recipe is very versatile.  Now I'm trying to cut out the carbs so I just bake it in a dish with no crust.

Loved this recipe and received rave reviews from my guests.  The only change I made was to use half and half instead of heavy cream (simply a mistake when I was shopping) and the texture  was still smooth, creamy and delicious.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Good recipe as a whole, I substituted 1 cup of the heavy cream with sour cream to balance off the richness. Also used fresh mushrooms and and added spinach. I didn't have enough pie crusts so I made the rest into a crustless pie which turned out great too. Texture was good!

pretty darn easy I would say bake it a few minutes longer then you think as the middle was a bit soft despite no "jiggle" And use whatever veggies you have. I mixed chopped fresh spinach with the egg mixture and poured over other veggies..came out great  2 quiches eaten by 4 people in 1 day. I call that a success (or very hungry people)

Loved it, as did the entire family!  I used half and half instead of heavy cream.  I added herbs from my garden (oregano) and added more garlic powder.  Happen to have fresh mushrooms on had, so sauteed those first and added them to quiche.  Came out perfect and I will definitely make this again!  (and again!)  Great recipe!

This was a good quiche, but I had two issues with this recipe - it was done well within the time the recipe stated (I checked at around the 45minute mark and it was already browned and could have come out earlier) and the cheese sank to the bottom leaving a cheese layer just above the pastry layer. Still tasty, but will keep looking for a better quiche recipe the next time I am in the mood for quiche. UPDATE: I decided to give this recipe another chance with some adjustments. I only baked it for 40 minutes which was the perfect amount, I eliminated the Swiss cheese and did half the amount of the other cheese. The result was a quiche still cheesy enough but without a weird cheese layer like the first time. With these changes I would rate this a 4.5 .. Still room for improvement but certainly quite a good quiche.

So, so good!  I like tarragon so I almost doubled the tarragon.  I also cut the cheese in half because I don't like a super cheesy quiche. I made mine with bacon, broccoli, onions, mushrooms, spinach, bell pepper, and asparagus.  Delish!  I'm making another batch to cook, slice, then freeze for individual servings in ziplocks.  Great for breakfast or lunch.

This is now my go-to quiche recipe. I don't change anything except using only fresh mushrooms, various veggies, and no meat. It even won top prize at our potluck at work. People loved that there were only three eggs per quiche saying it was less "eggie-tasting" than most quiches. Thanks!

This is the first time I have made this quiche.  I added spinach and Colby cheese along with the other ingredients to this recipe which was delicious!  I will make this recipe again for Easter.  I baked it for 1hr and 15 minutes since I tweaked the recipe. Overall, I am very proud of my quiche supreme.

This is an excellent quiche!  Some recipes are so wet even after baking for over an hour, but this one firms up so well.  The flavors are so great!  I did use a red pepper, and shallots because I had them at home.  I also use more veggies and less meat just because I love them so much.  If I could give more than 5 stars I would!

My boyfriend claims that while he likes Quiche ..  it's never been a favourite .. until this recipe!! He said it's quite possibly the BEST quiche he's ever tasted. I added about 2 cups of spinach to the mix and some cooked crumbled leftover bacon. It was exceptionally yummy!!

This recipe was delicious! I made it with ham,sausage and bacon and fresh mushrooms. It was my first time attempting Quiche. I was very happy with how good it turned out. I have made many recipes from this site, but I felt the need to log in and rate this one it, it was that good!

We love this.  I cut the recipe in half making only one quiche and when I do this I use four eggs instead of three.  Other than this small change, I have made it exactly as posted and it was good then.  Now instead of a regular pie crust, I mix up everything for one pie, and add 1/2 cup of Bisquick  into the mix and bake as directed.  Served with a Caesar salad for dinner, or biscuits for breakfast, it has become a family favorite!

Delicious. I didn't have cream on hand so I used 1.5 c milk and added 2 eggs and threw in tons of veggies that I had on hand but no meat. Also left out Tarragon only because I didn't have it. Still turned out delicious. My kids asked to eat it again the next day. Lucky for them the recipe made two pies : )

Just made this tonight and everyone loved it.  I doubled the green pepper and halved the onion, and I didn't have tarragon OR nutmeg, but it was still a hit.  I also used half and half instead of heavy cream.

Hey guys!  You don't have to use cream or half $ half for this quiche to be delicious.  I used my 1% organic milk and the custard part was (as my mom used to say) soft as a horses nose ;)  Delicious!  I also always use fresh grated nutmeg - such a difference!  Other changes, sliced tomatoes that have been drained on paper towels to keep from ruining my crust.  I spread a poupon mustard on the crust before I put anything in it.  If you're in a hurry, place slices of cheese on your crust and slices of ham instead of grating or chopping them.  Yum!

This was absolutely amazing. I have been making quiche for a long time and I am so happy I have found this recipe. First, this recipe has taught me the mistake I have made in past was to follow the pie crust manufacturer for cooking times and temperatures, which caused overcooked and dried out crusts. For now on I will follow times and temps specified in this recipe, the crust was so light and buttery. The amounts were also perfect for 2 pies. I didn't have heavy cream so instead used 10% cream and it was great. I also varied the cheese mix based on what I had on hand (2 year old cheddar, swiss cheese, medium cheddar). Once the onion started to caramelize I added the green pepper and ham to the pan. I didn't have dried tarragon and forgot to add the vinegar and it turned out just fine as is. I especially like that this recipe is for 2 pies; I will freeze one for later. THANK YOU!!

First time tasting quiche and I am hooked!!! I adjusted the recipe just a little. I didn't use nutmeg and added more tarragon. My cheese selection was also modified. I used Colby Jack and a Italian blend. Let's just say there is a pie and a half down. Bravo!

I made one with sausage and one with ham. Instead of onion and green pepper, I sautéed pico de gallo and fresh mushrooms in olive oil (and it was *really,* surprisingly good!) I mixed the ingredients together with the Monterey Jack cheese, then separated the mix into two bowls. I added 8 ounces Swiss cheese and ham to one, and I added sausage and eight ounces shredded Mexican cheese mix to the other. Poured them in the crusts, prepared according to the recipe, and baked them. They were both wonderful and looked great as well! Great recipe!

Have made this twice in onc week.  It was a huge hit in our family, (had planned for dinner but never got that far as it was gobbled up for breakfast, lunch, and snacks -- and I discovered empty pie pans awaiting me . . .) Absolutely delicious cold or hot.   Some minor tweaks that I made:  used Jimmy Deans cooked turkey sausage rather than ham, and approximately doubled all the spice quantities.  Quiches always seem to take a long time to cook in my oven, so I cut back the cream to 1-1/2 cups.

Had guest over, and needed to prepare a meal on short notice. This quiche was perfect! Substituted the Monterey Jack with Fontina, but it was just as good. A garden salad on the side, and my own pickled beets as a side complimented the rich creamy quiche. Definitely will use this recipe again!

Love, love, love this recipe.  I just made it again this weekend and doubled it for a crowd- cooked all four in the convection oven and they turned out perfect.  I use fresh mushrooms and omitted the tarragon as I had none.   Great, easy way to serve brunch to a crowd.  I've made berry salad to serve with this the past few times and it was a hit meal.

Delicious! I doubled the vinegar and spices and substituted milk for cream and it still turned out great.

I used Jimmy Dean's Sage Sausage, otherwise followed the recipe and it was delicious! Everyone loved it. Will definitely make again.

A-MAY-ZING!!  I made this for a gathering of youth (12-18) thinking they wouldn't like it...boy was I wrong!!  They devoured it!!  I omitted the mushrooms and added red pepper instead of green.  I also added about twice as much freshly grated cheddar.  Instead of a crust, I used cheese on the bottom!!  YUMMY!!

Have tried it with different ingredients and my family's favorite is mushrooms (fresh), jimmy dean sausage, spinach, green pepper and onion. It is great reheated but I take it out of the pan and set it on cookie sheet to reheat in oven. The crust tends to get too moist if reheated in the pan. Excellent recipe!

Made this this morning. And it is wonderful.  I didn't have tarragon or nutmeg and scaled back the cheese to about 6 oz of cheddar and monterey jack.  It was really great.  Thanks prissycat!

Excellent! I made this receipt not knowing if my husband and son would even like it since they're REALLY picky, but they LOVED it! I was even able to sneak in a little fresh spinach and broccoli. Truly a keeper!

The only tweaks I made were that the chopped ham that I found in the grocery store came in 8oz packets and I couldn’t figure out what I could do with the remaining 4oz so my total ham equaled 16oz instead of the 12oz in the recipe.  Also, instead of 1 tablespoon of green bell pepper, I just chopped up half a green bell pepper.  That being said, the recipe was really good!  It’s always a good sign when you’re mixing the ingredients and you find yourself thinking, “Oooo… this is going to be tasty!” It is a great brunch item and can serve as a quick dinner if you freeze the second pie.  The only thing to note is that my cooking time was a bit longer than the stated 55-60 minutes.  It took me ~70+ minutes for the center to become firm and over 165 degrees (the suggested temperature I found on the internet – I use my food thermometer for everything).  When I inserted a knife in the middle at 55 minutes it was definitely still liquid.

This is the second time I've used this recipe. I really enjoy it as does my extended family. I added spinach and bacon cutting down on the cheese by about 4 oz. My sister had her last chemo treatment today and I am giving her the second pie at her request!
