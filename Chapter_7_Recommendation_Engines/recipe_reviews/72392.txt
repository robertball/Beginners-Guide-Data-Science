VERY YUMMY!  As always-marinate chicken in buttermilk for a few hours before preparing(1cup milk 1tbs white vinegar or lemon juice if no buttermilk on hand)-makes the chicken sooo moist.I cooked bacon half way in skillet and removed.  Then I added the spinach and garlic to the same skillet and cooked down(thanks to a tip from another reviewer). When done I squeezed in paper towels to take out some of the grease.  Then I mixed with sour cream, a combo of mont jack and sharp cheddar cheese, pepper, salt, a little each of curry powder, red pepper flakes and hung paprika for a little xtra zip and rolled into chicken and cooked as directed with the bacon on top.  Worth making.  No leftovers-unfortunately!

Awesomeeeeeeeeeeee dish. Looked like it was from a Gourmet Magazine. We did marinate the chicken in a buttermilk marinade, as a previous user suggested. The bacon turned out great, and we added tons of cheese. Mozzerella, Parm, Feta, etc. We just cooked the spinach as directed on the label, not with the microwave as the recipe suggests. We also actually ended up with a lot of the spinach/cheese-stuffing left over. Oh well. We probably measured something wrong.

One suggestion: There was a ton of bacon grease that was sort of oozing out onto the baking dish when it was in the oven. Most of it got burned onto the baking dish. I'd suggest putting the chicken breasts on aluminum foil and then put that on a baking dish, just to minimize the scrubbing of the burnt bacon grease off the baking dish. 

Very good chicken though. We used a lot of toothpicks, but we probably didn't need to. Make sure you pound the breasts to 1/2 inch so it's easy to roll up too. Bottomline: Tasty, tasty dish. Try it. 5 stars.

After reading all the reviews I simplified the recipe slightly by using about half of a 10 oz. frozen package of spinach (well drained), cut the garlic down by half and added a bit more cheese.  I precooked the bacon for about 4-5 minutes in the microwave and then placed two strips in an "X" over the top of the stuffed breast and tucked the ends underneath - no need for toothpicks.  With 3-4 minutes under a broiler to finish off the bacon and a light sprinkling of more shredded cheese over the top, these were fantastic!  Simple enough to make for the family, elegant enough to serve to company.  Wow!

okay...so the "don't tamper with the recipe" people aren't going to be so happy, but I absolutely loved this recipes but I made a lot of changes.  I added feta and parmesan to the cheese mixture, added sundried tomatoes and mushrooms, onions and fresh basil to the spinach mixture as well as red pepper flakes for a kick.  I also cut back on the bacon and it was still amazing.  Great flavor, chicken was juicy, everyone loved it!

This was very good....I half cooked the bacon.  In the grease, I sauteed the spinach, tomato, and garlic.  I patted some of the grease out as suggested by another reviewer.  I used about a half cup each of mozz. and parmesan cheese.  I also seasoned the chicken breast with seasoned salt and seasoned the spinach mixture with garlic powder, onion powder, Tony's, salt, and pepper.  We had some left over spinach stuff so I put it in a very small baking dish, baked it, and made a yummy dip out of it! :) That was delicious too!!

I made this last night and it looked great, but tasted horrible. Even my husband, who will eat almost ANYTHING hated it.  Neither one of us could eat more than a few bites. The worst part was that it wasn't a quick recipe to make and I wasted a lot of time on it only to have it turn out nasty.  The evening started out with a gourmet-looking meal on our plates and ended with us eating frozen dinners. Sorry...but I won't be making this one again.

Really yummy. I didn't have pepperjack cheese, so I used Monteray Jack instead. I made the full filling amount, but only used 2 chicken breats.(It's just the 2 of us) I didn't have time to fill them, so instead I just mounded the spinach mixture into a casserole dish, and layed the chicken breasts of top, and then covered the chicken with the baccon slices. I cooked it at 350 for about 25 mins, and then finished it off by broiling it for about 5 mins to really crisp up the baccon. Very tasty! The baccon made the chicken SOOOO juicy. I'll make this again for sure. :)

This recipe was great.  I added a little salt to the spinach filling.  Next time I would also season the chicken breasts before filling them.  Overall great recipe.

This was fabulous! I made a couple of changes: I used 1 cup of the pepper jack cheese and I also added 1/2 cup parmesan. I sauteed the spinach and garlic in 1 TBSP butter before adding the other ingredients and I sprinkled a little seasoning salt on the chicken. A little messy to make, but it tastes great!

Ok.....This is what I did and it turned out juicy and yummy. First of all, I poked holes in my chicken breasts and marinated in Italian  Dressing (Walmart brand is actually the best) for 2-3 hours. This recipe makes way to much filling so I bought a smaller bag of spinach. I put my spinach in food processor and just pulsed it down a little. Then I pre-cooked bacon half way (a must) and dried on towel.   I put the spinach in the bacon grease and cooked very fast, just enough to wilt.Remove to bowl. I added all ingredient plus a little cream cheese!  Cook for 35 min and do not broil, as bacon will be fully cooked and crispy! When you broil or turn heat up, this overcooks the chicken. Perfect every time! Juicy, moist, and crispy bacon. Going to add some sauteed mushrooms next time to mixture as well. Enjoy!

This was really tasty, great flavors.  My changes were just 2 large cloves pressed, aged sharp chedder, one piece of bacon per breast and some cushed red pepper flakes for spice.  Really tasty and pretty easy to make w/ great presentation.

This made a lovely presentation.  It wasn't too spicy - my 5-year old gobbled it up.  My teenage son didn't care for the spinach, but ate the chicken.  Next time I might try some other stuffing - perhaps shredded carrots.  Asparagus would be lovely too.  My husband said, "You'd pay $20 for this in a restaurant."  He really enjoyed it.  One note:  don't use colored toothpicks, the color stays on the chicken!  :-)

Most of the 4-5 star reviews seem to have modified the recipe. I followed it exactly and found it lacking. First, after microwaving the fresh spinach, adding the sour cream and pepperjack cheese while still hot turned it to liquid. Spooning the mixture onto the chicken left most of the liquid in the bottom of the bowl. The flavor, which has a nice kick from the pepperjack, is in the liquid. Also, the list of ingredients mentions pepper, but the directions do not specify where it is used. It seems redundant to add pepper to the spinach mixture what with the pepper jack cheese, so I sprinkled it over chicken/bacon wrap. Finally, cooking at 375 for 35 minutes, plus 5-10 at 500 to brown the bacon left the chicken dry. Following this recipe exactly produced a fairly bland dish as all the pepperjack flavor remained in the liquid at the bottom of the bowl.  Were I to make it again, I'd let the spinach cool completely before adding the garlic, sour cream and pepperjack. Also, I'd reduce cooking time to 30 minutes and broil until browned rather than bake at 500 for 5-10, to leave the chicken more moist.  I'm the husband of a HS Home Ec / Foods teacher, and do the cooking 5 nights a week. This recipe is a keeper and I will try it again but it needs a little more finesse than my man's literal approach to cooking. ;^)

On another note...other reviews are giving this recipe 5 stars with all their changes. This isn't about 'lets see who can change someones recipe'. If you made so many modifications, then the recipe becomes your's, not the original submitters. Make it and rate it without all the add hoopla people!!

This was incredible-though with us being Italian, I made an Italiano version ;) I used ricotta instead of sour cream (make sure to strain the water out of both the spinach and the ricotta so it won't run), mozzarella instead of pepperjack, and prosciutto instead of bacon. It was delicious! Next time I think I may include a thinly sliced section of eggplant inside the chicken as well. Try it out! (We also watch our calorie intake, so lower fat versions of the above mentioned products were used and it was delicious!)

What an excellent recipe! Made it for the first time last night for myself and my beau. Did change a few things: First off, I used 3 chicken breasts instead of four (soaked in buttermilk beforehand as suggested by others) and reduced the other ingredients. I used approx. 5 oz. of fresh spinach, a few white mushrooms, and 4 large garlic cloves minced, all sauteed in the bacon grease after half-cooking the bacon in a skillet. For cheeses, I used parmesan, asiago, monterey jack, mozzarella, herbed feta, and a little mild cheddar. For seasoning, I added a little seasoning salt to the buttermilk soak; beyond that, I salted the mixture and added black pepper, fresh basil, and a little red pepper. Added about a heaping tbsp. of sour cream, and that was enough. Wrapped up as directed with two slices of bacon per pounded breast, fastened with 4 toothpicks each. The cooking time was perfect (375 degrees for 35 minutes, plus a couple minutes of broiling). 

The chicken turned out moist and delicious and was served with a side of steamed asparagus, french bread and wine. :)  Will make again!

After reading other reviews regarding this recipe being a little bland I made some revisions that made all the difference. I sauteed the spinach in a little olive oil and 1/2 tablespoon of minced garlic. I also used asiago, parmesean, and mozzarella cheeses instead of the cheddar jack cheese. I burshed the chicken with bottled Italian salad dressing prior to stuffing and rolling (a little messy) this adds flavor and keeps the chicken moist. Many have suggested using buttermilk for this purpose however buttermilk does not add anything to the flavor of the chicken. I also substituted by wrapping 2 slices prosciutto instead of wrapping in bacon. This made a wonderful gourmet main dish that I would serve to company. My family loved it and and will make this again with these revisions. Nice base recipe.

Very good but unless you like soggy, uncrisp bacon, i would recommend cutting the bacon in half and just placing it on top instead of wrapping it around the chicken. The bottom obviously did not crisp up.But other than that i thought it was very good. It was very pretty after being sliced.

My family absolutely LOVES this recipe and I pass it along to every one I know! The only things I changed to stick to my diet was I used low fat Mozzarella cheese, fat free sour cream and Turkey bacon. Every bit as good, just a bit healthier on the heart!

terribly dry and lacks flavor.  Has lots of potential though.  I highly reccomend generously seasoning chicken breast with salt and pepper.  Season spinach mixture, and add more cheese than whats called for.  Keep an eye on the chicken because cooking time does vary.  I think mine was done at about the 25 minute mark.  I also recommend the sauce that other commentors suggested making.  This is a really beautiful dish, just needs some additions in my opinion.  I will try this one again...like I said, it has lots of potential.

GREAT!!! Butterflied breasts & filled, didn't pound so didn't have to roll. Cooked bacon 1/2way & used some drippings to saute spinach & added sliced mushrooms & finely chopped onion. Criss-crossed bacon over top & only used 1 slice for each breast. Made for husband's boss with baked carrots & peas w/ pearl onions, were IMPRESED!!! So good I made again 2 nights later. One for my son only used cheese & bacon, he loved it!!!

I've tweaked this recipe a handful of times and finally have it to the way I love! I let the spinach dry COMPLETELY before microwaving and add some crushed red pepper to the spinach mixture for a little more kick. I season my chicken with a little seasoned salt, that pinch of ground black pepper and a pinch of garlic powder. My grocery (when I don't feel like driving all the way to the meat market) carries chicken breast halves in 3's (so annoying!!) so I started getting the chicken breast tenderloins, which are already a little less than a 1/2 inch thick. So rather than having 4, I end up with 6-8 smaller chicken pieces. I started using the Oscar Meyer ready made bacon (the kind that is ready in 20 seconds in the microwave) and microwave it for 10 seconds before wrapping it around my chicken. This way, the chicken is done, not dried out, and the bacon is crispy, all without having to crank my oven up! 
Hope this helps someone along the way!

OMG!!! let me tell uuuuuuuu! my chicken came out so good.....and i was so proud of it. other reviews called it bland and others said they didn't like the spinach. but u have to remember to stuff it with what you like and season ur chicken. i seasoned mine with accent, blk pepper, and poultry seasoning. i also recommend the hormel black label bacon it crisps very well all the way through. i made a little on the side just in case. the temps were right and everything cooked to a T. Thank you for who ever came up with this recipe!!!

My fiance and I both loved this recipe. I did make some changes based on other's reviews and based on our preferences. I cooked the spinach in the bacon grease as suggested, and added about 3 large cloves of garlic. We love garlic! I omitted the sour cream, simply because we didn't have any. I also used mozzerella instead of pepperjack cheese. Once everything was ready to go, I topped the chicken with parm and baked. It was delicious!

DEFINITELY a keeper!  Since my guys do not like Pepperjack cheese, I opted for swiss cheese.  WONDERFUL flavor!  Cannot wait to make this again!

Great recipe! We marinated the chicken in buttermilk as suggested. Added mushrooms to the spinach mixture. Used turkey bacon to cut fat. Served with red pepper risotto. YUM!

5 stars for this one!!  It was wonderful.  I broiled on low for 15 minutes at the end because I like my bacon extra crispy.  Tip from me is to add a little lemon juice on top of the breast before cooking.  Then, before broiling put some shredded parmesan cheese.  Delicious!!

We enjoy this recipe and the flavors are good, but the bacon is soggy. Even under the broiler it does not crisp up and if it does the chicken becomes dry. To remedy this, I wrap the bacon around the chicken and sear it in a hot pan. Then put it in the pan for baking.

Delicious!  My husband and I enjoyed this very much.  It made a very elegant meal, full of flavor, and very easy to make.  The only changes I had made were, I didn’t use the bacon, I fried the spinach mixture in a tad bit of olive oil (instead of cooking in the microwave) and I added a couple diced mushrooms to it.  It turned out wonderfully!  Will definitely make this one again!

This was very good, but needed just a little more seasoning for the chicken.  I added paprika, salt, pepper, sliced almonds (for extra texture) and cheddar cheese to the spinach mixture.  Next time I will toast the almond slices before putting them in.  During the broiling process, I added a mix of pepperjack, parmesan, and yellow cheddar cheese to the top.

Awesome.  The only change I made was due to time + what I had on hand: 3 chicken breasts, 1/4 cup of grated parmesan (in addition to the pepperjack, which was probably 3/4 to 1 cup).  I ended up adding the spinach + mix to a food processor and giving it a fine chop so everything mixed well together.  I halved the breasts after flattening them (we had a group of 5 for dinner!), and also marinated those in Italian dressing since I didn't see the reviews until late that recommended soaking the chicken in buttermilk, but wanted to keep the chicken moist.  The final product wasn't as pretty as the photo, and the dressing (marinated for 2 hours) kept the chicken from drying out completely, but I'd like to try the overnight-buttermilk method, too.  BUT, overall, awesome.  (PS: I also put the remaining spinach mix in a small corningware dish, sprinkled it with grated parmesan, and it was a fantastic spinach dip appetizer ;) -- whoo, double duty!)

Cook bacon til crisp, them crumble and set aside.  Saute spinach is bacon grease, then mix with sour cream, cheese and dried pepper flakes.  Put spinach mix in casserole, top with chicken, top with sour cream mixed with cheese and top with crumbled bacon.  Bake at 350 x 30 min.

Delicious and perfect for company, but you can cut the amount of filling you need to make in half.  You end up with a lot of wasted filling otherwise.

This was a lot easier than I thought it would be!  Looks elegant, tastes great, and looks like I spent a lot of time on it.  I used frozen chopped spinach and low-fat sour cream.  Couldn't really taste the pepper-jack cheese, so I'm not sure I'll put that in again.  The bacon made it smell great while baking.  I brushed the top of the chicken with olive oil so it cooked up a nice golden color.  The drippings made a great and tasty sauce.  Served with brown rice and Buttery Cooked Carrots (from this site).  My hubby said this was on the top 5 list!

My family loved it and it was easy & fairly quick. I didn't have pepperjack, so I used sharp cheddar. I honestly didn't believe the filling would stay in the rolled chicken, since I lined the pan with parchment. I was pleasantly surprised about the filling, but clean up was a snap. This is going to be a future go-to dinner.

Excellent recipe! First of all, the cooking time listed in the recipe is spot on, which I totally appreciate. My changes: halfway cooked the bacon in a pan, took the bacon out of the pan and sauteed a diced onion in the bacon grease, then added the fresh spinach to the pan to wilt it. Sprinkled the chicken breasts with garlic powder before rolling the spinach mixture inside. Also added feta cheese to the spinach - it was fabulous! I ended up sort of draping the bacon over the chicken, and it worked perfectly. The spinach mix didn't ooze out, and it kept it's rolled up shape. Hubby loved it, and I would definitely make it again.

Love, love, love this recipe! Although I did substitute for the pepper jack , I used mozzarella and cheddar and also added some red bell pepper and a jalapeno along with the spinach. This is one of my favorite things to cook! :)Goes great with mashed cauliflower.

Made this last night and it was DELISH!!!  As with any recipe, I used the given recipe mixed with others comments / suggestions, and came out with an amazing meal.  Cooked my spinach w/ mushrooms and onions, with red pepper flakes and nutmeg.  Did a mix of sour cream / cream cheese b/c I didn't have enough of either seperately.  Added motzeralla and parm. cheese at the end.  

Chicken / Bacon was a little soggy on the bottm, probably from just laying in all liquids, probably will cook on a rack next time, the way I do my oven baked chicken.  

Also, I highly suggest lining your pan with tin foil . . . super easy clean up.

Served the dish over rosemary and olive oil quinoa.  Oh, and if you have any left over filling DO NOT TOSS IT.... mix it with pasta for a quick week night dinner.

Delicious!  Although since my husband doesn't like sour cream - I substituted with 1/2 block of cream cheese - also, I melted down 5 sardines in olive oil with some crushed red pepper - cooked the garlic in this - then added 4 of the slices of bacon chopped - cooked until bacon done - then wilted the spinach, I then mixed this with the cream cheese, as well as some parmesan, romano, and asiago cheeses - I took a previous reviewer's comment and used pasta instead of tooth picks to keep it all together! Great recipe, will hopefully use again

Oh My Goodness! This recipe is amazing!! I am always trying to find ways to make chicken seem "new"...mission accomplished! I didn't have to change a single ingredient and the only change I made to the prep was to zap the bacon in the microwave for 3 min prior to wrapping and that I wilted the spinach with the garlic in a saute pan with a little butter. This recipe satisfies my need for the kids to eat healthier and their need for bacon! I love it~

This was a great recipe, although I didn't follow it exactly. I stuffed the chicken as the recipe suggested but used a combination of cheddar and parmesan because thats what I had on hand. I added extra seasoning on the outside - a bit of cayenne, garlic, onion powder, thyme, sea salt and pepper. I also marinaded it in a combination of milk and lemon juice for an hour - as a previous user suggested. It turned out so tasty and moist. I think it may have been too plain if the extra seasoning wasn't added.

I think this recipe is great but two things did not care for. Might be a personal preference. I don't like the greasy half cooked bacon thing in any recipe. So after trying the recipe as written first I added chopped bacon to the stuffing mixture instead of wrapping it around the chicken. Also found the chicken itself to be a bit bland so I marinate it first with balsamic vinegar, oil, garlic and pepper. Love the vinegar taste with the spinach and bacon. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

These went over very well!  I didn't wrap them in bacon, to save calories...they don't need it anyway, they're yummy!  I also used regular cheddar cheese and only one clove of garlic.  I will make these again and maybe try broccoli, and fat free sour cream...and other variations!  Yum!

Great recipe.... I did adjust the second time I made it with adjusting salt and cheese. I used fresh spinach, no sour cream. Instead I did spinach with the garlic, black pepper turkey bacon(cut into small pieces) and 4 slices of munster cheese in the stuffing. I did cook it on the stove top with 2 table spoons of cream of chicken and 1/4 cup of water. once it was cook i put the left over filling on top of it and broiled it for 3 minutes and the grave left I put it on a side of small white potatoes.

Very good basic recipe, next time I will definitely pre cook the bacon, and probably use the bacon grease for flavor. I'll have to experience with seasonings though

I had to make one change..I used the tops of swiss chard in place of spinach and cut the recipe in half but the results were still amazingly good.  Hubby almost licked his plate again.  Many thanks for a lovely keeper.

I followed directions and this came out perfect. The bacon was a bit much. Next time I will try it without. And I got my husband to eat spinach!

So good! My husband wished I had made more! I advise cooking the bacon partway before wrapping. I did not use toothpics either, I hand none!, but it turned out just fine to fill the breast and wrap the bacon and place it in the (foil lined!)dish. It made for such easy cleanup. I also slightly breaded the chicken...rubbed olive oil on them and padded breadcrumbs mixed with some italian seasoning to give the chicken more flavor. Delicious!

I have had and made many different stuffed chicken recipes with spinach, and found this to be equally as good if not better than most.  I did use ham instead of prosciutto, but ONLY because I forgot it at the store!  I will make it again with prosciutto, as that will be the perfect touch.

This chicken was good and will probably make it again.  I have made a stuffed chicken breast before with ricotta cheese and more of an italian flare. I used frozen creamed spinach with sour cream, garlic and mozzarella and parmesean cheeses.  I did cook my bacon  a little as suggested by others so when placed in the oven would be crispy.  My husband really liked it as well.

These turned out very well! They really had great flavor... spinach, bacon, and chicken work so well together. I added fresh, chopped mushrooms to the spinach mixture. Instead of nuking the spinach, I sauteed it, along with the garlic and mushrooms, in a bit of olive oil. Great dish, thank you :)

This was good, but a the chicken was a bit dry on the ends.  I added some sour cream, onion and breadcrumbs to the filling and that was good.  Will try again with other suggestions.

Oh yeah, this was a HUGE HIT!  Didn't have sour cream so I nervously substituted cottage cheese and instead of pepper jack, only had colbyjack on hand.  Other than those two substitutions, followed the recipe as it is written.  According to my husband, it was outstanding!  He RAVED about it and it even earned me a massage! :D Yeah, I'll be making this again!! LOL!

I followed this recipe to a T and I must say it was quite bland, needed salt for sure.  The bacon didn't cook all the way so I would suggest cooking it a little before wrapping the chicken with it.  It was an impressive dish but just too bland for my taste buds, and my husband.

this is delicious and open to interpretation which i like...i have trouble following ANY recipe to the "T"! one of the only changes i made to this one, however, is that instead of going through the trouble of pounding and rolling the chicken, i just cut a pocket into the breasts and stuffed them, then wrapped with bacon etc. This was WAY easier for me, and although i would probably pound 'n' roll if i was making it for company, i prefer this method for a weekday supper. And yes. Marinate in buttermilk first....good tip, whoever mentioned that!

Some reviews found the chicken bland and I think the secret to that is add 1tsp salt to the mix or rub into chicken, add cayenne pepper as well. My hubby loved this one even though I over cooked it. It still came out great. Used butter milk to soak, and cook bacon a little before wrapping, but it shrinks so harder to wrap.

This was so the bomb!  I did make some changes.  I first sauteed fresh spinach with a can of spinach because the fresh spinach wasn't enough.  Then I added paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, & cayenne pepper to the seasoning along w/ everything else.  Instead of stuffing chicken breast with the mixture, I spread it at the bottom of my pan, then added the chicken(both legs and chicken breast tenders)evenly on top.  I then cut up my bacon and placed that in a layer on top and baked.  It was so, so good!  I am an amatear cook, but this recipe made me feel like a pro!  Will definitely make it a family meal!

Fabulous! I have made this for several dinner parties, and it is always a hit. I have had trouble getting the bacon to crisp, however; otherwise, no complaints. I have been using low fat pepperjack,and low fat sour cream, without affecting the taste. I have also used frozen spinach, very well drained. It is easier and less expensive, and still has the same great flavor when mixed with everything else. I like to make a huge batch at one time, and freeze half to be cooked at a later date date.

awesome awesome awesome!!!  my picky 8 year old who frowned when he saw spinach was the first to ask for seconds!!!  i did use monterey/colby cheese and a pack of frozen chopped spinach squeezed dry.  i also just used pre-cooked bacon...added for the last 5 minutes and topped with more cheese and broiled.  i also added dash of salt to spinach and lawry's to chicken.  Beautiful presentation and just as delicious...thanks much!!

Soooo good and easy!!  I made this the other night and the only leftovers were from us stuffing ourselves too much!  I went by some other recomendations and used a LOT more cheese and added a package of sun dried tomatos.  I also marinated the chicken in a bottled lemmon-herb marinade.  Very easy and only one bowl and baking dish to clean! Awesome!

I made this recipe for a dinner party and it went over really well. I found I didn't need to really pin the bacon with toothpicks if I crossed the bacon in the shape of an X. I took two opposing strips, crossed them and then put a second crossing over top, and it all stayed secure and didn't fall out or apart when I took them off the pan. Good recipe, good food, good times.

The texture, color, and taste were outstanding.  One of the best! Because I didn't feel like stuffing the chicken, I used Perdue Chicken breast,thin cutlet style. Briefly, browned them in saute pan and then laid them on top of spinach mixture in a baking dish.  Laid ready cooked bacon (1 1/2  strips) over each and sprinkled a little more cheese on top.
Recipe was the same except I did the lazy version.  It is delicious.  Ditto from my husband. Thanks,

Always looking for something a little different for stuffed chicken breasts and this one is great! I substituted frozen chopped spinach (Microwaved and squeezed dry), Mozzarella and a small amount of finely minced fresh jalapenos (had so many from my garden) Used slightly more cheese and less spinach then called for, and added a little crumbled chicken bouillon to the mixture for extra flavor. My family loved it and it's an easy "prepare ahead" and bake later dish for company.

This is delicious.  I would use more pepperjack and a teeny bit more sour cream to make the chicken not so dry.  I may have had to over cook it to get the bacon cooked through.  Will make again for sure.

I thought that this recipe is just okay.  I thought that the chicken was a little tasteless.  It was really missing something, a nice sauce to cook in and put over the chicken after cooking.  It would have really helped to improve the taste I think.  I thought that the stuffing was also just okay.  All and all I don't think that I would make this recipe again, although it was interesting to try.

I made this for some friends and it was a great presentation.  Very easy to make and very good tasting.  Next time I will put some seasoning on the chicken becaus it was a little bland and I will add more cheese.  Otherwise it was great!

I made this recipe as is and it was great.What really annoys me about this site is i read at least 35 reviews of this recipe without one of them actually following the recipe.Guess what if you add a different cheese,adding mushrooms or half cook the bacon first etc you are not reviewing this recipe you are making up your own.I end up seeing two review side by side giving the recipe 5 stars yet they are reviewing completely different tasting dishes with different ingredients and cook times which have nothing to do with the recipe they are reviewing.
So please please either review the recipe or create your own and post it.

First I will say this, I am not a cook AT ALL. But I am learning bit by bit. I just made this recipe and I must say it is delicious. I added some salt to the spinach mix, and some salt pepper and seasoned salt to the chicken. I was scared the chicken would be overcooked or dry, but wow the bacon fat cooking over the chicken made it soooooo juicy. Next time I may add some other ingredients to the mixture, maybe some mushrooms or something. Thanks for this recipe. :)

Delicious! Made a few changes but overall it's a great recipe! I marinated the chicken breasts in milk while I chopped up the spinach in a food processor (very recommended). I quickly sautéed spinach with a tbsp of butter then mixed with 1/2c skim ricotta, 4 cloves of garlic minced, 2oz herbed feta, and spiced with salt, pepper, paprika and a pinch of cayenne to add a little kick. I butterflied the chicken and spooned in the mixture and closed with toothpicks. I spiced the top of the chicken and placed in a glass baking dish. Baked as directed for 35m and it was perfect! I sprinkled a little lemon juice on at the end and served with some roasted broccoli! It was a hit :)

A nice change of pace. I used 10oz package spinach, well drained, and high quality pepperjack (sliced and placed on top of spinach spread before rolling). Next time I make this, the only change will be to reduce the oven bake time by about 10 minutes. Plan to still broil to brown the bacon (1pc each extra thick cut)for ~5 min to crisp up slightly. Thanks!

I really loved this recipe. I changed a few things up on it though. I flattened out my chicken breasts to the appropriate thickness and then seasoned them with some garlic salt and onion powder on both sides and then a little red chili pepper on the inside. I took my minced garlic and spread it out on the inside as well and then let the chicken breasts sit in the fridge for a couple hours. I also agree that the bacon should really be cooked a little before putting it in the oven. The top got cooked pretty well, but the bottom was a little chewy still. Over all, great flavor my husband loved it.

This recipe is simple yet delicious. I didn't have boneless/skinless and ran out of toothpicks so I had to improvise a bit. My revisions were as follows: 1. I half cooked the bacon to avoid turning up the oven to 500º; 2. I used a little of the bacon grease and cooked the baby spinach until it wilted; 3. I substituted with havarti jalapeno cheese;  4. I had some pretty large breasts so I cooked it for 1 hr at 375º.

Deeeeeelish!!! I soaked the chicken in buttermilk, salt, and pepper for a few hours. I cooked the bacon halfway also in a pan first. I cooked the garlic, spinach, and some red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper all together in the pan until wilted. I also soaked the excess liquids from spinach with paper towels. Served with roasted potatoes, green beans, and garlic bread. Awesome recipe and filled up my whole family's bellies! Yum!

A great taste. The amount of cheese is perfect, just enough to accent the spinach. I prepared it over a bed of fettuccine  Alfredo with a side of mashed potatoes accompanied with a glass of chardonnay; exquiste

This recipes was simple to make and simply delicious.  I would highly recommend it as a dish to serve company.  I will make it again.  I did add alittle bit of cayenne powder for flavour but other than that, I kept the recipe the same.  One suggestion is...instead of using toothpicks, use spaghetti.  It slides through easily and you do not have to worry about pulling it out and it cooks through and blends into the dinner.  Very unnoticable.

Love it! Love it! Love it! The first i made this stuffed chicken i followed the recipe. the only thing i changed was the bacon. I used turkey bacon, because i don't eat pork. It was delicious. My husband loved it too. I make it a lot now. But i started improvising. I put whatever cheese i have in my fridge and i put mushrooms, green onions, asparagus or whatever else i have handy. Thank you very much for sharing this recipe!!!

I was able to adapt this recipe for my picky daughter who is allergic to dairy by using soy cheese and Toffuti cream cheese.  She liked it so much, she had it again for lunch the next day, and would have had it for dinner again if there was any left!  I also cooked the spinach with onions and garlic in a saucepan with olive oil instead of in the microwave.  It think this also adds more flavor to the spinach.

LOVE this recipe! i've made this a few times and every person thats tried it has loved it too! made a few changes to it as well. i used thin sliced chicken breast instead. i worried about it drying out so instead of wrapping them with two pieces of bacon i used three. i found that it kept it all together very well and kept the chicken juicy. i cooked the chicken for only 30 minutes rather than 35. Broiled on high for 5 minutes. came out perfect! i added a lil salt to the filling and used cheddar and swiss cheese instead. Delicious!

I love this recipe. I don't change anything except I use jarred minced garlic just because I always have it and it's easier. And sometimes I just use frozen spinach cause I also always have that. It's such a beautiful dish. It's pretty easy to make for the most part. If your looking to make a dinner to impress, make this! Looks like an expensive dish and is sooo tasty! One of the boyfriends favorites! and mine ;)

I sauteed the spinach with mushrooms, onion, and garlic.  I then mixed that with cheddar cheese and the rest of the ingredients.  I eliminated the bacon all together because my family isn't a big fan.  So instead I chose to bake the chicken in some cream of mushroom soup.  Served it with rice and family loved it.

A delicious recipe to use as a base; came together very quickly. I tweaked slightly... I sauteed the garlic in a skillet, which is where I then wilted the spinach and mixed the sour cream and (Monterrey Jack) cheese. I chose to cook the bacon in a skillet, rather than in the oven. My bacon was frozen, so it would've taken a bit longer...especially since I prefer to par-cook the bacon before wrapping it around the chicken so it gets crispier when baking. I also topped with a couple slices of tomatoes, which I love roasted. The only recommendation I'd have is to season the chicken a bit more. I used a smokehouse seasoning but it needed a bit more. Loved how easy it was; served with corn on the cob for an easy dinner.

It was a little messy to make (probably due to over stuffing the chicken), but very delicious and filling. Made the following tweaks based on previous suggestions: marinated in buttermilk and used a combo of mozzerella, feta & parm cheese instead of cheddar). Also, I used fresh spinach and prepared it and the garlic as I do for a sauteeing recipe. Even after it was cooked, the filling was a wee bit runny-- tasted fine-- it just oozed out and wasn't as "solid".

Great recipe. I used gouda and some mozzarella instead of pepperjack, because that's what I had on hand. Still delicious. I had some leftover spinach mixture left, which went great on pork chops the next night!

This was quite tasty! I used feta because it was what I had and I knew it paired we'll with spinach. I also added about a quarter tsp red pepper flakes to the stuffing. I was planning on using the full amount of spinach but upon opening my fridge discovered I had only 5oz. I used it, keeping the other amounts on the rest of the ingredients the same. I'm glad I only had 5oz because 10 definitely would have been too much for 4 half breasts. Like other reviewers I half cooked the bacon before wrapping the chicken. I think next time I will bake the chicken about 10 min less than the reccomended time because it was a little dry which is probably due to my oven. My family loved the finished product (I have 3 kids ages 2, 3 and 5). I will definitely be making this again! Thanks for sharing!!!

I used chive flavored creme cheese in place of the sour cream.  I also had some left over long grain and wild rice which I added as well.  This was a winner.  Will keep it and serve for company.

It was good for a baked chicken dish. My boyfriend loved it (probably because of the bacon!) but I wasn't as in love with it. The chicken was a bit overcooked and I only had it in for 30 mins and broiled for 3 mins. 

I'm only giving it 3 stars because I added shredded mozzarella cheese, onion powder, salt, and lots of crushed red pepper to the stuffing mixture. I think it would have been really bland without it.

It paired nicely with a fresh salad with cherry tomatoes, feta cheese, and sun-dried tomato vinaigrette.

I added addional cheese, salt, and some crushed red pepper flakes to add to the flavor of the spinach.  My husband wasn't a huge fan since he isn't a spinach fan.  I enjoyed it, but it still needs some perfecting.

This recipe was very easy; a little messy, but so worth it! I added tomatoes, onions, and red peppers. I also seasoned with a little accent salt and seasoning salt. The bacon was honey, so it added a sweet outer taste to accentuate the inner taste! I LOVED THIS!

Not a good balance.   It needs more cheese and less garlic.  The spinach should be wilted in a pan with a little olive oil and salt.   The microwave gave it a strange flavor and odor.   It was worth a try and a good learning experience.

I loved this recipe.  I didn't change a thing and it was as delicious as it was appealing to look at!  It was easy and all the ingredients are something I usually have on hand!  I offer one tip, lay the bacon down, then the chicken.  It makes wrapping much easier.

This one got oo's & ah's from my family because it looked so fancy. It was pretty tasty too. I used frozen chopped spinach, fat free cream cheese, sharp cheddar & turkey bacon. Very simple to put together and a great make-ahead meal.

First and foremost, Thank You for Sharing. The presentation was pretty, but the dish lacked flavor. The garlic was the only saving grace. For all the prep, it just did not stand out in the flavor department. Something is missing.

This was delicious!  My husband LOVED it and said that we should serve it for guests, since it looks so impressive and tastes amazing.  I made a few modifications after reading some of the reviews.  I used cream cheese instead of sour cream.  I doubled the amount of monterey jack cheese.  I was afraid of the chicken becoming dry, so I poked holes in the chicken with a fork and marinated it in balsamic vinaigrette for two hours.  I also fried the bacon halfway before wrapping it around the chicken, so that it would be crispy.   The only thing that I would do differently next time is that I would wrap the bacon in an X around the chicken, as another reviewer suggested; I think this would make the presentation look more tidy.  There was a lot of filling left over, so we chilled it and used it as spinach dip with pita chips.

This was a huge hit! This chicken came out perfect and so moist! I absolutely love this and wouldn't change a thing except for I used two pieces of bacon per chicken breast to ensure the whole breast was covered. My family doesn't even like spinach and the can't stop talking about it.

Made tonight... excellent! I used frozen spinach instead of fresh, but other than that followed the recipe as written. At the end of the bake, I broiled for 3 minutes on each side to crisp up bacon. Turned out amazing! Thank you!

Great recipe!  I added my own twist by butterflying the chicken breast and marinating in some olive oil, red pepper flakes, dash of liquid smoke, and grated fresh garlic overnight.  I sauteed spinach, red onion, and chopped baby bella mushrooms to use as the filling, along with a 1/2 c of mozzeralla.  I'm on a low carb, low sodium diet, and this is a great twist for those who are watching sodium, carbs, and fat.  Thanks Jerseygirl_chell for giving me the base for a fabulous dinner - presentation AND flavor!

What a great, fairly easy dinner for two. Easy to scale up or down for guests. I didn't have pepperjack, so I used colbyjack. Didn't have the same kick, but was delicious still. Very versatile as you can add various spices and herbs, choose your cheeses, and put all kinds of add-ins with the spinach (pine nuts, tomatoes, onions, peppers, etc.)   My only gripe was that I should have drained the spinach after heating, before adding the sour cream and cheese. I used fresh spinach...looks like others tried frozen. I am sure the drainage was an issue either way.   All in all...great dinner!

This was pretty good, and I will certainly make it again but with a few adjustments. I cooked the bacon for a few minutes in the skillet, and then I wrapped it around the chicken. The result was a dish that was in need of salt! Lesson learned. Next time I'm going to make this with fresh Parmesan, Romano, and mozzarella cheeses in place of the pepper jack. I also think the spinach mixture could use a little extra garlic. I didn't have any problems with the chicken being dry, but I am going to try the buttermilk marinade next time.  I did use frozen spinach in place of fresh, which is fine, you just have to make sure to thoroughly pat the spinach dry. Thanks for a tasty and very presentable recipe. I can't wait to try some different cheeses with it!

Very Very Good!  Marinated the chicken in lemon juice.  Cooked the bacon half way in skillet.  Sauted the frozen spinach with garlic in the bacon grease. Then mixed sour cream, salt, red pepper flakes and a variety of cheeses together. Add the spinach.   Stuffed the breast topped with bacon. These tips were combined from other readers.

This was really yummy!!! I made exactly as the recipe was with the exception of the bacon...which probably would have made it even better!! My only problem was it smelled wonderful & garlicy while cooking...but you couldn't taste the garlic much so I will add more next time! Overall great meal :-)

pretty darn good. didn't alter the recipe too much. took tips from others...buttermilk, precook the bacon and saute'd the spinach and garlic instead of microwaving. Also, dashed a little salt on chicken breast before stuffing.so good. the in-laws were impressed. and the hubby as always loved it.

Terrific recipe. I used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and mostly shredded mozzarella along with a chopped up slice of pepperjack cheese. Would suggest salting and peppering the pounded out chicken breasts before stuffing and wrapping though. Otherwise, my husband and I loved this! Will be making it for my MIL when she comes to dinner in a few weeks.

Read over reviews and marinated in buttermilk for a couple of hours.  I also added sundried tomatoes. I think you could add any type of cheese mixture you wanted and it would turn out great.

I made this dish with fat-free sour cream and without the bacon.  To help retain moisture, i pan sauted the spinach, garlic and onion and poured the remaining olive oil and water from the pan on top of the breasts.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

My husband ate it, said it wasn't bad, however, it wasn't the greatest!  Something about chicken and bacon do not go.... The kids didn't even touch it once they saw spinache in there.  Not a meal I'd be making any time soon!

I followed this recipe exactly except I used regular jack cheese because my husband doesn't like spicy food.  I did add a couple shakes of Tabasco to the filling because I put Tabasco in everything. Anyway, it came out GREAT.  It even looked like the picture.  The other thing I did differently was to cover the baking dish with foil for the first 35 minutes because our oven tends to dry things out.   A few minutes uncovered under the broiler browned and crisped the bacon nicely and left the chicken still moist and delicious. Great recipe, Jersey Girl!

I used 1/s cup fresh cream (single) as I don’t like sour cream, frozen spinach but only 6 oz, ½ cup parmegian cheese and ½ cup crumbled feta cheese instead of pepperjack cheese, a bunch of mushrooms cut into small pieces and 4 slices of bacon instead of 8 and cooked it half way like some reviewers suggested. Served them with some oven baked potatoes and side salad ?  It was absolutely brilliant!! I will definitely use this recipe again!!!

Did not marinate...did partially cook the bacon, saute the chicken and garlic in some of the bacon drippings, added the cheeses to the spinach mixture.  It was excellent.

I followed advise of reviewer and marinated chicken, partially cooked bacon ahead, and used her filling/spice suggestion. And  it was fairly good, but not great.  I tasted the filling before baking and it was yummy. However,I think the cheese and sour cream melt out of the chicken during baking, leaving it a bit dry and plain. This is good, but not great recipe. Needs bit more tweaking.

I just got married and so this was the first dinner I actually made for my hubby. This was very tasty. I did add a few more spices to kick it up a notch but overall this was very good.

Yummy!! the filling was just delicious and the recipe was pretty easy to follow. the bacon, however, i could have done without. it was crispy on top from being broiled but the bottom was destined to be soggy. other than that, a delight!

This was great.  We had leftover spinach mix, so we served it on top of the chicken in addition to having it rolled in the chicken.

My version was actually not much like the original. I halved the sour cream, and used 3/4 c fresh grated mozzarella and 1/4 c feta. I also used frozen spinach, just thawed it in the microwave before adding it to the recipe. I omitted the bacon; I don't think it would have added much to the flavor, and we don't need the extra calories. There was some filling left over, and it made a great cracker dip for the next day!

OMG! This was incredible! I didn't marinate it or pound it. I cooked the spinach only 1 1/2 minute in the microwave so it still had some moisture that transfered to the chicken. I used feta cheese and added about 1 1/2 tbsp of chopped basil. It was unbelievably good! Next time I will try the pepperjack, I didn't have it at the time. A great basis recipe to go by!!

I loved this recipe as did my family. I just wasn't prepared for was the preparation. I haven't ever stuffed chicken breast before. It's not as easy as it sounds. With this particular recipe, which includes sour cream, the chicken and filling are all really messy. I couldn't tell whether it was going to hold together or if there was enough filling or what. I used a family pack of full size chicken breasts which I cut in half and pounded down. Needless to say they we not uniform in size at all. I doubled the recipe of filling because I had 4 huge breasts and it turned out I had a lot of filling left over. I actually cooked it with some bacon over the top in a baking dish and it turned out great. All in all it was a big hit. As they say “anything with bacon”!

Loved it!  Used microwave bacon instead of the uncooked kind! I cooked baby spinach with a small amount of garlic on the stove until the leaves were wilted.  Then added it to the the chicken with a small amount of swiss and ham (deli cut), rolled it and fastened it together with a couple of toothpicks each.  Baked for the 35 min and then put MICROWAVE already cooked bacon on it with another small amount of swiss on top and broiled it for about 5 minutes.  It turned out fantastic!

yum. I partially cooked the bacon, as I prefer mine a little crisper when baked. Set aside bacon, then wilt spinach in about 1 tsp of the bacon grease for more flavour and higher calorie boost. Also a couple of sundried tomatoes to filling can be nice if you use feta

I made this recipe extremely close to the original (didnt have pepperjack so used mozzarella and a little leftover feta I had on hand). Without any other changes this recipe was delicious. Now that I am reading some reviews with other versions and variations, I can't wait to try this recipe again with changes! This is a great base for a very versatile dish!

I ended up taking frozen chopped spinach and sauteeing it with butter and some garlic.  I then mixed it with monterey jack cheese and sour cream.  I also added seasoning to the chicken after they were rolled up. It cooked for 35 min with an extra 5 min of broiling, but in the future, I would probably reduce to 30 min so it doesn't dry out.  Great presentation, but I think the filling needs a bit more work, especially as written.

The filling tasted great! I ate the left over filling with crackers as a dip and it was wonderful. However, when I baked it it was too thin and ran out of the chicken, it wasn't creamy inside like I had hoped. Also, it took a long time to bake the chicken since it was so thick.  I made this again, using my favorite method of pounding the chicken and pan frying with cooking spray (super simple) then I just spooned the filling over and crumbled on the bacon. Awesome! It tasted great and it was really simple and fast!

This recipe was a winner in my family. I added 3 different cheeses and also marinaded the chicken in 1 cup of milk and 1 tbsp of vinegar and 1 tbsp of garlic powder. I used sundried tomato and herb feta cheese, monterey jalepeno cheese and medium cheddar cheese... It was awesome!

My hubby declared this chicken (along with pumpkin casserole)his favorite meal...restaurant or otherwise!  We have never been more impressed with a recipe!  These look gourmet and taste heavenly!  I did make a few changes: rubbed the outside of the chicken with salt and red pepper flakes, partially cooked and peppered the bacon, sauteed the spinach with salt and pepper and garlic instead of microwaving, and added feta to the spinach mixture.  The chicken was spicy and moist and not as messy as I thought.  THESE WERE WONDERFUL!!!

This recipe is great! I used smoked mozzarella slices instead of the pepper jack and also mixed some parmesan and garlic powder into the spinach/sour cream. I was afraid of the chicken being bland so I rubbed montreal chicken seasoning and seasoned salt into the outside before wrapping with the bacon. Make sure you broil it as the recipe states so the bacon will get crispy on top! Yum

I used cheddar instead of pepper jack and made sure to drain the spinach after microwaving it.  Delicious.  You can also reduce the fat in the dish by using low fat sour cream and leaving out the bacon (just secure the chicken with toothpicks).

this looked better then it tasted.  I stuffed mine with cream cheese, sour cream, and parmesean. (since thats what i had on hand) and broccoli instead of spinach.  the chicken was moist, but  bland (and i heavily seasoned it) Next time, i'll season the cheese mix and add some kind of sauce to go on top of it and minus the bacon.

I am giving this recipe only 4 stars becouse the garlic was very overpowering. We are huge garlic lovers but i would cut it back to 2 cloves. We also substituted the cheeses for a spicy cheddar.No need to precook the bacon. Also layed the bacon on top in a criss cross pattern insted of rolling it up. Great recipe and am looking forward to making it again this week.

This ended up taking longer to prepare than I thought it would. I sounded good and based on the reviews, I expected it to taste better than it did. I was disappointed. An alternative chicken and spinach recipe (also calls for cheese and bacon) is the Chicken Florentine Casserole, also posted on this site.

I wouldn't go as far as saying this was "terribly" dry.  It does need punching up, lacking needed juices.  Much potential here.

Try this!!!  It looks just like the picture and has a SHORT prep time with a beautiful, professional-looking presentation.  I will definitely be making this again and again.  I only had half of the spinach required, so  I added minced onion and roasted red peppers to make up for it.  I sauteed the spinach with the onions, garlic, & garlic...excellent plus it looked Christmas-y with the red and green.  I will try again with fresh mushrooms, shredded carrots, etc. I also added pepper and Lawry's seasoned salt before rolling the filling inside.

Very nice flavor.  I used smoke flavor bacon.  If you want the filling a little creamer I would use cream cheese in place of the pepper jack.
Had to finish at 500 degrees for about 15 mins to brown up the bacon.

This was very tasty but my filling was very runny.  Next time I will squeeze the water out of the spinach before adding the other ingredients.

It's definately different than the same old chicken.  I used thawed frozen spinach, I like the color and flavor better than fresh.  Sauted spinach with a little butter and the garlic first.  I also added garlic salt and fresh ground pepper to the chicken before adding the spinach mixture.  Next time I will marinate the chicken for awhile, it was somewhat bland.  Will make again with a few alterations.

This came out really well. I let the chicken sit in milk and vinegar like someone suggested(thanks) and it made the chicken moist, I also marinated the chicken with some chili powder and garlic because I like my food very spicy.  It got GREAT reviews even from people who dont really like spinach!

I made this for dinner last night.  Did as previously recommende and sauteed the spinanch in butter and garlic.  Seasoned to taste and then put in a bowl and mixed in the sour cream and pepperjack cheese.  I also microwaved my turkey bacon ahead of time and added it after the initial 35 cook time.  My husband gave me a 10 for presentation and another 10 once he tasted it.  This dish looks really nice but is so easy to make.  Thanks for sharing!!!  I loved it.

My husband thanked me! Not only was it easy and inexpensive to make, it tasted wonderful. The only thing that could have been better was that it could have used a little less spinach and a little more cheese.

This was really good - but doesn't need to be as complicated as the recipe makes it.  Brown the bacon in a skillet a little first, wilt the spinach in the bacon grease & mix in the sour cream and cheese.  Just top the unpounded chicken pieces with the spinach mixture and lay the bacon on top.  Would be excellent with sliced mushrooms too!

This recipe was awsome. I made it a little differant. I sauted two cloves of garlic with the spinich in a little oil and butter. I used roasted garlic mozzarella and asiago shredded cheese. I would have used pepperjack cheese, but I didn't want to have the spice. I also seasoned the chicken breast with some salt and cracked pepper before I rolled them with the mixture. It really turned out very good and tasty. I will definatly be making it again soon.

I did not like this recipe at all. Served it last night for company and no one seemed crazy about it. It may have been better if I sauted the spinach in butter instead of wilting in the microwave.

Delicious!!! So glad I tried this....hubby loved it. Used cheddar cheese instead of pepperjack. Might add some sauteed mushrooms to the stuffing next time. Made four big stuffed chicken breasts...even tasted great re-heated the next night. The bacon really was so tasty...did crank up the broiler until crispy. Ohh..I did use a bag of fresh baby spinach and I sauteed that with the garlic in a little of olive oil first. Will make again!! Thanks for sharing.

My husband and I didn't really care for this recipe. We may have liked it more if perhaps we had seasoned and breaded the chicken. It just tasted a little bland to us. However, others really seem to like it, so it wouldn't hurt to try it. Overall, not bad, but not our favorite. Thanks for the recipe, anyway. :)

I really like this recipe. It looks and tastes great. It really impresses people, and is now one of my husbands favorite. I've made it a few times, and I like it better when I use sharp chedder cheese.

FABULOUS!  I made this for my mother's birthday dinner this weekend it my whole family gave it rave reviews and all 6 of us gave it FIVE STARS!  I scaled the recipe to serve 8, and it called for 8 cloves of garlic - I only used about 4 and it was just enough.  I also used a mexican blend of cheese since I don't have a cheese grater and it will still delicious!  I will be making this again and I do want to try it with the pepperjack cheese!  Thanks for the WONDERFUL recipe JerseyGirl!!

This recipe was very easy to do and had a wonderful presentation.  For some reason, though, it was a little on the bland side.  The consensus with my husband and guest was to maybe marinate the chicken breasts before hand and to add more of the pepperjack cheese. Will definitely try again and let ya'll know.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is probably the best chicken breast I have ever had. I added more cheese and more sour cream and a couple extra slices of bacon around each breast. Also instead of pounding out the chicken I cut slits in the sides and opened them up to stuff them. I made six breasts and the only thing I could say didn't work the way I wanted was the amount of juices that were released into the baking dish. Next time I will either make the smaller serving, or put them in a larger dish and not use the extra bacon(it turned out a little salty). This was great the next day, I put a single breast on a cookie sheet and put the oven on 500. It made the bacon crisp up even more. Also I would suggest that to be served these need to be sliced up into medalions the large breast were just too much to eat for my guests they each probably could have had half a breast and been satisfied.

This meal turned out looking beautiful, but the taste was quite bland.  I love the spicy taste of pepperjack cheese but with so much spinach, I couldn't even taste the cheese and I doubled the amount of cheese the recipe called for having read the previous reviews.  If making again, I would use half the amount of spinach and probably 3 times the cheese.  It's a very attractive entree but there was very little flavor.

This  was very good. I did change it a tad. I cooked the garlic  and spinach together in a pan and added mushrooms.  I added Parmesan cheese with the mixture. For more flavor, I added basil and chopped onion. On top of the chicken  added some Parmesan bread crumbs. I did try it with ham, and that was so good.

This was great. Only substitutions were frozen spinach (thawed with water squeezed out) and plain yogurt for sour cream. Definitely needed the broiler to fully cook the bacon.

We loved it, even our picky 2 year old cleaned her plate! We used colby jack instead of the pepper jack for little tastebuds, of course, but I can't wait to try it with the pepper jack when she stays the night with Grandma!

I made this dish tonight for my family and they loved it! The only thing I chanfed was I used plain Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream.  It turned out great! I will make this for family and friends!

I stuck very close to the recipe.  I fried 2 pieces of bacon to a crisp, sauteed onions and warmed up the stuffing in that, broke up the bacon and added it in, I followed the cooking instructions, well done... bacon on the outside was crispy.
I'm gonna make it often. 
Thank you.

My family loved this dish! I used feta cheese and sour cream. It added more taste. plus I made garlic mashed potatoes as a side. Pretty easy to make and its super filling.

It was really good the way it was written.  Yum!  The pepper jack cheese makes it.....don't change it for something bland.  Lots of garlic too!!!  So good!  Would have liked crunchier bacon, but next time I will cook it first a little bit.

These were delicious!  I did have to pound these breasts FLAT.  Instead of putting the bacon on the outside, I cooked the bacon and crumbled it into the mixture for the center.   I tried cooking them both ways - in the oven and in the skillet.  The skillet breasts, cooked in butter, came out much more flavorful.  I would make this one again and again!

Delish!  I used prosciutto ham instead of bacon.  And I made a sherry wine reduction sauce which I basted the rolls with before returning to the 500 degree oven.  I also substitutes feta for the pepper jack and a bit of Romano as well.  I garnished each rill with Romano and spooned the sherry reduction over each just before serving.  It rocked!!!

This was a delicious meal that was requested to be put into the 'rotation' of favorites.  I followed other reviewers advice and sautéed my spinach in the bacon grease with some garlic after a quick half cook of the bacon.  I substituted the sour cream with tofutti and the cheese for feta (cow milk allergies) and sprinkled the pounded chicken breasts with some onion powder,  garlic powder,  paprika and fresh ground pepper and salt before stuffing.  Chicken was moist and amazingly delicious!

I made this dish tonight for my family I used fresh spinach I seasoned it well and precooked it I used minced garlic Adobe seaoning ,black pepper , and instead of sour cream I used cream cheese as well as Parmesan and cheddar cheese, with my chicken I season it with almost the same thing I just used saszone and I marinated it for an hour in Italian dressing. I also didn't use beef or pork bacon I used turkey bacon and when it came out it was soooooo good I was asked to make it for others and they even offered to pay me. I love this recipe and I will definitely use it again really soon!!! Thanks ??

Some of the less-positive reviews noted that the meal lacked flavor; I found it depended on the bite.  If you had a bite with bacon, it tasted great and the different textures worked well.  But if you had a bite without bacon, and just the chicken/cheese/spinach mixture, it was definitely bland.  I subbed sour cream for cream cheese in hopes it would hold up better during cooking and it did, but otherwise the dish was hit and miss depending on your bite.

Made this for guests, no leftovers. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed. I used turkey bacon instead of real and it worked very nicely. Next time I make it I will probably cut down on the amount of garlic, the flavor was a bit too prominent for me.

This recipe is good and has a lot of potential. Next time I will just make sure to season the chicken and the filling. Also maybe the bacon should be partially cooked before wrapping so it does not get soggy or does not remain uncooked.

Was great.  Filling was fantastic on its on for chips and dip.    Seemed to die down in flavour when it was cooked, don't get me wrong it was great. But a little more garlic or basil might take it over the top

Great recipe!  I tried half cooking half of the bacon and use raw for the other to see if it made a difference...it didn't.  Great filling I made as  directed but also tried with feta...delish! thanks

I didn't have pepper jack so I used baby brick and added about two tablespoons of chopped jalapeno peppers which was just the right bang. Also, On the lenghwise I halved my three chicken brests to make six thin and so easy to pound down a little more.  My husband would call this "fancy food" and usually hates it, but this he loved.

I changed it ever so slightly.  I doubled the filling (but used 16 ounces of frozen spinach).  To save some fat, I did use plain yogurt.  The leftover filling, I placed in a casserole dish added the rest of the bacon from the package and baked it along with the chicken, and added about 1/2 cup cheese.  The kids loved the filling even more than chicken dish itself.

I left out the cheese but added some crushed garlic.  I didn't want the heaviness of the cheese. I wrapped the chicken with two strips of bacon, one wrapped one way over and the other the other way over so they crossed in the middle

love it.  kids will even eat it!  i like to crisp up the bacon and dice it and mix it in with the spinach cheese mixture instead of wrapping the chicken breasts with it - seems to turn out gummy that way for me.  thanks!

This is the second time I have made this recipe, requested by my husband. He tends to be a cheese fanatic. I did make several changes though, based on time, ingredients, etc. As another reviewer did, I pounded them flat, probably less than 1/2 inch, and placed them in the baking dish that way. I then spooned the spinach/cheese mixture on top of 4 breast halves. I sprinkled the tops with grated parmesan cheese. I used chopped garlic in a jar, and added grated cheddar or mozzerella, whatever I had. (no papperjack) I also used frozen chopped spinach which I added to the onions and garlic once sauteed.  I added garlic powder, black pepper and parsley to the mix. The idea of the bacon grease really didn't appeal to me, so I think I'll try topping with real bacon bits next time!

My little booger bear won't eat this delicious dish but my husband and I love it. I grow spinach for it by it's self and also for this dish. It is definately one of my favorite ways to cook chicken. I always add more cheese though because I am a cheese addict. Thank you for a great recipe.

I made this exactly as it says and it is fantastic.  My husband asks for it a lot!  I think next time, I'm going to add a few seasonings like crushed red pepper to the spinach just cause we like things a little hotter!  Thank you for a great recipe!  It has become a staple in our house!

Really like this dish although it was a little bland for my taste.  Next time I'm going to try adding a more spicy kick to the chicken.  Absolutely love the spinach mixture!  Great dip with bagel chips.

I did as others and marinated the chicken breast in buttermilk first. The changes I made were as follows: I used cream cheese instead of sour cream and added sauteed mushrooms, onions, spinach, red pepper flakes and fresh garlic. I mixed in parmesian and asiago cheese. I fried the bacon and added half a strip in the middle with the cheese mixture. I topped this with a spoon full of crumbled blue cheese before folding over the chicken breast. I topped with gouda cheese in the final baking step. It was soooo good. I will definately make again. The only sad part is that there were NO leftovers. Yummy recipe.

Great receipe! Used fresh spinach, montery jack cheese and a few pinches of salt. I soaked the chicken in buttermilk for a few hours then seasonsed as I would any chicken. I also followed the advice of other reviewers and par-cooked the bacon. Came out very tender but I did not completely strain the juice off the spinach so it was a little watery. Can't wait to make again.

Wonderful! I did leave the bacon out (diet restrictions :( ) Like others I seasoned the spinach mixture and breasts prior to rolling. I used the leftover spinach mixture to cover the top of each breast and they remained nice and tender.

I love the idea of stuffed chicken breast.  I love to see and taste what's inside.  I prepared this recipe for a friend who can not have vegtables in the night shade family.  So, I made a couple changes.  In place of Pepper Jack cheese I substituted a half cup of mozerella and a half cup of romano.  I substituted the sour cream with 8 oz. of ricotta.  Also, I added one more step.  After flatteniing the chicken breast to the desired thickness I marinaded the chicken in buttermilk mixed with 3/4tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper for about 2 hours.  The end result was fantastic.  Also, I made two cups of white sauce to pour over the chicken after it was baked and cut into slices.  The white sauce contained one cup of Monteray Jack cheese melted in.  Thanks so much for the recipe; it tasted great.

This came out very good.  I adjusted some things, like I cooked it at 350 bc I had a rice casserole cooking at the same time, and I used different cheeses because that is what I had available.  I used mozzarella, parmesan, sour cream, garlic, sliced mushrooms, and a pinch of pepper in the filling.  The chicken I s/p on the outside and only used salt on the inside where the filling would be.  The bacon I slightly cooked in the microwave and laid it on top.  The fat from the bacon kept the chicken moist and everything tasted fantastic!

Both my kids loved it.  I substituted turkey bacon for the regular bacon.  I also added chopped mushrooms & onions (which I wilted with the spinach, then drained the liquid) into the spinach mixture.

I really liked the spinach mixture in this recipe, however, I feel that the whole dish lacked some flavor. I added a bit of lemon juice & some thyme, but I think next time, I'll use more spices.

I would also suggest using the type of chicken breasts that are already thin. It saves a lot of time and work!

I listened to a lot of the other commenters advice (mayo soaked chicken came out so soft!) and between that and turning the leftover spinach filling into an awesome dip, this recipe was promising! I loved it and so did my family. :)

Made these last night and couldn't believe how good they were! I did tweak the recipe a bit: For the filling, I used frozen chopped spinach which I defrosted in the microwave, then used a clean kitchen towel to squeeze all the liquid out. I used extra garlic and also added some chopped cilantro just because I was craving it. It really gave the stuffing a wonderful flavor. I seasoned the chicken with salt and seasoned pepper, and I also used packaged precooked bacon and it came out perfectly crisp, with less grease than raw bacon. Thanks for this great recipe!

The dish was ok. I made it according to the receipe but after reading some reviews added some seasoning salt, cayenne pepper and onion powder on top while it was still baking. I cant imagine how bland it wouldve been without it. Next time I'll pass on the bacon and think that soaking the chicken in broth will be good idea. Less spinach and sour creambecause it was very messy. BUT I think with a little tweeking it will come out better next time!

this recipe was great. it was fun to make, looked delicious, and tasted AMAZING.:) I marinated the chicken in buttermilk for a few hours, and i cooked the bacon slightly then sautéed the spinach and garlic in the grease instead of putting it the microwave as the recipe told to do.(As other reviewers suggested-thanks!) Since i slightly cooked the bacon, i did not need to do the part about turning the oven to 500 for the last 5-10 mins- the bacon was already nice and brown. It was kind of messy to fill because the filling kept trying to come out, but that just made even more fun to make. I made veggies on the side but they were not necessary- one of these was filling enough for a whole dinner. These were delicious, I will definitely make them again! :)

This recipe was AWESOME!  I absolutely loved it.  The only thing I did was add salt and pepper to the filling and I used mixed mexican cheeses.  I also seasoned the chicken breast with garlic salt and pepper before flattening it. So easy!  So tasty!

I followed the recipe exactly...except I used turkey bacon. It was delicious and definately deserves 5 stars for taste. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because the way mine looked. I had the spinach filling squirting out of the sides. I will definately make this again, but next time, I will use less spinach & less sour cream.
The left overs tasted even better the next day!

I made this last night for my mom's birthday. I seasoned the chicken before adding the filling & I added sauteed mushrooms to the stuffing. My family loved it, and I would cook it again, but it was more time consuming than I'm used to, and I'd definitely season the chicken more. Also, my chicken was not as juicy as I'd have liked it to be, but overall, it was a delicious meal. Thanks for posting the recipe!

I think this was great and flavorful and easy! I think it is very important to use the PepperJack cheese. It adds all the flavor and kick that it needs. But as a girl from Wisconsin, I added about 1.5 cups pepperjack cheese and extra fat free sour cream. This was plenty for the 6 chicken breasts that I cooked and I just plopped the rest of the filling right on top while it was cooking.

Took the advice of other reviewers. Cooked the bacon a bit on the stove top and then wilted the spinach and roasted the garlic in the same pan after the bacon was done cooking. Did not soak my chicken in buttermilk but it still came out nice and juicy.

The one thing that I would do different from what I did is that I would cook the chicken on a rack on a roasting pan. The chicken and filling let out a bit of juice and the bacon that was touching the pan soaked up this liquid and did not crisp at all! That is the only thing! Both my fiance and myself loved it!

This was very good but a little too cheesy for my taste.  Next time I will experiment with reducing the amount of cheese in the filling.  Good idea to marinate the chicken before making these!

this was good. i switched out the spinach & shredded pepperjack cheese for chopped broccoli & shredded cheddar & monterey jack cheese (my fiance HATES spinach) & sprinkled a lil basil on top of the chicken before it went into the oven. being an extreme garlic lover i found the garlic in this recipe too overpowering... so next time i would use 2 cloves of garlic instead of 4. besides that it came out quite yummy. thanks for sharing.

delicious with suggested changes.  Would not be as good without.  I put the extra filling around the roll ups while baking.  Served with sauteed mushrooms, green beans and noodles.

5 stars because my husband LOVED them, and they looked really good on the plate. I personally would say 4 stars. I followed the recipe exactly, but used specialty spicy cheese in the same amount. What I will change next time: reduce amount of sour cream just a touch, and add more spinach and cheese.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly because I didn't have all it on hand. I substitute cream cheese for sour cream and mozzarella & parmesan for pepperjack. It was delicious. I made is with Oven Fresh Seasoned Potato Wedges (another allrecipe recipe.

AMAZING! My husband and I absolutely loved this dish! I substituted a few things like: Fat Free sour cream, chopped frozen spinach, feta cheese, and turkey bacon instead. We had garlic mashed potatoes as a side dish...best meal we've had in a while. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was GREAT!  My girlfriend LOVED it, she was eating and talking then all of a sudden she said " this is good!".  I definitely seasoned the chickn breast with lawrys season salt and onion powder.  I also put the spinach (canned, drained) in the bacon grease and let it boil so that the liquid would evaporate, then added seasonings.  I too had a lot of spinach mixture left and I'll just use that on a day I feel like having some spinach dip (now I know how to make spinach dip!!).  I can't remember what cheese I used but it definitely wasn't pepperjack, i think it was three cheese italian or something.  I sprinkled pepper on top before I put it in the oven Will definitely make again!!! seasoning is key!

Made for husband who is bored with chicken. He gave it 4 stars, but he loved crushed red pepper I put in the mix. I baked it on a rack still had a problem with bacon not being done enough on the underside, so next time and I will make again, I will turn it half way thru broiling time. All in all he thought it was GREAT! Also used fat free sour cream from target's brand Market Pantry, which is the best fat free sour cream I've come across.

Loved it, used feta because thats what I had and partially cooked the bacon.  Had a jar of sun dried tomatoe alfredo sauce and added a heaping tablespoon on top of each breast.  It was juicy and very flavorful.  Thanks for a great recipe everyone raved.

This recipe came out very good.  I did not have fresh spinach so I used a bag of frozen.  I partially cooked the spinach and then followed the recipe.  I did season the chicken breast with salt and pepper before I filled them.  There was way too much filling so next time I will half that recipe.  I also thought the garlic taste was pretty strong but since we like garlic it was okay.  My husband loved this recipe and said it was a keeper.  I will be making this dish again.

Amazing!!! The only change I made was to add two more strips of bacon to each chicken wrap -- I put two strips of bacon one way and two the other direction, completely encasing the chicken wrap, and criss-crossed them for better hold and more aesthetic appeal. That way, none of the filling fell out.

This was awsome. Made the stuffing added some parm to it. Instead of stuffing into chicken breasts I layered it over what I left from a beer can chicken and put on the grill for about 10 min.

I cooked my bacon before hand in the microwave, not all the way cooked.  I would suggest a putting your chicken on a cooking rack inside a baking dish or removing excess fluid occasionally.  This will be a new family fav!

First thing, I love chicken stuffed with spinach and I love pepper jack cheese.  This is the best combination and very easy to put together.  Make sure that the chicken breasts are pounded thin enough.  Thanks for posting this.

As per previous reviews, I cut down the amount of spinach to 6oz. This made the sour cream way to overpowering. I think if I did it again, I'd cut that down by half. Not too impressed.

WOW!  This was so delicious.  I used a little less sour cream (about 1/4 cup) because my husband doesn't like it and I didn't want him to pick up on the fact that it was in there.  He never had a clue and we both enjoyed it throughly.  We can't wait to make it again.  Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe! Mi Novia loved it and she doesnt even like spinach! I did something differently though. I seasoned my meat (or else it would have been bland) but for the spinach mix I used tomato and basil crumpled feta cheese, which really gave it that extra kick. LOVED the recipe though!

Absolutely delicious; my 4 grandkids(ages 6 - 10) thought it was super!  I didn't change a thing and the pepperjack gave it a real nice kick but not too hot.  Kids are already asking for it again and I just made it 4 nights ago.

Thank you JerseyGirl. This recipe was amazingand easy. The first time I made it because I had all the ingredients and it seemed easy. Now I love to make it for company! It's delicious and has a beautiful presentation. I make an "X" with my bacon and tuck it under the chicken. It's really pretty. I don't change the recipe at all!

This one really didn't turn out good for me.  I probably didn't make it right.  There was too much liquid, I should have strained the spinach and the bacon wasn't fully cooked underneath.  I guess you can't win them all.

I was really excited to try this recipe after reading all the great reviews.   Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  The spinach stuffing was runny and so so.  The chicken breasts were dry even after marinating them in buttermilk.  I would not try this recipe again.

Came out wonderful!  Next time I will add more pepper jack cheese and maybe some tomatoes.  This is a very easy and simple dish.

This tasted great, but I couldn't get it to roll well. If I do it again, I'll use the review advice to wilt spinach in bacon grease (as I did this time) but I'd layer it with half-cooked brown rice on the bottom, then chicken, then spinach mixture, and bacon on top as more of a casserole.

Amazing chicken dish.  I left off the bacon and used light sour cream and it was still awesome.  Even my picky husband liked it.

I have to say.. This has become my signature dish thanks to this wonderful cook who suggested it!  Of course you just make a few changes to adjust your own tastes etc.. It can be messy. You just have to beware of how much stuffing you put in. And place definitely place about 2 toothpicks in each breast.  I have also tried it in a few different ways:  1. with Dijon mustard instead of sour cream  2. with lots of shredded Cheddar or Emmental on top  3. and lastly I became adventurous and stuffed it with pre-cooked minced meat and garlic. Seasoned a few with red pesto and capers and the others with black olive tapanade and olive bits.  It's a very versatile recipe. And once again.. BRAVO chef for the suggestion! :D

I'm not a great cook, but I followed this recipe step by step and it came out GREAT!  When my husband came home he wanted to know where I ordered it from....LOL!  I told him I made it.  He really enjoyed it.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this for Christmas Dinner tonight and the family loved it.  I made a few changes as others had suggested; sauteed the spinach with the garlic in the bacon grease,  added onion powder, garlic powder, and garlic salt to the mix, and seasoned the chicken with seasoning salt.  I will definitely make it again.

Great! I sauteed mushrooms with butter, diced tomatoes, garlic, salt and pepper, drained a bit then added the spinach and sour cream mixture. I was short on time so I cooked the chicken breast on the stovetop until almost done then I just spread the spinach mixture on top of the breasts instead of rolling them up and it cooked quicker and the flavor was great! I didnt use and bacon. Will diffinately made again!

This was absolutely delicious.  I did follow the suggestions of other users and prepared this dish as follows:  soaked the chicken in milk and lemon juice (in lieu of buttermilk since I didn't have any), fried the bacon halfway through, took it out the skillet, and sauteed the fresh spinach leaves with fresh garlic and added seasoning salt and other spices.  I mixed the spinach mixture with the shredded pepper jack cheese and sourcream and seasoned that just a little.  I also added a little seasoning to the chicken breasts.  I spooned the filling into each breast, wrapped them with two slices of bacon each, and secured everything with a toothpick.  I had a little spinach mixture leftover so I put that on the sides of each piece of chicken in the pan and it cooked down nicely.  As this recipe is written, it seems it would be a little on the bland side as it doesn't call for any salt or seasonings (other than black pepper).  These chicken breasts were very moist and tender.  I will definitely be adding this to my recipe book.

no matter what other reveiwers may say you have to try this recipe. it is really good. i followed the ingredients to the t. the only change to preparing the recipe is i sauteed the spinach in a little butter wih the garlic until it wilted. i think a key to this dish for flavor is make sure you use a good quality bacon. my personal favorite is wright brand applewood smoked. it is thick and full of flavor and meat. not all fat. i cooked it down just until some of the fat started melting away and edges started turning before wrapping the chicken. besides that, stuck it in the oven and cooked for directed amount of time. no dry chicken here.

Very good recipe.  Just a tad bit dry on the chicken breast.  But taste was excellent.  I used the leftover spinach mixture as a cracker dip and it's yummy also.

I have made this several times because my husband likes it, however, I only had reduced fat sour cream which takes away from the flavor.  So this time I substituted a 1/2 cup chuncky blue cheese dressing.  This definately made it a 5 star recipe!!!

Delicious!! I marinated it in milk and lemon juice (didn't have any buttermilk) like someone else suggested, and used cheddar cheese. My husband isn't a huge fan of spinach but he loves this! I'm making it again tonight :)

I love spinach so this recipe was great! We loved it and it was easy to make. I am always looking for new recipes with spinach. We will make this again, it was different. I get tired of making the same kinds of chicken recipes. It was nice to have something that tastes different.

Very good and easy to make.  I didn't use any mushrooms or bacon but kept everything else the same.  Very tasty and I will make again!

Added mushrooms, left out the sour cream, and used mozzarella instead.  Turned out great! I made the mistake of not using a rack in the oven and baking it in a dish so the chicken sat in grease/liquids.  I would recommend NOT cooking the bacon ahead of time as others have suggested. Let the bacon do it's job and it will be flavorful and moist!

I used prosciutto in place of the bacon and it turned out GREAT! Loved it so much that I passed the recipe on to my mom, who loved it as well.

This was a GREAT recipe. I did a few things different though.  First I seasoned the chix with poultry seas, garlic salt, pepper, and seasoning salt. then i marinated it with 1 cup of milk, 1 TBLS of lemon and vineger.  Then i cooked the spinish and added sundried tom.  i made the stuffing the same way but added mont/jack cheese.  I didn't use the bacon, and it came out perfect.  Great Recipe it's one of the family favorites now :)

My husband used this recipe from one of the all recipe cookbooks. I love spinach dips and though this would give a similar taste. It was really delicious. My husband didn't alter the recipe and the taste of the filling was great as is. The pepperjack cheese gave the filling a nice kick while the sourcream made it tangy. I told him that this is one recipe that we could use for entertaining in the future. I'm sure any guest would be impressed. If I remember correctly, I think the outside part of the chicken got a little crispy, may try marinading it in the buttermilk or broth before cooking. You should give this a try, it will be worth it.

This recipe quickly made it into our rotation after the first time!  I normally just cris-cross the bacon on top of it, though b/c it never gets crispy on the bottom.  Also, I have had to make it without the sour cream sometimes, and it is still excellent.  I always use more feta cheese (really, as much as I can get my hands on).  WONDERFUL RECIPE!

This was pretty good, but I added some mozerella cheese to make it really full inside.I also seared the chicken in hot olive oil to brown before cooking in oven.

I love this website.  Every recipe we try is great!  I add what I like and take out seasons I don't to any recipe.  For this one I put an orange pepper, cilantro,onion  and the garlic then browned them in a lil' butter added to the steamed baby spinach-cheese mixture.  I had to cook them for 40 minutes since the chicken pieces seemed large.  It was yummy!  I go to this site for recipes for ideas mainly.  I pick 4 1/2 star recipes and up about twice a week have not been disappointed yet...and I am feeding 3 kids under the age of 7 and they eat it all up almost every time!

I personally thought this was delicious, but my husband did not enjoy it. I think that's because he's not a big fan of spinach though :P I will definitely make this again, but will try to use a different stuffing that my husband will like.

I didnt have any of the Jack Cheese on hand, so I tried Marbled Cheddar instead, this worked well.  I also omitted the bacon and used a premixed powdered Carbonerra sauce with the sour cream and cheese.

Like some other reviewers, i found this recipe to be a very nice presentation but a little bland initially. but interestingly, the leftovers were much better...no doubt due to the flavors having a chance to mingle. i really liked this recipe overall and want to experiment with it with some additional seasoning or perhaps a sauce that will compliment it over a bed of rice.

I really like this. I half way cooked the bacon like others suggested and it tunred out great. The only thing I might do differently is add a little more flavor to the filling.

OMG!!! My hubby and I thought this dish was outstanding.  I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of sprinkling seasoning salt, garlic powder and pepper over the top of the chicken prior to adding the bacon.  The bacon cooked perfectly.  I used thin sliced bacon so I think that helped in it making sure it was crispy.  I will definitely make this again.

Looked great but tasted very bland. I substituted 1/2 cup sharp cheddar and a finely chopped jalapeno pepper for the pepperjack, because I can't get pepperjack, but other than that I followed the recipe.

A delicious gourmet entree! Easy to assemble, but does take some time. I made mine up and refrigerated for 24 hours. I used cheddar cheese instead of pepperjack and plain yogurt instead of sour cream because that is what I had on hand and still really good. The chicken was quite juicy and I did not have to marinate in buttermilk like other reviewers have mentioned.

This was great.  I added a little cheddar cheese to the mix as well. Even my 5 year old who doesn't eat vegetables ate.  We will be making this again.

My husband, who is extremely picky, enjoyed this recipe. After reading reviews, I half-cooked the bacon beforehand, sauteed the spinach and garlic in the grease as well. Added spices recommended from other viewers, but still would have like a little more flavor/kick. I recommend when rolling the chicken, to fold in the sides as well to keep the mixture in the chicken instead of spreading out all over your pan. Good recipe. Not too terribly labor intensive. I paired with garlic mashed potatoes, and a vegetable medley of squash, yel/red/gre bell peppers, and zuchini.

This recipe is "OMG" the best!  I have tried other recipes on this site and they have turned out okay, but this one has been the best by far.  I did change one little thing though, I used collard greens instead of spinach.  My whole family loved it, from my husband to my 13mo. old son.  I wouldn't change anything about this recipe.  I only changed the spinach because my family perfers collard greens over spinach.

Finally tried this recipe after saving it for a long time. I have read a lot of the reviews and will add my two cents worth.  I thought it was good not great but will try it again and after pounding out the chicken i will season it.  then i will try to use less liquid in the spinach mix (like less sour cream or perhaps use cream cheese)  I will also experiment with the cheese perhaps using a slice of some type on the bottom of the spinach mixture and also on the top.  great concept and great presentation.

Needed extra flavor- it was bland as is.  Omitted the bacon.  Next time I would add another ingredient to zip it up.  Probably not worth the work.

Didn't care for this at all, either did my family. I prefer fresh spinach over frozen. Frozen tastes like seaweed to me!

Very good, but I did change the recipe a little wanted to work with what I had in the house without making a store run. So I used cream cheese instead of the sour cream and shredded white cheddar instead of the pepperjack. It turned out really good and was a big hit.

This was an awesome recipe.  My family loved it and it became my 7 year olds favorite dish.  The only problem I had was getting the stuffing to stay in the chicken.  Otherwise, it was fantastic!

Very, VERY good!  I did not have any spinach at home, so I used chopped brocoli instead.  I also wrapped one strip of bacon around the chicken in one direction and another around the long way.  This held it together without the need for toothpicks and looked beautiful!  Great meal for company!

These are GREAT! Everyone told me not to ever lose this recipe.  I did use one of the other reviewers advice and precooked the bacon.  I also added an extra two cloves of garlic and a little extra pepperjack cheese, and sprinkled the chicken with garlic powder and pepper on both sides, we really like garlic :) Not only did they taste good, but they came out beautiful Thanks for the recipe.

This was terrific.  I served it on a bed of brown rice boiled in vegetable broth, and used turkey bacon as pork is off my personal menu.

Fantastic Recipe. Everyone in the family loved it. My hubby actually finished everything on his plate. 
I marinated the chicken in buttermilk like suggested and wow very moist. After reading some of the reviews I did use some seasoning for the chicken. I sprinkled it with montrel chicken spice and some salt and pepper. After pressing them I put in one slice of swiss cheese I added the pepper jack cheese with the spinich which I cooked on the stove. I used turkey bacon instead of pork as I am allergic to pork. After wrapping it all up and placing in the pan I sprinkled some fresh parmesam cheese on top.

A must do again recipe I can't wait to have company over to do it again.
Thanks for the recipe.

I tried this recipe a year ago when I looked for a simple spinach and cheese stuffed chicken breast.. I made it many times since because I simply loved it.. my only changes are I use sharp white cheddar cheese instead.. I personally think the taste is better, cheesier.. and my husband says they no longer smell like feet.. lol thats the drawback of using montery jack!!!

This was tasty, I cut the recipe in half and used Turkey bacon to cut down in the fat. I just realized I don't like cooked spinach though...The sauce, with the pepperjack, garlic and sourcream was very tasty and flavorful. And it looked lovely!

I did not care for this recipe. It was VERY bland and I even added extra spices to it!  The chicken had no flavor, all you could taste was the spinach!  DO NOT RECOMEND FOR ANYONE TO TRY THIS RECIPE!  will not make again!

Awesome chicken.  Easy to make and uses ingredients I usually have on hand.  I love bacon but didn't have any so I used black forest ham on the inside instead.  EASY AND DELICIOUS.

Very good recipe with some tweaks. I used light sour cream and turkey bacon to lighten the recipe. I also used mexican style cheese because that is what I had on hand. I took the advice of other reviewers and seasoned both the spinach stuffing and chicken breast with salt and pepper. I prepared everthing the night before up to rolling up the chicken. I popped the chicken out of the fridge and right into the oven the next day. Served with seasoned potatoes and corn.

I love this recipe- I used fat free creme cheese, added garlic, chives, and onion to it... mixed it along with the spinach. :) I also used turkey bacon, basting with a litle fat free creme cheese mid way through baking.

Very tasty.  I added some paprika, cayenne pepper, salt and cumin to the spinach mix as well as fat free sour cream and low fat mexican cheese (that's all I had).  I also sprinkled the top of the chicken with salt and pepper.  Yum. Yum.  Will make again.

This was very good. I did take the advice of one reviewer and soaked the chicken in buttermilk for a couple hours before cooking; this made it very moist. Next time I will add some crushed red peppers and diced onion to the stuffing for an extra kick.

We thought this was great!  I added a little pepper sauce to make the spinach mix a little spicier.  It ended up super-tasty and there were no leftovers.  Thanks!

Delicious!  I marinated the chicken in buttermilk after flattening them out.  I used a lot of the suggestions of others (partially cooking the bacon, added onion to the spinach mixture as well as a little chive 'n onion cream cheese).  Very moist and used a little salt in the marinade or chicken would have been very bland.

This was wonderful! I follwed the advice of others and partially cooked the bacon first and sprinkled the chicken with paprika. I wanted to use up some plain yoghurt so substituted that in for sour cream and it was still delicious.
I didn't bother with marinating and the chicken still came out nice and tender.
Like others have said, I had a little extra of the spinach stuffing left over. I fried up an onion and a couple of cloves of garlic and threw the extra filling in the pan with those and a can of sliced mushrooms and a touch of sour cream. I used this as a sauce for pasta to eat along side the chicken and steamed some asparagus....DEEEEEEELISH!

This recipe is not only quite tasty but VERY easy to make as well.  I did have a few variations.  First, I added a little cheddar and spiced up the spinach stuffing by adding garlic salt and a dash of cayenne pepper.  I also used extra thick pepper crusted bacon which I cooked for 3 min in the microwave before wrapping the chicken.  Finally, I sprinkled some paprika over the chicked right before placing in the oven.  The chicken turned out so good I ate 2 pieces!

We chose to grill this, which gave it wonderful taste.  I think it would have been better if the bacon was cooked first, then cut up and added to the stuffing. The bacon on the outside was a little overwhelming-very rich.

Since I'm dieting I substituted:
1 pack of chopped frozen spinach
less than a hand full low fat shredded pepperjack cheese 
Minced garlic 
2 skinless, boneless chicken thighs 
4 slices turkey bacon 
Island Mango Marinade 

The taste of the dish is phenomenal. Add a size of corn and eat up. After eating you will not feel heavy or stuck. I highly recommend this dish to everyone!!!

Tender, juicy chicken, but pretty bland and tasteless as written.  I read reviews and jazzed it up a little before baking but it was still not what I was hoping for.  The spinach filling tasted better before baking - after baking, I could only taste spinach.  I would try it again but with a lot of modifications.  Good entree for those of us who do low-carb, so I'll experiment with it.

This is REALLY good and simple to make.   I use a little less sour cream and add a little cream cheese to the mix.   I use whatever cheese I have on hand - pepperjack, feta, or cheddar - and they are all good.

Delicous! I seasoned my chicken breast with a little Good Seasonings Italian Dressing (dry packet)and I used low fat sour cream and turkey bacon and cheddar cheese instead of the jack. I also added some green onions and a chopped roma tomato to the spinach mixture. I had a lot of spinach mixture left over so I cooked Trader Joe's brown rice (3 min in the microwave) and added the left over spinach mixture to the rice. I broiled it in the oven for 5 minutes and I had an instant side dish! I will definitely make this again.

This didn't have the impact we thought it would.  We didn't taste the cheese or sour cream like we thought we would.  The garlic flavor was good but we will look for another recipe.

This was good but not my favorite. It needs some more seasoning. I think if I try this again I will season the chicken before adding the bacon and spinach

This is a great recipe!!  I had to make a couple of minor alterations since I wasn't able to fold the jumbo-sized chicken breasts that I used for this recipe.  First, I replaced the slices of bacon with crumbled bacon and added it to the sour cream / spinach mixture.  I then added melted butter on top of the jumbo chicken breasts before sprinkling them with lemon pepper spice!  The meal was gobbled up by my girlfriend and I in a few minutes.

i used frozen spinach (thawed), mozzarella, feta, and cheddar cheeses, paprika, jalapenos, and a squirt of ranch dressing in addition to the original sour cream mix (no pepperjack cheese, though). this was such a fancy looking dinner, yet it was incredibly easy to make! rolling up the chicken breasts was made easier by pounding them thinner between two pieces of plastic.

served with asparagus and the Traditional Mashed Potatoes recipe from this site.

I cooked the garlic in a pan with olive oil and added in the fresh spinach...it reduced down A LOT!! I pounded the chicken to about 1/2inch and didnt have any toothpicks so just filled with the spinach and then folded the other half of the chicken over it, it worked great and looked very pretty! This was very good but my chicken turned out a little dry, so maybe the cook time should be reduced.  The pepperjack cheese is yummy!!

This was really good!  It was really messy to make too.  I had to use the bacon and lots of toothpicks to keep the chicken together.  But the taste was awesome!  Will make again when I have the time to prepare.

My husband loves this, I make it all the time.  I like to cook the bacon a little in the microwave just so the part wrapped around the bottom of the chicken doesnt get all soggy and it gets a lot of grease off.  The pepperjack is so good, one time i didn't have any so I use roasted green chiles to add some kicked it was good to.  Don't add anyting more with salt in it, it makes it way saltly, learned that the hard way.  Its perfect the way it is!!Oh I never use te buttermilk I just throw the chicken in, its great.

this recipe was a big hit with my family. i changed it a little. Instead of wraping the bacon around the chicken, i cooked it and mixede it with the spinach sour cream and cheese. Then i made a breading out of corn flakes, flour and taco seasoning.

This was delicious and EASY!  I soaked the chicken in buttermilk for 2 hours as suggested and substituted Prosciutto for the bacon - increased total cook time to 45 minutes!

WOW this was great...
I am soooo going to make this recipe again..
At first i had my doubts when i was trying to roll the chicken breast, everything was falling out on the side, which made me kind of panic...which made me realise that next time i wll not over stuff the breast, and wwould slice the chicken breast much thinner...
But after they came out of the oven, they were perfect, i had the perfect spinach stuffed chicken breast
I cant waite to do it again for my girlfriends!

I made this recipe last night and it came out wonderfull. Even my two year old eat it. The chicken was moist, tender and very very tasty. The spinach was great. Everything was great and super easy. It took me like 15min to prepared and 30-45 to cook. I would defently do this meal again

I have made this twice and people have loved it both times.  You really can't mess it up and it is easy.  I use the turkey bacon and low fat sour cream.  next time I will try and soak it in the butter milk.

Loved it!  I used 10 oz. package of frozen spinach and added a tbs. of minced jalapeno because I ran out of pepper jack and used some cheddar too.  Might precook bacon a little next time for my son who likes it crisp.  Thanks!

Looks and tastes great! My hubby and I do like spicy foods so I added some crushed red pepper and cajun seasonings, otherwise, made exactly how it is listed. Will make again!

This recipe was excellent.  I didn't drain the spinach because it added to the flavor of the filling.  To thicken the mixture, I omitted about 2 tablespoons of sour cream and replaced it with cream cheese.  Also, I skipped the bacon and seasoned both sides of the chicken with garlic powder and Emeril Essence.  Lastly, I added about a fourth a cup of chopped roasted red pepper.  This is a keeper.  Can't wait to make it for my friends.

I don't know why, but this came out tasting a little funny. Then I realized it might have been because I accidentally used a maple bacon which made it taste kind of sweet; didn't really mix well with the spinach and sourcream. Anyways, maybe will try again paying more attention to what kind of bacon I use

This recipie was great. I did sautee the spinach in garlic and olive oil befor mixing it in the dip. But I also ran a knife through the spinach after I cooked it to make it creamier.

This dish was very tasty though not spicy, as the description mentions.  I love spicy food & this would have been really yummy with thinly sliced jalapeno wrapped up with the spinach mixture.  I also found, like others, the recommended quantities for the spinach mixture was toooooo much.  I would cut the sour cream & cheese down by 1/2 next time.  I would keep the same amount of spinach & garlic *gotta have that garlic** :-)  The cooking time was accurate though I wish I had broiled the chicken for maybe 2 more minutes.  I used turkey bacon & it just doesn't brown as easy as pork bacon.  Though I don't eat pork bacon, I would recommend that those trying this recipe for the flavor choose pork.  For those of you that are health conscious, use the turkey bacon (FYI:  I did use 99% lean chicken, fat free sour cream, & reduced fat cheese)

Very tasty!  I loved the spinach filling and the chicken was extremely tender.  I used a tomato/basil cheese that was delish!  The only change I would make the next time is to wrap these in prosciutto, only because I prefer the flavor.  Thanks!

Very simple and quick to make. I made it per the recipe the first time and we loved it. The next time I put in a few canned chopped chiles in the mix and topped it with more chedder jack towards the end of browning. Served it with a spanish rice, black beans, and warm tortillas.

This was pretty good, I left out the bacon and changed the cheese to mozzerella and used frozen spinach instead.  I think I would add more cheese next time, maybe do a mix of cheeses.

I made this dish yesterday after reading the reviews I changed a few things about it. I added about 5oz of Spinach rather than the 10 oz. I took the garlic and some butter and sauteed the spinach in a pan rather than cooking it in the microwave. I also added mushrooms to the sautee which gives it an awesome flavor!!!  After I sauteed the Spinach I put it in a bowl and added the other stuff... I also added as much cheese as I felt necessary... along with some Feta Cheese for more flavor.  

I accidentally bought breast tenderloins instead of what i intended (i think the full breast is way too much for this recipe...) so what I did was pounded them a bit wider and thinner and did it that way.  I also excluded the bacon because I don't eat bacon.  The butter/garlic that I sauteed the spinach in gave it a nice taste.  I've considered marinaiding the chicken in something before using it because like a few people said before it doesnt have enough OOMPF!!  Otherwise its a very good recipe and I would certainly make it again!!!

I changed this to substitute sauteed mushrooms with garlic in place of the spinach (my husband does not like spinach). Also, to save calories I wrapped the chicken in only one bacon slice rather than two.  No toothpicks were necessary.  This was a hit with my family, who is already asking when we will have it again!

More cheese (like 3x), a little seasoning of the spinach mix, and a little seasoning on the chicken made this grrrrreat! Looked impressive and yet so easy to make.

This is a really great recipe!!!  I am making it for second time this week.  I had alot of leftover liquid once I mixed all the spinach and stuff up. This I set aside and used later (warmed up) to pour over chicken once it was cooked.  Every one has said how it is a bit bland, so I have added some butter to my leftover sauce and a bit more cheese.  This mixed well with the garlic and gave alot more flavor.  All in all a fantastic recipe.

I've made this recipe twice now, the first time, by the recipe, but it was a little bland for me, the second time I added sundried tomatoes and pinenuts...I liked the second version  better, but either way it's sure to be a crowd pleaser and will remain a favorite of mine.

YUM! I seasoned the breasts w/seasoned salt and ground pepper. To add some KICK to the recipe I added some crushed red pepper flakes to the spinach mixture. Not bland at ALL. Next time I will probably just lay the bacon on top as the underside was uncooked and I should have taken it out of the oven sooner, but I was trying to crisp up the bacon. I may pre-cook some bacon next time and I WILL be making this again soon! Plus I used a lot more pepperjack than called for. YEAH!

This was a pretty good recipe.  The chicken turned out very tender and it made our whole house smell wonderful. I'm not a huge fan of spinach, as my husband is, but I REALLY enjoyed the flavor of the pepperjack cheese and sour cream blended. The bacon strips were a nice twist to the recipe and the juices from the pan were good to drizzle over the chicken breasts for extra flavor. Thank you for this recipe!

My stepkids could not eat enough of this, and they are the most picky eaters I know. I've been married to my husband for three years - this is the first recipe that got me at 10/10. The highest before was an 8/10. Definately a favorite, and not a terrible amount of work, but not a little bit either.

My family loved it!  I substitued colby jack for the pepper jack cheese because my family doesn't like spicy cheese, and it turned out wonderful!  Next time I am going to put asparagus spears in the middle with the filling and see how it turns out.

Only changes was butterflying chicken instead of pounding, and cooking bacon a bit before cooking.  Very good.

I didn't have pepperjack cheese and I used  Colbyjack. 
I also seasoned the inside of the chicken with peppercorn grinded extra fine and a spicy season salt lightly on both. It was great!!! Thank you

Fantastic recipe! Although I had to swap out the sour cream for cream cheese instead. In the middle of a bad snow storm stores were closed. Next time I will try it with sour cream.

Very very good!  I will definitely be making these again sometime.  I followed other comments and soaked the meat in milk with vinegar for a few hours, and I also added curry to the seasonings.  I'm not one for pepper or hot spices, so I toned it down.  This is a fantastic recipe for instructions on how to make them.  Anyone can tweak the flavors however they want.  I also used the method of cooking the filling on the stovetop after partially cooking the bacon.  I wrapped the bacon criss-cross over the top and tucked the ends under as someone suggested.  Worked great.  I might try marinating the chicken overnight next time with other flavors since I'm just not a fan of plain white chicken.  I served it with quinoa cooked in chicken broth and slices of tomato wedges.

Turned out great! Trying to watch calories and did not include the sour cream. And used a spicy Colby stick cheese for flavor instead of pepper jack. Husband and son loved it.

I didn't change a single thing and this is definitely a 5-star recipe!  I made it for just the two of us but this could be a company dinner made to impress!  The pepper jack cheese gave it just a little "bite" that went great with the spinach.

I used Chihuahua with jalapeno cheese instead. I marinated the chicken in buttermilk, then seasoned them with salt, pepper and garlic powder. I lightly cooked the bacon and cooked the spinach and garlic in the bacon grease. I absorbed excess with paper towels. It was really good.

I loved this. I seasoned the chicken with garlic powder, black and cayenne pepper and salt. I was out of shredded cheese so i used 1 slice of pepperjack per breast(im sure it's easier to hold the spinach together if you use shredded cheese) I substituted sour cream for greek yogurt and turkey bacon. It was great

I just left out the bacon,  much healthier.  Otherwise made the recipe as stated. Some of these reviews crack me up. They change the recipe entirely, then rate their own version.

Great recipe and easier and faster to do than I expected. I didn't have the pepperjack cheese s used some double smoked old cheddar on hand. Works great too. I suspect most cheeses would. 
He timing for the chicken and the final part for crisping the bacon were bang on for my ovr.
Thanks for posting.

I think it will taste fine but I the filling oozed out all over . . . they were not overfilled by any stretch of the imagination.  There is just no way to roll the chicken breasts that I get at our stores. . . they are "monster" sized so that by the time you flatten them out they are the size of dinner plate and are really odd shaped not to mention when using skinless even with gentle pounding the meat tears apart.   I'd love to say I'd make it for company but visually it is unappealing.   I briefly toyed with making pockets in the breast and stuffing them that way but the breasts weren't plump enough to get a decent sized pocket.    I think I may just revise the recipe to be a casserole of some sort as I like the spinach/cheese combo.   If I want stuffed breasts I will just buy them pre-made from here on out.

I made this for dinner tonight and it looked as well as tasted great. My family raved over it including my very picky daughter. I will definitely make this again. I did season my chicken breasts after marinating them in buttermilk. Wonderful!

I liked the entrée though it took longer than I expected.  The only thing I would do different when I make it again is season the chicken before wrapping with either salt or garlic salt.

Delicious...buuuuut... I did modify with a combination of great tips found in the comments plus added a few other tweaks.  In an iron skillet I sautéed fresh chopped onion (1/2) with 3 large mushrooms sliced and 2 cloves of garlic.  (started with garlic)  I did not pre-cook the fresh spinach.  After pounding out 3 chicken breasts, I let it soak for 1 hour in buttermilk with a little black pepper.  Laying out each breast I added a little cream cheese and sour cream I mixed together and spread onto the breast.  Then I placed the sauteed mixture on that and then the fresh raw spinach.  I accidentally forgot to add the pepper jack cheese but I promise you won't care once you try this.  I rolled it up, added the two bacon slices around and pinned with tooth picks.  Then I sprinkled a little bit of brown sugar and garlic powder on the top and sprinkled a little soy sauce over that.  Cooked at 375 for 35 and then 4 minutes on broil.

Followed a prior reviewer's suggestion to saute the spinach and garlic in frying pan.  I added diced onion.  Flavor was fantastic.   I horizontally divided each chicken breast into two thin fillets.  I preferred this to using a mallet and pounding each fillet into thinner cutlets.  Overall result was yummy!  Served with wild rice and roasted butternut squash.

Delicious recipe--we used the cheese on hand which happened to be cheddar, so it did not have the heat of pepper jack. Outcome was still delicious, and anyone wanting heat could add some sriracha sauce. Compliments received. Easy to make. Will make again.

I made it for my family and they all loved it.
I recommend you to follow "cookie queen's "  review and alterations for the recipe. Especially the "As always-marinate chicken in buttermilk for a few hours before preparing" . It truly makes your chicken moist. Over all it was simple, and very yummy, will definitely make it again.

If anyone gave this a negative review, they must have not made it correctly. This was a super-easy, super-fast meal, that turned out amazing. I will probably add jalapenos to the sour cream mixture next time, but overall this was pretty much perfect.  Another thing I might do next time is add a pinch of salt to the sour cream mixture. I am a bit of a salt fiend though.

I really enjoyed this. Next time I will either use garlic powder or grate the garlic as it has a tad too much garlic flavour. I also wrapped each chicken in 3 slices of bacon. Will totally make this again though. Did not marinate and still had super juicy chicken.

If I made this again I would drain the spinach and double the cheese.

If you love spinach, sour cream, pepper jack cheese and bacon, you will love this! I am not sure how this got any bad reviews. It took me about 10 min prep time. I usually don't like things wrapped in bacon because I hate soggy bacon but this recipe makes it crispy and delicious. I substituted the regular bacon with turkey bacon and it was still just as yummy!

We loved this! I excluded the cheese & added sautéed tomatoes, onion, & garlic to the spinach mixture & used string to keep it together bc I was out of toothpicks lol it came out great! Instead of cheese inside the chicken, I pulled the chicken out after 35 minutes, cut the strings & pulled it off the top, put shredded cheese on each breast, & popped it back in for 5 more minutes. Delicious!

I made it a little lower cal without adding the bacon strips. Instead I fried up 1/4 lb of pancetta, drained off all of the fat and added it to the mix. Fantastic!

as is this recipe needed a lot of work..  bc of most everyone's complaint of this being bland, after i pounded the chicken i marinated it in Grilled Chicken Marinade (on this site) for about 3-4 hours.. i also used Garlic Spinach (on this site) for the stuffing.. i layered mozz slices on top of the chicken breasts, then the Garlic Spinach, then shredded parm.. rolled them up and laid the (partially cooked) bacon on top of the breasts.. baked until bacon was crispy and chicken was up to temp.. we were very happy with the end result.. ty for the inspiration

The first time I made this dish it was just ok.  But last night tried again,  but tweeked the recipe by soaking the chicken in butter milk and wilted the spinach in the bacon grease (as suggested by other chefs (lol) and I used feta, swiss, and cheddar cheese.  Man was this good!! I will defintely make this dish again.

Spinach Stuffed Chicken Breast Haiku: "This was very bland. Too much work, not much payout. But it looked pretty." The chicken itself was just so boring and flavorless, and I followed the recipe, only swapping pepperjack for  Mexican blend. The chicken should've been heavily seasoned, at the very least w/ salt and pepper b4 rolling the spinach mixture inside. DH and I agreed - it looked nice on the plate, and bacon tends to  make everything better, but once we got a bite of the chicken, it tasted like ... just plain chicken. I'd gladly make it again, but would consider a marinade or alot more herbs/spices.

So I got home, ready and excited to make this, and realized I was out of sour cream. I refused to let this deter me from making it, so I substituted the sour cream for cream cheese. I put two table spoons in a glass and heated it for about 15 seconds, then mixed with the spinach and garlic and cheese. I only made half of this recipe so if making a full serving i would suggest 4 table spoons of cream cheese. It came out pretty good, the only down side to me was the bacon on the bottom came out soggy. I would not recommend wrapping this one in tinfoil unless leaving off the bacon as it just becomes floppy rubbery bacon. Over all this was very good and I will make it again. (Next time I will make sure to use sour cream and see how it alters the taste.)

AMAZING!  When I first saw the recipe I wasn't sure about it and if my fiance would like it.  He's not much of a spinach or chicken guy but he loved it.  The chicken came out juicy and not dry.  I think next time I'll add a little red bell pepper.

My family really liked this! It turned out just as pictured. I didn't care for the soft bacon on the bottom so I'll have to try to remedy that next time and I think I will add some salt to the spinach mixture. Otherwise, it was great! I think if you are serving this for company, you could make the chicken rolls up to a few hours ahead of time and refrigerate until ready to bake...that way you can have the mess all cleaned up before company comes!

This is a very delicious recipe. I substituted the pepper jack cheese with cheddar cheese and since I didn't want to use bacon, I used seasoned breadcrumb to give the chicken more flavor. I also topped it with grated Parmesan cheese and parsley. Came out amazing and my husband loves it! This is a must try. :)

I loved this recipe. I did season the chicken and fry that bacon a bit as other reviews mentioned to do. I also added an assortment of Italian cheeses in the mixture and on top of the chicken. Was delicious! Will defiantly continue to make this.

This dish very easy to make.  The only thing I recommend is seasoning the chicken breast a little before you roll and wrap.  I also didn't use the tooth picks, the bacon kept them together pretty well

Moist but bland. I left out the bacon because I've never liked bacon but as someone who grew up eating food from southeast Asia, I thought the dish lacked flavour. Rather uninteresting but perfectly edible.

It was "ok". It could've used more pepper jack cheese and more seasoning. After taking the spinach out of the microwave I should've drained the water out of the bowl before adding the other ingredients. Lastly, I should've turned the chicken over to brown both sides of the beacon. This was waaaay too much prep work.

This was good but I think it lost some of it's spicy flavor as it cooked. Love the flavor of the filling before I cooked it in the chicken. Think I will spice up the chicken next time. But over all it was good. Oh if you decide to use a glass pan do not put it under a broiler. I have never had good results with that. Will try this again.

Simply delicious and easy to make. I made this dish on last night for dinner and it was a hit. I put a twist to it by adding some smoked sun-dried tomatoes.

My family was not a fan.  Prepared recipe as written and the chicken was very bland.  My husband said all he could taste was spinach.  Too bad I wasted all that bacon, lol.

I have made this with my girlfriend 5 times now. We don't use the bacon and sprinkle some salt, pepper, and garlic powder on top instead. Amazing recipe.

This recipe is delicious and easy! I've tried it twice. You may want to season the breasts a bit first as well as add a little salt to the spinach mixture. I'm not a huge fan of feta so I used part feta and part ricotta with a little mozzarella and it came out great.  You also may want to uncover a few minutes before it's done so that the bacon cooks/crisps better.

This was a 4 star for us. Made as recipe stated and it was bland.  Yes, I do ususally season my dishes, but wanted to try this as written. Next time, I am going to try a different recipe that uses feta cheese instead.  I think feta would liven up this dish too.

It was ok, but too greasy for my family  who SHOULD be on a lower fat diet (BUT LOVE bacon). So, next time I tweaked it to lower some fat and salt. I used 6 slices of reduced sodium center cut bacon. 4 slices I fried(or oven bake as suggested) till cooked half way done. then wrapped the chicken in only 1 slice each. The other 2 slices of bacon  I cooked well done, blotted,  and crumbled into the spinach. (I ONLY use fresh, not frozen spinach, and cook in a DRY pan till well wilted, then squeeze dry, before adding other stuff. I too marinate the chicken in buttermilk as suggested, but I add 1t. or so Italian seasoning and 1t. of garlic POWDER to the marinate, and let it marinate AT LEAST 4 hrs. The seasoning penetrates into the chicken and adds flavor. I am not a fan of pepper jack, so I use feta and a hand full of fresh grated Parmesan  cheese in the spinach mixture.  I also like to reduce the sour cream to 1/4C. and add in 2T. of pesto. It adds much more flavor, but makes the dish more Italian in nature. To complete the Italian spin, you could wrap the chicken in 2 slices each (slightly overlapped) panchetta if you like. (no need to fry it first) If you do not like to pound out chicken, you can carefully butterfly it open flat, then roll OR just stuff 1/2 side of chicken, and fold over. If you do it that way, it is easier to lay bacon or panchetta out under the chicken breast before stuffing, then bring the bacon up around the chicken.

DELICIOUS! After I discovered that my husband had eaten all of our spicy Jack cheese, I had to improvise. I used regular Jack, and some roasted Hatch chiles. I had no idea this could be so tasty. Otherwise, recipe made exactly as printed. Thanks.

This was delicious!!! Thanks to all the suggestions I used feta cheese,  sun dried tomatoes,  garlic, with the sour cream. And spinach.  Also for those that don't eat pork I used turkey bacon and it worked great.  Super easy!! Definitely will make again.

The first time I tried this recipe, I made it exactly how directed and found it a little bland. So the second time around I altered the recipe a bit by seasoning the chicken breast with garlic salt and onion powder, put them in a gallon size sandwich bag and left in the fridge for 3 hours. I made the filling exactly the same as last time, except this time I used pepper jack sandwich slices rather than shredded cheese. I put the slices of cheese on top of the filling, after mixing the spinach, garlic, and sour cream, then rolled the chicken breasts. Definitely gave it a lot more flavor than the first time !!

Recipe was good and easy to prepare. My family liked it but it did not get the "wow" factor. I felt it was a little bland even with the pepper jack and the meat was too dry. I am going to make the same recipe with the following changes. 
Marinate chicken first. Add 2 tablespoons feta cheese to spinach mixture. Check after 20 minutes bring temp. up to 155 then broil.

This was so easy to whip up, and tasted wonderful. I only used one slice of bacon per chicken to save on the fat and salt. Next time I may alter it a bit with a different cheese rather than the sour cream to make it a bit thicker? But I have to think about it. I served it with roasted Brussel sprouts, and it was a hit! I will defiantly make it again.

This was very good!!  I will definitely be making this again!  I did do some of the changes that were suggested.  I precooked the bacon and then cooked the spinach in the bacon grease.  Makes sense to me.  I did use cream cheese instead of sour cream.  I don't know why but I grabbed it instead and it turned out yummy.  I didn't realize I messed up until it was all mixed together.  Whoops!  I also seasoned the chicken with seasoned salt.  I also cut the chicken breasts in half so they were thin. Worked very well to roll them out.  Next time I may add a little more seasoning to the mixture.

Fantastic recipe! Tastes great! I sauteed the spinach with a bit of garlic. I didn't add sour cream. I tweaked a few things because I was out of a couple items. Instead of adding pepper, I marinated the chicken in chipotle pepper marinade and sprinkled it with some crushed french fried onions. Sure hated that I was out of bacon, but next time I will wrap it in bacon.

We had a lot of the stuffing left over, so we decided to use it to stuff some fresh mushrooms we had on hand.  They both worked our wonderfully.  The second time we made it, we also mixed in fresh chives &  finely diced tomatoes!

Really wanted to like it.  Looked at the recipe, liked all the ingredients.  It smelled great while cooking.  I had a couple of bites and just couldn't eat any more.  Kept thinking I missed something, but have re-read the recipe and I cooked it spot on.  Tasted very bland, no integrity of the flavors.

I followed one reviewer's advice and cooked the bacon halfway and then cooked the garlic and spinach in the remaining grease. I followed the original recipe after that, and it was amazing. My boyfriend loved it; no leftovers here!

Saw the video and it looked delicious. My husband and I gathered the ingredients exactly according to recipe. I read about 20 reviews and based off them I cooked the bacon half way in a pan and then cooked the fresh spinach and garlic in the bacon grease. Even after pounding, my chicken was too big to wrap so I had to shave it down a little. My family absolutely LOVED it and they are finicky eaters. 35 minutes on 375 and then 5 minutes on both sides at 500 degrees. Next time I make it I will season the chicken.

Really great recipe. Make sure you pound your breasts really thin so you can have a full wrap and your stuffing won't ooze out. Also partially cook the bacon before wrapping. Overall a great recipe and good change from the normal chicken recipes.

This is really tasty! Pounded the heck out of the breasts, but not thin enough to roll nicely. Next time I'll try butterflying the breasts as in  Laurie Wheeler's recipe of the same name. Served with the "Classic Macaroni Salad" recipe. Raves from the family.

I also changed this up a little.  Instead of sour cream I used Alfredo sauce. I used a mozzarella and provolone combo. I precooked the bacon like most of you did. Then I put it over penne pasta with Alfredo sauce.  Delicious.  Very easy too. Definitely will make again.

In the video it says to cook the spinach for 3 minutes on low in the microwave but I had to put in on high for 3 minutes to get the spinach to wilt - on low nothing happened with the spinach.  Other than that the chicken was just great!

I can't believe the low calorie count. A full half breast was too much for us, so the dish came under 200 calories. The weight of the chicken is a good measurement to have, I suspect the breasts used in the recipe were smaller than what I had. Yes,it was delicious.

I will no doubt make this again. I followed the other reviews suggestions in half cooking the bacon and using the grease to fry up the spinach. I used provalone cheese and added peppers and mushroom. Also, adding a few small cuts of jalepeno really adds a slight after kick.

Fantastic recipe! I made as directed, except I sauteed the spinach in 1/2 TBSP salted butter, and omitted the bacon (didn't have a good sale at the store and I don't particularly care for bacon in my entrees). The chicken was terrifically moist and the pepperjack gave it a nice kick. It's a great base recipe - I will definitely add my own tweaks next time I make it!

Amazing! I changed the recipe to lessen the calorie intake. I've made stuffed chicken breast before and this version was my FAVOURITE. Instead of pepperjack cheese, I used crumbled low fat feta. I also added sun-dried tomato. I used low fat sour cream. I didn't do the bacon, either. The final product was a thing of beauty and tasted amazing. I will make this recipe again and again and again.

This is one of my boyfriends favorite dishes I make. It is super yummy. Like some of the other reviews I half cook the bacon and then cook the fresh spinach in the same pan as the bacon. Always use fresh spinach not frozen. I will definitely be making this again and again.

Probably my new favorite way to make chicken! It was such an easy recipe yet it looked and tasted like a professional chef would have cooked it. The pepper jack cheese adds just the right amount of spice to the flavor! Very yummy! Thanks for this recipe!

You can never go wrong with bacon! I followed the recipe as instructed and it turned out great. My only modification for the next time will be to cut the bacon slices into small segments and lay them across the top of the chicken. I like my bacon more well done and the juices prevented the underside from cooking.

I loved this Recipe. My boyfriend and i like really spicy so i chopped some fresh Jalapeno and placed it under the Spinach mixture. I also added a little shredded Parmesan cheese to the mixture. It was perfect. My Boyfriend and i both loved it. Will be making it again.

Made this tonight and it was very good but thought the chicken was a bit too dry on the outside (but tasty on inside)...DH loved it - had with carrots from this site (brown sugar, butter and dill (I used rosemary as didn't have dill)) and leftover mac and cheese    :)

This was a very good recipe but I felt that the bacon made it a little too greasy.  I will make this again but omit the bacon.

I really enjoyed this recipe, i change it up a little bit though. I used frozen spinach instead, defrosted it and tossed it in a pan with fresh minced garlic and EVOO, and added some chicken stock for extra flavoring. I then pounded my chicken breasts into flat pieces so it would be easy to roll up, I then would stuff my spinach , a little mozzarella (since im not a huge cheese fan), a sprinkle of parm. cheese, and some roasted red peppers. I rolled all that into the chicken and then wrapped my chicken with the bacon.   It was great, juicy and tender, and a hit in my household!

Was very delicious, tender and flavorful. Made just as the directions stated other than adding season all to chicken before stuffing. Didn't used toothpicks because I wrapped bacon pretty tight. Next time I would season chicken a little more as well as the spinach (with some salt).

We had high expectations for this dish, it held a lot of promise, but seemed to fall flat.  The filling was creamy, the chicken was tender and bacon was crisp, but I guess we expected more.  we followed it as written.

Awesome! After reading other reviews I decided to just cook the bacon in a skillet, wilt  the spinch in the bacon grease with garlic, and just crumbled the bacon into the spinach stuffing before cooking it. I served it with a vegtable rice side dish and it was great!

I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream because it's all I had. It turned out very good and moist!

OMG!  I made this out of leftovers in the fridge and it couldn't have been more gourmet! Out of necessity i used cream cheese instead of sour cream and added a little parmesan cheese too! YUMMY, cook this when you want to impress anyone with your skills, they will never know how easy.

Amazing recipe!!! The only thing I changed was the cheese. I live in Poland and couldn't find pepperjack. But the cheese I used was great!!!

I was really excited about this recipe. I loved how simple it was. My only complaint is that it wasn't seasoned enough. Next time I will add more seasoning to the stuffing as well as season the chicken before wrapping with bacon.

This was delicious and so easy! I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream b/c I didn't have any on hand. Also cooked the bacon a little bit first. I sauteed the garlic with mushrooms in the bacon grease and then added the spinach for about 2 minutes. I cooked 25 minutes at 375 and then 6 minutes on 500. MMMM!

Oh my! This dish was amazing and my boyfriend loved it too! Anything wrapped in bacon leads to a girlfriend win for the night, hahah. Instead of pepperjack cheese I used goat cheese along with a little bit of sour cream, it made the spinach/cheese mixture really creamy and moist which also made the chicken really moist. Thank you!

I made this and used all the ingredients. It turned out horrible. Not only was it very time consuming but it had such a bland taste to it. Would not consider to make it again, but would consider altering the recipe to give it more flavor.

My husband doesn't like sour cream, but he does like this recipe!  I usually use lite sour cream, but we love it.  It's a good way to get the kids to eat spinach.  Thanks!

Fantastic and easy to make.  I just butterflied the chicken, rather than slicing and stuffing and rolling.  It's easy and tasty.  You could do it without the bacon.  I also substituted fat free sour cream and it worked well.  Great crowd pleaser.  Would be perfect for a buffet.

I followed this recipe almost exactly, only substituting turkey bacon because my family doesnt eat pork.  This dish was delicious and the presentation was so much prettier then most things i usually make.

My family was impressed with the taste and the look of this dish.  I could certainly serve this when company comes over, and my family is very eager for me to make it again.  It even got the one member of my family who despises veges to enjoy the spinach.

Made this tonight for my boyfriend who loves any meat wrapped in bacon.  We both loved this.  I used shredded cheddar cheese because thats what was in the fridge.  I also used frozen spinach, again, because thats what I had at the time.  The bacon made this chicken extremely flavorful and tender.  I will definitely make this again, but maybe try another type of cheese like the pepper-jack or mozzarella.

My family enjoyed this. Thank you for the recipe..it's tasty! I didn't have any pepper jack cheese so I substituted swiss and threw in a pinch of nutmeg for good measure. I also par-cooked the bacon as suggested...I will definitely make it again

This was excellent. I read all the reviews and thought about doing it a little differently or adding other ingredients (which I always do), but then decided it sounded great as-is. And I'm really glad I didn't change it (much!). The only thing I did differently is add a little salt to the spinach filling and salt and pepper to the breasts before cooking. The fresh spinach is awesome, the garlic flavor is robust, and the bacon adds a delicious smokey flavor that really makes this dish stand out. A big plus - it was so easy!! I love it - and will be making this dish often!

A good recipe and could be great with some tweaking. Needed more flavor from the cheese. Chicken and Bacon turned out wonderful, juicy and tasty.

5 words, YUM, YUM, YUM, YUM, YUm!!   I lightened it up by using Turkey bacon and light sourcream and it was still a big hit.   Since I was making it for the kiddies I substituted out the pepperjack cheese for provolone and mozzarella, was still awesome.  Definately a keeper.  Thank you!!

WE LOVE THIS RECIPE. FAST & EASY.. I MARINATED 2 CHICKEN BREAST WITH 1/3 MILK AND 1 TSP OF VINEGAR AND SEASONED IT WITH GARLIC, ONION POWDER AND RED PEPPER. IN A SAUCE PAN I PARTIALLY COOKED 4 STRIPS OF BACON AND WITH THE GREASE I ADDED 2 TSP OF MINCED GARLIC, 2.5 OZ OF RDY 2 EAT SPINACH, WHEN THE SPINACH WAS RDY I PUT IN A BOWL AND ADDED 1/4 CUP OF SOURCREAM AND A PINCH OF SALT. I THEN PROCEEDED TO TAKE THE BREAST AND SIMMER BOTH SIDES IN THE SAME PAN AS THE BACON DRIPPINGS MED HEAT FOR ABOUT 5 MIN ON EACH SIDE. WHEN ALMOST DONE I PUT IN A CASSEROLE DISH ADDED THE DIP AND WRAPPED WITH BACON PUT IN OVEN @ 400 FOR 10 MIN. ON A BED OF WILD RICE. ALL WAS GREAT!!! TAHNKS 4 THE RECIPE..

One thing that really ruins it for me is when the chicken breast turns out dry.  The breast was not horribly dry, but it definitely was not moist and juicy.  Being pounded thinner and making sure the stuffing and bacon cooked long enough probably overcooked the chicken.  Also, I feel that the stuffing tasted underseasoned and bland.  I tasted the garlic-y spinach, but there wasn't much more kick than that, even with the 1/2 cup of pepperjack.

Very good.  I marinated the chicken breasts like another user suggested in buttermilk for 3 hours before baking.  I also used Turkey bacon instead and browned lightly before baking.  A touch of cayenne pepper made this very delicious.  Will make again.

cooked bacon first and cook spinach in it. Dry chicken before putting in the oven. Left chicken in milk/buttermilk before cooking for several hours . used mexican cheese, parmasan cheese instead.

Delicious! Used HOT buffalo cheddar cheese and 2 jumbo-size chicken breasts (about a pound each). I couldn't wrap the bacon because breasts were too big, so just laid 4 slices on top.  Had to cook those jumbo breasts longer too, about 45 minutes, plus the 5 min. to brown the bacon.  Very juicy. Great w/ rice.

Great dish!!!  I didn't pound out the chicken, just used thin sliced and folden in half over mixture - worked great!  Used red and black pepper to season and John Henry's mohave garlic seasoning on chicken and mixture.  I also used the leftover spinach mixture in scrambled eggs the next day - wonderful!!!

This was such a great dish. I had company over and they loved it. I didnt use bacon, instead I sprinkled the some extra crated cheese on top. Was moist and had lots of flavor.

It was okay. it didn't taste as good as I thought it was going to. I did use turkey bacon though so that could have made a difference.

I made this on a whim and got rave reviews!  I did not, however, make as is--I sauteed onion, garlic, and about 1/3 of a package of frozen spinach (use good quality--the generic frozen spinach can RUIN a dish), as well as a 1/2 of a can of diced italian tomatoes.  Used reduced fat mozzerella and ff sour cream and no one can tell the difference.  Seasoned the chicken with seasoned salt and pepper. Oh, and I also used turkey bacon (can you feel the low-fat theme?).  Overall a great base recipe that any cook with a bit of knowledge can make to work for them--it is a bit messy, though, so I would get someone to help prep.

Can't really rate this recipe fairly because I didn't have alot of the ingredients so I improvised. Only had chicken tenders so I pounded them flat and layered them in a glass dish with the stuffing in between. Used frozen spinach, onion, and italian sausage in the stuffing. Cooked bacon halfway before topping chicken. This would be better with some marinara

I used chicken thighs instead for a family get together and I eyeballed all of the ingredients. It came out delicious.
I would recommend not draining the bacon fat once it melts because it helps to retain alot of the moisture and the meat tastes even better.

A little bland as written, however, it turned out extremely well with added seasonings. I also sauteed chopped mushrooms and added that to the spinach mixture and used parm instead of the pepperjack. Very good base recipe that you can certainly play around with. Thank you!

I thought this was bad.. I could only eat a couple bites, the mixture inside seemed like it was missing something.
Gave it 2 stars because my husband liked it (however, in his batch I omit the spinach inside).

This is a very easy and good recipe. I only rated it a 4 because the way it is, is a little bland for our taste. Add some poultry seasoning and some salt and it's a 5. I really like this recipe and use it on a regular basis. Also, if you have filling left over add some Parmesan cheese and some artichoke hearts and it makes a good hot spinach dip for an appetizer. Thank you for this recipe!

Based on other reviews I had made this for a dinner party.  Took advice and marinated chicken in buttermilk with italian season and seasoned chicken before rolling with weber chicken seasoning.  This dish still was unbelieveably bland.  Although non of my guests said anything negative the silence while they ate spoke for itself.

Its true these are a little bland. I added a little cayenne (it wasn't enough) and made a cream spinach sauce over pasta. Good, but not great. I made this 4 stars, because I think its a great recipes, but needs to have someone to tweak with it. I will definitely make again, adding fresh herbs, more garlic and some hot stuff.

I made this recipe to the detail. I didn't like it at all, The chicken was too dry even after I soaked it in milk as another user suggested. I also had sauce left over and I was thankful for this. The sauce is awesome so after the chicken was done I used the sauce to eat with the chicken and pasta.

OMG this recipe was awesome and just as good or even better the next day!! The only thing I added was that I seasoned the outside of the chicken with Emeril's Essence. Definitely gave the chicken a lot of great flavor. The prep work was so simple and quick. I will definitely be making this often as my fiancee LOVED it.

Very good recipe!
I left the bacon off. I also had a lot of the mixture left (chix breats were small) so I added some cream of mushroom soup to THIN it and spooned it on top before I baked. It made a lovely sauce!

ENJOY!

This was very very good.  I used prepared basil pesto in place of fresh garlic and also added some paprika.  Instead of the cheese called for (rarely have that on hand) I used low moisture mozzarella and freshly grated parmesan.  I threw in a little lemon zest, too.  I didn't bother marinating the chicken breasts in buttermilk as some suggested, since I've always been happy with the quality of chicken I buy.  This recipe fully deserves the 5 stars!  I just can't help but tweak.  Delicious.

This was wonderful.  I made enough of the spinach mixture to freeze for a quick and easy dish next go round.

I used frozen spinich instead of fresh, think I used too much.  Next time I will use more cheese and sour cream and less spinich.  The spinich was too overpowering for my taste but my husband liked it.

This is absolutely delicious! I made this once with the sour cream and just made it again tonight but didn't have any sour cream so I just mixed the garlic, spinach, and cheese together and  I also used turkey breasts instead of chicken....very very tastey. My hubby INHALED it! I'll continue to make this dish.

This recipe is amazing!  I changed a few things.  Instead of bacon I used the remaining spinach mixture and added it to the top for the last 5-10 min. It was so good!

Some modifications: I marinated the chicken in buttermilk, rolled it in a thyme/parmasean mixture before stuffing, and substituted dill Harvati cheese in the spinach. Only had room for one piece of bacon around each roll, but the outcome was superb! The boyfriend absolutely loved this. Will definitely make again.

good flavor in the meal overall.  The chicken itself is a bit bland.  I will make it again but I will definitely season the chicken with some sort of dry rub prior to rolling but after pounding to desired thickness.

This turned out ok but was kind of messy. I would definitely pound the chicken to 1/2 inch, but even then they were hard to roll up. I ended up with a piece of chicken folded over. The taste was great though! Maybe I just need to try again.

Yummy! Followed other reviewers' suggestions, I also cooked the bacon briefly. For the filling, I used 8~10oz of frozen spinach with ~1cup of pepperjack cheese, plus addinional spices. The outside of the chicken pices are dredged with seasoned flour mixture. Filled the floured chicken pieces with spinach filling then wrapped with bacon. Lined a dish with aluminium-foil (very easy cleaning), baked covered for 35min and uncover to broiled for 5min but bacon never browned. Still tasted very good!

I was running out of ways to spice up chicken, then I found this decadent recipe.  I actually used split chicken breasts and stuffed them with cheese, fresh, wilted spinch and tucked two strips of bacon over the top.  They came out baked to perfection

This turned out wonderful! I really just glanced at the recipe and did my own thing though.  I mixed yogurt with spinach, salsa and taco seasoning, and laid slices of pepperjack cheese on the chicken, then rolled it up and didn't wrap bacon around it. Used skewers to hold it all together. Yum!

I am a vegetarian but my boyfriend is not, and he is not a vegetable frendly guy so I made this recipe without the spinach.  Not only was this a fun recipe to make but really easy.  he loved it and gave it 5 stars.  I did the buttermilk suggestion and used cheddar cheese and monterey jack and seasoned the sour cream.  When I make it again, I will set some filling aside and ad the spinach for something on my plate. Thanks for posting!

this was a smash hit at dinner.I had to double the recipe for my house.added a few spices. my son and husband (who do not eat spinach)ate the left over filling slightly heated  with french bread cubed watching a football game. (it keeped them quiet) cooking the bacon slightly before. is a good idea. less grease.

This recipe was pretty good... one suggestion - I tried to get down on fat and sodium by making this with turkey bacon.  It did not work too well.  It hardly had any flavor, so I think I found the one recipe where I will use the real stuff.  The mixture got really watery on me, so I think I will cool the spinach first next time (and drain the liquid of course).  Overall a good recipe.

These turned out pretty tasty.  However, I think the chicken could have used a bit more seasoning and there seemed to be too much filling for four chicken breasts.  I took the advice of another reviewer to cook the bacon for 2 minutes in the microwave before wrapping the chicken.  Then I broiled it at the end of the cooking time.  This would also be good with other cheeses such as swiss or mozarella.

So GOOD! The boyfriend loved it! I added some feta as a previous reviewer suggested, and cooked the bacon on the stove about half way before wrapping it around the chicken. This was really a great recipe! Thanks for posting.

This was very good, as written - although I used 6 chicken breasts & did not increase the filling amounts, it was perfect. Easy & great flavor, thanks!

It was good, but pretty bland. Next time I definitely will add more spices to the spinach stuffing mixture.

Deliciousness! I've been looking for a good recipe that incorporates spinach and this has definitely been added to my list. I did not use the bacon in hopes of making it a bit healthier and it was quite good but next time i'll incorporate more salt or use the bacon.

I loved this recipe.  I made it as is expect I left out the bacon to be healthier.  But next time I think that I will try the bacon to give it a little bit of a salty flavor.  Will definitely make this again.

This was the best!  I used regular cheese instead of the pepperjack and I used about 4 slices of bacon per chicken - it was the best!  The entire family loved it!

This is SO YUMMY! It is very simple to make and taste/looks gourmet. The ONLY thing I did different was use mozzerlla cheeze instead pepper-jack. But seriously this is a must try!!!

My family picked their way through this one, and I really thought it would be a winner. As other reviewers said the bacon just didn't get as crispy as I like. And even if I left it in the oven longer I don't think the bottom would have crisped up, because there was so much liquid.

i really liked this however, my family gave it a 4.  make sure you get the chicken pounded out so that the meat is even so it cooks evenly. i cooked my chicken til just about done, then broiled to crisp the bacon. i think if you don't do the pepperjack cheese the filling would be rather bland. would be great with a little feta too.

Didn't really like this. I had a hard time getting the bacon done enough for my taste. I like it very crispy. My 3 year old, however loved it. I probably won't make this again, though.

This is honsestly one of the best chicken recipes I've ever made.  I'm not usually a big chicken or bacon fan but all of the ingredrients together are wonderful.  The only change I made was that I only had 5 oz of spinach.  It worked out fine though because I had little chicken breasts.  Next time I'd love more of the filling though.  Thanks for the recipe.

I have to say, this recipe was golden! I made it last night for my husband and I, and he who doesnt like spinach loved it! The bacon addd a nice touch, presentation and taste-wise. Next time I think I may add more cheese, only because we arent big on sour cream and we would have liked more of the cheese taste. Other than that - the recipe as it is was prefect!

I don't know what it is, I just didn't like this much. I think maybe I should have pounded out the chicken a little more. It ended up being pretty chewy, but I did like the spinach mixture.

Very good!  Simple and very tasty.  The only change I made was using regular jack cheese instead of pepperjack, because that's all I had, and it tasted great - in fact I don't think this dish needs any heat.

It was very slightly on the dry side, so I will probably cover the chicken for part of the cooking time next time around, or use a little wine or stock in the base of the pan.  Also, I would turn the pieces over at the end of the cooking time to allow the bacon on the underside to get a little crispy too.

Definitely a keeper - I served mine over couscous but wild rice would also be good, I think, or just serve with a nice salad for those low-carb dieters!

Made this last night and my husband hailed it immediately in his top 5 meals of all time.  I didn't have pepperjack cheese so used a mozzerella/cheddar blend, but added some paprika to give it some extra flavor.  It turned out perfectly... served with fresh asparagus and some rice, it was a delicious dinner that I'll definitely make again!

Delicious! I mixed in some sweeet roasted red peppers into the stuffing and a bit of feta. My boyfriend complained of the 'sourness' of the stuffing but he said overall it was good. I marinated the chicken in milk and ranch dressing mix. and tossed in some whole cloves of garlic under the chicken so we could have roasted garlic with it.

This was wonderful.. I bought thin chicken breasts.. which I think were probably a little too thin, so I think I pound them next time.  I added more garlic.. and low fat sour cream, definitely a keeper

This tasted wonderful, only drawback was I expected the filling to be creamier and it wasnt.  I added lots of extra garlic and seasoned the chicken before hand.  Will make this again

This recipe is excellent as written.  They looked wonderful and tasted as good as they looked.  My huband has requested that they be made again.  If you don't have the time I'm sure their are short cuts as other reviews have done, but they won't be "Stuffed Chicken Breasts".  Try it as directed the first time so you get the full appreciation of this dish.

I made this for my family 3 days ago and they absolutely loved it. The chicken was moist and juicy. The recipe was very easy to follow. I added extra garlic and Tony Chachere's to the spinach mixture and just used sliced cheese instead. I will recommend this recipe to all of my family and friends.

Unbelievably quick and easy to make. Flavor of the spinach mixture is good, chicken breast itself seemed to need a slight tweak for flavor. The wife is a pretty picky eater and really enjoyed it. Will make again.

An excellent dish, the family loved it.  I used regular cheddar instead of pepperjack so I increased the quantity to 2/3 cup.  Three chicken breasts, sliced in half and pounded, easily served a family of five.

Very good dish with lots of flavor. Just watch your cooking time. I overcooked mine slightly and dried it out just a bit. It was still good though but would have been better if it was cooked less. That was my fault though, not the recipe.

This lacked the punch I was looking for.  The spinach was limp and flavorless but the bacon did add a little something to the chicken.

I loved this! I didn't use bacon and I used chicken tender fillets, rolled out very thinly, instead of chicken breasts. I also put the remaining filler on top of the chicken rolls, which kept the chicken very moist. This makes a really great appetizer, but an even greater main dish (with rice). I've had frozen spinach in my freezer FOREVER and now I know a quick recipe to use it up! Thanks.

This was indeed messy but really only during preparation.  My boyfriend liked the stuffing so much he ate what was left over as a dip w/Ritz crackers.  I thought it was good but lacked zing ~ my honey just loved it though.

Tasty! My 9 year old gave this a 3, but the rest of the family thought it worthy of 4 stars, it was a nice change from the usual chicken, next time I will pound the breast until they are really thin. I didn't use the bacon, instead after rolling the chicken breasts I put the extra spinach mixture on as a topping, the chicken comes out really tender! Will make again!

I made this recipe last night (without the bacon wraps) and my family fell in love. It was immediately put on the special occassion recipe menu. It was beautiful to look at and beautiful to taste. Plus it was incredibly easy to prepare. The chicken was so tender that you didn't have to use a knife at all.

My bacon turned out weird-- but I'm also really picky about how cooked my bacon is.  Overall the flavours were good, I just think next time I'll cook the bacon seperately and lay on top like some other people have done to make it easier.

This was a very tasty dish, only I should have browned the chicken longer in the over at the end of cooking as the bacon wasn't dark enought.

This was good but nothing spectacular. I think the spinach mixture had good flavor (I added extra garlic) but overall the chicken seemed a little bland. Still good though, just not my favorite.

Great recipe, great flavor.  I will change a few things around next time-little less garlic, more cheese, sautee the spinach in butter or olive oil, and put the bacon on top to crisp it up.  Will definately be making again though!

Awesome recipe. I found it very easy to follow, and very fun because you can alter how much cheese, gartlic etc., or even change the type of cheese for a different taste and variety. It's been a hit with everyine I've made it for

The chicken turned out pretty tender, and we love spinach. I left out the bacon because I just really hate limp bacon - I can only handle it extra crispy! But the dish was still pretty good. I haven't made it again because of the trouble of pounding out the chicken, stuffing and rolling. I have never been able to do that very well. But for a special occasion, this is a good dish.

The presentation of this dish was very nice; however, I think that the spinach mixture lacked flavor. I will definitely make this again, but next time I may add a little salt and either more pepperjack or some parmesan.

I've made this several times now and it's a big hit! I add a little feta in addition to the pepperjack just because we like the flavor.  I use a little less bacon which I just place on top of the chicken wrather than wrapping it all the way around.  I also don't use toothpicks anymore and it always stays together fine. Thanks for a great recipe!!

This recipe was a smash hit for a dinner party I had. I made one serving with frozen spinach and the other with frozen chopped brocolli. Both were fantastic and very filling. It was so easy I could make this even after a hard day at work.

WOW is all I can say there is little if anything that I would change.  The toothpicks may not be necessary because the bacon holds everything in well.  If you have not tried this one you are missing out.  Also, to the non spinich lover...I don;t like spinich either and this was terrific.

This was a great recipe!  I used habenero cheese for a little extra kick.  I also used turkey bacon and reduced fat sour cream to cut calories.  It was messy to roll up, but after baking was perfect!

This is a great dish... there's no loss to flavor using reduced fat sour cream, and if you're a cheese lover like me you can double the pepperjack.  Fantastic recipe - a staple in my diet.

Wow! Fantastic! Extremely simple recipe for a novice like myself. I was a little concerned about how the presentation would be because it was so messy going in, but I shouldn't have been. I was cooking for my Grandmother (who is a fantastic cook) and some extended family that I wanted to impress and I got rave reviews all around. I got a monterey jack with peppers that was VERY spicy so lots of flavor. Thanks JerseyGirl for making me look so good!

Excellent dish!  I didn't have bacon on hand, so I used some prosciutto to wrap the thin cutlets, and it was fantastic!  This recipe was so simple, but gave very elegent results.  My significant other had made some great dinners for me earlier in the week and I wanted to surprise him with something nice as well... it was a big hit all around.  I wouldn't change a thing, although depending on how you like your chicken a little extra seasoning wouldn't hurt the dish.  Yummy!

Easy and delicious---the bacon flavor really saturates the whole chicken making it sumptuous!  I used parmesean and frozen, well drained spinach and it still turned out great---next time I will use the pepperjack, I just did not have nay one hand.  This recipe is great for the beginning cook.

I love that I could sneak in some spinach on the kids and they loved it! I used more cheese (we love cheese) and more seasoning and it was GREAT and pretty easy to make! We will have this dish for dinner again. Thanks so much.

Very easy to make and very good.  I also changed my cheese to sharp.  I'll try seasoning the chicken with Adobo as another person tried.  Overall very good and I'll definately make this again.

Really good on the GRILL!  I did change the recipe slightly by: marinating the chicken in Newmans Balsamic/Oil dressing for about 15 min. Wilting the spinach only took about 20 seconds in my microwave, the spinach will wilt if it's damnp you don't need to add water, in fact if you do add water to wilt it make sure you squeeze it dry before mixing in the sour cream/cheese/garlic/pepper. I used cheddar instead of pepperjack, added 1/8 C pine nuts and added the cooked bacon to the stuffing (although I'm not even sure it needed it), used less garlic cause the cloves I had were huge.  Also, I put it on the grill instead of in the oven for about 12 min. and it came out perfect.  It may take more or less time on your grill, watch it cause you don't want to over cook the chicken.  The presentation of this dish makes boring chicken a meal you'd serve to guests!

Yummy!  My fiance just ate this up.  I changed the filling to spinach and blue cheese dressing (it was on hand).  Another variation is to coat the chicken with Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mixed in flour.  I think I used 2tbsp flour and 1/2 cu dressing.  The kids liked that one. I also put rice and water in the pan to make a casserole.

Very good dish.  I substituted monterey jack for the pepperjack cheese and used some cracked pepper over the dish before I put in the oven.  Not everyone in my family likes the extra pepper so it is fine with less.

Very good recipe!  I didn't have any monteray jack cheese so I used mozzerella, parmesan and some McLaren's sharp cheddar.  I also wrapped the chicken in prosciutto (sp?)which worked very well.  Thanks for sharing this recipe---this one is a keeper. cheers!

be prepared to wrap the chicken with the bacon immediately. this can be a fun recipe because it's sloppy in the beginning but comes out nice and clean. Enjoy!

Even though I don't normally eat spinach, this sounded so good I had to try it.  I didn't have any shredded pepper jack, so I substituted shredded colby/monterey jack and added about 1/4 Cup parmesan cheese.  I also used the chopped frozen spinach and drained it after wilting it.  And, because of personal preference, I cut way down on the garlic.  The results were fantastic!!  My husband and I both loved it and will make this again and again.  Thank you for a great recipe!

I will definitely make this, again.  The only change I made was that I used frozen instead of fresh spinach.  My husband and I thought the spinach mixture was a little bland.  Next time, I'll add a little garlic salt or garlic powder to it.  I'll also marinade the chicken breasts and maybe sprinkle them with Mrs. Dash.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe, JerseyGirl.

The beauty of this kind of recipe is it's flexibility!  I live in Norway and we don't have pepperjack cheese, so I substituted white cheddar and fresh parmesean.  I also don't have a microwave, so I sauted the spinach and added chopped mushrooms as well.  I pounded the chicken breasts to make them thin.  The description says that this is a 'spicier version', but there is no spice at all in the recipe.  A great addition to my recipes and wonderful for anyone who wants to be creative with ingredients! The sky is the limit with this one! Thanks!

Very good and quite easy to make, this is coming from a person who can burn water! I didnt have pepperjack cheese so i used mozarella and ground peppercorn into the spinach mixture, it turned out very well.

This recipe had a great combination of tastes! I made a few changes that worked out great for time. I placed four large chicken breast in a slow cooker for 4 hours with 2 tbs butter and 2 tbs garlic while I went to church. When I got back the chicken was tender, and just a little pink. I then sliced the chicken and made and opening for the  mixture (minus the garlic). I placed them in the oven on 375 deg for 20 min. Turned out great! Thanks for sharing the recipe my family loved it!!!

My husband and I love this recipe!  I've made this twice, the last time I substituted half of the spinach with sauteed mushrooms and left off the bacon, and it was fantastic!  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was a very good recipe and not difficult.  I fixed it for a dinner party with my friends and they all wanted a copy of the recipe.  I would like to see the spinach/cheese mixture have a little more flavor - I did not use pepperjack cheese (I used a colby and monterey jack mix)which might have given it the extra little kick it needed.

So delish!  I made these for a dinner party and got raves.  It was super easy!  I also used mozarella instead of pepper jack, but I would imagine it would be just as good with a kick!  There was a good amount of liquid extruded during cooking.  Also, I may try turning the chicken breast halfway through cooking next time, so that the bacon can crisp on both sides.

Very good and tasty recipe. I added more bacons than recommended, I just like bacons. Not good for you though.

This was a really good dish, and easy to make.  I suggest adding a few more spices (especially to the chicken itself) and cheese to the mixture.  I will definitely try this dish again!!
