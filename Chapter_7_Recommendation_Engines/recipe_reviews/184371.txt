This is a simple recipie with delicious results. I opted to finish each off with a chocolate drop. Made about 32 medium size cookies.

I don't know how to edit this, but there are some corrections needed! 350 degrees for 8 min - NOT 400 degrees! You don't need parchment. If you have a nonstick pan, they'll stick well from the press and come off easily after baking. enjoy!

I opted for orange extract instead of almond, and added zest of a full orange. It's still missing something. More sugar? Salt? I don't know, but for how buttery/yolk-y these are, I wouldn't make them again.

I agree 350 for 8 - 9 minutes. Parchment paper doesn't work out directly on pan. These are my son's favorite and I have been making them forever. I recently inherited my grandma-in-laws press and it works great.

Five stars for taste but four stars for ease of preparing. The dough would not stick to the cookie sheet with or without parchment paper. I had to put the cookie sheets in the refrigerator and the dough in the freezer to obtain some measure of success with the cookie press. The cookies are delicious even with using unsalted butter.  I would love to make this recipe again but would need to figure out an easier way.
