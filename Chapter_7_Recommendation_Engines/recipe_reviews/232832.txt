These were really, REALLY yummy and a great change from the traditional nachos! I only had an 8oz. bag of Mexican cheese, so I just reduced the mayo to maybe 1-1/2 cups (didn't measure). Also, I wasn't paying attention and added all of the olives into the mix, so I just topped the finished nachos w/ the tomatoes and some green onions. This had really nice flaovr, and we liked the kick from the jalapenos. I will def be making this one again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
