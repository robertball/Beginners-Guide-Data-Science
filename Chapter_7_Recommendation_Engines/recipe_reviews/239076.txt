I didn't have any hazelnut liquor on hand, so I substituted with Kahlua. Still very good and moist! By far one of my favorite brownie recipe to date.

I made the Nutella Brownies. I did not have any hazelnut liqueur, so I added 1/3 cup water in its place. This made a delicious brownie. Very thick and fudgelike. I would definitely make this again.

OMG. These are by far the best brownies I have ever made, and probably in the top 5 of brownies I've tasted. I omitted the liquor. I may have thrown in a shade more butter than is called for and I also like to put a pinch of salt in all my desserts, even ice cream. Anyway, the consistency of these is ABSOLUTELY PERFECT. They have the nice shell on top and are the perfect consistency throughout, even after a couple of days. (They only lasted that long because I portioned them up in the week's meal prepping.) Do yourself a huge favor and make these. You won't regret it.

I love this recipe.  I have made it several times and it is always great.  This time I added chopped hazelnuts for a twist.  I also sent these in for a bake sale, so I baked them in cupcake wrappers for 16 minutes.

Delicious! Just a small change: I did not have Frangelico liqueur, so I substituted it for freshly brewed espresso. I typically don't like very sweet things and always cut back on the sugar in recipes. However, because the espresso is very bitter, I used the full amount of sugar, plus a few tablespoons more and the brownies came out perfect. I added mini semisweet chocolate chips too. Cooled for two hours (very important) and sprinkled with powdered sugar. Note: I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9x11 pan for approximately 25-27 minutes.

Great brownies. I tripled the recipe (used the converter to change it to 48 servings). I baked in a large sheet pan and cut it into 36 bars for decent sized servings. We like brownies around here!

Great recipe.  Kids and adults alike enjoy.  Reduced the sugar a bit,  but then again it is all about personal preference.

Best homemade brownie recipe I have ever made.
Made double batch; used 5 small eggs.  Next time should sub hazelnut extract for the vanilla & add chopped hazelnuts.  Excellent fudgy, chewy texture.

I made this recipe and it came out perfect after I tweaked one little thing. Instead of 2/3 cups of white sugar I upped it to 1 full cup and they were marvelous.

These are by far the best and fugiest brownies I've ever had.  Absolutely delicious.  That said, I was juuuust a tad disappointed that you really don't taste the Nutella or Frangelico per se, but still awesome brownies that will definitely be my go-to brownie recipe from now on.

OMG - these are so good! My son and I made these brownies. We stayed true to the recipe. These were delicious. We topped them with the Chocolate Hazelnut Frosting recipe also found on this site.

I didn't have any hazelnut liquor, so I used Corolans. It didn't taste at all like Nutella, but it was delicious nonetheless. I also added white chocolate chips. They didn't last an hour.
