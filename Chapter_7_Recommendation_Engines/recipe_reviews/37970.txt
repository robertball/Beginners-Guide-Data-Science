Good, I actually tried it with English Toffee ice-cream syrup also and that was great too.

I found this way too sweet. It tasted much more like hot chocolate than cappuccino. The touch of caramel was good though.

This was alright. It seemed a little watery, even with the chocolate and carmel. I might try to make this again if I'm in the mood for it, although I'll try to add some more milk and maybe more coffee and chocolate to make it richer.
