I used regular franks and omitted the ground beef. We thought it was greasy and overly spiced.

This was by far the best chili I have made. I did add more jalapenos and added 2 habaneros. But my family and I love very hot chili. I took this chili to work for a pot luck and everyone thought it was amazing. I highly recommend this recipe.
