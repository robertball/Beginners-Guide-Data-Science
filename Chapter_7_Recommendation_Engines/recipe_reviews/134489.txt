This recipe is fantastic. I love it. I omitted the breadcrumbs,and used crushed up crackers instead. I also broiled the fish for about 5 minutes after baking just to crisp it up a little.

Not for me!  If you do make this recipe make sure you use fresh lemons as the bottled kind dominate the flavor too much.

Yummy! I made a larger volume of the topping by doubling the parmesan cheese, mustard (Honey Dijon was all I had on hand) and mixing in about 2 Tbsp softened butter. It was delicious and my husband loved it. I served it with wild rice and asparagus.

Even my sister, who usually despises fish, ate all of this delicious dinner. I added a little bit of butter on the filets before cooking (which were the frozen type, too!) and then dipped the fish into Honey Mustard salad dressing. This made up for the lack of sauce on top. It was a fabulous fish dish; quick and easy, and very yummy!!!!

My family and I loved this!  The flavor was terrific.  I used brown mustard.  It was a little thick for spreading on the fish so I added a few drops of olive oil. I used this on both tilapia and salmon and it was wonderful!  Will definately make again!

This was a hit! I doubled the paste to get a thicker cover, and I also added some white cooking wine. Next time, I will broil the fish for a few minutes to try to crisp up the "crust". I already have a request for this fish for next week!

One of our favorites!!  Very tasty and the mustard helps cut some of the fishy flavor.  Have tried mustard mixture on other types of fish and just love it!

this was good!  italian bread crumbs aren't something that i've ever found in europe, so i added some italian herbs to the paste instead, and sprinkled the fish with fine breadcrumbs (paneermeel) and seasoned with sea salt.  came out delicious.  will definitely make again.

This is great! I omitted the baking part and put these in our electric smoker. I exchanged the Worcestershire for balsamic vinegar and the lemon juice for chicken broth (I didn't have a bottle of white wine opened...that would have been better!). I exchanged the oregano for basil, and added extra of the seasonings it called for. I had to add extra seasonings and liquid to make it the right consistancy. I omitted the bread crumbs. This is not real pretty, but it is SOOOO GOOD! We don't like  Worcestershire sauce and bread crumbs usually just make things saltier than they need to be. The way I made it is a definate 5 star recipe. Thanks so much for the idea!

I have tried to make fish in a number of different ways and my husband really only likes fillets coated in flour and lemon pepper and fried in butter... until now! We have a winner! I used some random Russian vodka mustard I had in the fridge from a gift basket and it was still good! I think you could use any type of mustard and this would be good! I also used crushed crackers for the top. I'll be saving this one as my new tilapia go-to recipe. Thanks!

Overall, a yummy dish...after modification.  First of all, I think cooking tilapia for 10 minutes is a bit too long.  This is usually a very thin fish, and cooking to long makes it tough and rubbery.  I cooked mine for about 7 minutes.  then, after topping with paste and crumbs I broiled for 5 minutes.  Nice and crisp without being over done.  Second, the sauce as shown is far too spicy, tangy...mustardy.  I added honey to mine (to taste); it cut some of the tang, and added a wonderful sweetness that paired nicely with the herbs.  Also, make sure you're a fan of herb flavors before making this.  I happen to love them, but for those who don't it can be too much.  Good dish with modification.

WONDERFUL recipe.  I didn't add the breadcrumbs, but did everything else the same.  A recommendation to you all - Costco's frozen tilapia fillets are incredibly good.  Well worth the price!  We served this on a bed of spinach with roasted veggies on the side.  It was a great Weight Watchers meal and a new favorite.  THANKS!

This was interesting.  For once my finished product looked like the picture.  I didnt realize till later that it was because it was also broiled for a few to brown it up.  I will probably make again.  It was easy and it was a new combo of flavors for fish rather than the same ole same ole, so kudos for that.  The kiddos of course didnt like it, but I wasnt expecting them to.  I fix fish for DH and I and usually have to fix the kids something else.  Thanks for sharing

Only had the brown spicy mustard and no fresh lemons so I substituted a teaspoon of real lemon..no bread crumbs so I sub'd stale Triskets and almond slivers that I toasted under the broiler a few minutes...
Served it over brown rice with green salad.
Will definately do it again.
Thanks.

Yumm this was good. I used regular mustard and HP Sauce instead of worcestire, and the flavor was still rich. My only suggestion is to double the recipe, even for 2 fillets. I had troubled spreading what there was.

Yum! I've always been a little apprehension when cooking fish, but this recipe changed me. I used frozen tilapia filets and was very liberal with the measurements (as well as the cook time), and it was delicious.  I took the advice of other reviewers and sprayed the top of the fish with pam before cooking. I also did not have fresh lemon so I used white wine vinegar. My mixture wound up not being a paste, so it spread on smoothly. I topped with seasoned Panko and broiled for a couple minutes after cooking to really brown up the top. I will definitely make this again, so easy and tastes so good.

Made exactly as written (exept that I tripled the mustard/paste; I was making fish for 4 people). Everyone really liked it, except for me. I though it was OK, but it kinda had a bitter taste. Still, it was pretty good and so easy.

This is a good, easy recipe that doesn't use a log of ingredients.  A nice way to dress up tilapia for something different.

good for a quick week night dinner, but not my favorite way to prepare tilapia.  I did like the mustardy tang the herb paste offered.

Very easy and yummy. Don't count on a lot of sauce though for rice or noodles. I loved how quick it was to make. My 9 year old son had 2 servings. I could have had more but refrained due to being on a diet. I will make this again.

I think this recipe is great.  I was looking for something easy to do with my tilapia, and this fit the bill.  I used dijon mustard because that's all I had but still turned out great.

Tasty and easy to make!  I broiled the fish at the very end to make sure the top got toasty.

This recipe was good, but it had an odd taste to it that I can't identify. My mom said it was like what she though petrolium (sp?) would taste like.

I started with frozen tilapia so my cooking times were as follows:  7 minutes at 375, 7 minutes broiling with topping, 5 more minutes at 375.  I increased the amount of sauce and added honey as other commenters suggested and made the fortunate mistake of mixing my breadcrumbs in WITH the sauce before spreading it on.  I also coated with a dusting of Parmesan cheese prior to the final 5 minutes at 375.  My husband and I enjoyed it so much that I made it a second time and this time I used the breadcrumbs as directed.  The sauce was too thin and rolled right off the fish leaving it much blander than the first batch.  We will definitely be having this again, amended as described.

Tilapia is such a light fish & worcestershire is just too strong of a flavor for it. None of my family enjoyed this.  The cooking method was easy & the fish was cooked perfectly.

We are trying to eat a little more healthy, and I think this recipe fits the bill.  I doubled the sauce, and used Panko.  I only had Dijon Mustard, and it was great.  Maybe I will triple the sauce next time.  We loved this recipe.

This was terrible. The sauce was strangely coloured, the flavour was awful and it didn't really form a crust. I actually had to dare my husband to take the first bite. Sadly, this one didn't work.

Outstanding...really! I am actually beginning to LIKE fish. I modified just slightly. I didn't have spicy mustard so I used 1 tsp of dijon mustard and 1 tsp of honey mustard. I also sprinkled some extra parmesan along with the bread crumbs. The family loved it...I loved it! Really wonderful!

I'd like to give this recipe 4.75 stars.  We eat a lot of tilapia, and I was looking for a new recipe.  This one was really good.  My husband liked it a lot.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and increased my recipe since I was fixing more than 2 fillets.  I was out of spicy brown mustard, so I used the Grey Poupon Country Dijon, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Very good.  I read the review by the person who said tilapia had a lot of cholesterol, so I looked up some information on it since I have high cholesterol and my husband has recently been told he is border-line type 2 diabetic.  It seems that the amount of omega 6 and cholesterol in tilapia depends on where it was farmed and may have 68 mg per 100.  My package says it has 50 mg, and that isn't nearly as bad as sole, beef, pork, or poultry.  Eggs have lots more, and they have shown now that eggs do not contribute to high cholesterol levels.  Remember, those people reporting these "headline" news items (be it food, politics, or whatever) have to sensationalize their reports to be sure people read them, watch them, or listen to them.  Otherwise, they can't sell advertising which pays the bills for all newspapers, magazines, tv, radio, etc.  THERE IS NO TRUTH IN ADVERTISING!  (I ought to know...I worked in a related field for almost 30 years.)

This was very easy to make.  It added just enough flavor to the fish without taking away the natural tilapia flavor.  I made it first with tilapia and then remade it later on with cod and it worked well with both.

I heeded the advice of the previous reviewers and made double the topping. With such low calories, why not?  I thought I had spicy brown mustard in my fridge, but it was actually tangy dijon (such saucy names!).  Never the less, it turned out great for a dish that was so quick and simple.  This will be in my arsenal for quick dinners.  (Especially since tilapia can be thawed in cool running water.)

I made this as a single serving, but didn't end up with enough toppings- so I doubled. The taste was amazing enough to make up for this. I ate it with asparagus and brown rice- perfect.

Delish! I didn't have any Worcestershire sauce so I used soy sauce and a few drops of honey. I increased the lemon juice and garlic because I like to taste that fresh lemon juice and spicy garlic. I baked it for about 15 mins and then broiled for 5 after adding the topping. Came out wonderfully! Wasn't dry or bland..I will use this recipe on other fish and maybe on chicken too!

Tasty mustard crusting! I used a mixture of 3/4 tbsp of Bertman's Ballpark Mustard (nothing like it!), 1/2 of Dijon Mustard, and  and 1/4 Honey Mustard that was great. Then I forgot the bread crumbs...which was OK. I also broiled the filets for 5 minutes past the baking time to get the crust crunchy.

2 large Tilapia filets, brushed with melted butter and sprinkled with black pepper. I doubled the recipe and used "Mrs. McGarrigle's Red Wine and Garlic" mustard (it is brown and grainy) which gave me the idea of adding red wine to make the consistency less pasty. Baked the filets for 10 minutes, spread the topping, baked for 5 more then broiled for a short time. 
Great taste, moist and flaky. Served with wild rice, carrots and broccoli.

This recipe worked out really well. My only complaint was that the topping did not crust very well and it was kind of mushy on top. I also cooked the fish for five minutes longer than was suggested and it turned out perfectly. The flavors were delicious!

Even on soggy farm-raised tilapia, this recipe was a huge hit with my teenagers.  Normally they avoid fish like the plague; now they are requesting it!  I plan to use it on other kinds of fish as well.

We thought this was just ok. Obviously, a lot of it depends on what mustard you use - I made it with a spicy horseradish brown mustard, and I don't think it complimented the other flavors that well. This wasn't horrible, just not nearly as good as other tilapia recipes I have. Thank you though.

We loved this recipe.  We used horseradish mustard and doubled the recipe to make more of a topping.

This one was really good. Although, I didn't like how pastelike the topping was, but my husband really loved the paste- so if you like a paste rather than a sauce or marinade- this one's for you!

Don't forget to salt and pepper your tilapia!
Double the portion of sauce to completely cover the fish. Add chopped parsley to bread crumbs for color and flavor.

Loved this! I should have made more crust, what I had was good. Tweaked a bit with some cayenne pepper, so good. And it my first time cooking fish, it was tender and moist.

I omitted the bread crumbs, and there was certainly nothing "crusty" about the dish, but we enjoyed the flavor. This is a quick & easy weeknight meal that I'll make again.

I'm always looking for something different to do with fish fillets. This was good. The amount of Parmesan seemed negligible to me. I broiled the fish at the end of the cooking time just long enough to brown the top.

I used double the fish so I had to double the topping.  I wish I had tripled it since I barely had enough to coat the fish fillets.  It was very tasty though since I used a different white fish with skin on, it was slightly fishy, not in the good way.  I will definitely try this again as my boyfriend really loved it.  I served this with the pan-fried asparagus from this site and it was a wonderful dinner.

This was yummy.  I made it exactly like the recipe.  I just wonder why mine didn't come out as crispy as I would have wanted.  Maybe I didn't cook it long enough.

Pretty good, although I have to agree with the reviewer who said this was hard to spread.  I ended up doubling the mustard sauce but not doubling the parmesan so it was more of a spreadable sauce.  I sprinkled heavily with bread crumbs and broiled for 10 min on low so they would toast.  Served with wild grain brown rice and salad.  thanks for the recipe!

Took some tweaking to fit my taste. Trippled the topping and then sprinkled extra bread crumbs and parmesan on top. Made a cajun tarter sauce and drizzled over fish. Served with white rice and black beans.

I have 8 kinds of mustard here and was out of Brown. UGgg. So, I made my own with a mixture of yellow and extra hot horseradish mustard. I found the mixture almost impossible to get on evenly. I was rather frustrated with it. This is not something I see making again. The flavors were just not there for me.

This recipe has the right idea but needs way more mustard (of course this is coming from a mustard lover.)  I used Dijon mustard because that is what I had, but I think spicy brown would be better.

This was pretty good but certainly rich.  I cut down on the cream cheese and it was still rich.  I do think that it would make an excellent dip.

This was quite easy and was reasonably successful. I was unable to eat all of mine (still trying to learn to eat fish unfried, not having much success yet!) but my husband ate his 3 fillets and half of my fillet, so it must've been pretty good to people who like fish anyway! Thanks for the recipe! P.S. I did not find the bottled lemon juice to be overwhelming as another reviewer did.

YUM. I had never made tilapia before and this turned out AMAZING. I followed the recipe pretty much exactly (kinda guessed on the lemon juice and used dijon mustard because it's what I had) and it came out great. Really easy, nice because the breading is very light. I'll definitely make this again.

I Loved this recipe.  I didn't have parmesan cheese so i substitued swiss finely grated and it was super.  I will definately make this again. Maybe use a little more mustard.  I like the extra mustard.

This wasn't *bad*, just a little odd.  The flavors in the topping seemed to compete with the fish (and with each other) rather than complement it.

This was an awesome recipe. I added a little more fresh grated Parmesan after putting the herb paste on the fish before adding the bread crumbs. I think the next time I would cut down the oregano a bit.  Overall though it was fabulous.  I would rate it higher if I could.

I am always looking for different recipes for tilapia and this one is winner. Found it easy to follow 2 serving recipe but using it for serving of 1 as I was doubling paste mixture as suggested by several people - did add small amount of olive oil to make spread thinner - also used panko crumbs instead of bread crumbs and thought it was great. Split out red membrane as suggested which left two different size pieces - cooking at different times. Removed smaller piece after adding spread and baking for 5 mins - then put bigger piece under broiler as suggested for 3 mins - came out perfect. As a WW meal - 4 points

This was pretty good, I actually used pollock instead of tilapia, but any mild white fish will do.  I used two very small...about 3oz each filets and I thought there wasn't enough mustard mixture to cover, probably should prepare about 50% more.

the mustard was a good flavor to go with it, but it lacked more flavor and crust. Eatable, ok, but not a fav.

I am not a person who eats a lot of fish but I enjoyed this dish. I would like the coating to be a bit crunchier but the taste was good.

This was OK.  I think it had a little too much mustard flavor.  I may make it again using only half the mustard.

The photo is deceptive--this isn't breaded all the way around--and you're seasoning filets, not patties.  I followed the recipe with only one necessary change--we didn't have Italian breadcrumbs, so I used Japanese Panko crumbs--and it was quite good. We did have to add salt after it was cooked.  Tilapia is cheap, but it's really hard to find a tasty recipe to make it less fishy for my husband; this recipe dressed it up enough that we'll continue to buy at the great price, knowing we have a good plan at home.  YAY!  Thank you.

maybe I overdid it on the breadcrumbs, but this didnt make a big impression on me. I eat lots of fish and I brush it on the raw fish before I cook it. I will probably try it again and tweak it a little to my prefrence.

It seemed a little strong for the tilapia.  I'm sure it would have been better on a stronger fish or served with rice.

I just had reg mustard, doubled most of everything, used a sandwich sprinkle mix from Penzey's due to having no straight garlic poweder. Also added honey. Put a couple pats of butter in the bottom of the dish and then after it was done cooking broiled for 5min as suggested. I hate fish and this was delicious!

I give you 5 stars because you made fish edible! It was very good! I tried making tilapia before by poaching it, and I was not impressed, as I am not normally a fish eater. I need to lower my cholesterol though and came looking for some different tasty dishes, yours was a wonderful start! Thank you!....Update, unfortunately I found out Tilapia is very high in cholesterol and I am slightly allergic to it, so no more mustard encrusted fish for me.

Five stars, for sure. My husbands loves this dish and I usually make it at least once a week.  The flavors are pretty strong, but complement the tilapia perfectly.  Yum--thanks!

I'm not always a fan of tangy tastes, but this is very good.  I've tried this with dijion mustard and with honey mustard, both are delicious.  I like a lot of topping and so I kept adding ingrediants until I got the voulume I wanted (probably four or five times more), and then I had enough for a sauce for the noodles, too.  One day I got crazy and made this with chicken!

This recipe was ok.  I felt the flavor was a bit too strong for such a light fish.  Maybe I just used too much of the paste on each filet.  It wasn't bad though.  Might tweek it a bit and try again

Wonderful flavor. Like others I doubled
the paste mixture and only had dijon
mustard which gave it a nice mild flavor.
Next time I will use the Spicy Brown
mustard for that extra kick. Thanks for Sharing.

We loved this recipe!!! We are big fish eaters and this was a nice change. I used Grey Poupon Harvest course mustard. I doubled the paste and it was just enough. Mustard works well with fish. Definitely a keeper. Served with garlic wine broccoli.

I would recommend using honey dijon instead of normal dijon- aside from that bite, my family thought it was nice. The recipe is pretty easy- just make sure you increase it appropriately as necessary.

I made this exactly as directed (used country dijon mustard), but doubled the paste.  I thought it was very good and loved the simplicity of this recipe.  I will very likely make this again.  It is a good, fast, affordable fish dish!

This was a super easy and super tasting fish recipe. I made it for a friend who is a chef and he was impressed. And my boyfriend, who HATES mustard, loved it.

C'est fantastique! I used a pretty "harsh" brown mustard. The combination with the parm cheese was awesome. For a side dish, I made rice with black olives, tomatoes, and white corn. My husband loved it!

I do like it as it adds flavor to an otherwise bland fish. I did spray it with olive oil after putting on the breadcrumbs and that added a few calories but was worth it.

The crust did not look anything like the posted picture and it overpowered tilapia's light flavor.

This recipe needs something-- more salt, more cheese, more mustard, something. Don't know what the oregano contributed.

I made this and it looks and smells Amazing!! I Doubled the recipe plus half . I also added a tablespoon of white cooking wine to the sauce as well. I made 5 Tilapia filets for my family. Nice to try something new instead of eating tilapia baked with sprinkles of seasons all the time.

Very different flavors. I used honey mustard instead due to that's all I had. I had to cook it longer than originally stated. Kids loved the sweetness of the fish.

Tasty healthy dish that's also quick and easy! Next time I'll increase the mustard a little, but that's all - a wonderful dish.  The second time I made this I put the mustard spread and half the bread crumbs on the fish before it went into the oven, and then sprinkled the remaining crumbs at 10 minute mark.

My entire family thought it was "ok". I followed the recipe exactly as written and despite the herb mustard mix we still found it slightly plain. We agreed we would eat this again but wouldn't add it to our list of repeatable favorites.

This one was ok, it didn't have much more to it than the mustard flavor.  It also didn't go very deep into the fish-it's all on the surface.  We'd try it again, but with some modifications- like cut back on the mustard, increase the cheese and crumbs. We used flavored croutons as we find they provide more flavor and crunch.  We also doubled the paste.

I'm not sure why everyone is rating this so highly.  The the "herb paste" is salty and weird.  It doesn't spread well, making unappealing clumps on the fish.  This is not a recipe that is salvageable in my opinion and not something we will make again.

This had a very strong flavor, a little overpowering at times. The mustard gave it quite a kick which I like a lot, but my husband decided he likes a more buttery sauce for fish. I would make it for myself but most likely will not for our dinners together.

This wasn't very good. I was expecting more of a crust, based on the picture, as well as the description of the crisp and bubbling topping -- which I just didn't get, despite broiling it a little at the end. Disappointing.

Loved it.  I took some tips from other reviewers. I used Dijon mustard. I had more fish so I doubled the recipe and added 3 TBS. of butter plus 1/4 tsp of dried basil. I also added even more of the cheese, but I won't next time. I used about 1/3 cup fresh bread crumbs and broiled the fish the last couple of minutes. I will try it next time without the butter because the mustard and herbs are what really give this recipe its zing.

Delicious! Takes away the "fishy" taste.
