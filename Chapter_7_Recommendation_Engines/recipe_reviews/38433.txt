Im sorry to say this but this is the first negative review I have ever posted.... Just add some pickles and peanutbutter to this, and maybe it will get better... or maybe not.

I couldn't find instant white chocolate flavored coffee mix powder so I used white chocolate finely grated. I wasn't quite sure what to think and I still wasn't sure after I tasted it. The more I thought about it the more I liked the eggs. The white chocolate adds another dimension without being overly sweet. Next time I will add shredded cheese as recommended.

This recipe is an explosion of flavor. My tastebuds were thoroughly pleased by this chocolate ice cream. The cool and smooth texture combined with the strong chocolate flavor made it truly amazing. My only complaint is the high sugar. My husband died of a heart attack after consuming this recipe.
