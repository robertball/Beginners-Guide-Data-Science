You can assemble this whole thing the day before and just pop it in the oven the day of the event. Everything blends together nicely overnight. I worried that the veggies would be soggy - they weren't.  Key is to saute the veggies but make sure you place them on paper towels and blot them to absorb excess moisture before mixing them in.  Cook ingredients the day before, assemble and refrigerate. The day of, you will heat around 350 for 50 minutes approx.

Lots of veggies:  chopped peppers, zucchini, onion, mushrooms, diced/drained tomatoes; cooked a ham steak and chopped it in (plenty of meat)...bacon would be yummy too.  Everything else as recipe states.  The cream cheese base and half and half makes this very special. 

Great!

I've made this recipe about 20 times now & it is great. I made this as written the first time and that's what I base the 5 stars from. After that, I had to change it to make it easier because now I make it every Sunday for my weekday breakfasts. I use red pepper instead of green because it has more nutrients & I don't like cooked green pepper. I also omit the cream cheese & just add another egg & a little more half n half because it eliminates having to use a mixer (a fork works just fine) and cuts down on fat. I've used canadian bacon and turkey ham instead of ham and both are good. I've also roasted the veggies at about 400* for 15-20 min instead of sauteeing & that is good too. My favorite thing to add is a giant handful of fresh chopped basil. Hope this helps someone =)

5++++.  This was fantastic!!  Made for Mother's Day brunch and everyone loved it.  Most people had seconds and I was asked several times how I made it.  I made it vegetarian and used tons of veggies-onion, garlic, mushrooms, red bells, yellow bells, asparagus and zucchini.  I used baguette for the bread.  At first when I added the eggs to the cream cheese mixture, it didn't look so good (kind of looked curdled) but I kept beating and it smoothed out.  I will make this again and again-a nicer egg casserole and so adaptable as far as ingredients go.  Thank you for a new favorite recipe-this is seriously one of the best things I have made in good while!

This is an excellent dish for breakfast or brunch!  I made it for brunch yesterday and everyone, including my kids, devoured it!  I didn't have enough zucchini (I used about 1/2 as much as called for and cut out the seeds so it wouldn't get too watery) and I used turkey bacon instead of ham.  My husband can't wait for me to make it again, and neither can I!  Thanks, Arlene, for a great recipe!

I made this for a brunch for 12 people and everyone loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly, but prefer doing things ahead of time.  I'd suggest cooking the vegetables and ham according to the recipe the night before, as well as preparing the bread cubes.  This would make it a lot faster to prepare for a breakfast, or brunch.

I made this for a dinner with friends and everyone loved it!  I added some extra spices (worcestershire sauce, cayenne pepper, Italian seasoning) and used whole wheat bread.  Tastes like a crustless quiche except better:)

i made this for my mom's birthday brunch.  everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  i usually dont do this, but i did add spinach.  i am planning to assemble this ahead of time in a disposable foil pan and take it camping.  you leave it in the hot coals and cover it with some more for an hour and a half.  come back from a hike and breakfast is done.  i do this with a similar (but not as good) strata..

Had to make something kind of fancy for a women's retreat and they loved this.  I didn't change anything for the women.  Made it again for the family without the mushrooms and it was even better.  Even my teenaged sons liked it.

Great recipe, yummy....
Made this for a Brunch I held for Fathers Day. It went over a treat, even with the grand kiddies. Young and old loved it. 
I would recommend cutting up all the cubed items the night before if doing a brunch. Thanks for posting this recipe.
Will definitely be making it again and again and again....

i made this for easter brunch and it was absolutely delicious!  everyone raved about it and most people had 2-3 pieces.  i combined this recipe with another one i found by doing the following: browned 1 lb. sausage, added veggies and sauteed until tender, poured the whole mixture into a colander set over a bowl to drain.    instead of cubing the bread i used sliced bread i had left out overnight so it was nice and dry.  i layered the strata by putting half the sliced bread on the bottom of the baking dish, topping it with half the sausage-veggie mixture, then pouring half the egg mixture over the top, followed by another 3 layers of the same.  most importantly, i put plastic wrap over the top and weighed the whole thing down with another baking dish and let it sit in the fridge overnight.  this is essential to achieve the perfect final texture!  before baking, i let it sit on the counter for 30 mins, topped with more shredded cheddar AND shredded hash browns and baked it according to the recipe.  i put it under the broiler for ~3-5 mins to get the top nice and golden and let it sit for 15 mins before cutting it into squares.  everyone LOVED the crispy hash browns on top!  it was one of the most delicious egg-based breakfast items i've ever made/eaten!

Used Neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese & omitted the mushrooms (because of my kids).  Very good!!  May want to saute veggies in butter or olive oil instead of vegetable oil next time.

I replace the crm cheese w/ Part skim ricotta (much lower fat, higher protein, higher calcium) and I like it even better!   Such a great recipe, everyone always loves it, and so easy!

I am kind of a snob when it comes to recipes and I spent forever reading different recipes for a "brunch type" casserole. This recipe interested me because of the cream cheese. I decided to try it and WOW it was so great. I received so many compliments and it was really great the next day too. I added spinach and green onions and used red peppers instead of green and also used italian bread. I also layered it, starting with bread then the meat/veggies then cheese then bread again, etc and finally I poured the egg mixture over the whole thing and pushed it down with my hands, covered with foil and refrigerated overnight. I baked it for about 50 mins and it was so pretty and very good.

This is the best and you can change the ingredients and make it a dinner type casserole.  I like to put roasted chicken pieces and diced green chiles in it for dinner!

This was outstanding!  And, like Arlene said, next time I'll have the recipe printed out for guests, as everyone wanted it.  I made it for a brunch baby shower, and even people who never go back for seconds went for seconds... and thirds!!!

Per some other people's advice, I added approximately 1T dried mustard and 1T worsteshire (sp???) sauce.  Didn't measure (never do), just did.

Some other modifications I made due to allergies/preferences:
I used fat free half & half and cream cheese (regular cheddar and eggs though!!)
I omitted mushrooms altogether because I hate them, but can see how if you liked them it would be excellent
I didn't use ham, I used morningstar breakfast patties (12) - basically vegetarian sausage patties - and no one could tell.  
I used a bag mix of peppers & onions - almost always do - and it came out great, as well as freeze-dried garlic.  Olive oil instead of vegetable oil.
The zucchini is a MUST, and I will probably use more next time as well as maybe carrots and other veggies
I accidentally goofed up and added the eggs to the half & half before reading the order, and while I had to beat it longer, it seems like it still came out okay (and I thought tiny little chunks of cream cheese would actually be yummy).
Instead of day old bread (that I didn't have), I called Panera and they donate their bread at the end of the night, so they gave me 3 baguette loaves at the end of the night for free (used 1.5).  I microwaved them to "age" them & just cut crus

Made for a group of 20!  Everyone loved it and at least 5 people want the recipe!  Made it 24 hours ahead ... worked perfect but required an extra 5 minutes since the ingredients were cold.  Yummy!

I took a risk and made this for the first time when my in-laws all came over and it was fantastic! I had never made a strata before so I didn't know what to expect but it was full of flavor. It was time consuming to prepare which I did the night before. I used a 9x13 and 8x8 pan. I drained the veggies well and did pat dry, I had no problem with it being soggy. I used a whole French bread, half cheddar cheese and half pepper jack, and added red pepper as well as green. I also made a second one but changed it up for the kids...no veggies and I used sausage instead of ham. The younger men and kids loved it. I made is for 12 servings and baked it in two 8x8 pans. Both were a hit. Perfect recipe!

Super yummy! I made this for brunch at our MOPS group and saved the other pan for our family.  Needless to say, EVERY bit was eaten by both parties!!  Delicious!    I followed some of the other commenters and assembled everything the night before and baked the next morning, and it turned out perfectly.  I used bacon instead of ham, but want to try it with ham once and sausage the next.  It would probably be good with all three!  I will definitely be making this again and again.

So good!  (And I ran the calories, less than 350 a serving!)  It's a very versatile recipe, too.  I've made it as instructed (except for the mushrooms - yuck) and I've played with the ingredients and it always turns out amazing.  This last time, I added a cup of diced acorn squash, plain Greek yogurt in the place of half and half and Mexican blend of shredded cheese in the place of cheddar.  It was excellent!  I look forward to trying it with breakfast sausage in the place of ham in the future.  Ooh, and a gyro themed strata, too.  ...such an exciting recipe!!

Couldn't be more delicious! Made exactly as written and wouldn't recommend a single change! I am going to try a lower fat version in the future to see how that will work.  Will make again and again!

My husband made this for me this morning for Mother's Day.  Dee-licious!  The only change he made was to use red peppers instead of green.  Even my uber picky children ate it.  Happy Mother's Day to me! :)

I served this Strata for a small family brunch.  I halved the recipe, omitted the zuchini and green peppers and used extra fresh muchrooms.  Even though my brother and sister in law got into a giant screaming match, the Strata was a HIT!!!  Also delicious as leftovers!

Served this on Father's Day for Brunch.  BIG HIT!!  Already had 3 requests for the recipe.  Although it may not have been healthy, I added crumbled pieces of thick sliced bacon to the top and they all loved it.

Made twice in a week for different events and it was universally liked by all, with many "can I have the recipe".  Homerun.  Feel free to experiment with other ingredients or amounts of them, this recipe is forgiving of changes made to it.

This is delicious.  I made this for 375 women this weekend for our Christmas Tea.  I've heard nothing but rave reviews and have had so many requests for the recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, except I omitted the green pepper.  And I sprinkled some extra cheese on the top. I cubed the bread and let it sit out, loosely covered for 2 days to harden a bit. I mixed the bread into two of the pans the night before and it seemed to soak up most of the moisture.  I was afraid they would be too dry so I waited and mixed the other 14 pans the morning of and let them sit for a half hour before baking.  I found they all turned out the same.  The ones I mixed the night before had plumped up and released some of the moisture during the night and were not dry at all.  So, I will definitely mix everything the night before next time I make this.

This was very good but the cook time is not near long enough.  I ended up baking for 1 hour in order to get the middle to set.

Ridiculous how this good this is!  Now, one of my favorite recipes.  The only thing I changed was to add bacon, but otherwise made exactly according to recipe.  Can be made the night before and baked in morning.  Love this!

Very flavorful, very good.  Skipped the mushrooms for personal preference and used half light-cream cheese.  Not overly cheesy taking, surprisingly.  I also used whole grain bread from Costco.  Maybe tasted heavier, but I'm not sure and it certainly was good!

A HUGE hit!  I sliced up tomatoes on the top too, with a little extra cheese. I made everything two days before, and added the bread the morning I cooked it.   I had to cook it a little longer since it was cold from the fridge.

I was dissapointed I didn't have leftovers!

WOW!!! This was a huge hit, I made it just as recipe suggested. There was not much left and I would certainly make it again. I thought with all the eggs it may taste real eggy, but it did not. LOVED IT!!

This recipe is a winner with everyone - it's great as written, but you can easily adjust the veggies to suit the taste of your guests.  This has become my go to dish to make for friends who have recently had babies - I'm told that it freezes well, you just thaw/heat a piece in the microwave and it makes for a great snack during those 3 am feedings.

Five stars isn't enough. I'm not a big breakfast casserole fan, but I made this for Easter and couldn't believe how delicious it was. We skipped the mushrooms and it was fine without them. Perfect!

Giving this 5 stars because everyone really enjoyed this, and it was pretty easy to make.  I personally found the recipe a little bland?? perhaps, but I'll make it again for sure with my own additions.

This was delicious! I made it with reduced fat cream cheese and cheddar, and fat free 1/2 and 1/2, and you couldn't even tell. The only thing I did differently from the recipe was to sub broccoli for the zucchini. I also threw in a leek I had left over from another recipe. Fantastic!!! Next time, I think I'll try a spinach and feta version.

I prepared this dish the night before, but did not assemble it until the morning. This turned out really good! I used turkey bacon instead of ham, and next time I will add fresh spinach and maybe some tomato. Overall very good!

I made the 8x8" version of this with the 5 serving calculation.  I used 4 eggs and all else the same.  It was done at 37 mins.  Definitely plan on letting it cool for 10 mins before serving.  It will take you at least 45 mins of chopping, it's excellent & unique.

My stepson absolutely loves this breakfast - he even likes it cold and he is a particular eater!  We make this a lot, I leave the bread cubes out as I don't want the carbs.  I have used bacon instead of ham but prefer the ham.  I also frequently switch out the vegetables depending on what is in the fridge.  Peppers, tomatoes, mushrooms, onion, broccoli, etc.  Awesome, thanks!

Everyone LOVED this Strata! I prepared everything the day before (chopped up and sauteed all of the veggies, mixed wet ingredients, chopped up the bread) and the next morning mixed it all together. Huge hit!

Go no further. This is the TOP strata recipe in the world. You will have no leftovers. I used my small KitchenAid to chop the vegetables. Released the water after sauteeing by gentley squeezing vegertables through cheese cloth. Made one 11X14. Took it to a Christmas brunch. Incredible. Worth the effort.

We loved this! I used low fat cream cheese and low fat sharp cheddar. I did not use any oil, but just a light spray with Pam. I also omitted the meat. I put sliced tomatoes on top and used a garlic cibatta bread. I used a 9x13 and an 8x8 and it was perfect. It was so so good and filing. Will make again and again! I wonder if I can freeze?

I loved this recipe.  I used bacon and sausage in place of ham and it was fabulous.  I also used one loaf of french bread and pulled it apart into bite size pieces.  I mixed my cheeses to include sharp chedder, jack, and regular chedder.  I saved some parmesan for the top. I like another reviewer suggested did the majority of the preparation the night before including cooking my meat and sauteing my vegetables and then combined it with the liquid mixture and bread in the morning and baked as directed.   This will be a Holiday favorite from now on!

While this is far from a healthy dish I couldn't help but try it for a friends baby shower. No one was disappointed! It tasted great and there wasn't anything left over.

Great versatile recipe! Made this for a potluck brunch and it was a hit. Prepped everything the night before, cooked the veggies the night before (thanks to one of the reviewers recommendations blotted the moisture with paper towels) and placed in a baggie for the morning. My husband has a reaction to onions, I substituted with celery, used yellow, orange and red bell pepper instead of green. Used a bagette for the bread and fat free half & half and lowfat cream cheese.  Left out the ham but this is so versatile you could use sausage, bacon or any meat you prefer. I am already planning to use this recipe again for Mother's Day.

Let me start off by saying that I made some substitutions:  chopped, fresh spinach for zucchini; orange bell pepper for green; canned mushrooms for fresh (forgot to buy fresh).  I also halved the recipe (except the cheddar, which I only cut by a third). I mixed cheeses and wet ingredients in food processor, as well as my fresh baked bread (forgot to 'age' it) to kind of expedite mixing time; I used a vidalia chop wizard to cut down on chop time... and I still had 45 minutes in the prep, so I think 45 min. prep is for someone REALLY fast or it's off a bit. And I baked it every minute of the recommended bake time, was a little skittish that the toothpick came out clean but there seemed to still be wet egg mixture, so I baked an extra 10 minutes for safety reasons as much as anything.  All that said, this strata is really, really good.  It's not jump up and down, have it every weekend great, but it is really good for an occasion(al) brunch.  I also think it's too much trouble for an every weekend or every day breakfast/brunch.  I would

Made this, with just a few substitutions based on personal preference.  Fantastic!  The best thing about this recipe is the potential for experimentation.  Looking forward to trying it out with a variety of different veggies, cheeses and breads.

I don't have an 11x7 pan (much less 2!) so I halved the recipe and used a casserole dish and increased the cook time to about 1 hour 10 minutes.  Not recommended, but you work with what you've got.  Even with increasing the cook time, it did not burn and smelled wonderful the whole time.

Prepared this completely in the casserole the night before and cooked it the next morning.  It wasn't soggy and it stayed mixed up.

This has become a favorite.  I can't wait to have an occasion to share it!

This is a wonderful recipe!  I made it without the ham, and substituted half of the eggs for egg beaters.  It was the first to go at the luncheon!

FANTASTIC.  Period.  Okay, not period...this is so simple to make and is perfect for leftovers.  Take all those bread heels or slices of french bread that went hard over the week, take your leftover cheese, your leftover meats, your leftover veggies and with hardly any effort or time you have a wonderful, hearty, filling, and delicious brunch dish.  It's nothing like those horrid "egg casseroles" people make...this has real flavor and depth.  You can confidently substitute any cheeses, veggies, and milks...cottage cheese, feta, buttermilk, skim milk, any sort of veg.  This comes out great every time and you can freeze individual squares for a quick and tasty meal any time.  It's even good cold the next day.  I especially love that I can throw it together and cook it hours (and even days) later.  Perfect leftover recipe!

I made this on Christmas Eve and put it in the oven on Christmas morning while we opened gifts.  This makes two pans full, so great for holidays with company.  I loved it, but my grandson didn't like quite so many veggies.  I might consider making a pan without the zucchini next time.

SIMPLY THE BEST!!!!!
I made this recipe for Christmas morning and it was BEYOND fabulous.  My family isn't big on zucchini so I cut it down to 1 cup instead of three, and added some baby asparagus.  It was gobbled down and I was "informed" that it's now part of the Christmas breakfast tradition.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  **It's really helpful to use the brownie size pan.  I had a difficult time finding them so I had to order from Amazon.  Without that size pan, the strata would be way too thin for our tastes.  Buying two pans is well worth the expense because the recipe is really that good.

Made this for a semi-business related brunch and got rave reviews.  Very tasty, and easy, as a lot pf the prep can be done in advance.  Makes a lot (2 large casseroles) but good as leftovers as well

Very good recipe! I followed the recipe exactly - made it the night before and popped it into the oven the next day. I thought it came out really nice but thought the cheese flavor was a little overwhelming. Next time I'll probably use a little less cheese - other than that I wouldn't change a thing!

Seems like this has so many 5 star reviews b/c reviewers changed the recipe. I halved the recipe since there's only 2 of us (put in a 9x13 pan), & substituted thawed frozen, chopped spinach that I sauteed with the rest of the veggies, ONLY b/c I don't eat mushrooms. The rest of the recipe I left the same. I assembled the night before & cooked in the morning. This was somewhat bland. Next time around I would leave out the spinach & double the amount of ham, add more cheese & extra seasonings. This recipe does have potential. It's just so irritating to see all the good reviews but the reviewers dramatically changed the recipe.

I made this in two 8x8 glass baking dishes. Cooking time increased by about 15 minutes. Also added as topping: 1/2 grape tomatoes, sliced in half, lengthwise, face up, on top. Added 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese on top of strata during last 15 min. of cooking.

I have made this recipe twice now and it never disappoints.  It makes a lot of food, so I freeze it in 8 X 8 portions.  I bring it out of the freezer when I need it and wow everyone's taste buds!  Last time I made it I replaced the zucchini with blanched kale and the ham with turkey bacon.  I think the options are endless!  Have fun with this recipe and enjoy!

Delicious! Made it with Christy for brunch over New Year's!  Can use regular milk instead of half and half.  Try using a french bread or challah bread next time and see how that turns out?

This dish was awesome for brunch on new year's day!  Everyone loved it!  I assembled it the afternoon of new year's eve so I could just pop it in the oven in the morning.  I left out the meat and half and half and used milk instead.  Next time I will add chopped red pepper and 1 t. of nutmeg or cayenne pepper.

This was awesome. I cubed the bread and grilled the veggies the night before and it was super-easy to just mix it all up and pour it into the pan in the morning. My only mistake was that we had 7 adults so I halved the recipe, and it was gone in a flash. Don't be afraid to make the whole recipe! It went perfectly with some roasted potatoes and fresh fruit. I'll definitely be making this one again.

My two young fussy boys did not like this (other than picking the ham out) My husband and I both thought it was pretty good....he added hot sauce to his cause we both agreed that it needed a little more zip. I would try it again but I would try to find a way to flavor it up a little more

Delicious! Made the night before and so glad I did! Doubled the recipe and served 34 people for a family reunion brunch. Added yellow squash, and substituted red bell pepper for the green and bulk sausage for the ham.  I will definitely make again!!

Served this dish to the in-laws on mother's day and everyone raved about it even my picky hubby.  I omitted the ham just because I know breakfast meat will be served.  It still came out so delicious, we hardly miss the meat.  This is my go to recipe for now on every time I have to go to a pot luck or brunch.

This was pretty good and filling.  I don't eat mushrooms, so I doubled up on the zucchini.  I would definitely cook this again.

Yum! I make this whenever we have overnight guests. I omit the mushrooms and reduce the zucchini, and only use a small amount of oil. I use Panera's asiago cheese bread. I always get compliments!

Nice change from the typical breakfast casserole.  Lots of chopping and prepping but worth it. Very tasty! Took other reviewers advice and assembled the night before and put in the fridge. Then this morning cooked it at 350 for about 50-55 minutes. I used a 15x10 pan for the brunch I was going to and had enough to also fill a pie plate to make later. I also used only 1/4 cup oil not 1/3. Remember to drain your veggies before adding to the mixture.

Wow! This was AMAZING!  I forgot the 1/2&1/2, but it still came out really good.  The vegetable prep is what takes time and you can always do that the day before.  I also cut the recipe in 1/2 and added canned mild green chilies.  I would definately make this again.  I would serve it with fruit or a light salad.  I can't wait to make if for friends.

Yum, Yum, Yum!  I wanted to make something special for breakfast Christmas morning and decided on this recipe and am I glad I did.  Everyone loved it, even my husband who was worried it was going to be like bread pudding, which he hates.  So good, don’t change anything.  Thanks much!

This turned out great and all enjoyed it.  I cut the recipe in half and used diced smoked breakfast links in place of the ham.  Could easily leave out the meat for a vegetarian casserole.  Based on another review I assembled all the night before and just let sit out while the oven preheated and popped it in for about 40 min.  Thanks!

This is an excellent, rich dish to make on occasion. I made a few changes- reduced the cream cheese by half and used chopped frozen spinach in place of the other green veggies. It was a huge hit with my husband and three-year-old (both picky eaters) but my one year old wouldn't touch it (though he usually loves eggs!).

Will definitely make again.

Terrific recipe! I used left over pork chop and sausage. I also did not measure the vegetables, just made sure I had enough cream cheese/egg mixture to cover the "wad" of veggies and meat. I imagine you could substitute anything for the vegetable mixture and make some great combos. Save on dishes and plop the mixture in the pan you sauted the vegetables in, then bake. (Provided you have quality pans, mine is Calphalon.)

Had to alter this recipe due to ingredients I had on hand.  But basic recipe is excellent.  I used spinach, mushrooms, sweet onion, red pepper that I sauteed first then added Ricotta cheese.  Mixed eggs and skim milk with salt and pepper, then added the vegetable cheese mix.  Also used a shredded mexican blend of cheese, and cut up day old cibbatta bread which was a nice flavor addition. I did not use any kind of meat in this.  Served at an Easter Brunch where it got Rave reviews!!!

Wouldn't make any changes.  I make it for school breakfast functions and it's a hit.  I use a 1-1 1/2 in pan.  Still rises and it doesn't take as long.  Also, goes farther.  Personally, for the sake of saving carbs I don't add the bread and it doesn't change a thing.

This is not a strata as there are no layers.  It tastes good though.  I would leave out the ham and use more mushrooms next time.

Yummy, yummy, yummy. I prepped this on Christmas eve and it made our Christmas morning a delight. Based on other reviews (and my own tastes) I nixed the cream cheese and added some more egg. I also just used the non-fat milk we had at home instead of half and half. For bread, I got a whole wheat sourdough. This is a great basic recipe, I will be using it for quite some time.

I didn't want to spend all Christmas morning slaving in the kitchen, so I looked for something I could make the night before and pop in the oven while we opened presents.   I found this recipe and I think I have found a family tradition.  Even my sons veggie hating girlfriend went back for seconds!  It is delicious!  There is a lot of prep, but soo worth it.   Don't change a thing.  Its perfect!!

This egg strata (casserole) is excellent for a large group brunch or in the fridge for leftovers for the week.

This is a very flavorful recipe that doesn't need to much adjusting if any -- perhaps the cheese option could be changed, i used mozzarella --

This would be great without the ham, too, for vegetarians or non-pork eaters. We opted for red peppers instead of green and used yellow onions. Due to allergies we omitted the garlic and added some pepper. Tasty and a big hit at brunch! I would also bump up the prep time a bit.

Love this recipe and so did my family. I added frozen spinach and used french bread instead of white bread and added more cheese. This is a keeper.

Overall this recipe is very easy to assemble.  Next time I will substitute whole milk or half and half instead of the cream cheese. I suggest substituting spinach or fresh asparagus instead of zucchini.

We did halve this recipe and made in one glass baking dish. Instead of the 8 oz of cream cheese we used 3 oz of goats milk cheese (chevre) and loved the flavor. Next time we will increase the amount of goats cheese and decrease the amount of cheddar shredded cheese. In addition we used spicy sausage instead of the ham. For flavor we increased the garlic to 3 cloves and added 3 TBS of fresh parsley. Used day old french bread. It was beautiful for presentation and smelled great! I would definetely make this for company but next time we will increase the amount of parsley and use more goats cheese to bring out more flavor.

I added extra spices to kick up the flavor. Also I used roasted red peppers instead of green peppers, since I don't like the bitter taste of green bell peppers. For variety, I used 1 cup sweet onion and 1/2 spring onion with green tops. Also I switched the cream cheese reduced fat and it was stil very delicious.

This is a great, easy recipe that is good for feeding a group of people and is pretty low maintenance.  It's a lot of chopping in the beginning, but after it goes in the oven, it was the perfect time to make potatoes I served with it.  (I cut up sweet and red potatoes I had in the fridge and fried it with some onions and green peppers- it was a great side)  It fed 5 people on half the recipe.    I used kielbasa since I didnt have any ham, cut the bread into cubes an hr before to let it harden, added some baby spinach I had in the fridge, and used whole milk & reduced fat cream cheese.  People loved it.    It was a lot of chopping, but its worth it.  You can get away with cutting bigger pieces, so it's not that bad.  Definitely a keeper.

Made for a brunch.   Most people had never tried before and they loved it!   I would definitely make again.  I followed the recipe exactly, but made the night before... so it was cold when cooking.   My 11x7 pan cooked in about 45 minutes.    A slightly smaller and deeper pan took about 1 hour 10 minutes.

I made this the night before and refrigerated it as some others had suggested, but it took almost an hour to bake in the morning and the bread chunks were actually a little soggy for my taste. My boyfriend loved it though. I did add some tomatoes and sausage as well which added a lot of flavor. I will definitely make this again but next time I would make it that day rather than refrigerating it, I think letting it sit was what made the bread more soggy.

This recipe is just so delicious I can't say anything more. The last time I made it I put in cooked ground sausage, sauteed mushrooms, thinly sliced shallots and a ton of cheddar cheese! The crunchiness of the top layer of exposed baked bread is to die for!

Absolutely WONDERFUL!!  I've printed copies for my coworkers.  I normally don't change recipes the first time I make them but when I went to make it and found out that I forgot the ham, I substituted Boar's Head Bacon - 1 pound.  Cut into small pieces and cooked till crisp.  Instead of the veggie oil, I used bacon drippings.  I had another recipe planned this week that uses Heavy Whipping Cream so I substituted that for the Half & Half to keep from buying both.  Everyone LOVED IT!!  Will definately make again!

Made this for a brunch last weekend.  Followed the recipe with minor changes (red instead of green pepper; baguette; omitted ham since having a meat dish).  I made and assembled the entire dish the evening before.  It was great!  Already passed on the recipe.

Great ... but i made some changes.  Skim milk instead of half & half, and part-skim mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar.  I also used only 3 egg yolks and 4 egg whites.  It turned out great!!!!

This was the best "egg bake" I have ever had.  I made it for the guys at the firehouse and they loved it.  I didn't make it past breakfast.  It rocked I think that it will be my Christmas breakfast from now on.

Fabulous. I used fresh baguette, added some sun dried tomatoes, used 2 packages of breakfast links instead of ham, dried onion flakes (because I forgot the onion), shredded zuc, and used 1/3 less fat cream cheese, which worked fine. I also used fat free cheddar cheese for about 1/3 of the cheese. I usually don't like egg casseroles which are too "eggy"--this one is not. Great flavors.

Great Recipe.  I made it for a Mother's day brunch and it was well liked.  My brother had four servings and asked to take home all the leftovers.  I prepared it the night before and followed the recipe exactly accept that I don't have any 11 x 7 pans so put it into two 9 X 13 pans.  I took the pans out of the refrigerator 30 minutes prior to baking and baked for 50 minutes.  Next time I will watch the baking time closer because I think it was a little over cooked.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will be making it again.

Thanks for the great recipe! you were right - everyone asked for the recipe!! I made it for a brunch baby shower. Only changes I made were that I only used 1 tbsp of oil for sauteeing the veggies, used red pepper instead of green, used old/sharp cheddar, more black pepper and I halved the recipe to make just one casserole dish. Excellent!

Excellent!  I made this for Christmas morning and it was a big hit. Nice change from the typical sausage/cheese I usually make.  I made it with broccoli instead of zucchini.

I used this as a general guide, added my own combo of veggies and cheeses, reduced the bread component (and used crumbs instead) and it came out great. Will make this my main "brunch for a crowd" recipe!

This was the best.  I added an extra cup of cheese, as we love cheese and it is to die for.  My boyfriend took this dish to work for his staff and they all loved it.  Was easy to make and a WINNER with everyone.

Loved this recipe.  But I had to adjust it to make 2 11x9x2 pans of it.  Added six more eggs and 1/4 cup more half and half and it worked great.  Substituted 1 lb of fresh spinach (sauteed) for the ham; and substituted roasted red pepper for the green pepper.  Delicious and big hit with my brunch group!

One suggestion. I find it annoying when you try to mix all ingredients together and pour into pans. The ingredients separate by weight and you get "uneven" servings.  

I "compose" my strata.  I layered the bread cubes in the bottom of the pan. Then layer the sauteed veggies evenly over the bread cubes. Then pour the egg mixture slowly over the top. Then spread the cheddar on top of that, pressing down to make sure the cheese gets wet.  Perfection in servings.. every serving has same amount of bread/veggies. Works beautifully!

Awesome!!! I made this recipe for the very first time the morning of my brunch  and it was perfect.
The original recipe called for 16 servings and I had changed it to 12 because I had 10 guest at my brunch.  I thought for sure it would not turn out.
This recipe is a keeper and I have already emailed to one of my guest and my sister.

Wow! This is sooo good! Even my very picky Italian mother-in-law loved it. The only thing I did differently was that I added some water to the oil when I cooked the mixture, so that the vegetables would soften more easily. And then I simmered it until all the water had evaporated. Also, I halved the recipe and baked it in just one medium-sized casserole dish, since I only had 3 people to serve. I will most DEFINITELY be making this again... and again... and again. ;)

LOVE this! Made it exactly as it said. My question is - can I freeze one pan and bake it later? Has anyone tried that? I would love to have this in the freezer for a quick delicious meal whenever someone stops in. Thxs.

Definitely a must have for brunch!!  This strata was a hit at my brunch and people went back for seconds.  I didn't make any changes to this recipe and it was excellent!!   Easier to put together than expected and much easier in the morning when you just pop in the oven to bake.  HIGHLY recommend if you're looking to impress guests!!

I halved this recipe to feed 6 and it wasn't enough. It may be my own fault for not beating the eggs long enough to make it fluffier and I did refrigerate it for 6 hours prior to baking.  It was so delicious that we all wanted more tho!  Even my picky 14 year old son loved it!

Great! My kids loved it and ate it, I used whole milk instead of half/half and Light cream cheese, it was rich and delicious, Made 2 big batches, time consuming chopping, but worth it.

This was great! A hearty, filling, yummy breakfast that is also very pretty. I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted 3 small tomatoes for the mushrooms- this suited my taste better and added nice color. I also just used just one, slightly larger pan and baked for about an hour. My only complaint is that it took FOREVER to prepare, so next time I will prepare and assemble the night before and then just pop in the oven in the morning. I will definitely make this one again and again!

Wow! Super tasty father's day brunch main course! Didn't really measure, but used one package of mushroom, one red and one green bell pepper, three small zucchini and turkey ham with 11 eggs and 1 cup cream. Also mixed cheddar with 1/2 cup leftover queso fresco. Next time, adding some green chilies. Bread was chunks of leftover artisan bread, and one package of 1/3 fat cream cheese. This was SO GOOD. Used one big 11 inch glass pan and cooked it for 1 hour. Boys loved it, kiddo ate it without noticing or picking at the veggies. Oh- I made this at night, covered it with plastic wrap and baked it in the am. The eggs, cream, cream cheese mix doesn't look good at first, but keep mixing until you get to smooth creamy texture. Thanks~!

Big hit on Mother's Day!  Subbed asparagus for broccoli, used light cream cheese, and pitched the yolks for a few eggs -- to try to lighten things up.  Still delish!

I made the strata for Easter Brunch.  I had so many other dishes that I cut the recipe down to 12 servings and made it in a 9x13 baking dish.  I was excellent, looked beautiful, and was enjoyed by all.  It could easily be served for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  I know I'll be making it again soon!

I made this recipe with a bit of tweaking for an agent brunch, I had multiple people ask for the recipe and also ask if they could have left-overs.  I did not add the onions or peppers as I thought the other vegi's were sufficient.  I cooked the vegi's in a bit of butter with garlic.  I cooked very small cubed ham in a saucepan with garlic and butter seperatly too. I put the entire recipe into a 11x17 pan - much easier.  Will make this again very soon!

Excellent!  I scaled the recipe  to 12 and put it in a 9 X 13 baking pan; it required about 1 hour of cooking (I checked it at 35 minutes, 45, 50 etc).  It came out perfect! Very delicious recipe.  Next time I will add red pepper just to give it a little colour.  Thanks!

I used bacon instead of ham because that's what I had. I made this for an after-Christmas brunch and it was great. I warmed up some leftovers the next morning and it was still great. I added in some squash and red peppers.

Fixed this for a brunch today and it got rave reviews from everyone.I fixed it exactly as called for except I cut the recipe in half as there were only 4 of us for brunch.  I also used red and yellow peppers for color.  This is definitely a "keeper".  Thanks so much for sharing!

I made this for a group of people and they loved it. I think what impressed them most was the zucchini for breakfast so they felt good about eating so many veggies. The flavor was very comforting and hearty but it didn't feel like you were consumming a brick for breakfast which I often run into with heavy sausage breakfast cassaroles. Nothing wrong with sausage unless you need to be functional for the rest of the day. Thanks for the recipe. I'll do this one again fo sho.

This is a really good base recipe. I usually change a few things up...I use spinach, onions, bacon, and mushrooms...it is always a big hit!

This was really delicious.  I made the strata exactly as written except I halved the recipe and served it at a brunch themed dinner party and several people asked for the recipe.  I thought the bread pieces had a bit of a strange appearance though the flavor was good.  I think next time I may just cut it into very small pieces but I will definitely make this again.

Absolutely delicious - I cut the recipe in half but did everything exactly by the recipe and it was awesome!  Everyone loved it. As some others suggested, I prepared it the night before and kept it in the fridge.  Then, the next day, I cooked it.  It came out perfect.

I put this together for father's day brunch and it was a huge success.  The only thing I added was red pepper chunks and broccoli.  Everyone took seconds and wanted thirds, except we ran out :).  Highly recommended.

made this for a girls lunchen.  It was wonderful.  I did add  asparagus that I blanched for 3 min. and than mixed in prior to cooking. I made it the day before, pulled it out of the refrigerator and cooked just prior to eating. which worked out great.

This recipe was spectacular!! I cut up the left overs into individual servings and froze in ziplock freezer bags. 10 minutes to reaheat and I think even better when reheated.

Great recipe!  I made this for a Mother's Day brunch for 12 people and had plenty left over (tastes great the next day as well).  I only had one 7x11 pan so for the second dish I just used a pie plate.  I would suggest covering it with aluminum foil a little past halfway of the cooking time to prevent over-browning.  Will definitely make again!

I used a ton of veggies and used broccoli instead of the meat for a hearty vegetarian dish.  People liked it but I don't think they loved it... no one asked for the recipe so I'm not sure I will make it again.  But it was definitely moist and hearty

My husband and I have new baby twin grandkids born (a few weeks ago) over the Christmas holidays and we decided to have a  brunch and invite uncles and aunts who had not yet had the opportunity to meet the new additions to our family. This casserole dish was a big success. I used fresh broccoli instead of zucchini, prepared it all the night before and popped the dishes into the oven 45 minutes before the "guests of honour" arrived. Thank you so much for helping us to have a successful "Meet the new twins Event".

I changed this recipe some but it was a great template and everything came out amazing. I added bacon and sausage and excluded the ham. I also added chopped tomatoes and excluded the mushrooms as a personal preference.

I did cheat somewhat, I used presliced mushrooms and croutons, and I omitted the peppers because I hate them. I drained the zucchini as much as I could so it wouldn't be soupy, otherwise followed the recipe. The cream cheese adds a nice bit of creaminess and a hint of tang.

I made this for Christmas brunch and love the recipe.  Lots of chopping, but that can be done the day before and kept in the refrigerator. The only change I made was to add some asparagus to the recipe since I had some to use up.  My daughter just called and asked for this recipe to take up on a skiing trip this weekend. Thanks Arlene.

I love this recipe and have made it many times with consistent compliments! I like the setting for 10 servings and bake it in a greased stone baker that crisps the edges. I also make it vegetarian and instead of adding ham, at the end I mix in cooked veggie sausage which I've microwaved.  I use a light white multigrain bread , cream cheese that has Greek yogurt mixed in (lower in fat than lite regular cream cheese) and always make sure I use a very sharp cheddar or extra sharp cheddar like Tillamook brand for maximum flavor! I like to use red peppers for color instead of green and use a chopper machine so all the vegetables are perfectly cubed and it speeds up the prep work too! Enjoy:)

I love this recipe and so does everyone who tastes it!  It's easy, versatile and delicious.  Not a huge fan of ham, so I use breakfast sausage, otherwise I stick to the recipe as written.

I brought this strata to a new years eve party a few years ago to serve at breakfast on new years day. I was declared some kind of hero! I use crumbled sausage in lieu of ham and lots of veggies - usually whatever I have in the fridge in addition to what the recipe calls for, not an exact measure. It continues to be a hit every time I whip it up. Thank you!

it was very good.  I was expecting more of a cream cheese flavor and did customize some the ingredients to what my family prefers.  I added bacon and my dad had informed me (the morning I made it) that he was no longer eating pork.  later on, I found that he had a 2nd helping.  Guess that new diet was starting the next day.  :D

This smelled and tasted great, but it took a LONG time to prepare.  I probably won't make it again because its not worth the trouble.

I've made this many times and it is a big hit!  For those who can't eat dairy, it tastes great as well minus the cream cheese, cream and cheese.

I was going out for a bachelorette party and knew I wouldn't want to make breakfast the next day for the ladies that spent the night at my house.  I also knew I would need a hearty breakfast the next day.  This was perfect ,all I had to do was heat the oven and lay around and wait for comfort food. YUM!!!!

Made as written. I prefer to do that with receipes and rate those recipes as they were written without my changes. Very good. I omitted zucchini. I made in two 8 x 8 pans and one had mushrooms and one didn't. Very tasty. The one without mushrooms needed to be baked an additional 15 minutes. I just couldn't get it cooked.

YUMMMM! I had never even heard of a strata before, and I'm not alone. I was looking for something different to make for breakfast besides the same old scrambled eggs and biscuits or pancakes. I found this and it sounded good, mixing some much needed veggies in with breakfast. I tried my hand at it, prepping all the veggies the night before, and OMG it was so good. My hubby went back for seconds, said he wanted thirds but was trying to control himself. I did use sausage instead of ham as I do not like ham. I took the leftovers to work for breakfast the next morning and everyone was telling me it looked so good and smelled delicious. And none of them had ever heard of a strata either, so I got to introduce them. And believe you me, I shared this recipe. This is going to be a go-to breakfast recipe in our house. It would be fabulous for company.

This was a big hit at brunch today! I assembled it last night, refrigerated it overnight, and popped it in the oven before the guests arrived. Only thing I changed was I omitted the peppers because my mother-in-law doesn't like them. Thanks Arlene!

This is a wonderful recipe! I received so many compliments when I made this for a bridal shower. Since I knew my crowd wasn't a huge fan of mushrooms, I left those out and added some yellow squash; yum!

All the other reviews are true! This was a hit with all. I left half vegetarian, and sprinkled bacon on the other half. also, notice how many servings this makes! I only needed one pan.

Fantastic.  Made this for brunch twice to great reviews.  It heated up well for leftovers, too.  There were only leftovers because I served it for a small group and it makes quite a lot.

This is a fabulous recipe. I was asked to make a main dish for a brunch at a mom's group. I had never made one before but it is easy. I cooked the veggies and mixed the cheese mixture the night before, put them in separate containers and then put it all together with the bread in the morning. Turned out great. I did sub Kraft Tex Mex cheese for the cheddar and it gave it a nice flavour. I also used brown bread and red pepper instead of green and it gave it a lovely colour. Would definitely recommend this to anyone and I will make it again. My one year old is enjoying some that I saved for her right now.

Really great recipe! My (German and British) breakfast guests had never heard of a strata before and unfortunately, saw me mixing it all together while still in raw state...the looks on their faces were priceless and they both took "conservative" amounts once it was on the table. But they both came back for seconds and raved about how good it was!!  Used extra peppers, onions and gouda instead of cheddar.  Substituted sausage for the ham and it was wonderful. Also managed to fit it in one 9x13 pan with no problem (?).

Left out the ham and used 7 grain bread, so may have resulted in blandness,but for all the rich ingredients, like the amount of cream cheese, was not impressed.

I brought this to a brunch, and it went over really well.  It also kept well enough to reheat for breakfast the next day (I wouldn't serve it this way for the first serving, though).

I prepared this exactly as written.  I thought it had a good flavor, but it doesn't really taste like eggs.  My husband didn't like it, but it was probably the mushroom flavor.  If you're looking for a dish that tastes like eggs, try something else.

Absolutely awesome - I made this for brunch for 12 people and there was barely any leftover! There are a couple non-pork eaters in the group, and a person with an allergy to garlic, so instead of ham, I used shredded chicken, and instead of garlic, I added some italian seasoning, salt and pepper to the sauteeing vegetables. The whole thing turned out amazingly well and it got rave reviews from everyone. Thanks for a great recipe!

I was really hoping to add this to our breakfast rotation, but my family thought this was just ok, and I had followed the recipe exactly.  I think it was the cream cheese aftertaste that we didn't care for.

Easy recipe.  A weekend favorite while camping.  Recommend cutting the veggies the evening prior to cut down on prep time.

Everyone loved it on Christmas day.  I was hoping to take some home for the next day, but there wasn't a crumb left.  It will definitely become the Christmas brunch tradition.  I love that it is so full of veggies and very moist.  Thanks for the delicious recipe!

I wasn't sure about using cream cheese but everyone loved this dish.  Great for a crowd, we had leftovers and reheated it in the oven and it tasted just as good the next day which was surprising for eggs!!

Wow! This recipe was absolutely fantastic I will definitely make it again and again as my whole family just loved it. The possibilities for filling combinations are endless. I made mine with leftover cottage roll, zucchini, onion and green peppers because I forgot to pick up mushrooms when I was at the store. Next time I will definitely make it with the mushrooms!
