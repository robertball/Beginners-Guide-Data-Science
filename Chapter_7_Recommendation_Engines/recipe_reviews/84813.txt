Too sweet and too rich.  Very impressive to look at but the prep time took WAY longer than 25 minutes. Chocolate cups needed to be frozen before the foil wrapper wouldn't crack the chocolate. As a beginning cook, I became easily frustrated.

I served these for Mother's Day and they were gobbled up before the other two desserts.  I topped mine with a spoonful of fresh whipped cream and a blackberry on top.  They looked and tasted like they were made by a pastry chef.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

I thought this was a little too rich but my husband loved it. Those of you that have trouble with the foil holders, try silicone cupcake holders, they peel off the chocolate very easily. I made some of the holders with peanutbutter chips instead of chocolate and peanut butter instead of shortening. I thought they were better than the chocolate holders.

For my daughter's baby shower, I just made the chocolate cups. I then filled them with a purchased box of Chocolate Raspberry Mousse. Very elegant and everyone thought I bought them. I am making them again for my Mother's Day Brunch. May squirt a little Redi Whip on top... Very EASY

This recipe was very good, however it was way to sweet.  I would put 2Tbs or 3Tbs in the whipping cream to cut back on the sweetness.  I also used instant espresso and it was very good.

These are so easy to make, although they do take a little bit of time for cooling the chocolate cups enough to unwrap them. They taste wonderful. Tip: I used mini tin foil liners and a mini ice cream scoop. They are very delicate, so make sure to refrigerate the cups for at least a half an hour before trying to unwrap them.

I didn't make the mousse, just the chocolate cups. But the cups were good!
