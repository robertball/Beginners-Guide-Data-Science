If there was a section for Comments, I would leave this message there because this is for the reviewer that gave it one star and commented that it was not really goulash.  Well, it may not be goulash to you but there are thousands of us who grew up eating this and it was called goulash.  It is an easy, filling, economical, tasty dish so keep your reviews to the recipe and not the name, you may not know what you are talking about.  I noticed you did the same thing to a mexican dish;  you said it was not authentic.  This is a site to share recipes and report how it worked for us.

This is the classic goulash made in the mid-west, USA, not Hungarian Goulash. I grew up on this in Iowa, but we used Worchestershire sauce instead of soy sauce, no bay leaf, and a green pepper if we had one.

This is not "classic" Hungarian Goulash but it is goulash or Chop Suey depending on what part of the country you grew up. For me it was western NY and we added canned corn. Made this tonight, exactly as written, for my very picky folks and we loved it; it was a taste of my childhood. Next time I'll add Jalapeno and bell peppers.

This one is classic AMERICAN style goulash.  The picture depicts it.  This is a dish that was mainstay for most of us and even served at school.   @Pathunt:  Nicely done!  I made it just as the recipe states and enjoyed it but next time around I will add a diced green pepper to the meat as it's browning and probably a shake of garlic powder to remind me of school, and LOTS of fresh ground pepper.

I'm grateful for this recipe because it reminds me of a dish my mother made in the mid-1940's in Denmark after the war when we finally could get enough cheap meat with our ration coupons to do it.  This recipe has nothing whatever to do with anything I think of as goulash, whether Hungarian, Austrian, German or even Danish, but it was a way to use ground meat for something other than meat balls.  My mother's concoction was called Red Indian Hash because of the colors added by vegetables (nothing to do with Native Americans either!), and everybody loved it, served not with macaroni in it, but with mashed potatoes on the side to absorb the lovely gravy.  She grated carrots and turnips and any other root vegetable she had and cooked them along with the chopped onions. She might add a few beans or peas as well. Any ground meat was fine - beef, veal, pork, mutton - whatever we were lucky enough to have.  Canned tomatoes did not exist then, so she had to moisten the mix with stock (usually vegetable stock with an addition of yeast extract - no soy sauce then) and chop a tomato or two if she could spare them.  With everything available to us now, just think what we could do with a pound of ground meat, matching veggie flavors and herbs and aromatics to the type of meat.  Thanks for reminding me of what can be done! and of how rich we are now. . .

Because we're on a super tight budget this week, I used only one pound ground meat (half ground beef, half ground pork) and threw in chopped veggies for the rest of the meat (red pepper, zucchini, spinach). To make a more tomato-y sauce, I used V-8 instead of water. I'm out of soy sauce so I used worchestershire instead of soy sauce. I did not need the seasoning salt--we're watching our salt intake--and I also used organic canned tomato sauce, organic canned tomatoes and homemade italian seasoning. Very economical and a good way for me to bend the recipe to add more healthy ingredients for my family nevermind it filled the bellies of my three hungry men very well. There's plenty leftover for lunch tomorrow as well, which I appreciate.

This is delicious! It is near identical to a Paula Deen goulash recipe that I have been making for a few years. It is also easy to make as the noodles are added uncooked. The main difference it appears between this and that recipe of hers, that I use, is it looks like the ingredients here are doubled, so this recipe here will feed a lot! And, this recipe here uses tomato sauce and diced tomatoes and that one uses an equal amount of crushed tomatoes. Either way, Mid-western style goulash is a favorite in my home!

Being from Minnesota, I understood the term "goulash" as meaning "hot dish" as the two terms are more or less interchangable in this state! I realize there is a Hungarian goulash which is completely different, but this is a regional term that I understood to be exactly what it is! Kudos! Yummy

mrsjoedo mentioned something was missing, next time try adding chopped green pepper. To me it's not goulash unless you add it.

My wife talked about wanting this a few weeks ago. As the resident foody I was excited to make it, (not remenbering I have had it) I read at least 100 reviews for this recipe.... I made this "almost to the letter", I was moved by how passionate and nostalgic this was for many reviewers, I added a green bell pepper, and I added celery salt, (3 good dashes) a few dashes of onion and garlic powder, something seemed missing so I added 1 tsp of beef bouillon powder and whabam! A few grinds of fresh black pepper and it melted her heart.

First of all, every goulash doesn't have to be from Hungary.  Goulash also means a mixture, jumble or hedgepodge.  This recipe is definately that. This is a recipe that many, many of us grew up on which makes it a classic.  I do add onions and green pepper to mine when I make it.  If it is too juicy for you just add some tomato paste and be sure to drain the diced tomatoes well.

My father used to own a restaurant and we had this every wednesday for a special.  We could never make enough!  There is a couple of things we did differently though and here they are.  Stewed tomatoes instead of diced, no soy sauce, no italian seasoning, but added celery and green pepper, used veg juice instead of water and 1 teaspoon of chili powder to a recipe this size and also, 1 small can of cream of mushroom soup, this makes it a little bit creamier (sometimes do this and sometimes not).  otherwise, the prep and procedure is the same.

This made a ton..and I even cut it in half. Dinner was easy to make. I just think that the amount of seasoning is off a bit. Too salty and too much Italian Seasoning. I cut back on those to suit our taste. I also decided to cook the noodles separate, so I didn't add the extra water. Total cooking time was about 40 minutes. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I am a bit torn over whether to rate this a four or five...  I just mad this tonight for dinner and it was well accepted by my children.  My husband and I also enjoyed it, however I felt that there was something missing.  For the life of me I cannot put my finger on it.  Still, it was easy to prepare, and on a winter day like today, it was warm, filling comfort food.  We did sprinkle a bit of cheese on top.  After all, everything is better with a bit of cheese!  Thanks for sharing this recipie.  We will definitely make it again!

I have made my twist on this dish tons of times.However,I cook my elbows separately,and add at the end,I use a green bell pepper,one large onion instead of two(2 too many),and  most of the time I use ground turkey(leaner & cheaper) instead of ground beef.I do not use soy sauce(would be too salty) and if using the dried Italian heb seasoning,I don't see any need in using bay leaves.The Italian seasoning would over power the bay leaves,in my opinion.Instead of adding water to the mixture after the meat is cooked and drained,I add two cans of beef broth.This enhances the flavor gives the moisture needed from the water and tastes great.Along with the Italian seasoning,I would also add some cumin and chili powder sea salt and 1/2 cup of ketchup and the worchestershire sauce.Jalapenos,I add them if I have some on hand.This my friends is good eats!!

Thanks Pat Hunt for the memories.  I haven't had "Goulash" in years.  My mother fixed this "Goulash".....whatever, whatever when I was just a youngster and just had to fix it for dinner this evening.  When my husband walked in and lifted the lid on the stockpot, his comment was "It's Goulash!"  I did add a little yellow, red and green pepper, together with 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes and a couple of Tbs. of tomato paste.  Also, I did not drain the diced tomatoes, but held back on the additional liquid to see what consistency I had.  Later in the cooking process, I added V-8 juice until the "Goulash" was the perfect consistency for our liking.  Next time, I think I will cook the macaroni separately because adding it to the stockpot rendered it past al dente`.  But, way back when, who knew al dente`? I served the "Goulash" with a topping of freshly grated parmesan cheese and slices of crusty bread.  Hubby and I both enjoyed this trip down memory lane.  Thanks for sharing.

I carmalize the elbow noodles first in a little oil, it gives it a richer nutty flavor. Try it with different seasoning. I use 2 Tbl. of chili powder instead of Italian & soy sauce. I also use V-8 insead of tomato sauce (sneak in some veggies). I also use my canned crushed tomatoes of store bought. This is a great dish that everyone loves and very cheap to make. Thank you for sharing this "classic" Goulash dish :)

We LOVED this. I used a recipe from this site for the Italian seasoning, did Worst. sauce instead of soy, added a bag of frozen 3 pepper & onion blend and added a tablespoon of Red Wine Vinegar. I had grnd. round, and used whole wheat pasta. Enough left for a couple of lunches and froze enough for another dinner.
UPDATING: Having made this several times, I now know NOT to cook the pasta as long as suggested - unless you want a nasty consistency when leftovers are reheated. Starting checking for doneness after 10 minutes.

After reading many of the reviews, I tweaked this recipe and it turned out D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!!! I browned 2 pounds lean hamburger with 2 chopped yellow onions, 2 stalks of celery, 2 cloves of garlic. Since this is a goulash (you add what you have) I added about 2 Tablespoons of tomato paste (had it in the freezer from another recipe), 2 Tablespoons of bouillon, about 1/2 cup of green and red bell pepper (also had in freezer). When meat is browned and veggies are tender, add 1 small can of tomato sauce, 1 can of stewed tomatoes (I had a pint of home canned Italian salsa, and 1 can of petite diced tomatoes. I also added about 2 Tablespoons Worcestershire, and yellow prepared mustard. I boiled rotini pasta until el dante and added it to the hot mixture. I then added some homegrown sweet corn and mixed it all together. YUM YUM! Thanks to everyone for all the tips and especially to Pathunt for the original recipe. This only took about 35 minutes!

This recipe is a classic midwest version (base) recipe of goulash. I grew up on the Iowa/Illinois border and this is how my entire family makes it - but we season to taste. We use worchestsire sauce instead of soy but either one would either way. Considering this is a base recipe you can add whatever veggies you want! My aunt usually tosses in a can of corn and I add a beef boullion cube for a little extra flavor. Also, I boil my noodles separate and them toss them in sauce. This recipe is a great winter comfort food.

First of all great recipe the only 2 things I did to make it like my moms was added chopped green bell peppers and used Worcestershire sauce instead of Soy sauce. Now for those of you who are not familiar with this, it is an American Goulash dish....if you are looking for a Hungarian, Mexican or Cuban Goulash then search for it by those names and you will find some. This Goulash is what I grew up with some 40 years ago up north, you can not compare this to the others, they are all made different. That would be like me saying a Coney Island Hot Dog is the same as a Chicago Dog...wrong. Again great recipe...thank you.

This is the way I grew up with this dish in Minneapolis. Only thing missing was ketchup and corn. Ketchup gave it the kick needed for flavor. Add to your taste. Love this "goulash".

This was very good and it is easy to cut the recipe in half.  Note to self: use only half the Italian seasoning called for and add a bit of oregano, add beef boullion in place of 2/3 of the salt.  If using Bowtie pasta, double the number of cups needed.  Additionally, a little extra garlic (2 cloves for half a batch) doesn't hurt.

Great recipe!  I made it as is, and it really is a comfort food.  It needs no tweaking!  I have no idea where some reviewers got that it was Hungarian Goulash, but they didn't get it from this recipe.  Never add something like cloves or nutmeg.  Make it as is, and enjoy it as it warms up your tummy.

I have tons of ground beef with no meal idea.  I decided on this since I had everything it called for in my pantry.  I just finished making it and did a taste test...yum, yum!  This tastes great.  I did alter based on other reviews.  I used Worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce and used 1/2 the amount of seasoning salt.  After tasting it I did add a little sugar to it just to give it a little something more and to cut the acidity of the tomatoes.  I am sure once we sit for dinner it will be well liked.  I do plan to top it off with some cheddar cheese.  Thanks, this is a keeper!

My mom always made this dish when we were kids, but she didn't add the bay leaves or soy sauce. I cant wait to try this version. She always cooked it with a whole green pepper for flavor then removed it before serving with cheddar cheese and sour cream. This dish is 100 times better the next day!

This is almost identical to mom's (in Michigan), but she added about 2 tablespoons of sugar in there, and for me, that was the magic ingredient! 

Thanks for sharing!

In my family we used onions, green pepper and celery, cooked with the ground beef, and home canned tomatoes. We also cooked the macaroni separately and added it at the end.

This has been added to my FAVORITES> I can only imagine how much better this gets as it sits and the flavors savor in. So easy and so much flavor. The only two things I did to this... I added more garlic (you can never have too much GARLIC!) and added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce. It was NOT too spicy, like some people complained. of. PERFECT!

I grew up here in the South eating this along with fresh garden vegetables like boiled squash, fried okra, purple hull peas, green onions and homegrown sliced tomatoes with cornbread.  It was an easy way to stretch the meat.  While we did indeed call it goulash, the other common name for it is Chili- Mac.  It was usually made very simply by adding canned tomatoes, chopped onion, a couple of spoons of chili powder, a little salt, cooked elbow maccaroni and cooked ground beef to the pot and simmer for a few minutes.  Brings back a lot of good memories of delicious plate lunches served around my Grandmothers kitchen.

A great childhood memory comfort food... I tweek this to our liking by using 2 cups beef broth and one cup water; also I agree with so many other reviewers that chopped bell pepper is a must. In Boston, we called it American Chopped Suey. In Florida, it's known as Goulash and in Ohio, they call it Marzetti. Whatever name you use doesn't much matter... it's easy, affordable and tasty!

Perfect. Fun. Simple. Great for pot lucks. Works good as written. Easily tweaked. I've made this about 5x. Doesn't disappoint my 3 year old - Does anything else really matter :)? Leaner meat definitely works better - I only use 90/10 if not leaner. If it's a little too soupy for you? Add a little more pasta or cut back the water. I always add worcestershire sauce in place of 1/2 of the soy sauce. Only S&P I add is a little when cooking the beef and that is out of habit. Great to make while sipping a glass of wine!

Thought this was very good, but the italian seasoning was overpowering.  Will reduce the amount to half next time.  Also added 3/4 cup red wine, green pepper.  Yummo!

This was very tasty, here in New England we call it American Chop Suey. I always thought "goulash" was strictly a hungarian stew. I learned something new today! I liked the soupiness of it, very good with some crusty bread on the side. I wouldn't change anything except add a diced green pepper.

This is the goulash I grew up with, in school for lunch, at home for meals, a potluck suppers at church.   Of course the cheese does make it better, but we always sprinkle that on after it is served on the plate.  My spouce is Hispanic and had NEVER and I mean NEVER heard of such a dish as this but sure liked it, even the leftovers.  There are only two of us so I resized the recipe and still had leftovers.  
THANKS so much for sharing this old fashioned recipe.

Great fall recipe! Made it last night. I halved the recipe to feed just the two of us. I took as a few others suggested and incorporated tomato paste. I split the amount of tomato sauce that it called for and did the other half with tomato paste. It definitely makes for a nice thicker consistency. I also used chili flavored diced tomatoes and added a dash of chili powder, onion powder, garlic powder, and black pepper. YUM!

This wasn't a bad recipe, I think Chef Boyardi makes a concoction like this that he calls beefaroni. This isn't a recipe I would make again with elbows. I would prefer it poured over egg noodles.

I grew up in Michigan, and this was definitely called 'goulash'. My Mom passed away when I was young, so I have memories of her delicious food, but don't have recipes. I can't believe I found this. It is sooooo close. This is how I modified it: 1 onion super finely diced, no tomatoes, 1/2 catsup, no bay leaf, and used worsteshire sauce instead of soy sauce. This is a good version for kids or picky eaters (which me and my brother were!) Now that I've perfected it, I'm going to make some and bring it to my brother to see if he remembers it (he was only 6 when mom passed). Thank you so much!!!

Sorry, did not like the taste, at all.  Added sugar and parsley, which at lest made it edible.  Think it's too much soy.

Thank you for this recipe for goulash!  My mother used to make it for us all the time, but can no longer remember how.  I don't think this is her exact recipe, I doubt she put in soy sauce or an Italian herb seasoning, but it's closer than I've found searching.  As many others have pointed out, it's not Hungarian goulash, but American goulash.  (I'm from the Deep South and this IS what we call goulash.)  It's funny, too, because she also made "chop suey" - which was nothing like this, but every time I search for a chop suey recipe, I find something like goulash.  Now, I just need to find a recipe that is like what my mother called chop suey! :-D

Yum! Took other's advise and replaced soy sauce with Worcestershire sauce, added green peppers, and reduced water to 1 cup. The consistency was perfect this way.  I also used Rotel diced tomatoes which gave it some extra kick!

Super easy and will make again!

I needed to use up some ground beef and this did the Ticket!  Quick and yummy. I didn't have any tomato paste so I just used canned chopped tomatoes. I have not made goulash in years. Glad I picked this one. I topped it with shredded Parmesan cheese.  Thank You Pathunt. I  will make this again.

I remember this dish well, a weekly standard from the school cafeteria. Should I prepare this again, I will make changes to the original. First, I would half the recipe, add about half of the salt, and remember to add only 1/2 tsp. Italian seasoning---2 tbsp. dried seasoning is much too much. Even at 15 minutes on simmer, the macaroni was over-cooked. I may also prepare the sauce and the pasta separately, then combine them.

This was wonderful! used one tblsp worchestershire mixed with 2 of the soy sauce. was out of seasoning salt so threw in some old bay and a bit less italian seasoning. Used roasted, seasoned diced tomatoes and i think they made the difference. thanks!!

This is definitely a classic however, when I make this I add a pinch of clove powder, this sounds horrible but it is definitely worth a try, my husband and I love the addition.

My fiance' loves Goulash and I made classic Hungarian Goulash once that he didn't like. I attempted another go at it with this recipe and he loved it...just like Grandma used to make for him.  It was easy and he was happy so this is a keeper!

This is such a comforting, yummy dish. I made a couple of changes per other review - used Worcestershire sauce instead of soy and added diced bell peppers. Used hot sauce and cheese to top it off. Thanks for sharing!

Five stars even w/o chopped green bell pepper.  I grew up on this recipe in Oregon, but my Mom called it McFarligan!   It's wonderful, filling & serves a bunch of hungry diners.  I always loved it on top of a slice of soft buttered white bread & folded over.

This was allright. Nothing special, but a cheap, filling meal nonetheless. I had no idea goulash was a staple Midwest dish. Seems most every reviewer remembers having goulash growing up, whether it be "Midwest" goulash, Hugarian goulash or any number of other versions. I never had goulash as a child, and ironically have lived in the Midwest all my life lol! Regardless of what it is to you, this is a perfect family staple to add to your regular meal rotation. It is especially kiddo pleasing - you can add or remove items to suit everyone's (i.e. "picky") tastes / stretch your budget. I added a small can of sweet corn and a chopped green bell pepper to mine, only made HALF the recipe and had PLENTY of food for myself and multiple days worth of leftovers (this would MORE than feed a family of 4, even if cut in half). My verdict? Is this the best dish I ever made? No. Is this recipe nice to have at the ready for those days you have little time to prep dinner, little cash to spare and picky palates to please? For sure. Since I wasn't "wowed" with the outcome (this was a little bland for my liking) and am not sure my hubby would enjoy this (he's out of town), I think I'll take a pass on making again. Thanks for sharing your spin on an old standby tho, Pathunt! :-)

I come from a German/Austrian family and I grew up eating true Goulash made in the style of the old country.  

I tried this recipe exactly as is and it tastes good enough for a 4 star and is definitely quick and easy to make, but this IS NOT Goulash.

Drop the tomato sauce, soy sauce, bay leaves and Italian seasoning.  Double the onion and add 3 tbsps of black pepper and 1/2 cup of paprika and you've got yourself a 5 star!

Fabulous!  Brings me back to younger years when my mother had this cooking on the stove at least twice a month!  The leftovers were always better once the flavor had time to set in.
Am. chop suey, goulash (def:  a heterogeneous mixture; hodgepodge; jumble.), kitchen catch-all, it's all good.  It is classic American fare and it is good.

My husband really liked this dish.  I went for the slow cooker option and let it simmer for longer than the recipe called for.  It was delicious and easy-it did not matter that it's not "classic" Hungarian goulash to us!

This recipe is for the customary Americanized version that many of us grew up loving.

I tried several different ways of making goulash, but was never really satisfied. Fortunately, I found this recipe, which is an absolute grand slam.  I never want to make it any other way again.

Thank you for this.

I'm not a native Minnesotan, so was mystified (and somewhat bemused) when my wife suggested that I make something called "Hot Dish".  Visions of church basements!  When I deconstructed this Upper Midwest delicacy, it reminded my of what my Rhode Island by way of New York mother called "American Chop Suey".  (I never had the heart to tell her that Chop Suey WAS American).
   I find that I love the basic concept: A cup or two of any small pasta, sauteed onion and garlic, a pound of some kind of ground meat, a can or two of any style of tomato, something for spice, especially Worcestershire, but not too much if you are cooking for Minnesotans.
   I baked it after I assembled it, topped with grated cheddar.  I think this was overkill.  Next time I'd just bake it to make the top a little crunchy.
   My wife gave it, with the above variations, the Church Basement Seal of Approval.

Way too much salt.  I liked the ingredients, but the salt and soy sauce could have been cut in half.  (And I was using low-sodium soy sauce!)  If you make it, do not use this much salt.  Also, I doubled the amount of onion.  That's an inexpensive way to get a little more crunch.

OK as is i guess. however mine uses all the same ingredients plus chopped fresh banana peppers and no soy sauce and using unsalted canned diced tomatoes.  I prefer to add my own amount of salt. I use Cajun Pepper and add 3 rings of chopped Jalapeno for "hot".  I also use jar chopped garlic as it gets the flavor thru the mix quickly. NEVER put the macaroni in the goulash to cook, makes it gummy.  Cook separately and add just before serving.  Buttered french bread is perfect to accompany this one dish meal in a frying pan.

Used homemade tomato sauce (spaghetti sauce). Didn't use diced tomatoes, Italian seasoning, or seasoned salt. Tasted like mom used to make. Served with a simple salad.

Quick, easy, and delicious!  To cut down on the prep time, I cooked the pasta on the side while I was browning the hamburger, then added the cooked pasta to the mix.

This is a good, basic recipe that can easily be tweaked to suit one's personal taste. I made the recipe as stated except I reduced the servings to 4 instead of 8 and I added green pepper, peas and corn for some color and a little more nutrition. The one thing that I noticed was that the Italian seasoning was too strong- it tasted more like spaghetti that I would have liked. Next time I will probably avoid that ingredient altogether and use some red wine and Worchestshire instead and lots of pepper.

The whole family loved it, even my picky husband. Very economical and easy to make.  The best part was that I had all the ingredients right in my cupboard. This reminds me of a dish that my Mom used to make.

In our family, we called this "Goop".  This is pretty much the way Mom made it, but, not so much salt,  and she used worcestershire instead of soy sauce, and stewed tomatoes.  Brings back fond memories.

This was nothing spectacular.   I felt the soy sauce gave it a strange flavor and would've preferred spaghetti sauce from a jar.  I won't be making this again.

We love this dish. Very simple from the dishes I have made before. I followed almost everything. I put 2lbs of cubed steak in place of the ground beef and 24 oz of tomato sauce with a 15 oz can of diced tomatoes with chilies... YUMMM all the way. Enjoy :)

This is good thank you, and just needed the touch of green pepper. Everyone has different taste, that is why this is very good and you can change to your personal preference.

I make this whenever I get lazy. Simple, delicious, quick and it's even better for lunch the next day. I do add the green pepper and some crushed red pepper flakes and I make sure there is a loaf of "Italian Bread" close bye. Dipping in the juice is half the fun! A bottle of Chianti can't hurt either.

I used chicken instead of ground beef (we use chicken in a lot of recipes) and I also used whole wheat noodles.   This ended up a bit more watery than I remember goulash being (it's been a LONG time since I've made it), but the flavor was great!

i have made this multiple times exactly as written and it is amazing.  One thing I have done for  years is cook my macaroni/pasta and keep it in a separate container, that way it never gets mushy, even for leftovers thrown in a ziplock bag.
a bit of sugar towards the end takes a bit of the bitterness out..
Something else I have done is basically make it this way and and some chili seasoning, no beans but makes an Italian chili of sorts. I always use more garlic :-)

OM NOM NOM NOM! I'm the kid who missed out on this classic Americanized dish growing up, so I was pretty excited to finally try it out. i've made it twice now and one thing is for sure.... I totally "get" why so many other families i know have a goulash recipe: 

It's super quick, it's comforting, and the only true staples are tomato, onion, ground beef, bay leaves, and pasta.... otherwise everybody makes it their own, and it's full of win. 

The recipe is very likely perfect as written with ZERO alteration... but I don't think I'll even really know because it's so easy to adjust to fit whatever you're feeling, whoever you're with, and whatever you've got in the fridge.

I made the full 8 servings the first time thinking leftovers would be great, and they were, but WHOA is that a huge amount of food. I also added bell pepper the 1st time.  The 2nd time I skipped the bell and added sliced up baby portabellas. I like the mushrooms version A LOT. 

Both times I wound up doing Worcestershire and soy sauce in equal measures. And I add a whole lot of cheese. Salt seems to disappear into this dish suuuper easily... until you add Captain Parmesan and his sidekick Romano Boy into the mix! They put a stop to the endless sodium free-fall, and add a great extra stringy/melty cheesy element. 

ALL THE STARS, THANK YOU pathunt!!!

Its almost the same exact recipe my mother made us for dinner. Its quick and easy and it tastes delish I usually either top with mozzarella or just sprinkle Parmesan cheese . My 3 yr old loves it and he goes crazy when I make it too.

I grew up on this, or at least on a slightly altered version.  Adding green pepper is good, and or whole kernel corn.  I've also substituted potatoes, sliced or cut into chunks, for a sort of hamburger stew.  I've also played with the spices, using chili powder and cumin, or paprika, with good results.  I consider this "comfort food", one of those easy to throw together dishes circa cold night.  I wouldn't bother with the crock pot; an hour on the stove and dinner it ready.  We like a crusty bread to dip into the broth.

Really enjoyed this comfort food classic on a cold, January day. I did substitute Worcestershire for the soy, added chopped, green bell pepper & took the suggestion in recipe to substitute chicken broth for water. A hearty, flavorful meal.

I must admit that this is my current favorite thing to eat for dinner. I prefer it over chili. I left out the bay leaves and only used one onion. Delish.

Easy recipe to follow and execute.
As I was about to add the table spoon of salt, I thought I had already put the soy sauce in, so I only added half, figuring I could always add more.  What I should have done was not add any salt at all.
The final product was a bit salty.  Next time NO SALT.
Even though it was a bit salty, it was very tasty.  I even went back for seconds.  Have enough let over for another meal.

This was very good, although there are many ways to make this kind of dish. I made it exactly as written, using 85% lean ground beef and whole wheat macaroni. I thought it was fairly soupy at first, but upon standing for a while, and especially as leftovers, it was much better. One thing to note about the leftovers: sometimes things are better the second time (like some chilis), but this recipe was decidedly not, as the macaroni got pretty mushy. This is a pretty tasty, and easy recipe - just have everyone it all up the first night!

Good, solid base recipe.  Like most I changed this up some based on what I had on hand, however I kept the spices and liquid amounts for a half recipe exact.  I made a half recipe and it made 6 healthy servings.  I added a bit more hamburger in my package (about 1/4 lb more), used about 1.25 cups of elbow macaroni (to empty my leftover bag) and added 8 oz of sliced mushrooms because my Grandmother always did. With the additional ingredients, mine almost came out a bit dry.  (My fault, not the recipe.)  Next time I'll add a bit more tomato sauce or add a bit more water.  I found the spices to be exactly what I remember from my childhood.  We will have again when we're wanting something hearty and warm, that reminds us of childhood.  Thanks for sharing.

My husband has been beggin me to make goulash like his Mom's. When I saw this recipe I knew I'd found what he wanted. We loved it! Because we didn't need 8 servings I cut the recipe in half, but had to half again the tomatoe sauce for my husband's taste. Also, I used Italian tomatoes (so only put about 1-1/2 tsp Italian seasoning), Worchestershire sauce and cut up a green pepper. I wasn't sure about the seasoned salt so just added 1/2 tsp garlic salt. It was delicious.

I had my own way of making goulash for years, but now that I have this recipe...I'll be making this recipe instead.  It was so good!  I did add green pepper because that's always in my goulash.  We served this with green beans and homemade Italian Herb Bread in my bread machine.  I halved the recipe because it was only going to be for my husband and I.  I should have made the whole recipe because I had one helping and my husband had 3!  There was just enough left over for my husband's lunch the next day.  It was so good, I plan on having some friends over this weekend and will repeat the meal for them.

Very, very delicious!   The only thing I added was chopped, green pepper.  I also cut the recipe in half, and it still makes a lot!  Will definitely be making this again.

Update - I make this recipe very often.  Sometimes I have some chopped green pepper, sometimes I add a little bit of red pepper flakes - it is delicious every single time.

We loved this recipe.  I didn't have any bay leaves so added 1 teaspoon of pepper instead.  Also the other pictures looked a little watery so I added an extra 1\2-1 cup of noodles.  Turned out great and will definitely be doing this one again.

Love this easy recipe. Made a few changes like everyone else to be custom to my taste. I used bell peppers and sautéed them with the onion in the hamburger. Used Italian seasoned diced tomatoes drained, 4c beef broth instead of water and a tiny can of tomato sauce instead of 2 large ones. Added a can of drained corn. Omitted bay leaf and Italian seasoning altogether. With these changes it doesn't taste like spaghetti sauce. All six of my picky eaters gobbled it up.

I tried the slow cooker version and noodles got too pasty. Might have been ok if cooked for shorter time than recommended.

This turned out perfectly! I didn't have bay leaves but didn't miss them. I used Italian seasoned sauce and diced tomatoes which gave it a really good zesty flavor. I only had rotini noodles on hand so thats what I used, and they were nice and firm. And I added some mushrooms simply because our family loves them in a lot of things. Everyone loved it and it will definitely be made often!

This is terrible. Drop the Italian seasoning and it might come close to edible. Not what I call a "classic".

I cooked the meat/tomato mixture seperate from my pasta. I boiled the pasta then added it to the meat. Left out the bay leaf. This is a good cheap dinner!

My husband"s Mom called this Chop Suey my Mom called it Goulash either way we were both thrilled to have it again.It has been so long since I made it I was happy to add it to my menu week.It was very good and made enough for leftovers.It is just the two of us so I love the way you can change the servings back and forth!

Love this American style goulash! I did make a few changes though - I just thought soy sauce was out of place in this recipe, so I substituted Worcestershire sauce. I also added diced bell pepper and left out the bay leaves, but added basil. I also never add salt to a dish that has other ingredients that contain sodium.

This turned out really good and was very filling on a cold fall day. The only thing different that I did was add the onions and garlic to the ground beef while it was browning. I also add some celery otherwise I left the recipe as is. I will definitely be making this again.

This is definitely American style goulash as I remember it as a child.  However, we also used Worcestershire sauce instead of Soy, definitely used Green Bell Pepper, and we also added a couple of cans of Veg-All mixed Vegetables to make it a bit heartier.  I make this for my son perhaps once a year.  Think I'll make it for him this coming week.  Great recipe!  Thanks!

I had never made goulash but this was delicious! My 15 year old daughter made this and it was easy she had fun and learned a new recipe. Only thing I faced was picky kids that dont like tomatoes so we will have to puree them. Thanks for the recipe share we enjoyed it very much!

As long as it's ground beef, tomatoes, and macaroni it's goulash in my book!
I think it turned out great!  This will be my recipe for goulash from now on!  I did only have 1-1/2 cans of tomato sauce, and two cloves of garlic (then added some garlic powder) - still was delish!

Easy and delicious comfort food.  My husband and sons love this.  I have made this a number of times with two minor changes: add a finely chopped red pepper and substitite one of the TBSP of soy sauce for a TBSP of Worcestershire sauce.  This makes a large amount-great for pot lucks or football games.  Top with a bit of shredded cheese.  Serve with garlic bread and a salad.....yuuummm!  Could try ground pork or turkey to change it up or even veggie crumbles to make it vegeterian.  Thanks!

This makes a TON--- I have a large dutch oven, but it wasn't large enough. I ended up transferring 1/2 of it to another pot before adding the pasta b/c I knew it wouldn't be big enough. Next time I will cut it in 1/2.

Very good. Didn't have soy sauce or italian seasoning so used worchestershire (per another reviewer's advice) and about 1 1/2 cups bloody mary mix to supplement the fact i used homemade canned tomatoes and no tomato sauce. Cooked pasta separately so didn't add the water. my 16 month old devoured it!

This was good but it needed something.  I added a few tablespoons of paprika and that perked it right up.  The recipe is light on the pasta and heavy on meat and sauce, which I thought was great because I used whole wheat pasta and the extra sauce made it taste more like regular pasta.

I really liked this recipe.  It was better than I expected.  I followed everything exactly as written with the exception of using chopped chicken instead of beef for the reduced fat value.  It was excellent with the chicken.

very, very tasty. My 2 substitutions: worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce, and a mixture of penne pasta & whole-wheat broken up spaghetti instead of the macaroni since I didn't have any.

Although I did tweak it a little bit, this was absolutely delicious.  I didn't have plain diced tomatoes so I used diced tomatoes w/green chiles instead.  And since some other reviews said it was runny, I used tomato paste instead of tomato sauce.  It was extremely delicious.  I think the green chiles in the tomatoes gave it that extra punch that other reviews said it lacked.

I like trying different goulash recipes.  This one was pretty good.  I cut the recipe in half since there were only 2 of us.  I used Rotel tomatoes instead of plain and Mrs. Dash garlic and herb seasoning.  I didn't use any bay leaves.  This wasn't too soupy, just right amount of sauce to noodles.  The macaroni was done in about 15 minutes, not 25.  Overall, a good recipe, but I think I'll try another recipe next time.

I usually double this recipe and I use tomato juice instead of water. I don't use tomato sauce in it. To thicken it slightly I use half a  cup of flour mixed with a couple teaspoons of paprika, little bit of marjorum and thyme. I add this to the hamburger and onions and then put the tomato juice and tomatoes in. Then slowly bring to a simmer. It's not watery and tastes great. You can also put green pepper in it, bay leaves and garlic. Just don't get heavy on the thyme and marjorum, a quarter to half a teaspoon goes a long way.

I was given this recipe when I was a young bride.

Reminds me of when I was a kid and we used to have it in school. We called it American Chop Suey. I like to add green pepper to mine. My family loves this.

This is close to the goulash my mom always makes but we always add some chopped celery to the meat when browning.  If I dont add that it feels like something is missing.

I liked it, but for some reason, it really tasted sweet.  Next time, I'll cut the Italian seasoning in 1/2 and the Bay leaf to 1.  I also thought it needed some pepper, so I was rather liberal with the black pepper grinder.  Had no problem with the elbows being mushy and threw them in as directed.

This is the old standard loved and enjoyed by many for generations. We have added to the recipe from time to time with whet we had =. Bell peppers, mushrooms and maybe even a few corn tortillas. Here in Texas we know good grub and this recipe qualifies. I have enjoyed it all my life and 6' 4' and 250 lbs at 70 years tells me Mother knew what she was doing.

We have been eating something similar for years.  Our version also has kidney beans and corn in it to make it more hearty.  Definitely one of our family's favorite in the winter time.

I make something very similar, but with molasses and/or brown sugar rather than the Italian seasoning and soy sauce.  Kids love it!  I also throw in some celery with the onions for extra texture.

This was a great easy recipe.  I too grew up on this (yet I'm from New York, not the midwest) it almost tastes like my moms used to.  I made some modifications using the advice of other reviews and also made some of my own.  Half the recipe certainly makes enough for a family of 4 or even 5.  I omitted the onions and fresh garlic (due to my picky son) and substituted worcestershire for the soy sauce.  I also added in ketchup which gave it some sweetness and then added fresh ground black pepper - I used sea salt and also some garlic salt in place of the seasoned salt.  I had no bay leaves on hand so did not use those. Delicious comfort food - you can also throw in some shredded cheddar cheese in each serving bowl which will melt into the hot goulash which is great.

This recipe was good but I agree with one of the other reviewer's that there's something missing that I can't put my finger on. I followed the recipe exactly but cut it in half. Even cut in half it made a ton! I had about 6-8 servings. Next time I make it I will take other reviewer's suggestions and use worcestershire instead of soy sauce, add a little sugar, and use less Italian seasoning.

Sometimes pleasing all my kiddos taste buds isn't easy. They all LOVED this.  The only thing I did different, was I boiled the pasta separately for a little bit before putting in to simmer (trying to cut down on time it took to cook it) and I did not have any Italian seasoning, so substituted 3/4 tsp each of Basil, Rosemary, Thyme and Oregano and a touch of Marjoram.  I did half the recipe.  Will definitely be making this again! Oh, and I added a half a green pepper as well.  Thank you for this recipe! :)

Second time I made this in the crockpot.  Added corn, red bell pepper, worcestershire, and some catsup for sweetness.  Also added a few spoonfuls of Kahlua.....great secret ingredient! Is even better the next day! Easy and wonderful comfort food!

This recipe was picky-husband approved. I gave it 4 stars because on its own, it's a decently good recipe. But the beauty of this recipe is it can go so many directions for your own personal tastes to make it 5 stars for anyone. I've made goulash a few times using this as a base, and I've added different things every time for delicious satisfying comfort food. I've added corn, black olives, diced bell peppers, mushrooms, anything in my fridge or pantry that I feel like throwing in.

Excellent Goulash recipe but it makes ALOT!  I cut it in half b/c it is just my husband and myself and we still had enough for 2+ meals. The only changes that I made were to add a dash of worcestershire sauce (a must) and used bowtie pasta instead of macaroni b/c it's what I had on hand. My husband is from the SW and had never heard nor had goulash but it is now one of his favorite comfort meals!

I gave this 5 stars most especially because my grandkids gobbled it all up with gusto. I work hard to find dishes they will eat, so I was thrilled. I added a small amount of small diced green pepper and used up some beef and chicken stock that I had in the fridge instead of the water. Served with crusty bread spread with the "Garlic Butter" recipe from this site. A big hit all around.

This tasted fine but was lacking the wow factor I remember as a child (although in all honesty my perspective on food has changed since then). My husband and 4 kids were not impressed either.  Paula Deans recipe is much better.

I made a half batch of this because there is only 3 of us but the outcome was very good. The only change I made was to add a little green pepper because so many others had suggested it. Threw in a splash of Worcestershire (sp)sauce at the end for a little kick and we all enjoyed this great comfort dish.

Tastes really good! 
It's a big hit in our house!
I would change the directions for the Bay leaves-next time I would tie a string to the bay leaves so they are easier to pull out.  I also would add more diced tomatoes b/c I like it chunky.

My family really liked. Did add a chopped green pepper. and used beef broth instead of water.  UPDATE: My mother in law informed me she had a similar one she made for years with 2 packages of sloppy Joe mix, no soy or seasoned salt otherwise it was the same. I tried it this way next time and it was even better!

Sorry, but no one in my family liked this.  We like our goulash to be a bit on the sweet side.  I would make again, but without the soy and add some sugar instead.  The soy was just too much for our taste.

I followed the recipe exactly for the slow cooker version noted at the bottom, with the exception of using bay leaves since I did not have any. It was SO easy and tastey. We dished it out, sprinkled cheese on it, and ate it with some fresh bread. My husband added hot sauce to his bowl to give it a kick, but I did not add that or a green pepper as some reviews suggested since I have kids who like more basic flavors. Both the kids and hubby liked the flavor and I plan on moving this dish into our regualr rotation of meals.

Way too much Italian seasoning.  The next time I think I will use the diced tomatoes that already have the spices in them and omit any Italian seasoning.

I made this last night. It was easy and reminded me of my childhood. I did find it lacking flavor wise. I like the idea of adding the cheese and garlic. I also plan on adding some canned Cayenne pepper and green peppers to the mix. This recipe was just not there yet...

Great recipe.  I made it as written except cooked the macaroni separately.    Have made this for years but never thought to use a bay leaf or soy sauce.   If I am in a real hurry I use a jar of spaghetti sauce with added veggies.   This was not called "Hungarian Goulash" and I did not expect it to be.   I also make the Hungarian version and we love them all!

Similar to what I make, but it has to be bland...needs the warmth of spices like clove and nutmeg, cinnamon if you do not like clove....experiment ! A splash of worcestershire too.  I do not cover after adding macaroni, it will cook in 20 minutes or so to al dente.  25 minutes coverd, I think would be mush

this is wonderful.  When i was growing up though here in the northwest we would add the bell pepper as well as "welfare cheese" (version of velveta) and olives to have it go that extra stretch. It was good though either way and there wouldn't be any leftovers. Thanks Pat Hunt for posting a wonderful childhood recipe!

Classic American goulash. Definitely need to add the green pepper. I had never used soy sauce in the past and have tried it with and without. I can't really tell the difference. I use 1 large onion and 1 large green pepper. The last time I made it I used the italian herb tomato sauce & diced tomatoes and no italian herb seasoning. Was very flavorful. Thanks for putting this recipe up! Using one dish is great!

I was looking for a recipe to match the goulash that I used to buy from Schwans. This came out very close. This was fantastic. I did add some green pepper along with the onion. It also needed anotehr 1/2 cup of water. We really enjoyed it.

Great recipe, but I would reduce the seasoning quite a bit, then add more if you think it needs it. I reduced the Italian seasoning to 1 teaspoon, and only added 1 bay leaf. I also used worshestershire sauce instead of soy sauce, and I thought this was really great

This tasted good, but it was too salty for my taste.  Next time I will try to find "no salt" tomatoes and maybe cut back on the soy sauce and season salt.  I also liked the Italian season flavoring, but it was a little strong so next time I will cut it in half.

This was very tasty...interesting how different backgrounds and cultures have different versions of goulash...my mother was from the Rhine in Germany and her goulash was definitely not this...this was called sloppy joe in our house (with the addition of green peppers and we use half ground beef and half ground pork and about 1/2 pound of chopped bacon).  We also don't cook the noodles in with the meat...it is put over noodles like a pasta sauce.  Definitely a favourite.  Although we used Maggi instead of soy sauce.  Maggi is a staple in our german household for most meat recipes - grilled, baked, fried or roasted.  Thank you, I enjoyed trying your recipe.

I made half a recipe as we are only 2 people.  I used one jar sauce (good organic brand) instead of the 2 cans and used stock instead water. And I added extra bell pepper for more vitamin C. It came out excellent! My husband and I loved it. Very similar to how our moms made when we were kids. Definitely make again.

Made this tonight.  It was very easy to prepare and good.   But next time, I will cut down on the Italian Seasoning.  I found it a little overpowering, but that's a personal taste.

Grew up eating some version of this only my mom called it slumgullion or goulash.  On the  70's Connecticut public school menu it was American Chop Suey.  
Mom would serve with Kraft Parm (us kids called it sprinkle cheese) and bread & butter.  I've subbed rinsed great northern beans for part of the meat at times as well.  Good & reliable dish.

I make this often, I add celery onion peppers, and handful frozen corn at the end. Beef browned, veg, tomatoes, I use seasoned ones and a small can sauce, beef broth elbows or shells, cheese, season to toast, and I top with pankomand bake a bit.

Easy recipe, very good, made some simple modifications: 1 onion instead of 2, added 1 green pepper, 3 tbs paprika, used beef broth instead of water, NO seasoned salt & No bay leaf and added about 1/4 cup of sugar. Will be making this again.

My husband loved this. However I did make some changes. First I used ground lamb, and at the end I added some sour cream, goat cheese, and cream cheese. Also since it was goulash, I felt it needed some paprika. I sprinkled a little hot and a little regular. I love the fact it was one dish and so much easier to clean up.

My family loves this recipe, the only thing I do different is add some sugar to sweeten it and add and extra cup of elbo Mac. Very good hearty meal with plenty of leftovers that gets eaten quickly ! I have used fresh tomatoes when I have extra also.

Turned out GREAT!! I halved the recipe since it’s only my wife and I now. After reading reviews I used 1 can on diced tomatoes with green chilies and 1 beef bouillon cube and I had a bag of frozen onion with red and green peppers so I used half of the bag. I also added 1tbs of Worcester sauce. OMG!!!! This with some fresh homemade sourdough bread slathered with butter was soooo good. I’m floundering over here. Tomorrow it will even be better!!!!

This is classic American Goulash. The only steps I did differently were to add a can of green beans and  a can of corn and 3 cups of macaroni instead of two. Just like my Gram used to make!

Perfectly seasoned and delicious.  I reduced cooking time for macaroni by 5 minutes.  My family said this is the best goulash that I have ever made.Adding to this review. I have actually made this goulash a dozen or more times.  It is the best our family has ever had. I have switched to whole grain pasta because it doesn’t get mushy.  I have also reduced the seasoned salt by half.  Bonus:  It is so easy to make.

My family absolutely loves this dish! I used ground turkey and they were surprised that it wasn't hamburger. The turkey tends to be more tender too. It's my "go to" goulash recipe.

Exactly what I was looking for in a classic American goulash. I cut everything in half to only make 4 servings (simply because I only had 1lb of ground beef) and it was perfect for my 4 and 1/2 qt. Dutch oven. I will save this recipe as my go-to goulash. It was fabulous! Thank you!

Precooked the macaroni to save time, so omitted most of the water (maybe used 1/3 to 1/2 cup of water).  Cut the recipe in half  and it was enough for a family of 4 with leftovers. I did not measure exactly the "Italian spice"  and just used what I had on hand. Topped with a sprinkle of cheddar cheese. My kids loved it.

I have made this several times and my family loves it! Like was said in an earlier post this may not be goulash in the truest traditional form but to thousands and thousands of us baby boomers it is exactly what we grew up on. This recipe is as close to moms as I could find and it is delicious.

This recipe was very similar to a dish my italian grandmother used to make when I was little so it brought back sweet memories for me.  I made this for my family on a rare snowy day in Wake Forest, NC.  It was the perfect easy meal on a very cold and blustery day.  Simple ingredients and a delicious end result.  I made 2 changes...I substituted beef stock for the water and I added a can of sliced mushrooms.  I served this with a recipe I found for homemade cheddar biscuits.  Yum-yum!  There are 3 adults and two teenage boys  in our family.  With the biscuits, this fed us all with plenty left over for tomorrow night.  Thank you for the yummy recipe.

I have been making a version of this recipe for 40 + years and this one is very good.  I also add mushrooms, red/green/yellow peppers and celery.  I make it for two people and this is easy to do...just divide the ingredients in this recipe by four.
We always sprinkle Parmesan cheese on it at serving.
Absolute comfort food !

This is the best goulash I have ever served. I substituted 1 can of rites and 1 can of garlic basil diced tomatoes instead of the regular diced tomatoes because that is what I had and it was outstanding. Will make this once a month from now on.

Since it's just my husband and me I started by making the recipe as stated. However after I got the meat and 'sauce' made I placed half of that mixture in a freezer bag for freezing. Then I added half of the called for macaroni to the rest and finished cooking it. There was plenty for the 2 of us with leftovers for lunch the next day. Now I  have the makings in the freezer for another meal and think I'll add some corn to it next time.

I followed the recipe exactly except adding some canned green beans and some canned corn.  The flavor was SO good!!!
I am definitely adding this to my favorites!!!
UPDATE:  I've now been making this recipe for a while and it has become a main staple in our house.  It is absolutely delicious every time.
ANOTHER UPDATE:  I've now made this many many times.  The recipe as is makes a very large quantity and it doesn't do well as a leftover because the noodles get too gooey.  Since my family loves it so much, rather than cut the recipe in half I make a full batch but put half of it in the freezer BEFORE adding the noodles.  Then when we're craving my now famous "daddy's goulash" I can just thaw it, heat it up, and add the uncooked noodles about 20 minutes before serving.  LOVE this recipe!

Since I live in China I have limited access to ingredients but this one is doable. I added green and red pepper, chopped small.  And I cooked the macaroni separately, so it would not be over cooked.  It turned out well, and was quick and easy.

We make this all the time its great for getting rid of leftovers in the fridge. we use one pound of ground beef and any other meat leftover,  pork chops, chicken ,sausage, pot-roast etc. just remove the bones and add to sauce when you use a combination its delicious. We also call it chop suey at our house. Best to cook macaroni separate and add in at the end.

Great flavor and so easy! We have one onion hater in our family. I ran them through the food processor, and he never knew they were there.

This is my second time making this. The first time, I made the recipe to the letter. My husband commented that his mom always added ketchup, when he was growing up. I added 1/2 cup and it was perfect. Great recipe.

One of the best recipes for goulash I've ever had.  Didn't change a thing.  Will surely make again.

I made this just as the recipe called for. It was pretty good, but kinda like a spaghetti soup. I think I'd like it better with much less Italian seasoning. It was also a bit on the acidic side but we sprinkled a half a teaspoon of sugar or so on it & that helped. I'll likely make this again & change the seasoning some.

1st time I made this (3yrs ago) shared the dish with some guys at work. It was a smashing success., it turned out perfectly and was delicious.  I'm now making for the 2nd time to take to a Super Bowl party. I'm hoping it turns out just as good as the 1st time.  I increased the servings to 12.  I totally enjoyed the 1st go round.

I made this as is at first, except I used chicken stock instead of water. It was a little bland so I added another half a tbs soy sauce (I use low sodium) and added 1-2 tbs worchestershire. Came out great!

This was delicious. It reminded me of the goulash that I ate when I was growing up. So easy too. I did use Worcestershire instead of soy sauce. This was definitely worth making.

I love this recipe! I have made this a dozen times, and it is one of our favorite dishes. It turns out great in the dutch oven.  I alter the portions of several ingredients slightly (just to make prep easier): I use one 28 oz can of diced tomatoes and one 24 oz jar of tomato, garlic, and onion flavored tomato sauce.  I also chop one large white onion in place of smaller yellow onions.  I also substitute the pre-made Italian seasoning with 1tsp each of oregano, parsley, and basil, and omit the salt.  I use 1 full box (1 lb) of elbow macaroni, and only simmer that for 20 minutes (reduced from 25) so the pasta isn't too soft.  Thanks for sharing!

I always ask my family,when trying a new recipe, if it is a 'keeper'. This recipe not only was a keeper but my youngest keeps asking when we can have it again. She is the pickiest in our house. I also like substituting worcestershire instead  of soysauce. It seems to go with other ingredients better.

This was fabulous. I made it last night for myself and my fiance. He loved it! I followed the recipe exactly and added an additional 1/2 cup of elbow macaroni, 1 tablespoon Worcestershire Sauce, and a few red pepper flakes. The ONLY reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I believe the noodles should be cooked separately - and then added in. Very good - thanks for sharing!

This is exactly how I remember my mom's recipe tasting.  I've been making it the last 6 months and I'm going to share it with my siblings today.  This family meal was lost when my mom past away. My siblings haven't had this meal in fifteen years or more. Thank u so much for the recipe!!!!!

I made this for my family with my 15-year-old son. We had fun making it, and it was absolutely delicious! We did substitute the soy sauce with Worcestershire sauce.  Will definitely make this again! And it made plenty to feed my family of 5 two meals!

This was great and very easy once the prep is done.  I took some of the advice of others and used beef stock instead of water and worcestershire instead of soy sauce.  It sounds like a lot of liquid, but in the end it's just right;  not soupy at all.  I only cooked the noodles until they were just done;  do not let them cook too long.  This tasted even better the second day!  One more thing;  this makes a ton of goulash, but it freezes well!

It was pretty good, but really strong on the bay leaves and left an after-taste we didn't care for.  My fiance ate two bowls, but said it left a weird taste. The macaroni doesn't need 25 minutes, it was way overcooked.  Next time I will omit the bay leaves, add an extra cup of water (mine was too thick) and maybe add some Tony's for a little kick.  Great base recipe though.

Classic Goulash Haiku: "Halved the recipe ... or would've fed an army. Tasty and filling." I don't have much of an understanding of different regional types of goulash so I thought it was just noodle-meat-hodge-podge. Like a boxed convenience meal, but not from a box. We liked it and the only change I made was preparing it ahead of time and putting in the oven at 350 for 25 min. closer to dinner. Makes a working day much easier come suppah'time.

I made a vegetarian and meat eaters version of this. Both I eyeballed the ingredients and it turned out good for both. I did however add bell pepper and mushrooms to both. The vegatarian one I also added lentils and summer squash to round out the fact I took out the meat

Family liked this dish.  I followed the recipe pretty close other than a few minor changes for taste.  1 can petite diced tomatoes, 1 can Italian seasoned tomatoes, 1 Tbs Ital seasoning, 2 Tbs Soy, and 2 Bay leaves.  Probably could punch up the flavor a bit more next time.  Crushed tomatoes worked in place of the tomato sauce for me since that is all I had on hand.

Great goulash recipe, I made it just as the recipe states, but only 1 large onion because of the kids. After 45 minutes in the crock pot I tasted it and added more seasoning and left on for 20 more minutes it was perfect! I moved it down to keep warm for when my husband got home from work and it was even better after simmering for while longer.

Mmm came out so good!I only had one bay, so I added that instead of 3. I followed the slow cooker instructions but I recommend you do 2 hours instead of one, but then again everyone's slow cooker is different.:) Other than that thank you for sharing your recipe!

Excellent.  I cut the recipe in half; used 32 oz of beef broth instead of water; substituted the Italian seasoning for a seasoning blend that I had that included peppercorns and red pepper to give it some heat; browned the beef and cooked it all in a crock pot on high for three hours and then added 1-1/2 cups of elbow macaroni turned it down to low for 15 mins and let it sit for another 1/2 hour.  The macaroni soaked up most of the broth and the consistency turned out great.

I fowled this recipe too a tee I really think 1 tbs of the Italian spice would be more then enough  seems that's  all I could taste is that  it calls for 2 tablespoons I thought that was a bit much now I am full blown Hungarian and Slovak so that might have something too do with that anyways thought it was good and easy to make next time I will just cut back on the Italian seasoning a little  very good and easy to make thank you. I am a singal guy and always looking for quick and easy meals to make . thank you for your recipe  dave

Very easy and flexible. Used crushed tomatoes instead of diced and added some zucchini. Very good - and delicious way to give the family more veggies.

This was SO good!  Even my pickiest eater loved it! This will definitely be my go to recipe from now on. I didn't have soy, so I substituted Worcestershire sauce.  Very yummy dinner on this below freezing night.

This is the goulash I grew up eating and still make it often.  My grown boys  make it when they want comfort food. They like to eat this with Italian bread, cottage cheese and green beans for a complete meal. (I still make the Hungarian goulash as well with the gravy and paprika over wide noodles.)

This is certainly a classic.  In my family we add kidney beans.  Besides adding flavor, the beans have a thickening affect.  Sometimes I add a southwest mix of black beans and corn and some Mexican seasoning, but I still call it goulash.  Using a crock pot gives it that second day taste.

Loved this recipe. I added green peppers to mine and forgot to add the soy sauce (was actually planning on doing 1/2 soy and 1/2 Worcester). Even without the soy sauce though it was very delicious. I really liked how much it made for such a little cost. Will be making this again.

I really wanted to Love this recipe!  I tried it in my slow cooker taste wise it was Delicious! I did make some changes used beef broth instead of water fresh garlic,diced up a bit of green pepper and omitted the soy sauce Unfortunately the noodles had an awful texture it just wasnt for us. The end result looked like mush lol :( Also I had to cook it for a lot longer then an hour in my slow cooker. I will try this again cooking my noodles separate. To salvage it so my daughter would eat it I melted a ton of Mozzarella cheese on top lol

I had to half the meat and go without the second can of diced tomatoes but it came out great. I also used chili powder instead of seasoning salt. As a busy student with a non-cooking boyfriend this was perfect. It's delicious, cheap, and can make a lot so that we can eats lots of leftovers. I will be making this again.

This was an easy meal with ingredients that you already have on hand.  I, like some of the others, added diced green pepper, black pepper and some garlic powder for more flavoring.  Thanks for posting!

We love love love this recipe - thanks pathunt for submitting it!  I've made it several times now and kept forgetting to write my review for it.  The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly and although wonderfully tasty, it was just a tad watery/soupy for my family's taste.  So now when I make it I simply don't use as much water (I use about half the amount called for).  Wonderful!!

I followed some reviews that suggested the recipe called for too much Italian seasonings so I reduce the amount to 1 tablespoon & 1 bay leaf. I'm glad did...more would have been too much. We all enjoyed this recipe and will make it again.

The first time I made this recipe, I omitted the season salt because I have to monitor my sodium intake and with the soy sauce and other canned ingredients, I figured there was enough salt.  The dish came out ok, but it was bland and my wife didn't care for it.  I made it a second time and added the season salt and the dish was phenomenal!  I have craved it every week since.  I'm so excited that I get to make it again this week.   I definitely like it with grated Parmesan cheese on top, but otherwise this recipe is fantastic!  Thanks pathunt!

Just like Mom used to make...halved recipe, threw in some corn, out of bell pepper, still made enough to feed an army.  Shredded cheese on top helped.

The flavor was perfect, but 3 cups of water is way too much.  I used 2 cups and about 3 1/2 cups of pasta and it was still a little soupy.  Next time I'm thinking 1 cup of water and about 2 1/2 cups of pasta.  But seriously, incredible flavor, and super easy to make.  A total keeper.

My teen daughter, who is just beginning to cook, made this for dinner last night. We were out of bay leaves (which is extremely unusual) so she left that out, and she reduced the seasoning salt by 1/3 to 2 tsps. She also used a little more ground beef than called for to use up the package.  I haven't had this dish for many, many years, but we all enjoyed it, including my two nephews who joined us for dinner.  It was kid-friendly, easy comfort food.

This was perfect for me!  I used 1lb ground beef and added some worcestershire sauce and green pepper.  Mine thickened up nicely.  I will be making this again once Fall arrives.

Made this tonight for supper. My family loved it!! I've never had this before, but I will cook it again.  The only adjustments I made was add black pepper,  3 shakes of Celery seed, and a little beef bullion!!

This was "ok".  I used different noodles because I just don't care for the elbow macaroni.  I omitted the soy sauce because even the low sodium soy sauce has quite a bit of sodium in it.  I would probably make again but would make some variations to see if I could make it a little more flavorful.

This recipe was just so so. I made as written and was not impressed. Next time i'll add some corn and green bell peppers and cut down the italian seasoning and do 2 bay leaves, it was overwhelming. Its a good foundation for goulash but needs some work.

Personally, I think three bay leaves is a bit much. One medium to large one is plenty, at least for us. Otherwise, this dish is as I remember it from my childhood: good if not delicious, hot, and filling. Also pretty dang cheap. Recommended!

This is so delicious! I added diced green pepper, used A-1 instead of soy sauce (only because I didn't have soy sauce) and added a couple good splashes of Frank's Red Hot.  Don't think I'll make goulash any other way now!

This was so good!  I used turkey meat instead and the diced tomatoes were the Italian blend kind you can get at the store, plus low sodium soy sauce.  So simple, and smelled delicious while cooking.

Simple to make and a go to dinner when I want something homey. Easy to make any additions you like. I probably make it different every time in regards to adding veggies or spicing it up a bit. Depends who I am cooking it for. But to me there is nothing better than a one dish meal. Serve it with fresh bread and a nice salad and dinner is done

Very good and simple. You can certainly jazz it up easily in many ways. I cut it in half for my family, but I do increase the amount of elbows. As is, it is almost a chili.

Its pretty basic; I used cilantro spiced diced tomatoes; did not add italian spice or soy sauce, instead throw into it what you have, red / green pepper, celery, carrot etc and splash with Worstershire. Creative in the kitchen depends upon what you have on hand and in mind. Put Merlot next to it, and who will complain?

Not bad. I followed the recipe very closely. I felt like it was sort of bland. My husband enjoyed this and said it reminded him of beefaroni, so I may make it again one day, but I'm not dying to make this for dinner anytime soon. It's a good recipe to make if you have picky children - most kids like bland-tasting macaroni and beef in tomato sauce, it's cheap, and makes a lot of food. So there you have it.

This recipe turned out well. Instead of ground beef, we used ground turkey. We added about 1 cup of corn kernels too (like Grandma used to do!). Delicious!

This is keeper. My husband loved it.  I think everything turned out as it was intended. I didn't have elbow macaroni so I substituted with whole wheat penne rigate. It really made it fabulously hearty! The whole neighborhood smelled delicious!

This is perfect comfort food, and my family really enjoys it.  Which is a good thing, because this recipe makes a LOT.  I've made this four times now; the first time exactly as written, and tweaking to our personal tastes in subsequent efforts.  This is a very simple dish that lends itself to putting your individual stamp on it.  I only use one onion, but increase the garlic, and I also prefer Worcestershire to soy sauce.  I've also added corn as others have suggested and it adds a slight sweetness to the dish.  All in all, a great recipe.

Very good goulash! I only changed a few details and I decided to half the recipe. I omitted the salt since others said it was too salty; I used 1 1/2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce; and upped the macaroni to 1 1/2 cups. It came out great and my husband said "Goulash....Good!", which is quite a compliment.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I used my crock pot and did make some adjustments that other users suggested. I used the tomato juice instead of water. I was rather heavy handed with the seasoning. I added lots of pepper. I used Worcestershire instead of soy sauce, too. Oh and I added a orange bell pepper and a can of cream of mushroom (which was awesome by the way). Wow, now that I typed this out I realize how many adjustments I actually made. I was just so excited about everyone's suggestions I guess I used them all. Oh well, it was delicious :)

Overall, I liked the recipe, but it had way too much Italian seasoning in it. I even used less than the recipe called for. I will make it again, but with about 1/2 the Italian seasoning.

So delicious!  My family really enjoyed this!  Didn't use any of the salty stuff like soy or season salt (we have health issues with that).  I didn't have enough tomato sauce so I subbed in a jar of chili sauce and it was just fine!  I also added some green pepper and used ground turkey.  It's now in my recipe file.  Thanks!

Pretty good foundation recipe, but it took some doctoring to get it the way I wanted. As some of the reviewers have stated, it ended up rather soupy so I mixed in a can of tomato paste after the noodles were tender. It also was a bit bland so 2nd time around I used one large can (28 oz) stewed tomatoes instead of the diced, swapped out the soy for worcestershire, and added some black pepper... now I have a recipe I love!

I haven't had goulash in years, and I don't remember it ever being this good.  I added a green bell pepper and used spaghetti sauce (because it was open) instead of plain tomato sauce - but other than that stuck to the recipe.  Great flavor - my husband and I couldn't stop eating it and are looking forward to the leftovers!  Thanks so much for posting - this is going in with the "keepers"!

This was a wonderful receipe. Not sure where a couple of the above raters determined this was classified as a Hungarian Goulash, it was never represented as that. Besides this midwestern receipe blows away the hungarian style anyway. Hats off to a wonderful dish!!

Made exactly as written (except I didn't have any bay leaves) and this was yummy! Just like I ate growing up in Minnesota. I topped with a bit of shredded cheddar cheese and that was excellent also! Only made 1/2 of the recipe and still had leftovers.

Close to the way I make mine except in place of tomato sauce and water I use tomato juice. I don't like the tinny taste of tomato sauce. I also use about 3 stalks of diced celery for flavor.

This was outstanding! I dont measure much but used all the ingredients and it turned out great. If you're worried about too much liquid just add a little more macaroni. Nice recipe.

Just made this the other night, it was OK but it was very bland and I added a green pepper and a couple of jalapeno peppers to it.  If I make it again I'll have to spice it up a little more.

This was decent, but missing something, as other reviewers said. I added more macaroni than the recipe called for, but it was still soupier than I expected. This made a TON of food. I will maybe play with the spices for my leftovers, as my family of three may be having this for DAYS. Not sure I would make this again otherwise.

I made this last night and it made a lot!! It was just OK with my family, I will add a little Chile Pepper if I make it again.  I just can't figure out what else it needs.  I would leave out the seasoning salt, maybe a little too salty.

Our children ask for this when they are heading "home" and will be arriving late!  To the reviewer saying something is missing, it's BASIL, add LOTS of basil and garlic!  AND PEPPER to taste!  This is also even better the next day if there's any left.

The entire family loved this even though this even though they initially turned up their noses when they heard the name and saw the pictures. The only change I made was to add pepper and replace the soy sauce with Worcestershire sauce. A keeper!

This was pretty good.  I halved the recipe for two of us and still had some left.  The only reason it's not five stars is because I thought the Italian seasoning was a little overpowering.  Next time, I'll cut that in half.  Thanks!!

Added green pepper, beef broth instead of water, less italian seasoning, 1/2 worchester / 1/2 soy, more noodles, and made 1/2 a batch as there are just 2 of us. Thanks.

It had been probably 10 years or so since I had goulash. It was way back when I lived at home. I followed this recipe to a T and it was great! It fed my family of 3 and we had enough left overs for us all to have it again the next day. Highly recommend!

Was looking to find something close to my grandfathers homemade goulash and this sounded close.  The kids loved it.  I added some red pepper to mine and it was good, not great.  Will keep messing with it until I get it like grandpa's.

Goulash was very good. 2 TBSP of italian seasoning is to much. I only put 1 1/2 TBSP when I made it and it is still too much in my opinion. I completely left out the seasoning salt only because I didn't have any and im glad I didn't. It would have been way to salty. This recipe has so much seasoning it doesn't need the salt. It is full of flavor. I may even put only 2 bay leafs next time instead of 3. Not that I like my food bland by any means but I don't like as much flavor.  It is bursting. I added parm cheese and cheddar cheese. served with hawiian rolls but plan to fix cornbread. I will fix it again!

Good!  Followed recipe exactly & wasn't exactly what I expected (in a good way).  I expected it to be more like spaghetti, but it wasn't.  Kids liked it too!  Will definitely be making again.

Very good recipe, didnt turn out as soupy or liquidy as in some in the pictures but overall pretty good. Only changes I made were to add Wors. sauce as others suggested and omitted the onion and used a tbsp of dried onion. No garlic on hand so didnt use it. Pretty filling and and will be a few meals for us!

Very good, but way too salty. I would recommend leaving out seasoned salt entirely until the end, then adding a little at a time until the salt level is correct.

While making this, I could tell about 15 minutes in that simmering the sauce while covereed was going to make this too soupy for our tastes. I uncovered it and allowed it to simmer for about 25 more minutes which thickened the sauce up nicely. I then added the noodles.

I served with garlic bread and everyone seemed to enjoy it. Next time, I will add more spices as I thought it was a little bland.

Delicious!  I halfed the recipe, used beef stock in place of water, and used 1.5 cups of macaroni.  Turned out perfect!  I don't think there was too much italian seasoning.

This is really good. The only difference I did was add 2 1/2 cups of macaroni and used seasoned diced tomatoes.
Only thing is I found this recipe on Food Network's website listed under Bobby Dean's recipes. UNUSUAL

This was really good.  My hubby use to eat something similar to this growing up in Oklahoma.  Only change I made... added 4 cups of pasta sauce instead of reg. tomato.  I also added a small bag of frozen mixed veggies.  Even my 2 boys loved it!

I lost my old recipe for American Chop Suey and this one came pretty close. I added a chopped red pepper, but otherwise kept the recipe the same. I think next time I'll use beef broth instead of water to enhance the flavor a bit. The seasoning was good and the consistency was perfect. Served it topped with shredded cheddar and with garlic bread. Very good recipe and one that can withstand additions (shredded carrot, chopped zucchini, chopped mushrooms, etc.). This will become a regular in our house!

Great recipe!  I call it homemade hamburger helper.  I added chopped celery and some grated carrots, everyone loved it.  I like that you added the macaroni uncooked, it makes everything so much easier.   There were leftovers, so it's going to go in thermos in the kids lunch for school tomorrow.

This was good. I used Worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce, stewed tomatoes instead of diced, & omitted the onions and replaced them with 3 chopped green bell peppers. (onions don't agree with me). It made enough for 8 good-sized bowls. My teenage son pat me on the shoulder during dinner and said "This is good, Mom." When you can please a teenage boy, you have a winner!

I loved this and I prepared it just like it said, wasn't to thin, nor to thick.  Thank you for a good meal

Pretty good. I definitely suggest making only half a recipe unless you plan on feeding a family the size of the Duggars or want leftovers for weeks. It tastes just like I remember my mother's tasting. Tastes better after sitting for a while too.

This is a regular at our house. Since the kids love it so much, I always sneak in some frozen chopped spinach. Whatever you do, do NOT substitue Worcestershire for soy sauce. It is not the same!  I often add a little extra soy and omit the salt. I also add a little sugar to cut the acidity of the tomato.

enough for 8 with good appetites
good flavor
I think you could add more pasta if you want it to feed more -might have to increase the liquid a bit - or cook pasta separately.

This was simple and fabulous! My kids ate every bite and asked for more! I wasn't sure if we would like it, so I halved the recipe and I used medium shells instead of elbow. A great comfort food- I will make it again and again!

My Husband asked me tonight if I would make something I had not made in years.  When he started mentioning the ingredients, I told him "that is Goulash"...I just looked at it on Allrecipes and have it printed out.  I hadn't made this for many years and am so thankful to you for posting it.  When I moved to VA from Arkansas I made this quite often, but when I went back to driving a tractor-trailer I no longer cooked very often, so I am so glad I have this recipe to use again.  This can be custom made for everyone, just by adding green peppers or anything else.  I do add a bit of sugar, but other than that IT IS GREAT!  THANKS...

This recipe was delicious. I have made it twice. I made it the first time as written and changed it a little the second time. I added grated zucchini and 5 garlic cloves instead of three. I added some fresh cherry tomatoes too. My kids love this recipe and so does my husband. Thank you for sharing.

This was a really good, basic goulash!  I made it as written with 2 exceptions - Worcestershire instead of soy sauce (personal preference) and no bay leaves (because I didn't have any).  It was really tasty and made a lot!  Thank you for the recipe!

Very good - worked well in the slow cooker but don't leave the noodles in the slow cooker for more than maybe 40 minutes at the most or it turns to mush.

Love this recipe! It is exactly what my step-mother made throughout my childhood, something I could smell as I was stepping off of the school bus in the afternoons. This recipe is a hit with my family, especially my youngest who LOVES pasta dishes and will critique each pasta dish I make. I have started the tradition of making it every Halloween in the crock pot and calling it "Ghoulash," an extra special treat of using Halloween shaped Wacky Mac. :) Thank you for this recipe, it is creating memories with me.

This is a great recipe that my whole family loves. The only change I made was to use ground Italian sausage instead of beef and to sprinkle some cheese on just before serving! Yummy

Just 2 of us so I cut the recipe in half.  So glad I did, as there was plenty for us to have lunch the next day.  I used Fire Roasted Tomatoes with Garlic because that's all I had.  Different from the goulash I was raised on but will definately make again.  This is a keeper!!

This was my first time making Goulash, and it turned out amazing. I took the advice of other reviews and added two medium bell peppers. I also added a bag of corn. I was worried about it coming out too watery for my households taste so I reduced the water to two cups, which was perfect for us! Will definitely make again. This did make a huge amount and we've been giving leftovers away, will definitely cut the recipe in half next time.

Good, will add more vegetables next time so I don't have to serve them on the side.  As well, used less tomato sauce and water.  Truly not a goulash but an excellent ground beef stew.  : )

Ok, so in my opinion, a good START for a goulash, but tasted too much like spaghetti.  It was my first time making it, so I followed the recipe ALMOST exactly.  It didn't seem right to me to put in soy sauce, so i put in (the same amt of )worchestershire sauce instead, and that was perfect! It needs much less Italian seasoning (I cut it back and still think it needs less... or possibly NONE). The oregano and basil in the I.S. is what makes it taste like spaghetti.  Finally, my husband thought it needed more diced tomatoes!

To Babs2574 - Yes, this can be frozen. Make sure the batch has completely cooled by using a ice bath method.  Put the goulash in a deep pan, like a pressure cooker, and fill up the sink with cold water. Put ice in the water to cool faster. You must stir the goulash frequently to get it to cool in the middle of the pan. Date and freeze in freezer proof containers or freezer bags. Just remember to only cook the macaroni about halfway thru, or it will be mushy, as the 2nd cooking will finish it.

the family loved this.  It had more 'spunk' than spaghetti.  The noodle soaked up a lot of the 'juice' so I did add an extra can of tomato sauce and I reduced the onion to 1 (personal preference) but this was a definite keeper.  The recipe makes TONS and would be great for a potluck.  I added a diced zucchini - worked well!

Pretty good and easy to make. I added some black pepper when I was eating it but will probably add it while cooking next time. I think I will add bell pepper too next time.

The good thing about cooler weather, we can get back to the good comfort food. Made this a few days ago, and it was a big hit at the supper table. I didn't have any soy sauce, so I subbed worcestershire. We like spicey. I added about 1/2t each of chili powder and paprika, also the can of tomatoes had jalapenos in it. Great meal. Thank you pathunt.

My husband loves this and instead of the tomato sauce I use a can of tomato soup and cut the amount of salt.  I do a stove top version and spoon the sauce over the cooked pasta.

This recipe was a hit with my family.  My husband said that this goulash was so yummy compared to the yucky stuff that his mom used to make when he grew up.  I thought this dish was very flavorful, and also very easy to make.  I will definitely make this recipe again!

Yum! I thought this would be ok. I made it mainly because it was something different, and I have the stuff on hand. I used ground chicken, tomatoes from my garden, extra can tom juice since I used fresh tomatoes, and liquid aminos in place of soy sauce, because that is what I had. 5 two year old's ATE IT UP! I had 3 servings...surprisingly sooo good. Will make it again!

Good comfort food and so easy.  I halved the recipe, and traded worcestshire sauce for soy sauce and added a green pepper.  My husband loved it.  Topped it with cheese and served sourdough toast with it.  Thanks for an easy meal!

Yes, this recipe should be titled "Classic American Goulash".  As an American Hungarian, I love both!  Yes, they are completely different but don't get stuck on the title.  This is a great recipe for children..Soccer parents, you'll be glad the slow cooker recipe is added to this.  I lived off of this and Hungarian Goulash growing up and playing soccer.  It kept me fuelled up!

An American variant on a British version of a French adaptation of a German/Czech/Austrian imitation of Hungarian gulyas. To be fair, one of the meanings of the word "gulyas" (the basis of goulash and goulasch) is "mixture" or "assemblage", so there's a kind of logic there.  So Hungarian it's not, but it's a pretty tasty meal in its own right and easy to prepare. It *does* need some bell pepper.

Goulash in this sense means "a mishmash of ingredients that aren't normally found in the same pot."  It's classic in the sense that so many of us ate this growing up in the 60's.  My Grandma called this Spanish Macaroni and I'm sure it was something that she got out of the newspaper at some point back in the day before Allrecipes.com!  I remember that I loved it and I think that she made it alot.  I haven't had any though since I was a kid.  My aunts will be tickled that I've found a recipe because we've always wondered about how she made it.  And Grandma was a West Virginia country girl!

This is the best recipe I've made in a long time! The only change I made from the way it was written was substituting ground turkey for ground beef.  I will definitely be making this again!

This is very good. It is good the first time and even better the second day. I have made a version of this for years. When I was a kid (eons ago) we called this Spaghetti Red and seasoned it with chili powder. On the rare occasion when I visit my sister 1,000 miles away, she still makes that as a "welcome home" meal. I never thought about using soy sauce. It works! Thanks for the recipe.

This is just like my mom always made.  She often added peas and green pepper.  I was so happy to see this recipe.  We love it. I can make it low salt fro my husband by omitting the soy sauce and using tomato sauce with no salt.

Tastes just like my grandma made in Michigan!  I follow pretty closely but, like others suggested, sub Worchestershire sauce for soy sauce.  Also, I don't add any extra water.  It comes out more of a cassarole texture/thickness than a soup/stew as in the picture.  But that is how my family likes it!

This is what we called American Chop Suey, except we didn't add soy sauce.  Great skillet meal! I usually add salt & pepper and maybe a little crushed red pepper flakes.  I also sometimes add chopped bell pepper.  We always top with grated parmesan. Great comfort food!

An easy comfort food for the family nights, only thing I did different was use fresh herbs and added one green bell pepper. Topped with Mozzarella cheese and served with garlic bread.

This is a great recipe, but for a normal sized family, I would recommend halving it.  I did not have any italian seasoning, so I used part of a packet of italian dressing mix, and it worked great.  Be careful when you add the salt because the soy sauce and seasoned salt may make it unnecessary.  This is a great recipe for my picky eaters.  I can add cheese on top when I serve it for those who want it, but it is milk free for my little guy that is allergic.  Thanks for posting!

Make this recipe exactly as indicated, NO changes.  Recipe states it serves 8, will actually just barely serve 6 only.  Very simple for a firehouse lunch.

This was pretty good, but not awesome. Definitely too much italian seasoning. I made it exactly like the recipe calls for and it just seemed a bit heavy-handed. I tried it with and without parmesan on top and I definitely prefer it with. This recipe did make a ton and was considerably inexpensive to prepare considering how many servings you get out of it. It's something I may make again, but not for a while.

This is my second review, tonight I remade this favorite fall recipe using Johnsonville sausage instead of ground beef, it was out of this world, it took the flavor of this dish to a whole other level!

This is a great comfort meal to make any night of the week.  I usually add in some mushrooms and serve with garlic bread sticks.

I made this vegan by using 1 1/2 cups dry French lentils which I cooked and drained & then added to the sauteed onions and garlic. I left out the soy sauce and only used 1 bay leaf.  I used small shell pasta instead of elbows. I love it! Total comfort food!

Great recipe! Had the sudden craving for something simple and tasty and this hit the spot.  Decided to make this last minute so I cooked the noodles separately and omitted the water. After the sauce simmered I drained my cooked noodles and mixed them in with the sauce.  It was a huge hit with my husband who had never had goulash before.

Added green pepper and cut back on the water a bit. Although there was a lot of seasoning, it was missing a certain flavor. Very nice overall. Would make again.

So good!  Definitely use Worcestershire sauce instead of soy.  Also, if you can find tomatoes with garlic and basil, you can cut down on the dried seasonings.  Italian seasoning blend has rosemary in it, which isn't all that appealing to me dry or in Goulash.  I also added some paprika to the browned beef, a must in goulash.

This was wonderful! Its just my husband and I so I halfed the recipe and still had enough for 2 meals. I used basil/oregano/garlic diced tomatos instead of plain ones.  It was good - but we call it hotdish since we are from MN. :)

my husband always makes the goulash at my house. He said he never wants his recipe again that I should make this recipe. I cut the recipe in half and their was barely anything left. This is a fast and easy recipe.

Macaroni spaghetti?  That's what it tasted like.  I cut all the ingredients in half.  The Italian seasoning and bay leaves were too strong.  I used large elbow pasta, but should have used more than stated.  Maybe w/ more pasta and less seasoning, my husband would like it, but as is it's just okay.

This was not only easy, but DELICIOUS!  I used the leanest ground beef I could find, which let me cut out the draining step.  Also let me sauté the garlic and onions in the first step!  I used one can of Italian-style tomatoes and one can with onions and peppers.  All in all a great go to after a busy day.  This one is a keeper!

This was a great recipe and like many of the other reviewers have stated, it is just like I remember from my childhood in Minnesota. I added about a teaspoon of Tabasco to mine and it was wonderful.

Made last night. This type of recipe just gets better with age. I loaded it up with paprika and used a ground beef, lamb and veal mix. Served with toasted Italian bread to soak up the gravy. Feel free to experiment--regardless of what others have said, there is no wrong way to make this type of dish. And a sprinkle of freshly grated cheese is so comforting!

I love goulash and before the recipe never came up with anything that I really liked.  This was GOOD!!!  I just followed the recipe except I added some ater as it appeared to be getting dry and it was just delicious.  I'm not one to write reviews, but this was sooooo good.

This is good just different. My mid western family never had "Italian seasoning" or "soy sauce" available years ago, we used a similar recipe but added green bell pepper, salt, pepper, and a can of corn with juice for flavor. It was farm food and didn't taste Italian at all. It might be plain but thats how we ate back in the 40's.

Simple, hardy, and tasty.

I grew up on this type of goulash, and enjoyed this very much.  Reminds me of moms cooking.

LOVED this!  Super easy, just like my Grandma used to make.  Perfect American Goulash, not European, so if you are looking for that search for a different recipe.  Will put this into my favorites list.  Thank you Pathunt!

I didn't have a dutch oven so I just followed the directions using a skillet to brown and just poured all ingredients minus macaroni to simmer for a bit in a saucepan. I used soy sauce as per the orig recipe. Made macaroni at the end and just poured the 'sauce' on top... delicious!! Almost exactly what i had as a child growing up in the Midwest. Thanks!!

I lost my original goulash recipe years ago and when I saw this it looked like the one I had used when our kids were young. This is delicious. I made it exactly as written but added a tablespoon of Slap Your Mama seasoning to spice it up a bit. Dinner tonight is going to be a real treat!

yes this is Paula Deans recipe it just omits her seasoning salt and ground turkey however this recipe was the only one I could find that resembled goulash as I know it I made only small changes to this for my liking only the recipe stands well on its own I omitted the water because I didn't want it too soupy in texture I used crushed tomatoes instead of diced because thats what I had, I added green peppers and used worcestershire sauce in place of the soy sauce  because I find soy sauce to be too salty I also cooked the noodles separately and added the cooked noodles to the goulash so I could control the level of sogginess or rather to avoid the sogginess. however this recipe was what I was looking for this is how I know goulash to be so it worked out great for me reminded me of my mothers  and my grandmothers recipes except with a touch more flavor.

We weren't a big fan of the seasoning in this, but I give it 4 stars for being a good base recipe and the fact that it is a one pot dish; I love that you don't have to cook the macaroni separate.  I think I'll try switching to a taco flavor next time and see how it goes.

This is really good, and just Mom use to make. My picky 11yr old even liked it.  The only thing I did different was, I only used 1 can of diced tomatoes and instead of soy sauce I used Worchestershire sauce.  I served it with  sweet yellow cornbread, delicious.... Will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing.

We are not Hungarian. This is exactly what I remember as the Goulash my Mom made when I was a little girl.  I have looked every where to find a recipe that was not Hungarian .  Thank You soooo much.  It is perfect!

Was hungry for goulash and this recipe hit the spot.  I added a can of green beans for a vegetable.  This recipe was easy and tasty.

This is a good recipe, easily changed to taste.  I added chopped (large pieces) green bell pepper, because that's the way my mom made it.

this is a good midwestern style goulash. Not Hungarlan style this is more of a hamburger helper tomato macaroni dish. My husband really liked this for lunch. I cut this down to 2 servings. I did add a little more macaroni though as the bag was nearly empty anyway so I added another 1/3 c of elbow mac. I used a store brand Italian seasoned diced tomatoes, Del Fuerte mexican tomato sauce, and half the onion called for.  I thought the soy sauce was going to taste odd, but I couldn't even tell it was there. This was a nice easy dish to put together, used things I normally have on hand, and my husband really liked this a lot so it's a winner! Thanks for sharing, I'll fix it again. Soo much better than Hamburger Helper and just as easy.

This is very good! I made it just as posted with the exception of using 1.5 tsp of salt and 1.5 tsp of garlic & herb seasoning since I did not have seasoned salt. Will definitely make again!

I just made this and it is the best goulash I've had. my girlfriend, who normally hates goulash, texted me and said she loves this dish. I made it 2 days ago and she's been eating it every meal. I highly recommend it. I made a slight change. I was out of diced tomatoes, so I chopped up some tomatoes and out in a can (drained) of sweet corn. I don't think it impacted the flavor much or at all.

I made a vegetarian version using crumble. Did not have tomato sauce so used spaghetti sauce and a can of diced tomatoes (chipotle style). Really good!  I served this with a dollop of sour cream.

Great, easy dinner made with ingredients we already had at home. I added a splash of Worcestershire and some garlic powder but I'm not sure either of those made a difference (meaning, I think it would've been great as is). Husband loved it. This one will be added to our regular dinner menu for sure. Thank you for sharing!

This is well splendid. I didn’t have quite 2 lbs of hamburger so I added almost a pint of chopped up mushrooms and a green pepper to it. Followed the suggestion of others and only used one onion though I wished I had used 2. No matter but next time I will. I did use Italian diced tomatoes, cooked the noodles separate then added them, left out the bay leaves as I had none, and used Worcester sauce instead of soy. It was runny when I added the noodles but after sitting they absorbed plenty of juice. As leftovers it wasn’t dry at all. One suggestion add lots of pepper and top with Parmesan cheese. Couldn’t figure out what it was missing till leftovers and bam. That was it. I’ll make this over and over. Thank you.

Great recipe. I used half ground beef and half bulk pork sausage. I also added some multi-colored sweet peppers and spices. The cook time once the pasta is put in was way too much. The recipe called for about 25 minutes (or until the pasta is tender). I did 20 minutes and it was too long.

This was great.  I did make changes to accommodate what I had on hand, but tried to make it close.  I also used some water, and some tomato juice, as someone suggested.
I added a can of cream of red pepper soup I already had, similar to what another person suggested.
All in all, we loved it, and it was easy.  I'd always boiled macaroni separately, so loved that change.

Yes I will use recipe again cutting back on Italian seasoning to 1 T. , am't used in recipe totally overpowered the flavor.  I added green peppers.  Cooked macaroni in separate pot then added to other ingredients at the end.

Big hit with the family. Made it twice now.
The most important change I made was using Rotel instead of diced tomatoes. And still I added some chili powder. We like spicy.
Also added frozen spinach to make it healthier. Next time I'll use an entire 32 ounce bag of spinach if making the full recipe (big recipe). Worcestershire instead of soy sauce, as many have recommended. Used ground venison instead of beef, can't tell the difference in a dish like this one.
Very happy to add this to my dinner options.

Whatever you call this it  is a very good recipe. I used the same ingredients but in different order. I always fry the onions and garlic first very lightly for a few minutes then add the meat and the tomatoes and flavourings as per recipe. However it is very flexible and you can add more or less soy sauce for example.

This has become a new family favorite! It has a wonderful flavor. I'm going to try it with ground turkey to see if we can make it a bit healthier since I have a feeling we'll be making this a lot.

Just used Italian seasoning, salt & pepper to our taste. Left out tomato paste too. Added extra water.

I cooked this in our multi-cooker. 30 minutes was too long & macaroni was cooked too long & mushy. That was my fault.

I was skeptical...thought it would end up like some hamburger helper type thing but  it was quite good.  I used Worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce and added chopped green peppers.  I would make this again.  I think it's a good stick to the ribs winter dish.

Super easy to make and my family and I love it.  We have done variations from time to time (adding veggies or beef broth in place of water) but ultimately this is the easiest recipe I have found.   We make it a few times a month.

My kids loved it!  I made it with tofu, which didn't thrill the boys, who are big athletes (made it for their sister, who is vegan), but, overall, it was a hit.

Used Penne pasta instead of mac. Out of sauce so used puree with a little extra water. Yum!!! Glad I used Penne as it holds up better for leftovers.  A couple of days later I placed it in a greased 8x8 baking dish and topped with shredded mozzarella cheese. Didn't need to heat big oven.  Baked in counter oven about 30 mins.  Yippee! No leftovers complaints. The addition of parmesan garlic Italian Bread didn't hurt.

I made this dish using bow tie pasta and NO soy sauce as we're currently watching our sodium intake. My husband said it was delicious and enjoyed the leftovers for lunch later in the week. A great comfort food meal!

This was quite good. I used tomato soup instead of tomato sauce, which I don’t think made a difference. Like all casseroles it was even better the next day.

It was OK but I did add some Paprika to better approximate my idea of Hungarian Goulash.  Biggest complaint or warning to others:  DO NOT OVERCOOK.   Once the pasta is done, serve it or take it off the heat.   If you continue cooking, the pasta becomes mush.

I made this with ground turkey and mushrooms. It was really quite good just not 5 star good. I definitely like the simplicity of the recipe. We had it with a nice loaf of roasted garlic bread.

This was very good and will make again. We are only two people so I cut it in half and still had plenty left to freeze. The only thing I would do different is not cook the macaroni for 20 mins. I think it was a little too much for our taste

Very good, except, I think I will cook pasta separate next time, so that it won’t have as much starch in it...

I've made something similar to this all my life.  I saw this recipe and was intrigued by it since all I ever did was do a clean-up in the refrigerator and added ground beef.  WARNING:  The recipe calls for a Dutch Oven.  Let me tell you that is a really important piece of information.  I always used a deep skillet when I made my previous recipe.  With this recipe that just wouldn't have worked.  All that said, this was such a "hit" there were hardly any leftovers for lunch the next day.  Maybe next time I'll use a little less Italian Seasoning and will not use Large Elbow Macaroni ( the smaller would make it more visually appealing).  I had never used Soy Sauce in my recipe.  Added good depth.  The killer thing here was the hamburger was on sale (Nolan Ryan 85/15 - 3.99 lb), the Tomato Sauce and Diced Tomatoes cost .59 a can (Kroger Brand).  I had onions.  I had garlic.  All in I may have spent $15.00 for a meal that tasted great, was a great value, was a new take on what I considered a favorite.  I'll add mushrooms next time I make it.

I've been looking for that old fashioned taste that my husband and I remember from our youth. This was pretty close to what we both remember. Super easy to make. I think the grand kids might like this one when they come over. This also might be a good meal train recipe.

Easy to make. I only used  two Tablespoon of Italian seasoning but it was was still to strong for me I would use  less tomato sauce too. We all have a different palate. With a bit of tweaking it will be great. I give 3&1/2 stars.

Yep. Growing up my mother called this "Meat Mac and Tomato" but it is simple and delicious. Cheese of any kind on top. And when you get sick of eating it, make chili and use it as a topping for this as well. Delicious.

Very tasty.  My mom has been making goulash for us kids ever since I can remember.  She is now 67.  It was nice to make her a dinner that she really enjoyed and can totally relate too.  Sitting at the same table, my son thinks I am the master chef.  Thank you.

Was awesome but my husband made it and put spaghetti sauce in it, he subsidtuted beef bone broth for the water.  It would have been much better if he did not add the sauce which made it taste like spaghetti.  Still awesome but next time I will make it!

The only thing I did to change this recipe was to add chopped green peppers when cooking the onions because my husband loves them.  I decided to make the sauce the night before and put it back on the stove the next day to cook the noodles.  I think tomato sauces taste better the next day after the flavors have time to marry.  I did take out the bay leaves before I put it in the fridge.  I used fire roasted diced tomatoes for more flavor too.  My husband said it's a keeper so I know it's great!!

I mixed it up a little.  Added some Worcestershire sauce, olive oil and a half cup of large elbow noodles.  Oh and a dash of garlic salt and pepper.  Otherwise just like the recipe and it was exactly what I wanted on this cold Winter day in Southern Wisconsin.

The best part about American Goulash is, you can add or subtract anything you want.  Sometimes I add a lot of veggies other times I make it like this recipe.

I absolutely loved this recipe! And, yes, it reminded me of the goulash my mom made years ago. I did make one change though. I didn't have a can of regular diced tomatoes, so I used Rotel Fire Roasted tomatoes. It added a little spicy heat.  I will definitely make this again and again after that. It was perfect on a cold winter day and so easy to make. Thank you so much for the childhood memories to warm my heart and pure yumminess to fill my belly!

I thought it was very good!  And for those of you who get hung up on the word "goulash", it just means a stew with meat and vegetables.  Hungarian Goulash is a specific type, general made with paprika, but the word goulash is just a generic term for this type of dish.

To give it a little “kick”, I used a can of Ro-tel tomatoes. I also put it in casserole dish, topped it with shredded cheese and browned under broiler for a minute. Boys loved it.

Been making a version of this for the last 44 years and looking at this I think I will try it. I would suggest cutting some kielbasa or Italian sausage into bite size pieces and frying it with the hamburg it will surprise you.

This is not goulash, it's Chili Mac
Goulash is made with chicken, ground beef , bell peppers and onions, mix vegetables, sausages and tomato sauce.

I make it all the time. I use milk instead of water. And I also put cheddar, and parmesan,and small amount of Velveeta. I bake it for 30 min. Just until the cheeses melt.. Anita.

This looks exactly what my dad would have made and called goulash although he would have added canned corn and beer. It was never the best meal but there was always plenty to go around.

It was really good! I'm no cook, and even I could make it. A lot of people said it was soupy, but it wasn't for me. It's a lot of good food for cheap and I'm definitely going to be making it again.

I ended up tweaking this a bit because my family doesn't really eat beef. We used Ground chicken the first time we made this, and then ground Italian pork sausage the second time (the sausage is our favorite and we make it with that protein every time now). We also added mushrooms and spinach. And cheese, we are a cheese loving family. This is a meal that I make regularly because it's fast, inexpensive, and tastes even better the next day!!

I made it almost as written. I only had one can of tomato sauce, so I used it plus a can of tomato soup. Also left out the bay leaves. It tasted great without those. Big hit with the husband and will make this again.

I followed recipe for the most part, I use bell peppers but it was lacking something so I added 1 cube bouillon and some sugar. We are carb lovers than meat eater so next time I will add a bit more noodles and give more cooked ground beef to my pup before I add the rest of ingredients. This is my very first American goulash. Loved it!

I rarely measure seasonings when I’m cooking but I used all the ingredients and I think it’s delicious. My husband says it smells good but not sure how everyone (kids) will like it with the tomato pieces.

Loved it! I used tomatoes we canned this summer (with it’s juice, and cut down the 3 cups of  broth.  I also used beef broth instead of chicken broth.) very moist and flavorful! Will make again for sure!

Very good. For those not familiar with goulash (I was not), it's basically a thinner spaghetti sauce. I added less water, left it thicker, and cooked and kept the pasta separate, combining the two at serving time.

Looks tasty but it's not Goulash. Goulash (Gulyás) is a Hungarian dish made by sheepherders (Gulya = herd of sheep). Calling it Classic Goulash and then it showing up as the first thing in Google search is (can't believe I'm using this phrase) cultural appropriation. I don't care that you're used to calling it in the US. Give it another name, it's not Goulash. If I made a bacon sandwich and called it a Classic Taco, I'm sure Mexican people would (rightfully) take issue with that.

I made it with 1/4 cup less water, removed the bay leaves midway through the simmering and added 2 cups of cheddar cheese in the final 10 mins of simmering. Also I served on a bed of mash potatoes as that's how I grew up eating it. My picky 7 year old loved it and this was enough for 6 people easily!

This is by far my favorite goulash recipe! I do add an extra cup of elbow macaroni and I leave out the bay leaves cause they have an aftertaste we don't like but other than that this is the same recipe that I use and it's the best, we love it out our house!

I love me some classic goulash. For flavor, I used the garlic cloves, a teaspoon of chilli powder, a few beef broth cubes, and salt to taste. I added less water and a stalk of celery with one medium size white onion. I also tossed in a bit of corn for added color and flavor. Also, I used stewed tomatoes, not diced kind. It was wonderful.

I haven't even tasted it yet but I know its incredible. Did something different once it was done and put half in a baking dish and added cheddar cheese then put the rest on top followed by more cheddar.

My husband said it was “better than my mama’s”- very rare praise indeed from that mama’s boy! I did add 2 Tbs of Worcestershire sauce and diced a bell pepper that I needed to use, since some of the reviews mentioned those additions. I’m not a fan of this type of dish normally, but even I went back for a second bowl!

This is an awesome recipe. I made this gluten free as well by adding Barilla GF noodles of my choice. I just don’t cook it quite as long as it says to.... check my noodles for doneness. It reheats well and the taste is great. GF noodles tend to fall apart the second time around but still an amazing recipe.

I always half this recipe because it’s just me and my husband and it always turns out perfect. I only cook the macaroni for 20 minutes and it comes out perfect - 25 minutes and it gets a bit mushy. I love love love this recipe!! It’s just like my mom made when I was younger.

I used Worcestershire sauce  instead of soy sauce, a whole can of diced tomatoes, onion powder, garlic powder and minced garlic, the rest of the ingredients as well as some sugar to take the “bite” out of the tomatoes.
We both have enjoyed this and will make it again.

I followed the recipe as shown. It made a lot of goulash so next time I will 1/2 the recipe. It was good but needs a little kick like some red chilli flakes. It just needs something to make it pop!

I only added one can of tomatoes and I used one yellow onion.  I Basically cut the recipe in half for two people.  I also added 1 1/2 cups of cheddar cheese at the end and let it melt.  It was good and I will make it again.  It is very similar to the recipe my mom made.

Having no regular tomatoes on hand I used stewed tomatoes. I also omitted the soy sauce b/c I had browned the ground beef w/ green pepper.  I also topped it with cheddar cheese. It was ok but I'll definitely make it again using the ingredients listed in this recipe.

We LOVED this recipe!!! Coming from New England, we call this American Chop Suey. The only minor tweek that I made was adding a chopped bell pepper and additional garlic. This will be something that we will be enjoying from now on.

I have to admit I had never had goulash and thought it was too basic to be that good--not only was this fast, easy, and made in one dish, but it was absolutely delicious!

Quick and easy to make in a pressure cooker.  I added jalapenos... because I like it spicy.  It's better the next day.

This recipe is exactly what I was looking for. I am from Minnesota and this is exactly what I remember growing up on. Instead of soy sauce we used worchestire sauce and added in cheese and corn. Thanks for sharing!

I prepared this exactly as the recipe called except I cut it in half.  it came out delicious!  I was actually surprised that it came out so good. Not because it wasn’t an excellent recipe but because I am not that great of a cook  It’s what I was expecting. thank you very much for the recipe.

Yes, we reduced the recipe to half, added 1 can of corn. Then we layered it in a casserole dish with monzerella cheese. Baked at 350 til cheese is melted.

I gave it a 3 star so as not affect the average.  My comment is in regard to "the most positive review" which is just wrong.  It does matter what you call it - I'm looking for an authentic classic goulash recipe.  Not a "classic" recipe that has soy sauce in it and no paprika.

Shame on Allrecipes for elevating this review to most positive apparently to create additional clicks.

The name matters, want to call it mom’s goulash casserole or American goulash that’s fine.  Stop wasting internet users time with a phony name designed to generate clicks of disappointed Allrecipes users.

I halved the recipe  and it wasn't enough for 4 people so next time I would definitely make the whole amount.  Only change I made was I used worchestershire sauce because I didn't have any soy sauce.  This recipe is a keeper.

This was great! Only thing I did differently was add more meat, maybe a 1/2 pound. It wasn’t soupy at all like someone commented, using the measurements for everything else as written. It’s not my Mom’s goulash but she took that recipe to heaven with her and this will be my go-to until I figure hers out! We topped some bowls with cheese and some with butter (like Mom’s) and both were delicious!

I feel like i can’t really rate this since I changed it, but how can you go wrong with a goulash recipe. I only had one pound of ground turkey so I used that and subbed carrots and celery. Even my friend’s picky toddler liked it.

Easy to make, a good one pot meal. I halved the recipe and it still made plenty. The first time I made it I followed the recipe. It was very good but the second time I added more garlic and about two tablespoons of Hungarian sweet paprika. Perfection! Everyone had seconds.

Classic midwestern recipe. We  made  a bit different.  No bay leaf and no soy sauce. Used  worsteshire and oregano instead. Less  onion and salt too. Some green pepper is good. Many cook macaroni separate, if so leave water out of sauce is for noodles.  This makes a BIG pot so cut in half for less people.

Loved it but will cook the noodles separately as they were to soft for our liking simmering for 25 minutes. Overall it had great flavor and an easy dish to prepare. I am making it again tonight.  :)

I tried this as directed and there is too much Italian seasoning in it.  It overpowers everything.  It tastes good but it’s strong.  I’d recommend cutting that in half or omitting altogether.  Otherwise I’ll make it again.

Really good recipe. Like others, a tad too much Italian seasoning and would double the noodles to reduce remaining liquid. Will make this again.

Very good.  I used special Italian pasta and Worcestershire instead of soy sauce and like to add a little ketchup for the zing.  I grew up in Iowa and this was one of my Mom's favorites.  I live in Texas now and don't see much goulash here.  They don't know what they're missing!

I followed the recipe very closely except that I added one chopped green pepper with the onions.  In my opinion the two table spoons of Italian seasoning was  too much.  I will reduce to 1 1/2 tablespoons next time.  The recipe was easy to make and the directions clear and simple.

I found this to be a touch salty, as well the bay leaf and Italian season came through a touch overbearing.  I will make some minor adjustments and try it a few more times to dial in.  If making this a first time I would almost suggest to cut the salt, bay leaf and Italian season in half and add more if needed.

I've made this a few times and we love it!  This recipe is truly a good one.  I do use 1/2 of the seasoning salt because we are sensitive to it.  I also chopped up a green bell pepper and added to it, because that is how I grew up having the dish.  It's good with or without.  :)

I made it just as the recipe said, I thought it was very good. I like that you didn't have to cook the pasta separate, so it's only 1 pan.

Being an overaged recently divorced man I was looking for a simple hardy meal I remembered from childhood. This one fit the bill! 

The only changes I made was adding a can of strained corn and a can of strained peas. Basically because I had them and it added volume to the pot.

It turned out great and I'll make it again. Next time I won't use peas.

This was really good and my family loved it a lot. I will definitely make it again as it is perfect cold winter comfort food. I followed other reviews and added worchestershire sauce instead of soy sauce and I sautéed green pepper and mushrooms along with the onion. I also sprinkled fresh Parmesan on top for added flavor. I only gave it 4 stars because there is something missing that I will have to play around with when I make it again. Also, only add a little water at a time as 3 cups is way too much.

When I was a kid my daycare provider would always make goulash for lunch, so I was excited to try making it myself for the first time! The only changes I made was using Werchestershire sauce instead of the soy sauce and gluten free elbow macaroni for my dietary needs, but I thought it was great! The only change I will make next tine is a little less of the salt as I thought it was a tad salty.

This is a great basic recipe. I used one can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes and one can of regular; added a diced green pepper with the onion; added 2 tsps. of Beef Better Than Boullion; added a small can of diced green peppers and a few dashes of black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, and celery salt. I also used the whole 8 oz. box of Banza Chickpea Pasta for the elbow macaroni. My Chinese-American husband, who’s never had goulash before, liked it - success!

I made this with gluten free pasta (cook it separately and add it before you serve). I also only added one onion, corn,a little beef bouillon and ketchup for sweetness.

I followed this recipe exactly, and found that it was too acidic and tomato-y for my family. My husband and son agreed. I will cut down the canned tomatoes and sauce by half, next time.

Bland; needs oomph.  Good base - just spice it up a bit.  Used crushed toms instead of tom sauce and canned tomatoes.  Had no macaroni so used noodles - worked fine.

At his is a good basic recipe. Can add whatever you want it will be good. No leftovers in our house. Made as written, with the exception of: used gluten free noodles, and added one can of  El Pato hot tomato sauce.

Way too salty for my taste. Is it a misprint? Otherwise cut more than 50% of salt. Or onky add at the end, to taste.

Really good. I added 1/4 cup cream and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese at the end to thicken the sauce and make it creamy.   I forgot to cook the meat and sauce for 20 minutes and added the water and pasta right away. Came out fine.

This was even tastier the "day after".  I offered it for packed lunches and everyone agreed.  Simmering blends flavor as one well knows.  Many spinoffs can be created - depending on what one has in the frig, treating almost as chili with toppings.  I would make again and even ahead for a busy day or evening.

So yummy! Reminds me of when I was a kid. Will make this again, probably will add Worcestershire instead of soy sauce next time. Didn't add bay leaves since I didn't have any, also I used a 28oz can of stewed tomatoes and a 28 oz can of pureed tomatoes since it was all I had in the pantry; but it was still good!

Hi, I’ve made mine using slightly different ingredients. Cooking times were seemingly accurate and helpful especially timing the pasta.  Instead of water (which was reduced to 2cups) I used vegetable broth. Shallots rather than garlic. For meat, a mix of ground beef, veal and chicken.  Also , like others, I’ve substituted Worcester sauce for soy sauce. This was well received by my family with some New York sharp cheddar cheese on top, and fresh yeasty rolls with butter.

I was going to give 2 stars because it was very bland as is.   I added more seasonings to the leftovers and it was edible the next day.  I won't make this again.

Very good and hardy.  All the ingredients my Mom used to put in hers.  Still a family favorite and economical.  I cooked the macaroni separately, I like to get the ratios right.  Nothing worse than too much of something.  And I skipped the soy sauce and added Worcestershire sauce instead.  I make a lot and freeze half.

This recipe is a keeper. I got home a bit late tonight so I cheated by cutting the cook time in half and it was still great. Somehow missed getting diced toms at the store, but luckily I had crushed tomatoes so I threw those in, which made the sauce smooth and less chunky.  Salad and crusty bread completed the meal.

I would back off the soy sauce as it seemed to come through at the end. I would do the same recipe next time minus soy sauce and use stewed tomatoes in place of this mix. Personal preference but no soy sauce.

I have made this countless times. Growing up in the 60"s and 70's this was a frequent dish for the 8 of us. Of course sometimes we used rice and called it Spanish rice! I use basically the goulash recipe to make stuffed pepper soup, adding green peppers. Any of these recipes is great for using up leftover veggies, mushrooms etc!

The recipe is absolutely perfect as written. Serve with your favorite bread loaf. The people saying it’s too runny need to let it keep cooking until you get the desired consistency. Too bay leafy? Lol. I love it and suggest it.

This is one of the Midwest’s iconic family meals. Maybe even beyond the Midwest. Everyone has they’re own version of what makes it right for them. I only use tomatoes in the form of sauce, no chunks for me. I know it’s weird for all of you, I like some tomato flavor yet I don’t care for tomatoes. So there! In my recipe I use the tomato sauce, a big squirt of catsup and instead of water I use beef bullion. No soy. Same recipe, my taste. So to the submitter of this iconic recipe...thank you for sharing??

Yummers.  But suggestions: No bay leaf needed. Replace Italian seasonings with just fresh basil (dried fine) or both combos. Also, add zucchini (scored NOT diced) I love that added. Also, add cayenne pepper, gives it zest.

Really good dish. After reading reviews i only changed two things. I added 2 bay leaves and green pepper.  I found it pretty soupy so took the lid off the last 5 minutes of cooking and let stand for a bit before serving. It was pefect and had really great flavor. The family said add to rotation. Thanks for the recipe

This takes me back to my childhood and school lunches made by home cooks. I edited the recipe to my flavor profile but the basics are the same. My husband and I love it for a filling, inexpensive comfort meal. I’m looking forward to making this for dinner tonight. Yum!

I Followed the Recipe with some Changes.  I used purple onios,along with 1/2 Red Bell Pepper, table Spoon Garlic Minced, Chicken Broth vs Water,and 1 can Corn.  As far as cooking it in a Dutch Oven,---- It's up to the top. It's going to Boil over I Know !!!! But it Was Fantastic !!!  All My Neighbors Loved It !!!

It is great. Only two changes: I reduced the volume of ingredients because it's just the two of us;  and I discovered we were out of soy sauce, so I substituted Worcestershire sauce.

Love this dish! Instead of water I used beef broth. Instead of diced tomatoes I used Rotel original (diced tomatoes and green chilies) Added a 1/4 cup red wine and two tablespoons Worcestershire sauce no soy sauce. Amazing!

Oh my gosh - this hit the spot!  Homey, savory and filling!  Dipped into the reviews and made a couple of minor tweaks - substituted a TB of worcestershire for one of the TBs of soy sauce and added 1/2 chopped green pepper and 1 stalk of chopped celery.  I also used closer to 3 cups of uncooked elbows and I couldn't have been more pleased with the result!

My husband, 3 kids & I love this recipe! Reminds me of what my Mom would make when I was little. ?? I tend to get big onions and thought 2 would be a bit much so I cut that back to 1, otherwise I make the recipe as is! Enjoy!

If you have had goulash before, I would suggest putting 1 tbsp of soy sauce into this dish.  I think it added good flavor, but I put the full amount in and could definitely taste it. Other than that it's amazing:)

This is a great easy and basic recipe. It’s s something I can throw together with pantry items when I don’t plan ahead. I halve the recipe for just two of us. I have also made this with a twist. I prefer using a packet of taco seasoning in place of the soy sauce, Italian seasoning, and bay leaves. I use Rotel tomatoes with chiles and then also bulk it up with a can of black beans. It’s good for leftovers also.

This is a favorite in my household. I cut the recipe in half though because it's only two of us. This is super easy to make, tastes delish, and many of the ingredients are pantry staples.  Makes the house smell great too :)

Great comfort food. I kind of forgot about this great dish.  2-3 Tbsp of ketchup adds the zing some people said seems lacking.  I put canned corn in my own serving bowls, as hubby hates corn.  I cook the pasta separately - that way you can control the texture, and you can put the leftovers in the fridge or freezer and just make new noodles as needed. I add more vegetables - the great thing about this recipe is that you can add in more veg to both extend it and make it more nutritious. Green beans, chopped zucchini, cannellini beans - all make it even better.

I did not make any changes except using only one can of the diced tomatoes and green chilles. As I do not care for diced tomatoes. My kids have been begging for me to make goulash.

Very good!  Plenty of flavor with just the right amount of spice.  I skipped the bay leaves and added a little more Italian seasoning.

Thanks for the reminder of a great recipe! I halved this recipe as it was just two of us, and we have plenty for lunches this week. I didn’t drain the tomatoes, and used one and a half cup water, it was a little too watery towards the end so I took the lid off the pot and simmered uncovered a few minutes. Perfect! Didn’t have soy sauce, so I used Worcestershire, otherwise made exactly as written. Love that I didn’t have to boil macaroni in a separate pot.

This was too good. Everyone loved it. Only thing I changed was I used Cavatappi pasta instead. And once served, added a little sharp cheddar on top.

Big hit! Like others I added bell pepper.  To decrease the sodium I used one can of no salt added tomato sauce, and one can of no salt added diced tomatoes.  I also used 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire and tablespoon of soy sauce.

I make this recipe at least a couple of times per month.  It reminds me of  a goulash from my childhood - but even better.  This has an excellent rich flavor and it reheats wonderfully.  I make it for a dinner and then take the leftovers to work for lunch.  Be aware that as written, this recipe makes an enormous amount of food.  I usually halve it.  It is a recipe that you can easily add ingredients to if you wish.  I like to add green bell pepper.   And it is delicious with warm dinner rolls or buttered toast.  I do find that there are a lot of folks who don't like the texture of diced tomatoes.  So I usually pulse the tomatoes a few times in the blender before I put them in so that the tomato chunks are broken into smaller pieces.   With both soy sauce and seasoned salt, it is quite salty.  I'd recommend starting with 1/2 the salt and then add more to taste.

I googled goulash recipes to find out how much potatoes they suggest per person. Imagine my surprise when I haven't even found potatoes in the recipe. 
As a Hungarian person (I suppose we're talking about the traditional Hungarian goulash here) this recipe took me very much by  surprise. I strongly  believe that besides the meat, onions, water and salt everything is wrong about this recipe. It is probably tasty though, but far away from being the classical goulash.

Great Goulash recipe!  Per a previous suggestion I made this with Worchestershire Sauce and added a green pepper.  I also used ground mild Italian Sausage instead of hamburger.

This was pretty good, will make again. I did make a couple of changes:  no way was I going to use soy sauce in this, felt that would have been wrong. I used Worcestershire sauce. For a half recipe (almost always halve recipes, there are only two of us, and we don't eat much) I used two tablespoons. Next time I will cut that down to one tablespoon. I also used a celery stalk, diced. And sautéed the onion, garlic and celery in a tiny bit of pot, then added to the browned ground beef. Also did half water, half beef broth. Very good

This dish reminded me of my Mom’s goulash. I have made this multiple times and it goes each time. Recipe is good as is. When I make it now I add celery, green bell pepper, and I use Worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce.

The Italian seasoning was a bit overpowering, will probably reduce that to 1T and toss in a bell pepper next time too.

Added 1/2 of a green pepper and a stalk of celery. Also a  tsp of black pepper.  This is the perfect base recipe!   Everyone just ignore the Dutch oven and make it in your normal cookware

Loved this! I used one pound of beef and one pound of ground turkey. I didn't have Italian seasoning, so I subbed some garlic & herb Mrs. Dash. I also added half a bag of frozen corn during the last phase of cooking (when the noodles went in) because I remember my Mom's goulash having corn.
I had a little trouble keeping enough liquid in it. I had to add liquid 4 or 5 times. It might have been the cavatappi noodles since they are bigger than regular elbow macaroni.
Overall great recipe I will make again and again!

4). Added veggies: red & yellow bell peppers,  Zucchini

I loved this recipe. I have never used dry macaroni. It worked great. Because of my age and health problems. I need to eat vegetables and fiber. I made half a recipe. While the hamburger was cooking. I cooked 5 thinly diced carrots, a bell pepper and finely diced celery. After draining the beef I added the vegetables and continued the recipe. I added a half pound of frozen corn at the end. I added more liquid to make it a little soupy.  I know it is not Authentic. It tasted great. I got all my fiber and froze half in single servings containers.

This was so disappointing. Yes, I should have been able to tell from the ingredients, but it bothered me that it wasn't authentic at all. It just tasted like (Italian) spaghetti with meat sauce and in no way resembled Hungarian goulash. It did not taste bad – the family enjoyed it – so if you don't care about actually having authentic goulash, then you might love it. But it wasn't at all what I was looking for.

This recipe is SO easy, and wonderful to freeze! This is the best goulash...my 3 kids love it, and it's very economical for company. Serve with a crusty white bread. I have only made it over the stove in a very large pot, and I quadruple the recipe to make a lot. I like to add tomato paste and also some beef broth for added flavor. I look forward to trying this in a crock pot!

This was a hit with the family, and exactly what I grew up eating. My family ate the left overs the next day, so I know it was good.  Thanks for sharing this goulash recipe. I will make it again.

I made this last night. The family really liked it.  Instead of soy I used worstershire, that was the only thing I changed.  However, in the future I will cook the noodles separately.  The noodles were cooked perfectly when we were eating it, but they got all mushy because they were still cooking .  There is a ton left over and unfortunately its not very good because of this reason.  Next time I will just pour the goulash over the noodles in each bowl.

This is a 1 pot meal!!!  Yeah!!!  This recipe is the best we have ever had!!!!  I also add 1 lg. green pepper, chopped.  In place of 1 lb. of lean ground beef, I add 1 lb. of mild or hot Italian sausage..  It also HAS TO BE, Lawry's salt seasoning!!  I also use my own canned tomatoes that are preserved with citrus and not salt.  You might want to use a little less Lawrys at first to see if it's enough for your taste.  There is salt sometimes in the meat ( unless you get it from a butcher)or the sauce and tomatoes, unless you use the Hunt's no salt cans of each one.  You can freeze this too!

I halved the recipe but otherwise followed it exactly.  Even the picky 10-year old had two bowls.  It wasn't overly seasoned, but good comfort food for a snowy night.  It makes a LOT, and I'm sure will be even better as leftovers tomorrow.

I made this in my Instant Pot and it was very good. I left the ingredients the same except for using red onion. The cooking portion I did differently of course. I threw all the ingredients into my Instant Pot except for the macaroni. I did not cook the ground beef. Throw it is there raw. Then mix it all together until it is blended well. The liquid in it will make the ground beef break apart into nice little pieces. Pop the lid on the pressure cooker and set it on the meat/stew setting for 40 minutes. When it is finished cooking leave it on the warm setting. Mix in the macaroni and put the lid back on. After letting it set for about 10 minutes mix it up and check the pasta for doneness. If it isn't to your liking give it another 5 minutes with the lid on. It should be done after that. If not give it another 5 minutes until it is to your liking.

My kids hated this. There was too much salt and the italian herbs didn't do anything except get stuck in my teeth. I would try again but leave out the italian herbs and salt seasoning. I would use slight less water 2 1/2 cups and see if that worked better. A little too soupy for my taste.

5 Stars  -  the way I make it.  Omit the Bay leaves, reduce the ground beef by 50% and make it up with Hot Italian Sausage.  Now you have a goulash to die for.

I always read reviews before making a new recipe. For one I may not have everything on hand and the other, I like to here what people would do different.  So...I thought I had soy sauce but didn’t...so someone said they used Worcestershire sauce instead...and I only used one bayleaf...because I do think 3 would be too much for our taste.  My noodles cooked quicker than 25...about 18...and I took it off the stove in hopes the pasta would absorb some of the liquid...all that said, we liked it! It reminded me of pasta fagoli like you get at Olive Garden minus the carrots, celery, and beans! Can’t wait to have leftovers tomorrow

Wherever you live I cannot imagine a Goulash without the addition of Paprika.
I made this recipe as it stood, tasted it, then added lots of black pepper and Pikant Paprika, to my own taste.  Much better.

I've never made goulash before, nor have I ever eaten it.  My husband has been begging me to make it for years.  I made this tonight and he said it is his new favorite recipe.  He asked me to have it on hand at all times available for him to eat.  I followed the recipe exactly.

My husband put this together hoping to replicate the ghoulish I used to make for the family when the kids were growing up. My recipe included beef broth, green pepper, red pepper flakes, basil, parsley, tomato juice and frozen corn. This recipe was tasty and a great one pot recipe but not  what we were expecting.

Solid performer. Simple ingredients most people will have these items in stock.  Overall  4 out of 5. Deviated from onion and garlic for my family, but  good taste.

Coming from Buffalo NY, I grew up on this version. I used meatloaf mix (Beef, Veal and Pork) instead. I added 1 celery stalk and green pepper to taste. I also added a dusting of Paprika and Turmeric along with fresh Basil, Thyme and tomatoes all from my garden. Tomato sauce was homemade. No bay leaf.

great flavor. Next time I will substitute Worcestershire for the soy. I thought it was going to be a little to soupy so I added a 1/2 cup more elbows and it turned out perfect. Will definitely make again.

this is a great base recipe that can be changed or added to so thank you for posting and reminding me of a great fall/winter dinner... I used 2 cans italian stewed tomatoes 1/2 can tomato paste and 1 cup tomato juice because that's what I had on hand... added more spices and simmered sauce for 30 minutes.. I like things spicy so added a bit of cayenne pepper and pepper flakes to my bowl and topped with fresh graded romano... delish!!

I specifically got on Allrecipes to find a Goulash recipe. I friend has been talking about her mom making goulash this weekend. So its been stuck in my head. After looking at several recipes I decided to go with this one. So glad I did. Love this stuff. I always believe in following a recipe as is the first time. I did that except I didn't have enough bay leaves. I only had 1 bay leaf and a 1/2 leaf in my jar.  I used what I had. :( If you are looking for a quick meal for a fall evening this might be a perfect fit. Kids and adults give it 5 stars.

I originally printed this off and started making it for my family back in 2014. I make this often and plan on making it again tonight. I have tweaked it slightly by adding a few things over the years and my family and I love this dish. I have taken it for a few pot luck outings and never have any leftover. Everyone keeps asked me for my recipe. Thank you pathunt for posting your original recipe it was the start to one of my best comfort food dishes. It reminds me of my Grandma's German cooking.

Family can't eat onions so those are eliminated. I used beef stock instead of water. Used Worcestershire sauce instead of the soy sauce. Grandkids not fond of visible tomatoes so used one can of mild tomatoes with green chilies and one can of tomato paste. Used a little Sriracha sauce for some additional flavor. Hubby loves Ranch style beans with corn mixed together so added that to the base recipe. Would love to have added bell peppers, but again grandkids don't like anything with color so left those out.  Hoping grandkids like it as much as I do. Loved it.

Had a bag of store bought meatballs thawed out.   Cut each one in half and used it for this recipe.  Used worcheshire instead of soy sauce;  used a large can of crushed tomatoes and used beef broth instead of water.  Also added a package of frozen corn.  Threw all of the recipe ingredients in the crock pot and cooked on high for 3 hours.  Just like Mom used to make and so fast and easy.  Everyone in the family gobbled it up.

Felt it was a bit salty.  If I make this again, I will leave out the season salt and probably the soy sauce (or cut down on it).  Other than that it was okay.  Definitely will have to make a few changes to it.

I followed the recipe, except I substituted the 3 T of soy sauce with 4 T of Worcestershire and mixed in a dollop of sour cream to each serving. Came out so good! Will definately make it again and again. Even my picky son had two helpings!

Almost the goulash we grew up on. I didn't care for the Italian seasoning and did add green pepper instead of onion because someone here is better without onion. Very yummy comfort food!

BEST. GOULASH. EVER!  Followed the recipe except for a few substitutes (because I didn't want to run to the store..)  I cooked my pasta separately because I add salt to the water, then cook them al dente.  Oh, and I snuck in some chopped green peppers., and a splash or two of cayenne pepper for heat.  THIS is my favorite recipe, thanks for sharing!  If I could give it more stars for easy, fast and simple, I would.

I have made this many times and absolutely love it!  It is just like the goulash I grew up with.  I do half everything except for the noodles.  I also sub the soy sauce for worcestershire sauce... I don't know if it makes that much of a difference, personal preference I would say.  It really comes out perfect.  There are only 2 1/2 of us eating, so the amount is just right for us to get 2 full dinners out of it.    Bottom line....LOVE this recipe!!!  Thank you :)

I followed the recipe as it is but cut it in half since it's only 3 of us in my household. It was delicious I did top it off with some cheddar cheese. I love how it's a one pot dinner. Makes for easy clean up.  Will definitely be making this again and again!

This is a good recipe as is, but we like it with a little heat, so we used Rotel diced tomatoes with green chilies, and added green peppers as well.  There was nothing left on anyone's plate.

This is rubbish. Not 'classic' or anything like it. Goulash is hungarian not American or Idahoan or any other stupid false place claim. Morons. People who call things by names they are not should be banned and corrected. I wouldn't make this fake muck ! Wake up sheeple

This is a terrific base recipe for the goulash many of us remember as kids.  So easy to add/omit/change ingredients for your personal taste and what you have on hand.  I made this two nights ago with just a few changes to make it more like what my Mom used to make, served with warm, home baked crusty bread.  The Mr. loved it as much as I did and Mom enjoyed some the next day for lunch.  Thanks for sharing this easy, quick, inexpensive recipe, we will be enjoying it many times.

I halved the recipe but not the garlic and gave it 4 stars. Per commenters, I used Worcestershire, not soy, (I don't think soy would be good in this recipe), added 1 tsp sugar, did not use bay leaves, used oregano and cooked the macaroni in the same pot and my noodles were just fine, just slightly more than al dente and reheating the next day, the macaroni was still fine. I haven't had goulash since I was young and my father made it, in Michigan. I'm pretty sure he used ketchup though, which I wouldn't dare.

I didn't have a can of tomato sauce but had a can of pizza sauce.  Used that instead and left out the italian  seasoning and it was great.  The seasoning was already incorporated in to the sauce and was ready to eat in less than an hour.

Very easy to make and the family loved it.  This will definitely be a recipe that I make again.  Other recipes called for bell pepper also, and since I had one on hand that needed to be used soon, I put it in. I also only used half the amount of season salt.

This makes a lot! But its delicious. I found diced tomatoes with Italian spices already mixed in. Also, I didn't have an Italian spice mix so I used oregano, rosemary, and thyme. I will make this again since it was really simple to make!

The first time I made this recipe, I made it as written and it was very good and got a lot of praise from my extended family who were over for dinner. As is it is an easy 4 star recipe.  The next time I made it I substituted Worcestershire sauce for the soy sauce and I liked that a bit better, but that's just my personal taste.

The semantics of whether this is actually goulash or not notwithstanding, this is a good recipe and it makes a lot of food!

I used fresh basil, oregano, and tarragon. I added 3/4 cup of pizza  sauce only because it needed to be eaten. I added one can of corn drained. I will definitely make this again!

I doubled up on the pasta and then some...As it seemed more like soup with just 2 cups of pasta.  Family enjoyed it.  Will probably make again.  I also didn’t like 1 tablespoon of salt.  I usually do half that.  Once I did full amount and too much, but I prefer no salt added in my foods.

To simplify things and to get to eating quicker, I omitted the water and the first simmering.  I used 1 quart stewed (chopped) tomatoes and 1 pint of tomato sauce and 1 16 oz package of Italian  Cavatappi pasta, it's similar to elbow, but just more of a hearty pasta. I simmered this for 20 min, this turned out perfect, not soupy, not dry.

I loved making this. When I told my mom I was trying it out she was excited. I remember my mom making it for my brother and I when we were younger. 
I pretty much followed the recipe and after asking my mom if she would I added celery and because I had some peppers on hand I added those too. Why not. 
I only put in 1 jar of sauce ( that's all I needed)  and I read another review that added Worcestershire sauce  so because I didn't have soy sauce I added some of that. Its a great recipe to keep simple or add a few extra touches. And it's easy on the wallet.
It was a big hit with the family!!

This was great!  I had never made goulash before and so when my fiance asked if I had ever made it I wanted to try.  This was a super easy recipe; I did make a few changes however.  I used V8 juice instead of water and only about 1/2 tbsp of seasoned salt.  I also added mushrooms and green peppers.  I will making this again.!

This has become one of my most requested recipes. I prepare exactly as submitted. Total comfort food & being able to toss pasta in dry is a big plus. Use good quality ingredients , bay leaves are a must.

This is awesome. But I did make a few changes.
1. I added green pepper( one large)
2. Instead of soy sauce I used 3 teaspoons of Worchester sauce and not the 3 tablespoons that it calls for.
3. 3 teaspoons of dried Italian seasoning and not the 3 tablespoons it called for
4. Minced garlic in the jar and I used 2 teaspoons
5. This taste just like what I had as a kid in the early 70's

My husband and I have never had American goulash before. I am from Canada and our goulash has 3 ingredients: cooked elbow noodles, ground beef and tomato soup.  I love the Canadian version it because it is a comfort food, but my husband is not a fan. So when I saw this recipe I was excited (he was not). I made it exactly as written and have to say, we both thought it was better than expected. It was the perfect cold night comfort food.

This is a very easy recipe, but next time I'd leave out the soy sauce as it pretty much took over the dish.

Also, I'd cook the macaroni separately then add at the end. Cooking it all together made it quite starchy.

OMGoodness this is good! I remember my mom would actually serve it to guests. If you're not aware, this style of ghoulash is a classic cheap American comfort food. I've never seen it on an American style restaurant or diner menu, ever. Those of us who have a parent, grand parent, or great grand parent who was affected by the Great Depression (1920s) is probably very familiar with this dish. Whether you like it or not comes down to your Italian seasoning. Make sure you use a spice blend you like.

I will make this again! Used meatloaf mix (beef, pork, veal) for some of the meat portion. Used quick-cook spiral pasta (what I had available) and meal was ready a little faster. The only soy sauce I had on hand was the thicker sweet soy sauce but I think that actually helped cut some of the potential acidity from the tomato sauce. Haven't had goulash for years and this was much better than I remembered!

I used two of the smaller cans of tomato sauce instead of the big ones and it was just fine. I also used 1 pound of ground beef and one pkg of chorizo sausage so it had a kick. Easy to do, turned out great & the family loved it. Better than my mom's recipe I grew up with (sorry, Mom!).

I have made goulash similar to this for years, but this is better.  Differences were:  soy sauce, bay leaf, seasoned salt, and a longer cooking time.  I made a smaller batch, so used half of everything, except the bay leaf.  I only used one bay leaf.  Much more flavorful than my old recipe, and I'll make it this way from now on.

Very good and easy. I subbed Worchestershire for the soy sauce and eliminated the bay leaves. Next time I might add a little more water and more pasta - it was pretty heavy on the beef. Flavor wise though it was amazing. Yes, it's soupy but that's what goulash is - more of a stew than a pasta dish.  It was not the same goulash I grew up with but still tasty. Highly recommend and will definitely make again.

My first time making goulash was a success due to this recipe. I added a green pepper, substituted 1 cup of V8 for one of the cups of water, and used a little beef bouillon as other reviewers suggested. My father in law loves goulash, and said mine was excellent. Thanks for a great recipe!

Great started recipe for goulash. I don't like it when people rate a recipe then list a dozen ways that they changed it (thus not an equal rating), but alas, that is what I am doing. Regardless, based on the recipe as presented, I'd give it 3-4 stars, but I do think it calls for far too much Italian seasoning (1-1.5 T would be plenty). I read plenty of the reviews and made several of the recommended changes. I added bell pepper, celery (though I could have done without it) and celery salt.  I cooked the pasta separately, used only one bay leaf and one can of tomato sauce, and used a soy sauce/Worchestershire combo. Adults and kids alike enjoyed this hearty stew.

Halved this for me and hubby.  Left out soy sauce, bay leaves and Italian seasonings.  It was good but it could be better.  Soy sauce and bay leaves don't belong in goulash. I grew up eating my dad's.  It was awesome.  This needs something.  Used only a tsp salt.  Did the slow cooker method and a whole box of noodles, elbow.  Added another can of sauce since I had halved it and then went noodle crazy. Lol

This is perfect for kids. Not too spicy. I halved the recipe and it still makes a big pot! I didn't add the water because I like my "goulash" to not be soupy. I also added some bell pepper and some beans. I would have added corn but didn't have any. I only used 1 bay leaf. I cook the pasta separately.  I like to make this and divide up into freezer bags so I always have something home cooked for when the grandkids come over. They love it and will eat big bowls of it. This is the goulash from my childhood. Thank You for the recipe!

Delicious! I used Worcestershire instead of soy sauce, and halved the recipe. Cooked iit inmy pressure cooker ( instant pot) for 20 minutes after browning the beef) and added the uncooked elbow macaroni and cooked it an additional 5 minutes under pressure. It was perfect!

We all loved this! I did cook the noodles separately so my sauce would not be too watery. I cut back on the Italian seasons to 2 tsp. I also cut back on the salt. I think it was about 1 tsp of kosher salt, but I mainly did it to taste. Thanks for the recipe. Will make again!

This was delicious, but I would recommend leaving out or cutting the Italian seasoning in half. It was waaaaaayyyy too much. Other than that, I loved the recipe and its addition of soy sauce and seasoned salt!

This is classic American Goulash... I grew up on it in the south... even schools served it for lunch.  The great thing about goulash is you can add or subtract to your taste.  We also usually add corn, green pepper and Worcestershire  Sauce instead of soy sauce.  I have also added mushrooms because my kids love them.  I have a friend who also adds fresh squash and zucchini to hers during the season.

I used Worcester sauce and made my own seasoning salt with salt, celery seeds, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder. With the addition of more garlic cloves, ketchup, green and red bell peppers, I had a winner.  I added the noodles long before the recipe called for to assure them to be done.  Afterwards, I sprinkled cheddar cheese and added a dollop of sour cream on top! Served this with cornbread and a salad.  I am from Tennessee so goulash was not what we called this deliciousness.  We just called it food.

I hadn't had goulash in years, and happened on this recipe. I figured that I'd give it a shot, and it was an instant winner in my house. I've made it several times since, and I'm sure I'll make it again.

Just made this for lunch/dinner for my family. I have to say, it is delicious! I will add this to my family's favorite. I only made one adjustment and that was, adding two cans of sweet corn (drained from liquid).... you can't bet a simple, delicious and CHEAP meal !!

My mom made this growing up back in the seventies and I remember it well. Today, I still make it for my wife and I and love having leftovers which is even better the next day. Now I will be making enough for about fifty people and will use half ground beef and half ground turkey. This is an awesome dish as you can add things you like and omit things you don't like. I will also be adding green beans to mine, just like my mom did.

I made half recipe and it turned out great! I used almost two cups of noodles because I like lots of noodles. I did need extra sauce and a smidge of worchester though. I used worchester sauce instead of soy as mentioned by others as I prefer the taste better. Some Parmesan on top and viola!

Cut the recipe in half and was more than enough for two. Did add small can of corn and teaspoon of beef bouillon. Also have to watch sodium so added worchestshire instead of soy. Perfect for this snowy day.

Super easy to make, super fast and it's not too bad, you could probably not use so much bacon if you are not a bacon lovers

Just okay.  Followed the recipe exactly. I thought it had too much meat in it and was kind of plain.  I've had much better than this and will not use this recipe again.

I followed the recipe as written. Was a little to much salt for our taste. If I make it again will leave off the bay leaf. It actually seemed like it was better the next day.

Don't change a darn thing! Just make sure you use an actual "dutch oven". Made the mistake of using something smaller and had a tad mess on my hands - was still delicious!

I cut the recipe in half since I am cooking for one (me), and followed the recipe.  It was delicious.  I don't think it needs any changes at all.  Going to go warm up the leftovers now. :)

If making in a slow cooker do not preheat because adding cold water to hot stoneware could cause it to crack. Add all the ingredients and then set to high, might have to cook an extra 30 minutes or until elbows are al dente.

This recipe is almost the exact recipe my mother and grandmother made, both raised in the midwest, and Was told that it was a depression era recipe.  The difference in the one I make, is to saute the elbows in oil until brown before cooking them which adds a nutty flavor, also a few chopped green peppers, and and a cup of frozen or fresh corn.  Use celery salt instead of salt for the health conscience.

After growing up in a small German community in North Dakota I have a serious fondness for comfort food. And this basic recipe definitely fit the bill giving me some comfort on a snowy night. I added about a tablespoon and a half of good paprika and used chicken and vegetable broth instead of water. Yumm, will make this again.

I cut the recipe in half, but still used 2 cups macoroni. I still made a huge batch.  Next time I will leave out the soy sauce and bay leaf, and use half the Italian seasoning.  I had to add brown sugar to hide the soy s flavor. I also used the 3 cups water, or what ever it called for.

very good.  Always had it as a kid and never knew how to make it. When I tried to wing it I must never have added any water! It's really good. I used one can of Rotel instead of diced tomatoes, but only because I was out.  It was very good, just a little spicy!

I love finding and doing a different goloush every time I make it. Trying to find one my family loves. And this one did just that!! Even my picky fiancé loved it. Had no idea the soy sauce was on it but agreed it has to be key ingredient giving that much flavor! Only thing different I did was one yellow onion and one red onion.

This is the recipe that my mom and aunts always made and they grew up farm girls.  I was amazed to see how similar it is! Like mom, sometimes I toss about 2 cups of fresh mushrooms in when browning the onions and garlic. Simply delicious!

My husband wanted goulash--something I haven't made in a very, very long time, so I turned to Allrecipes for help. This recipe worked. I did make some changes, though, by adding  a  couple teaspoons of smoked paprika and  kosher salt in place of seasoned salt.

Thank you Pat Hunt! I remembered loving this as a child when Gram, from Iowa, lived with us and made it. By the time I'd started a family, she was gone. I'd moved to the east coast & no one I asked had heard of any but the Hungarian version. I made it tonight and all 7 of us loved it, especially my 9 month old grandson! I followed the recipe with 1 exception. We love garlic so I doubled that. I also added a green pepper as Gram used to do. I made 12 servings because I remember it being better the next day. This is a "new" old favorite for us. Thanks for the gift of sharing a childhood favorite with my family!

This was pretty good. We are used to a bit more flavor and seasonong. So next time we make it we will probably add more meat, maybe even italian sausage, some hot sauce or cayenne, things of that nature. It was simple to make though and a great base.

It may be good and tasty, however you definitely cannot call it goulash, let alone an ORIGINAL one. There's nothing in this dish from goulash, you should try not to deceive others, who're not aware of the details and really try to make the REAL thing.

Tasted great but noodles were overdone with recommended time so I'd start checking them earlier next time.  It also makes enough to feed a crowd so I'd cut in half next time.  We have a family of 4 and it lasted for plenty of leftovers, plus I sent a big bowl over to a friend's house for her family.

Loved it - it's a keeper!!! 
I did a a bit of sugar( 1-2 t) to offset the acidity of the tomatoes. 
I browned the lean beef In 1/3cup water
Used gluten free pasta. 
It was very good!

Hubby loved it! He's not easy to please and I'm always nervous to try new recipes. Only change, I was out of tomato sauce so in it's place I used V8 juice. It's been my saving grace before and was again this time!

Would make it again. I added some tomato paste and two small cans of v8 because it's what I had on hand and I like goulash soupy. Family loved it too.

I use medium salsa instead of diced tomatoes and it gives it so much flavor. I've never added soy sauce or salt and it still tastes great.

I was fooled by the title "classic", thinking that HAD to mean Hungarian, but I should have known once I looked at the ingredients. Anyway, I made it and everyone loved it! Tasty, filling, and easy to make. It reminds me of a dish my Mom used to make, but I don't remember her calling it Goulash. 

I really wanted to make Hungarian goulash, so I'll have to go back to my search, but this was fun anyway. Maybe PatHunt can change the title to somethin like "Classic American Goulash"? Just a suggestion; it would clear up any confusion. Thanks though, cheers!

Over all this was a good meal. My wife is not a big fan of diced tomatoes, and it tasted a little to much like a spaghetti to me. We both agreed that we will be cooking it again.

This was amazing ! I didn't have bay leaf or intalian herb seasoning or garlic. I used 2 1/2 cups of water added basil, chili powder, paprika, garlic powder, oregano, pepper, and added 2 chicken bouillon cubes and used worchister sauce instead of soy sauce. Definitely going to make again. :)

I added a green bell pepper to my goulash. This recipe was simple and tasted fantastic. Not only did the adults enjoy it, but our 3 and 5 year olds had seconds! This was surprising considering the pepper and onions! But they (and we) loved it!

Tastes great.  I used 1 tbsp of soy sauce and added 1 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce.  It was still a bit salty.   Next time I will reduce the amount of seasoned salt to 1/2 tbsp.  Thank you for the recipe.

I cut the recipe to half.  The only thing I was not crazy about was the italian seasoning. I would cut it back more as it has a strong taste. I did not add the seasoned salt. I used a red pepper as opposed to green as my mom did.  I can add salt to taste after. Once you add it you cannot delete it. So it is more controllable. Mom always  added a bit of sugar to it. I added some fresh parm cheese to it. As I am writing this I did add a teaspoon of sugar, that did it. Along with fresh bread it is very tasty . Easy  to make definitely reminds me of when mom made it. This will be great as a left over.

Turned out pretty good though next time I won't use as much Italian seasoning. It was over powering of everything else. I did however make these alterations: 
•1 a yellow onion not two 
•1 green pepper
•1 cup beef stock and 1 cup of water  (3 cups of water is too much).
•No additional salt (soy sauce and beef stock provides enough)
•1/4 to 1/3 cup of sugar to balance the acidity of the tomatoes
•2 tablespoons course black pepper

Only used 1lb if ground beef, 16 oz of tomato sauce, omitted the water, cooked the noodles separate in beef broth, added green pepper and omitted the bay leaves.  Went over well

I wish I had seen this recipe years ago!  My boys would have loved it!  I was looking for a substitute for the "helper" in a box and stumbled across this recipe.  I halved it since it's just my husband and I now, and I used chicken broth instead of water.  It came out just right!  I served it with cornbread.  Excellent!

Made it exactly as the recipe states and it was so so.  I'm German/Hungarian and this was nothing like my grandmothers.  It tasted more like an Italian version, which meant it was like a typical pasta and meat sauce dish.  I may try some of the variations in others reviews, but for now this one is not in our favorites list.

Good basic goulash recipe. I added a tblspn of paprika and used cajun seasoning instead of seasoning salt. The whole family loved it. Served with baguette of French bread.Froze leftovers.

I grew up on this dish, and never knew until adulthood that there was a "real" Hungarian Goulash.  Both dishes now live in my repertoire.  This version is a very easy to make, but tasty dish. 

My wife and daughter are both vegetarians, so I often make this with meatless "crumbles" meat substitute.  It works perfectly, and both of them love this recipe.  My daughter resisted trying it the first time I made it, but immediately loved it and now jumps up and down when she hears I'm going to make it.

This is a great, and easy recipe that I've used many times now.  I increased the amount of beef to make it meatier.  Next time I'll try the chicken broth in place of the water.

We all liked this.  I didn't drain my tomatoes, and used all "no salt added" tomato products.  I skimped on the seasoned salt anyway.  It was fine.  Lots of liquid, so I ended up using twice as many noodles as called for, and it was still on the runny side.  The noodles did not cook as quickly as I would have desired, so next time I make this, I will either cut back the liquid and cook the noodles separate, or make sure we have some french bread to soak up the juice.  I also added some frozen corn in at the end to add some color.  Might consider adding green pepper next time (I like, family doesn't).
ETA--used drained juice from tomatoes as part of the 3 cups of water, and dumped an entire box of elbow noodles in (about 4.5 cups).  I added noodles at boiling time, then lowered temp to simmer, and it was not runny at all after 25 minutes.

This is a great comfort meal.  I made it according to the recipe and  it was good.  Next time I will make the following changes:  Use half the amount of noodles and I would add 1 tea. of cinnamon plus I too, use Worchestershire sauce instead of soy sauce.

Made exactly as written (used Glen Muir organic tomato sauce and diced tomatoes).   Did not really care for it... the taste was a little "off" (possibly the soy sauce).  And it was a too salty.  Will not make again.

This goulash (as I know it) is a versatile, one pot dish that comes together very easily. Perfect comfort food! I did use Worcestershire sauce instead of soy, 2 cups of beef broth to replace the water, and drained a quart jar of Roma tomatoes that I had preserved with Italian seasoning (so I left out the Italian seasoning). Will freeze the leftovers for hungry college kids who come home on winter break (if husband doesn't eat it first:)

I love this dish. It's really easy and delicious. I use a pound of ground beef and add a couple diced zucchini while I'm sautéing the meat and onions. And then some parm on top when I serve it. Yummy!

This was delicious! I've always loved goulash but actually don't cook it often enough! I didn't have tomato sauce on hand so I decided to use one large can of Campbell's Tomato Soup! (Had to add extra season salt to taste due to sweetness of soup.) I also used a can of Rotel Tomatoes with green chillies. Cooked as directed with spices and then added a couple handfuls of shredded cheese at the end! Mmmmmmm so good! Made homemade herb bread, corn, and fruit jello salad to go along with this! Family wasn't to hungry due to a late lunch but they ended up going back for seconds anyways haha! ;)

Wonderful recipe!! I used 1 cup gluten free pasta, beef broth in place of water, rosemary, and a dash of a-1 steak sauce. Then I added a dollop of plain Greek yogurt into individual servings..my 4 yr old even ate it! That's saying something!

I have made this recipe before in the past and I would recommend adding another cup of noodles and cooking them separate from the dish and then adding together right before serving.

I made the slow cooker version, and put all of the ingredients in a slow cooker on high for 6 hours. I then cooked the macaroni and added that last, along with sharp cheddar. I also used 4 cans of diced tomatoes (undrained) and no cans of tomato sauce. I only used 1 bay leaf and 1 tablespoon of soy sauce.

I made this recipe exactly as written, I would give it a 2 star rating as is.  The second day I added more macaroni, Hungarian  paprika, and colby/cheddar cheese.  With the extra additives it gave it more consistency and flavor.  I would make this again.

Great, easy, inexpensive dinner to fill up the family. Make it as-is the first time, then you can add your own tweaks. I replace two of the three cups of water with Spicy V-8, then add beef broth as needed to get the consistency and the pasta right. I find the called for seasoned salt to be a little too much, i put in about a third, and then to taste after the pasta is cooked.

Very good! I don't get you folks that change a recipe completely and then rate it low! Makes no sense. Also, for the comments that this isn't hungarian, it doesn't even say that in title, it says classic.

Really good recipe!  I loved my mother's goulash as a kid, and this comes close!  I've made it a number of times and always use a crockpot.  My kids complained it was too soupy.  So I cut the amount of water in half.  That got better reviews.  I typically make it in the crockpot.  I learned that 2 hours on high gets the job done!

I made this for dinner tonight. I did add some corn to the recipe. This is definitely going to be a dish I cook again. The next time I prepare this I will reduce the ingredients in half. We have way too much left over. I will freeze the majority of the left overs and hopefully this dish will be just as good the second time around.

Made this for hubby, as it is one of his childhood memories.  It is delicious just as written with one exception, which is the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars.  For my taste, there needs to be the addition of a scant tablespoon of sugar to cut the bite of so much  tomato.  It is a minor detail, but makes a big difference.   I sometimes use Italian sausage in combination with the hamburger, add a few chopped bell pepper, or use whole wheat pasta instead of regular.  Great Recipe!

Goulash was my dads favorite dinner growing up. I decided to bring him a batch for his birthday. To be honest I didn't think I would like it but after tasting it the goulash almost didn't make it to his house because everyone in my family loved it so much :) I am excited to add another go to recipe to my list.

Easy, quick and really tasty! The only change I made was to add a little bell pepper with the onion. I This is a great dish to pack up and take to work for lunch along with a piece of crusty bread.  I will be making this again.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was a great quick fix and plain old comfort food from my childhood. Previous reviewers are correct in that it isn't traditional goulash, but who cares? I couldn't bring myself to use so much Italian seasoning or soy sauce. In the end I used equal amts of Worcestershire sauce and only 1 tbs of seasoning. It turned out wonderful. Also only 2 bayleaves, I didn't want that flavor to overwhelm the dish. I would definitely check in 10 to 15 on the noodles, 25 minutes is way to long. It was a great recipe, will make again.

I made this for my family of 4 last nigh with only a few changes:  added a 10 oz can of cream of mushroom soup, cooked macaroni separately and was added last,  only added about 1 1/4 cups water.  My husband and boys ate this up with only one serving left.  Will def. add this to rotation and at least increase recipe amounts by 1/3.  Thanks for the recipe .

Great recipe. Did change it a bit. Used only 2 bay leaves and 1 table spoon of Italian seasoning and added half a block of sharp cheddar cheese and melted it into it once the pasta was done.

I agree that it was pretty soupy...next time I will cut the water back to only 2 cups.  I also added a chopped green pepper to this.  It never occurred to me to use worchestershire instead of soy sauce, what a good idea.

I made this according to the directions and it was very good.  I'd planned on using Worcestershire sauce instead of soy and forgot. I was expecting an odd flavor but didn't experience that in the least. I'll make this again.

This was great! Tastes just like my Gma used to make. I did add some garlic powder & diced gr pepper. Next time I make this, I won't cook the pasta in the sauce. It made the noodles a slimy texture. Other than that, made the house smell great, makes A LOT, and is pretty filling.

Add 2 chopped bell peppers.  Subtract 1 cup water so it will fit in my favorite non-stick pan.  We liked it better than the original 5 star recipe.  The flavor seemed richer.

I am one of the thousands Linda M. mentioned who grew up eating this and yes, we all called it goulash.  My Aunt Jennie used to make it for us kids whenever we stayed at her house and we all loved it.  She's gone now, but I think of her every time I make it.  The only thing I change is substituting worchestershire for the soy sauce.  Just my preference.   Good food and good memories.

I change a few things based on reviews, I use 1/2 onion, 1 garlic glove, 2 cups beef broth 1 cup water, Worcestershire instead of Soy , I add frozen corn, a 1 can of beans( whatever we have, navy , pinto, kidney) and a sprinkle of sugar ( maybe 1 or 2 teaspoons). After I add the macaroni I boil for 10 min and cut off the heat, turns out perfect this way.

My  husband loves goulash and this is always my go to recipe. I prefer to use  Worchestershire  sauce instead of soy. Sometimes I use beef or chicken broth in the place of water if I have it on hand if not I add a couple beef bouillon cubes to the water. If you cook you macaroni in the goulash you will need to keep a check on it  so it doesn't stick , adding more water if needed and keeping it stirred. I do not use seasoning salt,  just regular table salt and add a dash of garlic powder.

I use 1.25 pounds ground beef, worstershire instead of soy, 1/2 seasoning salt, add bell peppers of any color, 2 banana peppers,, and a beef boullion cube.  Only cook the pasta 10 minutes or so. Delish!

A little bland, but I will make this again and add a few more spices. I simmered covered, and then simmered uncovered which thickened it up. Also added corn.

This is pretty spot on for what us Northerners do...My grandma and Aunt made this and though I don't recall her recipe, its pretty close. For those that say its not hungarian...sorry not familiar with that, but this is your typical hotdish/goulash up North.

Not the typical goulash that I was looking for. My family and I did not care for it at all! :-( I was very disappointed, but maybe I am just used to a different kind of goulash.

Fantastic.    Thank you for the recipe.   It's a keeper.   I doctored it with a few stalks of celery before and a green pepper.   And then added a generous squirt of Sriracha before adding the macaroni.   Thanks again

I did not have any of the Italian seasoning, so made it without.  It is delicious.  It reminds me of what my Mom made when I was still living at home.  We love it.  I do sprinkle a bit of shredded cheddar cheese over the top of it.  I love AllRecipes.com.  Thank you.

I have made many versions of goulash...especially in the last year. I made this recipe exactly to the letter. I have always shied away from adding the soy sauce because it just didn't resonate with me but this time I took the plunge and so glad I did. This is the best goulash recipe I have made to date and I will certainly make it again. I add a little shredded cheddar to the top when I serve it and oh my it's delicious! Thanks for a great recipe!

I doctored it up a bit, rendered some Linguica with the hamburger and deglazed with red wine, used chicken stock instead of water. Otherwise stuck to the recipe.  It came out fantastic!

Reminded me of the goulash my mom made growing up in MN. Residing in CA, the most hot-dish averse state I've ever seen, for the last 18 years has only strengthened my clutch on classics like this.

Flavour was great! I used Worcestershire sauce instead of soya sauce. I added a green pepper, diced up small. And skipped the bay leaf. However, the next I prepare this, I will follow my instincts and prepare the macaroni separately and rinse. I should have known but decided to follow the instructions. It thickened up and basically became mush.

I am Puerto Rican, and I made this recipe for my boyfriend who is from the Midwest (Michigan). I have never had goulash. He loved it! He said it was one of the best goulash he has ever eaten. The only thing I changed was I used the Worcestershire sauce instead of the soy sauce. Also, I used two 8 ounces cans of tomato sauce. I always use the Goya brand for tomato sauce. It's the best brand. You can find it in the Latino/Hispanic/Mexican aisle section in Krogers or Meijer.  We also cut the portions in half - 4 servings.  Really good, we will make it again.

To me a five star happens when everyone at my table reaches for more.  And that was definitely the case with this simple goulash recipe.  I did add mushrooms after browning beef and draining.

I made this as is and it was a very easy and good meal.  It makes a lot, so there was plenty of leftovers which were delicious!  Next time I might sprinkle some Parmesan cheese over the top or maybe sprinkle in some chili pepper flakes for some heat.  I'll definitely make it again.

Classic comfort food.  This is good, filling food.  It's not gourmet or fancy but it is filling and satisfying.  I haven't made this in ages.  To those who said it was soupy - you probably cooked the pasta before adding it.  For me the only complaint is it dried and stuck to the pan so next time I'll boil the pasta for 3 to 5 minutes before adding as I do like it a little soupy.  I'll also cut it in half because this makes a LOT - and there are only 2 of us so the leftovers will be lunch for a week!  LOL - Thanks for posting this recipe!

Simple and very easy, plus bonus is that only one pot is needed.  I tend to add more ground beef but we have hearty eaters

It was just okay. I didn't like the flavor very much. Also, the noodles only took about 10 minutes to cook, 25 mins and they would have turned to mush.

After scrolling through reviews, I made this pretty much AS IS with only two simple modifications.  Only put in 2 bay leaves  and added an extra cup of macceroni.  This came out absolutely fantastic!  Will try adding green pepper and corn next time.

Very yummy. My kids loved it. I skipped the 3 cups of water, cooked and drained pasta separately, let beef/onion mix simmered for 25 min without pasta, then mix cooked pasta back to dish. Not soupy. Loved this dish!!

This is the goulash I grew up on. As a variety, mom used spaghetti sauce in place of tomatoes and Italian seasonings. And my favorite variation, mix up a box of shells and macaroni and add at the end. Cheesy good.

This dish is delicious! I didn't add the water or pasta or soy sauce, but added mushrooms and 6 cloves garlic and 1/4 cup red wine and green pepper. For sauce it was the same except 1 large crushed tomatoes, and 2- 14.5  diced tomatoes, so pretty much the same. I made penn pasta on the side.

It's almost identical to the Wisconsin "chili" I grew up with.  Substitute the soy and herbs with chili powder and switch 1 can of Rotel with a can of kidney beans.  Good though! Reminds me of what I had growing up, so it's comforting, but also different :)

Made this today, had most everything on hand, I added some fresh carrots and canned green beans, I used two cans of stewed tomatoes, and vegetable stock, instead of water.  My husband said this was a keeper, he said he would like to try some french bread with it next time.

Kind of just tasted like meat pasta sauce. I would had an extra cup or two of water to make it more soup like, I used a crockpot  and it became more like a chili. Flavors where decent though.

This was very good. Will make it again but will use tomato paste instead of sauce and less soy sauce. Felt like the sauce made it to soupy for our liking and that much soy made it to salty for us.

I don't think I would make this again; there is too much "seasoning" flavor and not enough of any other flavor. We had to doctor the end result quite a bit to make it edible.

I followed instructions but used less bay leaf, added dark red  kidney beans, used chicken stock instead of water.  It was like my mother maked when I was a child, except she used spaghetti noodles.  I also cut back to one can diced tomatos, less soupy, was much thicker.  Used ground turkey/pork instead of beef.  It was very tasty! Will make again.

I’ve made this before and I’ve commented on it every time! I love goulash. I grew up on it. It’s American goulash which is tastier than Hungarian goulash anyway.

My husband made this last week and I thought it was really good except next time we won't be adding a whole tablespoon of season salt. A 1/2 tablespoon would have been plenty.  Also, for the 3 of us it is way to much so we would cut the recipe in half.

My rating is directly related to my misuse of the recipe. I thought it would be ok to put an entire 16 oz box of elbows into the crockpot with the rest, & then I cooked it too long.  The result was dry and mushy. Folks, when the recipe calls for 2 cups of noodles- FOLOW IT. And , if you think one hour isn't long enough to cook the elbows, think again- it is plenty. Follow the recipe. I know I will next time.

My very fussy husband loved this, so that's a five-star meal in my book. The only change I made is to add some paprika because, to me, that's absolutely required in anything called goulash.

I was looking for a fast, easy meal tonight. I had two hamburgers thawed and three people so I made a half batch of this recipe.

I used what I had on hand; a pint of my homecanned carrot-tomato sauce and a pint of my own Rotel style tomatoes which gave it a bit of zing. To that I added some Italian seasoning and topped with Parmesan cheese. (I forgot the bay and the soy completely.) Great warm comfort food after a late night of combining corn.

Delicious! I substituted ground turkey and used whole wheat elbow noodles.  Also added finely diced yellow bell pepper.  At the very end, I added about a 1/2 cup of red wine and a tablespoon of sugar and let the juice reduce a bit more...yummy!! This makes a lot, so cook for a crowd!

I made this tonight for my partner and his parents and they loved it! I followed the recipe exactly and then asked my honey later if he felt I should change anything about it and he said no. He thought it  was so good, he didn't even add any salt or pepper for taste. This is a man who salts and peppers EVERYTHING haha! :D

I omitted the salt thinking the soy sauce would add enough, but the end result definitely needed it. Overall its a tasty dish that makes a lot of food; I will half it next time.

This recipe is very good. I made it last night for dinner, I wanted something simple but tasty and this was it. My whole family enjoyed it. My super picky never eat anything 6 year old ate her whole bowl and said, wow mom that was good. It's going to be a keeper for our house for sure. I did add some yellow and orange peppers other than that I followed the complete recipe.

Overall we all agreed it was pretty good.  We all ate it up but agreed it was missing something we just couldn't put our finger on.  Upon reading other reviews we made a few changes.   Cut water in half as we like a thicker, chili like consistently.  Used 1 can tomato sauce and 2 6oz cans of tomato paste.  Cut the Italian seasoning in half and only used 2 bay leaves.    Also used Worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce.    Also decided to add 1 chopped green pepper and approx 1.5 tablespoons of sugar.    When it came time to add the pasta we only cooked it for 15 mins as we prefer our pasta a little firm.   We topped it with some ground pepper and shredded cheddar.  As we ate it we found it to be somewhat bland.  A few of us added some of our favorite hot sauce ( Kickin' Original, highly recommended btw) and it spiced it a bit but still sort of lack luster.   We considered adding red/orange/yellow pepper but didn't want the pepper to overwhelm the dish.   Will make again, just wish I could figure out the missing WOW factor.

This was so simple, The taste was perfect, I did not add the bay leaf or the garlic and used Worcester Sauce instead of  Soy sauce I served it with fresh bread and a salad. Yes, I will be making this again!  BTW who care what type of  goulash it is. It was good and simple!

Growing up in Kansas with 6 brothers and a single mom that worked part time and went to school full time this was a weekly meal if not more often. I have been looking for a  recipe that is close to my moms and this is as close as it gets... the only thing she did different was add green pepper and corn also Worchestershire  instead of Soy sauce . I like the corn but green pepper has to be cut up really tiny for me to eat. This is Midwest Goulash, thank you for posting since my mother said she doesn't know how she made it that it was just the basics and whatever else she had on hand lol which is typical pinch of this and pinch of that, whatever you have in the house that can make a meal and make it stretch.

Delicious, no matter what you call it, although it would appear to be a cultural phenomenon with regional adaptations across the country.  We thoroughly enjoyed it though I did add some ketchup just to give it a bit more oomph.  I also added some corn because I wanted to use it up.  I used tomato juice rather than water.  My husband has just had seconds which is rather unheard of.

Grew up on a different version of "goulash" but wanted to try something different. Loved it. Good, wholesome and filling. Will become a staple in our home.

Tastes just like what I remember my mom making as a kid growing up in Michigan.  Made just like the recipe except used fresh chopped tomatoes instead of canned. Once done I threw in the crockpot on warm until dinner time. Very good!

I cooked the macaroni first and should have cooked a couple of minutes less.  Also added FF onions to this (be sure to add less salt if you add FF onions, as it was almost too salty (and I like salty)!.   Also added shredded cheddar cheese to this right before serving.   Will make again

Simply Satisfying.  This recipe was spot on except for a few adjustments.  I added 1 diced Green Bell Pepper and 1 diced Red Bell Pepper, a few abundant shakes of Garlic Salt and one packet of McCormicks Mild Chili Powder and a small 8 0z. can of Tomato Paste.  Adjusted the recipe to feed four, increased elbow Macaroni to 2 cups all to thicken.  I Cooked the Macaroni separately.  By the way, I excluded the two cups of water and Worcestishire and Italian Seasoning.  Next time I might add an additional half pound or 1 pound of 93% Lean Ground to beef it up and balance to perfection.  Perfect meal, My mom use to cook this when I was a kid and I added the Chili Powder per her 40 year old recipe.  Next best thing to being home again in Nashville,Tennessee.  By the way my mom's name is Pat (Patricia) too.  I can't wait to try this during the upcoming 2016 Winter.  Here's to feeding me, all the Winter Soldier's and the rest of the family.  Bucky...if you don't remember me, you'll remember this meal forever!  Bon Appetit!

This is the goulash that I grew up with in Iowa. Use a 5 quart or bigger dutch oven or this will not fit. I used to make this for my son and he still requests it when he's visiting with his children. Some times I've used pasta sauce instead of tomato sauce and I often add a can or two of mixed vegetables, corn, okra, etc. I always have a good crusty bread to sop up all the juices too. I've never used soy sauce, only worchestershire sauce and I usually use V8 instead of water. I don't use the seasoned salt either, just regular salt and pepper and I'm always forgetting the bay leaf.

I put in 2 large tomatoes instead of the can of diced tomatoes and I added fresh chopped basil and shredded mozzarella.  I put everything in the crockpot.  I put the mozzarella last.  Tasted very good.  Will make again.  I have also made a similar one where I cook the meat with a packet of taco seasoning.  It taste good that way too.

I halved all ingredients in this recipe except elbow macaroni & water - kept that at 2 cups each. Consistency was perfect, which I was worried would be too watery.
Didn't have bay leaves on hand so I didn't add them, but did throw in one green pepper & used Worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce. Also added half a can of tomato sauce for flavor. Put it in crock pot for about 1 1/2 hours.
My family loved this variation of goulash & I'll definitely make it again.
Thanks for the great recipe, @pathunt!

My grandma used to make something just like this and like this, it was delicious. I cooked the ground beef with some cumin to give it a little extra and it was just what it needed. Everyone in the family loved it, and it was a nice change from the usual spaghetti.

I cut this recipe in half, used worchesshire instead of soy sauce, and added a diced bell pepper. Came out excellent with plenty left over for lunch tomorrow at work !

It was great. The kids loved it. I didn't have seasoned salt, so I used Cajun spice as a substitute, but it tasted fine. I might spice it up next time with a bell pepper and some crushed red pepper.

As another reviewer stated, this is very similar to a Paula Deen recipe and that is why I decided to make it.  I made this according to the directions and found that it did not have very much flavor (which I found funny since most of Paula Deen's recipes are very flavorful).  When I reheated this for a second meal, I added chili powder (to taste) and added some Brooks ketchup since it is pretty spicy.  Either one of the two or both added much needed flavor and seasoning and I received many compliments.

This was pretty good but next time I'll try the crock pot method and also reduce the pasta to 1 cup and 1 can of diced tomatoes.I cooked the pasta separately but I think in the crock the flavors may come together more.I only need 4 servings hence reduced pasta and tomatoes :)

I would've given it 5 stars, but I made it exactly as written & I knew as I was dumping that 2nd Tbsp. of Italian seasoning that I shouldn't have done it.  Way way way too much Italian seasoning!  In fact I don't think it needs any, maybe other seasonings as some other reviewers suggested.  Aside from that it was fine, maybe a little heavy on the hamburger. I'll make it again, next time without the Italian seasoning, and maybe 1/2 lb. less burger or another half cup or so of noodles.

My family loves goulash. There's a hundred ways of making it. I add in mushrooms, and sometimes add okra and corn. This is a basic recipe, that is very tasty, so go ahead and make it your own! Whatever you have on hand will work.

I substituted reconstituted TVP for the hamburger and sautéed the onions in a little olive oil until they were translucent.  I then added the garlic and TVP.  From there I followed the recipe.  Very nice meatless goulash!

Made this tonight and it was good. Our main complaint was that it was a bit bland. I do plan to make this dish again, however I will be seasoning the meat more. I did cook the pasta and then added it for the last 25 mins. (I did this because of several reviews that suggested it)

My changes: 
Substituted soy sauce with Worcestershire Sauce. 
Substituted water with beef broth. 
Cooked pasta in a separate pot and added it to the sauce when done (I know from experience that when you cook the pasta in with the sauce, it tends to become mushy. I'm an "al-dente" kinda woman) This dish was fantastic. SO asked, "Why don't you make this every week?" Heck, I'm not sure why. It's an economical, filling meal. If tweaked properly (with low-sodium sauces, lean meat and whole-wheat pasta), this meal could be considered healthful. Maybe I WILL make it every week!

Funny thing is, my mother made this several times a year when I was growing up (we simply called it "goulash" in Upstate NY) and I hated it. Funny how our taste buds mature with our bodies.

Very good goulash recipe!  Followed recipe as written other than halving it since there are only two of us and only cooking for 10 minutes after the macaroni was added.  When reading recipe ingredients before trying it, was a little bit skeptical on ingredients, but again it turned out great!  We both loved it!  Thanks for posting!

Truly this is a 1-1/2 star recipe.  I made it for my husband and my twin teenage sons.  My husband and one son found it completely inedible.  The other son tolerated it and said it was 'ok'.  I would never make it again and don't recommend it.

Well I wasn't sure about the soy sauce, so I left it out.  One of two cups pasta I changed to whole grain, and I used basil & oregano seasoned tomatoes and sauce.

I added:
Bell pepper,
1 tbls Emeril's Essence,
1 or 2 tbls Tony Chachares Original, depending on your spice threshold,
Sprinkle some favorite steak seasoning,
Sprinkle of black pepper,
1 to 2 tbls sugar.

This recipe is very easy and requires little prep! Not expensive to make either. It yields a lot so invite the neighbors! Overall, we liked it. We served it with a side salad and it worked well together.  I added a few ingredients and should have ignored one ingredient!! I added 1 teaspoon finely chopped jalapeño pepper and 1 chopped bell pepper. I REALLY recommend omitting the bay leaves. They are extremely concentrated and are overbearing. I didn't like the strong taste. IF you do, Reduce the # of bay leaves from 3 down to 1. I firmly believe it would make this recipe a lot better. Next time we make this goulash recipe we will make it the same as we did today and leave off the bay leaves so it'll be better. Good luck!!!

I have made this a few times, and enjoyed it. Because I like to tinker, I added a diced bell pepper and a can of whole kernel corn. It was even better I thought, even if not "classic".

Love this recipe! I have made this at least a dozen times. Made this again last night. I substituted lean Turkey and accidentally put elbow macaroni in before simmering sauce for 20 minutes. I ended up only cooking it for 25 minutes. It still turned out good but not quite as flavorful since the spices didn't get to cook as long.

This was very good.   My husband said he really liked it after one bite!  His usual response to dinner is, "It's alright."  We had planned on going out for dinner but a snow storm kept us in. It's just us two so I cut the recipe by half.  I had most of the ingredients on hand.  I did have some beef broth and pizza sauce left from a meals earlier this week and used those in place of the water and tomato sauce.  I served it with some garlic toast topped with leftover pepperoni.  If I hadn't been so full I would have used another piece of bread to soak up the leftover sauce. I will be making this again and again. Thanks for posting!

I made this for dinner tonight and followed the recipe except I was out of bay leaves. It was really good, but I think the next time I make it I will only use 1 Tbls.of Italian Seasoning. 2 Tbls. overpowered it and maybe only 1/2 Tbls. of seasoned salt as it was a little salty also. I will post a new comment when I make it again with the changes I mentioned above.

The recipe was just okay.  The recipe photo looked too soupy so I cut the water amount to one cup.  The sauce ratio to pasta didn't seem to my liking, so I added 1/4 cup more of pasta.   I don't know if I'll make it again.

It's pasta and red sauce. It is a nice twist to cook the pasta in its own sauce and save the water, but is otherwise completely unremarkable. Might just use pre-made pasta sauce for more flavor.

Loved the recipe...I used the crockpot method and the macaroni seemed to taste a bit more starchy than I anticipated. Next time, I would boil the macaroni first.

Made this in the crock pot cutting the recipe in half (two of us).  It was very good, but there was way to much liquid.  I added another cup of macaroni and cooked it another 40 min. and it was perfect.  I had planned to add green pepper, but didn't have one.  Did add some minced garlic when I browned the beef.  This recipe didn't make it to my favorites list, but I will make it again sometime.

I have been making the same goulash (Mom's recipe) for 30 years but wanted to try some alterations for a change.  I made this recipe using 2 TBSP soy sauce rather than three and adding celery and green pepper. Soy sauce ruined the dish (thank God I didn't add one more TBSP) and the Italian seasoning did not help this dish at all.  The wonderful full tomato flavor I get with my recipe was totally masked by the SALTY soy sauce and the Italian seasoning.  My husband even said it was pretty bad.  
On a positive note, I liked the ratio of meat to noodles.  I like goulash with plenty of juice/sauce and meaty, which this was.  Adding the noodles into the sauce to cook worked well, however 25 minutes cooking time is way too long if you like them al dente. They were way overcooked after 20" and then they sit in the hot pot cooking even longer.  I would give them about the usual 5 - 10" simmer time - that's it.

Excellent recipe.  We halved it b/c it is just the three of us in the family but it turned out great and for an economical recipe it was yummy and filling. You can change this up with whatever you want to add depending on where in the US you grew up - add corn, add bell pepper, etc. One of my son's favorites during winter time. Served with a side salad and homemade bread.

I thought it was a little to soupy. I think it would have turned out better without the three cups of water and the noodles cooked separately. I have never had classic american goulash so my judgement might be off.

I don't want to get into the international fight for the right to claim goulash as theirs... but, this is some mighty fine goulash. I have fun memories eating goulash with my family at the dinner table back in the 60's. But, I never learned how to make. Thanks mom for serving it and...
Thank you for sharing Pathunt!

This was the perfect dish on a cold winter night.  The family loved it.  I did use the chili powder version with the V-8 juice and just add some more flavor I added peas and carrots.

I made up a version of this recipe and have made it since my children (now in their 40s) were small.  I called it "Beefaroni" (because my son loved the canned stuff by that name) and they loved it...then and now; they both make it for their own families!  I use Worcestershire sauce instead of soy, some diced bell pepper, no bay leaf and less liquid...mine is not soupy at all. I saute the macaroni with the ground beef and vegetables until it turns golden, then add the liquid.  I cook until noodles are tender, normally less an hour.

This is the goulash on which I grew up and continue to make as comfort food. However, for me it has to have bell pepper, thin sliced pepperoni and grated cheddar.

This is a good recipe that I've made quite a few times.  I only do 2 cups of water and not the 3 cups it calls for.  There's already plenty of liquid with the tomato sauce and diced tomatoes so the extra water makes it soupy.

Great recipe!  Reminds me of Mom's. Always a few modifications with me, though.  I cooked my noodles al dente to save a little time, didn't use quite as much water as what the recipe called for, used Rotel seasoned diced tomatoes because that's what I had on hand, tossed in a big squeeze of catsup because it is a little sweeter, and used Lea & Perrins instead of soy.  Top liberally with grated parmesan and YUM!  I will definitely be making again!  Bet it's even better as left-overs tomorrow!  Thanks for posting.

People need to understand that things like a clove of garlic, or a bay leaf vary in sizes naturally.  Therefore when a recipe calls for such, one should era on the side of caution. You can add more later. You can taste the dish and adjust other flavorings to.  When someone says a recipe is bland, it's your own fault, not the recipe's.  Since everyone's taste is different, taste and adjust to your own. 

I halved the recipe and like others used Worcestershire instead of soy.  I always have chopped bell peppers in the freezer so I threw in a handful of green bell pepper with the onions.  I didn't have tomato sauce so I used tomato paste and a cup of water.  I didn't add additional water because I wanted a thick sauce.  I ended up adding a tad near the end.  I only put one bay leaf in since I halved the recipe and that was enough.  It turned out great.  Not my mom's but just as good.  Don't tell her.

I have been eating this since I was a child, and Mom usually called it chop suey. She was from New England. I also hear it called goulash and hamburger soup.
I generally use a lower fat content ground beef, and don't drain it, as the fat adds flavor, and I don't lose the other liquids created while browning the meat. I have also used ground turkey, but the flavor is not the same, even when adding beef soup base.
When I want more than just the basic soup. I also will add bell peppers, preferably the red and yellow ones, as some in my family find green ones have too strong a flavor. I will also add mushrooms and/or a can of small black olives.
I will serve this with a loaf of Italian bread, and I like it with shredded parmesan cheese. I generally will make a big pot and eat it for a couple of days.

I added 1 chopped green pepper and used 1 lb of mild Italian sausage and 1 lb of ground buffalo. Added 3 diced Yukon Gold potatoes. It turned out very nicely!

I added green pepper at the onion stage and instead of 3 cups of water I added 3 cups beef broth. Very satisfying on a chilly rainy/snowy day! Yum

Made this recipe for the first time, put 1 less cup of water, used all organic ingredients. I have celiac disease so I substituted gluten free penne. I served it with a little bit of cheese and a splash of red hot! Will definitely be making this again!!

I followed the recipe as listed for the most part. I used 2 cups of rotini noodles instead of macaroni also after it was done I add more season salt and some garlic powder. 
The goulash had a good flavor but was a little bland for my liking. I rated this a 3 because my personal preference I don't think I'm a fan of goulash. But if goulash is what you want then this is a good recipe to follow!

LOVED IT!!  I live in MN and this is the classic Midwestern version of goulash that I grew up with.  I made a few modifications based on other reviews - added a chopped green pepper and used Worcestershire instead of soy sauce.  It was easy to make and very very good!  I will definitely be keeping this in my fall/winter meal rotation!!

This is an American mid-western comfort dish my mom made when I was a child. It was very easy and yummy! I added a little smoked paprika, corn and kidney beans. Instead of cooking the macaroni separately,I added it to the pot after the final ingredients were bubbly and cooked it until al dente. Cuts out an additional step and imparts more flavor to the pasta. Presents beautifully in a Le creuset for a potluck.

Some people in the midwest may know this more as johnnie marzetti. That does not include soy sauce though.  Very popular in Ohio. 

For this who criticize and say it is not Hungarian and give bad ratings,  shame on you! The contributor never claimed Hungarian, but classic.... Which it is for many and with the US being so diverse, this is steak in many homes. Keep an open mind and try it, it could become a family favorite.

First review I've written because ITS THAT GOOD! I did have to modify some ingredients because of what I had on hand but I don't think it was too big of a difference. First....used ground turkey and only had 24oz instead of 32. I did not have tomato sauce so used marinara. Substitue for diced tomatoes: one can rotel diced with green chiles  and one can (from Aldi's) of tomato, corn & okra. Didnt have seasoned salt so used Old Bay. Let me say-I love to cook & try new recipes all the time. Hubby brought his empty plate to the kitchen requesting that this get added to the dinner rotation! It's been years since that request!!  Def try this recipe.

Way too much onion! I prepared it exactly as written, and those two large yellow onions dominated the meal. More onion than noodle! I would like to make this again with half of one large onion, because it has potential.

Good old fashioned comfort food is what I like to call it!  My only change was to add a chopped green pepper to the mix.  I also used a pound of mixed pastas that needed to be used up.  Served with garlic bread and had a great meal!  Thanks for sharing, pathunt!

I ate this a couple times growing up, I do remember loving it then. This recipe was ok... just ok. Edible, but not something that i would make again. Depends on your taste I guess, however My husbands like blah, I did not finish my plate. Both kids ate just enough to get down from the table lol

This reminded me of my Dad's famous Goulash. My friends would all want a bowl if they knew he made it. I made it using 5 lbs. of hamburger meat, canned corn, soup starter veggies and even added black beans for the nutrition. Tomato sauce and diced tomato. Ketchup, onions and just a pinch of salt and pepper. Daddy used to say, just put in a bunch of stuff and call it goulash. Always a favorite.

Doubled recipe (always do), made the noodles separate (so eliminated water) because I didn't want the noodles to soak up all the tomatoes.  Quadrupled spices and added way more of my "own Italian spice mixture" (just because we LOVE spice and fresh garlic), but for some reason there still WAS NOT enough spice!!! Also added fresh largely chopped red, yellow, orange and green pepper with the onions as beef was cooking AND more sauce, crushed tomatoes and stewed tomatoes since more veggies were added (we like our food wet not dry).  Added fresh sliced mushrooms shortly before dish was done (so they didn't get overcooked).  Had to add Parmesean cheese to each serving for more flavor!!  This made a lot and was just OK in my book.  My family ate it (we DON'T WASTE FOOD!) but they were not THRILLED!  I still cannot figure out why it tasted SO blan (even after I added so much spice!)  I let it simmer without the noodles for a few hours to incorporate the flavor as well (and it still was blan the next day). Don't think I would make this again unless I added something else for more flavor.

Perfect. The only thing I do is add a can of corn. That is how I had it growing up. This is in our regular rotation and everyone loves it.

I have made this recipe several times since I first saw it.  I believe my mom made something similar (I'm 71 yo so it's hard to remember!).  Since I was making it for only two of us, I used the same ingredients  except I used only 1 lb. of ground beef and and adjusted the other ingredients accordingly.  I added chopped green pepper, and used worchestershire sauce instead of soy sauce.  It made a lot so I froze some for future eating.  My husband really liked it and I liked it as well.  Very easy dish to make.  Good on the budget too.  UPDATE:  2/25/2017   I made this using the whole amount of ingredients and it made enough for me to freeze three meals' worth and share a large meal with our neighbor.  My husband says I can make this all the time as far as he is concerned!

Made this exactly as recipe follows. Too much italian seasoning for my taste. The goulash my mom makes is very tomatoey which is how I prefer it. Next time I would season it differently.

Read no further... I spent a crazy amount of time reading many many many comments on this recipe and made alterations based on comments....

Alterations:
I tried this in the crockpot on low for about 3 hrs
After browning the meat w/ onions, etc..

I used a jar of spaghetti sauce in place of tomato sauce

Instead of all the soy sauce I did 2TBS SOY & 2TBS 
Worcestershire sauce

Added LOTS of basil and a little less Italian seasonings

Beef broth instead of water

About a cup of shredded zucchini I had in the freezer (just for fun, not because of suggestions or anything)

I recommend cooking noodles separately and adding them at the end. They got mushy in the crockpot

My mother in law makes this all the time and my husband loves it so I decided to make my own! I did add green peppers and decided to split the recipes into 2 pots one regular and one spicy. To the spicy one I added 1 1/2 tablespoons of webers n'orleans Cajun seasoning and it turned out perfect. Yummy on these cold nights we've had.

Good recipe we like the American beauty sea shells pasta 3 cups instead of 2 and 1/2 cup sugar and cut back on the water to 2 1/2 cups to make it not so soupy. More like what Grandma made back n the day.

This is good and satisfying, and both my husband and I like it, which is a rare thing because he's super picky. I make it with ground turkey instead of beef, and I use whole wheat mac elbows instead of regular. I also add a generous pinch of chili flakes as my guy likes a kick.

This is a great basic recipe good with any combo of ground meat - I like 1 lb. each ground turkey and pork. I only used 1 15 oz. can of tomato sauce, 28 oz can crushed tomatoes (instead of diced), otherwise my kids pick them out. OMIT the seasoned salt, the soy makes it salty enough. One bay leaf and 1 tbsp. of Italian seasoning is plenty. I had a 16 oz. box of fusilli on hand, but use any short pasta (De Cecco is my fave brand). Add a little water if needed. I too like this with green peppers, but it's good without too.

I replaced soy sauce with Worcestershire sauce and added 1/4 diced green pepper. I used Diced tomatoes with garlic & onion for extra garlic flavor. Also used freshly ground Italian herb seasoning. Very good. Does make a lot. Can freeze.

I'm sorry but I made this exactly according to the directions (only substituting Worcestershire sauce for soy and adding green pepper, as EVERYONE seemed to suggest) and I really didn't like it. Wayyyy too much Italian seasoning! And that combined with the bay leaves made it very one note, not enough complexity. My other major issue was not including any sugar to balance the acidity of all the tomato product.  I ended up adding a bunch of other seasonings at the end to made it edible.

I made this as written and just thought it was OK.  I can appreciate how easy it is and the list of ingredients I always have on hand though.  I'll happily eat it, but not sure I'll make it again.

Way too much Italian seasoning and bay leafs. It wasn't bad if you ate it right away, but later in the day and the second day, a few bites was all I could stand even after adding another round of tomato sauce. We don't like it soupy so I used a whole box of elbows, which made it a hearty texture like we like, but 25 minutes was way too long to cook the dry mac. The noodles ended up mushy and fell apart especially by the second day. Hubs didn't like it either. We tried to eat it for a couple of days, but could never finish a whole bowl and ended up throwing most of it away. If I ever make it again I will cut way back on the seasonings and cook the noodles only 10-12 minutes like the box says. I might skip the soy sauce.

I was pretty happy with this.  After adding the other seasoning and tasting it, I left the seasoned salt out. Thought it had enough flavor without but then ended up feeling like something was missing when we ate it for dinner. I'll definitely make this again and either go ahead and add the salt or check out some of the other seasoning suggestions in the reviews. I also added a green bell pepper and corn. To make it less soup-like, I cut the water in half, doubled the macaroni and cooked it separately before combining with the sauce. This made it more like a casserole than a soup which is what I wanted.

I haven't made goulash in over 10 years and I tried out this recipe for my picky 12 yr old son and my culinary student husband. I kept my fingers crossed and made with the ingredients listed. The only two changes I made was that I used 1 lb lean ground beef and 1 lb of ground pork and I also added one green pepper to the mix. It was a major hit in our house. Even the picky soccer player son of mine had more than one bowl. This is definitely a keeper in our dinner recipe box. :)

Good comfort food for a cold winter night! Definitely too much salt for our tastes. I cut recipe in half and used only 1 tsp seasoned salt. Next time, I'd like to use regular salt and a little less than this time. I added green pepper and liked it.

Goulash is a family favorite, and normally cooked on stove top.  I decided to try this to cut down on steps and time.  Turned out great.  Did a few things differently.  Only had 1 can each of tomato sauce and diced tomatoes.  Didn't have bay leafs and instead of seasoning salt used regular salt and added pepper.  Seasoned salt sometimes doesn't pack the same flavor and punch leaves it lacking.  So, regular salt much better.  Slow cooker was awesome.  I also don't have a dutch oven and used a regular skillet to cook hamburger and onion together.  Came out like it should.  I know some complained it was too soupy.  Mine turned out perfect with the 1 can each of tomato sauce and diced tomatoes.  Great recipe though.

This dish was delicious and a big hit with the kids! Based on a couple of the reviews I read, I decided to cut the onion down to 1 1/2 medium size onions, but added 3/4 cup very finely diced carrots.  I also discarded the bay leaves after the first simmer (before putting in the pasta).  Lastly, I sprinkled a little shredded mozzarella cheese on top just before serving.  It was perfect!

Very warming and filling.  We used worcestershire instead of soy sauce, as it seemed like a better match up.  Also cut the amount of water in half, which was still plenty and the macaroni cooked just fine.  If we had some tomato or veggie juice, I think that would be better than just water.  We ate with sour cream and may try some cheese next time.  So only 4 stars for the original recipe, but 5 stars with our adjustments.

It was delicious! My kids and I loved it. I didn't have elbow macaroni so I substituted ditalini pasta and I was all out of Italian seasoning so I used a tsp each of oregano, thyme and rosemary.

This was good, but I don't have a dutch oven big enough. I was able to make this recipe and my dutch oven was filled to the top, but 2 cups of pasta wasn't enough. Had to make additional pasta in another pot.

This is the classic American Goulash I love and remember eating at many different events. Being concerned about it being soupy, from the picture, I elected to follow the Cook's Note. This was so easy and I could make it early and keep it hot for a few hours being done in a slow cooker. Though it wasn't clear in the Cook's Note about whether or not to cover it I covered it and worked with no problem.

Sugar. It is missing a tablespoon of sugar plus more when served to sprinkle on to taste. That's how we make it in Small Farm Town, MN.

..about 1/2 through with cooking this and i can already tell it will be amazing! (Obviously taste testing is taking place)... And like Cheri i added the very important & i feel necessary chopped green pepper! (Fresh or frozen green peas can work if you don't like peppers). Mmmm Mmmm.. Can't wait till it's ready  =)~
Oh! i also changed soy sauce to Worcestershire at 1/2 the amount, omitted the bay leaves & Italian seasoning and drastically reduced the seasoned salt... added fresh ground pepper and sea salt, and some paprika & parsley.
HA, guess i changed it a lot, but thanks for the base recipe!!

My six kids and husband love this. I add zucchini to it when I put the macaroni in and it makes a complete meal. I also use stewed tomatoes for half of the tomatoes in the recipe and put Parmesan on top when I serve it.

I prepared this in my slow cooker today and felt that something was missing up front, but I can't quite figure it out. Over all it was a delicious recipe and I will definitely make it again, especially with winter right around the corner.

I added shredded pork because we didn't have enough ground beef but agree with Cheri and Mrsjoedo, it needs green pepper. The fam ate it and said it was good though. :)

Didn't add the bay leaves, used worstershire sauce instead of soy. The italian spices were just too much I will cut down on them a little next time. Other than that this waa a pretty good dish, fast and easy for a weeknight meal.

Amazing!  I forgot to say I added green pepper and kidney beans to suit our tastes.  Made half a batch and used 1 bay leaf and 8 oz tomato sauce along with around 1/8 cup ketchup.  Only had wheat angel hair pasta so I broke that in half and used it instead.  Also used some fresh tomatoes.

Made recipe as is but cut the salt down a little b/c some reviews were saying it was too much salt or Italian seasoning. However, I will add the tablespoon next time just like the recipe calls for.  And my family and I thought the Italian was right on.  I will make this again, especially in the fall and winter.  Thank you for sharing a great recipe pathunt!

When I was growing up, my working mom would make spaghetti sauce using this basic same recipe except without the soy sauce, bay leaves or extra water. She did use extra tomato sauce and just a pinch of sugar to cut the acidity. By using elbow macaroni instead of spaghetti noodles, it was easier for us kids to reheat. Just add some parm and a slice of garlic bread and a full tummy was had by all! Thanks for the memories:}     Theresa F

I haven't been to the store in weeks, but had a pound of ground beef in the freezer and pantry items, this fit the bill perfectly!  Nice, warm lunch we both enjoyed.  I halved the recipe and followed exactly using Tony Cacchere's seasoning, simple & delicious.  Thanks for sharing the recipe, pathunt.

It is very hard for me to find a dish my teens, and my husband and I like, but this goulash was the one. We have enjoyed it so much! I also love the fact that it's not just a winter meal. Thank you very much for making my whole family happy.

This review is based on my DH & DS comments as I don’t care for goulash.  “This is awesome” “This is really good, you can make this one again?”  “Will you put this recipe in my recipe box?” “Is this hard to make ‘cause you’ve not made this before”.  Ok, do you get the picture?  My guys loved this recipe.  I made it as written only using venison in place of the hamburger.  This recipe makes quite a bit.  I served for dinner, had leftovers for lunch, froze a casserole dish for my in-laws to reheat and have a container in the freezer for my guys to each have a serving for dinner one night.  Their eyes and their taste buds both give this a 5-star rating.

Added bell peppers, used lots of onions, used Braggs instead of soy sauce. My family loves it. Great make ahead 
And take camping or serve large gathering. 
I cook noodles separately reg and gluten free and add at last minute....but I don't l Ike reheated noodle dishes because the noodles keep cooking and get mushy...especially gluten free. Also I top with shredded cheese, sour cream and diced onions like I would a chili.

Cut recipe in half, but used 1.5 cups noodles instead of just 1. Glad I did, or it would have been too soupy for us. Added a couple dashes of Worcestershire and tobacco. Great classic comfort recipe.

This is so delicious and simple and...classic as the title says!  The only thing I did differently is use Worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce, added red pepper flakes (b/c I love spicy food), and added in some garlic powder.  I made this on a whim for dinner (I was missing comfort foods from growing up in Iowa) and the whole family chowed it down.  I made 1/2 the recipe but wish I would have made the whole thing so that we would have leftovers!

Made it exactly as given for a Sunday dinner and it was a big hit.  Whether you call it goulash, mac & meat sauce, or chili mac, the seasonings are just right for us!  I half the recipe for just me and hubs for week nights.  Thanks Pathunt!

This was my first attempt at goulash, I remember when my mom and grandma used to make their version of this growing up.
I altered it slightly based on preference and items on hand, but it was pretty much the same. I also did cooked macaroni because I never know how much to add for the right ratios, and I didnt do a dutch oven but that is a really good idea for next time.

-I did 2 cans diced tomatoes, but one was Italian flavored
-Added 1 can corn, added to taste/texture
-I did not add a full 2 cans of tomato sauce, only had a mini can so would definitely do at least 1 can
-I added a combination of garlic salt, garlic powder, cumin, oregano, basil, and salt and pepper. I thought it was a good mix but could have used more than what I put in. 
-I used worcestershire sauce instead of soy
-I added two sticks of celery, chopped, but found it stayed crunchy, so probably should have cooked it a bit longer

Otherwise, great base for this dish. Will definitely make again!

This goulash has brought back many memories.  We also added onion, green pepper and a can of rinsed red kidney beans to make it go a bit further for a family of 6.

I reduced the serving size down to 4 because I only had a pound of hamburger. I used 26 ounces of spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce, added chopped celery and used a 12 ounce box of macaroni. I did not use bay leaves. The altered recipe turned out nice and thick and was not soupy as one person noted. I added shredded parmesan cheese to each serving. Yummy and I would definitely make it again.

No matter what you call this, its easy, yummy comfort food. How can you beat a one pot, tasty meal?!? I did sub V8 for the water as some suggested and think it added to the flavor. Added a bag of frozen mixed veggies when I added the pasta. Served with a dollop of sour cream. I would make this again!

My Mom made this for us when kids - "American ChopSuey", with Worcestershire not soy sauce (I'm from New England).  It is related to greek Pasticcio, if you use mediterranean spices.  As vegetarians, I have adapted it to use pre-cooked lentils in place of the ground beef - just add them after cooking down the onions, tomatoes, etc. It is one of our favorites, especially with the béchamel added to the top al-la pasticcio!

I've been making this exact recipe at least twice a month for the last couple years. It is one of my family's favorite comfort foods. We always add some shedded cheddar cheese to it at the end and let it melt into it. It makes a nice creamy addition to it. We also add 1 TBSP of House Seasoning in it. This can be made by mixing 2 Tsp salt, 1/2 Tsp Pepper & 1/2 Tsp of Garlic Powder. Infact I actually made this for supper tonight.

Excellent! Everyone likes to put their own spin on their dish...here's mine.
Pre cook your pasta and omit the water. Where pasta is concerned...have fun and use different shapes and sizes. I like wortchestershire sauce but it can be an overpowering taste, I used only 1tsp. I also chopped up red and yellow peppers and a jalapeno pepper. Maybe two jalapeno's for some heat as I found one didn't add any heat at all. Serve with crusty rolls.
Easy, fast and the home crew loved it! Thanks!

Made this the other night, came out super thick, but I also used the whole bag of noodles and not just what it called for. Will make it again but I would like it to have a more tomato taste to it.

I love this comforting one pot recipe! There's lots of room for variations, but I make it pretty much true to the recipe shown. Except I replace about half of the water with beef broth. It's even better the next day!

I used the slow cooker version, left out the bay leaves and soy sauce but kept faithful to everything else and I LOVE IT!  It reminds me of the goulash my mother used to make - but better. Maybe a little less garlic next time ...........

I have tried to replicate my mom's goulash and could never do that until I made this recipe.  I think it is the bay leaves that made the difference.  Such a simple meal with a veggie/salad/potato.  It took me back many years to a warm, peaceful place.

I absolutely Loved this recipe!  I scaled it down because it's just my husband and myself here at home but I know it can be doubled if company arrives.  The name matters little to me...taste is the main criteria...and by the way....green pepper is essential.  Perfect!

This recipe rocked! Whatever the style of goulash this is.. It was seasoned well and made a ton of leftovers. Any recipe that my family enjoys, can have seconds if wanted including enough for lunch the next day and is budget friendly is always a plus. I did add frozen chopped bell peppers we saved from the garden and cooked it down so it wasn't "soupy" at all.

I love goulash!  Reminds me of a cold Sunday afternoon in the South when Mamma would cook up a huge pot and we would eat it with Saltine crackers ... no spoons needed! This is very close to the recipe that my mamma passed down to me me with a few exceptions ... drain the tomatoes, add tomato paste, no soy sauce and about a tablespoon of brown sugar ... and for Lords sake, where are the kidney beans?  LOL ... It just isn't goulash to me without kidney beans!

a little soupy for my liking, but good flavor. if you like a 'not so soupy" goulash, maybe cut down on the sauces

This was great the whole family loved it. Was easy to make and made a lot. Make sure to use large pot as it will expand when noodles are finished. I didn't do dry bay leaves, instead I just used crushed bay leaf. I also didnt bother to drain the hamburger as i find the grease adds flavor and will help to tighten the recipe if you are worried it will be to thin for your liking. If you want to cut the carbs drastically use dreams field elbow Mac instead. For anyone who doesn't know of this product..its pasta that virtually has no carbs but tastes no different and texture is the same as well. You can usually find versions of it at F L and wal-mart has begun to sell some now. This dish again was great, cooked up just right. I WILL be making this a monthly meal as I have looked high and low for an American goulash for a while but always came up with Hungarian styles. I like it simple and yummy so this is perfect:-) The other good thing about this is that you can add other ingredients as others have suggested. Just put in what you like and adjust with more water. No need to change from soy sauce in my option cause you don't even taste it really.

Not sure where I went wrong, maybe too many noodles...  It was a huge bowl of spaghetti when I was done.  I just expected something different.

This was a great comfort food dish.  I will be keeping this recipe and making it again for sure.  It was very easy to make and the flavors were great. I liked that it made a lot so I can have it the next day too.  Thanks for sharing!

This was good. I did everything as written but I used 2.5 lbs of ground meat (just to use up what I had) and only used 2 bay leaves. I think 3 is a bit much. I also took them out a little early because the bay flavor was pretty strong.  also used only 1 heaping Tbs of italian seasoning. Good recipe though and easy to make.

Only 4 stars, because it has a bit too much tomato flavor for me. I want to try this same spice combination for my next beef stew.

My husband called it "Fancy goulash"

This was very good and I grew up on Goulash once a week. My kids really liked it. The only thing I changed was the use of 50/50 ground beef and mild Italian sausage.

It's goulash, so I hesitate giving it more than 3 stars. But the recipe is just like Mom used to make, so in that respect, it's GREAT! :) Just what I was looking for. Made it just as directed. I love goulash with a side of cottage cheese.

We grew up on this in New England but it was always called American Chop Suey...it was a family favorite then and is loved by my family now...the difference is we did not use soy sauce or the bay leaf...I don't drain the tomatoes or add the water because I cook the elbows or whatever pasta i'm using seperately, and add green peppers along with the onion...I usually serve it with freshly grated parmesan/romano cheese and a crusty bread...it is also great as a leftover and the flavors have  blended even more

I halved the recipe and used 1.5c. ditalini pasta instead of the macaroni. Added a splash of Worcestershire sauce and used Mrs. Dash instead of the Italian seasoning. My three-year-old cleaned his plate!

Thought it would be too soupy so added 3/4 c. more pasta.  Also added 2 level T sugar.  Took twice as long to cook in slow cooker as is shown in recipe.  In future, will use heavier bigger pasta.
With these changes it was perfect and very good.  Could serve to guests.

I was going to make this exactly as written, but I didn't have some of the ingredients.  I left out the salt & soy sauce, swapped stewed tomatoes for the diced, added a can of mushrooms (drained), and swapped the pasta for long grain rice.  I only used 1 pound of hamburger, and still had over 8 servings.  The difference between stove top and crock pot was so minimal, I just used the stove top.  And I can't wait to taste day 2! :)  Love this recipe!

We used to call this, "Ones- a-meal". Very popular in our area fire stations.  Able to feed  20 hungry firefighters and still have leftovers.  Very economical. And tasty too!

We add bell pepper & corn & very little water. Also used worcestershire sauce not soy sauce. Growing up in a large family where money was always tight, we only used 1 lb. of ground beef.

Nice, basic recipe.  For second batch, we added Vidalia (extra sweet) onions, red pepper (2t), frozen corn, a small can of Ro-Tel (green chili and tomatoes) and a cinnamon stick to add zing which we enjoy here in the Southwest.  Loved the bay leaves; left out the soy sauce. Used bow-tie pasta we had in cupboard.  I'm going to try kidney beans next time.  Handy recipe, for sure!  Thank you!!!

This took me back to grade school!  I used a jar of basic tomato sauce instead of adding in Italian seasoning and water, just because I didn't have enough canned sauce on hand.  I added chopped onion and peppers too.  Fantastic!  Hubby even loved it.

The first time I made this I used the crock pot instructions and the pasta like dissolved and were gooey.  It was pretty gross.  So I would not recommend doing the pasta in the crock pot like that.  The second time I tried I followed the stove top instructions and it turned out pretty good!  I too used Worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce and I added some diced green pepper the second time around!

Great recipe. Reminds me of what my Aunt used to bring to our family potluck dinners. The first time I made this I added an extra cup of Pasta because My kids like it thicker. It's on the stove now... I added a bell pepper this time. I'm sure either way with or without a bell pepper it is great. Thanks for sharing!

Classic comfort food in my family.  My mom and grandmother frequently made goulash, and now it is a staple in our house.  This is a great recipe.  I change things from time to time for variety, but this is wonderful as written!

Made the for dinner tonight and my picky 2 year old asked for seconds! I cut this in half and used ground turkey instead of beef. Also added a tablespoon of brown sugar and a good sprinkle of pepper. I used 1 1/2 cups of noodles so it wasn't quite as saucy. Also love that its dairy free because we have food allergies and run out of ideas for dinner. I will be making this again!

The only thing I might try different next time is to pre-cook the macaroni (al dente) and stir it into sauce just before serving or serve w/sauce over macaroni if I expect to have left-overs so that it doesn't get mushy when reheating.  YUMMY flavor!

When I searched ''goulash'' this was the first recipe I saw that reminded me of my mom's goulash we had growing up. The recipe was easy to follow and easy to make. I only used 1 can of the diced tomatoes because my husband isn't a big fan of tomatoes in food, so we compromised. The only difference I really had from the recipe  was in the time cooking in the crockpot. For my crockpot it actually took about an hour and 45 minutes, but we weren't in a hurry to eat so it was no big deal for us. Excellent recipe Pat!!

Delicious!  I love the spices and flavorings.  My husband drained all the liquid out of it when I wasn't watching, but it still tasted great!  This will join the list of often-made foods at our home!

Yum!  This was a very good recipe - I used one chopeped  green pepper and one onion in place of the two onions called for in the recipe. I also added 1 teaspoon paprika, additional soy sauce, salt and pepper. This is a keeper and one to share!  We enjoyed it with shredded sharp cheddar cheese.

I made this last night for the family.  Overall the family thought it was good, though they are picky eaters.  Definitely something for a cold night to stay warm.

My kids' eyes light up when they know I am making this for dinner.  They love it.  Very filling, warm, and comforting.  I omit the bay leaves since I don't like the flavor they add.  The soy sauce ups the old stand-by recipes.

this recipe makes enough to feed an army! have to remember to cut amounts down to half for just myself and fiance, and still have left overs! also cut the amount of spices down to a quarter, still gives it enough flavor without it overpowering the whole meal.

This was what I grew up on although mom always put in green pepper and a can of corn.  I decided to make this dish tonight after not making it now for probably 20 or 25 years.  I ran out of cheddar cheese for topping and so I threw on some Feta cheese and WOW was it delicious.  I think it will be on our table now a couple of times a month and always with feta stirred into the pot just before serving.  Enjoy!

I really like this Goulash.  But I don't see where anyone said it was Hungarian?  I had to cut it in half too, and also just added a little Italian Seasoning.  The full amount of the Italian Seasoning was too much for me.

My mom used to make this when I was a kid, but she lost the recipe and couldn't remember what all she put in it.  I've been searching for the right recipe forever, and this tastes just like I remember.  The first time I made this it was an instant favorite for one of my sons.

It's very close to what I remember having as a kid in Oklahoma.  I personally don't care for the Italian Seasoning in it (like another reviewer, I think it makes it taste too much like spaghetti), so on the next go around, I'll omit that and probably put in a bit of chili powder, green pepper and Worcestershire sauce. But, this recipe is still good, but not exactly what I was looking for - but it got me closer than any other recipe has so far!
And, for what it's worth, in the 70's the Betty Crocker cookbook had a similar recipe (with celery, maybe I'll add that too) called Goulash, so all goulash is not cream based Hungarian.  This one is all American.

My husband I have very different ideas of goulash. His has corn, mine has kidney beans. (I won) So we split the recipe in half (too much for my family) and followed it accordingly. I drained the diced tomatoes and added a can of chopped green chiles and kidney beans for myself. YUM!

This was great...made 1/2 a recipe..added corn 'cause that's how we used to have it, cooked macaroni before adding to mixture, didn't have tomato sauce, so I used tomato juice and added 1 T sugar..served goulash over mashed potatoes.  Ate it with buttered bread and sliced sharp cheddar cheese.  Thanks for the recipe.

Quite tasty and easy to make!

I made it in the slow cooker, on low for two hours or so, and added the pasta and water during the last hour. I used Worcestershire sauce instead of soy, and didn't use the bay leaves. I also halved the recipe except for the pasta! Sprinkled with shredded cheddar! YUM!

Loved it...was perfect for a Sunday dinner while watching football!

Awesome! When I poured in the noodles, I thought 2 cups will not be enough so I added a little more, definitely not needed. 2 cups would have been perfect. This has great taste! And it makes a ton! Good have people over dinner!

This is how I remember Goulash tasting while growing up and also what I fixed for my own kids. Changed only 2 things. Had no tomato sauce so used spaghetti sauce. V8 juice on hand was perfect instead of water.

I'd give this a five-star rating if the original recipe called for things such as diced green pepper to give it more zip. In addition to the pepper suggested by other reviewers, I used El Pato spicy Mexican tomato sauce in place of regular tomato sauce. I also zapped the sauce with cayenne and crushed red pepper since we require spicy food. And instead of the full dose of soy sauce, I did half and used worschestire for the other half. Finally, I stirred in some shredded cheddar cheese. With these minor modifications, I'd say it's a keeper.

I debated about the rating on this recipe.  It's probably really good to someone who hadn't had it or had a version similar to it.  To me it was very bland and tasteless as well as too liquidy.  I grew up in Kansas; our family recipe has chili powder and cayenne as well as paprika in it.  It is thicker and very, very hot.  You add a spoonful of sour cream to temper the heat.

First, this is a great meal.  Second, I have to admit I did not make it as stated in the recipe.  I used 1/2 onion, added beef boullion cubes to the water, skipped the salt, and used worchestershire sauce in place of soy sauce. I used one can each of the tomato sauce and diced tomatoes and added a can of kidney beans.  I also skipped the bay leaves and used a little more than one cup of macaroni.  Definitely will make again, but will add a little more liquid next time.

This was fantastic...  Just the right combination of spices!  I had to make some alterations based on what I had available (only 1 can tomato sauce, garlic & onion diced tomatoes, and 3 cups gluten free mac)

Think of this as a homemade, slighty soupier Hamburger Helper. But it is VERY GOOD. People get hung up on names, Goulash or not, this is good and simple. Kids will love to make this, it's a great beginner's dish.

I made this today and thought the flavor was great, even though I didn't have any bay leaves.  I cut the recipe in half and am glad I did or I would be eating it for days!  With a little more garlic and Italian seasoning, it would be a good spaghetti sauce.

I'm in love with who ever posted this recipe!!

I have 3 small children, including a 4 year old and 2 year old twins so dinner time is always a challenge and I always feel like there's at least one kid that we're fighting to eat.  Tonight the table was silent except for the clinking of spoons to bowls....awesome!  For that reason alone I would give it 100 stars if I could.

 I made it just as the directions instructed except that I cooked the noodles on the side because this made a large portion and I plan on freezing the leftovers for next week and probably even the week after.  This is another huge plus for a mom of 3 young children.  I agree the green pepper would probably be a good addition.  

As a child this was always a staple in our house although my mom's was always more dry....this one was perfect!

Made this tonight and loved how easy and quick it was to make.  I didn't have onions so I used minced and only one package of onion soup mix.  Hubby first said needed something more but went he went for his second bowl it said it was just right.  This one  is a keeper.

yummy!!!  I only made a half batch to try using ground turkey.  I ended up having to do a lot of substitution because I just did not have some of the items, but BOY was this good!  I did cut back on the seasoning salt to 1 teaspoon (made 1/2 batch), used fresh diced tomatoes and tomato soup rather than sauce and canned tomatoes and 1/2 cup green onions and sub dry minced onion for the rest (again for 1/2 batch) and I think I will take the suggestion of adding in some bell pepper. I cannot wait to make a full batch when it gets colder out and possibly freeze this... if there is any left.  Has anyone tried freezing a batch?  Any tips on this, like not cooking noodles completely, or should this not be frozen at all?

I made the recipe as is and it  was a bit salty for our taste.  Next time I will use half the seasoned salt and I think it will be 5 stars for us.  Very easy to prepare and quite tasty!!  Thanks for sharing your recipe Pat!!!

Made this for my family last night and got RAVE reviews! It is an excellent base recipe that was easily tweaked. I made it with 1lb of ground turkey and 1lb of italian sausage, I also added some heat with hot sauce and crushed red pepper and it was delish! I kept all the cooking times and the pasta turned out perfect. Will definitely make this in the future!

Forgot the bay leaves, was hurrying. It was tasty without them, but I didn't have plain diced tomatoes, I had Italian Tomatoes/my favorite to use. They were tasty and fine to use. Also doubled the noodle amount, because there was so much meat. Plenty to share with family. 
Good recipe. : )

This is American goulash. This is what my mother made when I was growing up and se called it goulash. It's a very kid-friendly recipe (my 2-yr-old ate it up) and very simple. I added & adjusted a little to it b/c the recipe seemed a bland to me. I did as others suggested and used Worstershire sauce instead of soy sauce due to preference and added chopped green bell pepper and roasted red pepper (b/c I had them on hand). When serving, I added shredded cheese and sour cream. It's a keeper in our household. Good recipe!

My mom was from MN and I grew up in CT and I ate a few different versions of this dish.  It was on the public school lunch menu as American Chop Suey and mom called it Slumgullion at our house.  I season as I go from meat to veggies and don't do the soy sauce or tomato sauce.  I make it w/ all diced tomatoes.  When I'm trying to watch the red meat intake I do half lean ground beef and a can of rinsed Great Northern beans.  The tomatoes help make the beans look like macaroni.
Very comforting nostalgia meal for me in the fall.  Mom would serve it with bread and butter on the side:lol:

While nowhere near what I've eaten (or made) as "goulash" - which is a Hungarian dish and doesn't even remotely resemble this dish - this IS, however, a delicious version of what we grew up in New England calling "American Chop Suey" (granted, it has nothing whatsoever to do with being either Chop Suey or resembling Chinese food, either).  That said, despite the bizarre names - it's still yummy and easy and nourishing on a cold night - and good for leftovers, too.  This one's a keeper for me.

Easy family dinner that freezes well! I make a big batch and just thaw and heat on practice/game nights! Instead of using the spices listed, I simply throw in a french onion soup packet to crank up the flavor! A family favorite for us!

My late mother made something similar to this many times when I was growing up, except she called it "Lob Lolly."  She didn't use garlic cloves, but powder.  She definitely would use bell pepper in the cooking process and sometimes a stalk or 2 of celery.  She'd serve it with "something green" on the side and sometimes brown and serve rolls.  Simple dish, but very filling and satisfying!

Yummmmmy, very good, almost like my mom's, she used paste instead of sauce.  did not add as much spices and mixed the soy with worch. sauce just not as much.  Will make this again.  also added a green and red pepper and poured it over the noodles.

Have been making a similar version for 50 years.  I use onions, green peppers, Italian seasoning, Mrs. Dash, Cajun seasoning to taste and the tomato sauce.  In my Vita Mix, I zap the canned tomatoes and add to the sauce.  Actually, this is very similar to my spaghetti sauce.  I add a jar of RAGU for extra body and flavor.  This  basic sauce is great over any kind of pasta.  Garlic is not one of my family's favorites, so I use garlic powder.

This is the goulash my husband grw up with.  I made him the goulash I grew up with and his reaction was....
Mine was nothing more than bacon, stewed tomatoes and cream corn, heated through and served with buttered bread.  It is actually very good.

Great weeknight staple! To save time, I often just use a jar of marinara in lieu of the tomato sauces and spices. Also, to add a little something extra, this recipe is great with one can each of drained corn and dark red kidney beans.

Made a lot like my mother taught me except we didn't use any soy sauce. We also used to like to melt some Velveeta cheese into it, this makes it extra yummy!!

I made this in the crockpot which was super easy.  It was a little too water-y but that could be because I didn't measure the water I just used the can that the tomato sauce was in and guessed.  I added a green pepper which was a nice addition, as well I am not a huge onion fan so only added 1 large onion and a stalk of celery, diced.  I would make this again and reduce the Italian seasoning.

i used stewed tomatoes since thats what i had and i added a can of ranch style beans to help it stretch. i dont think i used a tablespoon of salt and i used reduced sodium soy sauce. i dont have italian seasoning so i shook same basil rosemary and garlic in. i drained my tomatoes too. very good just like i remember my moms goulash. i liked that this will feed everyone tomorrow night too.

I am on low sodium diet so I have been experimenting with de-salting certain recipes, and this one was perfect!

To start, halve the recipe. Good enough for two. 
1 lb. Lean ground beef (93/7)
1/2 medium yellow onion chopped as course as you like
4 medium cloves of garlic minced (2+Tbsp)
1 3/4 cups water
1 8oz. Can of NO SALT ADDED tomato sauce
1-2 fresh Roma tomatoes finely diced
1 Tbsp. Thyme
1 Tbsp. Oregano
1 Tbsp. Basil
1 Tbsp. Paprika
   (Italian seasoning would probably work fine)
   I used larger quantities of the individual spices to help add kick and flavor without adding sodium. 
1 bay leaf
1 Tsp. Kosher salt (more or less depending on your sodium resrictions)
Fresh ground black pepper to taste
1 1/4 elbow macaroni

Otherwise follow cooking directions. I did reduce first simmer to 15 minutes, and after adding pasta, only cooked for 11 minutes - al dente (otherwise too mushy)

This turned out delicious! Exactly what I was craving!

I think it called for a little too much Italian seasoning. Next time I will try it with less and with sausage and a bit of wine instead of ground beef.

Excellent simple dish to prepare and extremely tasty.  I made it as written, but "threw in the kitchen sink" of veggies I was accumulating in small amounts:  mushrooms, half a red pepper, half a yellow pepper (I believe peppers are essential); skipped the water and made the gluten free noodles on the side - it's a perfect GF meal as well, as long as you are sure the soy sauce is GF. Appreciate the recipe.  It will be a standard in the box!

This was "ok" in my book - didn't have much flavor, and I made it exactly as listed. When reheating leftovers, my husband added come chili pepper and it tasted "better" but still needed something. Sorry.

This was very good, much like my Mother's.  I did add green pepper and I used worchestershire sauce instead of soy sauce.  My seemed drier then what I remembered from my Mother's so I added more diced tomatoes.  Family just loved it.  I will be making this again very soon.  Thanks for the recipe.

My husband and I both enjoyed this easy dish. I made a few changes, though.
I seasoned the beef with a little salt, pepper and garlic powder while I browned it and I used vegetable broth instead of water.
Yum!

Good, made as directed, except 1/2'd the recipe. Little too salty, IF I made it again, i would cut the salt in half, but I honestly don't think I'd make it again unless hubby had a craving (which is why I made it in the first place)

I have never tried Goulash before but this was tasty, This is the way I make chilly all you needed was the red beans. My German friend made Hungarian goulash it tasted way different and it wasn't made with ground beef.

Easy and good.  My teenagers loved it.  The only change I made was to double the macaroni.  Since I made 1/2 recipe, the high sided skillet I chose was big enough.  Guess what I'm having for lunch today?

I tried this and didn't think of it as Goulash at all it was more like Johnny Marzetti.  I added a half cup of chopped green peppers for more taste.  Iwould have added chopped hot pepppers if hubby could have eaten them.  Diane Westfall

this is by far one of the simplest, tastiest recipes I have had from a web site in many a moon.  It was absolutely delicious and the only minor change was in the salt - I chose to taste and it was perfect. Cudos to the original chef pathunt.

Great recipe, but I added a can of corn, a bell pepper, and some cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit. When it was done cooking, I stirred in a bunch of shredded cheese as well.

Just made this recipe tonight and my family loved it. I made just as the recipe called for where I could but did not have soy sauce so i used worchestershire sauce. I will also try original way but it was just as great tonight. I did add green peppers as other reviewers suggested but you could alter this recipe many ways with what you would like to add. It is definitely going in my regular cycle of meals!

Just like my mother used to make when I was little - I like to think of it as Dutch Goulash (made in Michigan) Filling low-cost food.  You can use spaghetti sauce, too!

I got this recipe from my Nebraska mother and have made it for almost 50 years.  WE call it "Yankee Doodle Beef".  Also, I don't use Italian seasoning or tomato sauce.  Just tomatoes, Worcestershire sauce, garlic and celery.  Great leftovers.

I left out the water and used 1 lb. ground beef and 1 lb. sweet sausage. Instead of the soy sauce I used 1/4 cup of red wine. I cooked the elbow macaroni seperate, then combined the hot sause and drained macaroni.

I liked this a lot! My husband has bugged me for years to make goulash. I had never had it! Next time, I will put 2 cups water instead of 3 and a little less seasoning. I will also add a green pepper.

this is really the good. the whole family liked it.  the last time I made it, it seemed a little salty, not sure if that was my fault or not so I'm cutting back the salt while making it today.  Excellent classic midwest dish.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

This recipe calls for too much water. If I make it again I would add more fresh Italian Seasoning and no water or perhaps 1/2 cup of water. Also would add garlic powder and parmesan cheese. (not use the garlic clove) I added one can of corn which was good. It just seemed to be to watery and lacking something.

I made as is, but added a small can of mushrooms, drained.  It was good and reminded me of what my Mom made growing up, but as suggested I'm going to swap the soy for worchestire next time as it was lacking something small and this may be it.

My version was good. I didn't follow the directions exactly. I used a pound of ground beef and a pound of italian sausage. Though it would add a little extra flavor. I also subbed 1 can tomato sauce for 1 14 oz jar of prego. I think that added to the flavor as well. I browned the beef/sausage with the onions and garlic then added the remainder of the ingredients. In order to save time I added all the ingredients in at once after the beef/sausage had browned and cooked 25 min uncovered. I used only 2 1/2 cups water and could have gone with 1/2 cup less. It turned out very favorful and with a little kick. Just a little watery for my taste.
