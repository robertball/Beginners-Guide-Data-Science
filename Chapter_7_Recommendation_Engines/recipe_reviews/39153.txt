Everyone loved it.  However, The recipe doesn't give you a real clear idea of how a cheesecake should be made.  If you click on "advice" on allrecipes main page and then go to "baking" and then under "articles" click on "sublime cheesecakes" there is so much great information. It tells you never to use cream cheese unless it's at room temp.  And when you're done baking the cheesecake turn off the oven and let it sit for an hour in the oven.  Some people had problems with cooking times but if you do this your cheesecake will be done just right. Lastly, it tells you how to bake it with a water bath.  All of this advice really does lead to a great cheesecake with no cracking for whatever recipe you decide to use.

I've made this cheesecake twice.  The first time I followed the instructions exactly, and I had a few problems.  The middle was undercooked, the crust was a little soggy and lacked flavor, and the filling was a little bland.  So, I made a bunch of changes for my second try.  I cooked it about 10 minutes longer.  I used a gingersnap crust (from this site's Pumpkin Cheesecake with Gingersnap Crust recipe).  I added a lot more cinnamon and nutmeg, and I also added about 1 12 tsp of cloves and 14 tsp of ginger.  Also, I only made half the amount of sour cream topping.  It turned out SO much better the second time.  It had a really great flavor (the crust made a huge difference), and the consistency was great.  People raved about it.  I would definitely make it again and again with these alterations.

I was worried after baking for 60 minutes that it wasn't cooking all the way through despite cracking around the edges.  I proceeded with the sour cream topping anyways and returned it to the oven for 5 min. per the directions.  I discovered that if you let it cool at room temperature for an hour or so, it will continue to set.  It's best not to immediately transfer it to the fridge to cool.  I tested it with a knife in the middle and it came out clean!  Whew!

Sinfully good.  Make this for just about every occassion at work and if I don't, they want to know why I didn't!!  The only thing I do is sprinkle some cinnamon on top of the sour cream topping before I bake it.  It adds some color to an otherwise blah top!

FANTASTIC! This got rave reviews at Thanksgiving. I used gingersnaps for the crust instead of graham crackers and that was delicious. And I also didn't make the sour cream topping. I left it as is and just put whipped cream on top when I served it, and I think that made it just perfect. My only other tip is once the cheesecake is done baking, turn your oven off and let it cool inside the oven. This should help prevent any cracks.

This was the first time I every made pumpkin cheesecake and have to say it was quite simple.  My guest, including my friend who is a cook, all said it was great.  I didn't have a spring form pan so I used two six-inch piecrusts, which saved a little time from having to make the crust.  The batter was exactly enough for both pies.  The sour cream toping was more than enough, so I would recommend only using half the required amount. I will definitely make this again.

I'm studying in Scotland for a year, but met up with other Americans for Thanksgiving.  I wanted to make a pumpkin cheesecake, but I couldn't find canned pumpkin here!  I used this recipe, substituting two large sweet potatoes (baked, peeled, and pureed) in place of the pumpkin. It turned out great!

I made this last year for a Thanksgiving "pot-luck" dinner at work, and it got rave reviews! One coworker even asked if I would make two for him for Thanksgiving, and he said he would even pay me for them! I thought it could use a little "kick" in the spice area too, so I made my crust with gingersnaps. Yum yum!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit. Almost everyone that ate it asked for the recipe. Even people that didn't like pumpkin desserts loved this one. It was easy and delicious!! I'll definately make it again and again!!

WONDERFUL!  I made this for Thanksgiving 2010, and everyone raved how good it was.  I wish I had remembered to take a picture before it was gone, but will next time.  Can't think of anything to change, and loved that the top didn't crack like most of the cheesecakes I have made before have.

*Update* Made this again for late Dec. 2010.  Used the limited edition Gingerbread Graham Crackers for the crust, made it even more tasty.  If you can find them I suggest trying those since it compliments the pumpkin spices well.

Very good!  My 2 year old son threw a fit while getting into our van on the way to Grandma's house for Thanksgiving and stomped on it leaving a big foot print, and people still couldn't stop eating it!  Kinda gross, but the cheesecake was great!

Wow, this came out better than I could hope for.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was restaurant quality!  It does make a lot and the graham cracker crust doesn't begin to cover it, but when you take it out of the springform pan, it looks so pretty to see the three layers.  This is a keeper and won't disappoint you!

This was my first cheesecake and it turned out awesome!! Flavor was excellent. I did add additional spices though. Texture was perfect and had no cracks at all! Next time I'm going to try a gingersnap crust and garnish with pecans.

Great recipe. I made the crust out of 3/4 cup of graham cracker crumbs and 3/4 cup of crushed ginger snaps. Amazing! I did use a water bath to bake the cake and I let it set inside the oven after I turned it off. I use this recipe every Thanksgiving and Christmas and it is a huge hit!

followed it exactly, It's ok.  Not exceptional like I expected.  My regular cheese cake recipe doesn't use flour or corn startch like this one.  I like a silky custard texture, not grainy.

The only substitution I made in this recipe was the fact that I only had turbinado sugar (which is already a little like granulated brown sugar) and I didn't make the sour cream topping, which I didn't find was necessary.  It came out wonderfully, and the instructions were very easy to follow!

This was a pretty easy recipe to follow and tends to not crack as easily as most cheesecake that I make.  I made a batch of this pumpkin cheesecake and a batch of white chocolate cheesecake and swirled them over a custom pecan/gingersnap crust that I made up on my own.  I added a lot more pumpkin pie spice, ginger, cloves and nutmeg than the recipe called for.

I made this cheesecaske for the first time as a trial run for Thanksgiving.  I sent it to work with my husband and asked him to have the guys there tell me their honest opinion.  At first they told him I would have to make 4 or 5 more to give an honest opinion (just because they wanted more).  But it got rave reviews.  So I have the second one in the oven now so I can try it for myself.  But according to my husband it is sooooooo good.

This was amazing!! I will be making this every year. My advice to anyone making this is you need 2 Large pie crusts, or 1/2 the recipe if you only have one pie crust. I made tarts with the remaining pie fulling.

This cheesecake was AWESOME! I did however make a couple of changes. Instead of evaporated milk I used condensed and instead of the spices it requested I used 2 1/2 tbsp of pumpkin pie spice. Make sure you do let it chill over night.

This has become a staple for fall around my house.  EVERYONE asks for it, and even though I have given out the recipe, no one will make it for fear of it not turning out.  This is one of those recipes that make people think I am a total rockstar in the kitchen.

Believe the hype--this thing is so good. It tastes like a very rich pumpkin pie. I didn't use the sour cream frosting and glad I didn't. I did add an extra 1/2 tsp each of nutmeg and cinnamon to spice it up, and followed the "How to Bake A Cheesecake" to the letter and it came out so good. Key points: Use room temp cream cheese. Use a water bath (wrap the bottom of your cheesecake in aluminum foil so water does not seep into pan and then place in a cookie sheet. Pour water in cookie sheet and watch the level the entire time you cook and add as necessary), and after the cheesecake is done baking according to the time here, turn off oven and leave in oven for 1 hr.

This was an incredible cheesecake!  After searching others and seeing they were not nearly as thick, I decided on this and was not disappointed!  The only changes I made was to substitute crushed butter cookies (with cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice) for the graham cracker crumbs, and omitted the sour cream topping....replaced with whipped cream.  This has a pumpkin pie taste in a cheesecake consistency.  EVERYONE LOVED IT!

This was excellent and simple. Be sure to use a water bath and be sure that the foil has no leaks. When done baking, turn oven off, crack door and let it cool for an hour. So good!

Absolutely incredible; the guests' favorite on the dessert buffet.  Just a few changes/additions: 1) per others' suggestions, I used the crust from the recipe with the gingersnap crust; 2) I definitely recommend a water bath; 3) if you whip the egg whites separately and then fold them in just before pouring in the pan, you'll get the same richness with a lighter texture; 4) I used fresh pumpkin instead of canned (sorry, Libby's, but I can't buy your product in Russia!); 5) I baked for an hour, left in the turned off oven for another half hour, and then turned the oven back on to bake for a few minutes after adding the topping (I only needed about 1/4th of the sour cream recipe).  If I do it again, I will refrigerate the cheesecake uncovered for long enough that the sour cream hardens, so that saran wrap will peel off the top nicely when it's serving time.  And I loved the idea of topping the sour cream with a cinnamon dusting to make it prettier!

Yummm! I love the combo of the pumpkin filling with the sour cream topping. I made a gingersnap crust instead of the traditional graham cracker one and used 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. It was very good!

This is very, very yummy! I would probably half the sour cream topping next time, as it just about over-filled the pan (put it on a pizza sheet when it went back into the oven). I did add a little bit of ground clove, and if you're looking for more of a pumpkin pie taste, you'll want to add more spices. As is, this is a surprisingly light and creamy cheesecake with a mild pumpkin taste. I had to cook the sour cream part for about 15 minutes, then I turned off the oven and let it sit for about 30 minutes. I cooled on a rack for another 30 and then into the fridge for about 4 hours. It was perfectly cooked through and ready to eat. I will definitely be making this for our Holiday dinner!

Fabulous!!  This pumpkin cheesecake offers the perfect blend of pumpkin and cream cheese flavor and a very smooth texture.  But I confess to adding 1/2 tsp of ginger to the filling--no pumpkin recipe will do without it!!

I followed the exact recipe on this except for substituting the ginger snaps for the crust.  For some reason it came out like pudding.  I'll try another recipe next time.

Excellent! Made gingersnap crust. (Sub gingersnaps for grahams and sugar) Great flavor. Will definitely make again. Family request. My dad was too full to eat a whole piece and only had a little taste. Next day he requested more cheesecake because the flavor was so good he wanted more !!

The best ever Pumpkin Cheescake!  I find though that i always need to add a little extra cornstarch (1-2 TBS).  And i find that adding a tsp of Cinn. & nutmeg to the crust gives it a little extra flavor.

With a few easy changes this recipe is AMAZING! First, I used 1 1/2 t of Pumpkin Pie spice instead of the recommended spices to give it a more 'pumpkin pie flavor'. I also did a gingersnap crust which really added to the overall taste and spice. I only ended up using about 1/2-2/3 of the sour cream topping.
Overall- delicious, had rave reviews on Thanksgiving and for Christmas Eve!

This is a good cheesecake, but has a very mild pumpkin taste, and not a traditional cheesecake consistancy.  I think I will try a couple more eggs and up the pumpkin a bit.  Also needs more spice - will try pumpkin pie spice next time.  Lastly, the cooking time wasn't adequate for me.  With other 9" cheesecakes, I typically bake at 325 for 90 min, I think that would have worked better with this recipe.

I actually made this back at Thanksgiving and it got rave reviews, including a hug from one person who wondered why I made him eat the rest of the meal when he could just enjoy this!  I did use a gingersnap crust from another recipe though - and would HIGHLY recommend others do so too!

My first ever pumpkin cheesecake and oh-my-gosh my toes tingled when I first tasted it.  This was easy and excellent. Only thing I changed was to add more cinnamon than the recipe calls for (I always do), but other than that, I followed exactly.  The other reviewers complain about cracking and jiggling - this must be a temperature gauge problem with their ovens, or they might want to try a water bath with the cheesecake  every time I do it that way, I never have a problem.  Also, take it out when the middle is just a LITTLE jiggly and it will continue to set once out of the oven.  At first I wasn't sure about the topping, but once I whipped it up and tasted it before putting on the cake, I knew I had to use it.  It offers a nice flavor combination with the dessert.  So good I'm making it again !

I followed the directions exactly, but it didn't cook all the way & didn't look very good. I made this for thanksgiving but no one wanted it.  It didn't taste good either. I made this one because I had something similiar at the Cheesecake Factory, but this wasn't what I thought it would be.

This was good but the crust was a little hard.  I don't know if I over cooked it but next time I won't put sugar in the crust.  I also didn't put the sour cream stuff on top.  This had a nice taste and texture and I will make it again minus the sugar in the crust.

Everyone loved this! Used a little extra graham cracker for the crust because we prefer thick crust. Also made whipped cream with some pumpkin spice and brown sugar to top it off-excellent!!

The taste of this cheesecake was great. I'm just a beginer at making cheesecakes so the middle of mine wasn't done even though it craked in the oven. I'm not going to give up! Practice make perfect.

WONDERFUL! Nothing but compliments on Christmas day. I found it easy to make, but it took a lot longer to bake than I thought. I didn't do the sour cream topping, but it wasn't needed. I'll do this again next year!

Followed suggestions to cook in a water bath and let cool in oven for an hour. I let it set in fridge overnight but not sure what happened because when we sliced it up it wasnt all the way cooked! So disappointing! The flavor was good though and I especially liked the sour cream topping. Will cook longer on next try.

The only thing I changed on this recipe was using Gingersnaps instead of Grahams for the crust, which was good.  I found this recipe good, but for me it was more of a pumpkin pie filling than cheesecake.  I used a mini cheesecake pan and baked it in a bath, it still cracked a little...but not too bad.

Yummy! This is a great recipe. I used sugar snap cookies as suggested by others and that really put this over the top! I also used pumpkin pie spice, as that was what I had on hand and it worked out great!  I also 1/2 the sourcream topping, because it had mixed reviews, but oh my goodness, the topping is a real treat and balances out the pumpkin taste/spices. Great recipe!   I would suggest spraying the springform pan next time and I also cooked this cheesecake in a water bath, as I do with all the cheesecakes I make so they dont crack. Great seasonal recipe!

This recipe was delicious! It tasted a lot like pumpkin pie. I skipped the sour cream topping and instead topped it with Chocolate Ganache from this site and it was heavenly! Even the members of my family who don't like cheesecake enjoyed it.

The texture on this was way too soft and wet. I cooked it an extra 10 minutes (and I know my oven temperature is correct...thermometer), left it in the oven for an hour to cool and after that on the counter to cool for an hour then in the refrigerator overnight. 
Cooking it further at that temp would have made it crack (it was already cracking on the edges). 
Next time I make it I will either cut out the evaporated milk, add an egg, or both. 
I added more spices and used a gingersnap crust. Without those two changes I think it would have been very bland. 
I'm not sure the sour cream topping added a whole lot. Next time I will do the maple pecan glaze on top of that.
Or maybe just try another recipe :)

We thought the sour cream layer on top was kind of strange at first, but IMO it really adds to/brings out the flavor of the pumpkin. This is a fairly light cheesecake, as far as cheesecakes go. It's not as dense as a classic cheesecake. 

We read other reviews and did use a water bath to prevent cracking (wrapping the spring form pan in aluminum foil and placing it in a rotisserie pan with a 1/2 inch of boiling water - see videos on youtube), and it did not crack. 

This is really a delicious recipe as written without adding any other rich flavors or other spices. We are thinking of making it again for Thanksgiving this year in lieu of the traditional pumpkin pie.

Surprisingly, everyone in my family LOVED this cheesecake. My father did not think he would like it, but he devoured it. I, however, was not a big fan of this cheesecake (and I am the cheesecake monster in my house!). There was a slightly strange taste that I just did not care too much for. Overall, this is a good, solid, easy to follow recipe that I will use again and again (everyone, absolutely everyone loved it!).

Needs a lot more pumkin pie spices. I added a tsp of pps and a half tsp of ginger to the cinnamon and nutmeg. Could use close to double that. I taste mainly cream cheese. The topping doesn't add anything to the flavor. Otherwise, the texture is great and the graham cracker crust is perfect.

I made this cheesecake for Thanksgiving and both mine and my husband's family loved it! In fact, my brother in law was raving about it at work a few weeks later! I made a "trial" one two weeks before Thanksgiving with the gingerbread crust and was told to stick with a graham cracker crust. There is no need to add the extra spices as this is a CHEESECAKE and should have a lighter flavor than a pumpkin pie. I did not add the sour cream topping but will try it next time. LOVE THIS CHEESECAKE and it is now a holiday tradition!!

great cheesecake! I added 1 tsp ginger to the crust just to perk it up a bit. I didn't have all of the spices, so used 3 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice. perfect!

Not too strong of a pumpkin flavor, I don't like pumpkin pie, but everyone loved this! I only used 1 8oz container of sour cream and used Pecan Sandy cookies instead of graham crackers in the crust. Everyone was raving! You won't have leftovers!

I love this recipe, I make it every year for thanksgiving and the family loves it too. I do make a few minor changes/additions. I make the crust a mixture of graham and gingersnap. Also, I put a little cinnamon on top of the sour cream topping along with some chopped pecans.

This is obviously enough for two pies. I cheated and used a pre-made graham cracker crust. The pie turned out perfect. The sour cream topping can be cut in half as other members have stated. I added toasted peacans and cinnimon to the top. Be sure to cook this in a water bath for even cooking.

I have made this recipe several times and have had mostly success with it, though I did make a few changes.  I found the flavors a little bland, so I added a teaspoon or so of pumpkin pie spice as well as some extra cinnamon.  Depending on the thickness of the springform pan, this cheesecake also can be gooey in the middle and overcooked on the outside.  I chose to make several small cheesecakes instead.  Additionally, I found that a gingersnap crust made this cheesecake even more flavorful.

Great recipe! I do not cheesecake or pumpkin but this recipe I eat and it is so good!I have made this Pumpkin Chessecake six different times. I follow the steeps up the number four and leave out step five.  I did try with step and I really think it was really that good the white sauce on top. It takes the taste away from the pumpkin.

My family usually unofficially names a dessert at our Thanksgiving as the best, and I won!  This recipe was great, everyone who tried it loved it,
especially my husband.  I'm making it for another family gathering at Christmas, at my husband's request!

One of the most requested cheesecakes I make! The only change I make is using flour instead of cornstarch. And maybe adding more cinnamon and nutmeg then what is called for.

This was my first crack at making a cheesecake and the only problem I had was getting it cooked through.  I did add some cooking time, got some cracking on the top, but the middle was still did not set up properly.  Other than that, it had a very nice flavor, the sour cream topping was a nice addition, and it yields a large cheesecake that is perfect for a medium sized crowd.

I wanted to make a pumpkin cheesecake instead of pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving and chose this one for its relative ease. I made a gingersnap cookie crust instead of graham crackers.It didn't taste like cheesecake. It didn't taste like pumkin either. The sour cream topping helped it taste more like cheesecake, but the pie itself did not. That was dissapointing. I don't think I will make this again. It didn't taste bad. I am just looking for something different.

Unbelievable cheesecake!  Creamy, delicious and
full of flavor.  The sour cream topping gives it 
the final touch!  (We used chocolate graham crackers for the crust.. complemented the cake very well!)

I loved this!  I forgot that you are supposed to use a springform pan, so I ended up making 3 of them in the premade graham cracker crusts.  I brought one to work, one to a family gathering and kept one for my husband and I.  They didn't last long.  And I don't like pumpking pie, but this was awesome!  I will make this again!!

This takes quite a bit of time to make (as do all cheescakes...) but it's well worth it! this was my first time attempting cheesecake and it came out delicious! My guests enjoyed it b/c it wasn't too rich...the sour cream topping wasn't anything special though. Overall it was YUMMY!

I'm known for cooking some good cheesecakes.  This one didn't impress anyone at the table.  I took a hit.  The topping didn't make any sense to the taste pallet, which was scraped off by most.  
will not be making this again.

Mmmmmm!  So good!  Cooked about 10 minutes longer than indicated, and then let it sit in the oven for 55 minutes before adding sour cream topping for 5 more minutes.  Garnished topping with graham cracker crumbs to make it pretty.

This was the first time I have made a home-made cheesecake and can say that it was amazing! I did not have enough time to do the sour cream topping and it still was really good. Next time I will use the sour cream to make it even better. I used the tip for leaving the pie in the oven for an hour after turning off the heat and it turned out with the right consistancy. I am saving this one to add to my favorites.

I originally found this recipe in a magazine and have made it for many years. Everyone loves this cheesecake.  I don't change anything in the recipe.  The sour cream topping is the perfect balance to the pumpkin.  Here's a couple of tips for baking.  Wrap the bottom of the pan with aluminum foil.  I also put the pan in a shallow bed of water.  It really helps to prevent burning the crust.

This has been a family favorite for years! The first time I made it, everyone cringed at the thought  of a "pumpkin" cheesecake! Now I cannot attend a family Thanksgiving without bringing this one! I've also cooked them in individual cupcake holders to take to work, this way its already portioned out!!   Needless to say it's one of those timeless cheesecakes that never gets old!! ENJOY!!

This cheesecake was just okay.  I make quite a few cheesecakes throughout the year and I was really looking forward to this.  Next time, I think I will cook the pumpkin in a pan with the spices before I add it to the mix, because I found that my problem with the taste of this as is, was that it tasted too much like bland canned pumpkin.

My family love this.  I was nervous when the sides looked cracked after baking, but it was find inside.  I didn't have sour cream on hand so I just put whipped cream on top w/ sprinkling of cinnamon instead of recipe topping.

This is such a delicious cheesecake! It has become a Thanksgiving staple in our home. I now have to make two, as everyone wants this instead of other pies. Not everyone likes the sour cream topping, so I make one with and one without. To avoid cracking, I put mine in a water bath while baking and turn off the oven and open the door slightly and let it cool for an hour.

I have tried numerous pumpkin recipes (cakes, cookies, etc.) and this is the best cheesecake!  It is not only thick and beautiful, but also very smooth and yummy!  I did make one error--instead of adding 2/3 of the milk, I added the entire can!  However, the cake was still tastey.  I can't wait to try it the proper way.  Imagine how much more delicious it will be then!!

This was a great recipe and everyone loved it! I made it for Thanksgiving. Instead of a graham cracker crust I made a homemade basic pie crust and I added a little cinnamon and sugar and chopped pecans to the crust. I also ended up adding less sugar to the recipe by mistake. About 1/4 cup less. I added more sugar to the topping to make up for it, and it all balanced out nicely and nobody new the difference. Great recipe!

This was the best cheesecake I've ever eaten, and I'm a cheesecake lover!  The only thing I did different was add about 1 cup of chopped pecans to the crust...it was delectible!!!!  Thanks for sharing this wonderful holiday recipe!  My husband who doesn't care much for cheesecake rated it the best ever too!

My family absolutely adores this cheesecake.. I received nothing but complements... until it was gone that is.. then they wondered why there wasn't anymore...at any rate.. I have made it with a gingersnap crust and with a graham cracker crust and the gingersnap adds that extra zing it needs to spice it up... it's fantastic...

I read one of the reviews given here that says "my toes tingled when I first tasted it", it is absolutely true!!! I took this cheesecake to a Thanksgiving dinner where we silently compete for best dessert and I completely won all the compliments from kids to oldest.  It is a unique taste and texture that almost melts in your mouth, sweetness is perfect.  My husband even said it was one of the best desserts I have ever made.  NOTE:  I added a 1/2 tspn.  of ginger powder to enhance the traditional flavor.

This was the best thing I have ever cooked! I did use a gingersnap cookie crust. Next time I will line cookies around the side of the pan too for a prettier look. I sprinkled cinnamin on the top of the cake. Hubby was really impressed!

This cheesecake was delicious! My one critique was that the recipe was not as thorough as it should be. First, all ingredients should be at room temperature before whipping. Second, beating cream cheese until fluffy can take a long time. I beat for for with a hand mixer 10 minutes and wouldn't have considered it fluffy, but 10 min seemed long enough (and the cooked result was lovely). Lastly, the waterbath method is usually recommended for cheesecakes.  This was my first cheesecake ever and I read up about preparation before I had, had I not had these types, I am not sure it what the result would have been.  I sprinkled the finish cake with a light dusting of apple pie spice, and sprayed the outer edge with whipped cream to give it a little extra flair.

I made this for the first time last year for a friend. Based on other's comments, I added ground ginger to the graham cracker crust, and cut the sour cream topping in half. It was spectacular! Easy, delicious, and EVERYONE asked for the recipe.

This recipe was awesome. This was my first time making a cheesecake and it came out great. I used the gingersnaps and crushed pecans in my crust instead of graham crackers. I also used cool whip on the top and omitted the sour cream as others suggested. I used some of the lefotover pecans on top of the coolwhip. I also grated a couple gingersnaps to go on the top as well. Everyone at my job raved about it. Tip: Keep the oven door closed for an hour after turning off the oven. That keeps it from cracking and lets it get done all the way. Taste just as good as the pumpkin cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory!! A keeper...No more Pumpkin Pie at Thanksgiving. This will be our new recipe.

PERFECT!! I followed the directions exactly as they are and left it in the oven for the extra hour with the oven off and it was just perfect. I didnt add the topping but it was still amazing. I would definately recommend this one to everyone, even if you are fond of pumpkin

WONDERFUL!!  I followed the recipe for the cheesecake, but omitted the sour cream topping.  I baked it for an extra ten minutes and used a water bath just like the other reviewers.  After the bake time was over, I left the cheesecake in the oven for an additional hour with the oven off, then let it finish cooling completely on a wire rack.  When it was completely cooled, I put in the fridge for about 18 hours.  People LOVED it!

This was the BEST cheesecake recipe I have ever made!!! I used less of the sour cream topping, and it turned out perfect! I also didn't have any cornstarch, so I used rice flour instead. It still tasted great. I will be making this recipe again in the future.

I made this last year for Thanksgiving (my first ever cheesecake), and got stellar reviews.  My niece (9 yrs) isn't much for cheesecake and insists that it come to Thanksgiving again this year!    The first reviewer mentioned the water bath, and I followed those instructions last year, which I'm sure made a big difference in having a successful cheesecake.  This year I plan to follow the other advice on the Allrecipes website - let the cream cheese sit out first, etc.

This cheesecake was unbelieveable!!!! I made it for the first time for Thanksgiving. I was a bit apprehensive because I like to make a new recipe at least once before serving it at an important family meal like Thanksgiving. Time did not allow for that, so I went cold turkey. Needless to say, the cheesecake turned out beautifully! It was delicious and will be served at our Thanksgiving Dinner from now on!

Mmm Mmm Good!  I served this cheesecake for dessert at Thanksgiving.  My family thought they would prefer pumpkin pie until they tasted this cheesecake!  It won them over with the first bite.  It is the best of both - not too cheese-cakie and better than pumpkin pie.  As Rachel Ray would say, "Yum-O"!

This was a wonderful cheesecake...and I love to make cheesecakes.  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect. I brought it to room temp on the wire rack so I think that helped where people said it wasn't cooked in the center.  The topping on it is wonderful, it's presentation is beautiful and it blew people away this Thanksgiving...perfect!

I made this and EVERYONE loved it!!! they couldn't get enough and was sad when it was gone. The only change I made, because I am kinda lazy, is I used the pre-spiced libby's pumpkin mix, nixed the additional spices, added a few shakes of cinnamon and ginger to the crust and , viola! awesome

I was surprised how much this resembled pumpkin pie - it had much the same texture and flavor. The crust was a disaster, but it may have been my fault. I used crushed gingersnaps, following advice of previous reviews, and when I prebaked the crust it was very puffy and oily - butter was even running out of the pan. Then when the cheesecake was finished the crust was hard and oily at first, and then got mushy pretty fast. May be my fault - would definitely try grahams next time. Didn't much care for the topping.. maybe would cut in half. Good flavor, but not completely what I expected.

I used cinnamon snap cookie crumbs in place of the graham cracker crumbs and all low fat ingredients. I wouldn't recommend low fat for this cake though. The middle of my cake had a big indent in it where the sour cream topping had sunk in (and I had it spread evenly over the cake right to the edges). I guess the cake wasn't firm enough to hold the weight of the sour cream and the sour cream wasn't thick enough to spread smoothly and evenly over the cake. It was way too much topping anyway - next time I would cut that part of the recipe in half.

Cheesecakes are requested birthday cakes with my family, so I fix them often. I substituted gingersnaps ground up in my food processor for the grahm crackers with wonderful results.  This cheesecake deserved 10 stars, it was that great! We now have a new favorite flavor of cheesecake that will show up on future birthdays.  Libbys recipes are always winners!  Thank you!

It was easy to make and tasted good but not as "pumpkiny" as I thought it would be.

I have been making this cheesecake every Thanksgiving for three years now.  Everyone else's dessert contributions get left in the dust.  This cheesecake recipe is perfection except for crust is too hard.

Pumpkin cheesecake had a good flavor. I think the crust could have been slightly thicker.  It was good with the sour cream topping.

While I am not a big pumpkin fan, I get requests for this every Thanksgiving and Christmas.  The only modification I make is to use pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual spices listed in the recipe.  Also, I have not had a problem with the center being soggy.  Once the baking time is up, you can turn off the oven but leave the cake in for a little extra time and this may help.

I made this cheesecake for my family for Thanksgiving and they raved about it!  It was my first cheesecake and I thought the recipe was very easy to follow.  I would definitely make it again!

Although I changed this to not include the sour cream, this was a great cheesecake.  Hat's off to the original owner!

This was a great pumpkin cheesecake. I've had pumpkin cheesecake before but this was my first time making it.  The topping is very sweet. I may try it without next time.

I was hoping I could find this recipe online, and I'm so happy that I did.  I lost the Libby's Pumpkin label that it was written on, and my grocery store doesn't have Libby's Pumpkin yet this year.  This is an amazing cheesecake!  Everyone I've made it for loves it!
