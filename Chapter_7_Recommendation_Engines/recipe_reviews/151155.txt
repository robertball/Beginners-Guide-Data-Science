Biko is one of my favorite desserts! This recipe came out tasting better than the biko I buy at the philippino store. Follow these steps to make it authentic: I used only 2 cups of rice (makes plenty) & soaked it for a couple hours in 3 cups water. Make sure you use glutinous rice!  Cooked it with half the can of coconut milk and soaking water. Cook it just like rice till it gets soft and mushy. Used brown sugar,a little less than called for. For topping:instead of preserves,I used macapuno strings (4 tbsp) or more. They're like coconut strings,sooo good. When you remove the biko from oven,it will be slightly soft and a little liquidy. But, when it cools it sets. The finishing touch is brown coconut jam spread on top. I will never buy biko again!!!!

Not sure what "real" biko tastes like.  This wasn't as moist as I expected.  Be sure that your rice is tender - almost soft - as the oven time will dry it out.

I made it in much easier  way, did not use the pot, I soaked sweet rice  in water for almost 2 hours, drained water, mixed everything in the baking dish, baked in 350F for 60 mins came out cooked, then I cooked and put all the toppings, baked for another 5 mins, then broil for 3 mins, it was perfect !

Perfect.  It reunited me with my childhood.  I had soaked dried coconut with the rice.  Thanks so much for the formula.

I agree with Beya.  This recipe could have easily made 2 9x13 pans.  I also just used half of the recipe and it made a hefty 9x13 pan.  I might use a tad less white sugar next time also.  Thank you so much for the recipe.  God bless.

I adjusted to 5 servings, used on 1/2 cup of white and 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and did not use coconut preserve.  It was hard to wait until it cooled so that I could take a bite.  Not bad for my first try at it.

My wife is filipino so I needed a recipe that was good and authentic to the biko from the Philippines. I followed the recipe almost exactly. After I poured the brown sugar mix I added unsweetened shredded coconut over the top. My wife loved it. I make it when ever I go to Philipino gatherings and it's always a hit.
