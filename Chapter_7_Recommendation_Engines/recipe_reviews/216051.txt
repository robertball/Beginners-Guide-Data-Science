I'm not a vegetarian, but had bought a spaghetti squash intending on using it in an Italian dish as it was recommended.  When it came time to cook, though, I wasn't feeling Italian.  I found this recipe and decided to give it a try.  It was AMAZING!  I've never raved about a dish so much before (I've never even left a rating on a past dish, but this one is well worth it).  Instead of the packaged taco seasoning, I used a seasoning found on this site - Taco Seasoning I - it's de'lish!  Everyone loved it, even my skeptical husband.  It will be a regular.

This was excellent!  The only changes I would make next time are to cook the onion and jalapeno in water as i don't think it would make a taste difference and to reduce the squash for awhile as there was quite a lot of liquid which made for soggy taco shells.  Other than that the flavor and texture were amazing, AWESOME alternative to meat or soy/gluten products!

Great recipe!  I added some mushrooms and the veggies from my weight watchers garden veggie soup. Yummy!  I am going to make some veggie enchiladas for dinner out of the leftovers :)

tried b/c of the great reviews. Surprised at how well the squash blended with the taco seasoning... but after that, there isn't much left to be said. Was not impressed with the flavor.

Interesting.  Hard to think it's squash- kinda made me think of refried beans or something.  Tried using the Taco Seasoning I recipe, but that did't turn out right, so added some packaged faita seasoning to it to help.  Husband doesn't like squash in general, and said he though this was a better way to eat it than other ways we've tried.  I wasn't a huge fan, but didn't dislike it either.  Might try again.

Kids wouldn't eat it as prepared. I used the idea and the second time added a can of kidney beans with the taco seasoning. I pureed it all together and it made a fantastic and healthy bean dip. Cheese and sour cream on top and the kids devoured it no problem.

I knew that I couldn't eat the jalapeno, but this recipe looked good anyway. The spaghetti squash I had was rather small, so I only used about half the dry taco seasoning, and served them with grated cheese and chopped Romaine lettuce. I made my own taco shells with preservative-free corn tortillas in a deep fat fryer. Despite all these minor changes, the tacos were quite good. One did not miss the meat. The cheese added a little protein. This is a mild, vegetarian, gluten-free (check the taco seasoning) but not vegan or casein-free version. Quite good. (PS It was still hot enough to bring out a sweat if you are sensitive to chilis.)

This is FABULOUS. I added some garlic to the onion, sauted with the jalapeno. Added a can of black beans at the last minute - great texture and a protein boost. Added a couple of canned chipotles and sauce to the sour cream. Sliced up an avacado and YUM!!!!

So Awesome. Didn't think they would be that great, but the taco seasoning blends well with the squash. I also added chicken, fresh tomatoes and salsa.

This was DELICIOUS! I made a couple modifications. 

Once I added the squash to the onions and added the taco seasoning (I used Old El Paso spicy) I let it cook down quite a bit because all the water came out of the squash and it would have been mushy. 

I didn't put in jalape√±o since the spices were already hot but I added fresh garlic with my onions. I don't shy away from heat but without the fat of ground beef the taco seasoning was actually hot enough.
  
I also just did a soft tortilla and stuffed it with cheese, lettuce, tomato, avocado and sour cream and I topped it off with about a quarter cup of warm chickpeas to make it a little more filling. So good!

This recipe alone I would say made three burrito style tacos once the squash rendered down... even with all the additional fillings. So if you have a couple more people to feed I'd say make two squashes.

I really wanted this to work as we eat tacos once a week and I love trying new things. I followed the recipe and I'm sorry but this was stringy and really mushy and the flavor was overwhelmed with the sweetness of the squash. I love spaghetti squash (and tacos) but this didn't work for us in texture or flavor. I'll stick with my seasoned and fried grains or beans for tacos. Sorry!

I added corn and black bean for more added flavor.  It will all depend on your taco seasoning which will make or break this recipe.

I will likely try it again with a few adjustments.  I like the ideas of adding beans and corn.  My issue was opposite some others - the taco seasoning packet was too overwhelming for the size of squash I had, so I actually added water to the recipe (since you would usually add water to the packet when making it with beef).  My children were not interested in trying, but I love the idea someone posted about turning it into a bean dip.  I may do that with the leftovers!

Great recipe.  I used chili powder, cumin and Mexican oregano rather than the taco seasoning.  
I also added a can of Hunt's fire roasted, diced tomatoes.  Thanks

This had an excellent flavor, and could be used as a side dish instead of a taco filling if you choose.  I think, however the taco seasoning should be doubled, or only 1/2 a large spaghetti squash be used.  Because the measurement of a squash is an estimate, and of the ease of the dish, I rated it the highest rating!  I loved it!

I really wanted to love this.  I used left over squash and made my own taco seasoning (from this site).  The recipe as written is very bland.  The taco seasoning doesnt mask the sweetness of the squash.  I managed to salvage the meal by adding mushrooms, pinto beans and mozzarella cheese.

these were so good, it was weird. I made the spaghetti squash a week before, and it was still good. We used ground beef with it too. I suggest grating mild cheddar for it, it just melts better than pre-shredded, and it made a big difference. I also used 1/2 a bell peper. My 6 year old loved them.

This was a very delicious and has a unique taste....   substituted the jalapeno pepper using habanero sauce and was very pleased how it turned out.  We also prepared it with seasoned beef, graded cheese, tomatoes, spinach and sour cream was very tasty. Will make again!

I enjoyed these tacos immensely. It is the combination of the corn tortilla, salt, squash and sour cream that makes the dish. Without any one of those it just wouldn't taste the same. I added some sharp cheddar and they were even better. Great vegetarian recipe. For ease, I combined the onions, jalapenos, squash, taco seasoning and cheese in the pan to blend the mixture. Then stuffed it into the torillas and topped with sour cream. Thank you jfresh. I've made it 3 times in the past 2 weeks. Extra salsa is also good.

These were excellent!!! We love spaghetti squash & are always looking for new ways to have it. We had the tacos with salsa, sour cream & avocado. The squash/onion mixture would be great with pretty much any other added veggies (bell peppers, mushrooms,etc)! We'll be having this recipe often!!

Yum!!!!  I really liked these.  Only thing I did different is made my own seasoning.  I don't do packages.    Going to try the leftovers in enchiladas tomorrow.

The taco seasoning is definitely going to determine the outcome of your recipe.  I used Old El Paso taco seasoning and made the recipe as is with hard tacos, sour cream, and cheddar cheese.  It was outstanding!  My only complaint is that it is entirely too hot for my taste, but my husband told me it was the perfect amount of heat.  I would only use 1/2 (maybe even 1/3) of the jalapeno next time.  Otherwise, this dish is great, and healthy!

The tacos were delicious! I prepared Taco Seasoning 1 from this site, I left out the jalapeno, but added a can of black beans. Only used half the squash otherwise would have been too much. Topped the taco with salsa, shredded cheese and lettuce.

Being Latina I was a little skeptical about this recipe but I had a lot of spaghetti squash to use, and I have to say it was pretty good!  The bf absolutely LOVED it.  I didn't have any jalepenos on hand so I substituted a can of diced tomatoes w/green chiles and I only had flour tortillas.  Other than that I stuck to the recipe.

excellent recipe and a surprisingly delicious way to use up spaghetti squash! I highly recommend this one mainly because its so easy to put together and so tasty.  I wasn't sure about this when I read the title, but I'm really glad I tried it.  Thanks for sharing!

I have made this dish many times and love it! I now use hot and spicy taco seasoning, add chicken, and use warmed corn tortillas. There are so many ways you can customize this, but I think the original recipe is pretty darn good.

I love this recipe.  I steamed the squash and used greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  I also topped with salsa, lettuce, and cheese.

Ho hum.  Boring!  Won't bother trying this one again.  I come from the "land of bland," so even a little flavor is good; this took me back there.

Great option to Italian dishes with this squash.  I've found that with any spaghetti squash recipe, including this one, it's best remove as much of the water as you can from the squash after cooking and removing it from the shell.  I line a colander with paper towels, dump the squash onto it, cover with more paper towels and press out the water by hand.  Cheesecloth would work even better, but costs more and I rarely have any one hand.    

I use this recipe for the taco "meat", and still top it with cheese, lettuce, chopped tomatoes, salsa and sour cream.

Really tasty! I got a spaghetti squash to use as spaghetti and didn't like it, so I was really surprised to find a recipe like this.  I am a vegan, so it is cool to find new "meat" replacements.

First time cooking with spaghetti squash & thought this might make for an interesting meal. Psuedo tacos may not have been the best way to first experience this vegetable; which I will defintely cook again as a side dish. As tacos it was only OK. I should have used my own seasoning instead of the packaged taco seasoning (which taste like Taco Bell...blah!). It was easy enough; the hardest part was cutting the squash (thank goodness for the internet). We did eat it all but this will never be a family favorite.

Loved these tacos!  I used hard taco shells to give it some crunch (I think it would be too much of the same texture otherwise) but no complaints on the flavor here. As a vegetarian I am always looking for non-soy meat substitutes and this hit the spot. Thank you so much for the great recipe, it will definitely be in my regular rotation.

This turned out really yummy and is so unique!  I didn't have fresh jalapeno, so I used a small can of diced green chiles.  (Be sure to cook until it is no longer watery!)  I served it with fresh spinach leaves, diced tomatoes, chopped black olives, diced avocado with lime juice, shredded cheese, and salsa and sour cream in crunchy taco shells.  YUM!

This recipe was really yummy!  My husband and I really like the slight crunch of the squash and how it just took on the flavor of the seasoning.  I had never made the spaghetti squash before and I'll def. be making this again.

Really enjoyed this! This was the first time I have ever had spaghetti squash and was not sure how it would turn out.   So very glad i tried this. I will be making this recipe again.   Don't miss the meat at all.
