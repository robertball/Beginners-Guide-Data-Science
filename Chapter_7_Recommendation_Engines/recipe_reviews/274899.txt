These have potential, but I have a couple of suggestions: I needed a bigger square of tinfoil to hold all of the ingredients, so rather than folding my 18" wide foil in half, I just used a double layer of a bigger size. I placed my foil packet on my outdoor gas grill that had been heated to medium heat, and I set my timer for 30 minutes. In hindsight, I'd reduce the heat to low and cook for 20 minutes, then open the foil and stir them a bit, because the bottom has a tendency to char from all of the steak seasoning. I'd also reduce the steak seasoning as this ended up being way too salty, maybe to 2 tablespoons. I used Publix brand, which had the exact same ingredients as Dale's. I did notice that Dale's makes a reduced sodium version, so maybe that one would have been a better choice. The ingredients do shrink up drastically, so if you think it looks like too much, you will be surprised once you see the final amount. I'd use this method again, but with these modifications. Definitely makes clean up easy!
