These turned out well. However, I used real honest vanilla extract.

Mine turned out really flat and I ended up throwing them away.  Quite possibly something I did wrong, but I couldn't figure it out.  :(

I made these with the following substitutions:
I replaced the flour with spelt flour and chestnut flour.  
I used real vanilla.
I replaced dried cherries with chopped up maraschino cherries.
I used coconut-oil.
They turned out okay.  My children liked them a lot and need wheat -free treats.  
Next time I will reduce the sugar content.
