Honestly, laziness crept in, and I used frozen pearl onions for this recipe rather peeling all of those little bitty onions.  Wasn't sure about what to do with them after I poured the pickling liquid into the jars, so I just put lids on them, and into the fridge they went.  I uploaded a photo on 5.20.15, but I just knew that I couldn't wait 6 weeks to sample these onions. So I'm coming clean with you, I cheated and opened a jar today.  Seriously, the best pickled onions I've ever had.  The thing that makes this recipe unique is the malt vinegar, and the  hot chili peppers.  I not only added some crushed peppers to each jar, I added a couple of the whole dried chilis.  That malt vinegar-chili pepper combination is just crazy good.  I vow to never not have these on hand in my fridge.   Hmmmm, wonder how those onions would be in a very dry gin martini (is that called a Gibson??).   Five-star recipe in this house!

it needs sugar, add about a cup and it makes all the difference.  Is really good on buttered bread.  I also did not remove the pickling spice I enjoy the little bits of spice

These are a pain in the butt to do But oh so worth the work and now I wished I'd done a dozen jars cause I'm out and need to make more the malt vinegar and hot pepper flakes mix together so nice and these go well in a martini I noticed the longer they set the better they are !!!! But I now know to make a lot more as they didn't last everybody wanted more!!! Thanks so much for sharing!!!!

The pickling spice I used had cloves in it which just doesn't fit in to any pickled onions I've ever had before so I didn't care for them.  I think for this to be a better recipe it should specify the individual spices needed since "pickling spices" are going to vary from brand to brand.  That would be the only way to ensure a recipe was going to come out tasting the same for everyone.

Enough onions for 3 x 2 cup jars but not enough brine. Had to make more.

Love them. Just like the ones we had growing up. Doing them for a second year. Great with hamburgers. - Jackie
