I'm a finalist (Bush's Beans Aloha) in the side dish contest, but wanted to say that I think your main dish recipe was the best of those in the main dish category; best use of Bush's famous beans, best combination of flavors, and ease of preparation.  Best wishes to you.

Yum.  The more we ate this the more we loved it.  I made it exactly as written and it turned out great but next time may add jalapeno or something spicy to offset the sweetness.  My boys topped theirs with cheese.

I used bone in ribs and the dish was very good, however, I really couldn't taste the mango or the other flavors very well. I wonder if the same results would be achieved by just cooking the ribs with the beans and a little barbecue sauce.

Excellent recipe! Rather than adding a jalapeno pepper, I added a 1/4 teaspoon of ground cayenne red pepper. This seemed to add the perfect amount of heat without overpowering the sweetness. My husband loved this dish. I will definitely make it again!

This was awesome, I added 2 jalapenos for added heat.  Perfect for rainy Portland night.

Easy, few ingredients, one-step-meal.
