Made this again this year - many compliments.  This is a great stuffing that tastes like you spent a long time putting it together, when you spend little time in the kitchen with this.  Yummy!!

Simple.  I felt it was too salty though.

My family loved this stuffing, the only complaint was that I didn't make enough. The only thing I did different was using it to stuff the turkey instead of baking it separate. I wish I had taken a photo but it was gobbled up by the time I remembered.

I assume this would have been 5 stars if I had followed the recipe exactly! My kids did the shopping for me and got the Stove Top stuffing mix, and I just went with it. Liking softer stuffing, I used about 48 ounces of chicken broth, and it seemed too soft so I left it in the oven at least 20 extra minutes and it ended up with a pretty good texture but a slightly burned flavor. Will try again with the bagged stuffing mix and I'll bet it will be great.

Not normally a huge stuffing fan, and when I do get the taste for it, I just to with Stove Top. I decided to try making it from scratch (or almost from scratch, as in the case of this recipe), and it was delicious! I did add a little extra poultry seasoning, because I love the taste, but otherwise followed exactly. I wasn't sure about the pear, but it gives it that little something extra. My mom said, "What did you do to the stuffing? It tastes wonderful!" Will definitely make again.
