Excellent basic jimbalaya recipe. Easy to add additional ingredients if you wish. In addition to the shrimp and ham, I added pre-cooked skinless chicken thighs, scallops, and sweet italian sausage. For a bit more Cajun "kick", I also added Red Pepper Flakes, Garlic herb spice, and 1 tbsp of Emeril's "Bam!" spice. Wonderful! This is a keeper!

Fantastic!  This was my first time making jambalaya and I loved it.  As per some of the reviews, it needed extra liquid for the rice, but since I didn't have extra broth, I just added water as needed (about one and a half cups).  I spiced it up with half a habanero, a little cayenne and some red pepper flakes. So easy to make and I only had to dirty one pot :)

I am from South Louisiana and I think that this dish needed some more flavor.  Turned out bland and mushy.

Tried it and absolutely loved it.  The family has requested it again!  Jill - you said there was a lot of room to mess with the recipe.  It is great just like it is!  Thanks for sharing this with us.

I modified this recipe by using only 1 cup of rice, added 1/2 c celery and 1/2 red pepper to onions & butter.  Then I added cajun seasoning, Lowery's seasoned salt, fresh oregano, fresh basil and a big splash of jalapeno sauce.  My family thought it was a great recipe.  I'll try it again.

My husband really enjoyed this, and surprisingly my kids did too.  I am not a fan of Cajun food, but I ate it and it wasn't too spicy.  I didn't have the ham on-hand, so I used 1 lb. beef smoked sausage, and I also added gumbo vegetables and some Cajun seasoning.  Also I used brown rice and it was just as good.  We will make this one again; thanks!

Delicious.  I used 25-to-a-pound shrimp.  I couldn't spend all that time peeling them without making use of the shells!  So I put the shrimp shells in the chicken stock and added one more cup of chicken stock and one cup of white wine, then reduced it back down to the amount called-for in the recipe (then removed the shells, of course!)  I also cooked the roux to a golden brown before proceeding with the rest of the recipe.

The recipe does not call for "trinity" (onions, celery and green pepper) and no cajun seasoning - which I found interesting.  So I served this recipe with a bottle of papaya hot sauce for people to pass around.

This is a great base recipe! Here's what I usually do with it. I melt the 4 tbsp of butter in a pot, then saute chicken breast or sausage until cooked and golden brown. I take out the meat and set aside, then make the roux and stir for about 2 minutes. I then add the meat back in, along with ~4 cups of homemade tomato sauce, 2-3 cups of homemade chicken stock, and 2 cups of brown rice. I bring it all to a boil, then let simmer for about 45 minutes, or until just a little liquid remains (per the recipe), then add the shrimp and let steam for about 8 minutes. After all that is done, I season it to taste with salt, pepper, and creole seasoning. I get rave reviews from my foodie husband every time!

I've never made jambalaya before...but had some cherry tomatoes and Canadian bacon to use up, and some shrimp in the freezer.  Had no onion, so used onion powder, and I did add some Cajun spice and hot pepper flakes.  So simple to make, and I can see endless ways to change it up!  Try this...you'll like it!!

Very good. I am allergic to a lot of spices and wanted something very basic that I could do what I want with.  This is it. I made my own veggie stock and used that to cook the rice. Lots of flavor. I can't have spicy foods, but its nice to be able to add what I can and still have flavor. Thank you!

It was a good basic recipe for jambalaya. I swapped the ham for sausage, used half the amount of shrimp and added in some cajun chicken I had in my freezer. I also added chopped green pepper, red pepper flakes, and cajun seasoning.

Just moved to Louisiana from the Midwest.. decided that we needed to try  some Southern dishes.  This is the first jambalaya recipe that I tried and it was excellent!  Would probably add some hot sauce next time for added flavor.

I've made this recipe two times.  Each time was fantastic.  One time I added Shrimp the next just the chicken.  Play with it a little.  Very easy to make.  Very hard to screw up.  Add a little of this, a little of that..Whammo..a great meal.  Tastes better the next day.

Excellent Dish!  Due to family allergies I had to skip the shrimp.  I added 1 tbsp of crushed red pepper, and doubled the oregano.  I would definitely recommend!!!

It needs WAY MORE seasoning...  My rice didn't cook all the way through, but I did one and a half recipes, so it may not multiply well.

I made this  for all of my neighbors and I received lots of compliments.  I used shrimp, ham, sausage and chicken; added some chili pepper, hot pepper seeds, just enough for flavor, not to make it hot; for those that like it hot, I posted a bottle of 'Louisianna Hot Sauce' and my neighbor brought over 'Tony Chacehere's Original Creole Seasoning'.  WOW!!  Next time i make this I will not make it with the rice in the soup, I will make them seperately and serve the Jambalaya over the rice.  The rice became real mushy.  Otherwise, love the recipe!

Somehow this ended up mushy, as someone earlier said.  Also, it definitely needed spicing up...red pepper flakes and/or hot sauce.  I'm going to try another recipe for jambalaya next time.

I make this recipe all the time when guests are over or just for my husband and I. It's delicious! The only thing I add is McCormick's Creole Seasoning for extra flavor spiciness.

This was fabulous, and so easy!  I made a few changes - instead of chicken, I used spicy smoked sausage and shrimp.  I wanted some heat, so I added about 1 1/2 tbsp creole seasoning and 2 tsp siracha.  It was delish!  Oh and instead of green peppers I used celery.  The hubs loved it!

This is an awesome recipe for shrimp jambalaya..my advice is to use a little more chicken broth than the recipe calls for.  Absolutely delicious!!!!

Super good!  I used Qinuoa in place of rice.  It did need a little more flavor, so that's the only reason it lost a star.  I'm glad I made this!

Definitely needs more liquid - I added about 1 1/2 cups.  I also included about 1/4 cup tomato sauce  in that liquid because my tomatoes were fresh and there wasn't much juice.  Overall, a very good recipe that can easily be tweeted to just right.

Pretty good, but it seemed like it needed a little something. Still, the whole family liked and ate it so it's a winner.

This was such a quick, easy, and delicious meal! I like foods a little more on the spicy side, so I just doctored it up by adding a little bit of cayenne pepper and garlic powder. I'm certainly glad I came across this recipe!!

Tried as per the recipe, except I used different herbs (mixed) and used my own chicken stock (broth).  Not a meal I would try again, probably my dodgy stock mucked it up.

A good Jambalaya starting recipe, I used shrimp and sausage for the meats. Person I cooked for had never had Jambalaya  and loved it, I enjoyed it as well and will make it again. Happy Fat Tuesday!

I love Jambalaya!  This is an awesome recipe.  I put spicy smoked sausage chunks in it instead and it added an extra kick.  It could have used a little more vegi's though.  But overall, excellent recipe!

We totally enjoyed this but I modified this recipe likes others.  I did not have any ham so just used shrimp.  Only used 1 onion, I thought 3 would take over the recipe.  I used a can of chicken broth, room temperature - it worked fine. Added fresh chopped tomatoes, fresh peppers, and best of all fresh yellow squash. Added fresh parsley, oregano and of course some Old Bay. Delicious!

3 words + more others but simply put "This recipe rocks!!!!!!!" There is so much room to make it your own. I just love it and my bf loved it too. I followed this recipe combined with several others. I used the shrimp shells to add to the chicken broth plus a cup of white wine and reduced it to 3 cups liquid and strained it prior to putting the liquid into the pot. I added chicken and spicy sausage as well as red pepper and celery. I also used some oldbay and seafood seasoning and through in this pre-mixed Cajun seasoning I had lying about. I added red pepper for a little more of a kick and used rices I had cooked from the day before in my fridge the result BAM! An amazing snowmageddon meal! This is definitely a keeper! Thanks for sharing!

Loved this recipe - thank you for posting! The flavor is surprisingly rich and creamy given the simple ingredients.  I substituted bell pepper and celery for some of the onion and used bacon instead of ham because it's what I had on hand.

This was a great recipe.  I just made it the other day for Fat Tuesday.  My picky husband LOVED it!  I made a few adjustments.  I thought I had shrimp in my freezer but I didn't so I cooked a large chicken breast and cut it up into small pieces.  I also used two leftover italian sausages that I had in my fridge.  I used two cloves of garlic and I added a teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes, just to give it a little more kick.  This is a super easy recipe to make and you can pretty much add any type of meat that you have on hand.  You can really be creative with this recipe and make it your own!  Enjoy!

A good recipe for jambalaya. I added some spicy dry red pepper, tabasco and cayenne pepper to give it an extra zing. I also didn't have any butter on hand but substituted with olive oil and buttersalt. Very delicious.

This is OK if you want a quick version of jambalaya.  I would recommend adding some spicy sausage to it.

It was good but I had to add more seasonings. I used Slap Yo Momma Canjun seasoning. I also made a mistake and used 4 tablespoons of flour instead of two. It didn't make much of a difference.

As mentioned by other reviewers, this is a great basic recipe that allows for versatility and seasoning according to each cook's tastes. Using a 12 inch electric skillet with glass cover really helps control the heat and moisture. I chopped 4 snacking peppers (those small, red yellow and orange peppers they sell in produce) and sauteed with the onions. I had leftover rice (from a previous meal) so didn't use the broth nor did I need flour for thickening. A can of petite, diced tomatoes provided enough liquid. I used andouille sausage instead of ham. I seasoned with 5 shakes of chipotle pepper sauce, 1/2 tsp. chili pepper flakes and 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder. Because my rice was already cooked I only needed to simmer the mixture for about 5-7 minutes to heat everything. The color of the combined ingredients made for a festive presentation!

It was plans and a little sticky. We used deli ham and less onion and shrimp. Then we seasoned with Cajun and red pepper. It was an ok dish, but it needs work.

This was my first time making or eating jambalaya.  It was great!  I added a little cajon seasoning and hot sauce to spice it up just a bit.  Great recipe and easy to make!

I couldn't resist adding some heat to it so I added a jalapeno, dried chili peppers, and a touch of chili powder. I also used traded out some of the onions for bell peppers.

I thought this was great and I enjoyed making it. However, I don't think I could get away with making it again because my husband said he'd rather have Crawfish Etoufee (sp?) if I was going to make something like this. He and my bro-in-law still liked it though.

Loved this recipe, it's the first one I tried! My husband is a great cook and cajun, so I was taking a chance! He likes ham and shrimp so I didn't alter the recipe although he usually makes his jambalaya with sausage and chicken. He called it a great "yankee" jambalaya!

This dish was o.k., but I probably won't make again.  There was just something about it that I wasn't crazy about.  Although other members of my family really enjoyed it.

This recipe was pretty good. I took the advice of other reviewers and added 1/2 cup extra chicken broth and also added some diced chicken and a can of sliced mushrooms. I thought that it was a little bland and am hoping to put some more flavor in it next time I make it. The overall rating was definitely good.
