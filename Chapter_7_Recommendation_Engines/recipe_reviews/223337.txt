Great burger but I used fresh mushrooms not canned. Saute the mushrooms with the garlic cool and mix into the burger. It would hold together without the egg so I would omit the egg next time.

Me thinks this is delish! The only change I made was to coarsely chop the sliced mushrooms. The recipe is simple but very good.

Excellent! I don't eat bread so this was perfect. I saut√©ed fresh mushrooms in olive oil and let them cool before adding them to the mix. I used dehydrated minced garlic instead of fresh this time around and it was awesome. Even my picky girlfriend approved. Easy. Cooked inside on skillet.

Chopped up fresh mushrooms and sauteed with the garlic and a little onion before mixing into the beef. Good stuff. Needed more than 7 min/side for well done. I would try adding a little cheese to the mix next time.

I thought this was okay. It didn't taste bad just didn't really have any flavor. I used lean beef and mine were very dry also so I would not use a lower fat beef. I also broiled them as I do with many grilled recipes in the winter. I thought the egg would help with moisture but it didn't. It slightly reminded me more of a meatloaf. So to improve on the flavor I topped them with a bbq ketchup type sauce and heated them briefly and it made them taste better. Not a repeat recipe but it made for a filling dinner tonight anyhow.
