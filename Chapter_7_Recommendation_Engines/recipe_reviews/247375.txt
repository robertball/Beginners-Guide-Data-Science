Cheddar is a cheese for taste but add some processed cheese for texture. I also add a bit of beer to thin it out. a great party dip/fondue. This should be considered a basic starter recioe. Add whatever to suit your taste for the moment.

As written this did not work for me. The cheese strings bad and I actually anticipated that so I had some milk on stand-by. After adding 1/4 cup of milk everything started coming together . but as written I cannot give it more than a 3. Sorry.
