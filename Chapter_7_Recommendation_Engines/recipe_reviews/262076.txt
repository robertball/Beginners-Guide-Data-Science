A big hit!  Loved the red wine and the fact that it didn't involve a can of soup!  The only change I made was I added a glob of Dijon mustard and some garlic powder.  A definite keeper!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was really good. Even my fussy hubby liked it.

Made as written and this turned out good. I actually made another similar recipe on the same night. It used white wine instead of the red. I liked the other recipe a tab bit better but hubs liked this one better. What the other recipe had that this one didn't was a splash of Worcestershire and I think this one would benefit from it too.
