WOW. Incredible recipe!  I used Contadina brand Italian-Style breadcrumbs, I think that really gave it a nice flavor.  I also used spicy sausage rather than mild(the cream soup will tone it down).  Also added fresh sliced mushrooms to the middle before rolling it up, and had some leftover, so added the rest on top at the same time I topped it with the remaining soup.

I recommend spraying a piece of aluminum foil with non-stick spray and spreading the meat on it.  Then you can use the foil to help roll it up.  It also makes for easy clean up.

I have made this recipe for years, but I put the mushroom soup right in the meat mixture. I also add a package of onion soup mix for extra flavor. It makes the most moist meatloaf! Other additons are chopped celery, a handful of parmesan cheese. I call it cleaning out the frig. meatloaf. My kids love it.

This recipe was great! My husband and I couldn't get enough! I did not add sausage, and instead of rolling out the beef I put half in the pan, added the cream of mushroom and put the remainder of beef over it.

I tried Mushroom in the Middle Meatloaf yesterday for dinner.  I thought it was the best meatloaf I've tasted.  It is a little messy before getting it in the pan but definitely worth it.  I patted it out and rolled it on plastic wrap and after placing the meatloaf in the pan, just gathered up the mess and threw it away!  Even my husband, who isn't fond of meatloaf liked it.  In fact, he took the leftovers to work with him for lunch.  I'm going to use this recipe again!

This recipe is a keeper.  I used lean turkey sausage and lean ground turkey, and it was soooo moist!  The only changes I made was that I used fresh garlic, and I also put half of the mix in, topped it with the soup, then put the remaining mix on top instead of trying to roll it.  It made a clear division in the loaf when I tried to remove it from the pan after baking, but it tasted awesome.  DO TRY!!

My family liked this alot, even my husband, who is the meatloaf maker in this house.  Even better the next day on sandwiches, or just cold sliced out of the fridge, which is my favorite way to eat meatloaf leftovers!

THIS IS A REAL KEEPER WITH A FEW CHANGES.  I ADDED SOME FENNEL TO THE SAUCE TO "KICK IT UP A NOTCH", USED RED PEPPER FOR TASTE AND COLOR, AND HALVED THE RECIPE AS I AM A SINGLE PERSON.  QUICK AND DELICIOUS AND IS NOW IN MY MAKE ONCE A WEEK COLLECTION.

I don't usually like meatloaf but was requested to make it. I found this and read thru the reviews and modified as follows:  I used beef because that’s what I had. I also added fresh mushrooms inside and out. I used minced garlic and mixed the seasoned bread crumbs with spicy fish batter. I spread the meat out on plastic wrap leaving the edges a little higher and spread the soup on and then the fresh mushrooms.  I lifted the plastic wrap as I rolled the meat up and sealed the ends as I went to keep the soup in. I had no mess! I put it in the pan with the seam down. I cooked it in a glass covered oval because it didn’t fit in my loaf pan. When I got it out to put the soup on and more fresh mushrooms I used a syringe to suck out the grease that had drained to the bottom. I making it today with cream of celery instead.

Easy and really liked the flavor with the sausage/onion/green pepper.  If you're not big on sausage use 1 1/2 lb beef and 1/2 lb pork.  
Did have to add 30 min to cook time probably because of the pork.  Wasn't able to "roll" up and seal good so I had mushroom all over not just in the middle!  IF I make again I may just mix soup into meat mixture.

This came out really good!  I substituted the seasoned bread crumbs with panko and 2 tsp italian seasoning, omitted the salt, used italian turkey sausage and added a Lipton's onion soup mix as another reviewer suggested.  I also didn't have any green pepper but added chopped green beans instead which added a nice crunch. Came out really tasty and will definitely make again.

Really good recipe, I have passed it on to many friends and they all love it.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and put half of the soup right into my meat mixture, and add a half package of dry oinion soup mix.  Mixing the soup right into the meat is just faster and less mess.

Try this neat trick that I accidently realized while trying to figure how I was going to roll the meat over the soup mix.
I had the meat shaped into the loaf and I cut a "wedge" of meat off the top and made a "well" in the meat and poured the soup into it and with the meat I cut off I shaped it to cover the wedge I had made and placed over the soup mix and it was easy to lift and handle as if it had nothing to spill.  It worked like a charm and the meatloaf was excellent.  I also added a packet of onion soup mix to the meat because I read that it was a tad bland.  This is the best meatloaf I had ever tasted and it's the first meatloaf I didn't have to make a gravy for.  This will be my new recipe for meatloaf and will definitely make many more times.   Thanks for posting this great recipe.   R.G.

I made this meatloaf using reduced sodium mushroom soup, ground turkey (also tried with beef, but I like turkey), and a ground sausage that was labeled "Sweet Italian," though now I don't know the brand.
Anyway, it was delicious! My only problem was that I added too much diced peppers and onions, so instead of roll it out I followed the advice of another reviewer and instead put half the meat mixture, then half the soup, then the other half of the meat. I did pour the rest on top halfway through. Because I made it that way instead, it wasn't sealed and the soup primarily ran out of the center - but it tasted so great, I didn't care. Also, I didn't feel the sausage ever overpowered the rest of the flavors.
I have made this several times in this way because it's faster than rolling it, and it's also really good with sliced fresh mushrooms in the middle and on top.

Not a fan.  Neither was my husband.  It was undercooked by about an hour with the cook time and pretty much a pile of mushroom mush and grease.

Delicious!  The soup makes it very moist throughout.  I would agree with some other users however in that next time I may use a low sodium variety.  I also used ground turkey instead of pork just because that is what was in the freezer.  Next time would also like to try putting hunks of mushroom in the middle as well.

THis is the best meatloaf I have ever tasted and it will become part of our regular dinner entrees in the future.  My boyfriend loved it and is actually excited about eating leftovers today! (For once)  I did have to bake for about 15 minutes longer to cook through the middle, but ovens vary.

Not my favorite.  The meatloaf was too dense.  I cooked for extra time after reading reviews and it still wasn't enough.  I also didn't like the skin that formed on top from the soup.

I thought this was just okay - and I do love meatloaf in general.
I think the preparation directions were a little hard to do successfully. The 8x8-inch square was easy to roll up, but the soup kept squishing out. I had to settle for getting it slightly sealed, and I placed it seam-side down in the loaf pan. Maybe I need to be more experienced - as a rookie cook, I'd never quite done this before.
Like the previous reviewer, I used 93/7 ground beef to get less fat in the meatloaf.
Cooked exactly as described, the outside was fairly well-done, but the inside was pretty uncooked. I notice that a number of other reviewers had the same problem. Perhaps I need to make adjustments for high-elevation cooking (I now live at over 6000 ft.). In my case, I just left the loaf in the cooling oven for quite a while, which helped finish the middle a bit.
It was a little nice to have the beef/pork combination, with a few crunchy bell pepper and onion chunks in it. But I thought the soup on top seemed kind of "unfinished", for lack of a better word, plus it made the dish pretty salty.
If I were to make this again, I'd definitely cook it a lot longer and I'd look for a low- or even no-salt soup.

This was a decent meatloaf.  I do like it better than one with ketchup.  We don't eat a whole lot of meatloaf, but when we do this will be the one we have.  Next time I'll try it with ground turkey with the sausage.

This was excellent, I probably used more ground beef than it called for so I cooked it longer.  It was my favorite meatloaf recipe and have shared it with coworkers.  Would even make this for a dinner party!

I loved this recipe, I'm not a big fan of normal meatloaf with ketchup and everything so this makes it just right for me. My husband also really liked this, he gave it 4 stars ....he had seconds and that is a rare thing! Definantly try it!!! I added a can of mushrooms to the mix and it was awesome! I would rate it 5 stars!

This was an AWESOME recipe. Blew my mother's meatloaf out of the water!! I did, however, just mix the mushroom soup into the meat mixture and made meatloaf muffins in a muffin tins. BIG HIT!!

Great on taste but appearance is not appealing if you add the remainder of  mushroom soup halfway through the cooking process. The soup congels and looks like paste!

This recipe was good. The sausage made the difference in taste and texture. I also added slices of swiss cheese in the middle, before I layered on the soup. Thanks for the recipe!

A change of pace from the normal meatloaf. I did have the problem of it not cooking all the way, so I cooked it 20 minutes longer. The texture was really different. I think I'd only do ground beef the next time.

Meatloaf was very good, will definitely make again.  Substituted red pepper for green.  Cook time to 160 deg. was 1hr. 45 min.

this was a big hit with my family in spite of the prediction my husband made that our picky eater would sneer at the mushroom soup. The picky eater allowed that he had to "get past" that part but he said to make it again the same way.

When I saw the recipe title this sounded tasty....then I read the recipe and was  disappointed. I read thru some of the reviews to see if anyone had the same idea I did and shazam there was others that put fresh mushrooms in the middle. My husband says it's a keeper.  When I make this again I am going to cut back on the sausage, portion,  3/4 ground beef,  1/4 pork sausage.

It was very good.  I wish I had made it with mashed potatoes because the gravy it makes is really good and there's a lot of it. I did roll it out on tinfoil and that helped roll it out and then into a loaf.

I made it just as the recipe was written. My husband is a meatloaf snob, "no one makes it like Mom". He told me to definatley keep this one! To help with the messy problem, I put plastic wrap on a cutting board and used that to help roll. Like a sushi mat.

My husband & I loved this! I used meatloaf mix: beef/veal/pork. Eliminated the peppers, neither of us like them. As per other reviews, i used onion soup mix & a can of sliced shrooms I chopped; added half to the mix & the rest went in the middle. I Flattened the loaf on Pam sprayed foil, using the foil to roll it up. It was easy w/no mess. I needed to tack on an add'l 30 min cook time to get it up to a done temperature. It sliced & held together nicely. Will definitely make this again!

Instead of bread crumbs, I have always used uncooked oatmeal.   It really seems to better hold all the ingredients together than bread crumbs.   Remember, meatloaf should always rest for 10 minutes before slicing it so that it won't fall apart.  Putting half the meatloaf into the baking pan, then adding the 1/2 can of soup, then putting the other half of the meat over the top is a lot less messy.

Very tasty and I would make it again, my husband loved it,  but his name should be Micky, he loves everything!  I did increase the baking time to 50 minutes to "tighten" it up a bit, besides I didn't think it would be fully cooked in 30 minutes.  
I will be making it again.  I'll try it with more of an herbal flavor.

This was a hit!  It's a little messy to make but so worth it.  It's delicious.   The only change I made was to substitute celery for the peppers and I sauteed the onion and celery in a little butter  until soften before adding it to the beef mixture. I had to bake it a little longer than the recipe requested for it to reach the internal temperature of 160. Thanks for sharing!

We used Golden Mushroom soup and mixed it in to the meat rather than folding it in the middle. Very moist and tasty meatloaf. Will definitely make this again.

Awesome.  Ran out of Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and spiced up panko.  Added some cilantro, mushrooms and chopped up baby carrots.  Love it.

I tried this wonderful sounding recipe.  I added extra mushrooms and some sausage to the mixture.  We found it to be surprisingly a bit bland.

I just didn't care for this, think it was the sausage that I didn't care for in it.

This was a big hit. I added a bit to the meat, such as a stick of celery, some ketchup, steak sauce, & cheese (in the middle & on top). It was fabulous.

Had a little trouble with this one...cook time is much longer than stated.  Due to that, I ran out of time before needing to head to work, so no supper that night:(  Wound up microwaving it next day to get the rest of the pink out.  Taste was very good, so I can only imagine that it will be better when cooked long enough initially.  Will try again with these hopes.

The meatloaf fell apart when trying to serve it and tasted to much like breakfast sausage. My husband who will eat just about anything asked me not to make it again.
