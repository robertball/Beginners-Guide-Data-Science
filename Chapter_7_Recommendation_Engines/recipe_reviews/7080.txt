I've made this recipe twice and it is a keeper.  I refrigerated the dough after the first rising til I was ready to roll it out and bake it, and it worked very well.  Great taste, soft and chewy crust that complements the pizza toppings rather than dominating the flavor.  I've tried many other pizza dough recipes, and this is by far our favorite.

I've been using the recipe for Jay's pizza crust, but wanted something a little chewier.  I doubled this recipe and made it in my mixer.  We all loved it!  It'll be my standard crust recipe from now on.

Very easy and quick way to make a pizza crust.  I added a few pinches of crushed dried rosemary for a great but subtle flavor in the crust.  I popped it in the bread machine (about 50 minutes) and spread it out on a cookie sheet at about 1/2 inch thick (We like thick crust).  Spread a little olive oil on it to make the crust a little crunchier. I mixed a 6oz can of tomato paste with a half jar of my favorite spaghetti sauce and put LOADS of toppings. (try turkey pepperoni, it tastes the same but is way more healthy) Took exactly 15 minutes at 400 degrees.  Will definitely make again and again!

I'm terribly sorry, I don't mean to be the one who is negative, but I am trying to figure out what the fuss is all about. The crust is hard on the outside and fluffy to the point of being try on the inside. Plus it doesn't brown well.  Thanks anyway.

A very nice crust and remained soft and chewy while slightly crisp on the nicelt browned exposed edge. Next time I may add some herbs to the mix to add a bit more taste. Easy to make if you have a bread machine, the ingrediant list is right on!

I made this using 1 cup water,3 tbsp olive oil, 1 tsp oregano and thyme, 1 Tbsp garlic powder with the other normal ingredients.  Turned out WONDERFUL!  I will be using this recipe a lot!!  If you like thick soft crust, give it a try!

This dough is so delicious and easy to make!  It's the first homemade pizza dough I have tried, but it's too good to go anywhere else!  My husband loves it as much as I do.  I brush butter and garlic on the crust before and after baking for a delectable crust! Wonderful recipe!!

Excellent crust recipe. I cut this doen to make a small pizza just for my hubby and it turned out fabulous! I don't have a bread maker so I just added the yeast and sugar to the hot water, let it stand til foamy about 10 min. then added the salt and olive oil, added the flour to mkae a shaggy dough, kneaded it a few times, made the crust on a cornmeal sprinkled pizza pan, let it stand 10 min then topped with alfredo garlic sauce, bacon, mushrooms, parmesan and mozarella then baked at 425 for about 13-15 min til it was done. My husband commented on how good the crust was. Many thanks!!!

My first yeast-raised pizza!  My bread machine sat unused for years, so I thought that I would pull it out and have some fun.  I added a pinch of oregano and garlic powder to the flour.  I formed my dough on a piece of unfloured parchment paper, then slid the entire thing onto my pizza stone in the oven.  After baking for ten minutes, the crust hardened enough so that I could slide my parchment paper right out.  No mess!  The crust also browned nicely on the pizza stone.  Thanks for a successful recipe!

I've made this pizza crust twice now and my family loves it!  It stays nice and soft which is great because we have small children.  I stretch it out kind of thin over a large pizza pan with holes so the bottom gets cooked nicely, it has never come out doughy like a lot of crusts will.  I only bake it for about 14 minutes though unless there are alot of toppings.  The only issue is that it doesn't really brown, it stays really light, but overall that's not a big factor to me.  The flavor is very nice and seems like it would be excellent with some fresh herbs added in.  (which I'll do next time!)

My husband and I loved this recipe! I used half all purpose flour and half whole wheat flour and it turned out great! I will probably put the crust in the oven for a couple of minutes next time before topping because I think having the heavier flour made it a tad doughy. But that was my fault! Great recipe!

Best pizza crust I've ever made, but I do have to say that I modified it just a bit.  (What can I say, I almost always have to modify recipes!)  To make the crust a little healthier, I substituted 3/4 cup of whole wheat flour for some of the white flour,  added a tablespoon of ground flax meal, and increased water to 1 cup.  In addition (and as some of the other reviewers did) I added garlic and dried basil to the crust (didn't measure, just threw it in).  This dough is really easy to work with compared to the others I've made.  It spreads easily without trying to retreat again to the middle of the pan.  Wonderful chewy texture, and just crisp enough underneath to hold it's shape.  So happy that I tried this one, albeit a bit modified from the recipe as written.

This was not good in my family's opinion.  It was too hard and chewy.  Maybe I did something wrong, but don't think so.  We'll go w/other recipes on this site.  Sorry.

Perfect as is. I added 1 tsp oregano and 1/2 tsp garlic salt. Bake crust 5 min at 400' before adding toppings. After toppings bake additional 15-20 min.

my go to recipe for pizza crust or stromboli. You do have to check on it after a few minutes and you may need a few more drops of water or oil.  Sometimes its just too dry, dont know why.  I also add in some garlic Mrs Dash for some extra flavor.  Nice stretchy dough.

This is a great pizza crust recipe for the bread maker. I just threw the ingredients into the bread machine and it came out really good. I used to make pizza crust by hand but there is really no need to do that when you can get this good of a crust out of a bread maker. thanks for the recipe

This is the exact texture I have been looking for in a pizza crust! It was lacking a little bit in flavor for me but I can easily tweak that. I did use my KitchenAid to mix this. Thank you so much for sharing!

Great recipe.  It was quick and easy and everyone loved it.  I added about 1tbl of garlic powder and the same of onion powder during the addition of the salt and it gave it a great flavor.  Will use the recipe very often.

I made this for dinner tonight because of the short ingredient list.  I'm very pleased!  We only had canola oil, so that was the only substitution I made.  I let the crust rise and then brushed it with oil and par-baked it for about 10 minutes before adding the toppings & finishing it off.  The crust was crunchy on the bottom yet thick and chewy.  Very nice!  I will use this recipe again.

Good crust, but it lost a star for not getting brown when done. We also made 2 pizzas out of this instead of one. Will use again, but may also keep looking for that "perfect" recipe.

With all the positive reviews, I'm not sure what went wrong here.  There wasn't enough flour, I had to add quite a bit more.  The baked product was quite bland and could use something more.  But, it certainly was easy!

I made calzones with this crust recipe and NO ONE believed it was homemade dough!!!! The crust was absolutely perfect- the taste was wonderful and it was REALLY really easy! This recipe's definitely going to get used again!

I've been looking for a good pizza crust recipe for a while and my search is over!  This is a great recipe, the best pizza I've had in a long, long time!  I made 2 pizza's out of the recipe since I like thinner crust and it was perfect!

Delicious! The dough is a bit sticky coming out of the bread machine, but it's nothing a little extra flour can't help! Definitely roll out the dough thinner than you think is appropriate, though. I had a very thick pizza crust!

Excellent! I made the dough in my bread maker (mixed the brown sugar..I used 1 tsp... with the warm water) & it turned out great. Also, I baked the crust for 5 min before adding ingredients; crisp crust which my family all loved.

I love this recipe. It turns out great. It's good for a thick crust and a time saver. The only part about the recipe I dislike is the aggravating measurements for the ingredients. I'm not exactly sure why they put 7/8 cup. I've made this three times now I found using 1 cup of water is the perfect amount.

This is the best pizza crust I have ever made.  I make it in my bread machine on the dough cycle. When it beeps, I add a couple of cloves of micro-planed garlic and a couple of pinches of Italian seasoning.  The crust is crunchy on the outside, but very soft and fluffy on the inside. My Oven recently broke, but my kids love pizza, so I used my Rival Roaster Oven @ 425 for 20-25 Minutes. I always par bake my dough for about 8-10 Minutes first, then just bake the rest of the time allotted. I also warm some garlic in olive oil and Italian seasoning and brush it around the edge of the pizza.

Very good pizza crust!  My father is 100% Italian, originally from New York and even he loved it!  The crust was the first thing he commented on.  I paired it with Exquisite Pizza Sauce from this site.

Very good.  I also made it for 17 servings and got two 9 inch round pizza's and one that just fed me, done on a pizza pan with holes in it.  Its light and crisp on the outside.  I'll have to wait to see how the 9 inch ones turned out, they are deep dish and for the hubby.  The texture is perfect but I might like a little more flavor.

Updating :  the crust was great right out of the oven, but just so/so after it sat and cooled.  It seemed to lose the lightness/crispness.

This is the best pizza dough.  I change the perfeservings 17 and it made 2 perfect pizza doughs.  I pre baked the dough at 425.  The little ones like their dough a little on the chewy side so i pre baked it for about 10 min.  The hubby and I like a thin crispy crust so I pre-baked ours for about 15 - 17 min.

Very good and easy. I added 3 Tbls of Wheat Bran. This made it a little more hefty but added a great flavor and was still tender.

We love this pizza crust recipe. It tastes great and is SO easy to prepare.  I use the timer on my bread machine so I can dump the ingredients in the breadmaker and forget about it until dinner time. We make this a couple times a week at my house! Thanks!

I found this pizza crust okay.  It took an hour and twenty minutes in the bread machine.  Not very quick.  It was quick to get the ingredients in the bread machine, just not out of it to get the pizza baking.

Maybe I wasn't looking and added too much flour, but the wet/dry ratio seemed off b/c the dough was so dry. It was great after I added more water. Thanks!

After trying two different recipes, including the one on the back of the Fleishmann's yeast packet, I had all but given up on homemade pizza.  My family and I are sooo glad I gave it one more shot!  This one turned out perfectly with a delicious taste even my crust-finicky children (2, 4, 6, 8) loved!  I did add a couple of dashes of Italian seasoning to the bread machine, but I don't know if that really made a difference or not.  I can see us having homemade pizza weekly now!  Thank you so much for a great recipe!

I use this recipe constantly. It makes for a crust with a great texture. The only extras that I put into this recipe are Italian seasoning and garlic powder or fresh minced garlic to make it more of an herbed crust. Overall though, a great recipe. Everyone I make it for loves it!

This is my new favorite recipe! This is my first try at making my own pizza crust and it couldn't have been easier. It was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Mine browned perfectly, so I don't know why other people are having problems. I will never buy pizza dough again.

A good, basic dough.  I added some Italian seasonings to the mix.  I rolled mine out onto a large airbake pan that had been dusted with cornmeal, used a fork to pierce the dough and baked for 10 minutes before topping.  It probably would have turned out a bit better on a different kind of pan, but overall my family was happy!

I made this for the first time last night.  It was my first time making pizza dough; although, I'm familar with baking and dough in general.  So, for us first-timers, I suggest giving instructions rather than referring us to the "manufacturer's instruction".  What is someone is mixing by hand?  What is your manufacturer doesn't give instructions, as in my case?  I had to go to other pizza dough recipes, and pull instructions that way--very inconvenient.

This had a great pizza-parlor type texture, not too thick or too thin. But, it was a little bland. I will definitely make this again, but add a little more sugar or some spices. Very good, though.

This is a good crust.  It is soft inside and a little crispy on the edge.  I made this in a 12" pie pan.  I added oregano.  Next time I'll add garlic, too, and use my 16" pan so that the crust is not so thick.  I'll use a fork to puch holes so that the middle can't rise as far.  Then, it should be perfect.

Great for grilling. After dough is made, cut into four pieces, form dough into four little pizza's, brush with olive oil grill untill done, put your favorite toppings on and enjoy.

This pizza crust was very easy to make and to work with! I used it to make a stuffed-crust pizza. To do this, I sliced string cheese in half lengthwise. After rolling out the pizza crust to a 14" circle, I put this on a greased baking sheet sprinkled with cornmeal. I laid the cheese all around the circle about 1" in from the edge. I rolled the edge over to cover the cheese, and pinched the edges in to seal. My family ate the whole thing so fast that I didn't even get to try any! I will definitely make this again; thanks for a great recipe!

This was very good!  I too bumped the servings up to 17.  I then divided the dough into two, and put one in the freezer for another day.  I rolled it out as much as I could, but it still wasnt as thin and crispy as I personally would like.  I will make this again though, and I think adding some herbs will make it even better!

This is the only pizza crust recipe I use.  I sub 1 C. whole wheat flour and cut the all-purpose flour.  I also add a few seasonings.  Very good basic crust.

Try this for added flavour:

Increase water to 1 cup, and oil to 3 Tbs.  Add 1 Tb each of oregano and thyme, and 1/2 tsp garlic powder (not garlic salt).
Add 4 Tbs. sesame seeds.

Very Good!  The crust raised high in the oven and tasted like it was made at a pizzaria, except that it wasn't swimming in grease.

This recipe is soooo easy and delicious.  The only change I made was to add more olive oil and pre-bake the crust for 15 minutes before putting the toppings on and then baking 15 minutes more.  It is on the inside of my cupboard door for easy access to the recipe.

I used this recipe because I couldn't find my usual one.  On the plus side, it was easy to put together in my bread maker, and was easy to work with.  I got two pizzas with a medium thin crust out of the dough.  On the down side, when baked it was too delicate, not chewy enough.  It was also very bland, even though I added a tsp. of garlic pwdr to the dough before mixing.  So, on the whole I will go back to my original if I can find it, since I think it would take too much to make this one a winner on the taste side.

Hmmm...I don't know what I did wrong. I followed the recipe exactly and even added some herbs to the dough and the crust had the taste and consistency of cardboard. However, it was easy and this was my first attempt at pizza dough. I might try this again.

This pizza crust was pretty good, although I'm still looking for a better recipe.  I prebaked my crust a little bit and then added the toppings and baked it again, the crust around the edge got really hard, although it never browned up (to let you know it's done.) The whole crust stayed rather pale even on the bottom, when it was clearly done. The flavor was average, the texture was better than average except the for hard edges, and it was very easy to make in the bread machine.  Thanks!

This recipe was fantastic! For my families particular tastes, I buttered the pizza stone heavily, pressed the crust on, let it rise about 10 minutes, sprinkled it with garlic powder, baked it in the oven for 10 minutes, then put on the toppings and baked it another 15 minutes. I made 2 pizzas last night with various toppings and then had a request for a cheese pizza for lunch today! The crust was so easy that I was able to say yes! Because it is a "plain" pizza crust, you can add so many different flavors.

I used my breadmaker to make the dough. Then made little pizzas with picante sauce and cheddar cheese. I wrapped each pizza in plastic wrap to store in the freezer. It was a success. Thank you for the recipe.

This was my first attempt at making a home made pizza.  I made it exactly as written.  My bread machine took 1 hr & 40 min on the dough setting.  I used a 16" perforated pizza pan which I sprayed with a little butter spray and sprinked with some cornmeal.  Took some work to try and get the dough spread evenly on the pan.  I didn't pre-bake it.  Spread some store bought pizza sauce on it and 2 cups of shredded Mozzarella. Sprinkled with a little Italian Seasoning and some additional dried basil and oregano and then lots of pieces of sweet Italian sausage.  Baked it for about 20 min at 400 degrees.  It didn't look real pretty but BOY was it GOOD! Crust was perfect. Light brown and a little crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and totally done even in the middle.  No more store bought for me!

Crust turned out great.  Baked it for a few minutes before putting the sauce & toppings on.  Everyone really enjoyed!

Wonderful recipe! It came out perfect using the 'DOUGH" setting on my bread machine. Soft in the middle with the perfect amount of firmness outside to keep all the topping goodies from collapsing when you pick up a slice to eat. Gonna use it again and again!

Excellent crust!  Soft texture on the inside and slightly crusty on the outside.  I always mist a little olive oil over the edges of the crust before baking.  20 minutes at 425 was just right. I doubled the batch in my bread machine for two pizzas which worked out perfectly.  My new favorite pizza dough recipe!

LOVED IT! So simple to make and the taste was spot on-crispy and chewy, just the way it's supposed to be. I made this exactly as written and would not change a thing. This will be made VERY often in oue house! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was a good basic pizza crust that was able to handle a LOT of topping. I am looking forward to experimenting with different herbs and flavours added into the base.

pretty good. used the bread maker and it worked like a charm (unlike my first attempt with a different recipe -- total disaster!!). Thick and bready, I'll probably use only half the recipe for the next pizza and save the rest in the refrigerator for another meal. I used a regular jelly roll pan. Definitely needed the whole 20 min. in my oven. To prevent sticking, I placed the dough on the counter liberally doused with cornmeal (like Jiffy for cornbread). It didn't give a "mealy" taste after it was cooked but made the dough easier to shape and remove from the pan.

Easy ingredients, came out as expected. My modifications: poked holes into dough and baked dough for 10min, before adding sauce and toppings; used quick-rise yeast. Made crust for 17servings. Split dough in half for an regular/thin crust; if not split, crust is very thick.

Currently in the dough machine!!! :D UPDATE:: The crust as a whole was complimented on but it was a pain to work with. It looked like a sad attempt to free-form shaping..kinda ugly. I may come back to this one though, THANKS!!!

This is by far the best homemade pizza crust I have had.  I always use beer in place of the water.  I used sea salt in place of table salt.  As far as a pan goes, I recommend the airbake pizza pan.  I think this is what made my crust crispy on the bottom, but also think and bready.

I use this recipe all the time for pizza crust--sometimes I sub some wheat flour for white, I often use garlic olive oil, and/or put italian seasoning and garlic powder in the dough.  Every time it has turned out great.  Also, I recommend baking the crust for 2-5 mins before adding sauce and toppings, this prevents the dough from being soggy or not fully cooking.

Flavor and texture were very good but I had to add more flour to the dough to make it actually work. It was really sticky when it came out. My sister and I compared this dough with Boboli dough and we both agree this rocks our socks. This will probably be my main recipe from now on. Good job!

It was quick, easy, and straightforward.  Made this crust and my pizza was delicious!  I used a pizza stone while cooking my pizza and that made for a nice crust that was not too hard and not too soft but just right.  For the toppings I put cheese, pepperoni, red onions, bell peppers, and mushrooms. I then baked my pizza at 425 degrees for 20 minutes.

Best pizza dough!  My family loves it. I do bake it blind for a few minutes before adding the toppings so the bottom crust has time to get brown and the toppings don't get overdone.

Only made one change I put 1 cup of water not 7/8. Comes out the same.... PERFECT! I never use any other pizza recipe! For the best results use a pizza stone.

I am a big fan. I don't have a breadmaker so I had to mix the dough myself (I will be investing in one soon, It's a pain) but it was worth it.

I made this last weekend with my kids.  We had three different kinds of pizza, so I made three different kinds of crust.  Garlic for the pepperoni, garlic and herb for the black olive and plain for the pineapple.

This was wonderful. I added some basil with the flour but otherwise followed the directions exactly. The dough was incredibly easy to work with and it made a nice thick, lightly browned crust. I've found my go-to pizza recipe!

We've tried this recipe four different times (following it to a T), changing the type of yeast or flour, and still could not get a decent dough out of it.

Good Crust.  I subbed ½ c. semolina for some of the all purpose flour, which made the dough easy to handle and gives that great italian taste!

The only thing I would do is pre cook the crust for about 4 minutes before adding the toppings.  it took way too long to cook otherwise!! I thought it was delish and so did my 2 year old and 40 year old!!!!!!

Great and easy recipe. Did follow some suggestions to add onion powder. Make sure you let the dough rest for 10 -15 minutes on a lighty floured surface after it comes out of the bread machine. Use a pizza stone for a nice crispy crust. I usually use Trader Joe's pizza dough when I make pizzas, my hubby says this dough is better.

Thought this was great. Everyone loved it. Followed recipe,keeping in mind some reviews of it being bland. Pepped up the toppings. Formed by hand, grilled on panini maker and finished off toppings in toaster oven.  Just wonderful, making tonight on the grill!

This was my second attempt at homemade pizza crust and it was successful! The first time I had made the crust with no yeast, and this time I did. It came out great, nice dense crust.  I will season the crust a little more next time, as I thought it was kind of bland.

You have a GREAT basic recipe here..I used my bread machine and it turned out fantastic.  I used it for pizza, for cheese breadsticks, and even used it to create a crust for a Stromboli filled with ham and cheese.   It's my KEEPER recipe...super simple and I used basic flour and still liked it.

I enjoyed this simple, few ingredient recipe. I added a pinch of Italian spices to the bread machine to "kick it up a notch." My husband thought that the crust was too puffy. So, next time I may decrease the yeast a bit or try to spread the dough thinner.

Very pleased! Increased the servings to 17, as others had done, a split the recipe in two. Made exactly as written, except par-baked for 10 minutes, topped, and baked 10 minutes more. SUPER!

Very nice flavor and texture and easy to work with. I like a little thinner crust usually so I think I will divide the dough and make one large and one smaller pizza next time. Definitely a keeper.

Turned out great but a little wet, had to use extra flour to keep it from sticking after taking it out of the bread maker. Made 2 good size pizzas.

Great recipe-I added crushed red peppers and oregano.  Made it on a round pizza pan.  The dough is thick (I prefer it thinner) but it is a favorite at home!
