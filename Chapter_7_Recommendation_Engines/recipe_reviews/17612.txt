Just a comment on the crust.  Homemade Oreo crust is WAY  superior in taste compared to the store brought crust. IMHO store brought crust just lacks in taste & texture.  Once you compare the two, you'll see what I mean. For a homemade crust you Just need to crush about 24 regular oreos in a food processor and had about 1/4 c melted butter  to help keep it together.  That's it. A very easy step that will improve your end result greatly.  Also a springform pan is a MUST to cut & serve the pie. I used to make it in a glass pie plate and the crust would freeze like a rock to the bottom. The springform pan is a lifesaver!  I also drizzle a little Magic Shell topping in chocolate over the top..  My mom has been making this same recipe for at least 25 years and it NEVER fails to impress. A classic!

We have enjoyed this recipe in our family for years.  When I make this, I use a 9x13 pan and make sure I freeze it for 24 hours. To make the whip cream quickly and stiff enough, I freeze a metal bowl and use a stand mixer.

I was able to make this a little quicker using my Kitchen Aid mixer, I just chilled my bowl beforehand and used my whipping attachment. I also bent the ingredients just a touch. I did NOT have Creme De Menthe, I had Dekuyper's Peppermint Schapps so I used that instead. So easy it should be illegal. The end result was almost like eating peppermint bark in pie form. This pie is off the hook. Unbelievable. We absolutely loved it.

This pie was awesome!!  To make it easier, I used a prepared oreo crust.  To make it healtier, I used low fat cool whip instead of whipping cream.  To make it thick, I added one envelope of unflavored gelatin, softened in 1 tablespoon of very hot water.  We liked it best frozen.  This is definitely a keeper, and I will be making it again!!!

I would not cut back on the creme de menthe as one reviewer suggested - you wouldn't even taste it then. 1/4 cup is not much as it is. If you don't want kids to eat it then have something else for them - the kids at our party had ice cream, the adults ate the pie and that was only because they were toddlers. I would also not use cool whip as the sweetness would be too much. Real whipped cream was perfect. Follow the recipe and you will like this.

I used Thin Mint cookies for the crust instead of Oreo's. I like it minty!! It was fantastic. I took it to a friend's dinner party and it was the hit of the night. It was hard keeping the kids away from it, but the adults weren't about to share!

Awesome!!!  I only used about an eighth of a cup or more, instead of a fourth of a cup, of cream de menthe, and I think it was a lot better that way.  I also put some of the crushed oreos in the mixture itself to seem more like an oreo mint ice cream filling.  The kids loved it too.  This will become a tradition for us on Christmas.  Thanks for the recipe!

I like this recipe for its ease.  The marshmallow fluff takes a whole step out of the rest of the recipes (melting marshmallows in milk) and the kids loved it!!  Wanted to know when I was putting the grasshoppers in though!

Oh man, is this a tasty treat!  Although I cheated and used an already cookie pie crust, it was really easy to make.  If you're sensitive to having your kids eat something with liquor in it, I suggest trying another minty mix in.  But if you're like me and you're mainly making it for yourself, you'll enjoy the taste the Creme de Mint gives it!

This pie was amazing! I meant to serve it to everyone in my household to brag about my kitchen skills but ended up eating most of it myself. I used the recommended 1/4 cup of creme de menthe. The flavor was good but I would probably use a little more next time.

Easy to make and delicious. The pie crust is a little off.  You don't need that many cookies or butter. Freeze the bowl before you whip your cream in it.
It comes out much better and easier. or just use cool whip. Rinse your spoon in hot water to get the marshmellow creme out of the jar easier.

I thought it really lacked in mint flavor, and I'm not even the mint enthusiast in our family.  I didn't have any creme de menthe liqueur so I used Creme de Menthe Torani's syrup instead, so maybe that's what contributed to the lack of flavor?  Anyway, I gave it a second try for my husband's birthday as he LOVES mint, and ended up added nearly 2T of peppermint extract to the mint syrup which really added to the flavor.  I added a dash of syrup to the crumb mixture too.  I also cut down on the butter because as much as I love butter, 1/2 C was WAY too much and made it difficult to get it to cling to the bottom.  Finally, I didn't reserve any cookie for the top and instead melted some chocolate chips over a double-broiler with some peppermint extract and drizzled it over the top which made it look 5-star and quite stunning.  After the revisions, I ended up really liking it, but as it was originally written... not my favorite.

Other crust alternatives include using Oreo cookie crumbs and 1.5 tbsp of melted butter, or for individual desserts I use ready made dark chocolate cups.  Either way this is an awesome dessert for anyone who likes mint and chocolate.

This was good - as good as my moms?  Not sure.  But it was good and I will make again since I don't have my mom's recipe.  We only used 3Tablespoons of creme de menthe...and I think we could have used the whole 1/4 cup - but I was worried it would be too strong.

Wow so good.  Everyone loved it.  It was super easy to make and very delicious.  I did use a pre made oreo crust but I would like to try it with the homemade crust next time.  I would also like to make the filling and layer it in a parfait glass with some brownies too.   The 1/4 cup creme de menthe is perfect it was just the right amount of mint.

This is my favorite thing ever. I love it. I'm sure the homemade oreo crust is far better, but I usually just buy the premade crust because I am lazy and it is in a disposable pan with lid so I have less dishes. I also like to add Ande Mints pieces on top (you can usually find them by the chocolate chips) instead of the oreo, then crush some oreo up inside the the marshmellow/cream mixture. Also, 2 hours doesn't seem to do it...it needs at least 4-6 hours, but I usually just wait overnight. It is much better completley frozen

This was pretty good, but after tasting the filling I felt that it lacked "mintiness", if that's even a word, so I topped it with both the oreo crumbs and chopped up grasshopper cookies. I made this in an 11x7 pan and it worked out perfectly. Everyone seemed to enjoy it, but I don't know if I'd make it again. Thanks for sharing. :)

Good but it didn't set up enough until it froze for 24 hours.  Maybe I didn't beat the whipping cream enough, or too much?  I agree with some reviewers that say add more creme de menthe, just a bit more.  To save time I used a prepared Oreo crust.  I'll also try adding green food coloring for better color.

I also used a prepared cookie crust, used almost a full 16 oz. container of Fluff, and 1/2 cup of creme de menthe. The filling tastes delicious and I would suggest buying some mini chocolate crusts for any extra filling you might end up with -- why waste?

This is my husband's favorite dessert. It works great in a pie pan as well as a spring form pan.

Easy to make a delicious! Has an ice cream consistency. I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be minty enough. Family loved it. Perfect for the holidays.

one of my pet peeves, dont complain a recipe doesn't have the minty flavor you desire if you don't use the ingrdients on hand and substitute a flavored syrup instead of creme de menthe. It always bothers me when people give a recipe a poor review when they didnt follow it in the first place. I always try it as written when possible then make adjustments.  just saying
my family preferes cool whip as it holds up better but either way this recipe works better than many . Try it as written

While the flavor was great! I could not get the crust to cut and come out with the pie. The filling melted quickly and made a big mess, but the crust was hard as a rock from freezing...tried putting in warm bath, but only made the filling messier.  Again, the flavor was great! Just not very easy to cut and serve so presentation was lacking.

This pie was very easy to make.  I just didn't like it.  It had that liquor wang to it, like I just took a straight shot of creme de menthe.  I believe if you cut back on the creme de menth, you couldn't taste any mint.  My girlfriend said she liked it pretty well, but I don't think I'll be making it again.

This would be easy to prepare (and I'm sure, would have been delicious), if I had an electric mixer.  WORD TO THE WISE: don't try to whip cream by hand.  It is torture.  For me, this recipe didn't work because, without the whipped cream to fold in (my friends and I whipped it manually for 25 minutes and still ended up with liquid) I had to substitute cool whip... and it tasted weird and kind of strong.  Also, the filling never froze, it oozed.  I had to finally just put this in a bowl and top it with ice cream, which was fine... but not a pie.

I used an Oreo  purchased crust which was a bit smaller, so had extra filling. Do note that it does need  to be made the day before to give it time to set up. I topped it with shaved chocolate. Got rave reviews in St. Pat's Day!

I didn't give it 5 stars because I made some changes. One of my guests was gluten free, so I used Trader Joe's gluten free  Jo-Jos. You really couldn't tell the difference. I used 1/2 pt. of whipping cream, 2 c. marshmallow creme and only  1 1/2 oz. of Creme de Menthe. The pie was delicious and so easy.  Will definitely make again.

I made this into parfaits and it was outstanding! I crumbled a few chocolate cookies (no butter) in the bottoms of stemmed glasses. I mixed the remaining ingredients according to the recipe, then topped the cookies with about 3 tablespoons of filling, crumbled more cookies and topped off with filling. Garnished with one chocolate cookie and one Andi's chocolate candy. Such a big hit at my dinner party on St. Patrick's Day. The only substitution that I made was using Peppermint Schnapps instead of Cream DeMent which was not available.

This was a simple enough recipe but I like it mintier so I added a teaspoon of peppermint extract and used Mint Oreo cookies for the base. I will be making again for sure!

So yummy!  Took the advice of one of the recommendations and used a springfoam pan.  Looked AND tasted great.  Used oreos but think will try with girl scout thin mint cookies next time.

This pie is delicious! I was pressed for time so I used the store bought crust, next time I'll make my own. Nonetheless, the pie was amazing and loved by everyone in the family. I followed the recipe exactly. I suggest letting it set in the freezer for at least 7-8 hours.

Great taste, but whatever you do, ignore the 'remove 20 minutes before serving' bit. That ruins it :(

This is melt-in-your-mouth good. Caution, though, for people who are used to eating "clean". This is chock-full of corn syrup. I don't feed my family much corn syrup, nor do I eat it.  I decided to live it up for my party, and not worry about it...REGRET that decision!! So, if you think that you are sensitive to corn syrup, I would suggest finding, or creating a different recipe. (My kids want me to come up with one without the liquor for them. Maybe I'll just make it a healthier version for everyone.)

The suggestions to reduce the creme de menthe was right on. I used half and it was plenty. It had very little color, so I added a few drops of green food coloring. Garnished with fresh mint for Easter consumption. Yumm!!!
