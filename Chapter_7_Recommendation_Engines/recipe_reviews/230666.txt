Super easy to make and very tasty. I will use this one again. The sauce will make a good dipping sauce for Chinese dumplings and pot stickers.

I loved the simplicity and the fact that I had nearly everything on hand.  I added a bit of apple cider vinegar and olive oil to make up for a slight shortage on the Italian dressing.  I also substituted diced frozen chicken breast tenders as that was what I had available.  Because of the tenders, I reduced cooking time by about 10 minutes.  My family loved this meal and I will definitely be making it again.

Simple Soy Sauce Chicken Haiku: "Used as marinade, and stir-fried chicken instead. But made as written." I mixed up all of the above ingredients as the recipe states, and realized that there was no reason not to treat it as a marinade instead, so I let the cubed chicken swim in it for about 4 hrs., then quick stir-fried the chicken, can mushrooms, and a floppy looking onion half that was lonely in the fridge, and served it all over rice w/ a steamed veggie side. I didn't like the Italian dressing flavor and would've preferred that part was just olive oil, and we also thought it was in need of salt at serving, but maybe that's b/c I usually use low-sodium soy sauce. But it was quite tasty and I do believe that I'd make it again.

I only had the olive gardens Italian dressing but i tried out anyway with fresh chopped onion. The sauce is phenomenal and i let flavors marry before cooking, but i enjoyed this recipe. Single and easy just like i like it!

I really loved this! 
I used a homemade Italian style dressing and boneless skinless chicken thighs. I used my slow cooker (a couple hours on high and a few more on low) and the chicken just fell apart. I also added some parsley and scallions at the end. Definitely a keeper!

Great recipe, I did a few alterations though. I pulled apart a rotisserie chicken and made double the sauce. I minced a fresh onion instead of the dried onion. (mainly because that's all I had) I would use a little less soy sauce next time because it was a little overwhelming for my tastes. Would be great with a stir fry mix of veggies and some peanuts. Overall great recipe.
