It was great.  Easy to fix.  Tasted real good. Tastes just as good, if not better, two days later.  I followed the recipe exactly, using gluten-free pasta rather than regular.  I think that if a 3yo was not in the household, I would double the cayenne.

This is a great change from regular spaghetti.  Great with a salad & rolls or garlic bread, easy to make & will feed alot of people.  You can use jalapenos instead of the chili peppers to spice it up a bit, but no need to make any other alterations.  Great just like it is.

Just made this awesome dish and loved it!  I did make a few variations to use what I had and like, but this versatile recipe allowed for that.  Here's what I changed:  I added a can of artichoke hearts, used Parmesan and Swiss cheese instead of the cheddar, used 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can cream of chicken, used 1 c. Water since I didn't have any broth and crushed up Italian bread crumbs in place of the panko bread crumbs.  I did use the same seasonings, but used very little cayenne pepper and left out the green chiles and tomatoes ( my kids don't like them.)  Loved how it came together and turned out!

I love this recipe. If you are looking for a very moist chicken spaghetti then this is not the one you want. This recipe can be cut like a lasagna. It has a great texture & loaded with flavor. I have made this many times & it always comes out great!

I made changes so I'll give it 5 stars but my version was probably a 3 star.

I didn't have mushrooms or celery so I subbed broccoli. The broccoli was actually the best part of the dish. I also didn't have cream of mushroom, but had cream of chicken, so I used that.

I used whole wheat pasta and it turned out well in terms of consistency. Maybe if I had followed the recipe it would've been better. It kind of was a one note dish. The flavors melded almost too much.

Awesome!! We all loved it! My husband and son don't love mushrooms, so I omitted them. I also finely chopped one red bell, and a couple of garlic cloves and added these to the celery and onion while sauteeing. I used about three cups of baked, shredded chicken, and added a cup of shredded parmesan with the cheddar. My goodness, you'd have thought I'd cooked something gourmet... lol... Thanks for the recipe!! Yummy!

I used 2 small cans of mushroom pieces instead of fresh. No celery, but one can cream of celery soup and one can cream of mushroom soup. I used a can of rotel instead of diced tomatoes and fresh jalape√±o instead of a can of chilies. I used regular sharp cheddar instead of white and I topped with buttery cracker crumbs instead of panko

Great dish. Very rich, can't even begin to imagine the calories. I did not use all the ingredients because I didn't have them all. But everyone love it and it made two glass pans full. Leftovers for my husbands dinner. Win/win!

I made almost exactly as is except used 2 c of velveeta cheese,  no celery and a whole rotisserie chicken. .This was amazing! I also used Italian flavored panko bread crumbs. This came out moist, and full of flavor! 13x9 pan was more than enough for a family of 4! Adding it to my main go to dinners now!

Great recipe! I left off the breadcrumbs on top (and butter) and didn't have any mushrooms or celery on hand.  Even so, it was a huge hit with my husband, who isn't a major pasta fan.  I'll bet the left overs will be even better tomorrow! Only thing I added was putting it under the broiler at the end--I added a little extra cheese on the top before it went into the oven.  Devine!!

This is fabulous!  Don't skimp on the mushrooms or chicken, and cut back on the pasta.  I cooked 6 very small chicken breasts in the crock pot with half a bottle of lite italian dressing for 4 hours on high.  The chicken fell apart when I shredded it.  I used a little of the broth from the crock pot instead of the chicken broth.  I also used a 2 cup bag of Italian Mix cheese simply because I didn't want to have to shred a block of white cheddar (I can't get shredded at my grocery).  You want the final mixture to be thick and evenly distributed rather than heavy on the pasta.  Definitely don't skip the last step.  It adds a nice crunch to the dish.  My husband loved it!

I have tried a couple other recipes for this dish and this one is my favorite so far. I left out the onions, tomatoes, and mushrooms and added 2 cans of Rotel original. I also added a cup of vegetable broth instead of using chicken broth.  Both my wife and I were very pleased with the results. made lots of leftovers to freeze for work lunches.

Really good recipe. I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was. Very simple and easy to make. I could not find the white sharp cheddar cheese so I used Colby jack cheese instead. I also added Cajun seasoning for a little kick. Overall my family loved it!

I followed a few other reviews. I used one can  of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken soup.I also used fire roasted tomatoes and Italian Style shredded cheese. I used chicken tenderloins. I cut them into bite sized pieces and cooked them in olive oil with oregano and garlic salt. This recipe turned out amazing!

this was amazing!! I added more chiles, diced tomatoes, and mushrooms! and I added some green peppers while cooking the onions, celery and mushrooms!  I couldn't find the white cheddar cheese, so I used a combo of sharp cheddar and a white hot pepper blend shredded cheeses. It made a lot so I froze whatever I couldn't fit in the dish!!  I will definitely make this again, especially since everyone who ate, (especially my son) loved it!!!

This was delicious. Made this today for our family Easter lunch. I doubled the recipe because we had 9 adults and 4 children and the recipe states makes 8 servings. It made enough for two casseroles, one 9 X 13 and one 8 X 11 and still had to put some in the freezer for later. Everyone went back for seconds. This is a keeper.

Very good, and very easy to make.  I kept it to one pan by cooking and draining the spaghetti, then browning veggies in the same pan.  Lastly, I combined the rest of the ingredients into the pan and baked it.  I didn't bother with the panko crust topping, and only used 2 T. of butter to saute the veggies.  That, along with using low fat cream of mushroom soup and low fat sour cream made it healthier.  I could have cut the fat even more, if I'd had low-fat shredded cheese.  I used bow-tie pasta and that worked well.  This is definitely something I'd make again and would be great for covered-dish potlucks.

I didn‚Äôt have celery but still tasted great. Only trouble was I must have used too much soup as it turned out a bit too runny. But taste was great.

What taste was there was good overall, but it was very bland. I would suggest lowering the amount of spaghetti used to bring the ratio of sauce and flavor up

This was great!  I thought it might be too spicy so I left out the red pepper and didn't want to splurge for the celery.  I used canned mushrooms and frozen pre-cooked chicken to save time.  My hubby loved it!  It definitely fills a 9x13 pan, though... ours bubbled over in the oven.  Great family dinner!

I did not love this recipe as written, but in full disclosure I simply forgot the onion.  However, I don't think that would've changed the stars on this one for me.  I think I would be willing to try it again, and sub out some of the veggies for some others as the original author suggested.  I think I would prefer it with zucchini or asparagus over the green chiles.  I just was not a huge fan of that taste in this recipe.  decent base though, and an interesting way to use spaghetti outside of the standard dish.
