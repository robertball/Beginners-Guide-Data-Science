Yummy. I love eating this for breakfast. I use about 3/4 teaspoon of salt and roasted rava. (You can buy roasted rava or dry roast it yourself.)

Just delicious! I omitted the tomato for breakfast, it's a bit too acid for me.

I have a Indian friend and have always looked for a Upma recipe that comes close to his! I found it.
Have made it without Cashews too! Just as yummy!

This is like cream of wheat on steroids!  Big, savory flavors, and the heat is softened by the sooji!  The leftovers were even better, as the lentils and seeds were less crunchy.  Definitely a repeater.

Great recipe.  Tastes like how my mom makes it. I left out the lemon juice and ghee, but still tastes great!

This is a delicious and unusual way to prepare semolina. I don't enjoy boiled semolina, but I liked this recipe. This makes very good breakfast. Thanks!
