This is so easy to make. I have made this recipe with different fruits and berries and it turnes out just as good. The cookie cobbler crust is a snap to cut and lay on the fruit. I have used the cookies that have bunnies or santas on them for a fun way to serve them.  I'm all for a easy to put together but not short on good taste. If this is what you are looking for then I would say try this recipe.

Easy and delicious.  Made for a dinner party with harvests from the garden, to uniformly rave reviews.  Added 1/4 tsp of ground cardamom and 1 tsp vanilla.

Great fattening idea! I've never liked cobbler before but suspected the cookie dough was going to change that. I used my own filling so sorry this isn't the most accurate review.

Easy recipe.  I would have liked it a little better with less rhubarb it was a bit tart for my liking.  But overall, no complaints.  I served with vanilla ice cream on top.

I have always loved Strawberry Rhubarb pie.  I thought the rhubarb flavor was spot on for my liking. Every bite you have a little sweet and tart.  My only issue with the recipe was the cookie on top.  It tend to be a little gooey for my liking.  It needed something to hold it together more.

I made it with a fresh strawberry pie filling instead of canned.  I have tried many cobbler recipes and it is a 'must' to use sugar cookie dough on top!
