This is an awsome recipe. I used a presure cooker to cook the beets, about 5 minutes, then just let them cool & peel.

I just picked up some beets @ the Farmers market and tried them for the first time.  I made this recipe and really enjoyed it!  I only added a little onion as I wanted my kids to like it.  Refreshing and a great new twist on a side dish.  Looking forward to trying more beet recipes! Thanks so much.

I thought that there was to much sugar added in this after I tasted it.  So I added an extra tablespoon of vinegar and then decided to let it set and see what happened with it. It was ok but still to sweet. Ended up adding Italian dressing to this. Which made it really good.

Who says something has to be complicated to be yummy?  This was just perfect!  I used some roasted beets I had leftover from another salad recipe.

This is a wonderful way to serve this healthy vegetable. The addition of onion and vinegar and sugar "perk up" the beets perfectly.
