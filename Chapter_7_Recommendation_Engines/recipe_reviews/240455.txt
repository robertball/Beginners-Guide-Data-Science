Having just read a great article about healthy substitutions, I wanted to try this healthy recipe and see if I could apply what I read.  I used low fat buttermilk for the milk, cut the oil in half and used unsweetened applesauce for the other half.  Because of that, I would recommend not using the vanilla.  They came out great!  Thanks for a good recipe!

My husband and I really like these waffles. I did make some modification to this recipe. I used soy milk. The all purpose flour was replaced with whole wheat pastry flour. I had olive oil instead of canola so I used it.

Great recipe!  It made 6 fluffy, light waffles.  Sometime ww flour can produce dense breads, but one was great.  I took the advice of other reviews and used 1/4 cup of apple sauce and 1/4 cup of coconut oil.  I still used vanilla extract, despite one of the comments and would do it again because i think it needs it.  I also added a bit of cinnamon because i love the combination with bananas.  I was pleasantly surprised that I did not need to add sugar!  For those who like it sweeter, if you add some syrup or confectioners sugar, it's just right.  Definitely a keeper!

Added a bit of cinnamon and they tasted delicious.  Perhaps next time they needed a bit more time as, after 4 minutes, they were just a bit soggy.

I made them as written and they are delicious! Nice and crisp with a great banana flavor that isn’t overpowering.

Spent years trying different waffle recipes (books and google searches) - usually to use up those last two bananas that all-of-a-sudden-went-brown.  This is hands-down the best recipe.  I didn’t realize that I had run out of whole wheat flour so used all white.  I was concerned that batter was too thin but they all came out perfect - light and fluffy.  Used melted coconut oil for the waffle iron.  Super pleased and the Littles were, too!

These were great!  I added 4 scoops of protein powder (not sweet, just whey protein), used plain yogurt in place of the oil and added 1/3 cup of ground flaxseed to up the nutritional content.  They were great- didn't need much syrup because of the bananas.  Thanks so much!

Will definitely make again. I doubled it for my large family and used my mixer. Loved that I could use up all the overly ripe bananas

My family really loved these waffles.  I did make some modifications.  I used a combination of oat bran and ground flax instead of the all purpose flour. I used almond milk instead of regular milk and I added a tsp of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg.  They were delicious!

Delicious! I put all the wet ingredients (including the banana) and spices into a blender and pureed for a few seconds before adding to the dry ingredients.  I sprinkled chopped walnuts on top just before closing the waffle maker.  I will definitely be making these again.

I used fat free half and half instead of milk. I added 1 tsp. each of cinnamon and vanilla. These waffles tastes like banana bread, very tasty.
