I enjoyed this dinner, but I was suprised by how dry it was.  It needs a sauce similar to au gratin potatoes: I would like to see someone post a comment or new recipe that incorporates a sauce to bind these ingredients together.  Since there is not much water, you have to be careful not to burn the sausage while you cook the potatoes.  (I think it would be better to put the potatoes in a few minutes after the sausage has been cooking.)  Also I used frozen hash brown potatoes to make it easier, but I should have put the onion in with the sausage, since it took longer to cook than the hash browns.  To summarize: start the sausage and onion at the same time.  Add the potatoes four minutes later with some kind of cheese sauce, then you would have a five star recipe.

I made a vegetarian version of this using veggie sausage crumbles.  This recipe is highly adaptable and was a great way for me to use up some odds and ends of frozen vegetables.  Simple, and doesn't make a lot of mess, especially if you use frozen diced potatoes and onions.

It's a good meat and potatoes quick meal that gives you your vegetables, too. I substituted the sausage with just seasoned ground beef and it tasted good. I used lots of garlic powder in the meat and a little bit of Lawry's Seasoning salt.

I skipped the mixed veggies on this simply because I don't like the frozen combos and didn't have any fresh available. We were amazed at how delicious this simple meal was. The flavor, at first, was a bit bland, but we seasoned with celery salt, and it was fantastic!

Simple ingredients come together for an easy, quick & delicious meal. I added frozen peas and whatever fresh veggies I had leftover in the fridge. The leftovers tasted great the next day with an egg on top.

I didn't taste this (not a sausage fan), but this simple recipe went over really well with the men in my house.  No frills, just stick-to-your-ribs good.  I added some minced garlic; that's the only change I made. I accompanied it with a couple of fried eggs, over-easy...they gobbled it up.

A good, easy meal.  Next time will use spicy sausage instead of mild and add italian seasoning and garlic since it was a little bland.  My husband enjoyed topping his with sour cream.

This was a great summer meal (b/c you don't have to turn the oven on!) and had lots of vegetables and tons of flavor from the sausage.  I substituted mild italian chicken sausage (just removed the casings they came in) and a few red potatoes with the skin on because thats what we had in the house.  I doubled the recipe and my husband and I finished the whole thing- yum!

I have found a solution to the dryness of this dish that others have encountered. While it does change it from a hash, it really does help hold it all together. I added one can of Campbell's healthy request broccoli cheddar soup and a 1/2 cup of milk after you brown everything.  I stirred them both in, simmered until bubbly and then added frozen veggies and cooked until hot through. Very nice addition.  You could also you cheddar cheese soup and adjust milk to your liking.

Made this tonight with Chorizo, frozen mixed veggies (peas/carrots/green beans/corn), russet potatoes, and onions. It was really great! The natural grease from the Chorizo kept everything very moist.

This came out really good. I did not have sausage or frozen veggies so I used bacon and canned instead. My husband really likes meat & potato meals like this. I would definately make this again. With the leftovers we put it in burritos with salsa. Really yummy that way!

We used frozen hash browns and a Santa Fe blend of frozen veggies and thought it turned out great.  We will definitely be trying many versions of this - it was tasty and easy.

Yummy! I made this using lil smokies. I found that putting a cover on after adding the vegetables helped. The vegetables didn't seem to be getting hot at all until I did, and it also helped to melt the cheese too! I was so hungry after smelling it that I forgot to take a picture!

I have made a similar dish that our family calls Stovetop Casserole.  It usually include any leftover in the fridge.  The meat could be sausage, hamburger or turkey burger.  Then it could be rice or potatoes, whatever is there, and then whatever veggie, though I will cook up the mixed veggies if I don't have enough of them.  I always start with onion, garlic and peppers.  And the spices could be whatever I fancy.  Though my hand usually grabs one of Mrs. Dash's seasoning - either the garlic or onion blend.  And maybe some basil or oregano.  Just depends.  We all love it.

Fixed this tonight for my husband and I and it was a success.  I used some left over peas and added some fresh sliced mushrooms and a few tablespoons of cooking wine.  I seasoned with peper and garlic powder, we love cheese so I doubled it that and this turned out very tasty.  Quick and easy.

Pretty good, I added some more seasoning, and before I added the cheese I put 4 tablespoons of sour cream mixed it in really well. It was creamy and delicious.

I used hot Italian sausage.  I also used yellow squash instead of the mixed vegetables and instead of dicing the potatoes and squash, I sliced them both thin and added a little minced garlic and J.O. spice. Nice easy meal.

Easy dinner for two! I added fresh garlic that I fried with the onion. Then I later added basil, paprika, cayenne pepper, garlic salt (not a lot because kielbasa can be salty by itself), and pepper. Yum!

We love it! It's my husband's favorite. He suggested adding some scrambled eggs to it and it worked! I've used regular bulk sausage, a mix of regular and hot Italian sausage, and a mix of regular and chorizo sausages. All work great!

This was really tasty. I used turkey sausage seasoned with rosemary and added a can of diced tomatoes (drained). I'll definitely be making this hearty meal again.

If your hash is dry then add a fried egg or two!  That yolk will add a nice creaminess for sure.Delish, used bacon instead of sausage and fresh veggies for the frozen which was chopped asparagus and bell peppers.  SO GOOD!

Yummy!  Of course I messed with it...I didn't have mixed veggies so I used thinly sliced Brussels sprouts, mushrooms, and fresh garlic, and used beer instead of sautéing oil...at the end, I added some sour cream and fresh Parmesan...it was delicious!!

I loved this recipe as is. I used a sweeter sausage and seasoned with sea salt and garlic pepper.  Sprinkled some mild cheddar cheese on top and let it melt while I make some toast to go with.  Delicious!

This was absolutely amazing!  I made a double batch in a wok and it fried up absolutely perfectly.  You need to make sure to stir it pretty frequently, though, otherwise it will stick to the bottom of the pan.

I used ground beef to make this recipe.  I cooked the potatoes first- but not long enough (I'm impatient).  Next time I'll probably boil them first then add them to the skillet.  I also added some garlic to the potato and onion as they cooked. Other reviewers said the recipe was dry, so towards the end of cooking I added some milk to make a cheesy-type sauce and it turned out really tasty.  I doubled the recipe to make enough for my family of 4 and it made at least 8 servings! So, I'd say the recipe as written will give you 4 servings.

Cooked recipe tonight.  Served with eggs.  Husband loved it!.  Cooked onions, sausage and chopped celery together. Added potatoes as recipe said.  One thing I did was I cooked the mixed vegetables in microwave cook bag before I added them.  Added them along with any water that cooked out of them.  Turned burner down and covered and steamed a little.  Added a little season salt and pepper. Before serving added cheese.  Was moist and flavorful!  Husband said he wanted to eat it again!  Got a hug and he said that was good, which normally does not happen when I cook something!

Recipe is a great idea! I used ingredients on hand. Sauteed onions in bit of olive oil, added raw diced potatoe, sprinkled with pinch of sea salt and covered to cook until soft/crispy. Placed aside. In same skillet, browned Jimny Dean Reduced fat sausage. Added potatoes, mixed veggies from can & a bit of frozen chopped broccoli. Covered on low heat. Thx to other reviews, I topped hubby's serving with 2 fried eggs. Breakfast bliss for dinner. Thanks!

I do this with deer burger and without cheese.  More seasons and 1/4 cup of water to get the Vegis steamed.  Quick and easy.

This was a simple and  hearty meal.  Not to mention quick and yummy.   I used ground beef instead of sausage and added red bell peppers to the mix.  I also added garlic and other spices that I knew my family would enjoy.  Needless to say, it was hit.  Thanks for posting.  As far as the recipe being a little dry, I guess you could use a little stock (of choice) or maybe a little tomato sauce to bind all the ingredients together.  I did not need or use it, but I could see where some people may think that.  Overall a good choice for dinner.

This was really good and quick.  It is hash and hash is not a saucy dish so I was a little surprised that some thought a hash would be really moist.  Also, I find it shocking that someone would negatively rate the dish without even making it.  That is not helpful.  A cream sauce can always be put on TOP of a hash.  Also, I recently had a very similar dish at a brunch and it was served with an egg on top.  The mixed vegetables were omitted.  I love this dish, but I really like sausage.

I tried this recipe today and the family loved it.  I used hot sausage and just used the grease that came off the sausage instead of adding vegetable oil, seasoned it to my taste and it came out great.  I will make this dish again real soon.

It was pretty good, but I agree with another reviewer that said it needs some sort of creamy sauce to go with it. My husband liked it a lot though.

It sounds like a lot of sausage of only 2 servings!  But I'm not much of a sausage fan.
