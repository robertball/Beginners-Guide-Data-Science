I made this using non-fat sweetened milk, low-fat whipped topping, and reduced-fat pie crust. My family still loved it. I added a few more strawberries and put a ring of strawberries on the top for presentation.

It was tasty. Not runny or liquid like at all. But it was a little too sweet. Towards the end of one piece I felt it was a little too much - but wow - it tasted really good!

This is not an "omigosh, that's good" recipe, but it's quick, and fairly tasty. I wouldn't take it to a potluck, but I can't say that if I wound up with an abundance of strawberries that I wouldn't make it either...I added a bit more lemon, because it seemed a little too sweet for me, and made it with dream whip (the kind you mix up yourself) instead of cool whip, that could have made a bit of a sweetness difference. Good recipe, but I think I would've preferred to spend a little more time to make a traditional strawberry pie. Thanks for the recipe, though.

I am new to the cooking world and tried this recipe. I had to call my dad to find out what was wrong with my pie! It was all liquid. What is not in the recipe is gelatin. After I added the gelatin the pie hardened. The rest of the recipe made the pie taste good.

I don't think that my pie ever set because the moment I pulled it out of the refrigerator it would soften considerably . I left out the food coloring since my pie was a nice shade of pastel pink. The taste was just okay to me. I don't believe I will be making this again.

I used a homemade piecrust instead and it was really good, but I am sure the graham cracker crust is equally as good.  My berries were too tart to eat alone, but in the pie they are perfect.

I have made something similar a number of years ago but lost my recipe
So I tried this , it turned out runny.
