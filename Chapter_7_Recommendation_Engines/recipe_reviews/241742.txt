It wasn't bad .. I made my own cake recipe instead of a package of strawberry cake mix , and i coloured my cake mixture with a quarter of strawberry jell-o package.. I think it was a good idea if you don't have a strawberry cake mix .. I reduced the amount of the flan mixture into the half because my pan was smaller in size.. One thing that i think was a big mistake following in this recipe is putting the cake pan after the gelatine was cold and set in a boiling water .. It was a disaster , the gelatine turned into liquid all over again and so i had to return it into the refrigerator 6 hours again ..Or maybe it was my mistake putting boiling water instead of just warm water ! So i would recommend to skip this part and just invert the the cake pan normally and just tap hard on the pan edges to loosen it and it would come out just perfect.. Overall the shape of the cake with the three layers was lovely!! This recipe will be a keeper for sure

I made it exactly as recipe directed. It's so delicious, such a big hit.  Just be careful when you transfer to a serving plate. If you put the pan in hot water the jello melts really fast, so I put it back in the refrigerator until form sets, then I flipped it on a serving tray and wet a towel with hot water placed it over the pan and it came out perfect. Thank you for the recipe. Great job.

yes I will make it again, this time the jello ended up on  top of the cake, even do I was very careful not to touch the cake, I think the cake and flan was to heavy,and it sank to the bottom, taste is good, I will try one more time ,and see what happen.Thanks it looks pretty in the picture.
