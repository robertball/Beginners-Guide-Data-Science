Easily a five star recipe! This is healthy, crisp, refreshing and it's packed with flavors of goodness. The only thing I changed was making the zucchini and squash into zoodles and sqoodles. Perfect for showing off to company or any other time. Thank you for the keeper LREYNAL.

This was OK.  Not sure I would make again.  I was in search of a dish to take to 4th of July BBQ that wouldn't melt or contain mayo to spoil and this fit the bill, but was not a favorite.  I did grill up the leftovers and it was OK, too.

It’s a light, healthy dish that’s easy to make. Definitely adding to my usual rotation.

What a great salad - Flavorful, healthy, and fun!
Made as directed and loved it. Will work with other veggies too, next time I think I'll add some fresh baby spinach and broccoli florets.
