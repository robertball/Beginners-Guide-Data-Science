This icing gets a 5 for ease and taste.  I melted the chocolate in the microwave and once melted added the sour cream- SO EASY!! Love this recipe.

Gorgeous, very tasty. I used belgian white chocolate....quite sweet and waited for chocolate to cool in a cold water bath then electric whisked the sour cream in. It goes very stiff due to the cold cream then becomes lovely. If you add the cold cream to warm chocolate i imagine it will split, so let the choc cool.

I must have missed something.  Sour cream and white chocolate and nothing else? I won't be making this one again. I thought I followed the recipe to the "T" but the instant I added the sour cream (to the well cooled white chocolate), it instantly clumped. No amount of beating in my electric mixer would have smoothed this out. I had to add powdered sugar to salvage the frosting. Still, it's not the way I expected frosting to taste. I added a pinch of salt to insure it wasn't overly sweet when I added the powdered sugar.

In baking and cooking, when you are attempting to combine warmed melted solids with cool non-solids (or cool non-solids that will become solid when mixed with warmed non-solids), and you would like to have the result of a creamy non-clumpy substance, you need to take the time to introduce the two ingredients slowly.  It also helps if you also get your cool substance to or close to room temperature. 

Therefore with this recipe, I measured out my sour cream and set it aside to become room temperature.  Then I melted the white chocolate chips and stirred them with a fork to a cooler state.  When I felt that they were at the correct temperature but not again solid chocolate, I drizzled the white chocolate into the sour cream while I was mixing on low speed.  Once they were creamed together I turned up the speed to high to make the mixture thicken. As with any cream based product, the more you mix it the thicker it will become but you must be careful you do not over beat.

This recipe is more of an icing than a frosting in my opinion. Therefore I added 2 cups of powdered sugar and a tablespoon of pure vanilla extract. Add additional powdered sugar ¼ cup at a time until your desired thickness.  My addition to this recipe made the mixture more like a frosting for my taste and it retained the white chocolate flavor due to the additional vanilla.


So no problems with this recipe. It turned out excellent!!!

It went really well with Aini's Strawberry Cupcakes. I used about 150 grams of white Fazer baking chocolate, and a bit less than 100 grams of Creme Fraiche. To speed cooling, I floated the glass bowl with the hot chocolate in a pot of ice water and continued stirring until almost set. The creme fraiche/choc mixture was a bit lumpy at first, but after stirring turned a beautiful consistency, perfect for cakes or cupcakes. super, super sweet taste, but I guess that depends on your brand of chocolate.

Used good quality white chocolate, melted in the microwave.  Put sour cream in a larger bowl and used electric beaters to whip for half a minute then slowly drizzled in the cooled chocolate.  No lumps, and a light whipped texture.  Beautiful flavour, not too sweet - perfect to top the white chocolate mud cake I made.  Many thanks for the easiest "gourmet" frosting recipe ever!

This did not get thick enough, which made me sad because the taste was really good and would have went well with my chocolate cake with raspberry filling :(

This recipe was great - really tasty and easy - I added icing sugar to make it thicker - I found it kind of runny and it kept sliding off the cake, but all in all really good!

This frosting is the perfect compliment to a super-sweet cake. I used it with the "Black Magic Cake".

I liked the constinency of this frosting, but I would add some icing sugar next time to make it a bit sweeter.

Followed recipe and it turned out a bit too tangy for my taste so I ended up adding more white chocolate. I give 4 stars because my husband really liked it and it was super easy. Just okay for me though, not sure I would make it again.

I really, really like this icing!!! :) It does always clump a little...but it is SO worth it! It isn't the icing you should pick if you're going for beauty...but if you're going for taste...than this is the BEST!!!!

This recipe is more like a glaze like another reviewer said. I followed their directions to wait until both are room temp and added the chocolate to the sour cream slowly. I also added about 1 cup of powered sugar and tablespoon of vanilla. This was pretty runny. I even put it in the fridge for a half hour and its still runny. Not sure what I did wrong but it tastes good.

This is a great base for a frosting recipe! I melted the white chocolate in the microwave, stirred it well, and then added the sour cream. Next, I added 3 cups of powdered sugar and beat for a few minutes with an electric mixer. When I was done I poured it over my cake. To let it set good, I stored the cake in the refrigerator. The taste was absolutely amazing!!!

The taste was OK but other than that it was too runny, even after letting it set in the refrigerator for a while it was still too runny! maybe I should have used something to thicken it but oh well...I couldn't even use it on my sons birthday cake!!
