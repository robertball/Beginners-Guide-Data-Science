Absolutely the best!! I made it for thanksgiving.  I had a fresh orange on hand, so I zested it and added, and it made a difference (I love orange peel), but it would have still be great without it, as another user said.  I did cut down the vinegar to 2TBsp as recommended by most.  (I doubled the recipe and used 1/4 cup).  I was not sure which apples to use, so I asked someone, and they recommended MacIntosh (they break down better)...worked well.  Amazing recipe!  I loved it!  This will be my standard cranberry sauce from now on.  Thank you very much!!!  Those who did not try it because they dont like cranberries have no idea what they are missing!

This is an absoltely addictive chutney, with layers of flavor. I substitued craisins for raisins, and used two whole cinnamon sticks, 10 whole cloves, a nub of fresh ginger and a sprinkle of cayenne for heat. I also reduced the vinegar just slightly, but don't think that is necessary. Once the chutney sits and the flavors meld, the vinegar flavor really mellows out. I'm making another huge batch of this for Christmas gifts today!

This chutney has a wonderful flavor and texture. It goes very well with turkey.  However, cut back the cider vinegar to 2 tablespoons.  The whole family just loved it.  Fun to make too.---Diana G.

This one is incredible.  I made it, as a change of pace, for Thanksgiving dinner, to have along with the more traditional kind.  It went fast.  I had to make a second batch to eat with the leftovers, it was so good.  I made it the night before, and it was very sharp tasting, when it was fresh, and still warm.  I was worried that it would be too tart, but a night in the fridge mellowed it perfectly.  Made it a bunch of times since, it's great just to eat off the spoon.  Thanks for a new classic recipe in my house, I highly recommend this one.

***THREE YEARS LATER- We still use this as our traditional cranberry sauce on holidays, and throughout the year, and we still LOVE IT!!

I have made this cranberry relish for 4 years now, with excellent results every time.  I use the recipie as written, with fuji apples.  The only thing different is that I simmer for much longer than 10 minutes.  It's more like 20 minutes, and then I turn the heat off and mash it all together with a potato masher.  It is heavenly!  I just finished my Thanksgiving day batch just now.  I may cheat and make a cold cut turkey sandwich just so that I can savor the warm sauce!  Tomorrow it will be served at room temperature for all to enjoy.

~ Cheers

Wonderful recipe!  Full of taste, definately better than that yucky looking stuff most people use out of the can.  I personally don't like cranberry sauce but I continue to eat this one, it has a wonderful flavor (I love the apples) and I love the smell of this when it's cooking.  I ended up having to make another batch before dinner because it was gone by the time the bird was done :o).

Folks, please keep in mind that this recipe is a chutney. It's meant to have a "pickled" flavor; hence the amount of vinegar. If you want something more like regular American cranberry sauce then definitely reduce the vinegar to only 1-2 tablespoons. 
I've been making this recipe for years now and absolutely love it, both as written as chutney or with reduced vinegar as cranberry sauce with an outstanding, unusual spiced flavor.

I've never eaten cranberry "roll" or sauce, it just seemed yucky to me, but it was requested for Thanksgiving and this recipe seemed interesting.  I loved it!  I think it was the combination of fresh cranberries and apples with all the lovely spices!  I couldn't wait to eat the leftover turkey with this and the house smelled wonderful.  I only changed a couple of things...only 1/4 cup of cider vinegar, added 2 tablespoons of brown sugar and left out the raisins.  This was YUMMY!

My guests thought this was weird and generally left it on their plates, but I personally thought it was great.  I think too much vinegar may put some people off.  But really, it is a new and exciting twist on the old cranberry treatment.  Wow.

This is really good.  I too reduced the vinegar to 2 tbsp.  I also added zest of 1 navel orange and the juice.  Excellent!

Flavorful, attractive alternative to the canned "cranberry log" my grandmother used to serve.  Reduce vinegar, though... much too tart!

Thisis a great recipe. I've been halfway looking for a chutney recipe to use in place of one I've had for a few years that just makes far too much chutney. This is perfect...about 3 cups. For those of you concerned about the vinegar taste, let me recommend making it a month before you plan on using it, put it in a storage container and freezing it. This mellows the chutney considerably and really can help improve the flavor.

After reading reviews I only added a tablespoon of the cider vinegar and added another 1/4 cup sugar.  It was so delicious! We had this over roasted pheasant.  Two out of the four guests asked for recipe! I would make this a staple for any special poultry dish.

I found this recipe years ago and am pretty positive that I will NEVER make cranberries any other way. I follow the recipe exactly as written except I omit the raisins. I've always gotten lots of compliments.

Everyone absolutely RAVED about this!  It was so flavorful and the apple-cider vinegar gave it a nice twist (but I only used 1/3 cup).  I loved that it wasn't just cranberries, the other fruits gave nice textures and the apples balanced out the tartness of the cranberries.  I used whole cranberry sauce instead of fresh cranberries and it turned out fine, I just had to boil it down longer because of the extra fluid.  Will definately be making this for future Thanksgivings!

I made this as written but used apple cider instead of water.  I added walnuts as suggested by another reviewer and a pinch of cayenne.  I wasn't thrilled with the result that day, or even a few days later but a week or so later I ate this with brie and crackers and it mellowed out and blended wonderfully!  I canned this using 8 oz jelly jars and a boiling water bath with a processing time of 10 minutes (per the Ball canning recommendations for a similar cranberry chutney recipe).  The chopped apple loses some of its texture after canning but the recipe as a whole remains wonderful.

I did not care for this recipe. It had a very high vinegar after taste. I know my way around the kitchen and this was just not good at all. I wasted my time and ingredients. :(

2/08 Update-Ive been making this for the last 5 years now.  Its become a new family tradition.  I really enjoyed making a homemade cranberry sauce from fresh cranberries.  Everyone at dinner loved it.  I highly recommend this sauce.

I thought it was good, but it had a strong taste of vinegar. It was a hit or miss with my family, a bit strong for some of them.

Very good! I used half white sugar, half brown sugar, and cut the vinegar in half.

Delicious combination of flavors! I didn't have fresh berries, so was looking for a recipe that used canned whole berry "sauce".  I decided to try it with this one, and it worked beautifully. i used one can in place of water, sugar and berries. kept the rest the same. cooks up faster (since the berries are done) and tasted fantastic.  everyone loved it! thanks!

This really came out wonderful except that the cider vinegar was very overwelming in the flavour.  Next time I would omit it or at least reduce the amount of cider vinegar.  It made it tast weird.

I cut down the vinegar to 2 tbsp as suggested, but it was still way to vinegary...I think next time I'll either omit the vinegar completely or add just a splash. My mother liked this stuff, but I couldn't stomach it.

The best cranberry sauce/chutney ever. I omitted the raisins (don't care for raisins) and it was a hit. Great served either cold or hot with turkey and even chicken. Super easy to put together and more flavorful than store bought.

If you are looking for something other than the standard cranberry sauce, try this recipe.  This is the best cranberry chutney I have had, sweet and tangy, it is a great change and I will definately make it again.

This is a wonderfully fragrant and tangy chutney.  It is especially good on a grilled turkey panini.  I reduced the sugar  by 1/4 cup, added about a tablespoon of honey and a few extra raisins which made it plenty sweet enough.

I made this in addition to the Blue Cranberry Sauce (also on this site) for Thanksgiving this year.  It was really good.  As per other reviewers I reduced the amount of vinegar to 2 Tbsp. (plenty).  I also chose to omit the raisins and instead added 1/4 c. diced dried apricots.  Just before serving I mixed in some chopped walnuts.  It was wonderful!

Cracking recipe, I made 2 litres of it, put it in old French style preserve jars and gave it as Christmas gifts to neighbours, work friends and my in-laws. At Christmas dinner everyone loved it, and finished the whole pot! Thouroughly recommend it, I made it to the exact recipe with good organic cider vinegar, was tangy and sweet, lovely!

Very good cranberry chutney. I followed other reviewers suggestions and cut the vinegar back to 2T. Glad I did, because I really don't think my family would have liked it with the whole 1/2c. of vinegar in it. Also used golden raisins. Very nice color, flavor and texture.

Major disappointment.  Not sweet enough for me, and I usually don't like things that sweet.  The cider vinegar didn't help either, my husband hated the smell.  I think substituting for that would be a good idea.  I double checked make sure I did it right since all the reviews were so great and I did.  It was just a weird flavor.  I will not make again.

Nothing all that special, a little disappointing considering all the rave reviews. Not sweet enough for me -- I used Granny Smith apples which are tart, so that probably didn't help. Cut back to 2T balsamic, as recommended in some reviews, didn't taste vinegar-y at all. I had to put in a couple Tablespoons of brown sugar to sweeten it up, then it was pretty good.

I made this for Thanksgiving 2002, and really enjoyed it. Beats the jiggly canned stuff any day! Only things I changed were to use 2 T. balsamic vinegar instead of the cider vinegar, and craisins instead of the raisins. I also added a bit of orange zest, but that was because I happened to have some on hand. It would be just as good w/o it. Thanks! :o)

I substituted dried apricots for the raisins, and added a little red pepper for a *kick*.  For the dreaded leftover turkey sandwiches that follow the holidays...  the chutney is great on a baguette with turkey, swiss, and herbed cream cheese.

The anti-vinegar people here are missing the point.  This is cranberry chutney, not Ocean Spray canned cranberry jelly.  There are most likely other recipes here like the way I make it, but, here I go:

Saute 1/2 cup of onion for a while, throw in some garlic when the onion is soft, then proceed with the recipe.  You can do without the apples and raisins as far as I'm concerned.  I used 3/4 c. packed brown sugar and rice wine vinegar. I like adding orange jest. I just used 1 tsp. of ground ginger, instead of all the other spices.  Grated fresh ginger would be very good.  In fact, if you want it really orange-y, replace the water with orange juice.

This was ok. Thought it called for too much vinager. If I make it again I will use a lot less.

Love this.  I left out most the vinegar.  I found the first time I made it the vinegar was a little too bitter.  The second time I made it I only put in a drop of vinegar, and it was much better.

Really like the blend of flavors. We did cut back on the cider vinegar to 1/8c. My husband wants to cut the cranberries & raisins some before cooking next time.

Excellent!  I made this for Thanksgiving and even my picky sister loved it.  I have also served it over Brie cheese with crackers for a quick appetizer. I just made up a double batch and will freeze some for future use.

We searched the stores for chutney for a Christmas party to no avail.  I finally looked here and got this great recipe!  It is very easy to make.  We served it with a block of cream cheese and Wheat Thins crackers.  What an amazing taste combination!  I'm glad I saved some at home because I've been enjoying some delicious snacks!

Used balsamic instead of cider vinegar. DH and I really like, but I thought our Thanksgiving guests would miss the jellied version (the one shaped like the can). I was pleasantly surprised when everyone else liked it too, so five stars!

A new Thanksgiving favorite. It made a lot for us. It made it through two Thanksgiving dinners and I mixed leftovers with cream cheese to make a yummy cracker dip. Everyone who likes cranberries loved it.

Even the non-craberry eaters at my table enjoyed this dish.  Next time I make it, I would increase the sugar a small amount and decrease the vinegar. The vinegar seemed a bit overpowering to me.

I made this with just 2 Tbsp of vinegar and it was still wayyyy too strong.  I think I will try it again without the vinegar and maybe a little more sugar.  My mother-in-law really liked it though.

My daughter and I made this for Thanksgiving, and it was a big hit!  I made a few adjustments though, I decreased the vinegar to 2 tablespoons, substituted Splenda for the sugar and used 3 apples instead of 2 (it made it thicker).  Another great recipe!

I love this recipe.  I make it every year for my mom's birthday gift and it always goes over well.  Outside of how tasty it is, I also love how easy this is to make; unlike a lot of chutney recipes there is very little chopping to do!

I've used this recipe for a couple of years now with great success. I've passed this recipe to family and friends we all have stopped buying cranberry sauce in the can!

The only change I make is to reduce the vinegar to a couple of tablespoons.  I've used both apples and/or pears with great results.

This has got some character.  It is not the sickly sweet normal thanksgiving side.  It is complex in flavor and compliments the turkey well.  Great with steak as well.  We also used the leftovers for brie and crackers for a wine filled night.

This was a great recipe!  I received so many compliments at Thanksgiving.  It is not exactly your "typical" cranberry sauce-- but with more complex flavors and textures, it is better!  I did put less cider vinegar (about 3+ Tbl) and felt that even this amount was too much (I added more sugar to try and compensate.)  Next time I will try just 2 Tbl. as many reviewers suggest.  Also, I needed to simmer it for more than 10 min. to get the texture I was looking for (maybe more like 15-20 min.)

Made this for our church Thanksgiving Dinner.  It got rave reviews.  On average each person ate one-and-a-half portions (it was that good)!

I added a little more sugar (to taste), bec. I knew the people who'd be eating it like sweeter than tart.

I usually dislike the flavour of cranberries, but I love this recipe! That works out quite well, because I didn't feel right about making Thanksgiving dinner without cranberry sauce. It not only tastes great but also smells delicious when it's cooking.

This recipe was wonderful with Thanksgiving dinner. I did make some changes that made it even better. I reduced the ving. to 2 tblsp. and added 1/2 cup of light brown sugar. It turned out so good that everyone wanted to take some home, I had to triple the recipe so I had enough to give my relatives with the Thanksgiving left overs. I will be making this a lot!

This gets better daily.  I'll never serve plain cranberry again.

This was so good at Thanksgiving, that I made it again for Christmas.  Served warmed up leftovers of the chutney over vanilla ice cream.  YUM!  My four kids (ages 9,10,13 & 15) loved it on ice cream and liked it as a side dish.

This recipe is amazing! It was the highlight of my Thanksgiving plate!  Highly recommended -- but I also reduced the vinegar and thought it superb!

My first foray into chutney... I made this the day of, and it was awful, super vinegar flavor and pretty bitter. The second day however! WOW! My husband says he prefers this to gravy on turkey, and he LOVES gravy (he even puts it on his stuffing). It was gone before the rest of the left overs, so it was a pretty great hit! :)

YUM! Loved this so much am making it just for me! I disagree with those who said to cut back on the vinegar. Balsamic vinegar makes this chutney come alive. Don't be afraid! I've also thrown in chopped dried apricots or toasted pecans when raisins weren't on hand. 
For an INCREDIBLE taste sensation, try on Fage greek yogurt....beyond heaven.

Tastes like potpourri. I don't think the vinegar is necessary since the cranberries are already tart and the spices are overpowering. Maybe some cream cheese will mellow it out a little.

This was awesome. The reason I looked this up is I had a sandwich at a local deli that had this as a spread with smoked turkey, havarati cheese, and cream cheese on a great thick wheat bread. Delicious! Thanks for sharing so I can make my sandwich @ home now !!! :)

I made this instead of the "cranberry sauce in the shape of a can" that my family has every year. At first it was hard to get people to try it cause it was different. But once they did, they were hooked! I had NO leftovers and every one was asking for the recipe!! GREAT RECIPE!!!

I believe this would have been a good recipe if not for the cider vinegar. I only about 1/4 cup but I think any at all will ruin an otherwise good recipe.

It sounded better than it tasted. It's actually quite good with turkey but perhaps a bit too tart. I would definitely cut back on the vinegar. Cranberries are quite tart all on their own. Using balsamic vinegar (about 2-3 tbsp) might be a reasonable substitute.

My mother absolutely loved this recipe for tea time, and and I thought that it went great with the turkey meat. As suggested, I only put in a few drops of the cider vinegar. Since I have a Russian family that's used to the most basic "butter and salt" flavors copied from the French, the cinnamon & cloves were not to everyone's liking.

We halved the vinegar as suggested and used diced dried apricots instead of raisins.  While very tangy, I wouldn't change another thing!  I will make it again for sure.

I've used this recipe for years(found it in an AARP magazine) and it's a hit every year.  Always requested for the holidays whether I'm cooking or going someplace.  It's a tradition for me and now for my daughter.

Fantastic recipe. This has become a Thanksgiving and Christmas tradition for three years now. Makes a great take-home gift for guests if you make it ahead of time and can it. 

I made two changes to this recipe - I substituted pure maple syrup for the sugar to add more depth and I added a Bosc pear as well as the apples (I omit the raisins. Texture is better without them).

This was sooo awesome! I will make sure I always have this on hand for toast, meat, sandwiches, etc! I didn't have any fresh cranberries on hand so I used canned whole cranberry sauce, cut back on the water and sugar! I also took the advice from another review to gently smash after it had simmered. Love it! Get the point! :)

Good. Received compliments. I also reduced the vinegar to 2 tbsp and split the sugars by adding half white and half brown. I also added (1) grated orange rind. 

Still seemed a tad tart to me, but then I'm not really a fan of cranberries.

Made this for Thanksgiving.  It was actually quite good.  I cut back on the vinegar, as recommended by several others.  Am so glad I did - even with the cut back, it still had a slight vinegar taste.  Others also suggested 1/4 cup brown sugar.  I would not add that much as it was quite sweet.  A little less vinegar and brown sugar would make it perfect!  Regardless, it was very yummy!  Even those who don't like the canned cranberry sauce really liked this. Thanks!  Will definately make it again.

I gave this recipe 5 starts because everyone else at the table like it.  I used golden raisins instead of the traditional ones.  I enjoyed it very much, however, next time, I will incorporate celery, onions, and vinegar.

We had a table of seven for Xmas dinner and I substituted this for the regular/plain cranberry sauce.  Everyone loved it so much that there wasn't any left over.  This will be a holiday tradition in our home for years to come.

Excellent departure from the usual canned cranberry sauce.  This is now my family's favorite for the holidays.  The sauce was perfect--thick enough to add to left-over turkey/cream cheese and cranberry sandwiches the next day!  I added lemon juice and zest to the recipe which adds a citrusy zing to the already spicy blend.  Hope you enjoy this recipe as much as I have--Christine L., thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe.

Not bad.  Very sweet and I'll probably give this a go in lieu of cranberry this holiday season.  I'm not a fan of cranberry sauce but my lady is and she loved this so....there you are.  :o)

I made this dish for Christmas dinner, and it was easy and delicious.  I omitted the raisins but followed the rest of the recipe to the letter.  It smelled so wonderful!!  And then I used the leftover chutney to glaze my pork on New Year's Day.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Da Bomb! I made this stuff last night for a TG party I'm going to today. I ate most of it morning! I had it on toast as well as big spoons of it. I have to make more (with less vinegar). :)

I absolutely love it. The aroma is wonderful. It has a tangy, sweet and tart taste. If you're not crazy about tart things then reduce reducing the amount of vinegar should work. It adds color and texture to the meal. It would be really good served warm with vanilla ice cream too.

Very good, and it was fun to watch the cranberries pop!  I reduced the apple cider to 2 Tbl., as suggested (good suggestion!!).  Also, I didn't think there were enough apples, so I doubled them.  Perfect!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is SO GOOD with turkey filet mignon.  I couldn't find fresh cranberries, so I used canned whole cranberries and omitted the extra sugar.  Probably not as good as with fresh, but still really tasty!

I liked this recipe well enough, but my family did not. I added walnuts, but my son did not appreciate the crunchiness of those.  I only added 1/4 cup vinegar but still found that taste overwhelmed the chutney.

I made this last night, could not find fresh cranberries this time of year so i used dried ones. Still came out amazing!!! I made some blackened brie and garlic ciabatta crustinis with it. SO DELICIOUS!!!! I recommend using a large granny smith apple. The spices came together great.

This recipe is quite delicious.  I made this last holiday season and it was a hit with myself and the wife.  However, it was very spicy when originally made.  It had a lot of bite once it was reduced.  I sqouze some orange juice to balance the spicyness to our taste.  I also used golden raisins as I prefered them.

Loved it.  I didn't have any apple cider vinegar, so I added apple juice instead.  I also added cinnamon sticks in addition to the ground cinnamon.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was absolutely delicious! A little more spicy than the average cranberry fare, but also far better than the average cranberry fare!

I love cranberry chutney.  It's not winter without it.  I cut the sugar in half and add fresh squeezed OJ instead of water.  I also add in some orange zest.  Superb!

I love this recipe. The only change I made is that when I tasted it it seemed a bit too tart still so I added 2 additional tsp of sugar. Perfect. And it just tastes better with age. Yum. Thank you!!

Everything in the ingredient list was good EXCEPT for the 1/2 cup of vinegar....YUCK!!  It reminded me of doing vinegar shots for weight loss!! When I make this again I will only use 1 T of apple cider vinegar. Additionally I used an immersion blender briefly  to create a smoother consistency.

I made this on a lark because my husband brought home a package of cranberries. We never eat cranberry sauces. Until this year, and from now on we'll make this one. I left out the raisins because the mention of raisins makes my poor husband shake, and just used a bit more apple. EVERYONE loved it.

I wanted to make something different in addition to traditional cranberry sauce for the Thanksgiving meal; and this is DELICIOUS!  I didn't alter a thing.  Traditional chutneys do have more vinegar, so I think this is a perfect blend of spice and vinegar.  It smelled WONDERFUL while I was preparing it.

Great recipe!!!

I made a couple changes.  As others had said there was a pronounced vinegar taste, I only added 1 1/2 T.  I added slightly less apples and raisins, and added  the zest of one orange plus a couple T of freshly squeezed orange juice.  After it simmered a little while, I mashed some of the chutney so it would have a more saucy texture, but left chunks in as well.

I really feel there is way too much apple cider vinegar in this recipe  I made it exactly as described.  The apple cider vinegar is very pronounced.  I don't mean sour, I mean that feeling, burning sensation one gets at the back of their throat when tasting vinegar.  I added  1/4 sugar more to try and cut the acidity.  It's better but that back of the throat feeling is still there.

Based on other reviews, I reduced the cider vinegar to 1/4 cup. I also substituted orange juice for the water and added the zest from one orange. It was delicious. I plan to can another batch to use as Christmas gifts.

I made this twice, using Granny Smith apples and golden raisins. The first time I made the dish, I followed the recipe as written and loved it. The second time, I reduced it 10 minutes more to acquire a thicker texture and loved it even more. 

The flavors blend well and it tastes good on turkey, chicken, fish, and pork. I personally liked the amount of vinegar and did not reduce it. The flavor helps make this dish a true chutney.

Very nice  flavor. I added orange zest as someone else suggested, and that made it. Don't understand the complaint about the vinegar--I used Braggs apple cider vinegar and it did not have a strong vinegar taste. I did add just a bit more cinnamon and ginger for a stronger flavor.

I made this just as written the first time except for decreasing the apple cider vinegar to 2tablespoons. The next time around I substituted crushed pineapple for the apples and raisins. I like to cook it longer so it is thicker.  The spices are right on target without over powering things. The crushed pineapple is easier to use than cutting up apples and had a similar flavor.

I make this every Thanksgiving. I put in slightly less apple cider vinegar.  It's great with Turkey, chicken or on cinnamon toast. Yummy!! -Paula Akbari

This has become a family fav.
I use less sugar, turns out fabulous every time.  Love the fact that you can make it a day or two ahead - which makes things much easier when you're having guests or making lots of other things - and it actually turns out better as the flavours have a chance to meld.  Just make sure you take it out of the fridge with enough time to bring it back up to room temp.
I might jar this and give as gifts.

Great recipe.  I did though make a couple of modifications.  Based on other reviews I reduced the cider vinegar to 1/4 cup (2 tablespoons would have been too little).  I also used pumpkin pie spice instead of ground cloves.  And I added 1/4 cup of diced raw walnuts.  The flavor is killer.  I've never made chutney before and I will never buy it again!  Next time I will try it with the full amount of vinegar.

My guests were a little apprehensive but once they tried it, they loved it.  I used orange juice instead of water, omitted the vinegar and added a splash of balsamic instead, mandarin oranges and toasted pecans.

This recipe is a tradition at my home for Thanksgiving and beyond.  It's a perfect blend of fragrant and pungent, with a hint of sweet.  I took it to my office party and have emailed it since then to most of my coworkers.  It was a huge hit.

I follow the recipe as stated and love it. My 2 year old loves it and my 13 and 14 year old brother and sister also loved it. Made several times and always freeze the leftovers for another quick side to roasted meat. I almost always pair it up with the chipotle crusted pork tenderloin also from allrecipes. Awesome side!

As suggested by many reviewers, I made this chutney (with less vinegar) to go over a turkey tenderloin.  My gravy loving husband absolutely thought the chutney was delicious.  We have turkey often and I will be making this just as often!

I made this recipe twice within a couple of weeks after trying it the first time. I did like some other reviewers said and reduced the vinegar to 2 Tbsp and it was perfect. I served this with a charcuterie board one of the times and it was really well received! It's just the right amount of sweet and sour with a little kick from the spices. Yum!

This was ok but I really didn't care for the flavor profile. I like cinnamon, ginger, allspice and clove but in this dish they overpowered the cranberry and the turkey. I wish I had just made my tried and true cranberry-orange relish.

It is quite good. Although I agree, less cider vinegar would be better maybe cut the amount in half.

I made the recipe as written for ingredients but I cooked it for a lot longer than the 10 minutes it said so it would be thicker.  Maybe it thickens on its own during the cooling process but I really liked the way it turned out.

This is a great recipe.  I used blood orange juice instead of water, added walnuts, used less sugar, and let it sit for a while after cooking for 20 minutes instead of ten. Ate the entire recipe, too. Be sure to add the apple cider vinegar.  It may seem counter-intuitive, but it makes the dish.

I split the difference between some of the reviewers' comments and the actual recipe and used 3T vinegar. Otherwise I made it exactly as per the recipe. It was great.  It is wonderful as a side with the whole Thanksgiving meal, or on a sandwich with just turkey.  I used a granny smith apple.  Since it didn't say what kind of raisins, I had black ones and that worked fine.  Thank you for posting it.

This delicious chutney is for my family the aroma of thanksgiving! I make the night before and though I love as is... over the many years of making, learned most of my guests prefer with less vinegar. Some years I make another batch to spread on leftover turkey sandwiches. The best!!!

This is the first time Ive ever made chutney.. it was sooo easy! I was looking for a chutney recipe to use with our brie at our family xmas dinner.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion of cutting back on the cidar vinegar to 1/4 cup and adding 2 tbsp brown sugar.  With a little chopped almonds on top..and heated up.. its to die for!!! Thanks for such a great and easy recipe.

I have made this several times now as it is the recipe people ask me to bring to Thanksgiving and Christmas - which is great because it is a snap to make!  It always creates a stir though...just something more interesting than your "canned" cranberry sauce.

This is very good.  I was a little worried about it, with the vinegar and cranberries I thought it might be too tart.  But I liked it a lot.

I personally did not like the flavor of the spices with the cranberries, apples and raisins.  I think I would have actually like the mixture without the cinnamon, ginger, allspice and cloves.  Sorry.

I personally did not like the flavor of the spices with the cranberries, apples and raisins.  I think I would have actually like the mixture without the cinnamon, ginger, allspice and cloves.  Sorry.

Even though I have a lot of experience in the kitchen, I've always been too scared to make cranberry sauce.  This recipe was great.  I think I'll increase the sugar a bit next time.  Thanks for sharing.
