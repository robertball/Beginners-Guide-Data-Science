Wonderful! I made this recipe using Splenda and whole wheat flour and the result was sweet, moist cornbread muffins. My husband (who considers himself a connoisseur of cornbread) loves them, too.

These muffins had a great texture, and flavor.  They were however too sweet for us, so if you don't like them overly sweet, I would reduce the sugar to 1/3.

This was my second attempt at making cornbread, and it turned out great.  I wanted to make something that had actual corn kernels in it, because the last one i made didn't and was pretty bitter, but this one turned out great even though i ran out of white sugar and had to substitute around a 1/4 cup of brown sugar, and also just used canned sweet kernel corn...

i would def. recommend this recipe to anyone wanting to make GOOD cornbread (i just made it in a casserole dish).

This provided some of the best cornbread I have had...used less sugar and a bit more honey as suggested by others and I tossed in a finely chopped fat jalapeno pepper with the corn.  Was able to freeze some for future meals and I can't be happier about it.  Thanks Krissy!

These were really tasty!  I thought I'd mess them up since I used a whole can of corn drained, and added a little extra milk and an extra shake of baking powder, but they were perfect!  Also I baked them at 350' for 25 minutes and they were just right (I didn't want them to burn at 400).  I loved the flavor and the extra corn was great. The honey flavor is subtle but noticible and tastes wonderful. Thanks!

These were very good! We loved that the corn kernels broke up the muffin with pockets of moisture. Even my boyfriend, who doesn't like corn at ALL, had a second one. I didn't have frozen corn, but I did have no salt added canned corn, and it worked wonderfully. :)

I used splenda instead of sugar and because of that i had to use twice as much baking powder and cut down 6 minutes of baking time (splenda makes muffins kinde flat grrr). I also used evaporated milk instead of normal milk.  it turned out AMAZING!!! I'm definitely serving this at a party. Honey-licious!

I loved this recipe. I read from alot of people that it is to sweet and I did not think that at all. It is perfect the way it is and have made many times over again.

This a great alternative to cornbread because it could be a side or a main dish, say for breakfast. I made a few revisions: cut the sugar to a rounded 1/3 cup, and instead of 1 1/2 cups of flour, I used one cup of bread flour and 1/2 corn of corn starch, a little trick for making it lighter and a little fluffier. One other change was I increased the baking powder to 3/4 tsp., wanted to make sure thy were fluffy enough. If you love the taste of honey, then you are sure to like these. Yum!

This is fairly good-they are harder and crunchier than cake like you get at some restaurants--I agree that the corn flavor isn't as pronounced but still a good side for soup or chowder.

Very good muffins. To cut down on the butter, I used 1/4 cup instead of 1/2 and added just a little bit more milk. I also cut back on the sugar to 1/2 cup and they were not too sweet. After making the muffins, I reread the recipe and realized I forgot the baking powder but I didn't notice a difference. I also omitted the corn.

Absolutely delicious. You can fill the cupcake/muffin tins to the top and it will give you a nice cone without getting messy. This will be the only cornbread recipe I use from now on.

this is a corn muffin that's not too sweet, but still very yummy. i've tried some other recipes before.. and those were rather.. disastrous. however, this recipe was not dry in the least and the consistency wasn't too moist or too dry-- just right! everyone loves these muffins, even my grandparents!

i followed most of the recommendations by the other reviewers... they are always so helpful! i also stir my cornmeal as i soak it in the milk, to try and help it absorb more liquids.

Very good!  I used Splenda to cut down on calories, made them in mini-muffin pan w/liners (yield was two dozen + 9), and had to throw in a few tablespoons of corn syrup because I only had two tablespoons of honey.  Also, I used canned corn instead of frozen.  The only reason I'm not giving this recipe 5 stars is that I wish they looked more like traditional corn bread in color; they're very white.  Still, my taste test right out of the oven give them two thumbs up.

The sugars burned and tasted funny.  Was also very crumbly.  Only cooked for 20 minutes so maybe only 15 minutes.

These were great corn muffins even though I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I cut the amount of sugar and honey in half. I didn't want them to be so sweet. Used a combination 1/2 whole wheat flour and white flour and omitted the corn.  I will never buy a box of muffin mix again.

Very tasty and keeps well for a few days.  Maybe a bit too sweet for my taste, will probably cut back on the sugar a bit next time.  Would make again.

These really are the BEST EVER muffins.  I've been looking for a recipe clone for the 'famous bbq' place and these fit the bill!  I had to substitute canned corn for the frozen and they still came out perfect. The only thing I might change is to cut back on the sugar.  They are just a bit too sweet for my family's liking.

This recipe was a big hit. The honey and corn kernels set it apart from standard corn bread. I also substituted wheat flour and made honey butter to put on top. It turned out very well. Just be sure to make it the day of, because if it sits too long the corn kernels harden and get chewy.

These corn muffins turned out dense and sweet, perfect for cutting in half and smearing on butter. I increased the sugar to 1 cup and omitted the honey. Next time I make these I think I'll use the 2/3c. sugar and still omit the honey. I will also use a full cup of thawed corn.

I just baked 3 different corn muffin recipes from this website, and compared to the other 2 recipes and compared to my normal recipe, this recipe is a big disappointment. These muffins are way too sweet, and have an aftertaste like shortbread (because of the butter and sugar combination). They're not what cornbread should be (in my opinion), although they have a lot of flavor. They did have a good texture inside, and did rise nicely though.

This recipe turned out very well, with little work on my part.  Following suggestions from others, I did reduce the amount of sugar in the recipe (to 1/4c).  I also cut back slightly on the honey.  Used a whole cup of corn.  Last year I made corn muffins with yellow corn -- probably little difference, but they looked prettier than the white corn I had sitting around this year.

I multiplied this recipe by 1 1/2 and baked it in a 9x13".  It turned out very well!  The bread was moist and sweet; it did not have the crumbly, dry texture of so many other cornbread/muffin recipes.

We liked it a lot.  But I eliminated the sugar altogether, used half the honey (used wildflower), and used sweetened condensed milk instead of milk.  Next time I will not use any honey and take the advice on the jalipenos (sp?).

i'm not read to rate it just yet ... I made this recipe yesterday.  I used agave syrup instead of honey and whole wheat pastry flour instead of whole wheat.  I have substituted ww pastry flour in other baking recipes and had much success ... these were very dense and heavy.  My husband loved them though.  I want to try again before I give it an official rating.

I have been looking for a corn muffin recipe with this flavor and texture for a very, long time. These muffins are delicious. I made them with whole wheat pastry flour (as I do with all my day-to-day baking) and you couldn't tell at all.

However, they are a little bit on the sweet side, at least for adult palates.Although I doubt the kids will mind at all. Next time I make them, I will cut the granulated sugar in half. 

I have been holding a spot in my own recipe book for a good, simple, basic corn muffin recipe, and this will be the one.

If you like sweet heavy cornbread..this recipe is for you. 
I prefer mine less sweet to eat with stew or chili...so i'll use less sugar next time...and maybe less flour and more cornmeal.

Love these muffins. I am one of those that slightly altered the recipe. Slightly less sugar and honey. I like it sweet and this was still perfect. A little less flour and a little more cornmeal for the texture. I absolutely love the honey flavor!

I was not impressed with these at all.  They were very dry, not sweet enough, and the corn in the muffins was hard.  I don't think the recipe calls for enough cornmeal either because these did not taste like cornbread at all.  I don't know what I did wrong, but I will not make these again.

Wonderful!  I make them with canned corn instead of the frozen, and they are great! I add a touch of extra honey and a splash of extra milk to them and they are so moist!  They have been a hit every place that I've taken them.

This really is the best corn muffin recipe I've tried. My family loved it.  Although, next time, I'll try adding wet to dry (sifting the dry ingredients separately and added it to an egg-milk mixture).

Excellent.   Best corn muffin recipe I’ve baked.  Usually they are dry, but this recipe is moist and a bit on the sweet side. I followed the recipe and wouldn’t change anything.  I had leftover corn from last night, so used it.  Loved it

This  muffin is a little on the sweet side but it doesn't overshadow the wonderful corn flavor.

This truly was the best corn bread recipe I’ve ever made!  Like other reviewers, I cut the sugar in half and used brown sugar instead of white.  And I used buttermilk in place of milk.  The result was moist and tasty.  Thank you so much for sharing this simple and delicious recipe

I didn't follow your recipe one iota, but still want to rate it.  Just kidding.  I followed it to a "T" and it turned out great.  I, like other reviewers found it a bit too sweet and will adjust the sugar next time.  This will be my "go to" corn muffin recipe.

I made these for a brunch today but made them vegan!  Used coconut milk instead of milk, brown sugar instead of white,  flax eggs instead of eggs, Earth Balance instead of butter, and left out the corn kernels (because of a couple of people who don't like that),  They really were the "best ever!"

krissy oh krissy, this recipe just didn't butter my toast! en mi opinion, I truly believe that the bread was dryer than my DMS. tambien, your recipe called for "corn kernels"? the texture was just oh no by golly gee! overall,  I just feel as if we could make some ...,, adjustments-compromises if you will. its 2018 now, lots of time for improvement! thanks, xoxo, Jilly.

They were not to sweet, or to dense,  this recipe is really good! 
This recipe turned out even better than our favorite restaurants! I will play wth this recipe for future use by adding new and fun ingredients. I made these almost exactly as stated. I didn't have any butter,  I used margarine as I had it on hand, and they were still great. I also had no corn, but they were still great, I will add canned corn next tiime. They went with chili tonight. This recipe actually makes 12 muffins!  

I baked mine at 380 as I ddn't want my muffins to burn. My covection oven auto converts that temp to about 355. I poured them into the prepared muffin pan that was sprayed with a non stick spray and let sit 30 minutes to bake. I baked for them for 22 minutes. When done, they fell out of the pan with no sticking. This 30 extra minutes waiting to bake may have helped the corn mixture absorb the moisture as they turned out perfectly. They formed a nice crest with a golden color on top. Thanks....

This recipe is pretty good if you're looking for a sweet corn bread.  Great with a pat of butter. The kids love them but enjoy them better as mini muffins (meaning the really small bite sized ones). For mini muffins I reduced the temp to 350 and baked for 15 mins only.

These are awesome!  The corn was a bit chewy in a few of them so I might use canned corn next time.  I did cut the sugar down by about half.  Plenty sweet and best with lots of butter!

It was way too sweet and didn't like the honey aftertaste. I'll try it one more time with half the amount of sugar and omit honey and add 1cup of milk rather than 1/2 cup that it calls for. Still appreciate the post!

I've never made corn bread muffins from scratch and after reviewing the other comments, it's truly scrumptious! My husband loved how it didn't fall apart because it was very moist and not light in weight, very compact and all together nicely-if that makes sense ;)
I kept my batch of dozen in the oven for 20 minutes at 350 degrees instead and it came out lightly crispy along the edges and perfectly cooked thoroughly and golden brown on top. We don't drink milk but instead of 1/2 cup of milk, I used 1/4 cup of almond milk with 1/4 cup of heavy whipping cream which made it taste creamy and great! I didn't have kernels to thaw so I used most of the can of corn, draining out the liquid of course, and added it to the mix-tasted great. Adding 3/4 of a tsp. Instead of 1/2 a tsp turned out a hint more salty since the amount of honey and sugar does make it on the sweet side a bit. I'll use a full tsp. Next time which I think will add a little more of a salty flavor to it :)
 Husband loved it and we'll be making more of it :))

OMG!!! These were the best corn muffins ever!!  I have been looking for a corn muffin made with corn kernels for a long time.  I used to get one in the morning before work and loved it!!  Finally!  The only thing I did different, and it was an accident, was I used 1/2 cup sugar instead of 1/3 and it was delicious.  I think I'm going to keep doing that!  Great recipe.  Moist and delicious!! Will be making these again, and again!

I did not add the actual pieces of corn in them, but my family loved them anyway! I also baked at 350 for 25-30 minutes until they bounced back when I touched the tops. This way they did not get as brown as the original picture. Delicious!

tried this recipe today and loved it.  Made it exactly as stated.  Found them to be a little sweet, but for a breakfast or brunch that would be ok.  I used clover honey, and that flavor came through loud and clear.  I especially love the crunch of corn kernels.  These are really good fresh out of the oven with a pat of butter on them...

These corn muffins are really good! The baking time was way too long on the original recipe for my oven. I cooked them for about 17 minutes and they were a little overdone. Also, they are very sweet so if you are looking for a corn muffin that tastes like dessert, this is it!

Followed the recipe exactly, only I used canned (drained) corn instead of frozen.  These were a HUGE hit in our family. I love that slight honey taste (as we always put honey on our corn bread anyway, this way it is baked right in). Definitely a bit sweet, but we like it like that.

I made these muffins for breakfast, I added an extra egg because I thought my eggs were too small, resulting in a dense muffin. I added 1/4 of ricotta cheese because I had no corn available and I added (eyeballed) 2oz of olive oil to make up for the butter I need (I only had 6oz). If I made them again (I certainly will) I'd use the 2 eggs called in the recipe, but I'll still use the olive oil and the cottage cheese.

I was nervouse because the dough tasted like a corn cookie shortcake but I made tiny loaves & really like it. I did double the baking powder. I wanted them to rise. I might add more corn next time. The sweetness is just right for my taste. I used to pick up an ocasional cornbread at Boston Market. This is different than theirs but tastes great too! Thanks!

I was not dissapointed in the result however way too sweet for me so I will reduce the sugar next time to 1/3 cup. I also increased the baking powder to 1 tsp. because I had to melt my sugary honey and was concerned that I had activated the leavening prematurely.  I made them in my extra-deep muffin tin (generous amount of batter)and they puffed up beautifully. I really like high fluffy muffins.  The honey positively perked up the flavour.  Will definitely make again and again.  Thanks Krissy!

These turned out amazing! My boyfriend and I loved them! I was a bit wary at first because my experiences with corn muffins have a been dry and pasty. But the texture of these were just right! The recipe reminded me of those awesome muffins I used to enjoy from Church's Chicken just not as sweet.

I do not like corn muffins but these were spectacular.  My husband ate four or five at once.

I used a bit more milk and cornbread and a lot less sugar, honey, and flour. I also melted pepperjack cheese over the top after they came out. That tasted great! Watch the cook time too. I only put them in for 15-17 min. They were very moist and at our church cornbread/chili cookoff they were a big hit.

These were pretty good. They were a little to sweet for us but they still were devoured by the kids. I would cut the sugar to 1/2 cup next time.

Excellent recipe.  I used polenta in place of the cornmeal, only because I had some to use up.  They were wonderful!

I tried this cornbread recipe for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. I think what gives it a really good flavor is the honey in the recipe.  The reason I give it four stars intstead of five is because I wish they were a little healthier.  But maybe that's why they taste so good!

These muffins were too heavy. I am questioning the use of only 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda. Is that a typo? 
I may try them again with more baking soda and see if that helps.

A nice spin on cornbread, perhaps a tad too sweet for our tastes, but delicious nevertheless. This cornbread is dense and moist and sweet.  The honey flavor shone through.  I put the batter in an 8x8 pan and baked for an additional 10 minutes (had to use tinfoil for the last 10 minutes to prevent overbrowning).  Thank you for the submission.

Great muffins. I don't like corn muffins to be too sweet so I cut the sugar in half. I also added a 4oz can of mild chopped jalapenos. I will make this again.
