Used frozen diced onions as a timesaver and sauteed them in with the Italian sausage. Added a little bit of minced garlic and used roasted red pepper instead of green pepper. Finally, used a little bit of hot sauce instead of cayenne. Served over penne topped with Parmesan.

I love how simple this is, and I love using my slow cooker. I omitted the cayenne, because I thought the sausage would add enough spice, but afterwards wished I'd added it. My husband liked this sauce, too. I served it over penne pasta with homemade garlic bread and a salad.

Delicious! This spagetti sauce had just the right amount of spicy kick and flavor. I used hot Italian sausage and removed the casings before cooking and added fresh basil from the garden. It was great and even better after a couple of days for leftovers! I will definitly make this again, my husband loved it!

This definitely is good but has room for improvement. Minced onions would be a start.

Simple and tasty.
I skipped the green pepper, since I didn't have one. Boiled the sausage before browning, less oil later and more flavor in the slow cooker. I also cut up the sausage before putting it in the slow cooker, after browning it.

I also added about a 1/2 cup or so of water since I've had other  spaghetti sauce recipes burn in the past. I'm sure this is due to the size of the pot versus how much food.
