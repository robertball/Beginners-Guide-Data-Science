Very Good! I was skeptical about the Cinnamon and actually only put a dab then added the whole 1/2 tsp. I will make this again.

This was pretty good but hubby didn't care for the cinnamon. I did dust the fish with flour before dipping it in the batter just to make sure the batter stuck to the fish.

Great recipe and worked fantastic on the pan fish my husband brings home from ice fishing. I did omit the cinnamon though and added some lemon juice instead. Terrific batter, everyone loved it!

This was insanely delicious! My children gobbled it up and didn't leave a single crumb. As did I. I used regular beer that I had on hand and fried it in my frying pan with lots of oil, didnt completely deep fry, but it was super duper crispy. I also only used 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, will try it with the full amount next time. I used tilapia fillets, but I'm sure this can be done with any white fish fillets you have around. This will be on regular circulation in my house!

this is almost like the batter at our favorite restaurant.  Used it for our home grown zucchini strips too. YUM

This is how I will be frying fish from now on.  Love the taste, cinnamon worked and did not make it sweet by any means.  The cinnamon gives a wider range of flavor.

Loved it. Anything that has Newcastle Brown as an ingredient is worth cooking... Thanks for a wonderful tea.

I also was apprehensive about the cinnamon, but it really made the fish more hearty. Substitute the Newcastle for Mother's Three Blind Mice and you will be astounded.

Like other reviewers, I was a little reticent about adding the cinnamon. However, it turned out great! Definitely a keeper.

Great fish batter recipe and a good reason to buy a 6-pack of Newcastle brown ale. Followed the recipe to the letter and my wife and I loved the finished product. We'll definitely try it again.
