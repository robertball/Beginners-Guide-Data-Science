I'm assuming the 80 servings is supposed to read 8. That being said, I halved the recipe with 4 servings in mind. I really liked this but wanted to mention a couple of things. One egg per pound of shrimp is plenty so save yourself some eggs. Step 7 says to test your shrimp but doesn't state how to do that. Eating under cooked shrimp would not be a good idea however  5 minutes in hot enough oil is plenty and there is no need for testing. Lastly, I found that the breading set on the shrimp just fine and didn't really need the 30 minutes refrigerating time. The end results was great but  I think you can save yourself some time and money with the things I suggested.

These are really good!  I only had a handful of shrimp, so I made 1/4 the batter recipe.  I made a few changes to the sauce recipe.  I left out the corn syrup and used only two tablespoons of butter to 1/2 cup of Frank's.  Also, I baked the shrimp instead of frying.  Will make again!
