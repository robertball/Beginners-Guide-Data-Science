The main reason I gave this recipe a lower score, is because  two out of four family member did not like this dish. 

Also I like a casserole that you assemble, put in the oven and forget about it until it's done. This had too many steps for a casserole.

Oh man!  We loved this dinner tonight!  I did scale it back for us in quantity, using one breast from a Costco boneless skinless chicken breast and two red potatoes.  Otherwise I did follow the recipe except for the high temperatures called for.  I roasted the potatoes at 450 rather than 500, and when I added the chicken I cut it back to 350.  This was delicious and filling and I will look forward to eating it again soon.  Thank you so much, krisgo!

2 out of my family members didn't like it and the other 2 weren't crazy about it. Way too many steps for a casserole.

1 9 18 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/256367/buffalo-chicken-and-potato-casserole/ ... Four stars from E; K didn't care for; S liked; me, eh.  I combined 1/4c ranch, 2T homemade wing sauce, 1t each of garlic powder, onion powder, salt & tossed the potato cubes in it.  In the bowl, there was very little left so I combined 1/4c ranch, 2T homemade wing sauce & 1/2t each of same spices.  It wasn't until I had the potatoes in the oven that I realized I forgot the oil so I added it to the second batch of sauce.  It wasn't necessary & diluted the flavor.  After everyone  :D   was cooked, I added another 3T wing sauce & topped with 2T bacon.  Better - could actually tell it was buffalo.  I think with a couple Ts oil in the dish, that's all needed; none in the sauce.  No cheese.  I wasn't feelin' cheese with buffalo.  Sum up:   'Not a casserole;  more of a "bake."   I don't see making this again unless E requests it.  Glad I made though... Update:  Said "guys" finished it the next day.  It seems I will be making it again - when I have leftover wing sauce.  'May make just tatoes for potato-lovin' girls.

Far too much salt.  Not sure the oil was necessary either. Came out very greasy.

I will make this again with far less salt and little to no oil necessity it definitely had potential.

The potatoes used up all the coating, so used a different marinade for the chicken. Little bit of a pain to have to hang around to mix potatoes every 15 minutes. The recipe itself was delicious. Will make it again.

Very good. I was intimidated by the high temp and I only went to 450 still got a nice roasted flavor. I used mild wing sauce and it had the right bite for me. Would have given it 5 stars but I save that for my fried chicken.

My family enjoyed this dish. Very filling. As suggested by others, i served with hot sauce on the side for each to increase their heat as needed.  Main con is it does involve multiple steps, but I will be adding to my recipe box to make again.

Made as noted except omitted salt and used home made ranch dressing. The chicken was super moist and the overall flavor of this dish was fantastic. Not an overwhelming buffalo taste, served extra sauce on the side. Hubby went back for seconds.

This turned out pretty good, but I'm giving it 4 stars because I did make some changes. I did not cook it at 500 degrees. I know you said not to be afraid of the high temp, but I was lol. So I cooked it at 400 for the same amount of time you suggested and it turned out perfect. I also doubled the amount of sauce. I used half (the original amount that the recipe called for) to coat and cook the potatoes in. I didn't really have any left over to marinate the chicken in, so I made another batch for that. This turned out to be a perfect amount of sauce. It did come out a little on the bland side for our taste, so we ended up putting additional hot sauce on it after serving.  But overall it was a hit, and I think i'll be making it again!

It was good but I think it does not need to be cooked at 500 some of the potatoes burned and became mushy. And I used less garlic and onion powder 1tbsp was a bit to much of both.  And ended up making a second bowl of the sauce for the chicken to soak in after the potatoes were smothered in cause there was none left.

I thought this dish was "interesting".  I found it to be on the salty side.  I think my boys liked it more than I did.  There's nothing really wrong with it but nothing really right with it.  It's just okay.
