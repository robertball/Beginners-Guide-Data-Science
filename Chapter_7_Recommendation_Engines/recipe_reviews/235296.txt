If you're short on time and want to make to make an easy dessert, this recipe will work for you.  It makes a good peanut butter cake base complete with chocolate sauce.  Best if served immediately.

Even though I cut back on the sugar - this was way too sweet for my family, and it was too thin - sorry, but wouldn't do this one again.
