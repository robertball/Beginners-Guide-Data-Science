This dessert was wonderful!!  I was afraid it may be a little difficult to make since it has quite a different crust, but it was very easy to make - crust included.  It was truly delicious!  I will be making this again.

Healthy Version, YES! I made this using a 1/2c. Splenda, and 1/2c sugar, plus 1 tsp vanilla extract. Left out the coconut and instead of sugar, gelatin and heavy cream, use FF coo-whip. Super fast and easy and a much lighter summer treat!
