This is a wonderful recipe! My coworkers and family couldn't believe that I made them....they thought they were store bought! One note: be sure to refrigerate the filling for an adequate amount of time (probably at least 4 hours), or else it will be difficult to dip in and out of the chocolate. UPDATE: I have made these a few times since my initial review, and I would suggest refrigerating the truffle mixture overnight if possible. Also, I only use this mixture with chocolate dipped truffles; it's firm and won't allow the center to run as much.

I used this recipe because I was making truffles for the first time, and out of all the truffle recipes on this site, this seemed the simplest, and it was.  The only problem that I found was that the chocolate tended to become sticky very quickly when rolling - this was inspite of the fact that it had been refrigerated for the recommended amount of time.  It was so soft and sticky that I couldn't dip them in melted chocolate as I originally wanted to, and had to roll them in cocoa powder instead, just to make sure that they retained their shape.  Still, they tasted fantastic, and I got rave reviews from all, so I guess it's just a matter of refrigerating even longer before rolling(?)

This is great! It was a little bitter so I added a little fudge that I happened to make previously adn made that the middle, I also found that I had to add a small amount of molding chocolate to help it set up.

These were delicious!!!  My friends loved them.  They were very difficult to to dip in chocolate - the center never firmed up enough in the fridge.  I had to put them in the freezer for about 3 hours before they were ready to dip.

Awful. Did not firm up even after refridgerating over night. Intense cocoa flavor. Will not make again. Nestle's has a MUCH BETTER truffle. I'll stick with that recipe.

These taste good, but didn't turn out the way any truffle I've had were like. Instead of truffles, I got chocolate globs. The filling stuff didn't set up at all. I wont be making truffles ever again

These were a hit on Christmas Eve!! I rolled some in cocoa, some in coconut, and some in red & green sprinkles. They were very decorative as well as delicious.

Thanks so much.  The truffel's (all three kinds)
were wonderful.  I was so pleased with the results that I gave some as Christmas presents that resulted in rave reviews.  They will be a holiday standard in my home.  Susan in Seattle

I tried this recipe at a family baking day and it was great.  I split the batch into 2 batches and added lemmon and orange extract to add some flavor to the truffles.  It went over very well, it was hard to stop eating them!

I made a load of truffles to decorate my brothers birthday cake with. They turned out fantastically and tasted delicious. I definitely recommend this recipe.

I made two different types of truffles as my Christmas project  this year and I made these before I read the ratings for them which was probably good as it seemed some kitchen chefs had some problems with handling and I might have changed my mind about them had I read the reviews.  I have to say I did not encounter the same problems for me they came out awesome!  While they are not quite as firm as the other recipe that I made, they taste really rich!  I found the best way to work was to have bowls with your rolling material ready to go complete with spoons and I used the small scooper from Pampered Chef.  Once I rolled them (best as a two or three person operation if you are making them in bulk like I was today) I put them directly into candy papers.  They are absolutely beautiful and I am now getting ready to box them up for the people in my husbands's office as well as mine. A real nice gift!
