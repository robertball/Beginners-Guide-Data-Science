I followed the directions exactly and was very disappointed. (After cooling and tasting, I put it into a pan and baked it at 250 for 45 minutes, and then it was much, much better.) The long, slow cooking of the old recipe blends the flavors and crisps the cereal and nuts into a snack mix rather than just seasoned cereal. The microwave version tastes as good as the bagged Chex mix, but if you want it better than that, bake it at 250 for about an hour, stirring every 15 minutes or so. Pecans are a great addition if you use the slow bake method.

This is in our house every holiday, by demand from the family.  However, I double all the seasonings, but not the butter, and use whole grain Cheerios instead of the garlic bread things.  I also add quite a bit of Tabasco and cayenne.  Taste the seasonings mixed with the butter before you add the cereals and make sure it tastes spicy - it will be a lot milder once mixed and cooked.  I also cook in the oven at 250 for an hour, stirring every 15 minutes,  instead of cooking in the microwave.  It is MUCH better after cooling on the newspaper covered with paper towels than fresh out of the oven.

I used Crispix instead of Chex (only one box needed to get corn & rice).  Tried this in the microwave and next time I will distribute seasoning more evenly to avoid scorching saturated pieces - also stir more often.  Traditional oven method still best if time allows.

The (old) original recipe had no bagel chips and only garlic and onion salts, no seasoned salt. It also called for lemon juice.  When i make it, i use whole boxes of cereal (my family likes one box each of corn and rice Chex, one box Crispix, and one small box Cheerios. Of course the small pretzel sticks(1/2 bag), one can cashew halves, one can fancy mixed nuts,without peanuts(otherwise the whole batch tastes like peanuts) 12T. butter,4T. lemon juice, 9T. Worchestershire, 1 T. each onion and garlic salts.  Mix all cereals,nuts,pretzels in a large roaster pan. Melt butter and add rest of seasonings, re-warm in mw and mix well so salts are dissolved. Pour over mix in pan, stir well, bake for 45 min. 250 degrees, stirring every 15 min.  Cool really well...I put it outside in the winter so it cools and stays crisp. Freeze in zip bags and use as needed. Enough to take to gatherings and give as gifts.  Enjoy!

Fantastic for my first try!  I will definitely make this again, but next time I'll make more of the spice mix and pour it over the top after mixing all the cereals, pretzels, etc. together.  I think it will help it to mix in better.

Yum!  The classic chex mix - can't get any better!  This recipe can be modified  in so many ways and it still tastes delicious :)  I used club snack sticks broken up instead of bagel chips and used goldfish brand pretzels - just the right size!  Also, couldn't find wheat chex at my local grocery store so I just adjusted the others to make up for the loss.  Again, yum! :)

I was a little nervous about making this in the microwave, as opposed to the traditional oven method, but it turned out great and saved time, which I LOVE!

I am honored to be able to be the first to rate this recipe. Who hasn't made, eaten and loved Chex Mix? Oh the memories of making this with various beloved family members now gone; and the new memories being made of making this with our children. Chex Mix is an American staple, because it is yummy and addicting! Thank you Chex :-)

If you're looking for the true "original" Chex mix recipe, folks, this isn't it.  The original recipe was slow-baked in the oven, didn't have bagel chips, and had enough butter so that the spice blend would actually stick to the snack ingredients.  My daughter followed this recipe (as posted on the box), thinking she'd end up with our favorite snack, and we ended up eating warmed-up cereal and nuts, and wiping our fingers along the bowl to get the spices.  Don't change a great thing, General Mills...and then call it the "original."  This is far from it.

OMG...I cannot believe how easy this was first of all! I was super paranoid about making it in the microwave because i thought it would get soggy, I have always made it in the oven in the past. Let me tell you that this is how i will make it from now on! This recipe is so super easy, super delicious,and super fast!

This is a great recipe.  Easy and not too fattening.  I, too, couldn't find Wheat Chex, so I just added more of the Corn and Rice (they taste better anyway).

Just made three batches of this to put in Christmas gift baskets. It was actually my first time making Chex mix! Please read the following sentence carefully: DOUBLE THE SEASONINGS. DO IT. I'm not joking. The original recipe is SO bland by itself. I took other's suggestions and doubled all the spices except the butter. Then made it according to the recipe. I made it as is the first time and was VERY disappointed with the lack of flavor. I added more seasoning salt to it which helped, but the second time i doubled it and it was much much better. Otherwise definitely a classic!

My family loves this.  My hubby likes to have it to take to work to snack on and my kids love to snack on it too.  I follow the recipe pretty much as is, but one time I added a little more W. sauce, I don't add all the salt, and if I don't have any pretzels I add goldfish.

As is, this recipe isn't that good.  The amount of spice makes the final product too bland, and microwaving doesn't bring out the toasty flavor and crunch.  I had to double the spices, add a little cajun spice, and increase the butter before baking it in the oven as most other people did.  Five stars with the changes!

here are the tips to make this recipe taste how I remember it from childhood. 1) MAKE THE DAY BEFORE (I don't know why, but it tasted perfect the day AFTER my party)   1) double the spices, triple the worcestershire sauce 2) add pecans, honey nuts & honey nut cheerios (if you like them) 3) bake in the oven (follow the instructions from another reviewer--I think it was 250 for 2 hrs, stirring occassionaly)

This is NOT the "Original" Chex party mix.  The original recipe does not contain garlic powder, onion powder, or bagel chips.  They keep saying that this is the the original recipe that's been around for 50 years.  It's not.

Here are some suggestions.  1. Double the batch (this bowl gets emptied way too soon!)  2. Use a big turkey roaster and put the cereal, chips, nuts (we love cashews and almonds), pretzels first.   3. Melt the butter and mix in all the seasonings then drizzle over the dry ingredients, stirring with each pass.  If you melt in the pan and then add the cereal, the items in the bottom get soaked and the rest are dry.   4. Then we spray lemon juice on the mix!  It is not the same without it.  We lightly spray before we put it in the oven and each time we take it out to stir (every 15 minutes). We use a Pamperd Chef sprayer with stright lemon juice.

Only four stars as is.  Five with adjustments. First of all, I baked this in the oven, the way my mom always did.  I can't imagine the it coming out as good in them in microwave and, judging from the comments, it doesn't.  I used Crisipix as another reviewer had mentioned.  Really you could use any combination of ingredients but the big thing I noticed right off is that the seasoning needed to be doubled.  It just wasn't enough to coat 12 cups worth of mix.  I baked at 250 for an hour.  Came out great!

Man, was I ever leery about microwaving this!  I made 2 batches, doubling the spices for each, and did the first round the old fashioned way in the oven at 250 for 1 hour, stirring every 15 minutes.  The 2nd batch, I tried the microwave and IT WORKS!  Just don't go over 5 minutes as it can over-toast (I spaced and let it go about 20 seconds too long).  It didn't ruin it completely, it was just a little over-toasted in one area.  I'll be doing it this way from now on.

Been making Chex mix for years during the holidays. It's a great snack for everyone. I also leave out the wheat chex, don't care for them and often add parmesan twists or other type crackers, etc. Lots of options you can add/omit with this recipe. Also, I always bake mine in the oven, it's so much better that way. I don't see how the micro way could taste good at all or come out crispy like it should be. Double or even triple the seasoning/butter! as is it comes out way too bland! I also add a touch of hot sauce and cayenne pepper!

Baked in oven @250 for 1 hour, stirring every 15 min. Used Crispix, Goldfish pretzels, Honey Cheerios instead of bagel chips, 1/2 c. cocktail peanuts, 1/2 c. cashews & doubled spices based on previous comments. Doubling the spices was key, otherwise this would have been a 5 star review! LOVED it!

Chex mix is delicious but this recipe is rather lacking.  I followed this recipe exactly and I ended up with bland, burnt Chex mix.  I had to add more of everything to this, especially salt.  It  does not need to cook as long as it says.  40-45 minutes is long enough for chex mix.  Also you want to cook this in a small deep pan so it will not burn.  This is a good start for a Chex mix recipe, but plan on making a few changes to make it really good.

Classic recipe which is not always on the box.  Thanks for putting it here!  To keep this gluten-free we just use the corn and rice chex and peanuts.  We do 12 c. of the cereal and 2 c. peanuts.  I love Worcestershire sauce so I double that and bake at 250 for an hour and 15 minutes.  My youngest daughter and I made this an hour ago and can't wait for it to come out of the oven!

I agree with the reviewer who said after putting this back in the conventional oven it was better. It was not at all crisp after the microwave method. Next time I will stick with the seasoning blend, but use the oven, @ 250 for 40 - 50 minutes . Waaay better.

I doubled the seasonings and it was really good.  Too bland if you didnt AND I baked it in the over.   Makes it wayyyyyyy better.

Note: I baked in the oven for an hour instead of microwaving

A good starting point but I like to make modifications (i.e. I added Cheez-Its as that's how we ate it growing up and added more pretzel [sticks] than called for).  All that being said, I definitely think you need lots more of the seasoning.  Because I added cheezits and more pretzels, I doubled the seasoning and still added more during baking.  I'd probably double my doubling of the Worcestershire in the future and add more salt too.

I think the flavor of the mix is good.  However, I felt like the ratio of the butter/seasonings was off.  I don't feel like it coated enough of the mix well enough so it felt a little bland.  If I make this again I might increase the butter/seasonings.  I used the slow cooking method in the oven because I think it turns out better that way.

This is a holiday favorite at our house.  Firstly, I have never tried the microwave for this, but 250º for ohe hour, stirring every 15 mins is the preferred method for me. Also, I recommend Lawry's seasoned salt for this recipe.  I've tried a generic brand and it just wasn't nearly as good.  Also, instead of the bagel chips, I use baby Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers, I've also used Cheerios instead of the bagel chips.  Treat your family to a delicious, traditional snack at the holidays, or anytime!

I make this every year around the holidays and love it but one thing to know is it is not vegetarian because of the Worcestershire sauce.  My easy way to make it vegetarian is to use instead soy sauce (I use the reduced sodium), double the garlic and onion powder, and add a little pepper.  Yum!

just made this again for the umpteenth time. BUT....never in the microwave, always slow baked in a 275 oven stirring about every 10 -15 minutes for an hour. Also, I up the butter to a full cube and am very generous with my spices. Can't ever find the rye chips or bagel chips so I always use the goldfish crackers and sesame stick crackers. This year I did find a corn chip with flax seed and love that addition too. 4 stars for the micro directions, 5 for the oven.

Recipe is alright but I think it ends up with a much better flavor if it's cooked in the oven.  250 deg. for 1 hour.

So disappointed.  I wanted to surprise my husband with this special snack he enjoyed as a kid from his Grammie thinking Original Chex meant just that!  Followed recipe to the tee....BLAND. Then read reviews.....even after doubling the spices w/o  extra butter and using oven method....just NOT the same.  Next time I will read reviews 1st before taking the leap of faith in a trusted recipe

I followed the recipe to the T and did the microwave as instructed, stirring after 2 minutes, when I returned it to the Microwave for for the second 2 minutes, it burnt the wheat chex and the pretzels. I tried another batch and it was the same result, be careful, I recommend you spread it on a baking sheet and bake it, bummed, first failure ever at Allrecipes

Great recipe. Makes a large amount. Great snack to have around when watching football! I prefer the oven-roasted recipe.

Oven directions:

Heat oven to 250°F. In large bowl, mix cereals, nuts, pretzels and bagel chips; set aside. In ungreased large roasting pan, melt butter in oven. Stir in seasonings. Gradually stir in cereal mixture until evenly coated. Bake 1 hour, stirring every 15 minutes. Spread on paper towels to cool, about 15 minutes. Store in airtight container.

I love this recipe. I have for years. My little twist is to add just a little parmesan cheese and Frank's Hot Sauce. TIP: You really don't need a whole lot of seasoning salt in this recipe, with the worchestershire it'll be plenty salty on it's own. If you want the best flavor, make it in the oven!

Instead of using seasoned salt, I substitute celery salt. Also use garlic salt instead of garlic powder, and add about 3/4 Tablespoon vinegar.

I would never use the microwave. Bake for one hour at 350 and stir every 15 mins. Comes out more crispy. I use Cherrios instead of wheat chex and skip the bagel bites. Sometimes add some Tabasco for some heat. I've been eating this for 50 years.

Does it get better than Chex Mix?  You seriously can't go wrong making this for any crowd or just for your family.
I agree with other reviewers that the traditional oven method really makes for better texture.  I also add a whole stick of butter (8 tbsp instead of 6) and I add 2 tbsp of Tabasco for a spicy kick - it sounds like a lot but it once it's distributed around all of the mix, it gives a good kick but nothing that will burn your mouth out.

I did not add the nuts or the bagel chips as I did not have any on hand.  Instead I subbed 2 cups of Cheerios.  I cut the salt down to 1tsp as well.   I made it in the microwave as instructed.  In the past I have always baked it for an hour, stirring every 15 minutes.  I think there is a deeper flavor with the oven method than with the microwave...  This is good for quick and easy but I'll stick to the oven baked version in the future.

Excellent. I used a big plastic bowl and mixed well before and during microwaving.  Allow time to cool and everything crisps up like the oven. You don't have to worry about scorching and it's fast and easy.  I make up a gallon ziploc bagful of dry ingredeints in advance and when ready I add sauce ingredients!! I like cheeze crackers in mine instead of pretzels, but you can make any changes you like!!

I can't believe I've been eating this for over 50 years!! Still good as ever and with some of the new flavors in chips, do dads, and pretzels the combination are endless. This time I added honey/mustard pretzels and left the bagel chips out, added 1/2t of celery salt, and a couple of extra tablespoons of butter and Worcestershire sauce. Taste great and I think it will go over good at tonight's Christmas party!

Okay, c'mon! 5*'s the way I made it in my youth!  What happened folks?  The microwave is faster, but sacrifices the taste!  You are right, KID, there was an oven involved!  Melt your butter on a cookie sheet (250 degree oven), then add your seasoning (I don't remember the garlic or onion, but I added it). Stir the cereal and nuts to coat, and then every 15 min. for 45 min. to an hour turn the mix to bake evenly. Perfect!!!!

DIdn't like microwave method. Went back to oven method 250 for 1hour stirring every 15 min. We really like it with garlic and onion powder than the salt. Always put tobacco in the mixture. Just a little kick. I always use butter it's not watered down. Oven method gets a 5 star.

My mother made the real original Chex mix recipe when I was a kid. Instead of butter, it had vegetable oil; no onion powder and garlic salt instead of powder. No bagel chips (they didn't exist) and pretzel stix instead of bite-sized. Equal amounts of peanuts and mixed nuts, also Cheerios and Kix cereals. Baked at 250 degrees for an hour (not  microwaved). I think the longer cooking time at a low temp helps to blend the flavors. My family still makes this recipe whenever we get together for special occasions.

I followed directions and ended up with burnt bits and mushy pieces.  I will not cook in microwave again.  Had to bake it anyway, so might as well stick with that.  All other ingredients are great!!

Not sure what happened.  I followed the recipe, mixed in the wet ingredients and tossed with the dry.  Microwaved for 2 minutes, began to smell a tiny bit burnt smell.  Stirred and microwaved for 2 more minutes.  YIKES!  I had to take it out early, because of the intense amount of burnt smell filling my kitchen.  The entire bowl was BLACK!!  Needless to say, this didn't work out for me :(

I love Chex Mix, but I don't eat it anymore because of the BHT found in Chex cereals. So I used some organic multigrain "Chex" instead. I didn't have any onion powder so I just used dried minced onion instead. Also, we had no bagel chips so I just left them out. I baked the mix at 250 degrees for 1 hour, stirring every 15 minutes, instead of using the microwave. Though not as good as the Chex Mix I remember, using the organic "Chex" still turned out fine.

this recipe needs some serious revisions. i doubled the amount of topping because when i added the original measurements, the mix was still VERY dry. i also put in 2 extra tablespoons of worcestershire. instead of a total of 9 cups of chex products, i added 6 and then added a cup each of goldfish and cheerios. i also baked in the oven on 275 for an hour turning every 10 minutes. came out tasting delicious!

This is the microwave recipe that you find on the Chex boxes now.  The microwave version may be simpler (?) but nothing beats the toasty flavor you get from the slow baked "Original" recipe.  250 degrees for an hour; stirring every 15 minutes.  Remove from oven, spread on paper towels to cool.  We sprinkle Tabasco over the mix before the final 15 minutes of baking.

I make this the old-fashioned way, cooking it at 250 degrees for an hour and stirring every fifteen minutes. I also double the worcestershire and add 2-3 tablespoons of hot sauce, yum!!

I always make this recipe in the microwave in a 5 quart corning casserole.  Melt the butter, add seasoned salt & I use A-1 instead of Worcestershire.  Stir to blend.  Dump in mixed nuts and pretzels. I like to stir with a silcon spatula--it doesn't seem to break the cereal as much.  Dump in the cereal. Stir to blend. Microwave 2 minutes on high.  Stir one final time and microwave one more minute.  Mix is not crispy when it first comes out of the microwave, but it crisps up nicely after a few minutes.  You can make a several batches quickly this way, which is nice if you're giving it for gifts.

As good as this might be, it shouldn't be called "original." At the time this recipe was originally developed (in the '50s?), bagel chips didn't even exist.

My BIG Family LOVES my party mix! I've divulged my secret to my 3 girls but everyone says mine is the best they've ever had. The "secret" is real butter, about a tsp of lemon juice,  AND I double the normal amounts of Worcestershire sauce & powder ingredients for a single batch. It takes also double the time, about 15-20 minutes, stirring every 2-3 minutes. I also add a tsp. or so Louisiana Hot Sauce. Gives the spicy flavor without the hotness. My Grandchildren (twins age-boy & girl 8, 6, 4  love it, too!).

Just like mom made when I was a kid...with a few tweeks.  I used a bit more of the wet stuff (aka butter and Worcestershire sauce) and seasoning.  I also added cayenne because we like it spicy, it was awesome! I don't think exact measurements are needed on this, it's all about your taste.  I also put it in the oven at 350 and stirred it every 15 min til I felt it was done (about an hour depending on the amount you are making and how thinly it is spread on your baking base i.e. cookie sheet/roasting pan, etc.)  I am allergic to tree nuts except for almonds so I used raw almonds and dry roasted peanuts.  I think next time I would try leaving the nuts out until almost done then add just honey roasted peanuts for a little savory sweet action.

This was really fun to make with my daughter.  I doubled the seasonings as one reviewer suggested. I used broken up garlic Melba toast in place of bagel chips.  Also, I cooked in the oven, just because it's more fun that way.  This turned out fantastic.

Haven't tried this one, I still use my Mama's recipe from the 60's or 70's. She always added more sauce, I double mine plus she also used lemon juice and instead of pita chips we use Cheerio's.  Bake it on 250 degrees stirring every 15 minutes. Going to make some for the game Saturday.

2 stars for recipe as is. I made two batches to use up all the cereal boxes and the first one was way too bland. I doubled the seasonings of the second batch and it was nearly perfect, though maybe a touch salty. Next time I will add an extra T of W. sauce and maybe 1 t less seasoning salt. Oh, and as so many others suggested, I went the oven route: 250 for 1 hr, stirred every 15 minutes.

My grandmother's recipe is almost identical with two important changes! Add 1-2T of Frank's Red Hot sauce (Grandma put in 1 T Tabasco but that seems too extreme) to the mixture while melting butter. Also 1 teas. celery salt. Don't forget to add Cheerios, equal portions as the Chex Product! Everyone who has tried my recipe says it is the best ever!

Traded Hidden Valley ranch dressing dry packet instead of individual spices.  Once the mix was cooling, I still needed to add Garlic Powder to taste, and then additional Lawry's seasoning salt to taste.  I really enjoy seasoned mixes, so I added quite a bit in addition to the recipe.  Turned out great & well seasoned!

I was looking for a gluten-free snack and this is it!  I opted out of the pretzels & garlic chips, but did use pecans and spicy spanish peanutes.   We like a little kick in our snacks so I added 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper into the butter mixture.  I also added Honey Nut Chex which is a pleasant surprise and adds balance to the cayenne heat.  I HIGHLY recommend taking the time to bake this at 250 for an hour stirring every 15 minutes.  I lined my pan with Reynolds Non-Stick Liner and it worked great with easy clean up.  It was delicious!

I have been making this for years.  I do, however, reduce the amounts of the three cereals and increase the amounts of nuts, pretzels, and bagel chips.  I didn't have the bagel chips this time, so I used little cheese crackers.  And I always add sesame sticks to mine.  This is a great recipe that makes a big batch, and freezes very well.

I give the original recipe 3 stars because its a good starting point but just too bland. I like to use 8 tablespoons of butter instead of 6 and add extra seasonings. I also used substitute half of the garlic powder for garlic salt.

Cooking it in the microwave burnt the butter within first two minutes.  Totally ruined.  Not sure how this works for anyone else.

YOU HAVE TO BAKE IT FOR THE BEST RESULTS! SKIP THE MICROWAVE!!!

If you have never had homemade Chex mix, you are missing out! It is completely different from that bland stuff that comes pre-packaged. However, as a lover of salt and butter, I usually DOUBLE the sauce, add more Chex and pretzels, and use 8 tbsp of butter. Mmmm. Tastes like Christmas!

A family favorite around the holidays. I have never used the microwaved version, I spread on a cookie sheet and bake at 350 for about 45 mins to an hour (or when crisped enough for my liking) turning every 20 mins or so.

My first time making Chex Mix! I like making it instead of buying it! I doubled the seasoning for one batch of chex mix. I always thought home made chex mix was VERY bland, but doubling the seasonings turned out MUCH better!!

I make this every year during the holidays, everyone loves it. I personally don't care for Wheat Chex, so I use Kellogg's Crispix, which is rice on one side, corn on the other. I also use an entire cube of butter (8 tbsp). When adding the spices and worcestershire, I use the amounts called for, but I make sure the measuring spoons are VERY full. I also use the microwave, and nobody has ever complained. As far as it not being the so called "original" recipe, to that I say WHO CARES? This is yummy stuff!

My MIL didn't have the seasoned salt one time so she substituted Tony Sachre's (?it's a green can) and it was AMAZING.  I started making that change a constant when I make it.  It can't be beat.  Also, I use the big twisted pretzel sticks broken up into smaller pieces, they absorb the flavoring way better than the little pretzels or the thin sticks.  ;)

I basically use this recipe except I add 1 tsp of Tabasco.  It doesn't make it spicy - just good!  And I agree with other reviews.  The best way to make Chex Mix is to bake at 200 degrees for about 45 minutes, stirring every 15 minutes, then cool on paper towels.

I agree with other reviewers to double the seasonings except the butter.  (tasted very bland the first time)  I also ended up baking it in the oven at 250 for an hour, stirring every 15 min, because the microwave version just didn't seem quite right.  So for the 2nd batch, I made these changes, and substituted olive oil (I was out of real butter) and it was absolutely delicious!  I couldn't tell the difference from the butter version. (except it was a little heart healthier.)  To make a spicy version--I add a very liberal shaking of tabasco sauce to the other seasonings.

This one gets five stars for two reasons: 1- it is a classic recipe, and 2- I now have microwave directions to make it! It took forever to make in the oven and I'm glad to see that there is a microwave recipe cause it is so much quicker!

I made this for the first time with  my kids and we loved it! I did use the oven method, baking at 250 degrees for one hour, stirring every 15 minutes. I also doubled the dry seasonings. I used corn and rice chex, roasted peanuts and small pretzels. It's great because you can put really just about anything in it that you want!! I think this is the start of a new holiday tradition for us!

I love Chex Mix but the newer microwave version isn't very good.  I wasn't able to find the oven method which I've always used in the past.  I found the nuts to be tough and chewey with the microwave version and the seasonings didn't bake into the cereal like they do with the oven method.

Actually, the "real original recipe" called for Morton seasoned salt instead of the collection of seasoning.  No other seasoned salt matches Morton's and unfortunately, they no longer sell it.  Since I stocked up, I don't use the other seasonings.  I do use the microwave in a 9x13 pan, 2 min. on high, stir throughly, and repeat 2 more times. Spread on paper towels and allow to cool completely.  The stirring and the cooling are the secrets to great chex mix.
ADDITIONAL NOTE:
-the posted recipe is too much for a bowl, divide it for more surface area to cook/dry.

Simple and delicious.  I've made this 6 times in the past month.  Every where I have taken it, I come home with an empty bowl.  Very easy to modify to your family's likings.  The one change I do make is in the cooking method.  I do not use the microwave.  Instead, I spread it on a cookie sheet and bake for 1-hour at 250° degrees, stirring every 15 minutes.  Cool completely and store in airtight container.

Of course this stuff is a classic.  It's really good, but my husband joked about needing a spoon and some milk because the Chex is so overwhelming.  Next time I made it I used 3 c LESS Chex and increased the pretzels and bagel chips (which I subbed Ritz cracker chips for because I live overseas and the commissary doesn't carry bagel chips).  Then it was perfect!

Still trying to find the original.  I've read so much and tried different varieties.  I used to have it and now can't find it.  I followed the advice left by many and doubled the seasonings - still I'm finding it a bit bland.  I also roasted it but will try in microwave too.  This was good, it's just not the original like Chex is saying it is....

I make this every year, but have strayed from the original by using goldfish, cheezits, and any other small crackers I can think of. It's always good. I still like to bake it in the oven though, instead of using the microwave. I bake it in a 200 degree oven for 45 minutes, turning the mixture over with a spatula every 15 minutes. I have also enjoyed adding 1/2 to 2/3 cup of raisins, or craisins for the final 15 minutes. It doesn't last long around my house.

Tried and true classic but you MUST make it in the oven. 250, stir every 15 minutes. I leave out the nuts and usually the pretzels, and add a cup or two of cheerios (mom always did so I do too). Sometimes I throw in a cup or two of honeycombs too, to give it a little taste of sweet.

I agree with doubling the spices.  I also add paprika, cayenne and most importantly I add 1/2 tsp Cajun Seasoning + more sprinkled while mixing.  Gives it just the right amount of kick.  I use Cheerios in place of bagel chips.

How can you go wrong with this one?  Used cheerios instead of wheat chex and increased the pretzels to 2 cups after I left out the bagel chips.  My son likes the original better than the deviled chex mix, which was also a hit.

I agree with some of the other posters. I make enough of this at once (usually 2 or 3 times the original recipe) that I bake it in the oven instead of putting it in the microwave. I bake it at 250 for an hour, stirring every 15 minutes.   I love making my own chex mix because I can put my favorite things in it.   Mine has cheese itz, cashews (my husband is allergic to peanuts), corn chex only, pretzels, and rye chips.   YUM!!!

I think this is wonderful. Much better than the store bought chex mix. I always cook it in the over, though. 250 degrees for about 45 minutes. Microwave makes it soggy. My whole family loves it.

Five stars, only if made in the oven.  Chex Mix is a New Year's tradition with my family.  For some reason we rarely eat it any other time!  I always double the seasoning mixture and bake it at 250 for an hour.  It's so much better than the store-bought Chex Mix!

No variation will ever beat the Original!  I love that this can be microwaved - very fast and easy.

I made this as written except I replaced the bagel chips with pita chips because I had them in my pantry. For the nuts, I used a planters mix of pecans, cashews and almonds.  I also baked the mix rather than microwaving ---- personal preference. I love this mix.  I hope my family doesn't eat it all before our guests arrive.  Next time I may add cayenne pepper as some recommended.  My family likes a little zing too, but I wasn't sure about my guests. If there is any left over I may add it then!  Yum!

I've always been a fan of the Chex Mix that comes straight off the shelf, and decided to give this mix a try. After following a tweaked recipe where I increased the spices and changed a few ingredients (honey-roasted peanuts, flavored pita chips rather than bagel chips) it has become a milder version of the store-bought Chex Mix. This can definitely be remedied by increasing the amount of  seasonings even more, but I've liked the cutback from adding too much flavor to the party mix. This nice and easy recipe gave me just the perfect base for a party mix that I needed, which is not too overwhelming in flavor and still great to snack on.

Definitely use butter it makes a big difference in the taste.  Bake in the oven so the butter/garlic mixture gets absorbed into the cereal.  Would not use the microwave for thise purpose, since it isn't quickly heating the ingredients.  Leave out the seasoned salt since most snack food items alredy add enough salt to this recipe.  You can really use any combination of your favorite snack items.

I had second thoughts about using the microwave, and I should have listened to my instincts. It was very chewy. I'll stick yo making it in the oven.

I tried the recipe exactly as it was on the box and was not impressed.  It seems like it needs alot of tweaking to make it good.  It's a good place to start, though.  I'm just not a big fan Worcestershire sauce.

This party mix should not be called "original"... it is not. No microwaves were even around when my mom made this in the 40s. It was slowly baked in the oven. I've made both & no comparison in flavour.

This must bake in the oven to get the delicious flavor!  250 and then take out to stir every 15-20 minutes.  I like to put Bugels in mine if I can find them!

I did change the recipe  so the 4 stars could have been my fault?? I'm thinking it was the "seasoning salt" that gave me the "chemical" like taste?? It's the only thing I can think of that would. I had read the review that the original recipe used garlic & onion salts (along with seeing it on the box) but I didn't have but the powders.  I also doubled the spices - won't do that next time either - way too much for us...but it does keep us from  eating too much of it ;)  I would say maybe half again on the spices.

This is a Christmas tradition at our house.  But over the years we've 
tweaked it. We've always used plain old party peanuts and instead of
bagel chips, we've come to prefer Pepperidge Farm cheddar goldfish. The first recipe we used called for Cheerios and small stick pretzels,
the "nuts and bolts" which we still use. When the family sits around the table playing a game, there's always nuts and bolts and beer! How good it that?

this recipe is delicious! the cooking method leaves something to be desired (as has been stated over and over).  the one time i tried in microwave it was pretty blah. the oven really roasts the nuts and cereal to perfection.  i double the seasonings, and make a ton of this and my family looks forward to it every holiday. this christmas i will be adding cheerios for my son who is addicted to them.  happy holidays!

I experimented with both margarine and stick butter. The margarine is much better. The stick butter doesn't mix with the powdered ingredients evenly. It stays hovering in pouring bowl and doesn't pour out evenly over mix. 
I also added a little tobasco to give it a little more flavor but not to much to be hot. Very good. I'm experimenting with chipolte tobasco. So far so good. all positive comments so far.

I make this every year during the holidays!  However, I double all of the seasonings and bake it at 200 degrees for one hour stirring every 15 minutes. I add some sort of cheese crackers and  once cooled I add chocolate m&m's to add a little sweetness!  It's always a huge hit!

I did this recipe but we were unable to find the rye chips or bagel chips. Over all we followed the recipe to the exact specs(except for the chips)  It was a really good recipe.  We will make this again.  We also made a BBQ one it turned out awesome.  I think that we should have added a little more butter and worcestershire sauce but it turned out really good other wise.

I made this because I wanted a large quantity summer snack for my teenage boys who inhale everything I bring home. I omited worcestershire and used cheese pretzels and garlic parmesan pita chips (they are a lighter texture then bagel chips) I followed the recipe as written and was impressed at how easy it was to make and loved the results! Thank you for posting!!!

I like the oven version better myself but it is still very good. I substitute cheerios for the bagel chips. You can also freeze the mix in ziploc bags. I do this every year and hubby has it for months.

Very good recipe.  You don't need to let this cool all splayed out.  I just turn my sink into an ice bath and place the bowl of mix into it, stirring once every few minutes.  It works fast and doesn't change the texture or flavor.

This is a good starting point to allow experimentation.  I only use the ingredients for the mix that I like so that cuts down on waste and then the seasoning with the exception of the butter are all doubled atleast.  It really depends on your taste.  I also add some hot sauce to spice it up a bit more.

This is one of my favorites!  I like to add 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper for a little kick.  Also, I was a little disappointed with the microwave method, so I went back to using the oven; 250 degrees for an hour or so.

This would be a 5 but please skip the microwave and use the oven! Cook at 250 and stir every 15 minutes. Also I usually cut the seasoning salt down to 1 tsp since the worcestershire tends to be salty enough.

It's kind of wimpy.  The crispiness is perfect, but we need MORE SEASONINGS!  Less salt. Next time I am going to double the seasonings.  Maybe it needs cayenne?

This is my first time making chex mix so thank you to the reviewers that gave the oven directions, even the chex box had the microwave directions and I wanted to do it the old fashioned way.  I used regular goldfish, pretzel goldfish, peanuts, rice and corn chex.  I added more seasoning salt then the recipe called for and I also added a few teaspoons of cayenne pepper because we like spicy food.  It had a very mild heat and turned out wonderful, my husband and kids still pout more hotsauce on while eating it.  I plan on making this for Thanksgiving and i think everybody is going to love it!

This was a huge deal in my family growing up. Everyone begged my grandmother to make it. She even had a special "crock" that she stored it in. This is NOT as good as the oven method, but easier and still good.

Feel a little silly that I have never made Chex Mix. My daughter thinks I can make the sun rise now. I did  mine in the oven, so I could only give it 4 stars since I didn't use the microwave.

I've made this recipe in the microwave several times.  SO much easier and more efficient to do it this way and equally as good.  I guess my micro is pretty powerful though b/c 6 mins is almost too long for a full batch.  3:30mins for a half batch.

We love Chex Mix for the holidays  and  basically use this recipe, with double the spices, like other reviewers, not the butter or liquids... and never, never microwave it. I taste as it bakes and if it doesn't seem spicy enough I'll sprinkle on a little more as it goes...some in our family really love spice and for them I add a bit of smoked paprika and a bit of cayenne.   Bake  1.5 hours at 250 degrees, stirring every 15 minutes.  NEVER, NEVER microwave. The true original  recipe would not have been made in a microwave oven. The house smells terrific as it bakes, and everyone is waiting patiently for it to be done .

I did all the recipe called for and got nice soggy Chex. DO NOT MICROWAVE. I can’t believe Chex would advertise this, along with the sheep that call this a good recipe. 

Put in the oven at 225 for 20 minutes, stirring every 5. Shame on you Chex.

I left out the Worchestershire sauce because I didn't have any on hand and instead added one more tablespoon of butter and a little more seasoning salt. It worked out great!

This recipe is the tops.  I have made this 5x since the beginning of the  year.  I don't use wheat chex,  I put in cashews instead of mixed nuts,  I use straight pretzels broke in 1/2, and multi grain cheerios instead of the garlic chips.  I use  a spatula to mix the ingredients since they get very hot and spread it out on newspaper for cooling.  Once cool you can pick up the paper and pour it right into a container or zipper bag.   It turns out fantastic every time.  Everyone in the family loves this ...and you sure can't beat the price...!!!

I used low-sodium seasoned salt and substituted small cheese crackers for the bagel chips, but otherwise made the recipe exactly as printed. It was excellent, and very munch-worthy at the party.

With a few misgivings, I made this as directed in the microwave. I should have paid attention to my misgivings. My microwave, a Kenmore, has serious hot spot issues and a third of my batch of mix burned as a result. I'm posting this as a warning for others who may have similar issues with their microwaves. In the future, I'll be using the old oven method.

Good base recipe made just to my liking with a few changes. I double the spice mix and add a few dashes of Tabasco. Also, I substitute the Wheat Chex with Hot and Spicy Cheez-its and the pretzels with Trader Joe's sesame sticks. Usually, I make a double batch in the oven using my turkey roaster pan. Delish!!

I use this basic recipe, but I'm hesitant to say I use Crispix cereal and add Cheerios. I just make sure it works out to 9 cups of  cereals. What I like is the seasoning. I also follow the original directions and cook it in a 250 degree oven for 1 hour, stirring every 15 minutes.

I made this and the original version is the best. I cooked it in the oven at 250 for an hour and stirred every 15 minutes. Takes longer but well worth the extra time?? took it to an office party it was the first thing gone??you can use any variation that your family likes!

I've always cooked mine in the crock pot - lets me do a big batch at a time and with minimal "supervision" -everything gets coated and no "soggy bits". Put the crockpot on high and leave the lid off. Stir maybe every 20 mins. Usually done in an hour and a half or so. I also add some hot sauce for just a bit of a kick :)You can play around with the spices. I also add pepitas (raw pumpkin seeds), sunflower seeds, sometimes cashews...it never has to be the same twice!

This was very good! I did follow the recommendations of others and use the baking method instead of the microwave. Next time I will try adding more seasoning as I felt it was a tad bland, but definitely a great recipe!

I was born in the 50s.  Chex Mix is just a tradition at the holidays.  I find it funny how the "Original" recipe has evolved a bit over the years.  The latest seems to include the garlic things and made in the microwave!  Heehee.  Whatever you add, I still like the "Original" spice combination, although I usually add a bit more.

I love Chex@ Party Mix.... it's been a holiday staple in our family for years. I make it without the nuts and pretzels though, that way I'm not picking though the mix taking out all the Chex@.

This was super easy in the microwave, and actually I think better than the oven method.  The only thing is that it seemed like it needed a tad more seasoning, so next time I will add alittle more.

I don't know how you can call this the "original". The original party mix was not done in the microwave! It needs to be in the oven for an hour @ 250 and stirred every 15 minutes. And if you like it sweeter, I add a cup honey nut cheerios.  Yummy!

Yum! 5 stars when you bake it instead of microwave it -  I added some Creole Seasoning with the butter and other seasonings, tossed it all and baked it in the oven at 350 for about 20 min tossing it every 5 or so minutes. Nice and crisy and very tasty!

Great snack!  I added two cups of mixed nuts instead of the bagel chips (I used the deluxe nuts with no peanuts).  And I added a 1/2 tsp. of cayenne pepper because we like things with a little kick.  Then I cooked at 250 for 1 hour.

I'm not sure if it's my childhood memories of this snack, but to me, I don't remember pretzels of course I didn't stand by my mother as she made it, but something is a muck about this recipe. I can appreciate this recipe because everyone can tweak it for themselves with this recipe as a starter.

Classic Chex mix at it's best! Been eating this during the holiday season since I was a little girl. As soon as Chex Cereals go on sale I will be making this! Great snack for parties, at home, or really any time. Much better then the store bought chex mix!

I love this stuff! I have to admit, I had a LOT of misgivings about making it in the microwave, the really brown crunchy parts are my favorite. To my surprise, I still got them! It was SO much quicker than the whole bake for an hour, stir every 15 minutes way, thanks!

Three stars the original way. Very good when edited! Double the dry spice ingredients. It’s super bland if you don’t double. I’ve subbed different things- pretzels, goldfish, garlic pita chips. Just go with your liking but be cognizant of the dry to wet ingredients. A couple of splashes of Tabasco is good too. I follow the measurements for the original recipe when I sub. I’ve not tried microwaving it. I’ve always had a 250 oven. Bake 1 hour and stir every 15 minutes. Store in a ziplock after cooling.

I go ahead and use an whole stick of butter and a tad bit more seasoning (I like mine salty) I also add gold fish crackers!  I prefer the baking method over the microwave but that’s just me. Awesomely addictive.

I didn't love this.  It was lacking something bold.  I did follow others suggestions of doubling the spices. This just didn't taste like the "Classic" Chex Mix to us.

Much better the original method of baking for 1hour in 250F degree oven, stirring every 15 minutes. I add 1 teaspoon hot sauce and double the mixed nuts.

As written too bland and not decadent enough for a holiday treat. I tripled all the spices, used four tablespoons of Worsteshire, used a whole stick of butter and omitted the bagel chips. Melted the butter in the toaster over, poured over cereal and nuts in a large bowl, mixed well with seasonings, then baked at 250 for an hour, stirring every 15 minutes. Then its Five Stars.

I found the original recipe to be very dry and bland, but with modifications, it can be a 5 star recipe.  I like for mine to be a lot more coated with flavor.  I've played around with this recipe a few times and this is what I've determined is tastiest.

Double the butter.  
Double the Worcestershire sauce (plus a splash more)
Double the onion powder
Double the garlic power

Do NOT double the season salt because it can get to be too salty.  With the additional Worcestershire sauce, that seems to be salty enough.

I can't find the awesome garlic chips in my store anymore.  Therefore, instead of adding 1 cup of pretzels and 1 cup of the chips, I use 2 cups of Gardettos Original flavor mix, and love it.

I do prefer baking over microwaving.  I lay it all flat on parchment paper and bake at 250 for 60 minutes, stirring every 15 minutes.

With these modifications, I plan to make this again soon!

My family loves this recipe and at 6 minutes per batch,  it makes great gifts for friends and neighbors.
Changes:
I mix all dry ingredients in a paper sack first before placing them in the large bowl.
I double (4 tbsp)  "whats that there" sauce only.
I cut the Wheat and Rice Chex to two cups each but add two cups Cheerios, two cups of pretzel squares, 1/2 cup cashews, 1/2 cup Brazil nuts (cut in half), and one cup of multi-color Goldfish for some added interest.
In between microwave segments I return all ingredients to a clean sack lined with paper towels and shake to coat cereal evenly.
YOU NEED TO LET THE MIX COOL AND CRISP IN THE CLOSED SACK FOR A FEW HOURS OR EVEN OVERNIGHT . This also allows the spice flavors to marry with the cereal. 
As others have stated, this is NOT good warm and fresh from the microwave.
I can make 5 or 6 batches in an hour with this technique which makes it perfect for gifting.

Easy to make in the microvave. It does take a day for the flavors to fully develop. Was not as strongly flavored or as salty as I remembered and will experiment with increasing seasonings. I have Worcestershire seasoning (like seasoned salt) and will try using flavored olive oil with the butter for variety. Will update later.

I can’t eat the Wheat  Chex so I used the Honey Nut Chex instead.  That gave a sweet taste along with the salty, more bold flavor.  I also added some Christmas M & M’s.  All who eat it enjoy it!

Love this recipe!  We make it every year around Christmas. I tweak a few things:  I don’t do the wheat Chex. I use Cheezits instead of those. I substitute Cheerios for the garlic bagel things, and I cook in the oven as others have mentioned.

Such an easy recipe, the one I used to use, had to be done in a roaster pan and you had to bake it for like 10 minutes take it out stir it up than put it back in for like another 10 minutes. This was so simple, in the microwave.

A MUST!!! After it dries out dust it with table salt and a little more season salt. Exactly as what you get in the store in the bag.

Made it as directed minus the bagel chips as they were not part of the original and the reason I won't buy the bagged Chex Mix. I just added more mixed nuts. Making it in the microwave was different but it still tasted the same. I will make it again. Only gave it 4 stars because of the bagel chips.

Like most people I doubled the seasonings and baked the mixture at 250F for 45 min, stirring every 15 min. The first batch came out way too salty so on the second batch I doubled all the seasonings except for the seasoned salt. On another batch I also added some hot sauce to give it a slight kick and nearly removed all of the seasoning salt.

Easy to make!  After reading reviews I decided to cook it in the oven at 250 degrees for an hour while stirring every 15 minutes.   I have also made this using a tablespoon of paprika and another time with a tablespoon of chili powder.   Change it up and use different spices!  Yummy. I’m going to try just butter with cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice!   Can’t wait!

It’s so yummy! Not exactly the old recipe I remember when I was a kid but it’s very good. Instead of the bagel chips we use cheese crackers and cashews and peanuts instead of mixed nuts. There are so many things you can do to change this up, we like to experiment and see what we get.

I'm not a fan of the pretzels and I never can find the bagel chips, so I skip those.  This is better than the Chex Mix you buy in the bag.

Instead of microwaving, I spread it on a cookie sheet and bake at 300 until it is just turning crisp.

I changed the recipe a bit by baking the mix at 250% instead of microwaving.  Everything else I did by the recipe.  For some reason, it didn't seem to be seasoned enough for our taste.  I think next time I would add more worchestshire seasoning salt and onion powder and see if that helped.  Husband also agreed not seasoned enough but he complained the garlic taste was too strong, but then he's not much of a garlic fan.  I'm torn, because while it tastes good, I just wish for more of a punch.

With the recipe as is, I give it a 4-star, the seasonings used are the perfect choice. To make it a 5-star Chex Mix however, here are a few of my recommendations:Like many of the other ratings, I’m a big believer in the baking method. 250F, stirring every 15 minutes for 45-60 minutes based on preferred level of crispness. I also double the seasoning, but not the butter.

I used the traditional  oven method. I have no reason for liking it better than the microwave method, it just seems to taste better. The oven is usually on during the holiday season anyway.

I agree with other reviews, it's not the same in the microwave and it's not the original recipe. I'm gluten free, so I needed to make  some adjustments (gf Cheerios and pretzels of course no wheat Chex). My mom used to mix the butter, worst sauce & seasonings the day before baking and it was delicious! A family favorite for sure.

Very good mix. I used Bugles, Honey Nut Cheerios (for a bit of sweet), Crispix, Cheesy Fish, Cheezies, Hickory Sticks, & mixed nuts.  (couldn't find corn chips which I will find and add to the next batch). I omitted the pretzels which no one eats in my house. I agree with reviewers that the spice is a bit lacking as written so I increased but didn't double. I added the original ingredients and then mixed a side dish of the dry spices and sprinkled a bit over the mixture each time I stirred. Baked 250 for 1 hour, stirring every 15 min or so.  Addictive!

I used a Hatch Chile seasoning mix on the second batch. The first batch was standard fare.

Please disregard this review since I changed the recipe and that's what I'm basing the star rating off.  This note is for my personal records.
Made it with the ingredients I had :  crispix, Kix, wheat Chex, pretzels and ritz crackers.  Doubled the seasonings but left the butter.  could add less butter and be just fine.  The crackers didn't take up very much of the seasoning.  My kids weren't thrilled with it, but I thought it was extremely addictive and CAN NOT make it again unless I'm going to give away some to a neighbor...or else I will eat it all myself and that's never good!

Because of my picky eaters I used cashews and eliminated the bagel chip things. Those weren't around in the 70's when my mom made this for the first time for my birthday:)

This is SOOO much better prepared in the oven like back in the day. 

I personally didn't find it too time-consuming to melt the butter in the oven as the original recipe instructs, but those with a need for speed could probably melt the butter and add the spices in the microwave...........but TOAST IN THE OVEN after mixing everything together.

250 degree Farenheit oven for 1 hour, stirring the mixture every 15 mins.

That oven-toasted taste is something that the microwave method simply cannot deliver.

Rating is with my changes. Double the seasonings, baked in oven at 250 for 1 hour stirring every 15 min. Used 9 cups of cereal, 2 cups of goldfish, 1 cup of pretzels.

I added 2 tbsp soy sauce to 3 tbsp Worcestershire sauce.  2 heaping tsp of garlic powder, 2 tsp season salt and 1 heaping tsp of onion powder.  I used Crispix cereal in place of the rice and corn Chex as they were not available.  I used shreddies for the wheat Chex.  Turned out amazing.  I love the flavour the soy sauce adds.

I made this microwave version with some hesitation, but it turned out fine. The five-minute time was more than enough and I stirred every minute rather than two, but it tastes just as good and was as crisp as oven-baked.

After reading all of the reviews and tweaking it accordingly before I made it (1-1/2 times the butter, double the spices AND cooking it in the oven), it tastes pretty darn good (I can't imagine how bland it would have tasted without these changes).  I still I feel like there is something missing though.  Next time I will add a little more heat - either hot sauce or cayenne pepper.

Bacon grease was originally used and it must be baked in the oven the day before you need it for best flavor.  This is a good starter recipe for people who have never made it but it needs a little modification.  Double the spices and butter and melt it in a separate pan and then drizzle it over the mix, tossing several times between drizzles.  You can add in a little hot sauce if you like it spicy and can substitute any of the ingredients for ones you like better, like Crispex instead of Chex, Goldfish crackers, etc.  Just substitute the same amounts.  I like to use Texas Toast brand garlic croutons in mine and I use the nuts my family likes best, but add extra.  I also add Planters Sweet and Crunchy peanuts in addition to what the recipe calls for.  Just remember to watch the number of cups of ingredients you add and know that you may need to increase the spices and butter even more to account for the extra volume of ingredients.  Be prepared to hide some for you because it will go fast!

Good basic recipe but needs a few changes...Double ALL spices (except butter) and bake at 250° for 45-60 minutes. Makes for a crunchy/roasted flavor that you & your guests won't be able to stop munching on! If you want to add a little kick, just add a few dashes of cayenne pepper and/or Tabasco to taste.

I make this every year and each year I add something different. The family places bets to see if any of them actually know what I am going to add! It's fun watching them try to guess before I bring the mix out.  This year I added sunflower seeds and sent it to my hubby's Christmas party at work. I guess they liked it because none was left at the end of the day.

A classic!  You can't go wrong.  We have some family members with nut allergies, so I sub Cheerios for the nuts - it is a great addition.

I made the half recipe that I found on the Chex website. However, I don't like the pretzels or bagel chips, so I used Cheerios cereal to replace the bagel chips and pretzels. It seems that it could use more butter and seasoning mixture. Mine turned out not well enough coated and I had to add more butter and of the Worcestershire sauce.

A staple during the holidays at our house! We skip the bagel chips but add in some sort of cheese cracker like cheese nips or goldfish - adds a bit of variation in there. We replace Corn Chex as well with Cheerios and Kix cereals. Doesn't make much of a difference to the taste, but the variation in cereals makes it fun for little kids (I used to put the cheerios on the pretzel sticks as a kid)
