I made some changes to this recipe to make it suitable for my husband who is diabetic. I used splenda and added just a touch of vanilla extract. I also baked it in a single deep dish crust instead of 2 regular. It was very good, even our non-diabetic friends enjoyed it. It was very fluffy and light and had a nice smooth consistency. We added a dollop of sugar free cool whip and a few chopped pecans before serving. I will definitely make this recipe again.

This is excellent.  I use 1/3 less fat cream cheese, add 1/4 tsp. ground cloves, 3 1/2 Tbsp. flour & 4 Tbsp. milk.  Adding flour gives the cheesecake structure.  Since I prefer my cheesecake a little firmer, this works well and for those with the same preference, you may want to try this.  I served this dessert for Easter and it went over very well with many compliments received.  Good post!

Fabulous!  I liked it better than regular pumpkin pie.  I used low fat cream cheese too!  My family seemed disappointed when they heard there was no regular pumpkin pie, but after tasting it they were very impressed!!

Very good.  I used this recipe for cupcakes instead of pie and turned out great.  Added a little more spices and sugar.  Put in cupcake liners with vanilla wafers for crust and baked for 20 min at 325.  Topped with whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon and they were great little treats.

I love cheesecake and pumpkin pie, so I was excited to try this.  It lived up to my expectations, and my whole family enjoyed it as part of our Thanksgiving dinner.  I used pumpkin pie spice, which has the cinnamon, ginger, nutmet, and allspice already in it, which simplified things.  And I made only one deep dish 9" cheesecake instead of two 8" cheesecakes...would rather have a little leftover than two skimpy pies.  I had to bake it a little longer, but it was worth it...delicious and would definitely make again!

Nice, subtle flavor, super-easy, especially if you whip it up in a food processor.

My wife has made this twice in the last month! Is a very quick and easy recipe but tastes just as good as the fancy cheesecakes. Would highly recommend

We liked it! I would probably prefer to make the crust next time or try the graham cracker crust since it taste more like cheesecake. But the mixture is good. I'd make it again. Just be sure to mix well. The cheese could come out a tad chunky if you don't.

This is by far the best pie I have ever made.  I accidentally bought Libby's Pumpkin Pie Filling, instead of the pureed pumpkin, so  I omitted the spices.  I also baked it on a graham cracker crust.  Superb!!!

This is the first type of cake/cheesecake/pie I have ever made and it came out great. It was easy and tasted wonderful. I added a lil extra sugar because some said it wasn't sweet enough and my pies needed to cook a little longer than 50 minutes. I took one to an office party and it was a big hit. Thanks for a great recipe.

I've made this twice now...the first time last Thanksgiving and the second time today.  The first time I used regular pie crusts, but today I used a graham cracker crust and put it in a springform pan, covering the bottom of the pan with foil (outside of the pan) and placing in a water-bath to bake.

I followed the recipe, except I used a graham cracker crust, real pie pumpkin, and fresh grated ginger.  My guests couldn't get enough, and not a soul complained about not having pumpkin pie with their Thanksgiving meal.  This really was better, light and fluffy, yet pumpkin-y enough to satisfy even the purists.

This was yummy and SO easy to make!  Like someone said before, I added some flour, 1 tsp and it still came out a bit runny. I also added some brown sugar and a little more that 1/2 cup pumpkin. It took much longer than 50mins to bake, I baked it for about 1hr 20mins and lowered the temp to 325 after 1 hr. It was so good! I'm sure it will be even better next time I make it.

This was so great.  It's not heavy in the pumpkin arena and was just heavenly.  Filled my house with a wondrous smell.

I didn't care for this recipe.  The filling only filled the pie crusts half way up; the cream cheese made white lumps in the pie; and the filling was not very good.

I did this recipe twice. The first time I filled a 9x13 pan and the recipe was VERY THIN. Then I tried again and filled one 8x8 pan and it was GREAT, much thicker! I also cut the cheesecake into squares and put them on top of ginger snap cookies for individual bite size pieces. I won a friendly dessert competition in the Non-Chocolate Dessert Category!

I have made this two Thanksgivings in a row! People love it and are now expecting it! 

Depending on my mood, I will change up the crust from time to time or add it to a spring form pan. 

Great Recipe the way it is!

I made these in muffin tins from a review i saw on here...i used cinnamon and vanilla as spice, no ginger or nutmeg...and instead of vanilla wafers as the crust i used keebler pecan sandies...they fit the muffin tine PERFECTLY and gave it a buttery crunchy crust rather than a mushy vanilla wafer...I also pared these treats with a Maple Cream Cheese Frosting...and then atop, I put a pecan...SO delicious! I am going to be making different variations of these too, vanilla caramel biscotti...rasperry cream...possibilites are endless! So much easier than a cake or pie, in my opinion...and they look more appetizing!!!!

Wonderful recipe!  My husband and I love it, definitely one of our favorites.   I've made it multiple times and using low fat cream cheese and chocolate crusts, very good.

I made this twice during the month of November. Once as a trial run before Thanksgiving. My husband and mother loved it! I followed the recipe, the only thing I did differently was I used one 9 inch gram cracker crust instead of 2 8 inch pastry shells. When the cheesecake cooled, I just topped it with Redi-Whip and a sprinkle of cinnamon. I made it again for Thanksgiving and once again, it was gone that same day! The family loved it! My husband is requesting I make this during the year too!

Wonderful!  Everyone in my family enjoyed this at Thanksgiving.  I'm not a big pumpkin pie fan, so to me this tasted exactly like pumpkin pie, only better :)  I used 1/3 less fat (Neufchatel) cream cheese which turned out fine.  Also I did a graham cracker crust, added a little vanilla extract and made one 10-inch pie rather than two 8-inch pies (it was exactly the right amount of filling for a 10-inch pie).  Definitely top this with some homemade whipped cream like traditional pumpkin pie, because it is not super-sweet.  I would absolutely recommend this recipe if you are looking for a tasty pumpkin pie alternative!

My husband says original recipe probably gets 3 1/2 stars.  I used Nilla wafers and butter to make a crust, added 1/2 cup plain yogurt to the filling and poured it into a 2.2 quart rectangular pan.  It's much easier to control your portion size this way.

I use one 9 inch deep dish shell, and add just a bit of vanilla and a little extra sugar.  It makes it unbelievably thick and sinful!  I make this year round, as I am a cheesecake junkie and my husband could live on pumpkin pie.

This recipe is exactly what I was looking for with a mixture of cheesecake and pumpkin. Doubled the recipe exactly and made 2 large rectangle pans, one for us and one to share.

This is the best pumpkin cheesecake I have ever made!  My family loves it, including two of my sons who don't like anything cheesecake.  They said it's better than pumpkin pie.  The only ingredient variations I made was using 1/3 light cream cheese instead of regular cream cheese, and 1/2 cup of Domino Blend (sugar/stevia combination) instead of sugar.  I used one big pie crust, which was the Keebler graham cracker crust with 2 extra servings.  The batter fit perfectly in that crust.  I baked it for one hour.  This will be a new regular dessert at our house!

Made it today with a gluten-free crust.  I use Bob's Red Mill 
Gluten-Free Shortbread Cookie mix for pie crust.  Plenty of crust for two pie pans, baked it for about 8 minutes then filled the crust. It is a lovely combination with the pumpkin cheesecake.  My family loves it!  The kids would like it a bit sweeter but it is great by my standards.  Very simple and fast recipe.  It did take longer to bake but I made my thick in smaller pans so it needed more time.  Fresh whipped cream made it divine!

I made this for a group of 6 people and it was a huge success. I used low fat cream cheese and instead of white sugar I used coconut sugar.
Two of my guests requested to take some home with them!
