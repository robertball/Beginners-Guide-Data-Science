I was making cinnamon rolls and wanted a glaze to go with them. This worked out great. I ended up not using the full bag of powdered sugar, used about 2/3 instead, but that had more to do with not needing that much glaze. Though instead of lessening the liquids I just kept these amounts. The texture is a little thin if you're frosting cookies or something like cupcakes, but if you're just drizzling over rolls like I did or over say a pound cake then this works out well. It's not overly sweet but so tasty. Now I just need to make something to go with the extra I had.

I thought this was very good and easy. I only made half and that was enough. I also forgot the almond extract and never missed it. It was sweet and pretty much tasteless which is good because it's really not part of what you glazing, it just makes something look more appetizing.  It doesn't overpower your backed goods.  It had a great consistency and went far. I'll make it again.

I did not have corn syrup, so I found a recipe for a substitute. This was WAY too watery, so I added about 5 spoonfuls of flour. The glaze kept oozing off my cookies, leaving the sides green and purple.Thank you for a great recipe, and being the first to comment, i hope that this review will make this popular. Once again, THANK YOU

Exactly what I needed to top off my pumpkin bread! I used an extra slow cooker bag to cover until use.
