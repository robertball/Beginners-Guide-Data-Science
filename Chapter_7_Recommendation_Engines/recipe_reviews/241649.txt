I did half the amount of powdered sugar and kept everything else the same. For the topping, I used a cup of semi sweet chocolate chips, melted and spread it evenly over the bars. I then added some chopped peanuts on top. Delicious!

I hoped for a traditional Rice Krispie bar with a peanut butter flavor - but these were a much heavier texture, very dense. They taste good (because I love peanut butter) - but will have to stay refrigerated and won't be a good snack to take along to another location.

Was just a bit too rich and got a bit too hard. But tasted good!

Very disappointed with how these turned out. The cereal ended up being soggy and just a weird texture all the way around.

I followed as written, and results were tasty, but very, very crumbly. Super messy to cut, more so to eat! Will try again, but add maybe 1/3 cup of honey.

I followed the recipe exactly. The flavor is good, but they were too dry and crumbly to get out of the pan in one piece. Did not work well at all for serving to others.
