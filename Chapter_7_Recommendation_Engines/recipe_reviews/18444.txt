The easy fix is what makes this recipe a winner. This is barely enough sauce for more than 2 diners and I have to serve 4, so I used 12 oz cream cheese, 1/2 cup butter,1 c milk. I cooked  the red peppers with the chicken. I also tossed the broccoli in to cook with the pasta so it would be "easier" on the kids, skipped the zucchini, and topped off w/parmesan.

At first I thought that this was going to be a flop because the butter and cream cheese just curdled and looked terrible. I stirred it with a wooden spoon and didn't know why it wasn't working. the recipe says to mix it over low heat until smooth. I was about to throw it away but I didn't have anything else to feed my kids and stuck with it, hoping to make something of it. I upped the heat to medium and used a fork to stir it. after five mins of this it finally starting looking like alfredo sauce and after that it was easy. 4*

Absolutely AMAZING!  I have never had an Alfredo sauce like this one!  The most expensive/fanciest restaurants do not compare.

This was soooooooo good!  I'm very picky about my sauces that I make.  I NEVER buy the store bought stuff in jars so I try and make my own.  This was very easy and so tasty.  My hubby even liked it. I added 1/2 cup more milk, fresh mushrooms and a diced tomato for garnish.  I will make this again. I think it would be great with shrimp too.

Alfredo sauce has been my nemesis for years until now!  This recipe is fabulous.  I used low fat milk and cream cheese and did not find it heavy or sticky.  I used real garlic insted of garlic salt and substituted asparagus for broccoli. Fabulous meal!

Took advice from other reviews. Added 12 oz. cream cheese, 6 tblsp. of butter, 1 1/2 C. milk. For the sauce I melted cream cheese first, then added butter, then whisked in milk. Turned out great. Used red bell pepper and basil from garden. Also used diced fresh garlic, onion powder, dash of cayanne powder, red pepper flakes and parmesean cheese. Sauteed bell pepper with chicken. Next time I will add mushrooms. Thank you for a great reciepe!

Very good; but I could see there wouldn't be enough sauce, so I halved the amount of veggies and chicken.  WHEN I make it again, I will double the amount of cream cheese and milk; and also I would make more pasta.  I might spice it up a bit also; but that is just for my personal taste.

This sauce is so creamy and very tasty!  Very easy to prepare.  I added a bit more garlic and it turned out wonderfully!  My husband is picky about his alfredo sauce and even he loved this one!

Fast and fantastic. I never made an Alfredo sauce before and was very pleased with the results. A word of warning, do not let the pan you're using to melt the cream cheese get too hot. The cheese will imediately stick to the pan and turn into a paper like product. A note to Suzie who said she couldn't get the sauce to become smooth, I don't know why not. Once the milk is added to the cheese/butter it instantly smooths out. Just remember to keep stirring. This is a great recipe to experiment with. I didn't have any zuccini, but added some mushroom, onion and tomato to the sauce. I left out a small amount of the cream cheese and threw in a scoop of sour cream instead. It did need a lot more milk than called for. I just kept adding until I felt it was the right texture. Have fun with this you won't be dissapointed.

Excellent! Delicious! I always order this dish when eating out at Italian restaurants and this one is comparable to the best! I used a full cube of butter, and next time around I will add sauteed mushrooms.

This recipe is better than traditional Alfredo sauce. The cream cheese makes it tangy rather than pasty. Everyone in my family loved it. I doubled the sauce recipe; fried my chicken in olive oil, fresh garlic, and fresh basil (from a tube); added fresh spinach and chopped roasted canned red bell peppers to the sauce; then chopped my chicken and placed it over the fettuccine, finally pouring the sauce over the chicken and serving. The cream cheese and butter will appear curdly until you add the milk and whisk it well on medium heat. Be careful not to turn the heat up too high as it will burn the mixture. I also added a half of a cup of peccorino romano cheese into the cream cheese and let it melt before I added the butter, as well as onion powder, garlic powder, and salt. The adults added fresh ground pepper before eating, too, for a little spice. Doubling the recipe feeds about 4-5 adults and 2 children.

Very dissapointed with this recipe.  My family did not care at all for the cream cheese sauce.  Ended up throwing the rest away.  No one said they would eat the leftovers.

Loved this recipe! Very quick to prepare, tasty and great reheated. I doubled the recipe, but next time I will try adding more cream cheese and milk for more sauce. Loved the veggies, made a very pretty dish. Thanks!

Awesome!  Family absolutely loved it.  My kids compared this to the chicken alfredo served at Olive Garden.  I did take the suggestion of one reviewer by adding more milk and garlic powder.  I also added coarse ground pepper and parmesan cheese.  Another recipe that will be added to my collection.  Thanks.

WOW!  That's all I could say with every single bite.  It was so good that I actually licked my plate clean.  I added Portabello mushrooms which I think made the dish even better.  If you're looking for a great supper, look no longer!

This is a great recipe to make your own.  I took the advice of adding an extra half cup of skim milk.  Then, because I was using diced shrimp and peas instead, I added some lemon pepper to lighten the taste a little.  Turned out great! And SOOO easy with on-hand ingredients.  It will definitely be added to our rotation.  Thanks for sharing!

Really fast and really good.  The only thing I didn't add was red bell peppers because I don't like them. I also have baked this like a casserole and it turned out great.

Definitely a keeper!! This was my first venture into homemade alfredo sauce and I hated the stuff in jars.  I was afraid the sauce would be too tangy but it balanced out very well. Oh and I didn't have any of the veggies on hand so I just left those out completely. I lightly browned chicken in skillet, removed to a plate then added the butter. I had no issues with the cheese separating or not melting evenly since I melted the butter in skillet on low first, then slowly added cream cheese in chunks, stirring almost constantly.  I also added the milk a 1/4 cup at a time, mixed completely then added more.  Once all was melted and chicken chunks added, I had to turn temp up to medium since it wasn't very warm, but I watched very carefully to make sure it wouldn't separate or burn to skillet.  All in all a good dinner.

Delicious! I gave it 4 stars only because I made a few changes to suit my taste but the idea is still great! I would have never thought of using cream cheese.

I changed the proportions a bit because of what I had on hand and the fact that the amount of servings indicated didn't look right to me. I used one pound of ziti, 1 large pkg frozen broccoli and left out the other vegetables. I used 5 cloves minced garlic. As for the sauce, I used one 8oz pkg cream cheese and 1 stick of margarine then I added milk until it got to the consistency I preferred. I'm not sure how much exactly, but I would guess about 1 cup.

I added the frozen broccoli to the pasta just before the pasta was done. I let it cook a couple of minutes more and then I drained it and tossed with a little olive oil. I placed some pasta and broccoli on the plate, laid a sliced chicken breast on top, (I just roasted those in the oven) and then poured the sauce on top and finished it off with a sprinke of fresh parmesan cheese.

EXCELLENT!!

Basic recipe was OK except for the measurments. Yes, as other reviewers stated, the half cup of milk was certainly not enough. I used two cups of fat free half and half. Apparently I've only had alfredo sauce that included parm and without it, tasted more like a cream sauce. I did add lots of parm and with that and the addition of more liquid, it really turned out wonderfully. I must say that I loved the creaminess that the cream cheese added to the sauce, but without the parm it would have been a little dull for our tastes. Thanks Lisa, for a good start.

ohhh..myyy...goood... that was the first words out of my mouth!  I modified by pan frying the chkn w/ Lawry's seasoned salt and LOTS of Lemon pepper w/ a small bit of olive oil and set it aside.  I followed another users suggestion and halfed the sauce.  4oz. cream cheese, 1/2 c. milk, 3tbsp. butter and added 4 seasons pepper corns (cracked of course), and more 1tbsp. garlic powder.  I boiled broccoli, califlower, julian styled carrots.  Absolutely AWESOME!  Thanks!!!

I have tried many different recipes for chicken alfredo over the years and just never felt they were right.  Until I found this one!!  My family raves over it.  I usually end up making a double batch.  The nice thing about this recipe is that you can easily substitute vegetables or leave them out if you wish.

So good! I left out the zucchine and red bell pepper, and add carrots. This was a big hit.

This was ok.  There was not enough sauce or chicken.  Not bad - but I think there are better alfredo recipes out there.

this did not turn out well at all. I took forever for the sauce to come together and only did so after about an hour of whisking and adding the milk.  Even after it did finally come together is was too thick and that was after a whole cup of milk.  Sorry to say that I will not be making this one again :(

This recipe was quick, easy, and delicious.  The only changes I made were adding Italian seasoning and one chicken bouillon cube to the sauce.  I think this added nice flavor.  I also used angel hair pasta.  I would also like to add some parmesan cheese the next time around for a little extra flavor in the sauce.  I will definitely be using this recipe again!

This sause was awesome!!!  I was leary at first(cream cheese and butter??) but OMG..it was outstanding!!  I did use the advice of others and used 2x the milk called for.  The sauce was rich and creamy.  I cubed chicken and sauted it in a garlic butter...yummy!!  Thank you so much for a new fav...btw, it is even better the next day!

I was a bit afraid while heating the sauce at the beginning. It appeared curdled, but as it cooked on medium heat, I used a whisk until it started to boil. WOW! This recipe is awesome! Restaurant style....maybe better!

delicious!  my husband took one bite and said "this may be my new favorite dinner"...so thats always good! i used all the ingredients, but made some changes in cooking this.  i did not mix everything in with the sauce.  i steamed the broccoli and zucchini separately, and sauteed the chicken and red pepper together with blackened seasoning.  then i put the veggies and chicken on top of the pasta and covered it all in sauce. it really was resaurant quality!

I made this for my girlfriend and I, and we both loved it.  Only caveat is if you don't like creamy, rich sauce (like my brother) though, you might want to avoid it.

I know I am absolutely in the minority here, but I thought this recipe was awful.  The sauce was very bland, even though I added garlic.  The sauce was like glue, I even put more milk in than was called for and it was still really gluggy.

I love fettuccine alfredo and thought this was a great recipe.  Both my husband and I liked it and it will make it into the rotation!  I took another reviewers suggestion and used spinach instead of the other veggies and I grilled the chicken breasts and cut them into strips and laid them atop the pasta and sauce.  I'm sure it would be good with any veggies.  Will also experiment with some spices (more garlic!), but it was great as is.  I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and skim milk and still very creamy and rich.  Thanks!

We really enjoyed this one, although I wish I'd read the comments before. It was very lacking in sauce and as some people mentioned, the brocolli was still crunchy. Still, I loved the taste. I used double the noodles and there was enough for a hefty serving for both of our lunches the next day.

This wasn't bad at all! The time it took to prepare was misleading, my vegtables weren't soft enought for me in 20 minutes.  Word to the wise: the next time I'll make sure and not use low fat cream cheese.

We didn't really care for this. It was pretty bland. I think alfredo with whipping cream, butter, fresh garlic and parmesan is much more flavorful.

I loved how easy this recipe was, and I didn't expect it to be so delicious...but I was pleasantly surprised. In the past I had a hard time finding an alfredo recipe that I liked, but I love this one!

I sateed garlic instead of garlic salt and added extra milk so it would be thinner and go farther, also added some fresh parsley at the end. Amazing!

I made this about a year ago, and then today.  I  put a bit more garlic powder in  (and the first time I made it, I put minced fresh garlic in it), and tons of freshly ground pepper.  I put a bit more milk in than called for, the full fat version.  It was easy to make, and is a family favorite.

This was so easy to make. I used leftover rotisserie chicken, leftover broccoli, and a tomato that was too ripe for salad. (Thanks to the earlier review that suggested adding tomatoes.) Everyone (including the 3 year old) loved it. There were no leftovers. Thank you for sharing this keeper.

I love this sauce.  I substituted the red pepper with green pepper since I didn't have any.  I also added more 2% milk and decreased the butter by 2 tbsp.  If you're feeding a large family, you will definitely need to make use of more than one block of cream cheese and the butter called for in the original recipe.  This only made enough for about 3 servings, and we don't eat large portions.

I agree with the numerous reviews that this recipe needed twice as much milk as directed. I added 1-1/2 cups total because the cream cheese became so sticky and thick. Next time, I'll use chicken broth and milk, because all the milk diluted the spices and I had to add more. Not good when trying to reduce sodium. Thanks for the post, but I may stick with my recipe from college where you use 1 pint whipping cream, 6 tbsp butter, and simmer both until bubbles form. This type of sauce is thinner and more suitable for pasta; the cream cheese sauce in this recipe overwhelms the pasta, especially if you're using thinner types. Thanks for the post, but if you follow this recipe, DOUBLE THE MILK!

Very, very good!  I didn't add addt'l milk as others did.  I cooked my chicken with minced garlic and sauteed my veggies on the side (my husband won't eat them).  I also used asparagus - sooo good.  A little dash of cayenne pepper added a nice zing to the recipe.  My husband and daughters all said it was one of the best new recipes we've had.

I tried this recipe to use up a package of cream cheese.  It was OK, but if you had to BUY cream cheese, buy cream and parmesean cheese and make authentic alfredo. Sooooooo much better and no more work.

I made a few changes to the cooking method.  I cooked the chicken, garlic and a touch of spring onions, added the cream cheese (all at a low heat, so that clumping would not take place) adding slowing my milk - it requires more than a half cup, I'd say at least a cup and a half.  Let this slowly "meld" and lastly adding zucchini, broccoli and fresh mushrooms.  I served with fresh parmesan and parsley.  My husband commented how really good it was.  Thank you for sharing this recipe

I didn't started with the cream cheese cold. I think it would have helped make the sauce creamier if it was at room temp. Other wise it was very good and easy to make for a 14 year old!

Great alfredo sauce!  I read that it could be bland, so I cooked up the sauce in the same pan I had seared the chicken to make use of some of the juices and used fresh pressed garlic.  I had no problem with blandness, and I have never had such success with an alfredo sauce!  The heavy cream and parmesan sauces always clump up on me, and I liked the cream cheese sauce flavor better.  Plus, I was able to make with only a few ingredients I already had on hand.  (Much less expensive than fresh parmesan.)  I used only broccoli for the veggies, and my family loved it!  Also, no problem with sauce being too thick, although I didn't really measure the milk, just added until it looked right.  Great recipe!

This recipe is very easy and quick.  I've used it when I've had unexpected food-guests.

I doubled the milk when I do this recipe because the sauce was way too thick to eat.  Once I added the extra milk though, it was the perfect consistancy.  

I also steam the vegetables before I add them.  I found that they are a little too crisp.  I also tend to just use the broccolli unless I am sure my guests are huge zuchinni/red pepper fans, though that is just personal preference.

There is no detail about how to prepare the chicken.  I've found simply preparing it using a little salt and a decent amount of freshly-ground pepper gives it just the right "zing" the chicken needs for Fet. Alfredo without taking away from the sauce's flavor.

This was wonderful!!  So rich and creamy.  I did as others suggested and added a cup of milk instead of just 1/2 cup to make more sauce.  I also just got a 1lb bag of frozen broccoli, califlower and carrots and cooked them the regular way and then placed them on top of the pasta and then poured the sauce over top that.  The only thing I added to the sauce was the chicken.  The recipe says it makes 4 servings but I only got 3 as I had 2 large men to feed.  That filled them up though.  I'm definitely adding this to our rotation.

This sauce was excellent!  I served it alongside the Cream Cheese Chicken from this site (also an excellent recipe!) so I therefore omitted the chicken this called for.  Also I had no broccoli, zucchini or red pepper, so I sauteed some mushrooms and garlic, then added Neufchatel cheese, butter substitute and milk.  I also added about a 1/4 cup or so of garlic-flavored grated parmesan!  Absolutely delicious and so quick and easy!  I will definitely be making this one again...Thanks!

What can I say yum yum yum, this was so easy to make and the kids loved it. My sauce turned out a little thin ( i used 1 cup of milk) I think that is due to the fact I used frozen broccoli so next time i will do 3/4 of a cup instead of 1 cup. This will be a regular dish in my house thanks !

I make this with any cooked veggies that I have around and its always wonderful.  I find that I have to tweak the proportions to make sure its 'saucy' enough for me. It is very rich.

Wonderful sauce. It took awhile for the creme cheese and butter to melt and become smooth so just be patient. It is worth the wait. I served the veggies on the side as I like fresher tasting veggies, not covered in sauce. All the family raved!

This had a good flavor but the sauce was a little thick when made as stated, we just added a little extra milk to fix the problem.  Very rich tasting too.

This was delicious !!! It was absolutely amazing and fun to make. The only thing that i would say would be to use medium heat instead of low heat when melting the butter and cream cheese. As well as put the milk in with it too before it is smooth because it helps for some reason. I left out the zucchini and the bell pepper because my fiance doesn't like those kinds of things in pasta. overall amazing and will be using this recipe from now on!! I'm actually cooking it again tomorrow night!!!

Very fast and delicious.  Excellent meal for a last minute throw together.  You probably have everything you need on hand. I needed to modify the recipe b/c of dietary constraints: neufchatel cheese and almond milk.  Used garlic salt and red pepper flakes. Only had broccoli, so that's the only veggie we had.  Very yummy.  Will definitely make again.

This was a very good recipe. I mistimed a little, so the sauce was just sitting there for a bit. To regain its texture, I added more milk, and it worked well. I complemented this with garlic bread and am very satisfied with the results.

DELICIOUS sauce. I was simply looking for an alfredo sauce to use with shrimp... So I did this with shrimp & yellow squash (what I had on hand) but the sauce is AMAZING. Super yummy and this will be my go-to for alfredo sauce for any recipe. YUM!! :)

Turned out great! I was doubtful because there was no parmesan and I substituted onions for garlic powder. It would be better with parmesan on top, but I didn't miss it.

When you first mix the butter and cream cheese, it looks horrible, very lumpy and the butter seperates fromt he cream cheese.....I thought it wasn't going to work out, but the more I stired it, the smoother and thicker it got.  I also added black pepper and a pinch of nutmeg (my Grandma's secret to Alfredo sauce).  :-)   Great recipe though!  So good!  I was a little concerned about using "cream cheese" but it totally works in this dish.  You can't even taste it.  Very creamy and comforting.  I left out the broccoli, zucchini and bell pepper (personal preference) and served steamed broccoli on the side.  Yummy recipe!

I must say, I was a little worried that this wouldn't turn out, but it was very good and my husband loved it. We used bowtie pasta and omitted the zucchini, and bell pepper (because I didn't feel like chopping!) and substituted shrimp for the chicken. I did take another reviews advice and used 12oz cream cheese, 1/2 cup butter, and 1 cup milk. I also used fresh minced garlic instead of powder and threw in a little cayenne, dried basil, and used an "Italian Seasoning Grinder." Very good! We will make this again!

So good! The cream cheese really makes the dish, you can't taste it. So creamy and full of flavor. I had to hide the fact that there is cream cheese in it, my husband gets weird about things like that! I only used broc & chicken, no peppers or squash. Will make again and again!

my husband called this restaurant quality; i'm presuming he meant a good restaurant by the way he wolfed it down. didn't have any red pepper, so i used carrots instead. it was very tasty even tho it seemed kind of odd not to use any fresh onions or garlic. and i, too, had a problem w/the melding of the cream cheese and butter but just went ahead and added the milk which smoothed it right out. b/c i forgot to read any reviews until i was almost done, i threw the veggies in w/the pasta about 2.5 minutes before it was done, as another reviewer suggested, then scooped them out and into the sauce to finish cooking. next time, i might add a little red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit as another reviewer suggested. overall, very tasty, very easy and pretty quick.

Very bland! my husband loves chicken alfredo usually but he did not like this recipe at all. I didn't think it was terrible, just bland. If I were to try this again I would make more sauce and add some spices to give it some taste.

YUM! Wasn't sure how I would like the cream cheese in the sauce, but it was wonderful! My dad, who usually doesn't like creamy sauces, fell in love with this.  I did end up putting more milk in here...it got way too thick. I also added some sliced yellow, red, and green peppers...

I loved this!  I agree, maybe only 4T of butter, and we also added Italian seasoning, but it was a great way for us to use the zucchini and brocoli that we over planted in our garden!  My kids even loved it!

This recipe is a family favorite! We leave out the zucchini and red pepper because of the kids but it's still delicious. The alfredo sauce is better than I've had at any restaurant!

A really delicious way to use the leftover Lime Chicken (made with a recipe from this site) in my freezer.  It brought so many yummy flavors to the alfredo sauce.  The only vegetable I added was sauteed mushroom.

This was quite good, but I really prefer the "Quick and Easy Alfredo" from this site.  I chose this recipe because it didn't call for parmesan cheese which I was out of, but this sauce was just too cream cheesey, and even though the quick and easy alfredo uses cream cheese, it just has a much more true alfredo taste.  Still good though, I'd make it again.

Great base recipe. You can modify to your liking - I prepared it omiting the butter, milk and onion powder and instead substituted fresh garlic and a whole package of cream cheese. I used roasted red/green bell peppers. Using these few changes gave the dish a whole new dimension and my husband loved it! Thank you!

I liked it, but hubby thought it was too bland. I first browned the chicken in some EVOO with 2 garlic cloves minced. When that was done, I followed the rest of the recipe, but had to add 1 c of milk instead of a 1/2. I also added parm cheese to the sauce while it was cooking I added broccoli in mine with the chicken. I might fix it again, but will probably try another recipe first.

This was "different".  It was good, but I could taste the cream cheese, which is kind of odd for an Alfredo sauce.  I did add 4 cloves of garlic, minced, to chicken as it was cooking and I added some Parmesan to the sauce.

Good base!  I used whipping cream and added 4-5 cloves of minced garlic and fresh basil at the end.  VERY good, and as well as broccoli and zucchini, I added some yellow squash too!  YUM!  Even my two year old is grabbin up the noodles covered in the sauce!!

This was awesome.  It was very flavorful and didn't have that floury or pasty taste you sometimes get from a cream sauce.  I added a 2 dashes of chili powder for a little zinf.  I would definetly make this again.

This recipe was great! When melting the cream cheese and butter together, please note it will not be mixed together until you add in the milk.  You will then have a sauce after that. I added a bit more veggies and chicken. So Good!

It was alright, I thought it might be bland, so I did my best to spice it up, but it still wasn't as flavorfull as I wanted.  I'll probably use the sauce again, but build on it with other ingredients.

This tasted great, but I had to make some adjustments to the recipe. The amount of cream cheese is too much so I had to add about an extra cup of milk.

My family LOVED this recipie. I omitted the red pepper, because we are not fans but have made several since finding a month or so ago. This is also the recipie that got my 1-year old to eat "chicken". He would not touch meat before I made this dish, now he eats it all the time. My husband calls him a "chicken theif"

I live in a country where you can't find the Alfredo sauce in a jar, and since my family loves it so much I had to find a recipe to make it myself.  I think this recipe is awesome.  The only thing I do differently is take out the red pepper and zuccini and add broccoli.  My kids won't eat it otherwise.  I also add freshly grated parmesean to the sauce and on top.  YUMMY!

This wasn't too bad. My husband thought it was ok. It would have probably been a little better had I had more cream cheese. I only had a couple Tablespoons left in the tub and my butter was unsalted butter. It still turned out pretty good when I put in the garlic, salt and pepper. I also added shredded parmesan cheese after cooking and all I had was red pepper, chicken, and mushrooms. 
I did have to end up putting a little more salt in for my taste, but then again I'm pregnant.
Will make again.

the only ingredient adjustment i made was that i used cream cheese with herbs which also meant that i needed no added salt or pepper. i did find that i needed more than 5 mins to cook the veggies.  i also covered the pan when simmering the veggies, and that ensured that the sauce didn't evapourate and get too thick.
excellent recipe!

Really enjoyed all of the veggies in this dish. Only complaint is I thought it was a little to thick, I would probably add a little more milk. Will make again.

I am always a little leary of quick alfredo sauces (because they are often not good), but this recipe is WONDERFUL!!  I followed the sauce recipe exact & it took a little time for the butter & cream cheese to mix together, but it was still done before my noodles.  I am giving the recipe 5 stars because it makes delicious use of a few ingredients already in my home and it REHEATS WELL in the microwave (almost tastes better the second day).

THIS RECIPE IS AWESOME. MY HUSBAND AND I MADE THIS OVER THE WEEKEND AND LOVED IT. VERY FILLING.THE ONLY SUGGESTION I HAVE IS TO ADD A LITTLE MORE MILK AND CREAM CHEESE AND IF YOU DONT LIKE CRUNCHY BROCOLLI BOIL FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES BEFORE ADDING TO SAUCE.  YUMMY!! DONT PASS THIS RECIPE UP!!!:)

This was FANTASTIC.  I made it with low-fat cream cheese, skim milk and 'smart balance' buttery spread.  It was hard to believe it was low fat since it tasted so creamy.  I agree with others that the veggies should be steamed or microwaved first ... mine could have been a little more cooked.  Kids don't like broccoli, but if I can just get them to try this, I think they will finally learn to like broccoli.  This recipie will become a standard one in my household.  Serve with salad and rolls ... a wonderful company dish.

I AGREE WITH THE MAJORITY OF REVIEWERS....ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! THIS WILL IMPRESS GUESTS. ADD A NICE ROMAINE WITH TOMATOES & CUKES, ADD A LIGHT OIL VINEGRETTE & GARLIC BREAD & WE'RE TALKING ELEGANT, TASTY, & EASY. ALSO, AT FIRST I TOO THOUGHT THIS WAS NOT SAUCY ENOUGH, BUT THEN WHEN I ADDED THE VEGGIES TO SAUTE, IT DID BECOME SAUCIER. DEFINATELY A KEEPER, & IT WAS DELISH THE NEXT DAY TOO!

Surprising ingredient list, but delicious result!  I gave it five stars, but I think these two changes are important: 1. Like other reviewers, I added 1/2 cup more milk which made for a easier-pouring sauce (and more of it!) 2. The veggies, ESPECIALLY THE BROCCOLI, must be half-cooked first.  Hard, crunchy broccoli does not belong in an Alfredo dish.  But the basic recipe is excellent, my husband raved about it and we'll definitely make it again!

This was definitely a hit with everyone.  It was the first time I made a meal for a dinner party (recent grad) and I was a little nervous, but it was so delicious and everyone here at the party loved it!  So, I would suggest it to anyone who likes alfredo sauce... definitely.

Anything with this much cream cheese and butter HAS to be good! :o)  A quick meal that's sure to impress. If you're serving it to a hot date or his(her?) parents, I suggest baking the chicken, slicing it, and laying it prettily on top.

This recipe was fantastic, easy, fast and great. I added mushrooms along with the zucchini and broccoli and put in micro for a few minutes before adding to sauce. My husband couldn't decide if he likes this sauce better than the tomatoe sauce. Thanks

Fantastic! I made it a little differently though, because I used a whole package (1lb I think) of pasta, and one of the people I live with is a vegetarian. 
 I sauteed a lot of veggies (1 big red bell pepper, 5 SMALL zucchinis and one large package of frozen broccoli) in a little butter with salt & pepper, while I sauteed 4 chicken breasts.
 Then I doubled the sauce, added 1 package of mild cheedar cheese, and then the vegtables. I served it with chicken to everyone except the vegetarian, and all LOVED it!

This is exactly the kind of recipe you want when you're running late and thinking
`what can I whip up for dinner'.  It is especially easy if you use the pre-cooked
chicken.  The kids love it, and you could probably use just about any type of
vegetable you want.   

I find that the sauce is a little thicker than I like, so I use a little extra milk.  I also
add a little nutmeg for extra flavor.

This was exactly the kind of recipe I hoped to find online -- easy to follow instructions and a great-tasting meal.  I'm a novice cook, and Lisa's recipe was both thorough and easy to understand.  My wife and I both loved the alfredo.  I hope Lisa has more recipes online.

I made this easier by using 1/2 of a 10 oz pkg. of frozen spinach for the vegetables (thawed and drained)

Everyone liked it.

The veggies need to be steamed in a little water in microwave oven for about 2 minutes, then cooked as directed.  Otherwise, very tasty.

My whole family enjoyed this!  I did what others suggested and used just under 1/2c butter; 12oz cream cheese (at room temperature) and added parmesan cheese and aged gouda to the sauce.  As well, I added a dash or two of cayenne pepper.  Next time I will use unsalted butter.  I found it a bit salty.

This recipe is really good, I just want to put a few tips regarding the sauce.  One is the fact that a skillet  is a must, two is that a whisk makes the combination process easier, three, melt the cream cheese before adding the butter, four do not expect the butter and cream cheese to fully combine before adding the milk.

If you increase the cream cheese, from 8 to 12 oz., you should increase the milk from 1/2 c to 3/4 c.  Otherwise it’s too thick.

First time ever making Alfredo sauce with cream cheese.  Made the dish without any adjustments and it was delicious.  Will absolutely be making this again.  Next time I will try asparagus as another reviewer suggested.

So delicious, although I did not put peppers in, also used frozen broccoli because that’s all I had but fresh would have been better, I also added a half cup of half and half to make it creamier.

Followed some of the suggestions in other reviews.... For the sauce I used 8oz cream cheese,  1/2 c. Butter, 1 c. Milk, 1/4c. Parmesan cheese, fresh parsley, pepper, garlic powder, no salt seasoning. Used fresh garlic and onion and cooked in with the chicken and incorporated that into the sauce also. 

Would make a double batch of the sauce but other than that I was pleased with how it turned out.

I worked with what I had.  Asparagus, red onions and lots of garlic.  I had Spinach bow tie pasta instead of fettuccine.  I made it the previous evening for lunch the next day.  YUM!  Waiting to hear how my hubby rates it, since he's the reason I did the Alfredo.  His favorite!  Unless he gives it a thumbs down, I plan on doing it again.

To make it low carb and because my husband was not sure about the veges I steamed the veges and served them on the side. I added carrots and poured the sauce over the veges no pasta for me. I also sauteed some mushrooms with garlic and olive oil on the side. I did double the sauce. Easy ane wonderful!

I would put this up against any restaurant! This is the best alfredo sauce I've ever eaten! The cream cheese makes for the perfect consistency, flavor, and is better than the basic recipes that use Parmesan!

So, so good! After reading through reviews, I too added a cup and a half of milk as there wouldn't be enough sauce for my family of 6. I kept the amount of cream cheese the same however, and opted for fresh garlic instead of garlic salt. Also, since all I had on hand was mushrooms, I used those. Turned out so good and was way easier than I thought Alfredo would be! Next time I will for sure use the broccoli and peppers. This one is a keeper for sure.

I found the cream cheese to be too rich for my taste, so I used greek yogurt the next time and it worked much better.

I didn't like the original recipe at all. I had to make a lot of adjustments like adding Parmesan and a lot more milk, I think it was more of my fault though. I knew it had cream cheese as the base so just make sure you want a strong cream cheese flavor. My sister liked it a lot though so it seems to be pretty hit or miss as to whether or not someone's going to like it.

I tripled the sauce recipe to allow for leftovers and to make enough sauce.  I only doubled the other ingredients for the amount of servings.  It is the wrong season here to find zucchini so I had to leave that out, and I used frozen chopped broccoli to save a little time.  This was 5 Stars with my family and I will be serving it again

I made it exactly as the recipe called and it was rather bland.  I decided to add 1/2 c  parmesan cheese,  1/2 c chicken stock,  1/2  tsp more garlic powder, salt and pepper.  It was a super hit! I must say, it is one of the best  Chicken Alfredo w/fettuccini  I've had in a long time.  I did really like the cream cheese is a great idea. It gave the sauce a creamy smooth consistency.  My husband really like that as well.

so easy and delicious. I added extra garlic and made the chicken and veggies separately attempting to evaporate as much chicken broth as possible. I added parmesan to the cream mix and added a little extra yum. 
I also kept it at a simmer for a while.

It's easy like the recipe says, and really good! I sauteed the chicken and bell pepper in oil first, then add the cream cheese, butter and milk. i let it simmer down, then added lemon pepper, sea salt, dried basil leaves and lots of Parmesan cheese. I was surprised it's such a success, and the boyfriend loves it!

I made 2 batches in one go and made some tweaks to the second batch. Technical things: for some reason my cream cheese just would not melt with the butter so I had to turn up the heat and whisk in the milk for the sauce to blend. Another thing was that I'd recommend putting in the broccoli first so that it has the most time to cook. Don't get me wrong, I love crunchy broccoli but this was a bit toooo crunchy.  This recipe was easy to execute, tasted fine and we enjoyed it but I'll keep searching for my favourite recipe :)

Loved making the sauce from scratch; way better than any bottled Alfredo sauce. Made it for a crowd of 30 with diced red peppers, shallots, wilted spinach and petite green peas and despite a veggie-averse mob, it had them coming back for seconds. This is delicious with whatever vegetables you might have on hand like sautéed zucchini, mushrooms or asparagus, steamed broccoli or carrots and/or diced tomatoes. The key component is the sauce here, so get that right and you can mix and match the pasta and veggie selection. Will certainly make it again and it does scale up for a big crowd quite easily.

I did use quite a bit more milk than called for so that I could pre-assemble and bake casserole-style for serving.

We enjoyed this meal. Next time we'll add some more of our own touches, but what a great starter! As another chef said, the cream cheese and butter didn't become smooth, but looked more curdled, but we continued with the sauce waiting to see what would happen. Because it didn't look like enough sauce for 4 adults, we added another 1/2 cup of milk and a 1/4 cup of sour cream (We should've added more garlic powder, too.). The sauce did end up smooth and creamy. It was good and we'll use this recipe again next time with our own additions....add'l garlic powder (or I saw someone else used fresh garlic). We didn't have broccoli, and used zucchini slices (halved, not julienned) with the peppers and added fresh spinach. We also used a different pasta. It was a good and tasty meal. And easy enough!

Es una receta sencilla y muy rica. Sugiero que en lugar de cream cheese se utilice heavy cream, de esa manera la salsa queda menos espesa. A mi esposo y a mi nos encanto el resultado.

This was pretty good. Made a couple of changes though.  Just used red and green bells with mushrooms and broccoli. Used half and half  instead of milk. Added about a half pound of bacon :D 
I thought it was too sweet and the flavor of the cream cheese was really strong so I cut it with about half of the bacon grease and that did the trick perfectly!

Take out the chicken for a meatless meal and it's still amazing!  I followed the suggestions of albj except did not add basil or pepper flakes, and added 1/2 c parmesan cheese before the alfredo simmered.  Also, mushrooms are a must!  (I used most of an 8oz pkg.)  I needed the full 16oz package of fettuccini after increasing the amount of sauce, but this may have been due to taking out the chicken.  We don't mind having leftovers, though.  Yum!  :)

Great recipe!  Because I was serving 4 I increased the cream cheese to 12 oz., butter to 1/2 cup and milk to 1 cup.  This was very tasty.  I also topped it off with freshly grated parmesan.  Depending on your family's tastes,  other optional veggies might be mushrooms and shallots.  I'll definitely make this again.  Thanks for sharing.

I had leftover chicken that I warmed up in the microwave while I cooked the pasta and the sauce.  2 minutes before the pasta was finished, I added some fresh broccoli to pasta water.  I added the chicken to the sauce at this point. Drained the pasta and broccoli and put on serving dish, and poured sauce over the pasta and mixed thoroughly    Surprisingly my husband and dog enjoyed the dinner.  A kale salad and fresh garlic bread rounded out our dinner.   I would add more garlic when melting the butter, perhaps fresh garlic rather than garlic powder.    Pretty good. I rated it high because we would make it again.

This was a bit of work, but not to hard. I only put the broccoli in and mushrooms. I would like to find a way to make it a little creamer though.

Delicious! The only changes I made were to use whole wheat penne pasta (after realizing that I didn't have Fettuccine noodles in my cupboard), and to add some parmesan at the end.

I browned my chicken first. Then sautéed my veggies. I kept the veggies separate from the Alfredo mixture because my kids won't eat that. I paired with roasted asparagus. It was great!!!

I recently made this recipe after reading all the negative reviews, because honestly it just sounded simple an yummy. It was a HIT with my family, they LOVED it. The only problem I had was it is too thin and my husband likes a thicker sauce, so we added a small amount of flour to thicken it up a bit. the reason I gave it 4 stars is because this is in NO WAY a traditional Alfredo sauce, but for what it is, it is freakin awesome and yummy. This is one of my favorite recipes I have tried from here,my husbands favorite also and I will definitely make this again, thanks so much for a simple but awesome recipe.

It turned out amazingly! Yummy Yum Yum!!! My roommates really enjoyed this dish. We like spicy foods so I added dices of jalapeño peppers and crushed red peppers. Also, I followed one of the commentary's advice to increase the volume of sauce, I used 16oz of cream cheese, 1 cup of milk... Came out great! To top it all off, I added mushrooms and shrimp during the final simmering process. This gourmet dish is unbeatable! Two thumbs up!!!

First time making this meal and I found this recipe on Google and I am glad I did. The sauce is great I did not add everything it said cause me and my children are picky. I just used garlic powder,salt, and pepper for taste with my broccoli of course. I did double the  ingredients 16 oz. cream cheese, whole stick of butter and 1 cup of milk. I also listened to another review on here and melted cream cheese first then butter and then added milk. Once I mixed the chicken,broccoli, fettuccine noodles(whole pack) and sauce together in one pot, I then added some seasoning salt for good taste on top in the pot and on my plate. My children are picky and they could not stop eating it and saying yummy mom. So a job well done with this recipe.

I like this recipe, it's very easy and quick, and delicious. I cook this dish for two and also substitute few things what's only makes this dish better.  I use 4 oz angel hair pasta,  4 oz cream cheese, 350 ml half & half,  3 tbsp butter, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp roasted garlic slices, 1/2 tsp basil, salt+pepper, zucchini and broccoli 1 cup of each. I marinated one big chicken breast in Italian seasoning and pesto (salt+pepper) for 15 min, then cook it on skillet, it's comes juicy and good flavored. Put all together as on this recipe and enjoy dinner)))

Pretty easy. I still tried to make it easier. Seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper while cooking it. Doubled the recipe; I feel like I quadrupled the chicken but didn't measure. I had none of the veggies so I replaced it with a bag of spinach and arugula. I went heavier on the garlic. I used medium-low heat and whisked the sauce at the beginning. I wish I would have put a smidge more milk as it was really rich. I loved how easy it was though.

Used penne pasta, 16 oz of cream cheese and 1 1/2 cups milk (bumped up amount for 10 servings). Plenty of sauce and delicious!! I cooked red pepper and broccoli for few minutes after chicken was done (in leftover seasoning and canola oil). It was perfectly done. My picky eaters inhaled this dish! This has a homemade taste without turning you off.

I wanted to make this a little healthier, so I cut down on the butter (4 tbsp) and used almond milk and it still tasted awesome. I did add minced garlic, Italian spices and more pepper than salt. I also used whole grain pasta and only used broccoli as that's what I had on hand. Sauce does not make a lot, however I don't like a ton of sauce. I would make it again.

Super simple and great flavor.  It does not taste like traditional Alfredo, and if you don't like the taste of cream cheese, be warned you can definitely taste it.  However - this is a great recipe for a quick weeknight meal.  I did increase the ingredients a little to make more sauce (since I used a pound of pasta), and added mushrooms.  Definitely recommend.

My boyfriend and I made this recipe. The sauce was delicious! We find it way better with the cream cheese rather than the soup that is normally used. The only change we made was using bow tie pasta instead of the fettuccini and we added the cooked pasta with the chicken and broccoli as well. Amazing recipe, would definitely make it again!

I followed the recipe, as stated, minus zucchini.  I got nervous that there wouldn't be enough 'sauce', mainly since I cut up way too many veggies, so I quickly doubled the sauce amounts.  Also, at first the cream cheese and butter were mixing more like oil and water, but i increased the heat a little, and kept stirring, and it finally mixed together into a cream.  This recipe turned out fantastic!  Definitely a new favorite!  Thank you for sharing.

Was looking for a way to use leftover Turkey and found this recipe.  Exchanging Turkey breast for chicken breast was the only change I made to it.  It took a quite a bit longer than the 3 minutes on medium and 5 minutes on low simmer for the broccoli to soften in the sauce.  My husband really liked this recipe and wants me to freeze some of the turkey chunks so we can have it again.  ( more leftovers!)  It makes a really colorful dish with the fresh veggies and watching the video made it easy to follow. I always wondered how to julienne a zucchini.  Now I know!

I made this dish and I loved it. I didn't have chicken though, so I just made a pasta Alfredo, LOL. I tweaked the recipe a bit, though. 

Melted 3 tablespoons slightly salted butter and 7 slices of cheese cut into pieces (broke student :P) and melted that with 3 cloves of finely chopped garlic. I added a pinch of salt since the butter was slightly salted, and added 1 teaspoon of pepper.  After melting that over high heat, I added about 3 tablespoons of cold milk and kept on stirring to prevent any lumps. The mixture turned a warm yellow and the smell was so nice. 

I had the pasta (substituted spaghetti for it, about a handful broken in half) and then boiled it until it was tender. I drained the pasta and then added the pasta to the mixture and kept stirring. Added some finely chopped coriander at the end. My first try at this dish went extremely well. Thanks.

Had to make Alfredo sauce and I didn't have any parmesan cheese.  This sauce rescued the meal.  It did feel really heavy but was delicious.

This is a great recipe. The reason why I give it 4/5 stars is because you will need to double the sauce recipe to have enough other than that it was perfect!!

I doubled the recipe because I was feeding 8 fireman and just barely had enough sauce! I also used 3lbs of chicken breast, a whole pepper, large zucchini, and a whole head of broccoli. This gave enough filler in the sauce to make up for the shortfall but it turned out awesome!!!!!

I just made this recipe today and it turned out so well! Absolutely delicious! When I cooked the chicken I sautéed it with chopped onions, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning before adding to the Alfredo sauce . Be sure to cook the chicken until tender. I added a 1/2 cup extra   milk to the Alfredo sauce because I saw that's what others suggested, and followed the remainder of the recipe as is! Turned out great! The only other thing I'll do different in the future is precook the broccoli - just so it's a bit more tender at the end! But that's a personal preference! Otherwise this is wonderful! Thanks for sharing this recipe with us!

The family loved it. I did not add the zucchini, used frozen broccoli and used a different type of pasta. Quick, easy and delicious.

Delicious!  My first attempt at Alfredo sauce from scratch but this turned out great. The only change I made was real minced garlic instead of garlic powder. Family loved it!

Made this with some leftover grilled chicken breast and it was so good. I didn't have regular cream cheese but I did have whipped cream cheese and it came out so creamy. Thanks for the recipe!

This dish was awesome. First time I made it and it was delicious. I passed on the peppers an used frozen sweet peas for a little extra crunch. I will be making this again.

This was the second time I made this recipe. It was as good as I remembered! Made this for a dinner party of 6 and it was a smashing success. I tripled the sauce and doubled the chicken. I prepared the veggies in the morning and microwaved them to soften, then refrigerated them. I sliced the chicken breasts thinly and quickly pan fried them about 1 to 1 and 1/2 minutes on each side then refrigerated all the chicken. At dinnertime I prepared the pasta and while that was cooking I made the sauce then added the vegetables and chicken. I simmered it 5-10 minutes. It was served  with a green salad and dessert. Delicious!

Simple, quick, delicious.  I usually don't write reviews unless they are phenomenal.  This gets 5 stars for me because of how easy it is.  I didn't have any bottled alfredo tonight but I had already started cooking the pasta.  I chose this recipe because I had the ingredients (except for some of the vegetables). I used canned chicken and added a touch more milk.  It worked out really well.

I would consider myself a novice when it comes to cooking. I make the same few dishes and have became good at them. However it's time to get more variety to what I'm able to cook. This recipe was a success, as long as you follow the directions and prep you shouldn't have any problems. All my ingredients were measured out and put to the side until needed. I'm happy I found this site and now I have registered. I look forward to discovering new recipes.

Didn't care for this. Thought it was bland and added Parmesan... Um, too much going on with vegetables and not enough sauce.  Its edible, but still disappointing, given all the work julianning the zucchini and all...

The taste was great, but the sauce was a bit thick for my taste. it was a very flavorful dish and I would make it again if I figure out how to thin out the sauce.

This was delicious!!!! I had to add about a half cup of water while simmering .... It was a little too thick to cook the veggies

Other than that ... As is -- with grilled chicken (rubbed with olive oil and black pepper while grill in')

Great recipe!!!!

Very well favored, easy to mKe, but will definitely need to double the recipe next time. Also added some extra milk. I used a lot of broccoli to make up for the other "not so healthy" stuff :)

Not a big fan of this sauce.  I think I have reviewed a similar AR recipe that was so much better.  You should simmer this sauce a little longer & STIR (the entire time, even continue to stir the first few minutes after removing it from heat) to make sure it mixes evenly enough. DH liked this dish ok, it turned out MUCH better the next day (like most alfredo/sauce recipes do).  Since he was content with it & most of the leftovers were used up, it wasn't a complete fail at our home. Obviously, a lot of other folks really enjoyed it (considering the rating), so I had high hopes for it...  It could be just being picky but I won't make it again knowing there are much better AR recipes for this dish that are just as simple & twice as good.

Restaurant worthy! I did double the sauce like NFL WIFE 95 suggested by using 1 1/2 bricks of cream cheese, 1 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of butter. I also added 1/2 tsp of salt and 1 tsp of garlic powder. I used the broccoli and 1 cup of mushrooms since my kids are picky with their veg. It was super delish and very filling. So easy to make too!

Sauce is a bit oily. But other then that, it was good! Topped off with parsley or cilantro, and this dish is almost heaven!!!

Tastes nice but it needs two glasses of wine for proper digestion.. Very heavy for my taste. A tip: if the butter & cream cheese isn't coagulating, after heating - combine these two ingredients, garlic & seasoning in a blender, then pour back into the skillet. It will be perfectly mixed & creamy.. Enjoy!

I was looking for something to make tonight with what I had in the kitchen.  I knew I had chicken, and my first thought was chicken alfredo...I did not have broccoli or zucchini, but I did have a bag of frozen red pepper and chopped mushroom pieces, chicken, cream cheese and butter!  Made it just like the recipe says, minus the green veggies...Was DELICIOUS!  Thanks for making my night.

I used celery instead of zucchini, and diced green pepper instead of red, I used a whole stick of butter, and a whole cup of whole milk. Needs some spicing up, for my taste, but this is an excellent recipe.

This was a creamy sauce but did not taste like an Alfredo.  As it cooled during the meal, the sauce became much thicker and we could taste the cream cheese more strongly.

I was skeptical because the only cheese is cream cheese, but I was very surprised at how delicious and easy this Alfredo recipe is.  I followed the recommendation to use 12 oz. cream cheese, 1/2 cup butter, and 1 cup milk and it was pretty tasty.  Then I added about 1/2 cup freshly shredded Asiago cheese and used fresh pressed garlic instead of garlic powder, and the flavor went over the top.  Absolutely fantastic! I omitted veggies, but will experiment with those another time.  There are so many possibilities with this basic sauce. A KEEPER!

This recipe was very good and I will tell you why. It is pretty much fool proof. I forgot to add two of the vegetable ingredients and it still turned out good. I did not have enough cream and I used almond milk to supplement and it still worked. I had a little vegetable oil left in the pan from cooking the chicken and I thought that it was going to be a disaster, but I kept going and it still turned out good. This recipe is a keeper and can stand up to anything. It tastes good the next day which is great because I have to cook many of my meals at night for the next couple of days. When warmed up it tasted great. It was filling and kept its consistency. It was just an all around good recipe. I took the advice given to save time and I cooked the pasta and the broccoli in the same pot.

Best Alfredo sauce and so easy too! I just used penne and broccoli and it was great. It's not a loose sauce and clings to everything, so I found the amount of sauce to be plenty.

yummy!  Just what I was looking for. Although I used Cream of Chicken rather than the mushroom. I also used about 4 tbs of butter instead of 6. I added 2 cans of 1% milk rather than what was recommended due to the other reviews saying it didn't make enough. I also used shrimp to change it up a bit! Next time I will use fresh garlic though for a little more authentic flavor. It was sooo good! :)

I don't know what i did wrong but the butter and cream cheese would not blend together no matter what i did. I tried using a whisk, a spoon, a fork, low heat high heat it never mixed smoothly. I ended up pouring the butter out of the pan and stirring the remainder of cream cheese together with about a cup of milk and about 3/4 cup of parmesan cheese and adding minced garlic along with garlic salt and pepper. After an hour at the stove it did end up tasting pretty good though.

This was pretty good. The only thing I changed was I added 1 cup of milk cuz the sauce was a bit thick otherwise. I also used chopped garlic instead of the powder.

I read some of the other reviews and doubled the milk, but even that wasnt enough. The pasta was bland and dry. I recommend doubling the milk and adding a lot more seasoning.

My husband and I prefer the traditional preparation of alfredo.  The cream cheese gave it a bit of a tang we weren't fans of.  Otherwise, the sauce was great and good consistency.  I did add parmesan to the sauce to try and cut the tanginess of the sauce, that improved it.

I never would have thought that cream cheese would be this great for Alfredo. It was quick and easy and even my child who will pick out vegetables ate them with no problem and got seconds. I did not have enough room in the pan for the broccoli but it was just as great.

My picky teen liked it.  I just diced some fresh tomato over my husband's and mine.  Made it like the recipe, otherwise.  Added a little more milk to hubby's so it wouldn't be too thick for him.  Good recipe!  a keeper!

this was okay. it was really easy, which was nice. The taste was a little too cream cheesy. I'll keep looking for a sauce.

I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe.  I wasn't sure once I mixed the cream cheese and butter, and like other reviewers, it took a while to melt.  Once I got it all put together (excluding noodles), I let it set on low for almost an hour while waiting on my husband to get home from work.  This turned out to be great, because everything really took on that alfredo flavor.  I had to give it a 4 because not all my kids liked it, but I'd give it a 4 1/2 if I could.  I felt like it was a fairly easy dish to prepare.

Awesome for a quick alfredo sauce! Just made it for the first time tonight with chicken breast and sauteed zucchini on the side, leaving out the red pepper. Delicious! Oh, and I use 3 small garlic cloves, crushed, instead of a powder. Served over spaghetti since that's what I have on hand.

this had good flavor but like someone else mentioned, the cream cheese never got creamy for me. It got somewhat creamy when I added the milk. I did use 3 fresh garlic cloves.

I cooked according to recipe and it was just "eh" for me and my family. I didn't even eat half my plate. Too cream cheese-y.  I prefer the original flavor of parm cheese and milk.  Also didn't like how the cheese and butter separated so easily - didn't look appealing.

Good recipe! I did make some changes. I did not have broccoli on hand, so I used yellow bell pepper and a 1/2 a large onion. It turned out really nicely! To the sauce I added a little EVOO, parsley, and Italian seasoning. First bite, we both thought this dish would be really great spicy!! I think I will try that next time:)

The recipe is good overall but I think the name could be changed so no one is expecting an 'alfredo' taste.   The cream cheese flavour is somewhat too pronounced.  A cup of chicken broth, a dash of celery seed, a tiny bit of green pepper and onion sorted that out.  I served this over the "Johnny's Biscuits" instead of pasta and it was very tasty.  The recipe is very thick if made as directed... too thick for my purposes.

this recipie is rockin' and very easy to make. I did use the 12 ozs of cream cheese and the extra milk and butter and i added cayenne pepper and did not use the asparagus and i loved it. I also minced 4 cloves of garlic into olive oil and cooked the chicken in that, it gave the chicken a great taste.

Very good!  I used neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese to reduce the fat, and it worked out great.  Next time, I will probably add a bit more milk just to have more sauce -- it was plenty thick as is.

This was pretty good but I had to add more milk to have enough sauce for the vegetables to simmer in. I suggest adding in a tad more milk and little bit more garlic powder, salt and pepper to make up for the added milk.

The sauce was nice and creamy but it wasn't an alfredo sauce to me. The flavor was too sweet and sour at the same time. I will keep looking for a good alfredo recipe.

This was very tasty, however, it does not reheat very well.  Very thick sauce next day for me.  Plus using cream cheese made it heavier than I liked.  Next time, I might try whipped cream or not use as much cream cheese. Other members of family liked it, though.

I didn't have garlic powder so I sauteed about a tsp of diced garlic in olive oil instead. I also used 1% and more milk than called for (maybe a cup), and left out the veggies (served steamed on the side). It was fast and easy to do and tasted much better than the store bought variety. We'll use this recipe again but alter a few things next time. Double it for starters, use more milk, less butter, and low fat cream cheese. 

Thanks for sharing!

Delicious. I used both garlic powder but also minced garlic from the jar. I omitted the called for vegetables and put peas in. I had to keep adding milk and adding milk but it eventually turned out just fine. Thanks for the post.

My hubby really liked this. I modified the recipe based on what I had. I used only 3oz cream cheese. 1 cup of half and half. carrots instead of zucchini and red pepper flakes instead of red pepper. Also I cooked chicken with 2 cloves garlic.  Turned out great, even my 2 yr old ate it. Great way to eat veggies!

I added the garlic and parmesan like the others, but it still needed something sharp to it.  I used whole milk and added more than the recipe called for.  Overall , a good recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

I made a few changes to this recipe-more milk (at least tripled), jarred garlic instead of powder, and threw in some mushrooms. It was awesome. The flavor and consistency were great.

We loved this recipe.  The kitchen still smelt great from it this morning.  I followed the recipe exactly and didn't feel any need for extra milk as other reviewers have said.  I served with caesar salad and sourdough bread.  Great weekday meal.

Thanks for sharing this recipe!!  It was delicious and I am NOT a big Alfredo person.  I did alter the recipe slightly - used 1-2 cloves fresh minced garlic and added 1/2-3/4 c. grated parmesean.  I also par-boiled the chicken first then placed on the grill for about 10 minutes just to brown both sides of the chicken breasts before I cut them up.  But I really enjoyed this and so did my family!!

This is a very good basic recipe, but it was much to cream cheesy for our taste. The flavour just kinda overpowered everything else. I think a more cream based saucce would go much better. Maybe increasing the cream/milk to 1-1.5 cups and decreasing the cream cheese by half would be more appropriate. I also added a little white wine which was a nice addition. Like I said, good basic idea, just needs a little tweaking. Thanx anyway though :)

My boys gave me an A for this one.  I grilled the chicken with salt and pepper and shredded it.  Next time I'll reduce the garlic powder by at least 1/2 tsp.  I had to add more milk to make a thinner consistency.

I'm not going to rate this recipe since I only made the sauce.  (I chose
this recipe because most alfredo sauce recipes require cream or parmesan
cheese, neither of which I usually have available.)  The very
easy-to-make sauce (4 stars) was quite creamy and rich, almost too much
so.  But it was a quite respectable alfredo sauce.  I likely will make
this again but probably not too often since it is so unhealthy.  (I
may try low-fat cream cheese but I don't have high hopes for it.)

The sauce was ok, but it was very thick so I added more milk...I made this in the morning and reheated it for dinner, it tasted good in the morning but didn't reheat well...may make again but will probably keep looking for a quick alfredo sauce.

This was good, my kids all liked it.  I thought the sauce was a little too heavy and thick, but not bad.

This sauce tasted great! I altered it by adding more garlic powder...otherwise it would have been too bland.

I would probably try and make this again, but I'd tinker with the cream cheese/milk mixture. I think it could be made with less cream cheese. I'm not a calorie-watcher, but it just looked like a big brick of lard sitting in the pan and the sauce turned out so thick and dense it was hard for my boyfriend and I to finish our modest-sized servings. I'd also cut back on the garlic powder or try using real garlic--garlic powder has an intense, kind of artificial taste.

I thought this was tasty. The sauce was alittle bland though so I added some spices of my own. I also used a box of frozen vegetables instead of fresh and it came out fine.

It was great, really creamy and smooth. Next time I think I will try 1/2 yoghurt with 1/2 cream cheese for less fat and about 1 1/2 cup of milk instead other wise it is too thick. Also a really good combination of veges is broccoli and mushrooms. I also panfried the chicken with seasoning it turned out great. I highly recommend this one.

Did not like the taste. And it took to long to cook.
