YUMMM!  This is a keeper!  Great summer drink...kind of a twist of my two favorite drinks...Tequila Sunrise and Amaretto Sour.  I did make it over the rocks, just because I was too lazy to get the blender out and it was great.

Good!  I only had about 2 oz. pineapple juice, but that's ok, it just meant that the drink was stronger!  I served it on the rocks instead of blending it.

I made this recipe exact, only using Smirnoff Whipped Vodka only because that was what I had on hand. I didn't bother garnishing my drink only because......we'll, I didn't. I was surprized how much I liked it. I'm not usually a fan of amaretto but I liked it combined with the ingredients in this drink. I'm about to fix myself a second.

Made with the same amounts and served in a pitcher over ice as another reviewer stated.  Turned out great!  Could use a bit more alcohol for some but for others it was just right!  Will make again.

Pretty good drink.  I'm in no mood to crush ice, so I just mixed the drink and poured over ice then served on the rocks.  this is sweet and flavorful, and a nice mixed drink.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were good. Prob. would add more vodka to make a little stronger. Would be great in the summer on a deck in the sun.

Delicious! I multiplied the recipe by 8, and made a pitcher - the ingrediants seperated, but all they needed was a little stir. The whole pitcher disappeared in a matter of minutes. Everyone loved it.

Great taste.  I didn't care for the crushed ice so the next I make them I'll just use regular ice to make it cold.  The ice floated to the top, the alcohol to the bottom and I got tired of stirring.

Very good drink, very summery and tropical. Must be a variant of a Pink Panther I had once at a restaurant, but this is good too.

Really good! I made mine shaken instead of blended. I made two rounds per the original recipe, and the third with two shots each of the alcohols and a little less pineapple juice, and that was the one we liked the best. These will be great in the summertime sitting outside in the sun.

Watch out!  This one is so good that you forget you are drinking alcohol.  It was perfect, not too sweet and a big hit at our New Year's Eve party.  Looking forward to serving this in the backyard this summer.  Keep the pineapple juice on hand and voila!
