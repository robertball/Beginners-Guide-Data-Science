I made a few changes based on personal preference and what I had on hand, but this was very flavorful and definitely something I'd make again. I omitted the sweet potato and celery, and subbed green cabbage for mixed greens and sunchoke for jicama. I doubled the pepperoncini, but I would add even more. I also used herbed feta. You definitely need the Greek seasoning (I used a mix of oregano, thyme, garlic, onion powder, and fresh basil); it adds so much flavor! Kalamata olives would be a great addition. I'll make this the same way next time, because the cabbage adds a nice texture and holds up well the next day.

Pretty tasty salad, but the name is misleading.  This is not a "winter" food, since more than half of the ingredients are only fresh during the growing season.  For those of us who eat with the seasons, the name was quite misleading.

I was very skeptical of this salad to begin with but OH, what a pleasant surprise but totally different from the salads I usually prepare.   Agreed it is a misnomer as the ingredients are available all year round but it is nice, crunchy change and good for us!!!   The only thing I would change is a bit more dressing but don't double it and I did chop up a few more pepperoncini peppers than called for.  Do give it a try, very different and will have folks guess exactly WHAT is in it!!  :)
