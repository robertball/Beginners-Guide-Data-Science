This was really easy & quick to make...guests seemed to like it - none was left by the end of the evening, although I wasn't crazy about the tanginess of the steak sauce.  I probably won't make it again.

Everyone told me this tasted like tuna, and when I told them it was chicken, more than one person told me they aren't sure if they like chicken this way.  It didn't taste bad, but it was a little different.

This is a quick and easy recipe.  Although, I used roasted garlic steak sauce and added a little more than 2 tbsp.  It goes well with Ritz crackers.

Try it with hot wing sauce instead of steak sauce.  Buffalo Wild Wings sells bottle of their stuff, it's great!
