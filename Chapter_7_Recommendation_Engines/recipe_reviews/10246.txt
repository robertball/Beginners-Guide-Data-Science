These are easy to make and SO tasty... I had never baked cookies on my own before and I was so eager to nibble on something sweet that I didn't take the time to put the dough in the refrigerator. Does that step really make that much of a difference? Because I can't imagine these cookies tasting any better!

I tried a recipe with just a slight variation before I found this exact one and this one is much tastier due to the use of the juices, not just the zest.  Also if you cut the slice in 1/2 it looks more realistic like a fruit slice.

I'm rating this 4 stars only because I tweaked the recipe. Instead of adding the lemon zest to my batter, I whizzed it with the flour in my food processor, let it sit for 15 minutes, then sifted out the zest bits. Then I sectioned half a lemon and separated out the palps and mixed it into the dough after I mixed in the flour.  It gave the intense bursts of lemon I like in my cookies without having to add extra sugar to balance it.

I chose to make the lime version of these. The dough came together well and felt similar to a shortbread dough. I refrigerated for 4 hours as stated in the recipe. It was when I started slicing them that my problems began. I only got 18 out of the dough so I thought I must have sliced them too thick, I suppose they were about 1/4 inch thick. However when I pulled them out of the oven after 8 minutes I found that if anything I should have cut them thicker. They had spread quite a bit and were very thin. They also weren't done so I put them back in the oven for a further 2 minutes. Because they were thin I had some trouble getting them off the cookie sheet, I lost about half the batch that way. It's a shame I can't rate these higher because my daughters said that those I managed to salvage did taste really good. Maybe it was something I did and someone else will have more luck. Thanks for letting me try.

This wasn't bad.  I left them in a few minutes longer.  I also added a bit too much flour, just a bit, so I squeezed half a lemons juice into the batter.  But, I like lemon a lot and I like it stronger.  It's not bad.  Maybe needs more sugar as a result of the added lemon.

It's citrus season here in sunny Arizona and this is just the recipe I was looking for.  I made it with lemons and at first thought there was too much flour but I worked it in.  Froze the dough and baked them this morning.  Yummy!  These are like a lemon cookie I had many years ago that were a favorite with my grandmother.  A keeper.  Thanks for sharing!!!

These are good, fresh cookies. I was in a hurry and used tangerines, and didn't chill. They still turned out great!

Awesome! I always melt the butter, then add the sugar and mix before adding the other ingredients. This makes the cookies super chewy. I found that this recipie had a nice, strong lemon flavor that popped against the powdered sugar I dipped the cookies into right after they came out of the oven. Also, I found it easier to get a soft, chewy cookie by lowering the temp and baking them about eight minutes longer than recommended.

The cookies are so pretty! I made orange and enjoyed them very much. Next time, I'm going to sprinkle with sugar to sweeten them a bit more.

These were AWESOME! It's great that they're eggless, and I often found myself eating the mix out of  the bowl :)
I added a little more zest and lemon juice just to make the flavors pop more.

These were easy enough to make but had very little flavor. I tried orange, lemon and lime and really could not taste any difference between the flavors.

I made according to directions. The citrus I used was meyer lemon. Cookies were easy to put together, easy to slice after refrigerating dough and oh, so yummy! Light, fruity taste and not too sweet.

It was so easy to make! Didn't make any changes, except I didn't have lemon zest, so left that out. Will definitely be making again and again:-)

I added quite a bit more zest and juice to give the cookies a stronger flavor and I loved them. They're the perfect tea cookie.

I followed all of the instructions, and it did not taste at all like any kind of citrus. I will not be making this again.

These were quite flavorful.  I made the orange version with changes per reviewers suggestions; added 1 egg and a bit of baking soda, put a bit more of zest in for flavor, lessened the sugar a bit too and added my home-made orange marmalade instead of food coloring (why add coloring???) Will make again!

I made the orange version of these and here were my variations: I added 1 egg and 1/2 tsp of baking soda because I didn't want flat refrigerator cookies. I also added ~ 1/2 c chocolate chips. I dropped tsp size balls of dough and flattened them a bit on the sheet. They turned out sooo great!

I left out the food coloring (who needs it!) and the lemon zest (didn't have any and didn't feel like going out).  But these weren't half bad!

had to tweak the recipie a little, but coupled with a simple glaze, it was rather good.
