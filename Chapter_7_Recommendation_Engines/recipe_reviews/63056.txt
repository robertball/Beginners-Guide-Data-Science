I made a couple of adjustments to the preparation of this.  I used thinly sliced steaks and cut them into strips.  I then stir fried them in a tablespoon of olive oil.  After the steak strips were cooked, I removed them with a slotted spoon and kept them warm in a separate bowl and discarded the fluid that was left.  Instead of using the olive oil, vinegar, red bell pepper and olive mix as a dressing, I comined the mixture along with the spice rub in the pan used to stir fry the steak strips and returned the steak to the pan.  The steak mixture was spooned over greens, tomatoes and some shredded cheese and topped with a homemade avacado ranch dressing.  It tasted great and was light, but hearty enough to satisfy the men in my household!

This was a quick and delicious recipie!  I have made this twice and I would substitute the dried thyme with ground thyme.
